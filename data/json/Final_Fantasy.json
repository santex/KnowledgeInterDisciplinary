The\n  franchise centers around a series of fantasy and science fantasy role-playing\n  video games (RPGs), but includes motion pictures, anime, printed media, and\n  other merchandise. The first game in the series, published in 1987, was\n  conceived by Sakaguchi as his last-ditch effort in the game industry; the\n  title was a success and spawned sequels. The video game series has since\n  branched into other genres such as tactical role-playing, action role-playing,\n  massively multiplayer online role-playing, racing, third-person shooter,\n  fighting, and rhythm.\n\nAlthough most Final Fantasy installments are supposedly independent stories with\ndifferent settings and main characters, they feature identical elements that\ndefine the franchise. Recurring elements include plot themes, character names,\nand game mechanics. Plots center on a group of heroes battling a great evil\nwhile exploring the characters' internal struggles and relationships. Character\nnames are frequently derived from the history, languages, and mythologies of\ncultures worldwide.\n\nThe series has been commercially and critically successful; it is Square Enix's\nbest selling video game franchise, with more than units sold, and one of the best-\nselling video game franchises. It was awarded a star on the Walk of Game in\n2006, and holds seven Guinness World Records in the [[Guinness World Records\nGamer's Edition]] 2008. The series is well known for its innovation, visuals,\nand music, such as the inclusion of full motion videos, photo-realistic\ncharacter models, and orchestrated music by Nobuo Uematsu. Final Fantasy has\nbeen a driving force in the video game industry, and the series has affected\nSquare's business practices and its relationships with other video game\ndevelopers. It has also introduced many features now common in role-playing\nvideo games and has been credited with helping to popularize console-based RPGs\nin markets outside Japan.\n","linknr":1953,"url":"Final_Fantasy","recorded":1362551908,"links":66,"instances":["computing","esotericism","video_game","fifth_generation","series","operating_system","series","magazine","music","console","series","computer_graphics","series","media","computer_graphics","video_games","retailer","computer_graphics"],"pdf":["http://www.square-enix.com/eu/en/whatsnew/oxmEN.pdf"],"categories":["1987
