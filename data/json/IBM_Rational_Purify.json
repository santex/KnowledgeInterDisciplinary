It was\noriginally written by Reed Hastings of Pure Software. Pure Software later merged\nwith Atria Software to form Pure Atria Software, which in turn was later\nacquired by Rational Software, which in turn was acquired by IBM. It is\nfunctionally similar to other memory debuggers, such as Insure++, Valgrind and\nBoundsChecker.\n","linknr":142,"url":"IBM_Rational_Purify","recorded":1362902963,"links":14,"instances":["programming_language","computer_programming","computing","programming_language"],"pdf":["http://jjc.public.iastate.edu/Runtime.errors.Paper.March4.2006.pdf"],"categories":["Debuggers","Memory management software","IBM software|Rational Purify"],"headings":["Overview","Differences with traditional debuggers","Supported platforms","See also","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg/32px-Portal-puzzle.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["c","programming_language"],["c","programming_language"],["linker","computing"],["pointer","computer_programming"],["java","programming_language"]],"members":["c","pointer","linker","java"],"related":["Memory_debugger","Proprietary_software","Memory_debugger","Software","C_(programming_language)","C++","Reed_Hastings","Pure_Software","Rational_Software","IBM","Insure++","Valgrind","BoundsChecker","Debugger","Static_code_analysis","Source_code","Type_checking","C_(programming_language)","Compiler","Linker_(computing)","Object_code","Memory_leak","Object_code","Operating_system","Data_structures","Debugger","Pointer_(computer_programming)","Debugger","Breakpoint","Java_(programming_language)","Lisp_programming_language","Visual_Basic","Memory_leak","Memory_debugger","Programming_tool","Dynamic_memory","Memory_leak"]}
