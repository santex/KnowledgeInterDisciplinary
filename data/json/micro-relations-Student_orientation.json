The name of the period varies by country. The\norientation helps new students to organize their classes, acclimate to student\nlife, and introduce themselves to other new students.\n\nAlthough usually described as a week, the length of this period varies widely\nfrom university to university and country to country, ranging from about three\ndays to a month or even more (e.g. four or five weeks, depending on program, at\nChalmers). The length of the week is often affected by each university's\ntradition as well as financial and physical constraints. During this period,\nstudents participate in a wide range of social activities, including live music\nand other performances, sports challenges, stunts, and open-air markets.\n","linknr":245,"url":"Student_orientation","recorded":1362554957,"links":17,"instances":["engineering_society","school"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Academia","Student culture","New Zealand culture","Australian culture"],"headings":["Terminology","Orientation week around the world","Further reading","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2a/UNSW_YS2004_steamboat_squad.jpg/200px-UNSW_YS2004_steamboat_squad.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/Frosh2006.JPG/200px-Frosh2006.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/Nuvola_apps_bookcase.svg/28px-Nuvola_apps_bookcase.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["skule","engineering_society"],["gymnasium","school"]],"members":["skule","gymnasium"],"related":["University","Tertiary_education","Students","Chalmers_University_of_Technology","First_year","University_of_Melbourne","University_of_Sydney","University_of_Melbourne","University_of_New_South_Wales","University_of_Sydney","Residential_college","Janet_Clarke_Hall","Ormond_College","Adelaide_University","Adelaide_University_Union","Adelaide_University_Sports_Association","SAUA","Australian_National_University","Australian_National_University_Students_Association","Burgmann_College","Ottawa","University_of_Ottawa","Carleton_University","Quebec","CEGEP","Gatineau","University_of_British_Columbia","University_of_Toronto","Skule_(engineering_society)","University_of_Guelph","University_of_Western_Ontario","Queen's_University","Sitsit","Hazing","Necktie","Suharto","Dunedin","Palmerston_North","University_of_Otago","Highland_Games","Hall_of_residence","Hazing","College_fraternities","Student_nation","Uppsala_university","Lund_University","Students'_union","Student_overall","Tailcoat","KTH","Chalmers_Institute_of_Technology","Uppsala_Institute_of_Technology","Uppsala_University","Linköping_Institute_of_Technology","Linköping_University","Gymnasium_(school)","Permille","Jan_Björklund","Hazing","Lawrence_Sheriff_School","Student_Union","Pub_crawl","Condom","Binge_drinking","Peterson's","Alpha_Books","Endurance_game","Hazing"]}
