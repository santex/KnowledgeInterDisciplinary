Pierce spent the majority of his\ncareer as a writer for the Warner Bros. \"Termite Terrace\" animation studio,\nworking alongside fellow luminaries such as Chuck Jones and Michael Maltese.\nPierce also worked as a writer at Fleischer Studios from 1939 to 1941. Jones\ncredited Pierce in his 1989 autobiography Chuck Amuck: The Life and Times of an\nAnimated Cartoonist as being the inspiration for the character PepÃ© Le Pew, the\nhaplessly romantic French skunk due to Pierce's self-proclamation that he was a\nladies' man. [http://dmgermain.blogspot.com/2009/06/pepe-le-pew.html David\nGermain blog entry]\n\nIn early credits he was shown as \"Ted Pierce\". He was said to have added an\nextra \"d\" to his name as a way of lampooning puppeteer Bil Baird when he dropped\none of the Ls from his first name.\n\nHe contributed (with Bill Danch) the story of the 1962 Tom and Jerry cartoon\n[[Tall in the Trap]], directed by Gene Deitch. Originally the cartoon would have\nstarred Sylvester the cat and Speedy Gonzales and would have been directed by\nRobert McKimson. However, McKimson disapproved of the storyline, and decided not\nto use it. Instead, Pierce sold it to Danch and Deitch, who were desperately\nlooking for suitable storylines for Tom and Jerry.\n\nIn his Warners career, Pierce worked with three of the three best-known Warner\nanimation directors (Jones, McKimson and Friz Freleng). He contributed many\nnotable storylines for all three of them, including Freleng's [[Hare Do]]\n(1949), [[Bad Ol' Putty Tat]] (1949), [[Bunker Hill Bunny]] (1950) and [[Big\nHouse Bunny]] (1950); Jones' [[Hare Tonic]] (1945, an early success for both of\nthem) and [[Broom-Stick Bunny]] (1956); and McKimson's [[Hillbilly Hare]]\n(1950), Lovelorn Leghorn (1951) and [[Cat-Tails for Two]] (1953), the last of\nwhich was Speedy Gonzales' first appearance. However, because much of Pierce's\nTermite Terrace career was spent with McKimson's unit (McKimson considered the\nleast-known Warners animation director), it would follow that Pierce was\ngenerally overshadowed by his contemporaries as story writers at Warners, Warren\nFoster and Maltese.\n\nPierce also got occasional voice work in the cartoons. Pierce gave voice to King\nBombo in [[Gulliver's Travels]] (1939), and the villainous C. Bagley Beetle in\n[[Mr. Bug Goes to Town]] (1941), in addition to writing on those\nfilms. He imitated Bud Abbott in three Warner cartoons casting Abbott\nand Costello as alley cats Babbit and Catstello. Pierce also voiced the \"tall,\nthin\" character in [[Wackiki Wabbit]] (1943, which he wrote for Jones), and the\nFrench chef FranÃ§ois in [[French Rarebit]] (1951, which he wrote for McKimson).\nIn addition, in a few cartoons containing Jones' Hubie and Bertie, Bertie's\nvoice was Pierce; Hubie was voiced by Mike Maltese. Thereafter they were voiced\nby the principal voice actor, Mel Blanc, and Stan Freberg, who had also voiced\nsecondary Looney Tunes/Merrie Melodies duos such as the Goofy Gophers and Spike\nthe Bulldog and Chester the Terrier.\n\nTedd Pierce's own, undisguised voice (a pleasant tenor) was heard in coming-\nattractions trailers for Universal Pictures. Pierce enthusiastically narrated\nthese previews of Universal Pictures' 1940s features starring Abbott and\nCostello, The Ritz Brothers. Maria Montez, Gloria Jean, and Donald O'Connor.\n","linknr":140,"url":"Tedd_Pierce","recorded":1375075848,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Tedd_Pierce&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Tedd_Pierce&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/Animated_cartoon","/wiki/Writer","/wiki/Animator","/wiki/Artist","/wiki/Warner_Bros.","/wiki/Termite_Terrace","/wiki/Chuck_Jones","/wiki/Michael_Maltese","/wiki/Fleischer_Studios","/wiki/Pep%C3%A9_Le_Pew","/wiki/France","/wiki/Skunk","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Bil_Baird","/wiki/Tom_and_Jerry","/wiki/Tall_in_the_Trap","/wiki/Gene_Deitch","/wiki/Sylvester_(Looney_Tunes)","/wiki/Cat","/wiki/Speedy_Gonzales","/wiki/Robert_McKimson","/wiki/Friz_Freleng","/wiki/Hare_Do","/wiki/Bad_Ol%27_Putty_Tat","/wiki/Bunker_Hill_Bunny","/wiki/Big_House_Bunny","/wiki/Hare_Tonic","/wiki/Broom-Stick_Bunny","/wiki/Hillbilly_Hare","/wiki/Cat-Tails_for_Two","/wiki/Termite_Terrace","/wiki/Warren_Foster","/wiki/Gulliver%27s_Travels","/wiki/Mr._Bug_Goes_to_Town","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Bud_Abbott","/wiki/Abbott_and_Costello","/wiki/Babbit_and_Catstello","/wiki/Wackiki_Wabbit","/wiki/French_language","/wiki/French_Rarebit","/wiki/Hubie_and_Bertie","/wiki/Mel_Blanc","/wiki/Stan_Freberg","/wiki/Looney_Tunes","/wiki/Merrie_Melodies","/wiki/Goofy_Gophers","/wiki/Spike_the_Bulldog_and_Chester_the_Terrier","/wiki/Universal_Studios","/wiki/Abbott_and_Costello","/wiki/The_Ritz_Brothers","/wiki/Maria_Montez","/wiki/Gloria_Jean","/wiki/Donald_O%27Connor","/w/index.php?title=Tedd_Pierce&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","http://dmgermain.blogspot.com/2009/06/pepe-le-pew.html","#cite_ref-2","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Special:BookSources/1556525915","/w/index.php?title=Tedd_Pierce&action=edit&section=2","http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0682481/","/wiki/Internet_Movie_Database","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tedd_Pierce&oldid=545294668","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:American_animators","/wiki/Category:1906_births","/wiki/Category:1972_deaths","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_hCards","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Tedd+Pierce&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Tedd+Pierce","/wiki/Tedd_Pierce","/wiki/Talk:Tedd_Pierce","#","/wiki/Tedd_Pierce","/w/index.php?title=Tedd_Pierce&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Tedd_Pierce&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Tedd_Pierce","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Tedd_Pierce","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Tedd_Pierce&oldid=545294668","/w/index.php?title=Tedd_Pierce&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3517069","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Tedd_Pierce&id=545294668","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Tedd+Pierce","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Tedd+Pierce&oldid=545294668&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Tedd_Pierce&printable=yes","//ar.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D8%AA%D9%8A%D8%AF_%D8%A8%D9%8A%D8%B1%D8%B3","//es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tedd_Pierce","//fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tedd_Pierce","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3517069#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaime
