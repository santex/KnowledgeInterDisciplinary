      "text" : "\nA 'government' or 'state agency', often an appointed 'commission', is a\npermanent or semi-permanent organization in the machinery of government that is\nresponsible for the oversight and administration of specific functions, such as\nan intelligence agency. There is a notable variety of agency types. Although\nusage differs, a government agency is normally distinct both from a department\nor ministry, and other types of public body established by government. The\nfunctions of an agency are normally executive in character, since different\ntypes of organizations (such as commissions) are most often constituted in an\nadvisory roleâ€”this distinction is often blurred in practice however.\n\nA government agency may be established by either a national government or a\nstate government within a federal system. The term is not normally used for an\norganization created by the powers of a local government body. Agencies can be\nestablished by legislation or by executive powers. The autonomy, independence\nand accountability of government agencies also vary widely.\n",
