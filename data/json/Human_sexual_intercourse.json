The term can also describe other sexual\npenetrative acts, such as anal sex, oral sex, fingering, or use of a strap-on\ndildo.

For example, non-penetrative sex (such as non-penetrative\ncunnilingus) has been referred to as \"outercourse\", but may also be among the sexual\nacts contributing to human bonding and considered intercourse. The term sex,\noften a shorthand for sexual intercourse, can be taken to mean any form of\nsexual activity (i.e. all forms of intercourse and outercourse). Because individuals can be at risk of contracting\nsexually transmitted infections during these activities, Also see\n[http://www.cdc.gov/std/stats08/2008survFactSheet.PDF Fact Sheet] although\nthe transmission risk is significantly reduced during non-penetrative sex, safe sex practices are advised.\n\nIn human societies, some jurisdictions have placed various restrictive laws\nagainst certain sexual activities, such as sex with minors, incest, extramarital\nsex, position-of-trust sex, prostitution, sodomy, public lewdness, rape, and\nbestiality. Religious beliefs can play a role in decisions about sex, or its\npurpose, as well; for example, beliefs about what sexual acts constitute\nvirginity loss or the decision to make a virginity pledge. {{cite\njournal|author=Bersamin MM, Walker S, Waiters ED, Fisher DA, Grube\nJW|title=Promising to wait: virginity pledges and adolescent sexual\nbehavior|journal=J Adolesc Health|volume=36|issue=5|pages=428â36|year=2005|mont-\nh=May|pmid=15837347|pmc=1949026 |doi=10.1016/j.jadohealth.2004.09.016|url=http:-\n//linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1054-139X(05)00108-4}} Some\nsections of Christianity commonly view sex between a married couple for the\npurpose of reproduction as holy, while other sections may not.

ISBN 0-8054-2596-9 Modern\nJudaism and Islam view sexual intercourse between husband and wife as a\nspiritual and edifying action. Hinduism and Buddhism views on sexuality have\ndiffering interpretations.\n\nSexual intercourse between non-human animals is more often referred to as\ncopulation; for most non-human animals, mating and copulation occurs at the\npoint of estrus (the most fertile period of time in the female's reproductive\ncycle), \"Females of almost all species except man will mate\nonly during their fertile period, which is known as estrus, or heat...\"\n which increases the chances of successful\nimpregnation. However, bonobos, dolphins, and chimpanzees are known to engage in sexual intercourse\neven when the female is not in estrus, and to engage in sex acts with same-sex\npartners.
