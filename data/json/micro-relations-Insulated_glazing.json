{"cursor":"19997","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Insulated glazing' (IG), more commonly known as 'double glazing' (or 'double-\npane', and increasingly triple glazing/pane) are double or triple glass window\npanes separated by an air or other gas filled space to reduce heat transfer\nacross a part of the building envelope.\n\nInsulated Glass Units (IGU) are manufactured with glass in range of thickness\nfrom 3 mm to 10 mm or more in special applications. Laminated or\ntempered glass may also be used as part of the construction. Most units are\nmanufactured with the same thickness of glass used on both panes but special\napplications such as acoustic attenuation or security may require wide ranges of\nthicknesses to be incorporated in the same unit.\n\n diagram of a fixed Insulated Glazed Unit (IGU), indicating the numbering\n convention used in this article. Surface #1 is facing outside, Surface #2 is\n the inside surface of the exterior pane, Surface #3 is the outside surface of\n the interior pane, and Surface #4 is the inside surface of interior pane. The\n window frame is labelled #5, a spacer is indicated as #6, seals are shown in\n red (#7), the internal reveal is on the right hand side (#8) and the exterior\n windowsill on the left (#9)]]\n\nTo reduce shear effects on the sealed unit (a major cause of premature failure),\nmanufacturers use a rule of thumb that permits a difference of 1 mm between\nthe thickness of the panes of glass used in the unit and still maintain the\nwarranty for the unit. For example, a unit may be ordered with a 4 mm pane\non the exterior and a 3 mm pane on the interior. These variations are\nallowed for architectural and cost reasons. Other combinations can be specified\nand produced but the manufacturer may reserve the right to limit the term of the\nwarranty or refuse to warranty the unit altogether.\n\nFor ease of description the surfaces of a double paned unit are named according\nto the following convention: Surface #1 (facing outside), Surface #2 (inside of\noutside pane), Surface #3 (outside of inside pane) and Surface #4 (inside\nsurface of inside pane). Applying the corresponding nomenclature for triple\npaned units results in surfaces #1 through #6.\n\nThe performance of insulating glazing can be modified through the use of the\nfollowing:\n","linknr":288,"url":"Insulated_glazing","recorded":1362481705,"links":28,"instances":["insulation","mechanics","decorative"],"pdf":["http://www.ktu.lt/ultra/journal/pdf_51_2/51-2004-Vol.2_01-J.Butkus.pdf"],"categories":["Energy conservation","Windows","Building engineering","Building materials","Glass coating and surface modification","Glass applications","Low-energy building","Insulators","Thermal protection","Heat transfer"],"headings":["Spacer","Construction","Thermal performance","Heat insulating properties","Acoustic insulating properties","Longevity","Estimating heat loss from double glazed windows","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5a/Double_Glazed_Fixed_Window_Diagram.png/225px-Double_Glazed_Fixed_Window_Diagram.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/84/Bleekman_zimmer.jpg/225px-Bleekman_zimmer.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/94/Passivhaus_Fenster_Beispiele.png/225px-Passivhaus_Fenster_Beispiele.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["molding","decorative"],["degrees_of_freedom","mechanics"],["r-value","insulation"]],"members":["degrees_of_freedom","molding"],"related":["Glass","Window_pane","Heat_transfer","Building_envelope","Acoustic_attenuation","Molding_(decorative)","Condensation","Thermal_conductivity","Desiccant","Polyisobutylene","Polysulphide","Silicone_sealant","R_factor","Genericized_trademark","Heat_flow","Convection","Heat_conduction","Vacuum","Thermal_insulation","Vacuum_insulated_panel","Noble_gas","Argon","Krypton","Xenon","Degrees_of_freedom_(mechanics)","Heat_capacity","Sulfur_hexafluoride","High-voltage_switchgear","Xenon","R-value_(insulation)","Customary_units","Noise_mitigation","Sound_transmission_class","Sulfur_hexafluoride","Warranty","Curtain_wall","G-value","Glass","Passive_solar_design","Window"]}
