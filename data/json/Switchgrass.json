Switchgrass is one of\nthe dominant species of the central North American tallgrass prairie and can be\nfound in remnant prairies, in native grass pastures, and naturalized along\nroadsides. It is used primarily for soil conservation, forage production, game\ncover, as an ornamental grass, and more recently as a biomass crop for ethanol\nand butanol, in phytoremediation projects, fiber, electricity, and heat\nproduction and for biosequestration of atmospheric carbon dioxide.\n\nOther common names for switchgrass include tall panic grass, Wobsqua grass,\nblackbent, tall prairiegrass, wild redtop, thatchgrass, and Virginia\nswitchgrass.\n","linknr":756,"url":"Switchgrass","recorded":1362500053,"links":58,"instances":["waste","season","agriculture"],"pdf":["http://www.inta.gov.ar/iir/investiga/proyectos/pebiocombustibles.pdf","http://www.inta.gov.ar/iir/investiga/proyectos/pebiocombustibles.pdf","http://reap-canada.com/online_library/feedstock_biomass/5-Establishing%20and%20Managing%20Switchgrass%20as%20an%20Energy%20Crop%20_Parrish%20et%20al.,%202008.pdf","http://nmsp.css.cornell.edu/publications/factsheets/factsheet20.pdf","http://www.reap-canada.com/library/Bioenergy/2007%20SG%20production%20guide-FINAL.pdf","http://www.reap-canada.com/library/Bioenergy/2007%20SG%20production%20guide-FINAL.pdf","http://www.reap-canada.com/online_library/feedstock_biomass/Optimization%20of%20switchgrass%20management%20for%20commercial%20fuel%20pellet%20production%20(Samson%20et%20al.,%202007).pdf","http://arrahman29.files.wordpress.com/2008/02/lca-use.pdf","http://www.reap-canada.com/online_library/feedstock_biomass/15-The%20Potential%20of%20C4%20Perennial%20Grasses%20for%20Developing...%20_Samson%20et%20al.,%202005_.pdf","http://www.cleanfuelsdc.org/pubs/documents/FoodFeedandFuel08.pdf","http://www.cdhowe.org/pdf/commentary_282.pdf","http://www.reap-canada.com/online_library/feedstock_biomass/The%20Emerging%20Agro-Pellet%20Industry%20in%20Canada%20(Samson%20et%20al.,%202007).pdf","http://www.gtmconference.ca/site/downloads/2008presentations/5B3%20-Frigon.pdf","http://www.springerlink.com/content/ap35w2q46420tn4x/fulltext.pdf","http://plants.usda.gov/factsheet/pdf/fs_pavi2.pdf","http://plants.usda.gov/factsheet/pdf/fs_pavi2.pdf","http://www.ext.vt.edu/pubs/forage/418-013/418-013.pdf","http://www.ext.vt.edu/pubs/forage/418-013/418-013.pdf","http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/ncnu02/pdf/duffy-252.pdf","http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/ncnu02/pdf/duffy-252.pdf","http://www.reap-canada.com/online_library/grass_pellets/2007%20SG%20production%20guide-FINAL.pdf","http://www.biomassandbioenergy.nl/filesdwnld/Elbersen,%20Rome%2012-05-2004.pdf","http://www.reap-canada.com/online_library/feedstock_biomass/5-Establishing%20and%20Managing%20Switchgrass%20as%20an%20Energy%20Crop%20_Parrish%20et%20al.,%202008.pdf","http://www.reap-canada.com/online_library/feedstock_biomass/Optimization%20of%20switchgrass%20management%20for%20commercial%20fuel%20pellet%20production%20(Samson%20et%20al.,%202007).pdf","http://www.extension.iastate.edu/Publications/PM1710.pdf","http://www.switchgrass.nl/pdf/Sw-FinalRep-chapter5.pdf","http://www.pa.nrcs.usda.gov/FTPPublications/warmseasongrasses04.pdf","http://www.bladeenergy.com/Bladepdf/Blade_Switchgrass_Crop_Guide_2009.pdf"],"categories":["Flora
