{"cursor":"3287","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\nAn 'umbrella term' is a term used to cover a broad number of functions or items\nthat all fall under a single common category. Umbrella term is also called a\nhypernym. For example, [[cryptology]] is an umbrella term that encompasses\ncryptography and cryptanalysis, among other fields. Similarly, an umbrella\norganization is a central and coordinating body representing a number of\nsmaller, separate bodies.\n\nThe closely related 'blanket term' is a word or phrase that is used to describe\nmultiple groups of related things. The degree of relation may vary, even have a\nminimal relationship, but blanket terms often trade specificity for ease-of-use;\nin other words, a blanket term by itself gives little detail about the things\nthat it describes or the relationships between them, but is easy to say and\nremember. Blanket terms may originate as slang, and eventually become integrated\ninto the general vocabulary.\n","linknr":153,"url":"Umbrella_term","recorded":1362666769,"links":22,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Vocabulary"],"headings":["Examples of umbrella terms","Examples of blanket terms","Other umbrella terms","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Hypernym","Cryptography","Cryptanalysis","Umbrella_organization","Morpheme","Phrase","Slang","Grave_goods","Venus_figurines","Votive_deposit","Standing_stone","Punctuated_equilibrium","Evolution","Speciation","Gradualism","Straw_man","Psychokinesis","Psychosis","Daltonism","Intellectual_property","Sick_sinus_syndrome","Whites","Asian_people","Black_people","Germanic_peoples","Iranian_peoples","Slav","Bantu_languages","Personal_computer","IBM_PC","IBM_PC_compatible","Computer","X86","IPod","MP3_player","R&B","Pop_music","Ballad","Hip_hop","Funk","Motown","Umbrella_brand","Umbrella_fund","Umbrella_organization","Umbrella_school","Blanket_terminology","Collective_noun","Family_resemblance","Generic_antecedents"]}
