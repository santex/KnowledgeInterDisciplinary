{"cursor":"42696","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Fishing techniques' are methods for catching fish. The term may also be applied\nto methods for catching other aquatic animals such as molluscs (shellfish,\nsquid, octopus) and edible marine invertebrates.\n\nFishing techniques include hand gathering, spearfishing, netting, angling and\ntrapping. Recreational, commercial and artisanal fishers use different\ntechniques, and also, sometimes, the same techniques. Recreational fishers fish\nfor pleasure or sport, while commercial fishers fish for profit. Artisanal\nfishers use traditional, low-tech methods, for survival in third-world\ncountries, and as a cultural heritage in other countries. Mostly, recreational\nfishers use angling methods and commercial fishers use netting methods.\n\nThere is an intricate link between various fishing techniques and knowledge\nabout the fish and their behaviour including migration, foraging and habitat.\nThe effective use of fishing techniques often depends on this additional\nknowledge. Keegan, William F (1986) [http://www.arqueologiamendoza.com/wiki-\nsrc/images/b/b5/The_Optimal_Foraging_Analysis_of_Horticultural_Production.pdf.\nThe Optimal Foraging Analysis of Horticultural Production] American\nAnthropologist, New Series, Vol. 88, No. 1., pp. 92-107. Which techniques\nare appropriate is dictated mainly by the target species and by its habitat.\n\nFishing techniques can be contrasted with fishing tackle. Fishing tackle refers\nto the physical equipment that is used when fishing, whereas fishing techniques\nrefers to the manner in which the tackle is used when fishing.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Fishing_techniques","recorded":1372152437,"links":[],"instances":["fish","island","state","cameroon_and_gabon","angling","fishing","weapon","weapon","fishing","fishing"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Fishing
