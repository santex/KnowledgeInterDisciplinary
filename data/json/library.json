defined community for\nreference or borrowing. It provides physical or digital access to material, and\nmay be a physical building or room, or a virtual space, or both.<ref>\"Library\n... collection of books, public or private; room or building where these are\nkept; similar collection of films, records, computer routines, etc. or place\nwhere they are kept; series of books issued in similar bindings as set.\"--Allen,\nR. E., ed. (1984) The Pocket Oxford Dictionary of Current English. Oxford:\nClarendon Press; p. 421</ref> A library's collection can include books,\nperiodicals, newspapers, manuscripts, films, maps, prints, documents, microform,\nCDs, cassettes, videotapes, DVDs, Blu-ray Discs, e-books, audiobooks, databases,\nand other formats. Libraries range in size from a few shelves of books to\nseveral million items. In Latin and Greek, the idea of bookcase is represented\nby Bibliotheca and Bibliothēkē (Greek: βιβλιοθήκη): derivatives of these mean\nlibrary in many modern languages, e.g. French bibliothèque.\n\nThe first libraries consisted of archives of the earliest form of writing - the\nclay tablets in cuneiform script discovered in Sumer, some dating back to 2600\nBC. These written archives mark the end of prehistory and the start of history.\nThe earliest discovered private archives were kept at Ugarit. There is also\nevidence of libraries at Nippur about 1900 BC and at Nineveh about 700 BC\nshowing a library classification system. Private or personal libraries made up\nof written books (as opposed to the state or institutional records kept in\narchives) appeared in classical Greece in the 5th century BC. In the 6th\ncentury, at the very close of the Classical period, the great libraries of the\nMediterranean world remained those of Constantinople and Alexandria. From the\n15th century in central and northern Italy, libraries of humanists and their\nenlightened patrons provided a nucleus around which an \"academy\" of scholars\ncongregated in each Italian city of consequence. Tianyi Chamber, founded in 1561\nby Fan Qin during the Ming Dynasty, is the oldest existing library in China. In\nits heyday it boasted a collection of 70,000 volumes of antique books. The first\nlibrary classification system was set up during the Han Dynasty. In North\nAmerica, it is believed that personal collections of books were brought over to\nthe continent by French settlers in the 16th century. The oldest non-personal\nlibrary on the North American continent was founded at The Jesuit College in\nQuebec City in 1635. The first textbook on library science was published 1808 by\nMartin Schrettinger.<ref>Martin Schrettinger (1803): Versuch eines volltsändigen\nLehrbuches der Bibliothek-Wissenschaft. Munich</ref>\n\nA library is organized for use and maintained by a public body, an institution,\na corporation, or a private individual. Public and institutional collections and\nservices may be intended for use by people who choose not to&nbsp;— or cannot\nafford to&nbsp;— purchase an extensive collection themselves, who need material\nno individual can reasonably be expected to have, or who require professional\nassistance with their research. In addition to providing materials, libraries\nalso provide the services of librarians who are experts at finding and\norganizing information and at interpreting information needs. Libraries often\nprovide quiet areas for studying, and they also often offer common areas to\nfacilitate group study and collaboration. Libraries often provide public\nfacilities for access to their electronic resources and the Internet. Modern\nlibraries are increasingly being redefined as places to get unrestricted access\nto information in many formats and from many sources. They are extending\nservices beyond the physical walls of a building, by providing material\naccessible by electronic means, and by providing the assistance of librarians in\nnavigating and analyzing very large amounts of information with a variety of\ndigital tools.\n","title":"library","headings":["History","Types","Organization","Buildings","Usage","Associations","Laws","Islam","See
