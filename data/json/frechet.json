He made major contributions to the topology of point sets and\nintroduced the entire concept of metric spaces. He also made several important\ncontributions to the field of statistics and probability, as well as calculus.\nHis dissertation opened the entire field of functionals on metric spaces and\nintroduced the notion of compactness. Independently of Riesz, he discovered the\nrepresentation theorem in the space of Lebesgue square integrable functions.\n","title":"Maurice%20Ren%C3%A9%20Fr%C3%A9chet","headings":["Biography","Main works","See also","Notes","External links"]},"micro-relation":["3: Maligny,_Yonne","3: Ãcole_Normale_SupÃ©rieure","3: Metric_space","2: University_of_Bordeaux","2: University_of_Strasbourg","2: Jacques_Hadamard","2: Functional_analysis","1: Ãcole_des_Hautes-Ãtudes","1: Nachman_Aronszajn","1: Robert_Fortet","1: Äuro_Kurepa","1: Ky_Fan","1: Jean_Ville","1: Topology","1: Probability","1: Calculus","1: Metric_spaces","1: Compactness","1: Riesz","1: Lebesgue","1: Protestant","1: French_Third_Republic","1: LycÃ©e_Buffon","1: American_Mathematical_Society","1: Edwin_Bidwell_Wilson","1: BesanÃ§on","1: Nantes","1: Poitiers","1: University_of_Illinois_at_Urbana-Champaign","1: First_World_War","1: British_Army","1: Strasbourg","1: Ãmile_Borel","1: Academy_of_Sciences","1: Esperantist","1: Felix_Hausdorff","1: Group_theory","1: Geographer","1: Demographer","1: JaromÃ­r_KorÄÃ¡k","1: FrÃ©chet_space","1: FrÃ©chetâUrysohn_space","1: FrÃ©chet_derivative","1: Differentiation_in_FrÃ©chet_spaces","1: Topological_space","1: FrÃ©chet_distribution","1: FrÃ©chet_mean","1: FrÃ©chet_distance","1: FrÃ©chet_filter","1: FrÃ©chet_inequalities"]}
