{"cursor":"18555","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Coding theory' is the study of the properties of codes and their fitness for a\nspecific application. Codes are used for data compression, cryptography, error-\ncorrection and more recently also for network coding. Codes are studied by\nvarious scientific disciplinesâsuch as information theory, electrical\nengineering, mathematics, and computer scienceâfor the purpose of designing\nefficient and reliable data transmission methods. This typically involves the\nremoval of redundancy and the correction (or detection) of errors in the\ntransmitted data.\n\nThere are essentially two aspects to Coding theory:\n#   Data compression (or, source coding) Error correction (or, [[channel\n#   coding]]).\n\nThese two aspects may be studied in combination. Source encoding attempts to\ncompress the data from a source in order to transmit it more efficiently. This\npractice is found every day on the Internet where the common Zip data\ncompression is used to reduce the network load and make files smaller. The\nsecond, channel encoding, adds extra data bits to make the transmission of\ndata more robust to disturbances present on the transmission channel. The\nordinary user may not be aware of many applications using channel coding. A\ntypical music CD uses the Reed-Solomon code to correct for scratches and dust.\nIn this application the transmission channel is the CD itself. Cell phones\nalso use coding techniques to correct for the fading and noise of high\nfrequency radio transmission. Data modems, telephone transmissions, and NASA\nall employ channel coding techniques to get the bits through, for example the\nturbo code and LDPC codes.\n","linknr":308,"url":"Coding_theory","recorded":1362896638,"links":38,"instances":["file_format","dpc","information_theory","waves","physiology"],"pdf":["http://www.hooklee.com/Papers/IEEETCASI2008.pdf","http://pop.cerco.ups-tlse.fr/fr_vers/documents/thorpe_sj_90_91.pdf","http://www.digitalsignallabs.com/tutorial.pdf"],"categories":["Coding theory|","Error detection and correction"],"headings":["Source coding","Channel coding","Other applications of coding theory","Neural coding","See also","Notes","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/Crystal_Clear_app_kedit.svg/40px-Crystal_Clear_app_kedit.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/Merge-arrow.svg/50px-Merge-arrow.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["zip","file_format"],["entropy","information_theory"],["phase","waves"],["stimulus","physiology"],["dirty_paper_coding","dpc"]],"members":["zip","dirty_paper_coding","entropy","phase","stimulus"],"related":["Code","Data_compression","Cryptography","Error-correction","Network_coding","Information_theory","Electrical_engineering","Mathematics","Computer_science","Data_transmission","Error-correction_code","Joint_source_and_channel_coding","Zip_(file_format)","NASA","Turbo_code","LDPC_code","Entropy_(information_theory)","Entropy_encoding","FAX","Run-length_encoding","Code_word","Error_detection","Thermal_noise","Distance","Hamming_distance","Lee_distance","Linearity","Cyclic_code","Hamming_code","Repetition_code","Parity_bit","Polynomial_code","BCH_code","Reed-Solomon_error_correction","Algebraic_geometric_code","Reed–Muller_code","Hamming_bound","Sphere_packing","Binary_Golay_code","Dave_Forney","IEEE","Shaping_codes","Convolution","Linear_time_invariant","Viterbi_algorithm","Synchronization","Phase_(waves)","Code-division_multiple_access","Automatic_repeat-request","Wide_area_network","Synchronous_Data_Link_Control","Transmission_Control_Protocol","X.25","Group_testing","Second_World_War","United_States_Army_Air_Forces","Syphilis","Robert_Dorfman","Neural_network","Brain","Analog_signal_processing","Analog_electronics","Neural_coding","Neuroscience","Brain","Neural_network","Neurons","Stimulus_(physiology)","Digital","Analog_signal","Coding_gain","Covering_code","Error-correcting_code","Group_testing","Hamming_distance","Hamming_weight","Information_theory","Lee_distance","MIMO","Multiple_antenna_research","Space–time_code","Dirty_paper_coding_(DPC)","Spatial_multiplexing","Timeline_of_information_theory","List_of_algebraic_coding_theory_topics","Folded_Reed–Solomon_codes","ABNNR_and_AEL_codes","Vera_Pless","Elwyn_R._Berlekamp"]}
