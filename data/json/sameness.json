The sociological notion of identity, by\ncontrast, has to do with a person's self-conception, social presentation, and\nmore generally, the aspects of a person that make them unique, or qualitatively\ndifferent from others (e.g. cultural identity, gender identity, national\nIdentity, online identity and processes of identity formation.)\n",
