{"cursor":"1756","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nThe Crick, Brenner, Barnett, Watts-Tobin experiment of 1961 was a scientific\nexperiment performed in 1961 by Francis Crick, Sydney Brenner, Leslie Barnett\nand R.J. Watts-Tobin. They demonstrated that three bases of DNA code for one\namino acid in the genetic code. The experiment elucidated the nature of gene\nexpression and frame-shift mutations.\n\nIn the experiment, proflavin-induced mutations of the T4 bacteriophage gene,\nrIIB, were isolated. Proflavin causes mutations by inserting itself between DNA\nbases, typically resulting in insertion or deletion of a single base pair.\n\nThe mutants produced by Crick and Brenner could not produce functional rIIB\nprotein because the insertion or deletion of a single nucleotide caused a\nframeshift mutation. Mutants with two or four nucleotides inserted or deleted\nwere also nonfunctional. However, the mutant strains could be made functional\nagain by using proflavin to insert or delete a total of three nucleotides. This\nproved that the genetic code uses a codon of three DNA bases that corresponds to\nan amino acid.\n","linknr":240,"url":"Crick,_Brenner_et_al._experiment","recorded":1362483929,"links":17,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Genetics experiments|Crick, Brenner et al. experiment, The","1961 in science"],"headings":["References","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/HomunculusLarge.png/60px-HomunculusLarge.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/AlphaHelixSection.svg/40px-AlphaHelixSection.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Scientific_experiment","Francis_Crick","Sydney_Brenner","Leslie_Barnett","Genetic_code","Gene_expression","Frame-shift_mutation","Proflavin","Mutation","T4_phage","Bacteriophage","Frameshift_mutation","Codon","Amino_acid","Nirenberg_and_Leder_experiment","Nirenberg_and_Matthaei_experiment"]}
