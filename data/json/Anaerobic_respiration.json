{"cursor":"8271","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Anaerobic respiration' is a form of respiration using electron acceptors other\nthan oxygen. Although oxygen is not used as the final electron acceptor, the\nprocess still uses a respiratory electron transport chain; it is respiration\nwithout oxygen. In order for the electron transport chain to function, an\nexogenous final electron acceptor must be present to allow electrons to pass\nthrough the system. In aerobic organisms, this final electron acceptor is\noxygen. Molecular oxygen is a highly oxidizing agent and, therefore, is an\nexcellent acceptor. In anaerobes, other less-oxidizing substances such as\nsulfate (SO 42- ), nitrate (NO 3- ),\nsulfur (S), or fumarate are used. These terminal electron acceptors have smaller\nreduction potentials than O 2, meaning that less energy is released\nper oxidized molecule. Anaerobic respiration is, therefore, in general\nenergetically less efficient than aerobic respiration.\n\nAnaerobic respiration is used mainly by prokaryotes that live in environments\ndevoid of oxygen. Many anaerobic organisms are obligate anaerobes, meaning\nthat they can respire only using anaerobic compounds and will die in the\npresence of oxygen.\n","linknr":388,"url":"Anaerobic_respiration","recorded":1362555671,"links":38,"instances":["biochemistry","data_page"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Anaerobic digestion","Biodegradation","Cellular respiration"],"headings":["Anaerobic respiration as compared to fermentation","Ecological importance","Economic relevance","Examples of respiration","See also","References","Bibliography"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/50/Metabolism_790px_partly_labeled.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b4/Gtk-dialog-info.svg/15px-Gtk-dialog-info.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/Metabolism_790px.png/50px-Metabolism_790px.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["fermentation","biochemistry"],["standard_electrode_potential","data_page"]],"members":["fermentation","standard_electrode_potential"],"related":["Cellular_respiration","Electron_transport_chain","Cellular_respiration","Fumarate","Electron_acceptor","Reduction_potential","Prokaryotes","Anaerobic_organisms","Obligate_anaerobe","Aerobic_respiration","NADH","FADH2","Glycolysis","Citric_acid_cycle","Electrochemical_gradient","Electrical_potential","Concentration","Integral_membrane_proteins","Reduction_potential","Oxygen","Aerobic_respiration","Inner_mitochondrial_membrane","Eukaryotes","Cell_membrane","Prokaryotes","Proton_motive_force","Protons","ATP_synthase","Adenosine_diphosphate","Fermentation_(biochemistry)","Substrate-level_phosphorylation","NAD+","NADH","Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate","Pyruvate","Lactic_acid","Yeast","Acetaldehyde","Ethanol","Nitrogen_cycle","Sulfur_cycle","Carbon_cycle","Denitrification","Nitrogen_fixation","Hydrogen_sulfide","Neurotoxin","Sulfide_minerals","Nitrate","Nitrite","Eutrophication","Methanogenesis","Methane","Anaerobic_digestion","Greenhouse_gas","Bioremediation","Arsenate","Selenate","Reduction_potential","Cellular_respiration","Eukaryotes","Aerobic_organism","Prokaryotes","Iron","Manganese","Cobalt","Uranium","Denitrification","Fumarate_reductase","Fumarate","Succinate","Sulfate-reducing_bacteria","Methanogenesis","Methanogens","Sulfur-reducing_bacteria","Acetogenesis","Acetogens","Acetate","Dehalorespiration","Halocarbon","Standard_electrode_potential_(data_page)","Table_of_standard_reduction_potentials_for_half-reactions_important_in_biochemistry"]}
