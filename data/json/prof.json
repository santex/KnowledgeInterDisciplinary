Literally, professor derives from Latin as a \"person who professes\"\nbeing usually an expert in arts or sciences, a teacher of high rank.<ref></ref>\nIn much of the world, including most Commonwealth nations (such as the United\nKingdom, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa) and northern Europe professor is\nreserved only for the most senior academics at a university, typically a\ndepartment chair, or an awarded chair specifically bestowed recognizing an\nindividuaI at a university or similar institution. A professor is a highly\naccomplished and recognized academic, and the title is in most cases awarded\nonly after decades of scholarly work to senior academics. In the United States\nand Canada the title of professor is granted to most scholars with doctorate\ndegrees or equivalent qualifications (typically Ph.D.s) who teach in two- and\nfour-year colleges and universities, and is used in the titles assistant\nprofessor and associate professor, which are not considered professor-level\npositions elsewhere, as well as for full professors.\n\nIn countries on the northern European mainland, such as the Netherlands and the\nScandinavian countries, usage of professor as a legal title is limited much the\nsame way as in most Commonwealth countries, that is, it is reserved for someone\nwho holds a chair. In the United States, \"professor\" as a proper noun generally\nimplies a person with a Ph.D. who holds a permanent position at the college or\nuniversity level, regardless of rank.\n\nIn Portugal, France, Italy, Romania and Latin America (Spanish- and Portuguese-\nspeaking), the term professor (profesor / professore / professor / professeur /\nprofesor) is used for anyone teaching at a school, institute, technical school,\nvocational school, college, or university, regardless of the level of the\nsubject matter taught or the level or ages of students. This includes\ninstructors at the grade/elementary school, middle school, and high school\nlevels. However, when the professor teaches at a university, they are\nspecifically called a \"university professor\"; if holding a chair, then\ncatedrático is used in Spanish. It is common to call university professors just\n\"profesor\" (Spanish) or \"professor\" (Portuguese).\n\nIn Italy, primary school teachers are called \"maestro\"(m) or \"maestra\"(f).\nTeachers in secondary schools scuole secondarie are called \"professore\"(m) or\n\"professoressa\"(f); the same title is used for university professors.\n\nIn Spain, the term professor (Galician and Spanish: (m) professor, (f)\nprofesora; Aranese and Catalan: (m) professor, (f) professora) is used for higher-\nlevel teachers at the secondary education level (high school, lyceum, institute,\netc.) and above (i.e. institute, technical school, vocational school, college,\nor university). Instructors at the primary or elementary school level are called\nteachers (Aranese: (m) mèstre, (f) mèstra; Basque: (m) (f) irakasle; Catalan and\nGalician: (m) mestre, (f) mestra; Spanish: (m) maestro, (f) maestra). When the\nprofessor teaches at a university, they are specifically called a \"university\nprofessor\"; if holding a chair, then chair (Aranese: catedratic; ; ; Galician\nand ) is used. In Spain, it is not common to call university professors just\n\"professor\".\n\nIn Poland, the term profesor means professor extraordinarius and professor\nordinarius at colleges and universities. Traditionally it has been applied to\nanyone who teaches at a (grades 10-12).\n\nBeyond holding the proper academic title, universities in many countries also\nappend famous artists, athletes and foreign dignitaries with the title 'honorary\nprofessor', even if these persons don't have the academic qualifications\ntypically necessary for professorship. However, such \"professors\" usually do not\nundertake academic work for the granting institution.\n","title":"Professor","headings":["Tasks","Tenure","Around the world","Historical Islamic usage","Salary","In fiction","See also","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["8: PhD","5: Habilitation","5: Docent","5: Candidate_of_Sciences","4: Galician_language","3: University","3: Aranese","3: Catalan_language","3: Poland","3: Emeritus","2: Commonwealth_of_Nations","2: United_Kingdom","2: United_States","2: Canada","2: Technical_school","2: Vocational_school","2: College","2: Elementary_school","2: Spanish_language","2: Basque_language","2: Medicine","2: Law","2: Academic_freedom","2: Lecturer","2: Austria","2: Master's_degree","1: Teacher","1: Latin","1: Expert","1: Australia","1: New_Zealand","1: South_Africa","1: Academic","1: Netherlands","1: Scandinavia","1: Portugal","1: France","1: Romania","1: Latin_America","1: Middle_school","1: High_school","1: Italy","1: Spain","1: Lecture","1: Seminar","1: Mathematics","1: Science","1: Humanities","1: Social_sciences","1: Education","1: Literature","1: Music","1: Engineering","1: Design","1: Business","1: Research","1: Pro_bono","1: Community_service","1: On-line","1: Instructional_technology","1: Graduate_students","1: Librarian","1: Politicization_of_science","1: Lee_Smolin","1: String_theory","1: Higher_education","1: Higher_education_in_Canada","1: Junior_college","1: Tenure","1: Up_or_out","1: Academic_rank_in_the_United_States#Academic_administrators","1: Chairman","1: Liberal_arts_college","1: Research_funding","1: Republic_of_Ireland","1: Senior_lecturer","1: University_of_Oxford","1: Title_of_Distinction","1: University_of_Birmingham","1: University_of_Exeter","1: University_of_Warwick","1: Doctor_of_Philosophy","1: Regius_Professorships","1: Lucasian_Professor_of_Mathematics","1: Music_school","1: British_Academy_of_Fencing","1: Academic_rank#Brazil","1: Academic_rank#Portugal","1: Portuguese_language","1: Jan_Å vejnar","1: Josef_KouteckÃ½","1: Licentiate","1: Doctorate","1: Economics","1: AgrÃ©gation#Higher_education","1: Ãcole_polytechnique","1: Universities_in_France","1: University_hospital","1: Observatory","1: Ãcole_des_hautes_Ã©tudes_en_sciences_sociales","1: Ãcole_pratique_des_hautes_Ã©tudes","1: Ãcole_des_chartes","1: Ãcole_franÃ§aise_d'ExtrÃªme-Orient","1: Germany","1: Switzerland","1: Slovakia","1: Hungary","1: Slovenia","1: Academic_degree","1: Tenure_track","1: Donald_Knuth","1: Privatdozent","1: Finland","1: Sweden","1: President_of_Hungary","1: ELTE","1: Prime_Minister_of_Hungary","1: All_but_dissertation","1: The_University_of_Iceland","1: Government_Degree_Colleges,_India","1: All_India_Institute_of_Medical_Sciences","1: Paul_Ehrenfest","1: Permatemp","1: Royal_Netherlands_Academy_of_Arts_and_Sciences","1: Amanuensis","1: Higher_doctorate","1: King_of_Norway","1: King-in-Council","1: Clinical_medicine","1: Ph.D.","1: Full-professor","1: All_But_Dissertation","1: Academic_rank_in_Sweden","1: Professor#Non-tenure-track_positions","1: Lecturer#United_States","1: Doctoral_thesis","1: Islamic_Golden_Age","1: Caliph","1: Arabic_language","1: Madrasah","1: Ibn_'Aqil","1: Baghdad","1: Mosque","1: Barmakid","1: Kalam","1: Sharia","1: Ibn_al-Kattani","1: Islam","1: Study_circle","1: FatwÄ","1: University_of_Zurich","1: ETH_Zurich","1: Cantons_of_Switzerland","1: The_Final_Problem","1: Stereotype","1: Professor_Calculus","1: The_Adventures_of_Tintin","1: Ernst_Stavro_Blofeld","1: James_Bond","1: Professor_Moriarty","1: Archenemy","1: Sherlock_Holmes","1: Professor_Hubert_Farnsworth","1: Mad_scientist","1: Vladimir_Nabokov","1: English_studies","1: Cornell_University","1: Protagonist","1: Harry_Potter","1: Psychologist","1: Christopher_Lloyd","1: Indiana_Jones","1: Archeologist","1: Adventurer","1: Castaway","1: John_Houseman","1: Epitome","1: Stage_name","1: Chitty_Chitty_Bang_Bang","1: C.S._Lewis","1: Chronicles_of_Narnia","1: Comedian","1: Irwin_Corey","1: Soupy_Sales","1: Pianist","1: Western_saloon","1: Puppeteer","1: Punch_and_judy","1: Academic_discipline","1: Doctor_of_Sacred_Theology","1: Doctor_of_Divinity","1: Scholarly_method","1: School_and_university_in_literature"]}
