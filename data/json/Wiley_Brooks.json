{"cursor":"29454","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Inedia' (Latin: \"fasting\") is the alleged ability to live without food. The\nword was first used to describe a fast-based lifestyle within Catholic\ntradition, which holds that certain saints were able to survive for extended\nperiods of time without food or drink other than the Eucharist.\n\n'Breatharianism' is a related concept, in which believers claim food and\npossibly water are not necessary, and that humans can be sustained solely by\nprana (the vital life force in Hinduism), or, according to some, by the energy\nin sunlight (according to Ayurveda, sunlight is one of the main sources of\nprana). The terms breatharianism or inedia may also refer to this philosophy\npractised as a lifestyle in place of the usual diet.\n\nThe consensus of the scientific community is that \"breatharianism\" is\npotentially lethal pseudoscience, and indeed several adherents of these\npractices have died from starvation. {{cite news\n| title = UK: Scotland Woman 'starved herself to death' url =\n| http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/453661.stm publisher = BBC date =\n| 21 September 1999 accessdate =10 March 2008\n}} {{cite web\n| title = Three deaths linked to 'living on air' cult url = publisher = Sunday\n| Times (London) date = 26 September 1999 author = Tom Walker, Judith O'Reilly\n}} {{cite web |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/health/swiss-women-dies-giving-\nwater-food-thought-live-sunlight-article-1.1067359 |title=Swiss woman dies after\nattempting to live on sunlight; Woman gave up food and water on spiritual\njourney |date=25 April 2012 |publisher=Associated Press }}\n","linknr":521,"url":"Wiley_Brooks","recorded":1362584638,"links":26,"instances":["medicine","theosophy","sociology","nutrition","mediumistic"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Diets","Asceticism","Eating behaviors","Pseudoscience"],"headings":["Scientific basis","Practitioners","Religious traditions","In popular culture","See also","References","External links",""],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["lifestyle","sociology"],["diet","nutrition"],["stress","medicine"],["channelling","mediumistic"],["st._germain","theosophy"]],"members":["stress","lifestyle","diet","channelling"],"related":["Fasting","Food","Saint","Eucharist","Water","Prana","Hinduism","Sunlight","Ayurveda","Prana","Lifestyle_(sociology)","Diet_(nutrition)","Pseudoscience","Associated_Press","Nutrition","Starvation","Dehydration","Prahlad_Jani","Associated_Press","Indian_Rationalist_Association","Ram_Bahadur_Bomjon","Jasmuheen","Australia","Stress_(medicine)","Pollution","Bent_Spoon_Award","Australian_Skeptics","Ig_Nobel_Prize","Channelling_(mediumistic)","St._Germain_(Theosophy)","DNA","Jim_Vadim_Pesnak","Darwin_Award","Physical_body","Subtle_body","Santa_Cruz,_California","7-Eleven","Slurpee","Hot_dog","Twinkie","Cheeseburger","Cola","Junk_food","McDonald's","Diet_Coke","Wire_transfer","Billionaire","Hira_Ratan_Manek","Tea","Coffee","Buttermilk","Sungazing","Jainism","Tirthankara","Mahavira","Ancient_Egypt","Ancient_Greece","Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas","Kozhikode","Ahmedabad","Indian_Medical_Association","Philadelphia,_Pennsylvania","Thomas_Jefferson_University","University_of_Pennsylvania","Prahlad_Jani","Sadhu","Ahmedabad","Gujarat","Urine","Feces","Dialysis","CCTV","Sanal_Edamaruku","Indian_Rationalist_Association","Catholic_Church","Eastern_Orthodox_Church","Saint","Jesus","Eucharist","Alpais","Cudot","Catherine_of_Siena","Elisabeth_the_Good","Helen_Enselmini","Lydwina_of_Schiedam","Louise_Lateau","Mariana_de_Jesús_de_Paredes","Marthe_Robin","Nicholas_of_Flue","Pio_of_Pietrelcina","Therese_Neumann","Alexandrina_Maria_da_Costa","Mary_of_Egypt","Theoctiste_of_Lesbos","Ram_Bahadur_Bomjon","Ramayana","Rama","Śarabhanga","Māṇḍakarṇi","Paramahansa_Yogananda","Giri_Bala","Therese_Neumann","Devraha_Baba","Jay_Kinney","Underground_comics","McDonald’s","Scratch_and_sniff","Fasting_girls","Sungazing","Johnny_Lovewisdom"]}
