      "text" : "\n\n'Cruciferous vegetables' are vegetables of the family Brassicaceae (also called\nCruciferae). These vegetables are widely cultivated, with many genera, species,\nand cultivars being raised for food production such as cauliflower, cabbage,\ncress, bok choy, broccoli and similar green leaf vegetables. The family takes\nits alternate name (Cruciferae, New Latin for \"cross-bearing\") from the shape of\ntheir flowers, whose four petals resemble a cross.\n\nTen of the most common cruciferous vegetables eaten by people are in a single\nspecies ([[Brassica oleracea|B. oleracea]]), and are not distinguished from one\nanother taxonomically, but only by the horticultural category of cultivar\ngroups. Numerous other genera and species in the family are also edible.\nCruciferous vegetables are one of the dominant food crops worldwide. Widely\nconsidered to be healthy foods, they are high in vitamin C and soluble fiber and\ncontain multiple nutrients and phytochemicals.\n",
