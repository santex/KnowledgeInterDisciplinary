Sake is sometimes called \"rice\nwine\" but the brewing process is more as rice beer, converting starch to sugar\nfor the fermentation process.\n\nIn the Japanese language, the word \"sake\" generally refers to any alcoholic\ndrink, while the beverage called \"sake\" in English is usually termed nihonshu\n(日本酒, \"Japanese liquor\"). Under Japanese liquor laws, sake is labelled with the\nword \"seishu\" (清酒, \"clear liquor\"), a synonym less commonly used colloquially.\n",
