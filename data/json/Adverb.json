Adverbs are traditionally regarded as one of the parts of speech,\nalthough the wide variety of the functions performed by words classed as adverbs\nmeans that it is hard to treat them as a single uniform category.\n\nAdverbs typically answer questions such as how?, in what way?, when?, where?,\nand to what extent?. This function is called the adverbial function, and is\nrealized not just by single words (i.e., adverbs) but by adverbial phrases and\nadverbial clauses.\n","linknr":364,"url":"Adverb","recorded":1362891144,"links":82,"instances":["grammar","linguistics","linguistics","linguistics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Parts of speech"],"headings":["Uses","Adverbs as a \"catch-all\" category","Adverbs in specific languages","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["sentence","linguistics"],["determiner","linguistics"],["comparison","grammar"],["nominal","linguistics"]],"members":["comparison","sentence","nominal","determiner"],"related":["Verb","Adjective","Clause","Sentence_(linguistics)","Adjective","Determiner_(linguistics)","Noun","Part_of_speech","Adverbial","Adverbial_phrase","Adverbial_clause","English_language","French_language","Comparison_(grammar)","Comparative","Superlative","Inflection","Closed_class_word","Rodney_Huddleston","Cambridge_University_Press","English_language","Dutch_language","Adjective","German_language","Scandinavian_languages","Periphrastic","Romance_languages","Portuguese_language","Spanish_language","Galician_language","Italian_language","French_language","Catalan_language","Latin","Romanian_language","Interlingua","Esperanto","Special_Esperanto_adverbs","Hungarian_Language","Modern_Standard_Arabic","Cognate_accusative","Austronesian_languages","Comparative","Wiki","Japanese_language","Nominal_(linguistics)","Irish_language","Irish_language","Scottish_Gaelic","Portuguese_language","Interlingua","Modern_Greek","Latvian_language","Ukrainian_Language","Russian_language","Slavic_languages","Korean_language","Turkish_language","Chinese_language","Grammatical_conjunction","Prepositional_adverb","Pronominal_adverb"]}
