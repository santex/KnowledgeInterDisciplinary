MAPKs are involved in directing cellular responses to\na diverse array of stimuli, such as mitogens, osmotic stress, heat shock and\nproinflammatory cytokines. They regulate proliferation, gene expression,\ndifferentiation, mitosis, cell survival, and apoptosis - among many others. MAP kinases are found in eukaryotes only, but they\nare fairly diverse and encountered in all animals, fungi and plants, and even in\nan array of unicellular eukaryotes.\n","linknr":1112,"url":"MAPK_cascade","recorded":1362544235,"links":25,"instances":["biology","gene"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Protein kinases","Signal transduction","EC 2.7.11","Aging-related enzymes","Anti-aging substances"],"headings":["Discovery","Types","Activation","Signalling cascades","Evolutionary relationships","Substrate and partner recognition","Scaffold proteins","As therapeutic targets","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/ERK2-phosphorylated.png/220px-ERK2-phosphorylated.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a7/Raf-activation-cycle-sketch.png/220px-Raf-activation-cycle-sketch.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/MAPK-pathway-mammalian.png/220px-MAPK-pathway-mammalian.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/de/MAPK-pathway-yeast.png/220px-MAPK-pathway-yeast.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/D-motif-overview.png/220px-D-motif-overview.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["braf","gene"],["enzyme_substrate","biology"]],"members":["enzyme_substrate","braf"],"related":["Serine/threonine-specific_protein_kinase","Cyclin-dependent_kinase","Mitogen","Osmotic_stress","Heat_shock","Proinflammatory_cytokine","Gene_expression","Cellular_differentiation","Mitosis","Apoptosis","Eukaryote","ERK1","ERK2","Misnomer","Phosphorylation","MAPK3","MAPK1","ERK5","JNK","P38_mitogen-activated_protein_kinases","Threonine","Tyrosine","Mitogen-activated_protein_kinase_kinase","Mitogen-activated_protein_kinase_kinase_kinase","MAP_kinase_kinase_kinase","MAPK6","ERK4","P21_activated_kinase","NLK","MAPK15","Phosphatase","MAP_kinase_phosphatase","Dual-specificity_phosphatase","Tyrosine_phosphatase","PTPN7","PTPN5","PTPRR","Mitogen-activated_protein_kinase_kinase","Mitogen-activated_protein_kinase_kinase_kinase","C-Raf","MEKK4","MLK3","Ras_subfamily","C-Raf","GADD45","MAP3K4","CDC42","MAP3K11","Small_GTPase","Prenylation","Extracellular_signal-regulated_kinases","ARAF","BRAF_(gene)","C-Raf","Epidermal_growth_factor","Fibroblast_growth_factor","PDGF","MAP3K8","MAP2K1","MAP2K2","Ribosomal_s6_kinase","ELK1","Transcription_factor","MAPK/ERK_pathway","P38_mitogen-activated_protein_kinases","C-Jun_N-terminal_kinases","MAP3K1","MAP3K4","MAP3K5","MAP3K7","MAP3K11","TAOK1","MAP2K4","MAP2K7","MAP2K3","MAP2K6","C-Jun","NFATC3","MAPKAPK2","MAPKAPK3","MAPK7","MKK5","MAP3K2","MAP3K3","Cavernous_hemangioma","Mating_of_yeast","G_protein-coupled_receptor","Heterotrimeric_G-protein","Sporulation","Osmotic_shock","Oxidative_stress","Morphogenesis","Dwarfism","Opisthokont","Metazoan","Protostome","Cnidaria","Sponge","Choanoflagellate","Enzyme_substrate_(biology)","Serine","Threonine","Proline","Cyclin-dependent_kinases","Cyclin","N-terminus","MAP2K1IP1","KSR1","KSR2","MAPK8IP1","MAPK8IP2","MAPK8IP3","MAPK8IP4","Kinesin","MAPK/ERK_pathway","Antineoplastic","Receptor_tyrosine_kinase","Ras_subfamily","C-Raf","Raf_kinase","Sorafenib","C-Jun_N-terminal_kinases","Insulin_resistance","Excitotoxicity","JNK_inhibitor","Sensorineural_hearing_loss","P38_mitogen-activated_protein_kinases","Autoimmune_disease","Hepatotoxic","MAPK1","MAPK3","MAPK7","MAPK8","MAPK9","MAPK10","MAPK11","MAPK12","MAPK13","MAPK14","Extracellular_signal-regulated_kinases","MAPK/ERK_pathway","C-Jun_N-terminal_kinases","P38_mitogen-activated_protein_kinases"]}
