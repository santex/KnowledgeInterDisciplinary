{"cursor":"25618","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"s are important enzymes in xenobiotic metabolism.]] 'Drug metabolism' also\nknown as 'xenobiotic metabolism' is the biochemical modification of\npharmaceutical substances or xenobiotics respectively by living organisms,\nusually through specialized enzymatic systems. Drug metabolism often converts\nlipophilic chemical compounds into more readily excreted hydrophilic products.\nThe rate of metabolism determines the duration and intensity of a drug's\npharmacological action.\n\nXenobiotic metabolism (from the Greek xenos \"stranger\" and biotic \"related to\nliving beings\") is the set of metabolic pathways that modify the chemical\nstructure of xenobiotics, which are compounds foreign to an organism's normal\nbiochemistry, such as drugs and poisons. These pathways are a form of\nbiotransformation present in all major groups of organisms, and are considered\nto be of ancient origin. These reactions often act to detoxify poisonous\ncompounds; however, in some cases, the intermediates in xenobiotic metabolism\ncan themselves be the cause of toxic effects.\n\nThe reactions in these pathways are of particular interest in medicine as part\nof drug metabolism and as a factor contributing to multidrug resistance in\ninfectious diseases and cancer chemotherapy. The actions of some drugs as\nsubstrates or inhibitors of enzymes involved in xenobiotic metabolism are a\ncommon reason for hazardous drug interactions. These pathways are also important\nin environmental science, with the xenobiotic metabolism of microorganisms\ndetermining whether a pollutant will be broken down during bioremediation, or\npersist in the environment. The enzymes of xenobiotic metabolism, particularly\nthe glutathione S-transferases are also important in agriculture, since they may\nproduce resistance to pesticides and herbicides.\n\nDrug metabolism is divided into three phases. In phase I, enzymes such as\ncytochrome P450 oxidases introduce reactive or polar groups into xenobiotics.\nThese modified compounds are then conjugated to polar compounds in phase II\nreactions. These reactions are catalysed by transferase enzymes such as\nglutathione S-transferases. Finally, in phase III, the conjugated xenobiotics\nmay be further processed, before being recognised by efflux transporters and\npumped out of cells.\n","linknr":470,"url":"Xenobiotic_metabolism","recorded":1362503292,"links":23,"instances":["microbiology","greek","chemistry","zoology"],"pdf":["http://ep.physoc.org/cgi/reprint/82/2/291.pdf","http://ep.physoc.org/cgi/reprint/82/2/291.pdf"],"categories":["Metabolism","Hepatology","Toxicology","Pharmacology"],"headings":["Permeability barriers and detoxification","Phases of detoxification","Endogenous toxins","Sites","Factors that affect drug metabolism","History","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/29/CYP2C9_1OG2.png/230px-CYP2C9_1OG2.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/97/Xenobiotic_metabolism.png/350px-Xenobiotic_metabolism.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/6/c/46c90920483ace7550f3eeed6e32f203.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["polarity","chemistry"],["xenos","greek"],["efflux","microbiology"],["gut","zoology"]],"members":["efflux","xenos","polarity","gut"],"related":["Xenobiotic","Biochemical","Pharmaceutical_drug","Xenobiotic","Organism","Enzyme","Lipophilic","Chemical_compound","Excretion","Polarity_(chemistry)","Xenos_(Greek)","Metabolic_pathway","Xenobiotic","Biotransformation","Detoxification","Medicine","Multidrug_resistance","Infectious_disease","Cancer","Chemotherapy","Enzyme_inhibitor","Drug_interaction","Environmental_science","Microorganism","Bioremediation","Persistent_organic_pollutant","Glutathione_S-transferase","Pesticide","Herbicide","Cytochrome_P450_oxidase","Transferase","Glutathione_S-transferase","Efflux_(microbiology)","Metabolism","Enzyme","Cell_membrane","Cell_membrane","Transport_protein","Hydrophile","Hydrophobe","Lipid","Glyoxalase_system","Aldehyde","Cytochrome_P450","Oxidation","Redox","Hydrolysis","Cytochrome_P450_oxidase","Phenothiazine","Prodrug","Toxification","Acetonitrile","Formaldehyde","Hydrogen_cyanide","Biomimetic","Trimebutine","Formaldehyde","Cytochrome_P450_oxidase","Flavin-containing_monooxygenase_system","Alcohol_dehydrogenase","Aldehyde_dehydrogenase","Monoamine_oxidase","Peroxidase","Cytochrome_P450_reductase","Cytochrome_P450_reductase","Oxygen","Superoxide_anion","Esterase","Amidase","Epoxide_hydrolase","Glutathione","Sulfate","Glycine","Glucuronic_acid","Carboxyl","Hydroxyl","Amino","Sulfhydryl","Active_metabolites","Electrophile","Glutathione_S-transferase","Methylation","Methyltransferase","S-adenosyl-L-methionine","Sulphation","Sulfotransferase","3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate","Acetylation","N-acetyltransferase","Acetyl_coenzyme_A","Red_blood_cell","Glucuronidation","UDP-glucuronosyltransferase","UDP-glucuronic_acid","Glutathione_S-transferase","Glutathione","Choline_acetyltransferase","Glycine","Acetylcysteine","Glutamic_acid","Glycine","Gamma-glutamyl_transpeptidase","Dipeptidase","Cystine","Acetylated","Conjugates","P-glycoprotein","ATP-binding_cassette_transporter","Peroxide","Aldehyde","Glyoxalase_system","Methylglyoxal","Antioxidant","Reactive_oxygen_species","Smooth_endoplasmic_reticulum","Liver","Biological_tissue","Gut_(zoology)","Epithelial_cell","Gastrointestinal_tract","Lung","Kidney","Skin","Cytochrome_P450_monooxygenase_system","Enzyme_induction_and_inhibition","Enzyme_induction_and_inhibition","Pharmacogenetics","Enterohepatic_circulation","Nutrition","Intestinal_flora","Sex_difference","Fetal","Neonatal","Elderly","Human","Animal","Adult","Canada","Cytochrome_P450_monooxygenase_system","Liver","Kidney","Heart","Benzaldehyde","Methylation","Acetylation","Sulfonic_acid","Richard_Tecwyn_Williams","Antioxidant","Biodegradation","Bioremediation","Microbial_biodegradation"]}
