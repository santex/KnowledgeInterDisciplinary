Lorazepam is\nused for the short-term treatment of anxiety, insomnia, acute seizures including\nstatus epilepticus and sedation of hospitalized patients, as well as sedation of\naggressive patients.\n\nLorazepam is considered to be a short-acting drug which, similar to other\nbenzodiazepines, exerts its therapeutic effects via its interaction at\nbenzodiazepine binding sites, which are located on GABA A receptors in\nthe central nervous system. After its introduction in 1977, lorazepam's\nprincipal use was in treating anxiety. Among benzodiazepines, lorazepam has a\nrelatively high addictive potential. Lorazepam\nalso has abuse potential; the main types of misuse are for recreational purposes\nor continued use against medical advice. Its sedative-\nhypnotic and anterograde amnesia properties are sometimes used for criminal\npurposes.\n\nLong-term effects of benzodiazepines include tolerance, dependence, a\nbenzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome, and cognitive impairments which may not\ncompletely reverse after cessation of treatment; however, for most patients,\ncognitive impairment is not severe. Withdrawal symptoms can range from anxiety\nand insomnia to seizures and psychosis. Due to tolerance and dependence,\nlorazepam is recommended for short-term use, up to two to four weeks only.\nAdverse effects, including anterograde amnesia, depression and paradoxical\neffects such as excitement or worsening of seizures, may occur. Children and the\nelderly are more sensitive to the adverse effects of benzodiazepines. Lorazepam\nimpairs body balance and standing steadiness and is associated with falls and\nhip fractures in the elderly.\n","linknr":1843,"url":"Lorazepam","recorded":1362477628,"links":73,"instances":["clinical"],"pdf":["http://www.springerlink.com/content/k6w77661421pr404/fulltext.pdf","http://www.springerlink.com/content/k6w77661421pr404/fulltext.pdf","http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2007/017794s034s035lbl.pdf","http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2007/017794s034s035lbl.pdf","http://www.chestjournal.org/cgi/reprint/109/5/1195.pdf","http://www.chestjournal.org/cgi/reprint/109/5/1195.pdf","http://annonc.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/16/suppl_1/i77.pdf","http://annonc.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/16/suppl_1/i77.pdf","http://www.baxter.com/products/anesthesia/anesthetic_pharmaceuticals/downloads/ativan.pdf","http://www.fda.gov/medwatch/safety/2007/Apr_PI/Ativan_PI.pdf","http://www.fda.gov/medwatch/safety/2007/Apr_PI/Ativan_PI.pdf","http://ebm.bmj.com/cgi/reprint/11/2/54.pdf","http://ebm.bmj.com/cgi/reprint/11/2/54.pdf","http://www.incb.org/pdf/e/list/green.pdf","http://www.incb.org/pdf/e/list/green.pdf","http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/documents/cdlist.pdf","http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/documents/cdlist.pdf","http://www.baxter.com/products/anesthesia/anesthetic_pharmaceuticals/downloads/ativan.pdf","http://www.ndaa.org/pdf/ntlc_benzodiazepines.pdf"],"categories":["Benzodiazepines","Antiemetics","Lactams","Organochlorides"],"headings":["Medical
