A person can remain domiciled in a jurisdiction even\nafter they have left it, if they have maintained sufficient links with that\njurisdiction or have not displayed an intention to leave permanently (i.e., if\nthat person has moved to a different state, but has not yet formed an intention\nto remain there indefinitely). A corporationâ€™s place of domicile is equivalent\nto its place of incorporation.\n\nTraditionally many common law jurisdictions considered a person's domicile to be\na determinative factor in the conflict of laws and would, for example, only\nrecognize a divorce conducted in another jurisdiction if at least one of the\nparties were domiciled there at the time it was conducted.\n",
