{"cursor":"9405","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nThe 'r-process' is a nucleosynthesis process, that occurs in core-collapse\nsupernovae (see also supernova nucleosynthesis), and is responsible for the\ncreation of approximately half of the neutron-rich atomic nuclei heavier than\niron. The process entails a succession of rapid neutron captures (hence the name\nr-process) by heavy seed nuclei, typically 56 Fe or other more neutron-\nrich heavy isotopes. The other predominant mechanism for the production of heavy\nelements is the s-process, which is nucleosynthesis by means of slow captures of\nneutrons, primarily occurring in AGB stars. The s-process is secondary, meaning\nthat it requires preexisting heavy isotopes as seed nuclei to be converted into\nother heavy nuclei. Taken together these two processes account for a majority of\ngalactic chemical evolution of elements heavier than iron. The r-process occurs\nto a slight extent in nuclear weapon explosions.\n","linknr":272,"url":"R-process","recorded":1362512963,"links":28,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Neutron","Astrophysics","Nuclear physics","Nucleosynthesis","Supernovae"],"headings":["History","Nuclear physics","Astrophysical sites","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Nucleosynthesis","Supernova","Supernova_nucleosynthesis","Neutron","Atomic_nucleus","Heavy_metals","Neutron_capture","Seed_nucleus","S-process","Asymptotic_giant_branch","Nucleosynthesis","Nuclear_weapon","Abundance_of_the_chemical_elements","Hans_Suess","Harold_Urey","Germanium","Xenon","Platinum","Shell_model","Radioactive","Isotopes","Neutron_drip_line","Neutron_capture","S-process","B2FH","Stellar_nucleosynthesis","Nuclear_astrophysics","B2FH_paper","William_A._Fowler","Donald_D._Clayton","Neutron","B2FH","Beta_decay","Fermi_energy","Neutron_flux","Temperature","Neutron_capture","Beta_decay","Neutron_drip_line","Nuclear_cross_section","Nuclear_shell_model","Photodisintegration","Table_of_nuclides","Radioactive_decay","Donald_D._Clayton","S-process","Atomic_mass_unit","Supernova","Atomic_nucleus","Interstellar_medium","Neutron_star","Binary_star","Observational_astronomy"]}
