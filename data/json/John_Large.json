Large' is an independent nuclear engineer and analyst primarily known\nfor his work in assessing and reporting upon nuclear safety and nuclear related\naccidents and incidents. From the mid-1960s until 1986 Large was an\nacademic in Brunel University's School of Engineering, where he undertook\nresearch for the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority.\n\nAs a Consulting Engineer with Large & Associates\n[http://www.largeassociates.com], Large led the nuclear risk assessment team for\nthe raising of the damaged Russian nuclear submarine ''Kursk'', which assessed\nthe nuclear hazards and defined the limits and conditions under which the lift\nand recovery of the submarine in 2001 took place. Also, he advised\nthe Government of Gibraltar on nuclear safety aspects of the repairs being\nundertaken to the nuclear propulsion reactor on board HMS ''Tireless''\nthroughout 2000, and he investigated the adequacy of emergency\nplanning in the event of a nuclear-powered submarine radiation incident whilst\nberthed in the UK port of Southampton. and update review following\nthe retrieval of classified documents relating to the risks and hazards of nuclear-\npowered submarines berthing at Southampton and elsewhere in the United\nKingdom. {{Cite document|url=http://www.largeassociates.com/3185%20SOTONSAFE/R3185-\nA6.pdf|title=A Brief Review of Information Obtained via Freedom of Information\nAct 2000 Request Relating to the Berthing of Royal Navy Nuclear Powered\nSubmarines at Southampton, 26 October 2010 |format=PDF|author=John H.\nLarge|publisher=SCANS|date=November 2010|accessdate=2010-12-25|postscript= }}\n\nLarge has been critical of the nuclear power industry, and is often commissioned\nby Greenpeace and other national and international NGOs to provide technical\nanalysis on nuclear issues. In 2003 a paper\nLarge submitted for publication to the Institution of Mechanical Engineers about\nthe danger of a terrorist attack on UK nuclear installations was suppressed on\nthe advice of the UK government.\n\nIn March 2011, he appeared on Al Jazeera English, Sky News, Channel 4 and BBC\nNews and ITN giving his assessment that the\nFukushima Dai-ichi reactor containment had been compromised in the hydrogen\nexplosions, leading to a dangerous release of radiation. This contradicted\ninformation released both by the operators and by the Japanese\nGovernment. On 23 March 2011 John Large appeared at the ALDE Group\nOpen Hearing at the European Parliament with an Intervention that\nstrongly challenged the proposals of the European Energy Commissioner GÃ¼nther\nOettinger to review the European Community nuclear safety requirements following\nthe radiological incidents at Fukushima.\n\nLarge has been invited by the Chief Nuclear Inspector of UK Office for Nuclear\nRegulation to join the Technical Advisory Panel working on the ONR's assessment\nof the implications for the UK nuclear Industry of the Fukushima Dai-ichi\nnuclear accident, although following failure to negotiate terms and conditions\nfor the appointment he opted out of the appointment. Instead, instructed by Greenpeace Germany and Greenpeace\nFrance, Large prepared a critical review of the preliminary report of the IAEA\nFact Finding Mission undertaken to Fukushima Dai-ichi in May 2011.","linknr":190,"url":"John_Large","recorded":1362374995,"links":31,"instances":["s88"],"pdf":["http://www.largeassociates.com/kurskpaper.pdf","http://www.largeassociates.com/KurskRINA.pdf","http://www.largeassociates.com/TirelessKurskForensic.pdf","http://www.largeassociates.com/TirelessKurskForensic.pdf","http://www.largeassociates.com/TirelessKurskForensic.pdf","http://www.largeassociates.com/3185%20SOTONSAFE/R3185-A5.pdf","http://www.largeassociates.com/3185%20SOTONSAFE/R3185-A5.pdf","http://www.largeassociates.com/3185%20SOTONSAFE/R3185-A6.pdf","http://www.largeassociates.com/3185%20SOTONSAFE/R3185-A6.pdf","http://www.greenpeace.org/raw/content/international/press/reports/analysis-of-greenpeace-materia.pdf","http://www.greenpeace.org/raw/content/international/press/reports/analysis-of-greenpeace-materia.pdf","http://www.largeassociates.com/3195%20Fukushima/R3195-A2.pdf","http://www.largeassociates.com/3195%20Fukushima/R3195-A2.pdf","http://www.largeassociates.com/3195%20Fukushima/ONR%20Technical%20Advisory%20Panel.pdf","http://www.largeassociates.com/3195%20Fukushima/ONR%20Technical%20Advisory%20Panel.pdf","http://www.largeassociates.com/3201%20IAEA%20Mission%20Statement/R3201-A1%20Final.pdf","http://www.largeassociates.com/3201%20IAEA%20Mission%20Statement/R3201-A1%20Final.pdf","http://www.largeassociates.com/3197%20Fukushima%20Cold%20Shutdown/R3197-A1.pdf","http://www.largeassociates.com/3197%20Fukushima%20Cold%20Shutdown/R3197-A1.pdf","http://pbadupws.nrc.gov/docs/ML1302/ML13023A137.pdf","http://pbadupws.nrc.gov/docs/ML1302/ML13023A137.pdf"],"categories":["Fellows of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers","Fellows of the Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures & Commerce","Members of the Institution of Nuclear Engineers","Academics of Brunel University","People associated with nuclear power","Living people"],"headings":["Sources","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["hms_tireless","s88"]],"members":["hms_tireless"],"related":["Nuclear_engineer","Nuclear_safety","Nuclear_and_radiation_accidents","Brunel_University","United_Kingdom_Atomic_Energy_Authority","Russian_submarine_Kursk_explosion","Russian_submarine_K-141_Kursk","Government_of_Gibraltar","HMS_Tireless_(S88)","Southampton","Nuclear_power","Greenpeace","NGOs","Institution_of_Mechanical_Engineers","UK_government","Fukushima_Dai-ichi","ALDE_Group","Günther_Oettinger","Office_for_Nuclear_Regulation","IAEA","Southern_California_Edison","San_Onofre_Nuclear_Generating_Station","Atomic_Safety_and_Licensing_Board","Nuclear_Regulatory_Commission","Apiary","Woodlands_Farm_Trust","Society_of_Naval_Architects_and_Marine_Engineers","Royal_Institution_of_Naval_Architects","Institution_of_Mechanical_Engineers"]}
