{"cursor":"2255","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Biosynthesis' (also called biogenesis or \"anabolism\") is an enzyme-catalyzed\nprocess in cells of living organisms by which substrates are converted to more\ncomplex products. The biosynthesis process\noften consists of several enzymatic steps in which the product of one step is\nused as substrate in the following step. Examples for such multi-step\nbiosynthetic pathways are those for the production of amino acids, fatty acids,\nand natural products. Biosynthesis plays a major role in all cells,\nand many dedicated metabolic routes combined constitute general metabolism. Six\norganelles in the cell are involved in biosynthesis: ribosomes, chloroplasts,\nsmooth endoplasmic reticulum, rough endoplasmic reticulum, plastids, and Golgi\nbodies. name=\"isbn978-1-932012-54-5\">\n\nThe prerequisites for biosynthesis are precursor compounds, chemical energy\n(such as in the form ATP), and catalytic enzymes, which may require reduction\nequivalents (e.g., in the form of NADH, NADPH).\n\nCommonly known complex products of biosynthesis include proteins, vitamins, and\nantibiotics. Most organic compounds in living organisms are built in\nbiosynthetic pathways.\n","linknr":134,"url":"Biosynthesis","recorded":1362511078,"links":37,"instances":["chemistry","chemistry","chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Metabolism","Biosynthesis|"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/AlphaHelixSection.svg/40px-AlphaHelixSection.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["substrate","chemistry"],["product","chemistry"],["precursor","chemistry"]],"members":["substrate","precursor","product"],"related":["Catalyst","Organism","Substrate_(chemistry)","Product_(chemistry)","Amino_acid","Fatty_acid","Natural_product","Metabolism","Precursor_(chemistry)","Adenosine_triphosphate","Enzyme","NADH","NADPH","Protein_biosynthesis","Vitamin","Antibiotics"]}
