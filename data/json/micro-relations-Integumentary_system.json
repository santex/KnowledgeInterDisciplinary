The system comprises the skin\nand its appendages {{cite book\n | last=Marieb | first=Elaine | coauthors=Katja Hoehn title=Human Anatomy &\n | Physiology publisher=Pearson Benjamin Cummings year=2007 edition=7th page=142\n}} (including hair, scales, feathers, hoofs, and nails). The integumentary\nsystem has a variety of functions; it may serve to waterproof, cushion, and\nprotect the deeper tissues, excrete wastes, and regulate temperature, and is the\nattachment site for sensory receptors to detect pain, sensation, pressure, and\ntemperature. In most terrestrial vertebrates with significant exposure to\nsunlight, the integumentary system also provides for vitamin D synthesis.\n","linknr":458,"url":"Integumentary_system","recorded":1362484932,"links":70,"instances":["anatomy","biology","anatomy","nail","physiology","anatomy","zoology","skin"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Integumentary system|","Organ systems"],"headings":["Layers of the skin","Hypodermis","Functions","Diseases and injuries","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["scale","zoology"],["nail","anatomy"],["organ","anatomy"],["respiration","physiology"],["epidermis","skin"],["matrix","nail"],["lunula","anatomy"],["tissue","biology"]],"members":["nail","tissue","organ","matrix","respiration","lunula","scale","epidermis"],"related":["Terminologia_Histologica","Organ_system","Skin","Hair","Scale_(zoology)","Feathers","Hoof","Nail_(anatomy)","Core_temperature","Sensory_receptor","Vitamin_D","Organ_(anatomy)","Respiration_(physiology)","Interstitial_fluid","Epidermis_(skin)","Dermis","Hypodermis","Adipose_tissue","Epithelial_cells","Squamous_epithelium","Keratinocytes","Melanocytes","Merkel_cells","Langerhans'_cells","Keratin","Waterproofed","Fingernail","Matrix_(nail)","Lunula_(anatomy)","Loose_connective_tissue","Elastin","Chromatophores","Hair","Feathers","Glands","Homeostasis","Tissue_(biology)","Infection","Dehydration","Weather","Temperature","Homeostasis","Excretion","Perspiration","Somatosensory_system","Sunburn","Vitamin_D","Ultraviolet","Light","Water","Fat","Vitamin_D","Rash","Blister","Athlete's_foot","Infection","Sunburn","Skin_cancer","Albinism","Acne","Herpes","Herpes_labialis","Mosquito","Impetigo","Rubella","Sexually_transmitted_disease","Cancer","Psoriasis"]}
