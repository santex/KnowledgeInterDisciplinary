{"cursor":"28007","size":15,"audio":[],"cat":[],"tmpl":[],"currentlang":"en","linknr":181,"url":"Isotopic_labeling","article":"'Isotopic labeling' (or 'isotopic labelling') is a technique used to track\nthe passage of an isotope, or an atom with a variation, through a reaction,\nmetabolic pathway, or cell. The reactant is 'labeled' by replacing specific\natoms by their isotope. The reactant is then allowed to undergo the\nreaction. The position of the isotopes in the products is measured to\ndetermine the sequence the isotopic atom followed in the reaction or the\ncell's metabolic pathway.\n\nIn isotopic labeling, there are multiple ways to detect the presence of labeling\nisotopes; through their mass, vibrational mode, or radioactive decay. Mass\nspectrometry or nuclear magnetic resonance detects the difference in an\nisotope's mass, while Infrared spectroscopy detects the difference in the\nisotope's vibrational modes. The radioactive decay can be detected through an\nionization chamber or autoradiographs of gels.\n\nAn example of the use of isotopic labeling is the study of phenol\n(C 6H 5OH) in water by replacing common hydrogen (protium)\nwith deuterium ('deuterium labeling'). Upon adding phenol to deuterated water\n(water containing D 2O in addition to the usual H 2O), the\nsubstitution of deuterium for the hydrogen is observed in phenol's hydroxyl\ngroup (resulting in C 6H 5OD), indicating that phenol\nreadily undergoes hydrogen-exchange reactions with water. Only the hydroxyl\ngroup was affected, indicating that the other 5 hydrogen atoms did not\nparticipate in these exchange reactions.\n","recorded":1362124010,"portal":[],"list":[],"links":"182","instances":["chemistry","biotechnology","mathematics","biology"],"pdf":["http://hort.ifas.ufl.edu/teach/guyweb/bot6516/PentosePhosphatePathway.pdf","http://hort.ifas.ufl.edu/teach/guyweb/bot6516/PentosePhosphatePathway.pdf"],"categories":["Isotopes","Laboratory techniques","Physical chemistry","Biochemistry methods","Mass spectrometry","Spectroscopy","Nuclear physics"],"headings":["Isotopic tracer","Stable isotope labeling","Radioisotopic labeling","Applications in genetics","Applications for oceanography","Methods for isotopic labeling","See also","References","External links"],"tags":[["cell","biology"],["product","chemistry"],["cell","biology"],["product","chemistry"],["matrix","mathematics"],["protein_expression","biotechnology"],["cell","biology"],["product","chemistry"],["cell","biology"],["product","chemistry"],["matrix","mathematics"],["protein_expression","biotechnology"]],"image":["http://en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Benzyneconversioncolouredlabels.png","http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Benzyneconversioncolouredlabels.png/300px-Benzyneconversioncolouredlabels.png","http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:StableIsotopeLabeling2.png","http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/72/StableIsotopeLabeling2.png/400px-StableIsotopeLabeling2.png","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:StableIsotopeLabeling2.png","http://bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:StableIsotopeLabeling.png","http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/17/StableIsotopeLabeling.png/300px-StableIsotopeLabeling.png","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:StableIsotopeLabeling.png","http://bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","http://bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","http://bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"related":["Isotope","Atom","Chemical_reaction","Metabolic_pathway","Cell_(biology)","Reactant","Product_(chemistry)","Mass","Vibrational_mode","Radioactive_decay","Mass_spectrometry","Nuclear_magnetic_resonance","Infrared_spectroscopy","Ionization_chamber","Autoradiographs","Phenol","Hydrogen","Hydrogen-1","Deuterium","Heavy_water","Hydroxyl_group","Chemistry","Biochemistry","Chemical_reaction","Atom","Molecule","Chemical_element","Isotope","Radioactive","Radioactive_tracer","Neutron","Nuclear_magnetic_resonance","Mass_spectrometry","Autoradiograph","Gel_electrophoresis","Photographic_film","Geology","Isotope_geochemistry","Stable_isotope","Radiogenic","Isotopic_signature","Radioactive_decay","Isotopes","Nuclear_magnetic_resonance","Mass_spectrometry","NMR_solvents","Amino_acids","Nucleic_acids","Lipids","Metabolites","Growth_medium","Glycolysis_pathway","Pentose_phosphate_pathway","Fructose_6-phosphate","Glyceraldehyde_3-phosphate","Sedoheptulose_7-phosphate","Erythrose_4-phosphate","Metabolic_flux_analysis","Isotope","Metabolic_pathway","Chemical_reaction","Cell_(biology)","Steady_state","Metabolite","Flux","Reactant","Product_(chemistry)","Stoichiometry","Constraint","Reversible_reaction","Matrix_(mathematics)","Intracellular","Iterative_method","Isotopomers","Nuclear_magnetic_resonance","Mass_spectrometry","Proton_NMR","Metabolite_pool","Proton_NMR","13C_NMR","Metabolic_flux_analysis","2D-NMR","Hydrolysate","GC-MS","LC-MS","Radionuclide","Radioactive_decay","Particle_radiation","Positron_emission","Photon","Radiometric_dating","Proteomics","Protein","Genome","Diseases","Biomarker","Stable_isotope_labeling_by_amino_acids_in_cell_culture","Ammonium_chloride","National_Institute_of_Standards_and_Technology","Protein_expression_(biotechnology)","Radioactivity_in_biology","Radioactive_tracer","Isotopomer","Isotopologue","Isobaric_labeling","Infrared_spectroscopy_of_metal_carbonyls"],"members":["product","protein_expression","matrix","cell"],"book":[]}
