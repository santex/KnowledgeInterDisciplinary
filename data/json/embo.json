This was done to raise funds to convert the unused primary\nschool in the village into a community\ncentre.<ref>[http://www.embo.org.uk/village.html \"Embo Memories\"] embo.org.uk.\nRetrieved 28 May 2010.</ref>\n\n\nThe village issued its own currency, called the Cuddie. The rate of exchange was\n2 cuddies to the pound. Cuddies were accepted in the local public house -\nGrannies Heilan' Hame, in exchange for a measure of Clynelish Malt Whisky. The\nowners of the distillery, in nearby Brora, sponsored the bid for independence by\nissuing a commemorative label on 50 cases of Clynelish Malt Whisky - \"The Spirit\nof Free Embo\"\n\nBronze Age remains were excavated to the south of the village in 1956, other\nburials having previously been discovered in the area.\n\nNancy Dorian's research of the local East Sutherland Gaelic dialect showed that\nin 1964, over 100 of the village's total population of fewer than 300 still\nactively spoke Gaelic, and that many more had a \"smattering\" or were perfect\npassive bilinguals. This percentage even briefly increased during the 1970s with\n\"returners\" to the village. Until the end of the 1970s at least, Embo was a\nbilingual Gaelic and English speaking community. Brora and Golspie had much\nsmaller percentages of Gaelic speakers at that time.\n\nAs with the entire region of East Sutherland, the end of the 19th century and\nthe collapse of the fishing industry coincided with the decline of Gaelic as the\nmajority language of the people.\n\nEmbo is informally \"twinned\" with Kaunakakai on the island of Molokai in Hawaii.<ref>[http://www.northern-\ntimes.co.uk/news/fullstory.php/aid/859/Embo.html \"Aloha Embo\"] The Northern\nTimes.
