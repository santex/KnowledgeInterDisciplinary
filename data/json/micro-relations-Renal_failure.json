The two main forms are acute kidney injury, which is often\nreversible with adequate treatment, and chronic kidney disease, which is often\nnot reversible. In both cases, there is usually an underlying cause.\n\nRenal failure is mainly determined by a decrease in glomerular filtration rate,\nthe rate at which blood is filtered in the glomeruli of the kidney. This is\ndetected by a decrease in or absence of urine production or determination of\nwaste products (creatinine or urea) in the blood. Depending on the cause,\nhematuria (blood loss in the urine) and proteinuria (protein loss in the urine)\nmay be noted.\n\nIn renal failure, there may be problems with increased fluid in the body\n(leading to swelling), increased acid levels, raised levels of potassium,\ndecreased levels of calcium, increased levels of phosphate, and in later stages\nanemia. Bone health may also be affected. Long-term kidney problems are\nassociated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease.\n","linknr":510,"url":"Renal_failure","recorded":1362372303,"links":47,"instances":["anatomy"],"pdf":["http://www.amzh.hr/amc/pdf/amc_2011%20vol%2065%20supplement%203.pdf","http://www.amzh.hr/amc/pdf/amc_2011%20vol%2065%20supplement%203.pdf"],"categories":["Nephrology","Organ failure"],"headings":["Classification","Signs and symptoms","Causes","Diagnostic approach","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/Hemodialysismachine.jpg/220px-Hemodialysismachine.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["limb","anatomy"]],"members":["limb"],"related":["Kidney","Acute_kidney_injury","Chronic_kidney_disease","Renal_function","Glomerulus","Oliguria","Anuria","Creatinine","Urea","Hematuria","Proteinuria","Acidosis","Hyperkalemia","Hypocalcemia","Hyperphosphatemia","Anemia","Cardiovascular_disease","Acute_kidney_injury","Chronic_kidney_disease","Anemia","Medical_ultrasound","Acute_kidney_injury","Renal_function","Oliguria","Urine","Millilitres","Water-electrolyte_imbalance","Dialysis","Chronic_kidney_disease","Creatinine","Physician","Azotemia","Uraemia","Vomiting","Diarrhea","Dehydration","Nausea","Phosphates","Muscle_cramps","Hyperphosphatemia","Potassium","Hyperkalemia","Erythropoietin","Bone_marrow","Dizziness","Insomnia","Penicillin","Seizures","Crush_syndrome","Toxin","Blood_circulation","Limb_(anatomy)","Ischemia","Clogging","Reperfusion_injury","Myoglobin","Potassium","Phosphorus","Rhabdomyolysis","Ischemia","Kidney","Nephrotoxicity","Metabolite","Diabetes_mellitus","Hypertension","Polycystic_kidney_disease","Aspirin","Ibuprofen","Acetaminophen","Hantavirus","HIV-associated_nephropathy","Focal_segmental_glomerulosclerosis","Chronic_kidney_disease","Glomerular_filtration_rate","Chronic_kidney_disease","Dialysis","Kidney_transplantation","The_National_Kidney_Foundation","Creatinine"]}
