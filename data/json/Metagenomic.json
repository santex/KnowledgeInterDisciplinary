{"cursor":"56966","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Metagenomics' is the study of 'metagenomes', genetic material recovered\ndirectly from environmental samples. The broad field may also be referred to as\n'environmental genomics', 'ecogenomics' or 'community genomics'. While\ntraditional microbiology and microbial genome sequencing and genomics rely upon\ncultivated clonal cultures, early environmental gene sequencing cloned specific\ngenes (often the 16S rRNA gene) to produce a profile of diversity in a natural\nsample. Such work revealed that the vast majority of microbial biodiversity had\nbeen missed by cultivation-based methods. Recent\nstudies use \"shotgun\" Sanger sequencing or massively parallel pyrosequencing to\nget largely unbiased samples of all genes from all the members of the sampled\ncommunities. Because of its ability to reveal the\npreviously hidden diversity of microscopic life, metagenomics offers a powerful\nlens for viewing the microbial world that has the potential to revolutionize\nunderstanding of the entire living world.\n","linknr":955,"url":"Metagenomic","recorded":1362503270,"links":54,"instances":["metagenomics","company","biology","genetics","biology","material","dna","software","molecular_biology"],"pdf":["http://dels-old.nas.edu/dels/rpt_briefs/metagenomics_final.pdf","http://dels-old.nas.edu/dels/rpt_briefs/metagenomics_final.pdf","http://handelsmanlab.sites.yale.edu/sites/default/files/Biotechnological%20prospects%20from%20metagenomics.pdf","http://handelsmanlab.sites.yale.edu/sites/default/files/Biotechnological%20prospects%20from%20metagenomics.pdf","http://dels.nas.edu/dels/rpt_briefs/metagenomics_brief_final.pdf"],"categories":["Bioinformatics","Genomics","Environmental
