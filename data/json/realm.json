      "text" : "\n\nA 'realm' is a community or territory over which a sovereign rules; it is\ncommonly used to describe a kingdom or other monarchical or dynastic state.\n\nThe Old French word reaume, modern French royaume, was the word first adopted in\nEnglish; the fixed modern spelling does not appear until the beginning of the\n17th century. The word supposedly derives from medieval Latin regalimen, from\nregalis, of or belonging to a rex, (king).<ref>Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh\nEdition article \"Realm\"</ref>\n\n\"Realm\" is particularly used for those states whose name includes the word\nkingdom (for example, the United Kingdom), to avoid clumsy repetition of the\nword in a sentence (for example, \"The Queen's realm, the United Kingdom...\").\nIt is also useful to describe those countries whose monarchs are called\nsomething other than \"king\" or \"queen\"; for example, the Grand Duchy of\nLuxembourg is a realm but not a kingdom since its monarch holds the title Grand\nDuke rather than King.\n\n\"Realm\" is also frequently used to refer to territories that are \"under\" a\nmonarch, yet are not a physical part of his or her \"kingdom\" (e.g. the [[Realm\nof Sweden]], or to Holstein, which until the Second War of Schleswig was an\nimportant part of the Danish King's realm stretching to the border of Hamburg,\nalthough not a part of the Danish Kingdom). Similarly, the Cook Islands, Niue,\nand Tokelau are considered parts of the [[Realm of New Zealand]], although they\nare not part of New Zealand proper. Likewise, the Faroe Islands and Greenland\nremain parts of the [[Danish Realm]].\n\nRealm may commonly also be used to describe the Commonwealth realms which all\nare kingdoms in their own right and share a common monarch, though they are\nfully independent of each other.\n",
