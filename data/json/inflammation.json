      "text" : "]]\n\n'Inflammation' (Latin, [[wikt:en:inflammo#Latin|īnflammō]], \"I ignite, set\nalight\") is part of the complex biological response of vascular tissues to\nharmful stimuli, such as pathogens, damaged cells, or irritants.<ref\nname=\"pmid17223962\"></ref> The classical signs of acute inflammation are pain,\nheat, redness, swelling, and loss of function. Inflammation is a protective\nattempt by the organism to remove the injurious stimuli and to initiate the\nhealing process. Inflammation is not a synonym for infection, even in cases\nwhere inflammation is caused by infection. Although infection is caused by a\nmicroorganism, inflammation is one of the responses of the organism to the\npathogen. However, inflammation is a stereotyped response, and therefore it is\nconsidered as a mechanism of innate immunity, as compared to adaptive immunity,\nwhich is specific for each pathogen.<ref name=\"ABBAS\"></ref>\n\nProgressive destruction of the tissue would compromise the survival of the\norganism. However, chronic inflammation can also lead to a host of diseases,\nsuch as hay fever, periodontitis, atherosclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and\neven cancer (e.g., gallbladder carcinoma). It is for that reason that\ninflammation is normally closely regulated by the body.\n\nInflammation can be classified as either acute or chronic. Acute inflammation\nis the initial response of the body to harmful stimuli and is achieved by the\nincreased movement of plasma and leukocytes (especially granulocytes) from\nthe blood into the injured tissues. A cascade of biochemical events\npropagates and matures the inflammatory response, involving the local\nvascular system, the immune system, and various cells within the injured\ntissue. Prolonged inflammation, known as chronic inflammation, leads to a\nprogressive shift in the type of cells present at the site of inflammation\nand is characterized by simultaneous destruction and healing of the tissue\nfrom the inflammatory process.\n",
