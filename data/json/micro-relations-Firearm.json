{"cursor":"61729","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nA 'firearm' is a portable gun that launches one projectile or more at high\nvelocity through the confined burning of a propellant. In older firearms, the\npropellant was typically black powder, but modern firearms use smokeless powder\nor other propellants. Most modern firearms (with the notable exception of\nsmoothbore firearms) have rifled barrels to impart spin to the projectile for\nimproved flight stability.\n","linknr":656,"url":"Firearm","recorded":1362486191,"links":100,"instances":["firearms","historiography","by_state","weapon","weapon","firearms","ammunition","weapon","firearms","cartridge","projectile"],"pdf":["http://www.nssf.org/PDF/2010EconomicImpact.pdf","http://www.nssf.org/PDF/2010EconomicImpact.pdf"],"categories":["Firearms|","Chinese
