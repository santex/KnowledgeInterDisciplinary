The RSV is an authorized\nrevision of the American Standard Version (ASV) of 1901.\n\nThe RSV posed the first serious challenge to the popularity of the King James\nVersion (KJV). It was intended to be a readable and literally accurate modern\nEnglish translation. The intention was not only to create a clearer version of\nthe Bible for the English-speaking church but also to \"preserve all that is best\nin the English Bible as it has been known and used through the centuries\" and\n\"to put the message of the Bible in simple, enduring words that are worthy to\nstand in the great Tyndale-King James tradition.\"\n\nThe RSV was published in the following stages: *New Testament (first edition),\n1946 (originally copyrighted to the International Council of Religious\nEducation) *Old Testament (and thus the full Protestant Bible), 1952 *Apocrypha,\n1957 *Modified edition, 1962 *RSV Catholic Edition, (NT 1965, Complete Bible\n1966) *New Testament (second edition), 1971 *Common Bible, 1973 *Apocrypha,\nexpanded edition, 1977 *Second Catholic Edition, 2006\n\nIn later years, the RSV served as the basis for two revisions - the New Revised\nStandard Version of 1989, and the English Standard Version of 2001.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Revised_Standard_Version","recorded":1372152346,"links":[],"instances":["1999_documentary","publisher"],"pdf":[],"categories":["1952 books","English Bible translations","1952 in religion"],"headings":["Making of the RSV","Features","Reception and controversy","Later editions","The Apocrypha and the Catholic Edition","Adaptations","Revisions","The RSV today","See also","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["thomas_nelson","publisher"],["the_bible_under_fire","1999_documentary"]],"members":["the_bible_under_fire","thomas_nelson"],"related":["American_Standard_Version","Novum_Testamentum_Graece","Biblia_Hebraica_Stuttgartensia","Dead_Sea_Scrolls","Septuagint","Septuagint","Vulgate","Formal_equivalence","Dynamic_equivalence","National_Council_of_the_Churches_of_Christ_in_the_USA","Bible_translations","Bible","American_Standard_Version","Authorized_King_James_Version","New_Testament","International_Council_of_Religious_Education","Old_Testament","Apocrypha","Revised_Standard_Version_Catholic_Edition","New_Revised_Standard_Version","English_Standard_Version","International_Council_of_Religious_Education","Great_Depression","World_War_II","Thomas_Nelson_(publisher)","Novum_Testamentum_Graece","New_Testament","Hebrew_language","Masoretic_Text","Old_Testament","Book_of_Isaiah","Dead_Sea_Scrolls","Luther_Weigle","Federal_Council_of_Churches","National_Council_of_the_Churches_of_Christ_in_the_USA","Jerome","Washington_D.C.","Harry_S._Truman","Tetragrammaton","Jehovah","Grammatical_person","Thou","Good_News_Translation","Daniel_B._Wallace","Jewish_Publication_Society_of_America_Version","Tanakh","Harry_Orlinsky","Almah","Septuagint","Virgin_Birth_of_Jesus","F.F._Bruce","William_Tyndale","Bruce_Metzger","King-James-Only_Movement","New_American_Standard_Bible","New_International_Version","English_Standard_Version","Zondervan","Holman_Bible_Publishers","The_Melton_Book_Company","Oxford_University_Press","Cokesbury","American_Bible_Society","Bodmer_Papyri","Codex_Bezae","Revelation","Episcopal_Church_in_the_United_States_of_America","Deuterocanonical_books","Apocrypha","Revised_Version","Eastern_Orthodox","Psalm_151","New_Revised_Standard_Version","Catholic_Biblical_Association","Reginald_C._Fuller","Roman_Catholic","Ignatius_Press","Deuterocanonical","Vulgate","Navarre_Bible","Ignatius_Press","Protestant","1_Esdras","3_Ezra","2_Esdras","4_Ezra","Prayer_of_Manasseh","Vulgate","Jerome","3_Maccabees","4_Maccabees","Psalm_151","Eastern_Orthodox","Christian_ecumenism","Reader's_Digest","Lord's_Prayer","Psalm_23","Ten_Commandments","National_Council_of_Churches","Gender-neutral_language","Old_Testament","Crossway_Bibles","Evangelicalism","Odyssey_Productions","The_Bible_Under_Fire_(1999_documentary)","Oxford_University_Press","Oxford_Annotated_Bible","British_and_Foreign_Bible_Society","Anglicized","Ignatius_Press","St._Benedict_Press","Dallas_Theological_Seminary"]}
