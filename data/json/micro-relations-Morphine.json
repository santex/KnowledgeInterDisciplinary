It was first isolated in 1804 by Friedrich SertÃ¼rner, first\ndistributed by him in 1817, and first commercially sold by Merck in 1827, which\nat the time was a single small chemists' shop. It was more widely used after the\ninvention of the hypodermic needle in 1857. It took its name from the Greek god\nof dreams Morpheus ().\n\nMorphine is the most abundant opiate found in opium, the dried latex extracted\nby shallowly slicing the unripe seedpods of the [[Papaver somniferum]] poppy.\nMorphine was the first active principle purified from a plant source and is one\nof at least 50 alkaloids of several different types present in opium, poppy\nstraw concentrate, and other poppy derivatives. Morphine is generally 8 to 14\npercent of the dry weight of opium, although specially\nbred cultivars reach 26 percent or produce little morphine at all (under 1\npercent, perhaps down to 0.04 percent). The latter varieties, including the\n'Przemko' and 'Norman' cultivars of the opium poppy, are used to produce two\nother alkaloids, thebaine and oripavine, which are used in the manufacture of\nsemi-synthetic and synthetic opioids like oxycodone and etorphine and some other\ntypes of drugs. [[Papaver bracteatum|P. bracteatum]] does not contain morphine\nor codeine, or other narcotic phenanthrene-type, alkaloids. This species is\nrather a source of thebaine. Occurrence of morphine in other\nPapaverales and Papaveraceae, as well as in some species of hops and mulberry\ntrees has not been confirmed. Morphine is produced most predominantly early in\nthe life cycle of the plant. Past the optimum point for extraction, various\nprocesses in the plant produce codeine, thebaine, and in some cases negligible\namounts of hydromorphone, dihydromorphine, dihydrocodeine, tetrahydro-thebaine,\nand hydrocodone (these compounds are rather synthesized from thebaine and\noripavine). The human body produces endorphines, which are endogenous opioid\npeptides that function as neurotransmitters and have similar effects. Oswald\nSteward: Functional neuroscience (2000), page 116.

Morphine has a high potential for addiction; tolerance and psychological\ndependence develop rapidly, although physiological dependence may take several\nmonths to develop.\n","linknr":1887,"url":"Morphine","recorded":1362373073,"links":111,"instances":["emotion","medicine","herb","chemistry","neural","canada","data_page","drug","mythology","organic_chemist","pharmacology","us"],"pdf":["http://www.health.gov.au/internet/drugstrategy/publishing.nsf/Content/8BA50209EE22B9C6CA2575B40013539D/$File/mono52.pdf","http://www.auburn.edu/~deruija/opioids_morphine.pdf","http://brocku.ca/mathematics-science/departments-and-centres/chemistry/faculty/Hudlicky/CurrOrgChem-2000-4-343.pdf","http://jpet.aspetjournals.org/content/301/2/690.full.pdf","http://www.incb.org/documents/Narcotic-Drugs/Yellow_List/NAR_2011_YellowList_50edition_EN.pdf","http://www.incb.org/documents/Narcotic-Drugs/Yellow_List/NAR_2011_YellowList_50edition_EN.pdf"],"categories":["German
