{"cursor":"45978","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n in Norway.]] 'Senescence' (from , meaning âto grow old,â from\n [[wiktionary:senex|senex]]) or 'biological aging' is the endogenous and\n hereditary process of accumulative changes to molecular and cellular structure\n disrupting metabolism with the passage of time, resulting in deterioration and\n death. Senescence occurs both on the level of the whole organism (organismal\n senescence) as well as on the level of its individual cells (cellular\n senescence). The science of biological aging is biogerontology. Albeit\n indirectly, senescence is by far the leading cause of death. Of the roughly\n 150,000 people who die each day across the globe, about two thirdsâ100,000 per\n dayâdie of age-related causes; in industrialized nations, moreover, the\n proportion is much higher, reaching 90%. Senescence is not the inevitable fate of all organisms, and\n animal organisms of some groups ([[taxa]]) even experience chronological\n decrease in mortality, for all or part of their life cycle. On the other extreme are accelerated aging diseases, rare in\n humans. There are a number of hypotheses as to why senescence occurs; for\n example, some posit it is programmed by gene expression changes, others that it\n is the cumulative damage caused by biological processes. Whether senescence as\n a biological process itself can be slowed down, halted or even reversed, is a\n subject of current scientific speculation and research.\n","linknr":916,"url":"Senescence","recorded":1362373911,"links":52,"instances":["genetics","aging","genetics","biology","chemistry"],"pdf":["http://www.sens.org/files/pdf/ENHANCE-PP.pdf","http://www.sens.org/files/pdf/ENHANCE-PP.pdf","http://www.devonescent.org/pdfs/Williams57.pdf","http://www.devonescent.org/pdfs/Williams57.pdf","http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/arh23-4/272-283.pdf","http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/arh23-4/272-283.pdf","http://www.nature.com.gate2.inist.fr/nature/journal/v423/n6937/pdf/nature01631.pdf","http://www.nature.com.gate2.inist.fr/nature/journal/v423/n6937/pdf/nature01631.pdf"],"categories":["Gerontology","Aging","Ailments
