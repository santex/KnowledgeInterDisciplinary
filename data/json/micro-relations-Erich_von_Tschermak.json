He was\na son of the Moravia-born mineralogist Gustav Tschermak von Seysenegg. His\nmaternal grandfather was the famous botanist, Eduard Fenzl, who taught Gregor\nMendel botany during his student days in Vienna.\n\nHe received his doctorate from the University of Halle, Germany, in 1896.\nTschermak accepted a teaching position at the University of Agricultural\nSciences Vienna in 1901, and became professor there five years later, in 1906.\nVon Tschermak is one of three menâsee also Hugo de Vries and Carl Corrensâwho\nindependently rediscovered Gregor Mendel's work on genetics. Von Tschermak\npublished his findings in June, 1900.\n","linknr":156,"url":"Erich_von_Tschermak","recorded":1362374019,"links":33,"instances":["biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["1871 births","1962 deaths","Austrian biologists","Agronomists","Austrian nobility","Austrian people of Czech descent","University of Halle alumni","Recipients of the Austrian Decoration for Science and Art"],"headings":["Decorations and awards","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Acta_Horti_berg._-_1905_-_tafl._124._-_Erich_Tschermak.jpg/150px-Acta_Horti_berg._-_1905_-_tafl._124._-_Erich_Tschermak.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/41/Flag_of_Austria.svg/40px-Flag_of_Austria.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/03/Scientist.svg/30px-Scientist.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/45/Charles_Darwin_1880.jpg/30px-Charles_Darwin_1880.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["hybrid","biology"]],"members":["hybrid"],"related":["Austria","Agronomy","Karl_Wilhelm_von_Nägeli","Austria","Agronomist","Disease_resistance_in_fruit_and_vegetables","Hybrid_(biology)","Mineralogy","Gustav_Tschermak_von_Seysenegg","Eduard_Fenzl","Gregor_Mendel","Botany","Vienna","University_of_Halle-Wittenberg","Germany","University_of_Agricultural_Sciences_Vienna","Hugo_de_Vries","Carl_Correns","Genetics","University_of_Vienna","Austrian_Decoration_for_Science_and_Art","J._Hered.","UNITED_STATES","J._Hered.","UNITED_STATES","Wien._Klin._Wochenschr.","Not_Available"]}
