{"cursor":"1226","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Denaturation' of fissile materials suitable for nuclear weapons is the process\nof transforming them into a form that is not suitable for weapons use and can\nnot easily be reversely transformed. For Uranium 235 this is straightforward, by\nmixing it with Uranium 238, but for plutonium it is more difficult and/or less\neffective, because other plutonium isotopes are either also suitable for weapons\nor not available and not practical to produce, while mixing with another element\nallows chemical separation.\n\nThe situation with Uranium-233 is more drastic. Decay of the attached Uranium-\n232 produces Thorium-228 with a radioactive half-life of 1.9 years and several\nshort-lived daughter nuclides; these daughters include some very hard gamma-ray\nemitters like Thallium-208 and Lead-212. After approximately one single year the\nalpha activity of these decay products is several hundred curies per kilogram of\nU-233, and the gamma penetration radiation is a thousand times larger to some\nthan from the plutonium. Aged U-233 is self-protected radiologically from\ndiversion.\n","linknr":97,"url":"Denaturation_(fissile_materials)","recorded":1362688436,"links":16,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Isotope separation"],"headings":[],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e1/Stylised_Lithium_Atom.svg/26px-Stylised_Lithium_Atom.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Fissile","Nuclear_weapon","Uranium_235","Uranium_238","Plutonium","Isotope","Uranium-233","Uranium-232","Thorium-228","Thallium-208","Lead-212"]}
