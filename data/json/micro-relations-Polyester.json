{"cursor":"15695","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n picture of a bend in a high-surface area polyester fiber with a seven-lobed\n cross section]]\n\n\n'Polyester' is a category of polymers which contain the ester functional group\nin their main chain. Although there are many polyesters, the term \"polyester\" as\na specific material most commonly refers to polyethylene terephthalate (PET).\nPolyesters include naturally occurring chemicals, such as in the cutin of plant\ncuticles, as well as synthetics through step-growth polymerization such as\npolycarbonate and polybutyrate. Natural polyesters and a few synthetic ones are\nbiodegradable, but most synthetic polyesters are not.\n\nDepending on the chemical structure, polyester can be a thermoplastic or\nthermoset, there are also polyester resins cured by hardeners; however, the most\ncommon polyesters are thermoplastics.\n\nFabrics woven or knitted from polyester thread or yarn are used extensively in\napparel and home furnishings, from shirts and pants to jackets and hats, bed\nsheets, blankets, upholstered furniture and computer mouse mats. Industrial\npolyester fibers, yarns and ropes are used in tyre reinforcements, fabrics for\nconveyor belts, safety belts, coated fabrics and plastic reinforcements with high-\nenergy absorption. Polyester fiber is used as cushioning and insulating material\nin pillows, comforters and upholstery padding. Polyesters are also used to make\nbottles, films, tarpaulin, canoes, liquid crystal displays, holograms, filters,\ndielectric film for capacitors, film insulation for wire and insulating tapes.\nPolyesters are widely used as a finish on high-quality wood products such as\nguitars, pianos and vehicle/yacht interiors. Thixotropic properties of spray-\napplicable polyesters make them ideal for use on open-grain timbers, as they can\nquickly fill wood grain, with a high-build film thickness per coat. Cured\npolyesters can be sanded and polished to a high-gloss, durable finish.\n\nWhile synthetic clothing in general is perceived by many as having a less\nnatural feel compared to fabrics woven from natural fibers (such as cotton and\nwool), polyester fabrics can provide specific advantages over natural fabrics,\nsuch as improved wrinkle resistance, durability and high color retention. As a\nresult, polyester fibers are sometimes spun together with natural fibers to\nproduce a cloth with blended properties. Synthetic fibers also can create\nmaterials with superior water, wind and environmental resistance compared to plant-\nderived fibers.\n\nLiquid crystalline polyesters are among the first industrially used liquid\ncrystal polymers. They are used for their mechanical properties and heat-\nresistance. These traits are also important in their application as an abradable\nseal in jet engines.\n","linknr":683,"url":"Polyester","recorded":1362505759,"links":59,"instances":["chemistry","fabric"],"pdf":["http://www.inchem.org/documents/sids/sids/100-21-0.pdf","http://www.inchem.org/documents/sids/sids/120616.pdf"],"categories":["Carboxylate esters","Packaging materials","Plastics","Polyesters|","Synthetic resins","Synthetic fibers","Thermoplastics","Dielectrics","Airship technology","Thermosetting plastics"],"headings":["Types","Industry","Synthesis","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/SEMexample.jpg/220px-SEMexample.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/92/Polyester_Shirt%2C_close-up.jpg/220px-Polyester_Shirt%2C_close-up.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/Transesterification.png/500px-Transesterification.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2d/Hanfstengel.jpg/140px-Hanfstengel.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["filter","chemistry"],["shrinkage","fabric"],["poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate"]],"members":["filter","shrinkage"],"related":["Fiber","Polymer","Ester","Functional_group","Polyethylene_terephthalate","Cutin","Plant_cuticle","Step-growth_polymerization","Polycarbonate","Polybutyrate","Thermoplastic","Thermoset","Polyester_resin","Fabrics","Tarpaulin","Liquid_crystal_display","Hologram","Filter_(chemistry)","Dielectric","Capacitor","Electrical_insulation","Wire","Insulating_tape","Guitar","Piano","Thixotropic","Cotton","Wool","Liquid_crystal_polymer","Tenacity","Young's_modulus","Shrinkage_(fabric)","Polyester_resin","Resin","Casting","Fiberglass","Polyglycolide","Polycondensation","Glycolic_acid","Polylactic_acid","Ring-opening_polymerization","Lactide","Polycaprolactone","Caprolactone","Polyethylene_adipate","Polyhydroxyalkanoate","Polyhydroxybutyrate","Poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate)","Copolymerization","3-hydroxybutanoic_acid","3-hydroxypentanoic_acid","Butyrolactone","Valerolactone","Aluminoxane","Polyethylene_terephthalate","Terephthalic_acid","Ethylene_glycol","Polybutylene_terephthalate","1,4-butanediol","Polytrimethylene_terephthalate","1,3-propanediol","Polyethylene_naphthalate","Naphthalene","Dicarboxylic_acid","Vectran","4-hydroxybenzoic_acid","Glass_transition_temperature","Thermostability","Telechelic","Oligomer","Prepolymer","Purified_terephthalic_acid","Dimethyl_terephthalate","Monoethylene_glycol","Polyethylene","Polypropylene","Molecular_weight","Antimony_trioxide","Textile","Packaging","Masterbatch","Horizontal_integration","Condensation_reaction","Alcohol","Carboxylic_acid","Azeotrope","Methanol","Hydrochloric_acid","Vitreous_enamel","Aliphatic","Lactone","Anionic","Cationic","Metallorganic","Diol","Maleic_acid","Fumaric_acid","Anhydride","Vinyl","Styrene","Cross-link","Exothermic","Organic_peroxide","Methyl_ethyl_ketone_peroxide","Benzoyl_peroxide","Oligoester","Polyester_resin"]}
