The impact of glaciers on people includes the fields of\nhuman geography and anthropology. The discoveries of water ice on the Moon, Mars\nand Europa add an extraterrestrial component to the field, as in\n\"astroglaciology\".\n","linknr":398,"url":"Glaciology","recorded":1362371924,"links":69,"instances":["physics","deformation","landform","moon","glaciation","meteorology","geology","geology","lake"],"pdf":["http://www.igsoc.org/annals/9/igs_annals_vol09_year1987_pg254-255.pdf","http://www.igsoc.org/annals/9/igs_annals_vol09_year1987_pg254-255.pdf"],"categories":["Glaciology|","Physical geography"],"headings":["Overview","Types","Zones of glaciers","Movement","Glacial deposits","See also","Notes","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7d/Glacier.zermatt.arp.750pix.jpg/250px-Glacier.zermatt.arp.750pix.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/YosemiteFromPlane.JPG/220px-YosemiteFromPlane.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/Land_ocean_ice_cloud_hires.jpg/110px-Land_ocean_ice_cloud_hires.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/Land_ocean_ice_cloud_hires.jpg/110px-Land_ocean_ice_cloud_hires.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["europa","moon"],["precipitation","meteorology"],["arete","landform"],["creep","deformation"],["stress","physics"],["plucking","glaciation"],["cohesion","geology"],["tarn","lake"],["kettle","geology"]],"members":["stress","creep","arete","europa","plucking","precipitation","kettle","cohesion","tarn"],"related":["Gorner_Glacier","Zermatt","Swiss_Alps","Glacier","Ice","Earth_science","Geophysics","Geology","Physical_geography","Geomorphology","Climatology","Meteorology","Hydrology","Biology","Ecology","Human_geography","Anthropology","Moon","Mars","Europa_(moon)","Topography","Arête","Greenland","Antarctica","Ablation","Ice_calving","Ablation_zone","Precipitation_(meteorology)","Arete_(landform)","Bergshrund","Cirque","Creep_(deformation)","Stress_(physics)","Molecule","Fluid_mechanics","Fracture","Pyramidal_peak","Headward_erosion","Plucking_(glaciation)","Adhesion","Cohesion_(geology)","Tarn_(lake)","Tunnel_valley","Kettle_(geology)","Esker","Kame","Varve","Proglacial_lake","Till","Moraine","Drumlin","Ribbed_moraines","Cryopediology","International_Glaciological_Society","International_Association_of_Cryospheric_Sciences","Irish_Sea_Glacier","List_of_glaciers","Cryosphere","London","Berlin","Springer_Science+Business_Media","Cambridge","New_York_City","Cambridge_University_Press","Oxford","Rotterdam"]}
