Language acquisition usually refers to 'first-language\nacquisition', which studies infants' acquisition of their native language. This\nis distinguished from [[second-language acquisition]], which deals with the\nacquisition (in both children and adults) of additional languages.\n\nThe capacity to successfully use language requires one to acquire a range of\ntools including phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, and an extensive\nvocabulary. Language might be vocalized as speech or manual as in sign. The\nhuman language capacity is represented in the brain. Even though the human\nlanguage capacity is finite, one can say and understand an infinite number of\nsentences, which is based on a syntactic principle called Recursion. Evidence\nsuggests that every individual has three recursive mechanisms that allow\nsentences to go indeterminately. These three mechanisms are: relativization,\ncomplementation and coordination.\n\nThe capacity to acquire and use language is a key aspect that distinguishes\nhumans from other beings. Although it is difficult to pin down what aspects of\nlanguage are uniquely human, there are a few design features that can be found\nin all known forms of human language, but that are missing from forms of animal\ncommunication. For example, many animals are able to communicate with each other\nby signaling to the things around them, but this kind of communication lacks the\narbitrariness of human vernaculars (in that there is nothing about the sound of\nthe word \"dog\" that would hint at its meaning). Other forms of animal\ncommunication may utilize arbitrary sounds, but are unable to combine those\nsounds in different ways to create completely novel messages that can then be\nautomatically understood by another. Hockett called this design feature of human\nlanguage \"productivity\". It is crucial to the understanding of human language\nacquisition that we are not limited to a finite set of words, but, rather, must\nbe able to understand and utilize a complex system that allows for an infinite\nnumber of possible messages. So, while many forms of animal communication exist,\nthey differ from human languages, in that they have a limited range of non-\nsyntactically structured vocabulary tokens that lack cross cultural variation\nbetween groups.\n\nA major question in understanding language acquisition is how these capacities\nare picked up by infants from the linguistic input. Input in the linguistic\ncontext is defined as \"All words, contexts, and other forms of language to which\na learner is exposed, relative to acquired proficiency in first or second\nlanguages\". Nativists find it difficult to believe, considering the hugely\ncomplex nature of human languages, and the relatively limited cognitive\nabilities of an infant, that infants are able to acquire most aspects of\nlanguage without being explicitly taught. Children, within a few years of birth,\nunderstand the grammatical rules of their native language without being\nexplicitly taught, as one learns grammar in school. A range of theories of language acquisition have been proposed in\norder to explain this apparent problem. These theories, championed by the likes\nof Noam Chomsky and others, include innatism and Psychological nativism, in\nwhich a child is born prepared in some manner with these capacities, as opposed\nto other theories in which language is simply learned as other cognitive skills,\nincluding such mundane motor skills as learning to ride a bike. The conflict\nbetween the theories assuming humans are born with syntactic knowledge and those\nthat claim all such knowledge is the product of learning from one's environment\nis often referred to as the \"Nature vs. Nurture\" debate. Some think that there\nare some qualities of language acquisition that the human brain is automatically\nwired for (a \"nature\" component) and some that are shaped by the particular\nlanguage environment in which a person is raised (a \"nurture\" component).\nOthers, especially evolutionary biologists, strongly object to assuming\nsyntactic knowledge is genetically encoded and provided by automatic wiring of\nthe brain.\n","linknr":630,"url":"Language_acquisition","recorded":1362373305,"links":54,"instances":["psychology","linguistics","language","language_use","linguistics"],"pdf":["http://www.ling.hawaii.edu/faculty/ogrady/Innateness,_UG,_Emergentism.pdf","http://www.ling.hawaii.edu/faculty/ogrady/Innateness,_UG,_Emergentism.pdf","http://hum.uchicago.edu/~jriggle/SP05.pdf","http://hum.uchicago.edu/~jriggle/SP05.pdf","http://bura.brunel.ac.uk/bitstream/2438/731/1/oi-paper-all.pdf","http://bura.brunel.ac.uk/bitstream/2438/731/1/oi-paper-all.pdf","http://bura.brunel.ac.uk/bitstream/2438/618/1/DevSci_revised-final.pdf","http://bura.brunel.ac.uk/bitstream/2438/618/1/DevSci_revised-final.pdf","http://www.pallier.org/papers/Pallier.critical.period.attrition.chapter.2007.pdf","http://www.pallier.org/papers/Pallier.critical.period.attrition.chapter.2007.pdf","http://www.york.ac.uk/res/wml/Gathercole06%20Applied%20PsyLinguistics.pdf","http://www.york.ac.uk/res/wml/Gathercole06%20Applied%20PsyLinguistics.pdf","http://www.edtechpolicy.org/AAASGW/Session2/landauer_article.pdf","http://www.edtechpolicy.org/AAASGW/Session2/landauer_article.pdf","https://www.im.wiwi.uni-goettingen.de/de/document/download/c2d41d9460ea481f320dc7876c42ec67.pdf/Markman_1990.pdf","https://www.im.wiwi.uni-goettingen.de/de/document/download/c2d41d9460ea481f320dc7876c42ec67.pdf/Markman_1990.pdf"],"categories":["Language acquisition|","Linguistics","Applied linguistics"],"headings":["History","General approaches","Syntax and morphology","Representation of language acquisition in the brain","Vocabulary acquisition","Meaning","Neurocognitive research","Language acquisition and prelingual deafness","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["sentence","linguistics"],["morphology","linguistics"],["context","language_use"],["chunking","psychology#chunking_as_the_learning_of_long-term_memory_structures"],["chunking","psychology"],["passive_speakers","language"]],"members":["chunking","sentence","passive_speakers","context","morphology"],"related":["Word","Sentence_(linguistics)","Phonology","Morphology_(linguistics)","Syntax","Semantics","Vocabulary","Sign_language","Recursion","Animal_communication","Charles_F._Hockett","Infant","Context_(language_use)","Second_language","Psychological_nativism","Cognitive_abilities","Grammar","Noam_Chomsky","Innatism","Psychological_nativism","Nature_vs._Nurture","Empirical_methods","Plato","Sanskrit_grammarians","Thomas_Hobbes","John_Locke","Rudolf_Carnap","Behaviorism","Operant_conditioning","B._F._Skinner","Lexical_unit","Reinforcement","Operant_conditioning","Empiricism","Statistical_learning_theory","Relational_Frame_Theory","Functionalist_linguistics","Social_interactionist_theory","Noam_Chomsky","Syntactic_Structures","Scaffold","Lev_Vygotsky","Lev_Vygotsky","Jerome_Bruner","Relational_frame_theory","B._F._Skinner","Behaviorism","Functional_contextualism","Operant_conditioning","Emergentism","Brian_MacWhinney","Competition_model","Cognitive_process","Vocabulary_development","Syntax","Syntax","Irregular_verbs","Generative_grammar","Noam_Chomsky","Principles_and_Parameters","Poverty_of_the_stimulus","Corrective_feedback","Jerry_Fodor","Eric_Lenneberg","Psychological_nativism","Universal_grammar","Generative_grammar","Language_Acquisition_Device","Melissa_Bowerman","Jean_Piaget","Elizabeth_Bates","David_M_W_Powers","Elizabeth_Bates","Catherine_E._Snow","Anat_Ninio","Brian_MacWhinney","Michael_Tomasello","Geoffrey_Pullum","Geoffrey_Pullum","Cognitive_Linguistics","Statistical_learning","Elissa_L._Newport","Jenny_Saffran","Learning","Connectionist","Max_Planck_Institute_for_Evolutionary_Anthropology","Functional_neuroimaging","Developmental_psychology","Neuroscience","Sensitive_period","Language_deprivation_experiments","Feral_child","Speech_repetition","Latent_semantic_analysis","Heuristic","Ellen_Markman","ROBO1","FMRI","Positron_emission_tomography","Kuniyoshi_Sakai","Premotor_cortex","Cerebral_cortex","Chunking_(psychology)","Creole_language","Fis_phenomenon","Glossary_of_language_teaching_terms_and_ideas","Language_development","List_of_language_acquisition_researchers","Metalinguistic_awareness","Origin_of_language","Passive_speakers_(language)","Second-language_attrition","Spoken_language"]}
