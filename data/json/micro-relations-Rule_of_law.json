Black's Law Dictionary, Abridged\n9th Edition, p. 1137. (West Publishing Company, 2010). ISBN 978-0-314-26578-\n4 The phrase can be traced back to the 17th century, and it was\npopularized in the 19th century by British jurist A. V. Dicey. The concept was\nfamiliar to ancient philosophers such as Aristotle, who wrote \"Law should\ngovern\". Rule of law implies that every citizen is subject to\nthe law. It stands in contrast to the idea that the ruler is above the law, for\nexample by divine right.\n\nDespite wide use by politicians, judges and academics, the rule of law has been\ndescribed as \"an exceedingly elusive notion\" {{Cite book\n  | last = Tamanaha first = Brian Z. title = On the Rule of Law publisher =\n  | Cambridge University Press year = 2004 page = 9\n |ref=harv }} giving rise to a \"rampant divergence of understandings ...\n everyone is for it but have contrasting convictions about what it is.\"\n\nAt least two principal conceptions of the rule of law can be identified: a\nformalist or \"thin\" definition, and a substantive or \"thick\" definition.\nFormalist definitions of the rule of law do not make a judgment about the\n\"justness\" of law itself, but define specific procedural attributes that a legal\nframework must have in order to be in compliance with the rule of law.\nSubstantive conceptions of the rule of law go beyond this and include certain\nsubstantive rights that are said to be based on, or derived from, the rule of\nlaw. {{Cite journal\n  | last = Craig first = Paul P. title = Formal and substantive conceptions of\n  | the
