Parliament, which consists\nof the House of Lords and the elected House of Commons, was convened by Queen\nElizabeth II, as monarch on 25 May 2010 at the Palace of Westminster and its\ndissolution is set to be on 13 April 2015, being 17 working days ahead of the\n2015 general election on 7 May 2015.\n\nThe election saw each of Parliament's 650 constituencies return one MP to the\nHouse of Commons. The Conservative Party, led by David Cameron, became the\nsingle largest party, though without an overall majority. This resulted in a\nhung parliament. A coalition agreement was then formed following negotiations\nwith Liberal Democrats and their leader Nick Clegg. John Bercow resumed his role\nas Speaker of the House of Commons. In September 2010, Ed Miliband won a Labour\nParty leadership vote to succeed Gordon Brown as permanent leader of the\nopposition.\n\nIn the House of Lords, Baroness Hayman (ex-Labour) resumed her role as Lord\nSpeaker until the end of her five year term in 2011, after which she did not\nseek re-election in the house. Peers elected Baroness D'Souza (ex-Crossbench) to\nreplace her. From the start of this Parliament the Lords were \"led\" by Lord\nStrathclyde without an absolute majority on his Conservative benches. In January\n2013 he stood down and was succeeded by Lord Hill of Oareford.\n\nNew MPs elected since the general election, as well as changes in party\nallegiance, are noted at the bottom of this page. The current status of the\nHouse of Commons can be seen at . That of the House of Lords can be seen at\nMembers of the House of Lords.\n","linknr":3274,"url":"List_of_MPs_elected_in_the_United_Kingdom_general_election,_2010","recorded":1374862128,"links":["/w/index.php?title=List_of_MPs_elected_in_the_United_Kingdom_general_election,_2010&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=List_of_MPs_elected_in_the_United_Kingdom_general_election,_2010&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Palace_of_Westminster.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/68/Palace_of_Westminster.jpg/235px-Palace_of_Westminster.jpg","/wiki/Palace_of_Westminster","/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_2010","/wiki/Next_United_Kingdom_general_election","/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_Kingdom_House_of_Commons","/wiki/John_Bercow","/wiki/Leader_of_the_House_of_Commons","/wiki/Andrew_Lansley","/wiki/Sir_George_Young,_6th_Baronet","/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/David_Cameron","/wiki/Leader_of_the_Opposition_(United_Kingdom)","/wiki/Ed_Miliband","/wiki/Harriet_Harman","/wiki/Third_party_(politics)","/wiki/Nick_Clegg","/wiki/Lord_Speaker","/wiki/Frances_D%27Souza,_Baroness_D%27Souza","/wiki/H%C3%A9l%C3%A8ne_Hayman,_Baroness_Hayman","/wiki/Leader_of_the_House_of_Lords","/wiki/Jonathan_Hill,_Baron_Hill_of_Oareford","/wiki/Thomas_Galbraith,_2nd_Baron_Strathclyde","/wiki/Leader_of_the_Opposition_(United_Kingdom)","/wiki/Janet_Royall,_Baroness_Royall_of_Blaisdon","/wiki/Third_party_(politics)","/wiki/Tom_McNally,_Baron_McNally","/wiki/State_Opening_of_Parliament","/wiki/54th_Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/56th_Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/United_Kingdom","/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_2010","/wiki/Member_of_Parliament","/wiki/House_of_Commons_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/House_of_Lords","/wiki/State_Opening_of_Parliament","/wiki/Elizabeth_II","/wiki/Monarchy_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Palace_of_Westminster","/wiki/Dissolution_of_Parliament#United_Kingdom","/wiki/Next_United_Kingdom_general_election","/wiki/List_of_United_Kingdom_Parliament_constituencies","/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)","/wiki/David_Cameron","/wiki/Hung_parliament","/wiki/Conservative_%E2%80%93_Liberal_Democrat_coalition_agreement","/wiki/Liberal_Democrats","/wiki/Nick_Clegg","/wiki/John_Bercow","/wiki/Speaker_of_the_House_of_Commons_(United_Kingdom)","/wiki/Ed_Miliband","/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)","/wiki/Gordon_Brown","/wiki/H%C3%A9l%C3%A8ne_Hayman,_Baroness_Hayman","/wiki/Lord_Speaker","/wiki/Frances_D%27Souza,_Baroness_D%27Souza","/wiki/Thomas_Galbraith,_2nd_Baron_Strathclyde","/wiki/Absolute_majority","/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)","/wiki/Jonathan_Hill,_Baron_Hill_of_Oareford","#Changes_and_by-elections","/wiki/Template:British_House_of_Commons_composition","/wiki/Members_of_the_House_of_Lords","#Graphical_representation_of_the_House_of_Commons","#List_of_MPs_elected_in_the_general_election","#Changes_and_by-elections","#Deputy_Speakers","#By-elections","#Defections.2C_suspensions_and_removal_of_whip","#See_also","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=List_of_MPs_elected_in_the_United_Kingdom_general_election,_2010&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/File:Parliament2010UK.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Parliament2010UK.svg/739px-Parliament2010UK.svg.png","/wiki/File:UK_Parlaiment_2010_Key.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b7/UK_Parlaiment_2010_Key.png","/w/index.php?title=List_of_MPs_elected_in_the_United_Kingdom_general_election,_2010&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Boundary_changes_for_the_United_Kingdom_general_election,_2010","/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_2005","/wiki/Incumbent","/wiki/Aberavon_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)","/wiki/Hywel_Francis","/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)","/wiki/Aberconwy_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)","/wiki/Guto_Bebb","/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)","/wiki/Aberdeen_North_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)","/wiki/Frank_Doran_(UK_politician)","/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)","/wiki/Aberdeen_South_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)","/wiki/Anne_Begg","/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)","/wiki/Airdrie_and_Shotts_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)","/wiki/Pamela_Nash","/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)","/wiki/John_Rei
