Cartesian doubt is also\nknown as 'Cartesian skepticism', 'methodic doubt', 'methodological skepticism',\nor 'hyperbolic doubt'.\n\nCartesian doubt is a systematic process of being skeptical about (or doubting)\nthe truth of one's beliefs, which has become a characteristic method in\nphilosophy. This method of doubt was largely popularized in Western philosophy\nby RenÃ© Descartes (1596-1650), who sought to doubt the truth of all his beliefs\nin order to determine which beliefs he could be certain were true.\n\nMethodological skepticism is distinguished from philosophical skepticism in that\nmethodological skepticism is an approach that subjects all knowledge claims to\nscrutiny with the goal of sorting out true from false claims, whereas\nphilosophical skepticism is an approach that questions the possibility of\nknowledge.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Cartesian_doubt_","recorded":1372154926,"links":[],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Epistemology","Skepticism","René Descartes","Philosophy of science","Philosophical methodology","Theories of mind","Epistemological theories","Epistemology of science"],"headings":["Characteristics","Technique","Descartes' method","I think, therefore I am","Criticisms","See also","References","References and further reading","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["René_Descartes","Philosophy","René_Descartes","Philosophical_skepticism","Philosophical_skepticism","Basic_beliefs","Rationalism","René_Descartes","Roger_Scruton","Evil_demon","Falsifiability","Empirical","Karl_Popper","Egocentric_predicament","Incontrovertible_evidence"]}
