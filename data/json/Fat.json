Chemically, fats are\ntriglycerides, triesters of glycerol and any of several fatty acids. Fats may be\neither solid or liquid at room temperature, depending on their structure and\ncomposition. Although the words \"oils\", \"fats\", and \"lipids\" are all used to\nrefer to fats. However, in reality, fat is a subset of lipid. . \"Oils\"\nis usually used to refer to fats that are liquids at normal room temperature,\nwhile \"fats\" is usually used to refer to fats that are solids at normal room\ntemperature. \"Lipids\" is used to refer to both liquid and solid fats, along with\nother related substances, usually in a medical or biochemical context. The word\n\"oil\" is also used for any substance that does not mix with water and has a\ngreasy feel, such as petroleum (or crude oil), heating oil, and essential oils,\nregardless of its chemical structure. {{cite book\n  | last = Maton first = Anthea authorlink = coauthors = Jean Hopkins, Charles\n  | William McLaughlin, Susan Johnson, Maryanna Quon Warner, David LaHart, Jill\n  | D.

This category of molecules is\nimportant for many forms of life, serving both structural and metabolic\nfunctions. They are an important part of the diet of most heterotrophs\n(including humans). Fats or lipids are broken down in the body by enzymes\ncalled lipases produced in the pancreas.\n\nExamples of edible animal fats are lard, fish oil, butter/ghee and whale\nblubber. They are obtained from fats in the milk and meat, as well as from under\nthe skin, of an animal. Examples of edible plant fats include peanut, soya bean,\nsunflower, sesame, coconut and olive oils, and cocoa butter. Vegetable\nshortening, used mainly for baking, and margarine, used in baking and as a\nspread, can be derived from the above oils by hydrogenation.\n\nThese examples of fats can be categorized into saturated fats and unsaturated\nfats. Unsaturated fats can be further divided into cis fats, which are the most\ncommon in nature, and trans fats, which are rare in nature but present in\npartially hydrogenated vegetable oils.\n","linknr":307,"url":"Fat","recorded":1362511204,"links":75,"instances":["disambiguation","nutrition"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Nutrition","Macromolecules"],"headings":["Chemical structure","Importance for living organisms","Adipose tissue","See also","References","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/Padlock-silver.svg/20px-Padlock-silver.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/64/Trimyristin-3D-vdW.png/350px-Trimyristin-3D-vdW.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8d/Triglyceride_Structural_Formulae_V.1.png/350px-Triglyceride_Structural_Formulae_V.1.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0b/Fatmouse.jpg/220px-Fatmouse.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Wikibooks-logo-en-noslogan.svg/40px-Wikibooks-logo-en-noslogan.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["oil","disambiguation"],["diet","nutrition"]],"members":["oil","diet"],"related":["Chemistry","Triglyceride","Ester","Glycerol","Fatty_acid","Solid","Liquid","Room_temperature","Lipid","Oil_(disambiguation)","Petroleum","Heating_oil","Essential_oils","Lipid","Chemical_structure","Diet_(nutrition)","Heterotroph","Lipase","Pancreas","Lard","Fish_oil","Butter","Ghee","Whale_blubber","Vegetable_fats_and_oils","Cocoa_butter","Vegetable_shortening","Margarine","Hydrogenation","Saturated_fat","Unsaturated_fat","Cis_fat","Trans_fat","Double_bond","Fatty_acid","Glycerol","Ester","Bond_angle","Chemical_bond","Van_der_Waals_forces","Melting_point","Energy","Saturated_Fat","Covalent_bond","Double_bond","Monounsaturated_fatty_acid","Polyunsaturated_fatty_acid","Hydrogenation","Margarine","Tallow","Lard","Trans_fat","Coronary_heart_disease","Vitamin","Vitamin_A","Vitamin_D","Vitamin_E","Vitamin_K","Essential_fatty_acid","Skin","Hair","Kilo-","Joule","Calorie","Gram","NASA","Glycerin","Fatty_acid","Glucose","Excretion","Urination","Bloodletting","Sebum","Hair","Mouse","Adipose_tissue","Physiological","Adipocytes","Metabolism","Fatty_acids","Glycerol","Circulatory_system","Insulin","Glucagon","Epinephrine","Hormone","Resistin","Animal_fat","Brown_fat","Carbohydrate","Dieting","Fat_content_of_milk","Food_composition","Human_weight","Lipid","National_Association_to_Advance_Fat_Acceptance","National_Weight_Control_Registry","Obesity","Omega-3_fatty_acid","Omega-6_fatty_acid","Trans-fats","Vegetable_fats_and_oils","Adipocyte","Yellow_grease","San_Francisco"]}
