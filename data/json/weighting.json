That is, rather than each variable in the data\ncontributing equally to the final result, some data are adjusted to contribute\nmore than others. It is analogous to the practice of adding extra weight to one\nside of a pair of scales to favour a buyer or seller.\n\nWhile weighting may be applied to a set of data, such as epidemiological data,\nit is more commonly applied to measurements of light, heat, sound, gamma\nradiation, in fact any stimulus that is spread over a spectrum of frequencies.\n","title":"weighting","headings":["Weighting and loudness","Weighting in audio measurement","Weighting and gamma rays","Weighting and television colour components","Weighting and UV factor derivation for sun exposure","Weighting in 3D modeling and animation","See also","External links"]},"micro-relation":["3: A-weighting","2: Weighting_filter","2: Phon","1: Gamma_radiation","1: Spectrum","1: Loudness","1: 468-weighting","1: Noise_band","1: Rumble_measurement","1: Flutter_measurement","1: KHz","1: Equal-loudness_contours","1: Sievert","1: Chrominance","1: UV_Index","1: Equal-loudness_contour","1: ITU-R_468_noise_weighting","1: Psophometric_weighting","1: Audio_quality_measurement","1: UV_index"]}
