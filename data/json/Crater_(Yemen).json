Its official name is 'Seera' (Arabic: ØµÙØ±Ø©\ná¹¢Ä«rah). It is situated in a crater of an ancient volcano which forms the Shamsan\nMountains. In 1991, the population was 70,319.\n\nIn the closing days of British rule in 1967, Crater District became the focus of\nthe Aden Emergency, sometimes called the last imperial war. Against a scene of\nrival Arab nationalists competing for sovereignty, a Scottish infantry battalion\nmarched into the Crater with a pipe-band playing traditional regimental tunes,\nand managed to occupy the whole district overnight without a single casualty -\nan achievement which the top brass had declared impossible. To the British at\nhome, now able to view military operations live from the battlefield for the\nfirst time, this made a dramatic finale to the imperial story, and the officer\nwho led the invasion (Lt. Col. Colin Mitchell of the Argyll & Sutherland\nHighlanders) went down in history with the affectionate nickname Mad Mitch.\n","linknr":106,"url":"Crater_(Yemen)","recorded":1362900555,"links":19,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Aden","Populated places in 'Adan Governorate","Port cities in the Arabian Peninsula","Populated coastal places in Yemen"],"headings":["External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/Mergefrom.svg/50px-Mergefrom.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0c/Aden_crater.jpg/200px-Aden_crater.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e9/Flag-map_of_Yemen.svg/35px-Flag-map_of_Yemen.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Aden","Aden_Emergency","Colin_Mitchell"]}
