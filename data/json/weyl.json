Although much of his working life was spent in Zürich, Switzerland\nand then Princeton, he is associated with the University of Göttingen tradition\nof mathematics, represented by David Hilbert and Hermann Minkowski. His research\nhas had major significance for theoretical physics as well as purely\nmathematical disciplines including number theory. He was one of the most\ninfluential mathematicians of the twentieth century, and an important member of\nthe Institute for Advanced Study during its early\nyears.<ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref>\n\nWeyl published technical and some general works on space, time, matter,\nphilosophy, logic, symmetry and the history of mathematics. He was one of the\nfirst to conceive of combining general relativity with the laws of\nelectromagnetism. While no mathematician of his generation aspired to the\n'universalism' of Henri Poincaré or Hilbert, Weyl came as close as anyone.\nMichael Atiyah, in particular, has commented that whenever he examined a\nmathematical topic, he found that Weyl had preceded him (The Mathematical\nIntelligencer (1984), vol.6 no.1).\n","title":"Hermann%20Weyl","headings":["Biography","Contributions","Quotes","Topics named after Hermann Weyl","References","Further reading","External links"]},"micro-relation":["4: Germany","4: University_of_GÃ¶ttingen","3: Elmshorn","3: Switzerland","3: Institute_for_Advanced_Study","3: David_Hilbert","3: General_relativity","3: Weyl_quantization","3: Weyl_sum","2: Zurich","2: ETH_Zurich","2: Edmund_Husserl","2: Princeton,_New_Jersey","2: Theoretical_physics","2: Weyl_law","2: Cartan_connection_applications","2: Compact_Lie_group","2: Exponential_sum","1: Mathematical_physics","1: Alexander_Weinstein","1: Saunders_Mac_Lane","1: List_of_topics_named_after_Hermann_Weyl","1: Stanford_Encyclopedia_of_Philosophy","1: L._E._J._Brouwer","1: Fellow_of_the_Royal_Society","1: Pantheist","1: ForMemRS","1: Mathematician","1: Theoretical_physicist","1: Philosopher","1: ZÃ¼rich","1: Hermann_Minkowski","1: Number_theory","1: Space","1: Time","1: Matter","1: Philosophy","1: Logic","1: Symmetry","1: History_of_mathematics","1: Electromagnetism","1: Henri_PoincarÃ©","1: Michael_Atiyah","1: Hamburg","1: Christianeum","1: Altona,_Hamburg","1: GÃ¶ttingen","1: Munich","1: Albert_Einstein","1: Erwin_SchrÃ¶dinger","1: University_of_ZÃ¼rich","1: Weyl_law#Weyl_conjecture","1: Riemann_surface","1: Point_set_topology","1: Manifold","1: Luitzen_Egbertus_Jan_Brouwer","1: Gauge_theory","1: Electromagnetic_field","1: Gravitational_field","1: Spacetime","1: Riemannian_geometry","1: Gottlob_Frege","1: Scientific_formalism","1: Compact_group","1: Representation_theory","1: Weyl's_character_formula","1: Quantum_mechanics","1: Spinor","1: Mathematical_formulation_of_quantum_mechanics","1: John_von_Neumann","1: Heisenberg_group","1: Lie_algebra","1: Pure_mathematics","1: Invariant_theory","1: Symmetric_group","1: General_linear_group","1: Orthogonal_group","1: Symplectic_group","1: Group_representation","1: Diophantine_approximation","1: Equidistributed_mod_1","1: Analytic_number_theory","1: Riemann_zeta_function","1: Additive_number_theory","1: Impredicativity","1: Bertrand_Russell","1: Ramified_theory_of_types","1: Axiom_of_choice","1: Proof_by_contradiction","1: Georg_Cantor","1: Infinite_set","1: Fichte","1: Intuitionism","1: George_PÃ³lya","1: Real_number","1: Countable","1: Truth","1: Least_upper_bound","1: Georg_Wilhelm_Friedrich_Hegel","1: Kurt_GÃ¶del","1: Husserl","1: Ernst_Cassirer","1: Impredicative_definition","1: Majorana&ndash;Weyl_spinor","1: SchurâWeyl_duality","1: Weyl_algebra","1: Weyl_basis","1: Gamma_matrices","1: Weyl_chamber","1: Weyl_character_formula","1: Weyl's_criterion","1: Weyl_curvature","1: Weyl_curvature_hypothesis","1: Weyl_dimension_formula","1: Weyl_equation","1: Relativistic_wave_equation","1: Conformal_gravity","1: Weyl_group","1: Weyl_gauge","1: Weyl's_inequality","1: Weyl_integral","1: Hypoellipticity","1: Laplace_equation","1: Weyl_module","1: Weyl_notation","1: Weyl's_paradox","1: Grelling&ndash;Nelson_paradox","1: Weyl's_postulate","1: Weyl_scalar","1: Weyl_spinor","1: Weyl_symmetry","1: Weyl_tensor","1: Weyl's_theorem_on_complete_reducibility","1: Weyl_transform","1: Weyl's_unitary_trick","1: Weyl_vector","1: PeterâWeyl_theorem","1: WeylâSchouten_theorem","1: Weyl_transformation","1: Frank_Wilczek","1: Ivor_Grattan-Guinness","1: Erhard_Scholz","1: John_Lane_Bell"]}
