This is often characterized by a kind of behavior that\nallows an individual to change an unconstructive or disruptive behavior to\nsomething more constructive. These behaviors are most often social or personal\nbehaviors. For example a constant repetitive action could be re-focused on\nsomething that creates or builds something. In other words the behavior can be\nadapted to something else.\n\nMaladaptive behavior is a type of behavior that is often used to reduce one's\nanxiety, but the result is dysfunctional and non-productive. For example,\navoiding situations because you have unrealistic fears may initially reduce your\nanxiety, but it is non-productive in alleviating the actual problem in the long\nterm. Maladaptivity is frequently used as an indicator of abnormality or mental\ndysfunction, since its assessment is relatively free from subjectivity. However,\nmany behaviors considered moral can be apparently maladaptive, such as dissent\nor abstinence.\n\nAdaptive behavior reflects an individual’s social and practical competence of\ndaily skills to meet the demands of everyday living. Behaviors change\nthroughout development, across life settings and cultures, and through social\nconstructs and expectations of others. It is important to assess adaptive\nbehavior in addition to IQ in order to determine how well an individual\nfunctions in daily life.\n","title":"Adaptive%20behavior","headings":["Scope (general definition)","Determination","Specialized behavior","See also","References"]},"micro-relation":["1: Behavior","1: Individual","1: Mental_dysfunction","1: Subjectivity","1: Morality","1: Dissent","1: Abstinence","1: Moral_responsibility","1: Social_group","1: Parent","1: Mental_disability","1: Built_environment","1: Skills","1: Activities_of_daily_living","1: Adaptive_behaviors","1: Moral_character"]}
