BYU has 21 NCAA varsity athletic\nteams. [http://www.byucougars.com/athletic_department/quick_facts.jsp\nBYUCougars.com quick facts sheet]  They are a member of the West Coast\nConference for most sports. Other sports compete in the Mountain Pacific Sports\nFederation, the Pacific Coast Softball Conference, and as independents. They were\na member of the Mountain West Conference (MW) from its formation in 1999 until\nleaving in 2011 as part of a major NCAA conference realignment. Before the\nformation of the MW, the Cougars competed in the Rocky Mountain Athletic\nConference, the Mountain States Conference, and the Western Athletic Conference.\n\nAll teams are named the \"Cougars\", a name that was first introduced by Eugene L.\nRoberts in the 1920s, initially only applied to the football team. In 1924 two\nlive cougar kittens named Cleo and Tarbo were brought to BYU and used as its\nmascots. In 1930 Tarbo died and Cleo was sent to the Hogle Zoo in Salt Lake City. [http://lib.byu.edu/sites/byuhistory/2009/05/14/go-\ncougars/ BYU special collections reference page on Cleo and Tarbo] By the\n1950s all sports teams were known as the cougars and it was decided that having\na person in a costume was a better mascot form than live animals. In 1953 Cosmo\nthe Cougar was created by Dwayne\nStevenson. [http://yfacts.byu.edu/viewarticle.aspx?id=119 BYU webpage on\nCosmo] The school's fight song is the \"Cougar Fight Song\".\n\nBYU is owned and operated by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\n(LDS Church), and the overwhelming majority of its students are members of that\nchurch. Because many of its players serve on full-time missions for two years,\nBYU's athletes are often older on average than other school's players. The NCAA\nallows students to serve missions for two years without subtracting that time\nfrom their eligibility period. This has caused minor controversy, but is largely\nrecognized as not lending the school any significant advantage, since players\nreceive no athletic and little physical training during their\nmissions. BYU has also received attention from sports networks for\nrefusal to play games on Sunday, as well as expelling players due to honor code\nviolations.\n","linknr":577,"url":"BYU_Cougars","recorded":1363582891,"links":["/w/index.php?title=BYU_Cougars&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=BYU_Cougars&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/File:BYU_Athletic_Logo.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/16/BYU_Athletic_Logo.svg/180px-BYU_Athletic_Logo.svg.png","/wiki/Brigham_Young_University","/wiki/West_Coast_Conference","/wiki/Mountain_Pacific_Sports_Federation","/wiki/Pacific_Coast_Softball_Conference","/wiki/Division_I_(NCAA)","/wiki/Tom_Holmoe","/wiki/Provo,_Utah","/wiki/Utah","/wiki/LaVell_Edwards_Stadium","/wiki/Marriott_Center","/wiki/Larry_H._Miller_Field","/wiki/Cosmo_the_Cougar","/wiki/The_Cougar_Song","http://www.byucougars.com/","/wiki/College","/wiki/Sport","/wiki/Brigham_Young_University","/wiki/Provo,_Utah","/wiki/Utah","#cite_note-1","/wiki/West_Coast_Conference","/wiki/Mountain_Pacific_Sports_Federation","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Pacific_Coast_Softball_Conference","#cite_note-PCSC-3","#cite_note-Rothlisburger-4","/wiki/Mountain_West_Conference","/wiki/2010%E2%80%9312_NCAA_conference_realignment#BYU","/wiki/Rocky_Mountain_Athletic_Conference","/wiki/Mountain_States_Conference","/wiki/Western_Athletic_Conference","/wiki/Eugene_L._Roberts","/wiki/Hogle_Zoo","/wiki/Salt_Lake_City","#cite_note-5","/wiki/Cosmo_the_Cougar","#cite_note-6","/wiki/The_Cougar_Song_(BYU)","/wiki/The_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints","/wiki/Missionary_(LDS_Church)","#cite_note-7","/wiki/2010%E2%80%9311_BYU_Cougars_men%27s_basketball_team#Davies_controversy","/wiki/Brigham_Young_University_Honor_Code","#cite_note-8","#cite_note-brandondavies-9","#Athletics","#Cross_country","#Track_and_Field","#Baseball","#Basketball","#Men.27s_basketball","#Women.27s_basketball","#Football","#Ice_hockey","#Lacrosse","#Racquetball","#Rugby","#Soccer","#Men.27s_soccer","#Women.27s_soccer","#Volleyball","#Other_sports","#Former_programs","#Budget","#National_Championships","#See_also","#Notes","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=BYU_Cougars&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=BYU_Cougars&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Ed_Eyestone","/wiki/Josh_Rohatinsky","#cite_note-10","/w/index.php?title=BYU_Cougars&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/wiki/Miles_Batty","/w/index.php?title=Leif_Arrhenius&action=edit&redlink=1","#cite_note-11","/w/index.php?title=BYU_Cougars&action=edit&section=4","#cite_note-12","/wiki/Larry_H._Miller_Field","/w/index.php?title=BYU_Cougars&action=edit&section=5","/w/index.php?title=BYU_Cougars&action=edit&section=6","/wiki/File:Marriott_Center_1.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dc/Marriott_Center_1.JPG/250px-Marriott_Center_1.JPG","/wiki/File:Marriott_Center_1.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Marriott_Center","/wiki/BYU_Cougars_men%27s_basketball","#cite_note-13","#cite_note-14","/w/index.php?title=BYU_Cougars&action=edit&section=7","/wiki/BYU_Cougars_women%27s_basketball","/wiki/Jeff_Judkins","/w/index.php?title=BYU_Cougars&action=edit&section=8","/wiki/BYU_Cougars_football","/wiki/File:BYA_Football_Champions_1896.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/66/BYA_Football_Champions_1896.png/220px-BYA_Football_Champions_1896.png","/wiki/File:BYA_Football_Champions_1896.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association","/wiki/Division_I_(NCAA)#Football_Bowl_Subdivision","/wiki/Bronco_Mendenhall","/wiki/LaVell_Edwards_Stadium","/wiki/College_football_national_championships_in_NCAA_Division_I_FBS","#cite_note-alltime-15","#cite_note-16","#cite_note-17","/wiki/Heisman_Trophy","/wiki/Ty_Detmer","#cite_note-18","/wiki/NFL","/wiki/Jim_McMahon","/wiki/Steve_Young","/wiki/Gifford_Nielsen","/wiki/Bart_Oates","/wiki/Chad_Lewis","/wiki/Vai_Sikahema","/wiki/Todd_Christensen","#cite_note-19","#cite_note-20","/w/index.php?title=BYU_Cougars&action=edit&section=9","/wiki/Ice_hockey","/w/index.php?title=Provo_IceCats&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/American_Collegiate_Hockey_Association","/w/index.php?title=BYU_Cougars&action=edit&section=10","/wiki/Men%27s_College_Lacrosse_Asso
