It usually initiates during the late stages of\n mitosis, and sometimes meiosis, splitting a mitotic cell in two, to ensure that\n chromosome number is maintained from one generation to the next. In animal\n cells, one notable exception to the normal process of cytokinesis is oogenesis\n (the creation of an ovum in the ovarian follicle of the ovary), where the ovum\n takes almost all the cytoplasm and organelles, leaving very little for the\n resulting polar bodies, which then die. In plant cells, a dividing structure\n known as the cell plate forms across the centre of the cytoplasm and a new cell\n wall forms between the two daughter cells.\n\nCytokinesis is distinguished from the prokaryotic process of binary fission.
