{"cursor":"62054","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nThe 'Academy Honorary Award', instituted in 1948 for the 21st Academy Awards\n(previously called the 'Special Award'), is given by the discretion of the Board\nof Governors of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) to\ncelebrate motion picture achievements that are not covered by existing Academy\nAwards, although prior winners of competitive Academy Awards are not excluded\nfrom receiving the Honorary Award. Unless\notherwise specified, 'Honorary Award' recipients receive the same gold Oscar\nstatuettes received by winners of the competitive Academy Awards. Unlike the Special Achievement Award instituted\nin 1972, those on whom the Academy confers its Honorary Award do not have to\nmeet \"the Academy's eligibility year and deadline requirements.\"  Like the Special Achievement Award, the 'Special Award' and\n'Honorary Award' have been used to reward significant achievements of the year\nthat did not fit in existing categories, subsequently leading the Academy to\nestablish several new categories, and to honor exceptional career achievements,\ncontributions to the motion picture industry, and service to the Academy. Among its Honorary Awards for acting, the\nAcademy also presents deserving young actors with the Special Juvenile Academy\nAward. (Most of those are not listed here; some of the early \"Special Awards\"\nthat later became known in that acting category as the \"Special Juvenile Academy\nAward\" are listed with \"Special Award\" added\nparenthetically.) Following the searchable Official Academy Award\nDatabase (a primary source for this list), years listed are the years of the\nAcademy Awards ceremony when the award was presented (with the annual award\nceremony following within parentheses, as documented in the Official Academy\nAward Database).\n\nThe Honorary Award is presented at the annual Governors Awards.\n","linknr":790,"url":"Academy_Honorary_Award","recorded":1375073042,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Academy_Honorary_Award&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Academy_Honorary_Award&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","#Recipients","#1920s","#1930s","#1940s","#1950s","#1960s","#1970s","#1980s","#1990s","#2000s","#2010s","#See_also","#Notes","#References","#External_links","/wiki/21st_Academy_Awards","/wiki/Academy_of_Motion_Picture_Arts_and_Sciences#Current_administration_of_the_Academy","/wiki/Academy_of_Motion_Picture_Arts_and_Sciences","/wiki/Academy_Awards","#cite_note-AboutHonoraryAward-1","#cite_note-AboutHonoraryAward1d-2","/wiki/Academy_Special_Achievement_Award","/wiki/1972_in_film","#cite_note-SpecAch-3","#cite_note-AboutHonoraryAward1c-4","#cite_note-5","#cite_note-6","/wiki/Governors_Awards","/w/index.php?title=Academy_Honorary_Award&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/World_Wide_Web","/wiki/Bob_Hope","/w/index.php?title=Academy_Honorary_Award&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/1st_Academy_Awards","/wiki/Warner_Bros.","/wiki/The_Jazz_Singer_(1927_film)","/wiki/1st_Academy_Awards","/wiki/Charlie_Chaplin","/wiki/The_Circus_(film)","#cite_note-7","/wiki/2nd_Academy_Awards","/wiki/3rd_Academy_Awards","/w/index.php?title=Academy_Honorary_Award&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/4th_Academy_Awards","/wiki/5th_Academy_Awards","/wiki/Walt_Disney","/wiki/Mickey_Mouse","/wiki/6th_Academy_Awards","/wiki/7th_Academy_Awards","/wiki/Shirley_Temple","/wiki/Academy_Juvenile_Award","/wiki/8th_Academy_Awards","/wiki/D._W._Griffith","/wiki/9th_Academy_Awards","/wiki/The_March_of_Time","/wiki/9th_Academy_Awards","/wiki/W._Howard_Greene","/wiki/Harold_Rosson","/wiki/David_O._Selznick#Selznick_International_Pictures","/wiki/The_Garden_of_Allah_(1936_film)","/wiki/10th_Academy_Awards","/wiki/Edgar_Bergen","/wiki/10th_Academy_Awards","/wiki/W._Howard_Greene","/wiki/A_Star_Is_Born_(1937_film)","/wiki/10th_Academy_Awards","/wiki/Museum_of_Modern_Art","/wiki/10th_Academy_Awards","/wiki/Mack_Sennett","/wiki/Comedy","/wiki/11th_Academy_Awards","/w/index.php?title=J._Arthur_Ball&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/11th_Academy_Awards","/wiki/Walt_Disney","/wiki/Snow_White_and_the_Seven_Dwarfs_(1937_film)","/wiki/11th_Academy_Awards","/wiki/Deanna_Durbin","/wiki/Mickey_Rooney","/wiki/Academy_Juvenile_Award","/wiki/11th_Academy_Awards","/wiki/Gordon_Jennings","/wiki/Jan_Domela","/w/index.php?title=Devereaux_Jennings&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Irmin_Roberts&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Art_Smith_(special_effects)&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Farciot_Edouart","/wiki/Loyal_Griggs","/wiki/Loren_L._Ryder","/w/index.php?title=Harry_D._Mills&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Louis_Mesenkop","/w/index.php?title=Walter_Oberst&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Paramount_Pictures","/wiki/Spawn_of_the_North","/wiki/11th_Academy_Awards","/w/index.php?title=Oliver_T._Marsh&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Allen_Davey&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/MGM","/wiki/Sweethearts_(1938_film)","/wiki/11th_Academy_Awards","/wiki/Harry_Warner","/wiki/Short_subjects","/wiki/12th_Academy_Awards","/wiki/Douglas_Fairbanks","/wiki/12th_Academy_Awards","/wiki/Judy_Garland","/wiki/Academy_Juvenile_Award","/wiki/12th_Academy_Awards","/wiki/William_Cameron_Menzies","/wiki/Gone_with_the_Wind_(film)","/wiki/12th_Academy_Awards","/wiki/Motion_Picture_%26_Television_Fund","/wiki/Jean_Hersholt","/wiki/Ralph_Morgan","/wiki/Ralph_Block","/wiki/Conrad_Nagel","/wiki/12th_Academy_Awards","/w/index.php?title=Technicolor_Company&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Academy_Honorary_Award&action=edit&section=4","/wiki/13th_Academy_Awards","/wiki/Bob_Hope","/wiki/13th_Academy_Awards","/wiki/Nathan_Levinson","/wiki/United_States_Army","/wiki/14th_Academy_Awards","/wiki/Walt_Disney","/wiki/William_Garity","/w/index.php?title=John_N._A._Hawkins&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/RCA","/wiki/Fantasia_(film)","/wiki/14th_Academy_Awards","/wiki/Leopold_Stokowski","/wiki/Fantasia_(film)","/wiki/14th_Academy_Awards","/w/index.php?title=Rey_Scott&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Kukan","/wiki/China","/wiki/16mm_film#Cameras","#cite_note-Crowther-8","/wiki/14th_Academy_Awards","/wiki/Ministry_of_Informatio
