{"cursor":"55259","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nAn 'extinction event' (also known as a 'mass extinction' or 'biotic crisis') is\na widespread and rapid decrease in the amount of life on earth. Such an event is\nidentified by a sharp change in the diversity and abundance of macroscopic life.\nIt occurs when the rate of extinction increases with respect to the rate of\nspeciation. Because the majority of diversity and biomass on Earth is microbial,\nand thus difficult to measure, recorded extinction events affect the easily\nobserved, biologically complex component of the biosphere rather than the total\ndiversity and abundance of life.\n\nOver 98% of documented species are now extinct, but extinction occurs\nat an uneven rate. Based on the fossil record, the background rate of\nextinctions on Earth is about two to five taxonomic families of marine\ninvertebrates and vertebrates every million years. Marine fossils are mostly\nused to measure extinction rates because of their superior fossil record and\nstratigraphic range compared to land organisms.\n\nSince life began on Earth, several major mass extinctions have significantly\nexceeded the background extinction rate. The most recent, the\nCretaceousâPaleogene extinction event, which occurred approximately 65.5 million\nyears ago (Ma), was a large-scale mass extinction of animal and plant species in\na geologically short period of time. In the past 540 million years there have\nbeen five major events when over 50% of animal species died. Mass extinctions\nseem to be a Phanerozoic phenomenon, with extinction rates low before large\ncomplex organisms arose.\n\nEstimates of the number of major mass extinctions in the last 540 million years\nrange from as few as five to more than twenty. These differences stem from the\nthreshold chosen for describing an extinction event as \"major\", and the data\nchosen to measure past diversity.\n","linknr":943,"url":"Mass_extinctions","recorded":1362510552,"links":74,"instances":["paleontologist","sediment","ecology","evolutionary_biology","hypothetical_star","zoology","biology"],"pdf":["http://astro.mff.cuni.cz/davok/papers/BAF_2007.pdf","http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/acm2008/pdf/8243.pdf","http://www.bosmin.com/SeaChange.pdf","http://sep.csumb.edu/class/ESSP645/readings/Quammen%201998.pdf","http://sep.csumb.edu/class/ESSP645/readings/Quammen%201998.pdf","http://journals.royalsociety.org/content/qq5un1810k7605h5/fulltext.pdf","http://journals.royalsociety.org/content/qq5un1810k7605h5/fulltext.pdf"],"categories":["Extinction
