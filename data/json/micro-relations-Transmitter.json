It\n broadcasts at 101.9 MHz with a radiated power of 48 kW. ]] system which uses\n electromagnetic waves (radio waves) to transport information (in this case\n sound) over a distance. ]] In electronics and telecommunications a\n 'transmitter' or 'radio transmitter' is an electronic device which, with the\n aid of an antenna, produces radio waves. The transmitter itself generates a\n radio frequency alternating current, which is applied to the antenna. When\n excited by this alternating current, the antenna radiates radio waves. In\n addition to their use in broadcasting, transmitters are necessary component\n parts of many electronic devices that communicate by radio, such as cell\n phones, wireless computer networks, Bluetooth enabled devices, garage door\n openers, two-way radios in aircraft, ships, and spacecraft, radar sets, and\n navigational beacons. The term transmitter is usually limited to equipment that\n generates radio waves for communication purposes; or radiolocation, such as\n radar and navigational transmitters. Generators of radio waves for heating or\n industrial purposes, such as microwave ovens or diathermy equipment, are not\n usually called transmitters even though they often have similar circuits.\n\nThe term is popularly used more specifically to refer to a broadcast\ntransmitter, a transmitter used in broadcasting, as in FM radio transmitter or\n[[television transmitter]]. This usage usually includes both the transmitter\nproper, the antenna, and often the building it is housed in.\n\nAn unrelated use of the term is in industrial process control, where a\n\"transmitter\" is a telemetry device which converts measurements from a sensor\ninto a signal, and sends it, usually via wires, to be received by some display\nor control device located a distance away.\n","linknr":668,"url":"Transmitter","recorded":1362673201,"links":29,"instances":["radio"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Broadcast transmitters|","Telecommunications equipment","Radar"],"headings":["Description","Legal restrictions","How it works","History","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/WDET-FM_transmitter.png/220px-WDET-FM_transmitter.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/Signal_processing_system.png/400px-Signal_processing_system.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/22/KWNR_Continental_816R-5B_SN_247.jpg/200px-KWNR_Continental_816R-5B_SN_247.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c4/Icom_IC-746PRO.jpg/270px-Icom_IC-746PRO.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a1/CB_Base_Station.jpg/200px-CB_Base_Station.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/MorRadBuiComb.jpg/125px-MorRadBuiComb.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4e/Darth_Gimp_Cordless_Phone.svg/100px-Darth_Gimp_Cordless_Phone.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/Garage-door-opener-remote-control.png/122px-Garage-door-opener-remote-control.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c7/Microchip_rfid_rice.jpg/130px-Microchip_rfid_rice.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/34/Linksys-Wireless-G-Router.jpg/150px-Linksys-Wireless-G-Router.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4e/Telecom-icon.svg/100px-Telecom-icon.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["antenna","radio"]],"members":["antenna"],"related":["WDET-FM","Megahertz","Kilowatt","Electromagnetic_wave","Radio_wave","Electronics","Telecommunications","Electronic_device","Antenna_(radio)","Radio_wave","Radio_frequency","Alternating_current","Radio_wave","Broadcasting","Radio_communication","Cell_phone","Wireless_LAN","Bluetooth","Garage_door_opener","Two-way_radio","Radar","Communication_engineering","Radiolocation","Radar","Microwave_oven","Diathermy","Broadcast_transmitter","Broadcasting","Process_control","Telemetry","Radio_receiver","Radio_communication","Audio_signal","Video_signal","Wireless_networking","Digital_signal","Carrier_wave","Amplitude_modulation","Amplitude","Frequency_modulation","Frequency","Garage_door_opener","Feed_line","Transmission_line","Amateur_radio","CB_radio","Transceiver","Two_way_radio","Cordless_phone","Garage_door_opener","RFID_tag","Wireless_computer_network","Wireless_router","Electromagnetic_interference","Broadcast","Marine_radio","Airband","Amateur_radio","Call_sign","General_radiotelephone_operator_license","Wireless_microphone","Cordless_telephone","Walkie-talkie","Wifi","Bluetooth","Garage_door_opener","Baby_monitor","Part_15","Federal_Communications_Commission","Type_approval","Electronic_circuit","Mains_power","Radio_frequency","Alternating_current","Electromagnetic_wave","Radio_receiver","Power_supply","Voltage","Electronic_oscillator","Radio_frequency","Sine_wave","Amplitude","Carrier_wave","Crystal_oscillator","Quartz_crystal","Modulator","Carrier_wave","Audio_signal","Sound","Video_signal","Binary_numeral_system","Digital","Amplitude_modulation","Amplitude","Frequency_modulation","Frequency","Frequency-shift_keying","Modulation","Power_amplifier","Impedance_matching","Antenna_tuner","Electrical_impedance","Transmission_line","Standing_wave","Ultrahigh_frequency","Microwave","Frequency_multiplier","Heinrich_Hertz","Electric_spark","Spark-gap_transmitter","Wireless_telegraphy","Audio","Telegraphy","Morse_code","Alexanderson_alternator","Poulsen_Arc","Vacuum_tube","Continuous_wave","Modulation","Amplitude_modulation","Frequency_modulation","Radio_broadcasting","Edwin_Armstrong","Radar","World_War_II","Ultrahigh_frequency","Microwave","Magnetron","Klystron","Traveling_wave_tube","Radio_spectrum","Spread_spectrum","List_of_famous_transmission_sites","Radio_transmitter_design","Transmitter_station","TV_transmitter","Transposer"]}
