The word \"corona\"\nitself derived from the Latin, meaning 'crown', which in turn came from the\nAncient Greek κορώνη (korōnē) meaning \"garland\" or \"wreath\".\n\nThe high temperature of the corona gives it unusual spectral features, which led\nsome to suggest, in the 19th century, that it contained a previously unknown\nelement, \"coronium\". These spectral features have since been traced to highly\nionized iron ('Fe-XIV') which indicates a plasma temperature in excess of\n10<sup>6</sup> kelvin.<ref name=\"Aschwanden\">{{cite book |last=Aschwanden\n|first=M.

An Introduction\n|publisher=Praxis Publishing |isbn=3-540-22321-5}} </ref> The fact that the Sun\nhas a million-degree corona was first discovered by Gotrian in 1939 and Bengt\nEdlén in 1941 by identifying the coronal lines (observed since 1869) as\ntransitions from low-lying metastable levels of the ground configuration of\nhighly ionised metals (the green FeXIV line at 5303&nbsp;Å, but also the red\nline FeX at 6374&nbsp;Å).\n\nLight from the corona comes from three primary sources, which are called by\ndifferent names although all of them share the same volume of space. The K-\ncorona (K&nbsp;for kontinuierlich, \"continuous\" in German) is created by\nsunlight scattering off free electrons; Doppler broadening of the reflected\nphotospheric absorption lines completely obscures them, giving the spectral\nappearance of a continuum with no absorption lines. The F-corona (F&nbsp;for\nFraunhofer) is created by sunlight bouncing off dust particles, and is\nobservable because its light contains the Fraunhofer absorption lines that are\nseen in raw sunlight; the F-corona extends to very high elongation angles from\nthe Sun, where it is called the zodiacal light. The E-corona (E for emission)\nis due to spectral emission lines produced by ions that are present in the\ncoronal plasma; it may be observed in broad or forbidden or hot spectral\nemission lines and is the main source of information about the corona's\ncomposition.<ref name=\"Corfield\">{{cite book |last=Corfield |first=Richard\n|year=2007 |title=Lives of the Planets |publisher=Basic Books |isbn=978-0-465-01403-\n3}} </ref>\n","title":"corona","headings":["Physical features","Variability of the corona","Stellar coronae","Physics of the corona","Coronal heating problem","See also","References","Further reading","External links"]},"micro-relation":["6: Solar_prominence","5: Solar_wind","5: Solar_cycle","5: Solar_flare","5: Solar_and_Heliospheric_Observatory","4: Photosphere","4: Coronal_hole","4: Coronal_mass_ejection","4: Nanoflares","3: Chromosphere","3: Coronal_loop","3: HÎ±","3: TRACE","3: Magnetic_reconnection","2: Sun","2: Kelvin","2: Magnetic_field","2: Star","2: Equator","2: Sunspots","2: High_Resolution_Coronal_Imager","2: Helmet_streamer","2: Boltzmann_constant","2: Variable_star","2: Thermal_conductivity","2: Lorentz_force","2: Magnetohydrodynamics","2: Second_law_of_thermodynamics","2: Transition_region","2: Coronal_radiative_losses","1: Solar_eclipse","1: Coronagraph","1: Latin_language","1: Spectroscopy","1: Coronium","1: Bengt_EdlÃ©n","1: Electron","1: Doppler_broadening","1: Joseph_von_Fraunhofer","1: Zodiacal_light","1: Forbidden_line","1: Spectral_line","1: Temperature","1: Sound","1: Geographical_pole","1: Sunspot","1: Solar_minimum","1: Solar_maximum","1: Differential_rotation","1: Magnetic_flux","1: Skylab","1: Yohkoh","1: Coronal_loops","1: Facula","1: Solar_prominences","1: Moreton_wave","1: Solar_flares","1: Siphon","1: Evaporation","1: Condensation","1: Symmetric","1: Limb_darkening","1: Line-of-sight_propagation","1: Solar_Probe_Plus","1: Magnetic_pressure","1: State_equation","1: Particle_number_density","1: Space","1: Magnetogram","1: Extreme_ultraviolet_Imaging_Telescope","1: Large_Angle_and_Spectrometric_Coronagraph","1: Hertzsprung-Russell_diagram","1: X-ray_telescope","1: FK_Comae_Berenices","1: Einstein_Observatory","1: Saha_equation","1: Equipartition_theorem","1: Thermal_conduction","1: Cyclotron","1: Debye_length","1: Electrical_conduction","1: Fluid","1: Seismology","1: Helioseismology","1: Scale_height","1: Fine_structure","1: Solar_physics","1: SI_prefix","1: NASA","1: NASA_Solar_probe","1: Soft_X-ray","1: Sounding_rocket","1: Direct_current","1: Alternating_current","1: Evry_Schatzman","1: Sound_waves","1: Magneto-acoustic_wave","1: AlfvÃ©n_wave","1: Ultra_low_frequency","1: Radio_waves","1: Matter","1: Super_granulation","1: Shock_waves","1: Extreme_ultraviolet","1: Hertz","1: Ions","1: Williams_College","1: Solar_Dynamics_Observatory","1: Hinode","1: Seawater","1: Magnetic_field_lines","1: Topology","1: Poles_of_astronomical_bodies#Magnetic_poles","1: Eugene_Parker","1: Ultraviolet","1: Colorado","1: University_of_Oslo","1: Advanced_Composition_Explorer","1: AlfvÃ©n_waves","1: Coronal_seismology","1: Geocorona","1: Heliosphere","1: Magnetohydrodynamics#MHD_waves","1: STEREO","1: X-ray_astronomy"]}
