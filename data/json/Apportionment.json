See also [[apportionment\n(politics)]]\n\nThe legal term 'apportionment' (French apportionement; Med. Latin\napportionamentum; derived from Latin portio, share) means distribution or\nallotment in proper shares.\n\nIt is a term used in law in a variety of senses. Sometimes it is employed\nroughly and has no technical meaning; this indicates the distribution of a\nbenefit (e.g. salvage or damages under the Fatal Accidents Act 1846, รยง 2), or\nliability (e.g. general average contributions, or tithe rent-charge), or the\nincidence of a duty (e.g. obligations as to the maintenance of highways).\n\nIn its strict legal interpretation apportionment falls into two classes:\n\"apportionment in respect of estate\" and \"apportionment in respect of time.\"\n","linknr":128,"url":"Apportionment","recorded":1362484237,"links":18,"instances":["law","financial_contracts","economics","financial"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Legal terms"],"headings":["Apportionment in respect of estate","Apportionment in respect of time","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Gnome_globe_current_event.svg/42px-Gnome_globe_current_event.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/62/PD-icon.svg/12px-PD-icon.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["allotment","financial"],["estate","law"],["annuity","financial_contracts"],["capital","economics"]],"members":["estate","annuity","capital","allotment"],"related":["Allotment_(financial)","Legal_liability","Tithe","Estate_(law)","Leasing","Eviction","Property","Common_law","The_Crown","Statute","Annuity_(financial_contracts)","Dividend","Heir","Bankruptcy","Capital_(economics)"]}
