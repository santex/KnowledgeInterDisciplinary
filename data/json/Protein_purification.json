{"cursor":"23477","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Protein purification' is a series of processes intended to isolate a single\ntype of protein from a complex mixture. Protein purification is vital for the\ncharacterization of the function, structure and interactions of the protein of\ninterest. The starting material is usually a biological tissue or a microbial\nculture. The various steps in the purification process may free the protein from\na matrix that confines it, separate the protein and non-protein parts of the\nmixture, and finally separate the desired protein from all other proteins.\nSeparation of one protein from all others is typically the most laborious aspect\nof protein purification. Separation steps may exploit differences in (for\nexample) protein size, physico-chemical properties, binding affinity and\nbiological activity.\n","linknr":296,"url":"Protein_purification","recorded":1362484493,"links":23,"instances":["biochemistry","chemistry","chemistry","chemistry","biochemistry","biochemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Protein methods","Biotechnology"],"headings":["Purpose","Strategies","Evaluating purification yield","Methods of protein purification","Extraction","Precipitation and differential solubilization","Ultracentrifugation","Chromatographic methods","Concentration of the purified protein","Analytical","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Shakeflask.JPG/200px-Shakeflask.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/40/Size_exclusion.jpg/200px-Size_exclusion.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dc/Metal-affinity_column.jpg/200px-Metal-affinity_column.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e2/Hplc.JPG/200px-Hplc.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/Ultra_filtration.JPG/200px-Ultra_filtration.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["receptor","biochemistry"],["ligand","biochemistry"],["homogenization","chemistry"],["precipitation","chemistry"],["denaturation","biochemistry"],["denaturation","biochemistry"],["volatility","chemistry"],["staining","biology#silver_staining"]],"members":["receptor","volatility","homogenization","precipitation","staining","denaturation","ligand"],"related":["Protein","Biological_tissue","Enzymes","Lactase","Soy_protein","Biopharmaceutical","Insulin","Post-translational_modification","Pepsin","Urease","Recombinant_DNA","Expression_system","His-tag","Size_exclusion_chromatography","SDS-PAGE","2D-PAGE","Peptide_mass_fingerprinting","High_performance_liquid_chromatography","Reversed-phase_chromatography","SDS-PAGE","Molecular_weight","Spectroscopy","Enzyme","Western_blotting","ELISA","Receptor_(biochemistry)","Ligand_(biochemistry)","Radioligand","Bradford_protein_assay","Meter","Imidazole","Structural_biology","Sonication","Homogenization_(chemistry)","Filtration","DNA","Proteases","Precipitation_(chemistry)","Ammonium_sulfate","Membrane_protein","Cell_membrane","Mitochondria","Detergent","Sodium_dodecyl_sulfate","Denaturation_(biochemistry)","Triton_X-100","CHAPS_detergent","Centrifugal_force","Acceleration","G-force","Sucrose_gradient_centrifugation","Percoll","Ultracentrifuge","Chromatography","Denaturation_(biochemistry)","Size_Exclusion_Chromatography","Eluent","Glycoprotein","Lectin","Oligosaccharides","Histidine","C-terminal","Metal","Ion","Nickel","Cobalt","Imidazole","Antibody","PH","Salinity","Antigen","Antibody","Immunoprecipitation","Immunoprecipitation","Protease","Hydrophobicity","Gradient","Organic_solvent","Volatility_(chemistry)","Lyophilization","Ultrafiltration","Gel_electrophoresis","Electrophoresis","Sodium_dodecyl_sulfate","SDS-PAGE","Coomassie_Brilliant_Blue","Metalloproteins","QPNC-PAGE"]}
