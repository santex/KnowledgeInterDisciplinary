Breeding Field Crops. 1995. Sleper\nand Poehlman. Page 3 Plant breeding can be accomplished through many\ndifferent techniques ranging from simply selecting plants with desirable\ncharacteristics for propagation, to more complex molecular techniques (see\ncultigen and cultivar).\n\nPlant breeding has been practiced for thousands of years, since near the\nbeginning of human civilization. It is now practiced worldwide by individuals\nsuch as gardeners and farmers, or by professional plant breeders employed by\norganizations such as government institutions, universities, crop-specific\nindustry associations or research centers.\n\nInternational development agencies believe that breeding new crops is important\nfor ensuring food security by developing new varieties that are higher-yielding,\nresistant to pests and diseases, drought-resistant or regionally adapted to\ndifferent environments and growing conditions.\n","linknr":593,"url":"Plant_breeding","recorded":1362503408,"links":42,"instances":["animal","biological","biology","genetics","biology","business"],"pdf":["http://www.aseanbiotechnology.info/Abstract/21020573.pdf","http://wwww.cirad.fr/colloque/selpart/partie12(ls).pdf","http://www.icarda.org/Farmer_Participation/PDF/Papers/8IBGS00S.pdf"],"categories":["Agronomy","Plant
