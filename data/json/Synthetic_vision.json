{"cursor":"10393","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" ]] A 'Synthetic Vision System' (SVS) is a computer-mediated reality system for\n aerial vehicles, that uses 3D to provide pilots with clear and intuitive means\n of understanding their flying environment.\n\nSynthetic Vision was developed by NASA and the U.S. Air Force in the late 1970s\nand 1980s in support of advanced cockpit research, and in 1990s as part of the\nAviation Safety Program. Development of the High Speed Transport (HST) fueled\nNASA research in the 1980s and 1990s. In the early 1980s, the USAF recognized\nthe need to improve cockpit situation awareness to support piloting ever more\ncomplex aircraft, and pursued SVS (sometimes called pictorial format avionics)\nas an integrating technology for both manned and remotely piloted systems. NASA\ninitiated industry involvement in early 2000 with major avionics manufacturers.\nResearchers like E. Theunissen at Delft University of Technology in the\nNetherlands contributed greatly to the development of SVS technology.\n\nSynthetic Vision provides situational awareness to the operators by using\nterrain, obstacle, geo-political, hydrological and other databases. A typical\nSVS application uses a set of databases stored on board the aircraft, an image\ngenerator computer, and a display. Navigation solution is obtained through the\nuse of GPS and Intertial Reference Systems.\n\nHighway In The Sky (HITS), or Path-In-The-Sky, is often used to depict the\nprojected path of the aircraft in perspective view. Pilots acquire instantaneous\nunderstanding of the current as well as the future state of the aircraft with\nrespect to the terrain, towers, buildings and other environment features.\n\n in a Gulfstream GV business jet in 2004.]]NASA also used synthetic vision for\n Remotely Piloted Vehicles (RPVs), such as the High Maneuvability Aerial Testbed\n or HiMAT (see Sarrafian, 1984). According to the report by NASA, the aircraft\n was flown by a pilot in a remote cockpit, and control signals up-linked from\n the flight controls in the remote cockpit on the ground to the aircraft, and\n aircraft telemetry downlinked to the remote cockpit displays (see photo). The\n remote cockpit could be configured with either nose camera video or with a 3D\n synthetic vision display. SV was also used for simulations of the HiMAT.\n Sarrafian reports that the test pilots found the visual display to be\n comparable to output of camera on board the RPV.\n\nSimilar research continued in the U.S. military services, and at Universities\naround the world. In 1995-1996, North Carolina State University flew a 17.5%\nscale F-18 RPV using Microsoft Flight Simulator to create the 3 dimensional\nprojected terrain environment. However, the recreational uses of Synthetic\nVision for RPVs preceded this substantially. For example, in 1980 the\n[http://fshistory.simflight.com/fsh/index.htm Flight Simulator] was introduced\nby Bruce Artwick. But most directly, the RC Aerochopper RPV simulation used\nsynthetic vision to aid aspiring RC helicopter pilots in learning to fly.\n\nAccording to the \"RC Aerochopper Owners Manual\" published in 1986 by Ambrosia\nMicrocomputer Products, Inc., the system included joystick flight controls which\nwould connect to an Amiga computer and display. The software included a three-\ndimensional terrain database for the ground as well as some man-made objects.\nThis database was basic, representing the terrain with relatively small numbers\nof polygons by today's standards. The program simulated the dynamic three\ndimensional position and attitude of the aircraft using the terrain database to\ncreate a projected 3D perspective display. The realism of this RPV pilot\ntraining display was enhanced by allowing the user to adjust the simulated\ncontrol system delays and other parameters.\n\nAfter years of research, in 2005 NASA's \"Turning Goals Into Reality\" program, a\nsynthetic vision system was installed on a Gulfstream V test aircraft as part of\nthe [http://www.aeronautics.nasa.gov/events/tgir/2005/safety.htm GVSITE]\nproject. Much of the experienced gained during that program led directly to the\nintroduction of certified SVS on future aircraft.\n\nThe first FAA certified application of a Synthetic Vision System (2009)was\navailable as part of the\n[http://www.gulfstream.com/product_enhancements/planeview/ Gulfstream\nPlaneView] flight deck in the form of the\n[http://www.gulfstream.com/product_enhancements/evs/ Synthetic Vision - Primary\nFlight Display (SV-PFD)] which replaces the traditional blue-over-brown\nartificial horizon with the computer generated terrain overlayed with normal\nPFD symbology. Since then, many newer glass cockpit systems such as the Garmin\nG1000 and the Rockwell Collins Pro Line Fusion offer synthetic terrain. A\nnumber of lower-cost \"experimental\" class avionics systems also offer synthetic\nvision systems.\n","linknr":128,"url":"Synthetic_vision","recorded":1372158235,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Synthetic_vision_system&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Synthetic_vision_system&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","/wiki/Synthetic_vision_system","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","/w/index.php?title=Synthetic_vision&redirect=no","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Synthetic_Vision.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b1/Synthetic_Vision.JPG/220px-Synthetic_Vision.JPG","/wiki/File:Synthetic_Vision.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf4/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Honeywell_Aerospace","/wiki/Computer-mediated_reality","/wiki/3D_computer_graphics","/wiki/NASA","/w/index.php?title=Aviation_Safety_Program&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Situational_awareness","/wiki/GPS","/wiki/File:NASA_Synthetic_Vision_Display.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ad/NASA_Synthetic_Vision_Display.jpg/220px-NASA_Synthetic_Vision_Display.jpg","/wiki/File:NASA_Synthetic_Vision_Display.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf4/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/NASA","/wiki/Gulfstream_Aerospace","/wiki/Gulfstream_V","/wiki/Remotely_Piloted_Vehicle","/wiki/HiMAT","http://fshistory.simflight.com/fsh/index.htm","http://www.aeronautics.nasa.gov/events/tgir/2005/safety.htm","http://www.gulfstream.com/product_enhancements/planeview/","http://www.gulfstream.com/product_enhancements/evs/","/wiki/Glass_cockpit","/wiki/Garmin_G1000","/wiki/Rockwell_Collins","/w/index.php?title=Pro_Line_Fusion&action=edit&redlink=1","#Enhanced_Vision","#Regulations_and_Standards","#See_also","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Synthetic_vision_system&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/File:Gulfstream_G450_(3).JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/87/Gulfstream_G450_%283%29.JPG/220px-Gulfstream_G450_%283%29.JPG","/wiki/File:Gulfstream_G450_(3).JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf4/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Gulfstream_Aerospace","/wiki/Gulfstream_G550","/wiki/Gulfstream_G450","/wiki/Gulfstream_G650","http://www.gulfstream.com/product_enhancements/evs/","/wiki/Heads-Up_Display","/w/index.php?title=Synthetic_vision_system&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=Synthetic_vision_system&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/Aircraft_collision_avoidance_systems","/w/index.php?title=Synthetic_vision_system&action=edit&section=4","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Synthetic_vision_system","http://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=443850&id=1&qs=No%3D0%26Ntt%3Dknox%26Ntk%3DAuthorList%26Ntx%3Dmode%2520matchall%26N%3D4294888977%26Ns%3DHarvestDate%257c1","http://www.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/pdf/87986main_H-1246.pdf","http://www.mae.ncsu.edu/research/flight_research/f18/index.html","http://www.nasa.gov/centers/langley/news/factsheets/SynthVision.html","http://www.ainonline.com/news/single-news-page/article/cockpit-avionics/","http://www.synthetic-vision.nl/","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Synthetic_vision_system&oldid=544300605","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Avionics","/wiki/Category:Augmented_reality","/wiki/Category:Commons_category_template_with_no_category_set","/wiki/Category:Commons_category_with_page_title_same_as_on_Wikidata","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Synthetic+vision+system&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Synthetic+vision+system","/wiki/Synthetic_vision_system","/wiki/Talk:Synthetic_vision_system","#","/wiki/Synthetic_vision_system","/w/index.php?title=Synthetic_vision_system&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Synthetic_vision_system&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf7/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Syntheti
