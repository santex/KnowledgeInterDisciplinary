It was produced by the\nFederative International Committee on Anatomical Terminology on behalf of the\nInternational Federation of Associations of Anatomists and recently posted it on\nthe Internet. It has been approved by the General\nAssembly of the IFAA during the seventeenth International Congress of Anatomy in\nCape Town (August 2009).\n\nIt is analogous to the Terminologia Anatomica (TA), which standardizes\nterminology for adult human anatomy and which deals primarily with naked-eye\nadult antomy. It succeeds the Nomina Embryologica, which was included as a\ncomponent of the Nomina Anatomica.\n\nIt was not included in the original version of the TA.\n\nThe Terminologia Embryologica (TE) is a standardized list of words to be used in\nthe description of prenatal human ontogeny, embryologic and fetal structures. It\nis produced by the Federative International Committee on Anatomical Terminology.\n\nIt is written as a new book from the beginning, and takes into account the TA\nand the Terminologia Histologica (TH), which was published in 2008.
