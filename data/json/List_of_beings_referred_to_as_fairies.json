{"cursor":"5062","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The term fairy is peculiar to the English language and to English folklore,\nreflecting the conflation of Germanic, Celtic and Romance folklore and legend\nsince the Middle English period (it is a Romance word which has been given the\nassociations of fair by folk etymology secondarily). Nevertheless, \"fairy\" has\ncome to be used as a kind of umbrella term in folklore studies, grouping\ncomparable types of supernatural creatures since at least the\n1970s. Katharine Mary Briggs, An Encyclopedia of Fairies (Pantheon Books,\n1976) p. xi. ISBN 0-394-73467-X The following list is a collection of\nindividual traditions which have been grouped under the \"fairy\" moniker in the\ncitation given.\n\n\n\n;European folklore (and European colonies in the New World) *Nymphs are female\nnature spirits from Greek mythology. Satyrs are their male counterparts. *The\nAos SÃ­ or sÃ­dhe are a powerful, supernatural race in Irish mythology.\n* Elves are a supernatural race from Germanic mythology. *The Erlking is a\n  malevolent creature that is said to lure children away from safety and kill\n  them. *Cajun Fairies (The Feufollet in French) are an American legend that\n  emerged along the bayou as early as the 1920s with a light (a ball of fire)\n  that shot out into the sky, likely derived from the same natural phenomena as\n  the will o' the wisp. The lights were known as fairies, spirits and sometimes\n  the ghosts of loved ones. *ZÃ¢nÄ (plural Zane) is the Romanian equivalent of\n  the Greek Charites. These characters make positive appearances in fairy tales\n  and reside mostly in the woods. They can also be considered the Romanian\n  equivalent of fairies. *The duende refers to a fairy- or goblin-like\n  mythological character. While its nature varies throughout Spain, Portugal,\n  the Philippines, and Latin America, in many cases its closest equivalents\n  known in the Anglophone world are the Irish leprechaun and the Scottish\n  brownie. *Encantado, in Brazilian Portuguese, are creatures who come from a\n  paradisaical underwater realm called the Encante. It may refer to spirit\n  beings or shape shifting snakes, or most often to dolphins with the ability to\n  turn into humans. *Slavic fairies come in several forms and their names are\n  spelled differently based on the specific language. *Tylwyth Teg or Bendith y\n  Mamau is the traditional name for fairies or fairy-like creatures of the\n  Otherworld in Welsh folklore and mythology. *The Xana is a character found in\n  Asturian mythology. ;Asia *Mogwai are, according to Chinese tradition, a breed\n  of fairy-folk that possess superpowers, which they often use to inflict harm\n  on humans.\n* In Malays, pari-pari (Malaysian) or peri (Indonesian) are often looked as\n  motherly figure helpful creatures who will help those who have good heart.\n  Malay Fairys also love any fruit and like nature. *Peris, found in Persian\n  mythology, are descended from fallen angels who have been denied paradise\n  until they have done penance. *Tien  are heavenly beings variously\n  translated as Immortals, Spirits, Angels and Fairies in Vietnamese folklore.\n  *Yaksha are creatures often with dual personalities, found in Hindu and\n  Buddhist mythology. On the one hand, a Yaksha may be an inoffensive nature-\n  fairy, associated with woods and mountains; but there is a much darker version\n  of the Yaksha, which is a kind of cannibalistic ogre, ghost or demon that\n  haunts the wilderness and waylays and devours travelers. ;Africa *The Aziza\n  are a beneficent fairy race from Africa, specifically Dahomey. ;New World *An\n  alux is a type of sprite or spirit in the mythological tradition of certain\n  Maya peoples from the YucatÃ¡n Peninsula. *The Curupira is a male supernatural\n  being which guards the forest in Tupi mythology. *Jogah are small spirit-folk\n  in Iroquois mythology. ;Oceania\n* Menehune (pl./s.)/Menehunes (pl.): Hawaiian Forest Spirits that are said to be\n  about three feet tall, though are almost never seen. They can be heard by a\n  quiet solitary visitor to the forest, giggling, laughing bubbling joyful\n  childlike laughter, over in the next clearing, sometimes surrounding a\n  clearing in which the solitary visitor is located. Known to exist on Kauai;\n  not known how widespread they are in the Hawaiian Islands.\n","linknr":120,"url":"List_of_beings_referred_to_as_fairies","recorded":1375087009,"links":["/w/index.php?title=List_of_beings_referred_to_as_fairies&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=List_of_beings_referred_to_as_fairies&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Fairy","/wiki/English_folklore","/wiki/Middle_English","/wiki/Folk_etymology","#cite_note-1","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_beings_referred_to_as_fairies&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Template:Citation_needed","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/Nymphs","/wiki/Greek_mythology","/wiki/Satyr","/wiki/Aos_S%C3%AD","/wiki/Irish_mythology","/wiki/Elf","/wiki/Germanic_mythology","/wiki/Erlking","/wiki/Will_o%27_the_wisp","/wiki/Z%C3%A2n%C4%83","/wiki/Duende_(mythology)","/wiki/Encantado","/wiki/Slavic_fairies","/wiki/Tylwyth_Teg","/wiki/Bendith_y_Mamau","/wiki/Otherworld","/wiki/Welsh_folklore","/wiki/Welsh_mythology","/wiki/Xana","/wiki/Mogwai_(Chinese_culture)","/wiki/Peri","/wiki/Tien","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Yaksha","/wiki/Hindu_mythology","/wiki/Buddhist_mythology","/wiki/Aziza_(African_mythology)","/wiki/Alux","/wiki/Curupira","/wiki/Jogah","/wiki/Menehune","/w/index.php?title=List_of_beings_referred_to_as_fairies&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","/wiki/Katharine_Mary_Briggs","/wiki/Pantheon_Books","/wiki/Special:BookSources/039473467X","#cite_ref-2","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Special:BookSources/1-74059-355-3","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_beings_referred_to_as_fairies&oldid=566161622","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Fairies","/wiki/Category:Lists_of_legendary_creatures","/wiki/Category:Articles_needing_additional_references_from_July_2013","/wiki/Category:All_articles_needing_additional_references","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=List+of+beings+referred+to+as+fairies&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=List+of+beings+referred+to+as+fairies","/wiki/List_of_beings_referred_to_as_fairies","/wiki/Talk:List_of_beings_referred_to_as_fairies","#","/wiki/List_of_beings_referred_to_as_fairies","/w/index.php?title=List_of_beings_referred_to_as_fairies&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=List_of_beings_referred_to_as_fairies&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/List_of_beings_referred_to_as_fairies","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/List_of_beings_referred_to_as_fairies","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=List_of_beings_referred_to_as_fairies&oldid=566161622","/w/index.php?title=List_of_beings_referred_to_as_fairies&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6607440","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=List_of_beings_referred_to_as_fairies&id=566161622","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=List+of+beings+referred+to+as+fairies","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=List+of+beings+referred+to+as+fairies&oldid=566161622&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=List_of_beings_referred_to_as_fairies&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6607440#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:
