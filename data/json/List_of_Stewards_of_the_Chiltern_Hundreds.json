Members of the House of\nCommons are technically forbidden from resigning. To circumvent this\nprohibition, a legal fiction is used. An appointment to an \"office of profit\nunder The Crown\" disqualifies an individual from sitting as a Member of\nParliament (MP). As such, several such positions are maintained to allow MPs to\nresign. Currently, the positions of Steward of the Manor\nof Northstead and Steward of the Chiltern Hundreds are used; historically\nseveral other offices have also been used. The position was\nreworked in 1861 by William Ewart Gladstone, who was worried about the honour\nconferred by appointment to people such as Edwin James, who had fled to the\nUnited States over Â£10,000 in debt. As such, the letter was rewritten to omit\nany references to honour.\n\nThe Parliamentary Information Office has produced a list of those appointed to\nthe office of Steward of the Chiltern Hundreds since 1850. The current office holder is Chris Huhne, former Liberal\nDemocrat Member of Parliament for Eastleigh, who was appointed to the office of\nSteward of the Chiltern Hundreds on 5 February 2013. http://rnn.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/Press-\nReleases/Three-Hundreds-of-Chiltern-686e5.aspx\n\nAppointees to the offices of Steward of the Manor of Northstead and Steward of\nthe Chiltern Hundreds are alternated so that two MPs can resign at once (as\nhappened on 22 October 2012). In situations in which more than two resign, such\nas the 1985 walkout of Ulster Unionist MPs, appointees are \"fired\" after a few\nhours to allow other resigning MPs to take their place.\n","linknr":3041,"url":"List_of_Stewards_of_the_Chiltern_Hundreds","recorded":1375088243,"links":["/w/index.php?title=List_of_Stewards_of_the_Chiltern_Hundreds&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=List_of_Stewards_of_the_Chiltern_Hundreds&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Gladstone.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/54/Gladstone.jpg","/wiki/File:Gladstone.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/William_Ewart_Gladstone","/wiki/Resignation_from_the_British_House_of_Commons","/wiki/House_of_Commons_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Legal_fiction","/wiki/Office_of_profit","/wiki/The_Crown","#cite_note-hcio-1","/wiki/Manor_of_Northstead","/wiki/Chiltern_Hundreds","#cite_note-hcio-1","/wiki/William_Ewart_Gladstone","/wiki/Edwin_James_(lawyer)","/wiki/United_States","#cite_note-gen1-2","/wiki/Chris_Huhne","/wiki/Liberal_Democrats_(UK)","/wiki/Eastleigh_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","#cite_note-rnn.cabinetoffice.gov.uk-3","/wiki/Manor_of_Northstead","/wiki/Chiltern_Hundreds","#cite_note-hcio-1","#Key","#1751_to_1800","#1801_to_1849","#1850_to_1899","#1900_to_1999","#2000_to_present","#See_also","#References","/w/index.php?title=List_of_Stewards_of_the_Chiltern_Hundreds&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/All-for-Ireland_League","/wiki/Coalition_Conservative","/wiki/Coalition_Liberal","/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)","/wiki/Democratic_Unionist_Party","/wiki/Home_Rule_League","/wiki/Independent_(politician)","/wiki/Irish_National_Federation","/wiki/Irish_Parliamentary_Party","/wiki/Irish_nationalism","/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)","/wiki/Liberal_Party_(UK)","/wiki/Liberal_Unionist_Party","/wiki/National_Labour_Organisation","/wiki/National_Liberal_Party_(UK,_1931)","/wiki/Democratic_Unionist_Party","/wiki/Ulster_Unionist_Party","/wiki/Unionist_Party_(Scotland)","/wiki/Whig_(British_political_faction)","/w/index.php?title=List_of_Stewards_of_the_Chiltern_Hundreds&action=edit&section=2","#cite_note-pp-4","/wiki/John_Pitt_(of_Encombe)","/wiki/Wareham_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Henry_Vane,_2nd_Earl_of_Darlington","/wiki/Downton_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Charles_Powlett,_5th_Duke_of_Bolton","/wiki/Lymington_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Thomas_Pitt_of_Boconnoc","/wiki/Old_Sarum_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/w/index.php?title=Edward_Bacon_(died_1786)&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Newport_(Cornwall)_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Horace_Walpole,_4th_Earl_of_Orford","/wiki/Castle_Rising_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/William_Pitt,_1st_Earl_of_Chatham","/wiki/Okehampton_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Henry_Bilson-Legge","/wiki/Orford_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Soame_Jenyns","/wiki/Dunwich_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/w/index.php?title=Walter_Waring_(1726%E2%80%931780)&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Bishop%27s_Castle_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/w/index.php?title=Henry_Townshend_(MP)&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Eye_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/John_Parker,_1st_Baron_Boringdon","/wiki/Bodmin_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/James_Lowther,_1st_Earl_of_Lonsdale","/wiki/Westmorland_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/William_Kerr,_4th_Marquess_of_Lothian","/wiki/Richmond_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Norborne_Berkeley,_4th_Baron_Botetourt","/wiki/Gloucestershire_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/John_Ligonier,_1st_Viscount_Ligonier","/wiki/Bath_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Baron_Ligonier","/wiki/Robert_Lowther_(1741%E2%80%931777)","/wiki/Westmorland_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Sir_Gilbert_Elliot,_3rd_Baronet","/wiki/Selkirkshire_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/w/index.php?title=William_Woodley&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Great_Bedwyn_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Lord_George_Lennox","/wiki/Chichester_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Chase_Price","/wiki/Leominster_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Richard_Pennant,_1st_Baron_Penrhyn","/wiki/Petersfield_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/James_Brudenell,_5th_Earl_of_Cardigan","/wiki/Great_Bedwyn_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Sir_John_Wrottesley,_8th_Baronet","/wiki/Newcastle-under-Lyme_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Geo
