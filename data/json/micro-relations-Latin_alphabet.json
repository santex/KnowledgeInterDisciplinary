The Etruscan alphabet\nwas in turn adopted and further modified by the ancient Romans to write the\nLatin language.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, the Latin alphabet was adapted to Romance languages,\ndirect descendants of Latin, as well as to Celtic, Germanic, Baltic, and some\nSlavic languages. With the age of colonialism and Christian evangelism, the\nLatin script was spread overseas, and applied to indigenous American,\nAustralian, Austronesian, Austroasiatic, and African languages. More recently,\nwestern linguists have also tended to prefer the Latin script or the\nInternational Phonetic Alphabet (itself largely based on Latin script) when\ntranscribing or creating written standards for non-European languages, such as\nthe African reference alphabet.\n\nThe term Latin alphabet may refer to either the alphabet used to write Latin (as\ndescribed in this article), or other alphabets based on the Latin script, which\nis the basic set of letters common to the various alphabets descended from the\nclassical Latin one, such as the English alphabet. These Latin-derived alphabets\nmay discard letters, like the Rotokas alphabet, or add new letters, like the\nDanish and Norwegian alphabet. Letter shapes have changed over the centuries,\nincluding the creation for Medieval Latin of lower case forms which did not\nexist in the Classical period.\n","linknr":962,"url":"Latin_alphabet","recorded":1362580990,"links":148,"instances":["typography","alphabet","diacritic","italy","phonetics","letter","computing"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Latin
