Another commonly advected quantity is energy or\nenthalpy. Here the fluid may be any material that contains thermal energy, such\nas water or air. In general, any substance or conserved, extensive quantity can\nbe advected by a fluid that can hold or contain the quantity or substance.\n\nIn advection, a fluid transports some conserved quantity or material via bulk\nmotion. The fluid's motion is described mathematically as a vector field, and\nthe transported material is described by a scalar field showing its distribution\nover space. Advection requires currents in the fluid, and so cannot happen in\nrigid solids. It does not include transport of substances by molecular\ndiffusion.\n\nAdvection is sometimes confused with the more encompassing process of\nconvection. In fact, convective transport is the sum of advective transport and\ndiffusive transport.\n\nIn meteorology and physical oceanography, advection often refers to the\ntransport of some property of the atmosphere or ocean, such as heat, humidity\n(see moisture) or salinity. <!-- This is sentence is patently false, e.g. cloud\nformation is vertical advection of water vapor driven by density gradients! See,\nfor example, the following sentence: Meteorological or oceanographic advective\ntransport is perpendicular to isobaric surfaces and is therefore predominantly\nhorizontal. --> Advection is important for the formation of orographic clouds\nand the precipitation of water from clouds, as part of the hydrological cycle.\n","title":"advection","headings":["Distinction between advection and convection","Meteorology","Other quantities","Mathematics of advection","See also","References"]},"micro-relation":["6: Velocity_field","5: Scalar_field","4: Convection","3: Diffusion","2: Fluid","2: Vector_field","2: Meteorology","2: Physical_oceanography","2: Ocean","2: Heat","2: Hydrological_cycle","2: Partial_differential_equation","2: Del","2: Continuity_equation","2: Solenoidal","2: Skew-symmetric_matrix","1: Physics","1: Engineering","1: Earth_science","1: Transport","1: Conservation_of_energy","1: Pollutant","1: Silt","1: River","1: Energy","1: Enthalpy","1: Water","1: Air","1: Extensive","1: Mathematics","1: Molecular_diffusion","1: Water_vapor","1: Horizontal_plane","1: Orographic","1: Orographic_cloud","1: Probability_density_function","1: Conservation_law","1: Gauss's_theorem","1: Infinitesimal","1: Cartesian_coordinate_system","1: Divergence","1: Incompressible_flow","1: Streamlines,_streaklines_and_pathlines","1: Magnetic_field","1: Numerical_analysis","1: Hyperbolic_partial_differential_equation","1: Continuous_function","1: Imaginary_number","1: Eigenvalues","1: Vector_calculus_identities#Vector_dot_product","1: Courant_number","1: Péclet_number","1: Earth's_atmosphere"]}
