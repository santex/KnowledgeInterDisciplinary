Works of political fiction often \"directly\ncriticize an existing society or... present an alternative, sometimes fantastic,\nreality.\" \"[http://www.wesleyan.edu/wesmaps/course0102/hist294s.htm HIST 294\n- Political Fiction]\", December 12, 2005\n\nProminent pieces of political fiction have included the totalitarian dystopias\nof the early 20th century such as Jack London's [[The Iron Heel]] and Sinclair\nLewis's [[It Can't Happen Here]]. Equally influential, if not more so, however,\nhave been earlier pieces of political fiction such as [[Gulliver's Travels]]\n(1726), [[Candide]] (1759) and [[Uncle Tom's Cabin]] (1852). Political fiction\nfrequently employs the literary modes of satire, often in the genres of Utopian\nand dystopian fiction or social science fiction.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Political_fiction","recorded":1372154438,"links":[],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Literary genres","Political art","Political novels|","Political fiction|","Works about politics| Fiction"],"headings":["Notable examples","Science fiction","See also","Notes"],"image":[],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Subgenre","Fiction","Political_affairs","Narrative","Political_commentary","Political","Totalitarianism","Dystopia","Satire","Utopian_and_dystopian_fiction","Social_science_fiction","BCE","Plato","BCE","Vishnu_Sarma","Thomas_More","Jan_Kochanowski","Miguel_de_Cervantes","Hans_Jakob_Christoffel_von_Grimmelshausen","John_Bunyan","Montesquieu","Jonathan_Swift","Voltaire","Tobias_Smollett","Ignacy_Krasicki","Julian_Ursyn_Niemcewicz","Nathaniel_Beverley_Tucker","Charles_Dickens","Alessandro_Manzoni","Benjamin_Disraeli","Benjamin_Disraeli","Benjamin_Disraeli","Harriet_Beecher_Stowe","Charles_Dickens","Ivan_Turgenev","Anthony_Trollope","Leo_Tolstoy","Fyodor_Dostoyevsky","Mark_Twain","Charles_Dudley_Warner","Henry_Brooks_Adams","Henry_James","Edward_Bellamy","Boles≈Çaw_Prus","Joseph_Conrad","Upton_Sinclair","Jack_London","Joseph_Conrad","Robert_Tressell","Franz_Kafka","Franz_Kafka","Aldous_Huxley","George_Orwell","B._F._Skinner","George_Orwell","Gore_Vidal","Graham_Greene","Ayn_Rand","Richard_Condon","Graham_Greene","Aleksandr_Solzhenitsyn","Gore_Vidal","Gore_Vidal","Robert_Cormier","V._S._Naipaul","Gore_Vidal","Thomas_Pynchon","Giannina_Braschi","Robert_A._Heinlein","Ursula_K._Le_Guin","Kim_Stanley_Robinson","Politics_in_fiction","Proletarian_literature","Social_novel"]}
