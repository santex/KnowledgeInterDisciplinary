{"cursor":"21753","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nAn 'insecticide' is a pesticide used against insects. They include ovicides and\nlarvicides used against the eggs and larvae of insects respectively.\nInsecticides are used in agriculture, medicine, industry, and general home use.\nThe use of insecticides is believed to be one of the major factors behind the\nincrease in agricultural productivity in the 20th century. van Emden HF,\nPealall DB (1996) Beyond Silent Spring, Chapman & Hall, London, 322pp.\nNearly all insecticides have the potential to significantly alter ecosystems;\nmany are toxic to humans; and others are concentrated in the food chain.\n\nThe classification of insecticides is done in several different ways: *Systemic\ninsecticides are incorporated by treated plants. Insects ingest the insecticide\nwhile feeding on the plants. *Contact insecticides are toxic to insects brought\ninto direct contact. Efficacy is often related to the quality of pesticide\napplication, with small droplets (such as aerosols) often improving\nperformance. *Natural insecticides, such as nicotine, pyrethrum and\nneem extracts are made by plants as defenses against insects. Nicotine-based\ninsecticides are still being widely used in the US and Canada though they are\nbarred in the EU. *Plant-incorporated protectants (PIPs) are\ninsecticidal substances produced by plants after genetic\nmodification. [http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/biopesticides/pips/index.htm\nPlant Incorporated Protectants] For instance, a gene that codes for a\nspecific Baccilus thuringiensis biocidal protein is introduced into a crop\nplant's genetic material. Then, the plant manufactures the protein. Since the\nbiocide is incorporated into the plant, additional applications, at least of the\nsame compound, are not required. *Inorganic insecticides are manufactured with\nmetals and include arsenates, copper compounds and fluorine compounds, which are\nnow seldom used, and sulfur, which is commonly used. *Organic insecticides are\nsynthetic chemicals which comprise the largest numbers of pesticides available\nfor use today. *[[Mode of action]]âhow the pesticide kills or inactivates a\npestâis another way of classifying insecticides. Mode of action is important in\npredicting whether an insecticide will be toxic to unrelated species, such as\nfish, birds and mammals.\n","linknr":759,"url":"Insecticide","recorded":1362512380,"links":63,"instances":["nerve_agent","beekeeping","nerve_agent","biology"],"pdf":["http://www.epa.gov/opprd001/factsheets/chloran.pdf","http://www.epa.gov/opprd001/factsheets/chloran.pdf","http://www.epa.gov/opprd001/factsheets/chloran.pdf"],"categories":["Insecticides|","Biocides"],"headings":["Classes of insecticides","Insect growth regulators","Biological insecticides","Environmental effects","Individual insecticides","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/Myrosinase_general_mechanism.png/760px-Myrosinase_general_mechanism.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/Hazardous-pesticide.jpg/140px-Hazardous-pesticide.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["egg","biology"],["tabun","nerve_agent"],["vx","nerve_agent"],["beehive","beekeeping"],["2-(1-methylpropylphenyl_methylcarbamate"]],"members":["tabun","beehive","vx","egg"],"related":["Pesticide","Insect","Larvicides","Egg_(biology)","Larva","Agriculture","Medicine","Industry","Pesticide_application","Aerosol","Nicotine","Pyrethrum","Neem","Genetically_modified_organism","Arsenate","Copper","Fluorine","Sulfur","DDT","Paul_Müller","Nobel_Prize_for_Physiology_or_Medicine","Chlorinated_hydrocarbon","Sodium_channels","Organophosphate","Sarin","Tabun_(nerve_agent)","Soman","VX_(nerve_agent)","Carbamate","Pyrethrum","Pyrethroid","Pesticide_application","Neonicotinoid","Nicotine","Soil","Ryanoids","Ryanodine","Flacourtiaceae","Calcium_channels","Rynaxypyr","Insect_growth_regulator","Diflubenzuron","Juvenile_hormone","Methoprene","Hydroprene","Kinoprene","Methoprene","Tebufenozide","Biological_insecticide","Lepidoptera","Larvicide","Caterpillar","Spinosad","Organism","Environmentally_friendly","Bt_toxin","Genetic_engineering","Enzyme","Myrosinase","Glucosinolate","Allyl_isothiocyanate","Horseradish","DDT","Lead","Arsenic","DDT","Rachel_Carson","Silent_Spring","Bioaccumulation","Fatty_tissue","Biomagnification","Food_chain","Peregrine_falcon","Organochlorine","Stockholm_Convention","Persistent_organic_pollutant","Aldrin","Chlordane","DDT","Dieldrin","Endrin","Heptachlor","Mirex","Toxaphene","Pesticide_toxicity_to_bees","Pollinator_decline","Pollination","Colony_collapse_disorder","Beehive_(beekeeping)","Western_honey_bee","Aldrin","Chlordane","Chlordecone","DDT","Dieldrin","Endosulfan","Endrin","Heptachlor","Hexachlorobenzene","Lindane","Methoxychlor","Mirex","Pentachlorophenol","Dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane","Acephate","Azinphos-methyl","Bensulide","Chlorethoxyfos","Chlorpyrifos","Chlorpyriphos-methyl","Diazinon","Dichlorvos","Dicrotophos","Dimethoate","Disulfoton","Ethoprop","Fenamiphos","Fenitrothion","Fenthion","Fosthiazate","Malathion","Methamidophos","Methidathion","Mevinphos","Monocrotophos","Naled","Omethoate","Oxydemeton-methyl","Parathion","Parathion-methyl","Phorate","Phosalone","Phosmet","Phostebupirim","Phoxim","Pirimiphos-methyl","Profenofos","Terbufos","Tetrachlorvinphos","Tribufos","Trichlorfon","Aldicarb","Bendiocarb","Carbofuran","Carbaryl","Dioxacarb","Fenobucarb","Fenoxycarb","Isoprocarb","Methomyl","2-(1-Methylpropyl)phenyl_methylcarbamate","Allethrin","Bifenthrin","Cyhalothrin","Lambda-cyhalothrin","Cypermethrin","Cyfluthrin","Deltamethrin","Etofenprox","Fenvalerate","Permethrin","Phenothrin","Prallethrin","Resmethrin","Tetramethrin","Tralomethrin","Transfluthrin","Acetamiprid","Clothianidin","Imidacloprid","Nitenpyram","Nithiazine","Thiacloprid","Thiamethoxam","Rynaxypyr","Benzoylurea","Diflubenzuron","Flufenoxuron","Methoprene","Hydroprene","Tebufenozide","Anabasine","Anethole","Annonin","Asimina","Lice","Azadirachtin","Caffeine","Carapa","Cinnamaldehyde","Cinnamon","Deguelin","Derris","Derris","Rotenone","Eugenol","Linalool","Myristicin","Neem","Azadirachtin","Nicotine","Oregano","Polyketide","Pyrethrum","Ryanodine","Tetranortriterpenoid","Thymol","Varroa_mite","Bees","Bacillus_sphaericus","Bacillus_thuringiensis","Bacillus_thuringiensis_israelensis","Nuclear_Polyhedrosis_Virus","Cydia_pomonella_granulosis_virus","Spinosyn_A","Spinosyn_D","Diatomaceous_earth","Borate","Borax","Boric_Acid","Fogger","Index_of_pesticide_articles","Endangered_arthropod","Pesticide_application"]}
