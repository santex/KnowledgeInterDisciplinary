The radius of the sphere of influence is called\nthe \"influence radius\".\n\nThere are two definitions in common use for the radius of the sphere of\ninfluence. The first Peebles, J. (1972),\n[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1972ApJ...178..371P Star Distribution Near a\nCollapsed Object] is given by\n\nr_h = \\frac{GM_{\\rm BH}}{\\sigma^2}\n\nwhere M BH is the mass of the black hole, \\sigma is the\nstellar velocity dispersion of the host bulge, and G is the\ngravitational constant. The second definition {{Cite conference\n  | first = D. last = Merritt authorlink = David Merritt title = Single and\n  | Binary Black Holes and their Influence on Nuclear Structure booktitle =\n  | Coevolution of Black Holes and Galaxies series = Carnegie Observatories\n  | astrophysics series place = pages = 263-275 year = 2004 url = http://www.ca-\n  | mbridge.org/us/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=0521824494#contributors}}\n  | is the radius at which the enclosed mass in stars equals twice\n  | M BH , i.e.\n\nM_\\star(r .\n\nWhich definition is most appropriate depends on the physical question that is\nbeing addressed. The first definition takes into account the bulge's overall\neffect on the motion of a star, since \\sigma is determined in part\nby stars that have moved far from the black hole. The second definition compares\nthe force from the black hole to the local force from the stars.\n\nIt is a minimum requirement that the sphere of influence be well resolved in\norder that the mass of the black hole be determined dynamically.
