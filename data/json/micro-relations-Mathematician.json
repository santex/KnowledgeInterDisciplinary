Applied mathematicians are mathematical\nscientists who, with their specialized knowledge and professional methodology,\napproach many of the imposing problems presented in related scientific fields.\nWith professional focus on a wide variety of problems, theoretical systems, and\nlocalized constructs, applied mathematicians work regularly in the study and\nformulation of mathematical models.\n\nThe discipline of applied mathematics concerns itself with mathematical methods\nthat are typically used in science, engineering, business, and industry; thus,\n\"applied mathematics\" is a mathematical science with specialized knowledge. The\nterm \"applied mathematics\" also describes the professional specialty in which\nmathematicians work on problems, often concrete but sometimes abstract.
