It is a white crystalline solid that\nis volatile. The molecule consists of a phenyl group (-\nC<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>) bonded to a hydroxyl group (-OH). It is mildly\nacidic, but requires careful handling due to its propensity to cause burns.\n\nPhenol was first extracted from coal tar, but today is produced on a large scale\n(about 7 billion kg/year) from petroleum. It is an important industrial\ncommodity as a precursor to many materials and useful compounds.<ref\nname=\"Ullmann\">Manfred Weber, Markus Weber, Michael Kleine-Boymann \"Phenol\" in\nUllmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2004, Wiley-VCH. .</ref> Its\nmajor uses involve its conversion to plastics or related materials. Phenol and\nits chemical derivatives are key for building polycarbonates, epoxies, Bakelite,\nnylon, detergents, herbicides such as phenoxy herbicides, and numerous\npharmaceutical drugs.\n\nAlthough similar to alcohols, phenols have unique distinguishing properties.\nUnlike in alcohols where the hydroxyl group is bound to a saturated carbon\natom,<ref></ref> in phenols the hydroxyl group is attached to an unsaturated\nring such as benzene or other arene ring.<ref></ref> Consequently, phenols have\ngreater acidity than alcohols due to stabilization of the conjugate base through\nresonance in the aromatic ring.\n",
