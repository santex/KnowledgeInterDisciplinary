{"cursor":"95682","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The 'history of [[Northwestern University]]' can be traced back to a May 31,\n1850 meeting of nine prominent Chicago businessmen who shared a desire to\nestablish a university to serve the Northwest Territories. On January 28, 1851,\nthe Illinois General Assembly granted a charter to the Trustees of the North\nWestern University making it the first recognized university in\nIllinois. While the original founders were\ndevout Methodists and affiliated the university with Methodist Episcopal Church,\nthey were committed to non-sectarian admissions.\n\nJohn Evans purchased of land along Lake Michigan in 1853 and Philo Judson began\ndeveloping the plans for what would become the city of Evanston. The first\nbuilding, Old College, opened on November 5, 1855. As a private\nuniversity that had to raise funds for construction, Northwestern sold $100\n\"perpetual scholarships\" that entitled the purchaser and his heirs to free\ntuition. Northwestern\nadmitted its first female students in 1869.\n\nNorthwestern first fielded an intercollegiate football team in 1882 and later\nbecame a founding member of the Big Ten Conference. Northwestern became\naffiliated with professional schools of law, medicine, and dentistry throughout\nthe Chicago area in the 1870s and 1880s. Enrollments grew through the 1890s and\nunder Henry Wade Rogers these new programs were integrated into a modern\nresearch university combining professional, graduate, and undergraduate\nprograms, and emphasizing teaching along with research.\nThe Association of American Universities invited Northwestern to become a member\nin 1917. Under Walter Dill Scott's presidency from 1920 to 1939, Northwestern\nbegan construction of an integrated campus in downtown Chicago designed by James\nGamble Rogers to house the professional schools, the establishment of the\nKellogg School of Management, as well as opening new buildings on the Evanston\ncampus like Dyche Stadium and Deering Library. A proposal to merge Northwestern\nwith the University of Chicago was considered in 1933 but rejected by Northwestern. http://www.northwestern.edu/about/historic-\nmoments/academics/the-universities-of-chicago.html\n\nLike other American research universities, Northwestern was transformed by World\nWar II. Franklyn B. Snyder lead the university from 1939 to 1949 and during the\nwar nearly 50,000 military officers and personnel were trained on the Evanston\nand Chicago campuses. After the war surging enrollments under the G.I. Bill\ndrove drastic expansion of both campuses. J. Roscoe Miller's tenure from 1949 to\n1970 was responsible for the expansion of the Evanston campus with the\nconstruction of the Lakefill on Lake Michigan, growth of the faculty and new\nacademic programs, as well as polarizing Vietnam-era student protests. Tensions\nbetween the Evanston community and the university were strained throughout much\nof the post-war era given episodes of disruptive student activism,\nNorthwestern's exemption from property tax obligations, as well as restrictions\non the sale of alcohol near campus under the original charter although the\nlatter ban was lifted in 1972.\n\nAs government support of universities declined in the 1970s and 1980s, President\nArnold R. Weber oversaw the stabilization of university finances and\nrevitalization of the campuses. As admissions to colleges and universities grew\nincreasingly competitive throughout the 1990s and 2000s, Henry S. Bienen's\ntenure oversaw the increase in the number and quality of undergraduate\napplicants, continued expansion of the facilities and faculty, as well as\nrenewed athletic competitiveness.\n","linknr":1222,"url":"History_of_Northwestern_University","recorded":1375080211,"links":["/w/index.php?title=History_of_Northwestern_University&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=History_of_Northwestern_University&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Northwestern_University","/wiki/Northwest_Territory","/wiki/Illinois_General_Assembly","#cite_note-1","#cite_note-Charter-2","#endnote_anone","/wiki/Methodist","/wiki/Methodist_Episcopal_Church","/wiki/Non-sectarian","#cite_note-Planning_a_university-3","/w/index.php?title=Philo_Judson&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Evanston,_Illinois","#cite_note-4","#cite_note-5","#cite_note-Perpetual_scholarships-6","#cite_note-7","/wiki/Big_Ten_Conference","/wiki/Henry_Wade_Rogers","#cite_note-8","#cite_note-9","/wiki/Association_of_American_Universities","/wiki/Walter_Dill_Scott","/wiki/James_Gamble_Rogers","/wiki/Kellogg_School_of_Management","/wiki/Dyche_Stadium","/wiki/Deering_Library","/wiki/University_of_Chicago","#cite_note-10","/wiki/World_War_II","/wiki/Franklyn_B._Snyder","/wiki/G.I._Bill","/wiki/J._Roscoe_Miller","#cite_note-Dry_campus-11","/wiki/Arnold_R._Weber","/wiki/Henry_S._Bienen","#Foundation","#Early_years_.281855.E2.80.931905.29","#Symbols","#Student_activities","#Athletics","#Continued_expansion_.281905.E2.80.931939.29","#Chicago_campus","#University_of_Chicago_merger_proposal","#Technological_Institute","#Wartime_.281939.E2.80.931949.29","#Antecedents","#World_War_II","#Post-war_expansion","#Post-war_transition_.281949.E2.80.931970.29","#Lakefill_campus","#Big_Ten_athletics","#Racial_integration","#Anti-war_demonstrations","#Retooling_era_.281970.E2.80.931994.29","#Modern_era_.281994.E2.80.93present.29","#Footnotes_and_references","#Footnotes","#Notes","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=History_of_Northwestern_University&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/File:John_Evans.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/43/John_Evans.jpg/150px-John_Evans.jpg","/wiki/File:John_Evans.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/John_Evans_(governor)","/wiki/File:PerpetualScholarship.gif","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a4/PerpetualScholarship.gif","/wiki/File:PerpetualScholarship.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Chicago","#cite_note-W1-3-12","/wiki/Sectarian","#cite_note-W1-3-12","/wiki/John_Evans_(governor)","/w/index.php?title=Grant_Goodrich&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Henry_W._Clark&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Andrew_Brown","//toolserver.org/%7Edispenser/cgi-bin/dab_solver.py?page=History_of_Northwestern_University&editintro=Template:Disambiguation_needed/editintro&client=Template:Dn","/w/index.php?title=Orrington_Lunt&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Lake_Street_(Chicago)","/wiki/Methodist_Episcopal_Church","#cite_note-W1-3-12","#cite_note-Pridmore_11-18-13","/wiki/Methodist","#cite_note-Pridmore_11-18-13","#cite_note-14","/wiki/Non-sectarian","#cite_note-Pridmore_11-18-13","/wiki/Governor_of_Illinois","/wiki/Augustus_French","#cite_note-Pridmore_11-18-13","/wiki/Illinois","/wiki/Annual_Conferences_of_the_United_Methodist_Church","#cite_note-Planning_a_university-3","#cite_note-W1-3-12","#endnote_anone","/w/index.php?title=Jackson_Boulevard&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/LaSalle_Street","#cite_note-Planning_a_university-3","/wiki/File:Evanston_1876.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/7b/Evanston_1876.jpg/250px-Evanston_1876.jpg","/wiki/File:Evanston_1876.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Evanston,_Illinois","/wiki/Clark_T._Hinman","/wiki/Jefferson_Park,_Chicago","/wiki/Randolph_S._Foster","#cite_note-Vision-15","#cite_note-Pridmore_22-16","#cite_note-Pridmore_22-16","#cite_note-Rugged_terrain-17","/wiki/Evanston,_Illinois","#cite_note-18","#cite_note-Rugged_terrain-17","#cite_note-Perpetual_scholarships-6","#cite_note-Perpetual_scholarships-6","/wiki/Henry_S._Noyes","/w/index.php?title=Daniel_Bonright&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Randolph_S._Foster","/w/index.php?title=History_of_Northwestern_University&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/File:NU_University_Hall_1877.j
