The episode originally aired\non the Fox network on May 5, 2002. The teleplay for the episode was written by\nDavid Amann, from a story by John Shiban and Amann, and the entry was directed\nby Kim Manners. The episode helps to explore one of the show's story arc\ninvolving John Doggett finding the truth behind his son's murder. The episode\nearned a Nielsen rating of 5.1, being watched by 5.38 million households, and\n7.8 million viewers in its initial broadcast. The episode received largely\npositive reviews from critics.\n\nThe show centers on FBI special agents who work on cases linked to the\nparanormal, called X-Files; this season focuses on the investigations of John\nDoggett (Robert Patrick), Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish), and Dana Scully (Gillian\nAnderson). In this episode, Doggett stumbles upon a case that may hold a\nconnection to the murder of his son. With the help of an FBI cadet named Rudolph\nHayes (Jared Poe), Doggett acquires information to help his current case as well\nas establish the link between the present, his Jane Does, and the pastâhis son,\nLuke. The link is a man named Nicholas Regali, an organized crime participant\nwho has an association with Bob Harvey, the only suspect in Luke's case. Though\nthe cadet, Hayes, is not who he says he is, his information proves invaluable in\nDoggett's search for release from his son's death.\n\nThe idea for \"Release\" was developed by Shiban, who handed the script over to\nAmann. The character of Rudolph Hayes was crafted to be an ambitious character:\neither he was a genius who was adept at solving crime, comparable to Sherlock\nHolmes, or he was a criminal mastermind, like Professor Moriarty. The final\nscene, featuring Doggett scattering his son's ashes, was difficult for Patrick\nto film, but thanks to Manners' help, he was able to achieve the desired effect.\n","linknr":266,"url":"Release_(The_X-Files)","recorded":1362478024,"links":21,"instances":["season_9"],"pdf":[],"categories":["The X-Files (season 9) episodes","2002 television episodes"],"headings":["Plot","Production","Reception","Notes","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/94/Symbol_support_vote.svg/15px-Symbol_support_vote.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bb/Conan_doyle.jpg/175px-Conan_doyle.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Wikiquote-logo-en.svg/40px-Wikiquote-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["the_x-files","season_9"],["william","the_x-files"],["sunshine_days","the_x-files"],["the_x-files","season_9"],["underneath","the_x-files"],["jump_the_shark","the_x-files"]],"members":["underneath","sunshine_days","william","jump_the_shark"],"related":["John_Doggett","Monica_Reyes","The_X-Files","The_X-Files_(season_9)","Cary_Elwes","Brad_Follmer","Barbara_Patrick","David_Amann","John_Shiban","Kim_Manners","William_(The_X-Files)","Sunshine_Days_(The_X-Files)","The_X-Files_(season_9)","Science_fiction","Fox_Broadcasting_Company","David_Amann","John_Shiban","Kim_Manners","Story_arc","John_Doggett","Nielsen_rating","Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation","X-File","John_Doggett","Robert_Patrick","Monica_Reyes","Annabeth_Gish","Dana_Scully","Gillian_Anderson","Sherlock_Holmes","Professor_Moriarty","John_Doggett","Robert_Patrick","Dana_Scully","Gillian_Anderson","X-File","Monica_Reyes","Annabeth_Gish","FBI_Assistant_Director","Brad_Follmer","Cary_Elwes","Police_lineup","New_York_City","Pedophile","Professor_Moriarty","Arthur_Conan_Doyle","John_Shiban","David_Amman","Kim_Manners","Arthur_Conan_Doyle","Sherlock_Holmes","Professor_Moriarty","FBI_Academy","Robert_Patrick","United_States","BBC_Two","Nielsen_ratings","Television_Without_Pity","DVD_Talk","Robert_Shearman","Lars_Pearson","Fox_Mulder","David_Duchovny","Underneath_(The_X-Files)","Jump_the_Shark_(The_X-Files)","TV.com"]}
