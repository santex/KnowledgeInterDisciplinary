{"cursor":"8322","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In the oil and gas industry, 'depth in a well' is the measurement, for any point\nin that well, of the distance between a reference point or elevation, and that\npoint. It is the most common method of reference for locations in the well, and\ntherefore, in oil industry speech, \"depth\" also refers to the location itself.\n\nBy extension, depth can refer to locations below, or distances from, a reference\npoint or elevation, even when there is no well. In that sense, depth is a\nconcept related to elevation, albeit in the opposite direction. Depth in a well\nis not necessarily measured vertically or along a straight line.\n\nBecause wells are not always drilled vertically, there may be two \"depths\" for\nevery given point in a wellbore: the '[[measured depth]] (MD)' measured along\nthe path of the borehole, and the '[[true vertical depth]] (TVD)', the absolute\nvertical distance between the datum and the point in the wellbore. In perfectly\nvertical wells, the TVD equals the MD; otherwise, the TVD is less than the MD\nmeasured from the same datum. Common datums used are ground level (GL), drilling\nrig floor (DF), rotary table (RT), kelly bushing (KB) and mean sea level (MSL).\n","linknr":111,"url":"Depth_in_a_well","recorded":1362562888,"links":16,"instances":["logging_while_drilling","geodesy"],"pdf":["http://www.un.org/Depts/los/LEGISLATIONANDTREATIES/PDFFILES/aus_1994_sea_act.pdf"],"categories":["Earth sciences","Energy development","Petroleum production"],"headings":["The specification of depth","Depth in a well as used in the oil and gas industry","Depth in practice: examples from in the oil and gas industry in Australia","Figures","External references"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/9c/SpecDepth1.gif/220px-SpecDepth1.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/5a/SpecDepth2.gif/220px-SpecDepth2.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["datum","geodesy"],["rotary_table","drilling_rig#by_method_of_rotation_or_drilling_method"],["lwd","logging_while_drilling"]],"members":["lwd","rotary_table","datum"],"related":["Oil_industry","Elevation","Borehole","Datum_(geodesy)","Wellbore","Drilling_rig","Drill_floor","Rotary_table","Kelly_bushing","Mean_sea_level","Driller's_depth","Wireline_logging","Logger's_depth","Sea_floor","Mean_sea_level","Astronomical_tide","Stratigraphic","LWD_(Logging_While_Drilling)","Geologists","Geophysicists"]}
