It is composed of side plates, where each plate\nstraddles one end of a block and is connected to the block with a pin going\nthrough a hole at one end of the block. Block chain is simple, but compared to\nmodern roller chain is heavy and is less efficient rolling over sprockets due to\nthe lack of rolling motion as the chain engages and disengages the sprockets.\nHowever, it has advantages in specific applications and while not dimensionally\nstandard like roller chain, it is commonly used for specific applications,\nespecially where no sprockets are needed, loads are very high and strength is\ngreater concern than efficiency, and where the chain has special fixtures for\nholding or engaging a load. {{cite book\n| title = Chains for Power Transmission and Material Handling publisher = Marcel\n| Dekker, Inc. date = 1982}}\n","linknr":81,"url":"Block_chain","recorded":1362476864,"links":13,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Chain drives","Chains"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Chain","Roller_chain"]}
