{"cursor":"17461","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Ion-mobility spectrometry' ('IMS') is an analytical technique used to separate\nand identify ionized molecules in the gas phase based on their mobility in a\ncarrier buffer gas. Though heavily employed for military or security purposes,\nsuch as detecting drugs and explosives, the technique also has many laboratory\nanalytical applications, recently being coupled with mass spectrometry and high-\nperformance liquid chromatography. IMS devices come in a wide range of sizes\n(often tailored for a specific application) and are capable of operating under a\nbroad range of conditions. Systems operated at higher pressure (i.e. atmospheric\nconditions, 1 atm or 1013 mbar) are also accompanied by elevated temperature\n(above 100Â°C), while lower pressure systems (1-20 mbar) do not require heating.\n","linknr":255,"url":"Ion-mobility_spectrometry","recorded":1362553019,"links":20,"instances":["physics","physics","bloomington"],"pdf":["http://tracedetection.net/Itemiser_White_Paper.pdf"],"categories":["Mass spectrometry","Explosives detection"],"headings":["History","Ion mobility","Instrumentation","Combined IMS methods","Applications","See also","References","Bibliography","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/math/6/2/1/621e8048ee657d927e3ebec4c24b1a96.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/9/9/79914d9a8a48677728bcfaadd692a9a4.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/2/1/f219d840c7fe21382115160aeb052999.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/3/e/e3ed8a535da38f447f9c06aa3f3f66ac.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/3/8/e38cdbe7354e926c7df685e33d8a6792.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/66/Ion_mobility_spectrometry_diagram.svg/500px-Ion_mobility_spectrometry_diagram.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9f/Yuj.jpg/200px-Yuj.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/IMS1.jpg/200px-IMS1.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["charge","physics"],["cross_section","physics"],["indiana_university","bloomington"]],"members":["cross_section","charge","indiana_university"],"related":["Mass_spectrometry","High-performance_liquid_chromatography","Earl_W._McDaniel","Georgia_Institute_of_Technology","Physical_quantity","Charge_(physics)","Number_density","Reduced_mass","Boltzmann_constant","Temperature","Cross_section_(physics)","Ionization","Corona_discharge","Photoionization","Electrospray_ionization","Radioactive","Nickel","Americium","Smoke_detector","MALDI","Electric_field","Control_grid","Triode","Bradbury-Nielsen_shutter","Ion_mobility","Differential_mobility_spectrometer","High-field_asymmetric_waveform_ion_mobility_spectrometry","Differential_mobility_analyzer","Sector_instruments","Mass_spectrometry","Differential_Mobility_Detector","Varian_Associates","Faraday_plate","Ion_mobility_spectrometry-mass_spectrometry","Mass_spectrometer","Ion","Electric_field","HPLC","Indiana_University_(Bloomington)","Explosive","Illegal_drug_trade","Chemical_weapons","Smiths_Group","Cleaning_validation","HPLC","Total_organic_carbon","Proteomics","Metabolomics","MALDI","Electric_field","Metabolomics","Lung_cancer","Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease","Sarcoidosis","Lung_transplantation","Bacteria","Lung","Electrical_mobility","Viehland-Mason_Theory","Explosive_detection"]}
