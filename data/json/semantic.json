It focuses on the relation between signifiers, like words,\nphrases, signs, and symbols, and what they stand for, their denotation.\n\nLinguistic semantics is the study of meaning that is used for understanding\nhuman expression through language. Other forms of semantics include the\nsemantics of programming languages, formal logics, and semiotics.\n\nThe word semantics itself denotes a range of ideas, from the popular to the\nhighly technical. It is often used in ordinary language for denoting a problem\nof understanding that comes down to word selection or connotation. This problem\nof understanding has been the subject of many formal enquiries, over a long\nperiod of time, most notably in the field of formal semantics. In linguistics,\nit is the study of interpretation of signs or symbols used in agents or\ncommunities within particular circumstances and contexts.<ref name=\"Neurath1955\"\n/> Within this view, sounds, facial expressions, body language, and proxemics\nhave semantic (meaningful) content, and each comprises several branches of\nstudy. In written language, things like paragraph structure and punctuation bear\nsemantic content; other forms of language bear other semantic content.<ref\nname=\"Neurath1955\">{{cite book |last1=Neurath |first1=Otto |authorlink1=Otto\nNeurath |last2=Carnap |first2=Rudolf |authorlink2=Rudolf Carnap |last3=Morris\n|first3=Charles F.

The formal study of semantics is therefore complex.\n\nSemantics contrasts with syntax, the study of the combinatorics of units of a\nlanguage (without reference to their meaning), and pragmatics, the study of the\nrelationships between the symbols of a language, their meaning, and the users of\nthe language.<ref>{{cite book |title=Scientific Explanation\n|publisher=University of Minnesota Press |last=Kitcher |first=Philip\n|last2=Salmon |first2=Wesley C. |year=1989 |place=Minneapolis, MN\n|page=35}}</ref>\n\nIn international scientific vocabulary semantics is also called [[semasiology]].\n","title":"semantics","headings":["Linguistics","Logic and mathematics","Computer science","Psychology","See also","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["3: Semiotics","3: Syntax","3: Philosophy_of_language","2: Linguistics","2: Pragmatics","2: Generative_lexicon","2: Semantic_change","2: Proposition","2: VyÄkaraá¹a","2: Nyaya","2: Archetype","2: Mathematical_logic","2: Computer_science","2: Formal_semantics_of_programming_languages","2: Semantic_Web","2: Ideasthesia","1: Ancient_Greek","1: Word","1: Phrase","1: Sign","1: Symbol","1: Denotation","1: Connotation","1: Community","1: Proxemics","1: International_Encyclopedia_of_Unified_Science","1: University_of_Chicago_Press","1: Lexicology","1: Etymology","1: Palgrave_MacMillan","1: Reference","1: Philology","1: Communication","1: University_of_Minnesota_Press","1: International_scientific_vocabulary","1: Discourse","1: Homonym","1: Synonym","1: Antonym","1: Hypernym","1: Hyponym","1: Meronymy","1: Metonymy","1: Holonymy","1: Truth_condition","1: Thematic_relation","1: Discourse_analysis","1: Richard_Montague","1: Lambda_calculus","1: Parsing","1: Alfred_Tarski","1: Language_of_thought","1: Montague_grammar","1: Situation_semantics","1: Truth-value","1: Noam_Chomsky","1: Psychological_nativism","1: Metaphor","1: Qualia","1: Mental_rotation","1: Lexical_unit","1: Cognitive_linguistics","1: Jerry_Fodor","1: Indexical","1: Context_change_potential","1: Wittgenstein","1: Willard_Van_Orman_Quine","1: Underspecification","1: MIT_Press","1: Bradford_Books","1: Ferdinand_de_Saussure","1: Mimamsa","1: James_Pustejovsky","1: Prototype_theory","1: Eleanor_Rosch","1: Jung","1: Post-structuralists","1: Words","1: Derrida","1: Nietzsche","1: Embodied_philosophy","1: Linguistic_relativity","1: Eskimo_words_for_snow","1: Gottlob_Frege","1: Bertrand_Russell","1: Analytic_philosophy","1: Ludwig_Wittgenstein","1: Truth_conditions","1: Programming_language","1: C++","1: Perl","1: PHP","1: ALGOL","1: BCPL","1: Simula","1: ALGOL_68","1: SETL","1: Smalltalk","1: Modula-2","1: Standard_ML","1: OCaml","1: Object_Pascal","1: VHDL","1: Assembly_language","1: Intel_8086","1: BASIC","1: Fortran","1: MATLAB","1: CachÃ©_ObjectScript","1: COBOL","1: Batch","1: Common_Lisp","1: PostScript","1: John_Wiley_&_Sons","1: Operational_semantics","1: Denotational_semantics","1: Axiomatic_semantics","1: Directed_graph","1: World_Wide_Web","1: Metadata","1: Resource_Description_Framework","1: Web_Ontology_Language","1: Psychology","1: Episodic_memory","1: Semantic_network","1: Wordnet","1: Ontologies","1: Latent_semantic_indexing","1: Support_vector_machines","1: Natural_language_processing","1: Neural_networks","1: Predicate_calculus","1: Analysis_of_subjective_logics","1: Asemic_writing","1: Cognitive_semantics","1: Colorless_green_ideas_sleep_furiously","1: Computational_semantics","1: Discourse_representation_theory","1: General_semantics","1: Generative_semantics","1: Hermeneutics","1: Natural_semantic_metalanguage","1: Onomasiology","1: Phono-semantic_matching","1: Pragmatic_maxim","1: Pragmaticism","1: Pragmatism","1: Problem_of_universals","1: Semantic_class","1: Semantic_feature","1: Semantic_field","1: Semantic_lexicon","1: Semantic_primes","1: Semantic_property","1: Semeiotic","1: Sememe","1: Semiosis","1: SPL_notation","1: Formal_logic","1: Game_semantics","1: Model_theory","1: GÃ¶del's_incompleteness_theorems","1: Proof-theoretic_semantics","1: Semantic_consequence","1: Semantic_theory_of_truth","1: Semantics_of_logic","1: Truth-value_semantics","1: Knowledge_representation","1: Semantic_networks","1: Semantic_Transversal","1: Semantic_compression","1: Semantic_HTML","1: Semantic_integration","1: Semantic_interpretation","1: Semantic_link","1: Semantic_Reasoner","1: Semantic_service_oriented_architecture","1: Semantic_spectrum","1: Semantic_Unification"]}
