{"cursor":"11675","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nIn physics and electrical engineering, a 'conductor' is an object or type of\nmaterial which permits the flow of electric charges in one or more directions.\nFor example, an insulated wire is an electrical conductor as it can carry\nelectricity along its length (but not across its width).\n\nIn metallic conductive materials such as copper or aluminum, the movable\ncharged particles are electrons (see electrical conduction). Positive charges\nmay also be mobile, such as the cationic electrolyte(s) of a battery, or the\nmobile protons of the proton conductor of a fuel cell. Insulators are non-\nconducting materials with few mobile charges and which support only\ninsignificant electric currents.\n","linknr":356,"url":"Conductor_(material)","recorded":1362485729,"links":76,"instances":["electricity","electricity","physics","electrical","letter","unit","metallurgy","letter","electromagnetism"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Electricity","Hardware (mechanical)","Power engineering","Concepts in physics"],"headings":["Physics","Wire size","Conductance","Conductor materials","Conductor ampacity","Isotropy","Bibliography","References","External links","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/VFPt_Solenoid_correct2.svg/190px-VFPt_Solenoid_correct2.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/Electrical_wires_near_Putim.jpg/220px-Electrical_wires_near_Putim.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/68/Resistivity_geometry.png/220px-Resistivity_geometry.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/5/3/853a451ad123a6c08163b6cfdac958ef.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/b/d/a/bda8dbf607a2a9911b9faae7fadaaec5.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/3/3/4/334ce9eb79df1178b0380461c9eaa09e.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/8/f/48ff6254834dff6a7706d6c37b055bbe.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["battery","electricity"],["insulator","electricity"],["plasma","physics"],["sigma","letter"],["siemens","unit"],["rho","letter"],["proximity_effect","electromagnetism"],["plasma","physics"],["annealing","metallurgy"],["fuse","electrical"]],"members":["battery","insulator","plasma","fuse","sigma","siemens","annealing","rho","proximity_effect"],"related":["Physics","Electrical_engineering","Electric_charge","Wire","Metal","Copper","Aluminum","Electron","Electrical_conduction","Electrolyte","Battery_(electricity)","Proton_conductor","Insulator_(electricity)","Electric_current","Electrical_charge","Volt","Ampere","Direct_current","Ohm's_law","Copper","Copper_wire_and_cable","Silver","Gold","Graphite","Salts","Plasma_(physics)","Conductive_polymers","Electrical_conduction","Superconductor","Electromagnetic_field","Printed_circuit_board","Sea_of_electrons","American_wire_gauge","Circular_mils","Metre","Square_metre","Sigma_(letter)","Electrical_conductivity","Siemens_(unit)","Rho_(letter)","Electrical_resistivity","Multiplicative_inverse","Current_density","Alternating_current","Skin_effect","Proximity_effect_(electromagnetism)","Utility_frequency","Busbar","Electrical_substation","Metal","Electrolyte","Superconductor","Semiconductor","Plasma_(physics)","Graphite","Conductive_polymer","Copper","Electrical_conductivity","Annealing_(metallurgy)","Motor","Busbar","ASTM","Welding","Braze","Oxygen-free_copper","Soldering","Silver","Satellite","Skin_effect","Aluminum","Coefficient_of_thermal_expansion","Anodizing","Ampacity","Electric_current","Fuse_(electrical)","Polyvinyl_chloride","Fire","Teflon","Fiberglass","American_wire_gauge","Electric_field","Electric_current","Resistivity","Charge_transfer_complex","Bundle_conductor","Superconductivity","Semiconductor"]}
