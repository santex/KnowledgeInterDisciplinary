{"cursor":"24585","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"{{Multiple issues|1=\n\n\n}}\n\n'Game mechanics' are constructs of s intended to produce a game or gameplay. All\ngames use mechanics; however, theories and styles differ as to their ultimate\nimportance to the game. In general, the process and study of game design, or\nLudology, are efforts to come up with game mechanics that allow for people\nplaying a game to have an engaging, but not necessarily fun, experience.\n\nThe interaction of various game mechanics in a game determine the complexity and\nlevel of player interaction in the game, and in conjunction with the game's\nenvironment and resources determines game balance. Some forms of game mechanics\nhave been used in games for centuries, while others are relatively new, having\nbeen invented within the past decade.\n\nComplexity in game mechanics should not be confused with or even realism. Go is\nperhaps one of the simplest of all games, yet exhibits extraordinary depth of\nplay. Most computer or video games feature mechanics that are technically\ncomplex (when expressed in terms of making a human do all the calculations\ninvolved) even in relatively simple designs.\n\nIn general, commercial video games have gone from simple designs (such as\n[[Space Invaders]] and [[Asteroids (computer game)|Asteroids]]) to extremely\ncomplex ones (such as [[Gran Turismo 5]] and [[Crysis 2]]) as processing power\nhas increased. In contrast, casual games have generally featured a return to\nsimple, puzzle-like designs, though some are getting more complex. In physical\ngames, differences generally come down to style, and are somewhat determined by\nintended market.\n","linknr":291,"url":"Game_mode","recorded":1362552217,"links":20,"instances":["gaming","game","gaming","game","game","geometry","gaming","goal","board_game","economics","economics","video_gaming","board_game","arts"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Game design","Video game design","Video game terminology"],"headings":["Game mechanics vs. gameplay","Game mechanics vs. theme","Game mechanics","Victory condition mechanics","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["resource","economics"],["realism","arts"],["go","board_game"],["objective","goal"],["go","board_game"],["go","board_game"],["square","geometry"],["miniature_figure","gaming"],["land","economics"],["score","gaming"],["level","video_gaming"],["campaign","role-playing_game"],["deathmatch","gaming"],["hangman","game"],["zendo","game"],["ludo","board_game"],["concentration","game"],["go","board_game"]],"members":["deathmatch","concentration","miniature_figure","hangman","zendo","square","score","objective","go","resource","land","level","ludo","campaign","realism"],"related":["Game","Gameplay","Game_design","Resource_(economics)","Game_balance","Realism_(arts)","Go_(board_game)","PC_game","Video_game","Video_game_industry","Processing_power","Casual_games","Puzzle_video_game","Exergaming","Gameplay","Poker","Golf","Objective_(goal)","Go_(board_game)","German-style_board_game","Wargaming","Game_classification","Simulation_game","Wargaming","Sports_game","American_football","Semi-simultaneous","Impulse-based_turn","German-style_board_game","Trick-taking_game","Contract_bridge","Randomness","Board_game","Chess","Pachisi","Draughts","Go_(board_game)","Backgammon","Shogi","Zero-sum","Cube","Polyhedron","Symbol","Board_game","Board_game","Square_(geometry)","Miniature_wargaming","Miniature_figure_(gaming)","Ruler","Naval","Turning_key","Resource_management","Land_(economics)","Natural_resource","Human_resources","Score_(gaming)","Risk","Role-playing_games","Fictional_character","Narrativist","Tile-based_game","Tessellation","Archaeology","Single_player","Multiplayer_game","Cooperative_gameplay","Competitive_gaming","Power-up","Pac-Man","Goal","Level_(video_gaming)","Experience_point","Ammo","Timer","Game_physics","Poker","Campaign_(role-playing_game)","Deathmatch_(gaming)","Hangman_(game)","Zendo_(game)","Racing","Backgammon","Ludo_(board_game)","Concentration_(game)","Poker","Wargaming","Go_(board_game)","Game_clock","Kingmaker_scenario","Pie_rule","Gamification","Dynamic_game_difficulty_balancing","BoardGameGeek","Tech_Crunch"]}
