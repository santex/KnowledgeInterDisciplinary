Though an individual tree is\npermanently fixed in a location, tree populations may migrate over the landscape\nthrough generations. Tree migration is controlled by two overlying forces:\nenvironmental suppression and dispersal capacity of the population by seed. Though the true rate of forest expansion is difficult to\nquantify, efforts are being made to evaluate and predict past, current, and\nfuture rates and extents of forest movements.\n","linknr":266,"url":"Forest_migration","recorded":1362668803,"links":11,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Forestry"],"headings":["Forces controlling forest migrations","Zones within a plant population","Rapid plant migration","Forest migrations past, present and future","Current climate change and its effects","Human assistance in forest migration","See also","References","Further reading"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Spermatophyte","Seed_dispersal","Climate_change","Glacial_period","Glacier","Fat-tailed_distribution","Holocene","Pollen","Molecular_genetics","Phenotypic_plasticity","Scandinavia","Catalonia","Microclimate","Sapling","Climate_change","Global_warming","Habitat","Greenhouse_gas","Phenology","Assisted_migration","Genotype","Biodiversity","Seed_dispersal"]}
