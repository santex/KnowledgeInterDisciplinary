The handicap principle suggests\nthat reliable signals must be costly to the signaler, costing the signaler\nsomething that could not be afforded by an individual with less of a particular\ntrait. For example, in the case of sexual selection, the theory suggests that\nanimals of greater biological fitness signal this status through handicapping\nbehaviour or morphology that effectively lowers this quality. The central idea\nis that sexually selected traits function like conspicuous consumption,\nsignalling the ability to afford to squander a resource simply by squandering\nit. Receivers know that the signal indicates quality because inferior quality\nsignallers cannot afford to produce such wastefully extravagant signals.\n\nThe generality of the phenomenon is the matter of some debate and disagreement,\nand Zahavi's views on the scope and importance of handicaps in biology remain\noutside the mainstream.
