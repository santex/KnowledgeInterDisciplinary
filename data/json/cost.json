In this case, money\nis the input that is gone in order to acquire the thing. This acquisition cost\nmay be the sum of the cost of production as incurred by the original producer,\nand further costs of transaction as incurred by the acquirer over and above the\nprice paid to the producer. Usually, the price also includes a mark-up for\nprofit over the cost of production.\n\nMore generalized in the field of economics, cost is a metric that is totaling up\nas a result of a process or as a differential for the result of a\ndecision.<ref>{{cite book\n  | last = Sullivan first = arthur authorlink = Arthur O' Sullivan coauthors =\n  | Steven M.
