With the\nexception of hydrogen-1, nuclei of atoms consist of protons and neutrons, which\nare therefore collectively referred to as nucleons. The number of protons in a\nnucleus is the atomic number and defines the type of element the atom forms.\nNeutrons are necessary within an atomic nucleus as they bind with protons via\nthe nuclear force; protons are unable to bind with each other (see diproton)\nbecause their mutual electromagnetic repulsion is stronger than the attraction\nof the nuclear force.

The number of neutrons is the neutron number and determines the\nisotope of an element. For example, the abundant carbon-12 isotope has 6 protons\nand 6 neutrons, while the very rare radioactive carbon-14 isotope has 6 protons\nand 8 neutrons.\n\nWhile bound neutrons in stable nuclei are stable, free neutrons are unstable;\nthey undergo beta decay with a mean lifetime of just under 15 minutes (). Free neutrons are produced in nuclear fission and fusion. Dedicated\nneutron sources like neutron generators, research reactors and spallation\nsources produce free neutrons for use in irradiation and in neutron scattering\nexperiments. Even though it is not a chemical element, the free neutron is\nsometimes included in tables of nuclides. [http://www.nndc.bnl.gov/nudat2\nNudat 2]. Nndc.bnl.gov. Retrieved on 2010-12-04.\n\nThe neutron has been the key to nuclear power production. The neutron was\ndiscovered in 1932, and in 1933, it was realized that it might mediate a nuclear\nchain reaction. In the 1930s, neutrons were used to produce many different types\nof nuclear transmutations. When nuclear fission was discovered in 1938, it\nbecame clear that, if the process also produced neutrons, this might be the\nmechanism to produce the neutrons for a chain reaction. This was proven in 1939,\nopening the path to nuclear power production. These events and findings led\ndirectly to the first self-sustaining, man-made, nuclear chain reaction (Chicago\nPile-1, 1942) and to the first nuclear weapons (1945).\n","linknr":987,"url":"Neutron","recorded":1362375472,"links":133,"instances":["chemical_engineering","physics","statistics","physics","physicist","biology","journal","unit"],"pdf":["http://pdg.lbl.gov/2011/listings/rpp2011-list-n.pdf","http://www.springerlink.com/content/ek2q156624661848/fulltext.pdf","http://www.springerlink.com/content/ek2q156624661848/fulltext.pdf","http://ambartsumian.ru/dvd/Publications/Papers/1930DANSSSR___153A.pdf","http://pdg.lbl.gov/2007/tables/bxxx.pdf","http://www.physicamedica.com/VOLXVII_S1/20-CLOWDSLEY%20et%20alii.pdf","http://www.physicamedica.com/VOLXVII_S1/20-CLOWDSLEY%20et%20alii.pdf"],"categories":["Baryons","Neutron|"],"headings":["Discovery","Intrinsic
