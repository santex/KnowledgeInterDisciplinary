The natural occurrence of genetic mutations is integral to the\nprocess of evolution. The study of mutants is an integral part of biology; by\nunderstanding the effect that a mutation in a gene has, it is possible to\nestablish the normal function of that\ngene. http://www.pnas.org/content/68/9/2112.abstract Clock Mutants of\nDrosophila melanogaster\n\nIn some organisms mutants can be created by gene targeting to assess the\nfunction of any given gene. This experimental approach is called reverse\ngenetics. Ralf Reski (1998): Physcomitrella and Arabidopsis: the David\nand Goliath of reverse genetics.
