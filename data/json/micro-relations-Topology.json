More precisely, topology studies properties that are preserved\nunder continuous deformations, including stretching and bending, but not tearing\nor gluing. The exact mathematical definition is given below. Topology developed\nas a field of study out of geometry and set theory, through analysis of such\nconcepts as space, dimension, and transformation.\n\nIdeas that are now classified as topological were expressed as early as 1736.\nToward the end of the 19th century, a distinct discipline developed, which was\nreferred to in Latin as the geometria situs (âgeometry of placeâ) or analysis\nsitus (Greek-Latin for âpicking apart of placeâ). This later acquired the modern\nname of topology . By the middle of the 20th century, topology\nhad become an important area of study within mathematics.\n\nTopology has many subfields. '[[General topology|Point-set topology]]'\nestablishes the foundational aspects of topology and investigates concepts\ninherent to topological spaces (basic examples include compactness and\nconnectedness). '[[Algebraic topology]]' tries to measure degrees of\nconnectivity using algebraic constructs such as homology and homotopy groups.\n'[[Geometric topology]]' primarily studies manifolds and their embeddings\n(placements) in other manifolds. A particularly active area in geometric\ntopology is '[[low dimensional topology]]', which studies manifolds of four\nor fewer dimensions. This includes '[[knot theory]]', the study of\nmathematical knots.\n\n, the simplest non-trivial knot]]\n\nSee also: topology glossary for definitions of some of the terms used in\ntopology and
