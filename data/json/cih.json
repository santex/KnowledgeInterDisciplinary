It is one of the most damaging\nviruses, overwriting critical information on infected system drives, and more\nimportantly, in most cases overwriting the system BIOS. The virus was created by\nChen Ing-hau (陳盈豪, pinyin: Chén Yíngháo) who was a student at Tatung University\nin Taiwan.<ref name=ithome>ithome.com.tw.\n[http://www.ithome.com.tw/itadm/article.php?c=38975 從CIH「重裝駭客」變身「除錯超人」]. 2006-08-\n25. </ref> 60 million computers were believed to be infected by the virus\ninternationally, resulting in an estimated $1 billion US dollars in commercial\ndamages.<ref name=ithome/>\n\nChen claimed to have written the virus as a challenge against bold claims of\nantiviral efficiency by antivirus software developers.<ref\nname=parenting>parenting.com.tw.\n[http://www.parenting.com.tw/article/article.action?id=5020407\n從駭電腦到愛旅行─昔日網路小子陳盈豪] </ref> Chen stated that after the virus was spread across\nTatung University by classmates, he apologized to the school and made an\nantivirus program available for public download; the antivirus program was co-\nauthored with Weng Shi-hao (翁世豪), a student at Tamkang University.<ref\nname=parenting/> Prosecutors in Taiwan could not charge Chen at the time because\nno victims came forward with a lawsuit.<ref>cyy.moj.gov.tw.\n[http://www.cyy.moj.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=24238&ctNode=13535 打擊駭客，不再無法可施]</ref>\nThese events led to new computer crime legislation in Taiwan.<ref\nname=parenting/>\n\nThe name \"Chernobyl Virus\" was coined some time after the virus was already well\nknown as CIH, and refers to the complete coincidence of the payload trigger date\nin some variants of the virus (actually the virus creation date in 1998, to\ntrigger exactly a year later) and the Chernobyl accident, which happened in the\nUkrainian SSR on April 26, 1986.\n\nThe name \"Spacefiller\" was introduced because most viruses write their code to\nthe end of the infected file, however CIH looks for gaps in the existing program\ncode where it writes its own code. This does not increase the file size and in\nthat way helps the virus avoid detection.\n","title":"CIH%20%28computer%20virus%29","headings":["History","Virus specifics","See also","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["3: BIOS","2: Windows_9x","2: Kilobyte","1: Computer_virus","1: Pinyin","1: Tatung_University","1: Taiwan","1: US_dollar","1: Antivirus_software","1: Tamkang_University","1: Antragsdelikt","1: Computer_crime","1: Chernobyl_accident","1: Ukrainian_SSR","1: Yamaha_Corporation","1: Firmware","1: Activision","1: IBM","1: Aptiva","1: Asia","1: Boot_drive","1: BIOS_chip","1: Hard_disk","1: Windows_95","1: Windows_98","1: Windows_Me","1: ILOVEYOU","1: VBScript","1: Jennifer_Lopez","1: Gigabyte_Technology","1: Portable_Executable","1: Megabyte","1: Hard_drive","1: Disk_sector","1: Master_boot_record#Sector_layout","1: Intel","1: List_of_Intel_chipsets#Pentium_chipsets","1: File_Allocation_Table","1: Gigabyte","1: Master_boot_record","1: Boot_sector","1: List_of_computer_viruses","1: Timeline_of_notable_computer_viruses_and_worms"]}
