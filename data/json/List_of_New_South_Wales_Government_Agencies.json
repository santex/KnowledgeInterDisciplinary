{"cursor":"33513","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Government in New South Wales' is delivered by a number of 'agencies', grouped\nunder areas of portfolio responsibility. Each portfolio is led by a minister\nappointed from the Parliament of New South Wales. From July 2009 portfolios,\npreviously led by a department of the same name, were regrouped into 13 'super\ndepartments' each led by a Director-General and comprising a number of\nportfolios covering specific policy areas across the department and allocated\nstatutory authorities, trading enterprises, boards, councils and other public\nbodies. In April 2011 following the election of a new state government, agencies\nwere further aggregated around 9 clusters or 'principal departments'.\n\nAgencies have varying levels of operational autonomy, and deliver one or more of\nfrontline public services, administrative functions and law enforcement. Some\nare structured as for-profit corporations. Where there are multiple portfolios\nwithin a department, Directors-General may be accountable to a number of\nministers. The responsibilities and goals of many agencies are set in the 2006\nNew South Wales State Plan.\n\nAll agencies are identifiable by their corporate logo, which features in agency\nadvertising, publications and correspondence. Many agency insignia have recently\nbeen updated as a result of the State Arms, Symbols and Emblems Act\n2004., requiring the replacement of the British Coat of Arms with the\nemblem of New South Wales.\n\nTo see a list of articles on New South Wales government agencies sorted\nalphabetically, . The New South Wales government maintains a list of agencies\nand their contact details [http://www.directory.nsw.gov.au/ at its website].\n","linknr":468,"url":"List_of_New_South_Wales_Government_Agencies","recorded":1375079460,"links":["/w/index.php?title=List_of_New_South_Wales_government_agencies&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=List_of_New_South_Wales_government_agencies&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","/wiki/List_of_New_South_Wales_government_agencies","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","/w/index.php?title=List_of_New_South_Wales_Government_Agencies&redirect=no","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:New_South_Wales_coa.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/30/New_South_Wales_coa.png","/wiki/File:New_South_Wales_coa.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Parliament_of_New_South_Wales","/wiki/New_South_Wales_State_Plan","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Category:Government_agencies_of_New_South_Wales","http://www.directory.nsw.gov.au/","#Attorney_General_and_Justice","#Attorney_General","#Justice","#Police_and_Emergency_Services","#Education_and_Communities","#Communities","#Education","#Family_and_Community_Services","#Finance_and_Services","#Health","#Local_Hospital_Districts_and_Networks","#Premier_and_Cabinet","#Planning_and_Infrastructure","#Local_Government","#Environment_and_Heritage","#Trade_and_Investment.2C_Regional_Infrastructure_and_Services","#Department_of_Primary_Industries","#Catchment_management_authorities","#Industry.2C_Innovation_and_Investment","#Resources_and_Energy","#Transport","#The_Treasury","#References","/w/index.php?title=List_of_New_South_Wales_government_agencies&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Department_of_Attorney_General_and_Justice_(New_South_Wales)","/wiki/Attorney_General_of_New_South_Wales","/wiki/Minister_for_Justice_(New_South_Wales)","/wiki/Greg_Smith_(New_South_Wales_politician)","/wiki/Senior_Counsel","/w/index.php?title=List_of_New_South_Wales_government_agencies&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Crown_Solicitor%27s_Office_(New_South_Wales)","/wiki/Council_of_Law_Reporting_for_New_South_Wales","/wiki/Guardianship_Tribunal_of_New_South_Wales","/wiki/Judicial_Commission_of_New_South_Wales","/wiki/Law_Reform_Commission_of_New_South_Wales","/w/index.php?title=Legal_Aid_Commission_of_New_South_Wales&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Office_of_the_Director_of_Public_Prosecutions_(New_South_Wales)&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Office_of_the_Information_Commissioner","/w/index.php?title=Office_of_the_New_South_Wales_Sheriff&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Privacy_New_South_Wales&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Public_Trustee_New_South_Wales&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/The_New_South_Wales_Victims_Compensation_Tribunal","/w/index.php?title=List_of_New_South_Wales_government_agencies&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/Corrective_Services_NSW","/wiki/Juvenile_Justice_NSW","/w/index.php?title=New_South_Wales_Parole_Board&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=New_South_Wales_Serious_Offenders_Review_Council&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Young_Offenders_Advisory_Council&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=List_of_New_South_Wales_government_agencies&action=edit&section=4","/wiki/New_South_Wales_Ministry_for_Police_and_Emergency_Services","/wiki/Minister_for_Police_and_Emergency_Services_(New_South_Wales)","/wiki/Michael_Gallacher","/w/index.php?title=Emergency_Management_NSW,_New_South_Wales&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Fire_and_Rescue_NSW","/wiki/New_South_Wales_Crime_Commission","/wiki/New_South_Wales_Police","/wiki/New_South_Wales_Rural_Fire_Service","/wiki/New_South_Wales_State_Emergency_Service","/wiki/State_Emergency_Service","/w/index.php?title=List_of_New_South_Wales_government_agencies&action=edit&section=5","/wiki/New_South_Wales_Department_of_Education_and_Training","/wiki/Minister_for_Education_(New_South_Wales)","/wiki/Adrian_Piccoli","/wiki/Victor_Dominello","/wiki/Minister_for_Sport_and_Recreation_(New_South_Wales)","/wiki/Graham_Annesley","/w/index.php?title=List_of_New_South_Wales_government_agencies&action=edit&section=6","/w/index.php?title=Office_of_Communities&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Community_Relations_Commission_of_New_South_Wales&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/State_Sports_Centre","/w/index.php?title=Combat_Sports_Authority_of_New_South_Wales&action=edi
