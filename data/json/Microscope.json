The\nscience of investigating small objects using such an instrument is called\nmicroscopy. Microscopic means invisible to the eye unless aided by a microscope.\n\nThere are many types of microscopes, the most common and first to be invented is\nthe optical microscope which uses light to image the sample. Other major types\nof microscopes are the electron microscope (both the transmission electron\nmicroscope and the scanning electron microscope) and the various types of\nscanning probe microscope.\n","linknr":484,"url":"Microscope","recorded":1362512975,"links":106,"instances":["vision","optics","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Dutch inventions","Microbiology
