Research at the Institute focuses on improving how water and land\nresources are managed, with the aim of underpinning food security and reducing\npoverty while safeguarding vital environmental processes.\n\nAs water becomes scarcer, there is a growing need to find ways to produce\nsufficient food to feed the worldâs expanding population, while using less\nwater, safeguarding fragile environmental services and without having much\nopportunity to open up new agricultural lands. The Institute undertakes research\nprojects with this aim in mind.\n\nIts research focuses on: water availability and access, including adaptation to\nclimate change; how water is used and how it can be used more productively;\nwater quality and its relationship to health and the environment; and how\nsocieties govern their water resources. In 2012, IWMI was awarded the\nprestigious Stockholm Water Prize Laureate by Stockholm International Water\nInstitute for its pioneering research, which has helped to improve agricultural\nwater management, enhance food security, protect environmental health and\nalleviate poverty in developing\ncountries.
