{"cursor":"7224","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nThe 'Separate Baptists' were an 18th-century group of Baptists in the United\nStates, primarily in the South, that grew out of the Great Awakening.\n\nThe Great Awakening was a religious revival and revitalization of piety among\nthe Christian churches. It covered English-speaking countries and swept through\nthe American colonies between the 1730s and the 1770s. Three important preachers\nof the times were Gilbert Tennent (1703â65), Jonathan Edwards (1703â58), and\nGeorge Whitefield (1714â70). The Separate Baptists are most directly connected\nto Whitefield's influence. The first identifiable congregation of Separate\nBaptists was formed in Boston, Massachusetts. Whitefield preached in Boston in\n1740. The pastor of the Baptist church disapproved of the revival excitement,\nwhile several members approved of it and became discontented with the pastor's\nministry. They withdrew from the First Baptist Church and formed Second Baptist\nChurch in 1743.\n\nThe Great Awakening served to both invigorate and divide churches. Many\ndenominations divided into Old Lights â holding a low view of the revivalism,\nand sometimes directly opposing it â and New Lights â who enthusiastically\nembraced it. Many New Lights felt that the old ways had allowed too many\nunconverted church members, and by the end of the 1740s some of the New Lights\nbelieved the established churches could not be reformed from within and withdrew\nfrom them. A favorite verse among them was II Corinthians 6:17 â \"Come out from\namong them, and be ye separate.\" This led to them being called \"Separates\".\n\nA growing body of Separate Baptists began in New England. They were zealous in\nevangelism and held to heart-felt religion. The most prominent New England\npastor and congregation was Isaac Backus (1724â808) and the church at\nMiddleborough, Massachusetts. Backus was raised a Congregationalist and became a\nNew Light (or Separatist) Congregational pastor in 1748. After conversion to\nBaptist views on the doctrine of baptism, Backus and others formed a Baptist\ncongregation in 1756. Backus was very active in the fight for religious liberty\nin America. The Separate Baptists of New England were never truly a separate\ngroup from the Regular Baptists. It would remain for the Separate Baptists in\nthe South to develop along distinct lines.\n\nIn 1745 Shubal Stearns (1706â71), a member of the Congregational church in\nTolland, Connecticut, heard evangelist George Whitefield. Stearns was converted\nand adopted the Awakening's view of revival and conversion. Stearns' church\nbecame involved in a controversy over the proper subjects of baptism in 1751.\nSoon Stearns rejected infant baptism and sought baptism at the hands of Wait\nPalmer, Baptist minister of Stonington, Connecticut. By March, Shubal Stearns\nwas ordained into the ministry by Palmer and Joshua Morse, the pastor of New\nLondon, Connecticut. The next twenty years of Stearns' remarkable ministry is\ninextricably intertwined with the rise and expansion of the Separate Baptists.\n\nIn 1754, Stearns moved south to Opequon, Virginia. Here he joined Daniel\nMarshall and wife Martha (Stearns' sister), who were already active in a Baptist\nchurch there. On November 22, 1755, Stearns and his party moved further south to\nSandy Creek, in Guilford County, North Carolina. This party consisted of eight\nmen and their wives, mostly relatives of Stearns. Stearns pastored at Sandy\nCreek until his death. From there, Separate Baptists spread in the South. The\nchurch quickly grew from 16 members to 606. Church members moved to other areas\nand started other churches. The 'Sandy Creek Association' was formed in 1758.\nMorgan Edwards, Baptist minister and historian contemporary with Stearns,\nrecorded that, \"in 17 years, [Sandy Creek] has spread its branches westward as\nfar as the great river Mississippi; southward as far as Georgia; eastward to the\nsea and Chesopeck [sic] Bay; and northward to the waters of the Pottowmack\n[sic]; it, in 17 years, is become mother, grandmother, and great grandmother to\n42 churches, from which sprang 125 ministers.\"\n\nFor a time these Baptists remained somewhat distinct from the Regular Baptists.\nThey were in the main in agreement with the Regulars, but holding to some minor\npoints of difference. According to Edwards, \"These are called Separates, not\nbecause they withdrew from the Regular-baptists but because they have hitherto\ndeclined any union with them. The faith and order of both are the same, except\nsome trivial matters not sufficient to support a distinction, but less a\ndisunion; for both avow the Century-Confession and the annexed discipline.\"\n\nOne distinction was in the number of ordinances or rites observed by the\nSeparates. The nine rites were baptism, the Lord's supper, love feasts, laying\non of hands, washing feet, anointing the sick, the right hand of fellowship,\nkiss of charity, and devoting children. Not all the churches practiced all nine\nof these, but most churches practiced more than the two ordinances generally\nheld by the Regular Baptists â baptism and the Lord's supper.\n\nWith the exception of the Separate Baptist in Christ, the denominational name\nSeparate Baptist disappeared in many area of the country with the formal and\ninformal agreements of union between the Regular Baptists and Separate Baptists,\nbeginning in Virginia in 1787, in the Carolinas in 1789, and in Kentucky in 1797\n& 1801. As recorded by Benedict, the conclusion of the terms of union in\nVirginia stated, \"â¦we are united, and desire hereafter, that the names Regular\nand Separate be buried in oblivion; and that from henceforth, we shall be known\nby the name of the United Baptist Churches, in Virginia.\"\n\nDescendants of the Separate Baptists include the Separate Baptists in Christ,\nLandmark Missionary Baptists, Primitive Baptists, Southern Baptists, United\nBaptists, and The Baptists.\n\nSeparate Baptists are particularly visible in Kentucky, where a member of the\ndenomination, Vernie McGaha of Russell Springs, serves in the state senate.\n","linknr":241,"url":"Separate_Baptist","recorded":1375059309,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Separate_Baptists&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Separate_Baptists&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","/wiki/Separate_Baptists","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","/w/index.php?title=Separate_Baptist&redirect=no","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:External_links","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources#Inline_citations","/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Fact_and_Reference_Check","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Separate_Baptists&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Template:Citation_needed","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/Category:Baptist","/wiki/Baptists","/wiki/File:Baptism_logo.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/3a/Baptism_logo.jpg/100px-Baptism_logo.jpg","/wiki/Christianity","/wiki/Protestantism","/wiki/Puritan","/wiki/Anabaptist","/wiki/Baptist_beliefs","/wiki/Priesthood_of_all_believers","/wiki/Soul_competency","/wiki/Baptists_in_the_history_of_separation_of_church_and_state","/wiki/Sola_scriptura","/wiki/Congregationalist_polity","/wiki/Baptist_ordinance","/wiki/Baptist_offices","/wiki/List_of_Baptist_confessions","/wiki/List_of_Baptists","/wiki/John_Smyth_(Baptist_minister)","/wiki/Thomas_Helwys","/wiki/Roger_Williams_(theologian)","/wiki/John_Clarke_(Baptist_minister)","/wiki/John_Bunyan","/wiki/Shubal_Stearns","/wiki/Andrew_Fuller","/wiki/Charles_Spurgeon","/wiki/D._N._Jackson","/wiki/James_Robinson_Graves","/wiki/William_Bullein_Johnson","/wiki/William_Carey_(missionary)","/wiki/Luther_Rice","/wiki/Martin_Luther_King,_Jr.","/wiki/Billy_Graham","/wiki/List_of_Baptist_denominations","/wiki/List_of_Baptist_colleges_and_universities","/wiki/Portal:Baptist","/wiki/Template:Baptist","/wiki/Template_talk:Baptist","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Baptist&action=edit","/wiki/Baptists","/wiki/First_Great_Awakening","/wiki/Christian","/wiki/Gilbert_Tennent","/wiki/Jonathan_Edwards_(theologian)","/wiki/George_Whitefield","/wiki/Boston,_Massachusetts","/wiki/First_Great_Awakening","/wiki/II_Corinthians","/wiki/Isaac_Backus","/wiki/Middleborough,_Massachusetts","/wiki/New_England","/wiki/Regular_Baptist","/wiki/Shubal_Stearns","/wiki/Congregational_church","/wiki/Tolland,_Connecticut","/wiki/Baptism","/wiki/Infant_baptism","/wiki/Stonington,_Connecticut","/wiki/New_London,_Connecticut","/wiki/Opequon,_Virginia","/wiki/Guilford_County,_North_Carolina","/wiki/Morgan_Edwards","/wiki/Regular_Baptist","/wiki/Baptism","/wiki/The_Lord%27s_Supper","/wiki/Laying_on_of_hands","/wiki/Feet_washing","/wiki/Right_hand_of_fellowship","/wiki/Kiss_of_peace","/wiki/Virginia","/wiki/Kentucky","/wiki/Separate_Baptists_in_Christ","/wiki/Landmark_Baptist_Church","/wiki/Primitive_Baptist","/wiki/Southern_Baptist_Convention","/wiki/United_Baptist","/wiki/General_Association_of_Baptists","/wiki/Kentucky","/wiki/Vernie_McGaha","/wiki/Russell_Springs,_Kentucky","/wiki/Kentucky_State_Senate","/w/index.php?title=Separate_Baptists&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Template:US_baptist_denominations","/wiki/Template_talk:US_baptist_denominations","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:US_baptist_denominations&action=edit","/wiki/Baptists","/wiki/Christian_denomination","/wiki/Alliance_of_Baptists","/wiki/American_Baptist_Association","/wiki/American_Baptist_Churches_USA","/wiki/Association_of_Reformed_Baptist_Churches_of_America","/wiki/Baptist_Bible_Fellowship_International","/wiki/Baptist_General_Association_of_Virginia","/wiki/Baptist_General_Conference","/wiki/Baptist_General_Convention_of_Texas","/wiki/Baptist_Missionary_Association_of_America","/wiki/Black_Primitive_Baptists","/wiki/Central_Baptist_Association","/wiki/Ohio_Valley_Association_of_the_Christian_Baptist_Churches_of_God","/wiki/Church_of_Christ,_Instrumental","/wiki/Conservative_Baptist_Association_of_America","/wiki/Conservative_Baptist_Association_of_the_Southeast","/wiki/Continental_Baptist_Churches","/w
