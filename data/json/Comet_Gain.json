Following an EP on Soul\nStatic Sound in 1994, Comet Gain signed with Wiiija and released debut album\nCasino Classics and a further EP in 1995. The album featured sleevenotes by\nTelevision Personalities frontman Dan Treacy. During this period Comet Gain were\nboth loosely associated with the UK riot grrrl scene and regularly compared to\nDexys Midnight Runners; however from the first release their music varied\ndramatically in style from indie-pop influenced by sixties girl-group sounds,\nthrough early-80s alternative pop, to pure punk.\n\n1996's 'Say Yes To International Socialism' EP\nhttp://www.45cat.com/record/wij50v reflected the influence of late-\nperiod Jam/The Style Council and was promoted by Comet Gain's debut video, for\nthe more radio-friendly b-side [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV9hTShC8x8\nHideaway]. A second video was produced the following year to promote the\n[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU7m6J9Nve0 Strength] single and accompanying\nmini-album Magnetic Poetry, which was also released (as Sneaky http://www.allmusic.com/album/sneaky-\nr312756 ) on Beggars Banquet USA in an attempt to promote the band\nstateside. However, due to ongoing artistic differences, in early 1997 the\nmajority of Comet Gain split and formed the band\nVelocette, http://www.popstops.net/velocette.htm remaining on Wiiija,\nleaving David Christian to continue Comet Gain with new members.\n\nJoined by new vocalist Rachel Evans, alongside bassist Kay Ishikawa and Darren\nSmyth on drums, Comet Gain released the comeback album Tigertown Pictures in\n1999, following a move to KRS records. Additional members on the record included\nJohn McKeown (The Yummy\nFur) http://www.killrockstars.com/bands/cometgain/news/index.html and\nsongs included the signature 'Saturday Night Facts Of Life', later covered by\nThe Cribs. http://www.discogs.com/Cribs-Martell/release/595388\n\n2002's Realistes http://www.popmatters.com/pm/review/cometgain-\nrealistes/ http://www.allmusic.com/album/realistes-\nr573437/review saw Comet Gain augmented by guitarist Jon Slade (ex-Huggy\nBear) and drummer Woodie Taylor (ex-Morrissey/The Meteors) and continued the garage-\npunk influenced direction of the previous album. Guests included Chris Appelgren\n(The PeeChees) http://www.killrockstars.com/bands/cometgain/index.html\nand Kathleen Hanna (Bikini Kill).\n\n2005âs City Fallen Leaves [http://www.answers.com/topic/city-fallen-leaves-\n1] http://www.splendidezine.com/review.html?reviewid=1134384812119899-\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/city-fallen-leaves-r804732/review\nwas released on Track and Field records, and showcased a more expansive\nproduction, to further critical acclaim. Songs included\n[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gz9SszsnNwQ Fists In The Pocket] which had a\nrare accompanying video. Follow-up release Broken Record Prayers compiled\nsingles, Peel Sessions and unreleased tracks from 1998 to 2008. http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12848-broken-record-\nprayers/ http://www.thelineofbestfit.com/2008/11/comet-gain-broken-\nrecord-prayers/\n\n2010 and 2011 saw the release of a series of limited-edition singles to support\nnew album Howl of the Lonely Crowd (Fortuna Pop! records). Produced by Ryan\nJarman and Edwyn Collins, the album cemented Comet Gainâs reputation as\nrespected and influential indie-pop veterans. http://www.allmusic.com/album/howl-of-the-lonely-crowd-\nmw0002140898 http://soundblab.com/content/content/view/id/3750 http://www.subba-cultcha.com/album-\nreviews/article.php?contentID=24902 http://www.dustedmagazine.com/rev-\niews/6509 http://godisinthetvzine.co.uk/index.php/2011/05/13/comet-\ngain-reveal-new-lp-how-of-the-lonely-\ncrowd/ http://jordanminnesota.blogspot.com/2011/06/record-review-\ncomet-gain-howl-of-\nlonely.html http://www.thisisfakediy.co.uk/articles/albums/comet-gain-\nhowl-of-the-lonely-crowd http://www.culturedeluxe.com/2011/06/comet-\ngain-howl-of-the-lonely-crowd/ During this period, Comet Gain settled as a\n7-piece band with the addition of Ben Phillipson (ex-Kicker, Eighteenth Day of\nMay) on guitar and backing vocals and Anne Laure Guillain on keyboards and\nbacking vocals.\n\nMembers of Comet Gain collaborate with tourmates Crystal Stilts and others as\nCinema Red and Blue, http://www.clashmusic.com/feature/cinema-red-\nblue http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14772-cinema-red-and-\nblue/ a long-term side project which released a single and an eponymous\nalbum in 2010.
