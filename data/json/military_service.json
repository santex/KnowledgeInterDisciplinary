Some nations (e.g., Mexico) require a specific\namount of military service from every citizen (except for special cases, such as\nphysical or mental disorders or religious beliefs). A nation with a fully\nvolunteer military does not normally require mandatory military service from its\ncitizens, unless it is faced with a recruitment crisis during a time of war.\n",
