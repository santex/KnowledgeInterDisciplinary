Although the chronological limits of the period are open to debate, the\ntimeframe spans the period after the late portion of the Middle Ages (c. 1500)\nthrough the beginning of the Age of Revolutions (c. 1800) and is traditionally\ndemarcated by historians as beginning with the conquest of Constantinople by\nthe Ottoman Empire in 1453 AD and ending with the French Revolution in 1789.\nFrom a global standpoint, the most important feature of the early modern period\nwas its globalizing character â it witnessed the exploration and colonization\nof the Americas and the rise of sustained contacts between previously isolated\nparts of the globe. The historical powers became involved in global trade. This\nworld trading of goods, plants, animals, and food crops saw exchange in the Old\nWorld and the New World. The Columbian exchange greatly affected almost every\nsociety on Earth.\n\nIn the world, capitalist economies and institutions became more sophisticated\nand globally articulated. This process began in the medieval North Italian city-\nstates, particularly Genoa, Venice, and Milan. The early modern period also saw\nthe rise and beginning of the dominance of the economic theory of mercantilism.\nIt also saw the European colonization during the 15th to 19th centuries, which\nspread Christianity around the world.\n\nThe early modern trends in various regions of the world represented a shift away\nfrom medieval modes of organization, sometimes politically and other-times\neconomically. The period in Europe witnessed the decline of feudalism and\nincludes the Reformation, the disastrous Thirty Years' War, the Commercial\nRevolution, the European colonization of the Americas, and the Golden Age of\nPiracy. Ruling China at the beginning of the early modern period, the Ming\nDynasty was âone of the greatest eras of orderly government and social stability\nin human history.â Edwin Oldfather Reischauer, John King Fairbank, Albert M.\nCraig (1960) A history of East Asian civilization, Volume 1. East Asia: The\nGreat Tradition, George Allen & Unwin Ltd. By the 16th century the Ming\neconomy was stimulated by trade with the Portuguese, the Spanish, and the Dutch.\nThe Azuti-Momoyama period in Japan saw the Nanban trade after the arrival of the\nfirst European Portuguese.\n\nOther notable trends of the early modern period include the development of\nexperimental science, the shrinkage of relative distances through improvements\nin transportation and communications, increasingly rapid technological progress,\nsecularized civic politics and the early authoritarian nation states in various\nregions of the world.\n","linknr":1118,"url":"Early_modern_era","recorded":1362485261,"links":67,"instances":["gobroon","name","sorcery","graphical","province","1456","city","title","paranormal","1526","province","republic_of_china","island","title","household","region"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Early
