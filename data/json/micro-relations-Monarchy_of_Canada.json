The monarchy has been headed since 6 February 1952 by Queen\nElizabeth II, who as sovereign is shared equally with fifteen other countries\nwithin the Commonwealth of Nations, all being independent and the monarchy of\neach legally distinct. For Canada, the current monarch is officially titled\n[[Title and style of the Canadian monarch|Queen of Canada]] (), and she, her\nconsort, and other members of the Canadian Royal Family undertake various public\nand private functions across the country and on its behalf abroad. However, the\nQueen is the only member of the Royal Family with any constitutional role. While\nseveral powers are the sovereign's alone, because she lives predominantly in the\nUnited Kingdom, most of the royal governmental and ceremonial duties in Canada\nare carried out by the Queen's representative, the governor general. In each of\nCanada's provinces, the monarch is represented by a lieutenant governor, while\nthe territories are not sovereign and thus do not have a viceroy.\n\nPer the Canadian constitution, the responsibilities of the sovereign and/or\ngovernor general include summoning and dismissing parliament, calling elections,\nand appointing governments. Further, Royal Assent and the royal sign-manual are\nrequired to enact laws, letters patent, and orders in council. But the authority\nfor these acts stems from the Canadian populace and, within the\nconventional stipulations of constitutional monarchy, the sovereign's direct\nparticipation in any of these areas of governance is limited, with most related\npowers entrusted for exercise by the elected and appointed parliamentarians, the\nministers of the Crown generally drawn from amongst them, and the judges and\njustices of the peace. The Crown today primarily functions\nas a guarantor of continuous and stable governance and a nonpartisan safeguard\nagainst the abuse of power, the\nsovereign acting as a custodian of the Crown's democratic powers and a\nrepresentation of the \"power of the people above government and political\nparties.\"\n\nThe historical roots of the Canadian monarchy date back to approximately the\nturn of the 16th century, while others put it at 1534, when New\nFrance was founded in the name of King Francis I. |group=n|name=Found}} when European kingdoms made the first claims to\nwhat is now Canadian territory. Monarchical governance thenceforth evolved under\na continuous succession of French and British sovereigns, and eventually the\nlegally distinct Canadian monarchy, which is\nsometimes colloquially referred to as the [[Maple leaf|Maple]]\nCrown.
