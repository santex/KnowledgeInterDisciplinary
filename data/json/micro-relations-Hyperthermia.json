Extreme temperature\nelevation then becomes a medical emergency requiring immediate treatment to\nprevent disability or death.\n\nThe commonest causes include heat stroke and adverse reactions to drugs. The\nformer is an acute temperature elevation caused by exposure to excessive heat,\nor combination of heat and humidity, that overwhelms the heat-regulating\nmechanisms. The latter is a relatively rare side effect of many drugs,\nparticularly those that affect the central nervous system. Malignant\nhyperthermia is a rare complication of some types of general anesthesia.\n\nHyperthermia can also be deliberately induced using drugs or medical devices and\nmay be used in the treatment of some kinds of cancer and other conditions, most\ncommonly in conjunction with radiotherapy. [http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Therapy/hyperthermia\nInformation] from the U.S. National Cancer Institute\n\nHyperthermia differs from fever in that the body's temperature set point remains\nunchanged. The opposite is hypothermia, which occurs when the temperature drops\nbelow that required to maintain normal metabolism.\n","linknr":478,"url":"Hyperthermia","recorded":1362901024,"links":50,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://chppm-www.apgea.army.mil/heat/MicroclimateCoolingOptions_May_2007.pdf","http://chppm-www.apgea.army.mil/heat/MicroclimateCoolingOptions_May_2007.pdf","http://www.epa.gov/hiri/about/pdf/EHEguide_final.pdf"],"categories":["Medical emergencies","Physiology","Causes of death","Heat waves"],"headings":["Temperature Set Point","Classification","Signs and symptoms","Causes","Pathophysiology","Diagnosis","Prevention","Treatment","Epidemiology","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/93/Clinical_thermometer_38.7.JPG/220px-Clinical_thermometer_38.7.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5d/Heat-related_deaths.jpg/220px-Heat-related_deaths.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/Fever-conceptual.svg/220px-Fever-conceptual.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Medical_thermometer","Thermoregulation","Heat","Medical_emergency","Heat_stroke","Body_temperature","Central_nervous_system","Malignant_hyperthermia","General_anesthesia","Hyperthermia_therapy","Cancer","Radiotherapy","National_Cancer_Institute","Fever","Hypothermia","Preoptic_area","Normal_human_body_temperature","Blood_vessel","Perspiration","Nausea","Headaches","Low_blood_pressure","Fainting","Dizziness","Tachycardia","Tachypnea","Circulatory_system","Seizures","Unconsciousness","Death","Heat_stroke","Harrison's_Principles_of_Internal_Medicine","Vasodilation","Convection","Evaporation","Newton's_law_of_cooling","Stefan-Boltzmann_law","Anticholinergic","Selective_serotonin_reuptake_inhibitors","Monoamine_oxidase_inhibitors","Tricyclic_antidepressants","Serotonin_syndrome","Neuroleptic_malignant_syndrome","Neuroleptic","Amphetamines","Cocaine","Phencyclidine","LSD","MDMA","Adverse_effect","Malignant_hyperthermia","Halothane","Succinylcholine","Certified_first_responder","Improvised_explosive_device","Bomb_suit","Thyrotoxicosis","Adrenal_gland","Pheochromocytoma","Status_epilepticus","Fever","Body_temperature","Anterior_hypothalamus","Bacteria","Virus","Pyrogens","Thermostat","Endotoxemia","Antipyretic","Evaporative_cooling","Sweat","Saliva","Humidity","Wet_Bulb_Globe_Temperature","Solar_radiation","Global_warming","Antipyretic","Paracetamol","Aspirin","Air_conditioning","Vasoconstriction","Medical_emergency","Intravenous","Gastric_lavage","Hemodialysis","Heat_wave","Heat_cramps","Ice_sock","Rhabdomyolysis","Institute_of_Medicine"]}
