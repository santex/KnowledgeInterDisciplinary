Written by Ina\nWroldsen and co-written & produced by Arnthor Birgisson, the song confirmed to\nbe the mini-album's second single when it was released on 1 November 2010 by\nFascination Records. In preparation for its release, the single was remixed to\nfeature new vocals from American rapper Flo Rida after the rapper's single \"Club\nCan't Handle Me\" beat the group's previous single \"Missing You\" to number one;\nit was the second time they had lost the position to Flo Rida. Rochelle Wiseman\njokingly said that the group would never get a number one until they\ncollaborated with him.\n\nFlo Rida personally offered the collaboration for both his and the group's fans.\nCritics generally praised the song as the strongest offering from Headlines!,\nfor being infectious, catchy and feisty, although it received negative reception\nfor overproduction. An accompanying music video for the song was shot in Los\nAngeles at Fox Studios, at the end of August 2010, and features the girls\ndancing through a New York traffic jam. The single remix of the song premiered\non 16 September 2010 through Capital FM, while a new version of the video\nfeaturing Flo Rida premiered on 9 October 2010. \"Higher\" was successful, peaking\nin the top-ten in the Scottish and UK singles charts as well as top-fifteen in\nIreland. It also won the 2011 Popjustice Â£20 Music Prize.\n","linknr":525,"url":"Higher_(The_Saturdays_song)","recorded":1362478823,"links":22,"instances":["recorded_music","the_saturdays_song","the_saturdays_song","singer","radio_network"],"pdf":["http://www.ukchartsplus.co.uk/UKChartsPlusYE2010.pdf","http://www.ukchartsplus.co.uk/UKChartsPlusYE2010.pdf"],"categories":["The Saturdays songs","2010 singles","Electropop songs","Synthpop songs","Songs written by Arnthor Birgisson","Flo Rida songs","Polydor Records singles","Songs written by Ina Wroldsen"],"headings":["Background","Composition","Critical reception","Awards","Chart performance","Music video","Live performances","Track listing","Personnel","Charts","Release history","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/3a/The_Saturdays_-_Higher.jpg/220px-The_Saturdays_-_Higher.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/13/The_Saturdays_Higher_Video_Snap.jpg/250px-The_Saturdays_Higher_Video_Snap.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Symbol_book_class2.svg/16px-Symbol_book_class2.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["missing_you","the_saturdays_song"],["notorious","the_saturdays_song"],["turn_around","5,_4,_3,_2,_1"],["missing_you","the_saturdays_song"],["capital","radio_network"],["missing_you","the_saturdays_song"],["adele","singer"],["audio_mixing","recorded_music"]],"members":["audio_mixing","notorious","turn_around","missing_you","adele","capital"],"related":["The_Saturdays","Flo&nbsp;Rida","Headlines!","Music_download","CD_single","Synthpop","Electropop","Fascination_Records","Arnthor_Birgisson","Ina_Wroldsen","Missing_You_(The_Saturdays_song)","Notorious_(The_Saturdays_song)","Boom_Shacka","Turn_Around_(5,_4,_3,_2,_1)","The_Saturdays","Ina_Wroldsen","Arnthor_Birgisson","Fascination_Records","Flo_Rida","Club_Can't_Handle_Me","Missing_You_(The_Saturdays_song)","Rochelle_Wiseman","Los_Angeles","20th_Century_Fox","New_York","Capital_(radio_network)","Popjustice_£20_Music_Prize","Missing_You_(The_Saturdays_song)","Flo_Rida","UK_Singles_Chart","Rochelle_Wiseman","Guitar","Electropop","Synthpop","Auto-tune","Flo_Rida","95.8_Capital_FM","Digital_Spy","BBC_Online","UK_Singles_Chart","Yahoo!","Popjustice_£20_Music_Prize","Twitter","Adele_(singer)","Jessie_J","Take_That","UK_Singles_Chart","Flo_Rida","Los_Angeles","New_York","20th_Century_Fox","Britney_Spears","ITV2","Vevo","New_York","Rochelle_Wiseman","Mollie_King","Una_Healy","Flo_Rida","Joe_McElderry","Mollie_King","Horsefly","Flo_Rida","Una_Healy","The_Saturdays","CD_single","Fascination_Records","Polydor_Records","Flo_Rida","London","Songwriter","Arnthor_Birgisson","Record_producer","Audio_mixing_(recorded_music)","Guitar","Lead_vocals","The_Saturdays","Background_vocals","Flo_Rida","UK_Singles_Chart","Polydor_Records","Fascination_Records"]}
