{"cursor":"2293","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nIn psychology 'behavioral health', as a general concept, refers to the\nreciprocal relationship between human behavior, individually or socially, and\nthe well-being of the body, mind, and spirit, whether the latter are considered\nindividually or as an integrated whole. The term is more commonly used to\ndescribe a field of scientific study, academic proficiency and clinical\nhealthcare practice.\n\nLike similar terms such as mental health and physical health, behavioral health\nis a basic English term which derives its meaning from the simple association\nbetween noun and adjective. Normal variations in the definition of such terms\nmay be expected, given common variations seen in the component words,\n\"behavioral\" and \"health\". When the term is employed in the scientific or\nclinical sense, variations in the focus, if not the meaning of the term, have\nbeen observed.\n\nIn 1978 the term behavioral medicine was formally introduced and described as\n the interdisciplinary field concerned with the development and\nintegration of behavioral and biomedical science, knowledge and techniques\nrelevant to health and illness and the application of this knowledge and these\ntechniques to prevention, diagnosis, treatment and rehabilitation. Schwartz,\nG.E. & Weiss, S.M. (1978). Behavioral medicine revisited: An amended definition.\nJournal of Behavioral Medicine, 1, 249-251. \n\nIn 1979 behavioral health emerged as that aspect of behavioral medicine\n promoting a philosophy of health that stresses individual\nresponsibility in the application of behavioral and biomedical science,\nknowledge and techniques to the maintenance of health and the prevention of\nillness and dysfunction by a variety of self-initiated individual or shared\nactivities. Matarazzo, J.D. (1980). Behavioral health and behavioral\nmedicine: Frontiers for a new health psychology. American Psychologist, 35, 807-\n817. \n\nUnlike its progenitor, behavioral medicine, the emphasis of behavioral health\nhad been placed squarely in the arena of health maintenance and the prevention\nof illness.\n","linknr":86,"url":"Behavioral_health","recorded":1362505335,"links":23,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Mental health"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Psychology","Reciprocal","Human_behavior","Mental_health","Physical_health","Behavioral_medicine"]}
