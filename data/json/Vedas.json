Composed in Vedic Sanskrit, the texts constitute\nthe oldest layer of Sanskrit literature and the oldest scriptures of\nHinduism. see e.g. ; Witzel, Michael, \"Vedas and \", in: ; ; Sanskrit\nliterature (2003) in Philip's Encyclopedia. Accessed 2007-08-\n09 Sanujit Ghose (2011). \"[http://www.ancient.eu.com/article/230/\nReligious Developments in Ancient India]\" in Ancient History Encyclopedia.\nThe Vedas are [[apaurusheyatva|{{IAST|apauruá¹£eya}}]] (\"not of human\nagency\"). Apte, pp. 109f. has \"not of the authorship\nof man, of divine origin\" They are supposed to have been directly\nrevealed, and thus are called {{IAST|[[Åruti]]}} (\"what is\nheard\"), distinguishing them from other religious texts,\nwhich are called {{IAST|[[smá¹ti]]}} (\"what is remembered\"). The Vedic texts or\nare organized around four canonical collections of metrical material known as\n{{IAST|Saá¹hitÄ}}s, of which the first three are related to the performance of\nyajna (sacrifice) in historical Vedic religion:\n# The Rigveda, containing hymns to be recited by the hotar, or presiding priest;\n# The Yajurveda, containing formulas to be recited by the adhvaryu or\n# officiating priest; The Samaveda, containing formulas to be sung by the\n# udgatar or priest that chants; The fourth is the Atharvaveda, a collection of\n# spells and incantations, apotropaic charms and speculative\n# hymns. Bloomfield, M. The Atharvaveda and the Gopatha-Brahmana, (Grundriss\n# der Indo-Arischen Philologie und Altertumskunde II.1.b.) Strassburg 1899;\n# Gonda, J. A history of Indian literature: I.1 Vedic literature (Samhitas and\n# Brahmanas); I.2 The Ritual Sutras. Wiesbaden 1975, 1977\n\nThe individual verses contained in these compilations are known as\n{{IAST|[[mantra]]s}}. Some selected Vedic mantras are still recited at prayers,\nreligious functions and other auspicious occasions in contemporary Hinduism.\n\nThe various Indian philosophies and sects have taken differing positions on the\nVedas. Schools of Indian philosophy which cite the Vedas as their scriptural\nauthority are classified as \"orthodox\" (Ästika). Other traditions, notably\nBuddhism and Jainism, which did not regard the Vedas as authorities are referred\nto by traditional Hindu texts as \"heterodox\" or \"non-orthodox\" (nÄstika)\nschools. \"The brahmin by caste alone, the teacher of the Veda, is\n(jokingly) etymologized as the 'non-meditator' (ajjhÄyaka). Brahmins who have\nmemorized the three Vedas (tevijja) really know nothing: it is the process of\nachieving Enlightenment â what the Buddha is said to have achieved in the\nthree watches of that night â which constitutes the true 'three\nknowledges.'\" R.F. Gombrich in Paul Williams, ed., \"Buddhism: Critical Concepts\nin Religious Studies.\" Taylor and Francis 2006, page 120. In addition to\nBuddhism and Jainism, Sikhism and\nBrahmoism, \"Eclecticism and Modern Hindu Discourse, Brian Hatcher, OUP\n1999\" many non-Brahmin Hindus in South India The Dravidian Movement by\nGail Omvedt do not accept the authority of the Vedas. Certain South Indian\nBrahmin communities such as Iyengars consider the Tamil Divya Prabandham or\nwriting of the Alvar saints as equivalent to the Vedas.
