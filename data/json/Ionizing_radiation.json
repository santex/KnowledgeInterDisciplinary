Ionizing radiation is generated through nuclear\nreactions, either artificial or natural, by very high temperature (e.g. plasma\ndischarge or the corona of the Sun), via production of high energy particles in\nparticle accelerators, or due to acceleration of charged particles by the\nelectromagnetic fields produced by natural processes, from lightning to\nsupernova explosions.\n\nWhen ionizing radiation is emitted by or absorbed by an atom, it can liberate a\nsubatomic particle (typically an electron, proton, or neutron, but sometimes an\nentire nucleus) from the atom. Such an event can alter chemical bonds and\nproduce ions, usually in ion-pairs, that are especially chemically reactive.\nThis greatly magnifies the chemical and biological damage per unit energy of\nradiation because chemical bonds will be broken in this process. If the atom was\ninside a crystal lattice in a solid phase, then a \"hole\" will exist where the\noriginal atom was.\n\nIonizing radiation includes cosmic rays, Alpha particles, Beta particles, Gamma\nrays, X-rays, and in general any charged particle moving at relativistic speeds.\nNeutrons are considered ionizing radiation at any speed. Ionizing radiation\nincludes some portion of the ultraviolet spectrum, depending on context. Radio\nwaves, microwaves, infrared light, and visible light are normally considered non-\nionizing radiation, although very high intensity beams of these radiations can\nproduce sufficient heat to exhibit some similar properties to ionizing\nradiation, by altering chemical bonds and removing electrons from atoms.\n\nIonizing radiation is ubiquitous in the environment, and comes from naturally\noccurring radioactive materials and cosmic rays. Common artificial sources are\nartificially produced radioisotopes, X-ray tubes and particle accelerators.\nIonizing radiation is invisible and not directly detectable by human senses, so\ninstruments such as Geiger counters are usually required to detect its presence.\nIn some cases it may lead to secondary emission of visible light upon\ninteraction with matter, such as in Cherenkov radiation and radioluminescence.\nIt has many practical uses in medicine, research, construction, and other areas,\nbut presents a health hazard if used improperly. Exposure to ionizing radiation\ncauses damage to living tissue, and can result in mutation, radiation sickness,\ncancer, and death.\n","linknr":1000,"url":"Ionizing_radiation","recorded":1362675092,"links":76,"instances":["particle_radiation","particle_radiation","anatomy","unit","physics","physics","biochemistry","radiation","unit","unit","unit"],"pdf":["http://www.unscear.org/docs/reports/2008/09-86753_Report_2008_Annex_B.pdf","http://transition.fcc.gov/Bureaus/Engineering_Technology/Documents/bulletins/oet56/oet56e4.pdf","http://www-pub.iaea.org/mtcd/publications/pdf/pub1196_web.pdf","http://www-pub.iaea.org/mtcd/publications/pdf/pub1196_web.pdf","http://www.tesec-int.org/TechHaz-site%2008/Radiation-interaction.pdf","http://www.tesec-int.org/TechHaz-site%2008/Radiation-interaction.pdf","http://www.groenerekenkamer.com/grkfiles/images/parsons.pdf","http://www.groenerekenkamer.com/grkfiles/images/parsons.pdf","http://www.brucepower.com/wp-content/.../RSIC-Final-Report.pdf","http://www.brucepower.com/wp-content/.../RSIC-Final-Report.pdf"],"categories":["Radioactivity","Radiobiology","Radiation
