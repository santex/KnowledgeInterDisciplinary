SUS,\npushed to fruition by the administration of Governor John J. McKeithen, opened\nfor instruction on September 19, 1967. At the same time a second two-year\ninstitution, Louisiana State University at Shreveport, also opened. However,\nLSUS later became a four-year campus, but SUS remains a two-year facility. The\nuniversity is a member-school of Thurgood Marshall College Fund.\n\nThe primary emphasis of SUS was to serve the Shreveport-Bossier City area. SUS\nis accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools to award\nassociate degrees.\n\nOn October 28, 1974, the Louisiana Board of Regents, then called the\nCoordinating Council for Higher Education, granted to the institution approval\nfor six associate's degree programs in business, humanities, medical office\nassistant, natural sciences, office administration and social sciences. In 1978,\nit added an associate's degree in medical laboratory technology.\n\nAmong the buildings at SUS is Stone Hall, named for the late Southern University\nSystem president Jesse N. Stone, Jr.. Inside Stone Hall is the J. Bennett\nJohnston, Jr. Video Conferencing Center, named for the former U.S. senator from\nShreveport.\n","linknr":322,"url":"Southern_University_at_Shreveport","recorded":1362582673,"links":22,"instances":["color","color"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Educational institutions established in 1967","Universities and colleges accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools","Universities and colleges in Louisiana","Education in Shreveport, Louisiana","Buildings and structures in Shreveport, Louisiana"],"headings":["References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/36/Southern_University_at_Shreveport_seal.png/150px-Southern_University_at_Shreveport_seal.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/19/Southern_University_at_Shreveport_sign_IMG_3433.JPG/200px-Southern_University_at_Shreveport_sign_IMG_3433.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/71/Library_at_Southern_University_at_Shreveport%2C_LA_IMG_3428.JPG/200px-Library_at_Southern_University_at_Shreveport%2C_LA_IMG_3428.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f0/Louis_M._Collier_Hall_at_SUS_in_Shreveport%2C_LA_IMG_3420.JPG/200px-Louis_M._Collier_Hall_at_SUS_in_Shreveport%2C_LA_IMG_3420.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a1/Map_of_USA_highlighting_South.png/30px-Map_of_USA_highlighting_South.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["blue","color"],["gold","color"]],"members":["gold","blue"],"related":["Public_university","HBCU","Ray_Belton","Shreveport,_Louisiana","Louisiana","United_States","Blue_(color)","Gold_(color)","Southern_University_Jaguars","Historically_black","Southern_University_System","Shreveport,_Louisiana","U.S._state","Louisiana","Governor_of_Louisiana","John_J._McKeithen","Louisiana_State_University_at_Shreveport","Thurgood_Marshall_College_Fund","Shreveport-Bossier_City_metropolitan_area","Southern_Association_of_Colleges_and_Schools","Associate_degree","Jesse_N._Stone","Bennett_Johnston","U.S._senator"]}
