In particular, abstractions and legal fictions are usually\nregarded as entities. In general, there is also no presumption that an entity\nis animate.\n\nIn business, an entity is a person, department, team, corporation, cooperative,\npartnership, or other group with whom it is possible to conduct business.\n\nSometimes, the word entity is used in a general sense of a being, whether or not\nthe referent has material existence, e.g., is often referred to as an entity\nwith no corporeal form (non-physical entity), such as a language. It is also\noften used to refer to ghosts and other spirits.\n\nThe word entitative is the adjective form of the noun entity.
