There\nis some question whether the condition is natural during pregnancy. Gestational\ndiabetes is caused when the insulin receptors do not function properly. This is\nlikely due to pregnancy related factors such as the presence of human placental\nlactogen that interferes with susceptible insulin receptors. This in turn causes\ninappropriately elevated blood sugar levels.\n\nGestational diabetes generally has few symptoms and it is most commonly\ndiagnosed by screening during pregnancy. Diagnostic tests detect inappropriately\nhigh levels of glucose in blood samples. Gestational diabetes affects 3-10% of\npregnancies, depending on the population studied, Thomas R\nMoore, MD et al. Diabetes Mellitus and Pregnancy. . Version: Jan 27, 2005\nupdate. so may be a natural phenomenon.\n\nAs with diabetes mellitus in pregnancy in general, babies born to mothers with\nuntreated gestational diabetes are typically at increased risk of problems such\nas being large for gestational age (which may lead to delivery complications),\nlow blood sugar, and jaundice. If untreated, it can also cause seizures or still\nbirth. Gestational diabetes is a treatable condition and women who have adequate\ncontrol of glucose levels can effectively decrease these risks. The food plan is\noften the first recommended target for strategic management of GDM.\n\nWomen with unmanaged gestational diabetes are at increased risk of developing\ntype 2 diabetes mellitus (or, very rarely, latent autoimmune diabetes or Type 1)\nafter pregnancy, as well as having a higher incidence of pre-eclampsia and\nCaesarean section; their offspring are prone to\ndeveloping childhood obesity, with type 2 diabetes later in life. Most patients\nare able to manage their blood glucose levels with a modified diet and the\nintroduction of moderate exercise, but some require antidiabetic drugs,\nincluding insulin.\n\nWomen with gestational diabetes who manage the condition with diet and exercise\nor with medication generally have smaller birthweight babies, leading to other\nproblems, such as survival rate of premature and early births, particularly\nmale babies.\n","linknr":932,"url":"Gestational_diabetes","recorded":1362482025,"links":45,"instances":["medical","physician","medicine","medicine"],"pdf":["http://www.who.int/diabetes/publications/Definition%20and%20diagnosis%20of%20diabetes_new.pdf","http://www.who.int/diabetes/publications/Definition%20and%20diagnosis%20of%20diabetes_new.pdf","http://www.nichd.nih.gov/publications/pubs/upload/gest_diabetes_risk_2005.pdf"],"categories":["Diabetes","Health issues in pregnancy"],"headings":["Classification","Risk factors","Pathophysiology","Screening","Management","Prognosis","Epidemiology","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/43/Blue_circle_for_diabetes.svg/230px-Blue_circle_for_diabetes.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8c/Insulin_glucose_metabolism.jpg/220px-Insulin_glucose_metabolism.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d8/Gestational_diabetes_kit.jpg/220px-Gestational_diabetes_kit.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["screening","medicine"],["priscilla_white","physician"],["family_history","medicine"],["fatigue","medical"]],"members":["fatigue","priscilla_white","screening","family_history"],"related":["Diabetes_mellitus","Hyperglycemia","Pregnancy","Symptoms","Screening_(medicine)","Glucose","Diabetes_mellitus_in_pregnancy","Macrosomia","Hypoglycemia","Jaundice","Glycemic_control","Type_2_diabetes_mellitus","Latent_autoimmune_diabetes","Diabetes_mellitus_type_1","Pre-eclampsia","Caesarean_section","Childhood_obesity","Type_2_diabetes","Antidiabetic_drugs","Insulin","Glucose_intolerance","Priscilla_White_(physician)","Diabetes_mellitus_and_pregnancy","Polycystic_Ovary_Syndrome","Impaired_glucose_tolerance","Impaired_fasting_glycaemia","Family_history_(medicine)","Diabetes_mellitus_type_2","African-Americans","Afro-Caribbeans","Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas","Hispanics","Pacific_Islanders","South_Asia","Overweight","Obesity","Smoking","Polycystic_ovarian_syndrome","Short_stature","Thirst","Urination","Fatigue_(medical)","Nausea","Vomiting","Cystitis","Yeast_infection","Blurred_vision","Glycogen","Glycolysis","Fatty_acid","Insulin_resistance","Insulin_receptor","Cell_signaling","Placenta","Hormones","Fat","Cortisol","Progesterone","Human_placental_lactogen","Prolactin","Estradiol","Autoimmunity","Mutations","Facilitated_diffusion","GLUT3","Insulin","Macrosomia","Hypoglycemia","Glucose","Blood_plasma","Blood_serum","Polycystic_ovarian_syndrome","Acanthosis_nigricans","Postprandial","Oral_glucose_tolerance_test","Evidence_based_medicine","United_States","United_Kingdom","American_Diabetes_Association","Society_of_Obstetricians_and_Gynaecologists_of_Canada","Body_mass_index","Canadian_Diabetes_Association","American_College_of_Obstetricians_and_Gynecologists","U.S._Preventive_Services_Task_Force","False_positive","Dwight_D._Eisenhower_Army_Medical_Center","MedlinePlus","Carbohydrate","American_Diabetes_Association","Retrospective_cohort_study","Glucosuria","Dipstick","Glomerular_filtration_rate","Positive_predictive_value","Macrosomia","Quality_of_life","Induction_of_labour","Cesarean_section","Perinatal_mortality","Diabetic_diet","G.I._Diet","Obstetric_ultrasonography","Folic_acid","Antidiabetic_drugs","Insulin","G.I._Diet","HbA1c","Breastfeeding","Hypoglycemia","Glyburide","Sulfonylurea","Metformin","Randomized_controlled_trial","Polycystic_ovarian_syndrome","Antibody","Glutamate_decarboxylase","Islet_cell_antibodies","Insulinoma_antigen-2","Boston,_Massachusetts","Navajo_people","Type_2_diabetes","Autoimmunity","Type_1_diabetes","Neonatal_intensive_care_unit","Large_for_gestational_age","Small_for_gestational_age","Intrauterine_growth_retardation","Forceps","Ventouse","Caesarean_section","Shoulder_dystocia","Hypoglycemia","Jaundice","Red_blood_cell","Polycythemia","Hypocalcemia","Hypomagnesemia","Infant_respiratory_distress_syndrome","Surfactant","Birth_defect","Preeclampsia"]}
