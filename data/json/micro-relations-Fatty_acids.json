Most naturally occurring fatty acids have a chain of an even number\nof carbon atoms, from 4 to 28. {{cite book|\nurl=http://goldbook.iupac.org/F02330.html |title= IUPAC Compendium of Chemical\nTerminology|edition= 2nd |year=1997|publisher = International Union of Pure and\nApplied Chemistry| accessdate=2007-10-31| isbn=0-521-51150-X}} Fatty acids\nare usually derived from triglycerides or phospholipids. When they are not\nattached to other molecules, they are known as \"free\" fatty acids. Fatty acids\nare important sources of fuel because, when metabolized, they yield large\nquantities of ATP. Many cell types can use either glucose or fatty acids for\nthis purpose. In particular, heart and skeletal muscle prefer fatty acids. The\nbrain cannot use fatty acids as a source of fuel; it relies on glucose or ketone\nbodies. {{cite book\n | author=Mary K. Campbell, Shawn O.
