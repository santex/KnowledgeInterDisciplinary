The word\nderives from the Greek term ÎºÏÏÎ¼Î¿Ï (kosmos), literally meaning \"order\" or\n\"ornament\" and metaphorically \"world\", [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hop-\nper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dko%2Fsmos ÎºÏÏÎ¼Î¿Ï], Henry\nGeorge Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus and\nis antithetical to the concept of chaos. Today, the word is generally used as\na synonym of the Latin loanword \"Universe\" (considered in its orderly\naspect). The word cosmetics originates from the same root. In many Slavic\nlanguages such as Russian, Bulgarian, and Serbian, the word ÐÐ¾ÑÐ¼Ð¾Ñ cosmos\nmeans also the \"outer space\". In Mandarin Chinese, cosmos and universe are\nboth translated as å®å® yÇzhÃ²u, which literally translated means space-time (å®\nyÇ = space + å® zhÃ²u = time).\n","linknr":273,"url":"Cosmos","recorded":1362485242,"links":42,"instances":["cosmogony","esotericism","de_chardin","number","unit_of_length"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Cosmology","Neoplatonism","Universe"],"headings":["Philosophy","Theology","Cosmology","Age and size of the cosmos","The Nature of the Cosmos","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3a/Ptolemaicsystem-small.png/300px-Ptolemaicsystem-small.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/Hubble_ultra_deep_field_high_rez_edit1.jpg/220px-Hubble_ultra_deep_field_high_rez_edit1.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/87/Flammarion.jpg/220px-Flammarion.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cc/WMAP_2003.png/220px-WMAP_2003.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["chaos","cosmogony"],["plane","esotericism"],["stadion","unit_of_length"],["1000000000","number"],["omega_point","de_chardin"]],"members":["chaos","plane","omega_point","1000000000","stadion"],"related":["Peter_Apian","System","Greek_language","Henry_George_Liddell","Robert_Scott","Antithesis","Chaos_(cosmogony)","Synonym","Universe","Cosmetics","Russian_language","Bulgarian_language","Serbian_language","Outer_space","Mandarin_Chinese","Space-time","Pythagoras","Firmament","Russian_cosmism","Philosophy","Culture","Russia","Cosmicism","H.P._Lovecraft","Ken_Wilber","Plane_(esotericism)","Higher_consciousness","Nondual","Nous","Nature","Ancient_Greeks","Natural_philosophy","Archimedes","The_Sand_Reckoner","Stadion_(unit_of_length)","Light_year","Theology","Creation_myth","Creationism","Christian_theology","Afterlife","World_to_Come","Zoroastrianism","Cosmology","Big_Bang","Physical_cosmology","Space-time","Multiverse","Scientific_theory","1000000000_(number)","Short_scale","Big_Bang","Observable_universe","Light_year","Alan_Guth","Inflation_theory","Orders_of_magnitude","Helium","Atom","Sun","Names_of_large_numbers","Short_scale","Space","Time","Speed_of_light","Solar_system","Gravity","General_relativity","Electromagnetic_force","Strong_nuclear_force","Quark","Weak_nuclear_force","String_theory","Quantum_mechanics","Anthropic_principle","Astronomy","Cosmic_View","Cosmic_Zoom","Cosmology","Cosmogram","Cosmography","Carl_Sagan","Television","Documentary_film","Fate_of_the_universe","Lambda-CDM_model","Large_scale_structure_of_the_cosmos","Macrocosm_and_microcosm","Megaverse","Multiverse","Observable_universe","Omega_point_(de_Chardin)","Omniverse","Timeline_of_the_Big_Bang"]}
