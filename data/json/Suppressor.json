{"cursor":"46050","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":", An AR-15, A Heckler & Koch USP Tactical, A Beretta 92FS, and a SIG Mosquito.]]\n\n sniper rifle with attached suppressor.]]\n\nA 'suppressor', 'sound suppressor', or 'sound moderator', is a device attached\nto or part of the barrel of a firearm which reduces the amount of noise and also\nusually the amount of muzzle flash generated by firing the weapon. Suppressors\ncan be used both with gunpowder-based weapons and with compressed air weapons.\nThough they are sometimes referred to as a 'silencer', this term is a misnomer\nassociated with \"movie magic\", as firearms cannot be \"silenced\" due to the pure\nphysics of the projectile moving through the air. Long distance shooting (i.e.\ngreater than 300 meters), while using a supressor can result in a very low, or\nretarded, report noise at the moment of impact, creating a \"silenting\" notion at\nthe point of target. The noise heard at the firearm location as the point a\nprojectile leaves the barrel, though subdued, is not silent at all. [http:/-\n/www.pyramydair.com/article/Airgun_silencers_What_s_the_big_deal_August_2006/32\nSuppressors usable for compressed air weapons]\n\nA suppressor is usually a metal cylinder with internal mechanisms to reduce the\nsound of firing by slowing the escaping propellant gas and sometimes by reducing\nthe velocity of the bullet.\n\nEarly suppressors were created around the beginning of the 20th century by\nseveral inventors. American inventor Hiram Percy Maxim (not to be confused with\nHiram Stevens Maxim, Hiram Percy's father, and the inventor of the Maxim Machine\nGun), is credited with inventing and selling the first commercially successful\nmodels circa 1902 (patented 30 March 1909). Maxim gave his device the\ntrademarked name Maxim Silencer. The muffler for internal combustion engines was\ndeveloped in parallel with the firearm suppressor by Maxim in the early 20th\ncentury, using many of the same techniques to provide quieter-running engines\n(in many European countries automobile mufflers are still called silencers). The\nword silencer in reference to gun suppressor remains in widespread\nuse, although it has since fallen out of favor with some, especially\namong the firearms industry, being replaced with the more literally accurate\nterm sound suppressor or just suppressor, because a \"sound suppressor\" does not\n\"silence\" any weapon, rather it eliminates muzzle flash and reduces the sonic\npressure of a firearm discharging. Common usage and U.S. legislative language\nfavor the historically earlier term, silencer. In U.S. law, the terms \"firearm\nmuffler\" and \"firearm silencer\" are synonymous.\n\nSuppressors were regularly used by agents of the United States Office of\nStrategic Services, who favored the newly designed High Standard HDM .22 Long\nRifle pistol during World War II. OSS Director William Joseph \"Wild Bill\"\nDonovan demonstrated the pistol for President Franklin D. Roosevelt at the\nWhite House. According to OSS research chief Stanley Lovell, Stanley Lovell\n(1963), Of Spies and Stratagems, Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall. Lovell\nclaimed that a weapon so quiet would be more efficient than any death\nray. Donovan (an old and trusted friend of the President) was waved into\nthe Oval Office, where Roosevelt was dictating a letter. While Roosevelt\nfinished his message, Donovan turned his back and fired ten shots into a\nsandbag he had brought with him, announced what he had done and handed the\nsmoking gun to the astonished president. The British SOE (Special Operations\nExecutive) Welrod assassination pistol with an integral suppressor was also\nused by the American OSS on clandestine operations in Nazi occupied Europe\nduring the Second World War.\n","linknr":490,"url":"Suppressor","recorded":1362903005,"links":57,"instances":["wave_propagation","geometry","firearm","mobile_shooter_detection_system","geometry","bore_diameter","hardware","firearms","military","audio","metalworking"],"pdf":["http://www.valkyriearms.com/delisle.pdf","http://www.valkyriearms.com/delisle.pdf"],"categories":["Firearm
