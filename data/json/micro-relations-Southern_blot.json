Southern blotting combines transfer\nof electrophoresis-separated DNA fragments to a filter membrane and subsequent\nfragment detection by probe hybridization. The method is named after its\ninventor, the British biologist Edwin Southern. {{cite journal\n| last = Southern first = Edwin Mellor authorlink = Edwin Southern date = 5\n| November 1975 title = Detection of specific sequences among DNA fragments\n| separated by gel electrophoresis journal = Journal of Molecular Biology volume\n| = 98 issue = 3 pages = 503â517 issn = 0022-2836 doi = 10.1016/S0022-2836(75)80083-\n| 0 pmid = 1195397\n}} Other blotting methods (i.e., western blot, Towbin et al.;\nStaehelin, T; Gordon, J (1979). \"Electrophoretic transfer of proteins from\npolyacrylamide gels to nitrocellulose sheets: procedure and some applications\".\nPNAS 76 (9): 4350. .
