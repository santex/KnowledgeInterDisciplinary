{"cursor":"4426","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\n\n with an earth auger attachment.]]\n\n, ca 1496]]\n\n for woodworking.]]\n\n\n\nAn 'auger' is a drilling device, or drill bit, that usually includes a rotating\nhelical screw blade called a \"flighting\" to act as a screw conveyor to remove\nthe drilled out material. The rotation of the blade causes the material to move\nout of the hole being drilled.\n\nAn auger used for digging post holes is called an 'earth auger', 'handheld power\nearth drill', 'soil auger', or 'mechanized [[post hole digger]]'. This kind of\nauger can be a manually turned, handheld device, or powered by an electric motor\nor internal-combustion engine, possibly attached to a tractor (being provided\nwith power by the tractor engine's power take-off as shown). Handheld augers can\nalso be used for making holes for garden planting.\n\n\n\nWood augers have a screw to pull them into the wood, as a gimlet has, and a\ncutting lip that slices out the bottom of the hole. The auger bit, meant to be\nused in a brace, also has cutting spurs to cut a clean circle deeper than where\nthe lips scrape out the wood. {{cite book\n | title = The little cyclopaedia of common things edition = 12th author =\n | George William Cox publisher = S.

Another use is for piles forming a piling retaining wall,\nwhich can be constructed in the same way as foundation piles.\n\nAugers – either gas- or hand-powered – are used by ice fishermen to\ndrill holes to fish through. Drilling into maple trees to extract maple syrup is\nalso carried out with the use of augers. {{Cite book |author = William M.\nCiesla |title=Non-wood forest products from temperate broad-leaved trees\n|year=2002 |publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations\n|page = 37 |isbn=92-5-104855-X }}\n","linknr":440,"url":"Auger","recorded":1362666266,"links":35,"instances":["tool","simple_machine"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Agricultural machinery","Gardening tools","Mechanical hand tools"],"headings":["References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3a/2009-02-23_Skid_steer_with_extreme_duty_auger.jpg/220px-2009-02-23_Skid_steer_with_extreme_duty_auger.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d8/ADurerAugerBayonne.jpg/220px-ADurerAugerBayonne.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a0/Bit_%28PSF%29.jpg/220px-Bit_%28PSF%29.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/95/Auger_Foundation_Pile_Drill_Rig.jpg/170px-Auger_Foundation_Pile_Drill_Rig.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Post_hole_auger_1905.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["screw","simple_machine"],["gimlet","tool"]],"members":["gimlet","screw"],"related":["Drilling","Drill_bit","Helical","Screw_(simple_machine)","Screw_conveyor","Power_take-off","Gimlet_(tool)","Drilling_rig","Deep_foundation","Retaining_wall","Ice_fishing","Maple","Maple_syrup"]}
