This field overlaps with\nother areas of biology and chemistry, particularly genetics and biochemistry.\nMolecular biology chiefly concerns itself with understanding the interactions\nbetween the various systems of a cell, including the interactions between the\ndifferent types of DNA, RNA and protein biosynthesis as well as learning how\nthese interactions are regulated.\n\nWriting in [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] in 1961, William Astbury described\nmolecular biology as: {{quote|\"...not so much a technique as an approach, an\napproach from the viewpoint of the so-called basic sciences with the leading\nidea of searching below the large-scale manifestations of classical biology for\nthe corresponding molecular plan. It is concerned particularly with the forms of\nbiological molecules and [...] is predominantly three-dimensional and\nstructural—which does not mean, however, that it is merely a refinement of\nmorphology. It must at the same time inquire into genesis and function.\"<ref\nname=\"fn_1\">{{cite journal\n| quotes = last = Astbury first = W.T. authorlink = coauthors = year = 1961\n| month = title = Molecular Biology or Ultrastructural Biology? journal =\n| Nature volume = 190 issue = 4781 pages = 1124 publisher = location = pmid\n| = 13684868 pmc = doi = 10.1038/1901124a0 bibcode = oclc = id = url =\n| http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v190/n4781/pdf/1901124a0.pdf\n| language = format = PDF accessdate = 2008-08-04 laysummary = laysource =\n| laydate = quote =\n}}</ref>}}\n",
