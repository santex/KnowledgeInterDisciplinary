It detects and\ninterprets information from visible light to build a representation of the\nsurrounding environment. The visual system carries out a number of complex\ntasks, including the reception of light and the formation of monocular\nrepresentations; the buildup of a binocular perception from a pair of two\ndimensional projections; the identification and categorization of visual\nobjects; assessing distances to and between objects; and guiding body movements\nin relation to visual objects. The psychological process of visual information\nis known as visual perception, a lack of which is called blindness. Non-image\nforming visual functions, independent of visual perception, include the\npupillary light reflex (PLR) and circadian photoentrainment.\n","title":"Visual%20system","headings":["Introduction","History","Biology of the visual system","Visual system and balance","See also","References","Further reading","External links"]},"micro-relation":["5: Lateral_geniculate_nucleus","3: Visual_perception","2: Central_nervous_system","2: Neuron","2: Visual_cortex","2: Occipital_lobe","2: Primary_visual_cortex","2: Field_of_view","2: Photoreceptor_cell","2: Melanopsin","2: Visual_processing","2: Axons","2: Photosensitive_ganglion_cell","2: Visual_cortex#Primary_visual_cortex_.28V1.29","1: Visible_light","1: Blindness","1: Pupillary_light_reflex","1: Mammal","1: Eye#Eye","1: Visual_system#Retina","1: Visual_system#Optic_nerve","1: Optic_chiasm#Optic_chiasm","1: Visual_system#Optic_tract","1: Lateral_geniculate_body#Lateral_geniculate_body","1: Optic_radiation#Optic_radiation","1: Visual_cortex#Visual_cortex","1: Visual_association_cortex#Visual_association_cortex","1: Species","1: Light_spectrum","1: Bee","1: Ultraviolet","1: Pit_viper","1: Pit_organ","1: Swordfish","1: Heat","1: Prey","1: Nervous_system","1: Neuron_doctrine","1: Neuroscience","1: Cerebral_cortex","1: Touch","1: Somatosensory_cortex","1: Motor_cortex","1: Franz_Joseph_Gall","1: Paul_Broca","1: Language_center","1: Gustav_Fritsch","1: Edouard_Hitzig","1: Lesion_study","1: David_Ferrier","1: Parietal_lobe","1: Hermann_Munk","1: Transducer","1: Charge-coupled_device","1: Refracted","1: Cornea","1: Pupil","1: Protein","1: Molecule","1: Opsin","1: Rod_cell","1: Cone_cell","1: Pretectal_area","1: Photon","1: Signal_transduction_pathway","1: Fovea","1: Wavelengths","1: Color","1: Bipolar_cell_of_the_retina","1: Ganglion_cell","1: Action_potentials","1: Brain","1: Receptive_fields","1: Horizontal_cell","1: Amacrine_cell","1: Depth_perception","1: Shape","1: University_of_Pennsylvania","1: Guinea_pig","1: Retinene","1: Retina","1: Light","1: Optic_chiasm","1: Optic_tract","1: Andreas_Vesalius","1: Optic_nerve","1: Thalamus","1: Perception","1: Superior_colliculus","1: Midbrain","1: Saccades","1: Retinohypothalamic_tract","1: Pretectum","1: Circadian_rhythms","1: Sleep","1: Suprachiasmatic_nucleus","1: Ventrolateral_preoptic_nucleus","1: VLPO","1: Hypothalamus","1: Visual_field","1: Human","1: Primate","1: Information","1: Credit_card","1: Caudal_end","1: Cerebellum","1: Visual_hierarchy","1: Two_Streams_hypothesis","1: Functional_Magnetic_Resonance_Imaging","1: Principal_components_analysis","1: Proprioception","1: Vestibular_function","1: Glaucoma","1: Cataract","1: Monocular_vision","1: Achromatopsia","1: Akinetopsia","1: Apperceptive_agnosia","1: Associative_visual_agnosia","1: Color_blindness","1: Human_echolocation","1: Computer_vision","1: Helmholtz–Kohlrausch_effect","1: Color_balance","1: Memory-prediction_framework","1: Prosopagnosia","1: Scotopic_sensitivity_syndrome","1: Recovery_from_blindness","1: Visual_agnosia","1: Visual_modularity"]}
