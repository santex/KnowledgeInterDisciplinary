{"cursor":"4995","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'court clerk' (British English 'clerk to the court'; American English 'clerk\nof the court' or 'clerk of court') is an officer of the court whose\nresponsibilities include maintaining the records of a court. Another duty is to\nadminister oaths to witnesses, jurors, and grand jurors. Traditionally, the\nclerk also was the custodian of the court's seal, which is used to authenticate\ncopies of the court's orders, judgments and other records.\n\nIn common law jurisdictions, the existence of the office of a clerk is one of\nthe typical criteria distinguishing a court of record.\n\nHe/She may be more precisely titled after the (type of) court, e.g. clerk of the\npeace attending to a justice of the peace, clerk of the police court, etc. On\nGuernsey, the medieval French term 'greffe' is used (in the magistrates' court).\n\nIn some jurisdictions, the court clerk is the one who reads the jury's verdict\nform to the court. In many states, the clerk of circuit court may officiate\ncivil weddings. [http://www.pwcgov.org/default.aspx?topic=010010000930001560\nCircuit Court Clerk to Perform Valentine Weddings], Prince William County,\nFebruary 6, 2003.\n\nIn courts without a clerk, or if there is no specific officer otherwise\navailable, the judge may have authority to act as clerk of the court, as\nsometimes in a short-staffed probate court.\n\nIn some U.S. states, including Florida, Nevada, and Washington, the state trial\ncourts technically do not have their own clerks, but are supposed to use the\nservices of the county clerk, who is normally an elected official. Several U.S.\nstates, like California, that previously had this arrangement eventually\nrecognized that it violates the principle of separation of powers (because the\ncounty clerk is a member of the executive branch), abolished it, and in its\nplace authorized each state trial court to appoint its own court clerk.\n\nIn the U.S. state of North Carolina, the elected clerk of the superior court is\nthe ex officio judge of probate, and s/he and his/her numerous assistants and\ndeputies actually possess limited judicial powers (thus making them the de facto\nequivalent of commissioners or referees used for similar purposes in other\nstates). Elected clerks and assistant clerks in North Carolina can hear probate,\nincompetency, adoption, and foreclosure hearings. Deputy clerks and assistant\nclerks can issue warrants, orders for arrest, orders for contempt, and orders\nfor involuntary commitment in an incompetency matter. In addition, assistants\nand deputies may hear a criminal first appearance, may appoint indigent counsel\nor public defenders, and may sign release and temporary confinement orders for\npersons held in custody.\n\nIn the United States federal courts, each district court, court of appeals, and\nbankruptcy court, as well as the Supreme Court, has its own clerk, appointed by\nthe judges of the court. The clerk is the custodian of the court's records and\nalso has responsibility for collecting fees and other deposits of money made\nwith the court. The court clerk is not to be confused with the law clerk who\nassists the judge in making legal determinations. And in the courts within the\nCity of New York, the Court Clerk, who is a Peace Officer, is the highest\nranking, non-judicial person in the courtroom. The Court Clerk is the supervisor\nof the Court Officers in the Courtroom.\n\nIn an English Magistrates' Court, where the bench will usually have no legal\nqualifications, the Court Clerk will be legally qualified. The magistrates\ndecide on the facts at issue; the clerk advises them on the law relating to the\ncase.\n\nThe Court Clerk is a critical safeguard for integrity of the courts. In most\ncourts, only the clerk, but not a judge, is the keeper of the Seal of the Court.\nThe clerk is also required to attest/authenticate judicial records, to render\nthem such that command \"full faith and credit\".\n\nA unique historic study [http://www.scribd.com/doc/34819774/] Order in The\nCourt - History of Clerks of United States Courts  of corruption of the\nCourt Clerks in the United States courts, can therefore be inferred to reflect\nthe variations in integrity of the courts as a whole during the same periods.\n","linknr":125,"url":"Court_clerk","recorded":1364057791,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Court_clerk&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Court_clerk&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/British_English","/wiki/American_English","/wiki/Officer_of_the_court","/wiki/Court","/wiki/Oath","/wiki/Witness","/wiki/Jury","/wiki/Grand_jury","/wiki/Seal_(device)","/wiki/Court_order","/wiki/Common_law","/wiki/Jurisdiction","/wiki/Court_of_record","/wiki/Clerk_of_the_Peace","/wiki/Justice_of_the_peace","/wiki/Verdict","/wiki/Civil_wedding","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Probate_court","/wiki/Separation_of_powers","/wiki/Executive_branch","/wiki/United_States_federal_courts","/wiki/United_States_district_court","/wiki/United_States_court_of_appeals","/wiki/United_States_bankruptcy_court","/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States","/wiki/Law_clerk","/wiki/Judge","/wiki/Magistrates%27_Court_(England_and_Wales)","/wiki/Bench_(law)","#cite_note-2","#cite_note-3","/w/index.php?title=Court_clerk&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","http://www.pwcgov.org/default.aspx?topic=010010000930001560","#cite_ref-2","http://www.hmcourts-service.gov.uk/infoabout/magistrates/index.htm","http://www.hmcourts-service.gov.uk/infoabout/magistrates/index.htm","#cite_ref-3","http://www.scribd.com/doc/34819774/","/wiki/File:Scale_of_justice_2.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/Scale_of_justice_2.svg/22px-Scale_of_justice_2.svg.png","/wiki/Law","/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Court_clerk&action=edit","/wiki/Template:Law-stub","/wiki/Template_talk:Law-stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Law-stub&action=edit","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Court_clerk&oldid=540523482","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Law_stubs","/wiki/Category:Legal_professions","/wiki/Category:Scots_law_general_titles","/wiki/Category:Law_in_the_United_Kingdom","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Court+clerk&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Court+clerk","/wiki/Court_clerk","/wiki/Talk:Court_clerk","#","/wiki/Court_clerk","/w/index.php?title=Court_clerk&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Court_clerk&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Court_clerk","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Court_clerk","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Court_clerk&oldid=540523482","/w/index.php?title=Court_clerk&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Court_clerk&id=540523482","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Court+clerk","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Court+clerk&oldid=540523482&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Court_clerk&printable=yes","//de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gesch%C3%A4ftsstelle#Urkundsbeamter_der_Gesch.C3.A4ftsstelle","//es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretario_judicial","//eo.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aktuaro","//fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greffier","//it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancelliere_(ordinamento_giudiziario)","//nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Griffier","//ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A1%D1%83%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%B1%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B9_%D0%BF%D0%B8%D1%81%D0%B0%D1%80%D1%8C","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:ItemByTitle/enwiki/Court
