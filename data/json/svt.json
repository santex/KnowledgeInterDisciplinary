The Swedish public broadcasting\nsystem is largely modeled after the system used in the United Kingdom, and\nSveriges Television shares many traits with its British counterpart, the BBC.\n\nSVT is a public limited company that can be described as a quasi-autonomous non-\ngovernment organisation. Together with the other two public broadcasters,\nSveriges Radio and Sveriges Utbildningsradio, it is owned by an independent\nfoundation, Förvaltningsstiftelsen för Sveriges Radio AB, Sveriges Television AB\noch Sveriges Utbildningsradio AB, The foundation's board consist of 13\npoliticians, representing the political parties in the Riksdag and appointed by\nthe Government. The foundation in turn appoints the members of the SVT board.\nSVTs regulatory framework is governed by Swedish law. Originally, SVT and\nSveriges Radio were a joint company, but since 1979 they and Sveriges\nUtbildningsradio are sister companies sharing some joint services.\n\nSVT maintained a monopoly in domestic terrestrial broadcasting from the start in\n1956 until the privately held TV4 started broadcasting terrestrially in 1992. It\nis barred from accepting advertisements except in the case of sponsors for major\nsporting events. Until the launch of the Swedish language satellite television\nchannel TV3 in 1987, Sveriges Television provided the only Swedish television\navailable to the public. SVT is still the biggest TV network in Sweden, with an\naudience share of 36.4%.\n","title":"Sveriges%20Television","headings":["History","Programming","Channels","Organization","Viewing","See also","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["9: SVT1","8: Sveriges_Utbildningsradio","7: SVT2","6: Sveriges_Radio","6: SVT24","3: Eva_Hamilton","3: Kunskapskanalen","3: Riksdag","3: MalmÃ¶","2: SVT_Barnkanalen","2: SVT_Play","2: SVT_World","2: European_Broadcasting_Union","2: SVT_Europa","2: SVT_Extra","2: SVTB","2: TV4_AB","2: SVT_HD","2: Eurovision_Song_Contest_1975","2: Eurovision_Song_Contest_1985","2: Eurovision_Song_Contest_1992","2: Eurovision_Song_Contest_2000","2: Eurovision_Song_Contest_2013","2: Eurovision_Song_Contest","2: High-definition_television","2: Lars_Engqvist","1: Terrestrial_television","1: Television_network","1: FÃ¶rvaltningsstiftelsen_fÃ¶r_Sveriges_Radio","1: Sweden","1: Public_broadcasting","1: Television_licence","1: Television_set","1: BBC","1: Government_of_Sweden","1: Swedish_language","1: Satellite_television","1: British_Broadcasting_Company","1: Tidningarnas_TelegrambyrÃ¥","1: Royal_Institute_of_Technology","1: Stockholm","1: NackasÃ¤ndaren","1: Teletext","1: Sveriges_Riksradio","1: Sveriges_Lokalradio_AB","1: Scottish_Television","1: Kanal_1","1: NICAM","1: Finland-Swedes","1: Digital_terrestrial_television","1: AllsÃ¥ng_pÃ¥_Skansen","1: VODcast","1: High_definition_television","1: 2006_FIFA_World_Cup","1: Aktuellt","1: Play_Rapport","1: SVT_Uutiset","1: OÄÄasat","1: Sami_language","1: Nyhetstecken","1: Swedish_Sign_Language","1: First_World","1: SOM_Institute","1: University_of_Gothenburg","1: Moderate_Party","1: Swedish_Social_Democratic_Party","1: Swedish_general_election,_2006","1: Reality_television","1: Robinson_Crusoe","1: Skansen","1: Folk_music","1: Blekingenytt","1: GÃ¤vleDala","1: Hallandsnytt","1: JÃ¤mtlandsnytt","1: JÃ¶nkÃ¶pingsnytt","1: Mittnytt","1: Nordnytt","1: SmÃ¥landsnytt","1: Sydnytt","1: TvÃ¤rsnytt","1: Uppland","1: VÃ¤rmlandsnytt","1: VÃ¤sterbottensnytt","1: VÃ¤stmanlandsnytt","1: VÃ¤stnytt","1: Ãstnytt","1: Bolibompa","1: United_Kingdom","1: Nordvision","1: Danmarks_Radio","1: NRK","1: YLE","1: SjÃ³nvarp_FÃ¸roya","1: RÃV","1: 2004_Summer_Olympics","1: English_language","1: Ãland","1: Svt.se","1: SVT_Syd","1: SVT_MalmÃ¶","1: SVT_VÃ¤xjÃ¶","1: GÃ¶teborg","1: SVT_VÃ¤st","1: SVT_GÃ¶teborg","1: NorrkÃ¶ping","1: SVT_Mellansverige","1: SVT_Falun","1: DÃ¶vas_TV_Leksand","1: SVT_Karlstad","1: SVT_Ãrebro","1: SVT_NorrkÃ¶ping","1: UmeÃ¥","1: SVT_Nord","1: SVT_LuleÃ¥","1: SVT_UmeÃ¥","1: SVT_Sundsvall","1: SVT_Nyheter_&_SamhÃ¤lle","1: SVT_Sport","1: SVT_Fiktion","1: Anna-Greta_Leijon","1: Allan_Larsson","1: Erik_Baehrentz","1: HÃ¥kan_Unsgaard","1: Ãrjan_Wallquist","1: Magnus_FaxÃ©n","1: Sam_Nilsson","1: Maria_Curman","1: Christina_JutterstrÃ¶m","1: Mikael_Olsson","1: Leif_Jakobsson","1: List_of_Swedish_television_channels","1: RadiotjÃ¤nst_i_Kiruna","1: Swedish_Broadcasting_Commission","1: Teracom","1: Viasat"]}
