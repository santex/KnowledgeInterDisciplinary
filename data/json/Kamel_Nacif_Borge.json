He is one of the richest men in Mexico and one of the biggest\nand most famous gamblers in the world. He is said to have built the Caesars\nPalace hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada, with all the money he lost at the casino's\nbaccarat tables.\n\nIt is said that Kamel Nacif forged his own future by working really hard since\nthe time he was 15-years-old. He started out as a small merchant by importing\nfabrics from overseas until he eventually built a textile empire that employed\nover 20,000 people. In 1999, he partnered with an apparel company known as the\nTarrant Apparel Group, who manufactured denim jeans for brands such as Calvin\nKlein, Tommy Hilfiger, Chaps, Gap, Abercrombie and Fitch, and American Eagle.

He has also been related with the\nPuebla Governor Mario Marin in the illegal acquisition of real estate.\n\nDuring 2004 he acquired for 44 million dollars the whole property (100% of the\ncommon stock) of the company \"Tarrant Appareal Group\", an organization with\nsubsidiaries in Chile, China, Thailand, Korea and in the United States (Los\nAngeles and New York city).

The relationship between the Mexican government and the\nentrepreneur was confirmed when he was the beneficiary of a soft loan of 5\nmillion dollars during the Fobaproa program.\n\nIn 2005–06, he became embroiled in scandals of political and sexual\nnature.
