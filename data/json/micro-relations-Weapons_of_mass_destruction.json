{"cursor":"51219","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\n\nA 'weapon of mass destruction' ('WMD') is a weapon that can kill and bring\nsignificant harm to a large number of humans (and other life forms) and/or cause\ngreat damage to man-made structures (e.g. buildings), natural structures (e.g.\nmountains), or the biosphere in general. The scope and application of the term\nhas evolved and been disputed, often signifying more politically than\ntechnically. Coined in reference to aerial bombing with chemical explosives, it\nhas come to distinguish large-scale weaponry of other technologies, such as\nchemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear. This differentiates the term\nfrom more technical ones such as chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear\nweapons (CBRN).\n","linknr":772,"url":"Weapons_of_mass_destruction","recorded":1362373407,"links":93,"instances":["town","poison","journalist"],"pdf":["http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=2001_presidential_documents&docid=pd14my01_txt-9.pdf","http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=2001_presidential_documents&docid=pd14my01_txt-9.pdf","http://www.defenselink.mil/pubs/ptr20010110.pdf","http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=gao&docid=f:d01582.pdf","http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=gao&docid=f:d01582.pdf","http://fl1.findlaw.com/news.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/reid/usreid1002ind.pdf","http://fl1.findlaw.com/news.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/reid/usreid1002ind.pdf","http://www.terrorisminfo.mipt.org/pdf/usvwiseandgrebe_99-40247.pdf","http://www.dni.gov/press_releases/20071203_release.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20041022050812/http://www.cissm.umd.edu/documents/WMDstudy_full.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20060210232719/www.pipa.org/OnlineReports/Iraq/IraqMedia_Oct03/IraqMedia_Oct03_rpt.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20050929024408/http://www.pipa.org/OnlineReports/WMD/WMDreport_04_15_04.pdf","http://www.pipa.org/OnlineReports/WMD/WMDreport_04_15_04.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20050929024408/http://www.pipa.org/OnlineReports/WMD/WMDreport_04_15_04.pdf","http://www.michigan.gov/documents/CIS_WSH_part476_54539_7.pdf","http://www.michigan.gov/documents/CIS_WSH_part476_54539_7.pdf","http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Magazines/Bulletin/Bull482/pdfs/18RadSymbol.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20060217212308/http://www.cissm.umd.edu/documents/WMDstudy_full.pdf","http://www.pipa.org/OnlineReports/WMDProliferation/WMD_Prolif_Apr04/WMDProlif_Apr04_rpt.pdf","http://www.bomb-shelter.net/nuc%20table.pdf","http://www.bomb-shelter.net/nuc%20table.pdf"],"categories":["Weapons
