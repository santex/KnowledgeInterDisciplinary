{"cursor":"4044","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n'Cabinet collective responsibility' is constitutional convention in governments\nusing the Westminster System that members of the Cabinet must publicly support\nall governmental decisions made in Cabinet, even if they do not privately agree\nwith them. This support includes voting for the government in the legislature.\nSome Communist political parties apply a similar convention of democratic\ncentralism to their central committee.\n\nCabinet collective responsibility is related to the fact that, if a vote of no\nconfidence is passed in parliament, the government is responsible collectively,\nand thus the entire government resigns. The consequence will be that a new\ngovernment will be formed, or parliament will dissolve and a general election\nwill be called. Cabinet collective responsibility is not the same as individual\nministerial responsibility, which states that ministers are responsible and\ntherefore culpable for the running of their departments.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the doctrine applies to all members of the government,\nfrom members of the cabinet down to Parliamentary Private Secretaries. Its inner\nworkings are set out in the Ministerial Code. On occasion, this principle has\nbeen suspended; most notably in the 1930s when in Britain the National\nGovernment allowed its Liberal members to oppose the introduction of protective\ntariffs; and again when Harold Wilson allowed Cabinet members to campaign both\nfor and against the 1975 referendum on whether the UK should remain in the\nEuropean Economic Community. In 2003, Tony Blair allowed Clare Short to stay in\nthe cabinet, despite her public opposition to the 2003 Iraq War. However, she\nlater resigned.\n\nThe convention appears to have been partially suspended under the Conservative -\nLiberal Democrat Coalition Government of Prime Minister David Cameron, with\nLiberal Democrat ministers such as Vince Cable frequently publicly criticising\nthe actions of Conservative Cabinet members.\n\nIn Canada, the cabinet is on rare occasion allowed to freely vote its conscience\nand to oppose the government without consequence, as occurred with the vote on\ncapital punishment under Brian Mulroney. These events are rare and are never on\nmatters of confidence. The most prominent Canadian cabinet minister to resign\nbecause he could not vote with the cabinet was John Turner, who refused to\nsupport wage and price controls. In Canada, party discipline is much tighter\nthan in other Westminster-system countries; it is very rare for any MP to vote\ncounter to the party leadership. Similarly, in Australia on occasional issues\n(such as the 1999 republic referendum), there may be a conscience vote where any\nMP may vote as they wish, but these issues are rare and never tied to official\nparty policy, and normally party discipline is very tight as it is in Canada.\n\nCollective responsibility is not circumvented by appointing Ministers Outside of\nCabinet, Cabinet Office Cabinet Manual 2008 (Wellington, 2008) para\n3.20 as has occurred in New Zealand where, from 2005 to 2008, Winston\nPeters and Peter Dunne were Ministers outside of Cabinet, despite their parties\nnot being considered part of a coalition.\n","linknr":126,"url":"Cabinet_collective_responsibility","recorded":1375066051,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Cabinet_collective_responsibility&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Cabinet_collective_responsibility&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Collective_responsibility","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cabinet_collective_responsibility&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Template:Citation_needed","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/Constitutional_convention_(political_custom)","/wiki/Westminster_System","/wiki/Cabinet_(government)","/wiki/Democratic_centralism","/wiki/Central_committee","/wiki/Vote_of_no_confidence","/wiki/Parliament","/wiki/General_election","/wiki/Individual_ministerial_responsibility","/wiki/Minister_(government)","/wiki/United_Kingdom","/wiki/Parliamentary_Private_Secretary","/wiki/Ministerial_Code_(United_Kingdom)","/wiki/National_Government_(United_Kingdom)","/wiki/Liberal_Party_(UK)","/wiki/Protectionism","/wiki/Harold_Wilson","/wiki/United_Kingdom_European_Communities_membership_referendum,_1975","/wiki/European_Economic_Community","/wiki/Tony_Blair","/wiki/Clare_Short","/wiki/2003_Iraq_War","/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)","/wiki/Liberal_Democrats_(UK)","/wiki/Cameron_Ministry","/wiki/David_Cameron","/wiki/Vince_Cable","/wiki/Canada","/wiki/Capital_punishment","/wiki/Brian_Mulroney","/wiki/Confidence_and_supply","/wiki/John_Turner","/wiki/Wage_and_price_controls","/wiki/Party_discipline","/wiki/Australia","/wiki/Conscience_vote","#cite_note-1","/wiki/New_Zealand","/wiki/Winston_Peters","/wiki/Peter_Dunne","/w/index.php?title=Cabinet_collective_responsibility&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Cabinet_solidarity","/wiki/Democratic_centralism","/wiki/Leninist","/wiki/Ministerstyre","/w/index.php?title=Cabinet_collective_responsibility&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-1","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cabinet_collective_responsibility&oldid=543844814","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Political_terminology","/wiki/Category:Politics_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Category:Westminster_system","/wiki/Category:Articles_needing_additional_references_from_May_2008","/wiki/Category:All_articles_needing_additional_references","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Cabinet+collective+responsibility&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Cabinet+collective+responsibility","/wiki/Cabinet_collective_responsibility","/wiki/Talk:Cabinet_collective_responsibility","#","/wiki/Cabinet_collective_responsibility","/w/index.php?title=Cabinet_collective_responsibility&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Cabinet_collective_responsibility&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Cabinet_collective_responsibility","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Cabinet_collective_responsibility","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Cabinet_collective_responsibility&oldid=543844814","/w/index.php?title=Cabinet_collective_responsibility&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3489446","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Cabinet_collective_responsibility&id=543844814","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Cabinet+collective+responsibility","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Cabinet+collective+responsibility&oldid=543844814&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Cabinet_collective_responsibility&printable=yes","//fr.wikipedia.
