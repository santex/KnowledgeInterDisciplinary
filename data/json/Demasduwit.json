The Beothuk were openly hostile\nto Europeans, and violent conflict between the two groups was common. The\nconflicts usually took more Beothuks than Europeans, which led to their decline.\nThese new settlers also had taken up residence in the coastal areas, which\nhindered the Beothuks' access to food resources near the coast.\n\nIn the fall of 1818, a small group of Beothuks had taken a boat and some fishing\nequipment at the mouth of the Exploits River. The governor of the colony,\nCharles Hamilton, authorized an attempt to recover the stolen property. On March\n1, 1819, John Peyton Jr. and eight armed men went up the Exploits River to Red\nIndian Lake in search of Beothuks and their equipment. A dozen Beothuk fled the\ncampsite, Demasduit among them. Bogged down in the snow she exposed her breasts,\na nursing mother, begging for mercy. Demasduit was captured; Nonosbawsut, her\nhusband and the leader of the group, was killed while attempting to prevent her\ncapture. Her infant son died a few days after she was taken.\n\nPeyton and his men were absolved of their murder by a grand jury in St. John's,\nthe judge concluded that, \"..(there was) no malice on the part of Peyton's party\nto get possession of any of (the Indians) by such violence as would occasion\nbloodshed.\"\n\nDemasduit was taken to Twillingate and for a time lived with the Church of\nEngland priest, the Reverend John Leigh. He learned that she was also called\nShendoreth and Waunathoake, but he renamed her Mary March, after the Virgin Mary\nand the month in which she was kidnapped.\n\nDemasduit was brought to St. John's and spent much of the spring of 1819 in St.\nJohn's, brought there by Leigh and John Peyton Jr. While there, Lady Hamilton\npainted her portrait.\n\nDuring the summer of 1819, a number of attempts were made to return her to her\npeople, without success. Captain David Buchan was to go overland to Red Indian\nLake with Demasduit in November, the people of St. John's and Notre Dame Bay\nhaving raised the money to return the Beothuk to her home. She died of\ntuberculosis at Ship Cove (now Botwood) aboard Buchan's vessel, the Grasshopper,\non January 8, 1820. Her body was left in a coffin on the lakeshore, where it was\nfound by members of her tribe and returned to her village in\nFebruary. MacLean, John. \"Canadian Savage People\", 1896. pp 318. She\nwas placed in a burial hut beside her husband and child. There were only thirty-\none of the Beothuk remaining at that time.\n\nDemasduit's niece, a young woman named Shanawdithit (1801-1829), was the last\nknown Beothuk.\n\nA song, Demasduit Dream, recorded by Newfoundland band Great Big Sea, describes\nthis incident.\n\nThe Mary March Provincial Museum in the town of Grand Falls-Windsor,\nNewfoundland and Labrador, is named after her. In May, 2006, a group of local\ngrade 2 students, led by student Connor O'Driscoll, helped collect more than 500\nsignatures on a petition to rename of the museum to reflect Demasduit's real\nidentity, rather than the name she was given after her capture.\n","linknr":136,"url":"Demasduwit","recorded":1375068064,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Demasduit&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Demasduit&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","/wiki/Demasduit","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","/w/index.php?title=Demasduwit&redirect=no","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Demasduit.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e2/Demasduit.jpg/250px-Demasduit.jpg","/wiki/File:Demasduit.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Henrietta_Hamilton","#cite_note-1","/wiki/File:The_taking_of_Demasduit.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/The_taking_of_Demasduit.jpg/250px-The_taking_of_Demasduit.jpg","/wiki/File:The_taking_of_Demasduit.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Shanawdithit","/wiki/File:Shanawdithit_portrait.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Shanawdithit_portrait.jpg/220px-Shanawdithit_portrait.jpg","/wiki/File:Shanawdithit_portrait.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Philip_Henry_Gosse","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Circa","/wiki/Beothuk","/wiki/Newfoundland_(island)","/wiki/Exploits_River","/wiki/Charles_Hamilton_(governor)","/wiki/Red_Indian_Lake","/wiki/Nonosbawsut","/wiki/Twillingate,_Newfoundland_and_Labrador","/wiki/Virgin_Mary","/wiki/St._John%27s,_Newfoundland_and_Labrador","/wiki/Henrietta_Hamilton","/wiki/David_Buchan","/wiki/Notre_Dame_Bay","/wiki/Tuberculosis","/wiki/Botwood,_Newfoundland_and_Labrador","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Shanawdithit","/wiki/Beothuk","/wiki/Great_Big_Sea","/w/index.php?title=Mary_March_Provincial_Museum&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Grand_Falls-Windsor,_Newfoundland_and_Labrador","/w/index.php?title=Demasduit&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/List_of_people_of_Newfoundland_and_Labrador","/w/index.php?title=Demasduit&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-1","#cite_ref-2","http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/face/Article.jsp?id=h-1659","#cite_ref-3","/w/index.php?title=Demasduit&action=edit&section=3","http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&id_nbr=2362","http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2006/05/31/beothuk-museum.html","http://www.cbc.ca/ideas/features/mary-march/index.html","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/60148431","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Demasduit&oldid=541170153","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1796_births","/wiki/Category:1820_deaths","/wiki/Category:Beothuk_people","/wiki/Category:People_from_Newfoundland_(island)","/wiki/Category:Pre-Confederation_Newfoundland_and_Labrador_people","/wiki/Category:Deaths_from_tuberculosis","/wiki/Category:Infectious_disease_deaths_in_Newfoundland_and_Labrador","/wiki/Category:Persons_of_National_Historic_Significance_(Canada)","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Demasduit&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Demasduit","/wiki/Demasduit","/wiki/Talk:Demasduit","#","/wiki/Demasduit","/w/index.php?title=Demasduit&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Demasduit&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Demasduit","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Demasduit","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Demasduit&oldid=541170153","/w/index.php?title=Demasduit&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q465539","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Demasduit&id=5
