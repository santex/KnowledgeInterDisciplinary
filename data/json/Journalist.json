A\njournalist's work is referred to as journalism.\n\nA 'reporter' is a type of journalist who researches, writes, and reports\ninformation to present in sources, conduct interviews, engage in research, and\nmake reports. The information-gathering part of a journalist's job is sometimes\ncalled \"reporting,\" in contrast to the production part of the job such as\nwriting articles. Reporters may split their time between working in a newsroom\nand going out to witness events or interview people. Reporters may be assigned a\nspecific beat or area of coverage.\n\nDepending on the context, the term journalist may include various types of\neditors, editorial writers, columnists, and visual journalists, such as\nphotojournalists (journalists who use the medium of photography).\n\nJournalism has developed a variety of ethics and standards. While objectivity\nand a lack of bias are often considered important, some types of journalism,\nsuch as advocacy journalism, intentionally adopt a non-objective viewpoint.\n","linknr":365,"url":"Journalist","recorded":1362672548,"links":95,"instances":["journalism","journalism","publisher"],"pdf":["http://www.grady.uga.edu/annualsurveys/Graduate_Survey/Graduate_2009/Grad2009MergedB&W.pdf"],"categories":["Journalists|","Media occupations","Occupations","Journalism occupations","Reporting","Broadcasting occupations","Television terminology"],"headings":["Salaries and job outlook","Journalistic freedom","See also","Notes","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/Reporter.jpg/220px-Reporter.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/Pn-telekanal-1998-staff.jpg/220px-Pn-telekanal-1998-staff.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/Newspaper_nicu_buculei_01.svg/28px-Newspaper_nicu_buculei_01.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["source","journalism"],["objectivity","journalism"],["doubleday","publisher"]],"members":["source","objectivity","doubleday"],"related":["News","Information","Journalism","Research","Source_(journalism)","Interview","Newsroom","Beat_reporting","Editing","Columnist","Photojournalist","Photography","Journalism_ethics_and_standards","Objectivity_(journalism)","Media_bias","Advocacy_journalism","Henry_W._Grady_College_of_Journalism_and_Mass_Communication","University_of_Georgia","Bachelor's_degree","Master's_degree","Mass_communication","United_States","Puerto_Rico","United_States_Department_of_Labor","Bureau_of_Labor_Statistics","Armed_conflict","Freedom_of_the_press","Committee_to_Protect_Journalists","Reporters_Without_Borders","Committee_to_Protect_Journalists","Murder","Crossfire","Combat","Iraq","Philippines","Russia","Colombia","Mexico","Algeria","Pakistan","India","Somalia","Brazil","Turkey","People's_Republic_of_China","Iran","Eritrea","Burma","Uzbekistan","Vietnam","Cuba","Ethiopia","Sudan","List_of_journalists","Critic","War_correspondent","24-hour_news_cycle","Broadcast_journalism","Electronic_field_production","Electronic_news-gathering","List_of_ITV_journalists_and_newsreaders","Local_news","News_broadcasting","News_presenter","News_program","Newsroom","Outside_broadcasting","Student_newspaper","Rowman_&_Littlefield","Pluto_Press","Doubleday_(publisher)","Atheneum_Books"]}
