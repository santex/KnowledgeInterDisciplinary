{"cursor":"2590","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n of a sodium ion dissolved in water]]\n\nAn 'aqueous solution' is a solution in which the solvent is water. It is usually\nshown in chemical equations by appending (aq) to the relevant formula, such as\nNaCl (aq). The word aqueous means pertaining to, related to, similar to, or\ndissolved in water. As water is an excellent solvent and is also naturally\nabundant, it is a ubiquitous solvent in chemistry.\n\nSubstances which are [[hydrophobic]] ('water fearing') often do not dissolve\nwell in water whereas those that [[hydrophilic]] ('water-loving') do. An example\nof a hydrophilic substance would be sodium chloride (ordinary table salt). Acids\nand bases are aqueous solutions, as part of their Arrhenius definitions.\n\nThe ability of a substance to dissolve in water is determined by whether the\nsubstance can match or exceed the strong attractive forces that water molecules\ngenerate between themselves. If the substance lacks the ability to dissolve in\nwater the molecules form a precipitate.\n\nAqueous solutions that conduct electric current efficiently contain strong\nelectrolytes, while ones that conduct poorly are considered to have weak\nelectrolytes. Those strong electrolytes are substances that are completely\nionized in water, whereas the weak electrolytes exhibit only a small degree of\nionization in water.\n\nNonelectrolytes are substances that dissolve in water, but which maintain their\nmolecular integrity (do not dissociate into ions). Examples include sugar, urea,\nglycerol, and methylsulfonylmethane (MSM).\n\nWhen performing calculations regarding the reacting of one or more aqueous\nsolutions, one generally must know the concentration, or molarity, of the\naqueous solutions. Solution concentration is given in terms of the form of the\nsolute prior to it dissolving.\n","linknr":196,"url":"Aqueous_solution","recorded":1362481618,"links":34,"instances":["chemistry","chemistry","chemistry","molecule"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Chemical properties","Solutions"],"headings":["See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/67/Na%2BH2O.svg/220px-Na%2BH2O.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/Chem_template.svg/32px-Chem_template.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["water","molecule"],["base","chemistry"],["precipitation","chemistry"],["dissociation","chemistry"]],"members":["base","precipitation","dissociation","water"],"related":["Solution","Solvent","Chemical_equations","Chemical_formula","Solvation","Water_(molecule)","Chemistry","Sodium_chloride","Acid","Base_(chemistry)","Acid-base_reaction_theories","Precipitation_(chemistry)","Electric_current","Electrolyte","Ionization","Sugar","Urea","Glycerol","Methylsulfonylmethane","Chemical_reaction","Concentration","Molarity","Solubility","Dissociation_(chemistry)","Acid-base_reaction_theories","Boston","Houghton_Mifflin_Company"]}
