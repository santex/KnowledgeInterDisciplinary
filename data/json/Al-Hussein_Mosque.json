{"cursor":"8462","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Al-Hussein Mosque' (, Egyptian Arabic: ) ; alternative transliterations:\n'Husayn', 'Hussain', 'Husayn', 'Hussayn'; also prefixed by the honorific title\n'[[Sayyid]]na') is a mosque built in 1154 and located in Cairo, Egypt, near the\nKhan El-Khalili bazaar. It is named for the grandson of Muhammad, Husayn ibn\nAli, whose head is believed by Fatimid Shia/Dawoodi Bohra and some Sunni Muslims\nto be buried on the grounds of the mosque. Many ShÄ«âah Muslims believe that the\nhead of Husayn ibn Ali is with his body in the Imam Husayn Mosque in\nKarbala. The mosque, considered to be one of the holiest Islamic\nsites in Cairo, was built on the cemetery of the Fatimid caliphs, a fact that\nwas later discovered during the excavation. The mausoleum (dating back to 1154)\nis the oldest part of the complex. Williams, Caroline. 2002. Islamic\nMonuments in Cairo: The Practical Guide. Cairo: American University in Cairo\nPress, 193-194. The current building was built in the 19th century, and\nwas influenced by Gothic Revival architecture. [http://www.fodors.com/world/africa-and-middle-\neast/egypt/cairo/review-470735.html Review of the Mosque]\n\nThe Mosque houses some very sacred items like the oldest believed complete\nmanuscript of the Quran. [http://www.islamic-\nawareness.org/Quran/Text/Mss/hussein.html Restoration of the First Quran]\n\nThere is a marble slab on the mosque which contains the hadith in which the\nProphet Muhammad says: \"Husain is from me and I am from Husain. May Allah love\nwhoever loves Husain. Husain is a grandson (chief) from the grandsons\n(chieftains).\" At the bottom of the slab, it says this is a good (hasan) hadith\nrelated by Tirmidhi, and also related by Bukhari and Ahmad ibn Hanbal.\n\n==History of transfer of the head of Husayn to Cairo in Fatimid belief Brief\n=History of Transfer of the Sacred Head of Hussain ibn Ali, From Damascus to\n=Ashkelon to Qahera By:\nQazi Dr. Shaikh Abbas Borhany PhD (USA), NDI, Shahadat al Aâalamiyyah (Najaf,\nIraq), M.A., LLM (Shariah) Member, Ulama Council of Pakistan , Published in\nDaily News, Karachi, Pakistan on 3 January 2009. ==\n\n\n\nIt was the 15th Fatimid/Ismaili/Dawoodi Bohra Imam Abu Mansoor Nizar al-Aziz\nBillah (d.386 AH/996) who traced the site of the head of his great-grandfather\nthrough the office of his contemporary in Baghdad, in 985. In the city of\nAshkelon, Israel, it remained buried at \"Baab al Faradis\", for a long time\n(about 250 years up to 1153).\n\nAfter the 21st Fatimid Imam At-Tayyib Abi l-Qasim went into seclusion, his\nuncle, Abd al Majid occupied the throne of the Fatimid Empire. Fearing\ndisrespect and the atrocities of the traitors and enemies, the Majidi-monarch,\nAl-Zafir, ordered the transfer of the head to Qahera. The Wâali of the city of\nAshkelon, Al Amir Sayf al Mamlaka Tamim along with the custodian of the Mashhad,\nQazi Mohammad bin Miskin, took out the buried casket of Raas al Imam al Husayn\nfrom the Mashhad, and with due respect and great reverence, on Sunday 8 Jumada\nal-Thani, 548 (31 August 1153) carried the head from the city of Ashkelon to\nQahera, Egypt. Syedi Hasan bin Asad (Hirâaz, Yemen) discussed this event in his\nRisalah manuscript as follows: \"When the Raas (head) al Imam al Husain was taken\nout of the casket, in Ashkelon, drops of the fresh blood were visible on the\nRaas al Imam al Husain and the fragrance of Musk spread all over.\"\n\nHistorians, Al-Maqrizi, Ahmad al-Qalqashandi, and Ibn Muyassar (d.1278) have\nmentioned that the casket reached Qahera on Tuesday 10 Jumada al-Thani (2\nSeptember 1153). Ustâad Maknun accompanied it in one of the service boats which\nlanded at the Kafuri (Garden). Buried there in the place known \"Qubbat al\nDaylam\" or \"Turbat al Zafrâan\" (currently known as \"Al Mashhad al Husain\",\nwherein lie buried underground thirteen Fatimid Imams from 9th Muhammad at-Taqi\nto 20th Al-Amir bi-Ahkami l-Lah). This place is also known as \"Bâab Makhallifâat\nal Rasul\".\n\nThe famous Mamluk historian of Egypt, Mohiyuddin Abd al Zahir (d. 1292) wrote:\nWhen Salahuddin came to power he seized all the Palaces of the\nAimmat Fatemiyeen and looted their properties and treasures. He destroyed the\nvaluable and rare collection of the hundred thousands books, available in\nlibraries, in the river Nile. When he learnt through his intelligence.. that one\nof the.. custodians of Raas al Imam al Husain.. was highly respected by the\npeople of ..Qahera, he surmised that perhaps he .. be aware of ..treasures of\nthe Aimmat Fatemiyeen. Salahuddin issued orders to present him in his court. He\ninquired of him ..of the Fatemi..treasures. The nobleman flatly denied ..about\nthe treasures. Salahuddin was angered, and ordered his intelligence .. to ask\nhim through 'third-degree-torture', but the nobleman bore ..torture and repeated\n..statement. .. Salahuddin ordered his soldiers to put a cap containing\nCentipedes on the head of the nobleman. ..such type of punishment was so severe\nand unbearable..none could survive even for a few minutes.\n\nPrior to putting the Cap of Centipedes on the head, his hair was shaved, to make\nit easy for the Centipedes to suck blood, which in turn made holes in skull.\nBut! In spite of that punishment the noble custodian of Husain's Head..felt no\npain at all. Salahuddin ordered for more Centipedes to be put on .. but it could\nnot kill or pain him. Finally Salahuddin Ayyubi ordered for a tight cap full of\nCentipedes .. to accomplish the result. Even this method could not torture or\nkill him. The Ayyubid brutes were greatly astounded further when they saw, on\nremoving the cap, the Centipedes were dead. Salahuddin asked the nobleman to\nreveal the secret of this miracle. The nobleman revealed as follow: \"When Raas\nal Imam al Husain was brought to Qasar, Al Moizziyat al Qahera, he had carried\nthe casket on his head. 'O Salahuddin! This is the secret of my\nsafety.\n\nThe burial place is now also known as Raous (head)-us-Husain, A silver Zarih\n([[Maqsurah]]) is made on the place by Dawoodi Bohra Dai, and the place is\nvisited regularly by all Shia. The presentation of the Maqsurah is also unique\nin the history of loyalty and faithfulness. The Maqsurah of Raas al Imam al\nHusain was originally constructed for the Al Abbas Mosque at Karbala, Iraq. When\nthis Maqsurah reached the mosque of Al-Abbas ibn Ali it would not fit on the\nplace. The size of the Maqsurah and the site of the fitting place differed at\nthe time of fitting, although every technical aspects and measurements of the\nsite were taken into account very precisely. The engineers were astonished, as\nwhat had happened, although every minute detail was handled very professionally.\nThe loyalty of Al-Abbas ibn Ali was also witnessed on that day too, as it had\nbeen witnessed on the day of Aashurah. There a divine guidance came to the\neffect by way of intuition that a sincere, faithful, loyal and devoted brother\ncould not tolerate, that the head of Muhammad's grandson, Husayn, buried in Al\nQahera, Egypt, should be without a Maqsurah, thus how could he accept this gift\nfor himself. Hence even after Shahadat, Al-Abbas ibn Ali paid his tribute to\nHusayn and presented his own Maqsurah for Raas (head) al Imam al Husain. When\nthis above-mentioned Maqsurah was brought from Karbala, Iraq to Al Moizziyat al\nQahera, Egypt, it fitted upon the original position of the grave known as\nMashhad of Raas al Imam al Husain in such a manner, as if it had been fabricated\nfor Raas al Imam al Husain itself.\n","linknr":178,"url":"Al-Hussein_Mosque","recorded":1375087055,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Al-Hussein_Mosque&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Al-Hussein_Mosque&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Kairo_Al_Hussein_Mosque_BW_1.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8b/Kairo_Al_Hussein_Mosque_BW_1.jpg/270px-Kairo_Al_Hussein_Mosque_BW_1.jpg","/wiki/Arabic_language","/wiki/Egyptian_Arabic","/wiki/Romanization_of_Arabic","/wiki/Prefix","/wiki/Honorific","/wiki/Sayyid","/wiki/Mosque","/wiki/Cairo","/wiki/Egypt","/wiki/Khan_El-Khalili","/wiki/Muhammad","/wiki/Husayn_ibn_Ali","/wiki/Fatimid","/wiki/Dawoodi_Bohra","/wiki/Sunni_Islam","/wiki/Shia","/wiki/Husayn_ibn_Ali","/wiki/Imam_Husayn_Mosque","/wiki/Karbala","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Islamic","/wiki/Cairo","/wiki/Fatimid","/wiki/Mausoleum","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Gothic_Revival_architecture","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Quran","#cite_note-4","#cite_note-5","/w/index.php?title=Al-Hussein_Mosque&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/File:Raous-us-Husain,Cairo_.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b1/Raous-us-Husain%2CCairo_.jpg/220px-Raous-us-Husain%2CCairo_.jpg","/wiki/File:Raous-us-Husain,Cairo_.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Ismailism","/wiki/Abu_Mansoor_Nizar_al-Aziz_Billah","/wiki/Baghdad","/wiki/At-Tayyib_Abi_l-Qasim","/wiki/Al-Zafir","/wiki/Jumada_al-Thani","/wiki/Al-Maqrizi","/wiki/Ahmad_al-Qalqashandi","/wiki/Muhammad_at-Taqi_(Ahmed_ibn_Abadullah)","/wiki/Al-Amir_bi-Ahkami_l-Lah","/wiki/Mamluk","/wiki/Nile","/wiki/Maqsurah","/wiki/Al_Abbas_Mosque","/w/index.php?title=Al-Hussein_Mosque&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-1","#cite_ref-2","#cite_ref-3","http://www.fodors.com/world/africa-and-middle-east/egypt/cairo/review-470735.html","#cite_ref-4","http://www.islamic-awareness.org/Quran/Text/Mss/hussein.html","#cite_ref-5","/wiki/Template:Mosques_in_Egypt","/wiki/Template_talk:Mosques_in_Egypt","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Mosques_in_Egypt&action=edit","/wiki/Mosque","/wiki/Egypt","/wiki/File:Al_Azhar1.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/22/Al_Azhar1.jpg/80px-Al_Azhar1.jpg","/wiki/Abu_Haggag_Mosque","/wiki/Mosque_of_Amr_ibn_al-As","/wiki/Aqmar_Mosque","/wiki/Al-Azhar_Mosque","/wiki/Juyushi_Mosque","/wiki/Aqsunqur_Mosque","/wiki/Al-Hakim_Mosque","/wiki/Lulua_Mosque","/wiki/Mosque_of_Ibn_Tulun","/wiki/Mosque_of_Muhammad_Ali","/wiki/El-Mursi_Abul_Abbas_Mosque","/wiki/Al-Rifa%27i_Mosque","/wiki/Salar_and_Sangar_al-Gawali_Mosque","/wiki/Al-Salih_Tala%27i_Mosque","/wiki/Mosque-Madrassa_of_Sultan_Hassan","/wiki/Qala%27un_Mosque","/wiki/Sidi_Arif_Mosque","/wiki/File:Flag_of_Egypt.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/Flag_of_Egypt.svg/90px-Flag_of_Egypt.svg.png","/wiki/Category:Mosques_in_Egypt","/wiki/Islam_in_Egypt","/wiki/Category:Mosques_by_country","/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system","//tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Al-Hussein_Mosque&params=30_2_52_N_31_15_47_E_type:landmark","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Al_Hussein_Mosque","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Al-Hussein_Mosque&oldid=562299835","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Mosques_in_Cairo","/wiki/Category:Arabic_architecture","/wiki/Category:Gothic_Revival_architecture_in_Egypt","/wiki/Category:Articles_containing_Arabic-language_text","/wiki/Category:Articles_containing_non-English-language_text","/wiki/Category:Commons_category_with_local_link_same_as_on_Wikidata","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Al-Hussein+Mosque&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Al-Hussein+Mosque","/wiki/Al-Hussein_Mosque","/wiki/Talk:Al-Hussein_Mosque","#","/wiki/Al-Hussein_Mosque","/w/index.php?title=Al-Hussein_Mosque&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Al-Hussein_Mosque&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured
