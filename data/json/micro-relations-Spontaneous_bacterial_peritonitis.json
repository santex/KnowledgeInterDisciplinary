It occurs almost exclusively in\npeople with portal hypertension (increased pressure over the portal vein),\nusually as a result of cirrhosis of the liver. It can\nalso occur in patients with nephrotic syndrome.\n\nThe diagnosis of SBP requires paracentesis (aspiration of fluid with a needle)\nfrom the abdominal cavity. If the fluid contains\nbacteria or large numbers of neutrophil granulocytes (>250 cells/ÂµL) (a type of\nwhite blood cells), infection is confirmed and antibiotics are required to avoid\ncomplications. In addition to antibiotics, infusions of albumin are usually\nadministered.\n","linknr":486,"url":"Spontaneous_bacterial_peritonitis","recorded":1362675940,"links":20,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.annals.org/content/60/4/568.full.pdf","http://www.annals.org/content/60/4/568.full.pdf"],"categories":["Peritoneum disorders"],"headings":["Symptoms","Pathogenesis","Diagnosis","Treatment","Prevention/screening","Epidemiology","History","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Peritonitis","Infection","Abdominal_cavity","Portal_hypertension","Cirrhosis","Liver","Nephrotic_syndrome","Paracentesis","Bacteria","Neutrophil_granulocyte","Antibiotic","Albumin","Fevers","Chills","Nausea","Vomiting","Abdominal_tenderness","Malaise","Ascites","Hepatic_encephalopathy","Paracentesis","Bacteremia","Blood","Immune_system","Complement_system","Neutrophil","Reticuloendothelial_systems","Paracentesis","Neutrophil","Cefotaxime","Ceftriaxone","Ascites","Randomized_controlled_trial","Esophageal_varices"]}
