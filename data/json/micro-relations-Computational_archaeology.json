As with other sub-\ndisciplines that have prefixed 'computational' to their name (e.g. computational\nbiology, computational physics and computational sociology), the term is\nreserved for (generally mathematical) methods that could not realistically be\nperformed without the aid of a computer.\n\nComputational archaeology may include the use of geographical information\nsystems (GIS), especially when applied to spatial analyses such as viewshed\nanalysis and least-cost path analysis as these approaches are sufficiently\ncomputationally complex that they are extremely difficult if not impossible to\nimplement without the processing power of a computer. Likewise, some forms of\nstatistical and mathematical modelling, and the computer simulation of human\nbehaviour and behavioural evolution using software tools such as Swarm or Repast\nwould also be impossible to calculate without computational aid. The application\nof a variety of other forms of complex and bespoke software to solve\narchaeological problems, such as human perception and movement within built\nenvironments using software such as University College London's Space Syntax\nprogram, also falls under the term 'computational archaeology'.\n\n'Computational archaeology' is also known as 'archaeological informatics'\n(Burenhult 2002, Huggett and Ross 2004) or 'archaeoinformatics' (sometimes\nabbreviated as \"AI\", but not to be confused with artificial intelligence).\n","linknr":199,"url":"Computational_archaeology","recorded":1362673729,"links":16,"instances":["knowledge","modelling_toolkit","archaeology","archaeology","statistics","simulation","science"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Archaeological sub-disciplines","Digital humanities"],"headings":["Origins and objectives","Training and research","Employment opportunities","See also","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["swarm","simulation"],["repast","modelling_toolkit"],["sampling","statistics"],["artifact","archaeology"],["process","science"],["excavation","archaeology"],["intuition","knowledge"],["excavation","archaeology"]],"members":["intuition","repast","excavation","artifact","sampling","swarm","process"],"related":["Computational_biology","Computational_physics","Computational_sociology","Geographic_information_system","Spatial_analyses","Viewshed","Least-cost_path","Statistical","Mathematical","Mathematical_model","Computer_simulation","Human_behaviour","Behavioural_evolution","Swarm_(simulation)","Repast_(Modelling_toolkit)","University_College_London","Space_Syntax","Artificial_intelligence","Archaeologists","Quantitative_research","Information_processing","Software","Scientific","Processual_archaeology","Algorithms","Data_structures","Inference","Fuzzy_measure_theory","Uncertainty","Sampling_(statistics)","Statistics","Bayesian_analysis","Probability","Fuzzy_measure_theory","Uncertainty","GIS_in_archaeology","Stratigraphy","Artifact_(archaeology)","Visibility_analysis","Archaeological_field_survey","Process_(science)","Simulation","Predictive_modeling","Heritage_management","Scientific_classification","Artificial_intelligence","Excavation_(archaeology)","Virtual_reality","Interdisciplinary","Computer_science","Database","Geoinformation","Geostatistics","Geographic_information_systems","Artificial_intelligence","Fuzzy_logic","Ecology","Applied_mathematics","Graph_theory","Probability_theory","Statistics","Quantification","Intuition_(knowledge)","Algebra","Statistics","Algorithms","Cognitive","Inference","Geophysics","Geoinformation","Humanistic","Excavation_(archaeology)","Heritage_management"]}
