He later held estates at Piercetown, near Dunboyne, County Meath.\nHe was at Lincoln's Inn 1503-6 and became Serjeant in 1509.\n\nFinglas was appointed Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer by Henry VIII in 1520,\nand afterwards, by patent dated at Westminster 8 May 1534  Mary Ann Lyons\n'Finglas, Patrick', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University\nPress, 2004 [accessed 21 December\n2011:http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/9458]  he was constituted Lord\nChief Justice of the King's Bench for Ireland in the place of Sir Bartholomew\nDillon.

He was a\nmember of the Privy Council of Ireland.\n\nHe wrote 'A Breviat of the getting of Ireland, and of the Decaie of the\nsame.' Printed in Harris's 'Hibernica,' edit. 1770, i. 79-103. It\nappears that the original manucript of this work is in the Public Record Office\nState Papers, Henry VIII, Ireland, vol. xii. art.7. It is described\nin the calendar as An Historical Dissertation on the Conquest of Ireland, the\ndecay of that land, and measures proposed to remedy the grievances thereof\narising from the oppressions of the Irish nobility'.\n\nThe measures proposed included the settlement of Leinster by \"English lords and\ngentlemen \", the securing of castles and other strong places, and more\ncontroversially, the suppression of all monasteries as potential centres of\nrebellion. He did not however urge the expulsion of the native Irish, arguing\nthat they would be a useful element in society if properly governed. Ball,\nF. Elrington The Judges in Ireland 1221-1921 John Murray London 1921 It\nprobably built on an earlier treatise, The Decay of Ireland, by Sir William\nDarcy, the long-serving Vice-Treasurer of Ireland.\n\nFinglas was regarded by the English Crown as one of the principal supports of\nits rule in Ireland; in 1520 the Lord Deputy of Ireland, the Earl of Surrey,\npraised him to Cardinal Wolsey as one of \"the best willed and most diligent to\ndo the King's Grace true and faithful service of all the learned men of this\nland.\" Ball Judges in Ireland\n\nHis daughter and heiress, Genet,
