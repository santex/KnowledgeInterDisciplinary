{"cursor":"16738","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"]]\n\n'Electroplating' is a process that uses electrical current to reduce dissolved\nmetal cations so that they form a coherent metal coating on an electrode. The\nterm is also used for electrical oxidation of anions onto a solid subtrate, as\nin the formation silver chloride on silver wire to make silver/silver-chloride\nelectrodes. Electroplating is primarily used to change the surface properties of\nan object (e.g. abrasion and wear resistance, corrosion protection, lubricity,\naesthetic qualities, etc.), but may also be used to build up thickness on\nundersized parts or to form objects by electroforming.\n\nThe process used in electroplating is called 'electrodeposition'. It is\nanalogous to a galvanic cell acting in reverse. The part to be plated is the\ncathode of the circuit. In one technique, the anode is made of the metal to\nbe plated on the part. Both components are immersed in a solution called an\nelectrolyte containing one or more dissolved metal salts as well as other\nions that permit the flow of electricity. A power supply supplies a direct\ncurrent to the anode, oxidizing the metal atoms that comprise it and allowing\nthem to dissolve in the solution. At the cathode, the dissolved metal ions in\nthe electrolyte solution are reduced at the interface between the solution\nand the cathode, such that they \"plate out\" onto the cathode. The rate at\nwhich the anode is dissolved is equal to the rate at which the cathode is\nplated, vis-a-vis the current flowing through the circuit. In this manner,\nthe ions in the electrolyte bath are continuously replenished by the\nanode. Dufour, IX-1.\n\nOther electroplating processes may use a non-consumable anode such as lead or\ncarbon. In these techniques, ions of the metal to be plated must be periodically\nreplenished in the bath as they are drawn out of the solution. Dufour, IX-2. The most common form of electroplating is used for\ncreating coins such as pennies, which are small zinc plates covered in a layer\nof copper \n","linknr":261,"url":"Electroplating","recorded":1362485549,"links":33,"instances":["chemistry","inventor","chemistry","mechanical"],"pdf":["http://www.tenniselbow.org/scott/feyn_surely.pdf"],"categories":["Metal plating"],"headings":["Process","Effects","History","Use","Hull cell","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/PCB_copper_layer_electroplating_machine.jpg/220px-PCB_copper_layer_electroplating_machine.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/Copper_electroplating.svg/220px-Copper_electroplating.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/6/f/2/6f2d37e0ff541c986e12af862692001a.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/40/Early_Electro-Plating.jpg/220px-Early_Electro-Plating.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/Moritz_Hermann_von_Jacobi_1856.jpg/180px-Moritz_Hermann_von_Jacobi_1856.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Fragment_of_west_barelief_on_St.Isaac_cathedral.jpg/220px-Fragment_of_west_barelief_on_St.Isaac_cathedral.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dc/Hullcell.jpg/220px-Hullcell.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["abrasion","mechanical"],["salt","chemistry"],["valence","chemistry"],["john_wright","inventor"]],"members":["salt","john_wright","valence","abrasion"],"related":["Direct_current","Redox","Cation","Electrode","Redox","Anions","Silver_chloride_electrode","Abrasion_(mechanical)","Corrosion","Lubrication","Electroforming","Galvanic_cell","Electrolytic_cell","Cathode","Anode","Solution","Electrolyte","Salt_(chemistry)","Ion","Power_supply","Direct_current","Anode","Pennies","Zinc","Copper","Oxidation","Valence_(chemistry)","Cation","Anion","Copper","Chemical_element","Alloy","Brass","Solder","Cyanide","Potassium_cyanide","Carbonate","Phosphate","Lacquer","Wax","Nickel","Zinc","Stainless_steel","Electrolytic_cell","Electroless_nickel_plating","Parts_cleaning","ASTM","Tensile_strength","Hardness","Parthian_Battery","Parthian_Battery","Luigi_V._Brugnatelli","Alessandro_Volta","Voltaic_pile","French_Academy_of_Sciences","United_Kingdom","Russia","Printing_press","Electrotyping","Galvanoplastic_sculpture","Russia","Boris_Jacobi","Electrotyping","Galvanoplastic_sculpture","Peter_Bagrationi","Heinrich_Lenz","Vladimir_Odoyevsky","St._Isaac's_Cathedral","Saint_Petersburg","Dome","Cathedral_of_Christ_the_Saviour","Moscow","List_of_tallest_Orthodox_churches","St._Isaac's_Cathedral","Saint_Petersburg","John_Wright_(inventor)","Birmingham","Potassium_cyanide","Electrolyte","George_Elkington","Birmingham","Norddeutsche_Affinerie","Hamburg","Electrochemistry","Tin","Electric_generator","Automotive","Aviation","Chromium_plating","Bronze","Richard_Feynman","Plastics","Rectifier"]}
