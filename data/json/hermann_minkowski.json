He created and developed the geometry of numbers and used\ngeometrical methods to solve problems in number theory, mathematical physics,\nand the theory of relativity.\n\nMinkowski is perhaps best known for his work in relativity, in which he showed\nin 1907 that his former student Albert Einstein's special theory of relativity\n(1905), presented algebraically by Einstein, could also be understood\ngeometrically as a theory of four-dimensional space-time. Einstein himself at\nfirst viewed Minkowski's treatment as a mere mathematical trick, before\neventually realizing that a geometrical view of space-time would be necessary in\norder to complete his own later work in general relativity (1915).\n",
