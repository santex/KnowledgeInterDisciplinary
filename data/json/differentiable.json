The\ngraph of a differentiable function must have a non-vertical tangent line at each\npoint in its domain. As a result, the graph of a differentiable function must be\nrelatively smooth, and cannot contain any breaks, bends, cusps, or any points\nwith a vertical tangent.\n\nMore generally, if x<sub>0</sub> is a point in the domain of a function f, then\nf is said to be 'differentiable atx<sub>0</sub>' if the derivative\nfâ€²(x<sub>0</sub>) exists. This means that the graph of f has a non-vertical\ntangent line at the point (x<sub>0</sub>,&nbsp;f(x<sub>0</sub>)). The function f\nmay also be called 'locally linear' at x<sub>0</sub>, as it can be well\napproximated by a linear function near this point.\n\nFor a function of several real variables, there is no notion of derivative.\nNevertheless the notion of 'differentiable function' is well defined and widely\nused; see Differentiability in higher dimensions, below.\n","title":"Differentiable%20function","headings":["Differentiability and continuity","Differentiability classes","Differentiability in higher dimensions","Differentiability in complex analysis","Differentiable functions on manifolds","See also","References"]},"micro-relation":["1: Calculus","1: Mathematics","1: Real_number","1: Derivative","1: Domain_of_a_function","1: Graph_of_a_function","1: Tangent_line","1: Vertical_tangent","1: Linear_function","1: Function_of_several_real_variables","1: Continuous_function","1: Almost_everywhere","1: Stefan_Banach","1: Meager_set","1: Weierstrass_function","1: Jump_discontinuity","1: Intermediate_value_theorem","1: Second_derivative","1: Smooth_function","1: There_exists","1: Linear_map","1: Partial_derivative","1: Jacobian_matrix","1: Fundamental_increment_lemma","1: Directional_derivative","1: Complex_analysis","1: Holomorphic_function","1: Analytic_function","1: Differentiable_manifold","1: Semi-differentiability","1: Generalizations_of_the_derivative"]}
