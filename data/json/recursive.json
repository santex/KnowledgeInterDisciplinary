The woman in this image holds an object that contains a smaller image of her\nholding an identical object, which in turn contains a smaller image of herself\nholding an identical object, and so forth.]] 'Recursion' is the process of\nrepeating items in a self-similar way. For instance, when the surfaces of two\nmirrors are exactly parallel with each other the nested images that occur are a\nform of infinite recursion. The term has a variety of meanings specific to a\nvariety of disciplines ranging from linguistics to logic. The most common\napplication of recursion is in mathematics and computer science, in which it\nrefers to a method of defining functions in which the function being defined is\napplied within its own definition. Specifically this defines an infinite number\nof instances (function values), using a finite expression that for some\ninstances may refer to other instances, but in such a way that no loop or\ninfinite chain of references can occur. The term is also used more generally to\ndescribe a process of repeating objects in a self-similar way.\n","title":"Recursion","headings":["Formal definitions of recursion","Informal definition","Recursion in language","Recursion in mathematics","Recursion in computer science","The recursion theorem","Bibliography","See also","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["3: Computer_science","2: Linguistics","2: Mathematics","2: Ackermann_function","2: Mathematical_induction","2: Dynamic_programming","2: Factorial","2: Corecursion","1: Self-similarity","1: Logic","1: Parent","1: Ancestor","1: Fibonacci_sequence","1: Natural_number","1: Peano_axioms","1: Fractal","1: Sourdough","1: Maze","1: Noam_Chomsky","1: Natural_language","1: Daniel_Everett","1: Pirahã_language","1: Matryoshka_doll","1: Chess","1: Circular_definition","1: Infinite_regress","1: Glossary","1: Back-of-the-book_index","1: Google","1: Andrew_Plotkin","1: Recursive_acronym","1: PHP","1: GNU_Project","1: Natural_numbers","1: Axiomatic_system","1: Gödel's_incompleteness_theorems","1: Fibonacci_number","1: Proof_by_cases","1: Structural_induction","1: Mathematical_logic","1: Bellman_equation","1: Computer_programming","1: Divide_and_conquer_algorithm","1: Base_case","1: Parser","1: Recurrence_relation","1: Set_theory","1: Golden_Ratio","1: Fibonacci_numbers","1: Catalan_number","1: Interest","1: Tower_of_Hanoi","1: Course-of-values_recursion","1: Digital_infinity","1: Fixed_point_combinator","1: Infinite_loop","1: Infinitism","1: Iterated_function","1: Mise_en_abyme","1: Recursion","1: Self-reference","1: Strange_loop","1: Tail_recursion","1: Tupper's_self-referential_formula","1: Turtles_all_the_way_down"]}
