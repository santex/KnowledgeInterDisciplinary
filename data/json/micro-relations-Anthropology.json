Wolf, Eric (1994)\nPerilous Ideas: Race, Culture, People. [[Current Anthropology]] 35: 1-7.\np.227 The term \"\" is from the Greek anthrÅpos (), \"man\", understood to\nmean humankind or humanity, and [[wiktionary:-logia|-logia]] (-Î»Î¿Î³Î¯Î±),\n\"discourse\" or \"study.\"\n\nSince the work of Franz Boas and BronisÅaw Malinowski in the late 19th and\nearly 20th centuries, anthropology has been distinguished from other\nsocial sciences by its emphasis on in-depth examination of context, cross-\ncultural comparisons, and the importance it places on participant-\nobservation, or long-term, experiential immersion in the area of research.\nCultural anthropology in particular has emphasized cultural relativity,\nholism and the use of findings to frame cultural critiques. Hylland Eriksen, Thomas. (2004) \"What is\nAnthropology\" Pluto. London. p. 79. This has been particularly\nprominent in the United States, from Boas's arguments against 19th-century\nracial ideology, through Margaret Mead's advocacy for gender equality and\nsexual liberation, to current criticisms of post-colonial oppression and\npromotion of multiculturalism. Ethnography is one of its primary methods\nas well as the text that is generated from anthropological fieldwork. On varieties of cultural\nrelativism in anthropology, see Spiro, Melford E. (1987) \"Some Reflections\non Cultural Determinism and Relativism with Special Reference to Emotion\nand Reason,\" in Culture and Human Nature: theoretical papers of Melford E.\nSpiro. Edited by B.

In Europe, the discipline originated as ethnology and\nwas originally defined as the study of social organization in non-state\nsocieties. It was later renamed social anthropology. It is now generally\nreferred to as socio-cultural anthropology in most of Europe, the commonwealth,\nand in the parts of the world that were influenced by the European\ntradition.
