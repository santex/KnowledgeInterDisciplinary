Behavioral ecology emerged from ethology after Niko\nTinbergen (a seminal figure in the study of animal behavior) outlined the four\ncauses of behavior which consist of causation, development, function, and\nphylogeny.\n\nIf an organism has a trait which provides them with a selective advantage (i.e.\nhas an adaptive significance) in a new environment natural selection will likely\nfavor it. This was originally proposed as the theory of natural selection by\nCharles Darwin. Adaptive significance therefore refers to the beneficial\nqualities, in terms of increased survival and reproduction, a trait conveys.\nGenetic differences in individuals lead to behavioral differences that in turn\ndrive differences in adaptation, reproductive success, and ultimately evolution.\n\nIndividuals are always competing with others for limited resources, including\nfood, territories, and mates. Conflict will occur between predators and prey,\nbetween rivals for mates, between siblings, mates, and even between parents and\ntheir offspring.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Behavioral_ecology","recorded":1372152479,"links":[],"instances":["biology","mathematics","animal_behavior","bee","game_theory"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Behavioral ecology|","Subfields of ecology"],"headings":["Competing for resources","Sexual selection","Sexual conflict","Parental care and family conflicts","Mating systems","Social behaviors","Altruism and conflict in social insects","Communication and signalling","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["strategy","game_theory"],["nuptial_gift","animal_behavior"],["fitness","biology"],["fitness","biology"],["drone","bee"],["optimization","mathematics"]],"members":["fitness","optimization","nuptial_gift","drone","strategy"],"related":["Kleptothermy","V-formation","Waggle_dance","Vocal_sac","Stotting","Evolution","Ethology","Ecology","Ethology","Niko_Tinbergen","Tinbergen's_four_questions","Phylogeny","Natural_selection","Charles_Darwin","Evolutionarily_stable_strategy","Game_theory","John_Maynard_Smith","Nash_equilibrium","Evolutionary_game_theory","Strategy_(game_theory)","Frequency_dependent_selection","Territorial_behavior","Golden-winged_Sunbird","White_wagtail","Three-spined_stickleback","Competition","Causality","Natterjack_Toad","Mammal","Bird","Amphibian","Reproductive_success","Sedge_warbler","Male-male_competition","Nuptial_gift_(animal_behavior)","Handicap_principle","Evolutionary_arms_race","Sexual_conflict","Evolutionary_arms_race","Male","Female","Forced_copulation","Sperm_competition","Feral","Fowl","Gallus_gallus","Parental_care","Parental_care","Gestation","Lactation","Marmoset","Osteichthyes","Parental_investment","Robert_Trivers","Game_theory","Evolutionarily_stable_strategies","Great_Tit","Robert_Trivers","Parental_investment","David_Lack","Hymenoptera","Haplodiploidy","Genomic_imprinting","IGF-2","Cross-fostering","Great_Tit","Parental_investment","Galapagos_fur_seal","El_Niño–Southern_Oscillation","Asynchronous","Blue-footed_Booby","Passerine","Promiscuity","Common_Cuckoo","Honeyguides","Cowbirds","Large_blue_butterfly","Monogamy","Polygyny","Polyandry","Promiscuity","Polygamy","Resource","Dispersion","Predation","Social_animal","Competition","Blue-headed_wrasse","Nest","Lek_mating","Predation","Ecology","Lions","Cooperate","Fitness_(biology)","Hamilton's_rule","Reproductive_success","Kinship","Procreate","John_Maynard_Smith","Charles_Darwin","Group_selection","R.A._Fisher","J._B._S._Haldane","W._D._Hamilton","George_R._Price","Parental_investment","Parenting","Offspring","Altruistic","Fitness_(biology)","Coefficient_of_relationship","Inclusive_fitness","Natural_selection","Amoebae","Reed_warbler","Cuckoo","Konrad_Lorenz","Belding's_ground_squirrel","Worker_policing","Spite","Polyembryonic","Bacteriocins","Hymenoptera","Eusociality","Honeypot_ant","Waggle_dance","Haplodiploid","Drone_(bee)","Coefficient_of_relationship","Kin_selection","Hamilton's_rule","Naked_mole-rats","Damaraland_mole_rat","Worker_policing","Relatedness","Haplodiploidy","Hymenoptera","Allozyme","Oophagy","Eusociality","Monogamous","Phylogeny","Firefly","Guianan_Cock-of-the-rock","Lek_mating","Blue-footed_Booby","Deception_in_animals","Zahavi_handicap_principle","Anglerfish","Batesian_mimicry","Autonomous_foraging","Gene-centered_view_of_evolution","Human_behavioral_ecology","Life_history_theory","Marginal_value_theorem","Optimization_(mathematics)","Mating_effort","Parental_effort","Phylogenetic_comparative_methods","Selection","Balancing_selection","Directional_selection","Disruptive_selection","Stabilizing_selection","R/K_selection_theory","Somatic_effort","John_Krebs","John_Krebs"]}
