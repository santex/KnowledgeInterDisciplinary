{"cursor":"4203","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nIn the law of evidence, 'similar fact evidence' (or the 'similar fact\nprinciple') establishes the conditions under which factual evidence of past\nmisconduct of accused can be admitted at trial for the purpose of inferring that\nthe accused committed the misconduct at issue.\n\nIn Canada, the rule is established in [[R. v. Handy]], 164 CCC (3d) 481, 2 SCR\n908 (2002):\n\nEvidence of prior bad acts by the accused will be admissible if the prosecution\nsatisfies the judge on a balance of probabilities that, in the context of the\nparticular case, the probative value of the evidence in relation to a specific\nissue outweighs its potential prejudice and thereby justifies its reception.\n\nQuestions arise as to how the Court will measure the elements of this rule:\n\n  i) What constitutes a prior act of misconduct?\n- Any past misdeed, does not have to proven as a conviction.\n\n ii) Why does the Court speak of evidence in relation to a âspecific issueâ?\n- Good measure of probity, what other issue beyond disposition or\n  propensity evidence.\n\niii) How is probative value determined?\n- Nature of similarity between details, distinctive features and circumstances\n  of past act and current offence\n- Proximity in time between past act and current offense\n- Number of occurrences of the similar acts\n- Any intervening event\n- Any other factor tending to support or rebut the unity of past act and conduct\n  in question (i.e. appearance of collusion)\n\nThe 2001 trial of Roy Whiting may have influenced the decision to change the law\nin England and Wales (R v Handy continues to govern the law in\nCanada). These changes were brought into force by the 'Bad Character'\nprovisions of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 (sections 98 to 113). Although\npreceding these changes, Rosemary West's 1995 trial has also been cited as an\nexample where similar fact evidence was crucial to the prosecution\ncase.\n\nSimilar fact evidence can be used even if the original \"misconduct\" could not be\nprosecuted due to duress or the offender's youth. In a case of a Devon family\nimprisoned in 1998, one of the defendants appealed his conviction for raping his\nsister at the age of 16, suggesting it was unlikely that she would not complain\nor seek help. It was held that the evidence that his father had coerced him into\nsexual acts with his other sisters as a child was similar fact evidence and, in\naddition to the systematic long-term sexual activity and abuse within the\nfamily, sufficient to explain why he felt that he could get away with abusing\nher and knew she could not rely on her family for protection; his appeal failed.\n[R v TM, 2000, 2 Cr App 266]\n\nUnder Scots law, this is covered by the well-established use of the\nMoorov Doctrine.\n\nUnder Rule 404 of the United States Federal Rules of Evidence, evidence of a\npersonâs character or character trait is not admissible to prove that on a\nparticular occasion the person acted in accordance with the character or trait.\nAdditionally, evidence of a crime, wrong, or other act is not admissible to\nprove a personâs character in order to show that on a particular occasion the\nperson acted in accordance with the character. This evidence may be admissible\nfor another purpose, such as proving motive, opportunity, intent, preparation,\nplan, knowledge, identity, absence of mistake, or lack of accident.\n","linknr":154,"url":"Similar_fact_evidence","recorded":1375086828,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Similar_fact_evidence&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Similar_fact_evidence&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Similar_fact_evidence&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Template:Citation_needed","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/Evidence_(law)","/wiki/Common_law","/wiki/Testimony","/wiki/Documentary_evidence","/wiki/Real_evidence","/wiki/Digital_evidence","/wiki/Exculpatory_evidence","/wiki/Scientific_evidence_(law)","/wiki/Demonstrative_evidence","/wiki/Eyewitness_identification","/wiki/Genetic_fingerprinting","/wiki/Lies_(evidence)","/wiki/Relevance_(law)","/wiki/Legal_burden_of_proof","/wiki/Foundation_(evidence)","/wiki/Public_policy_doctrines_for_the_exclusion_of_relevant_evidence","/wiki/Spoliation_of_evidence","/wiki/Character_evidence","/wiki/Habit_evidence","/wiki/Authentication_(law)","/wiki/Chain_of_custody","/wiki/Judicial_notice","/wiki/Best_evidence_rule","/wiki/Self-authenticating_document","/wiki/Ancient_document","/wiki/Hague_Evidence_Convention","/wiki/Witness","/wiki/Competence_(law)","/wiki/Privilege_(evidence)","/wiki/Direct_examination","/wiki/Cross-examination","/wiki/Redirect_examination","/wiki/Witness_impeachment","/wiki/Recorded_recollection","/wiki/Expert_witness","/wiki/Dead_Man%27s_Statute","/wiki/Hearsay","/wiki/Hearsay_in_English_law","/wiki/Hearsay_in_United_States_law","/wiki/Confession_(legal)","/wiki/Business_records_exception","/wiki/Excited_utterance","/wiki/Dying_declaration","/wiki/Party_admission","/wiki/Ancient_document","/wiki/Declaration_against_interest","/wiki/Present_sense_impression","/wiki/Res_gestae","/wiki/Learned_treatise","/wiki/Implied_assertion","/wiki/Common_law","/wiki/Contract","/wiki/Tort","/wiki/Property_law","/wiki/Will_(law)","/wiki/Trusts_and_estates","/wiki/Criminal_law","/wiki/Template:Evidence_law","/wiki/Template_talk:Evidence_law","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Evidence_law&action=edit","/wiki/Evidence","/wiki/R._v._Handy","/wiki/Case_citation","/wiki/Roy_Whiting","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Criminal_Justice_Act_2003","/wiki/Rosemary_West","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Scots_law","/wiki/Moorov_v_HMA","/w/index.php?title=Similar_fact_evidence&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/low/england/1706334.stm","#cite_ref-2","http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/law-obituaries/6006003/Richard-Ferguson-QC.html","http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/2002/2002scc56/2002scc56.html","http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/1999/2041.html","/w/index.php?title=Similar_fact_evidence&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Doctrine_of_chances","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Similar_fact_evidence&oldid=538199963","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Evidence_law","/wiki/Category:Articles_needing_additional_references_from_February_2008","/wiki/Category:All_articles_needing_additional_references","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Similar+fact+evidence&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Similar+fact+evidence","/wiki/Similar_fact_evidence","/wiki/Talk:Similar_fact_evidence","#","/wiki/Similar_fact_evidence","/w/index.php?title=Similar_fact_evidence&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Similar_fact_evidence&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Similar_fact_evidence","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked
