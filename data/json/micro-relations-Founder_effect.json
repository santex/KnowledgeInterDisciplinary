{"cursor":"17231","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\nIn population genetics, the 'founder effect' is the loss of genetic variation\nthat occurs when a new population is established by a very small number of\nindividuals from a larger population. It was first fully outlined by Ernst Mayr\nin 1942, using existing theoretical work by those such as Sewall\nWright. As a result of the loss of genetic variation, the new\npopulation may be distinctively different, both genetically and phenotypically,\nfrom the parent population from which it is derived. In extreme cases, the\nfounder effect is thought to lead to the speciation and subsequent evolution of\nnew species.\n\nIn the figure shown, the original population has nearly equal numbers of blue\nand red individuals. The three smaller founder populations show that one or the\nother color may predominate (founder effect), due to random sampling of the\noriginal population. A population bottleneck may also cause a founder effect\neven though it is not strictly a new population.\n\nThe founder effect is a special case of genetic drift.

This can be observed in the limited gene pool\nof Iceland, Faroe Islands, Easter Islanders and those native to Pitcairn Island.\nAnother example is the legendarily high deaf population of Martha's Vineyard,\nwhich resulted in the development of Martha's Vineyard Sign Language.\n","linknr":336,"url":"Founder_effect","recorded":1362483539,"links":39,"instances":["genetics","population_genetics"],"pdf":["http://www.ias.ac.in/jgenet/Vol88No1/127.pdf","http://www.ias.ac.in/jgenet/Vol88No1/127.pdf"],"categories":["Ecology","Population genetics","Evolutionary biology","Mutation"],"headings":["Founder mutation","General","Serial founder effect","Founder effects in island ecology","Founder effects in human populations","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c7/Founder_effect.png/220px-Founder_effect.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["fixation","population_genetics"],["dominance","genetics"]],"members":["dominance","fixation"],"related":["Population_genetics","Ernst_Mayr","Sewall_Wright","Genotype","Phenotype","Speciation","Evolution","Population_bottleneck","Genetic_drift","Small_population_size","Inbreeding","Genetic_variation","Gene_pool","Icelanders","Faroe_Islanders","Easter_Island","Pitcairn_Island","Martha's_Vineyard","Martha's_Vineyard_Sign_Language","Genetics","Mutation","DNA","Chromosome","Haplotype","Genetic_recombination","Allele","Fixation_(population_genetics)","Dominance_(genetics)","Homozygous","Genetic_divergence","Genetic_distance","Genotype","Phenotype","Speciation","Sewall_Wright","Shifting_balance_theory","Ernst_Mayr","Recent_African_origin_of_modern_humans","Island_biogeography","Island_ecology","Krakatoa","Surtsey","Iceland","Toba_catastrophe_theory","Before_Present","Nicobar_Islands","Andaman_Islands","Biodiversity","Genetic_recombination","Bering_land_bridge","Ice_age","Mitochondrial_Eve","Endogamy","Amish","United_States","Polydactyly","Ellis-van_Creveld_syndrome","Fumarase_deficiency","Fundamentalist_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter_Day_Saints","Endogamy","Polygyny","John_Y._Barlow","Joseph_Smith_Jessop","Tristan_da_Cunha","Retinitis_pigmentosa","Cleidocranial_dysostosis","Ashkenazi_Jews","Tay-Sachs_disease","Medical_genetics_of_Ashkenazi_Jews","Small_population_size","Cousin_marriage","Popular_sire_effect"]}
