{"cursor":"7186","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Francis Storer Eaton Newall, 2nd Baron Newall' DL (born 23 June 1930, in\nSurrey, England) is the son of Marshal of the Royal Air Force and Governor-\nGeneral of New Zealand Sir Cyril Newall and his wife Olivia, and has served as a\nsoldier, staff officer, diplomat, politician, legislator, businessman, and\nrepresentative of the Crown in a variety of capacities.\n\nNewall resided in his family's Surrey home before leaving for Cairo upon his\nfather's appointment as Air Officer Commanding Middle East. There he remained\nfor four years, returning again to Surrey from 1935 to 1941, at which point he\nand his family were moved to New Zealand following Sir Cyril's appointment as\nGovernor-General. Unlike the rest of his family, he only remained two years: in\n1943, having matriculated to Eton, he returned home, residing there and with\nstrangers and friends of his parents from then through the end of the war and,\nsubsequently, that of his father's term in 1946.\n\nNewall remained at Eton through 1948, when he volunteered for Army service and\nwas accepted to the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst. He remained there until\nsuccessfully completing the course in the middle of 1950, at which point\n(following further gunnery training) he joined the 11th Hussars, then stationed\nwith the British Army of the Rhine in OsnabrÃ¼ck, Germany. He served there and at\nWesendorf for three years, commanding an armoured cavalry troop and being\npromoted Lieutenant in 1952 before the 11th was transferred to Malaysia (then-\nBritish Malaya) in 1953 to combat the increasingly powerful Communist insurgency\nthere (see Malayan Emergency). During his service there, he served in a variety\nof roles, including intelligence, domestic pacification, and aide-de-camp to\nGeneral Sir Charles Loewen, Commander-in-Chief Far East Land Forces. In 1956 he\nwas promoted Captain and returned to Britain as adjutant to the Royal\nGloucestershire Hussars, and served in a variety of roles thereafter until his\n1961 retirement following contraction of jaundice in Omagh, Northern Ireland.\n\nAt this point, Newall entered the business world. He joined Arthur Guinness &\nSon and subsequently helped found Harp Lager. During this time he acceded to the\npeerage following his father's death in 1963, assuming his seat in the House of\nLords as 'the Lord Newall'. He remained with Guinness until 1966,\ntaking a position as public relations spokesmen for Schweppes USA, Ltd, during\nwhich time he took a home in Connecticut. He returned to the UK in 1972 as\nmanaging director for Neilson McCarthy Public Relations, a position he held\nuntil 1975. He has continued to be involved in business since, and presently\nserves as Chairman of Code Circus Ltd, a web application development company.\n\nAt this time Lord Newall began to seriously engage in politics. He took his seat\nas a Conservative member of the Lords shortly following the return to power of\nLabour Prime Minister Harold Wilson, and served as an opposition spokesman and\nwhip from 1976, his tenure ending upon the victory and accession to power of\nMargaret Thatcher. He continued dual involvement in both business and politics\nthrough 1983, at which time he entered continental politics as a delegate to the\nCouncil of Europe and Western European Union. He continued sitting in the Lords,\nholding his seat for a total of thirty-seven years and introducing six private\nmembersâ bills — four of which were passed — as well as making\nhundreds of speeches. Since losing his seat per the expulsion of the hereditary\npeers in the House of Lords Act 1999 he has become Co-Chairman of the Hereditary\nPeerage Association. He has also acted as a representative of the British\nparliament and the WEU on several occasions: notably, during annual visits from\n1986 through 1993 to Romania, which included private meetings with President\nNicolae CeauÅescu and members of his government; and, more recently, in\nAzerbaijan.\n\nLord Newall also takes active interests in both sports and charity work. He\nserved for twelve years as chairman of the British Greyhound Racing Board and\npresident of the World Greyhound Racing Association. He has been president of\nSPANA (Society for the Protection of Animals Abroad), chairman of the Lord\nBarnby Charitable Association and of the British Moroccan Society, and a\ncommittee member for the Not Forgotten Association, which works to provide\nservices for disabled British servicepeople. He is also honorary president of\nthe Committee for Release of Tindouf Prisoners, which campaigns for the release\nof a great many of the longest-held prisoners in the world who are held in\ndreadful conditions in a concentration camp in Algeria.\n\nLord Newall has three children — daughter Miranda and sons Richard and\nDavid — and seven grandchildren with his wife of fifty three years, Panna.\nThe garden of his home in Buckinghamshire, where he has resided for thirty seven\nyears, is open to the public.\n","linknr":156,"url":"Francis_Newall,_2nd_Baron_Newall","recorded":1374782833,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Francis_Newall,_2nd_Baron_Newall&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Francis_Newall,_2nd_Baron_Newall&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Biographies_of_living_persons","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability","/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources","/wiki/Defamation","/wiki/Deputy_Lieutenant","/wiki/Marshal_of_the_Royal_Air_Force","/wiki/Governor-General_of_New_Zealand","/wiki/Cyril_Newall,_1st_Baron_Newall","/wiki/Soldier","/wiki/Aide-de-camp","/wiki/Diplomat","/wiki/Politician","/wiki/Legislator","/wiki/Businessman","/wiki/Surrey","/wiki/Cairo","/wiki/Eton_College","/wiki/British_Army","/wiki/Royal_Military_Academy_Sandhurst","/wiki/11th_Hussars","/wiki/British_Army_of_the_Rhine","/wiki/Osnabr%C3%BCck","/wiki/Wesendorf","/wiki/Armoured_cavalry","/wiki/Troop","/wiki/Lieutenant","/wiki/Malaysia","/wiki/Federation_of_Malaya","/wiki/Communist","/wiki/Insurgency","/wiki/Malayan_Emergency","/wiki/General","/wiki/Charles_Loewen","/wiki/Captain_(British_Army_and_Royal_Marines)","/wiki/Royal_Gloucestershire_Hussars","/wiki/Jaundice","/wiki/Omagh","/wiki/Northern_Ireland","/wiki/Guinness","/wiki/Harp_Lager","/wiki/House_of_Lords","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Cadbury-Schweppes","/wiki/Connecticut","/w/index.php?title=Neilson_McCarthy_Public_Relations&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Web_application_development","/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)","/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)","/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Harold_Wilson","/wiki/Whip_(politics)","/wiki/Margaret_Thatcher","/wiki/Council_of_Europe","/wiki/Western_European_Union","/wiki/Private_members%E2%80%99_bills","/wiki/House_of_Lords_Act_1999","/wiki/Hereditary_Peerage_Association","/wiki/Romania","/wiki/President_of_Romania","/wiki/Nicolae_Ceau%C5%9Fescu","/wiki/Azerbaijan","/wiki/SPANA_(Society_for_the_Protection_of_Animals_Abroad)","/w/index.php?title=Richard_Newall&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Buckinghamshire","/w/index.php?title=Francis_Newall,_2nd_Baron_Newall&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/courant/access/949790542.html?dids=949790542:949790542&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI&type=historic&date=Aug+24%2C+1969&author=&pub=Hartford+Courant&desc=His+Lordship's+Peerless+Poise+Aids+a+Cool+Head+for+Business&pqatl=google","/wiki/Hartford_Courant","/w/index.php?title=Francis_Newall,_2nd_Baron_Newall&action=edit&section=2","http://www.codecircus.co.uk/","/wiki/Peerage_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Cyril_Louis_Norton_Newall,_1st_Baron_Newall","/wiki/Baron_Newall","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Francis_Newall,_2nd_Baron_Newall&oldid=502008349","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1930_births","/wiki/Category:Conservative_Party_(UK)_peers","/wiki/Category:Hereditary_peers_removed_from_the_House_of_Lords_under_the_Act_1999","/wiki/Category:11th_Hussars_officers","/wiki/Category:Conservative_Party_(UK)_MEPs","/wiki/Category:Barons_in_the_Peerage_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Category:People_educated_at_Eton_College","/wiki/Category:Living_people","/wiki/Category:Royal_Gloucestershire_Hussars_officers","/wiki/Category:Graduates_of_the_Royal_Military_Academy_Sandhurst","/wiki/Category:British_Army_personnel_of_the_Malayan_Emergency","/wiki/Category:BLP_articles_lacking_sources_from_May_2012","/wiki/Category:Use_dmy_dates_from_April_2012","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Francis+Newall%2C+2nd+Baron+Newall&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Francis+Newall%2C+2nd+Baron+Newall","/wiki/Francis_Newall,_2nd_Baron_Newall","/wiki/Talk:Francis_Newall,_2nd_Baron_Newall","#","/wiki/Francis_Newall,_2nd_Baron_Newall","/w/index.php?title=Francis_Newall,_2nd_Baron_Newall&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Francis_Newall,_2nd_Baron_Newall&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Po
