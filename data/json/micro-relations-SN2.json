Thus the incoming group replaces\nthe leaving group in one step. Since two reacting species are involved in the\nslow, rate-determining step of the reaction, this leads to the name\n'bi'molecular'n'ucleophilic's'ubstitution, or S N2. Among inorganic\nchemists, the S N2 reaction is often known as the interchange\nmechanism.\n","linknr":239,"url":"SN2","recorded":1362581620,"links":31,"instances":["biochemistry","chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Substitution reactions","Reaction mechanisms"],"headings":["Reaction mechanism","Factors affecting the rate of the reaction","Reaction kinetics","E2 competition","Roundabout mechanism","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/97/SN2-MeSH-MeI-montage-3D-balls.png/220px-SN2-MeSH-MeI-montage-3D-balls.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b6/SN2-TS.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f9/BromoethaneSN2reaction-small.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/39/SN2E2gasphasecompetition.png/400px-SN2E2gasphasecompetition.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["chirality","chemistry"],["substrate","biochemistry"]],"members":["substrate","chirality"],"related":["Methanethiol","Iodomethane","Nucleophilic_substitution","Nucleophile","Electrophile","Covalent_bond","Leaving_group","Rate-determining_step","Chemical_reaction","Aliphatic","Orbital_hybridisation","Electronegative","Halide","Transition_state","Coordination_number","Orbital_hybridisation","Leaving_group","Chirality_(chemistry)","Stereochemistry","Walden_inversion","Hydroxide","Bromoethane","Ethanol","Bromide","Steric_hindrance","Substituent","Substrate_(biochemistry)","Reaction_mechanism","Primary_carbon","SN1_reaction","SN1_reaction","Carbocation","Coordination_chemistry","Associative_substitution","Steric_effects","Methoxide","Potassium_tert-butoxide","Electronegativity","Tetrahydrofuran","Protic_solvent","Hydrogen_bond","Tosyl","Second_order_reaction","Rate-determining_step","Reaction_rate","Protic_solvent","Steric_effects","Ion_pair","Side_reaction","Elimination_reaction","Alkene","Sulfonate","Alkyl_halide","Mass_spectrometer","Acc._Chem._Res.","Electrospray_ionization","Sulfonate","Ethyl_bromide","Steric_hindrance","Isobutyl","Benzoate","Solvent_effects","Methyl_iodide","Chemical_&_Engineering_News","Substitution_reaction","SN1_reaction","SNi","Nucleophilic_aromatic_substitution","Nucleophilic_acyl_substitution","Neighbouring_group_participation","Finkelstein_reaction","Christopher_Kelk_Ingold","Arrow_pushing"]}
