For\nexample, during the 1973 oil crisis, Americans were allowed to purchase gasoline\nonly on odd-numbered days if their license plate was odd, and on even-numbered\ndays if their license plate was even. The system was well-defined and not random\nin its restrictions; however, since license plate numbers are completely\nunrelated to a person's fitness to purchase gasoline, it was still an arbitrary\ndivision of people. Similarly, schoolchildren are often organized by their\nsurname in alphabetical order, a non-random yet still arbitrary method, at least\nin cases where surnames are irrelevant.\n","title":"Arbitrariness","headings":["Law","Philosophy","Mathematics","See also","References"]},"micro-relation":["1: Random","1: 1973_oil_crisis","1: Surname","1: Constitution","1: Swiss_Federal_Constitution","1: Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States","1: Rational_basis_review","1: Refugee_roulette","1: Teleology","1: Nihilism","1: Theism","1: Deity","1: Argument_from_design","1: Ethics","1: Rationalism","1: Permutation","1: Even_and_odd_numbers","1: Randomness"]}
