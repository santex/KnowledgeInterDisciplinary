After leaving Robert Lightbourne High School,\nwhere he was a member of the cadet corp, he then became a police cadet and later\nenlisted in the Jamaica Constabulary Force (JCF).\n\nIn 1985, he migrated to the United States and enlisted in the Armed Forces on 18\nMay 1988 after acquiring legal resident status in February 1988. A 1996 graduate\nof South Florida State College, he earned an associate's degree in computer\nprogramming. In August 1996, as part of a negotiated plea agreement with the\nState of Florida and his attorney-at-law, Brown pleaded \"no contest\" to a charge\nof aggravated battery which stems from a domestic dispute and was placed on two\nyears probation. The presiding judge withheld the adjudication based on his\nstatus in the community. In August 1998, the probation was extended to August\n2001 in order to satisfy the monetary part of the condition of the\nprobation.\n\nOn 30 September 1996, the US Congress passed and newly re-elected US President\nBill Clinton signed into law the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant\nResponsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA), which lessened the chances of non-US\ncitizens with certain kinds of convictions to remain in the country. An\namendment to the IIRIRA categorized probation \"as a sentence and a final order\nof conviction for deportation or removal purposes\", so he was \"deportable\".\nHowever, in 2001, the US Supreme Court in INS v St. Cyr, ruled that non-US\ncitizens with convictions that occurred as a result of plea-agreements and who\nwere not deportable at the time of the offence based on the law then in effect\nshould be allowed to file \"cancellation of removal\" petitions in an effort to\nremain in the country.\n\nOn 5 January 2001, Brown was convicted on one count of resisting arrest without\nviolence by a jury, and sentenced to 9 months in jail. As a result of the\nconviction, Highlands County Circuit Judge J.D. Langford revoked the probation.\nBrown was sentenced to a maximum term of 46 months in prison, but was released\nafter 24 months due to good conduct. He was handed over to the Immigration and\nCustoms Enforcement. After appearing before an immigration judge in September\n2003, the judge ordered Brown deported to his native Jamaica. Brown was deported\non 24 January 2004 after spending a total of 19 years in the United States,\naltogether. Despite Brown's military service, he had never applied for\nnaturalization, making him eligible for deportation as a non US-citizen.\n\nBrown is the author of The Jamaican Deportees....we are displaced, desperate,\ndamaged, rich, resourceful, or dangerous.... Who am I? (ISBN 13: 9781467040358)\n\nBrown has five children. He resides in Jamaica, and writes frequent published\narticles to the editor of the [[Daily Gleaner]] and the [[Jamaica\nObserver]].\n","linknr":125,"url":"Charles_Hopel_Brown","recorded":1375074286,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Charles_Hopel_Brown&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Charles_Hopel_Brown&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Charles_Hopel_Brown&action=edit","/wiki/Talk:Charles_Hopel_Brown","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Autobiography","/wiki/Wikipedia:NPOV","/wiki/Talk:Charles_Hopel_Brown","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/Unbalanced_scales.svg/45px-Unbalanced_scales.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view","/wiki/Wikipedia:NPOV_dispute","/wiki/Talk:Charles_Hopel_Brown#.23","/wiki/Wikipedia:NPOVD#What_is_an_NPOV_dispute.3F","/wiki/Morant_Bay","/wiki/Saint_Thomas_Parish,_Jamaica","/wiki/Jamaica_Constabulary_Force","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/South_Florida_State_College","/wiki/Computer_programming","/wiki/Attorney-at-law","/wiki/Adjudication","#cite_note-1","#cite_note-2","/wiki/US_Congress","/wiki/Bill_Clinton","/wiki/Illegal_Immigration_Reform_and_Immigrant_Responsibility_Act_of_1996","/wiki/Conviction","/wiki/Deportation","/wiki/US_Supreme_Court","/wiki/Resisting_arrest","/wiki/Probation","/wiki/Military","/wiki/Naturalization","/wiki/Deportation","/wiki/Daily_Gleaner","/wiki/Jamaica_Observer","#cite_note-3","/w/index.php?title=Charles_Hopel_Brown&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20071203/news/news1.html","#cite_ref-2","http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20071210/news/news1.html","#cite_ref-3","https://www.jamaicaobserver.com/news/deportee------MONDAY--Nov-29","/w/index.php?title=Charles_Hopel_Brown&action=edit&section=2","http://bookstore.authorhouse.com/Products/SKU-000483543/THE-JAMAICAN-DEPORTEES.aspx","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Charles_Hopel_Brown&oldid=544063055","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1964_births","/wiki/Category:Living_people","/wiki/Category:People_deported_from_the_United_States","/wiki/Category:Jamaican_writers","/wiki/Category:Jamaican_criminals","/wiki/Category:Jamaican_police_officers","/wiki/Category:Jamaican_emigrants_to_the_United_States","/wiki/Category:People_from_Saint_Thomas_Parish,_Jamaica","/wiki/Category:Autobiographical_articles_from_December_2012","/wiki/Category:NPOV_disputes_from_December_2012","/wiki/Category:All_NPOV_disputes","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Charles+Hopel+Brown&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Charles+Hopel+Brown","/wiki/Charles_Hopel_Brown","/wiki/Talk:Charles_Hopel_Brown","#","/wiki/Charles_Hopel_Brown","/w/index.php?title=Charles_Hopel_Brown&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Charles_Hopel_Brown&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Charles_Hopel_Brown","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Charles_Hopel_Brown","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Charles_Hopel_Brown&oldid=544063055","/w/index.php?title=Charles_Hopel_Brown&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5079118","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Charles_Hopel_Brown&id=544063055","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Charles+Hopel+Brown","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Charles+Hopel+Brown&oldid=544063055&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Charles_Hopel_Brown&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5079118#siteli
