Carotenoids can be produced from fats and other basic\norganic metabolic building blocks by all these organisms. Carotenoids generally\ncannot be manufactured by species in the animal kingdom so animals obtain\ncarotenoids in their diets, and may employ them in various ways in metabolism.\n\nThere are over 600 known carotenoids; they are split into two classes,\nxanthophylls (which contain oxygen) and carotenes (which are purely\nhydrocarbons, and contain no oxygen). All carotenoids are tetraterpenoids,\nmeaning that they are produced from 8 isoprene molecules and contain 40 carbon\natoms. Carotenoids in general absorb blue light. They serve two key roles in\nplants and algae: they absorb light energy for use in photosynthesis, and they\nprotect chlorophyll from photodamage. In humans, four carotenoids (beta-\ncarotene, alpha-carotene, gamma-carotene, and beta-cryptoxanthin) have vitamin A\nactivity (meaning they can be converted to retinal), and these and other\ncarotenoids can also act as antioxidants. In the eye, certain other carotenoids\n(lutein, astaxanthin and zeaxanthin) apparently act directly to\nabsorb damaging blue and near-ultraviolet light, in order to protect the macula\nof the retina, the part of the eye with the sharpest vision.\n\nPeople consuming diets rich in carotenoids from natural foods, such as fruits\nand vegetables, are healthier and have lower mortality from a number of chronic\nillnesses.

It is known that\ntaking Î²-carotene supplements is harmful for smokers, and the meta-analysis of\nBjelakovic et al. was influenced by inclusion of these studies. See the [http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/extract/298/4/401-\na letter] to JAMA by Philip Taylor and Sanford Dawsey and the [http://jama.ama-\nassn.org/cgi/content/extract/298/4/402 reply] by the authors of the original\npaper.  With the notable exception of the gac fruit and crude palm oil,\nmost carotenoid-rich fruits and vegetables are low in lipids. Since dietary\nlipids have been hypothesized to be an important factor for carotenoid\nbioavailability, a 2005 study investigated whether addition of avocado fruit or\noil, as lipid sources, would enhance carotenoid absorption in humans. The study\nfound that the addition of both avocado fruit and oil significantly enhanced the\nsubjects' absorption of all carotenoids tested (Î±-carotene, Î²-carotene,\nlycopene, and lutein).\n","linknr":478,"url":"Carotenoids","recorded":1362375585,"links":49,"instances":["carotenoid"],"pdf":["http://www.altmedrev.com/publications/16/4/355.pdf","http://www.altmedrev.com/publications/16/4/355.pdf","http://media.iupac.org/publications/pac/1991/pdf/6301x0131.pdf"],"categories":["Bioindicators","Carotenoids|","Photosynthesis"],"headings":["Properties","Physiological effects","Aroma chemicals","Disease","Naturally occurring carotenoids","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f5/Grand_prismatic_spring.jpg/220px-Grand_prismatic_spring.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/Carotenoid.svg/250px-Carotenoid.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["neochrome","carotenoid"]],"members":["neochrome"],"related":["Algae","Bacteria","Organic_compound","Pigment","Chloroplast","Chromoplast","Photosynthesis","Organism","Algae","Bacteria","Fungi","Animalia","Xanthophyll","Carotene","Tetraterpenoid","Isoprene","Beta-carotene","Alpha-carotene","Gamma-carotene","Cryptoxanthin","Vitamin_A","Retinal","Antioxidant","Lutein","Astaxanthin","Zeaxanthin","Macula_lutea","Retina","Visual_acuity","Journal_of_the_American_Medical_Association","Philip_Taylor","Sanford_Dawsey","Gac","Palm_oil","Avocado","Tetraterpenoid","Terpene","Polyene","Lutein","Zeaxanthin","Alpha-Carotene","Beta-Carotene","Lycopene","Hydrocarbon","Unsaturated_hydrocarbon","Carotene","Carrots","Gac","Lycopene","Double_bond","Conjugated_system","Photosynthesis","Flora","Cyanobacteria","Photosynthetic_reaction_centre","Auto-oxidation","Human","Free-radical","Epidemiology","Blood_plasma","Cancer","Cancer","Retinol","Cell_growth","Animal","Gene","Fungi","Horizontal_gene_transfer","Flamingo","Salmon","Lobster","Puffin","Macula_lutea","Actinic","Corpus_luteum","Lutein","Chlorophyll","Deciduous","Autumn_leaf_color","Anthocyanin","Wiley-Blackwell","Ionone","Damascone","Damascenone","Perfume","Rose","Black_tea","Tobacco","Grape","Fruit","Staphyloxanthin","Antioxidant","Reactive_oxygen_species","Corpus_luteum","Macula_lutea","Retina","Lycopersene","Phytofluene","Hexahydrolycopene","Torulene","Α-Zeacarotene","Alloxanthin","Cynthiaxanthin","Pectenoxanthin","Cryptomonaxanthin","Crustaxanthin","Gazaniaxanthin","OH-Chlorobactene","Loroxanthin","Lycoxanthin","Rhodopin","Rhodopinol","Warmingol","Saproxanthin","Zeaxanthin","Oscillaxanthin","Phleixanthophyll","Rhodovibrin","Spheroidene","Diadinoxanthin","Luteoxanthin","Mutatoxanthin","Citroxanthin","Zeaxanthin","Neochrome_(Carotenoid)","Foliachrome","Trollichrome","Vaucheriaxanthin","Rhodopinal","Warmingone","Torularhodinaldehyde","Torularhodin","Torularhodin_methyl_ester","Astaxanthin","Canthaxanthin","Capsanthin","Capsorubin","Cryptocapsin","2,2'-Diketospirilloxanthin","Flexixanthin","Phoenicoxanthin","Hydroxyspheriodenone","Okenone","Pectenolone","Phoeniconone","Dehydroadonirubin","Phoenicopterone","Rubixanthone","Siphonaxanthin","Astacein","Fucoxanthin","Isofucoxanthin","Physalien","Zeaxanthin","Siphonein","Β-Apo-2'-carotenal","Apo-2-lycopenal","Apo-6'-lycopenal","Azafrinaldehyde","Bixin","Citranaxanthin","Crocetin","Crocetinsemialdehyde","Crocin","Hopkinsiaxanthin","Methyl_apo-6'-lycopenoate","Paracentrone","Sintaxanthin","Actinioerythrin","Β-Carotenone","Peridinin","Pyrrhoxanthininol","Semi-α-carotenone","Semi-β-carotenone","Triphasiaxanthin","Eschscholtzxanthin","Eschscholtzxanthone","Rhodoxanthin","Tangeraxanthin","Nonaprenoxanthin","Decaprenoxanthin","C.p._450","C.p._473","Bacterioruberin","Phytochemistry","List_of_phytochemicals_and_foods_in_which_they_are_prominent"]}
