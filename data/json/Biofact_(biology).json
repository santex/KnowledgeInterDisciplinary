Klein of Vienna (1891â1968) coined the term\nin his article Biofakt und Artefakt in the microscopy journal Mikrokosmos,\nthough at that time it was not adopted by the scientific community. Klein's\nconcept of biofact stressed the dead materials produced by living organisms as\nsheaths, such as shells.\n\nThe word \"biofact\" is now widely used in the zoo/aquarium world, but was first\nused in 1993 in the Education Department at the New England Aquarium, Boston, to\nrefer to preserved items such as animal bones, skins, molts and eggs. The\nAccreditation Standards and Related Policies of the Association of Zoos and\nAquariums states that biofacts can be useful education tools, and are preferable\nto live animals because of potential ethical considerations.\n","linknr":95,"url":"Biofact_(biology)","recorded":1362500110,"links":17,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Biology terminology"],"headings":[],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e1/Ambox_wikify.svg/40px-Ambox_wikify.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Blue_morpho_butterfly.jpg/30px-Blue_morpho_butterfly.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Protozoologist","Association_of_Zoos_and_Aquariums"]}
