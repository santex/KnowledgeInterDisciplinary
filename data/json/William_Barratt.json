{"cursor":"4396","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"William Barrett}}\n\n'William James Barratt' (25 January 1823 â 10 September 1889) was an English\nconvert to Mormonism and became the first Latter Day Saint to live in Australia\nwhen he was sent there as a missionary of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter\nDay Saints. However, he ultimately apostatized from Mormonism.\n\nBarratt was born in Burslem, North Staffordshire, England. The date of Barratt's\nconversion to Mormonism is unknown, but Latter Day Saint missionaries first\npreached in the Burslem area in 1839. He was the only member of his family to\njoin the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. On 1840-07-11, Apostle\nGeorge A. Smith recorded in his diary that he had ordained the 17-year-old\nBarratt to the office of elder and had set him apart to preach as a missionary\nin Australia. Barratt's parents had already decided to emigrate to Australia and\nBarratt had decided that he would accompany them and eventually join the main\ngathering of Latter-day Saints in Utah Territory. On 17 July, Barratt's ship\nleft London for Australia.\n\nThe Barratts arrived in Adelaide on 1840-11-16. Barratt found employment as a\nshepherd's cook in Mount Barker. Barratt tried preaching in Australia, and was\nsuccessful in baptizing a few people, but quickly became discouraged at the\nmoral tone of the settlers there. One of the people he did baptize in 1842 was\nRobert Beauchamp. Shortly thereafter, Barratt lost interest in Mormonism and\nbecame involved in the Congregational church in Encounter Bay. Because of this,\nBeauchamp, not Barratt, became the leader of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-\nday Saints (LDS Church) in Australia and eventually the president of the\nchurch's Australasian Mission. Although missionaries from the LDS Church arrived\nin Australia in 1851, there is no record of Barratt attempting to contact them\nor vice versa.\n\nBarratt became a prominent land owner in the Bald Hills and Inman Valley areas\nof South Australia. He married Ann Gibson and fathered seven children. Barratt\ndied at Bald Hills, South Australia and is buried at Victor Harbor, South\nAustralia.\n","linknr":124,"url":"William_Barratt","recorded":1375057944,"links":["/w/index.php?title=William_Barratt&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=William_Barratt&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/William_Barrett_(disambiguation)","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:External_links","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources#Inline_citations","/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Fact_and_Reference_Check","/wiki/England","/wiki/Mormonism","/wiki/Latter_Day_Saint","/wiki/Australia","/wiki/Mormon_missionary","/wiki/Church_of_Christ_(Latter_Day_Saints)","/wiki/Apostasy","/wiki/Burslem","/wiki/North_Staffordshire","/wiki/England","/wiki/Apostle_(Latter_Day_Saints)","/wiki/George_A._Smith","/wiki/Elder_(Latter_Day_Saints)","/wiki/Setting_apart","/wiki/Utah_Territory","/wiki/London","/wiki/Adelaide","/wiki/Mount_Barker,_South_Australia","/wiki/Baptism","/wiki/Congregational_church","/wiki/The_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints","/wiki/Mission_president","/wiki/Mission_(LDS_Church)","/wiki/South_Australia","/wiki/Victor_Harbor,_South_Australia","/w/index.php?title=William_Barratt&action=edit&section=1","http://byustudies.byu.edu/shop/pdfSRC/28.3Devitry-Smith.pdf","http://www.lds.org/ldsorg/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=2354fccf2b7db010VgnVCM1000004d82620aRCRD&locale=0&sourceId=4a74ef960417b010VgnVCM1000004d82620a____&hideNav=1","/wiki/Ensign_(LDS_magazine)","/w/index.php?title=William_Barratt&action=edit&section=2","http://www.mormonhistory.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=257&Itemid=93","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=William_Barratt&oldid=554903463","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Australian_people_of_English_descent","/wiki/Category:1823_births","/wiki/Category:1889_deaths","/wiki/Category:Australian_Latter_Day_Saints","/wiki/Category:English_emigrants_to_Australia","/wiki/Category:Christian_missionaries_in_Australia","/wiki/Category:Converts_to_Mormonism","/wiki/Category:English_Latter_Day_Saints","/wiki/Category:English_Christian_missionaries","/wiki/Category:Former_Latter_Day_Saints","/wiki/Category:Latter_Day_Saint_missionaries","/wiki/Category:Mission_presidents_of_The_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints","/wiki/Category:Mormon_missionaries_in_Australia","/wiki/Category:People_from_South_Australia","/wiki/Category:People_from_Burslem","/wiki/Category:19th-century_Mormon_missionaries","/wiki/Category:Articles_lacking_in-text_citations_from_May_2013","/wiki/Category:All_articles_lacking_in-text_citations","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=William+Barratt&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=William+Barratt","/wiki/William_Barratt","/wiki/Talk:William_Barratt","#","/wiki/William_Barratt","/w/index.php?title=William_Barratt&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=William_Barratt&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/William_Barratt","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/William_Barratt","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=William_Barratt&oldid=554903463","/w/index.php?title=William_Barratt&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q8005107","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=William_Barratt&id=554903463","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=William+Barratt","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&art
