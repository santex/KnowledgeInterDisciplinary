The most common types of art works which use models are\nfigure drawing, figure painting, sculpture and photography, but almost any\nmedium may be used.\n\nArt models are often paid professionals who pose or provide the human figure in\na work of art. Though professional, art models are usually anonymous and\nunacknowledged subjects of the work. Models are most frequently employed for art\nclasses or by informal groups of experienced artists that gather to share the\nexpense of a model. Models are also employed privately by professional artists.\nAlthough commercial motives dominate over aesthetics in illustration, its\nartwork commonly employs models. For example, Norman Rockwell used his friends\nand neighbors as models for both his commercial and fine art work. An\nindividual who is having their own portrait painted or sculpted is usually\ncalled a \"sitter\" rather than a model, since they are paying to have the work\ndone rather than being paid to pose.\n\nThroughout the history of Western art, drawing the human figure from living\nmodels was considered the most effective way to develop the skill of\ndraftsmanship. First, it is best to draw from real objects, rather than copying\ntwo dimensional images. Nicolaides Second, an artist has a connection\nto drawing another human being that cannot exist with any other\nsubject. Berry, p.4 Jacobs, p. 58 Models for life drawing\nclasses are usually nude, to provide for an unobstructed anatomical study. This\nmay be referred to as being \"undraped\" or \"disrobed\". Art models who pose in the\nnude for life drawing are also called 'life models' or 'figure models'. In the\nclassroom setting, where the purpose is to learn how to draw the human form in\nall the different shapes, ages and ethnicity, there are no real limitations on\nwho the model can be. In some cases, the model may pose with various props, one\nor more other models, against real or artificial background, in natural or\nartificial light and so on.\n\nThe role of art models has changed through different eras as the meaning and\nimportance of the human figure in art and society has changed. Clark, Ch.1\nThe Naked and the Nude Postle & Vaughn Pt. I: From Academy to Art\nSchool More than being simply the subject of art, models are often thought\nof as muses, a source of inspiration without whom the art would not\nexist. Steinhart, Ch. 9, \"waiting for a Muse\" Nude modeling, nude art\nand nudity in general are at times subject to social disapproval, at least by\nsome elements in society.
