OIRA is located within the Office of Management and Budget, which\nis an agency within the Executive Office of the President. It is staffed by both\npolitical appointees and career civil servants, who have been carrying out the\nsame kinds of economic analysis and related analyses for the past 20 years. In\naddition to reviewing draft regulations under\n[http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/npr/library/direct/orders/2646.html Executive\nOrder 12866], OIRA reviews collections of information under the Paperwork\nReduction Act, and also develops and oversees the implementation of government-\nwide policies in the areas of information technology, information policy,\nprivacy, and statistical policy.\n\nExecutive Order 12866 describes OIRA's role in the rulemaking process. In it,\nthe President directs agencies, to the extent permitted by law, to follow\ncertain principles in rulemaking, such as consideration of alternatives and\nanalysis of impacts, both benefits and costs. As the Executive Order directs,\nOIRA reviews agency draft regulations before publication to ensure agency\ncompliance with this Executive Order.\n\nThe issuance of Presidential regulatory principles, and the centralized review\nof draft regulations, has been part of regulatory development for 30 years in\none form or another. This began with President Richard Nixon's \"Quality of Life\"\nprogram, and continued in the 1970s with President Gerald Ford's requirement in\nExecutive Orders [http://www.thecre.com/ombpapers/ExecutiveOrder11821.htm/\n11821] and [http://www.thecre.com/ombpapers/ExecutiveOrder11949.htm/ 11949] for\nagencies to prepare inflation/economic impact statements and with President\nJimmy Carter's Executive Order 12044 on \"Improving Government Regulations.\"\n\nThe OMB review process became more formalized in 1981 with President Ronald\nReagan's Executive Order 12291, which was in effect from 1981 to September 1993\n(the Reagan and George H. W. Bush Administrations and the first nine months of\nthe Clinton administration). In September 1993, President Clinton issued\nExecutive Order 12866. During the Reagan administration, the White House had\nreviewed 2,000 to 3,000 regulations per year, but under Clinton, the total\ndropped to between 500 and 700 annually.\n[http://apnews.myway.com/article/20070704/D8Q5EE800.html]\n\nAs amended by President George W. Bush's Executive Order 13422, the [http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/inforeg/eo12866/eo12866_amended_01-\n2007.pdf Executive Order] covers federal agencies' \"guidance documents\", in\naddition to regulations. The Order's stated purpose is to ensure that agencies,\nto the extent permitted by law, comply with the regulatory principles stated in\nExecutive Order 12866 and that the President's policies are reflected in agency\nrules. It also specifies procedures for the resolution of conflicts between or\namong agencies.\n\nIn July 2007, a controversy arose in the U.S. Congress over George W. Bush's\nExecutive Order 13422 (signed by Bush in January 2007 and due to take effect on\nJuly 24, 2007) giving the OIRA additional\npowers.[http://www.commondreams.org/archive/2007/07/04/2296/] The House of\nRepresentatives voted to prohibit OIRA from spending federal money on Executive\nOrder 13422.
