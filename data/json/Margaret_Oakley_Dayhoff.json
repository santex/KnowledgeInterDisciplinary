She dedicated her career to applying the evolving computational\ntechnologies to support advances in biology and medicine, most notably the\ncreation of protein and nucleic acid databases and tools to interrogate the\ndatabases. Her PhD degree was from Columbia University in the Department of\nChemistry, where she devised computational methods to calculate molecular\nresonance energies of several organic compounds. She did postdoctoral studies at\nthe Rockefeller Institute (now Rockefeller University) and the University of\nMaryland, and joined the newly established National Biomedical Research\nFoundation in 1959. She was the first woman to hold office in the Biophysical\nSociety, first as Secretary and eventually President. She originated one of the\nfirst substitution matrices, Point accepted mutations (PAM). The one-letter code\nused for amino acids was developed by her, reflecting an attempt to reduce the\nsize of the data files used to describe amino acid sequences in an era of punch-\ncard computing.\n","linknr":174,"url":"Margaret_Oakley_Dayhoff","recorded":1362505056,"links":20,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["1925 births","1983 deaths","Bioinformaticians","American biochemists","American physical chemists","Women biologists","Women computer scientists"],"headings":["Early life","Research","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d5/Margaret_Oakley_Dayhoff_cropped.jpg/220px-Margaret_Oakley_Dayhoff_cropped.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Philadelphia","Pennsylvania","Silver_Spring,_Maryland","United_States","Bioinformatics","Columbia_University","Substitution_matrix","Proteinogenic_amino_acid","George_E._Kimball","Physical_chemist","Bioinformatics","DNA_and_Cell_Biology","Mary_Ann_Liebert,_Inc.","Georgetown_University_Medical_Center","National_Biomedical_Research_Foundation","Columbia_University","Molecular_resonance","Rockefeller_University","University_of_Maryland","Biophysical_Society","Substitution_matrix","Point_accepted_mutation","Proteinogenic_amino_acid","Philadelphia","New_York_City","Bayside,_New_York","New_York_University","Mathematics","George_E._Kimball","Columbia_University","Resonance","Polycyclic_compound","Electrochemistry","Rockefeller_University","Chemical_bonding","Ellis_Lippincott","American_Association_for_the_Advancement_of_Science","Journal_of_Molecular_Evolution","Computers_in_Biology_and_Medicine","Frederick_Sanger","Emile_Zuckerkandl","Linus_Pauling","Carl_Sagan","Sequence_alignment","Emile_Zuckerkandl","Linus_Pauling","Frederic_Sanger","Phylogeny","Evolutionary_tree","Maximum_parsimony","Point_Accepted_Mutation","Protein_Information_Resource","Walter_Goad","GenBank","Gene_family","David_Lipman","National_Center_for_Biotechnology_Information","Philadelphia","Silver_Spring,_Maryland"]}
