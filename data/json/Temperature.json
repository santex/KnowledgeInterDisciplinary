Theory of Heat, Longmans, Green,\nand Co., London. p. 2. It is a measure of the local thermal energy of\nmatter or radiation; it is measured by a thermometer, which may be calibrated in\nany of various temperature scales, Celsius, Fahrenheit, Kelvin, etc., etc.\n\nEmpirically it is found that an isolated system, one that exchanges no energy or\nmaterial with its environment, tends to a spatially uniform temperature as time\npasses. When a path permeable only to heat is open between two bodies, energy\nalways flows spontaneously as heat from a hotter body to a colder one. The flow\nrate increases with the temperature difference and with a property of the path\ncalled the thermal conductance. Between two bodies with the same temperature,\nconnected by a path permeable only to heat, no energy will flow. These bodies\nare said to be \"in the relation of thermal equilibrium\". In a body in its own\ninternal thermal equilibrium, the temperature is spatially uniform.\n\nIn kinetic theory and in statistical mechanics, temperature is explained by\nthe motions and interactions of microscopic constituents such as molecules\nand photons.\n\n alpha helix. The amplitude of the vibrations increases with temperature.]]\n\nThere is a lowest possible temperature, which is called absolute zero, though it\ncannot be reached by any actual physical device. It is denoted by 0 K on the\nKelvin scale, â273.15Â°C on the Celsius scale. In matter at the absolute zero of\ntemperature, the motions of microscopic constituents are minimal; moreover their\nenergies are also minimal. For the microscopic constituent particles of a body\nas a whole, there is no maximal energy. For a body in internal thermal\nequilibrium as a whole, the ordinary thermodynamic temperature is always\npositive. Besides this, there is also a special concept of negative\nthermodynamic temperature for certain component particles of a body, such as\nhave available to them constrained maximal energies when the rest of the body is\nvery cold, so that the body as a whole is not in internal thermal equilibrium.\n\nTemperature is important in all fields of natural science, including physics,\ngeology, chemistry, atmospheric sciences and biology.\n","linknr":845,"url":"Temperature","recorded":1362512663,"links":124,"instances":["number","mathematics","physics","element","temperature","mathematical_physics","unit","thermodynamics","physics_and_chemistry"],"pdf":["http://www.uic.edu/labs/trl/1.OnlineMaterials/BasicPrinciplesByTWLeland.pdf","http://www.uic.edu/labs/trl/1.OnlineMaterials/BasicPrinciplesByTWLeland.pdf","http://theory.physics.helsinki.fi/~sol_phys/Sol0601.pdf","http://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0507099.pdf"],"categories":["Temperature|","Concepts
