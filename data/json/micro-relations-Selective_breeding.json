Typically, strains that are selectively bred are\n domesticated, and the breeding is sometimes done by a professional breeder.\n Bred animals are known as breeds, while bred plants are known as varieties,\n cultigens, or cultivars. The cross of animals results in what is called a\n crossbreed, and crossbred plants are called hybrids.\n\nIn animal breeding techniques such as inbreeding, linebreeding, and outcrossing\nare utilized. In plant breeding, similar methods are used. Charles Darwin\ndiscussed how selective breeding had been successful in producing change over\ntime in his book, [[Origin of Species]]. The first chapter of the book discusses\nselective breeding and domestication of such animals as pigeons, cats, cattle,\nand dogs. Selective breeding was used by Darwin as a springboard to introduce\nthe theory of natural selection, and to support it. *\n\nThe deliberate exploitation of selective breeding to produce desired results has\nbecome very common in agriculture and experimental biology. Selective breeding\nmay also produce unintended results. [http://www.cell.com/abstract/S0092-8674%2806%2901592-\n3]\n\nSelective breeding can also be unintentional; it is thought that domestication\nof crops by early humans was largely unintentional.
