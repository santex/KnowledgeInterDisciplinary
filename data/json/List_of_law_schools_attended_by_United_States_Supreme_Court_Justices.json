{"cursor":"10720","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" was the first Justice to have formally attended a law school.]] was the last\n sitting Justice not to have received a law degree.]] The Constitution does not\n require that any federal judges have any particular educational background, but\n the work of the Court involved complex questions of law â ranging from\n constitutional law to administrative law to admiralty law â and\n consequentially, a legal education has become a de facto prerequisite to\n appointment on the Supreme Court. Every person who has been nominated to the\n Court has been an attorney. Jeffrey A. Segal, Harold J.\n Spaeth, The Supreme Court and the Attitudinal Model Revisited (2002) p.\n 182.\n\nBefore the advent of modern law schools in the United States, justices, like\nmost attorneys of the time, completed their legal studies by \"reading law\"\n(studying under and acting as an apprentice to more experienced attorneys)\nrather than attend a formal program. The first Justice to be appointed who had\nattended an actual law school was Levi Woodbury, appointed to the Court in 1846.\nWoodbury had attended Tapping Reeve Law School in Litchfield, Connecticut, the\nmost prestigious law school in the United States in that day, prior to his\nadmission to the bar in 1812. However, Woodbury did not earn a law degree.\nWoodbury's successor on the Court, Benjamin Robbins Curtis, who received his law\ndegree from Harvard Law School in 1832, and was appointed to the Court in 1851,\nwas the first Justice to bear such a credential. Henry\nJulian Abraham, Justices, Presidents, and Senators: A History of the U.S.\nSupreme Court Appointments from Washington to Bush II (2007), p. 49.\n\nAssociate Justice James F. Byrnes, whose short tenure lasted from June 1941 to\nOctober 1942, was the last Justice without a law degree to be appointed; Stanley\nForman Reed, who served on the Court from 1938 to 1957, was the last sitting\nJustice from such a background. In total, of the 112 Justices appointed to the\nCourt, 46 have had law degrees, an additional 18 attended some law school but\ndid not receive a degree, and 47 received their legal education without any law\nschool attendance.\n","linknr":288,"url":"List_of_law_schools_attended_by_United_States_Supreme_Court_Justices","recorded":1375074735,"links":["/w/index.php?title=List_of_law_schools_attended_by_United_States_Supreme_Court_Justices&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=List_of_law_schools_attended_by_United_States_Supreme_Court_Justices&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:LeviWoodbury.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/LeviWoodbury.png/220px-LeviWoodbury.png","/wiki/File:LeviWoodbury.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf5/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Levi_Woodbury","/wiki/File:Stanley_Reed.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d9/Stanley_Reed.jpg/220px-Stanley_Reed.jpg","/wiki/File:Stanley_Reed.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf5/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Stanley_F._Reed","/wiki/Law","/wiki/United_States_constitutional_law","/wiki/Administrative_law","/wiki/Admiralty_law","/wiki/Attorney_at_law_(United_States)","#cite_note-segal-spa-182-1","/wiki/Law_school_in_the_United_States","/wiki/Reading_law","/wiki/Apprenticeship","/wiki/Levi_Woodbury","/wiki/Litchfield_Law_School","/wiki/Litchfield,_Connecticut","/wiki/Law_degree","/wiki/Benjamin_Robbins_Curtis","/wiki/Harvard_Law_School","#cite_note-abraham-49-2","/wiki/James_F._Byrnes","/wiki/Stanley_Forman_Reed","#cite_note-abraham-49-2","#Four_or_more_Justices","#Three_Justices","#Two_Justices","#One_Justice","#University_or_college_trained","#No_university_legal_education","#See_also","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=List_of_law_schools_attended_by_United_States_Supreme_Court_Justices&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Harvard_Law_School","/wiki/Harry_Blackmun","/wiki/Louis_Brandeis","/wiki/William_J._Brennan,_Jr.","/wiki/Stephen_Breyer","/wiki/Henry_Billings_Brown","/wiki/Harold_Hitz_Burton","/wiki/Benjamin_Robbins_Curtis","/wiki/Felix_Frankfurter","/wiki/Melville_Fuller","/wiki/Ruth_Bader_Ginsburg","/wiki/Columbia_Law_School","/wiki/Oliver_Wendell_Holmes,_Jr.","/wiki/Elena_Kagan","/wiki/Anthony_Kennedy","/wiki/William_Henry_Moody","/wiki/Lewis_Franklin_Powell,_Jr.","/wiki/LLM","/wiki/John_Roberts","/wiki/Edward_Terry_Sanford","/wiki/Antonin_Scalia","/wiki/David_Hackett_Souter","/wiki/Yale_Law_School","/wiki/Samuel_Alito","/wiki/Henry_Billings_Brown","/wiki/David_Davis_(Supreme_Court_justice)","/wiki/Abe_Fortas","/wiki/Sherman_Minton","/wiki/Indiana_University_Maurer_School_of_Law","/wiki/George_Shiras,_Jr.","/wiki/Sonia_Sotomayor","/wiki/Potter_Stewart","/wiki/Clarence_Thomas","/wiki/Byron_White","/wiki/Columbia_Law_School","/wiki/Benjamin_N._Cardozo","/wiki/William_O._Douglas","/wiki/Ruth_Bader_Ginsburg","/wiki/Charles_Evans_Hughes","/wiki/Joseph_McKenna","/wiki/Stanley_Forman_Reed","/wiki/University_of_Virginia_School_of_Law","/wiki/Harlan_Fiske_Stone","/w/index.php?title=List_of_law_schools_attended_by_United_States_Supreme_Court_Justices&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/University_of_Michigan_Law_School","/wiki/George_Sutherland","/wiki/Frank_Murphy","/wiki/William_R._Day","/wiki/Litchfield_Law_School","/wiki/Henry_Baldwin_(judge)","/wiki/Ward_Hunt","/wiki/Levi_Woodbury","/wiki/Law_school","/w/index.php?title=List_of_law_schools_attended_by_United_States_Supreme_Court_Justices&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/Albany_Law_School","/wiki/David_Josiah_Brewer","/wiki/Robert_H._Jackson","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Cincinnati_Law_School","/wiki/Willis_Van_Devanter","/wiki/William_Howard_Taft","/wiki/Cumberland_School_of_Law","/wiki/Howell_Edmunds_Jackson","/wiki/Horace_Harmon_Lurton","/wiki/Northwestern_University_School_of_Law","/wiki/Arthur_Goldberg","/wiki/John_Paul_Stevens","/wiki/Stanford_Law_School","/wiki/Sandra_Day_O%27Connor","/wiki/William_Rehnquist","/wiki/University_of_Virginia_School_of_Law","/wiki/James_Clark_McReynolds","/wiki/Stanley_Forman_Reed","/wiki/Columbia_Law_School","/wiki/Washington_and_Lee_University_School_of_Law","/wiki/Joseph_Rucker_Lamar","/wiki/Lewis_Franklin_Powell,_Jr.","/w/index.php?title=List_of_law_schools_attended_by_United_States_Supreme_Court_Justices&action=edit&section=4","/wiki/Howard_University_School_of_Law","/wiki/Thurgood_Marshall","/wiki/Indiana_University_Maure
