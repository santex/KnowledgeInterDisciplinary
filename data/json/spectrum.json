(accessed: January 25, 2008).</ref>) is a\ncondition that is not limited to a specific set of values but can vary\ninfinitely within a continuum. The word saw its first scientific use within the\nfield of optics to describe the rainbow of colors in visible light when\nseparated using a prism; it has since been applied by analogy to many fields\nother than optics. Thus, one might talk about the spectrum of [[political\nspectrum|political opinion]], or the spectrum of activity of a drug, or the\n[[autism spectrum]]. In these uses, values within a spectrum may not be\nassociated with precisely quantifiable numbers or definitions. Such uses imply a\nbroad range of conditions or behaviors grouped together and studied under a\nsingle title for ease of discussion.\n\nIn most modern usages of spectrum there is a unifying theme between extremes at\neither end. Some older usages of the word did not have a unifying theme, but\nthey led to modern ones through a sequence of events set out below. Modern\nusages in mathematics did evolve from a unifying theme, but this may be\ndifficult to recognize.\n","title":"spectrum","headings":["Origins","Modern meaning in the physical sciences","See also","References"]},"micro-relation":["2: Optics","1: Rainbow","1: Dispersive_prism","1: Latin","1: Apparition","1: Ghost#Terminology","1: Spectral_evidence","1: Hearsay","1: Ghost","1: Satan","1: Witchcraft","1: Salem,_Massachusetts","1: Afterimage","1: Johann_Wolfgang_von_Goethe","1: Arthur_Schopenhauer","1: Edward_R._Bradley","1: Color","1: Frequency","1: Wavelength","1: Spectral_density","1: Waves","1: Sound_wave","1: Electron_spectroscopy","1: Mass_spectrometry","1: Electromagnetic_spectrum","1: Visible_spectrum","1: Emission_spectrum","1: Absorption_spectrum","1: Energy_spectrum","1: Frequency_spectrum","1: Mass_spectrum","1: Power_spectrum","1: Radio_spectrum","1: Stellar_classification","1: Spectrogram","1: Spectrometer","1: Antibiotic#Classes","1: Economic_spectrum","1: Political_spectrum","1: Spectrum_disorder","1: Spectrum_of_a_matrix","1: Spectrum_of_an_operator","1: Spectrum_of_a_ring","1: Spectrum_of_a_C*-algebra","1: Spectrum_of_a_theory","1: Stone_space"]}
