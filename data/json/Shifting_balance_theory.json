{"cursor":"3282","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nThe 'shifting balance theory' is a controversial theory of evolution proposed in\n1931 by Sewall Wright, suggesting that adaptive evolution may proceed most\nquickly when a population divides into uniquely adapted subpopulations followed\nby reestablishment of gene flow. The theory uses Wright's metaphor of fitness\nlandscapes, attempting to explain how a population may move across an adaptive\nvalley to a higher adaptive peak. According to the theory, this movement occurs\nin three steps: #Genetic drift allows a locally adapted subpopulation to move\nacross an adaptive valley to the base of a higher adaptive peak. #Natural\nselection acting on random mutations will then result in hill-climbing up this\nhigher peak. #This new superiorly adapted subpopulation may then expand its\nrange and outcompete or interbreed with other subpopulations, causing the spread\nof new adaptations and movement of the global population toward the new fitness\npeak. This may involve the process of group selection if subpopulations\noccupying fitter adaptive peaks contribute more migrants or are less likely to\ngo extinct.\n\nAlthough shifting balance theory has been influential in evolutionary biology,\ninspiring the theories of quantum evolution and punctuated equilibrium, little empirical evidence exists to support the\nshifting balance process as an important factor in evolution.\n","linknr":103,"url":"Shifting_balance_theory","recorded":1362483394,"links":13,"instances":["biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Evolutionary biology"],"headings":["References","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/67/Fitness-landscape-cartoon.png/220px-Fitness-landscape-cartoon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["range","biology"]],"members":["range"],"related":["Evolution","Sewall_Wright","Population","Subpopulation","Gene_flow","Fitness_landscapes","Adaptive_valley","Adaptive_peak","Genetic_drift","Natural_selection","Random_mutation","Hill-climbing","Range_(biology)","Interbreed","Adaptation","Group_selection","Evolutionary_biology","Quantum_evolution","Punctuated_equilibrium"]}
