In diachronic (or\nhistorical) linguistics, semantic change is a change in one of the meanings of a\nword. Every word has a variety of senses and connotations, which can be added,\nremoved, or altered over time, often to the extent that cognates across space\nand time have very different meanings. The study of semantic change can be seen\nas part of etymology, onomasiology, semasiology, and semantics.\n",
