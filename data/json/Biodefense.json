It is technically possible to apply biodefense\nmeasures to protect animals or plants, but this is generally uneconomic.\nHowever, protection of water supplies and food supplies are often a critical\npart of biodefense. Various definitions of biosafety emerged in different\nprofessions to guarantee non-human health.\n\nBiodefense is most often discussed in the context of biowar or bioterrorism, and\nis generally considered a military or emergency response term.\n\nBiodefense applies to two distinct target populations: civilian non-combatant\nand military combatant (troops in the field).\n","linknr":199,"url":"Biodefense","recorded":1362501488,"links":17,"instances":["cbrne"],"pdf":["http://www.ccc.nps.navy.mil/research/theses/bernett06.pdf","http://www.ccc.nps.navy.mil/research/theses/bernett06.pdf","http://rods.health.pitt.edu/LIBRARY/dato2AHRQInterimRpt112801.pdf","http://rods.health.pitt.edu/LIBRARY/dato2AHRQInterimRpt112801.pdf","http://www.acq.osd.mil/cp/bwdvrdp-july01.pdf"],"categories":["Bioethics","Biological warfare"],"headings":["Military","Civilian","References","See also","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg/20px-Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["20th_support_command","cbrne"]],"members":["20th_support_command"],"related":["Military","Biosecurity","Biological_warfare","Civilian","Biological_hazard","Animal","Plants","Biosafety","Biological_warfare","Bioterrorism","Emergency_response","United_States_biological_defense_program","United_States_Army_Medical_Unit","Fort_Detrick","Maryland","United_States_Army_Biological_Warfare_Laboratories","Bio-agents","USAMRIID","United_States_Department_of_Defense","Anthrax","Smallpox","Bubonic_plague","Tularemia","Botulinum","Ricin","Equine_encephalitis","Yekaterinburg","Soviet_Union","Compound_19","Sverdlovsk_Anthrax_leak","Chest_X-ray","First_Gulf_War","Task_Force_Scorpio","Lawrence_Livermore_National_Laboratory","Pathogen","National_Institute_of_Allergy_and_Infectious_Diseases","United_States","Contamination","Forensic","Public_health","University_of_Pittsburgh","Biomedical","Real-Time_Outbreak_Disease_Surveillance","Ron_Aryel","George_W._Bush","USD","Masonic_temple","DEW","Health_record_systems","Ranching","Feedlot","Drinking_water","False_alarms","Europe","Integrated_circuit","Neuron","Fiber-optic","Antibody","Avalanche_photodiodes","United_States_Marine_Corps","Chemical_Biological_Incident_Response_Force","United_States_Army","20th_Support_Command_(CBRNE)","Decontamination","United_States_biological_defense_program","United_States_Army_Medical_Research_Institute_of_Infectious_Diseases","National_Biodefense_Analysis_and_Countermeasures_Center","Sensing_of_phage-triggered_ion_cascades","Fluctuation-enhanced_sensing"]}
