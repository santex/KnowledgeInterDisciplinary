{"cursor":"4571","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Carlos Sommervogel' (8 January 1834 – 4 March 1902) was a French Jesuit\nscholar. He was author of the monumental BibliothÃ¨que de la Compagnie de JÃ©sus,\nwhich served as one of the major references for the editors of the Catholic\nEncyclopedia.\n\nBorn in Strasbourg, Sommervogel was the fourth son of Marie-Maximillian-Joseph\nSommervogel and Hortense Blanchard. After studying at the lycÃ©e of Strasbourg,\nhe entered the Jesuit novitiate at Issenheim, Alsace, 2 February 1853, and was\nsent later to Saint-Acheul, Amiens, to complete his literary studies.\n\nIn 1856, he was appointed assistant prefect of discipline and sub-librarian in\nthe College of the Immaculate Conception, Rue Vaugirard, Paris. Here he\ndiscovered his literary vocation. The BibliothÃ¨que of Augustin and Aloys de\nBacker was then in course of publication, and Sommervogel, noting its occasional\nerrors and omissions, made a systematic examination of the whole work.\n\nFour years later, Augustin de Backer, seeing his list of addenda and errata, a\nmanuscript of 800 pages, containing over 10,000 entries, obtained leave to make\nuse of it. Sommervogel continued at Rue Vaugirard until 1865, reviewing his\ncourse of philosophy meanwhile.\n\nHe then studied theology at Amiens, where he was ordained in September, 1866.\nFrom 1867 until 1879 he was one of the staff on the Jesuit publication\n[[Ãtudes]], being managing editor from 1871 to 1879. During the Franco-Prussian\nwar he served as chaplain in Faidherbe's army, and was decorated in 1871 with a\nbronze medal for his self-sacrifice.\n\nFr. de Backer in the revised edition of his BibliothÃ¨que (1869-76) gave\nSommervogel's name as co-author, due to the latter's significant contributions.\n\nFrom 1880 to 1882 Sommervogel was assistant to his father-provincial.\n\nBefore 1882 he had never had any special opportunity of pursuing his study; all\nhis bibliographical work had been done in his spare moments. In 1884 he\npublished his Dictionnaire des ouvrages anonymes et pseudonymes publiÃ©s par des\nreligieux de la Compagnie de JÃ©sus. In 1885 he was appointed successor to the de\nBackers and went to Louvain. He determined to recast and enlarge their work and\nafter five years issued the first volume of the first part (Brussels and Paris,\n1890); by 1900 the ninth volume had appeared; the tenth, an index of the first\nnine, which comprised the bibliographic part of the BibliothÃ¨que was unfinished\nat the time of his death but was later completed by Fr. Brucker, from which\nthese details were drawn.\n\nSommervogel had intended to compile a second, or historical part of his work,\nwhich was to be a revision of Auguste Carayon's Bibliographie historique. He was\na man of exemplary virtue, giving freely to all the fruit of his devoted\nlabours, and content to live for years a busy obscure life to which duty called\nhim, until his superiors directed him to devote himself to his favorite study\nduring the last fifteen years of his life. He re-edited a number of works by old\nwriters of the Society of Jesus and, in addition to his articles in the Ãtudes,\nwrote Table methodique des MÃ©moires de TrÃ©voux (3 vols., 1885); Moniteur\nbibliographique de la Compagnie de JÃ©sus (1894-1901).\n\nSommervogel died in Paris in 1902.\n","linknr":113,"url":"Sommervogel","recorded":1374860275,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Carlos_Sommervogel&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Carlos_Sommervogel&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","/wiki/Carlos_Sommervogel","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","/w/index.php?title=Sommervogel&redirect=no","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/France","/wiki/Jesuit","/wiki/Catholic_Encyclopedia","/wiki/Strasbourg","/wiki/Lyc%C3%A9e","/wiki/Strasbourg","/wiki/Novitiate","/wiki/Issenheim","/wiki/Alsace","/wiki/Saint-Acheul","/wiki/Amiens","/w/index.php?title=College_of_the_Immaculate_Conception_(Paris)&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Augustin_de_Backer","/w/index.php?title=Aloys_de_Backer&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Augustin_de_Backer","/wiki/Amiens","/wiki/%C3%89tudes","/wiki/Franco-Prussian_war","/wiki/Chaplain","/wiki/Louis_Faidherbe","/w/index.php?title=Father-provincial&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Leuven","/wiki/Brussels","/wiki/Auguste_Carayon","/w/index.php?title=Carlos_Sommervogel&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Catholic_Encyclopedia","http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14109a.htm","/wiki/John_Hungerford_Pollen_(junior)","/wiki/Public_domain","/w/index.php?title=Carlos_Sommervogel&action=edit&section=2","http://gallica.bnf.fr/Search?ArianeWireIndex=index&p=1&lang=en&q=%22Sommervogel,+Carlos%22","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/64137477","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Carlos_Sommervogel&oldid=542413050","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1834_births","/wiki/Category:1902_deaths","/wiki/Category:People_from_Strasbourg","/wiki/Category:Roman_Catholic_writers","/wiki/Category:French_Jesuits","/wiki/Category:French_military_chaplains","/wiki/Category:Franco-Prussian_War_chaplains","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Carlos+Sommervogel&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Carlos+Sommervogel","/wiki/Carlos_Sommervogel","/wiki/Talk:Carlos_Sommervogel","#","/wiki/Carlos_Sommervogel","/w/index.php?title=Carlos_Sommervogel&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Carlos_Sommervogel&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf8/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Carlos_Sommervogel","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Carlos_Sommervogel","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Carlos_Sommervogel&oldid=542413050","/w/index.php?title=Carlos_Sommervogel&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Carlos_Sommervogel&id=542413050","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Carlos+Sommervogel","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Carlos+Sommervogel&oldid=542413050&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Carlos_Sommervogel&printable=yes","//de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Sommervogel","//fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Sommervogel","//it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Sommervogel","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q554867#sitelinks","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Sommervogel","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf8/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=
