{"cursor":"4795","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":":Not to be confused with bacterial [[peptidoglycan]].\n\n, the major proteoglycan in cartilage, has 2316 amino acids ]]\n\n'Proteoglycans' are proteins that are heavily glycosylated. The basic\nproteoglycan unit consists of a \"core protein\" with one or more covalently\nattached glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chain(s). The point of attachment is a Ser residue to\nwhich the glycosaminoglycan is joined through a tetrasaccharide bridge (For\nexample: chondroitin sulfate-GlcA-Gal-Gal-Xyl-PROTEIN). The Ser residue is\ngenerally in the sequence -Ser-Gly-X-Gly- (where X can be any amino acid\nresidue), although not every protein with this sequence has an attached\nglycosaminoglycan. The chains are long, linear carbohydrate polymers that are\nnegatively charged under physiological conditions, due to the occurrence of\nsulfate and uronic acid groups. Proteoglycans occur in the connective tissue.\n","linknr":341,"url":"Proteoglycan","recorded":1362507593,"links":33,"instances":["biology","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Glycoproteins","Proteoglycans|"],"headings":["Types","Function","Synthesis","Proteoglycans and disease","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4b/PBB_Protein_ACAN_image.jpg/250px-PBB_Protein_ACAN_image.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cell","biology"],["vesicle","biology"]],"members":["vesicle","cell"],"related":["Cartilage","Amino_acid","Protein","Glycosylation","Protein","Covalent_bond","Glycosaminoglycan","Chondroitin_sulfate","Sulfate","Uronic_acid","Connective_tissue","Atomic_mass_units","Atomic_mass_unit","Proteins","Chondroitin_sulfate","Dermatan_sulfate","Decorin","Biglycan","Versican","Heparan_sulfate","Chondroitin_sulfate","Testican","Perlecan","Chondroitin_sulfate","Neurocan","Aggrecan","Cartilage","Keratan_sulfate","Fibromodulin","Lumican","Decorin","Biglycan","Fibromodulin","Lumican","Extracellular_matrix","Cell_(biology)","Hyaluronan","Collagen","Cations","Sodium","Potassium","Calcium","Water","Ribosome","Translocon","Rough_endoplasmic_reticulum","Golgi_apparatus","Enzyme","Serine","Vesicle_(biology)","Genetic_disorder","Mucopolysaccharidoses","Lysosome"]}
