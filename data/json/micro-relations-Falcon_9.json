It is currently\nthe only active rocket of the Falcon rocket family.\n\nBoth stages of this two-stage-to-orbit vehicle use liquid oxygen (LOX) and rocket-\ngrade kerosene (RP-1) propellants. The Falcon 9 can lift payloads of to low\nEarth orbit, and to geostationary transfer orbit, which places the Falcon 9\ndesign in the medium-lift range of launch systems.\n\nThe Falcon 9 and Dragon combination won a Commercial Resupply Services\n(CRS) contract from NASA to resupply the International Space Station under the\nCommercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) program. The first commercial\nresupply mission to the International Space Station launched on October 7,\n2012. Falcon 9 will also be human-rated for transporting astronauts under the\nCCiCap program.\n","linknr":1017,"url":"Falcon_9","recorded":1362267915,"links":70,"instances":["rocket","tv_series","rocket_engine","rocket_family","spacecraft","rocket_family","unit","rocket_family","rocket_engine_family"],"pdf":["http://www.spacex.com/Falcon9UsersGuide_2009.pdf","http://www.spacex.com/Falcon9UsersGuide_2009.pdf","http://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ast/media/The_Annual_Compendium_of_Commercial_Space_Transporation_2012.pdf","http://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ast/media/The_Annual_Compendium_of_Commercial_Space_Transporation_2012.pdf","http://www.spacex.com/Falcon9UsersGuide_2009.pdf","http://www.spacex.com/Falcon9UsersGuide_2009.pdf","http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/453605main_Commercial_Space_Minutes_4_26_2010.pdf","http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/586023main_8-3-11_NAFCOM.pdf","http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/586023main_8-3-11_NAFCOM.pdf","http://www.nasa.gov/centers/johnson/pdf/189228main_setc_nnj06ta26a.pdf","http://www.spacex.com/downloads/spacex-brochure.pdf"],"categories":["Falcon
