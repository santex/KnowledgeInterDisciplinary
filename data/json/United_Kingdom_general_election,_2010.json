The election took place in 650\nconstituencies across the United Kingdom under\nthe first-past-the-post system. None of the parties achieved the 326 seats\nneeded for an overall majority. The Conservative Party, led by David Cameron,\nwon the largest number of votes and seats but still fell twenty seats short.\nThis resulted in a hung parliament where no party was able to command a majority\nin the House of Commons. This was only the second general election since World\nWar II to return a hung parliament, the first being the February 1974 election.\nUnlike in 1974, the potential for a hung parliament had this time been widely\nconsidered and predicted and both the country and politicians were better\nprepared for the constitutional process that would follow such a result. The coalition government that was subsequently formed\nwas the first coalition in British history to eventuate directly from an\nelection outcome.\n\nCoalition talks began immediately between the Conservatives and the Liberal\nDemocrats and lasted for five days. There was an aborted attempt to put together\na Labour/Liberal Democrat coalition (although other smaller parties would have\nbeen required to make up the ten seats they lacked for a majority). To\nfacilitate this Gordon Brown announced on the evening of Monday 10 May that he\nwould resign as Labour Party leader. On Tuesday 11 May, Brown announced his\nresignation as Prime Minister, marking the end\nof 13 years of Labour government. This was accepted\nby Queen Elizabeth II, who then invited David Cameron to form a government in\nher name and become Prime Minister. Just after midnight on 12 May, the Liberal\nDemocrats emerged from a meeting of their Parliamentary party and Federal\nExecutive to announce that the coalition deal had been \"approved\noverwhelmingly\", sealing a coalition government of Conservatives and\nLiberal Democrats.\n\nNone of the three main party leaders had previously led a general election\ncampaign, a situation which had not occurred since the 1979 election. During the\ncampaign, the three main party leaders engaged in a series of televised debates,\nthe first such debates in a British general election campaign. The Liberal\nDemocrats achieved a breakthrough in opinion polls after the first debate in\nwhich their leader Nick Clegg was widely seen as the strongest performer.\nHowever, on polling day their share of the vote increased by only 1% over the\nprevious general election, and they suffered a net loss of five seats. Still,\nthis was the Liberal Democrats' largest popular vote since the party's creation,\nand they found themselves in a pivotal role in the formation of the new\ngovernment. The share of votes for parties other than Labour or the\nConservatives was 35% and was the largest since the 1918 general election. In\nterms of votes it was the most \"three-cornered\" election since 1923, and in\nterms of seats since 1929. The Green Party of England and Wales won its first\never seat in the Commons, and the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland also gained\nits first elected member. In 1973 Stratton Mills, elected as a Unionist,\ndefected to the Alliance Party but retired from Westminster at the next general\nelection. The result in one constituency, Oldham East and Saddleworth, was\nsubsequently declared void on petition due to illegal practices during the\ncampaign, the first such instance since 1910.\n","linknr":2074,"url":"United_Kingdom_general_election,_2010","recorded":1375081206,"links":["/w/index.php?title=United_Kingdom_general_election,_2010&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=United_Kingdom_general_election,_2010&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","#cite_note-ElecComm-1","/wiki/United_Kingdom","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/ae/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg/50px-Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png","/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_2005","/wiki/List_of_MPs_elected_in_the_United_Kingdom_general_election,_2005","/wiki/List_of_MPs_elected_in_the_United_Kingdom_general_election,_2010","/wiki/Next_United_Kingdom_general_election","/wiki/List_of_United_Kingdom_Parliament_constituencies","/wiki/House_of_Commons_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/File:David_Cameron_official.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/David_Cameron_official.jpg/106px-David_Cameron_official.jpg","/wiki/File:Gordon_Brown_official.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/26/Gordon_Brown_official.jpg/110px-Gordon_Brown_official.jpg","/wiki/File:Nick_Clegg.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/22/Nick_Clegg.jpg/104px-Nick_Clegg.jpg","/wiki/David_Cameron","/wiki/Gordon_Brown","/wiki/Nick_Clegg","/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)","/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)","/wiki/Liberal_Democrats","/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)_leadership_election,_2005","/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)_leadership_election,_2007","/wiki/Liberal_Democrats_leadership_election,_2007","/wiki/Witney_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Kirkcaldy_and_Cowdenbeath_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Sheffield_Hallam_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/Increase2.svg/11px-Increase2.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Decrease2.svg/11px-Decrease2.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Decrease2.svg/11px-Decrease2.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/Increase2.svg/11px-Increase2.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Decrease2.svg/11px-Decrease2.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/Increase2.svg/11px-Increase2.svg.png","/wiki/File:2010UKElectionMap.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/2010UKElectionMap.svg/325px-2010UKElectionMap.svg.png","#Results","/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Gordon_Brown","/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)","/wiki/David_Cameron","/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)","/wiki/House_of_Commons_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Elections_in_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/United_Kingdom_constituencies","#cite_note-thirsk-2","/wiki/First-past-the-post","/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)","/wiki/David_Cameron","/wiki/Hung_parliament","/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_February_1974","#cite_note-timesonline1-3","/wiki/United_Kingdom_coalition_government_(2010%E2%80%93present)","/wiki/Coalition_government","/wiki/Liberal_Democrats","/wiki/2010_United_Kingdom_government_formation","/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)","/wiki/Gordon_Brown","#cite_note-news.bbc.co.uk-4","/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom","#cite_note-news.bbc.co.uk-4","/wiki/Elizabeth_II","/wiki/David_Cameron","#cite_note-New_government_.E2.80.93_live_blog-5","#cite_note-LibDemApproveBBC-6","/wiki/United_Kingdom_coalition_government_(2010%E2%80%93present)","/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1979","/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election_debates,_2010","/wiki/Nick_Clegg","/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1918","/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1923","/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1929","/wiki/Green_Party_of_England_and_Wales","/wiki/Alliance_Party_of_Northern_Ireland","#cite_note-7","/wiki/Oldham_East_and_Saddleworth_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Oldham_East_and_Saddleworth_by-election,_2011","#Background","#MPs_declining_re-election","#Boundary_changes","#Contesting_parties","#Main_parties","#Other_parties","#Campaign","#April","#May","#Debates","#Polling","#Exit_poll","#Endorsements","#Newspaper_endorsements","#Results","#Election_petitions","#Fermanagh_and_South_Tyrone","#Oldham_East_and_Saddleworth","#Analysis","#Notable_results","#Demographics","#Northern_Irela
