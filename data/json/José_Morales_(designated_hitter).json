Listed at 5' 11\",\n187 lb., Morales batted and threw right-handed.\n\nMorales spent nine seasons in the minor leagues before turning as one of the\npremier pinch-hitters in major league history. One main problem held up his\nadvance: as a catcher, he was a defensive liability, leading four different\nminor leagues in errors. Indeed, during his majors career, he appeared in the\nfield in only 104 of his 733 total games, and he never collected more than 242\nat-bats during a regular season. He is often referred as a \"a catcher by trade\"\n(30 games), though first base was his most frequent defensive position in the\nmajors (67) and eventually at left field (7). He played much more at DH (265\ngames) than at any fielding position.\n\nMorales started playing sandlot baseball in his homeland before signing his\nfirst professional contract to play in Puerto Rico in late 1963. Over his two\ndecades-plus in the Puerto Rican Winter League, he collected a .290 batting\naverage (840-for-2,901) with 84 home runs and 467 RBI. He also led the league\nthree times in doubles and one in hits, and in the 1968â69 season he hit .402\nwith the San Juan Senators, to become one of 19 players to break the .400 line\nin the PRWL. But his 112 at-bats did not qualified him for the batting title, as\nhe was backing up teammate Johnny Bench.\n\nThe San Francisco Giants signed Morales in 1963. He spent two seasons in Class-A\n(1964â65) and three more at Double-A (1966â68). The Oakland Athletics obtained\nhim from the Giants in the 1968 minor league draft, and though Morales finally\nadvanced to Triple-A, he remained with the Iowa Oaks of the American Association\nfrom 1969 to 1971. Then he played on loan to Tidewater, the Mets' Triple-A\naffiliate, in 1972. Finally, he reached the majors in 1973 with the Athletics,\nplaying for them during part of the season before joining the Montreal Expos\n(1973â77), Minnesota Twins (1978â80), Baltimore Orioles (1981â82) and Los\nAngeles Dodgers (1982â84).\n\nIn 1975, Morales enjoyed his first solid season, batting .301 in 93 games with\nMontreal. For the first of four times, he led the majors pinch-hitters with 15\nhits in 51 at-bats (.294). Then, in 1976 he posted a career-high .316 (50-for-\n158) as he went on to set his pinch-hit single-season record of 25, breaking the\nprevious mark of 24 established by Dave Philley in 1961 and tied by Vic\nDavalillo in 1970. Morales' record stood until John Vander Wal of the Colorado\nRockies had 28 in 1995.\n\nAfter Minnesota acquired Morales, he became an effective part-time designated\nhitter and his pinch-hitting skills remained intact. In 1978 he hit .314 for the\nTwins and posted an American League leading with 15 pinch-hits. Morales faded\nthe next season (.267), but he rebounded in 1980 hitting .303 with eight home\nruns (a career-high) as his 13 pinch-hits again led league. Again in the\nNational League, he appeared exclusively as a pinch-hitter with the Dodgers in\n1982 and finished 9-for-30 (.300). He saw his only post-season action in 1983,\ngoing hitless in two pinch at-bats as Los Angeles lost the NL Championship\nSeries to the Philadelphia Phillies.\n\nIn a 12-season career, Morales was a .287 hitter (375-for-1305) with 26 home\nruns and 207 RBI, including 126 runs, 68 doubles and six triples, hitting .300\nfive times overall. He struck out in only 13% of his plate appearances (182-for-\n1305), a testament to his skill as a contact hitter.\n\nFollowing his playing career, Morales has worked as a batting instructor for the\nBaltimore Orioles, Cleveland Indians, and Florida Marlins organizations. He\ncurrently resides in Montverde, Florida.\n","linknr":156,"url":"José_Morales_(designated_hitter)","recorded":1375076666,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Jos%C3%A9_Morales_(designated_hitter)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Jos%C3%A9_Morales_(designated_hitter)&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Morales_(disambiguation)","/wiki/Designated_hitter","/wiki/Frederiksted,_U.S._Virgin_Islands","/wiki/St._Croix,_U.S._Virgin_Islands","/wiki/Oakland_Athletics","/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers","/wiki/Batting_average","/wiki/Home_run","/wiki/Run_batted_in","/wiki/Oakland_Athletics","/wiki/Montreal_Expos","/wiki/Minnesota_Twins","/wiki/Baltimore_Orioles","/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers","/wiki/Frederiksted,_U.S._Virgin_Islands","/wiki/St._Croix,_U.S._Virgin_Islands","/wiki/Designated_hitter","/wiki/Major_League_Baseball","/wiki/1973_in_baseball","/wiki/1984_in_baseball","/wiki/Minor_league_baseball","/wiki/Pinch-hitter","/wiki/Catcher","/wiki/Error_(baseball)","/wiki/At-bat","/wiki/First_base","/wiki/Left_field","/wiki/Puerto_Rico","/wiki/Puerto_Rican_Professional_Baseball_League","/wiki/Batting_average","/wiki/Home_run","/wiki/Run_batted_in","/wiki/Double_(baseball)","/wiki/Hit_(baseball)","/wiki/At-bat","/wiki/Johnny_Bench","/wiki/San_Francisco_Giants","/wiki/Oakland_Athletics","/wiki/Iowa_Cubs","/wiki/American_Association_(20th_century)","/wiki/Norfolk_Tides","/wiki/New_York_Mets","/wiki/Montreal_Expos","/wiki/Minnesota_Twins","/wiki/Baltimore_Orioles","/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers","/wiki/Dave_Philley","/wiki/Vic_Davalillo","/wiki/John_Vander_Wal","/wiki/Colorado_Rockies","/wiki/American_League","/wiki/National_League","/wiki/National_League_Championship_Series","/wiki/Philadelphia_Phillies","/wiki/Triple_(baseball)","/wiki/Strikeout","/wiki/Cleveland_Indians","/wiki/Florida_Marlins","/wiki/Montverde,_Florida","/w/index.php?title=Jos%C3%A9_Morales_(designated_hitter)&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Pinch_hitter","/wiki/List_of_players_from_Virgin_Islands_in_Major_League_Baseball","/w/index.php?title=Jos%C3%A9_Morales_(designated_hitter)&action=edit&section=2","http://home.roadrunner.com/~vibaseball/morales.html","http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/m/moraljo01.shtml","http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=1009139","http://www.thebaseballcube.com/profile.asp?P=jose-morales","http://www.baseballlibrary.com/ballplayers/player.php?name=Jose_Morales_1944","http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/M/Pmoraj001.htm","http://www.bioproj.sabr.org/bioproj.cfm?a=v&v=l&bid=1648&pid=9930","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","/wiki/Frederiksted,_U.S._Virgin_Islands","/wiki/St._Croix,_U.S._Virgin_Islands","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=José_Morales_(designated_hitter)&oldid=544873197","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1944_births","/wiki/Category:Living_people","/wiki/Category:Baltimore_Orioles_players","/wiki/Category:Los_Angeles_Dodgers_players","/wiki/Category:Minnesota_Twins_players","/wiki/Category:Montreal_Expos_players","/wiki/Category:Oakland_Athletics_players","/wiki/Category:Major_League_Baseball_designated_hitters","/wiki/Category:Major_League_Baseball_first_basemen","/wiki/Category:Major_League_Baseball_hitting_coaches","/wiki/Category:Major_League_Baseball_players_from_the_United_States_Virgin_Islands","/wiki/Category:San_Francisco_Giants_coaches","/wiki/Category:Cleveland_Indians_coaches","/wiki/Category:Florida_Marlins_coaches","/wiki/Category:People_from_Saint_Croix,_U.S._Virgin_Islands","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Jos%C3%A9+Morales+%28designated+hitter%29&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Jos%C3%A9+Morales+%28designated+hitter%29","/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Morales_(designated_hitter)","/wiki/Talk:Jos%C3%A9_Morales_(designated_hitter)","#","/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Morales_(designated_hitter)","/w/index.php?title=Jos%C3%A9_Morales_(designated_hitter)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Jos%C3%A9_Morales_(designated_hitter)&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current
