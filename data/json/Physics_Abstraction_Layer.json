It is similar to a physics engine\nwrapper, however it is far more flexible providing extended abilities. PAL is\nfree software, released under the BSD license.\n\nPAL is a high-level interface for low-level physics engines used in games,\nsimulation systems, and other 3D applications. It supports a number of dynamic\nsimulation methodologies, including rigid body, liquids, soft body, ragdoll and\nvehicle dynamics. PAL features a simple C++ API, intuitive objects (e.g. Solids,\nJoints, Actuators, Sensors, Materials), and COLLADA, Scythe Physics Editor and\nXML-based file storage.\n\nThe Physics Abstraction Layer provides a number of benefits over directly using\na physics engine:\n* Flexibility - It allows developers to switch between different physics\n  engines to see which engine provides their needs, as well as quickly testing\n  a new engine.\n* Portable - Developers are able to use the physics engine which provides the\n  best performance for different platforms, and are able to write platform\n  independent code.\n* Security - If a middleware provider is acquired by another company or\n  development is discontinued, developers can switch engines.\n* Scalable - The abstraction layer allows developers to run their code on\n  handheld console platforms up to supercomputers.\n* Ease of use - Implementation details of the physics engine are abstracted,\n  providing a cleaner interface to the developer.\n* Benchmarking - Researchers can directly compare the performance of various\n  dynamic simulations systems.\n\nPAL is designed with a pluggable abstract factory allowing code to be written\nand compiled once and allowing runtime selection of different physics engines,\nas well as feature upgrades.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Physics_Abstraction_Layer","recorded":1375087893,"links":[],"instances":["software","computing","software","software","computing"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Computer physics engines"],"headings":["Supported engines","Supported file formats","Benchmark","See also","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["benchmark","computing"],["plug-in","computing"],["bullet","software"],["opal","software"],["havok","software"]],"members":["bullet","opal","havok","benchmark"],"related":["Cross-platform","Middleware","BSD_licenses","Open_source","Cross-platform","Physical_simulation","API","Physics_engine","Wrapper_pattern","Dynamical_simulation","Rigid_body_dynamics","Computational_fluid_dynamics","Soft_body_dynamics","Ragdoll_physics","Vehicle_dynamics","C++","Application_programming_interface","Rigid_body","Multibody_system","Actuator","Sensor","Friction","COLLADA","Scythe_Physics_Editor","Extensible_Markup_Language","Physics_engines","Porting","Middleware","Scalability","Video_game_console","Benchmark_(computing)","Dynamical_simulation","Plug-in_(computing)","Abstract_Factory_pattern","Physics_engine","Physics_engine","Box2D","Bullet_(software)","Newton_Game_Dynamics","Open_Dynamics_Engine","PhysX","Meqon","Tokamak_physics_engine","COLLADA","Scythe_Physics_Editor","Extensible_Markup_Language","Physics_engine","COLLADA","OPAL_(software)","Open_source","Cross-platform","Application_programming_interface","Havok_(software)","Middleware","Software_development_kit","PhysX","Real-time_computing","Middleware","Software_development_kit","AGEIA","AGEIA","Physics_processing_unit","Physics_Processing_Unit"]}
