Examples\ninclude the Visna-Maedi virus, in the genus Lentivirus (family Retroviridae),\nthat causes encephalitis and chronic pneumonitis in sheep, and subacute\nsclerosing panencephalitis which is apparently caused by the measles\nvirus.<ref>PubMed Health [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0002392\n\"Subacute Sclerosing Panencephalitis\"].
