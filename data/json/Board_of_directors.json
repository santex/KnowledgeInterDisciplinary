Other names include\n'[[board of governors]]', 'board of managers', '[[board of regents]]',\n'board of trustees', and 'board of visitors'. It is often simply referred to\nas \"the board\".\n\nA board's activities are determined by the powers, duties, and responsibilities\ndelegated to it or conferred on it by an authority outside itself. These matters\nare typically detailed in the organization's bylaws. The bylaws commonly also\nspecify the number of members of the board, how they are to be chosen, and when\nthey are to meet.\n\nIn an organization with voting members, e.g., a professional society, the board\nacts on behalf of, and is subordinate to, the organization's full assembly,\nwhich usually chooses the members of the board. In a stock corporation, the\nboard is elected by the stockholders and is the highest authority in the\nmanagement of the corporation. In a non-stock corporation with no general voting\nmembership, e.g., a typical university, the board is the supreme governing body\nof the institution; its members are sometimes chosen by the board\nitself.\n\nTypical duties of boards of directors include:\n\n* governing the organization by establishing broad policies and objectives;\n* selecting, appointing, supporting and reviewing the performance of the chief\n  executive;\n* ensuring the availability of adequate financial resources;\n* approving annual budgets;\n* accounting to the stakeholders for the organization's performance;\n* setting the salaries and compensation of company management.\n\nThe legal responsibilities of boards and board members vary with the nature of\nthe organization, and with the jurisdiction within which it operates. For\ncompanies with publically trading stock, these responsibilities are typically\nmuch more rigorous and complex than for those of other types.\n\nTypically the board chooses one of its members to be the [[chairman]], who holds\nwhatever title is specified in the bylaws.\n","linknr":505,"url":"Board_of_directors","recorded":1362890649,"links":54,"instances":["law","corporate","law","government","meeting","law","law"],"pdf":["http://legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/Stat0181.pdf","http://legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/Stat0181.pdf","http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~eofek/PhD/papers/SY_CEO_JF.pdf","http://faculty.fullerton.edu/jyang/Courses/fin332/Literature/governance%20rule%20result.pdf","http://www.klgates.com/files/Publication/f44a6446-4d3a-4847-a157-319c05d9667b/Presentation/PublicationAttachment/3900b2fd-2183-44e8-82d7-41bd4366f0f6/CompensationCommitteeStructure.pdf"],"categories":["Business law","Corporate governance","Corporations law","Management","Committees","Corporate directors|"],"headings":["Directors","Process","Non-corporate boards","Corporations","See also","Notes","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["company","law"],["stakeholder","corporate"],["agenda","meeting"],["cabinet","government"],["articles_of_association","law"],["agency","law"],["declaration","law"],["company","law"]],"members":["declaration","stakeholder","agency","cabinet","agenda","company","articles_of_association"],"related":["Company_(law)","Organization","Bylaws","Stock_corporation","Stockholders","Authority","Non-stock_corporation","Chief_executive","Public_corporations","Shareholder","Stakeholder_(corporate)","Chief_Executive_Officer","Chairman","Chief_Financial_Officer","Executive_Vice_President","Executive_director","Interlocking_directorate","Board_process","Board_package","Agenda_(meeting)","Action_items","National_Association_of_Corporate_Directors","McKinsey_&_Company","The_Board_Group","Types_of_business_entity","Board-only","Public_company","Shareholder","Dividend","Employee_stock_option","Executive_pay","Shareholders","General_meeting","Public_company","De_facto","Shareholder_activism","Career","Tiffany_&_Co.","European_Union","Asia","Supervisory_board","Management","Governance","Conflict_of_interest","Cabinet_(government)","Civil_service","Court_of_Appeal_of_England_and_Wales","Articles_of_Association_(law)","Judicial_functions_of_the_House_of_Lords","Table_A","Table_A","Proxy_statement","Nominating_committee","Inside_director","Golden_parachute","Drexel_University","Poison_pill","Financial_crisis_of_2007–2010","Quorum","Common_law","Ostensible_authority","Royal_British_Bank_v_Turquand","Corporate_benefit","Stockholder","Fiduciary","Agency_(law)","Trustee","Judicial_Committee_of_the_Privy_Council","Stock","Discretion","Contract","Conflict_of_interest","Robert_Rolfe,_1st_Baron_Cranworth","Corporate_opportunity","Going_concern","Share_capital","Companies_Act_2006","Injunction","Declaration_(law)","Damages","Rescission","Contract","Account_of_profits","Corporate_benefit","Companies_Act_2006","Companies_Act_1985","Sarbanes–Oxley_Act","Stock_exchange","Internal_control","Independent_director","Fortune_500","Swiss_referendum_\"against_corporate_Rip-offs\"_of_2013","Agency_cost","Alternate_director","Board_of_governors","Board_of_regents","Celebrity_board_director","Chairman","Chief_executive_officer","Company_(law)","Corporation","Corporate_governance","Corporate_title","Executive_compensation","Finance_director","Interlocking_directorate","Managing_director","Non-executive_director","Parliamentary_procedure_in_the_corporate_world","President","Say_on_pay","Supervisory_board"]}
