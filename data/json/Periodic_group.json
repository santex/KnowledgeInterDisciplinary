{"cursor":"3489","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nIn group theory, a 'periodic group' or a 'torsion group' is a group in which\neach element has finite order. All finite groups are periodic. The concept of a\nperiodic group should not be confused with that of a cyclic group, although all\nfinite cyclic groups are periodic.\n\nThe 'exponent' of a periodic group G is the least common multiple, if it exists,\nof the orders of the elements of G. Any finite group has an exponent: it is a\ndivisor of |G|.\n\nBurnside's problem is a classical question, which deals with the relationship\nbetween periodic groups and finite groups, if we assume only that G is a finitely-\ngenerated group. The question is whether specifying an exponent forces\nfiniteness (to which the answer is 'no', in general).\n\nExamples of infinite periodic groups include the additive group of the ring of\npolynomials over a finite field, and the quotient group of the rationals by the\nintegers, as well as their direct summands, the PrÃ¼fer groups. Another example\nis the union of all dihedral groups. None of these examples has a finite\ngenerating set, and any periodic linear group with a finite generating set is\nfinite. Explicit examples of finitely generated infinite periodic groups were\nconstructed by Golod, based on joint work with Shafarevich, and by Aleshin and\nGrigorchuk using automata.\n","linknr":125,"url":"Periodic_group","recorded":1362565464,"links":20,"instances":["algebra","mathematics","group_theory","mathematics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Group theory"],"headings":["Mathematical logic","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/math/1/c/a/1ca50609ee1ced5ce7821e1d2690ce09.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/Rubik%27s_cube_v3.svg/40px-Rubik%27s_cube_v3.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["group","mathematics"],["element","mathematics"],["order","group_theory"],["torsion","algebra"]],"members":["torsion","group","order","element"],"related":["Group_theory","Group_(mathematics)","Element_(mathematics)","Finite_set","Order_(group_theory)","Cyclic_group","Least_common_multiple","Finite_group","Burnside's_problem","Finite_group","Finitely-generated_group","Prüfer_group","Dihedral_group","Linear_group","Golod-Shafarevich_theorem","Automata_theory","First-order_logic","Logical_disjunction","Torsion_(algebra)","Torsion_subgroup","Torsion-free_abelian_group","Jordan–Schur_theorem","Golod–Shafarevich_theorem","PlanetMath"]}
