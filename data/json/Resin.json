{"cursor":"9274","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n cone showing flecks of resin as used in the mummification of Egyptian\n Pharaohs.]] 'Resin' in the most specific use of the term is a hydrocarbon\n secretion of many plants, particularly coniferous trees. Resins are valued for\n their chemical properties and associated uses, such as the production of\n varnishes, adhesives and food glazing agents. They are also prized as an\n important source of raw materials for organic synthesis, and as constituents of\n incense and perfume. Plant resins have a very long history that was documented\n in ancient Greece by Theophrastus, in ancient Rome by Pliny the Elder, and\n especially in the resins known as frankincense and myrrh, prized in ancient\n Egypt.  These were highly prized substances, and\n required as incense in some religious rites. Amber is a hard fossilized resin\n from ancient trees.\n","linknr":327,"url":"Resin","recorded":1362373095,"links":67,"instances":["resin","chemistry","gum","bowling","plant_resin"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Resins|","Papermaking"],"headings":["Overview","Chemistry","Derivatives","Uses","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c4/Cedar_of_Lebanon_cone.JPG/150px-Cedar_of_Lebanon_cone.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6e/Resin_with_insect_%28aka%29.jpg/200px-Resin_with_insect_%28aka%29.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6a/R%C3%A9sine.jpg/200px-R%C3%A9sine.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/Araucaria_Resin.JPG/200px-Araucaria_Resin.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/14/Frankincense_2005-12-31.jpg/220px-Frankincense_2005-12-31.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/12px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["sublimation","chemistry"],["mastic","plant_resin"],["hook","bowling"],["mastic","plant_resin"],["pitch","resin"],["kino","gum"]],"members":["pitch","sublimation","kino","hook","mastic"],"related":["Mummification","Pharaoh","Hydrocarbon","Secretion","Pinophyta","Varnish","Adhesive","Glazing_agent","Organic_synthesis","Incense","Perfume","Theophrastus","Pliny_the_Elder","Frankincense","Myrrh","Incense","Amber","Shellac","Plant_sap","Latex","Mucilage","Natural_phenol","Parasitoids","Timber_Press","Lacquer","Vitreous_enamel","Synthetic_resin","Epoxy_resin","Thermosetting_plastic","Terpene","Alpha-Pinene","Pinene","Carene","Sabinene","Limonene","Terpinolene","Sesquiterpene","Longifolene","Caryophyllene","Cadinene","Resin_acid","Fractional_distillation","Jeffrey_Pine","Gray_Pine","Heptane","Isomer","Octane_rating","Petrol","Ponderosa_Pine","Benzoic_acid","Cinnamic_acid","Natural_gum","Gum_resin","Essential_oil","Copal","Gum-digger","Rosin","Ether","Sublimation_(chemistry)","Resin_acid","Oxidation","Alkali","Resin_soap","Abietic_acid","Plicatic_acid","Pimaric_acid","Galipot","Trimellitic_acid","Isophthalic_acid","Terebic_acid","Dammar","Mastic_(plant_resin)","Sandarac","Frankincense","Elemi","Turpentine","Copaiba","Ammoniacum","Asafoetida","Gamboge","Myrrh","Scammony","Incense","String_instrument","Violin","Rebec","Erhu","Sarangi","Eva_Hesse","Ten-pin_bowling","Hook_(bowling)","Resin_extraction","Mastic_(plant_resin)","Pistacia_lentiscus","Pitch_(resin)","Kino_(gum)","Biodegradable","Resin_casting","Polyresin"]}
