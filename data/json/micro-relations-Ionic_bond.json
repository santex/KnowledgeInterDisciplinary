Sodium loses its outer\n electron to give it a stable electron configuration, and this electron enters\n the fluorine atom exothermically. The oppositely charged ions are then\n attracted to each other.]] An 'ionic bond' is a type of chemical bond formed\n through an electrostatic attraction between two oppositely charged ions. Ionic\n bonds are formed between a cation, which is usually a metal, and an anion,\n which is usually a nonmetal. Pure ionic bonding cannot exist: all ionic\n compounds have some degree of covalent bonding. Thus, an ionic bond is\n considered a bond where the ionic character is greater than the covalent\n character. The larger the difference in electronegativity between the two atoms\n involved in the bond, the more ionic (polar) the bond is. Bonds with partially\n ionic and partially covalent character are called polar covalent bonds. Ionic\n bonding is a form of noncovalent bonding.\n\nIonic compounds conduct electricity when molten or in solution, but not as a\nsolid. They generally have a high melting point and tend to be soluble in water.\n","linknr":284,"url":"Ionic_bond","recorded":1362485747,"links":67,"instances":["electrostatics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Chemical bonding","Ions","Supramolecular chemistry"],"headings":["Formation","Structure","Bond strength","Polarization effects","Comparison with covalent bonds","Electrical conductivity","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/NaF.gif/300px-NaF.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/Ionic_bonding.svg/225px-Ionic_bonding.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["polarization","electrostatics"]],"members":["polarization"],"related":["Fluorine","Sodium_fluoride","Electron","Electron_configuration","Exothermic","Chemical_bond","Electrostatic","Ion","Cation","Metal","Nonmetal","Covalent_bond","Electronegativity","Polar_covalent_bond","Noncovalent_bonding","Electricity","Melting_point","Solubility","Ionization_energy","Electron_affinity","Noble_gases","S-block","P-block","Electron_configuration","D-block","F-block","Table_salt","Sodium_chloride","Sodium","Chlorine","Electron","Fluorine","Lithium_fluoride","Valence_electron","Isoelectronicity","Helium","Neon","Electronegativity","Ionic_compound","Sodium_chloride","Alkali_metals","Magnesium_oxide","Enthalpy","Lattice_energy","Lattice_energy","Born-Haber_cycle","Born-Landé_equation","Electrostatic_potential_energy","Madelung_constant","Born-Landé_equation","Born-Haber_cycle","Ion","Crystal_lattice","Sphere","Fajans'_rules","Polarization_(electrostatics)","Atomic_nucleus","Electrical_charge","Ionic_polarization","Covalent_bond","Molecular_geometry","VSEPR","Close-packing","Electron_density","Electronegativity","Polar_covalent_bond","Fast_ion_conductor","Coulomb's_law","Ionic_potential","Linear_combination_of_atomic_orbitals","Orbital_hybridization","Chemical_polarity"]}
