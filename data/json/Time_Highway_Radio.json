Taken over by Astro\nRadio in 2005 (to broadcast Tamil and Malay (East Coast) programming), the\nstation was originally the initiative and for some time the flagship station of\nthe TIME Engineering conglomerate, and as the name suggests the station was\ntargeted at road/highway users with traffic reports and entertainment. It\nheralded a new era in the Malaysian broadcasting scene as it was the first\nstation to provide an alternative to government-owned Radio Televisyen Malaysia\nradio stations and it marked the beginning of a stiff competition for the\nMalaysian English speaking audience.\n","linknr":212,"url":"Time_Highway_Radio","recorded":1362540596,"links":12,"instances":["telecommunications"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Radio stations in Malaysia"],"headings":["Background","Stiff Competition and Decline","Current","Frequency","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e1/THR_FM.png/200px-THR_FM.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["transmission","telecommunications"]],"members":["transmission"],"related":["Bukit_Jalil","Kuala_Lumpur","Malaysia","Contemporary_hit_radio","Astro_Radio","Malaysia","Radio_station","Kuala_Lumpur","Astro_Radio","Traffic_report","Radio_Televisyen_Malaysia","English_language","FM_broadcasting","MHz","Transmitter","Selangor","Pahang","Studio","Radio_Televisyen_Malaysia","Angkasapuri","Frequency","Malay_language","Klasik_Nasional_FM","Transmission_(telecommunications)","Disk_jockey","Negeri_Sembilan","Melaka","Johor","Singapore","Best_104","Traxx_FM","Johor_Corporation","Kuala_Lumpur_Middle_Ring_Road_1","Perak","Penang","Kedah","Perlis","Best_104","Klang_Valley","Astro_Radio","Hitz.fm","Best_104","Astro_Radio","Advertising","Genre","Best_104","Best_104","Chinese_language","Astro_Radio","Nielsen_Company","Klang_Valley","Perak","Tanjung_Malim","Slim_River","Trolak","Bidor","Tapah","Johor_Bahru","Singapore","Langkawi","Kedah","Perlis","Langkawi","Penang","Ipoh","Perak","Cameron_Highlands","Taiping","Gerik","Negeri_Sembilan","Bera","Teriang","Kemayan","Mengkarak","Malacca","Johor","Pahang","Bandar_Muadzam_Shah","Bandar_Tun_Abdul_Razak","Pahang","Bentong","Temerloh","Raub","Kuala_Lipis","Lurah_Bilut","Mentakab","Lanchang","Sungai_Ruan","Benta","Chenor","Jerantut","Jengka","Maran,_Pahang","Kota_Bharu","Pasir_Mas","Tumpat","Pasir_Puteh","Machang,_Kelantan","Tanah_Merah,_Malaysia","Kuala_Krai","Besut","Kuantan","Pekan","Maran,_Pahang","Jengka","Kemaman","Kijal","Kemasik","Kerteh","Paka","Kuala_Terengganu"]}
