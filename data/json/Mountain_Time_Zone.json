The clock time in this zone is\nbased on the mean solar time at the 105th meridian west of the Greenwich\nObservatory. In the U.S., the exact specification for the location of time\nzones and the dividing lines between zones is set forth in the Code of\nFederal Regulations at 49 CFR 71. The boundary between Central and\nMountain time zones is set forth at 49 CFR 71.7, and the boundary\nbetween Mountain and Pacific time zones is set forth at 49 CFR\n71.9. |name=name|group=lower-alpha}}\n\nIn the United States and Canada, this time zone is generically called 'Mountain\nTime' ('MT'). Specifically, it is 'Mountain Standard Time' ('MST') when\nobserving standard time (winter), and 'Mountain Daylight Time' ('MDT') when\nobserving daylight saving time (spring, summer, fall). The term refers to the\nfact that the Rocky Mountains, which range from northwestern Canada to the US\nstate of New Mexico, are located almost entirely in the time zone. In Mexico,\nthis time zone is known as the 'Pacific Zone'.\n\nIn the USA and Canada, the Mountain Time Zone is one hour ahead of the Pacific\nTime Zone and one hour behind the Central Time Zone.\n\nIn some areas, starting in 2007, the local time changes from MST to MDT at\n2:00am MST to 3:00am MDT on the second Sunday in March and returns at 2:00am MDT\nto 1:00am MST on the first Sunday in November.\n\nSonora, Mexico and most of Arizona, United States do not observe daylight saving\ntime, and during the spring, summer, and autumn months they are on the same time\nas Pacific Daylight Time. The Navajo Nation, most of which lies\nwithin Arizona, does observe daylight saving time, although the Hopi Nation, as\nwell as some Arizona state offices lying within the Navajo Nation, do not.\n\nThe largest city in the Mountain Time Zone is Phoenix, Arizona, and its\nmetropolitan area is the largest in the zone. The largest city that observes\nMountain Daylight Time is Denver, Colorado.\n\n TV broadcasting in\nthe Mountain Time Zone is typically tape-delayed one hour, so that shows match\nthe broadcast times of the Central Time Zone (i.e. prime time begins at 7:00 pm\nMT following the same order of programming as the Central time zone).\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Mountain_Time_Zone","recorded":1372154929,"links":[],"instances":["state","idaho"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Time zones","Time in Canada","Time in Mexico","Time zones in the United States"],"headings":["Canada","Mexico","United States","See also","Notes","References","Sources"],"image":[],"tags":[["chihuahua","state"],["salmon_river","idaho"]],"members":["chihuahua","salmon_river"],"related":["North_America","Greenwich_Mean_Time","UTC−07","Daylight_saving_time","UTC−06","Mean_solar_time","105th_meridian_west","Greenwich_Observatory","Time_zone","Code_of_Federal_Regulations","United_States","Canada","Standard_time","Rocky_Mountains","New_Mexico","Mexico","Pacific_Time_Zone","Central_Time_zone","Sonora","Mexico","Arizona","United_States","Pacific_Daylight_Time","Navajo_Nation","Hopi_Reservation","Phoenix,_Arizona","Phoenix_metropolitan_area","Denver","Colorado","Central_Time_Zone","Central_Time_Zone","Canadian_provinces","Alberta","Northwest_Territories","Tungsten,_Northwest_Territories","Kitikmeot_Region,_Nunavut","Nunavut","British_Columbia","Saskatchewan","Lloydminster","Mexican_states","Baja_California_Sur","Chihuahua_(state)","Nayarit","Bahía_de_Banderas","Sonora","Daylight_saving_time","Sinaloa","Revillagigedo_Islands","Colima","Isla_Socorro","San_Benedicto_Island","Roca_Partida","U.S._states","Arizona","Daylight_saving_time","Navajo_Nation","Colorado","Idaho","Salmon_River_(Idaho)","Kansas","Sherman_County,_Kansas","Wallace_County,_Kansas","Greeley_County,_Kansas","Hamilton_County,_Kansas","Cheyenne_County,_Kansas","Morton_County,_Kansas","Stanton_County,_Kansas","Montana","Nebraska","Nevada","West_Wendover,_Nevada","Jackpot,_Nevada","New_Mexico","North_Dakota","Missouri_River","Oregon","Malheur_County,_Oregon","South_Dakota","Texas","Hudspeth_County","El_Paso_County,_Texas","Utah","Wyoming","Kenton,_Oklahoma","Oklahoma_Panhandle","Culberson_County,_Texas","Effects_of_time_on_North_American_broadcasting"]}
