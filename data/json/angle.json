In\nparticular, in spherical geometry, the spherical angles are defined, using arcs\nof great circles instead of rays.\n\n'Angle' is also used to designate the measure of an angle or of a rotation. This\nmeasure is the ratio of the length of a circular arc to its radius. In the case\nof a geometric angle, the arc is centered at the vertex and delimited by the\nsides. In the case of a rotation, the arc is centered at the center of the\nrotation and delimited by any other point and its image by the rotation.\n\nThe word angle comes from the Latin word angulus, meaning \"a corner\". The word\nangulus is a diminutive, of which the primitive form, angus, does not occur in\nLatin. Cognate words are the Greek (ankylοs), meaning \"crooked, curved,\" and the\nEnglish word \"ankle\". Both are connected with the Proto-Indo-European root *ank-\n, meaning \"to bend\" or\n\"bow\".<ref>{{citation|last=Slocum|first=Jonathan|year=2007\n|url=http://www.utexas.edu/cola/centers/lrc/ielex/X/P0089.html\n|title=Preliminary Indo-European lexicon&nbsp;— Pokorny PIE data |accessdate=2\nFeb., 2010|publisher=}}</ref> <!--Note: ἀγκύλος rather than ἀνκύλος is correct,\nthe γκ is a digraph pronounced [ŋk].-->\n\nEuclid defines a plane angle as the inclination to each other, in a plane, of\ntwo lines which meet each other, and do not lie straight with respect to each\nother. According to Proclus an angle must be either a quality or a quantity, or\na relationship. The first concept was used by Eudemus, who regarded an angle as\na deviation from a straight line; the second by Carpus of Antioch, who regarded\nit as the interval or space between the intersecting lines; Euclid adopted the\nthird concept, although his definitions of right, acute, and obtuse angles are\ncertainly quantitative.<ref>; </ref><!-- This paragraph is quoted from EB1911,\nbut its source seems to be Heath.-->\n","title":"angle","headings":["Measuring angles","Identifying angles","Types of angles","Angles between curves","Dot product and generalisation","Inner product","Angles between subspaces","Angles in Riemannian geometry","Angles in geography and astronomy","See also","Notes","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["3: Sexagesimal","3: Astronomy","2: Euclidean_space","2: Spherical_angle","2: Great_circle","2: Navigation","2: Tangent","2: Inner_product_space","2: Cut-the-knot","1: List_of_XML_and_HTML_character_entity_references","1: Geometry","1: Endpoint","1: Euclidean_plane","1: Non-Euclidean_geometry","1: Spherical_geometry","1: Radius","1: Latin","1: Cognate","1: Greek_language","1: English_language","1: Ankle","1: Proto-Indo-European_language","1: Euclid","1: Proclus","1: Eudemus_of_Rhodes","1: Straight_line","1: Carpus_of_Antioch","1: Spiral","1: Theta","1: Circular_arc","1: Dimensional_analysis","1: Circumference","1: Euclid's_Elements","1: Babylonians","1: J.H._Jeans","1: Trigonometric_function","1: SI","1: Byte","1: Geographic_coordinate_system","1: Ballistics","1: Kilometre","1: Centi","1: Triangulation","1: Milliradian","1: NATO","1: Nautical_mile","1: Eratosthenes","1: Babylonian_mathematics","1: Cartesian_coordinate_system","1: X-axis","1: Y-axis","1: Anticlockwise","1: Clockwise","1: Sine","1: Rational_geometry","1: Greek_letter","1: Pi","1: Explementary_angle","1: Simple_polygon","1: Convex_and_concave_polygons","1: Euclidean_geometry","1: Triangle","1: Quadrilateral","1: Polygon","1: Negative_number","1: Surface","1: Polyhedron","1: Curve","1: Dot_product","1: Normal_vector","1: Skew_lines","1: Hilbert_space","1: Principal_angles","1: Riemannian_geometry","1: Metric_tensor","1: Geography","1: Latitude","1: Longitude","1: Equator","1: Greenwich_meridian","1: Celestial_sphere","1: Star","1: Earth","1: Angular_diameter","1: Full_moon","1: Small-angle_formula","1: Bisection#Angle_bisector","1: Angular_velocity","1: Astrological_aspect","1: Central_angle","1: Clock_angle_problem","1: Complementary_angles","1: Great_circle_distance","1: Hyperbolic_angle","1: Inscribed_angle","1: Irrational_angle","1: Protractor","1: Solid_angle","1: Supplementary_angles"]}
