{"cursor":"4603","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The 'Rhenish Missionary Society' (Rhenish of the river Rhine) was one of the\nlargest missionary societies in Germany. Formed from smaller missions founded\nas far back as 1799, the Society was amalgamated on 23 September 1828, and\nits first missionaries were ordained and sent off to South Africa by the end\nof the year.\n\nThe London Missionary Society was already active in the area, and a closer\nworking relationship was formed with them. The Society established its first\nmission station in the Cederberg in 1829, named Wupperthal, and predated the\nnaming of the German city by 100 years.\n\nVery soon, the missionaries started migrating north through the barren and\ninhospitable south-western Africa. Here they encountered various local tribes\nsuch as the Herero, Nama and Damara, and were frequently in the middle of wars\nbetween them. The missionaries tried to broker peace deals between the tribes,\nand for this reason was later seen as political assets by the tribes.\n\nAround the same time, debate started in Germany regarding its colonial empire,\nwith the activities of the RMS in distant Africa fanning imaginations. The\nunclaimed area to the north of the Cape Colony was proclaimed German South West\nAfrica in 1880, but they quickly ran into numerous problems, since Germany was\ninexperienced at colonization. The Herero and Namaqua Genocide during 19041907\nproved to be the nadir of their rule, and combined with the effects of World War\nI, Germany was unable to maintain a foothold so far from home. South Africa\nannexed the area in 1915, renaming it South West Africa. During this time,\nmissionaries' reactions ranged from compassion and help for the local tribes, to\npatriotism and support of colonial interests.\n\nDuring the 20th century, the Society focused on its work in southern Africa. The\nSociety ultimately amalgamated all of its mission stations in South Africa into\nthe Dutch Reformed Church, except for Wupperthal which chose to join the\nMoravian Church. The mission stations in Namibia became part of the Evangelical\nLutheran Church there.\n\nIn 1971, the Rhenish Mission and the Bethel Mission were combined into the\nVereinte Evangelische Mission.\n","linknr":171,"url":"Rhenish_Missionary_Society","recorded":1375066257,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Rhenish_Missionary_Society&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Rhenish_Missionary_Society&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/w/index.php?title=Missionary_society&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Germany","/wiki/Missionary","/wiki/Ordination","/wiki/South_Africa","/wiki/London_Missionary_Society","/wiki/Mission_(station)","/wiki/Cederberg","/wiki/Wupperthal,_Western_Cape","/wiki/Wuppertal","/wiki/Herero_people","/wiki/Nama_people","/wiki/Damara_people","/wiki/Cape_Colony","/wiki/German_South_West_Africa","/wiki/Herero_and_Namaqua_Genocide","/wiki/Nadir","/wiki/World_War_I","/wiki/South_West_Africa","/wiki/Dutch_Reformed_Church","/wiki/Moravian_Church","/wiki/Namibia","/wiki/Evangelical_Lutheran_Church_in_Namibia","/w/index.php?title=Bethel_Mission&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Vereinte_Evangelische_Mission&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Rhenish_Missionary_Society&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Special:BookSources/085910382X","/wiki/Special:BookSources/380500351X","/w/index.php?title=Rhenish_Missionary_Society&action=edit&section=2","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Rhenish_Missionary_Society","http://web.archive.org/web/20041216150358/http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/Meadows/7589/rhenish_en.html","http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/Meadows/7589/rhenish_en.html","/wiki/Template:Protestant_missions_to_Africa","/wiki/Template_talk:Protestant_missions_to_Africa","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Protestant_missions_to_Africa&action=edit","/wiki/Christianity","/wiki/Protestantism","/wiki/Timeline_of_Christian_missions","/wiki/Christianity_in_Africa","/wiki/William_Anderson_(missionary)","/wiki/Frederick_Stanley_Arnot","/wiki/John_Arthur","/wiki/Samuel_Bill","/wiki/Joseph_Booth_(missionary)","/wiki/Daniel_Coker","/wiki/Daniel_Kumler_Flickinger","/wiki/George_Grenfell","/wiki/Carl_Hugo_Hahn","/wiki/Joseph_Hardcastle_(1752%E2%80%931818)","/wiki/Joseph_Crane_Hartzell","/wiki/Johannes_Ittmann","/wiki/Franz_Heinrich_Kleinschmidt","/wiki/Johann_Ludwig_Krapf","/wiki/Margaret_Nicholl_Laird","/wiki/Christian_Ignatius_Latrobe","/wiki/David_Livingstone","/wiki/Mary_Livingstone_(n%C3%A9e_Moffat)","/wiki/Alexander_Murdoch_Mackay","/wiki/Joseph_Merrick_(missionary)","/wiki/Robert_Moffat_(missionary)","/wiki/Andrew_Murray_(minister)","/wiki/Helen_Roseveare","/wiki/Hans_Paludan_Smith_Schreuder","/wiki/John_Philip_(missionary)","/wiki/Martti_Rautanen","/wiki/Alfred_Saker","/wiki/Heinrich_Schmelen","/wiki/William_Henry_Sheppard","/wiki/Mary_Slessor","/wiki/John_McKendree_Springer","/wiki/Charles_Studd","/wiki/William_Taylor_(bishop)","/wiki/Gottlieb_Viehe","/wiki/American_Board_of_Commissioners_for_Foreign_Missions","/wiki/Africa_Inland_Mission","/wiki/Berlin_Missionary_Society","/wiki/BMS_World_Mission","/wiki/Congo-Balolo_Mission","/wiki/Christian_and_Missionary_Alliance","/wiki/Church_Mission_Society","/wiki/Finnish_Missionary_Society","/wiki/Heart_of_Africa_Mission","/wiki/Livingstone_Inland_Mission","/wiki/London_Missionary_Society","/wiki/Mission_Africa","/wiki/Mission_to_the_World","/wiki/Paris_Evangelical_Missionary_Society","/wiki/USPG","/wiki/WEC_International","/wiki/Slave_Trade_Act_1807","/wiki/Slavery_Abolition_Act_1833","/wiki/Portal:Christianity","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rhenish_Missionary_Society&oldid=563610740","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Religious_organizations_established_in_1828","/wiki/Category:Christian_missionaries_in_Africa","/wiki/Category:History_of_Namibia","/wiki/Category:Christian_missions","/wiki/Category:Christian_missionary_societies","/wiki/Category:Christian_organizations_established_in_the_19th_century","/wiki/Category:1828_establishments_in_Germany","/wiki/Category:Commons_category_with_local_link_same_as_on_Wikidata","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Rhenish+Missionary+Society&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Rhenish+Missionary+S
