The relationship generally is stable and\nat least semi-permanent; however, the couple does not live together openly. Also\nthe relationship is usually, but not always, secret. There is an implication\nthat a mistress may be \"kept\"—i.e., that the lover is paying for some of the\nwoman's living expenses.<ref></ref><ref></ref>\n\nThe word mistress was originally used as a neutral counterpart to mister or\nmaster.<ref></ref>\n",
