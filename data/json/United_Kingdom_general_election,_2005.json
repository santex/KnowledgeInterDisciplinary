The Labour Party under\nTony Blair won its third consecutive victory, but its majority now stood at 66\nseats compared to the 160-seat majority it had previously held.\n\nThe Labour campaign emphasised a strong economy, however Blair had suffered a\ndecline in popularity even before the decision to send British troops to invade\nIraq in 2003. The Conservative Party, led by Michael Howard since late 2003,\ncampaigned on policies, such as immigration limits, improving poorly managed\nhospitals and reducing high crime rates, all under the slogan 'Are you thinking\nwhat we're thinking?'. The Liberal Democrats, led by Charles Kennedy were\nstaunchly opposed to the Iraq War from the start and collected votes from\ndisenchanted Labour voters.\n\nTony Blair was returned as Prime Minister, with Labour holding 355 MPs but with\na popular vote of 35.2%, the lowest of any majority government in British\nhistory. In terms of votes they were only narrowly ahead of the Conservatives,\nbut still had a comfortable lead ahead of them in terms of seats. The\nConservatives however did manage to return 198 MPs, 32 more than they had\npreviously, and managed to win the popular vote in England while still ending up\nwith 91 fewer MPs in England than Labour. The Liberal Democrats saw their\npopular vote increase by 3.7% and won the most seats for any third party since\n1923, in the form of 62 MPs. Former Labour MP and anti-war activist George\nGalloway was elected as an MP for the newly formed Respect Party, and two Single\nArea Party candidates were elected Blaenau Gwent People's Voice and Health\nConcern in Worcestershire.\n\nIn Northern Ireland, the moderately unionist Ulster Unionist Party, which had\ndominated Northern Ireland's politics since the 1920s, was reduced from 6 MPs to\n1 MP, with party leader David Trimble himself losing his seat. The more hardline\nDemocratic Unionist Party became the largest Northern Ireland party, with 9 MPs.\nFollowing the election, Conservative leader Michael Howard resigned and was\nsucceeded by David Cameron and in 2007, Blair resigned as Prime Minister and\nLabour leader to be replaced by Gordon Brown. The election was broadcast live on\nthe BBC, and presented by Peter Snow, David Dimbleby, Jeremy Paxman and Andrew\nMarr.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"United_Kingdom_general_election,_2005","recorded":1372155005,"links":[],"instances":["uk_parliament_constituency","uk_politician","uk_parliament_constituency","politician","british_politician","uk_parliament_constituency","uk_parliament_constituency","scottish_politician","uk_parliament_constituency","uk_parliament_constituency","uk_parliament_constituency","uk_parliament_constituency","labour_politician","uk_parliament_constituency","politician","uk_parliament_constituency","uk_parliament_constituency","politician","uk_parliament_constituency","uk_parliament_constituency","uk_parliament_constituency","united_kingdom","politician","uk_parliament_constituency","uk_politician","uk_parliament_constituency","uk_parliament_constituency","ireland","uk_parliament_constituency","uk_parliament_constituency","uk_parliament_constituency","uk_parliament_constituency","uk_parliament_constituency","united_kingdom","uk_parliament_constituency","welsh_politician","uk_parliament_constituency","uk_parliament_constituency","uk_parliament_constituency","uk_parliament_constituency","uk_parliament_constituency","uk_parliament_constituency","united_kingdom","uk_parliament_constituency","uk_parliament_constituency","uk_parliament_constituency","uk_parliament_constituency","uk","uk_parliament_constituency","politician","uk_parliament_constituency","uk_parliament_constituency","uk_parliament_constituency","politician","uk_parliament_constituency","uk_parliament_constituency","politician","uk_parliament_constituency","uk_parliament_constituency","uk_parliament_constituency","uk_parliament_constituency","uk_parliament_constituency","uk","uk_parliament_constituency","politician","uk_parliament_constituency","uk_parliament_constituency","uk_parliament_constituency","uk_parliament_constituency","uk_parliament_constituency","uk_parliament_constituency","politician","english_politician","uk_parliament_constituency","uk_parliament_constituency","uk_parliament_constituency","uk_parliament_constituency","uk_parliament_constituency","scottish_politician","uk","uk_parliament_constituency","uk_parliament_constituency"],"pdf":[],"categories":["United
