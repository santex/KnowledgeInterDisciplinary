It also includes performing routine\nactions which keep the device in working order (known as scheduled maintenance)\nor prevent trouble from arising (preventive maintenance). MRO may be defined as,\n\"All actions which have the objective of retaining or restoring an item in or to\na state in which it can perform its required function. The actions include the\ncombination of all technical and corresponding administrative, managerial, and\nsupervision actions.\" <ref>[http://www.EFNMS.org European Federation of National\nMaintenance Societies]</ref>\n\nMRO operations can be categorised by whether the product remains the property of\nthe customer, i.e. a service is being offered, or whether the product is bought\nby the reprocessing organisation and sold to any customer wishing to make the\npurchase (Guadette, 2002). In the former case it may be a backshop operation\nwithin a larger organization or smaller operation.\n\nThe former of these represents a closed loop supply chain and usually has the\nscope of maintenance, repair or of the product. The latter of the\ncategorisations is an open loop supply chain and is typified by refurbishment\nand remanufacture. The main characteristic of the closed loop system is that the\ndemand for a product is matched with the supply of a used product. Neglecting\nasset write-offs and exceptional activities the total population of the product\nbetween the customer and the service provider remains constant.\n",
