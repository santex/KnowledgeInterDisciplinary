{"cursor":"88681","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n.]] 'Simulation' is the imitation of the operation of a real-world process or\nsystem over time. The act of simulating something\nfirst requires that a model be developed; this model represents the key\ncharacteristics or behaviors of the selected physical or abstract system or\nprocess. The model represents the system itself, whereas the simulation\nrepresents the operation of the system over time.\n\nSimulation is used in many contexts, such as simulation of technology for\nperformance optimization, safety engineering, testing, training, education, and\nvideo games. Training simulators include flight simulators for training aircraft\npilots to provide them with a lifelike experience. Simulation is also used with\nscientific modelling of natural systems or human systems to gain insight into\ntheir functioning. In the words of the\n[http://www.modelbenders.com/encyclopedia/encyclopedia.html Simulation article]\nin Encyclopedia of Computer Science, \"designing a model of a real or imagined\nsystem and conducting experiments with that model\". Simulation can be used\nto show the eventual real effects of alternative conditions and courses of\naction. Simulation is also used when the real system cannot be engaged, because\nit may not be accessible, or it may be dangerous or unacceptable to engage, or\nit is being designed but not yet built, or it may simply not exist.\n\nKey issues in simulation include acquisition of valid source information about\nthe relevant selection of key characteristics and behaviours, the use of\nsimplifying approximations and assumptions within the simulation, and fidelity\nand validity of the simulation outcomes.\n","linknr":840,"url":"Simulate","recorded":1362672378,"links":67,"instances":["human_resources","mathematics","abstract","programming_language","satellite_navigation","economics","origins_of_technical_term","model","wargame","medicine"],"pdf":["http://gel.msu.edu/magerko/papers/11TH-CGF-058.pdf","http://www.ipmaac.org/conf/03/havighurst.pdf","http://www.cas.usf.edu/~ewinsb/SiC_Eric_Winsberg.pdf","http://www.cas.usf.edu/~ewinsb/methodology.pdf","http://www.cas.usf.edu/~ewinsb/methodology.pdf"],"categories":["Operations
