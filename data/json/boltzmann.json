achievement was in the\ndevelopment of statistical mechanics, which explains and predicts how the\nproperties of atoms (such as mass, charge, and structure) determine the physical\nproperties of matter (such as viscosity, thermal conductivity, and diffusion).\n","title":"Ludwig%20Boltzmann","headings":["Biography","Philosophy","Physics","The Boltzmann equation","The Second Law as a law of
