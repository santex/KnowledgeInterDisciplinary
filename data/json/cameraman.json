In filmmaking, the leading camera operator is usually\ncalled a cinematographer, while a camera operator in a video production may be\nknown as a 'television camera operator', 'video camera operator', or\n'[[videographer]]', depending on the context and technology involved, usually\noperating a professional video camera.\n\nThe camera operator is responsible for physically operating the camera and\nmaintaining composition and camera angles throughout a given scene or shot. In\nnarrative filmmaking, the camera operator will collaborate with the director,\ndirector of photography, actors and crew to make technical and creative\ndecisions. In this setting, a camera operator is part of a film crew consisting\nof the director of photography and one or more camera assistants. In documentary\nfilmmaking and news, the camera is often called on to film unfolding, unscripted\nevents. In 2006, there were approximately 27,000 television, video, and motion\npicture camera operators employed in the United States.<ref></ref>\n\nImportant camera operator skills include choreographing and framing shots\nknowledge of and the ability to select appropriate camera lenses, and other\nequipment (dollies, camera cranes, etc.) to portray dramatic scenes. The\nprinciples of dramatic story telling and film editing fundamentals are important\nskills as well. The camera operator is required to communicate clearly and\nconcisely on sets where time and film budget constraints are ever present.\n","title":"camera%20operator","headings":["References"]},"micro-relation":["1: Film_camera","1: Video_camera","1: Filmmaking","1: Cinematographer","1: Video_production","1: Professional_video_camera","1: Camera_angle","1: Film_crew","1: Camera_lens","1: Camera_dolly","1: Camera_crane","1: Film_editing","1: Film_budget"]}
