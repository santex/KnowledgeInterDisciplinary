{"cursor":"24802","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Myosins' comprise a family of ATP-dependent motor proteins and are best known\nfor their role in muscle contraction and their involvement in a wide range of\nother eukaryotic motility processes. They are responsible for actin-based\nmotility. The term was originally used to describe a group of similar ATPases\nfound in striated and smooth muscle cells. Following the discovery by Pollard and Korn of enzymes with myosin-\nlike function in ''Acanthamoeba castellanii'', a large number of divergent\nmyosin genes have been discovered throughout eukaryotes. Thus, although myosin\nwas originally thought to be restricted to muscle cells (hence, \"myo\"), there is\nno single \"myosin\" but rather a huge superfamily of genes whose protein products\nshare the basic properties of actin binding, ATP hydrolysis (ATPase enzyme\nactivity), and force transduction. Virtually all eukaryotic cells contain myosin\nisoforms. Some isoforms have specialized functions in certain cell types (such\nas muscle), while other isoforms are ubiquitous. The structure and function of\nmyosin is strongly conserved across species, to the extent that rabbit muscle\nmyosin II will bind to actin from an amoeba. McMahon, T. A.\n1984.
