{"cursor":"70045","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":": \"Results of Fertilizer\" demonstration 1942]]\n\n Agri-Spread lime and fertilizer spreader at an agricultural show]]\n\n'Fertilizer' (or 'fertiliser') is any organic or inorganic material of natural\nor synthetic origin (other than liming materials) that is added to a soil to\nsupply one or more plant nutrients essential to the growth of plants. Conservative estimates report\n30 to 50% of crop yields are attributed to natural or synthetic commercial\nfertilizer. European fertilizer market is\nexpected to grow to â¬15.3 billion by 2018.\n\nMined inorganic fertilizers have been used for many centuries, whereas\nchemically synthesized inorganic fertilizers were only widely developed during\nthe industrial revolution. Increased understanding and use of fertilizers were\nimportant parts of the pre-industrial British Agricultural Revolution and the\nindustrial Green Revolution of the 20th century.\n\nInorganic fertilizer use has also significantly supported global population\ngrowth â it has been estimated that almost half the people on the Earth are\ncurrently fed as a result of synthetic nitrogen fertilizer use.\n\nMined inorganic fertilizers typically provide, in varying proportions:\n\n* six macronutrients: nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca),\n  magnesium (Mg), and sulfur (S);\n* eight micronutrients: boron (B), chlorine (Cl), copper (Cu), iron (Fe),\n  manganese (Mn), molybdenum (Mo), zinc (Zn) and nickel (Ni) (1987).\n\nThe macronutrients are consumed in larger quantities and are present in plant\ntissue in quantities from 0.15% to 6.0% on a dry matter (0% moisture) basis\n(DM). Micronutrients are consumed in smaller quantities and are present in plant\ntissue on the order of parts per million (ppm), ranging from 0.15 to 400 ppm DM,\nor less than 0.04% DM.\n\nOnly three other macronutrients are required by all plants: carbon, hydrogen,\nand oxygen. These nutrients are supplied by water and carbon dioxide.\n","linknr":1034,"url":"Fertilizer","recorded":1362482240,"links":110,"instances":["mathematics","medical","chemistry","soil","ecology","agriculture"],"pdf":["http://www.physics.ohio-state.edu/~wilkins/energy/Resources/Essays/ngeo325.pdf.xpdf","http://www.physics.ohio-state.edu/~wilkins/energy/Resources/Essays/ngeo325.pdf.xpdf","http://www.ipni.net/ipniweb/portal.nsf/0/68907f5d1e5922f8062577ce006ad872/$FILE/K%20Fert%20Prod%20&%20Tech%2011%2016%2010.pdf","http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/BRM/resources/.../Disinfection101.pdf","http://204.3.164.213/components/com_journal/files/jabs_1_1_6.pdf","http://204.3.164.213/components/com_journal/files/jabs_1_1_6.pdf","http://www.agric.wa.gov.au/objtwr/imported_assets/content/lwe/rpm/landcap/soilguide_introduction.pdf","http://www.agric.wa.gov.au/objtwr/imported_assets/content/lwe/rpm/landcap/soilguide_introduction.pdf","http://www.soils.wisc.edu/extension/wcmc/2008/ppt/Laboski1.pdf","http://www.soils.wisc.edu/extension/wcmc/2008/ppt/Laboski1.pdf","http://www.iop.org/EJ/article/1755-1315/6/24/.../ees9_6_242025.pdf","http://www.iop.org/EJ/article/1755-1315/6/24/.../ees9_6_242025.pdf","http://www.msuorganicfarm.com/Compost.pdf","http://www.msuorganicfarm.com/Compost.pdf","http://ucanr.org/sites/nm/files/76654.pdf","http://ucanr.org/sites/nm/files/76654.pdf","http://www.initrogen.org/fileadmin/user_upload/2007_docs/2007-N-joint-policy-brief.pdf","http://www.irri.org/publications/discussion/pdfs/DiscPaper42.pdf","http://www.irri.org/publications/discussion/pdfs/DiscPaper42.pdf"],"categories":["Fertilizers|"],"headings":["Labeling
