A\nmixture refers to the physical combination of two or more substances on which\nthe identities are retained and are mixed in the form of alloys, solutions,\nsuspensions, and colloids.\n\nMixtures are the product of a or mixing of chemical substances like elements and\ncompounds, without chemical bonding or other chemical change, so that each\ningredient substance retains its own chemical properties and makeup.

Atkins ISBN 0-19-879285-\n9 Despite that there are no chemical changes to its constituents, the\nphysical properties of a mixture, such as its melting point, may differ from\nthose of the components. Some mixtures can be separated into their components by\nphysical (mechanical or thermal) means. Azeotropes can be considered as a kind\nof mixture which usually pose considerable difficulties regarding the separation\nprocesses required to obtain their constituents (physical or chemical processes\nor, even a blend of them).\n","linknr":256,"url":"mixtures","recorded":1362891752,"links":62,"instances":["element","chemistry","colloid","chemistry","chemistry","statistics","chemistry"],"pdf":["http://iupac.org/publications/pac/pdf/1972/pdf/3104x0577.pdf"],"categories":["Chemical mixtures|","Physical chemistry|Physical Chemistry","Chemistry"],"headings":["Examples of mixtures","Physics and chemistry","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/f/3/4f3f8be2cdcbbf7bb54a6ba0aed32cab.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/9/1/4/914767ffc65896751e16a5b9fbf3fc4a.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/d/9/8/d9899588b2b28a768a63ade0f3523596.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/8/b/48be1c2a9069402c417c912adae4e34a.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/2/1/2/212abcc00be63b38e4cd48603ee59f7d.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/a/9/0/a909fcef35bdbaeeed609dad1898429a.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/6/5/865c0c0b4ab0e063e5caa3387c1a8741.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/6/5/865c0c0b4ab0e063e5caa3387c1a8741.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/6/5/865c0c0b4ab0e063e5caa3387c1a8741.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/c/3/fc3258bd06ca42b4475df82161b5c61e.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/1/4/e142f2f70e681c8579d2be0c4729229a.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["suspension","chemistry"],["compound","chemistry"],["homogeneous","chemistry"],["sol","colloid"],["suspension","chemistry"],["amalgam","chemistry"],["mercury","element"],["sampling","statistics"]],"members":["mercury","amalgam","sol","homogeneous","compound","sampling","suspension"],"related":["Chemistry","Alloy","Solution","Suspension_(chemistry)","Colloid","Chemical_substance","Chemical_element","Compound_(chemistry)","Melting_point","Separation_process","Separation_process","Azeotrope","Separation_process","Homogeneous_(chemistry)","Heterogeneous","Solution","Solvent","Nanometer","Micrometer","Tyndall_effect","Centrifugation","Decantation","Gas","Air","Oxygen","Nitrogen","Liquid","Aerosol","Fog","Mist","Vapor","Hair_spray","Solid","Smoke","Cloud","Particulate","Dust","Solution","Water","Foam","Whipped_cream","Shaving_cream","Alcoholic_beverage","Emulsion","Miniemulsion","Microemulsion","Milk","Mayonnaise","Hand_cream","Sugar","Sol_(colloid)","Pigment","Ink","Blood","Suspension_(chemistry)","Mud","Soil","Clay","Silt","Chalk","Hydrogen","Metal","Aerogel","Styrofoam","Pumice","Sponge","Amalgam_(chemistry)","Mercury_(element)","Gold","Hexane","Paraffin_wax","Gel","Agar","Gelatin","Silicagel","Opal","Alloy","Plasticizer","Plastic","Cranberry_glass","Gravel","Granite","Chemical_substances","Elements","Chemical_compound","Trail_mix","Concrete","Cement","Silver","Gold","Gy's_sampling_theory","Sampling_(statistics)","Sampling_error","Sampling_error","First-order_inclusion_probability","Linearization","Correct_sampling"]}
