{"cursor":"4348","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'claiming race' in thoroughbred horse racing is one in which the horses are\nall for sale for more or less the same price (the \"claiming price\") up until\nshortly before the race. Race types form a hierarchy in terms of the quality of\nhorse they attract, with handicap races and graded stakes races attracting the\n\"best\" horses and maiden races the most unseasoned. Claiming races fall at the\nbottom of this hierarchy, below maiden races, and make up the bulk of races run\nat most US tracks. For example in Kentucky in\n1999, 54% of all races run were claiming races, but had only 20% of the purse\ndollar value, the lowest average purse among race types.\n\nThe mechanics of claiming vary based on jurisdiction but in most cases almost\nanyone, or possibly anyone who is licensed to own racehorses, may claim. For\nexample, the Illinois Racing Board stipulates that any horse may be claimed for\nits entered price by any licensed owner or agent or anyone who has filed an\napplication and been granted a claiming license. Title to the horse typically transfers just before the start of\nthe race, but the previous owner is entitled to the\npurse, if any, that results from the horse's performance in the race. Usually related parties such as the trainer or\nemployees, or relatives, are prohibited from claiming, as are reciprocal\nagreements between owners to \"protect\" each other's horses.\nIf a horse is purchased, a track official tags it (often with a red tag ) after the race, and it goes to its new owner, assuming the\nnew owner had sufficient funds on deposit.\n\nClaiming races have claim amounts which vary, and higher amounts tend to have\nricher purses. The intent of this is to even the race; if a better-than-class\nhorse is entered (with the expectation of an easy purse win), it might be lost\nfor the claiming price, which is likely less than the horse is worth. Someone\nmay wish to claim a horse if they think the horse has not been trained to its\nfullest potential under another trainer.\n\nClaiming races serve several purposes. They are a quality classification, as\nwell as a way of ensuring racing outcomes are less predictable, which in turn\nincreases the handle, or amount of parimutuel betting, and a way to bring\nliquidity to the racehorse marketplace. Although many horses\nnever rise above claiming races, some do. For example Stymie, a USD 1500\nclaimer, went on to earn over 900,000 USD winning many storied grade 1 stakes\nand handicap races in the 1940s, General Quarters, a USD 20,000 claimer won the\ngrade 1 Blue Grass Stakes and ran in the 2009 Kentucky Derby and Make A Stand,\nclaimed for Â£8,000 in 1995, won the 1997 Champion Hurdle.\n","linknr":108,"url":"Claiming_race","recorded":1371237436,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Claiming_race&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Claiming_race&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Thoroughbred","/wiki/Thoroughbred_horse_race","/wiki/Handicap_race","/wiki/Graded_stakes_race","/wiki/Maiden_race","#cite_note-Dummies.com-1","/wiki/Purse_distribution","#cite_note-Profit-2","#cite_note-Illinois_Racing_Board-3","#cite_note-Idaho-4","#cite_note-Illinois_Racing_Board-3","#cite_note-Idaho-4","#cite_note-Dummies.com-1","#cite_note-Illinois_Racing_Board-3","#cite_note-Idaho-4","/wiki/Parimutuel_betting","#cite_note-Profit-2","/wiki/Stymie_(horse)","/wiki/General_Quarters_(horse)","/wiki/Blue_Grass_Stakes","/wiki/Kentucky_Derby","/wiki/Make_A_Stand_(horse)","/wiki/Champion_Hurdle","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Special:Search/claiming_race","/w/index.php?title=Claiming_race&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-Dummies.com_1-0","#cite_ref-Dummies.com_1-1","http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/examining-different-levels-of-competition-at-the-r.html","http://www.dummies.com/Section/About-Dummies.id-323897.html","http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/","#cite_ref-Profit_2-0","#cite_ref-Profit_2-1","http://www.agecon.uga.edu/~jab/Library/S99-03.pdf","#cite_ref-Illinois_Racing_Board_3-0","#cite_ref-Illinois_Racing_Board_3-1","#cite_ref-Illinois_Racing_Board_3-2","http://google.com/search?q=cache:cS8M5Wjkh3MJ:www.state.il.us/agency/irb/racing/pdf/licensing%2520forms/part%2520510%2520claiming%2520races.pdf+claiming+race+rules&cd=9&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us","#cite_ref-Idaho_4-0","#cite_ref-Idaho_4-1","#cite_ref-Idaho_4-2","http://adm.idaho.gov/adminrules/rules/idapa11/0409.pdf.","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Claiming_race&oldid=523662974","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Horse_racing","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Claiming+race&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Claiming+race","/wiki/Claiming_race","/wiki/Talk:Claiming_race","#","/wiki/Claiming_race","/w/index.php?title=Claiming_race&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Claiming_race&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf6/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Claiming_race","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Claiming_race","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Claiming_race&oldid=523662974","/w/index.php?title=Claiming_race&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Claiming_race&id=523662974","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Claiming+race","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Claiming+race&oldid=523662974&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Claiming_race&printable=yes","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5125094#sitelinks","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claiming_race","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf6/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","/w/index.php?title=MediaWiki:Gadget-ReferenceTooltips.js&action=raw&ctype=text/javascript&508635914","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&on
