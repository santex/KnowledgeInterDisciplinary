Each\nspermatozoon can fuse with a larger female gamete or ovum, in the process of\nfertilization. A male cannot reproduce sexually without access to at least one\novum from a female, but some organisms can reproduce both sexually and\nasexually. Most male mammals, including male humans, have a Y chromosome, which\ncodes for the production of larger amounts of testosterone to develop male\nreproductive organs.\n\nNot all species share a common sex-determination system. In most animals,\nincluding humans, sex is determined genetically, but in some species it can be\ndetermined due to social, environmental or other factors.\n","linknr":367,"url":"Male","recorded":1362373503,"links":83,"instances":["evolution","mythology","disambiguation"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Gender","Males|","Men|","Sex"],"headings":["Overview","Symbol","Sex determination","Secondary sex characteristics","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b7/Mars_symbol.svg/220px-Mars_symbol.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["lineage","evolution"],["mars_symbol","disambiguation"],["mars","mythology"]],"members":["lineage","mars","mars_symbol"],"related":["Mars","Alchemical_symbol","Iron","Organism","Physiological","Sex","Sperm","Female","Ovum","Fertilization","Sexual_reproduction","Mammal","Y_chromosome","Testosterone","Male_reproductive_organs","Sex-determination_system","Genetics","Lineage_(evolution)","Convergent_Evolution","Isogamy","Mating_type","Anisogamy","Gamete","Female","Oogamy","Sexual_reproduction","Operational_definition","Sexual_dimorphism","Chytrid","Diatom","Plant","Sporophyte","Gender_symbol","Mars_symbol_(disambiguation)","Unicode","Alt_codes","Ordinal_direction","Mars","Carolus_Linnaeus","Roman_mythology","Mars_(mythology)","Hermaphrodite","Worm","Mammal","Human","XY_sex-determination_system","Chromosome","Intersex","Hermaphroditic","Dallas_Denny","Reproduction","Female","SRY","Sox9","FGF9","PGD2","Gonad","Spermatic_cord","Sertoli_cell","ZW_sex-determination_system","Bird","Insect","Lepidoptera","Hymenoptera","Ant","Bee","Haplodiploidy","Haploid","Diploid","Alligator","Snail","Clown_fish","Arthropod","Bacterium","Alternation_of_generations","Flower","Plumage","Boy","Female","Gender","Male_pregnancy","Man","Masculinity","Male_plant"]}
