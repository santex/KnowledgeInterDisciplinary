Also visible is one of the sway bar end\nlinks that connects the bar vertically to an axle. The sway bar end link is the\nstructural member that twists the anti-sway bar when the vehicle is cornering.]]\n\nA 'sway bar' or 'anti-roll bar' or 'stabilizer bar' is a part of an automobile\nsuspension that helps reduce the body roll of a vehicle during fast cornering or\nover road irregularities. It connects opposite (left/right) wheels together\nthrough short lever arms linked by a torsion spring. A sway bar increases the\nsuspension's roll stiffnessâits resistance to roll in turns, independent of its\nspring rate in the vertical direction. The first stabilizer bar patent was\nawarded to the Canadian S. L. C. Coleman of Fredericton, New Brunswick on April\n22, 1919.
