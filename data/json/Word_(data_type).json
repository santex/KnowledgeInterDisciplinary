{"cursor":"22814","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nIn computing, 'word' is a term for the natural unit of data used by a\nparticular processor design. A word is basically a fixed sized group of bits\nthat are handled as a unit by the instruction set and/or hardware of the\nprocessor. The number of bits in a word (the word size, word width, or word\nlength) is an important characteristic of a specific processor design or\ncomputer architecture.\n\nThe size of a word is reflected in many aspects of a computer's structure and\noperation; the majority of the registers in a processor are usually word sized\nand the largest piece of data that can be transferred to and from the working\nmemory in a single operation is a word in many (not all) architectures. The\nlargest possible address size, used to designate a location in memory, is\ntypically a hardware word (here, \"hardware word\" means the full-sized natural\nword of the processor, as opposed to any other definition used).\n\nModern processors, including embedded systems, usually have a word size of 8,\n16, 24, 32 or 64 bits, while modern general purpose computers usually use 32\nor 64 bits. Special purpose digital processors, such as DSPs for instance, may\nuse other sizes and many different sizes have been used historically,\nincluding 8, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 39, 40, 48 and 60 bits. The slab is an example\nof a system with an earlier word size. Several of the earliest computers (and\na few modern as well) used BCD rather than plain binary, typically having a\nword size of 10 or 12 decimal digits, and some early decimal computers had no\nfixed word length at all.\n\nThe size of a word can sometimes differ from the expected due to backward\ncompatibility with earlier computers. If multiple compatible variations or a\nfamily of processors share a common architecture and instruction set but differ\nin their word sizes, their documentation and software may become notationally\ncomplex to accommodate the difference (see Size families below).\n","linknr":462,"url":"Word_(data_type)","recorded":1362891456,"links":39,"instances":["computer","computer_science","computing","ncr"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Data types","Data unit|","Primitive types","Units of information"],"headings":["Uses of words","Word size choice","Size families","Table of word sizes","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["slab","ncr"],["integer","computer_science"],["character","computing"],["z3","computer"],["integer","computer_science"]],"members":["z3","integer","character","slab"],"related":["Computing","Central_processing_unit","Bit","Instruction_set","Computer_architecture","Processor_register","Computer_memory","Memory_address","Embedded_system","36-bit_word_length","Slab_(NCR)","Binary-coded_decimal","Binary_numeral_system","Decimal_computer","Backward_compatibility","Integer_(computer_science)","Floating_point","Processor_register","Data_bus","CPU_cache","Memory_hierarchy","Machine_instruction","Harvard_architecture","Character_(computing)","36-bit_word_length","IBM","System/360","Byte","Binary_coded_decimal","IBM_702","IBM_705","IBM_7080","IBM_7010","UNIVAC_1050","IBM_1401","IBM_1620","IBM_1620_Model_I","IBM_1620_Model_II","Power_of_two","Arithmetic_shift","Backward_compatibility","Digital_Equipment_Corporation","VAX","PDP-11","X86","Porting","Application_Programming_Interface","Windows_API","Programming_language","Intel","Assembly_language","Babbage","Analytical_engine","Z3_(computer)","Atanasoff–Berry_Computer","Harvard_Mark_I","ENIAC","UNIVAC_I","IAS_machine","Fast_Universal_Digital_Computer_M-2","IBM_701","UNIVAC_60","IBM_702","UNIVAC_120","IBM_650","IBM_653","IBM_704","IBM_705","IBM_NORC","IBM_305","Autonetics_Recomp_I","UNIVAC_II","Semi_Automatic_Ground_Environment","Autonetics_Recomp_II","IBM_1401","IBM_1620","UNIVAC_LARC","CDC_1604","IBM_1410","IBM_7070","PDP-1","IBM_7030","IBM_7080","UNIVAC_III","D-17B","Minuteman_I","UNIVAC_1107","IBM_7010","IBM_7094","Gemini_Guidance_Computer","Apollo_Guidance_Computer","Saturn_Launch_Vehicle_Digital_Computer","CDC_6600","D-37C","Minuteman_II","IBM_360","UNIVAC_1108","PDP-8","PDP-11","Intel_4004","Intel_8008","Calcomp_900","Intel_8080","ILLIAC_IV","Motorola_6800","MOS_Technology_6501","MOS_Technology_6502","Cray-1","Zilog_Z80","Intel_8086","Intel_8087","VAX","Motorola_68000","Motorola_68020","Motorola_68881","Intel_80386","ARM_architecture","MIPS_architecture","Motorola_68040","DEC_Alpha","Cray","PowerPC","IA-64","XScale","Integer_(computer_science)"]}
