The stage serves as a space for actors or performers and a focal\npoint (the screen in cinema theaters) for the members of the audience. As an\narchitectural feature, the stage may consist of a platform (often raised) or\nseries of platforms. In some cases, these may be temporary or adjustable but\nin theaters and other buildings devoted to such productions, the stage is\noften a permanent feature.\n\nThere are several types of stages that vary as to the usage and the relation\nof the audience to them. http://www.ia470.com/primer/theatres.htm\nThe most common form found in the West is the proscenium stage. In this type,\nthe audience is located on one side of the stage with the remaining sides\nhidden and used by the performers and technicians. Thrust stages may be\nsimilar to proscenium stages but with a platform or performance area that\nextends into the audience space so that the audience is located on three\nsides. In theatre in the round, the audience is located on all four sides of\nthe stage. The fourth type of stage incorporates created and found stages\nwhich may be constructed specifically for a performance or may involve a space\nthat is adapted as a stage.\n","linknr":204,"url":"Stage_(theatre)","recorded":1362583477,"links":47,"instances":["structure","stage","theatre"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Stage terminology","Stagecraft","Parts of a theatre"],"headings":["Types of staging","Stage terminology","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/Drury_Lane_1674.gif/400px-Drury_Lane_1674.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d5/Bielsko-Bia%C5%82a%2C_Teatr_Polski%2C_scena.jpg/300px-Bielsko-Bia%C5%82a%2C_Teatr_Polski%2C_scena.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fb/Mind-reading-Russell-Morgan.jpeg/220px-Mind-reading-Russell-Morgan.jpeg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c7/Elizabethan.jpg/220px-Elizabethan.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/Stage_directions_2.svg/220px-Stage_directions_2.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["theater","structure"],["stage","theatre#stage_terminology"],["blocking","stage"],["stage","theatre#stage_terminology"],["stage","theatre#stage_terminology"],["blocking","stage"],["rake","theatre"]],"members":["stage","theater","blocking","rake"],"related":["Theatre","Performance_art","Stagecraft","Performance","Theatrical_production","Actor","Projection_screen","Movie_theatre","Audience","Theater_(structure)","Proscenium","Thrust_stage","Theatre_in_the_round","Italian_Renaissance","Proscenium","Fly_system","Stage_curtain","Theatrical_properties","Apron_stage","Orchestra_pit","Musical_theatre","Opera","Curtain","Rat_runs","Lighting_design","Actor","Proscenium","Vomitorium","Theatre_in_the_round","Fourth_wall","Blocking_(stage)","Theatrical_property","Blocking_(stage)","Rake_(theatre)"]}
