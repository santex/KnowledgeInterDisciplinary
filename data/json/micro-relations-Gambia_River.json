It is navigable for about half\nthat length.\n\nThe river is strongly associated with the Gambia, the smallest country in\nmainland Africa, which consists of little more than the downstream half of the\nriver and its two banks.\n\nFrom the Fouta Djallon, the river runs northwest into the Tambacounda Region of\nSenegal, where it flows through the Parc National du Niokolo Koba, then is\njoined by the Nieri Ko and Koulountou before entering the Gambia at Fatoto. At\nthis point the river runs generally west, but in a meandering course with a\nnumber of oxbows, and about 100 km from its mouth it gradually widens, to\nover 10 km wide where it meets the sea.\n\nNear the mouth of the river, near Juffure, is James Island, a place used in the\nslave trade which is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\nThe aquatic fauna in the Gambia River basin is closely associated with that of\nthe SÃ©nÃ©gal River basin, and the two are usually combined under a single\necoregion known as the Senegal-Gambia Catchments. Although the species richness\nis moderately high, only three species of frogs and one fish are endemic to this\necoregion.
