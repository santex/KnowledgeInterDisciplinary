The other type of vaporization is boiling, which, instead,\noccurs within the entire mass of the liquid.\n\nOn average, the molecules in a glass of water do not have enough heat energy to\nescape from the liquid. With sufficient heat, the liquid would turn into vapor\nquickly (see boiling point). When the molecules collide, they transfer energy to\neach other in varying degrees, based on how they collide. Sometimes the transfer\nis so one-sided for a molecule near the surface that it ends up with enough\nenergy to 'escape'.\n\nEvaporation is an essential part of the water cycle. The sun (solar energy)\ndrives evaporation of water from oceans, lakes, moisture in the soil, and\nother sources of water. In hydrology, evaporation and transpiration (which\ninvolves evaporation within plant stomata) are collectively termed\nevapotranspiration. Evaporation of water occurs when the surface of the liquid\nis exposed, allowing molecules to escape and form water vapor; this vapor can\nthen rise up and form clouds.\n","linknr":250,"url":"Evaporation","recorded":1362371948,"links":67,"instances":["phase_transition","agriculture","earthen_pot","unit","chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Atmospheric thermodynamics","Basic meteorological concepts and phenomena","Materials science","Phase transitions","Thin film deposition"],"headings":["Theory","Factors influencing the rate of evaporation","Applications","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/Watervapor_cup.jpg/220px-Watervapor_cup.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/25/Water_vapor_pressure_graph.jpg/240px-Water_vapor_pressure_graph.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/b/4/7/b474c76b3cf8d810bcfe0eaeafadb5c1.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["interface","chemistry"],["atmosphere","unit"],["matki","earthen_pot"],["hydrology","agriculture"],["sublimation","phase_transition"]],"members":["sublimation","hydrology","matki","atmosphere","interface"],"related":["Gaseous_water","Gas","Cloud","Vaporization","Liquid","Interface_(chemistry)","Boiling","Boiling_point","Water_cycle","Ocean","Lake","Soil_moisture","Hydrology","Transpiration","Plant","Stomata","Evapotranspiration","Molecule","Kinetic_energy","Evaporative_cooling","Sweat","Vapor_pressure","Atmospheric_pressure","Knudsen_layer","Temperature","Atmosphere_(unit)","Vapor","Molecules","Density","Pressure","Thermodynamic_equilibrium","Vapor_pressure","Clausius-Clapeyron_relation","Natural_logarithm","Standard_enthalpy_change_of_vaporization","Universal_gas_constant","Enthalpy_of_vaporization","Universal_gas_constant","Boiling","Kinetic_energy","Concentration","Boundary_layer","Enthalpy_of_vaporization","Pressure","Surface_area","Temperature","Density","Clothes","Humidity","Heat","Wind","Clothes_dryer","Matki_(earthen_pot)","Botijo","Evaporative_cooler","Droplet","Thin_film","Thin-film_deposition","Atmometer","Condensation","Cryophorus","Crystallisation","Desalination","Distillation","Drying","Eddy_covariance","Hydrology_(agriculture)","Latent_heat_flux","Evaporator","Evapotranspiration","Flash_evaporation","Heat_of_vaporization","Latent_heat","Pan_evaporation","Transpiration","Sublimation_(phase_transition)"]}
