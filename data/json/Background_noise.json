{"cursor":"2096","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In acoustics and specifically in acoustical engineering, 'background noise' or\n'ambient noise' is any sound other than the sound being monitored(primary\nsound). Background noise is a form of noise pollution or interference.\nBackground noise is an important concept in setting noise regulations. See noise\ncriteria for cinema/home cinema applications.\n\nExamples of background noises are environmental noises such as waves, traffic\nnoise, alarms, people talking, bioacoustic noise from animals or birds and\nmechanical noise from devices such as refrigerators or air conditioning, power\nsupplies or motors.\n\nThe prevention or reduction of background noise is important in the field of\nactive noise control. It is an important consideration with the use of\nultrasound (e.g. for medical diagnosis or imaging), sonar and sound\nreproduction.\n\nIn astronomy, background noise or cosmic background radiation is electromagnetic\nradiation from the sky with no discernible source.\n\nIn information architecture, irrelevant, duplicate or incorrect information may\nbe called background noise.\n\nIn physics and telecommunication, background signal noise can be detrimental or\nin some cases beneficial. The study of avoiding, reducing or using signal noise\nis information theory.\n\nIn telephony, artificial comfort noise is used as a substitute for natural\nbackground noise, to fill in artificial silence created by discontinuous\ntransmission systems using voice activity detection. Background noise can also\naffect concentration.\n","linknr":118,"url":"Background_noise","recorded":1362898491,"links":16,"instances":["communication","environmental"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Acoustics","Noise"],"headings":["See also","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/54/Science.jpg/30px-Science.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["interference","communication"],["noise","environmental"]],"members":["interference","noise"],"related":["Acoustics","Acoustical_engineering","Sound","Noise","Noise_pollution","Interference_(communication)","Noise_regulation","Noise_criteria","Noise_(environmental)","Waves","Traffic","Alarms","Bioacoustics","Refrigerator","Air_conditioning","Power_supplies","Electric_motor","Active_noise_control","Ultrasound","Sonar","Sound_reproduction","Astronomy","Cosmic_background_radiation","Electromagnetic_radiation","Information_architecture","Physics","Telecommunication","Signal_noise","Information_theory","Telephony","Comfort_noise","Discontinuous_transmission","Voice_activity_detection","Ambient_noise_level","4'33\"","Electronic_noise"]}
