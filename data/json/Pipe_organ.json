Retrieved on 2008-03-03. ]]\n\nThe 'pipe organ' is a musical instrument commonly used in churches or cathedrals\nthat produces sound by driving pressurized air (called wind) through pipes\nselected via a keyboard. Because each organ pipe produces a single pitch, the\npipes are provided in sets called ranks, each of which has a common timbre and\nvolume throughout the keyboard compass. Most organs have multiple ranks of pipes\nof differing timbre, pitch and loudness that the player can employ singly or in\ncombination through the use of controls called stops.\n\nA pipe organ has one or more keyboards (called [[Manual (music)|manuals]])\nplayed by the hands, and a pedalboard played by the feet, each of which has its\nown group of stops. The organ's continuous supply of wind allows it to sustain\nnotes for as long as the corresponding keys are depressed, unlike the piano and\nharpsichord whose sound begins to decay immediately after attack. The smallest\nportable pipe organs may have only one or two dozen pipes and one manual; the\nlargest may have over 20,000 pipes and seven manuals. Willey, David (2001).\n\"[http://web.archive.org/web/20071208171132/http://www.ondamar.demon.co.uk/list-\ns/big1.htm The World's Largest Organs]\".

By the 6th or 7th century\nAD, bellows were used to supply organs with wind. Beginning\nin the 12th century, the organ began to evolve into a complex instrument capable\nof producing different timbres. By the 17th century, most of the sounds\navailable on the modern classical organ had been developed. Randel \"Organ\",\n584â585.

N. Pippenger, \"Complexity\nTheory\", Scientific American, 239:90-100 (1978).\n\nPipe organs are installed in churches, synagogues, concert halls, and other\npublic buildings and are used for the performance of classical music, sacred\nmusic, and secular music. In the early 20th century, pipe organs were\ninstalled in theaters to accompany films during the silent movie era, in\nmunicipal auditoria, where orchestral transcriptions were popular, and in the\nhomes of the wealthy, equipped with player mechanisms. {{cite\nbook|last=Smith|first=Rollin|title=The Aeolian pipe organ and its music\n|publisher=The Organ Historical Society|location=Richmond VA USA|year=1998|isbn=0-913499-16-\n1}} The beginning of the 21st century has seen a resurgence in\ninstallations in concert halls.
