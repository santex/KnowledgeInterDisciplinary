{"cursor":"8043","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Polymer chemistry' or 'macromolecular chemistry' is a multidisciplinary science\nthat deals with the chemical synthesis and chemical properties of polymers or\nmacromolecules. According to IUPAC\nrecommendations, macromolecules refer to the individual\nmolecular chains and are the domain of chemistry. Polymers describe the bulk\nproperties of polymer materials and belong to the field of polymer physics as a\nsubfield of physics.\n\nPolymer chemistry is that branch of one, which deals with the study of synthesis\nand properties of macromolecules.\n\nPolymers are formed by polymerization of monomers. A polymer is chemically\ndescribed by its degree of polymerisation, molar mass distribution, tacticity,\ncopolymer distribution, the degree of branching, by its end-groups, crosslinks,\ncrystallinity and thermal properties such as its glass transition temperature\nand melting temperature. Polymers in solution have special characteristics with\nrespect to solubility, viscosity and gelation.\n","linknr":346,"url":"Polymer_chemistry","recorded":1362507922,"links":36,"instances":["inventor","chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Polymer chemistry"],"headings":["History","Theories","Examples of polymers","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["branching","chemistry"],["thomas_hancock","inventor"]],"members":["thomas_hancock","branching"],"related":["Science","Chemical_synthesis","Chemical_property","Polymer","Macromolecule","IUPAC","Chemistry","Polymer_physics","Physics","Polymerization","Monomer","Degree_of_polymerisation","Molar_mass_distribution","Tacticity","Copolymer","Branching_(chemistry)","End-group","Cross-link","Crystallinity","Glass_transition_temperature","Solution","Solubility","Viscosity","Gel","Henri_Braconnot","Christian_Schönbein","Nitrocellulose","Camphor","Celluloid","Ether","Acetone","Collodion","Wound","American_Civil_War","Cellulose_acetate","Friedrich_Ludersdorf","Nathaniel_Hayward","Plastic","Rubber","Isoprene","Charles_Goodyear","Vulcanization","Sulfur","Thomas_Hancock_(inventor)","Hilaire_de_Chardonnet","Fiber","Cellulose","Viscose","Rayon","Silk","Leo_Baekeland","Chemical_synthesis","Thermoset","Phenol","Formaldehyde","Bakelite","Hermann_Leuchs","Hermann_Emil_Fischer","Cellophane","Jocques_Brandenberger","Acid","Hermann_Staudinger","Atoms","Covalent_bond","Macromolecule","Scientist","Molecule","Colloid","Molecular_mass","Force","Nobel_Prize_in_Chemistry","Wallace_Carothers","Neoprene","Polyester","Nylon","Paul_Flory","Nobel_Prize_in_Chemistry","Random_coil","Stephanie_Kwolek","Aramid","Aromatic","Kevlar","Commerce","Composite_material","Carbon_fiber","Epoxy","Polystyrene","Polybutadiene","Acrylonitrile","Butadiene","Styrene","Temperature","Automobile","Engine","Institut_fur_Makromolekulare_Chemie","Hermann_Staudinger","Polymer_Research_Institute","Herman_Mark","Polytechnic_Institute_of_Brooklyn","Polytechnic_Institute_of_NYU","Richard_S._Stein","University_of_Massachusetts_Amherst","Eric_Baer","Case_Western_Reserve_University","The_University_of_Southern_Mississippi","University_of_Akron","Association_theory","Scheutjens–Fleer_theory","Flory–Huggins_solution_theory","Cossee-Arlman_mechanism","Polymer_field_theory","Protein","Collagen","Keratin","Elastin","Chemical_reaction","Enzyme","Hormone","Transport_protein","Polysaccharide","Cellulose","Chitin","Starch","Glycogen","Nucleic_acid","DNA","RNA","Chemical_synthesis","Plastic","Fiber","Paint","Building_material","Furniture","Machine","Adhesive","Thermoplastic","Polyethylene","Teflon","Polystyrene","Polypropylene","Polyester","Polyurethane","Polymethyl_methacrylate","Polyvinyl_chloride","Nylon","Rayon","Celluloid","Silicone","Thermosetting_plastic","Vulcanization","Rubber","Bakelite","Kevlar","Epoxy","Polymer","Polymer_science","Polymer_physics","Chemistry"]}
