He was known to\nSomerset cricket fans as 'Dasher' due to his \"pace over the ground\", [[Daily\nTelegraph]] Sports Section p17: article by David Green, published on 21 July\n2007. and he was also known for an unorthodox stroke called the 'Chewton\ncarve' or 'Chewton chop', a stroke that cut the ball away between the slips and\nthe covers. Denning was a left-handed top order (often\nopening) batsman and scored 1,000 runs in a season on six occasions.
