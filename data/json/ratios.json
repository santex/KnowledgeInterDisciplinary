For example, supposing one has 8 oranges and 6 lemons\nin a bowl of fruit, the ratio of oranges to lemons would be 4:3 (which is\nequivalent to 8:6) while the ratio of lemons to oranges would be 3:4.\nAdditionally, the ratio of oranges to the total amount of fruit is 4:7\n(equivalent to 8:14). The 4:7 ratio can be further converted to a fraction of\n4/7 to represent how much of the fruit is oranges.\n","title":"Ratio","headings":["Notation and terminology","History and etymology","Examples","Number of terms","Proportions","Reduction","Odds","Different units","See also","References","Further reading","External links"]},"micro-relation":["1: Mathematics","1: Objects","1: Quotient","1: Integer","1: Rational_number","1: Ancient_Greek","1: Logos","1: Latin","1: Pythagoreanism","1: Eudoxus","1: Euclid's_Elements","1: Aliquot_part","1: Archimedean_property","1: Dedekind_cut","1: Geometric_progression","1: Geometric_mean","1: Water-cement_ratio","1: Television","1: Lowest_common_denominator","1: Percent","1: Percentages","1: Irreducible_fraction","1: Divisor","1: Multiplier","1: Dimensionless_quantity","1: Dimensional_analysis","1: Solvent","1: Aspect_ratio","1: Golden_ratio","1: Parts-per_notation","1: Price/performance_ratio","1: Ratio_distribution","1: Ratio_estimator","1: Slope"]}
