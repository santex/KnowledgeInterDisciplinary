It is an expected or free or\ncontinuously changing behaviour and may have a given individual social status or\nsocial position. It is vital to both functionalist and interactionist\nunderstandings of society. Social role posits the following about social\nbehaviour:\n# The division of labour in society takes the form of the interaction among\n# heterogeneous specialised positions, we call roles. Social roles included\n# appropriate and permitted forms of behaviour, guided by social norms, which\n# are commonly known and hence determine the expectations for appropriate\n# behaviour in these roles. Roles are occupied by individuals, who are called\n# actors. When individuals approve of a social role (i.e., they consider the\n# role legitimate and constructive), they will incur costs to conform to role\n# norms, and will also incur costs to punish those who violate role norms.\n# Changed conditions can render a social role outdated or illegitimate, in which\n# case social pressures are likely to lead to role change. The anticipation of\n# rewards and punishments, as well as the satisfaction of behaving prosocially,\n# account for why agents conform to role requirements.\n\nThe notion of the role is examined in the social sciences, more specifically\neconomics, sociology and organisation theory.\n",
