{"cursor":"9104","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nIn linguistics, a 'distinctive feature' is the most basic unit of phonological\nstructure that may be analyzed in phonological theory.\n\nDistinctive features are grouped into categories according to the natural\nclasses of segments they describe: major class features, laryngeal features,\nmanner features, and place features. These feature categories in turn are\nfurther specified on the basis of the phonetic properties of the segments in\nquestion. Since the inception of the phonological analysis of distinctive\nfeatures in the 1950s, features traditionally have been specified by assigning\nthem binary values to signify that the segment being described by the feature\neither possesses that phonetic property or it does not. Therefore, a positive\nvalue, [+], denotes the presence of a feature, while a negative value, [â],\nindicates its absence. However, in recent developments to the theory of\ndistinctive features, phonologists have proposed the existence of single-valued\nfeatures. These features, called univalent or privative features, can only\ndescribe the classes of segments that are said to possess those features, and\nnot the classes that are without them.\n","linknr":191,"url":"Distinctive_feature","recorded":1362554569,"links":26,"instances":["feature","linguistics","phonetics"],"pdf":["http://ucalgary.ca/dflynn/files/dflynn/Flynn06.pdf"],"categories":["Phonology"],"headings":["Major class features","Laryngeal features","Manner features","Place features","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["segment","linguistics"],["aspiration","phonetics"],["delayed_release","feature"]],"members":["delayed_release","segment","aspiration"],"related":["Linguistics","Phonology","Natural_classes","Segment_(linguistics)","Phonetics","Syllable_nucleus","Syllable","Syllabic_consonant","Vowels","Consonant","Semivowel","Vocal_tract","Obstruent","Nasal_consonant","Liquid_consonant","Trill_consonant","Semivowel","Semivowel","Liquid_consonant","Nasal_consonant","Obstruent","Vowels","Sonorant","Consonants","Semivowel","Liquid_consonant","Nasal_consonant","Obstruent","Vocal_folds","Aspiration_(phonetics)","Manner_of_articulation","Continuant","Nasal_sound","Soft_palate","Nasal_cavity","White_noise","Lateral_consonant","Tongue","Delayed_release_(feature)","Stop_consonant","Affricate_consonant","Place_of_articulation","Labial_consonant","Bilabial_consonant","Labiodental_consonant","Coronal_consonant","Apical_consonant","Laminal_consonant","Apical_consonant","Laminal_consonant","Subapical_consonant","Linguolabial_consonant","Interdental_consonant","Dental_consonant","Alveolar_ridge","Alveolar_consonant","Postalveolar_consonant","Hard_palate","Palatal_consonant","Postalveolar_consonant","Sibilant","Palatalized","Alveolopalatal_consonant","Dorsal_consonant","Palatal_consonant","Velar_consonant","Uvular_consonant","Palate","Advanced_tongue_root","Radical_consonant","Pharyngeal_consonant","Epiglottal_consonant","Laryngeal_consonant","Glottal_consonant","Featural_alphabet"]}
