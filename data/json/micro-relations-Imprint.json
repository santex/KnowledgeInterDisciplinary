{"cursor":"7537","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nIn the publishing industry, an 'imprint' can mean several different things:\n* As a piece of bibliographic information about a book, it refers to the name\n  and address of the book's publisher and its date of publication as given at\n  the foot or on the verso of its title page.\n* It can mean a trade name under which a work is published. One single\n  publishing company may have multiple imprints; the different imprints are used\n  by the publisher to market works to different demographic consumer segments.\n  In some cases, the diversity results from the takeover of smaller publishers\n  (or parts of their business) by a larger company. This usage of the word has\n  evolved from the first meaning given above.\n* It can also refer to a finer distinction of a book's version than \"edition\".\n  This is used to distinguish, for example different printings, or printing runs\n  of the same edition, or to distinguish the same edition produced by a\n  different publisher or printer. With the creation of the \"ISBN\" identification\n  system, which is assigned to a text prior to its printing, a different imprint\n  has effectively come to mean a text with a different ISBNâif one had been\n  assigned to it.\n* Under the UK Printer's Imprint Act 1961, [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Eliz2/9-\n  10/31/section/1 http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Eliz2/9-\n  10/31/section/1] which amended the earlier Newspapers, Printers, and\n  Reading Rooms Repeal Act 1869, any printer must put their name and address on\n  the first or last leaf of every paper or book they print or face a penalty of\n  up to Â£50 per copy. In addition, under the Political Parties, Elections and\n  Referendums Act 2000, any election material - including websites - must show\n  the name of the promoter of the material and the name and address of the\n  person on whose behalf it is being published.
