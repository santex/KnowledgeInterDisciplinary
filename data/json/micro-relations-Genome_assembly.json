For a bacterium containing a\nsingle chromosome, a genome project will aim to map the sequence of that\nchromosome. For the human species, whose genome includes 22 pairs of autosomes\nand 2 sex chromosomes, a complete genome sequence will involve 46 separate\nchromosome sequences.\n\nThe Human Genome Project was a landmark genome project that is already having a\nmajor impact on research across the life sciences, with potential for spurring\nnumerous medical and commercial developments.\n","linknr":344,"url":"Genome_assembly","recorded":1362505165,"links":21,"instances":["company","computing","dna","epidemiology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Genome projects|*"],"headings":["Genome assembly","Genome annotation","When is a genome project finished?","Historical and technological perspectives","Example genome projects","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f1/3d_tRNA.png/28px-3d_tRNA.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2b/Hereford67-300.jpg/220px-Hereford67-300.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["repeated_sequence","dna"],["pipeline","computing"],["vector","epidemiology"],["illumina","company"]],"members":["illumina","pipeline","repeated_sequence","vector"],"related":["Scientific","Genome","Organism","Animal","Plant","Fungus","Bacterium","Archaea","Protist","Virus","Gene","DNA","Chromosome","Bacteria","Human_Genome_Project","Genetics","DNA_sequence","Chromosome","Shotgun_sequencing","Organism","Bacterium","Mammal","Nucleotide","Adenine","Guanine","Cytosine","Thymine","Algorithm","Computational_biology","Repeated_sequence_(DNA)","Plant","Animal","Contig","Physical_map","Beijing_Genomics_Institute","Single-nucleotide_polymorphism","DNA_sequence","Genome","Gene_prediction","Pipeline_(computing)","BLAST","Ensembl","Open_reading_frame","Proteogenomics","Mass_spectrometry","Human_genome","Model_organisms","Biological_databases","ENCODE","Entrez_Gene","Ensembl","GENCODE","Gene_ontology","GeneRIF","RefSeq","Uniprot","Vertebrate_and_Genome_Annotation_Project","Internet_bot","Genome_sequencing","Repetitive_DNA","Base_pair","Mitochondria","Chloroplasts","Organelles","Genes","Eukaryotes","Coding_region","Coding_region","Noncoding_DNA","Junk_DNA","Gene_prediction","Expressed_sequence_tag","MRNA","Gene_mapping","Whole_genome_shotgun_sequencing","DNA_sequencing","Base_pair","Model_organism","Bacteria","Vector_(epidemiology)","Mosquito","Chimpanzee","Human_Genome_Diversity_Project","Human","Human_genome_project","Palaeo-Eskimo","Neanderthal","Neanderthal_Genome_Project","Common_Chimpanzee","Chimpanzee_Genome_Project","Cow","Bovine_Genome","Honey_Bee_Genome_Sequencing_Consortium","Human_microbiome_project","International_Grape_Genome_Program","International_HapMap_Project","100K_Genome_Project","Joint_Genome_Institute","Model_organism","National_Center_for_Biotechnology_Information","Illumina_(company)","Knome","United_States_Department_of_Energy","Nature_Reviews_Genetics","PLoS_Biology"]}
