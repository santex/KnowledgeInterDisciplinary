Some\nacts had certain members taking the lead vocalist position with the other\nmembers as supporting vocalists. In later eras the girl group template would be\napplied to disco, contemporary R&B, and country-based formats as well as pop.\n\nA distinction is made here with all-female bands, in which members also play\ninstruments, though this terminology is not universally followed. For\nexample, vocalist groups Sugababes and Girls Aloud are referred to as \"girl\nbands\" [http://www.ok.co.uk/fashion/view/8555/Meet-the-duo-dressing-Girls-Aloud\nMeet the duo dressing Girls Aloud] OK magazine, 20 March 2009; [http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2008/nov/09/girlsaloud-\nthexfactor The nation's new sweetheart] The Observer, 9 November 2008; while\ninstrumentalists Girlschool are termed a \"girl group\"\n[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0320918/bio Biography for Girlschool] Internet Movie\nDatabase; [http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/entertainment/music/reviews/the-hedrons-\n13401497.html?startindex=-1 The Hedrons] Belfast Telegraph, 19 January\n2007\n\nSpice Girls and TLC are considered the best-selling girl groups of all\ntime.
