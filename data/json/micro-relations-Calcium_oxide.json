It is a white, caustic, alkaline crystalline\nsolid at room temperature. The broadly used term \"lime\" connotes calcium-\ncontaining inorganic materials, which include carbonates, oxides and\nhydroxides of calcium, silicon, magnesium, aluminium, and iron predominate,\nsuch as limestone. By contrast, \"quicklime\" specifically applies to a single\nchemical compound.\n\nQuicklime is relatively inexpensive. Both it and a chemical derivative (calcium\nhydroxide) are important commodity chemicals.\n","linknr":316,"url":"Calcium_oxide","recorded":1362481644,"links":60,"instances":["substance","material"],"pdf":["http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/lime/myb1-2007-lime.pdf","http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/lime/myb1-2007-lime.pdf"],"categories":["Oxides","Calcium compounds","Bases","Limestone","Alchemical substances","Disinfectants","Dehydrating agents","Common oxide glass components"],"headings":["Preparation","Usage","Health issues","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/Calcium-oxide-3D-vdW.png/200px-Calcium-oxide-3D-vdW.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fb/Yes_check.svg/7px-Yes_check.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/NFPA_704.svg/75px-NFPA_704.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/Equilibrium.svg/15px-Equilibrium.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["caustic","substance"],["lime","material"]],"members":["caustic","lime"],"related":["Glycerol","Sugar","Diethyl_ether","1-Nonanol","Sodium_chloride","Calcium_sulfide","Calcium_hydroxide","Beryllium_oxide","Magnesium_oxide","Strontium_oxide","Barium_oxide","Chemical_compound","Caustic_(substance)","Alkali","Crystal","Lime_(material)","Limestone","Calcium","Oxide","Limestone","Calcium_carbonate","Calcite","Lime_kiln","Calcination","Carbon_dioxide","Spontaneous_process","Heat","Energy","Calcium_hydroxide","Joule","Self-heating_can","Limelight","Cement","Pre-Pottery_Neolithic_B","Plaster","Lime-ash_floor","David_Hume_of_Godscroft","Henry_III_of_England","Greek_fire","United_States_Geological_Survey"]}
