Newer Honda Pilots are\nbuilt in Lincoln, Alabama and older models were produced in Alliston, Ontario,\nCanada until April 2007. The first generation Pilot was released in the summer\nof 2002 as a 2003 model, and in 2006 it received new front and rear fascias, a\nredesigned interior, and various standard safety features. The second generation\nPilot was released in late 2008 for the 2009 model year.\n\nThe Pilot was designed to fill a large American demand, particularly a larger\nSUV with third-row seating. Prior to the introduction of the Pilot, Honda only\nhad the compact crossover SUV CR-V, and the Honda Passport (a rebadged Isuzu\nRodeo) which is truck-based and intended as a quick-fix, as the company\nrecognized the competition from other refined mid-sized SUVs and crossovers. The\nPilot shares underpinnings and the powertrain with the Acura MDX luxury SUV, and\ntheir platforms are shared with the Odyssey minivan and the Honda Accord sedan.\nThe Pilotâs unibody construction and independent suspension is designed to\nprovide handling similar to that of a car; however, it is also fortified with\nintegrated perimeter frame rails, which helps it withstand towing and light off-\nroad use. The Pilot is Honda's largest and only three-row SUV, although the 2010\nHonda Crosstour surpassed the Pilot in length.\n\nThe Pilot is sold in North America, while Japan and Australia, for several\nyears, got its relative, the Honda MDX (first generation Acura MDX) instead. In\nthe Middle East, the Pilot is sold as the 'Honda MR-V'. The second generation\nPilot is also available in Russia and Ukraine. Also in the Caribbean, the Honda\nPilot is available in Dominican Republic. The Pilot has been a critical and\ncommercial success for Honda, selling over 100,000 vehicles in 2004, an increase\nof almost 20% over 2003. The Pilot is also sold in the Philippines \n","linknr":556,"url":"Honda_Pilot","recorded":1362576309,"links":32,"instances":["automobile","north_america","automobile"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Honda vehicles|Pilot","Crossover SUVs","Mid-size SUVs","SUVs","Front-wheel-drive vehicles","All-wheel-drive vehicles","2000s automobiles","2010s automobiles","Vehicles introduced in 2003","Motor vehicles manufactured in the United States"],"headings":["First generation (2003–2008)","Second generation (2009–present)","Off-road capability","Awards","Problems","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/Post-Facelift_2012_Honda_Pilot_Touring.jpg/280px-Post-Facelift_2012_Honda_Pilot_Touring.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3c/2003-2005_Honda_Pilot_--_10-19-2011.jpg/280px-2003-2005_Honda_Pilot_--_10-19-2011.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4b/09_Honda_Pilot.jpg/280px-09_Honda_Pilot.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6e/2012_Honda_Pilot_--_11-10-2011.jpg/220px-2012_Honda_Pilot_--_11-10-2011.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/12px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["crossover","automobile"],["facelift","automobile"],["honda_odyssey","north_america"],["honda_odyssey","north_america"]],"members":["crossover","honda_odyssey","facelift"],"related":["Honda","Mid-size","Sport_utility_vehicle","SUV","Front-engine,_four-wheel_drive_layout","Front-engine,_front-wheel_drive_layout","Honda_Passport","V6_engine","Honda_J_engine","Automatic_transmission","Large","Crossover_(automobile)","Sport_utility_vehicle","Lincoln,_Alabama","Alliston,_Ontario","Canada","Facelift_(automobile)","United_States","Honda_CR-V","Honda_Passport","Badge_engineering","Isuzu_Rodeo","Acura_MDX","Honda_Odyssey_(North_America)","Minivan","Honda_Accord","Unibody","Independent_suspension","Off-roading","Honda_Accord_Crosstour","North_America","Japan","Australia","Acura_MDX","Middle_East","Russia","Ukraine","Dominican_Republic","Philippines","Alliston,_Ontario","Canada","Lincoln,_Alabama","USA","Acura_MDX","SOHC","VTEC","V6","Timing_belt","Camshaft","United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency","Fuel_economy_in_automobiles","Front-wheel_drive","Honda_Odyssey_(North_America)","Stadium_seating","Moonroof","DVD","Automotive_navigation_system","Four-wheel_drive","Front-wheel_drive","Two_wheel_drive","Anti-lock_brakes","Disc_brake","Monocoque","Lincoln,_Alabama","USA","Acura_MDX","Honda_Manufacturing_of_Alabama","Lincoln,_Alabama","V6","Automatic_transmission","USA_Today","Mazda_CX-9","Advanced_Compatibility_Engineering","Insurance_Institute_for_Highway_Safety","Car_and_Driver_Ten_Best"]}
