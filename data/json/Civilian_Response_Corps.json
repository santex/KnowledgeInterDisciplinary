They are diplomats,\ndevelopment specialists, public health officials, law enforcement and\ncorrections officers, engineers, economists, lawyers, public administrators,\nagronomists and others â offering the full range of skills needed to help\nfragile states restore stability and the rule of law, and achieve economic\nrecovery and sustainable growth as quickly as possible.\n\nThe assistance is partly humanitarian, and partly to prevent failed states from\nbecoming \"havens\" for terrorist groups or otherwise threaten the security of the\nUnited States. Originally proposed by Senators Richard Lugar (R-Ind.) and Joseph\nBiden (D-Del.), the Civilian Response Corps is responsible for U.S. government\nefforts to stabilize war-torn societies and rebuild nations.

[http://www.usip.org/resources/recruitment-rule-law-specialists-\ncivilian-response-corps Recruitment of Rule of Law Specialists for the Civilian\nResponse Corps]\n\nAmericaâs federal civilian workforce has a long and distinguished history of\nservice in difficult environments abroad. Yet the challenges of the 21st century\nrequire a significant increase in the capacity to respond quickly and\neffectively to emerging threats to the security of the United States and its\nfriends and allies. The President has empowered the Secretary of State to\ncoordinate and lead integrated U.S. government efforts to prepare, plan for, and\nconduct stabilization and reconstruction activities, and to coordinate with the\nSecretary of Defense to harmonize civilian and military activities.
