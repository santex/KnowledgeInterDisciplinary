{"cursor":"18713","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nIn chemistry, a 'chemical substance' is a form of matter that has constant\nchemical composition and characteristic properties. It cannot be\nseparated into components by physical separation methods, i.e. without breaking\nchemical bonds. It can be solid, liquid, gas, or plasma.\n\nChemical substances are often called 'pure' to set them apart from mixtures. A\ncommon example of a chemical substance is pure water; it has the same properties\nand the same ratio of hydrogen to oxygen whether it is isolated from a river or\nmade in a laboratory. Other chemical substances commonly encountered in pure\nform are diamond (carbon), gold, table salt (sodium chloride) and refined sugar\n(sucrose). However, simple or seemingly pure substances found in nature can in\nfact be mixtures of chemical substances. For example, tap water may contain\nsmall amounts of dissolved sodium chloride and compounds containing iron,\ncalcium and many other chemical substances.\n\nChemical substances exist as solids, liquids, gases, or plasma and may change\nbetween these phases of matter with changes in temperature or pressure. Chemical\nreactions convert one chemical substance into another.\n\nForms of energy, such as light and heat, are not considered to be matter, and\nthus they are not \"substances\" in this regard.\n","linknr":382,"url":"Chemicals","recorded":1362506913,"links":81,"instances":["physics","matter","geology","mineralogy","unit","molecule"],"pdf":["http://www.cas.org/ASSETS/58D34DD3892142D18F5C3B0A004D3A0C/indexguideapp.pdf"],"categories":["Chemistry","Chemical substances|"],"headings":["Definition","History","Chemical elements","Chemical compounds","Substances versus mixtures","Chemicals versus chemical substances","Naming and indexing","Isolation, purification, characterization, and identification","See also","External links","Notes and references"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/Kochendes_wasser02.jpg/220px-Kochendes_wasser02.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/Nile_red_01.jpg/220px-Nile_red_01.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f1/Schwefel_01.jpg/220px-Schwefel_01.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/Potassium-ferricyanide-sample.jpg/220px-Potassium-ferricyanide-sample.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5f/Vintage_cranberry_glass.jpg/220px-Vintage_cranberry_glass.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/Ethanol-2D-skeletal.png/60px-Ethanol-2D-skeletal.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/59/Nuvola_apps_edu_science.svg/28px-Nuvola_apps_edu_science.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["water","molecule"],["plasma","physics"],["phase","matter"],["rock","geology"],["lustre","mineralogy"],["mole","unit"],["iron(ii_sulfide"]],"members":["plasma","phase","rock","lustre","mole","water"],"related":["Chemistry","Matter","Chemical_compound","Water_(molecule)","Ratio","Hydrogen","Oxygen","Laboratory","Diamond","Gold","Edible_salt","Sodium_chloride","Sugar","Sucrose","Solid","Liquid","Gas","Plasma_(physics)","Phase_(matter)","Temperature","Pressure","Chemical_reaction","Energy","Light","Heat","Chemical_element","Matter","Chemical_Abstracts_Service","Alloys","Non-stoichiometric_compound","Palladium_hydride","Geology","Mineral","Rock_(geology)","Solid_solution","Feldspar","Anorthoclase","Concept","Joseph_Proust","Basic_copper_carbonate","Law_of_constant_composition","Chemical_synthesis","Organic_chemistry","Analytical_chemistry","Chemistry","Isomerism","Benzene","Friedrich_August_Kekulé","Stereoisomerism","Tartaric_acid","Diastereomer","Enantiomer","Sulfate","Hydrogen_sulfide","Chemical_element","Nuclear_reaction","Isotope","Radioactive_decay","Allotropes","Ozone","Metal","Lustre_(mineralogy)","Iron","Copper","Gold","Malleability","Ductility","Carbon","Nitrogen","Oxygen","Non-metal","Electronegativity","Ion","Silicon","Metalloid","Molecule","Ion","Chemical_reaction","Chemical_compound","Chemical_bond","Molecule","Crystal","Crystal_structure","Organic_compound","Inorganic_compound","Organometallic_compound","Covalent_bond","Ion","Ionic_bond","Salt","Isomer","Glucose","Fructose","Aldehyde","Ketone","Glucose_isomerase","Lobry–de_Bruyn–van_Ekenstein_transformation","Tautomer","Glucose","Hemiacetal","Mechanics","Butter","Soil","Wood","Sulfur","Magnet","Gram","Mole_(unit)","Iron(II)_sulfide","Melting_point","Solubility","Fine_chemical","United_States_Pharmacopeia","Systematic_name","IUPAC_nomenclature","Chemical_Abstracts_Service","Sugar","Glucose","Secondary_metabolite","Pharmaceutical","Naproxen","Chemist","Chemical_compound","Chemical_formula","Molecular_structure","Scientific_literature","IUPAC","CAS_registry_number","Chemistry_journal","Patent","Database","Simplified_molecular_input_line_entry_specification","International_Chemical_Identifier","IUPAC_nomenclature","Chemical_formula","Chemical_structure","CAS_registry_number","International_Chemical_Identifier","Pure","Mixture","Nature","Chemical_reaction","IUPAC_nomenclature","Prices_of_elements_and_their_compounds","Chemical_safety_signs"]}
