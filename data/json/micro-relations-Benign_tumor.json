{"cursor":"4532","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nA 'benign tumor' is a tumor that lacks the ability to metastasize. Common\nexamples of benign tumors include moles and uterine fibroids.\n\nThe term \"benign\" implies a mild and nonprogressive disease. Some neoplasms are\ndefined as \"benign tumors\" because they lack the invasive properties of a\ncancer. Benign tumors may still produce negative health effects, though many\nkinds of benign tumors are harmless to human health. Examples of negative\neffects from benign tumors include tumors which produce a \"mass effect\"\n(compression of vital organs such as blood vessels), or tumors of endocrine\ntissues, which may overproduce certain hormones. Examples include thyroid\nadenomas and adrenocortical adenomas.\n\nBenign tumors typically are surrounded by an outer surface (fibrous sheath) that\ninhibits their ability to behave in a malignant manner. Nonetheless, many types\nof benign tumors have the potential to become malignant and some types, such as\nteratoma, are notorious for this.\n","linknr":199,"url":"Benign_tumor","recorded":1362510676,"links":27,"instances":["medicine"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Medical terminology","Benign neoplasms"],"headings":["Classification","Signs and symptoms","Treatment","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["mass_effect","medicine"]],"members":["mass_effect"],"related":["Tumor","Metastasis","Melanocytic_nevus","Uterine_fibroid","Benignity","Mass_effect_(medicine)","Endocrine_system","Hormone","Thyroid_adenoma","Malignancy","Teratoma","Liver","Melanocytes","Colon_polyp","Dysplasia","Cervical_intraepithelial_neoplasia","Occult_bleeding","Anemia","Bowel_obstruction","Surgery","Chemotherapy","Radiation_therapy"]}
