{"cursor":"19384","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nIn vascular plants, the 'root' is the organ of a plant that typically lies below\nthe surface of the soil. However, this is not always the case, a root can also\nbe aerial (growing above the ground) or aerating (growing up above the ground or\nespecially above water). Furthermore, a stem normally occurring below ground is\nnot exceptional either (see rhizome). So, it is better to define root as a part\nof a plant body that bears no leaves, and therefore also lacks nodes. There are\nalso important internal structural differences between stems and roots.\n\nThe first root that comes from a plant is called the radicle. The four major\nfunctions of roots are 1) absorption of water and inorganic nutrients, 2)\nanchoring of the plant body to the ground, and supporting it, 3) storage of food\nand nutrients, 4) vegetative reproduction. In response to the concentration of\nnutrients, roots also synthesise cytokinin, which acts as a signal as to how\nfast the shoots can grow. Roots often function in storage of food and nutrients.\nThe roots of most vascular plant species enter into symbiosis with certain fungi\nto form mycorrhizas, and a large range of other organisms including bacteria\nalso closely associate with roots.\n","linknr":465,"url":"Root","recorded":1362372949,"links":102,"instances":["plant","chemistry","botany","physiology","vegetable","geometry","material","botany","botany"],"pdf":["http://www.newphytologist.org/Brundrett.pdf","http://www.plantphysiol.org/cgi/reprint/120/2/343.pdf","http://www.eeob.iastate.edu/classes/bot404/docs/404root104.pdf","http://jxb.oupjournals.org/cgi/reprint/52/suppl_1/381.pdf"],"categories":["Plant
