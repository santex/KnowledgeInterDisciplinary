This can be\ncaused by taking glucocorticoid drugs, or diseases that result in excess\ncortisol, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), or CRH levels. Kumar, Abbas,\nFausto. Robbins and Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease, 7th ed. Elsevier-\nSaunders; New York, 2005.\n\nCushing's disease refers to a pituitary-dependent cause of Cushing's syndrome: a\ntumor (adenoma) in the pituitary gland produces large amounts of ACTH, causing\nthe adrenal glands to produce elevated levels of cortisol. It is the most common\nnon-iatrogenic cause of Cushing's syndrome, responsible for 70% of cases\nexcluding glucocorticoid related cases. Schwartz's principles of surgery,\n8th ed., p.1455.

The Journal of American\nMedicine 2005; 118(12), 1340â1346.\n\nThis pathology was described by Harvey Cushing in 1932. The syndrome is also called 'Itsenko-Cushing syndrome', 'hyperadrenocorticism' or\n'hypercorticism'.\n\nCushing's syndrome is not confined to humans and is also a relatively common\ncondition in domestic dogs and horses. It also occurs in cats, but rarely.\n\nIt should not be confused with Cushing's triad, a disease state resulting from\nincreased intracranial pressure.\n","linknr":628,"url":"Cushing_syndrome","recorded":1362482130,"links":46,"instances":["emotion"],"pdf":["http://www.pituitarysociety.org/public/specific/cushing/cushings.pdf","http://lohmann-birkner.de/ercusyn/wMedia/pdf/brochure/cushingsEN.pdf"],"categories":["Adrenal gland disorders","Medical conditions related to obesity"],"headings":["Signs and symptoms","Cause","Epidemiology","Pathophysiology","Diagnosis","Treatment","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["euphoria","emotion"]],"members":["euphoria"],"related":["Cortisol","Glucocorticoid","Adrenocorticotropic_hormone","ACTH","Cushing's_disease","Pituitary","Adenoma","ACTH","Adrenal_gland","Iatrogenic","Harvey_Cushing","Dog","Horse","Cat","Cushing's_triad","Obesity","Central_obesity","Moon_face","Hyperhidrosis","Telangiectasia","Stretch_marks","Hirsutism","Baldness","Hypercalcemia","Insomnia","Aromatase","Libido","Impotence","Amenorrhoea","Oligomenorrhea","Infertility","Androgens","GnRH","Euphoria_(emotion)","Psychosis","Clinical_depression","Anxiety","Dermatophyte","Malassezia","Polyuria","Polydipsia","Hypertension","Epinephrine","Insulin_resistance","Ectopic_hormone","Hyperglycemia","Blood_sugar","Diabetes_mellitus","Acanthosis_nigricans","Axilla","Skin_tag","Heart_disease","Death","ACTH","Hyperpigmentation","Mineralcorticoid","Hypokalemia","Gastrointestinal","Osteoporosis","Osteoporosis","Diabetes_mellitus","Hypertension","Amenorrhea","Hirsutism","Baldness","Hypercholesterolemia","Exogeny","Glucocorticoid","Asthma","Rheumatoid_arthritis","Immunosuppression","Endogeny","ACTH","Pituitary_gland","Adrenal_gland","Small_cell_carcinoma","Lung_cancer","Pseudo-Cushing's_syndrome","Transcortin","Iatrogenic","Corticosteroid","Hypothalamus","Pituitary_gland","Corticotropin-releasing_hormone","ACTH","Cortisol","Adrenal_gland","Negative_feedback","Syndrome","Pituitary_adenoma","Corticotropin_releasing_hormone","Ectopic_Cushing_syndrome","Paraneoplastic_syndrome","Dexamethasone_suppression_test","Glucocorticoid","Negative_feedback","Saliva","Physical_examination","Visual_field","Optic_chiasm","Bitemporal_hemianopia","CT_scan","MRI","Pituitary_gland","Adenoma","Incidentaloma","Scintigraphy","Iodocholesterol_scan","Inferior_petrosal_sinus","CRHBP","Striae","Iatrogenic","Adenoma","Pituitary_adenoma","Hydrocortisone","Prednisolone","Ketoconazole","Metyrapone","Mifepristone","Abortifacient","Hyperglycemia","Nelson's_syndrome","Addison's_disease","List_of_cutaneous_conditions"]}
