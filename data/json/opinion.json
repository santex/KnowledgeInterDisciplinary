{"cursor":"6771","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\ning\" in Chinatown, San Francisco, California]]\n\nIn general, an 'opinion' is a belief about matters commonly considered to be\nsubjective, i.e., it is based on that which is less than absolutely certain, and\nis the result of emotion or interpretation of facts. An opinion may be supported\nby an argument, although people may draw opposing opinions from the same set of\nfacts. Opinions rarely change without new arguments being presented. It can be\nreasoned that one opinion is better supported by the facts than another by\nanalyzing the supporting arguments. In casual use, the term opinion\nmay be the result of a person's perspective, understanding, particular feelings,\nbeliefs, and desires. It may refer to unsubstantiated information, in contrast\nto knowledge and fact-based beliefs.\n\nCollective or professional opinions are defined as meeting a higher standard to\nsubstantiate the opinion.
