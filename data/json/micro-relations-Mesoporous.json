{"cursor":"4356","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'mesoporous material' is a material containing s with diameters between 2 and\n50 nm.\n\nPorous materials are classified into several kinds by their size. According to\nIUPAC notation, microporous materials have pore diameters of less\nthan 2 nm and macroporous materials have pore diameters of greater than\n50 nm; the mesoporous category thus lies in the middle.\n\nTypical mesoporous materials include some kinds of silica and alumina that have\nsimilarly-sized fine mesopores. Mesoporous oxides of niobium, tantalum,\ntitanium, zirconium, cerium and tin have also been reported. According to the\nIUPAC, a mesoporous material can be disordered or ordered in a mesostructure.\n\nA procedure for producing mesoporous materials (silica) was patented around\n1970.

Mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) were independently\nsynthesized in 1990 by researchers in Japan. They were later produced\nalso at Mobil Corporation laboratories  and named Mobil\nCrystalline Materials, or MCM-41.\n\nSince then, research in this field has steadily grown. Notable examples of\nprospective applications are catalysis, sorption, gas sensing, ion exchange,\noptics, and photovoltaics.\n","linknr":144,"url":"Mesoporous","recorded":1362371634,"links":19,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Materials","Porous media"],"headings":["References","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/Chem_template.svg/32px-Chem_template.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["International_Union_of_Pure_and_Applied_Chemistry","Microporous_material","Macropore","Mesoporous_silica","Aluminium_oxide","Niobium","Tantalum","Titanium","Zirconium","Cerium","Tin","Mobil_Composition_of_Matter","Catalysis","Optics","Photovoltaics","Characterisation_of_pore_space_in_soil","Nanoporous","Mesoporous_silica","Silicon_dioxide"]}
