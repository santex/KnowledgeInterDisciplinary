{"cursor":"4428","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n'Eleanor \"Sis\" Daley' (March 4, 1907 â€“ February 16, 2003), born Eleanor\nGuilfoyle, was the wife of former Chicago mayor Richard J. Daley and the mother\nof former mayor Richard M. Daley.\n\nBorn in the south side Chicago neighborhood of Canaryville in 1907 as Eleanor\nGuilfoyle to a large Irish family, she met Richard J. Daley at a local ball\ngame. Her brother, Floyd, who was a friend of Daley's, introduced the couple.\nTheir first date was attending a Chicago White Sox game. \"Sis\" was a graduate of\nSaint Mary High School and was a secretary at a local paint company. After a six-\nyear long courtship, during which her future husband finished law school, they\nmarried on June 17, 1936. The Daleys lived in a modest brick bungalow at 3536\nSouth Lowe Street, close to where both had grown up.\nThey had three daughters and four sons, in that order. Their eldest son, Richard\nM. Daley, was mayor of Chicago from 1989 through 2011. The youngest son, William\nM. Daley, served as U.S. Secretary of Commerce from 1997-2000. Another son, John\nP. Daley, is a member of the Cook County Board of Commissioners.\n\n\"Sis\" Daley was a quiet woman who seldom spoke out on political matters. One\nexception was her criticism of Boss, the 1971 Mike Royko biography of Mayor\nDaley portraying the mayor in an unfavorable light. Always fiercely protective\nof her husband and family, her criticism of the book led to one local retailer\nleaving the book off its shelves. In 1972, developers had obtained the city's\ntentative approval of a proposal to tear down the old Chicago Public Library\ndowntown and replace it with a modern office tower. Asked her view of the\nproposal by a [[Chicago Tribune]] reporter, Sis Daley observed that she had used\nthe library as a child, and said of the demolition, \"I don't think that would be\nnice.\" Soon thereafter, a city commission unanimously voted down the project.\n\nOf his wife, the mayor told the press that \"She doesn't speak for me and I don't\nspeak for her. She is able to speak for herself very well, whatever she has on\nher mind.\" It was said that although her husband may have controlled every\naspect of the city's government, \"Sis\" controlled everything inside their house.\n\nIn her later years as a widow and especially during her son's tenure as mayor\nshe became something of a matriarch of Chicago, in fact her birthday of March 4\nhappens to also be the anniversary of the incorporation of the city. She\nattended events to honor her late husband at the University of Illinois at\nChicago, including the dedication of the university library named after him in\n1999 and on the centenary of his birth in 2002. Mrs. Daley died on February 16,\n2003 in her Bridgeport home of a stroke 16 days shy of her 96th birthday as her\nson was running for a fifth term as mayor.\n","linknr":115,"url":"Eleanor_Daley","recorded":1374545081,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Eleanor_%22Sis%22_Daley&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Eleanor_%22Sis%22_Daley&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","/wiki/Eleanor_%22Sis%22_Daley","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","/w/index.php?title=Eleanor_Daley&redirect=no","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Eleanor_Joanne_Daley","/wiki/Fair_City","/wiki/Chicago","/wiki/Richard_J._Daley","/wiki/Richard_M._Daley","/wiki/South_Side_Irish","/wiki/New_City,_Chicago","/wiki/Irish_American","/wiki/Chicago_White_Sox","#cite_note-Daley-1","/wiki/Richard_M._Daley","/wiki/William_M._Daley","/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Commerce","/wiki/John_P._Daley","/wiki/Cook_County,_Illinois","/wiki/Mike_Royko","/wiki/Chicago_Public_Library","/wiki/Chicago_Tribune","/wiki/University_of_Illinois_at_Chicago","/w/index.php?title=Eleanor_%22Sis%22_Daley&action=edit&section=1","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Eleanor_%22Sis%22_Daley&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Template:Citation_needed","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","#cite_ref-Daley_1-0","http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0316834033/interesting-20","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0-316-83403-3","/w/index.php?title=Eleanor_%22Sis%22_Daley&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/File:P_vip.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/69/P_vip.svg/28px-P_vip.svg.png","/wiki/Portal:Biography","http://www.suntimes.com/images/cds/MP3/Familytree.html","http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=7190250","/wiki/Find_a_Grave","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Eleanor_%22Sis%22_Daley&oldid=520891816","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:People_from_Chicago,_Illinois","/wiki/Category:American_people_of_Irish_descent","/wiki/Category:1907_births","/wiki/Category:2003_deaths","/wiki/Category:Deaths_from_stroke","/wiki/Category:Spouses_of_Illinois_politicians","/wiki/Category:Spouses_of_United_States_mayors","/wiki/Category:Daley_family","/wiki/Category:Articles_needing_additional_references_from_June_2008","/wiki/Category:All_articles_needing_additional_references","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Eleanor+%22Sis%22+Daley&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Eleanor+%22Sis%22+Daley","/wiki/Eleanor_%22Sis%22_Daley","/wiki/Talk:Eleanor_%22Sis%22_Daley","#","/wiki/Eleanor_%22Sis%22_Daley","/w/index.php?title=Eleanor_%22Sis%22_Daley&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Eleanor_%22Sis%22_Daley&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf8/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Eleanor_%22Sis%22_Daley","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Eleanor_%22Sis%22_Daley","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Eleanor_%22Sis%22_Daley&oldid=520891816","/w/index.php?title=Eleanor_%22Sis%22_Daley&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Eleanor_%22Sis%22_Daley&id=520891816","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Eleanor+%22Sis%22+Daley","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Eleanor+%22Sis%22+Daley&oldid=520891816&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Eleanor_%22Sis%22_Daley&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5354208#sitelinks","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wik
