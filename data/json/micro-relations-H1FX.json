Nucleosomes consist of approximately 146 bp of DNA wrapped around\n| a histone octamer composed of pairs of each of the four core histones (H2A,\n| H2B, H3, and H4). The chromatin fiber is further compacted through the\n| interaction of a linker histone, H1, with the DNA between the nucleosomes to\n| form higher order chromatin structures. This gene encodes a member of the\n| histone H1 family.\n}}\n","linknr":192,"url":"H1FX","recorded":1362481016,"links":15,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":[],"headings":["References","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/PBB_GE_H1FX_204805_s_at_tn.png/250px-PBB_GE_H1FX_204805_s_at_tn.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/DNA_stub.png/40px-DNA_stub.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Protein","Gene"]}
