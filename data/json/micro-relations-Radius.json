In\neither case, the radius may be more than half the diameter, which is usually\ndefined as the maximum distance between any two points of the figure. The\ninradius of a geometric figure is usually the radius of the largest circle or\nsphere contained in it. The inner radius of a ring, tube or other hollow object\nis the radius of its cavity.\n\nFor regular polygons, the radius is the same as its circumradius.
