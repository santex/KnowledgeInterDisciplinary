The red color is caused mainly by the presence of\nthe element chromium. Its name comes from ruber, Latin for red. Other varieties\nof gem-quality corundum are called sapphires. The ruby is considered one of the\nfour precious stones, together with the sapphire, the emerald, and the diamond.-\n<ref>[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=crc7ZtRHItgC&pg=PA1&dq=types+of+precio-\nus+stone&as_brr=3&ei=WBW1SvaHLYn4zASD9uT8Dg#v=onepage&q=types%20of%20precious%2-\n0stone&f=false Precious Stones], Max Bauer, p. 2</ref>\n\nPrices of rubies are primarily determined by color. The brightest and most\nvaluable \"red\" called pigeon blood-red, commands a large premium over other\nrubies of similar quality. After color follows clarity: similar to diamonds, a\nclear stone will command a premium, but a ruby without any needle-like rutile\ninclusions may indicate that the stone has been treated. Cut and carat (weight)\nare also an important factor in determining the price.\n",
