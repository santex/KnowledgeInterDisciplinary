The term derives from the story that the kings of Siam (now Thailand)\n were accustomed to make a present of one of these animals to courtiers who had\n rendered themselves obnoxious, in order to ruin the recipient by the cost of\n its maintenance. In modern usage, it is an object, scheme, business venture,\n facility, etc., considered to be without use or value.\n\nAlbino elephants exist in nature, usually being a reddish-brown or pink\ncolor. http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/7951331.stm\n","linknr":459,"url":"White_elephant","recorded":1362485873,"links":39,"instances":["london","pachyderm","programming_language","programming_language","montreal","baseball","buddhism"],"pdf":["http://www.omg.org/mda/mda_files/02F-SIW-004-OMG.pdf","http://www.omg.org/mda/mda_files/02F-SIW-004-OMG.pdf","http://www.internationalrivers.org/files/African%20Dams%20Briefings%202006.pdf","http://www.internationalrivers.org/files/African%20Dams%20Briefings%202006.pdf"],"categories":["English idioms","Public choice theory","Metaphors referring to elephants"],"headings":["Background","Examples of alleged white elephant projects","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/The_White_Elephant%2C_Punch_103.png/220px-The_White_Elephant%2C_Punch_103.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d1/Lord_White_Elephant.jpg/220px-Lord_White_Elephant.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d7/De_Witte_Olifant.JPG/170px-De_Witte_Olifant.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["white_elephant","animal"],["white_elephant","pachyderm"],["śakra","buddhism"],["the_o2","london"],["manager","baseball"],["olympic_stadium","montreal"],["ada","programming_language"],["java","programming_language"]],"members":["the_o2","white_elephant","ada","java","olympic_stadium","manager","śakra"],"related":["Idiom","Thailand","Courtier","White_elephant_(animal)","White_elephant_(pachyderm)","Burma","Thailand","Laos","Cambodia","Hsinbyushin","Konbaung_dynasty","Hindu_cosmology","Indra","Vedic_dieties","Airavata","Buddhist_cosmology","Śakra_(Buddhism)","Trāyastriṃśa","Airavata","Gautama_Buddha","Nelumbo_nucifera","Order_of_the_White_Elephant","Medal","Trompenburg","High-speed_rail_in_China","Wenzhou_train_collision","Great_Recession","China_Railways","Bristol_Brabazon","Bristol_Aeroplane_Company","Transatlantic_flight","United_Kingdom","United_States","SS_Great_Eastern","Isambard_Kingdom_Brunel","Transatlantic_telegraph_cable","Thailand","HTMS_Chakri_Nareubet","Asian_Economic_Crisis","2004_Indian_Ocean_earthquake","Royal_Thai_Navy","Hughes_H-4_Hercules","Howard_Hughes","Senate_War_Investigating_Committee","Noah_Dietrich","Lambert-St._Louis_International_Airport","9/11","Trans_World_Airlines","American_Airlines","Bridgeton,_Missouri","Millennium_Dome","The_O2_(London)","Christ's_Hospital_railway_station","Christ's_Hospital","Horsham","Beeching_Axe","Montréal-Mirabel_International_Airport","Pierre_Elliott_Trudeau","Dorval_Airport","Philadelphia_Athletics","San_Francisco_Giants","Manager_(baseball)","John_McGraw","1905_World_Series","Logo","Mascot","Olympic_Stadium_(Montreal)","Montreal","Canadian_Dollar","Montreal_Expos","French-language","Osborne_House","Isle_of_Wight","Queen_Victoria","British_Royal_Family","Ryugyong_Hotel","Pyongyang,_North_Korea","Ada_(programming_language)","United_States_Department_of_Defense","Contracting_with_the_Government_of_the_United_States","C++","Java_(programming_language)","GNAT","Bujagali_Power_Station","Foreign_aid","Henry_James","Newport,_Rhode_Island","Thorstein_Veblen","Conspicuous_consumption","Hills_Like_White_Elephants","Ernest_Hemingway","Cross_City_Tunnel","Sydney","Public-private_partnership","Cambridgeshire_Guided_Busway","East_Anglia","United_Kingdom","Clem_Jones_Tunnel","South_Africa","2010_FIFA_World_Cup","Shanghai_Maglev_Train","Digital_television_in_Malaysia","Radio_Televisyen_Malaysia","F-35_Joint_Strike_Fighter","Ciudad_Real_Airport","Castellón_Airport","Huesca-Pirineos_Airport","National_Ignition_Facility","Laser_fusion","Temple_of_Olympian_Zeus,_Athens","Sagrada_Família","Antoni_Gaudí","Palace_of_the_Parliament","Bucharest","Romania","Nicolae_Ceauşescu","The_Pentagon","Tupolev_Tu-144","Concorde","Stadio_delle_Alpi","1990_World_Cup","Cesana_Pariol","Bobsleigh_at_the_2006_Winter_Olympics","Luge_at_the_2006_Winter_Olympics","Skeleton_at_the_2006_Winter_Olympics","2006_Winter_Olympics","Turin","Homologation","Italy"]}
