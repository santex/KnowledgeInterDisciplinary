In\nmicroscopy, photobleaching may complicate the observation of fluorescent\nmolecules, since they will eventually be destroyed by the light exposure\nnecessary to stimulate them into fluorescing. This is especially problematic in\ntime-lapse microscopy.\n\nHowever, photobleaching may also be used prior to applying the (primarily antibody-\nlinked) fluorescent molecules, in an attempt to quench autofluorescence. This\ncan help to improve signal-to-noise ratio.\n\nPhotobleaching may also be exploited to study the motion and/or diffusion of\nmolecules, for example via the FRAP or FLIP techniques.\n\nLoss of activity caused by photobleaching can be controlled by reducing the\nintensity or time-span of light exposure, by increasing the concentration of\nfluorophores, by reducing the frequency and thus the photon energy of the input\nlight, or by employing more robust fluorophores that are less prone to bleaching\n(e.g. Alexa Fluors or DyLight Fluors). To a reasonable approximation, a given\nmolecule will be destroyed after a constant exposure (intensity of emission X\nemission time X number of cycles) because, in a constant environment, each absorption-\nemission cycle has an equal probability of causing photobleaching.\n","linknr":119,"url":"Photobleaching","recorded":1362567721,"links":28,"instances":["fluor"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Microscopy","Fluorescence","Cell imaging","Cell biology"],"headings":["Lifetime","See also","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Photobleaching.ogg/96px--Photobleaching.ogg.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/NIEHScell.jpg/50px-NIEHScell.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/74/Lens_triplet.svg/36px-Lens_triplet.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["alexa","fluor"]],"members":["alexa"],"related":["Fluorophore","Microscopy","Antibody","Autofluorescence","Signal-to-noise_ratio","Fluorescence_recovery_after_photobleaching","Fluorescence_loss_in_photobleaching","Alexa_(fluor)","DyLight_Fluor","Green_fluorescent_protein","Quantum_dot","Fluorescence_lifetime_imaging","Ozone_depletion"]}
