The organization has country offices in 177\ncountries, where it works with local governments to meet development challenges\nand develop local capacity. Additionally, the UNDP works internationally to help\ncountries achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Currently, the UNDP\nis one of the main UN agencies involved in the development of the Post-2015\nDevelopment Agenda.\n\nUNDP provides expert advice, training, and grant support to developing\ncountries, with increasing emphasis on assistance to the least developed\ncountries.
