The proof of a mathematical theorem is a logical argument for the\n theorem statement given in accord with the rules of a deductive system. The\n proof of a theorem is often interpreted as justification of the truth of the\n theorem statement. In light of the requirement that theorems be proved, the\n concept of a theorem is fundamentally [[deductive]], in contrast to the notion\n of a scientific theory, which is [[empirical]].<ref>However, both theorems and\n theories are investigations. See Introduction, The terminology of Archimedes,\n p. clxxxii:\"theorem (θεὼρνμα) from θεωρεἳν to investigate\"</ref>\n\nMany mathematical theorems are conditional statements. In this case, the proof\ndeduces the conclusion from the hypotheses. In light of the interpretation of\nproof as justification of truth, the conclusion is often viewed as a necessary\nconsequence of the hypotheses, namely, that the conclusion is true in case the\nhypotheses are true, without any further assumptions. However, the conditional\ncould be interpreted differently in certain deductive systems, depending on the\nmeanings assigned to the derivation rules and the conditional symbol.\n\nAlthough they can be written in a completely symbolic form, for example, within\nthe propositional calculus, theorems are often expressed in a natural language\nsuch as English. The same is true of proofs, which are often expressed as\nlogically organized and clearly worded informal arguments, intended to convince\nreaders of the truth of the statement of the theorem beyond any doubt, and from\nwhich a formal symbolic proof can in principle be constructed. Such arguments\nare typically easier to check than purely symbolic ones—indeed, many\nmathematicians would express a preference for a proof that not only demonstrates\nthe validity of a theorem, but also explains in some way why it is obviously\ntrue. In some cases, a picture alone may be sufficient to prove a theorem.\nBecause theorems lie at the core of mathematics, they are also central to its\naesthetics. Theorems are often described as being \"trivial\", or \"difficult\", or\n\"deep\", or even \"beautiful\". These subjective judgments vary not only from\nperson to person, but also with time: for example, as a proof is simplified or\nbetter understood, a theorem that was once difficult may become trivial. On the\nother hand, a deep theorem may be simply stated, but its proof may involve\nsurprising and subtle connections between disparate areas of mathematics.\nFermat's Last Theorem is a particularly well-known example of such a theorem.\n","title":"theorem","headings":["Informal account of theorems","Provability and theoremhood","Relation with scientific theories","Terminology","Layout","Lore","Theorems in logic","See also","Notes","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["2: Deductive_system","2: Four_color_theorem","2: Definition","2: Rule_of_inference","2: Nonsense","2: Formal_language","2: Well-formed_formula","1: Mathematics","1: Mathematical_proof","1: Axiom","1: Theory","1: Archimedes","1: Propositional_calculus","1: Fermat's_Last_Theorem","1: Logically","1: Indicative_conditional","1: Conjecture","1: Natural_number","1: Proof_theory","1: Number_theory","1: Combinatorics","1: Kepler_conjecture","1: Doron_Zeilberger","1: Epistemology","1: Falsifiable","1: Experiment","1: Fractal","1: Mandelbrot_set","1: Riemann_hypothesis","1: Riemann_zeta_function","1: Mertens_conjecture","1: Exponential_function","1: Googol","1: Exhaustive_search","1: Group_theory","1: Zorn's_lemma","1: Isosceles_triangle_theorem","1: Euler's_identity","1: Vandermonde's_identity","1: Bayes'_rule","1: Cramer's_rule","1: Law_of_large_numbers","1: Law_of_cosines","1: Kolmogorov's_zero-one_law","1: Probability_theory","1: Probability_distribution","1: Harnack's_principle","1: Least_upper_bound_principle","1: Pigeonhole_principle","1: Euclidean_division","1: Paradox","1: Goldbach's_conjecture","1: Q.E.D.","1: Paul_Halmos","1: House_style","1: Aphorism","1: AlfrÃ©d_RÃ©nyi","1: Paul_ErdÅs","1: ErdÅs_number","1: Classification_of_finite_simple_groups","1: Logic","1: Rules_of_inference","1: Douglas_Hofstadter","1: First-order_logic","1: Term_rewriting","1: Lambda_calculus","1: Transformation_rule","1: Formal_proof","1: Logical_consequence","1: Proposition","1: Truth","1: Semantics","1: Belief","1: Theory_of_justification","1: Modal_logic","1: Soundness","1: Validity","1: Completeness","1: Inference","1: List_of_theorems","1: Toy_theorem","1: Metamath","1: GÃ¶del,_Escher,_Bach"]}
