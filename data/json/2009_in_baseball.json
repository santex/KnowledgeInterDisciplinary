Cabrera joins fellow\ncountrymen Tony Armas (251), Bobby Abreu (252), Magglio OrdÃ³Ã±ez (275) and AndrÃ©s\nGalarraga (399) on that list. The homer was his team-leading 25th of the season,\nmarking the sixth consecutive season he has reached that total. *August 24\n**Cliff Lee allowed only two unearned runs in seven innings at Citi Field,\nimproving to 5â0 with a 0.68 ERA since joining the Phillies. Lee and Fernando\nValenzuela are the only major-league pitchers in the past 60 years to win each\nof their first five career starts for a team, with an ERA below 1.00 over those\nfive games. Through five starts in , Valenzuela's ERA was 0.20. **Ryan Howard's\nfirst-inning home run at Citi Field produced his 600th career RBI.

Morales also set a\nnew club record for RBI in the month, previously held by Bobby Bonds (31, ) and\nwas one RBI shy of the franchise record for any month. Last month, Angels'\noutfielder Bobby Abreu was selected as the A.L. Player of the Month for July.\nThis is the first time any major league club has had consecutive monthly award\nwinners since Texas Rangers' outfielder Josh Hamilton won in both April and May\nof . *September 6 â Ichiro Suzuki becomes the second-fastest player\nin Major League history to reach 2,000 hits with a first-inning double in his\n1,402nd game (2001âpresent). Al Simmons did it in 1,390 games (1924â1934).\n*September 7 **At PNC Park, the Chicago Cubs assured the Pittsburgh Pirates of a\nrecord-breaking 17th consecutive losing season, getting two home runs from\nDerrek Lee and a solid start from pitcher Ted Lilly while winning 4â2. The\nPirates will finish below a .500 average, just as they have every season since .\nThe losing string is a major league record and the longest for any team in the\nfour major North American professional team sports. **Chris Carpenter of the St.\nLouis Cardinals tossed a one-hit shutout with 10 strikeouts against the\nMilwaukee Brewers, 3â0. Carpenter also threw a one-hitter shutout with 10\nstrikeouts for St. Louis in (Blue Jays).

IbÃ¡Ã±ez and Utley both\nreached their 30th HR of the season, joining Werth (32) and Ryan Howard (38),\nmaking the Philliies the 12th team in MLB history with four 30-HRs players and\nonly the second with three left-handed batters to reach 30 homers (Howard,\nIbÃ¡Ã±ez and Utley). The first was the 1929 Phillies trio of Lefty O'Doul, Don\nHurst and Chuck Klein. The other 11 teams with four 30-HRs players in a season\nare the 1977 Dodgers, 1995 Rockies, 1996 Rockies, 1997 Dodgers, 1997 Rockies,\n1998 Braves, 1999 Rockies, 2000 Blue Jays, 2000 Angels, 2004 Chicago Cubs and\n2006 White Sox. **The Chicago Cubs tied a major league record with eight\nconsecutive hits to start a game in a 9â4 win against the Pittsburgh Pirates.\nThe Cubs also accomplished this feat in (both against Pittsburgh). Only four\nother teams had eight straight hits to start a game: 1975 Phillies, 1975\nPirates, 1981 Athletics and 1990 Yankees. ]]\n\n*September 9 **Brian Roberts of the Baltimore Orioles became just the fourth\nplayer in major league history to have three seasons with at least 50 doubles\n(2004, 2008â'09). The other players to reach 50 or more doubles at least three\ntimes were Hall of Famers Tris Speaker (1912, 1920â'21, 1923), Paul Waner (1928,\n1932, 1936) and Stan Musial (1944, 1946, 1953). Roberts also set the all-time\nrecord for second basemen with his three 50-double seasons. HoF Billy Herman\n(1935â'36) and Houston Astros' Craig Biggio (1998â'99) both collected 50-plus\ndoubles in back-to-back seasons but never came close to matching it again.\n**Scott Feldman earned his club-record 12th road win of the season as the Texas\nRangers defeated the Cleveland Indians, 10â0, at Progressive Field. Feldman's\neight successive road wins is the longest such streak in club history. **Derek\nJeter collects three hits against the Tampa Bay Rays to give him 2,721 for his\nYankee career, and tying him with Lou Gehrig atop the Yankees' all-time hits\nlist. *September 10 â Ian Desmond hit a home run and drove in four runs in his\nmajor league debut to lead the Washington Nationals to a 8â7 victory over the\nPhiladelphia Phillies. Desmond is only the second player since (first season run\nbatted in was recorded as an official statistic) to drive in at least four runs\nas a shortstop in his major league debut. The other player to do it was Ted\nKazanski for the Phillies against the Cubs on June 25, . Matt Stairs of the\nPhillies belted the second pinch-hit grand slam of his career in a lost cause.\n*September 11 â With a single off Chris Tillman to lead off the third inning,\nDerek Jeter collected his 2,722nd career hit to pass Lou Gehrig as the all-time\nYankees hit leader. *September 13 â In the second inning of the second game of a\ndoubleheader against the Texas Rangers, Ichiro Suzuki hits a slow grounder to\nRangers shortstop Elvis Andrus that he legs out for a single. It is his 200th\nhit of the season, giving him a MLB record nine consecutive 200 hit seasons.\n*September 15 **In the eighth inning of the Toronto Blue Jays' 10â4 victory over\nthe New York Yankees at Yankee Stadium, a bench clearing brawl breaks out.\nEarlier in the game Blue Jays third baseman Edwin EncarnaciÃ³n had been hit by a\nSergio Mitre pitch, and in the eighth inning second baseman Aaron Hill is hit by\nMark Melancon. In what appeared to be retaliation for the shot to Hill, Jays\npitcher Jesse Carlson throws a pitch behind Yankees catcher Jorge Posada in the\nbottom half of the inning. Both benches and bullpens clear, however, no punches\nare thrown. Posada ended up reaching on a walk, and scoring on a Brett Gardner\ndouble. As he crosses the plate, he bumps Carlson, who had been backing up home\nplate on the play. Posada is immediately ejected from the game, and the benches\nand bullpens empty for a second time as a fight breaks out between the two.\n**Daisuke Matsuzaka of the Boston Red Sox was activated following his near three-\nmonth stint on the disabled list, to become the fourth Japanese player on\nBoston's active roster, setting a Major League record. Matsuzaka joined fellow\npitchers Takashi Saito, Hideki Okajima and Junichi Tazawa. On August 7, in a 15-\ninning loss at Yankee Stadium, the Red Sox had set another record, becoming the\nfirst team to deploy three Japanese pitchers in the same game. *September 16 â\nJayson Werth's seventh-inning grand slam was the key hit in Philadelphia's 6â1\nwin against Washington. It was the Phillies' major-league leading tenth slam\nthis season and it made them only the sixth team in National League history to\nhit at least 10 slams in one season. Meanwhile, Ian Desmond went 2-for-4 against\nthe Phillies and is now 10-for-17 (.588) since making his major-league debut, to\nbecome the first major league player in more than half a century to collect 10\nhits over his first four career games. The last player to do that was Jim\nDavenport for the 1958 Giants, in the team's first season in San Francisco.\n*September 18 â With two outs in the ninth inning, and Mariano Rivera on the\nmound for the Yankees, Mike Sweeney hits a double, followed by a first-pitch\nhome run by Ichiro Suzuki to give the Mariners a 3â2 victory. It is the first\nwalk off home run of Ichiro's career. *September 20 â Chicago Cubs general\nmanager Jim Hendry suspends outfielder Milton Bradley for the final two weeks of\nthe season following comments he made in which he said the Cubs were \"not a\npositive environment.\" Hendry explained the decision with the\nfollowing:\n\n:Three days later, Bradley would issue an apology. *September 21 â Cecil Cooper\nis fired as manager of the Houston Astros. Third-base coach Dave Clark is named\ninterim manager for the thirteen games remaining in their season. *September 22\n** Dan Uggla of the Florida Marlins hits his 30th home run of the season in the\nsecond game of a doubleheader against the Philadelphia Phillies, giving Uggla\nthree consecutive seasons of 30-or-more homers. He is the first player in major\nleague history to do so while playing at least 100 games at second base. Ryne\nSandberg (â), Alfonso Soriano (â) and Chase Utley (-2009) are the only other\nsecond basemen with 30-HRs in 100 games during two straight seasons. ** Mark\nReynolds of the Arizona Diamondbacks strikes out three times for a total of 206\non the season, breaking the single-season record of 204 that he set in .\n*September 23 â The Atlanta Braves announce that manager Bobby Cox will retire\nfrom his managerial position at the conclusion of the season and immediately\nenter into a five-year contract that will enable him to continue serving as a\nconsultant with the organization. *September 24: **Sporting News published the\nnames of the players on its All-Decade Team. **Sporting News named St. Louis\nCardinals first baseman Albert Pujols the MLB Athlete of the Decade. **Sporting\nNews named Joe Torre the Manager of the Decade. He managed the New York Yankees\nfrom 2000 to 2007 and the Los Angeles Dodgers from 2008 to 2009. **Sporting News\nchose the Boston Red Sox as the Team of the Decade. ]] *September 25 â Ian\nKinsler's three-run home run in the Texas Rangers' 8â3 victory over the visiting\nTampa Bay Rays is his 30th home run of the season. Combined with his 30th stolen\nbase a day before, he becomes only the second player in Rangers' history to put\nup a 30-HR 30-SB season, joining Alfonso Soriano, who did it in . Kinsler also\njoined Soriano, who also had 30â30 seasons for the Yankees (â), and with Brandon\nPhillips of the Reds () as the only 30/30 second basemen in Major League\nhistory. *September 26 **Ichiro Suzuki is ejected for the first time in his\nprofessional career, ending a streak that Suzuki started in 1992 as a rookie\nwith the Japan's Orix BlueWave. It happened in the top of the fifth inning of\nthe Mariners' eventual extra-inning 5â4 loss to the Blue Jays at Rogers Centre,\nand was also the first ejection of a Mariners player, coach or manager this\nseason. **Marlon Byrd of the Texas Rangers hit his sixth career grand slam in\nthe 15â3 victory against the visiting Tampa Bay Rays. Byrd, who homered twice in\nthe game, now has 59 lifetime home runs, becoming the only player in major-\nleague history with fewer than 60 home runs and six-or-more grand slams. **The\nSt. Louis Cardinals clinch the National League Central Division title with a 6â3\nvictory over the Colorado Rockies. It is the eighth division title for the\nCardinals manager Tony La Russa in his 14-year tenure in St. Louis. **VÃ­ctor\nMartÃ­nez of the Boston Red Sox singled with two outs in the ninth off Mariano\nRivera, extending his hitting streak to 25 games, in a 3â0 defeat against New\nYork at Yankee Stadium. Martinez's streak is the longest by a Venezuelan-born\nplayer, surpassing the 59-year, 24-game streak set by Chico Carrasquel in .\nMartÃ­nez's streak ends the following day, but he bats 34-for-95 (.358) during\nthe streak. **Team Canada earned its first bronze medal in the 2009\nBaseball World Cup by upending Puerto Rico, 6â2, in Grosseto, Italy. The third\nplace finish is the senior national team's highest placing since earning a\nbronze medal at the 1999 Pan American Games in Winnipeg, Canada. The medal also\nadds to Baseball Canada's total which is now 11 with two bronze and a silver for\nthe women's national team and five bronze and one gold (1991 world junior) for\nthe national junior team. *September 27 **The New York Yankees secure their 16th\nAL division crown since (11th since ) with a 4â2 win over their arch-rivals, the\nBoston Red Sox. The Yankees put a bow on this title with their major-league\nleading 100th win, as second baseman Robinson CanÃ³ collected his 200th hit of\nthe season. CanÃ³'s infield partner, shortstop Derek Jeter, already has 200 hits\nin the season, becoming the first second baseman/shortstop combo to accomplish\nthe feat in major league history. **Team USA took advantage of a critical error\nby Cuba, scoring six runs with two outs in the seventh inning on its way to a\n10â5 win in the gold medal game of the 2009 Baseball World Cup in Nettuno,\nItaly. Paired with its win over Cuba in the 2007 tournament, the Americans have\nwon back-to-back World Cup titles for the first time since and . Justin Smoak,\nTerry Tiffee and Jon Weber were named to the IBAF World Cup All-Tournament Team.\nSmoak was also named the Baseball World Cup's Most Valuable Player. **In the\neighth inning of the Cardinals' 4â3 loss to the Rockies in Coors Field, Albert\nPujols recorded his 181st assist of the season, setting a National League record\nfor most assists in a season by a first baseman. The previous record had been\nset by the Cubs' Mark Grace in .

Los\nAngeles is headed back to the playoffs for the sixth time in eight years.\n**Carlos Lee of the Houston Astros drove in his 100th run of the season, giving\nhim a five-year streak of reaching triple-digits in RBIs. Only four other\nplayers have driven in at least 100 runs in each of the last five seasons: Bobby\nAbreu, Miguel Cabrera, Albert Pujols and Mark Teixeira. **Robinson CanÃ³ hit his\n25th home run of the season, and he now has 201 hits as a second baseman this\nyear.

Everth\nCabrera of the San Diego Padres did that on August 7. The only other pitchers in\nmajor-league history to surrender two game-ending grand slams in one season were\nSatchel Paige (), Lindy McDaniel () and Lee Smith (). **Justin Masterson went\nthe distance for the Cleveland Indians and struck out 12 but the Chicago White\nSox scratched out a run in the top of the sixth inning to win 1â0. Masterson is\nthe first major-leaguer to lose a complete game by a 1â0 score while pitching at\nleast nine innings and striking out a dozen or more batters since May 6, , when\nPedro MartÃ­nez of the Red Sox struck out 17 but was beaten by Tampa Bay at\nFenway Park.\n\nOctober *October 1: **Ichiro Suzuki of the Seattle Mariners collected his 220\nhit of season to set a new Major League mark.

Upton not only hit for the cycle in the\nRays' 13â4 victory over the Yankees, but he did it by the end of the fifth\ninning. It was the quickest cycle since Mike Lansing of the Rockies accumulated\nall four hits within the first four innings against the Diamondbacks on June 18,\n. The Rays scored nine runs in the first three innings to deny CC Sabathia his\nfirst 20-win season. Sabathia was the first pitcher in nearly 30 years to allow\nas many as nine runs in a game while needing one more victory for the first 20-\nwin season of his career. The last pitcher to do so was Rick Langford of the\nAthletics in . **Adam Wainwright of the Cardinals also failed to earn his 20th\nvictory when the Brewers rallied for six runs in the seventh inning of their\neventual 12â6 win. 2009 will be only the second season in major-league history\nwithout a 20-game winner (see ), excluding seasons that were shortened by work\nstoppages. *October 3: **In the early morning hours, following an 0â4\nperformance in a 8â0 loss to the Chicago White Sox the previous night, Miguel\nCabrera is picked up by Birmingham, Michigan police after a 911 call from his\nwife, Rosangel. The couple began fighting when Miguel came home intoxicated\ntalking on the phone, and woke up their child. When police arrive at his\nsuburban Detroit home at 5:00 AM, Cabrera blows a 0.26 on the breathalyzer\nadministered on the scene, which is three times Michigan's legal limit for\ndriving. Tigers GM Dave Dombrowski picks him up at the station at roughly 7:30\nAM. That evening, Cabrera goes 0â4 and strands six runners in the Tigers' 5â1\nloss to the ChiSox. **The San Diego Padres announce that executive vice\npresident/general manager Kevin Towers will not return for the season. In a\nsimilar movement, the Toronto Blue Jays dismissed general manager J. P.\nRicciardi after eight seasons. **Ryan Howard is in select company after hitting\nhis 45th home run of the season in Philadelphia's loss to Florida. The 29-year\nold Howard is only the second player to do that before his 30th birthday, being\nthe other Harmon Killebrew (1961 to 1964, at 28). Beside this, as Howard nears\nthe end of his fifth full season he has a career total of 640 runs batted in,\nmoving past for the third-highest RBI total after five seasons in Major League\nhistory over Lou Gehrig (639, 1926â'30) and Ted Williams (638, 1939â'42, 1946).\nThe leader and runner-up are Joe DiMaggio (691, 1936â'40) and Hal Trosky (663,\n1934â'38). *October 4: **Alex Rodriguez belted a three-run homer and\na grand slam in New York's 10-run 6th inning, leading the Yankees to a 10â2\nvictory over the Rays in the regular-season finale. Rodriguez' 30th home run of\nthe season made him the first AL player to have 7 RBIs in a single inning. The\nonly other Major Leaguers to have 7 or more RBIs in an inning since are Fernando\nTatÃ­s, who hit two grand slams as a member of the Cardinals to collect 8 RBIs\nagainst the Dodgers in the third inning on April 23, 1999, and Ed Cartwright,\nwho hit a 3-run homer and a grand slam in the 3rd inning on September 23, 1890\nfor 7 RBIs. Rodriguez also reached the 30 HR/100 RBI plateau for the 12th\nconsecutive season. **Albert Pujols broke Bill Buckner's 1985 major-league\nrecord for assists by a first baseman, with his 185th. **The Detroit Tigers and\nMinnesota Twins each win their 162nd games, leading to a one-game tiebreaker at\nthe Metrodome to decide the American League Central champion. It is the third\nconsecutive season â the longest such streak in MLB history â the regular season\ngoes beyond 162 games, and requires a division tiebreaker to finalize the\npostseason field. The Twins become the first club ever to play such a tiebreaker\nin consecutive years, having lost the AL Central tiebreaker against the Chicago\nWhite Sox in . The Colorado Rockies beat the San Diego Padres for the National\nLeague Wild Card to start this three-year extension. **Mark Reynolds of the\nArizona Diamondbacks strikes out three times, setting a new season record of 223\nstrikeouts in a season. *October 5 â The Milwaukee Brewers and Trevor Hoffman\nagree to a one-year deal with a mutual option for 2011. *October 6: **Kansas\nCity Royals first baseman Billy Butler was named winner of the AL Player of the\nMonth Award for September.

Both teams score a run in the tenth\nbefore an Alexi Casilla single in the twelfth inning scores Carlos GÃ³mez from\nsecond to give the Twins the 6â5 victory. They become the first team in Major\nLeague history to win the division after trailing by three games with four to\nplay.

The only other manager in Major League history to lead his teams to at\nleast six postseason series sweeps is the manager Torre defeated in this year's\nNLDS, Tony La Russa, who has seven sweeps on his resume. *October 11: **The Los\nAngeles Angels came up with a three-run comeback in the ninth inning off\nJonathan Papelbon, to clinch the ALDS with a 7â6 victory against the Boston Red\nSox at Fenway Park. Vladimir Guerrero brought home the tying and winning runs\nwith a single and the Angels swept aside the Red Sox in stunning fashion. **The\nNew York Yankees defeated the Minnesota Twins, 4â1, to complete a three-game\nsweep of their ALDS and record their first victory in a postseason series since\n, thanks to Andy Pettitte, who pitched a gem, and home runs from Alex Rodriguez\nand Jorge Posada.

Humphrey\nMetrodome. *October 12 â The Philadelphia Phillies are headed back to the NLCS\nafter eliminating the Colorado Rockies from the playoffs with a three-run, ninth-\ninning rally, in Game 4 of the NLDS. The defending World Series Champions blew a\none-run lead in the bottom of the eighth inning before pulling out a 5â4 victory\nat Coors Field. The Phillies-Rockies series was the only one in the first round\nnot to end in a three-game sweep.

Ryan Howard hit a solo homer in the fourth\ninning to put the Phillies ahead, but an eighth-inning bullpen collapse combined\nwith a crucial error by Chase Utley and a bases-loaded, walk-RBI to Andre Ethier\nmarked the difference. Phillies' Pedro MartÃ­nez and Dodgers' Vicente Padilla\nfound themselves in a pitching duel during seven-plus innings, but they were not\na factor in the decision. Hong-Chih Kuo was the winning pitcher and Chan Ho Park\nthe loser, while Jonathan Broxton earned the save. The series is tied 1â1. **CC\nSabathia held the Los Angeles Angels to four hits and a run in eight strong\ninnings, in a 4â1 victory that gave the New York Yankees a 1â0 lead in the ALCS.\nHideki Matsui (2), Alex Rodriguez and Derek Jeter each drove in runs, and\nMariano Rivera got the save. Three Angels errors tied a franchise postseason\nrecord and led to two Yankees runs, which served as a support for Sabathia, who\ndid not need all that much help to prevail in his duel against John Lackey.\n*October 17 â Alex Rodriguez hit a tying home run in the bottom of the 11th\ninning to negate a Chone Figgins go-ahead RBI-single, and the New York Yankees\nscored the winning run on a 13th inning error by Maicer Izturis to edge the Los\nAngeles Angels, 4â3, for a 2â0 lead in the best-of-seven ALCS. *October 18 â\nRyan Howard played a key role in a four-run first inning and Cliff Lee dominated\nLos Angeles Dodgers over eight innings, giving the Philadelphia Phillies an 11â0\nwin and a 2â1 NLCS lead. With his first-inning two-run triple off Hiroki Kuroda,\nHoward became the first player in Major League history to record an RBI in seven\nconsecutive playoff games in the same year. Lee allowed just three hits and\nstruck out 10 in eight scoreless innings to improve to 2â0 with a 0.74 ERA in\nthree starts this postseason. Howard is within one game shy of matching\nlegendary Lou Gehrig, who holds the all-time record with an RBI in eight\nconsecutive postseason games that spanned from through . *October 19: **For the\nsecond straight game, the Los Angeles Angels and New York Yankees played into\ntense extra innings, until Jeff Mathis drove home Howie Kendrick in the 11th\ninning, and the Angels survived a second straight ALCS thriller, beating New\nYork 5â4 to trim the Yankees' series lead to 2â1. Ervin Santana earned the win,\nwhile Kendrick homered and tripled before singling with two outs in the 11th off\nAlfredo Aceves, who took the lost. **Jimmy Rollins lined a two-run double with\ntwo outs in the ninth inning off Jonathan Broxton and the Philadelphia Phillies\nrallied past the Los Angeles Dodgers, 5â4, for a 3â1 lead in the NLCS. Brad\nLidge got two outs in the ninth to earn the win, while Ryan Howard hit a two-run\nhome run to extend his Major League record to eight consecutive playoffs games\nwith an RBI within the same year. **Three Phillies members made history during\ntheir 5â4 victory against the Dodgers in Game 4 of the NLCS. There have been\n1,251 postseason games in MLB history, according to the [[Elias Sports Bureau]].\nOnly three players ever ended a game with a walk-off extra-base hit by a team\nthat was one out away from losing, (1) Jimmy Rollins with his two-run double in\nthe ninth inning off Jonathan Broxton in this game, (2) LA Dodgers' Kirk Gibson\nwith his memorable home run off Oakland Athletics' closer Dennis Eckersley in\nGame 1 of the 1988 World Series, and (3) Brooklyn Dodgers' Cookie Lavagetto with\nhis two-run double off Bill Bevens in Game 4 (and final) of the 1947 World\nSeries, when Yankees pitcher Bevens got within one out of the first no-hitter\ngame in World Series history, and then lost it all. Beside this, Ryan Howard\njoined Lou Gehrig as the only players who have recorded an RBI in eight\nconsecutive playoff games, a mark that Gehrig set 77 years ago, and also matched\nMike Schmidt's career-club, playoff-record with his sixth career postseason home\nrun. In addition to Rollins and Howard, Chase Utley surpassed the legendary\nGehrig when he reached base safely in his 24th consecutive postseason games.\nFormer Orioles' first baseman Boog Powell holds the Major League record by\nreaching safely in 25 consecutive postseason games that spanned from 1966 to\n1971. *October 20: **Alex Rodriguez homered in his third straight game and CC\nSabathia pitched five-hit ball on three days' rest, and the New York Yankees\ntook a 10â1 victory over the Los Angeles Angeles in Game 4 of the ALCS, moving\njust one win away from going to their 40th World Series. Rodriguez drove in a\nrun for the eighth consecutive postseason game, tying a record that had been set\nby Lou Gehrig 77 years ago and Ryan Howard tied it less than 24 hours earlier.\n**Kenji Johjima opted out of the final two seasons with the Seattle Mariners,\nallowing him to sign with a Japanese team. Johjima's contract gave him the right\nto end it by November 15 for the purpose of finishing his career in Japan. He\ngave up salaries of $7.7 million next year and $8.1 million in 2011. Johjima hit\n.268 in his four seasons with Seattle, with 48 homers and 198 RBIs in 462 games.\nHe holds the AL record for hits by a rookie catcher with 147 in 2006. His 18\nhomers in this season tied the Mariners' record for most by a catcher. *October\n21 â Jayson Werth homered twice, Shane Victorino and Pedro Feliz also connected\nand the Philadelphia Phillies beat the Los Angeles Dodgers, 10â4, in Game 5 of\nthe NLCS to win their second straight NL pennant.

Phillies' pitcher Cliff\nLee gave up an unearned run on six hits, while striking out 10 without walking a\nbatter in a complete game effort. Chase Utley led the Philadelphia attack with\ntwo solo home runs off left-handed CC Sabathia, the losing pitcher. It is the\nfirst time a left-handed batter has hit two homers off a lefty pitcher since\nBabe Ruth, when he did it against Bill Sherdel of the St. Louis Cardinals in\nGame 4 of the 1928 World Series. With a walk in the first inning, Utley also set\na Major League Baseball record by reaching base safely in his 26th consecutive\npostseason game, breaking the 25-game mark of Boog Powell from 1966 to 1971.\n*October 29 â The New York Yankees evened the World Series at a game apiece with\na 3â1 victory against the Philadelphia Phillies. In the biggest start of his\ncareer, A. J. Burnett threw seven solid innings to get his first postseason win,\nholding the Phillies to only one run and four hits, while Mark Teixeira and\nHideki Matsui provided the offensive support with solo home runs off Pedro\nMartÃ­nez, the losing pitcher. Mariano Rivera threw two scoreless innings in\nrelief and earned the save. *October 30 â The New York Yankees beat the\nPhiladelphia Phillies 8â5, at Citizens Bank Park, to take a 2â1 advantage in the\nWorld Series. Alex Rodriguez belted the first video-reviewed home run in World\nSeries history to support another winning Andy Pettitte effort, while Nick\nSwisher and Hideki Matsui added solo shots. Cole Hamels was the losing pitcher.\nPettitte, who overcame two homers from Jayson Werth, earned his Major League-\nleading 17th postseason-win.

Johnny Damon sparked the rally with a two-out single\nand two stolen bases off reliever and loser Brad Lidge, before a hit-by-pitch to\nMark Teixeira and a go ahead RBI-double by Alex Rodriguez. A two-run, RBI-single\nby Jorge Posada sealed the victory. Both starters, Yankees' CC Sabathia and\nPhillies' Joe Blanton, gave a good pitching effort. Joba Chamberlain was\ncredited with the victory after one-inning relief, while Mariano Rivera earned\nthe save. Damon also singled, doubled, scored and drove in a run early in the\ngame. The Phillies offense was led by Chase Utley, who hit an RBI-double and his\nthird home run of the Series, while Pedro Feliz added a solo homer. *November 2\nâ The Philadelphia Phillies got a 8â6 victory over the New York Yankees, which\nforced the World Series to Game 6 at Yankee Stadium. Chase Utley hit two home\nruns with four RBI and joined Reggie Jackson as the only players who have batted\nfive home runs in the Series, a record that set Jackson in 1977, which gave him\nthe nickname ''Mr. October''. Cliff Lee improved to 4â0 with a 1.56 ERA in his\nfirst postseason and Ryan Madson earned the save, while RaÃºl IbÃ¡Ã±ez added a\nhomer and two RBI.

Pettitte beat Minnesota and the Anaheim in the previous AL\nplayoffs. Philadelphia fell two wins short of becoming the first NL team to\nrepeat as World Series champions since the 1975â'76 Cincinnati Reds. Phillies\nsecond baseman Chase Utley tied Reggie Jackson's record with five home runs in a\nSeries, but first baseman Ryan Howard stroke out 13 times to set a record in the\nClassic.
