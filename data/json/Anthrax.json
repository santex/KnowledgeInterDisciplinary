Such spores can be found on all\ncontinents, even Antarctica. When spores are inhaled, ingested, or\ncome into contact with a skin lesion on a host, they may become reactivated and\nmultiply rapidly.\n\nAnthrax commonly infects wild and domesticated herbivorous mammals that ingest\nor inhale the spores while grazing. Ingestion is thought to be the most common\nroute by which herbivores contract anthrax. Carnivores living in the same\nenvironment may become infected by consuming infected animals. Diseased animals\ncan spread anthrax to humans, either by direct contact (e.g., inoculation of\ninfected blood to broken skin) or by consumption of a diseased animal's flesh.\n\nAnthrax spores can be produced [[in vitro]] and used as a biological weapon.\nAnthrax does not spread directly from one infected animal or person to another;\nit is spread by spores. These spores can be transported by clothing or shoes.\nThe body of an animal that had active anthrax at the time of death can also be a\nsource of anthrax spores.\n\nUntil the twentieth century, anthrax infections killed hundreds of\nthousands of animals and people each year worldwide. {{Cite journal\n | author=Cherkasskiy, B.

Anthrax is especially rare\nin dogs and cats, as is evidenced by a single reported case in the USA in\n2001. \"[http://dogsinthenews.com/issues/0110/articles/011030a.htm Can Dogs\nGet Anthrax?]\" Canine Nation, 30 October 2001. Retrieved 17 February\n2007. Anthrax typically does not cause disease in carnivores and\nscavengers, even when these animals consume anthrax-infected carcasses.

countries without widespread\nveterinary or human public health programs.\n\nBacillus anthracis bacterial spores are soil-borne, and, because of their long\nlifetime, they are still present globally and at animal burial sites of anthrax-\nkilled animals for many decades; spores have been known to have reinfected\nanimals over 70 years after burial sites of anthrax-infected animals
