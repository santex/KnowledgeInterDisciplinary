{"cursor":"7458","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n (Cercis siliquastrum)]] ; the cotyledon itself remains within the seed]]\n\n.]] with eight cotyledons]] A 'cotyledon' (; \"seed leaf\" from Greek: ÎºÎ¿ÏÏÎ»Î·Î´ÏÎ½\nkotylÄdÅn, gen.: ÎºÎ¿ÏÏÎ»Î·Î´ÏÎ½Î¿Ï kotylÄdonos, from ÎºÎ¿ÏÏÎ»Î· ''kotÃ½lÄ'' \"cup, bowl\"),\nis a significant part of the embryo within the seed of a plant. Upon\ngermination, the cotyledon may become the embryonic first leaves of a seedling.\nThe number of cotyledons present is one characteristic used by botanists to\nclassify the flowering plants (angiosperms). Species with one cotyledon are\ncalled monocotyledonous (\"monocots\"). Plants with two embryonic leaves are\ntermed dicotyledonous (\"dicots\") and placed in the class Magnoliopsida.\n\nIn the case of dicot seedlings whose cotyledons are photosynthetic, the\ncotyledons are functionally similar to leaves. However, true leaves and\ncotyledons are developmentally distinct. Cotyledons are formed during\nembryogenesis, along with the root and shoot meristems, and are therefore\npresent in the seed prior to germination. True leaves, however, are formed post-\nembryonically (i.e. after germination) from the shoot apical meristem, which is\nresponsible for generating subsequent aerial portions of the plant.\n\nThe cotyledon of grasses and many other monocotyledons is a highly modified leaf\ncomposed of a [[Scutellum (botany)|scutellum]] and a [[coleoptile]]. The\nscutellum is a tissue within the seed that is specialized to absorb stored food\nfrom the adjacent endosperm. The coleoptile is a protective cap that covers the\nplumule (precursor to the stem and leaves of the plant).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!

Within each\nspecies, there is often still some variation in cotyledon numbers, e.g. Monterey\nPine (Pinus radiata) seedlings have 5â9, and Jeffrey Pine (Pinus jeffreyi) 7â13\n(Mirov 1967), but other species are more fixed, with e.g. Mediterranean Cypress\nalways having just two cotyledons. The highest number reported is for Big-cone\nPinyon (Pinus maximartinezii), with 24 (Farjon & Styles 1997).  The\ncotyledons may be ephemeral, lasting only days after emergence, or persistent,\nenduring a year or more on the plant. The cotyledons contain (or in the case of\ngymnosperms and monocotyledons, have access to) the stored food reserves of the\nseed. As these reserves are used up, the cotyledons may turn green and begin\nphotosynthesis, or may wither as the first true leaves take over food production\nfor the seedling.\n","linknr":212,"url":"Cotyledon","recorded":1362482594,"links":52,"instances":["fruit"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Plant anatomy","Plant morphology","Plant reproduction","Leaves"],"headings":["Epigeal versus hypogeal development","History","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/Cotyledon-Cercis_siliquastrum.jpg/220px-Cotyledon-Cercis_siliquastrum.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/01/Monocot_vs_dicot_crop_Pengo.jpg/150px-Monocot_vs_dicot_crop_Pengo.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7c/Peanut_cotyledons.jpg/220px-Peanut_cotyledons.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3d/09-05-31_Abeto_Douglas.jpg/220px-09-05-31_Abeto_Douglas.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a6/Seekiefer_%28Pinus_halepensis%29_14d_1.jpg/150px-Seekiefer_%28Pinus_halepensis%29_14d_1.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["nut","fruit"]],"members":["nut"],"related":["Greek_language","Cotyla","Embryo","Seed","Plant","Germination","Leaf","Flowering_plant","Monocotyledonous","Dicotyledonous","Magnoliopsida","Poaceae","Endosperm","Gymnosperm","Hypocotyl","Monterey_Pine","Jeffrey_Pine","Cupressus_sempervirens","Big-cone_Pinyon","Seed","Photosynthesis","Epigeal","Hypogeal","Nut_(fruit)","Acorn","Meristem","Araucariaceae","Fabaceae","Lily_seed_germination_types","Common_bean","Runner_bean","Marcello_Malpighi","John_Ray","Systematics"]}
