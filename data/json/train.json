Motive power is\nprovided by a separate locomotive or individual motors in self-propelled\nmultiple units. Although historically steam propulsion dominated, the most\ncommon modern forms are diesel and electric locomotives, the latter supplied by\noverhead wires or additional rails. Other energy sources include horses, rope or\nwire, gravity, pneumatics, batteries, and gas turbines. Train tracks usually\nconsists of two, three or four rails, with a limited number of monorails and\nmaglev guideways in the mix. The word 'train' comes from the Old French\ntrahiner, from the Latin trahere 'pull, draw'.<ref></ref>\n\nThere are various types of trains that are designed for particular purposes. A\ntrain can consist of a combination of one or more locomotives and attached\nrailroad cars, or a self-propelled multiple unit (or occasionally a single or\narticulated powered coach, called a railcar). The first trains were rope-hauled,\ngravity powered or pulled by horses. From the early 19th century almost all were\npowered by steam locomotives. From the 1910s onwards the steam locomotives began\nto be replaced by less labour intensive and cleaner (but more complex and\nexpensive) diesel locomotives and electric locomotives, while at about the same\ntime self-propelled multiple unit vehicles of either power system became much\nmore common in passenger service.\n\nA passenger train is one which includes passenger-carrying vehicles which can\noften be very long and fast. One notable and growing long-distance train\ncategory is high-speed rail. In order to achieve much faster operation over ,\ninnovative Maglev technology has been researched for years. In most countries,\nsuch as the United Kingdom, the distinction between a tramway and a railway is\nprecise and defined in law. The term light rail is sometimes used for a modern\ntram system, but it may also mean an intermediate form between a tram and a\ntrain, similar to a subway except that it may have level crossings.\n\nA freight train (also known as goods train) uses '[[Railroad car#Freight\ncars|freight cars]]' (also known as wagons or trucks) to transport goods or\nmaterials (cargo)&nbsp;– essentially any train that is not used for carrying\npassengers.\n",
