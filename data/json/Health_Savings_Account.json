{"cursor":"32350","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nA 'health savings account' ('HSA') is a tax-advantaged medical savings account\navailable to taxpayers in the United States who are enrolled in a high-\ndeductible health plan (HDHP). The funds contributed to an account are not subject to\nfederal income tax at the time of deposit. Unlike a flexible spending account\n(FSA), funds roll over and accumulate year to year if not spent. HSAs are owned\nby the individual, which differentiates them from company-owned Health\nReimbursement Arrangements (HRA) that are an alternate tax-deductible source of\nfunds paired with either HDHPs or standard health plans. HSA funds may currently\nbe used to pay for qualified medical expenses at any time without federal tax\nliability or penalty. However, beginning in early 2011 OTC (over the counter)\nmedications cannot be paid with HSA dollars without a doctor's\nprescription. Withdrawals for non-medical expenses are treated very\nsimilarly to those in an individual retirement account (IRA) in that they may\nprovide tax advantages if taken after retirement age, and they incur penalties\nif taken earlier. These accounts are a component of consumer-driven health care.\n\nProponents of HSAs believe that they are an important reform that will help\nreduce the growth of health care costs and increase the efficiency of the health\ncare system. According to proponents, HSAs encourage saving for future health\ncare expenses, allow the patient to receive needed care without a gatekeeper to\ndetermine what benefits are allowed and make consumers more responsible for\ntheir own health care choices through the required High-Deductible Health\nPlan.\n\nOpponents of HSAs say they worsen, rather than improve, the U.S. health system's\nproblems because people who are healthy will leave insurance plans while people\nwho have health problems will avoid HSAs. There is also debate about consumer\nsatisfaction with these plans.\n","linknr":352,"url":"Health_Savings_Account","recorded":1374762305,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Health_savings_account&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Health_savings_account&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","/wiki/Health_savings_account","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","/w/index.php?title=Health_Savings_Account&redirect=no","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Medical_savings_account","/wiki/Health_care_in_the_United_States","/wiki/Federal_Employees_Health_Benefits_Program","/wiki/Indian_Health_Service","/wiki/Veterans_Health_Administration","/wiki/Military_Health_System","/wiki/TRICARE","/wiki/Medicare_(United_States)","/wiki/Medicaid","/wiki/State_Children%27s_Health_Insurance_Program","/wiki/Program_of_All-Inclusive_Care_for_the_Elderly","/wiki/Health_insurance_in_the_United_States","/wiki/Consumer-driven_health_care","/wiki/Flexible_spending_account","/wiki/Health_Reimbursement_Account","/wiki/High-deductible_health_plan","/wiki/Medical_savings_account_(United_States)","/wiki/Managed_care","/wiki/Health_maintenance_organization","/wiki/Preferred_provider_organization","/wiki/Medical_underwriting","/wiki/Emergency_Medical_Treatment_and_Active_Labor_Act","/wiki/Health_Insurance_Portability_and_Accountability_Act","/wiki/Medicare_Prescription_Drug,_Improvement,_and_Modernization_Act","/wiki/Patient_Safety_and_Quality_Improvement_Act","/wiki/Health_Information_Technology_for_Economic_and_Clinical_Health_Act","/wiki/Patient_Protection_and_Affordable_Care_Act","/wiki/Massachusetts_health_care_reform","/wiki/Oregon_Health_Plan","/wiki/Vermont_health_care_reform","/wiki/SustiNet","/wiki/Connecticut","/wiki/Dirigo_Health","/wiki/Maine","/wiki/Fair_Share_Health_Care_Act","/wiki/Healthy_Howard","/wiki/Healthy_San_Francisco","/wiki/Template:Healthcare_in_the_United_States","/wiki/Template_talk:Healthcare_in_the_United_States","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Healthcare_in_the_United_States&action=edit","/wiki/Tax_advantage","/wiki/Medical_savings_account","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/High-deductible_health_plan","#cite_note-hsaref1-1","#cite_note-hsaref2-2","/wiki/Flexible_spending_account","/wiki/Health_Reimbursement_Arrangement","/wiki/Itemized_deduction","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Individual_retirement_account","/wiki/Consumer-driven_health_care","#cite_note-hsaref1-1","#History","#How_they_work","#Deposits","#Contribution_limits","#Investments","#Withdrawals","#HSAs_vs._other_medical_savings_plans","#Benefits","#Criticism","#Consumer_satisfaction","#HSAs_and_health_policy","#See_also","#Notes_and_references","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Health_savings_account&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Medicare_Prescription_Drug,_Improvement,_and_Modernization_Act","/wiki/George_W._Bush","/wiki/Medical_savings_account_(United_States)","/wiki/Kaiser_Family_Foundation","/wiki/Health_Reimbursement_Account","#cite_note-4","#cite_note-5","/wiki/America%E2%80%99s_Health_Insurance_Plans","#cite_note-6","/wiki/America%E2%80%99s_Health_Insurance_Plans","#cite_note-7","#cite_note-8","#cite_note-9","/wiki/Government_Accountability_Office","#cite_note-10","/wiki/America%E2%80%99s_Health_Insurance_Plans","#cite_note-11","/wiki/J._P._Morgan_Chase","#cite_note-12","/w/index.php?title=Health_savings_account&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=Health_savings_account&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/Section_125_plan","/wiki/Discrimination","/wiki/Form_1040","/wiki/Federal_Insurance_Contributions_Act_tax","/wiki/Social_Security_Wage_Base","/wiki/Internal_Revenue_Service","#cite_note-13","#cite_note-irsGuidelines-14","/wiki/Tax_Relief_and_Health_Care_Act_of_2006","#cite_note-15","#cite_note-16","/w/index.php?title=Health_savings_account&action=edit&section=4","http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p969.pdf","#cite_note-17","#cite_note-18","#cite_note-19","#cite_note-20","#cite_note-21","/w/index.php?title=Health_savings_account&action=edit&section=5","/wiki/Individual_Retirement_Account","/wiki/401(k)","/w/index.php?title=Health_savings_account&action=edit&section=6","/wiki/Income_tax","/wiki/Deductible","/wiki/Coinsurance","/wiki/Visual_perception","/wiki/Chiropractic","/wiki/Durable_medical_equipment","/wiki/Eyeglasses","/wiki/Hearing_aids","/wiki/Over-the-counter_medication","#cite_note-irsp502-22","#cite_n
