This epizootic saw\n2,000 cases of the disease in farms across most of the British countryside. Over\n10 million sheep and cattle were killed {{cite news\n| last = Boyde first = Carl coauthors = title = Inside Out work = pages =\n| language = publisher = BBC date = 2007-10-31 url = accessdate = }} in an\n| eventually successful attempt to halt the disease. Cumbria was the worst\n| affected area of the country, with 843 cases. With the intention of\n| controlling the spread of the disease, public rights of way across land were\n| closed by order. This damaged the popularity of the Lake District as a tourist\n| destination and led to the cancellation of that year's Cheltenham Festival as\n| well as the British Rally Championship for the 2001 season. By the time the\n| disease was halted by October 2001, the crisis was estimated to have cost the\n| United Kingdom Â£8bn ($16bn).\n","linknr":405,"url":"2001_United_Kingdom_foot-and-mouth_outbreak","recorded":1362501425,"links":23,"instances":["united_kingdom","scouting","uk","united_kingdom"],"pdf":["http://www.defra.gov.uk/footandmouth/pdf/fmdorigins1.pdf","http://www.data-archive.ac.uk/doc/5407%5Cmrdoc%5Cpdf%5Cq5407userguide.pdf","http://www.fawc.org.uk/pdf/ffconts.pdf"],"categories":["2001 in the United Kingdom|Foot and mouth crisis","History of agriculture in the United Kingdom","Public inquiries in the United Kingdom","2000s medical outbreaks","2001 health disasters","2001 in economics|United Kingdom Foot-And-Mouth Outbreak, 2001","United Kingdom general election, 2001","Foot-and-mouth outbreaks","Medical outbreaks in the United Kingdom"],"headings":["Background","Start of crisis","End of outbreak","Spread to the rest of Europe","Reports","Health and social consequences","Later reaction","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/FMD_note.jpg/220px-FMD_note.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c9/Banbury_Foot_and_Mouth_notice_%282%29.JPG/220px-Banbury_Foot_and_Mouth_notice_%282%29.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/FMD_outbreaks_UK_2001.png/220px-FMD_outbreaks_UK_2001.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d8/King%27s_Suttom_Foot_and_Mouth_notice_%283%29.JPG/220px-King%27s_Suttom_Foot_and_Mouth_notice_%283%29.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/12px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["ministry_of_agriculture,_fisheries_and_food","united_kingdom"],["national_farmers_union","uk"],["jamboree","scouting"],["ministry_of_agriculture,_fisheries_and_food","united_kingdom"],["chief_veterinary_officer","united_kingdom"]],"members":["chief_veterinary_officer","jamboree","national_farmers_union"],"related":["Agriculture","Tourism","Epizootic","Cumbria","Lake_District","Cheltenham_Festival","British_Rally_Championship","Quicklime","Groundwater","Environment_Agency","Slaughterhouse","Little_Warley","Essex","Heddon-on-the-Wall","Northumberland","Bobby_Waugh","Pallion","Notifiable_disease","Devon","Cornwall","Lake_District","Ministry_of_Agriculture,_Fisheries_and_Food_(United_Kingdom)","Widnes","Professor_David_King","Professor_Roy_Anderson","Epidemiologist","British_Army","Alexander_Birtwistle","Appleby-in-Westmorland","Department_for_Environment,_Food_and_Rural_Affairs","Vaccine","National_Farmers_Union_(UK)","The_Guardian","The_Guardian","Republic_of_Ireland","Netherlands","County_Louth","Irish_Army_Rangers","Sniper","Saint_Patrick's_Day","Ireland","Scouting","Jamboree_(Scouting)","Ireland_national_rugby_union_team","2001_Six_Nations_Championship","France","Belgium","Spain","Luxembourg","Germany","Finland","Sweden","Denmark","Italy","United_Kingdom_general_election,_2001","Tony_Blair","William_Hague","Second_World_War","Ministry_of_Agriculture,_Fisheries_and_Food_(United_Kingdom)","Secretary_of_State_for_the_Environment,_Transport_and_the_Regions","DEFRA","1967_United_Kingdom_foot-and-mouth_outbreak","Northumberland_Inquiry","Brian_Follett","Donald_Curry,_Baron_Curry_of_Kirkharle","High_Court_of_Justice","Margaret_Beckett","Secretary_of_State_for_Environment,_Food_and_Rural_Affairs","Royal_Society_of_Edinburgh","Ian_Cunningham","Scotland","Laboratory","Scientific_model","Vaccination","Contingency_plan","Vaccination","Biosecurity","Agricultural_industry","Scottish_Executive_Environment_and_Rural_Affairs_Department","Chief_Veterinary_Officer_(United_Kingdom)","Scottish_Environment_Protection_Agency","Standing_committee","Scottish_Executive","Farm_Animal_Welfare_Council","Lancaster_University","Economic_and_Social_Data_Service","1967_United_Kingdom_foot-and-mouth_outbreak","2007_United_Kingdom_foot-and-mouth_outbreak"]}
