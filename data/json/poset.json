A poset consists of a set\n together with a binary relation that indicates that, for certain pairs of\n elements in the set, one of the elements precedes the other. Such a relation is\n called a partial order to reflect the fact that not every pair of elements need\n be related: for some pairs, it may be that neither element precedes the other\n in the poset. Thus, partial orders generalize the more familiar total orders,\n in which every pair is related. A finite poset can be visualized through its\n Hasse diagram, which depicts the ordering relation.<ref></ref>\n\nA familiar real-life example of a partially ordered set is a collection of\npeople ordered by genealogical descendancy. Some pairs of people bear the descendant-\nancestor relationship, but other pairs bear no such relationship. Another real-\nlife example is the set of all street addresses in a town: 50 Maple St. is\nclearly \"before\" 52 Maple St. and \"after\" 48 Maple St., therefore all Maple St.\naddresses are ordered. Also, all Pine St. addresses are ordered in the same way.\nBut you cannot tell if 50 Maple St. is \"before\" or \"after\" 300 Pine St. in this\nway, so any set that includes addresses on both streets is only partially\nordered. The set of Maple St. addresses alone is a totally ordered set.\n","title":"Partially%20ordered%20set","headings":["Formal definition","Examples","Extrema","Orders on the Cartesian product of partially ordered sets","Strict and non-strict partial orders","Inverse and order dual","Number of partial orders","Linear extension","In category theory","Partial orders in topological spaces","Interval","See also","Notes","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["3: Total_order","3: Directed_acyclic_graph","2: Power_set","2: Totally_ordered_set","2: Antisymmetric_relation","2: Transitive_relation","2: Preorder","2: Real_number","2: Subset","2: Sequence","2: Natural_number","2: Reachability","2: On-Line_Encyclopedia_of_Integer_Sequences","1: Mathematics","1: Order_theory","1: Hasse_diagram","1: Genealogy","1: Binary_relation","1: Reflexive_relation","1: Antichain","1: Subsequence","1: Substring","1: Divisor#Divisibility_of_numbers","1: Linear_subspace","1: Vector_space","1: Sequence_space","1: Function_space","1: Greatest_element","1: Maximal_element","1: Upper_and_lower_bounds","1: Positive_integer","1: Prime_number","1: Cartesian_product","1: Lexicographical_order","1: Product_order","1: Reflexive_closure","1: Direct_product#Direct_product_of_binary_relations","1: Ordered_vector_space","1: Total_order#Orders_on_the_Cartesian_product_of_totally_ordered_sets","1: Irreflexive_relation","1: Binary_relation#Operations_on_binary_relations","1: Transitive_closure","1: Integer","1: Rational_number","1: Complex_number","1: Up_to","1: Linear_extension","1: Order-extension_principle","1: Computer_science","1: Topological_sorting","1: Equivalence_of_categories","1: Isomorphic","1: Initial_object","1: Terminal_object","1: Isomorphism-closed","1: Functor","1: Commutative_diagram","1: Topological_space","1: Product_space","1: Limit_of_a_sequence","1: Open_interval","1: Locally_finite_poset","1: Integers","1: Interval_order","1: Antimatroid","1: Causal_set","1: Comparability_graph","1: Directed_set","1: Graded_poset","1: Semilattice","1: Ordered_group","1: Poset_topology","1: Semiorder","1: Series-parallel_partial_order","1: Strict_weak_ordering","1: Complete_partial_order","1: Zorn's_lemma"]}
