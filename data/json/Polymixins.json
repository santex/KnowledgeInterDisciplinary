{"cursor":"6121","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"]] (R=H is polymyxin B1, R=CH 3 is polymyxin B2)]] 'Polymyxins' are\nantibiotics, with a general structure consisting\nof a cyclic peptide with a long hydrophobic tail. They disrupt the structure of\nthe bacterial cell membrane by interacting with its phospholipids. They are\nproduced by nonribosomal peptide synthetase systems in Gram-positive bacteria\nsuch as [[Paenibacillus polymyxa]] and are selectively toxic for Gram-\nnegative bacteria due to their specificity for the lipopolysaccharide molecule\nthat exists within many Gram-negative outer membranes.\n\nPolymyxins B and E (also known as colistin) are used in the treatment of Gram-\nnegative bacterial infections. The global problem of advancing antimicrobial\nresistance has led to a renewed interest in their use recently. Falagas ME,\nGrammatikos AP, Michalopoulos A.
