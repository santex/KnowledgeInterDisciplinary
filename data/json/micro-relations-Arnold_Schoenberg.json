He used the standard German\nspelling 'SchÃ¶nberg' until after his move to the United States in 1934\n(Steinberg 1995, 463), whereupon he altered it to Schoenberg \"in deference to\nAmerican practice\" (Foss 1951, 401), though one writer claims he made the change\na year earlier (Ross 2007, 45).\n\nSchoenberg's approach, both in terms of harmony and development, is among the\nmajor landmarks of 20th-century musical thought; at least three generations of\ncomposers in the European and American traditions have consciously extended his\nthinking or, in some cases, passionately reacted against it. During the rise of\nthe Nazi Party in Austria, his music was labeled as degenerate art.\n\nSchoenberg was widely known early in his career for his success in\nsimultaneously extending the traditionally opposed German Romantic styles of\nBrahms and Wagner. Later, his name would come to personify pioneering\ninnovations in atonality (although Schoenberg himself detested the term\n\"atonality\" as inaccurate in describing his intentions) that would become the\nmost polemical feature of 20th-century art music. In the 1920s, Schoenberg\ndeveloped the twelve-tone technique, a widely influential compositional method\nof manipulating an ordered series of all twelve notes in the chromatic scale. He\nalso coined the term developing variation, and was the first modern composer to\nembrace ways of developing motifs without resorting to the dominance of a\ncentralized melodic idea.\n\nSchoenberg was also a painter, an important music theorist, and an influential\nteacher of composition; his students included Alban Berg, Anton Webern, Hanns\nEisler, Egon Wellesz, and later John Cage, Lou Harrison, Earl Kim, Leon\nKirchner, and other prominent musicians. Many of Schoenberg's practices,\nincluding the formalization of compositional method, and his habit of openly\ninviting audiences to think analytically, are echoed in avant-garde musical\nthought throughout the 20th century. His often polemical views of music\nhistory and aesthetics were crucial to many significant 20th-century\nmusicologists and critics, including Theodor W. Adorno, Charles Rosen and Carl\nDahlhaus, as well as the pianists Artur Schnabel, Rudolf Serkin, Eduard\nSteuermann and Glenn Gould.\n\nSchoenberg's archival legacy is collected at the Arnold SchÃ¶nberg Center\nin Vienna.\n","linknr":690,"url":"Arnold_Schoenberg","recorded":1362476875,"links":82,"instances":["music_critic","schoenberg","music_critic","schoenberg","music","professor_of_music","music","schoenberg","music","music","music","music","music"],"pdf":["http://www.searchnewmusic.org/gur.pdf"],"categories":["20th-century
