{"cursor":"27562","size":14,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Secretion' is the process of elaborating, releasing, and oozing chemicals, or a\nsecreted chemical substance from a cell or gland. In contrast to excretion, the\nsubstance may have a certain function, rather than being a waste product. The\nclassical mechanism of cell secretion is via secretory portals at the cell\nplasma membrane called porosomes. Porosomes are\npermanent cup-shaped lipoprotein structure at the cell plasma membrane, where\nsecretory vesicles transiently dock and fuse to release intra-vesicular contents\nfrom the cell.\n\nSecretion in bacterial species means the transport or translocation of effector\nmolecules for example: proteins, enzymes or toxins (such as cholera toxin in\npathogenic bacteria for example [[Vibrio cholerae]]) from across the interior\n(cytoplasm or cytosol) of a bacterial cell to its exterior. Secretion is a very\nimportant mechanism in bacterial functioning and operation in their natural\nsurrounding environment for adaptation and survival.\n","linknr":556,"url":"Secretion","recorded":1362481423,"links":43,"instances":["biology","protein","taa","biology","anatomy","biology","bacteria"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Biochemistry","Cell biology","Physiology","Secretion|"],"headings":["Secretion in eukaryotic cells","Secretion in Gram negative bacteria","Secretion in Gram positive bacteria","See also","References","Bibliography","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/T1SS.svg/150px-T1SS.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c4/T2SS.svg/150px-T2SS.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/T3SS.svg/150px-T3SS.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3d/T4SS.svg/150px-T4SS.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/PDB_1r8i_EBI.jpg/220px-PDB_1r8i_EBI.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/T5SS.svg/150px-T5SS.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cell","biology"],["cell","biology"],["lumen","anatomy"],["chaperone","protein"],["vesicle","biology"],["vesicle","biology"],["cell","biology"],["tissue","biology"],["transformation","bacteria"],["trimeric_autotransporter_adhesins","taa"],["trimeric_autotransporter_adhesins","taa"]],"members":["vesicle","chaperone","trimeric_autotransporter_adhesins","tissue","lumen","cell","transformation"],"related":["Chemical_compounds","Chemical_substance","Cell_(biology)","Gland","Excretion","Porosomes","Proteins","Enzymes","Toxin","Cholera_toxin","Pathogenic_bacteria","Cytoplasm","Cytosol","Eukaryote","Cell_(biology)","Human_cells","Evolution","Protein","Protein_targeting","Protein_synthesis","Ribosome","Endoplasmic_reticulum","Protein_biosynthesis","Endoplasmic_reticulum","Lumen_(anatomy)","Glycosylation","Molecular","Chaperone_(protein)","Protein_folding","Misfolded_proteins","Endoplasmic-reticulum-associated_protein_degradation","Cytosol","Proteasome","Vesicle_(biology)","Golgi_apparatus","Golgi_apparatus","Glycosylation","Posttranslational_modifications","Proteins","Vesicle_(biology)","Cytoskeleton","Cell_(biology)","Insulin","Proinsulin","Vesicle_fusion","Cell_membrane","Porosome","Exocytosis","Biochemical","PH","Endoplasmic_reticulum","Lysosome","FGF1","AFGF","FGF2","BFGF","Interleukin-1","ER-golgi","Nonclassical_pathways","Human_cell_types","Endoplasmic_reticulum","Golgi_apparatus","Tissue_(biology)","Gastrointestinal_tract","Digestive_enzyme","Gastric_acid","Lung","Surfactant","Sebaceous_gland","Meibomian_gland","ATP_binding_cassette","Twin-arginine_translocation_pathway","RTX_toxin","Bacterial_conjugation","CagA","Pertussis_toxin","Type_IVB_secretion_system","Intracellular","Macromolecule","Bacterial_conjugation","Gram_negative_bacteria","Bacteria","Virulence","Transformation_(bacteria)","Ankyrin_repeat","VirE2","Trimeric_Autotransporter_Adhesins_(TAA)","Cytoplasm","Cytoplasmic_membrane","Signal_peptide","Accessory_secretory_system","Secretory_protein","Secretomics","Trimeric_Autotransporter_Adhesins_(TAA)"]}
