The simplest counterexample is the harmonic series\n\n:<math>1 + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{5} + \\cdots\n:=\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{n}.</math>\n\nThe divergence of the harmonic series was proven by the medieval mathematician\nNicole Oresme.\n\nIn specialized mathematical contexts, values can be usefully assigned to certain\nseries whose sequence of partial sums diverges. A 'summability method' or\n'summation method' is a partial function from the set of sequences of partial\nsums of series to values. For example, Cesàro summation assigns Grandi's\ndivergent series\n\n:<math>1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + \\cdots</math>\n\nthe value <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>. Cesàro summation is an 'averaging' method,\nin that it relies on the arithmetic mean of the sequence of partial sums. Other\nmethods involve analytic continuations of related series. In physics, there are\na wide variety of summability methods; these are discussed in greater detail in\nthe article on regularization.\n","title":"Divergent%20series","headings":["Theorems on methods for summing divergent series","Properties of summation methods","Axiomatic methods","Nörlund means","Abelian means","See also","References"]},"micro-relation":["4: CesÃ ro_summation","3: Borel_summation","2: Convergent_series","2: Sequence_transformation","2: PadÃ©_approximant","2: Levin-type_sequence_transformation","2: Renormalization","1: Mathematics","1: Infinite_series","1: Sequence","1: Partial_sum","1: Limit_of_a_sequence","1: Nicole_Oresme","1: Partial_function","1: Grandi's_series","1: Arithmetic_mean","1: Analytic_continuation","1: Physics","1: Abel's_theorem","1: Alfred_Tauber","1: Hahnâ€“Banach_theorem","1: Inconsistent","1: Axiom_of_choice","1: Zorn's_lemma","1: Mathematical_analysis","1: Abel_summation","1: Wiener's_tauberian_theorem","1: Banach_algebra","1: Fourier_analysis","1: Extrapolation","1: Perturbation_theory","1: Quantum_mechanics","1: Average","1: Bijection","1: Consistent","1: Divergent_geometric_series","1: Dirichlet_series","1: Heat-kernel_regularization","1: Mittag-Leffler_star","1: Maclaurin_series","1: 1_âˆ’_1_+_2_âˆ’_6_+_24_âˆ’_120_+_Â·_Â·_Â·","1: Zeta_function_regularization","1: Euler_summation","1: Lambert_summation","1: Silvermanâ€“Toeplitz_theorem"]}
