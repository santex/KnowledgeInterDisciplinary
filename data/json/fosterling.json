In many modern western societies foster care can be\norganised by the state to care for children with troubled family backgrounds,\nusually on a temporary basis. In many pre-modern societies fosterage was a form\nof patronage, whereby influential families cemented political relationships by\nbringing up each other's children, similar to arranged marriages, also based on\ndynastic or alliance calculations.\n\nThis practice was once common in Ireland, Wales, and Scotland.<ref>{{cite web|\nurl=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fosterage|title=Fosterage\n|publisher= Merriam-Webster |accessdate=2012-06-16}}</ref>\n",
