Its name is abbreviated as 'EWHC' for\nlegal citation purposes.\n\nThe High Court deals at first instance with all high value and high importance\ncases, and also has a supervisory jurisdiction over all subordinate courts and\ntribunals, with a few statutory exceptions.\n\nIt has three main divisions: the Queen's Bench Division, the Chancery Division,\nand the Family Division. The Senior Courts Costs Office, which quantifies legal\ncosts pursuant to orders for costs, serves all divisions. The jurisdictions\noverlap in some cases, and cases started in one division may be transferred by\ncourt order to another where appropriate. The differences of procedure and\npractice between divisions are partly historical, derived from the separate\ncourts which were merged into the single High Court by the 19th-century\nJudicature Acts, but are mainly driven by the usual nature of their work, for\nexample, conflicting evidence of fact is quite commonly given in person in the\nQueen's Bench Division, but evidence by affidavit is more usual in the Chancery\nDivision which is primarily concerned with points of law.\n\nMost High Court proceedings are heard by a single judge, but certain kinds of\nproceedings, especially in the Queen's Bench Division, are assigned to a\nDivisional Court, a bench of two or more judges. Exceptionally the court may sit\nwith a jury, but in practice normally only in defamation cases or cases against\nthe police. Litigants are normally represented by counsel, but may be\nrepresented by solicitors qualified to hold a right of audience, or they may act\nin person.\n\nIn principle the High Court is bound by its own previous decisions, but there\nare conflicting authorities as to what extent. Appeal from the High Court in\ncivil matters normally lies to the Court of Appeal, and thence in cases of\nimportance to the Supreme Court; in some cases a \"leapfrog\" appeal may be made\ndirectly to the Supreme Court. In criminal matters appeals from the Queen's\nBench Divisional Court are made directly to the Supreme Court.\n\nThe High Court is based at the Royal Courts of Justice on the Strand in the City\nof Westminster, London. It has district registries across England and Wales and\nalmost all High Court proceedings may be issued and heard at a district\nregistry. It is headed by the Lord Chief Justice.\n","linknr":249,"url":"High_Court_of_Justice","recorded":1375072486,"links":["/w/index.php?title=High_Court_of_Justice&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=High_Court_of_Justice&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/High_Court_of_Justice_(disambiguation)","/wiki/File:Royal_Court2.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Royal_Court2.jpg/250px-Royal_Court2.jpg","/wiki/Royal_Courts_of_Justice","/wiki/Strand,_London","/wiki/London","/wiki/England_and_Wales","/wiki/Strand,_London","/wiki/City_of_Westminster","/wiki/London","/wiki/Monarchy_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Judicature_Act_1873","/wiki/Appeal","/wiki/Court_of_Appeal_of_England_and_Wales","/wiki/Judicial_Committee_of_the_Privy_Council","http://www.hmcourts-service.gov.uk/infoabout/rcj/rcj.htm","/wiki/Lord_Chief_Justice_of_England_and_Wales","/wiki/Igor_Judge,_Baron_Judge","/wiki/Court_of_Appeal_of_England_and_Wales","/wiki/Crown_Court","/wiki/Senior_Courts_of_England_and_Wales","/wiki/Legal_citation","/wiki/Court_of_first_instance","/wiki/Queen%27s_Bench_Division","/wiki/Chancery_Division","/wiki/Family_Division","/wiki/Judicature_Acts","/wiki/Divisional_Court_(England_and_Wales)","/wiki/Counsel","/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Royal_Courts_of_Justice","/wiki/Strand,_London","/wiki/City_of_Westminster","/wiki/London","/wiki/England_and_Wales","/wiki/Lord_Chief_Justice_of_England_and_Wales","#Divisions","#Queen.27s_Bench_Division","#Chancery_Division","#Family_Division","#Judges","#Circuits","#Notes_and_references","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=High_Court_of_Justice&action=edit&section=1","#cite_note-1","/w/index.php?title=High_Court_of_Justice&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Queen%27s_Bench","/wiki/Courts_of_England_and_Wales","/wiki/English_law","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/Royal_Coat_of_Arms_of_the_United_Kingdom_%28HM_Government%29.svg/150px-Royal_Coat_of_Arms_of_the_United_Kingdom_%28HM_Government%29.svg.png","/wiki/Ministry_of_Justice_(United_Kingdom)","/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_Justice","/wiki/Her_Majesty%27s_Courts_and_Tribunals_Service","/wiki/Judges%27_Council","/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Judicial_Committee_of_the_Privy_Council","/wiki/Court_of_Appeal_of_England_and_Wales","/wiki/Master_of_the_Rolls","/wiki/Lord_Justice_of_Appeal","/wiki/President_of_the_Queen%27s_Bench_Division","/wiki/President_of_the_Family_Division","/wiki/Chancellor_of_the_High_Court","/wiki/High_Court_judge","/wiki/County_Court","/wiki/List_of_county_courts_in_England_and_Wales","/wiki/County_Court_Bulk_Centre","/wiki/Judiciary_of_England_and_Wales#District_Judges","/wiki/Court_of_Protection","/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Court_of_Appeal_of_England_and_Wales","/wiki/Lord_Chief_Justice_of_England_and_Wales","/wiki/Lord_Justice_of_Appeal","/wiki/President_of_the_Queen%27s_Bench_Division","/wiki/High_Court_judge","/wiki/Crown_Court","/wiki/List_of_Crown_Court_venues_in_England_and_Wales","/wiki/Circuit_judge_(England_and_Wales)","/wiki/Recorder_(judge)","/wiki/Magistrates%27_court_(England_and_Wales)","/wiki/Judiciary_of_England_and_Wales#District_Judges","/wiki/Magistrates_of_England_and_Wales","/wiki/Attorney_General_for_England_and_Wales","/wiki/Director_of_Public_Prosecutions_(England_and_Wales)","/wiki/Crown_Prosecution_Service","/wiki/General_Council_of_the_Bar","/wiki/Barristers_in_England_and_Wales","/wiki/Law_Society_of_England_and_Wales","/wiki/Solicitor","/wiki/Solicitor_Advocate","/wiki/Template:CourtsEnglandWales","/wiki/Template_talk:CourtsEnglandWales","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:CourtsEnglandWales&action=edit","/wiki/File:Scale_of_justice_2_new.jpeg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/48/Scale_of_justice_2_new.jpeg/28px-Scale_of_justice_2_new.jpeg","/wiki/Portal:Law_of_England_and_Wales","/wiki/Monarchy_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Lord_Chief_Justice_of_England_and_Wales","/wiki/Igor_Judge,_Baron_Judge","/wiki/President_of_the_Queen%27s_Bench_Division","/wiki/Constitutional_Reform_Act_2005","/wiki/Courts_of_England_and_Wales","/wiki/Criminal_Justice","#cite_note-CRA-2","/wiki/Igor_Judge","#cite_note-CRA-2","#cite_note-
