{"cursor":"28952","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Diabetic foot ulcer' is a major complication of diabetes mellitus, and probably\nthe major component of the diabetic foot. It occurs in 15% of all patients with\ndiabetes and precedes 84% of all lower leg amputations.\nMajor increase in mortality among diabetic patients, observed over the past 20\nyears is considered to be due to the development of macro and micro vascular\ncomplications, including failure of the wound healing process. Wound healing is\na âmake-upâ phenomenon for the portion of tissue that gets destroyed in any open\nor closed injury to the skin. Being a natural phenomenon, wound healing is\nusually taken care of by the bodyâs innate mechanism of action that works\nreliably most of the time. Key feature of wound healing is stepwise repair of\nlost extracellular matrix (ECM) that forms largest component of dermal skin\nlayer. Iakovos N Nomikos et al, Protective and Damaging\nAspects of Healing: A Review, Wounds 2006; 18 (7) 177-\n185.[http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/541978] Therefore controlled and\naccurate rebuilding becomes essential to avoid under or over healing that may\nlead to various abnormalities. But in some cases, certain disorders or\nphysiological insult disturbs wound healing process that otherwise goes very\nsmoothly in an orderly manner. Diabetes mellitus is one such metabolic disorder\nthat impedes normal steps of wound healing process. Many histopathological\nstudies show prolonged inflammatory phase in diabetic wounds, which causes delay\nin the formation of mature granulation tissue and a parallel reduction in wound\ntensile strength. McLennan S et al, Molecular aspects of\nwound healing, Primary intention(2006).14(1) 8-13\n[http://www.awma.com.au/journal/library/1401_01.pdf]\n\nNon-healing chronic diabetic ulcers are often treated with extracellular matrix\nreplacement therapy. So far, it is a common trend in diabetic foot care domain\nto use advanced moist wound therapy, bio-engineered tissue or skin substitute,\ngrowth factors and negative pressure wound therapy. No\ntherapy is completely perfect as each type suffers from its own disadvantages.\nMoist wound therapy is known to promote fibroblast and keratinocyte\nproliferation and migration, collagen synthesis, early angiogenesis and wound\ncontraction. At present, there are various categories of moist dressings\navailable such as adhesive backing film, silicone coated foam, hydrogels,\nhydrocolloids etc. Unfortunately, all moist dressings cause fluid retention;\nmost of them require secondary dressing and hence are not the best choice for\nexudative wounds. To address the physiological\ndeficiencies underlying diabetic ulcer, various tissue engineering technologies\nhave come up with cellular as well as acellular skin replacement products.\n","linknr":598,"url":"Diabetic_foot_ulcer","recorded":1362482113,"links":28,"instances":["cellular","skin","dermatology"],"pdf":["http://www.awma.com.au/journal/library/1401_01.pdf","http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/pdf/footcare_scope.pdf","http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/pdf/footcare_scope.pdf","http://tissuehealth.med.utoronto.ca/hyperbaricmedicine/aboutus/documents/May05_p51_Hyperbaric_Medici.pdf"],"categories":["Diabetes"],"headings":["Prevention","Risk factors","Pathophysiology","Treatment","Classification","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["ulcer","dermatology"],["epidermis","skin"],["differentiation","cellular"]],"members":["differentiation","epidermis","ulcer"],"related":["Complication_of_diabetes_mellitus","Diabetic_foot","Amputations","Wound_healing","Extracellular_matrix","Diabetes_mellitus","Granulation_tissue","Wound","Tensile_strength","Extracellular_matrix","Growth_factors","Negative_pressure_wound_therapy","Fibroblast","Keratinocyte","Angiogenesis","Adhesive","Silicone","Tissue_engineering","Chiropody","Diabetic_sock","Diabetic_shoe","Meta-analysis","Cochrane_Collaboration","National_Institute_for_Health_and_Clinical_Excellence","PDF","Randomized_controlled_trial","Number_needed_to_treat","Diabetic_neuropathy","Peripheral_vascular_disease","Ischemia","Peripheral_neuropathy","Blister","Ulcer_(dermatology)","Bacteria","Infection","Extra_cellular_matrix","Dermis","Epidermis_(skin)","Skin","Connective_tissue","Extracellular_matrix","Integrins","Cell_membrane","Wound_healing","Extracellular_matrix","Extracellular_matrix","Neutrophils","Macrophages","Fibroblasts","Collagen","Collagen_III","Tensile_strength","Glycosaminoglycan","Cytokine","Macrophages","Angiogenesis","Chondroitin_sulfate","Proteoglycan","Basement_membrane","Granulation_tissue","Growth_factors","Perlecan","Wound_healing","Angiogenesis","Perlecan","Post-transcriptional_modification","Extracellular_matrix","Diabetes_mellitus","Granulation_tissue","Aldose","Glycosylation","Advanced_glycation_endproducts","Extracellular_matrix","Vitronectin","Laminin","Type_I_collagen","Elastin","Type_III_collagen","Granulation_tissue","Type_IV_collagen","Heparan_sulfate","Proteoglycan","Nitric_oxide","Differentiation_(cellular)","Nitric_oxide","Fibroblast","Arginine","Nitric_oxide","Nitric_oxide_synthase","Angiogenesis","Wound_healing","Nitric_oxide","Arginine","Nitric_oxide_synthase","Nitric_oxide_synthase","Ketoacidosis","Nitric_oxide_synthase","Fibroblasts","Endoplasmic_reticulum","Transmission_electron_microscopy","Microtubules","Extracellular_matrix","Extracellular_matrix","Tensile_strength","Matrix_metalloproteinases","Extracellular_matrix","Fibroblast","Keratinocyte","Cytokines","Wound_healing","Transforming_growth_factor","Growth_factors","Cytokines","Granulation_tissue","Surgeon","Antibiotic","Staphylococcus","Streptococcus","Anaerobe","Debridement","Hydrogel","Silver","Alginate_dressing","Cochrane_Library","Hyperbaric_oxygen_therapy","Amputation","Vacuum","Negative_pressure_wound_therapy"]}
