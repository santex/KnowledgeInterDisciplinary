This Mercury flight\nwas designed to enter space, but not to achieve orbit. Ten years later, at age\n47 the oldest astronaut in the program, Shepard commanded the Apollo 14 mission,\npiloting the lander to the most accurate landing of the Apollo missions. He\nbecame the fifth person to walk on the Moon, and the only astronaut of the\nMercury Seven to walk on the Moon. During the mission he hit two golf balls on\nthe lunar surface.\n\nThese were his only two space flights, as his flight status was interrupted for\nfive years (1964â69) during the Mercury and Gemini programs by MÃ©niÃ¨re's\ndisease, an inner-ear disease that was surgically corrected before his Moon\nflight. Shepard served as Chief of the Astronaut Office from November 1963 â\nJuly 1969 (approximately the period of his grounding), and from June 1971 â\nAugust 1, 1974 (from his last flight, to his retirement). He was promoted from\nCaptain to Rear Admiral on August 25, 1971.
