{"cursor":"19790","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The '1994 [[NBA Playoffs]]' was the postseason tournament of the National\nBasketball Association's 1993-94 season. The tournament concluded with the\nWestern Conference champion Houston Rockets defeating the Eastern Conference\nchampion New York Knicks 4 games to 3 in the NBA Finals. Hakeem Olajuwon was\nnamed NBA Finals MVP.\n\nThe biggest upset came in the first round, when the Denver Nuggets came back\nfrom a 2-0 deficit to beat the Seattle SuperSonics in five games, marking the\nfirst time in NBA history that an eighth seed had defeated a top seed. Denver\nstretched their improbable playoff run with the Utah Jazz to seven games after\nbeing down 0-3 (the first team in playoff history to do so), but Utah defeated\nthem in Game 7 91-81.\n\nThe playoffs also featured the very first playoff series victory for the Indiana\nPacers in their 18-year NBA existence, as they swept the Orlando Magic (who were\nmaking their first playoff appearance in franchise history) in the first round,\nthen eliminated the top-seeded Atlanta Hawks 4-2 in the second round. The Pacers\nadvanced within one game of the NBA Finals, but lost Games 6 and 7 of the\nEastern Conference finals to the Knicks.\n\nThis was the first time since the ABA-NBA merger prior to the 1976-77 season\nthat all the former ABA teams (Pacers, Nuggets, Spurs, and Nets) made the\nplayoffs in the same year.\n\nFor the Chicago Bulls, this was the only playoff run they accomplished between\nthe first retirement of Michael Jordan and his return on March 17, 1995. After\nsweeping the Cleveland Cavaliers in the first round, they fell in seven games to\nthe Knicks in the Eastern Conference semifinals.\n\nFor the Knicks, they made history by playing a record 25 playoff games (one\nshort of the maximum), the most postseason games that an NBA team had ever\nplayed. The 2005 Detroit Pistons tied this record.\nHowever, it was broken by the 2008 Celtics. Their easiest\nseries was the first-round 3-1 win over the Nets. New York then forced three\nconsecutive Game 7's, eliminating the Bulls 4-3 in the Conference semifinals,\nknocking off the Pacers 4-3 in the Conference finals, both times at Madison\nSquare Garden, before falling in Game 7 to the Rockets at The Summit in the NBA\nfinals, which meant New York was denied both NBA and NHL titles. Game 4 of the\nFinals took place at the Garden a day after the New York Rangers won their first\nStanley Cup in 54 years in Game 7 of the 1994 Stanley Cup Finals. Knicks coach\nPat Riley made history by becoming the first (and to this date, the only) person\nin NBA history to have coached a Game 7 in the NBA Finals for two different\nteams, having been with the Lakers in and . However, he had the distinction to\nhave become the first (and as of 2013, only) coach to lose a Game 7 in the NBA\nFinals on two different teams, as his Lakers lost to the Celtics in 1984. It\nalso denied him the distinction of becoming the first coach to win a Game 7 in\nthe NBA Finals with two different teams, as his Lakers defeated the Detroit\nPistons in 1988.\n\nThis was the last playoff appearance for the Golden State Warriors until 2007.\n\nThis was also the first time that the Boston Celtics since 1979, and Los Angeles\nLakers since 1976, did not make the playoffs and their first-ever absence since\nthe playoff field expanded to 16 teams in 1984. This was the first (and so far,\nonly) time that both teams missed the playoffs in the same year.\n\nGame 3 of the Bulls-Cavaliers series was the last game ever played at the\nColiseum at Richfield.\n\nGame 6 of the Bulls-Knicks series was the last game ever played at\nChicago Stadium.\n\nGame 5 of the Nuggets-Sonics series was the last to be played at Seattle Center\nColiseum before the renovations and renaming into KeyArena two years later. The\nSonics played the intervening 1994â95 NBA season at Tacoma Dome in nearby\nTacoma, Washington.\n","linknr":386,"url":"1994_NBA_Playoffs","recorded":1375078701,"links":["/w/index.php?title=1994_NBA_Playoffs&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=1994_NBA_Playoffs&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/National_Basketball_Association","/wiki/1993%E2%80%9394_NBA_season","/wiki/Western_Conference_(NBA)","/wiki/Houston_Rockets","/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)","/wiki/New_York_Knicks","/wiki/1994_NBA_Finals","/wiki/Hakeem_Olajuwon","/wiki/Bill_Russell_NBA_Finals_Most_Valuable_Player_Award","/wiki/Denver_Nuggets","/wiki/Seattle_SuperSonics","/wiki/Utah_Jazz","/wiki/List_of_NBA_game_sevens","/wiki/Indiana_Pacers","/wiki/Orlando_Magic","/wiki/Atlanta_Hawks","/wiki/ABA-NBA_merger","/wiki/1976-77_NBA_season","/wiki/Chicago_Bulls","/wiki/Michael_Jordan","/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers","/wiki/2004-05_Detroit_Pistons_season","#cite_note-MostGames-1","/wiki/2007-08_Boston_Celtics_season","#cite_note-MostGames-1","/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden","/wiki/New_York_Rangers","/wiki/Curse_of_1940","/wiki/1994_Stanley_Cup_Finals","/wiki/Pat_Riley","/wiki/1984_NBA_Finals","/wiki/1988_NBA_Finals","/wiki/Detroit_Pistons","/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors","/wiki/2007_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/Boston_Celtics","/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers","/wiki/Coliseum_at_Richfield","/wiki/Chicago_Stadium","/wiki/KeyArena","/wiki/1994%E2%80%9395_NBA_season","/wiki/Tacoma_Dome","/wiki/Tacoma,_Washington","#Bracket","#Western_Conference","#Eastern_Conference","#NBA_Finals","#Notes","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=1994_NBA_Playoffs&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=1994_NBA_Playoffs&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Houston_Rockets","/wiki/Seattle_SuperSonics","/wiki/Denver_Nuggets","/wiki/KeyArena","/wiki/KeyArena","/wiki/McNichols_Sports_Arena","/wiki/McNichols_Sports_Arena","/wiki/KeyArena","/wiki/1988_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/Houston_Rockets","/wiki/Portland_Trail_Blazers","/wiki/Lakewood_Church_Central_Campus","/wiki/Lakewood_Church_Central_Campus","/wiki/Veterans_Memorial_Coliseum_(Portland)","/wiki/Veterans_Memorial_Coliseum_(Portland)","/wiki/1987_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/Phoenix_Suns","/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors","/wiki/US_Airways_Center","/wiki/US_Airways_Center","/wiki/Oracle_Arena","/wiki/1989_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/San_Antonio_Spurs","/wiki/Utah_Jazz","/wiki/Alamodome","/wiki/Alamodome","/wiki/EnergySolutions_Arena","/wiki/EnergySolutions_Arena","/wiki/Houston_Rockets","/wiki/Phoenix_Suns","/wiki/Lakewood_Church_Central_Campus","/wiki/Lakewood_Church_Central_Campus","/wiki/US_Airways_Center","/wiki/US_Airways_Center","/wiki/Kevin_Johnson","/wiki/Hakeem_Olajuwon","/wiki/Lakewood_Church_Central_Campus","/wiki/US_Airways_Center","/wiki/Lakewood_Church_Central_Campus","/wiki/Utah_Jazz","/wiki/Denver_Nuggets","/wiki/EnergySolutions_Arena","/wiki/EnergySolutions_Arena","/wiki/McNichols_Sports_Arena","/wiki/McNichols_Sports_Arena","/wiki/EnergySolutions_Arena","/wiki/McNichols_Sports_Arena","/wiki/EnergySolutions_Arena","/wiki/1985_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/Houston_Rockets","/wiki/Utah_Jazz","/wiki/Lakewood_Church_Central_Campus","/wiki/Lakewood_Church_Central_Campus","/wiki/EnergySolutions_Arena","/wiki/EnergySolutions_Arena","/wiki/Lakewood_Church_Central_Campus","/wiki/1985_NBA_Playoffs","/w/index.php?title=1994_NBA_Playoffs&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/New_York_Knicks","/wiki/Atlanta_Hawks","/wiki/Miami_Heat","/wiki/Omni_Coliseum","/wiki/Omni_Coliseum","/wiki/Miami_Arena","/wiki/Miami_Arena","/wiki/Omni_Coliseum","/wiki/New_York_Knicks","/wiki/Brooklyn_Nets","/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden","/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden","/wiki/Izod_Center","/wiki/Izod_Center","/wiki/1983_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/Chicago_Bulls","/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers","/wiki/Chicago_Stadium","/wiki/Chicago_Stadium","/wiki/Coliseum_at_Richfield","/wiki/1993_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/Orlando_Magic","/wiki/Indiana_Pacers","/wiki/Amway_Arena","/wiki/Byron_Scott_(basketball)","/wiki/Amway_Arena","/wiki/Market_Square_Arena","/wiki/Atlanta_Hawks","/wiki/Indiana_Pacers","/wiki/Omni_Coliseum","/wiki/Omni_Coliseum","/wiki/Market_Square_Arena","/wiki/Market_Square_Arena","/wiki/Omni_Coliseum","/wiki/Market_Square_Arena","/wiki/1987_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/New_York_Knicks","/wiki/Chicago_Bulls","/wiki
