The institute's official mission is\nto: [http://www.nist.gov/public_affairs/general_information.cfm NIST General\nInformation.] Retrieved on August 21, 2010.\n\n\n\nNIST had an operating budget for fiscal year 2007 (October 1, 2006-September 30,\n2007) of about $843.3 million. NIST's 2009 budget was $992 million,\nbut it also received $610 million as part of the American Recovery and\nReinvestment Act. NIST employs about 2,900 scientists, engineers,\ntechnicians, and support and administrative personnel. About 1,800 NIST\nassociates (guest researchers and engineers from American companies and foreign\nnations) complement the staff. In addition, NIST partners with 1,400\nmanufacturing specialists and staff at nearly 350 affiliated centers around the\ncountry. NIST publishes the 'Handbook 44' that provides the\n\"Specifications, tolerances, and other technical requirements for weighing and\nmeasuring devices\".\n","linknr":427,"url":"NIST","recorded":1362481757,"links":54,"instances":["icsd","nist","radio_station","caver"],"pdf":["http://ts.nist.gov/WeightsAndMeasures/upload/SP_447-2.pdf","http://ts.nist.gov/WeightsAndMeasures/upload/SP_447-2.pdf","http://ts.nist.gov/WeightsAndMeasures/upload/SP_447-2.pdf","http://ts.nist.gov/WeightsAndMeasures/Publications/upload/HB44-10-Complete.pdf"],"categories":["Standards
