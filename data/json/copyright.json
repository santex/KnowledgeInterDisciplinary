It is a form of intellectual property (like the patent, the\ntrademark, and the trade secret) applicable to any expressible form of an idea\nor information that is substantive and discrete.<ref name=\"World Intellectual\nProperty Organisation 6â€“7\"></ref>\n\nCopyright initially was conceived as a way for government to restrict printing;\nthe contemporary intent of copyright is to promote the creation of new works by\ngiving authors control of and profit from them. Copyrights are said to be\nterritorial, which means that they do not extend beyond the territory of a\nspecific state unless that state is a party to an international agreement.\nToday, however, this is less relevant since most countries are parties to at\nleast one such agreement. While many aspects of national copyright laws have\nbeen standardized through international copyright agreements, copyright laws of\nmost countries have some unique features.<ref name=\"International Copyright Law\nSurvey\"></ref> Typically, the duration of copyright is the whole life of the\ncreator plus fifty to a hundred years from the creator's death, or a finite\nperiod for anonymous or corporate creations. Some jurisdictions have required\nformalities to establishing copyright, but most recognize copyright in any\ncompleted work, without formal registration. Generally, copyright is enforced as\na civil matter, though some jurisdictions do apply criminal sanctions.\n\nMost jurisdictions recognize copyright limitations, allowing \"fair\" exceptions\nto the creator's exclusivity of copyright, and giving users certain rights. The\ndevelopment of digital media and computer network technologies have prompted\nreinterpretation of these exceptions, introduced new difficulties in enforcing\ncopyright, and inspired additional challenges to copyright law's philosophic\nbasis. Simultaneously, businesses with great economic dependence upon copyright\nhave advocated the extension and expansion of their intellectual property\nrights, and sought additional legal and technological enforcement.\n","title":"copyright","headings":["Justification","History","Scope","Obtaining and enforcing copyright","Exclusive rights","Limitations and exceptions to copyright","Transfer and licensing, and assignment","Duration","Copyright infringement","See also","References","Further reading","External links"]},"micro-relation":["7: Berne_Convention_for_the_Protection_of_Literary_and_Artistic_Works","4: Trademark","3: Patent","3: Universal_Copyright_Convention","3: World_Trade_Organization","3: World_Intellectual_Property_Organization_Copyright_Treaty","3: United_Kingdom","2: Anti-copyright","2: Statute_of_Anne","2: United_States_Constitution","2: Agreement_on_Trade-Related_Aspects_of_Intellectual_Property_Rights","2: Derivative_work","2: Fair_use","2: English_law","2: United_States","2: Court","2: Internet","2: Creative_Commons","1: Exclusive_right","1: Related_rights","1: Intellectual_property","1: Trade_secret","1: International_copyright_agreements","1: Copyright_formalities","1: Criminal_law","1: Harvard_University_Press","1: Printing_press","1: Charles&nbsp;II_of_England","1: Copying","1: Licensing_of_the_Press_Act_1662","1: Worshipful_Company_of_Stationers_and_Newspaper_Makers","1: Middle_Ages","1: Capitalism","1: Sound_recording_and_reproduction","1: Connecticut","1: Noah_Webster","1: John_Trumbull","1: Joel_Barlow","1: Copyright_Clause","1: Public_domain","1: Thomas_Jefferson","1: Sovereignty","1: Creative_works","1: Latin_America","1: Buenos_Aires_Convention","1: Soviet_Union","1: Jurisdiction","1: Poem","1: Theses","1: Drama","1: Book","1: Film","1: Choreography","1: Music","1: Sound_recording","1: Painting","1: Drawing","1: Sculpture","1: Photography","1: Computer_software","1: Radio","1: Television","1: Broadcasting","1: Industrial_design","1: Designs","1: Mickey_Mouse","1: The_Walt_Disney_Company","1: Anthropomorphic","1: Fair_dealing","1: International_organizations","1: European_Union","1: Australia","1: Statutory_damages_for_copyright_infringement","1: Work_for_hire","1: Copyright_registry","1: Legal_proof","1: RIAA","1: File_sharing","1: Legal_aspects_of_file_sharing","1: Copyright_symbol","1: Sound_recording_copyright_symbol","1: 17_U.S.C.","1: Postmark","1: Unregistered_design_right","1: European_law","1: Philosophy_of_copyright","1: Property_right","1: Baker_v._Selden","1: Copyright_Act_of_1976","1: Compact_disc","1: First-sale_doctrine","1: Bookstore","1: Parallel_importation","1: Exhaustion_of_rights","1: United_States_Copyright_Act_of_1976","1: Commonwealth_of_Nations","1: Legislation","1: Canada","1: Legal_advice","1: Law_of_Australia","1: Audio_Home_Recording_Act","1: Digital_Millennium_Copyright_Act","1: Record_industry","1: Copyright_Act_1968","1: Law_of_the_United_States","1: Real_estate","1: License","1: Statutory_license","1: Compulsory_license","1: Copyright_collective","1: Collecting_societies","1: Performance_rights_organisation","1: ASCAP","1: Broadcast_Music_Incorporated","1: SESAC","1: Little_Nemo","1: Publication","1: Copyright_Term_Extension_Act","1: Intellectual_property_rights","1: Common_law_copyright","1: Copyright_infringement#Colloquial_terminology","1: Adelphi_Charter","1: Conflict_of_laws","1: Copyright_in_architecture_in_the_United_States","1: Copyright_on_the_content_of_patents_and_in_the_context_of_patent_prosecution","1: Copyright_for_Creativity","1: Copyright_infringement_of_software","1: Copyright_on_religious_works","1: Creative_Barcode","1: Digital_rights_management","1: Digital_watermarking","1: Entertainment_law","1: Freedom_of_panorama","1: Intellectual_property_education","1: Intellectual_property_protection_of_typefaces","1: List_of_Copyright_Acts","1: List_of_copyright_case_law","1: List_of_parties_to_international_copyright_agreements","1: Model_release","1: Paracopyright","1: Photography_and_the_law","1: Pirate_Party","1: Private_copying_levy","1: Production_music","1: Rent-seeking","1: Reproduction_fees","1: Software_copyright","1: Threshold_pledge_system","1: Rome_Convention_for_the_Protection_of_Performers,_Producers_of_Phonograms_and_Broadcasting_Organisations","1: WIPO_Performances_and_Phonograms_Treaty","1: Alternative_compensation_system","1: Copyleft","1: Copynorms","1: Copyright_aspects_of_downloading_and_streaming","1: Copyright_aspects_of_hyperlinking_and_framing","1: Creative_Commons_jurisdiction_ports","1: Creative_Commons_license","1: Crypto-anarchism","1: Database_right","1: Digital_rights","1: Lawrence_Lessig","1: Permission_culture","1: Shuman_Ghosemajumder","1: MIT_Sloan_School_of_Management","1: Bruce_Lehman","1: Washington_State_University","1: Harvard_Business_School","1: WIPO"]}
