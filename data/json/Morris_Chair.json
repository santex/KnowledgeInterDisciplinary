{"cursor":"6473","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nA 'Morris chair' is an early type of reclining chair. The design was adapted by\nWilliam Morris's firm, Morris & Company from a prototype owned by Ephraim Colman\nin rural Sussex, England. It was first marketed around\n1866. [http://www.victorianweb.org/art/design/furniture/27.html Early\nupholstered version]\n\nChairs that are called \"Morris chairs\" feature a seat with a reclining back and\nmoderately high armrests, which give the chair an old-style appearance. The\ncharacteristic feature of a Morris chair is a hinged back, set between two un-\nupholstered arms, with the reclining angle adjusted through a row of pegs, holes\nor notches in each arm. In other instances, the reclining of the back is\ncontrolled by a metal bar set in hooked back racks. The original Morris chair\nhad dark stained woodwork, turned spindles and heavily decorated upholstery, in\ntypical Victorian style.\n\nThe chair was widely copied after Morris' introduction, and is still\nmanufactured. The appearance and style of upholstery is usually quite different\nto Morris', but the overall layout is constant. There are two rather distinct\ntypes of these chairs. One type, called the \"traditional\" Morris chair evolved\nin America evolving directly from the Morris original. It often features carving\nand serpentine shapes. These chairs were produced in the hundreds of thousands\nfrom about 1890 to 1930 in versions ranging from affordable to very high-end. At\nthe low price end, these chairs were sold by The Larkin Soap Company and other\nlarge firms such as Sears Roebuck and Montgomery Ward. The more expensive chairs\nwere those made by Horner and other exclusive furniture makers.\n\nThe other style of Morris chair is called the \"Mission\" or the \"Craftsman\"\nMorris chair. The best known examples are those were first produced by Gustav\nStickley {{cite web\n|url=http://www.treadwaygallery.com/ONLINECATALOGS/DEC2004/acWEB/0025.jpg\n|title=Original Gustav Stickley #369 chair, missing the rear cushion and showing\nthe back frame. |publisher=[http://www.treadwaygallery.com/ Treadway Gallery]\n}} in 1904 and then widely copied afterwards. These are in the American\nCraftsman idiom, rather than English Arts & Crafts styles. Woodwork is lightly\nfinished and largely undecorated oak in rectangular sections. Upholstery\ncomprises unframed cushions in brown leather, or green or brown fabric. The\nCraftsman or Mission style of Morris chair is often thought of as a Stickley\ndesign named in homage to Morris, rather than an original Morris piece. As with\nall Stickley, these chairs are keenly collected today and originals fetch\nseveral thousands of dollars.\n\n\n\nGiven the seemingly staid nature of the Morris chair itself, it may seem odd\nthat there is recurrent mention of the Morris chair in popular song lyrics\nindicating its romantic and erotic use:\n\nThe chair is mentioned prominently in the Marilyn Monroe cover of the Irving\nBerlin song \"You'd Be Surprised\" as follows:\n\n::\"At a party\n::Or at a ball :I've got to admit :He's nothing at all :But in a Morris chair\n::You'd be surprised.\"\n\nAdditionally, the Morris chair is mentioned in another Irving Berlin song, \"All\nBy Myself\", published in 1921, as well as in the song \"My Honey's Lovin' Arms\"\n(1922), by Joseph Meyer:\n\n::\"A cozy Morris chair\n::Oh what a happy pair\",\nor, as Barbra Streisand sang in her recording of the song:\n::\"A cozy Morris chair\n::What kind of chair is a Morris chair?\".\n\nIt is mentioned also in the World War I patriotic song: \"If he can fight like he\ncan love, good night Germany\" (words by Grant Clarke and Howard E. Rogers, Music\nby George W. Meyer)\n\n::\"..I know he'll be a Hero over there, 'Cause he's a bear in any Morris\n::chair...\"\n\nThe Morris chair appears in the song, \"Oh, Sister! Ainât That Hot!\" verse 2:\n\n::\"Now some folks like a Morris chair \"Some prefer a baby grand. \"But things\n::like that cannot compare \"With that lovinâ hot lip band.\"\n\nOn February 6, 1932 Jimmie Rodgers recorded \"Home Call\" in Dallas, Texas\n\n::\"A big Morris chair waits for me there \"In front of a bright log fire \"My babe\n::at my knee and my wife sings with me \"While I strum on my old guitar \"In fact\n::we're as happy, as happy can be \"In the evening just Carrie, Anita and me\n\nThe Morris chair appears in a song that anticipated the era of alcohol\nprohibition (1920-1933), \"You Donât Need the Wine To Have a Wonderful Time\n(While They Still Make Those Wonderful Girls) (Music by Harry Akst, lyric by\nHoward E. Rogers), published in 1919 and introduced by Eddie Cantor, in live\nperformance, in the Ziegfeld Follies of 1919 (recorded in \"Ziegfeld follies of\n1919,\" 33 RPM vinyl disk, [Washington, D.C.] : Smithsonian Collection,\npublished, 1977):\n\n::\"Why should we care if the wine isnât there? \"We still have the sofa and the\n::old Morris chair.\"\n\nIt is also mentioned in the Three Stooges short film, [[Rockin' thru the\nRockies]] (release date March 8, 1940), when Curly claims, \"I once shot a Morris\nchair from underneath Sitting Bull.\"\n\nA Morris Chair is mentioned in Kurt Vonnegut's short story Lover's Anonymous\npublished in his collection of short stories, Bagombo Snuff Box. Vonnegut,\nK. 2000. Bagombo Snuff Box. New York: Berkley Books. \n\nBullwinkle J. Moose explains \"... you sit happily in your Morris Chair ...\" in\nthe \"Mister Know-it All\" segment of Rocky an Bullwinkle , Season 2 , episode 3 .\n\nThe chair is a popular subject with amateur furniture makers, particularly in\nthe USA. {{cite book |author=Bavaro & Mossman\n|title=The Furniture of Gustav Stickley |isbn=0-941936-35-X |publisher=Linden\nPublishing |year=1997 }} {{cite
