In the narrative, when Daniel was a\nyoung man, he was taken into Babylonian captivity where he was educated in\nChaldean thought. However, he never converted to Neo-Babylonian ways. Through\ndivine wisdom from his God, Yahweh, he interpreted dreams and visions of kings,\nthus becoming a prominent figure in the court of Babylon. Eventually, he had\napocalyptic visions of his own that have been interpreted as the [[Four\nmonarchies]]. Some of the most famous accounts of Daniel are: Shadrach, Meshach,\nand Abednego, The writing on the wall and Daniel in the lions' den.\n","title":"daniel","headings":["Hebrew Bible","Pseudepigrapha","Views of Daniel","Six tombs of Daniel","See also","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["6: Babylon","4: Iran","4: Shadrach,_Meshach,_and_Abednego","4: Hananiah,_Mishael,_and_Azariah","3: Susa","3: Ezekiel","3: Samarkand","3: Muslim","2: Neo-Babylon","2: Nebuchadnezzar_II","2: Arioch","2: Belshazzar","2: Darius_the_Mede","2: Isaiah","2: Jeremiah","2: Prophet","1: Christianity","1: Mormonism","1: Islam","1: Briton_Rivière","1: Protagonist","1: Hebrew_Bible","1: Babylonian_captivity","1: Chaldea","1: Apocalypse","1: The_writing_on_the_wall","1: Daniel_in_the_lions'_den","1: Jehoiakim","1: Doxology","1: Handwriting_on_the_wall","1: Apocalyptic_literature","1: Babylonian_Empire","1: Median_Empire","1: Persian_Empire","1: Greeks","1: Alexander_the_Great","1: Antiochus_IV","1: Tanakh","1: Daniel's_Tomb","1: Tamerlane","1: Book_of_Ezekiel","1: Ugaritic","1: Anat","1: Deuterocanonical","1: Bel_and_the_Dragon","1: Habakkuk","1: Hezekiah","1: Talmud","1: Pirke_de_Rabbi_Eliezer","1: Eunuchs","1: Coptic_Church","1: Baramhat","1: Eastern_Orthodox_Church","1: Eastern_Orthodox_liturgical_calendar","1: Nativity_Fast","1: Logos","1: Virgin_birth_of_Jesus","1: Theotokos","1: Lutheran_Church_-_Missouri_Synod","1: Roman_Catholic_Church","1: Roman_Martyrology","1: Archdiocese_of_Gorizia","1: Arabic","1: Prophets_of_Islam","1: Major_prophet","1: Old_Testament","1: Qur'an","1: Ibn_Kathir","1: Alexandria","1: Mosque","1: Exegesis","1: Tabari","1: Nebuchadnezzar","1: Jerusalem","1: Apocryphal","1: Hebrew","1: Habbakuk","1: Islamic_Golden_Age","1: Modern_history","1: Abdullah_Yusuf_Ali","1: Manifestation_of_God#Minor_prophets","1: Baha'i_Faith","1: Reincarnation","1: Kirkuk","1: Muqdadiyah","1: Iraq","1: Malamir,_Iran","1: Uzbekistan","1: Apocalypse_of_Daniel","1: Book_of_Daniel","1: Cyrus_the_Great","1: Achaemenid_Empire","1: Theophory_in_the_Bible","1: Persian_Jews"]}
