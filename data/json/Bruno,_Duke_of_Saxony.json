He was the eldest son of the Saxon count Liudolf and his\nwife, Oda of Billung. Bruno is rated as the progenitor of the Brunonen noble\nfamily, a branch of the Ottonian dynasty. However some mentions appear to refer\nto an earlier Saxon margrave Brun the Younger, possibly a grandfather, but this\nis unclear.\n\nWhile his father is described as [[dux]] orientalis Saxonum, i.e. leader in East\nSaxony (Eastphalia), it is possible that Bruno, according to the [[Res gestae\nsaxonicae sive annalium libri tres|Res gestae saxonicae]] by chronicler Widukind\nof Corvey, was dux totius Saxonum, duke of all Saxony. The rise of his family is\ndocumented by the fact that Bruno's sister Liutgard in 874 married Louis the\nYounger, son of King Louis the German, whereafter he is called ducem et fratrem\nreinÃ¦, \"duke and the queen's brother\".\n\nHe died, along with several other Saxon noblemen, in a battle against Viking\nwarriors (probably Danes of the Great Heathen Army defeated by King Alfred the\nGreat) on 2 February 880. AF, 880 (p. 88 and n4). The battle at\nEbstorf near LÃ¼neburg was a crushing defeat and Duke Bruno, the bishops of\nMinden and Hildesheim, as well as twelve Saxon counts were killed. According to\nthe chronicler Bishop Thietmar of Merseburg, Bruno died in a flooded river,\nwhich probably took place during the battle or a retreat. Bruno, son of\nLiudolf, died in one of two battles (one at the river Scheldt and one in Saxony)\nwhich are reported separately in the [[Annales Fuldenses]]. The [[Gesta\nFrancorum]] lists \"Bardonumâ¦alterum Bardonum [et] tertium Bardonum\" as three of\nthe twelve counts who were killed fighting the Danes in 880[120]. The other two\ncounts named \"Bardo\" or \"Bruno\" have not been identified. He was succeeded\nby his younger brother Otto the Illustrious.\n\nBruno is venerated as a saint and martyr in the Catholic Church, being honored\nwith a feast day on February 2 under the name 'St. Bruno of Saxony'. According\nto legend, he is the founder of Brunswick and ancestor of Count Brun I in the\nDerlingau, though an affiliation is uncertain.\n","linknr":140,"url":"Bruno,_Duke_of_Saxony","recorded":1374525457,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Bruno,_Duke_of_Saxony&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Bruno,_Duke_of_Saxony&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Bruno_the_Great","/wiki/File:Bruno_dux.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bb/Bruno_dux.jpg","/wiki/Chronica_sancti_Pantaleonis","/wiki/Duke_of_Saxony","/wiki/Catholic_Church","/wiki/Calendar_of_saints","/wiki/Duke_of_Saxony","/wiki/Nobility","/wiki/Liudolfing","/wiki/Liudolf,_Duke_of_Saxony","/wiki/List_of_rulers_of_Saxony","/wiki/Duchy_of_Saxony","/wiki/Liudolf,_Duke_of_Saxony","/wiki/Billung","/wiki/Brunonen","/wiki/Ottonian_dynasty","/wiki/Margrave","/wiki/Dux","/wiki/Eastphalia","/wiki/Res_gestae_saxonicae_sive_annalium_libri_tres","/wiki/Widukind_of_Corvey","/wiki/Liutgard_of_Saxony","/wiki/Louis_the_Younger","/wiki/Louis_the_German","/wiki/Viking","/wiki/Danes_(Germanic_tribe)","/wiki/Great_Heathen_Army","/wiki/Alfred_the_Great","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Ebstorf","/wiki/L%C3%BCneburg","/wiki/Bishopric_of_Minden","/wiki/Bishopric_of_Hildesheim","/wiki/Thietmar_of_Merseburg","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Otto_I,_Duke_of_Saxony","/wiki/Saint","/wiki/Catholic_Church","/wiki/Braunschweig","/wiki/Brun_I,_Count_of_Brunswick","/wiki/Derlingau","/w/index.php?title=Bruno,_Duke_of_Saxony&action=edit&section=1","http://www.medievalsources.co.uk/fulda.htm","/w/index.php?title=Bruno,_Duke_of_Saxony&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-1","#cite_ref-2","/wiki/Scheldt","/wiki/Annales_Fuldenses","/wiki/Gesta_Francorum","/wiki/Ottonian","/wiki/Liudolf,_Duke_of_Saxony","/wiki/List_of_rulers_of_Saxony","/wiki/Otto_the_Illustrious","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bruno,_Duke_of_Saxony&oldid=562415579","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Dukes_of_Saxony","/wiki/Category:Brunonen_Dynasty","/wiki/Category:880_deaths","/wiki/Category:9th-century_rulers_in_Europe","/wiki/Category:German_Roman_Catholic_saints","/wiki/Category:Use_dmy_dates_from_January_2012","/wiki/Category:Date_of_birth_unknown","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Bruno%2C+Duke+of+Saxony&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Bruno%2C+Duke+of+Saxony","/wiki/Bruno,_Duke_of_Saxony","/wiki/Talk:Bruno,_Duke_of_Saxony","#","/wiki/Bruno,_Duke_of_Saxony","/w/index.php?title=Bruno,_Duke_of_Saxony&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Bruno,_Duke_of_Saxony&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Bruno,_Duke_of_Saxony","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Bruno,_Duke_of_Saxony","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Bruno,_Duke_of_Saxony&oldid=562415579","/w/index.php?title=Bruno,_Duke_of_Saxony&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q590568","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Bruno%2C_Duke_of_Saxony&id=562415579","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Bruno%2C+Duke+of+Saxony","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Bruno%2C+Duke+of+Saxony&oldid=562415579&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Bruno,_Duke_of_Saxony&printable=yes","//bg.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%91%D1%80%D1%83%D0%BD%D0%BE_(%D0%A1%D0%B0%D0%BA%D1%81%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%8F)","//de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brun_(Sachsen)","//el.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%9C%CF%80%CF%81%CE%BF%CF%8D%CE%BD%CE%BF,_%CE%94%CE%BF%CF%8D%CE%BA%CE%B1%CF%82_%CF%84%CE%B7%CF%82_%CE%A3%CE%B1%CE%BE%CF%89%CE%BD%CE%AF%CE%B1%CF%82","//fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruno_de_Saxe","//fy.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruno_fan_Saksen","//nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brun_van_Saksen","//ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3
