It has many systems and traditions and beliefs. Numerology and\nnumerological divination by systems such as isopsephy were popular among early\nmathematicians, such as Pythagoras, but are no longer considered part of\nmathematics and are regarded as pseudomathematics or pseudoscience by modern\nscientists.<ref name=\"Webb\"></ref><ref></ref><ref name=skepdic/>\n\nToday, numerology is often associated with the paranormal, alongside astrology\nand similar divinatory arts.<ref></ref>\n\nDespite the long history of numerological ideas, the word \"numerology\" is not\nrecorded in English before c.1907.<ref>\"numerology, n.\". OED Online. September\n2012. Oxford University Press.\nhttp://oed.com/view/Entry/129129?redirectedFrom=numerology& (accessed November\n23, 2012).</ref>\n\nThe term 'numerologist' is also used derogatorily for those perceived to place\nexcess faith in numerical patterns (and draw scientifically unsound inferences\nfrom them), even if those people do not practice traditional numerology. For\nexample, in his 1997 book Numerology: Or What Pythagoras Wrought, mathematician\nUnderwood Dudley uses the term to discuss practitioners of the Elliott wave\nprinciple of stock market analysis.\n\nSome remarks on the purported or commonly perceived numerological\nsignificance of specific numbers may be found at their respective articles,\nas at 77 (number).\n",
