Dating to the first quarter of the 1st century AD, it originally\nstood in a temple in the Gallo-Roman civitas of Lutetia (modern Paris,\nFrance) and is one of the earliest pieces of representational Gaulish art to\ncarry a written inscription (Hatt, 1952). It is displayed in the frigidarium\nof the Thermes de Cluny.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Pillar_of_the_Boatmen","recorded":1372152294,"links":[],"instances":["mythology","mythology","god","gaul","god","god","luck"],"pdf":[],"categories":["1st-century works","Roman Paris","Gallo-Roman religion","Gallo-Roman art","Gaulish inscriptions"],"headings":["Inscription","Description","Original location","History of the Pillar","See also","Notes","References","Bibliography","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["parisii","gaul"],["jupiter","god"],["vulcan","god"],["fortuna","luck"],["vulcan","mythology"],["mars","mythology#provincial_epithets"],["mercury","mythology"],["jupiter","god"],["vulcan","god"],["mars","god"],["mercury","mythology"],["fortuna","luck"],["juno","mythology"]],"members":["mercury","juno","mars","parisii","vulcan","jupiter","fortuna"],"related":["Lutetia","Paris","France","Frigidarium","Thermes_de_Cluny","Latin","Gaulish_language","List_of_Roman_deities","Tiberius","Roman_emperor","Parisii_(Gaul)","Seine","Jupiter_(god)","Dative","Nominative","Tarvos_Trigaranos","Vulcan_(god)","Esus","Cernunnos","Castor_and_Pollux","Smertrios","Fortuna_(luck)","Vulcan_(mythology)","Interpretatio_romana","Mercury_(mythology)","Cernunnos","Smertrios","Castor_and_Pollux","Jupiter_(god)","Esus","Tarvos_Trigaranos","Vulcan_(god)","Tiberius","Mars_(god)","Mercury_(mythology)","Rosmerta","Fortuna_(luck)","Juno_(mythology)","Lutetia","Île_de_la_Cité","Seine","Julius_Caesar","Christian","Cathedral","Childebert_I","Notre-Dame_de_Paris","Notre-Dame_de_Paris","Gallo-Roman_culture"]}
