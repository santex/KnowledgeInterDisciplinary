{"cursor":"13855","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n, Sri Lanka.]]\n\n\nThe 'taqiyah' (also spelt \"tagiyah\"; / ALA-LC: á¹­ÄqÄ«yah) is a short, rounded cap.\nSome people do wear them for religious purposes but over the years Topi evolved\ninto various variants and now many people including some women wear Topi for\ntraditional purpose only especially in Pakistan. In Punjab topi is common with\nPagri without any religious significance. When worn by itself, the taqiyah can\nbe any color. When worn under the keffiyah scarf, it is always white. Some\nMuslims wrap the turban around the cap. The turban is called an imama in Arabic.\nIn the United States and Britain, many Muslim merchants sell the prayer cap\nunder the name [[kufi]].\n\nMuslims wear the taqiyah to emulate Muhammad. The companions of Muhammad were\nnever seen without their heads being covered. In order to emulate their\nactions, some Muslims throughout the world wear a variety of taqiyat, fez hats,\nand other headgear.\n\nThe taqiyah is also called a 'prayer cap' in English. Some Muslims wear the\ntaqiyah during Jumu'ah (Friday) prayers at the mosque, and during daily salat\n(prayers) at home. For men, it is [[mustahabb]], which means '' or 'seeking the\nlove of God', to cover the head during prayer. Some Muslims use a prayer mat\nduring praying. Muslim men might wear a taqiyah during weddings (see Nikah).\n","linknr":857,"url":"Taqiyah_(cap)","recorded":1362566609,"links":33,"instances":["hat","clothing","hat","band","hat","clothing","clothing"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Caps","Arabic clothing","Pakistani headgear","Afghan clothing","Middle Eastern clothing","Islamic dress (male)"],"headings":["Etymology","The Muslim world","Western converts","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e4/Taqiyah.jpg/225px-Taqiyah.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4d/TajMahalbyAmalMongia.jpg/210px-TajMahalbyAmalMongia.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/IslamSymbolAllahCompWhite.PNG/50px-IslamSymbolAllahCompWhite.PNG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/74/HuiChineseMuslim3.jpg/220px-HuiChineseMuslim3.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Indian_Muslim.jpg/220px-Indian_Muslim.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/25/Young_Tajikistani_man_with_guitar.jpg/220px-Young_Tajikistani_man_with_guitar.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/55/Belhassen2.jpg/220px-Belhassen2.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["karakul","hat"],["karakul","hat"],["fez","hat"],["suit","clothing"],["karakul","hat"],["suit","clothing"],["suit","clothing"],["rush","band"],["suit","clothing"],["kofia","hat"],["boubou","clothing"],["wrapper","clothing"],["wrapper","clothing"],["suit","clothing"],["fez","hat"]],"members":["karakul","boubou","kofia","rush","fez","wrapper","suit"],"related":["Sri_Lanka","ALA-LC","Cap","Punjab","Pagri","Keffiyah","Turban","Arabic","United_States","United_Kingdom","Fez_hat","Jumu'ah","Mosque","Salat","Prayer_mat","Weddings","Nikah","Arabic","Saudi_Arabia","Pakistan","India","Urdu","Pakistan","Salwar_kameez","United_States","United_Kingdom","Pakol","Pashtun_people","Salwar_kameez","Afghanistan","Rebab","Karakul_(hat)","Burqa","China","Changshan","Islam_in_China","Formal_wear","Silk","Arab","Cotton","Jumu'ah","Hui_people","Muslim_Chinese_martial_arts","Tangzhuang","National_costume","Peci","National_dress","United_States","Skullcap","Javanese_people","Sarong","Songkok","Baju_melayu","Sarong","Dewan_Undangan_Negeri","Pakistan","Topi_cap","Salwar_kameez","Sherwani","Formal_wear","Sindhi_people","Sindhi_cap","Karakul_(hat)","Fez_(hat)","Pakol","Salwar_kameez","Kaftan","Gharara","Sari","Tubeteika","Russia","Tubeteika","Suit_(clothing)","Eid_ul_Fitr","Jumu'ah","Tuxedo","Wedding","Doppa","Kosovorotka","Sarafan","Turkic_peoples","Karakul_(hat)","Ushanka","Papakhi","Islam_in_Russia","Nikita_Khrushchev","Sarong","Turban","Sudanese","Islam_in_Sudan","Culture_of_Sudan","Fez_hat","Calpack","Beanie","Tuque","Wool","Pom-pom","Turkish_people","Dress","Jelick","Yashmak","Wedding_dress","Festival","Suit_(clothing)","Tuxedo","Dervish","Emiratee","Doppa","Oriental_rug","Uzbek_people","Central_Asia","Suit_(clothing)","Uzbeks","Tubeteika","Velvet","Festivals","Khalat","Chapan","Tājik_people","Tubeteika","Neil_Peart","Rush_(band)","Bosniaks","Black_beret","Fez_hat","Islam_in_Bosnia_and_Herzegovina","Eid_ul_Fitr","Suit_(clothing)","Wedding","Tuxedo","Fez_hat","Morocco","Djellaba","Fez_hat","Egypt","Galabeya","Kofia_(hat)","Kenya","Tanzania","Uganda","Swahili_language","Kanzu","United_States","Suit_jacket","Blazer","Formal_wear","Swahili_people","Kufi","Boubou_(clothing)","Senegalese_kaftan","Dashiki","Wrapper_(clothing)","Wrapper_(clothing)","Modesty","Hijab","Scottish_American","Kilt","Wedding","Balmoral_bonnet","English_American","Morning_dress","Top_hat","Trousers","Oxford_shirt","Suit_(clothing)","Friday_prayers","Irish_American","Aran_sweater","Grandfather_shirt","Friday_prayer","French_American","Breton_people","Beret","Friday_prayer","Hispanic_and_Latino_Americans","Guayabera","Khaki","Dress_shoes","German_American","Lederhosen","Friday_prayer","Awrah","Thawb","Salwar_kameez","Friday_prayer","Eid_ul_Fitr","Thawb","Salwar_kameez","Wedding_dress","Veil","White_wedding","Hijab","Cape","Cloak","Topi_cap","Dhaka_topi","Fez_(hat)","Islam_and_clothing","Keffiyah","Kippah","Jewish","List_of_hats","Kufi","Pakol"]}
