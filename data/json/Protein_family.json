The term protein family should not be\nconfused with [[Family (biology)|family]] as it is used in taxonomy.\n\nProteins in a family descend from a common ancestor (see homology) and typically\nhave similar three-dimensional structures, functions, and significant sequence\nsimilarity. While it is difficult to evaluate the significance of functional or\nstructural similarity, there is a fairly well developed framework for evaluating\nthe significance of similarity between a group of sequences using sequence\nalignment methods. Proteins that do not share a common ancestor are very\nunlikely to show statistically significant sequence similarity, making sequence\nalignment a powerful tool for identifying the members of protein families.\n\nCurrently, over 60,000 protein families have been defined, although\nambiguity in the definition of protein family leads different researchers to\nwildly varying numbers.\n","linknr":183,"url":"Protein_family","recorded":1362559286,"links":22,"instances":["biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Bioinformatics","Proteins","Protein classification","Protein families"],"headings":["Terminology and usage","Protein domains and motifs","Evolution of protein families","Use and importance of protein families","Protein family resources","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/Structural_coverage_of_the_human_cyclophilin_family.png/220px-Structural_coverage_of_the_human_cyclophilin_family.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["homology","biology"]],"members":["homology"],"related":["Isomerase","Protein_domain","Evolution","Protein","Gene_family","Homology_(biology)","Protein_structure","Sequence_alignment","Myoglobin","Hemoglobin","Cytochrome_c","Shuffling","Active_site","Hydrophobicity","Multiple_sequence_alignment","Mutations","Ortholog","Paralog","Eukaryotes","Genome_duplication","Genome_evolution","Phylogenetic","Enzyme_Function_Initiative","Biological_databases","Pfam","PROSITE","InterPro","SUPERFAMILY","Structural_Classification_of_Proteins","CATH","Protein_structure","Protein_domains","Protein_subfamily","Sequence_alignment","Sequence_clustering","Genome_annotation"]}
