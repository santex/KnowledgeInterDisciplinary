'Bar shot' is similar,\nbut joined by a solid bar. They were used in naval warfare in the age of sailing\nships and black powder cannons to shoot masts, or to cut the shrouds and any\nother rigging of a target ship.\n\nChain shot was used by the defenders of Magdeburg in May 1631 as an anti-\npersonnel load, which according to counselor Otto von Guericke was one reason\nfor the extreme violence of the victorious attackers. Otto von Guericke:\nGeschichte der Belagerung, Eroberung und Zerstoerung von Magdeburg, 2. Auflage\n1882, S. 16ff.\n\nWhen fired, after leaving the muzzle, the shot's components tumble in the air,\nand the connecting chain fully extends. In past use, as much as six feet of\nchain would sweep through the target. However, the tumbling made both bar and\nchain shot less accurate, so they were used at shorter ranges.\n\nChain shot was normally not used as an anti-personnel load; this role was\nfulfilled more effectively and at lower cost by canister shot or grapeshot.\n\nThe military usefulness of chain shot died out as wooden sail-powered ships\nwere replaced with armored steam ships — first among navies, and then\namong commercial fleets — which do not have sails and riggings to serve\nas proper targets for chain-shot. Additionally, the conversion of naval\narmament from smoothbore, muzzle loaded, black powder cannons to rifled, breech\nloaded guns further slowed the production of new chain shot ammunition; the\nchain would damage barrels (degrading maximum range, and further degrading\neffective range by degrading accuracy), and the new breech loading guns and\ntheir ammunition were meant to be effective against armored vessels as well as\nwooden sailing vessels.\n\nIn modern times, the effect is replicated in shotguns with the use of Bolo\nshells — a pair of slugs connected by a strong\nwire.
