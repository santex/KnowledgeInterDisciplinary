These rules determine what evidence must\nor must not be considered by the trier of fact in reaching its decision and,\nsometimes, the weight that may be given to that evidence. The law of evidence is\nalso concerned with the quantum (amount), quality, and type of proof needed to\nprevail in litigation.\n\nThe quantum of evidence is the amount of evidence needed; the quality of proof\nis how reliable such evidence should be considered. This includes such concepts\nas hearsay, authentication, admissibility, reasonable doubt, and clear and\nconvincing evidence.\n\nThere are several types of evidence, depending on the form or source. Evidence\ngoverns the use of testimony (e.g., oral or written statements, such as an\naffidavit), exhibits (e.g., physical objects), documentary material, or\ndemonstrative evidence, which are admissible (i.e., allowed to be considered by\nthe trier of fact, such as jury) in a judicial or administrative proceeding\n(e.g., a court of law).\n\nWhen a dispute, whether relating to a civil or criminal matter, reaches the\ncourt there will always be a number of issues which one party will have to prove\nin order to persuade the court to find in his or her favour. The law must ensure\ncertain guidelines are set out in order to ensure that evidence presented to the\ncourt can be regarded as trustworthy.\n\nIn Scots law the rule of corroboration in 'criminal' cases, requires that there\nmust be two pieces of evidence, to prove each 'essential' fact. For example, DNA\nevidence could corroborate an eye witness testimony, proving person X committed\na crime. This corroboration requirement no longer applies in 'civil' cases, with\nthe exception of some areas of family law, such as divorce, when another\nindividual, not party to the marriage, must act as 'witness', however this is\nnot referred to as corroboration.
