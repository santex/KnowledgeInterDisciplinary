During\ninfection, macrophages release cytokines which trigger neutrophils to seek the\nsite of infection by chemotaxis. There, the neutrophils engulf and destroy the\nbacteria and the bacteria resist the immune response by releasing toxins called\nleukocidins. Madigan, Michael T. and Martin, John M. Brock\nBiology of Microorganisms 11th ed. Pearson Prentice Hall. USA. 2006: 734\nAs the neutrophils die off from toxins and old age, they are destroyed by\nmacrophages, forming the viscous pus.\n\nBacteria that cause pus are called 'suppurative', 'pyogenic', or 'purulent'. If the agent also creates mucus, it is\ncalled mucopurulent. Purulent infections can be treated with an antiseptic.\n\nDespite normally being of a whitish-yellow hue, changes in the color of pus can\nbe observed under certain circumstances. Pus is sometimes green because of the\npresence of myeloperoxidase, an intensely green antibacterial protein produced\nby some types of white blood cells. Green, foul-smelling pus is found in certain\ninfections of [[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]. The greenish color is a result of the\npyocyanin bacterial pigment it produces. Amoebic abscesses of the liver produce\nbrownish pus, which is described as looking like \"anchovy paste\". Pus can also\nhave a foul odor.\n\nIn almost all cases when there is a collection of pus in the body, the clinician\nwill try to create an opening for it to evacuate - this principle has been\ndistilled into the famous Latin aphorism \"Ubi pus, ibi evacua!\"\n\nSome common disease processes caused by pyogenic infections are impetigo,\nosteomyelitis, septic arthritis, and necrotizing fasciitis.\n","linknr":170,"url":"Pus","recorded":1362574892,"links":17,"instances":["skin"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Body fluids","Immune system","Medical terminology"],"headings":["Pyogenic bacteria","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/90/Swollen_eye_with_conjunctivitis.jpg/220px-Swollen_eye_with_conjunctivitis.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5f/Abszess.jpg/220px-Abszess.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ec/Cholangitis.jpg/220px-Cholangitis.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["epidermis","skin"]],"members":["epidermis"],"related":["Conjunctivitis","Hepatopancreatic_ampulla","Cholangitis","Exudate","Inflammation","Infection","Abscess","Epidermis_(skin)","Pustule","Pimple","Protein","Leukocytes","Immune_response","Neutrophils","Macrophage","Cytokine","Chemotaxis","Leukocidin","Phagocytosis","Mucus","Antiseptic","Myeloperoxidase","Amoeba","Liver","Ubi_pus,_ibi_evacua","Impetigo","Osteomyelitis","Septic_arthritis","Necrotizing_fasciitis","Albert_Fraenkel","Carl_Friedl√§nder","Pyoderma","Serous_fluid","Ubi_pus,_ibi_evacua","Boil"]}
