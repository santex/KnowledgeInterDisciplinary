It was founded in 1966 in New York\nCity by A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada. Its core beliefs are\nbased on traditional Indian scriptures, such as the [[Bhagavata Purana|ÅrÄ«mad\nBhÄgavatam]] and the [[Bhagavad Gita|Bhagavad-gÄ«tÄ]], {{Cite book |first =\nKlaus | last = Klostermaier |author-link = Oxford University |title = A Concise\nEncyclopedia of Hinduism |place = Oxford |publisher = Oneworld Publications\n|year = 1998 |isbn = 1-85168-175-2 |ref = harv |postscript = }}\nwhich date back 1,000â2,000 years (scholarly) or 5,000 years (traditional).
