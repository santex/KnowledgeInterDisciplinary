Chandra is sensitive to X-ray sources 100 times fainter than\nany previous X-ray telescope, enabled by the high angular resolution of its\nmirrors. Since the Earth's atmosphere absorbs the vast majority of X-rays, they\nare not detectable from Earth-based telescopes; therefore space-based telescopes\nare required to make these observations. Chandra is an Earth satellite in a 64\nhour orbit, and its mission is ongoing as of 2013.\n\nChandra is one of the Great Observatories, along with the Hubble Space\nTelescope, Compton Gamma Ray Observatory (1991-2000), and the Spitzer Space\nTelescope. Chandra has been described as being as revolutionary to astronomy as\nGalileo's first telescope. [http://chandra.harvard.edu/ten The Extraordinary\nUniverse with Chandra - Harvard University]\n\nIt was named in honor of the Nobel-prize winning Indian-American astrophysicist\nSubrahmanyan Chandrasekhar who worked for University of Chicago from 1937 until\nhe died in 1995. He was known for determining the maximum mass for white dwarfs.\n\"Chandra\" means \"moon\" in Sanskrit. Before 1998, it was known as 'AXAF', the\n'Advanced X-ray Astrophysics Facility'. AXAF was assembled and tested by TRW\n(now Northrop Grumman Aerospace Systems) in Redondo Beach, California.\n","linknr":695,"url":"Chandra_X-ray_Telescope","recorded":1362268007,"links":69,"instances":["moon","astronomy"],"pdf":["http://cxc.harvard.edu/cal/Hrma/users_guide/hrma-notes.pdf"],"categories":["X-ray
