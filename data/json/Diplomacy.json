International treaties are usually negotiated by\ndiplomats prior to endorsement by national politicians. In an informal or social\nsense, diplomacy is the employment of tact to gain strategic advantage or to\nfind mutually acceptable solutions to a common challenge, one set of tools being\nthe phrasing
