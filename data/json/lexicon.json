The lexicon is also thought to include bound\nmorphemes, which cannot stand alone as words (such as most affixes). In some\nanalyses, compound words and certain classes of idiomatic expressions and other\ncollocations are also considered to be part of the lexicon. Dictionaries\nrepresent attempts at listing, in alphabetical order, the lexicon of a given\nlanguage; usually, however, bound morphemes are not included.\n\nMore formally, a 'lexicon' is a language's inventory of lexemes. Coined in\nEnglish 1603, the word \"lexicon\" derives from the Greek (lexicon), neuter of\n(lexikos), \"of or for words\",<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc-\n=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dlecikos λεξικός], Henry George Liddell,\nRobert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus Digital Library</ref> from\n(lexis), \"speech\", \"word\",<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Pe-\nrseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dle%2Fcis λέξις], Henry George Liddell,\nRobert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus Digital Library</ref> and that\nfrom (lego), \"to say\", \"to speak\".<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/tex-\nt?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0058%3Aentry%3Dle%2Fgw3 λέγω], Henry George\nLiddell, Robert Scott, An Intermediate Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus Digital\nLibrary</ref>\n",
