{"cursor":"7576","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"s. Photosynthesis is the main means by which plants, algae and many bacteria\n   produce organic compounds and oxygen from carbon dioxide and water ( green arrow ).]]\n\nAn 'autotroph' (\"self-feeding\", from the Greek autos \"self\" and trophe\n\"nourishing\") or \"producer\", is an organism that produces complex organic\ncompounds (such as carbohydrates, fats, and proteins) from simple substances\npresent in its surroundings, generally using energy from light (photosynthesis)\nor inorganic chemical reactions (chemosynthesis). They are the producers in a\nfood chain, such as plants on land or algae in water. They are able to make\ntheir own food, and do not need a living energy or organic carbon source.\nAutotrophs can reduce carbon dioxide to make organic compounds, creating a store\nof chemical energy. Most autotrophs use water as the reducing agent, but some\ncan use other hydrogen compounds such as hydrogen sulfide. Phototrophs, a type\nof autotroph, convert physical energy from sunlight (in case of green plants)\ninto chemical energy in the form of reduced carbon.\n\nAutotrophs can be phototrophs or chemotrophs. Phototrophs use light as an energy\nsource, while chemotrophs utilize electron donors as a source of energy, whether\nfrom organic or inorganic sources; however in the case of autotrophs, these\nelectron donors come from inorganic chemical sources. Such chemotrophs are\nlithotrophs. Lithotrophs make use of inorganic compounds, such as hydrogen\nsulfide, elemental sulfur, ammonium and ferrous iron, as reducing agents for\nbiosynthesis and chemical energy storage. Photoautotrophs and lithoautotrophs\nuse a portion of the ATP produced during photosynthesis or the oxidation of\ninorganic compounds to reduce NADP + to NADPH in order to form organic\ncompounds.\n","linknr":513,"url":"Autotroph","recorded":1362504966,"links":74,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Trophic ecology","Microbial growth and nutrition","Biology terminology"],"headings":["Ecology","Variants","Flowchart","See also","References","Footnotes"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/Auto-and_heterotrophs.png/300px-Auto-and_heterotrophs.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ec/Colpfl27a.jpg/200px-Colpfl27a.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/Troph_flowchart.svg/400px-Troph_flowchart.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b3/FoodWeb.jpg/140px-FoodWeb.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Genomics_GTL_Program_Payoffs.jpg/140px-Genomics_GTL_Program_Payoffs.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["iron(ii_oxide"]],"members":[],"related":["Photosynthesis","Automation","Greek_language","Organic_compound","Carbohydrate","Fat","Protein","Photosynthesis","Chemosynthesis","Primary_production","Food_chain","Plant","Algae","Carbon","Redox","Carbon_dioxide","Reducing_agent","Photochemical_carbon_dioxide_reduction","Phototroph","Chemotroph","Lithotroph","Hydrogen_sulfide","Sulfur","Ammonium","Iron(II)_oxide","Adenosine_triphosphate","Nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_phosphate","Ecosystem","Primary_production","Heterotroph","Food","Animal","Fungi","Bacterium","Protozoa","Heterotrophs","Carnivorous","Nutrient","Primary_production","Photon","Solar_energy","Sun","Photosynthesis","Water_splitting","Redox","Hydrogen_atoms","Metabolism","Primary_production","Simple_sugars","Polymerization","Carbohydrate","Fat","Protein","Heterotroph","Carbohydrate","Fat","Protein","Heterotrophs","Nitrate","Sulfate","Phosphate","Organic_compound","Carbon","Light","Inorganic_compounds","Photoheterotroph","Chemoheterotroph","Radiotrophic_fungus","Chernobyl_nuclear_power_plant","Heterotroph","Autotroph","Chemoautotroph","Photoautotroph","Heterotroph","Chemoheterotroph","Primary_nutritional_groups","Greek_language"]}
