Arthropods are members of\nthe phylum 'Arthropoda' (from Greek {{lang|el|Ã¡rthron}}, \"joint\", and\n{{lang|el|podÃ³s}} \"leg\", which together mean \"jointed leg\"), and include the\ninsects, arachnids, and crustaceans. Arthropods are characterized by their\njointed limbs and cuticles, which are mainly made of Î±-chitin; the cuticles of\ncrustaceans are also biomineralized with calcium carbonate. The rigid cuticle\ninhibits growth, so arthropods replace it periodically by moulting. The\narthropod body plan consists of repeated segments, each with a pair of\nappendages. They are so versatile that they have been compared to Swiss Army\nknives, and it has enabled them to become the most species-rich members of all\necological guilds in most environments. They have over a million described\nspecies, making up more than 80% of all described living animal species, and are\none of only two animal groups that are very successful in dry\nenvironments â the other being the amniotes. They range in size from\nmicroscopic plankton up to forms a few meters long.\n\nArthropods' primary internal cavity is a hemocoel, which accommodates their\ninternal organs and through which their blood circulates; they have open\ncirculatory systems. Like their exteriors, the internal organs of arthropods\nare generally built of repeated segments. Their nervous system is \"ladder-\nlike\", with paired ventral nerve cords running through all segments and forming\npaired ganglia in each segment. Their heads are formed by fusion of varying\nnumbers of segments, and their brains are formed by fusion of the ganglia of\nthese segments and encircle the esophagus. The respiratory and excretory\nsystems of arthropods vary, depending as much on their environment as on the\nsubphylum to which they belong.\n\nTheir vision relies on various combinations of compound eyes and pigment-pit\nocelli: in most species the ocelli can only detect the direction from which\nlight is coming, and the compound eyes are the main source of information, but\nthe main eyes of spiders are ocelli that can form images and, in a few cases,\ncan swivel to track prey. Arthropods also have a wide range of chemical and\nmechanical sensors, mostly based on modifications of the many setae (bristles)\nthat project through their cuticles.\n\nArthropods' methods of reproduction and development are diverse; all terrestrial\nspecies use internal fertilization, but this is often by indirect transfer of\nthe sperm via an appendage or the ground, rather than by direct injection.\nAquatic species use either internal or external fertilization. Almost all\narthropods lay eggs, but scorpions give birth to live young after the eggs have\nhatched inside the mother. Arthropod hatchlings vary from miniature adults to\ngrubs and caterpillars that lack jointed limbs and eventually undergo a total\nmetamorphosis to produce the adult form. The level of maternal care for\nhatchlings varies from nonexistent to the prolonged care provided by scorpions.\n\nThe versatility of the arthropod modular body plan has made it difficult for\nzoologists and paleontologists to classify them and work out their\nevolutionary ancestry, which dates back to the Cambrian period. From the late\n1950s to late 1970s, it was thought that arthropods were polyphyletic, that\nis, there was no single arthropod ancestor. Now they are generally regarded as\nmonophyletic. Historically, the closest evolutionary relatives of arthropods\nwere considered to be annelid worms, as both groups have segmented bodies.\nThis hypothesis is now largely rejected, with annelids and molluscs forming\nthe superphylum Lophotrochozoa. Many analyses support a placement of\narthropods with cycloneuralians (or their constituent clades) in a superphylum\nEcdysozoa. Overall however, the basal relationships of Metazoa are not yet\nwell resolved. Likewise, the relationships between various arthropod groups\nare still actively debated.\n\nArthropods contribute to the human food supply both directly as food, and more\nimportantly as pollinators of crops. Some specific species are known to spread\nsevere disease to humans, livestock, and crops.\n","linknr":1699,"url":"Arthropod","recorded":1362483457,"links":177,"instances":["larva","geometry","spider","biology","anatomy","anatomy","biology","journal","insect_mouthpart","ecology","evolution","biology","zoology","biology"],"pdf":["http://si-pddr.si.edu/dspace/bitstream/10088/1315/1/Odegaard_2000.pdf","http://si-pddr.si.edu/dspace/bitstream/10088/1315/1/Odegaard_2000.pdf","http://www.paleo.pan.pl/people/Dzik/Publications/Verdun.pdf","http://www.paleo.pan.pl/people/Dzik/Publications/Verdun.pdf","http://eprints.gla.ac.uk/2933/01/Cohen_2933.pdf","http://eprints.gla.ac.uk/2933/01/Cohen_2933.pdf","http://www.cosmonova.org/download/18.4e32c81078a8d9249800021554/Bengtson2004ESF.pdf","http://www.cosmonova.org/download/18.4e32c81078a8d9249800021554/Bengtson2004ESF.pdf","http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/reprint/36/2/423.pdf","http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/reprint/36/2/423.pdf","http://www.suss-microoptics.com/downloads/Publications/Miniaturized_Imaging_Systems.pdf","http://www.suss-microoptics.com/downloads/Publications/Miniaturized_Imaging_Systems.pdf","http://www.insecta.ufv.br/Entomologia/ent/disciplina/ban%20160/AULAT/aula8/truman.pdf","http://www.insecta.ufv.br/Entomologia/ent/disciplina/ban%20160/AULAT/aula8/truman.pdf","http://faculty.ncf.edu/mccord/pdf/AquaticInsectGeoffSmith.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20081003122816/http://faculty.ncf.edu/mccord/pdf/AquaticInsectGeoffSmith.pdf","http://faculty.ncf.edu/mccord/pdf/AquaticInsectGeoffSmith.pdf","http://www.samuseum.sa.gov.au/Journals/TRSSA/TRSSA_V081/TRSSA_V081_p185p188.pdf","http://www.samuseum.sa.gov.au/Journals/TRSSA/TRSSA_V081/TRSSA_V081_p185p188.pdf","http://biosys-serv.biologie.uni-ulm.de/Downloadfolder/PDFs%20Team/2007b_Braun_etal.pdf","http://biosys-serv.biologie.uni-ulm.de/Downloadfolder/PDFs%20Team/2007b_Braun_etal.pdf","http://palaeontology.palass-pubs.org/pdf/Vol%2039/Pages%20605-614.pdf","http://palaeontology.palass-pubs.org/pdf/Vol%2039/Pages%20605-614.pdf","http://homepage.mac.com/paulselden/Sites/Website/ARES.pdf","http://homepage.mac.com/paulselden/Sites/Website/ARES.pdf","http://www.santafe.edu/research/publications/workingpapers/00-08-044.pdf","http://www.santafe.edu/research/publications/workingpapers/00-08-044.pdf","http://www.geology.cz/bulletin/contents/2003/vol79no4/323_bergstrom.pdf","http://www.geology.cz/bulletin/contents/2003/vol79no4/323_bergstrom.pdf","http://www.csulb.edu/~dlunderw/entomology/Arthropodphylogeny2006.pdf","http://www.csulb.edu/~dlunderw/entomology/Arthropodphylogeny2006.pdf","http://www.amonline.net.au/palaeontology/pdf/giribet-etal2005.pdf","http://www.amonline.net.au/palaeontology/pdf/giribet-etal2005.pdf","http://www.codexalimentarius.net/download/standards/50/CXS_152e.pdf","http://www.codexalimentarius.net/download/standards/50/CXS_152e.pdf","http://www.marine.usf.edu/pjocean/packets/f01/f01u5p3.pdf","http://www.marine.usf.edu/pjocean/packets/f01/f01u5p3.pdf","http://polypedal.berkeley.edu/twiki/pub/PolyPEDAL/PolypedalPublications/Distributed_BB.pdf","http://polypedal.berkeley.edu/twiki/pub/PolyPEDAL/PolypedalPublications/Distributed_BB.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20071025222603/http://www.afpmb.org/pubs/tims/tg27/docs/Insect%20and%20Mite%20Pests%20in%20Food%20Gorham.pdf","http://www.afpmb.org/pubs/tims/tg27/docs/Insect%20and%20Mite%20Pests%20in%20Food%20Gorham.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20071025222603/http://www.afpmb.org/pubs/tims/tg27/docs/Insect%20and%20Mite%20Pests%20in%20Food%20Gorham.pdf"],"categories":["Arthropods|"],"headings":["Description","Reproduction
