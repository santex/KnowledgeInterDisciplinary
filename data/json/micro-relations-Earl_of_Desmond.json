{"cursor":"16429","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n, progenitor of the Irish Geraldines, from a manuscript of the Expugnatio\nHibernica, an account of the 1169 invasion of Ireland written by Maurice's\nnephew, Gerald of Wales in 1189.]] The title of 'Earl of Desmond' has been held\nhistorically by lords in Ireland, first as a title outside of the peerage system\nand later as part of the Peerage of Ireland.\n\nThe original Barony of Desmond in the province of Munster was held by\ndescendants of Thomas FitzMaurice FitzGerald, Lord of O'Connelloe. Thomas was a\nyounger son of Maurice FitzGerald, Lord of Lanstephan, a key supporter of Lord\nPembroke (\"Strongbow\") in his 1169 invasion of Ireland. Maurice was the founder\nof the Cambro-Norman FitzGerald dynasty in Ireland. Being descended from a\nyounger son of Maurice FitzGerald, the House of Desmond was a cadet branch of\nthe Irish Geraldines; the senior branch, the House of Kildare, ancestors of the\nDukes of Leinster, was founded by Thomas's elder brother, Gerald FitzMaurice\nFitzGerald, 1st Lord of Offaly.\n\nThomas's son, John FitzThomas FitzGerald, became the first Baron Desmond upon\nreceiving, for his homage and service, a grant in 1259 of the lands of Decies\nand Desmond from Prince Edward of England. Before passing to Edward, these lands\nhad been held by Thomas FitzAnthony, the father of John's wife Margery\nFitzAnthony.\n\nThe title Earl of Desmond was first created for Maurice FitzGerald, 4th Baron\nDesmond in approximately 1329.  Over time, according to\nEnglish sources, the FitzGerald family became highly assimilated to the local\nIrish culture. The final Earl of Desmond of this creation was Gerald FitzGerald,\nthe 15th (or, by some counts, the 16th) Earl. The FitzGeralds had resisted the\nReformation of King Henry VIII and, after the failure of the first and second\nDesmond Rebellions, the 15th Earl was defeated and killed by forces loyal to\nQueen Elizabeth I on 11 November 1583. His title, along with the enormous\nestates of his family, were forfeit to the English Crown. His nephew, James\nFitzThomas FitzGerald, attempted to regain control of both during the Nine Years\nWar, but he was captured by the English and executed in 1603.\n\nThe second creation was in 1600 for James FitzGerald, who was also created Baron\nInchiquin. These titles became extinct on his death the next year.\n\nThe third creation was in 1619 for Richard Preston, 1st Lord Dingwall, who was\nalso created Baron Dunmore. On his death in 1628 the Earldom and Irish Barony\nbecame extinct while the Scottish Lordship of Parliament passed to his daughter\nElizabeth Preston, who married the 1st Duke of Ormonde.\n\nThe fourth creation was in 1628 for George Feilding, 1st Viscount Callan. For\ninformation on this creation, see the Earl of Denbigh.\n","linknr":347,"url":"Earl_of_Desmond","recorded":1364219791,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Earl_of_Desmond&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Earl_of_Desmond&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/File:Ireland_1450.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Ireland_1450.png/250px-Ireland_1450.png","/wiki/File:Ireland_1450.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/File:Maurice_FitzGerald,_Lord_Lanstephan.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a2/Maurice_FitzGerald%2C_Lord_Lanstephan.jpg/175px-Maurice_FitzGerald%2C_Lord_Lanstephan.jpg","/wiki/File:Maurice_FitzGerald,_Lord_Lanstephan.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Maurice_FitzGerald,_Lord_of_Lanstephan","/wiki/FitzGerald_dynasty","/wiki/Norman_invasion_of_Ireland","/wiki/Gerald_of_Wales","/wiki/Ireland","/wiki/Peerage_of_Ireland","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Provinces_of_Ireland","/wiki/Munster","/wiki/Thomas_FitzMaurice_FitzGerald","/wiki/Maurice_FitzGerald,_Lord_of_Lanstephan","/wiki/Richard_de_Clare,_2nd_Earl_of_Pembroke","/wiki/Norman_invasion_of_Ireland","/wiki/Cambro-Norman","/wiki/FitzGerald_dynasty","/wiki/Maurice_FitzGerald,_Lord_of_Lanstephan","/wiki/FitzGerald_dynasty","/wiki/Duke_of_Leinster","/wiki/Gerald_FitzMaurice,_1st_Lord_of_Offaly","/wiki/John_FitzGerald,_1st_Baron_Desmond","/wiki/Baron_Desmond","/wiki/Edward_I_of_England","/wiki/John_FitzGerald,_1st_Baron_Desmond","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Maurice_FitzGerald,_1st_Earl_of_Desmond","#cite_note-3","#cite_note-4","/wiki/More_Irish_than_the_Irish_themselves","/wiki/Gerald_FitzGerald,_15th_Earl_of_Desmond","/wiki/English_Reformation","/wiki/Henry_VIII_of_England","/wiki/Desmond_Rebellions","/wiki/Elizabeth_I_of_England","/wiki/King_of_England","/wiki/James_FitzThomas_FitzGerald","/wiki/Nine_Years_War_(Ireland)","/wiki/James_FitzGerald,_1st_Earl_of_Desmond","/wiki/Richard_Preston,_1st_Earl_of_Desmond","/wiki/Lord_of_Parliament","/wiki/James_Butler,_1st_Duke_of_Ormonde","/wiki/George_Feilding,_1st_Earl_of_Desmond","/wiki/Earl_of_Denbigh","#Desmond_Geraldine_Arms","#Ancestry_of_the_Desmond_Geraldines","#Barons_Desmond_.281259.29","#Earls_of_Desmond.2C_First_creation_.281329.29","#16th_Earl_of_Desmond.2C_appointed_by_Hugh_O.27Neill_.281598.E2.80.931601.29","#Earls_of_Desmond.2C_Second_creation_.281600.29","#Earls_of_Desmond.2C_Third_creation_.281619.29","#Earls_of_Desmond.2C_Fourth_creation_.281628.29","#Notes","#References","/w/index.php?title=Earl_of_Desmond&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/File:Buttevant_Friary_South_Transept_South_Gable_FitzGerald_of_Desmond_Coat_of_Arms_Detail_2012_09_08.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8c/Buttevant_Friary_South_Transept_South_Gable_FitzGerald_of_Desmond_Coat_of_Arms_Detail_2012_09_08.jpg/220px-Buttevant_Friary_South_Transept_South_Gable_FitzGerald_of_Desmond_Coat_of_Arms_Detail_2012_09_08.jpg","/wiki/File:Buttevant_Friary_South_Transept_South_Gable_FitzGerald_of_Desmond_Coat_of_Arms_Detail_2012_09_08.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Buttevant_Franciscan_Friary","/wiki/Coat_of_arms","/wiki/Blazon","/wiki/Ermine_(heraldry)","/wiki/Saltire","/wiki/Gules","#cite_note-5","/wiki/Cadency","/wiki/Duke_of_Leinster","/wiki/Duke_of_Leinster#Coat_of_arms","/wiki/Argent","/wiki/John_F._Kennedy#Coat_of_arms","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/President_of_the_United_States","/wiki/John_F._Kennedy","/wiki/Chief_Herald_of_Ireland","/wiki/Rose_Kennedy","#cite_note-6","/wiki/Crest_(heraldry)","#cite_note-7","/wiki/File:Shanid_Castle_County_Limerick.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/Shanid_Castle_County_Limerick.jpg/220px-Shanid_Castle_County_Limerick.jpg","/wiki/File:Shanid_Castle_County_Limerick.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Shanagolden,_County_Limerick","/wiki/Shanagolden,_County_Limerick","#cite_note-8","/w/index.php?title=Earl_of_Desmond&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Thomas_FitzMaurice_FitzGerald","/wiki/Maurice_FitzGerald,_Lord_of_Lanstephan","/wiki/FitzGerald_dynasty","/wiki/Nest_ferch_Rhys","/wiki/Rhys_ap_Tewdwr","/
