They are best known for their\n1989 single \"Living in Oblivion\". The band is one of the primary bands which\ncarried electronic music's transition from the late 1980s into the 1990s and\nbeyond. With a current lineup consisting of Claude Strilio, Dania Morales and\nPaul Rijnders, the past members have included Carlos Pacheco, Gary\nStrilio and Dave South. The band is noted for its melodic, synth-driven dance\nbeats from its early years as well as its fusion of electronics and guitars\nwhich is its current musical focus. The band's songs, lyrics, as well as\nClaude's vocals have been widely regarded in the electronic music community as\nsome of the finest. The band also receives praise for its album artwork which\nranges from oil paintings to electronic paintings which are all works of Claude\nStrilio. Anything Box, (also known as Abox by its loyal fan-base), has released\nseveral albums, EPs and singles and continues to perform their energetic live\nshows around the world.\n\nThe band's name comes from the title of a book of short stories by Zenna\nHenderson, The Anything Box. In the title story, a young girl\nimagines the world as she would have it, apparently by staring at an empty\nspace between her hands. Her school teacher discovers that the box is\ninvisible, but real.\n\nAnything Box's most recent release is The Future Past EP (Endpop, June 2007)\nwhich features a remake and remixes of their 1990 fan-favorite \"Carmen\" as well\nas a Spanish version of the song. This marks the first time Anything Box has\nreleased a song in Spanish, which has often been requested by their fans.\n","linknr":175,"url":"Anything_Box","recorded":1375079479,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Anything_Box&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Anything_Box&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anything_Box&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Template:Citation_needed","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/Paterson,_New_Jersey","/wiki/New_Jersey","/wiki/Orange_County,_California","/wiki/California","/wiki/Music_genre","/wiki/Synthpop","/wiki/Electronic_music","/wiki/Indie_pop","/wiki/Dance-pop","/wiki/New_Wave_music","/wiki/Industrial_music","/wiki/Record_label","/wiki/Epic_Records","http://www.anythingbox.com/","http://www.endpop.com/","http://www.myspace.com/anythingbox","/wiki/Claude_Strilio","/wiki/Electronic_music","/wiki/Synthpop","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Carlos_Pacheco","/wiki/Dave_South","/wiki/Zenna_Henderson","#cite_note-2","#History","#Formation.2FPeace_.281986.E2.80.931990.29","#Worth_.281992.29","#Hope_.281993.29","#Dance_CD-5_.281994.29","#The_Diary:_Page_One_.281995.29","#Mixology.1.2FLiving_In_Oblivion_.281996.29","#Elektrodelica_.281997.29","#Elektrospective_.281999.29","#Recovered_.282000.29","#The_Universe_Is_Expanding_.282001.29","#The_Effects_of_Stereo_TV_.282003.29","#The_Diary:_Separate_.282005.29","#Future_Past.2FFan_Tapes_and_Time_Travel_.282007.29","#Nineteen_.282008.29","#Band_member_projects","#Discography","#Out_of_print","#In_print","#Anything_Box_complete_discography","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Anything_Box&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Anything_Box&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Peace_(Anything_Box_album)","/wiki/Epic_Records","/w/index.php?title=Anything_Box&action=edit&section=3","/w/index.php?title=Worth_(album)&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Gareth_Jones_(music_producer)","/w/index.php?title=Anything_Box&action=edit&section=4","/w/index.php?title=Hope_(Anything_Box_album)&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Anything_Box&action=edit&section=5","/w/index.php?title=Anything_Box&action=edit&section=6","/wiki/Joy_Division_(band)","/wiki/New_Order","/w/index.php?title=Anything_Box&action=edit&section=7","/wiki/Salt_Lake_City","/wiki/Utah","/w/index.php?title=Anything_Box&action=edit&section=8","/wiki/The_Beatles","/wiki/Punk_rock","/w/index.php?title=Anything_Box&action=edit&section=9","/w/index.php?title=Anything_Box&action=edit&section=10","/wiki/DAT","/w/index.php?title=Anything_Box&action=edit&section=11","/w/index.php?title=Anything_Box&action=edit&section=12","/w/index.php?title=Anything_Box&action=edit&section=13","/w/index.php?title=Anything_Box&action=edit&section=14","/w/index.php?title=Anything_Box&action=edit&section=15","/wiki/Peace","http://www.anythingbox-nineteen.com/","/w/index.php?title=Anything_Box&action=edit&section=16","/w/index.php?title=Kult_Litre&action=edit&redlink=1","http://www.listenshow.com","/w/index.php?title=Anything_Box&action=edit&section=17","/w/index.php?title=Anything_Box&action=edit&section=18","/w/index.php?title=Anything_Box&action=edit&section=19","/w/index.php?title=Anything_Box&action=edit&section=20","/wiki/Freeware","/w/index.php?title=Anything_Box&action=edit&section=21","#cite_ref-1","http://www.anythingbox.com/anythingbox-epk.html","#cite_ref-2","/wiki/Fayetteville_Observer","/w/index.php?title=Anything_Box&action=edit&section=22","http://www.anythingbox.com/","http://www.youtube.com/anythingbox","http://www.anythingbox-nineteen.com","http://www.myspace.com/anythingbox","http://www.endpop.com","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anything_Box&oldid=544194397","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Electronic_music_groups_from_New_Jersey","/wiki/Category:Synthpop_New_Wave_musical_groups","/wiki/Category:American_New_Wave_musical_groups","/wiki/Category:Indie_pop_groups_from_Los_Angeles,_California","/wiki/Category:Indie_pop_groups_from_New_Jersey","/wiki/Category:Articles_needing_additional_references_from_May_2009","/wiki/Category:All_articles_needi
