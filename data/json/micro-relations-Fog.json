While fog is a type of stratus cloud, the term \"fog\" is typically\ndistinguished from the more generic term \"cloud\" in that fog is low-lying, and\nthe moisture in the fog is often generated locally (such as from a nearby body\nof water, like a lake or the ocean, or from nearby moist ground or marshes). Use of the term \"fog\" to mean any cloud that is at or\nnear the Earth's surface can result in ambiguity as when, for example, a\nstratocumulus cloud covers a mountaintop. An observer on the mountain may say\nthat he or she is in a fog, however, to outside observers a cloud is covering\nthe mountain. \"Standard practice for the design and operation of supercooled fog\ndispersal projects\" Thomas, P.

Further distinguishing the terms, fog rarely\nresults in rain, while clouds are the common source of rain. Fog is\ndistinguished from mist only by its density, as expressed in the resulting\ndecrease in visibility: Fog reduces visibility to less than 1 km\n(5/8 statute mile), whereas mist reduces visibility to no less than\n1 km . For aviation purposes in the UK, a visibility of less\nthan 5 km but greater than 999 m is considered to be mist if the relative\nhumidity is 70% or greater â below 70% haze is reported. annex 3 Seventeenth\nEdition July 2010 .\n\nThe foggiest place in the world is the Grand Banks off the island of\nNewfoundland, the meeting place of the cold Labrador Current from the north and\nthe much warmer Gulf Stream from the south. Some of the foggiest land areas in\nthe world include Argentia, Newfoundland and Point Reyes, California, each with\nover 200 foggy days per year. Even in generally warmer southern Europe, thick\nfog and localized fog is often found in lowlands and valleys, such as the lower\npart of the Po Valley and the Arno and Tiber valleys in Italy or Ebro Valley in\nnortheastern Spain, as well as on the Swiss plateau, especially in the Seeland\narea, in late autumn and winter. Other notably foggy areas include coastal Chile\n(in the south), coastal Namibia, and the Severnaya Zemlya islands.\n","linknr":571,"url":"Fog","recorded":1362372238,"links":110,"instances":["weather","photography","california","liquid_drop","island","meteorology","switzerland","fido"],"pdf":["http://www.ofcm.gov/fmh-1/pdf/H-CH8.pdf","http://www.ofcm.gov/fmh-1/pdf/H-CH8.pdf","http://www.knmi.nl/~hurkvd/Loco_workshop/Workshop_report.pdf","http://www.knmi.nl/~hurkvd/Loco_workshop/Workshop_report.pdf","http://www.hpc.ncep.noaa.gov/sfc/UASfcManualVersion1.pdf","http://www.hpc.ncep.noaa.gov/sfc/UASfcManualVersion1.pdf","http://www.nwas.org/ej/pdf/2007-FTT1.pdf","http://education.arm.gov/outreach/publications/08augnewsltr.pdf"],"categories":["Weather hazards to aircraft","Accidents involving fog","Snow or ice weather phenomena","Fog|Fog","Psychrometrics"],"headings":["Characteristics","{{Visible anchor|Types}}","Biological and human uses","See also","Notes","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/Fog_shadow_tv_tower.jpg/220px-Fog_shadow_tv_tower.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/94/Cloud.jpg/32px-Cloud.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/Fog_formet_above_a_ditch..jpg/220px-Fog_formet_above_a_ditch..jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7c/Dense_fog_over_Indian_Subcontinent.jpg/220px-Dense_fog_over_Indian_Subcontinent.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/33/Dense_Tule_fog_in_Bakersfield%2C_California.jpg/220px-Dense_Tule_fog_in_Bakersfield%2C_California.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/20080313_Foggy_Street.jpg/220px-20080313_Foggy_Street.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/87/FogParticles.jpg/220px-FogParticles.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c5/FogParticlesHighSpeed.jpg/220px-FogParticlesHighSpeed.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["newfoundland","island"],["seeland","switzerland"],["spray","liquid_drop"],["precipitation","meteorology"],["precipitation","meteorology"],["central_valley","california"],["fog_investigation_and_dispersal_operation","fido"],["fogging","photography"],["whiteout","weather"]],"members":["whiteout","fogging","central_valley","spray","newfoundland","precipitation","seeland","fog_investigation_and_dispersal_operation"],"related":["Water","Stratus_cloud","Stratocumulus_cloud","Mist","Visibility","Relative_humidity","Haze","Grand_Banks","Newfoundland_(island)","Labrador_Current","Gulf_Stream","Argentia","Point_Reyes","Po_Valley","Arno","Tiber","Ebro","Swiss_plateau","Seeland_(Switzerland)","Chile","Namibia","Severnaya_Zemlya","Dew_point","°C","°F","Water_vapor","Condensation","Virga","Cloud_condensation_nuclei","Stratus_cloud","Relative_humidity","Supersaturated","Dew_point","Hygroscopy","Spray_(liquid_drop)","Kelp","Precipitation_(meteorology)","Drizzle","Marine_layer","Crepuscular_rays","Thermal_radiation","Condensation","Heat_conduction","Turbulence","Vale_of_York","Tule_fog","National_Weather_Service","U.S._Department_of_Energy","Advection","Warm_front","Upwelling","Monsoon","Stratocumulus","BBC_Weather","Hoar_frost","Sea_smoke","Precipitation_(meteorology)","Evaporate","Slope","Orographic_lift","Adiabatic_process","Cloud_ceiling","Valley","Temperature_inversion","Topography","Central_Valley_(California)","Soft_rime","Hard_rime","Freezing_rain","Ice_fog","Freezing","Crystal","Ice","Arctic","Antarctic","Diamond_dust","Barrow,_Alaska","Light_pillar","Glycol","Glycerine","Chile","Peru","Hail","Phase_transition","Melting","Evaporation","Sequoia_sempervirens","Fog_net","Anti-fog","Automotive_lighting","Decontamination_foam","Fog_Investigation_and_Dispersal_Operation_(FIDO)","Fog_machine","Fogging_(photography)","Fog_lamp","Runway_visual_range","Transmissometer","Fog_season","Haboob","Mist","Smog","Whiteout_(weather)","University_of_Texas_Press","Cambridge_University_Press","University_of_California,_San_Diego","CRC_Press","NOAA"]}
