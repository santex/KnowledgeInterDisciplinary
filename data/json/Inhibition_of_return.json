IOR is\nusually measured with a cue-response paradigm, in which a person presses a\nbutton when he or she detects a target stimulus following the presentation of a\ncue that indicates the location in which the target will appear.

Although IOR occurs for both visual\nand auditory stimuli, IOR is greater for visual stimuli, and is\nstudied more often than auditory stimuli.\n","linknr":122,"url":"Inhibition_of_return","recorded":1362668430,"links":14,"instances":["psychologist"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Attention"],"headings":["Description of IOR Paradigm","Causes of IOR","Functional Significance of IOR","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["michael_posner","psychologist"]],"members":["michael_posner"],"related":["Stimulus","Exogenous","Endogenous","Michael_Posner_(psychologist)","Reaction_time","Anne_Treisman","Feature_integration_theory","Visual_search","Foraging"]}
