{"cursor":"4046","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nPrimary gold typically occurs in quartz veins. The extraction of gold ore from\nthese hard quartz veins was historically referred to as 'quartz reef mining'.\n\nA Prussian engineer, Jacob Brache was the first to think that quartz reefs might\nhave even more gold than alluvial fields.\n\nThe new mining companies had to sink very deep mine shafts to get quartz from\nthe reefs deep underground. Horizontal tunnels called drifts were dug out from\nthe shaft at different levels to find the gold-bearing rock.\n\nAll rock dug out had to be hoisted to the surface. So did lots of water and even\nthe workers at the end of the day. Big hoisting engines were installed to hoist\nlifts and buckets up the shafts.\n\nOn the surface above the shaft stands a building known as the headframe. This\ncontained a wheel called a gin wheel which lifted buckets of rock up to a raised\nplatform called a Brace. Wheeled buckets then carried the rock along elevated\ntracks to waste dumps or processing works. The steel cable that hoisted the\nbucket passed over the gin wheel.\n\nThe gold was brought to the surface as small particles embedded in lumps of\nquartz. The quartz was then crushed into a fine dust by stamping batteries in\na stamp mill. A stamp battery contained a row of stamps. On the bottom of\neach stamp was a heavy piece of iron steel. Each battery was driven by a cam\nshaft which was turned by a water wheel. The steel shoes went up and down\nbetween wooden guides and pounded the quartz which had been fed into steel\nboxes underneath the stampers. Ideally the stamping batteries would work 24\nhours a day.\n\nAfter crushing, the quartz dust was mixed with water to make sloppy mud which\nthen ran down sloping tables, called concentrating tables. On top of these\ntables were copper sheets coated with mercury, which attracts gold. The gold\nparticles stuck to the mercury, and could be collected from there.\n[http://www.egold.net.au/biogs/EG00009b.htm Mining
