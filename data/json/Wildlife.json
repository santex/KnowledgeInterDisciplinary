{"cursor":"13517","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n''.]] 'Wildlife' traditionally refers to non-domesticated vertebrates, but has\ncome to broadly reference to all wild plants, animals and other organisms .\nDomesticating wild plant and animal species for human benefit has occurred many\ntimes all over the planet, and has a major impact on the environment, both\npositive and negative.\n\nWildlife can be found in all ecosystems. Deserts, forests, rain forests, plains,\ngrasslands, other areas including the most developed urban sites, all have\ndistinct forms of wildlife. While the term in popular culture usually refers to\nanimals that are untouched by human factors, most scientists agree\nthat wildlife around is affected by human activities.\n\nHumans have historically tended to separate civilization from wildlife in a\nnumber of ways including the legal, social, and moral sense. Religions have\noften declared certain animals to be sacred, and in modern times concern for the\nnatural environment has provoked activists to protest the exploitation of\nwildlife for human benefit or entertainment.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Wildlife","recorded":1372152273,"links":[],"instances":["magazine"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Wildlife|"],"headings":["Food, pets, and traditional medicines","Religion","Tourism","Destruction","Media","See also","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["birding","magazine"]],"members":["birding"],"related":["Domesticated","Urban_area","Anthropologists","Stone_Age","Hunter-gatherer","Extinction","Fishing","Sport","Recreation","Bush_meat","East_Asia","Shark","Primate","Pangolin","TRAFFIC","CITES","Sacred","Religious","Eagle","Hawk","Feather","Cultural","Spirituality","Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas","Mitochondrial_DNA","Population_genetics","Millennia","Human_impact_on_the_environment","Exploitation","Africa","Extinction","Holocene_Mass_Extinction","Density_dependence","Fishing","Resource_depletion","Unsustainable_fishing_methods","Amazon_Rainforest","Biodiversity","Habitat","Mice","Cats","Rabbit","Dandelion","Poison_ivy","Charles_Darwin","Herbivorous","Hippopotamus","Insectivorous","Birds","Domino_effect","Chain_reaction","Biocoenosis","Black_drongo","Cattle_egret","India","Education","Television_show","National_Geographic_Society","CBS","American_Broadcasting_Company","Public_Broadcasting_Service","NBC","Zoologist","Marlin_Perkins","BBC_natural_history_unit","United_Kingdom","Sir_Peter_Scott","David_Attenborough","Komodo_dragon","Lemurs","Discovery_Channel","Animal_Planet","Public_Broadcasting_Service","Nature_documentary","NHNZ","National_Wildlife_Magazine","Birds_&_Blooms","Birding_(magazine)","Ranger_Rick","Biodiversity","Conservation_biology","Ecology","Endangered_species","European_Wildlife","Ex-situ_conservation","Gene_pool","Genetic_erosion","Genetic_pollution","In-situ_conservation","National_Wildlife_Federation","Natural_environment","Nature","Nature_preserve","Ornithology","United_States_Fish_and_Wildlife_Service","Wildcrafting","Wildlife_Conservation_Society","Wildlife_corridor","Wildlife_management","The_Wildlife_Society","Wildness","World_Wide_Fund_for_Nature"]}
