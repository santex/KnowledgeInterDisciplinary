The leafy stalk produces\nears which contain the grain, which are seeds called kernels. Maize kernels are\nused in cooking as a starch. The Olmec and Mayans cultivated it in numerous\nvarieties throughout Mesoamerica, cooked, ground or processed through\nnixtamalization. Beginning about 2500 BC, the crop spread through much of the\nAmericas.<ref>Roney,John. \"The Beginnings of Maize Agriculture.\" Archaeology\nSouthwest. Vol 23, No. 1, Winter 2009, p. 4</ref> The region developed a trade\nnetwork based on surplus and varieties of maize crops. After European contact\nwith the Americas in the late 15th and early 16th centuries, explorers and\ntraders carried maize back to Europe and introduced it to other countries. Maize\nspread to the rest of the world because of its ability to grow in diverse\nclimates. Sugar-rich varieties called sweet corn are usually grown for human\nconsumption, while field corn varieties are used for animal feed and as chemical\nfeedstocks.\n\nMaize is the most widely grown grain crop throughout the Americas,<ref\nname=\"FAOstats\"/> with 332 million metric tons grown annually in the United\nStates alone. Approximately 40% of the crop — 130 million tons — is used for\ncorn ethanol.<ref></ref> Transgenic maize (genetically modified corn) made up\n85% of the maize planted in the United States in 2009.<ref name = GMOCompass>[http://www.gmo-\ncompass.org/eng/agri_biotechnology/gmo_planting/341.genetically_modified_maize_-\nglobal_area_under_cultivation.html Genetically modified plants: Global\nCultivation Area Maize] GMO Compass, March 29, 2010, retrieved August 10,\n2010</ref>\n",
