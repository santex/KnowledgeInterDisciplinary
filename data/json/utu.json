His brother and sisters are Ishkur and the twins Inanna and\nEreshkigal.\n\nUtu is the god of the sun, justice, application of law, and the lord of truth.\nHe is usually depicted as wearing a horned helmet and carrying a saw-edged\nweapon not unlike a pruning saw. It is thought that every day, Utu emerges from\na mountain in the east, symbolizing dawn, and travels either via chariot or\nboat across the Earth, returning to a hole in a mountain in the west,\nsymbolizing sunset. Every night, Utu descends into the underworld to decide the\nfate of the dead. He is also depicted as carrying a mace, and standing with one\nfoot on a mountain. It's symbol is \"sun rays from the shoulders, and or sun\ndisk or a saw\".\n\nThe sun god is only modestly mentioned in Sumerian mythology with one of the\nnotable exceptions being the Epic of Gilgamesh. In the myth, Gilgamesh seeks to\nestablish his name with the assistance of Utu, because of his connection with\nthe cedar mountain. Gilgamesh and his father, Lugalbanda were kings of the first\ndynasty of Uruk, a lineage that Jeffrey H. Tigay suggested could be traced back\nto Utu himself. He further suggested that Lugalbanda's association with the sun-\ngod in the Old Babylonian version of the epic strengthened \"the impression that\nat one point in the history of the tradition the sun-god was also invoked as an\nancestor\".<ref name=\"Tigay2002\"></ref>\n\nMarduk is spelled AMAR.UTU in Sumerian, literally, \"the calf of Utu\" or \"the\nyoung bull of the Sun\".\n","title":"utu","headings":["See also","References","External Links"]},"micro-relation":["1: Sumerian_language","1: Sun","1: Sumerian_cuneiform","1: Unicode","1: Shamash","1: Sun_god","1: Sumerian_mythology","1: Ningal","1: Ishkur","1: Inanna","1: Ereshkigal","1: Epic_of_Gilgamesh","1: Gilgamesh","1: Mashu","1: Lugalbanda","1: Uruk","1: Old_Babylonian","1: Marduk","1: Utukku"]}
