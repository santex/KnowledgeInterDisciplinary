They are most closely related to the terns (family\nSternidae) and only distantly related to auks, skimmers, and more distantly to\nthe waders. Until the twenty-first century most gulls were placed in the genus\n[[Larus]], but this arrangement is now known to be polyphyletic, leading to the\nresurrection of several genera.\n\nGulls are typically medium to large birds, usually grey or white, often with\nblack markings on the head or wings. They typically have harsh wailing or\nsquawking calls, stout, longish bills, and webbed feet. Most gulls, particularly\nLarus species, are ground-nesting carnivores, which will take live food or\nscavenge opportunistically. Live food often includes crabs and small fish. Gulls\nhave prophylactic unhinging jaws which allow them to consume large prey. Apart\nfrom the kittiwakes, gulls are typically coastal or inland species, rarely\nventuring far out to sea The large species take up to four years to\nattain full adult plumage, but two years is typical for small gulls. Large White-\nHeaded Gulls are typically long-lived birds, with a maximum age of 49 years\nrecorded for the Herring Gull.\n\nGulls nest in large, densely packed noisy colonies. They lay two to three\nspeckled eggs in nests composed of vegetation. The young are precocial, being\nborn with dark mottled down, and mobile upon hatching.\n\nGullsâthe larger species in particularâare resourceful, inquisitive and\nintelligent birds, demonstrating complex methods of\ncommunication and a highly developed social structure. For example, many gull\ncolonies display mobbing behaviour, attacking and harassing would-be predators\nand other intruders. Alcock, J. (1998) Animal Behavior: An Evolutionary\nApproach (7th edition). Sinauer Associates, Inc. Sunderland, Massachusetts. ISBN\n0-87893-009-4 Certain species (e.g. the Herring Gull) have exhibited tool\nuse behaviour, using pieces of bread as bait with which to catch goldfish, for\nexample. Many species of gull have learned to coexist\nsuccessfully with humans and have thrived in human habitats. Others rely on kleptoparasitism to get\ntheir food. Gulls have been observed preying on live whales, landing on the\nwhale as it surfaces to peck out pieces of flesh.\n","linknr":635,"url":"Seagull","recorded":1362675602,"links":124,"instances":["animal","behavioral_ecologist","luring_substance","biology","biology","birds","eggs","unit","biology","biology"],"pdf":["http://elibrary.unm.edu/sora/Auk/v095n03/p0577-p0579.pdf","http://elibrary.unm.edu/sora/Auk/v095n03/p0577-p0579.pdf","http://elibrary.unm.edu/sora/Condor/files/issues/v081n01/p0093-p0095.pdf","http://elibrary.unm.edu/sora/Condor/files/issues/v081n01/p0093-p0095.pdf"],"categories":["Gulls|*","Bird
