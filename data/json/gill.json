The gills of some species, such\n as hermit crabs, have adapted to allow respiration on land provided they are\n kept moist. The microscopic structure of a gill presents a large surface area\n to the external environment.\n\nMany microscopic aquatic animals, and some larger but inactive ones, can absorb\nadequate oxygen through the entire surface of their bodies, and so can respire\nadequately without a gill. However, more complex or more active aquatic\norganisms usually require a gill or gills.\n\nGills usually consist of thin filaments of tissue, branches, or slender, tufted\nprocesses that have a highly folded surface to increase surface area. A high\nsurface area is crucial to the gas exchange of aquatic organisms, as water\ncontains only a small fraction of the dissolved oxygen that air does. A cubic\nmeter of air contains about 250 grams of oxygen at STP. The concentration of\noxygen in water is lower than air and it diffuses more slowly. In fresh water,\nthe dissolved oxygen content is approximately 8 cm<sup>3</sup>/L compared to\nthat of air which is 210 cm<sup>3</sup>/L. <ref name=\"Advanced Biology\"></ref>\nWater is 777 times more dense than air and is 100 times more viscous.<ref\nname=\"Advanced Biology\"/> Oxygen has a diffusion rate in air 10,000 times\ngreater than in water.<ref name=\"Advanced Biology\"/> The use of sac-like lungs\nto remove oxygen from water would not be efficient enough to sustain life.<ref\nname=\"Advanced Biology\"/> Rather than using lungs, \"[g]asesous exchange takes\nplace across the surface of highly vascularised gills over which a one-way\ncurrent of water is kept flowing by a specialised pumping mechanism. The density\nof the water prevents the gills from collapsing and lying on top of each other,\nwhich is what happens when a fish is taken out of water.\"<ref name=\"Advanced\nBiology\"/>\n\nWith the exception of some aquatic insects, the filaments and lamellae (folds)\ncontain blood or coelomic fluid, from which gases are exchanged through the thin\nwalls. The blood carries oxygen to other parts of the body. Carbon dioxide\npasses from the blood through the thin gill tissue into the water. Gills or gill-\nlike organs, located in different parts of the body, are found in various groups\nof aquatic animals, including mollusks, crustaceans, insects, fish, and\namphibians.\n","title":"gill","headings":["Vertebrate gills","Invertebrate gills","See also","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["2: Carbon_dioxide","2: Surface_area","2: Crustacean","2: Amphibian","2: Gill_raker","2: Spiracle","2: Gill_slit","2: External_gills","1: Birth_defect","1: Respiration_organ","1: Aquatic_ecosystem","1: Oxygen","1: Water","1: Hermit_crab","1: Gas_exchange","1: Dissolved_oxygen","1: Air","1: Cubic_meter","1: Grams","1: Standard_conditions_for_temperature_and_pressure","1: Fresh_water","1: Insect","1: Blood","1: Body_cavity","1: Mollusk","1: Vertebrate","1: Pharynx","1: Countercurrent_exchange","1: Tonsil","1: Thymus_gland","1: Eustachian_tube","1: Branchial_pouch","1: Shark","1: Cartilage","1: Septum","1: Chimaera","1: Osteichthyes","1: Teleost","1: Electrolyte","1: Osmolarity","1: Sea_water","1: Salt","1: Osmosis","1: Lamprey","1: Hagfish","1: Tadpole","1: Metamorphosis","1: Lungfish","1: Actinopterygii","1: Galen","1: Pliny_the_Elder","1: Aristotle","1: Greek_language","1: Fin","1: Echinodermata","1: Starfish","1: Sea_urchin","1: Diverticulum","1: Water_vascular_system","1: Mollusc","1: Larva","1: Dragon_fly","1: Gastrointestinal_tract","1: Rectum","1: Aquatic_insects","1: Invertebrate_trachea","1: Plastron","1: Hydrophobic","1: Setae","1: Solubility","1: Water_movement","1: Beetle","1: Elmidae","1: Weevil","1: True_bug","1: Aphelocheiridae","1: Aquatic_respiration","1: Book_lung","1: Fish_gill","1: Lung"]}
