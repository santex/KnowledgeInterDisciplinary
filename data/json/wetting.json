Wetting and\nthe surface forces that control wetting are also responsible for other related\neffects, including so-called capillary effects. Regardless of the amount of\nwetting, the shape of a liquid drop on a rigid surface is roughly a truncated\nsphere. Various degrees of wetting are summarized in this article.\n","title":"wetting","headings":["Explanation","High-energy vs. low-energy surfaces","Ideal solid surfaces","Non-ideal rough solid surfaces","Spreading Dynamics","Effect of surfactants on wetting","See also","References"]},"micro-relation":["3: Liquid","3: Solid","2: Surface","2: Adhesion","2: Force","2: Chemical_bond","2: Contact_angle","2: Lotus_effect","2: Surface_tension","2: Cassie's_law","1: Intermolecular","1: Capillary_action","1: Spherical_cap","1: Adhesive","1: Water","1: Hydrophilic","1: Hydrophobic","1: Energy","1: Glass","1: Ceramic","1: Van_der_Waals_force","1: William_Zisman","1: Rectilinear","1: Organic_compound","1: Critical_surface_tension","1: Hysteresis","1: Thermodynamic_equilibrium","1: Triangle","1: Young_equation","1: Gas","1: Droplet","1: Immiscible","1: Wenzel_model","1: Roughness_ratio","1: Young_contact_angle","1: Intrinsic","1: Hysteresis#Contact_angle_hysteresis","1: Wetting_transition","1: Viscosity","1: Density","1: Gravitational_constant","1: Surfactants","1: Adsorption","1: Amott_index","1: Anti-fog","1: Dewetting","1: Electrowetting","1: Buoyancy","1: Sessile_drop_technique"]}
