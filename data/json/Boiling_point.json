A liquid at high-pressure has a higher boiling point than\nwhen that liquid is at atmospheric pressure. In other words, the boiling point\nof a liquid varies depending upon the surrounding environmental pressure. For a\ngiven pressure, different liquids boil at different temperatures.\n\nThe 'normal boiling point' (also called the 'atmospheric boiling point' or the\n'atmospheric pressure boiling point') of a liquid is the special case in which\nthe vapor pressure of the liquid equals the defined atmospheric pressure at sea\nlevel, 1 atmosphere. [http://www.chem.purdue.edu/gchelp/gloss/normalbp.html\nGeneral Chemistry Glossary] Purdue University website page Section\n71, page 224 At that temperature, the vapor pressure of the liquid becomes\nsufficient to overcome atmospheric pressure and allow bubbles of vapor to form\ninside the bulk of the liquid. The 'standard boiling point' is now (as of 1982)\ndefined by IUPAC as the temperature at which boiling occurs under a pressure of\n1 bar.

Evaporation is a surface phenomenon in which\nmolecules located near the liquid's edge, not contained by enough liquid\npressure on that side, escape into the surroundings as vapor. On the other hand,\nboiling is a process in which molecules anywhere in the liquid escape, resulting\nin the formation of vapor bubbles within the liquid.\n","linknr":355,"url":"Boiling_point","recorded":1362372053,"links":89,"instances":["chemistry","mathematical_constant","chemistry","phase_transition","chemistry","unit","thermodynamics","unit","chemistry"],"pdf":["http://www.iupac.org/publications/pac/1982/pdf/5406x1239.pdf","http://highered.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/dl/free/0073529214/395307/appdxs1_2.pdf"],"categories":["Concepts in physics","Thermodynamics","Threshold temperatures"],"headings":["Saturation temperature and pressure","Relation between the normal boiling point and the vapor pressure of liquids","Properties of the elements","Boiling point as a reference property of a pure compound","Impurities and mixtures","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/Kochendes_wasser02.jpg/350px-Kochendes_wasser02.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/6/9/469762e9ca9f7a09f3dff6e575fb04c5.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/2/3/7/23778b1022fc8bb9bcd84fafc7159666.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/1/e/e1e1d3d40573127e9ee0480caf1283d6.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/1/3/8/13899aa46204b02713a854702142955d.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/1/7/d/17dd62a7db58c6964197506872dab925.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/3/7/3/37388ac88f952ca253c1301db58f393c.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/3/c/1/3c178b05d8a108e6346e61420651bedf.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/96/Vapor_Pressure_Chart.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/Binary_Boiling_Point_Diagram_new.svg/350px-Binary_Boiling_Point_Diagram_new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0b/Phase_change_-_en.svg/300px-Phase_change_-_en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["atmosphere","unit"],["bar","unit"],["critical_point","thermodynamics"],["e","mathematical_constant"],["atmosphere","unit"],["volatility","chemistry"],["critical_point","thermodynamics"],["polarity","chemistry"],["sublimation","phase_transition"],["salt","chemistry"],["volatility","chemistry"],["solution","chemistry"],["critical_point","thermodynamics"]],"members":["salt","e","volatility","sublimation","solution","bar","critical_point","atmosphere","polarity"],"related":["Vapor_pressure","Liquid","Vacuum","Atmospheric_pressure","Pressure","Atmosphere_(unit)","Purdue_University","IUPAC","Bar_(unit)","Heat_of_vaporization","Evaporation","Vapor","Condensation","Gas","Thermal_energy","Phase_transition","Isobaric_process","Heat","Kilopascal","Atmospheric_pressure","Critical_point_(thermodynamics)","Triple_point","Clausius-Clapeyron_equation","Ideal_gas_constant","Natural_logarithm","E_(mathematical_constant)","System","Condensation","Flash_evaporation","Water","Celsius","Fahrenheit","Mount_Everest","IUPAC","Methyl_chloride","Atmosphere_(unit)","Helium","Rhenium","Tungsten","Kelvin","Standard_pressure","Chemical_compound","Volatility_(chemistry)","Melting_point","Physical_property","Triple_point","Critical_point_(thermodynamics)","Ionic_bond","Metal","Molecule","Molecular_mass","Macromolecule","Polymer","Polarity_(chemistry)","Hydrogen_bond","Carboxylic_acid","Sublimation_(phase_transition)","Carbon_dioxide","Sublimation_point","Solution","Salt_(chemistry)","Volatility_(chemistry)","Mole_fraction","Solution_(chemistry)","Concentration","Saline_water","Water","Condensation","Distillation","Boiling-point_elevation","Critical_point_(thermodynamics)","Ebulliometer","Joback_method","Subcooling","Superheating","Trouton's_constant"]}
