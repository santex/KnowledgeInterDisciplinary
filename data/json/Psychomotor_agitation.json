This includes pacing\naround a room, wringing one's hands, pulling off clothing and putting it back on\nand other similar actions. In more severe cases, the motions may become harmful\nto the individual, such as ripping, tearing or chewing at the skin around one's\nfingernails or lips to the point of bleeding. Psychomotor agitation is a symptom\ntypically found in major depressive disorder or obsessive-compulsive disorder,\nand sometimes the manic phase in bipolar disorder, although it can also be a\nresult of an excess intake of stimulants. The middle aged and the elderly are\nmore at risk to express this condition .\n","linknr":625,"url":"Psychomotor_agitation","recorded":1362892013,"links":37,"instances":["dementia"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Abnormal psychology","Psychology"],"headings":["Treatment","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Psi2.svg/30px-Psi2.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ce/Plutchik-wheel.svg/90px-Plutchik-wheel.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["agitation","dementia"]],"members":["agitation"],"related":["Anxiety","Major_depressive_disorder","Obsessive-compulsive_disorder","Bipolar_disorder","Stimulants","Midazolam","Droperidol","Agitation_(dementia)"]}
