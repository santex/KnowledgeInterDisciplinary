{"cursor":"13435","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"{{multiple issues|\n\n\n\n}} 'Payment protection insurance' ('PPI'), also known as 'credit insurance',\n'credit protection insurance', or 'loan repayment insurance', is an insurance\nproduct that enables consumers to insure repayment of loans if the borrower\ndies, becomes ill or disabled, loses a job, or faces other circumstances that\nmay prevent them from earning income to service the debt. It is not to be\nconfused with income protection insurance, which is not specific to a debt but\ncovers any income. PPI is widely sold by banks and other credit providers as an\nadd-on to the loan or overdraft product.\n\nCredit insurance can be purchased to insure all kinds of consumer loans\nincluding car loans, loans from finance companies, and home mortgage\nborrowing. Credit card agreements may include a form of PPI cover as\nstandard. Policies are also available to cover specific categories of risk,\ne.g. 'credit life insurance', 'credit disability insurance', and 'credit\naccident insurance'.

After this point the borrower must find other means to\nrepay the debt, though the period covered by insurance is typically long enough\nfor most people to start working again and earn enough to service their debt.\nPPI is different from other types of insurance such as home insurance, in that\nit can be quite difficult to determine if it is right for a person or not.\nCareful assessment of what would happen if a person became unemployed would need\nto be considered, as payments in lieu of notice (for example) may render a claim\nineligible despite the insured person being genuinely unemployed. In this case,\nthe approach taken by PPI insurers is consistent with that taken by the Benefits\nAgency in respect of unemployment benefits.\n","linknr":194,"url":"Payment_protection_insurance","recorded":1362670411,"links":28,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.competition-commission.org.uk/inquiries/ref2010/ppi_remittal/pdf/PPI_Market_Investigation_Order_(2011).pdf","http://www.oft.gov.uk/shared_oft/super-complaints/oft825.pdf"],"categories":["Types of insurance","Mortgage","Payments|Protection insurance"],"headings":["Controversy","Calculations","PPI claims","Statistics","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Ambox_globe_content.svg/48px-Ambox_globe_content.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg/20px-Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Income_protection_insurance","Credit_card","Home_insurance","Unemployment_benefit","Financial_Services_Authority","Alliance_and_Leicester","Capital_One","Egg_Banking","Bank_charge","Financial_Ombudsman_Service","Which?","Insurance_contract","Citizens_Advice_Bureau","Claims_management_company","Lloyds_Bank","Mortgage_insurance","Lenders_mortgage_insurance"]}
