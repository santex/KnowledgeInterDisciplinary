Located in the northern part of the continent, it extends from the\nAtlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean. Canada is the\nworld's second-largest country by total area, and its common border with the\nUnited States is the world's longest land border.\n\nThe land that is now Canada has been inhabited for millennia by various\nAboriginal peoples. Beginning in the late 15th century, British and French\ncolonial expeditions explored, and later settled, the region's Atlantic coast.\nFrance ceded nearly all of its colonies in North America to Britain in 1763\nafter the Seven Years' War. In 1867, with the union of three British North\nAmerican colonies through Confederation, Canada was formed as a federal dominion\nof four provinces. This began an accretion of provinces and territories and a\nprocess of increasing autonomy, culminating in the Canada Act 1982.\n\nCanada is a federal state governed as a parliamentary democracy and a\nconstitutional monarchy, with Queen Elizabeth II as its head of state. The\ncountry is officially bilingual and multicultural at the federal level, with a\npopulation of approximately 35 million as of 2013. Canada's advanced economy is\none of the largest in the world, relying chiefly upon its abundant natural\nresources and well-developed trade networks, especially with the United States,\nwith which it has had a long and complex relationship.\n\nCanada is one of the world's most developed nations, with the ninth highest per\ncapita income globally, and the sixth highest ranking in human development.\nSubsequently, Canada ranks among the highest in international measurements of\neducation, government transparency, civil liberties, quality of life, and\neconomic freedom. Canada is a recognized middle power and a member of many\ninternational institutions, including the G7, G8, G20, NATO, NAFTA, OECD, WTO,\nCommonwealth of Nations, Francophonie, OAS, APEC, and the United Nations.
