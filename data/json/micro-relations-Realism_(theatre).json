{"cursor":"3048","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Realism' was a general movement in 19th-century theatre that developed a set of\ndramatic and theatrical conventions with the aim of bringing a greater fidelity\nof real life to texts and performances. It shared many stylistic choices with\nnaturalism, including a focus on everyday (middle-class) drama, colloquial\nspeech, and mundane settings. Realism and naturalism diverge chiefly on the\ndegree of choice that characters have: while naturalism believes in the overall\nstrength of external forces over internal decisions, realism asserts the power\nof the individual to choose (see A Doll's House).\n\nRussia's first professional playwright, Aleksey Pisemsky, and Leo Tolstoy ([[The\nPower of Darkness]] (1886)), began a tradition of psychological realism in\nRussia which culminated with the establishment of the Moscow Art Theatre by\nConstantin Stanislavski and Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko. Brockett and\nHildy (2003, 370, 372) and Benedetti (2005, 100) and (1999, 14-17). Their\nground-breaking productions of the plays of Anton Chekhov in turn influenced\nMaxim Gorky and Mikhail Bulgakov. Stanislavski went on to develop his 'system',\na form of actor training that is particularly suited to psychological realism.\n\n19th-century realism is closely connected to the development of modern drama,\nwhich, as Martin Harrison explains, \"is usually said to have begun in the early\n1870s\" with the \"middle-period\" work of the Norwegian dramatist Henrik Ibsen.\nIbsen's realistic drama in prose has been \"enormously influential.\" Harrison\n(1998, 160).\n\nIn opera, [[verismo]] refers to a post-Romantic Italian tradition that sought\nincorporate the naturalism of Ãmile Zola and Henrik Ibsen. It included realistic\nâ sometimes sordid or violent â depictions of contemporary everyday life,\nespecially the life of the lower classes.\n","linknr":118,"url":"Realism_(theatre)","recorded":1362580585,"links":13,"instances":["arts","theatre"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Drama","Theatrical genres","19th-century theatre","20th-century theatre","Realism (art movement)| Theatre"],"headings":["See also","Notes","Sources"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["naturalism","theatre"],["naturalism","theatre"],["realism","arts"]],"members":["realism","naturalism"],"related":["Art_movement","Nineteenth-century_theatre","Dramatic_convention","Naturalism_(theatre)","A_Doll's_House","Aleksey_Pisemsky","Leo_Tolstoy","Moscow_Art_Theatre","Constantin_Stanislavski","Vladimir_Nemirovich-Danchenko","Anton_Chekhov","Maxim_Gorky","Mikhail_Bulgakov","Constantin_Stanislavski","Stanislavski's_'system'","Henrik_Ibsen","Opera","Naturalism_(theatre)","Realism_(arts)","Socialist_realism","Chanson_réaliste","Constantin_Stanislavski"]}
