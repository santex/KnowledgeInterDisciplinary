Some constellation families are named after their most\nimportant constellation within the group. Some others are named after the\nzodiac or themed on mythological regions; \"Heavenly\nWaters\" is a more recent grouping. Astronomers Nicolas Louis de Lacaille and\nJohann Bayer, who invented the constellations in the southern sky, contributed\nas well. There are eight modern constellation families: Ursa Major, the Zodiac,\nPerseus, Hercules, Orion, Heavenly Waters, Bayer, and La Caille. All\nare based on ancient collections of constellations. The Ancient\nEgyptians had a particular area of the sky with several separately identified\nconstellations collectively known, celestially speaking (not just the\nunderworld), as the [[Duat]].\n","linknr":309,"url":"La_Caille_Family","recorded":1362560947,"links":16,"instances":["constellation","constellation","constellation","constellation","constellation","constellation","constellation","constellation","constellation","constellation","constellation","constellation","constellation","constellation","constellation","constellation","constellation","constellation","constellation","constellation","constellation","constellation","constellation","constellation","constellation","constellation","constellation","astronomy","constellation","constellation","constellation","constellation","constellation","constellation","constellation","constellation","constellation","constellation","constellation","constellation","constellation","constellation"],"pdf":["http://www.iucaa.ernet.in/~scipop/Literature/fieldguide.pdf","http://www.iucaa.ernet.in/~scipop/Literature/fieldguide.pdf"],"categories":["Constellations|"],"headings":["Ursa
