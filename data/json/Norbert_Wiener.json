He was Professor of Mathematics at MIT.\n\nA famous child prodigy, Wiener later became an early researcher in stochastic\nand noise processes, contributing work relevant to electronic engineering,\nelectronic communication, and control systems.\n\nWiener is regarded as the originator of cybernetics, a formalization of the\nnotion of feedback, with many implications for engineering, systems control,\ncomputer science, biology, philosophy, and the organization of society.\n","linknr":1097,"url":"Norbert_Wiener","recorded":1362476896,"links":77,"instances":["moon","signal_processing","mathematics","botanist","crater"],"pdf":["http://web.comlab.ox.ac.uk/oucl/research/areas/ieg/e-library/bynum.pdf","http://web.comlab.ox.ac.uk/oucl/research/areas/ieg/e-library/bynum.pdf"],"categories":["1894
