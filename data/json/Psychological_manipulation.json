{"cursor":"20845","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Psychological manipulation' is a type of social influence that aims to change\nthe perception or behavior of others through underhanded, deceptive, or even\nabusive tactics. By advancing the interests of the\nmanipulator, often at the other's expense, such methods could be considered\nexploitative, abusive, devious, and deceptive. Social influence is not\nnecessarily negative. For example, doctors can try to persuade patients to\nchange unhealthy habits. Social influence is generally perceived to be harmless\nwhen it respects the right of the influenced to accept or reject and is not\nunduly coercive. Depending on the context and motivations, social influence may\nconstitute underhanded manipulation.\n","linknr":754,"url":"Psychological_manipulation","recorded":1362574558,"links":44,"instances":["ethics","emotion","social_sciences","psychological","psychology","psychology","public_relations","psychology","philosophy","security","emotion"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Psychological manipulation|","Behavioral and social facets of systemic risk","Bullying","Diversionary tactics","Deception","Human behavior","Mind control","Psychological abuse","Psychopathy","Social psychology"],"headings":["Requirements for successful manipulation","How manipulators control their victims","Vulnerabilities exploited by manipulators","Motivations of manipulators","Psychological conditions of manipulators","Basic manipulative strategy of a psychopath","See also","References","Other references"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/Unbalanced_scales.svg/45px-Unbalanced_scales.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["punishment","psychology"],["guilt","emotion"],["rationalization","psychology"],["spin","public_relations"],["minimisation","psychology"],["evasion","ethics"],["guilt","emotion"],["trust","social_sciences"],["rage","emotion"],["maturity","psychological"],["power","philosophy"],["social_engineering","political_science"],["social_engineering","security"],["spin","public_relations"]],"members":["evasion","guilt","trust","maturity","punishment","minimisation","spin","rationalization","power","social_engineering","rage"],"related":["Social_influence","Perception","Deceptive","Abuse","Exploitative","Social_influence","Persuade","George_K._Simon","Aggression","Vulnerabilities","Relational_aggression","Passive_aggressive","Harriet_Braiker","Praise","Superficial_charm","Sympathy","Crocodile_tears","Punishment_(psychology)","Profanity","Emotional_blackmail","Guilt_(emotion)","Classical_conditioning","Lie","Psychopaths","Cheating","Propaganda","Denial","Rationalization_(psychology)","Spin_(public_relations)","Minimisation_(psychology)","Attention","Distraction","Evasion_(ethics)","Weasel_words","Intimidation","Guilt_(emotion)","Conscientious","Doubt","Anxious","Submissive","Shaming","Sarcasm","Fear","Doubt","Pity","Sympathy","Compassion","Victim_blaming","Authority_figure","Seduction","Superficial_charm","Praise","Flattery","Trust_(social_sciences)","Loyalty","Psychological_projection","Blame","Scapegoats","Innocence","Judgment","Confusion","Anger","Rage_(emotion)","Assertiveness","Personal_boundaries","Self-sufficiency","Locus_of_control","In_denial","Conscientiousness","Confidence","Doubt","Assertiveness","Intellectualization","Codependent","Submissive","Psychopathic","Dependent_personality_disorder","Maturity_(psychological)","Naïve","Weak_mindedness","Superficial_charm","Trusting","Loneliness","Narcissistic","Impulsivity","Altruistic","Frugal","Materialistic","Loan_sharks","Get-rich-quick","Greed","Masochistic_personality_disorder","Elderly","Elder_abuse","Power_(philosophy)","Control_freak","Self-esteem","Machiavellianism","Narcissistic_personality_disorder","Paranoid_personality_disorder","Borderline_personality_disorder","Dependent_personality_disorder","Histrionic_personality_disorder","Passive–aggressive_behavior","Type_A_and_Type_B_personality_theory","Antisocial_personality_disorder","Behavioral_addiction","Robert_D._Hare","Paul_Babiak","Psychopaths","Opportunism","Aggressive","Persona","Advertising","Appeal_to_emotion","Brainwashing","Bullying","Culture_of_fear","Coercion","Coercive_persuasion","Common_sense","Confidence_trick","Critical_thinking","Crowd_manipulation","Demagogy","Dirty_tricks","Discrediting_tactic","Dissimulation","Dumbing_down","Emotional_blackmail","Enabling","Fallacy","Fear_mongering","Fraud","Gaslighting","Half-truth","Interrogation","List_of_confidence_tricks","List_of_fallacies","Martyrdom_video","Media_manipulation","Mind_control","Personal_boundaries","Persuasion","Propaganda","Psychological_abuse","Rhetoric","Shame","Sheeple","Shills","Smear_campaign","Social_engineering_(political_science)","Social_engineering_(security)","Social_influence","Sophistry","Spin_(public_relations)","Subliminal_stimuli","Victim_blaming","Victimology","Weasel_words","Whispering_campaign","Workplace_bullying","Jacques_Ellul","David_Buss"]}
