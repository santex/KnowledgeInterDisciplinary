[http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/second.html\nInternational System of Units from NIST] accessed 25 March 2012. Between 1960 and 1967, it was defined in terms of the period of the\nEarth's orbit around the Sun in 1900, {{cite web\n | title=Leap Seconds publisher=Time Service Department, United States Naval\n | Observatory url=http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/leapsec.html accessdate=2012-03-\n | 24}}\n but it is now defined more precisely in atomic terms. Seconds may be\nmeasured using mechanical, electric or atomic clocks.\n\nAstronomical observations of the 19th and 20th centuries revealed that the mean\nsolar day is slowly but measurably lengthening and the length of a tropical year\nis not entirely predictable either; thus the sunâearth motion is no longer\nconsidered a suitable basis for definition. With the advent of atomic clocks, it\nbecame feasible to define the second based on fundamental properties of nature.\nSince 1967, the second has been defined to be:\n\n periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two\n hyperfine levels of the ground state of the caesium 133 atom. }}\n\nSI prefixes are frequently combined with the word second to denote subdivisions\nof the second, e.g., the millisecond (one thousandth of a second), the\nmicrosecond (one millionth of a second), and the nanosecond (one billionth of a\nsecond). Though SI prefixes may also be used to form multiples of the second\nsuch as kilosecond (one thousand seconds), such units are rarely used in\npractice. The more common larger non-SI units of time are not formed by powers\nof ten; instead, the second is multiplied by 60 to form a minute, which is\nmultiplied by 60 to form an hour, which is multiplied by 24 to form a day.\n\nThe second is also the base unit of time in the centimetre-gram-second, metre-kilogram-\nsecond, metre-tonne-second, and foot-pound-second systems of units.\n","linknr":856,"url":"Second","recorded":1362485666,"links":148,"instances":["astronomy","united_kingdom","radio_station","clockmaker"],"pdf":["http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP330/sp330.pdf","http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP330/sp330.pdf","http://www.leapsecond.com/history/1958-PhysRev-v1-n3-Markowitz-Hall-Essen-Parry.pdf","http://www.leapsecond.com/history/1958-PhysRev-v1-n3-Markowitz-Hall-Essen-Parry.pdf","http://www.leapsecond.com/history/1968-Metrologia-v4-n4-Essen.pdf","http://www.leapsecond.com/history/1968-Metrologia-v4-n4-Essen.pdf","http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/time/metrologia-leapsecond.pdf","http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/time/metrologia-leapsecond.pdf","http://resource.npl.co.uk/docs/networks/time/meeting3/klein.pdf","http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/time/metrologia-leapsecond.pdf"],"categories":["Centimetre–gram–second
