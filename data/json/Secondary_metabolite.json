{"cursor":"4491","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Secondary metabolites' are organic compounds that are not directly involved in\nthe normal growth, development, or reproduction of an organism. Unlike primary metabolites, absence of secondary\nmetabolites does not result in immediate death, but rather in long-term\nimpairment of the organism's survivability, fecundity, or aesthetics, or perhaps\nin no significant change at all. Secondary metabolites are often restricted to a\nnarrow set of species within a phylogenetic group.  Secondary\nmetabolites often play an important role in plant defense against herbivory and other interspecies defenses. Humans use secondary\nmetabolites as medicines, flavorings, and recreational drugs.\n","linknr":213,"url":"Secondary_metabolite","recorded":1362373139,"links":29,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Plant physiology","Metabolism"],"headings":["Categories","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Organic_compound","Cell_growth","Biological_development","Reproduction","Primary_metabolite","Survivability","Fecundity","Phylogenetic","Plant_defense_against_herbivory","Hyoscyamine","Atropine","Deadly_nightshade","Cocaine","Coca","Scopolamine","Codeine","Morphine","Opium_poppy","Tetrodotoxin","Fugu","Salamanders","Vincristine","Vinblastine","Mitotic_inhibitor","Rosy_Periwinkle","Terpene","Oligomerization","Azadirachtin","Neem","Artemisinin","Tetrahydrocannabinol","Nojirimycin","Resveratrol","Phytoalexins","Erythromycin","Discodermolide","Phloroglucinol","Vancomycin","Thiostrepton","Ramoplanin","Teicoplanin","Gramicidin","Bacitracin","Epothilone","Polyphenol","Secondary_metabolism","Hairy_root_culture"]}
