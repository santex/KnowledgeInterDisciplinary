He\n succeeded his father John VI on the Neapolitan throne in 1120 or 1123 at a time\n when Roger II of Sicily was rising rapidly in power. When Roger succeeded as\n duke of Apulia in 1127 and was crowned king in 1130, the fate of Naples hinged\n on Sergius' relations with the Sicilian court.\n\nIn 1131, Roger demanded from the citizens of Amalfi the defences of their city\nand the keys to their castle. When the citizens refused, Sergius initially\nprepared to aid them with a fleet, but the Admiral George of Antioch blockaded\nthe port city with a larger fleet and Sergius submitted to Roger. According to\nthe chronicler Alexander of Telese, Naples \"which, since Roman times, had hardly\never been conquered by the sword now submitted to Roger on the strength of a\nmere report.\" Sergius' prestige was not high and all of southern Italy was now\nin Roger's hands.\n\nIn 1134, Sergius supported the rebellion of Robert II of Capua and Ranulf II of\nAlife, but avoided any direct confrontation with Roger. After the fall of Capua,\nhe did homage to the king. But the next year, on 24 April 1135, a Pisan fleet\nunder the exiled Robert of Capua laid anchor in Naples. Carrying 8,000\nreinforcements, the fleet increased rebel morale and soon a full-scale revolt\nhad recommenced. Sergius had to welcome Ranulf, who was in the same position as\nhe: in revolt against the king to whom he had so recently sworn fealty. The\nrebel leaders—Robert, Ranulf, and Sergius—were besieged in Naples\nuntil Spring 1136. By then, many people were dying of starvation. Yet according\nto the historian and rebel sympathiser Falco of Benevento, Sergius and the\nNeapolitans did not relent, \"preferring to die of hunger than to bare their\nnecks to the power of an evil King.\" The naval blockade of Naples, however, had\nholes and Sergius was able to slip by to Pisa for more supplies and on another\noccasion Robert did the same. A relief army, commanded by none other than the\nEmperor Lothair II himself, however, was coming to Naples' rescue and Roger\nlifted the siege.\n\nLothair left quickly after conquering nearly the whole of the Mezzogiorno, and\nso Roger was able to retake his lost possessions. Sergius again kneeled before\nhim in homage, trying to spare his city another siege. Sergius was forgiven and\naccompanied Roger on an expedition against his erstwhile ally Ranulf, now duke\nof Apulia. On October 30, at the Battle of Rignano, he and Roger II, as well as\nRoger's son, were defeated, Sergius himself dying on the field.\n\nIronically enough, Roger's defeat in Rignano opened the field to his conquest of\nNaples itself, since Sergius VII died heirless and Naples' nobility couldn't\nreach an agreement as to who would succeed as duke. Roger finally absorbed the\nDuchy of Naples into his new kingdom in 1139, when the pope, Innocent II, and\nthe Neapolitan nobility acknowledged the young Alfonso of Hauteville as duke.\n","linknr":110,"url":"Sergius_VII_of_Naples","recorded":1375069060,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Sergius_VII_of_Naples&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Sergius_VII_of_Naples&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Southern_Italy_1112.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Southern_Italy_1112.svg/350px-Southern_Italy_1112.svg.png","/wiki/File:Southern_Italy_1112.svg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Common_Era","/wiki/Dux","/wiki/Magister_militum","/wiki/Duke_of_Naples","/wiki/John_VI_of_Naples","/wiki/Roger_II_of_Sicily","/wiki/Duke_of_Apulia","/wiki/Amalfi","/wiki/George_of_Antioch","/wiki/Alexander_of_Telese","/wiki/Southern_Italy","/wiki/Robert_II_of_Capua","/wiki/Ranulf_II_of_Alife","/wiki/Pisa","/wiki/Falco_of_Benevento","/wiki/Emperor_Lothair_II","/wiki/Mezzogiorno","/wiki/Battle_of_Rignano","/wiki/Duchy_of_Naples","/wiki/Pope","/wiki/Innocent_II","/wiki/Alfonso_of_Hauteville","/w/index.php?title=Sergius_VII_of_Naples&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/John_Julius_Norwich","/wiki/London","http://www.leeds.ac.uk/history/weblearning/MedievalHistoryTextCentre/Telese%202.doc","/wiki/John_VI_of_Naples","/wiki/Duke_of_Naples","/wiki/Alfonso_of_Hauteville","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sergius_VII_of_Naples&oldid=562285594","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1137_deaths","/wiki/Category:Dukes_of_Naples","/wiki/Category:Year_of_birth_unknown","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Sergius+VII+of+Naples&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Sergius+VII+of+Naples","/wiki/Sergius_VII_of_Naples","/wiki/Talk:Sergius_VII_of_Naples","#","/wiki/Sergius_VII_of_Naples","/w/index.php?title=Sergius_VII_of_Naples&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Sergius_VII_of_Naples&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Sergius_VII_of_Naples","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Sergius_VII_of_Naples","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Sergius_VII_of_Naples&oldid=562285594","/w/index.php?title=Sergius_VII_of_Naples&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1581993","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Sergius_VII_of_Naples&id=562285594","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Sergius+VII+of+Naples","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Sergius+VII+of+Naples&oldid=562285594&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Sergius_VII_of_Naples&printable=yes","//ar.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D8%B3%D8%B1%D8%AC%D9%8A%D9%88%D8%B3_%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D8%A7%D8%A8%D8%B9_%D9%85%D9%86_%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%A8%D9%88%D9%84%D9%8A","//es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_VII_de_N%C3%A1poles","//it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_VII_di_Napoli","//ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergiu_al_VII-lea_de_Neapole","//ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A1%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B3%D0%B8%D0%B9_VII_(%D0%B3%D0%B5%D1%80%D1%86%D0%BE%D0%B3_%D0%9D%D0%B5%D0%B0%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%BB%D1%8F)","//sh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_VII_od_Napulja","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1581993#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergius_VII_of_Naples","//wikimediafoundation.org/","/
