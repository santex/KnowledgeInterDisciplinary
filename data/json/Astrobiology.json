{"cursor":"87140","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n may not be the only biomolecules in the Universe capable of coding for life\n processes. ]]\n\n'Astrobiology' is the study of the origin, evolution, distribution, and future\nof life in the universe: extraterrestrial life and life on Earth. This\ninterdisciplinary field encompasses the search for habitable environments in our\nSolar System and habitable planets outside our Solar System, the search for\nevidence of prebiotic chemistry, laboratory and field research into the origins\nand early evolution of life on Earth, and studies of the potential for life to\nadapt to challenges on Earth and in outer space.  Astrobiology\naddresses the question of whether life exists beyond Earth, and how humans can\ndetect it if it does. (The term 'exobiology' is similar\nbut more specific â it covers the search for life beyond Earth, and the effects\nof extraterrestrial environments on living things.) [http://www.merriam-\nwebster.com/dictionary/exobiologists Mirriam Webster Dictionary entry\n\"Exobiologists\"] (accessed 16 April 2011)\n\nAstrobiology makes use of physics, chemistry, astronomy, biology, molecular\nbiology, ecology, planetary science, geography, and geology to investigate the\npossibility of life on other worlds and help recognize biospheres that might be\ndifferent from the biosphere on\nEarth. [http://www.itwire.com.au/content/view/11647/1066/ iTWire -\nScientists will look for alien life, but Where and How?]\nAstrobiology concerns itself with interpretation of existing scientific data;\ngiven more detailed and reliable data from other parts of the universe, the\nroots of astrobiology itselfâphysics, chemistry and biologyâmay have their\ntheoretical bases challenged. Although speculation is entertained to give\ncontext, astrobiology concerns itself primarily with hypotheses that fit firmly\ninto existing scientific theories.\n\nEarth is the only place in the universe known to harbor\nlife. }} However, recent advances in planetary science have\nchanged fundamental assumptions about the possibility of life in the universe,\nraising the estimates of habitable zones around other stars and the search for\nextraterrestrial microbial life. The possibility of life on Mars,\neither currently or in the past, is an active area of research.\n\nIn a National Institutes of Health study, the authors hypothesize that if\nbiological complexity increased exponentially during evolution, life in the\nuniverse may have begun \"10 billion years ago\" -\nmore than 5 billion years before the Earth existed.\n","linknr":1616,"url":"Astrobiology","recorded":1362508987,"links":119,"instances":["moon","spacecraft","seti","ecology","planet","mathematician","moon","geology","spacecraft","crater","scientist","esa","moon","spacecraft","space_exploration","environmental","astronomy"],"pdf":["http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19900013148_1990013148.pdf","http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19900013148_1990013148.pdf","http://www.eso.org/public/archives/releases/sciencepapers/eso1234/eso1234a.pdf","http://www.eso.org/public/archives/releases/sciencepapers/eso1234/eso1234a.pdf","http://www.astro-ecology.com/PDFBioresourcesIcarus2002Paper.pdf","http://www.astro-ecology.com/PDFBioresourcesIcarus2002Paper.pdf","http://www.astro-ecology.com/PDFBioresourcesIcarus2002Paper.pdf","http://www.astro-ecology.com/PDFBioresourcesIcarus2002Paper.pdf","http://www.astro-ecology.com/PDFCosmologyJBIS2005Paper.pdf","http://www.astro-ecology.com/PDFCosmologyJBIS2005Paper.pdf","http://www.astro-ecology.com/PDFSeedingtheUniverse2005Book.pdf","http://www.astro-ecology.com/PDFSeedingtheUniverse2005Book.pdf","http://media.egu2012.eu/media/filer_public/2012/04/05/10_solarsystem_devera.pdf","http://media.egu2012.eu/media/filer_public/2012/04/05/10_solarsystem_devera.pdf","http://science.nasa.gov/media/medialibrary/2012/01/23/NAC_Science_Meeting_ReportOctober_31-November_1_2011-finalTAGGED.pdf","http://science.nasa.gov/media/medialibrary/2012/01/23/NAC_Science_Meeting_ReportOctober_31-November_1_2011-finalTAGGED.pdf","http://www.astro-ecology.com/PDFSeedingtheUniverse2005Book.pdf","http://www.astro-ecology.com/PDFSeedingtheUniverse2005Book.pdf"],"categories":["Astrobiology","Extraterrestrial
