Each ring represents one year; the outside rings, near the bark, are\nthe youngest.]] 'Dendrochronology' (from , dendron, \"tree limb\"; , khronos,\n\"time\"; and , [[wiktionary:-logia|-logia]]) or 'tree-ring dating' is the\nscientific method of dating based on the analysis of patterns of 'tree rings',\nalso known as 'growth rings'. Dendrochronology can date the time at which tree\nrings were formed, in many types of wood, to the exact calendar year. This has\nthree main areas of application: paleoecology, where it is used to determine\ncertain aspects of past ecologies (most prominently climate); archaeology, where\nit is used to date old buildings, etc.; and radiocarbon dating, where it is used\nto calibrate radiocarbon ages (see below).\n\nIn some areas of the world, it is possible to date wood back a few thousand\nyears, or even many thousands. Currently, the maximum for fully anchored\nchronologies is a little over 11,000 years from present.\n","linknr":524,"url":"Tree_ring","recorded":1362373113,"links":62,"instances":["botany","geometry","california"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Archaeological sub-disciplines","Dating methods","Geochronology","Incremental dating","Dendrology","American inventions","Forestry","Art history","Conservation and restoration"],"headings":["History","Growth rings","Sampling and dating","Applications","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0c/Dendrochronological_drill_hg.jpg/240px-Dendrochronological_drill_hg.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7d/Tree.ring.arp.jpg/240px-Tree.ring.arp.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/22/Pinus_taeda_crossx7358.JPG/240px-Pinus_taeda_crossx7358.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/12px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg/16px-Portal-puzzle.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cross_section","geometry"],["trunk","botany"],["white_mountains","california"],["fairbanks_house","dedham,_massachusetts"]],"members":["trunk","cross_section","fairbanks_house","white_mountains"],"related":["Paleoecology","Ecology","Archaeology","Radiocarbon_dating","A._E._Douglass","Laboratory_of_Tree-Ring_Research","University_of_Arizona","Cross_section_(geometry)","Trunk_(botany)","Tree","Vascular_cambium","Bark","Lateral_meristem","Secondary_growth","Season","Temperate_zone","Cheraw,_South_Carolina","Canada","Mediterranean_region","Tree","Year_Without_a_Summer","Main_River","Rhine_River","Southwestern_United_States","White_Mountains_(California)","Before_Present","Rock_strata","Native_Americans_in_the_United_States","Calibration","Radiocarbon_dating","Before_present","Bristlecone_pine","Species","Ant","Tree","Ice_core","Varve","Sediment","Cactus","Acanthochronology","Black_Death","Mike_Baillie","Climate","Weather","Rain","Temperature","Soil_pH","Plant_nutrition","Panel_painting","Early_Netherlandish_painting","Vistula","Hanseatic_League","Radius","Terminus_post_quem","Fairbanks_House_(Dedham,_Massachusetts)","Baumkuchen","Dendroclimatology","Dendroarchaeology","Dendrology","Paleoclimatology","Post_excavation","Varve","Timeline_of_dendrochronology_timestamp_events","Sclerochronology","Acanthochronology","Herbchronology"]}
