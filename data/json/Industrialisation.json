It is a part of a wider modernisation process, where social\nchange and economic development are closely related with technological\ninnovation, particularly with the development of large-scale energy and\nmetallurgy production. It is the extensive organisation of an economy for the\npurpose of manufacturing.\n\nIndustrialisation also introduces a form of philosophical change where people\nobtain a different attitude towards their perception of nature, and a\nsociological process of ubiquitous rationalisation.\n\nThere is considerable literature on the factors facilitating industrial\nmodernisation and enterprise development.
