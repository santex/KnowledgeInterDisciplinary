It was\nestablished on 7 April 1948, with headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland, and is a\nmember of the United Nations Development Group. Its predecessor, the Health\nOrganization, was an agency of the League of Nations.\n\nThe constitution of the World Health Organization had been signed by all 61\ncountries of the United Nations by 22 July 1946, with the first meeting of the\nWorld Health Assembly finishing on 24 July 1948. It incorporated the Office\nInternational d'HygiÃ¨ne Publique and the League of Nations Health Organization.\nSince its creation, WHO has been responsible for playing a leading role in the\neradication of smallpox. Its current priorities include communicable diseases,\nin particular, HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis; the mitigation of the effects\nof non-communicable diseases; sexual and reproductive health, development, and\naging; nutrition, food security and healthy eating; occupational health;\nsubstance abuse; and drive the development of reporting, publications, and\nnetworking. WHO is responsible for the [[World Health Report]], a leading\ninternational publication on health, the worldwide World Health Survey, and\nWorld Health Day (7th-April of every Year).\n\nIts links with the International Atomic Energy Agency and distribution of\ncontraception have both proved controversial, as have guidelines on healthy\neating and the 2009 flu pandemic.\n","linknr":1214,"url":"World_Health_Organization","recorded":1362482074,"links":198,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://whqlibdoc.who.int/hist/chronicles/health_org_1931.pdf","http://whqlibdoc.who.int/hist/chronicles/health_org_1931.pdf","http://whqlibdoc.who.int/hist/chronicles/chronicle_1947.pdf","http://whqlibdoc.who.int/hist/chronicles/chronicle_1947.pdf","http://www.who.int/who60/media/exhibition_brochure.pdf","http://www.who.int/who60/media/exhibition_brochure.pdf","http://whqlibdoc.who.int/smallpox/9241561106_chp9.pdf","http://whqlibdoc.who.int/smallpox/9241561106_chp9.pdf","http://www1.szu.cz/svi/cejph/archiv/2010-1-10-full.pdf","http://www1.szu.cz/svi/cejph/archiv/2010-1-10-full.pdf","http://www1.szu.cz/svi/cejph/archiv/2010-1-11-full.pdf","http://www1.szu.cz/svi/cejph/archiv/2010-1-11-full.pdf","http://whqlibdoc.who.int/hq/1998/WHD_98.1-13.pdf","http://whqlibdoc.who.int/hq/1998/WHD_98.1-13.pdf","http://www.who.int/entity/governance/eb/who_constitution_en.pdf","http://www.who.int/entity/governance/eb/who_constitution_en.pdf","http://whqlibdoc.who.int/pb/2012-2013/PB_2012%E2%80%932013_eng.pdf","http://whqlibdoc.who.int/pb/2012-2013/PB_2012%E2%80%932013_eng.pdf","http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2011/9789241501651_eng.pdf","http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2011/9789241501651_eng.pdf","http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2011/9789241501651_eng.pdf","http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2011/9789241501651_eng.pdf","http://www.who.int/topics/millennium_development_goals/MDG-NHPS_brochure_2010.pdf","http://www.who.int/topics/millennium_development_goals/MDG-NHPS_brochure_2010.pdf","http://www.who.int/mental_health/media/en/76.pdf","http://www.who.int/mental_health/media/en/76.pdf","http://www.who.int/classifications/en/FamilyDocument2007.pdf","http://www.who.int/classifications/en/FamilyDocument2007.pdf","http://www.who.int/hrh/migration/code/WHO_global_code_of_practice_EN.pdf","http://www.who.int/hrh/migration/code/WHO_global_code_of_practice_EN.pdf","http://apps.who.int/gb/bd/PDF/bd47/EN/members-en.pdf","http://apps.who.int/gb/bd/PDF/bd47/EN/members-en.pdf","http://apps.who.int/gb/archive/pdf_files/WHA52/ew2.pdf","http://apps.who.int/gb/archive/pdf_files/WHA52/ew2.pdf","http://www.who.int/about/resources_planning/2012_2013_AC_summary.pdf","http://www.who.int/about/resources_planning/2012_2013_AC_summary.pdf","http://whqlibdoc.who.int/pb/2012-2013/PB_2012%E2%80%932013_eng.pdf","http://whqlibdoc.who.int/pb/2012-2013/PB_2012%E2%80%932013_eng.pdf","http://www.who.int/civilsociety/documents/en/RevreportE.pdf","http://www.who.int/civilsociety/documents/en/RevreportE.pdf","http://www.who.int/civilsociety/documents/en/RevreportE.pdf","http://www.who.int/civilsociety/documents/en/RevreportE.pdf","http://apps.who.int/gb/bd/PDF/bd47/EN/agreements-with-other-inter-en.pdf","http://apps.who.int/gb/bd/PDF/bd47/EN/agreements-with-other-inter-en.pdf","http://www.ippnw-europe.org/commonFiles/pdfs/Atomenergie/appeal_healthprofessionals.pdf","http://www.ippnw-europe.org/commonFiles/pdfs/Atomenergie/appeal_healthprofessionals.pdf","http://www.wecf.eu/download/2010/04/letterIAEA-WHO.pdf","http://www.wecf.eu/download/2010/04/letterIAEA-WHO.pdf","http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/81/8/editorial2.pdf","http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/81/8/editorial2.pdf","http://www.evm-vaccines.org/IMG/pdf/Lessons_from_pandemic_influenza.pdf"],"categories":["Global
