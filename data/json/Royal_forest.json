{"cursor":"28637","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"]] A 'royal forest' is an area of land with different meanings in England, Wales\nand Scotland; the term forest does not mean forest as it is understood today, as\nan area of densely wooded land. There are also differing and contextual\ninterpretations in Continental Europe derived from the Carolingian and\nMerovingian legal systems.  Philippe Braunstein, Â« ForÃªts d'Europe au Moyen-\nÃge Â», Les Cahiers du Centre de Recherches Historiques [En ligne], 6 | 1990, mis\nen ligne le 20 mars 2009, consultÃ© le 22 aoÃ»t 2012.

H. R. Loyn, Anglo-Saxon England and the Norman Conquest 2nd ed. 1991:378-\n82. Historians find no evidence of the Anglo-Saxon monarchs (c.500 to\n1066) creating forests. The Dialogue Concerning the Exchequer. c. 1180\nhttp://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/medieval/excheq.htm  However, under the\nNorman kings (after 1066), by royal prerogative forest law was widely\napplied. The law was designed to protect the venison and the vert,\nthe \"noble\" animals of the chase â notably red and fallow deer, the roe,\nand the wild boar â and the greenery that sustained them. Forests were\ndesigned as hunting areas reserved for the monarch or (by invitation) the\naristocracy (see medieval hunting). The concept was introduced by the Normans to\nEngland in the 11th century, and at the height of this practice in the late 12th\nand early 13th centuries, fully one-third of the land area of southern England\nwas designated as royal forest; at one stage in the 12th century, all of Essex\nwas afforested, and on his accession Henry II declared all of Huntingdonshire\nforest.\n\nAfforestation, in particular the creation of the New Forest, figured large in\nthe folk history of the \"Norman Yoke\", which magnified what was already a grave\nsocial ill: \"the picture of prosperous settlements disrupted, houses burned,\npeasants evicted, all to serve the pleasure of the foreign tyrant, is a familiar\nelement in the English national story .... The extent and intensity of\nhardship and of depopulation have been exaggerated\", H. R. Loyn observed. Forest law prescribed harsh punishment for anyone who committed\nany of a range of offences within the forests; by the mid-17th century,\nenforcement of this law had died out, but many of England's woodlands still bear\nthe title Royal Forest. At that time, the practice of reserving areas of land\nfor the sole use of the aristocracy was common throughout Europe during the\nmedieval period.\n\nRoyal forests usually included large areas of heath, grassland and\nwetland â anywhere that supported deer and other game. In addition, when an\narea was initially designated forest, any villages, towns and fields that lay\nwithin it were also subject to forest law. This could foster resentment as the\nlocal inhabitants were then restricted in the use of land they had previously\nrelied upon for their livelihoods; however, common rights were not extinguished,\nbut merely curtailed.\n","linknr":313,"url":"Royal_forest","recorded":1372152424,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Royal_forest&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Royal_forest&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:NewForestPicnic.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/93/NewForestPicnic.jpg/220px-NewForestPicnic.jpg","/wiki/File:NewForestPicnic.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf5/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/New_Forest","/wiki/Forest","/wiki/Government_of_the_Carolingian_Empire","/wiki/Merovingian_dynasty","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Anglo-Saxon_England","#cite_note-Loyn-2","#cite_note-3","#cite_note-4","/wiki/Red_deer","/wiki/Fallow_deer","/wiki/Roe_deer","/wiki/Wild_boar","/wiki/Monarch","/wiki/Aristocracy","/wiki/Medieval_hunting","/wiki/Normans","/wiki/Essex","/wiki/Henry_II_of_England","/wiki/Huntingdonshire","#cite_note-Loyn-2","/wiki/New_Forest","/wiki/Norman_Yoke","/wiki/H._R._Loyn","#cite_note-Loyn-2","/wiki/Middle_Ages","/wiki/Heath_(habitat)","/wiki/Grassland","/wiki/Wetland","/wiki/Deer","/wiki/Game_(food)","#cite_note-5","#Forest_law","#Offences","#Rights_and_privileges","#Officers","#Courts","#History","#The_Great_Perambulation_and_after","#Disafforestation.2C_sale_of_forest_lands_and_the_Western_Rising","#After_the_Restoration","#Surviving_ancient_forests","#Forest_of_Dean","#Epping_Forest","#New_Forest","#Royal_forests_in_England","#See_also","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Royal_forest&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/William_I_of_England","/wiki/Common_law","/wiki/The_Rime_of_King_William","/wiki/Peterborough_Chronicle","/w/index.php?title=Royal_forest&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/John_Manwood","/wiki/Hart_(deer)","/wiki/Red_deer","/wiki/Red_deer","/wiki/Boar","/wiki/Hare","/wiki/Wolf","/wiki/Chase_(land)","/wiki/Deer","//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/doe#Noun","/wiki/Fallow_deer","/wiki/Fox","/wiki/Marten","/wiki/Roe_deer","/wiki/Warren_(free)","/wiki/Hare","/wiki/Rabbit","/wiki/Pheasant","/wiki/Partridge","#cite_note-manwood-6","/wiki/Inclosure","/wiki/Assarting","/wiki/Agistment","/wiki/Pannage","/wiki/Dog","/wiki/English_Mastiff","/wiki/Purlieus","/w/index.php?title=Royal_forest&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/Estovers","/wiki/Pannage","/wiki/Turbary","/wiki/Agistment","/wiki/Assart","/w/index.php?title=Purpresture&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Royal_forest&action=edit&section=4","/wiki/Justice_in_Eyre","/wiki/Verderer","/wiki/Forester","/wiki/Agister","/wiki/Forest_ranger","/wiki/Serjeanty","/wiki/Surveyor_(surveying)","/w/index.php?title=Royal_forest&action=edit&section=5","/wiki/Commentaries_on_the_Laws_of_England","/wiki/Attachment_(law)","/wiki/Agister","//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/swain","/wiki/Swine","/wiki/Justice_in_Eyre","/wiki/Forest_of_Dean","/wiki/First_Commissioner_of_Woods_and_Forests","/wiki/New_Forest","/w/index.php?title=Royal_forest&action=edit&section=6","/wiki/William_I_of_England","/wiki/Anglo-Saxon_Chronicle","/wiki/William_Rufus","http://www.constitution.org/sech/sech_035.htm","/wiki/Henry_II_of_England","/wiki/Magna_Carta","/wiki/Charter","/wiki/John_of_England","http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/magnacarta.html","/wiki/Henry_III_of_England","/wiki/Charter_of_the_Forest","/wiki/Edward_I_of_England","/w/index.php?title=Royal_forest&action=edit&section=7","/wiki/Henry_II_of_England","/wiki/Domesday_Book","/wiki/Richard_II_of_England","/wiki/Henry_VII_of_England","/wiki/Henry_VIII_of_England","/wiki/Court_of_Augmentations","/wiki/River_Trent","/w/index.php?title=Royal_forest&action=edit&section=8","/wiki/Western_Rising","/wiki/Tudor_period","/wiki/James_I_of_England","/wiki/Assart","/wiki/Charles_I_of_England","#cite_note-7","/w/index.php?title=Royal_forest&action=edit&section=9","/wiki/New_Forest","/wiki/Royal_Commission","/wiki/New_Forest","/wiki/Hampshire","/wiki/Swinley_Forest","/wiki/Berkshire","/wiki/Gloucestershire","/wiki/Epping_Forest","/wiki/Northamptonshire","/wiki/Wychwood","/wiki/Oxfordshire","/wiki/Oak","/wiki/Shipbuilding","/wiki/First_Commissioner_of_Woods_and_Forests","/wiki/Commissioner_of_Woods,_Forests_and_Land_Revenues","/wiki/Forestry_Commission","/w/index.php?title=Royal_forest&action=edit&section=10","/w/index.php?title=Royal_forest&action=
