Cannon vary in caliber, range,\nmobility, rate of fire, angle of fire, and firepower; different forms of cannon\ncombine and balance these attributes in varying degrees, depending on their\nintended use on the battlefield. The word cannon is derived from several\nlanguages, in which the original definition can usually be translated as tube,\ncane, or reed. The plural of cannon is also cannon, though more commonly in\nAmerica, cannons. In the modern era, the term cannon has fallen out of common\nusage, replaced by \"guns\" or \"artillery\" if not a more specific term such as\n\"mortar\" or \"howitzer\". In aviation, cannon generally describes weapons firing\nbullets larger than 0.5 inches (12.7 mm) in diameter.\n\nFirst used in China, cannon were among the earliest forms of gunpowder\nartillery, and over time replaced siege enginesâamong other forms of aging\nweaponryâon the battlefield. In the Middle East, the first use of the hand\ncannon is argued to be during the 1260 Battle of Ain Jalut between the Mamluks\nand Mongols. The first cannon in Europe were probably used in Iberia in the 11\nand 12th centuries, and English cannon were first deployed in the Hundred Years'\nWar, at the Battle of CrÃ©cy, in 1346. On the African continent, the cannon was\nfirst used by the Somali Imam Ahmad ibn Ibrihim al-Ghazi of the Adal Sultanate\nin his conquest of Ethiopia in 1529. [http-\n://www.nai.uu.se/library/resources/dossiers/local_history_of_ethiopia/A/ORTAST0-\n5.pdf \"Local History in Ethiopia\"] (pdf) The Nordic Africa Institute website\n(accessed 28 January 2008) It was during this period, the Middle Ages,\nthat cannon became standardized, and more effective in both the anti-infantry\nand siege roles. After the Middle Ages most large cannon were abandoned in favor\nof greater numbers of lighter, more maneuverable pieces. In addition, new\ntechnologies and tactics were developed, making most defences obsolete; this led\nto the construction of star forts, specifically designed to withstand artillery\nbombardment though these too (along with the Martello Tower) would find\nthemselves rendered obsolete when explosive and armour piercing rounds made even\nthese types of fortifications vulnerable.\n\nCannon also transformed naval warfare in the early modern period, as European\nnavies took advantage of their firepower. As rifling became commonplace, the\naccuracy and destructive power of cannon was significantly increased, and they\nbecame deadlier than ever, both to infantry who belatedly had to adopt different\ntactics, and to ships, which had to be armoured. In World War I, the majority of\ncombat fatalities were caused by artillery; they were also used widely in World\nWar II. Most modern cannon are similar to those used in the Second World War,\nalthough the importance of the larger caliber weapons has declined with the\ndevelopment of missiles.\n","linknr":1787,"url":"Cannon","recorded":1362476876,"links":118,"instances":["1789","1593","1552","ddg_65","projectile","1631","formation","device","instrument","cairo","cannon","weapon","fortification","weaponry","united_states","we_salute_you","music","weapon","military","explosives","1346","cannon"],"pdf":["http://www.nai.uu.se/library/resources/dossiers/local_history_of_ethiopia/A/ORTAST05.pdf","http://www.nato.int/docu/stanag/aap006/aap-6-2007.pdf","http://www.nato.int/docu/stanag/aap006/aap-6-2007.pdf","http://www.nato.int/docu/stanag/aap006/aap-6-2007.pdf","http://www.nato.int/docu/stanag/aap006/aap-6-2007.pdf"],"categories":["Cannon|","Weapon
