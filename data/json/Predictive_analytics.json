{"cursor":"43507","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Predictive analytics' encompasses a variety of techniques from statistics,\nmodeling, machine learning, and data mining that analyze current and historical\nfacts to make predictions about future, or otherwise unknown, events.\n\nIn business, predictive models exploit patterns found in historical and\ntransactional data to identify risks and opportunities. Models capture\nrelationships among many factors to allow assessment of risk or potential\nassociated with a particular set of conditions, guiding decision making for\ncandidate transactions.\n\nPredictive analytics is used in actuarial science,\nmarketing, financial services, insurance,\ntelecommunications, retail,\ntravel, healthcare, pharmaceuticals and\nother fields.\n\nOne of the most well known applications is credit scoring,\nwhich is used throughout financial services. Scoring models process a customer's\ncredit history, loan application, customer data, etc., in order to rank-order\nindividuals by their likelihood of making future credit payments on time. A well-\nknown example is the FICO score.\n","linknr":444,"url":"Predictive_analytics","recorded":1362480352,"links":19,"instances":["programming_language","programming_language","control","software","abstract","finance","machine_learning","physicist_and_entrepreneur","decision_trees"],"pdf":["http://www.aicpcu.org/doc/predictivemodelingwhitepaper.pdf","http://www.aicpcu.org/doc/predictivemodelingwhitepaper.pdf"],"categories":["Statistical models","Business intelligence","Insurance"],"headings":["Definition","Types","Applications","Technology and Big Data influences on Predictive Analytics","Statistical techniques","Tools","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["credit_score","united_states#fico_score_and_others"],["default","finance"],["pruning","decision_trees"],["model","abstract"],["feed_forward","control"],["orange","software"],["python","programming_language"],["r","programming_language"],["weka","machine_learning"],["sas","software"],["sas","software#components"],["roger_jones","physicist_and_entrepreneur"]],"members":["python","r","feed_forward","orange","model","credit_score","default","sas","weka","roger_jones","pruning"],"related":["Statistics","Predictive_modelling","Machine_learning","Data_mining","Prediction","Pattern_detection","Decision_making","Actuarial_science","Marketing","Financial_services","Insurance","Telecommunications","Retail","Travel","Healthcare","Pharmaceutical_company","Credit_scoring","Financial_services","Credit_history","Loan_application","Information_extraction","Trend_analysis","Explanatory_variable","Predictive_modeling","Forecasting","Marketing_effectiveness","Decision_model","Customer_Relationship_Management","Clinical_decision_support_system","Customer_record","Cross-selling","Consumer_satisfaction","Consumer_loyalty","Customer_attrition","Marketing","Cost_per_order","Cost_per_action","Fraud","Financial_transaction","Identity_theft","Insurance_claim","Credit_card_fraud","IRS","Tax_fraud","Web_fraud","Heuristics","Capital_asset_pricing_model","Probabilistic_Risk_Assessment","Delphi_method","RiskAoA","Underwriting","Underwrite","Default_(finance)","Bankruptcy","Big_Data","Hadoop","MapReduce","In-database_processing","Text_analytics","Unstructured_data","Regression_analysis","Linear_regression_model","Gaussâ€“Markov_theorem","Logistic_regression","Multinomial_logit","Probit","Binary_numeral_system","Wald_test","Likelihood-ratio_test","Binary_logit_model","Multinomial_logit_model","Random_multinomial_logit","Probit_model","Logistic_distribution","Probit_model","Logit_model","Logistic_distribution","Odds_ratio","Time_series","Autoregressive_model","Moving_average_model","Box-Jenkins","Autoregressive_moving_average_model","Autoregressive_integrated_moving_average","Autoregressive_conditional_heteroskedasticity","Survival_analysis","Linear_regression","Normal_distribution","Hazard_rate","Kaplan-Meier","Non-parametric_statistics","Decision_tree_learning","Decision_trees","Pruning_(decision_trees)","Random_forests","Random_multinomial_logit","Multivariate_adaptive_regression_splines","Non-parametric_statistics","Piecewise","Linear_regression","Basis_function","Overfit","Machine_learning","Medical_diagnostics","Credit_card_fraud_detection","Face_recognition","Speech_recognition","Stock_market","Cognition","Neural_networks","Nonlinearity","Model_(abstract)","Time_series","Statistical_classification","Control_theory","Finance","Cognitive_psychology","Cognitive_neuroscience","Medicine","Engineering","Physics","Supervised_learning","Unsupervised_learning","Backpropagation","Conjugate_gradient_method","Radial_basis_function","Perceptron","Self-organizing_map","Hopfield_network","Radial_basis_function","Neural_network","Sigmoid_function","Feed_forward_(control)","Perceptron","Support_Vector_Machine","Naive_Bayes_classifier","Curse_of_dimensionality","K-nearest_neighbor_algorithm","Iid","Geospatial_Predictive_Modeling","KNIME","Orange_(software)","Python_(programming_language)","R_(programming_language)","RapidMiner","Weka_(machine_learning)","Angoss","SPSS","SPSS_Modeler","KXEN_Inc.","Mathematica","MATLAB","Oracle_Corporation","Pervasive_Software","SAP_AG","SAS_(software)","STATISTICA","Tibco_Software","Predictive_Model_Markup_Language","Criminal_Reduction_Utilising_Statistical_History","Data_mining","Learning_analytics","Odds_algorithm","Pattern_recognition","Prescriptive_Analytics","Roger_Jones_(physicist_and_entrepreneur)"]}
