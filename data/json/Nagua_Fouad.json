{"cursor":"3791","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" 'Nagwa Fouad' (, Egyptian Arabic: ; born 1936)\nis a famous Egyptian belly dancer.\n\nAfter her release she performed at the Abdeen Casino where she met Ahmad Fuad\nHassan (her future husband for 6 years), a producer of stage shows that later\nbecame a famous conductor. He convinced her to perform live at the most\nprestigious music and dance show in the 1960s called Adwa El Madina (City\nLights) which had featured such superstars as Shadia, Abdel Halim Hafez, Fayza\nAhmed, and Sabah.\n\nIn 1976, the famous composer Mohammed Abdel Wahab wrote an entire musical piece\nexclusively for her belly dancing show titled Qamar Arba'tashar (meaning the\nfull Moon of the 14th), it was her transition from traditional oriental dance to\na choreographed stage performances.\n\nThe next important career step was Nagwa's marriage to Ahmed Fouad Hassan, the\ntalented violin player, composer and conductor. Ahmed gave Nagwa Fouad her\nchance to appear in the very popular sixties stage show \"Adwoua Al-Madina\" (City\nLights), which had featured such superstars as Abdel-Halim Hafez, Fayza Ahmed,\nShadia and Sabah. Nagwa featured on many of the covers of the Ahmed Fouad Hassan\nLP's/CD's. Nagua took every career step well calculated: \"Hassan was 17 years\nolder than me, but I needed him. He nurtured my amateur's talents... He taught\nme the importance of studying and working on my talent if I wanted to be a big\nstar. He trained me at the Nelly Mazloum Dance School and I joined the National\nDance Troupe to study folklore with Russian teachers.\" Nagoua Fouad learned\nshowmanship and eye-catching techniques which were obvious in her performances\nof \"Ayoub Al-Masri\" and \"Bahiya wa Yassin\". But Fouad Hassan wanted to have a\nbaby with Nagua. Something she didn't approve to so this eventually led to her\nfirst divorce after six years of marriage. In 1976, Nagwa Fouad reached the top\nof her career when composer Mohamed Abdel-Wahab wrote \"Qamar Arbaa-tashar\" (Blue\nMoon or 14the moon) for her. Her stage performance to this special piece allowed\nher to change the way belly-dancing was presented on stage, transforming it from\ntraditional oriental dance to more of a choreographed lavish spectacle adding\nmore dramatic elements to it than ever before. The composition served as a\ntransition for Nagwa: \"I was able to combine the oriental dancing of Tahiya\nKarioka and Samia Gamal with Na'ema's acrobatic style and created a stage show\nlike a dramatic piece\" she says. Najwa established her own dance group but it\ndid not last long and later tried to retire dancing to become actress. She\nplayed on the stage and in the cinema and finally became cinema producer.\n","linknr":97,"url":"Nagua_Fouad","recorded":1375069353,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Nagwa_Fouad&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Nagwa_Fouad&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","/wiki/Nagwa_Fouad","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","/w/index.php?title=Nagua_Fouad&redirect=no","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Arabic_language","/wiki/Egyptian_Arabic","/wiki/Help:IPA_for_Egyptian_Arabic","/wiki/Egypt","/wiki/Belly_dancer","/wiki/Shadia","/wiki/Abdel_Halim_Hafez","/wiki/Fayza_Ahmed","/wiki/Sabah","/wiki/Mohammed_Abdel_Wahab","/w/index.php?title=Nagwa_Fouad&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Mohammed_Abdel_Wahab","/w/index.php?title=Nagwa_Fouad&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=Nagwa_Fouad&action=edit&section=3","http://www.belly-dance.org/nagua-fouad.html","http://www.gobellydance.com/NaguaFouad.html","http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/1998/390/people.htm","http://www.hossamramzy.com/stars/starsofegypt_nagwa.htm","http://www.bestsbest.com/nagwafouad.html","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nagwa_Fouad&oldid=543956848","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Egyptian_dancers","/wiki/Category:Belly_dancers","/wiki/Category:Living_people","/wiki/Category:1936_births","/wiki/Category:Articles_containing_Arabic-language_text","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Nagwa+Fouad&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Nagwa+Fouad","/wiki/Nagwa_Fouad","/wiki/Talk:Nagwa_Fouad","#","/wiki/Nagwa_Fouad","/w/index.php?title=Nagwa_Fouad&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Nagwa_Fouad&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Nagwa_Fouad","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Nagwa_Fouad","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Nagwa_Fouad&oldid=543956848","/w/index.php?title=Nagwa_Fouad&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4120351","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Nagwa_Fouad&id=543956848","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Nagwa+Fouad","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Nagwa+Fouad&oldid=543956848&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Nagwa_Fouad&printable=yes","//ar.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D9%86%D8%AC%D9%88%D9%89_%D9%81%D8%A4%D8%A7%D8%AF","//arz.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D9%86%D8%AC%D9%88%D9%89_%D9%81%D8%A4%D8%A7%D8%AF","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4120351#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagwa_Fouad","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Egyptian
