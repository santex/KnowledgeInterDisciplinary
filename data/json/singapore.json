}}\n\n\n\n\n'Singapore' , officially the 'Republic of Singapore', is a Southeast Asian\nisland city-state off the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula, north of the\nequator. An island country made up of 63 islands, it is separated from Malaysia\nby the Straits of Johor to its north and from Indonesia's Riau Islands by the\nSingapore Strait to its south. The country is highly urbanised with very little\nprimary rainforest remaining, although more land is being created for\ndevelopment through land reclamation.\n\nPart of various local empires since being inhabited in the second\ncentury&nbsp;AD, Singapore hosted a trading post of the East India Company in\n1819 with permission from the Johor Sultanate. The British obtained sovereignty\nover the island in 1824 and Singapore became one of the British Straits\nSettlements in 1826. Occupied by the Japanese during World War II, Singapore\ndeclared independence from the United Kingdom, uniting with other former British\nterritories to form Malaysia in 1963, although it was separated from Malaysia\ntwo years later. Since then, it has had a massive increase in wealth, and is one\nof the Four Asian Tigers.\n\nSingapore is the world's fourth-leading financial centre, and its port is one of\nthe five busiest ports in the world. The economy depends heavily on exports and\nrefining imported goods, especially in manufacturing, which constituted 26% of\nSingapore's GDP in 2005. In terms of purchasing power parity, Singapore has the\nthird-highest per capita income in the world.\n\nSingapore is a unitary multiparty parliamentary republic with a Westminster\nsystem of unicameral parliamentary government. The People's Action Party has won\nevery election since self-government in 1959. Slightly over five million people\nlive in Singapore, of which 2.91 million were born locally. The population is\nhighly diverse; the majority are Chinese with almost 75% of the total\npopulation, while Malays and Indians forming significant minorities. Reflecting\nthis diversity, the country has four official languages: English, Malay,\nChinese, and Tamil. One of the five founding members of the Association of South\nEast Asian Nations (ASEAN), the country is also the host of the APEC\nSecretariat, and a member of the East Asia Summit, the Non-Aligned Movement, and\nthe Commonwealth.\n","title":"singapore","headings":["Etymology","History","Government and politics","Geography","Economy","Foreign
