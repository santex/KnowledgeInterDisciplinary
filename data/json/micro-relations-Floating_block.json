{"cursor":"2314","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nA 'floating block' in writing and publishing is any graphic, text, table, or\nother representation that is unaligned from the main flow of text. Use of\nfloating blocks to present pictures and tables is a typical feature of academic\nwriting and technical writing, including scientific and articles and books.\nFloating blocks are normally labeled with a caption or title that describes its\ncontents and a number that is used to refer to the figure from the main text. A\ncommon system divides floating block into two separately numbered series,\nlabeled figure (for pictures, diagrams, plots, etc.) and table.\n\nFloating blocks are said to be floating because they are not fixed in position\non the page at the place, but rather drift to the side of the page. An\nalternative name for figure is 'image' or 'graphic'. By placing pictures or\nother large items on the sides of pages rather than embedding them in the middle\nof the main flow of text, typesetting is more flexible and interruption to the\nflow of the narrative is avoided.\n\nFor example, an article on geography might have \"Figure 1: Map of the world\",\n\"Figure 2: Map of Europe\", \"Table 1: Population of continents\", \"Table 2:\nPopulation of European countries\", and so on. Some books will have a 'table of\nfigures'âin addition to the table of contentsâthat lists centrally all the\nfigures appearing in the work.\n\nOther kinds of floating blocks may be differentiated as well, for example:\n\n: Sidebar : For digressions from the main narrative. For example, a technical\n: manual on usage of a product might include examples of how various people have\n: employed the product in their work in sidebars. Also called an intermezzo. See\n: sidebar (publishing). Program : Articles and books on computer programming\n: often place code and algorithms in a figure. Equation : Writing on mathematics\n: may place large blocks of mathematical notation in numbered blocks set apart\n: from the main text.\n\n\n\n\n \n","linknr":101,"url":"Floating_block","recorded":1362371286,"links":15,"instances":["publishing","graphics","information"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Page layout","Documents","Indexing","Research"],"headings":[],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/ISBN_with_EAN13.svg/40px-ISBN_with_EAN13.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["table","information"],["plot","graphics"],["sidebar","publishing"]],"members":["sidebar","plot","table"],"related":["Writing","Publishing","Table_(information)","Academic_writing","Technical_writing","Plot_(graphics)","Typesetting","Geography","Table_of_contents","Sidebar_(publishing)","Computer_programming","Algorithms","Mathematics","Table_of_figures"]}
