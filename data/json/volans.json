It represents a flying fish; its name is a shortened form of its\noriginal name, 'Piscis Volans'. Volans was one of twelve constellations created\nby Petrus Plancius from the observations of Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser and\nFrederick de Houtman and it first appeared on a 35-cm diameter celestial globe\npublished in 1597 (or 1598) in Amsterdam by Plancius with Jodocus Hondius. The\nfirst depiction of this constellation in a celestial atlas was in Johann Bayer's\n[[Uranometria]] of 1603.\n","title":"volans","headings":["Stars","Deep-sky objects","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["2: Flying_fish","2: NGC_2442","1: Bayer_Family","1: Beta_Volantis","1: Gliese_293","1: Pictor","1: Dorado","1: Chamaeleon","1: 15th_parallel_north","1: South_Pole","1: Constellation","1: Petrus_Plancius","1: Pieter_Dirkszoon_Keyser","1: Frederick_de_Houtman","1: Jodocus_Hondius","1: Johann_Bayer","1: Double_star","1: Telescope","1: Gamma_Volantis","1: Epsilon_Volantis","1: Galaxies","1: NGC_2434","1: Lindsay-Shapley_ring","1: Ring_galaxy","1: Large_Magellanic_Cloud","1: Cartwheel_Galaxy","1: Galactic_merger","1: Shock_wave","1: Star_formation"]}
