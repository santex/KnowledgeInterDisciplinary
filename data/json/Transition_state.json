It is defined as the state corresponding to the\nhighest energy along this reaction coordinate. At this point, assuming a\nperfectly irreversible reaction, colliding reactant molecules will always go on\nto form products. It is often marked with the double dagger â¡ symbol.\nIt is also related to enzymes.\n\nAs an example, the transition state shown below occurs during the S N2\nreaction of bromoethane with a hydroxyl anion.\n","linknr":239,"url":"Transition_state","recorded":1362477028,"links":30,"instances":["chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Chemical kinetics"],"headings":["History of concept","Explanation","Observing transition states","Locating transition states by computational chemistry","The Hammond–Leffler postulate","The structure-correlation principle","Implications for enzymatic catalysis","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e1/Transition_State.png/700px-Transition_State.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/43/Structure_Correlation_Principle.png/400px-Structure_Correlation_Principle.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["product","chemistry"]],"members":["product"],"related":["Chemical_reaction","Reaction_coordinate","Irreversible_reaction","Double_dagger","Chemical_reaction","Transition_state_theory","Activated_complex_theory","Chemical_kinetics","Collision","Reactant","Molecule","Chemical_reaction","Kinetic_energy","Internal_energy","Activated_complex","Product_(chemistry)","Quantum_mechanics","Spectroscopy","Femtochemistry","IR_spectroscopy","Reactive_intermediate","Potential_energy_surface","Density_functional_theory","Møller–Plesset_perturbation_theory","Lanczos_algorithm","Hammond–Leffler_Postulate","Enthalpy","Hammond–Leffler_Postulate","Hammond–Leffler_Postulate","Bond_length","Bicyclic","Ethylene","Retro-Diels–Alder_reaction","Alkene","X-ray_crystallography","Enzyme","Catalysis","Electrostatics","Transition_state_theory","Transition_state_analog"]}
