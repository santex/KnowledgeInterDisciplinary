{"cursor":"31424","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Inbreeding' is reproduction from the mating of parents who are closely related\ngenetically. Inbreeding results in increased homozygosity, which can\nincrease the chances of offspring being affected by recessive or deleterious\ntraits. This generally leads to a decreased fitness of a\npopulation, which is called inbreeding depression. An\nindividual who results from inbreeding is referred to as inbred. The avoidance\nof expression of deleterious recessive alleles caused by inbreeding is thought\nto be the main selective force maintaining the outcrossing aspect of sexual\nreproduction. Michod RE. Eros and Evolution: A Natural Philosophy of Sex. (1994) Perseus\nBooks, ISBN 020140754X (See also Inbreeding depression.)\n\nLivestock breeders often practice controlled breeding to eliminate undesirable\ncharacteristics within a population, which is also coupled with culling of what\nis considered unfit offspring, especially when trying to establish a new and\ndesirable trait in the stock.\n\nIn plant breeding, inbred lines are used as stocks for the creation of hybrid\nlines to make use of the effects of heterosis. Inbreeding in plants also occurs\nnaturally in the form of self-pollination.\n","linknr":468,"url":"Inbreeding","recorded":1362483540,"links":46,"instances":["biophysical","biology","physical_attractiveness","biology","biology"],"pdf":["http://www.vortex9.org/reprints/experimental%20study%20inbreeding%20depression.pdf","http://www.vortex9.org/reprints/experimental%20study%20inbreeding%20depression.pdf","http://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/jfo/v051n02/p0168-p0173.pdf","http://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/jfo/v051n02/p0168-p0173.pdf","http://www.advs.usu.edu/files/uploads/ADVS3910WildHorses.pdf","http://www.dur.ac.uk/anthropology.journal/vol13/iss1/posters/freilich.pdf","http://www.oxfordjournals.org/jnls/list/jhered/freepdf/82-378.pdf","http://www.oxfordjournals.org/jnls/list/jhered/freepdf/82-378.pdf"],"categories":["Genetics","Population genetics","Breeding","Incest","Kinship and descent"],"headings":["Results","Calculation","Domestic animals","Laboratory animals","Humans","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/Intense_inbreeding_-_Continuous_sire_to_daughter_mating.svg/220px-Intense_inbreeding_-_Continuous_sire_to_daughter_mating.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["fitness","biology"],["hybrid","biology"],["symmetry","physical_attractiveness"],["environment","biophysical"],["race","biology"],["archduchess_maria_anna_of_austria","1804–1858"]],"members":["archduchess_maria_anna_of_austria","environment","fitness","symmetry","race","hybrid"],"related":["Reproduction","Mating","Genetic_distance","Homozygous","Recessive_trait","Fitness_(biology)","Population","Inbreeding_depression","Allele","Inbreeding_depression","Livestock","Culling","Phenotypic_trait","Plant_breeding","Inbred_line","Hybrid_(biology)","Heterosis","Self-pollination","Dominance_relationship","Fertility","Spermatozoon","Genetic_disorder","Symmetry_(physical_attractiveness)","Birth_rate","Infant_mortality","Population_growth_rate","Adult","Immune_system","Population_bottleneck","Assortative_mating","Environment_(biophysical)","Race_(biology)","Speciation","Ecosystem","Genetic_diversity","Species","Endangered_species","Extinction","Horse","Wild_horse","Feral","Primate","Cheetah","South_America","Sea_lion","Alpha_male","Ngorongoro_Crater","Heterozygosity","Ecosystem","Assay","Identical_by_descent","Assortative_mating","Selective_breeding","Homozygosity","Founder_effect","Backyard_breeder","Laboratory_mice","Animal_model","Congenic","Autosomal_recessive","Homozygous","Mutation","Uniparental_disomy","Royal_intermarriage","Ancient_Egypt","Pharaoh","Endogamy","Polygamy","Ptolemaic_dynasty","Ptolemy_II","Cleopatra_VII","Ptolemy_XIII","Ancient_Egypt","Jean_V_of_Armagnac","House_of_Wittelsbach","United_Kingdom","House_of_Habsburg","Prognathism","Charles_II_of_Spain","Distal_renal_tubular_acidosis","Francis_II,_Holy_Roman_Emperor","House_of_Habsburg","Maria_Theresa_of_Naples_and_Sicily","Archduchess_Maria_Anna_of_Austria_(1804–1858)","Ferdinand_I_of_Austria","Hydrocephalus","Revolutions_of_1848","Hemophilia","Queen_Victoria","Marriage","Political_alliance","Arranged_marriage","Sapa_Inca","Endogamy","Polygamy","Inca","House_of_Chakri","Thailand","Bhumibol_Adulyadej","Sirikit","Chulalongkorn","Mahidol_Adulyadej","Mongkut","Elizabeth_II","Prince_Philip,_Duke_of_Edinburgh","Queen_Victoria","Christian_IX_of_Denmark","Iceland","DeCODE","Genetic_diversity","Coefficient_of_relationship","Consanguinity","Cousin_marriage","Evolution_of_sexual_reproduction","Exogamy","F-statistics","Genetic_sexual_attraction","Heterozygote_advantage","Identical_ancestors_point","Inbreeding_depression","Incest","Insular_dwarfism","Intellectual_inbreeding","Linebreeding","List_of_coupled_cousins","Outbreeding_depression","Outcrossing","Prohibited_degree_of_kinship","Selective_breeding","Self-incompatibility_in_plants"]}
