The World Tourism Organization defines 'tourists' as people\n \"traveling to and staying in places outside their usual environment for not\n more than one consecutive year for leisure, business and other purposes\".\n\nTourism has become a popular global leisure activity. After slowly recovering\nfrom the contraction resulting from the late-2000s recession, where tourism\nsuffered a strong slowdown from the second half of 2008 through the end of 2009,\nand the outbreak of the H1N1 influenza virus, international tourist arrivals surpassed the milestone 1\nbillion tourists globally for first time in history in 2012. International tourism receipts (the travel item of the balance\nof payments) grew to trillion ( billion) in 2011, corresponding to an increase\nin real terms of 3.8% from 2010. In 2012, China became the\nlargest spender in international tourism globally with billion, surpassing\nGermany and United States. China and emerging markets significantly increase\ntheir spending over the past decade, with Russia and Brazil as noteworthy\nexamples.\n\nTourism is important, and in some cases, vital for many countries. It was\nrecognized in the Manila Declaration on World Tourism of 1980 as \"an activity\nessential to the life of nations because of its direct effects on the social,\ncultural, educational, and economic sectors of national societies and on their\ninternational relations.\" Tourism brings in\nlarge amounts of income in payment for goods and services available, accounting\nfor 30% of the world's exports of services, and 6% of overall exports of goods\nand services. It also creates opportunities for employment\nin the service sector of the economy, associated with tourism. These service industries include transportation\nservices, such as airlines, cruise ships, and taxicabs; hospitality services,\nsuch as accommodations, including hotels and resorts; and entertainment venues,\nsuch as amusement parks, casinos, shopping malls, music venues, and theatres.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Tourist","recorded":1372152429,"links":[],"instances":["sociology","reenactment","geography","ship","economics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Tourism|","Culture","Leisure","Service
