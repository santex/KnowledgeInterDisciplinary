Many plants produce secondary metabolites, known as\nallelochemicals, that influence the behavior, growth, or survival of herbivores.\nThese chemical defenses can act as repellents or toxins to herbivores, or reduce\nplant digestibility.\n\nOther defensive strategies used by plants include escaping or avoiding\nherbivores in time or in place, for example by growing in a location where\nplants are not easily found or accessed by herbivores, or by changing seasonal\ngrowth patterns. Another approach diverts herbivores toward eating non-essential\nparts, or enhances the ability of a plant to recover from the damage caused by\nherbivory. Some plants encourage the presence of natural enemies of herbivores,\nwhich in turn protect the plant. Each type of defense can be either constitutive\n(always present in the plant), or ''induced'' (produced in reaction to damage or\nstress caused by herbivores).\n\nHistorically, insects have been the most significant herbivores, and the\nevolution of land plants is closely associated with the evolution of insects.\nWhile most plant defenses are directed against insects, other defenses have\nevolved that are aimed at vertebrate herbivores, such as birds and mammals. The\nstudy of plant defenses against herbivory is important, not only from an\nevolutionary view point, but also in the direct impact that these defenses have\non agriculture, including human and livestock food sources; as beneficial\n'biological control agents' in biological pest control programs; as well as in\nthe search for plants of medical importance.\n","linknr":1259,"url":"Plant_defense_against_herbivory","recorded":1362373143,"links":59,"instances":["chemistry","biology","botany","physiology","biology","biology","plant","genus","botany","legume"],"pdf":["http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/91/25/12278.pdf","http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/91/25/12278.pdf","http://www.pitt.edu/~biohome/Dept/pdf/1723.pdf","http://www.pitt.edu/~biohome/Dept/pdf/1723.pdf","http://lajeunesse.myweb.usf.edu/download.php?f=papers/Carmona_Lajeunesse_Johnson_2011_Functional_Ecology.pdf","http://lajeunesse.myweb.usf.edu/download.php?f=papers/Carmona_Lajeunesse_Johnson_2011_Functional_Ecology.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20070418020403/http://life.bio.sunysb.edu/ee/mlerdau/Papers/Theis2003.pdf","http://life.bio.sunysb.edu/ee/mlerdau/Papers/Theis2003.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20070418020403/http://life.bio.sunysb.edu/ee/mlerdau/Papers/Theis2003.pdf","http://www.icb.ufmg.br/big/leeb/publicacoes/1994.Fernandes.pdf","http://harvardforest.fas.harvard.edu/research/leaves/pdf/bIOeSSAYS%20PLANT%20COLOR.pdf","http://harvardforest.fas.harvard.edu/research/leaves/pdf/bIOeSSAYS%20PLANT%20COLOR.pdf","http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/111069498v1.pdf","http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/111069498v1.pdf","http://www.clemson.edu/extension/hgic/pests/pdf/hgic2770.pdf","http://www.clemson.edu/extension/hgic/pests/pdf/hgic2770.pdf","http://www.yeacrops.com/Crop%20Protection%20Article.pdf","http://www.yeacrops.com/Crop%20Protection%20Article.pdf","http://www.people.vcu.edu/~asneden/The%20Quinine%20Alkaloids.pdf","http://www.people.vcu.edu/~asneden/The%20Quinine%20Alkaloids.pdf","http://www.people.vcu.edu/~asneden/tropane%20alkaloids.pdf","http://www.people.vcu.edu/~asneden/tropane%20alkaloids.pdf","http://www.people.vcu.edu/~asneden/Taxol.pdf","http://www.people.vcu.edu/~asneden/Taxol.pdf"],"categories":["Herbivory","Plant
