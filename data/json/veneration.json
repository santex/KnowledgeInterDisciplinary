Philologically, \"to venerate\"\n derives from the Latin verb, venerare, meaning to regard with reverence and\n respect. Veneration of saints is practiced, formally or informally, by\n adherents of some branches of all major religions, including Christianity,\n Judaism,<ref name=\"Ben-Ami1998\">\"Veneration of saints is a universal\n phenomenon. All monotheistic and polytheistic creeds contain something of its\n religious dimension... \" </ref> Hinduism,<ref name=\"Stark1966\"></ref>\n Islam,<ref name=\"Pohl2010\"></ref> and Buddhism.<ref name=\"Thomson\" /><ref\n name=\"Stark1966\"/>\n\nWithin Christianity, veneration is practiced by groups such as the Eastern\nOrthodox Church, the Roman Catholic, and Eastern Catholic Churches, all of which\nhave varying types of canonization or glorification procedures. In some\nChristian denominations, veneration is shown outwardly by respectfully bowing or\nmaking the sign of the cross before a saint's icon, relics, or statue, or by\ngoing on pilgrimage to sites associated with saints. The practice of veneration\nis deemed heretical by iconoclastic denominations.\n\nIn Judaism, there is no classical or formal recognition of saints, but there is\na long history of reverence shown toward biblical heroes and martyrs. In some\nregions, for example within Judaism in Morocco, there is a long and widespread\ntradition of saint veneration.<ref name=\"Thomson\"/><ref name=\"Ben-Ami1998\"/><ref\nname=\"Stark1966\"/>\n\nHinduism has a long tradition of veneration of saints, expressed toward various\ngurus and teachers of sanctity, both living and dead. Branches of Buddhism\ninclude formal liturgical worship of saints, with Mahayana Buddhism classifying\ndegrees of sainthood.<ref name=\"Thomson\"/><ref name=\"Stark1966\"/>\n\nIn Islam, veneration of saints is practiced by sects such as the Shi'a and Sufi,\nand in many parts of Southeast Asia, along with \"folk Islam\", which often\nincorporates local beliefs and practices.<ref></ref><ref></ref> Other sects,\nsuch as Sunnis and Wahhabists, abhor the practice<ref></ref>\n",
