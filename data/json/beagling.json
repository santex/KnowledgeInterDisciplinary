A beagle pack (20-40 hounds) is usually followed on\nfoot, and in some limited examples, mounted. Beagling is often enjoyed by\n'retired' fox hunters who have either sustained too many injuries or lost the\nagility to ride horseback, or who enjoy the outdoors and the camaraderie of the\nhunt. It is also traditionally a way for young men to learn how to handle hounds\non a smaller scale before they go on to hunt with foxhounds.\n",
