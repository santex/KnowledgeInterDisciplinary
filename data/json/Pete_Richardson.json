He played for the\nBills for three years until a knee injury ended his playing career.\n\nRichardson embarked into a steadfast 30 plus year coaching career in the late\n1970s, starting out in the high school football ranks in Dayton, Ohio, before\nmoving up to Division II (NCAA) football in 1979 as he joined the coaching staff\nat Winston-Salem State University in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. In 1988\nRichardson became the head coach of the Winston-Salem State University Rams. He\nserved from 1988 to 1992, where he compiled a win-loss record of 41-14-1,\nwinning three Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association (CIAA) conference\nchampionships (1988, 1990, 1991) and led the Rams to two appearances in the\nDivision II football playoffs in 1990 and 1991.\n\nHe left the Winston-Salem State Rams football program in good shape, and pursued\na higher challenge he became head football coach on the Division 1-AA level at\nSouthern University in Baton Rouge, Louisiana in 1993. During his tenure the\nJaguar football team won four Southwestern Athletic Conference (SWAC) titles,\nincluding back-to-back-to-back crowns in 1997, 1998, 1999, and the 2003, as well\nfour Black college football national championships (1993, 1995, 1997, 2003). His\nteams also made six appearances in the now defunct Heritage Bowl, a post-season\nHBCU Bowl game. Richardson compiled a win-loss record of 134-62-0 in 17 seasons\nas Head Coach, making him the second winningest coach in the history of the\nSouthern Jaguars football program behind the legendary coach Arnett Mumford. He\nis the only coach in the history of the Southern University football program to\nhave the unique distinction go undefeated against the late legendary College\nFootball Hall Of Fame coach Eddie Robinson of Grambling State University Tigers\nin the Bayou Classic.\n\nRichardson, towards the end of his 30 year college head coach career in the\nDivision II and Division I-AA (now Football Championship Subdivision) ranks has\ncollected a load of accolades specially allocated to football coaches of HBCUs\nHistorically Black Colleges and Universities, such as the Black Coaches\nAssociation's Coach of the Year in 1998, five-time SWAC Coach of the Year (1995,\n1997, 1998, 1999 and 2003), Atlanta's 100% Wrong Club's Coach of the Year (1995,\n1997, 1998, 1999 and 2003), Washington D.C.'s Pigskin Club's Coach of the Year\n(1995, 1998 and 2003), the Kodak Region IV Coach of the Year (1995) and the\nSheridan Broadcasting Network's Coach of the Year (1997 and 2003).\n\nThere were a huge number of former Southern Jaguar players who have come through\nduring Richardson's tenure, who were All-SWAC Conference players and Black\nCollege All-Americans. Only a very few of them have able to move on and\nestablish careers in the National Football League. They are Jerry Wilson, Ahmad\nTreaudo, and Lenny Williams. Wilson, who was a 4th round NFL Draft pick in 1995,\nhas been the only player from this group who achieved veteran status, playing 10\nseasons with three different teams. The other players have been practice squad\nfree agents, who have seen little to no action. Yancey Thigpen was the only Winston-\nSalem Ram player under Richardson who went on to the NFL.\n","linknr":160,"url":"Pete_Richardson","recorded":1375056839,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Pete_Richardson&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Pete_Richardson&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/American_football","/wiki/Youngstown,_Ohio","/wiki/Dayton_Flyers_football","/wiki/Buffalo_Bills","/wiki/Defensive_back","/wiki/Head_coach","/wiki/Winston-Salem_State_Rams_football","/wiki/Southern_Jaguars_football","/wiki/Black_college_football_national_championship","/wiki/Central_Intercollegiate_Athletic_Association","/wiki/Southwestern_Athletic_Conference","/wiki/Youngstown,_Ohio","/wiki/American_football","/wiki/Defensive_back","/wiki/National_Football_League","/wiki/College_football","/wiki/University_of_Dayton","/wiki/Buffalo_Bills","/wiki/1968_NFL_Draft","/wiki/Dayton,_Ohio","/wiki/Division_II_(NCAA)","/wiki/Winston-Salem_State_University","/wiki/Winston-Salem,_North_Carolina","/wiki/Winston-Salem_State_University","/wiki/Central_Intercollegiate_Athletic_Association","/wiki/Division_1-AA","/wiki/Southern_University","/wiki/Baton_Rouge,_Louisiana","/wiki/Southwestern_Athletic_Conference","/wiki/Black_college_football_national_championship","/wiki/Heritage_Bowl","/wiki/Southern_Jaguars","/wiki/Ace_Mumford","/wiki/Southern_University","/wiki/Eddie_Robinson_(football_coach)","/wiki/Grambling_State_University","/wiki/Bayou_Classic","/wiki/Division_I-AA","/wiki/Football_Championship_Subdivision","/wiki/Historically_Black_Colleges_and_Universities","/wiki/Southwestern_Athletic_Conference","/wiki/National_Football_League","/wiki/Jerry_Wilson_(American_football)","/wiki/Ahmad_Treaudo","/wiki/Lenny_Williams_(Canadian_football)","/wiki/NFL_Draft","/wiki/Yancey_Thigpen","/w/index.php?title=Pete_Richardson&action=edit&section=1","http://gojagsports.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/richardson_pete00.html","/wiki/Template:Winston-Salem_State_Rams_football_coach_navbox","/wiki/Template_talk:Winston-Salem_State_Rams_football_coach_navbox","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Winston-Salem_State_Rams_football_coach_navbox&action=edit","/wiki/Winston-Salem_State_Rams_football","/w/index.php?title=Howard_K._Wilson&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Clarence_Gaines","/wiki/Tom_Conrad","/w/index.php?title=Cleo_Wallace&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Bill_Hayes_(American_football)","/wiki/Kermit_Blount","/w/index.php?title=Connell_Maynor&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Template:Southern_Jaguars_football_coach_navbox","/wiki/Template_talk:Southern_Jaguars_football_coach_navbox","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Southern_Jaguars_football_coach_navbox&action=edit","/wiki/Southern_Jaguars_football","/w/index.php?title=J._F._Burrell&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Charles_L._Holmes&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Brice_Taylor","/w/index.php?title=Cliff_A._Purnell&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Ace_Mumford","/wiki/Ace_Mumford","/w/index.php?title=Robert_Henry_Lee&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Robert_E._Smith_(American_football)&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Alva_Tabor&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Charles_Bates","/w/index.php?title=Ken_Tillage&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Cass_Jackson&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Otis_Washington&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Marino_Casem","/w/index.php?title=Gerald_Kimble&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Marino_Casem","/wiki/Stump_Mitchell","/w/index.php?title=Dawson_Odums&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","/wiki/Youngstown,_Ohio","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pete_Richardson&oldid=558970476","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1946_births","/wiki/Category:Living_people","/wiki/Category:American_football_defensive_backs","/wiki/Category:Buffalo_Bills_players","/wiki/Category:Buffalo_Bills_(AFL)_players","/wiki/Category:Dayton_Flyers_football_players","/wiki/Category:Southern_Jaguars_football_coaches","/wiki/Category:Winston-Salem_State_Rams_football_coaches","/wiki/Category:Sportspeople_from_Youngstown,_Ohio","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Pete+Richardson&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Pete+R
