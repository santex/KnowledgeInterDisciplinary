In cancer, cells divide and\ngrow uncontrollably, forming malignant tumors, and invade nearby parts of the\nbody. The cancer may also spread to more distant parts of the body through the\nlymphatic system or bloodstream. Not all tumors are cancerous. Benign tumors do\nnot grow uncontrollably, do not invade neighboring tissues, and do not spread\nthroughout the body. There are over 200 different known cancers that afflict\nhumans.\n\n Determining what causes cancer is complex. Many things are known\nto increase the risk of cancer, including tobacco use, certain infections,\nradiation, lack of physical activity, obesity, and environmental pollutants. These can directly damage genes or combine with existing\ngenetic faults within cells to cause the disease.\nApproximately five to ten percent of cancers are entirely hereditary.\n\n Cancer can be detected in a number of\nways, including the presence of certain signs and symptoms, screening tests, or\nmedical imaging. Once a possible cancer is detected it is diagnosed by\nmicroscopic examination of a tissue sample. Cancer is usually treated with\nchemotherapy, radiation therapy and surgery. The chances of surviving the\ndisease vary greatly by the type and location of the cancer and the extent of\ndisease at the start of treatment. While cancer can affect people of all ages,\nand a few types of cancer are more common in children, the risk of developing\ncancer generally increases with age. In 2007, cancer caused about 13% of all\nhuman deaths worldwide (7.9 million). Rates are rising as more people live\nto an old age and as mass lifestyle changes occur in the developing world.\n","linknr":1836,"url":"Malignant_tumor","recorded":1362510686,"links":162,"instances":["medicine","medical","medicine","anatomy","dermatology","biophysical","menopause","healthcare","biology","biology"],"pdf":["http://www.iarc.fr/en/media-centre/pr/2011/pdfs/pr208_E.pdf","http://www.iarc.fr/en/media-centre/pr/2011/pdfs/pr208_E.pdf","http://whqlibdoc.who.int/php/WHO_PHP_34.pdf","http://choosingwisely.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/5things_12_factsheet_Amer_Soc_Clin_Onc.pdf","http://choosingwisely.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/5things_12_factsheet_Amer_Soc_Clin_Onc.pdf","http://choosingwisely.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/5things_12_factsheet_Amer_Soc_Clin_Onc.pdf","http://choosingwisely.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/5things_12_factsheet_Amer_Soc_Clin_Onc.pdf","http://www.nationalconsensusproject.org/guideline.pdf","http://www.nationalconsensusproject.org/guideline.pdf"],"categories":["Cancer|","Aging-associated
