Heat is being generated internally in the casing and being cooled at the\n  boundary, providing a steady state temperature distribution.]] A 'differential\n  equation' is a mathematical equation for an unknown function of one or several\n  variables that relates the values of the function itself and its derivatives\n  of various orders. Differential equations play a prominent role in\n  engineering, physics, economics, and other disciplines.\n\nDifferential equations arise in many areas of science and technology,\nspecifically whenever a deterministic relation involving some continuously\nvarying quantities (modeled by functions) and their rates of change in space\nand/or time (expressed as derivatives) is known or postulated. This is\nillustrated in classical mechanics, where the motion of a body is described by\nits position and velocity as the time value varies. Newton's laws allow one\n(given the position, velocity, acceleration and various forces acting on the\nbody) to express these variables dynamically as a differential equation for the\nunknown position of the body as a function of time. In some cases, this\ndifferential equation (called an equation of motion) may be solved explicitly.\n\nAn example of modelling a real world problem using differential equations is the\ndetermination of the velocity of a ball falling through the air, considering\nonly gravity and air resistance. The ball's acceleration towards the ground is\nthe acceleration due to gravity minus the deceleration due to air resistance.\nGravity is considered constant, and air resistance may be modeled as\nproportional to the ball's velocity. This means that the ball's acceleration,\nwhich is a derivative of its velocity, depends on the velocity (and the velocity\ndepends on time). Finding the velocity as a function of time involves solving a\ndifferential equation.\n\nDifferential equations are mathematically studied from several different\nperspectives, mostly concerned with their solutions âthe set of functions that\nsatisfy the equation. Only the simplest differential equations admit solutions\ngiven by explicit formulas; however, some properties of solutions of a given\ndifferential equation may be determined without finding their exact form. If a\nself-contained formula for the solution is not available, the solution may be\nnumerically approximated using computers. The theory of dynamical systems puts\nemphasis on qualitative analysis of systems described by differential equations,\nwhile many numerical methods have been developed to determine solutions with a\ngiven degree of accuracy.\n","linknr":450,"url":"Differential_equations","recorded":1362372577,"links":87,"instances":["software","mathematics","mathematics","mathematics","mathematics","mechanics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Differential equations|*"],"headings":["Directions of study","Nomenclature","Related concepts","Connection to difference equations","Universality of mathematical description","Notable differential equations","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/75/De_template.svg/220px-De_template.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/Elmer-pump-heatequation.png/350px-Elmer-pump-heatequation.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/3/2/532a80bb3f175224ba6753e6426a3c9b.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/4/f/54f4fa7e8d73b63164fee2108d7876e0.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/c/e/0/ce08e1ff472375d9cd7e61943c58a423.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/1/2/0/120bf99b2dafa7b817c1790768e1fcb5.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/e/a/7ea7d6ad89082702eafaee72530e1249.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/a/7/8a7c9d23528673b5c552bdc97b8c8883.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/b/b/5/bb58cab8e61438dff87954ecabbe399f.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/8/2/e82f81d37315770b739665e462441a27.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/e/4/5e442e9ee91080990a45ec94665ec8f5.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Wikibooks-logo-en-noslogan.svg/40px-Wikibooks-logo-en-noslogan.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["function","mathematics"],["variable","mathematics"],["deterministic_system","mathematics"],["matrix","mathematics"],["dynamics","mechanics"],["geodesic#(pseudo-riemannian_geometry"],["maxima","software"]],"members":["maxima","variable","function","deterministic_system","matrix","dynamics"],"related":["Heat","Steady_state","Mathematics","Equation","Function_(mathematics)","Variable_(mathematics)","Derivative","Engineering","Physics","Economics","Deterministic_system_(mathematics)","Classical_mechanics","Newton's_laws_of_motion","Equations_of_motion","Dynamical_systems","Numerical_methods","Pure_mathematics","Applied_mathematics","Physics","Meteorology","Engineering","Closed-form_expression","Numerical_ordinary_differential_equations","Weak_solution","Weak_derivative","Differentiable","Stability_theory","Ordinary_differential_equation","Vector-valued_function","Matrix_(mathematics)","Bessel's_differential_equation","Explicit_function","Implicit_derivative","Degree_of_a_polynomial","Nonlinear","Sufficient_condition","Necessary_condition","Partial_differential_equation","Partial_derivatives","Affine_space","Symmetries","Chaos_theory","Navier–Stokes_existence_and_smoothness","Linearization","Harmonic_oscillator","Pendulum","Laplace_equation","Korteweg–de_Vries_equation","Delay_differential_equation","Stochastic_differential_equation","Stochastic_process","Wiener_process","Differential_algebraic_equation","Difference_equations","Physics","Chemistry","Biology","Economics","Mathematical_modelling","Partial_differential_equation","Wave_equation","Joseph_Fourier","Heat_equation","Diffusion","Black–Scholes","Newton's_Second_Law","Dynamics_(mechanics)","Euler–Lagrange_equation","Hamilton's_equations","Radioactive_decay","Nuclear_physics","Newton's_law_of_cooling","Thermodynamics","Wave_equation","Maxwell's_equations","Electromagnetism","Heat_equation","Thermodynamics","Laplace's_equation","Harmonic_function","Poisson's_equation","Einstein's_field_equation","General_relativity","Schrödinger_equation","Quantum_mechanics","Navier–Stokes_equations","Fluid_dynamics","Diffusion_equation","Stochastic_processes","Convection–diffusion_equation","Fluid_dynamics","Cauchy–Riemann_equations","Complex_analysis","Poisson–Boltzmann_equation","Molecular_dynamics","Shallow_water_equations","Universal_differential_equation","Lorenz_attractor","Verhulst_equation","Lotka–Volterra_equations","Replicator_dynamics","Hodgkin–Huxley_model","Exogenous_growth_model","Malthusian_growth_model","Sethi_model","Complex_differential_equation","Exact_differential_equation","Integral_equations","Linear_differential_equation","Picard&ndash;Lindelöf_theorem","Recurrence_relation","MIT","Lamar_University","Maxima_(software)","UIUC"]}
