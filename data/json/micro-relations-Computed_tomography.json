These cross-sectional images are used for\ndiagnostic and therapeutic purposes in various medical disciplines. Digital geometry processing is used to generate a three-\ndimensional image of the inside of an object from a large series of two-\ndimensional X-ray images taken around a single axis of rotation. Herman, G. T., Fundamentals of computerized tomography: Image\nreconstruction from projection, 2nd edition, Springer, 2009 \n\n\n\nCT produces a volume of data that can be manipulated, through a process known as\n\"windowing\", in order to demonstrate various bodily structures based on their\nability to block the X-ray beam. Although historically the images generated were\nin the axial or transverse plane, perpendicular to the long axis of the body,\nmodern scanners allow this volume of data to be reformatted in various planes or\neven as volumetric (3D) representations of structures. Although most common in\nmedicine, CT is also used in other fields, such as nondestructive materials\ntesting. Another example is archaeological uses such as imaging the contents of\nsarcophagi.\n\nUsage of CT has increased dramatically over the last two decades in many\ncountries. An estimated 72 million scans were\nperformed in the United States in 2007. One study\nestimated that as many as 0.4% of current cancers in the United States are due\nto CTs performed in the past and that this may increase to as high as 1.5-2%\nwith 2007 rates of CT usage; however, this\nestimate is disputed. Kidney problems following intravenous contrast\nagents may also be a concern in some types of studies.\n","linknr":934,"url":"Computed_tomography","recorded":1362510708,"links":86,"instances":["electromagnetic_radiation","radiation_safety","unit","bone","medicine"],"pdf":["http://www.columbia.edu/~djb3/papers/nejm1.pdf","http://www.columbia.edu/~djb3/papers/nejm1.pdf","http://www.northernradiology.com/assets/Imaging%20Services/Images/furlow%20ct%20scan%20info.pdf","http://www.northernradiology.com/assets/Imaging%20Services/Images/furlow%20ct%20scan%20info.pdf","http://www.aapm.org/pubs/reports/RPT_96.pdf","http://www.uclh.nhs.uk/PandV/PIL/Patient%20information%20leaflets/Contrast%20Agents%20for%20Radiotherapy%20CT%20Planning%20Scan.pdf","http://www.zib.de/deuflhard/pub/MehrMath_en.pdf","http://www.zib.de/deuflhard/pub/MehrMath_en.pdf","http://bjr.birjournals.org/cgi/reprint/79/937/5.pdf"],"categories":["X-ray
