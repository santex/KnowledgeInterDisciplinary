In\nEurope the most common process is froth flotation deinking.\n\nPaper is one of the main targets for recycling. A concern about recycling wood\npulp paper is that the fibers are degraded with each cycle and after being\nrecycled 4â6 times the fibers become too short and weak to be useful in making\npaper.\n","linknr":305,"url":"Deinking","recorded":1362512361,"links":22,"instances":["papermaking","chemistry","material"],"pdf":["http://www.corrugated.org/Upload/Files/WaxAlternativesStandard.pdf","http://www.corrugated.org/Upload/Files/WaxAlternativesStandard.pdf","http://www.voithpaper.com/applications/productsearch/files/594_VPR-PB-07-0001-GB-07.pdf"],"categories":["Papermaking","Industrial processes","Paper recycling"],"headings":["History","Deinking process","See also","References","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/Deinking_%28schematic_layout%29.svg/350px-Deinking_%28schematic_layout%29.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/19/FlCell.PNG/240px-FlCell.PNG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/12px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["lime","material"],["stickies","papermaking"],["suspension","chemistry"],["stickies","papermaking"],["stickies","papermaking"]],"members":["stickies","suspension","lime"],"related":["Industrial_process","Printing_ink","Fiber_crop","Recycled_paper","Deinked_pulp","Froth_flotation","Paper_recycling","Wood_pulp","Paper_machine","Rag_paper","Hemp","Linen","Cotton","Wood_pulp","Paper_recycling","Industrialisation","Paperboard","German_people","Justus_Claproth","Johann_Engelhard_Schmid","Froth_flotation","Recycled_paper","Papermachine","Magazine_paper","Newspaper","Paperboard","Corrugated_fiberboard","Papermill","Conveyor_belt","Pulper","PH","Sodium_silicate","Sodium_hydroxide","Hydrogen_peroxide","Calcium","Ion","Hard_water","Lime_(material)","Calcium_chloride","Fatty_acid","Emulsion","Soap","Siloxane","Slurry","Centrifugal_cleaning","Sieve","Book_binding","Hot_melt_adhesive","Adhesive","Laminating","Adhesive_tape","Hydrophobic","Printing_ink","Stickies_(papermaking)","Froth_flotation","Mining_industry","Europe","Recycled_paper","Air","Suspension_(chemistry)","Chemical_affinity","Froth","Dispersant","Printing_ink","Dewatering","Wash","Stickies_(papermaking)","Deinked_pulp","Facial_tissue","Belt_filter","Disk_filter","Water_filter","Dissolved_air_flotation","Bleaching_of_wood_pulp","Peroxide","Sodium_dithionite","Brightness","Wood_fiber","Papermaking","Flexo","Particle_size","Alkaline","Acidic","Stickies_(papermaking)","Paper_recycling","Froth_flotation","Dissolved_air_flotation","Environmental_issues_with_paper","Pulp_&_Paper_chemicals","German_inventors_and_discoverers"]}
