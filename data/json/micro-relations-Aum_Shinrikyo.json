The group was founded by Shoko\nAsahara in 1984. The group gained international notoriety in 1995, when it\ncarried out the Sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway.\n\nThe name derives from the Sanskrit syllable [[Om|Aum]], which represents the\nuniverse, followed by Shinrikyo written in kanji, roughly meaning \"religion of\nTruth\". In English \"Aum Shinrikyo\" is usually translated as \"Supreme Truth\". In\nJanuary 2000, the organization changed its name to Aleph in reference to the\nfirst letter of the Arabic alphabet, Hebrew alphabet and Phoenician alphabets.\nIt changed its logo as well.\n\nIn 1995, the group claimed they had over 9,000 members in Japan, and as many as\n40,000 worldwide. Police consider the existing groups Aleph and Hikari no Wa to\nbe branches of the \"dangerous religion\".
