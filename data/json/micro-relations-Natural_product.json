A natural\nproduct can be considered as such even if it can be prepared by total synthesis.\n\nThese small molecules provide the source or inspiration for the majority of FDA-\napproved agents and continue to be one of the major sources of inspiration for\ndrug discovery. In particular, these compounds are important in the treatment of\nlife-threatening conditions. Newman DJ, Cragg GM Natural products as sources\nof new drugs over the last 25 years.
