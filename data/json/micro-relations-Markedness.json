{"cursor":"17978","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n'Markedness' is a specific kind of asymmetry relationship between elements of\nlinguistic or conceptual structure. In a marked/unmarked relation, one term of\nan opposition is the broader, dominant one. The dominant default or minimum\neffort form is known as the 'unmarked' term and the other, secondary one is the\n'marked' term. In other words, it is the characterization of a \"normal\"\nlinguistic unit (i.e. the unmarked term) compared to the unit's possible\n\"irregular\" forms (i.e. the marked term).\n\nIn linguistics, markedness ranges over phonological, grammatical, and semantic\noppositions, defining them in terms of 'marked' and 'unmarked' oppositions like\nhonest (unmarked) vs. dishonest (marked). Marking may be purely semantic, or may\nbe realized as extra morphology. The term derives from the 'marking' of a\ngrammatical role with a suffix or other element, but has been extended to\nsituations where there is no morphological distinction.\n\nIn the social sciences more broadly, markedness is used to distinguish two\nmeanings of the same term, where one is common usage (unmarked sense) and the\nother is specialized to a cultural context (marked sense).\n\nIn psychology and machine learning markedness or deltap is the dual of\ninformedness or deltap'. Empirically they measure the strength of\nassociations, which match up remarkably with\ntheir interpretation as the probability that a condition marks a variable, resp.\nthe probability that variable informs a condition or decision. The geometric mean of informedness and markedness, or\nequivalently of deltap and deltap', is Matthews correlation coefficient.\n","linknr":203,"url":"Markedness","recorded":1362903207,"links":23,"instances":["linguistics","linguistics","linguistics","language_use","morphology","linguistics"],"pdf":["http://www.bioinfo.in/uploadfiles/13031311552_1_1_JMLT.pdf","http://www.bioinfo.in/uploadfiles/13031311552_1_1_JMLT.pdf"],"categories":["Sociolinguistics","Phonology","Semantics","Grammar"],"headings":["Marked and unmarked word pairs","Background in the Prague School","Jakobsonian tradition","Cultural markedness","Local markedness and markedness reversals","Universals and frequency","Diagnostics","Markedness in generative grammar","See also","References","Bibliography"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["derivation","linguistics"],["prague_school","linguistics"],["semantic_analysis","linguistics"],["context","language_use"],["marker","linguistics"],["lemma","morphology"]],"members":["marker","semantic_analysis","derivation","context","lemma","prague_school"],"related":["Asymmetry","Linguistics","Phonology","Grammar","Semantics","Social_science","Psychology","Machine_learning","Geometric_mean","Matthews_correlation_coefficient","Inflection","Derivation_(linguistics)","Question","Prague_school_(linguistics)","Structuralism","Roman_Jakobson","Nikolai_Trubetzkoy","Edwin_Battistella","Linguistic_analysis","Nasality","Language","Language_acquisition","Language_loss","Aphasia","Semantic_analysis_(linguistics)","C._S._Peirce","Thomas_Givon","Joseph_Needham","Context_(language_use)","Consonant","Vowel","Frisian_languages","Joseph_Greenberg","Language_universals","Implicational_universal","Noam_Chomsky","The_Sound_Pattern_of_English","Generative_syntax","Universal_grammar","Howard_Lasnik","Second-language_acquisition","Optimality_theory","Underlying_representation","Marker_(linguistics)","Lemma_(morphology)","Inflection","Lexeme","Null_morpheme"]}
