This contrasts with a morpheme, which is the smallest unit of meaning\nbut will not necessarily stand on its own. A word may consist of a single\nmorpheme (for example: oh!, rock, red, quick, run, expect), or several (rocks,\nredness, quickly, running, unexpected), whereas a morpheme may not be able to\nstand on its own as a word (in the words just mentioned, these are -s, -ness,\n-ly, -ing, un-, -ed). A complex word will typically include a root and one or\nmore affixes (rock-s, red-ness, quick-ly, run-ning, un-expect-ed), or more than\none root in a compound (black-board, rat-race). Words can be put together to\nbuild larger elements of language, such as phrases (a red rock), clauses (I\nthrew a rock), and sentences (He threw a rock too but he missed).\n\nThe term word may refer to a spoken word or to a written word, or sometimes to\nthe abstract concept behind either. Spoken words are made up of units of sound\ncalled phonemes, and written words of symbols called graphemes, such as the\nletters of the English alphabet.\n",
