An inner tube of metal which stretches most within its elastic limit\nenlarges under the pressure of confined powder gases to transmit stress to outer\ncylinders under tension. Fairfield (1921) p.161\nConcentric metal cylinders and/or wire windings are assembled to minimize the\nweight required to resist the pressure of powder gases pushing a projectile out\nof the barrel. Built-up construction was the norm for guns mounted aboard 20th\ncentury Dreadnoughts and contemporary railway guns, coastal artillery, and siege\nguns through World War II.\n","linknr":139,"url":"Built-up_gun","recorded":1362892443,"links":14,"instances":["mechanics","mechanics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Naval artillery","Firearm construction","Mechanical engineering"],"headings":["Background","Nomenclature","Assembly Procedure","Liners","Monoblock Guns","See also","Notes","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/BL_6_inch_Mk_IV_gun_construction_diagram.jpg/400px-BL_6_inch_Mk_IV_gun_construction_diagram.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/76/38_cm_Gesch%C3%BCtzrohr_Hanstholm.JPG/220px-38_cm_Gesch%C3%BCtzrohr_Hanstholm.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["stress","mechanics"],["deformation","mechanics"]],"members":["stress","deformation"],"related":["Elastic_limit","Stress_(mechanics)","Dreadnought","Railway_gun","Coastal_artillery","World_War_II","Gunpowder","Smokeless_powder","Deformation_(mechanics)","Breechblock","Autofrettage","Hydraulic_fluid","Hoop_gun"]}
