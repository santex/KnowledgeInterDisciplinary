{"cursor":"19434","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" in Vienna.]]\n\n'Waste-to-energy' (WtE) or 'energy-from-waste' (EfW) is the process of creating\nenergy in the form of electricity or heat from the incineration of waste. WtE is\na form of energy recovery. Most WtE processes produce electricity directly\nthrough combustion, or produce a combustible fuel commodity, such as methane,\nmethanol, ethanol or synthetic\nfuels.
