It may also refer to shale oil, an\noutput from an oil shale pyrolysis. The properties of the synthetic crude depend\non the processes used in the upgrading. Typically, it is low in sulfur and has\nan API gravity of around 30. It is also known as \"upgraded crude\".\n\nSynthetic crude is an intermediate product produced when an extra-heavy or\nunconventional oil source is upgraded into a transportable form. Synthetic crude\nis then shipped to oil refineries where it is further upgraded into finished\nproducts. Synthetic crude may also be mixed, as a diluent, with heavy oil to\ncreate synbit. Synbit is more viscous than synthetic crude, but can be a less\nexpensive alternative for transporting heavy oil to a conventional refinery.\n\nSyncrude Canada, Suncor Energy Inc., and Canadian Natural Resources Limited are\nthe three largest worldwide producers of synthetic crude with a cumulative\nproduction of approximately . The NewGrade Energy Upgrader became operational in\n1988, and was the first upgrader in Canada, now part of the CCRL Refinery\nComplex. {{cite web |url\n=http://esask.uregina.ca/entry/heavy_oil_upgraders.html |title =Encyclopedia of\nSaskatchewan - HEAVY OIL UPGRADERS |publisher =University of Regina |accessdate\n= 2011-08-07}}\n","linknr":110,"url":"Synthetic_crude","recorded":1362666428,"links":15,"instances":["oil_sands_and_heavy_oil"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Synthetic fuels","Bituminous sands","Petroleum industry in Canada"],"headings":["See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ce/Oil_well.jpg/40px-Oil_well.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["history_of_the_petroleum_industry_in_canada","oil_sands_and_heavy_oil"]],"members":["history_of_the_petroleum_industry_in_canada"],"related":["Upgrader","Oil_sand","Shale_oil","Oil_shale","Pyrolysis","API_gravity","Dilbit","Syncrude","Suncor_Energy","Canadian_Natural_Resources_Limited","CCRL_Refinery_Complex","University_of_Regina","Albian_Sands","Canadian_Centre_for_Energy_Information","History_of_the_petroleum_industry_in_Canada_(oil_sands_and_heavy_oil)","Manure-derived_synthetic_crude_oil","Scotford_Upgrader","Suncor","Syncrude"]}
