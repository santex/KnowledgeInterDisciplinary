      "text" : "\n\n's 1920 Power house mechanic working on steam pump.]] 'Roughneck' is a slang\nterm for a person whose occupation is hard-manual labour, typically in a\ndangerous working environment. The term applies across a number of industries,\nbut is most commonly associated with oil rigs. The ideal of the hard-working,\ntough roughneck has been adopted by several sports teams who use the phrase as\npart of their name or logo.\n\nOriginally the term was used in the traveling carnivals of 19th century America,\nalmost interchangeably with roustabout. By the 1930s the terms had transferred\nto the oil drilling industry. In the United Kingdom's oil industry starting in\nthe 1970s, roughneck specifically meant those who worked on the drill floor of a\ndrilling rig handling specialised drilling equipment for drilling and pressure\ncontrols. In practice, these workers ranged from unskilled to highly skilled,\ndepending subjectively on the individual worker's aptitude and experience. By\ncontrast, a roustabout would perform general labor, such as loading and\nunloading cargo from crane baskets and assisting welders, mechanics,\nelectricians and other skilled workers. The word roughneck was in use in the\nU.S. oil drilling industry even earlier and had a similar meaning.\n",
