However, there\nare several other members of this family that bind to the other TNFs.\n","linknr":532,"url":"Tumor_necrosis_factor_receptor","recorded":1362484449,"links":20,"instances":["protein"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Cytokine receptors","Apoptosis"],"headings":["Members","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/PDB_1tnr_EBI.jpg/220px-PDB_1tnr_EBI.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/AlphaHelixSection.svg/40px-AlphaHelixSection.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cd40","protein"]],"members":["cd40"],"related":["Cytokine_receptor","Tumor_necrosis_factors","Adaptor_protein","TRADD","TRAF","Ribosome_inactivating_protein","TNF_alpha","TNF_alpha","CD120","CD120","TNFRSF1A","TNFRSF1B","Lymphotoxin_beta_receptor","CD134","CD40_(protein)","Fas_receptor","TNFRSF6B","CD27","CD30","CD137","TNFRSF10A","TNFRSF10B","TNFRSF10C","TNFRSF10D","RANK","Osteoprotegerin","TNFRSF12A","TNFRSF13B","TNFRSF13C","TNFRSF14","Low_affinity_nerve_growth_factor_receptor","TNFRSF17","TNFRSF18","TNFRSF19","TNFRSF21","TNFRSF25","EDA2R"]}
