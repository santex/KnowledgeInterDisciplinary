The equative\ncase has been used in very few languages in history.<!--what about -ago in Latin?--\n> It was used in the Sumerian language.\n\nFor Sumerian, the equative was formed by adding the suffix -gin<sub>7</sub> to\nthe end of a noun phrase: :lugal, \"king\"; lugal-gin<sub>7</sub>, \"kinglike\",\n\"like a king\": :nitah-kalaga; \"mighty man\"; nitah-kalaga-gin<sub>7</sub>, \"like\na mighty man\"\n\nFor Ossetic it is formed by the ending -ау [aw]:\n:фæт, \"arrow\"; фæтау, \"arrowlike\" Ницы фенæгау йæхи акодта, lit. \"nothingseer-\n:like himself made\" (\"[he or she] pretended to see nothing\").\n\nIt is also found in the Turkic Khalaj language and in languages from South\nAmerica like Quechua, Aymara, Uro and Cholón.\n\nWelsh, though it has no equative case of nouns, has an equative degree of\nadjectives.\n\nSireniki Eskimo had an equative (or comparative) case for describing\nsimilarities between nouns.\n\nFinnish has the derivational suffixes -mainen and -lainen that have the same\nmeaning, but form new words rather than functioning as grammatical case\nsuffixes. For example, kuningas ~ kuningasmainen \"king ~ kinglike\".\n\n<!--\n","title":"Equative%20case","headings":["References","See also","External links"]},"micro-relation":["1: Sumerian_language","1: Ossetic_language","1: Khalaj_language","1: Quechua_languages","1: Aymara","1: Uro","1: Cholón","1: Welsh_language","1: Sireniki_Eskimo_language","1: Finnish_language","1: List_of_grammatical_cases"]}
