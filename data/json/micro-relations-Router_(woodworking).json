{"cursor":"15661","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nA 'router' is a tool used to rout out (hollow out) an area in the face of a\nrelatively hard workpiece, typically of wood or plastic. The main application of\nrouters is in woodworking, especially cabinetry.\n\nIt was a tool particularly used by pattern makers and staircase makers and\nconsisted of a broad-based wooden hand plane with a narrow blade projecting well\nbeyond its base plate gaining it the nickname 'Old Woman's Tooth'. Although the\noriginal hand tool has a few advantages over the power tool equivalent and\nretains favour with some workers, since about 1960, it has all but been replaced\nby the modern spindle router, which was designed for the same work, although the\nfirst electric hand routers appeared in the years just after World War I.\n\nFurther refinement produced the plunge router, invented by ELU (now part of\nDeWalt) in Germany in the late 1940s. This is even better adapted for many\ntypes of work. Today, traditional hand-powered routers are often called router\nplanes. Some workers Broun 1989 consider it to be the single most\nversatile woodworking power tool. Modern routers are often used in place of\ntraditional moulding planes or spindle moulder machines for edge decoration\n(moulding) of timber.\n\nRelated to the router is a smaller, lighter version designed specifically for\ntrimming laminates. It can be used for smaller general routing work. For\nexample, with an appropriate jig it can be used for recessing door hinges and\nrecessing lock faceplates.\n","linknr":578,"url":"Router_(woodworking)","recorded":1362543454,"links":28,"instances":["decorative"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Woodworking hand-held power tools","Woodworking tools"],"headings":["Process","Tools and equipment","Moulding","Variety of routers","Features of the modern spindle router","Table mounted router","Available cutters","Versatility","CNC router","Similar tools","See also","Notes","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Wood_router_jmc_2005_03_12.jpg/220px-Wood_router_jmc_2005_03_12.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/33/Makita_plunge_router.jpg/220px-Makita_plunge_router.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f4/Makita_laminate_trimmer.jpg/220px-Makita_laminate_trimmer.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/RouterJig.jpg/220px-RouterJig.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/Router_bit_profiles_en.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/53/Routerbits.jpg/190px-Routerbits.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["molding","decorative"]],"members":["molding"],"related":["Tool","Woodworking","Cabinet_making","Staircase","Hand_plane","Blade","DeWalt","DeWalt","Milling_machine","Type_I_chip","Type_III_chip","Type_II_chip","Swarf","Cutting_tool","Molding_(decorative)","Chamfer","Woodworking_joints","Collet","Electric_motor","Collet","Torque","Wood_shaper","Woodworking_joints","High-speed_steel","Tungsten_carbide","United_States","Jeremy_Broun","CNC_wood_router","Computer-aided_manufacturing","Laminate_trimmer","Wood_shaper","Laminate_trimmer","Biscuit_joiner"]}
