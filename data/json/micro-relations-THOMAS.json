It\nis operated by the Library of Congress and was launched in January 1995 at the\ninception of the 104th Congress. It is a comprehensive, Internet-accessible\nsource of information on the activities of Congress, including:\n\n*Bills & resolutions **The texts of bills and resolutions **Summaries and status\n**Voting results, including how individual members voted *Congressional Record,\nincluding the daily digest *Presidential nominations *Treaties\n\nThe database is named after Thomas Jefferson, who was the third President\nof the United States. It seems there is no reason its name is in all upper-\ncase letters.\n\nAccording to some sources, 'THOMAS' is an acronym for \"The House [of\nRepresentatives] Open Multimedia Access System\", but this text is not apparent\nanywhere in the THOMAS Web site. This explanation may be a backronym.\n\nThe website allows users to share legislative information via several social\nnetworking sites, [http://thomas.loc.gov/help/share.html\nThomas.loc.gov] and there have been proposals for an application\nprogramming interface.
