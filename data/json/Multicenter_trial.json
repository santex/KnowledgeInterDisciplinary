{"cursor":"3168","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nA 'multicenter research trial' is a clinical trial conducted at more than one\nmedical center or clinic. Most large clinical trials, particularly Phase III\ntrials, are conducted at several clinical research centers. The benefits of\nmulticenter trials include a larger number of participants, different geographic\nlocations, the possibility of inclusion of a wider range of population groups,\nand the ability to compare results among centers, all of which increase the\ngeneralizability of the study. In many cases, efficacy will vary significantly\nbetween population groups with different genetic, environmental, and ethnic or\ncultural backgrounds (\"demographic\" factors); normally only geographically\ndispersed trials can properly evaluate this.\n","linknr":169,"url":"Multicenter_trial","recorded":1362505272,"links":15,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Clinical research","Pharmaceutical industry"],"headings":["Competitive enrollment","Set up costs","Expected subject recruitment rate","Additional reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Clinical_trial","Clinical_research","National_Library_of_Medicine"]}
