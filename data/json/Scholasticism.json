It originated as an\noutgrowth of, and a departure from, Christian monastic schools at the earliest\nEuropean universities. See Steven P. Marone, \"Medieval philosophy in\ncontext\" in A. S. McGrade, ed., The Cambridge Companion to Medieval Philosophy\n(Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003). On the difference between\nscholastic and medieval monastic postures towards learning, see Jean Leclercq,\nThe Love of Learning and the Desire for God (New York: Fordham University Press,\n1970) esp. 89; 238ff. The first institutions in the West to be considered\nuniversities were established in Italy, France, Spain and England in the late\n11th and the 12th centuries for the study of arts, law, medicine, and\ntheology, de Ridder-Symoens 1992, pp.\n47â55 such as the University of Salerno, the University of Bologna, and\nthe University of Paris. It is difficult to define the date at which they became\ntrue universities, although the lists of studia generalia for higher education\nin Europe held by the Catholic Church and its various religious orders are a\nuseful guide.\n\nNot so much a philosophy or a theology as a method of learning, scholasticism\nplaces a strong emphasis on dialectical reasoning to extend knowledge by\ninference, and to resolve contradictions. Scholastic thought is also known for\nrigorous conceptual analysis and the careful drawing of distinctions. In the\nclassroom and in writing, it often takes the form of explicit disputation: a\ntopic drawn from the tradition is broached in the form of a question, opponents'\nresponses are given, a counterproposal is argued and opponent's arguments\nrebutted. Because of its emphasis on rigorous dialectical method, scholasticism\nwas eventually applied to many other fields of study.\n\nAs a program, scholasticism began as an attempt at harmonization on the part of\nmedieval Christian thinkers: to harmonize the various authorities of their own\ntradition, and to reconcile Christian theology with classical and late antiquity\nphilosophy, especially that of Aristotle but also of\nNeoplatonism. Particularly through Pseudo-Dionysius, Augustine, and\nBoethius, and through the influence of Plotinus and Proclus on Muslim\nphilosophers. In the case of Aquinas, for instance, see Jan Aertsen, \"Aquinas'\nphilosophy in its historical setting\" in The Cambridge Companion to Aquinas, ed.\nNorman Kretzmann and Eleonore Stump (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press,\n1993). Jean Leclerq, The Love of Learning and the Desire for God (New York:\nFordham University Press, 1970). (See also Christian apologetics.)\n\nSome of the main figures of scholasticism include Anselm of Canterbury, Peter\nAbelard, Alexander of Hales, Albertus Magnus, Duns Scotus, William of Ockham,\nBonaventure and Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas's masterwork [[Summa Theologica]],\nconsidered to be the pinnacle of scholastic, medieval, and Christian\nphilosophy, began while Aquinas was regent master at the\nstudium provinciale of Santa Sabina in Rome, the forerunner of the Pontifical\nUniversity of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum''. Important work in the\nscholastic tradition has been carried on, however, well past Aquinas' time, for\ninstance by Francisco SuÃ¡rez and Luis de Molina, and also among Lutheran and\nReformed thinkers.\n","linknr":1075,"url":"Scholasticism","recorded":1362902891,"links":74,"instances":["education"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Philosophical schools and traditions","Philosophical traditions","Scholasticism|","Christian theological movements","Christianity of the Middle Ages","Thomas Aquinas","Christian terms"],"headings":["Etymology","History","Scholastic method","Scholastic instruction","See also","References","Primary sources","Secondary sources","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/Laurentius_de_Voltolina_001.jpg/250px-Laurentius_de_Voltolina_001.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ad/Medieval-university.jpg/100px-Medieval-university.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cf/Socrates_blue_version2.png/20px-Socrates_blue_version2.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b3/Coat_of_arms_of_the_Vatican_City.svg/20px-Coat_of_arms_of_the_Vatican_City.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["trivium","education"]],"members":["trivium"],"related":["Academics","Medieval_university","Dogma","Monastic","University","Italy","France","Spain","England","Liberal_arts","Law","Medicine","Theology","University_of_Salerno","University_of_Bologna","University_of_Paris","Studium_generale","Catholic_Church","Religious_Order","Dialectical_reasoning","Inference","Contradictions","Disputation","Aristotle","Neoplatonism","Christian_apologetics","Anselm_of_Canterbury","Peter_Abelard","Alexander_of_Hales","Albertus_Magnus","Duns_Scotus","William_of_Ockham","Bonaventure","Thomas_Aquinas","Santa_Sabina","Pontifical_University_of_Saint_Thomas_Aquinas","Francisco_Suárez","Luis_de_Molina","Latin","Latin","Ancient_Greek","School","Carolingian_Renaissance","Early_Middle_Ages","Charlemagne","Peter_of_Pisa","Alcuin_of_York","Ancient_Greek","Monastic_school","Carolingian_Empire","Johannes_Scotus_Eriugena","Peter_Abelard","Lanfranc","Anselm_of_Canterbury","Cappadocian_Fathers","Eastern_Orthodox_Christian_theology","Peter_Abelard","Lanfranc_of_Canterbury","Anselm_of_Canterbury","Transmission_of_Greek_philosophical_ideas_in_the_Middle_Ages","Reconquista","Anselm_of_Laon","Gloss","Dialectic","Trivium_(education)","Abelard","Peter_Lombard","Recovery_of_Aristotle","Adelard_of_Bath","Euclid","William_of_Moerbeke","University","Franciscans","Dominican_Order","Francis_of_Assisi","Bonaventure","Augustine_of_Hippo","Plato","Duns_Scotus","Peter_Auriol","William_of_Ockham","St_Dominic","Recovery_of_Aristotle","Albertus_Magnus","Thomas_Aquinas","Neoplatonism","Averroes","Calvinists","Thomism","Jacques_Maritain","Étienne_Gilson","Second_Vatican_Council","Analytic_philosophy","Anthony_Kenny","Józef_Maria_Bocheński","Peter_King","Thomas_Williams","David_Oderberg","Analytical_Thomism","Sententiae","Dialectic","Philology","Logic","Actus_primus","Aristotelianism","Medieval_philosophy","History_of_science_in_the_Middle_Ages","List_of_scholastic_philosophers","Neo-Scholasticism","Recovery_of_Aristotle","Renaissance_of_the_12th_century","Scotism","Thomism","Nominalism"]}
