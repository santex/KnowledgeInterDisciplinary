{"cursor":"37595","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" John A. Macdonald.]] This article provides a summary of results for the general\n (all seats contested) elections to the House of Commons, the elected lower half\n of Canada's federal bicameral legislative body, the Parliament of Canada. The\n number of seats has increased steadily over time, from 180 for the first\n election to the current total of 308. The current federal government structure\n was established in 1867 by the Constitution Act.\n\nFor federal by-elections (for one or a few seats as a result of retirement,\netc.) see List of federal by-elections in Canada. For the eight general\nelections of the Province of Canada held in 1843 to 1864 before confederation in\n1867, see List of elections in the Province of Canada. There were also earlier\nelections in Canada, such as for the Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada (held\nin 1792â1836, now part of Ontario) and the Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada\n(held in 1792â1834, now part of Quebec).\n\nTwo parties have dominated politics in Canada: the Liberal party and the\nhistoric Conservative party (known as the Progressive Conservative party from\n1943 to 2003). If one regards the modern Conservative party as the successor to\nthe historic one, then these are the only two parties to have formed a\ngovernment, although often as the lead party in a minority or coalition\ngovernment with one or more smaller parties (the 1917 win was by a pro-\nconscription Unionist coalition of former Liberals and Conservatives).\n\nAlthough government has primarily been a two-party system, Canadian federal\npolitics has been a multi-party affair since the 1920s, which saw significant\nparliamentary presence from the Progressive party and the United Farmers\nmovement. They were supplanted by the Social Credit party and the Co-operative\nCommonwealth Federation (CCF) in the 1930s. The CCF evolved into the New\nDemocratic Party (NDP) in 1961. The Social Credit party and the CCF/NDP occupied\nthe 3rd and 4th party slots between them from the 1930s, until the Social Credit\nparty failed to win any seats in the 1980 election.\n\nSince 1980, the NDP has remained a presence in the Canadian parliament, but the\nsituation amongst other non-government parties has been more complex. The\nhistoric Conservative party never recovered from its spectacular defeat in the\n1993 election (when it went from being the majority government with 169 seats,\nto just two seats and the loss of official party status). Right-wing politics\nhas since seen the rise and fall of the Reform party and the Canadian Alliance,\nfollowed by the rise to government of the new Conservative party. Further, 1993\nsaw the first seats won by the separatist Bloc QuÃ©bÃ©cois, which has been a\nconstant presence in the Canadian parliament since then.\n\n{|align=\"center\" \n|- \n|width=3% align=\"left\" valign=\"top\" | |width=42% align=\"left\" valign=\"middle\" |\n__TOC__  |width=55% align=\"right\" valign=\"top\"\n| {| align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" class=\"wikitable\"  !colspan=5 align=center|Party colour key\n|-\n|width=25 |  |width=250|Liberal |width=25 |  |width=175|Reform\n|-\n|| ||New Democrats |Canadian Alliance\n|-\n|| ||Progressive |Conservative\n|-\n|| ||Anti-Confederate |Liberal-Conservative, Conservative (historic), In the 1921 election, the Conservatives ran under the name\n|| |National Liberal and Conservative Party, and in 1940 under the name National\n|| |Government.
