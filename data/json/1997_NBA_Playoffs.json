{"cursor":"37396","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nThe '1997 [[NBA Playoffs]]' was the postseason tournament of the National\nBasketball Association's 1996-97 season. The tournament concluded with the\nEastern Conference champion Chicago Bulls defeating the Western Conference\nchampion Utah Jazz 4 games to 2. This was the Bulls' second straight title, and\nfifth overall (They completed the 3-peat by beating Utah again in 1998). Michael\nJordan was named NBA Finals MVP for the fifth time.\n\nThis was the first Western Conference Title for the Jazz in their 22-\nyear history.\n\nThe Heat's run to the Eastern Conference Finals marked the farthest they had\nreached in the playoffs up to that point; they did not return until 2005, but\nwon the NBA Title in 2006.\n\nThe Minnesota Timberwolves made their playoff debut after failing to win more\nthan 30 games in their first 7 seasons. For them, it was also the first of 7\nstraight years in which they made the playoffs only to lose in the first round.\n\nThis was the first (and so far, only) time since the ABAâNBA merger that the 4\nformer ABA teams (Spurs, Nuggets, Pacers, and Nets) missed the playoffs, even\nmore remarkable considering the rarity with which San Antonio has missed the\nplayoffs (only 4 times as of 2013).\n\nAll four 1988/89 expansion teams (Minnesota, Miami, Orlando and Charlotte) made\nthe playoffs for the first time. This happened again in 2001.\n\nThe two #8 seeds in this tournament (the Bullets and Clippers) broke long\nplayoff droughts (Bullets eight years, Clippers only just three) with their\nappearances in the 1997 Playoffs. (The Bullets' last playoff appearance was in\n1988; the Clippers in 1993). Unfortunately for both teams, it would be a long\ntime before they made the playoffs again; the renamed Wizards made their return\nin 2005; the Clippers in 2006.\n\nThe Bullets qualified by defeating the Cavs in a regular season finale that saw\nboth teams fighting for the #8 seed.\n\nGame 4 of the BullsâHawks series was the last game ever played at The Omni. The\nHawks' home playoff games for 1998 and 1999 were played at the Georgia Dome\nwhile the Omni was demolished to make way for Philips Arena.\n\nThe Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena hosted its final NBA playoff game in Game\n3 of the ClippersâJazz series. When the Clippers returned to the playoffs in\n2006, they had moved to the Staples Center, their home since the 1999â2000\nseason. As of 2012, the Sports Arena remains active.\n\nGame 3 of the BullsâBullets series was the last game ever played at the Capital\nCentre (named USAir Arena at the time). As the Bullets changed their name to\n\"Wizards, and also moved into a new arena the next season, it was also the last\ntime the team was officially named the \"Bullets\".\n","linknr":529,"url":"1997_NBA_Playoffs","recorded":1375078756,"links":["/w/index.php?title=1997_NBA_Playoffs&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=1997_NBA_Playoffs&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:1997NBAPlayoffs.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/00/1997NBAPlayoffs.png/252px-1997NBAPlayoffs.png","/wiki/NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/National_Basketball_Association","/wiki/1996%E2%80%9397_NBA_season","/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)","/wiki/Chicago_Bulls","/wiki/Western_Conference_(NBA)","/wiki/Utah_Jazz","/wiki/1998_NBA_Finals","/wiki/Bill_Russell_NBA_Finals_Most_Valuable_Player_Award","/wiki/2005_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/2006_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves","/wiki/ABA%E2%80%93NBA_merger","/wiki/2001_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/1988_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/1993_NBA_Playoffs","#cite_note-eug211997-1","/wiki/The_Omni","/wiki/1998_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/1999_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/Georgia_Dome","/wiki/Philips_Arena","/wiki/Los_Angeles_Memorial_Sports_Arena","/wiki/Staples_Center","/wiki/1999%E2%80%932000_NBA_season","/wiki/Capital_Centre","#Bracket","#Playoff_qualifying","#Western_Conference","#Best_record_in_conference","#Clinched_a_playoff_berth","#Eastern_Conference","#Best_record_in_NBA","#Clinched_a_playoff_berth_2","#Memorable_moments","#Notes","#Western_Conference_2","#First_Round","#.281.29_Utah_Jazz_vs._.288.29_Los_Angeles_Clippers","#.284.29_Los_Angeles_Lakers_vs._.285.29_Portland_Trail_Blazers","#.282.29_Seattle_SuperSonics_vs._.287.29_Phoenix_Suns","#.283.29_Houston_Rockets_vs._.286.29_Minnesota_Timberwolves","#Conference_Semifinals","#.281.29_Utah_Jazz_vs._.284.29_Los_Angeles_Lakers","#.282.29_Seattle_SuperSonics_vs._.283.29_Houston_Rockets","#Conference_Finals","#.281.29_Utah_Jazz_vs._.283.29_Houston_Rockets","#Eastern_Conference_2","#First_Round_2","#.281.29_Chicago_Bulls_vs._.288.29_Washington_Bullets","#.284.29_Atlanta_Hawks_vs._.285.29_Detroit_Pistons","#.282.29_Miami_Heat_vs._.287.29_Orlando_Magic","#.283.29_New_York_Knicks_vs._.286.29_Charlotte_Hornets","#Conference_Semifinals_2","#.281.29_Chicago_Bulls_vs._.284.29_Atlanta_Hawks","#.282.29_Miami_Heat_vs._.283.29_New_York_Knicks","#Conference_Finals_2","#.281.29_Chicago_Bulls_vs._.282.29_Miami_Heat","#NBA_Finals","#Chicago_Bulls_vs._Utah_Jazz","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=1997_NBA_Playoffs&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=1997_NBA_Playoffs&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=1997_NBA_Playoffs&action=edit&section=3","/w/index.php?title=1997_NBA_Playoffs&action=edit&section=4","/wiki/Utah_Jazz","/w/index.php?title=1997_NBA_Playoffs&action=edit&section=5","/wiki/Utah_Jazz","/wiki/Seattle_SuperSonics","/wiki/Houston_Rockets","/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers","/wiki/Portland_Trail_Blazers","/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves","/wiki/Phoenix_Suns","/wiki/Los_Angeles_Clippers","/w/index.php?title=1997_NBA_Playoffs&action=edit&section=6","/w/index.php?title=1997_NBA_Playoffs&action=edit&section=7","/wiki/Chicago_Bulls","/w/index.php?title=1997_NBA_Playoffs&action=edit&section=8","/wiki/Chicago_Bulls","/wiki/Miami_Heat","/wiki/New_York_Knicks","/wiki/Atlanta_Hawks","/wiki/Detroit_Pistons","/wiki/New_Orleans_Hornets","/wiki/Orlando_Magic","/wiki/Washington_Wizards","/w/index.php?title=1997_NBA_Playoffs&action=edit&section=9","/wiki/Washington_Bullets","#cite_note-nyt1May1997-2","/wiki/Seattle_SuperSonics","/wiki/Phoenix_Suns","/wiki/Rex_Chapman","/wiki/Atlanta_Hawks","/wiki/Utah_Jazz","/wiki/Houston_Rockets","/wiki/Eddie_Johnson_(basketball,_born_1959)","/wiki/John_Stockton","/wiki/Karl_Malone","/wiki/Steve_Kerr","/wiki/Scottie_Pippen","/wiki/Bryon_Russell","/wiki/Toni_Kuko%C4%8D","/w/index.php?title=1997_NBA_Playoffs&action=edit&section=10","/wiki/1992_NBA_Playoffs","/w/index.php?title=1997_NBA_Playoffs&action=edit&section=11","/wiki/Utah_Jazz","/w/index.php?title=1997_NBA_Playoffs&action=edit&section=12","/wiki/Utah_Jazz","/wiki/Los_Angeles_Clippers","/w/index.php?title=1997_NBA_Playoffs&action=edit&section=13","/wiki/1992_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/EnergySolutions_Arena","/wiki/Salt_Lake_City,_Utah","http://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/UTA19970424.html","http://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/UTA19970426.html","/wiki/
