Retrieved on May 9, 2007. He found his passion in writing\nplays, and quickly established himself as a promising young playwright. His\nstage play [[A Few Good Men (play)|A Few Good Men]] caught the attention of\nHollywood producer David Brown, who bought the film rights before the play even\npremiered.\n\nCastle Rock Entertainment hired Sorkin to adapt A Few Good Men for the big\nscreen. The film, directed by Rob Reiner, became a box office success. Sorkin\nspent the early 1990s writing two other screenplays at Castle Rock, [[Malice\n(film)|Malice]] and [[The American President]]. In the mid-1990s he worked as a\nscript doctor on films such as [[Bulworth]]. In 1998 his television career began\nwhen he created the comedy series [[Sports Night]] for the ABC network. The\nsecond season of Sports Night was its last and in 1999 overlapped with the debut\nof Sorkin's next TV series, the political drama [[The West Wing]], this time for\nthe NBC network. The West Wing won multiple Emmy Awards, and continued for three\nmore seasons after he left the show at the end of its fourth season in 2003. He\nreturned to television in 2006 with the dramedy [[Studio 60 on the Sunset\nStrip]], about the backstage drama at a late-night sketch comedy show, once\nagain for the NBC network. While Sorkin's return was met with high expectations\nand a lot of early online buzz before Studio 60s premiere, NBC did not renew it\nafter its first season in which it suffered from low ratings and mixed reception\nin the press and on the Internet. He also wrote the feature film screenplay for\n[[The Social Network]], winning the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay.\n\nAfter more than a decade away from the theatre, Sorkin returned to adapt for the\nstage his screenplay [[The Farnsworth Invention]], which started a workshop run\nat La Jolla Playhouse in February 2007 and which opened on Broadway in December\n2007.\n\nHe was a cocaine addict for many years, but after a highly publicized arrest in\n2001 he received treatment in a drug diversion program and is reported to have\nrecovered. In television, Sorkin is known as a\ncontrolling writer, who rarely shares the credit of penning screenplays. His writing staff are more likely to do research and come up with\nstories for him to tell. His trademark rapid-fire dialogue and extended\nmonologues are complemented, in television, by frequent collaborator Thomas\nSchlamme's characteristic directing technique called the \"walk and talk\". These\nsequences consist of single tracking shots of long duration involving multiple\ncharacters engaging in conversation as they move through the set; characters\nenter and exit the conversation as the shot continues without any cuts.\n","linknr":1422,"url":"Aaron_Sorkin","recorded":1362669712,"links":74,"instances":["drug","author","adapted_screenplay","film","actor","politician","composer","tv_producer","the_west_wing","theatre","book","political_operative","director","united_states","producer"],"pdf":["http://web.archive.org/web/20070128072902/http://www.wgaeast.org/newsletter_and_publications/pdf/onwriting18.pdf","http://www.wgaeast.org/newsletter_and_publications/pdf/onwriting18.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20070128072902/http://www.wgaeast.org/newsletter_and_publications/pdf/onwriting18.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20070128072902/http://www.wgaeast.org/newsletter_and_publications/pdf/onwriting18.pdf","http://www.wgaeast.org/newsletter_and_publications/pdf/onwriting18.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20070128072902/http://www.wgaeast.org/newsletter_and_publications/pdf/onwriting18.pdf"],"categories":["1961
