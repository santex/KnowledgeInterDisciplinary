He is one of the\nfew yachtsmen to have raced round the world non stop in both directions. He held\nthe solo record for sailing round the world westabout (the most challenging\ndirection for circumnavigation) between 1994 and 2000.\n\nGolding, who is a member of Royal Southampton Yacht Club, is the eponymous co\nfounder of the commercial company Mike Golding Yacht Racing Ltd, a professional\nand competitive company whose goals are to compete and win on the water and to\ndeliver. His partner in this venture is Jorgen Philip-Sorensen.\n\nGolding led the team Group 4 to second place in the British Steel Challenge in\n1992â3. He did one better in the next edition the BT Global Challenge 1996â7,\ntaking first place with a new team of amateur sailors, again onboard Group 4.\n\nGolding came seventh in the 2000â2001 VendÃ©e Globe solo non stop round the world\nrace having lost seven days to the dismasting of his Open 60, again called Group\n4. His present Open 60 campaign is sponsored by Ecover, a Belgian ecological\ncleaning products company which has sponsored his team since 2001. In 2004 he\nwon the IMOCA World Championship and successfully defended his title the\nfollowing year, in which he also won the 2005 FICO World Championship. {{\n\ncite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/sailing/6206328.stm\n|publisher=BBC |title=Stamm wins leg as Golding quits |date=December 4, 2006\n\n}} In the 2004 VendÃ©e Globe, Golding finished third despite losing his\nkeel â an extremely serious accident which has caused boats in previous VendÃ©e\nGlobe races to overturn almost instantly â on the last day of the race. He\nsailed the last fifty miles with a tiny sailplan to keep the boat upright. {{ cite web |url=http://www.nautica.it/service/notizie.htm?2005-02-\n35 |publisher=Nautica Online Press |title=Golding's Grit Gets Ecover Home in\nThird |date=2005-02-07 }}\n\nIn October 2006 he started the Velux 5 Oceans yacht race. He courageously\nrescued fellow sailor Alex Thomson in the Southern Ocean, then the yacht Ecover\nhad a mast failure with them both aboard. He announced he was retiring from the\nrace on making emergency landfall in Cape Town. {{\n\ncite web |url=http://www.rsyc.org.uk/club/clubgoldingchampion.html\n|publisher=Royal Southampton Yacht Club |title=World Championship Crown for Mike\n|date=March 10, 2006\n\n}}\n\nIn March 2007 Golding announced a technical partnership with fellow British\nsailor Dee Caffari to allow both the UK entries in the VendÃ©e Globe 2008â9 round\nthe world yacht race to work together. {{\n\ncite web\n|url=http://www.avivaoceanracing.com/index.asp?pageid=6&year=2007&newsid=23\n|publisher=Aviva Ocean Racing |title=Dee Caffari and Mike Golding form a\ntechnical alliance for the 2008 VendÃ©e Globe |date=March 20, 2007\n\n}}\n\nGolding is currently skippering the Ecover Sailing Team in the 2009 iShares cup,\na selection of races all over Europe, sailing catamarans in fast, competitive\nraces against world-leaders in this sport.
