It has offices and facilities in the US, South America, Asia and\nEurope. BioMarin's core business and research is in enzyme replacement therapies\n(ERTs). BioMarin is the first company to provide therapeutics for\nmucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I), by manufacturing laronidase (Aldurazyme,\ncommercialized by Genzyme Corporation). BioMarin is also the first company to\nprovide therapeutics for Phenylketonuria (PKU).\n\nAs of 2005, BioMarin commercialized arylsulfatase B (Naglazyme) as an enzyme\nreplacement therapy for the treatment of mucopolysaccharidosis VI (MPS VI), and\nin 2007 a drug version of tetrahydrobiopterin (Kuvan), the first medication-\nbased intervention to treat phenylketonuria.\n\nIn 2009, BioMarin acquired Huxley Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Huxley), which had\nrights to a proprietary form of 3,4-diaminopyridine (3,4-DAP), amifampridine\nphosphate. In 2010, BioMarin was granted marketing approval by the\nEuropean Commission for 3,4-diaminopyridine (3,4-DAP), amifampridine phosphate\nfor the treatment of the rare autoimmune disease Lambert-Eaton myasthenic\nsyndrome (LEMS). BioMarin launched the product under the name\nFirdapse.\n\nIn 2010, BioMarin acquired LEAD Therapeutics, Inc. (LEAD), a small private drug\ndiscovery and early stage development company with key compound LT-673, an\norally available poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor studied for the\ntreatment of patients with rare, genetically defined cancers. This\nacquisition was followed by the purchase of ZyStor Therapeutics, Inc. (ZyStor),\na privately held biotechnology company developing ERTs for the treatment of\nlysosomal storage disorders and its lead product candidate, ZC-701, a fusion of\ninsulin-like growth factor 2 and alpha glucosidase (IGF2-GAA) in development for\nPompe disease. {{cite news | url =\nhttp://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/stories/2010/08/16/daily28.html| title =\nBioMarin to buy ZyStor for up to $115M | last = Leuty| first = Ron | date = 2010-08-\n17 | accessdate = 2011-02-14 | publisher = San Francisco Business Times }}\nAt its R&D day in October 2010, BioMarin also announced a new program for a\npeptide therapeutic for the treatment of achondroplasia (BMN-111). {{cite\nnews | url = http://torontostar.morningstar.ca/globalhome/industry/news.asp?art-\nicleid=356443| title = BioMarin Highlights Diverse Early-Stage Pipeline at R&D\nDay| last = Andersen| first = Karen| date = 2010-10-21 | accessdate = 2011-02-14\n| publisher = Morningstar}}\n\nIn 2010, BioMarin became involved in controversy\nsurrounding 3,4-Diaminopyridine (3,4-DAP). BioMarin markets a phosphate salt of\n3,4-DAP under the name Firdapse. In 2010, BioMarin was granted exclusive\nlicensing rights to Firdapse for 10 years. As a result, the price of a\nprescribed National Health Service treatment course has increased from Â£1250 for\nthe unlicensed drug to Â£44,000 for Firdapse. The company states that prior to\nits licensing, there was no guaranteed quality control of the product and no way\nof formally monitoring for uncommon side effects through the regulatory\nprocess.\n","linknr":172,"url":"BioMarin","recorded":1362511109,"links":16,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Companies in the NASDAQ Biotechnology Index","Biotechnology companies of the United States","Companies listed on NASDAQ","Novato, California","Technology companies based in the San Francisco Bay Area"],"headings":["References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f8/Biomarin-logo.png/220px-Biomarin-logo.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/Increase2.svg/11px-Increase2.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/Increase2.svg/11px-Increase2.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/Increase2.svg/11px-Increase2.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/Increase2.svg/11px-Increase2.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/Increase2.svg/11px-Increase2.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Public_company","Novato,_CA","USA","Biotechnology","United_States_Dollar","United_States_Dollar","United_States_Dollar","United_States_Dollar","United_States_Dollar","Biotechnology","Novato","California","Enzyme_replacement_therapy","Mucopolysaccharidosis","Aldurazyme","Genzyme","PKU","Arylsulfatase_B","Mucopolysaccharidosis","Tetrahydrobiopterin","Phenylketonuria","Lambert-Eaton_myasthenic_syndrome","LT-673","PARP_inhibitor","3,4-Diaminopyridine","Firdapse","National_Health_Service"]}
