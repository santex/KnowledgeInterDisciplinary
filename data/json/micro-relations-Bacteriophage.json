{"cursor":"29474","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\nA 'bacteriophage' (informally, phage) is a virus that infects and replicates\nwithin bacteria. The term is derived from 'bacteria' and the Greek ÏÎ±Î³Îµá¿Î½\nphagein \"to devour\". Bacteriophage are composed of proteins that encapsulate a\nDNA or RNA genome, and may have relatively simple or elaborate structures. Their\ngenomes may encode as few as four genes, and as many as hundreds of genes. Phage\nreplicate within bacteria following the injection of their genome into the\ncytoplasm. Bacteriophage are among the most common and diverse entities in the\nbiosphere.\n\nPhages are widely distributed in locations populated by bacterial hosts, such as\nsoil or the intestines of animals. One of the densest natural sources for phages\nand other viruses is sea water, where up to 9Ã10 8 virions per\nmilliliter have been found in microbial mats at the surface, and up\nto 70% of marine bacteria may be infected by phages.
