{"cursor":"16229","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\nThe 'Soviet manned lunar programs' were a series of programs pursued by the\nSoviet Union to land a man on the Moon in competition with the United States\nApollo program to achieve the same goal set publicly by President John F.\nKennedy on May 25, 1961. The Soviet government publicly denied participating in\nsuch a competition, but secretly pursued two programs in the 1960s: manned lunar\nflyby missions using Soyuz 7K-L1 (Zond) spacecraft launched with the UR-500K\n(Proton) rocket, and a manned lunar landing using Soyuz 7K-L3 and LK Lander\nspacecraft launched with the N1 rocket. Following the dual American successes of\nthe first manned lunar orbit on December 24â25, 1968 (Apollo 8) and the first\nMoon landing on July 20, 1969 (Apollo 11), and a series of catastrophic N1\nfailures, both Soviet programs were eventually brought to an end: the Proton /\nZond program was canceled in 1970, and the N1 / L3 program was terminated de\nfacto in 1974 and officially canceled in 1976. Details of both Soviet programs\nwere kept secret until 1990, when the government allowed them to be published\nunder the policy of [[glasnost]].\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Soviet_manned_lunar_programs","recorded":1372154918,"links":[],"instances":["spacecraft","moonbase","rocket"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Soviet lunar program|*","Manned space program of the Soviet Union","Cancelled space missions"],"headings":["Early concepts","Launch schedules","Cosmonauts","Moon flyby ''UR-500K(Proton)/L1(Zond)'' program","Moon landing ''N1/L3'' program","Gallery","See also","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["n1","rocket"],["zvezda","moonbase"],["buran","spacecraft"]],"members":["buran","zvezda","n1"],"related":["Soviet_Union","Lunar_landing","United_States","Apollo_program","John_F._Kennedy","Soyuz_7K-L1","Proton_rocket","Soyuz_7K-L3","LK_Lander","N1_(rocket)","Apollo_8","Apollo_11","Moon","Lunar_base","Sergei_Korolyov","TMK","N-1_rocket","Soyuz_11K","Soyuz_spacecraft","Soyuz_A","R-7_Semyorka","Vladimir_Chelomei","Proton_rocket","LK-1","UR-700","LK-700","LK-3","Nikita_Khrushchev","Leonid_Brezhnev","Vladimir_Mikhaylovich_Komarov","Yuri_Gagarin","Soyuz_1","Alexei_Leonov","Soyuz_1","Soyuz_4","Soyuz_5","Soyuz_spacecraft","Soyuz_7K-OK","Apollo_8","Extra-vehicular_activity","Lunar_orbit_rendezvous","Lunokhod_programme","Block_G","Block_D","Low_Earth_orbit","Saturn_V","Kosmos_379","Kosmos_398","Kosmos_434","Kosmos_382","Soyuz_7K-L1E","Krechet","Apollo_11","Soyuz_7K-L1S","Space_station","Moonbase","Zvezda_(moonbase)","Lunokhod","Buran_(spacecraft)","Kuznetsov_Design_Bureau","Apollo_program","Moon_landing","Mockumentary","Soviet_space_program_conspiracy_accusations"]}
