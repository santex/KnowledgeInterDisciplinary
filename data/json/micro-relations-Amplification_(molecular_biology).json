{"cursor":"12591","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Gene duplication' (or 'chromosomal duplication' or 'gene amplification') is a\nmajor mechanism through which new genetic material is generated during molecular\nevolution. It can be defined as any duplication of a region of DNA that contains\na gene; it may occur as an error in homologous recombination, a\nretrotransposition event, or duplication of an entire chromosome. The second copy of the gene is often free from\nselective pressure â that is, mutations of it have no deleterious effects to its\nhost organism. Thus it accumulates mutations faster than a functional single-\ncopy gene, over generations of organisms.\n\nA duplication is the opposite of a deletion. Duplications arise from an event\ntermed unequal crossing-over that occurs during meiosis between misaligned\nhomologous chromosomes.The chance of this happening is a function of the degree\nof sharing of repetitive elements between two chromosomes. The product of this\nrecombination are a duplication at the site of the exchange and a reciprocal\ndeletion. http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3562\n","linknr":372,"url":"Amplification_(molecular_biology)","recorded":1362580696,"links":35,"instances":["genetics","gene","gene"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Molecular evolution","Molecular genetics","Mutation"],"headings":["Gene duplication as an evolutionary event","Gene duplication as amplification","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/72/Gene-duplication.png/200px-Gene-duplication.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b3/EvolutionOfDuplicateGenes.png/500px-EvolutionOfDuplicateGenes.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["deletion","genetics"],["homology","biology#homology_of_sequences_in_genetics"],["myb","gene"],["ccne","gene"]],"members":["homology","deletion","myb","ccne"],"related":["Molecular_evolution","DNA","Gene","Homologous_recombination","Retrotransposon","Purifying_selection","Mutation","Deletion_(genetics)","Unequal_crossing-over","Evolution","Susumu_Ohno","Common_descent","Polyploidy","Yeast","Genome","Plant","Wheat","Polyploid","Notothenioidei","Protein","Speciation","Species","Transposable_elements","Divergent_evolution","Gene_conversion","Low_copy_repeats","Chromosome_regions","Subtelomeric","Chromosome_regions","Non-allelic_homologous_recombination","Rett_syndrome","Pelizaeus-Merzbacher_disease","Molecular_genetics","Gene","Polymerase_chain_reaction","DNA","Enzymes","Somatic_cell","Germline","Microarrays","Genomic","Microarray","Gene_expression","Gene_regulation","Speciation","Oncogenes","Cancer","Breast_cancer","MYC","ERBB2","CCND1","Cyclin_D1","FGFR1","FGFR2","Cervical_cancer","MYC","ERBB2","Colorectal_cancer","HRAS","KRAS","MYB_(gene)","Esophageal_cancer","MYC","CCND1","MDM2","Gastric_cancer","CCNE_(gene)","Cyclin_E","KRAS","C-Met","Glioblastoma","ERBB1","Epidermal_growth_factor_receptor","CDK4","Head_and_neck_cancer","CCND1","ERBB1","MYC","Hepatocellular_cancer","CCND1","Neuroblastoma","MYCN","Ovarian_cancer","MYC","ERBB2","AKT2","Sarcoma","MDM2","CDK4","Small_cell_lung_cancer","MYC","Pseudogenes","Molecular_evolution","Unequal_crossing_over","Human_genome","Comparative_genomics","Inparanoid","Tandem_exon_duplication"]}
