At least nominally, most prisons became correctional institutions,\nand guards became correctional officers.<ref name=\"WhiteheadJones2008\"></ref>\nAlthough the corrections-related terminology continued thereafter in US\ncorrectional practice, the philosophical view on offenders' treatment took an\nopposite turn in the 1980s, when the \"get tough\" program was labeled by\nacademics as \"The New Penology\".<ref></ref>\n","title":"corrections","headings":["Sentences","Theories","See also","References","Further reading"]},"micro-relation":["2: Punishment","2: Probation","2: Bryan_A._Garner","2: Prison","1: Texas_Department_of_Criminal_Justice","1: Huntsville,_Texas","1: Central_Jail_Faisalabad","1: Faisalabad","1: Pakistan","1: Criminal_justice","1: North_America","1: Umbrella_term","1: Government_agency","1: Therapy","1: Supervisor","1: Conviction","1: Crime","1: Imprisonment","1: Parole","1: Jurisdiction","1: Criminal_justice_system","1: Police","1: Prosecution","1: Court","1: Provincial_correctional_services_in_Canada","1: Department_of_Corrections","1: List_of_academic_disciplines","1: Penology","1: Corporal_punishment","1: Cat-o'-nine-tails","1: Correctional_Service_of_Canada","1: Halfway_house","1: Community_service#Alternative_sentencing","1: Home_confinement","1: Electronic_monitoring","1: Asset_forfeiture","1: Restitution","1: Direct_supervision_model","1: Prison_officers","1: American_Correctional_Association","1: Death_penalty","1: Individual_rights","1: National_Commission_on_Correctional_Health_Care","1: National_Institute_of_Corrections","1: National_Law_Enforcement_and_Corrections_Technology_Center","1: National_Prison_Rape_Elimination_Commission","1: Social_control","1: United_States_Bureau_of_Justice_Statistics","1: Juvenile_delinquency","1: Juvenile_Justice_and_Delinquency_Prevention_Act","1: Office_of_Juvenile_Justice_and_Delinquency_Prevention"]}
