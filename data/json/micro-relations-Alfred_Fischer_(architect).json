{"cursor":"5127","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Alfred Fischer' (29 August 1881 - 10 April 1950) was a German architect.\n\nBorn in Stuttgart, Alfred Fischer studied from 1900 to 1904 at the Stuttgart\nTechnical University of Architecture under Professor Theodor Fischer (no\nrelation). In 1904 he deferred the 1st State examination and from 1905/1906\nworked in Berlin as an assistant for the urban design consultant Ludwig Hoffmann\nand from 1906 to 1908 with Paul Schultze-Naumburg. In 1909 he became a teacher\nat the College of Arts and Crafts in DÃ¼sseldorf (Kunstgewerbeschule DÃ¼sseldorf)\nunder Wilhelm Kreis. From 1911 to 1933 he led the Essen Arts and Crafts School\n(later called the Folkwangschule). In 1921 he was awarded a professorship. In\n1929 he was awarded an Engineering doctorate from the Hannover Technical\nUniversity.\n\nFischer was a member of the German Architects Federation (Bund Deutscher\nArchitekten - BDA) and an executive member of the Deutscher Werkbund (DWB).\nApart from his teaching activity he worked freelance as an architect, for some\nyears in partnership with the architect Richard Speidel.\n\nAfter the change of power in 1933 to the Nazis, as an advocate of modern\narchitecture (see Neue Sachlichkeit, modernism, Bauhaus) and modern training\nconcepts, he experienced increasing difficulties with the school. He was given\ntime off and soon after moved into premature retirement. Fischer left Essen and\nmoved to Murnau.\n\nThe Ruhrgebiet has Alfred Fischer to thank for numerous buildings, important\nexamples of regional architectural history and also a legacy of acknowledged\ncontributions to industrial culture.\n\nThe title 'Alfred Fischer-Essen' has been given to him to distinguish him from\nthe architect Alfred Fischer who was active at the same time in Karlsruhe. He\ndied at Murnau am Staffelsee in 1950.\n","linknr":141,"url":"Alfred_Fischer_(architect)","recorded":1362579498,"links":13,"instances":["architect"],"pdf":[],"categories":["1881 births","1950 deaths","People from Stuttgart","German architects"],"headings":["Buildings","Sources","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["ludwig_hoffmann","architect"]],"members":["ludwig_hoffmann"],"related":["Stuttgart","Theodor_Fischer","Ludwig_Hoffmann_(architect)","Paul_Schultze-Naumburg","Düsseldorf","Kunstgewerbeschule","Wilhelm_Kreis","Folkwangschule","Bund_Deutscher_Architekten","Deutscher_Werkbund","Nazi","Neue_Sachlichkeit","Modernist_architecture","Bauhaus","Ruhrgebiet","Karlsruhe","Murnau_am_Staffelsee","Zeche_Mont_Cenis","Herne,_Germany","Zeche_Königin_Elisabeth","Essen","Zeche_Sachsen","Hamm","Essen","Power_station","Vorgebirgszentrale","Bernhard_Goldenberg","Kraftwerk_Goldenberg","RWE_AG","Hürth","Hürth-Knapsack","Pumping_plant","Alte_Emscher","Duisburg","Hamborn","Beeck","Gelsenkirchen","Essen","Essen","Duisburg","Meiderich","Castrop-Rauxel","Gelsenkirchen","Zeche_Königsborn","Bönen","Essen","Duisburg","Hamborn","Essen","Richard_Hessberg","Essen","Regionalverband_Ruhr","Essen","Lyseum","High_School","Essen","Essen"]}
