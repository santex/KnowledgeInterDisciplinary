{"cursor":"9567","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Incubation period' is the time elapsed between exposure to a pathogenic\norganism, a chemical or radiation, and when symptoms and signs are first\napparent. In a typical infectious disease, incubation period signifies the\nperiod taken by the multiplying organism to reach a threshold necessary to\nproduce symptoms in host.\n\n\nWhile 'latent' or 'latency period' may be synonymous, a distinction is sometimes\nmade between 'incubation period', the period between infection and clinical\nonset of the disease, and 'latent period', the time from infection to\ninfectiousness. Which is shorter depends on the disease. A person may be a\ncarrier of a disease, such as [[Streptococcus]] in the throat, without\nexhibiting any symptoms. Depending on the disease, the person may or may not be\ncontagious during the incubation period.\n\nDuring clinical latency, an infection is subclinical. With respect to viral\ninfections, in clinical latency the virus is actively replicating. Sharara, A.I., Chronic hepatitis C, Southern Medical Journal,\n1997, 90(9):872â7. This is in contrast to viral latency, a form of\ndormancy in which the virus does not replicate. An example of clinical latency\nis HIV infection. HIV may at first have no symptoms and show no signs of AIDS,\ndespite HIV replicating in the lymphatic system and rapidly accumulating a large\nviral load. These persons may be infectious.\n","linknr":246,"url":"Incubation_period","recorded":1362566934,"links":42,"instances":["disease","biology","epidemiology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Epidemiology"],"headings":["Intrinsic and extrinsic incubation period","Determining factors","Examples of incubation periods","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/04/Concept_of_incubation_period.svg/220px-Concept_of_incubation_period.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["vector","epidemiology"],["host","biology"],["host","biology"],["kuru","disease"]],"members":["kuru","host","vector"],"related":["Time","Pathogenic","Organism","Chemical","Ionizing_radiation","Symptoms","Contagious_disease","Subclinical","Viral_infection","Viral_latency","Dormancy","HIV","AIDS","Lymphatic_system","Viral_load","Infection","Vector_(epidemiology)","Host_(biology)","Host_(biology)","Cellulitis","Pasteurella_multocida","Chickenpox","Cholera","Fifth_disease","Influenza","Common_cold","Mayo_Clinic","Dengue_fever","Ebola_virus_disease","Exanthema_subitum","HIV","Infectious_mononucleosis","BBC","Kuru_(disease)","Marburg_virus_disease","Measles","Mumps","Norovirus","Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention","Pertussis","Poliomyelitis","GPnotebook","Rocky_Mountain_spotted_fever","Rubella","Scarlet_fever","Medscape","Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome","World_Health_Organization","Smallpox","Tetanus","Quarantine","Prodrome","Window_period"]}
