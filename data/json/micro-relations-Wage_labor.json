{"cursor":"14990","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Wage labour' (or 'wage labor' in American English) is the socioeconomic\nrelationship between a worker and an employer, where the worker sells their\nlabour under a formal or informal employment contract. : \"All labor\ncontracts were/are designed legally to bind a worker in one way or another to\nfulfill the labor obligations the worker has undertaken. That is one of the\nprincipal purposes of labor contracts.\" These transactions usually occur\nin a labour market where wages are market determined. ., defines wage\nlabour succinctly as \"the labour of the worker who sells his own labour-\npower.\" In exchange for the wages paid, the work product generally becomes\nthe undifferentiated property of the employer, except for special cases such as\nthe vesting of intellectual property patents in the United States where patent\nrights are usually vested in the original personal inventor. A 'wage labourer'\nis a person whose primary means of income is from the selling of his or her\nlabour in this way.\n\nIn modern mixed economies such as those of the OECD countries, it is currently\nthe dominant form of work arrangement. Although most work occurs following this\nstructure, the wage work arrangements of CEOs, professional employees, and\nprofessional contract workers are sometimes conflated with class assignments, so\nthat \"wage labour\" is considered to apply only to unskilled, semi-skilled or\nmanual labour.\n","linknr":584,"url":"Wage_labor","recorded":1362685722,"links":29,"instances":["journal","economics"],"pdf":["http://www.compas.ox.ac.uk/fileadmin/files/Publications/working_papers/WP_2009/WP0966%20Steinfeld.pdf","http://www.compas.ox.ac.uk/fileadmin/files/Publications/working_papers/WP_2009/WP0966%20Steinfeld.pdf"],"categories":["Capitalism","Labor economics","Marxist theory","Socialism","Sociology index"],"headings":["Types","Criticisms","See also","Footnotes","Bibliography","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c7/SNA_segment.png/180px-SNA_segment.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["labour","economics"],["philosophy","journal"]],"members":["philosophy","labour"],"related":["American_English","Socioeconomics","Workforce","Employment","Labour_economics","Contract","Labour_market","Wage","Work_for_hire","Intellectual_property","Freelancer","OECD","CEO","Working_class","Manual_labour","Self-employment","Apprenticeship","Indentured_labour","Forced_labour","Slavery","Serfdom","Piecework","Stock_options","Shares","Subcontracting","Means_of_production","Socialism","Worker_self-management","Economic_democracy","Anarchists","Libertarian_socialists","Privatism","Private_property","Personal_property","Exploitation","Red_herring","Inequality_of_bargaining_power","Frederick_Douglass","William_Wells_Brown","Chattel_slavery","George_Fitzhugh","Karl_Marx","Surplus-value","Anarcho-Syndicalism","Capitalist_mode_of_production","Child_labour","Eight-hour_day","Full_Employment","Immiseration_thesis","Labour_(economics)","Labour_theory_of_value","Marx's_theory_of_alienation","Marxian_economics","Reserve_army_of_labour","Rate_of_exploitation","Surplus_value","Unfree_labour","Wage_slavery","Working_class","Working_poor","Journal_of_Southern_History","Social_Forces","Philosophy_(journal)","Labour/Le_Travail","University_of_Oxford","Oxford_University_Press","Jonathan_Cape","Faber_and_Faber","Capital,_Volume_I","Penguin_Classics","Verso_Books","Cambridge_University_Press"]}
