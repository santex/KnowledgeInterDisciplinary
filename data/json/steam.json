{"cursor":"10487","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n{{stack| in Yellowstone Park]]\n\n enthalpy-versus-entropy diagram for steam]] }}\n\n'Steam' is the technical term for water vapor, the gaseous phase of water, which\nis formed when water boils. Water vapor cannot be seen, though in common\nlanguage it is often used to refer to the visible mist of water droplets formed\nas this water vapor condenses in the presence of cooler air. Strictly speaking,\nin terms of the chemistry and physics, true steam is invisible. At lower\npressures, such as in the upper atmosphere or at the top of high mountains water\nboils at a lower temperature than the nominal at standard temperature and\npressure. If heated further it becomes superheated steam.\n\nThe enthalpy of vaporization is the energy required to turn water into the\ngaseous form when it increases in volume by 1,600 times at standard temperature\nand pressure; this change in volume can be converted into mechanical work by\nsteam engines and steam turbines. Steam engines played a central role to the\nIndustrial Revolution and modern steam turbines are used to generate\nelectricity. If liquid water comes in contact with a very hot substance (such as\nlava, or molten metal) it can create a steam explosion. Steam explosions have\nbeen responsible for many foundry accidents, and may also have been responsible\nfor much of the damage to the plant in the Chernobyl accident.\n","linknr":282,"url":"steam","recorded":1362557453,"links":67,"instances":["microbiology","physics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Forms of water","Water in gas","Steam power|"],"headings":["Types of steam and conversion","Uses","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/Steam_phase_eruption_of_Castle_Geyser.jpg/300px-Steam_phase_eruption_of_Castle_Geyser.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8b/TS-Wasserdampf_engl.png/300px-TS-Wasserdampf_engl.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2e/HS-Wasserdampf_engl.png/300px-HS-Wasserdampf_engl.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Mollier_enthalpy_entropy_chart_for_steam_-_US_units.svg/300px-Mollier_enthalpy_entropy_chart_for_steam_-_US_units.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/64/Pressure-enthalpy_chart_for_steam%2C_in_US_units.svg/300px-Pressure-enthalpy_chart_for_steam%2C_in_US_units.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/63/Temperature-entropy_chart_for_steam%2C_US_units.svg/300px-Temperature-entropy_chart_for_steam%2C_US_units.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/59/Dampfspeicherlok_Genthin_Henkel_Werk.jpg/220px-Dampfspeicherlok_Genthin_Henkel_Werk.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["work","physics"],["sterilization","microbiology"]],"members":["sterilization","work"],"related":["Yellowstone_Park","Mollier_diagram","Water_vapor","Gaseous_phase","Water","Boiling","Mist","Condenses","Air","Upper_atmosphere","Standard_temperature_and_pressure","Superheated_steam","Enthalpy_of_vaporization","Volume","Work_(physics)","Steam_engine","Steam_turbine","Industrial_Revolution","Electricity","Lava","Steam_explosion","Chernobyl_accident","Vapor-liquid_equilibrium","Superheated_steam","Boiling_point","Steam_table","Phase_diagram","Mollier_diagram","Agriculture","Soil_steam_sterilization","Steam_shower","Electricity_generation","Working_fluid","Steam_turbine","Cogeneration","District_heating","New_York_City_steam_system","Manhattan","Energy_storage","Heat_of_vaporization","Steam_locomotive","Process_steam","Paper_mill","Lifting_gas","Steam_engine","Steam_turbines","Piston","Turbine","Mechanical_work","Condensation","Energy_conversion_efficiency","Thermodynamic_cycle","Rankine_cycle","Autoclave","Sterilization_(microbiology)","Piping","Electrification","Food_steamer","Geyser","IAPWS","Industrial_Revolution","Live_steam","Mass_production","Nuclear_power","Power_plant","Oxyhydrogen","Psychrometrics","Steam_locomotive"]}
