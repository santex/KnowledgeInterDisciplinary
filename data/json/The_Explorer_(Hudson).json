The\nschool sits on a campus that has been developed to include a variety of athletic\nfields, such as six tennis courts, a lighted baseball field, and a track. The\nhigh school football stadium is a new, privately funded stadium with 6,000 seats\nlocated on the high school's current campus replacing the 3000-seat Lavelli\nField at the old high school. This new turf field, now known as Hudson Memorial\nField, is dedicated by the Murdough Family in honor of all the men and women,\nincluding those of Hudson, who have sacrificed their lives in war.
