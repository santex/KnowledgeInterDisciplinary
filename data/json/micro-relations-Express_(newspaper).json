{"cursor":"2173","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\n'Express' is a free daily newspaper distributed in the Washington, D.C.\nmetropolitan area. It is in a tabloid format and is printed every weekday and\ndistributed at Washington Metro stations and other locations throughout the\nWashington metropolitan area. It is owned and printed by The Washington Post\nCompany, but few of the hard news stories are written by [[The Washington\nPost|Washington Post]] staff. Many stories and pictures come from the Associated\nPress, the Christian Science Monitor, Getty Images and other wire sources. The\nfeatures and entertainment part of the paper uses a number of reporters and\nboasts its own Web site, \"Express Night Out\". The newspaper is financed solely\nby advertising. Express debuted August 5, 2003.\n\nExpress does not have an opinion section or letters to the editor, and has\ntraditionally never taken a political stance, unlike other newspapers in the\nlocal market, including The Washington Post, The Washington Times, The\nWashington Examiner and Politico, each of which have an opinion section.\n\nThe paper launched a redesign on November 30, 2009 which emphasized a more magazine-\nstyle front page, along with a daily cover story. In August 2010, the paper\nlaunched a mobile app, [http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dc-rider/id382298536?mt=8\nDC Rider], which is available for iOS (iPhone and iPod touch) and\n[https://market.android.com/details?id=dcrider.views Android] devices.\n","linknr":173,"url":"Express_(newspaper)","recorded":1362555901,"links":20,"instances":["newspaper_format"],"pdf":[],"categories":["The Washington Post","Newspapers published in Washington, D.C.","Free daily newspapers"],"headings":["See also","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/StreetpaperVendor.jpg/150px-StreetpaperVendor.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf8/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Express_Machine.jpg/150px-Express_Machine.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf8/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2a/Newspaper.svg/30px-Newspaper.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/Flag_of_Washington%2C_D.C..svg/30px-Flag_of_Washington%2C_D.C..svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["tabloid","newspaper_format"]],"members":["tabloid"],"related":["Washington,_D.C.","Washington_Metropolitan_Area","Tabloid_(newspaper_format)","Washington_Metro","The_Washington_Post_Company","Associated_Press","Christian_Science_Monitor","Getty_Images","The_Washington_Post","The_Washington_Times","The_Washington_Examiner","Politico"]}
