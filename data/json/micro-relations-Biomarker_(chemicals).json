Essentially, they are complex carbon-based molecules\nderived from formerly living organisms. Wang, Z.; Stout, S.; Fingas, M.\nEnvironmental Forensics, 2006 7, 105-146. Biomarker compounds are\ntypically analyzed using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. Some examples\nof biomarkers found in petroleum are pristane, phytane, steranes, triterpanes\nand porphyrin. Geologists and Geochemists utilize biomarkers traces found in\ncrude oils and their related source rock to unravel the stratigraphic origin and\nmigration pathways of presently existing petroleum deposits.
