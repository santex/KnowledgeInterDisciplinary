{"cursor":"2612","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'English Nature' was the United Kingdom government agency that promoted the\nconservation of wildlife, geology and wild places throughout England between\n1990 and 2006. It was a non-departmental public body funded by the Department\nfor Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) and gave statutory advice,\ngrants and licences.\n\nThe Nature Conservancy Council (NCC) (formerly the Nature Conservancy) was\nestablished by the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949 to\ncover nature conservation issues across the whole of Great Britain. The NCC was\nsplit into four by the Environmental Protection Act 1990âits English duties\nbeing given to English Nature. In Scotland, its functions were merged with those\nof the Countryside Commission for Scotland to form Scottish Natural Heritage,\nand similarly in Wales there was a merger to form the Countryside Council for\nWales. A much smaller body, the Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC),\nsupported all three agencies. The English functions of the Countryside\nCommission went to the newly formed Countryside Agency.\n\nEnglish Nature worked closely with the JNCC and the equivalent bodies for\nScotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland (the Northern Ireland Environment Agency)\nto bring a consistent approach to nature conservation throughout the United\nKingdom and towards fulfilling its international obligations.\n\nThe agency ceased to exist in October 2006 following a review by Lord Haskins,\nenacted in the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act\n2006. [http://www.defra.gov.uk/rural/ruraldelivery/bill/ Natural Environment\nand Rural Communities Act 2006] It was integrated with parts of both the\nRural Development Service and the Countryside Agency from 1 October 2006, to\nform a new body called Natural England.\n","linknr":103,"url":"English_Nature","recorded":1375085062,"links":["/w/index.php?title=English_Nature&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=English_Nature&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Executive_agency","/wiki/Conservation_(ethic)","/wiki/Wildlife","/wiki/Geology","/wiki/Non-departmental_public_body","/wiki/Department_for_Environment,_Food_and_Rural_Affairs","/wiki/Nature_Conservancy_Council","/wiki/National_Parks_and_Access_to_the_Countryside_Act_1949","/wiki/Nature_conservation","/wiki/Great_Britain","/wiki/Environmental_Protection_Act_1990","/wiki/Countryside_Commission_for_Scotland","/wiki/Scottish_Natural_Heritage","/wiki/Countryside_Council_for_Wales","/wiki/Joint_Nature_Conservation_Committee","/wiki/Countryside_Commission","/wiki/Countryside_Agency","/wiki/Northern_Ireland_Environment_Agency","/wiki/Christopher_Haskins","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Rural_Development_Service","/wiki/Countryside_Agency","/wiki/Natural_England","/w/index.php?title=English_Nature&action=edit&section=1","http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/","http://www.english-nature.org.uk/special/nnr/nnr_what.htm","/w/index.php?title=English_Nature&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-1","http://www.defra.gov.uk/rural/ruraldelivery/bill/","http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3241107.stm","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=English_Nature&oldid=542970216","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Organizations_established_in_1990","/wiki/Category:Government_agencies_disestablished_in_2006","/wiki/Category:Conservation_in_England","/wiki/Category:Defunct_public_bodies_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Category:English_Nature","/wiki/Category:Defunct_organisations_of_England","/wiki/Category:1990_establishments_in_England","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=English+Nature&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=English+Nature","/wiki/English_Nature","/wiki/Talk:English_Nature","#","/wiki/English_Nature","/w/index.php?title=English_Nature&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=English_Nature&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf8/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/English_Nature","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/English_Nature","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=English_Nature&oldid=542970216","/w/index.php?title=English_Nature&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=English_Nature&id=542970216","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=English+Nature","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=English+Nature&oldid=542970216&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=English_Nature&printable=yes","//fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Nature","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3054296#sitelinks","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Nature","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf8/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","/w/index.php?title=MediaWiki:Gadget-ReferenceTooltips.js&action=raw&ctype=text/javascript&508635914","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":["ethic"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Organizations
