Many of his former graduate students have gone on to\nwin the Nobel Memorial Prize themselves. Arrow's impact on the economics\nprofession has been tremendous. For more than fifty years he has been one of the\nmost influential of all practicing economists.\n\nHis most significant works are his contributions to social choice theory,\nnotably \"Arrow's impossibility theorem\", and his work on general equilibrium\nanalysis. He has also provided foundational work in many other areas of\neconomics, including endogenous growth theory and the economics of information.\n\nArrow remains active on the international scene through a variety of initiatives\nincluding trustee of Economists for Peace and Security and a member of the\nAdvisory Board of Incentives for Global Health, the not-for-profit behind the\nHealth Impact Fund.\n","linknr":876,"url":"Kenneth_J._Arrow","recorded":1362538301,"links":70,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/82/2/PHCBP.pdf","http://www.policonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/The-Existence-of-an-Equilibrium-for-a-Competitive-Economy.pdf","http://www.policonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/The-Existence-of-an-Equilibrium-for-a-Competitive-Economy.pdf","http://sws1.bu.edu/ellisrp/EC387/Papers/1963Arrow_AER.pdf","http://www.econ.ucsb.edu/~tedb/Courses/UCSBpf/readings/ArrowNonMktActivity1969.pdf","http://socsci2.ucsd.edu/~aronatas/project/academic/Arrow%20on%20meth.%20indiv.pdf","http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterA.pdf","http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterA.pdf"],"categories":["National Medal of Science laureates","Nobel laureates in Economics","John von Neumann Theory Prize winners","Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences","Members of the Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences","Foreign Members of the Royal Society","Fellows of the American Statistical Association","Fellows of the Econometric Society","American people of Romanian-Jewish descent","Voting theorists","Game theorists","General equilibrium theorists","Mathematical economists","International Panel on Climate Change lead authors","American Nobel laureates","American political theorists","Stanford University Department of Economics faculty","Columbia University alumni","City University of New York alumni","Jewish American scientists","University of Chicago faculty","American social democrats","1921 births","Living people","Presidents of the Econometric Society","Fellows of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences","20th-century economists"],"headings":["Education","Academic career","Theorems","Awards and honors","Works","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9d/Kenneth_Arrow%2C_Stanford_University.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Neoclassical_economics","Jewish","United_States","Stanford_University","Microeconomics","General_equilibrium_theory","Social_choice_theory","Columbia_University","City_College_of_New_York","Alfred_Tarski","Harold_Hotelling","Amartya_Sen","Allan_Gibbard","John_Harsanyi","Roger_Myerson","Michael_Spence","Eric_S._Maskin","Nancy_Stokey","Karl_Shell","Anthony_Downs","General_equilibrium","Fundamental_theorems_of_welfare_economics","Arrow's_impossibility_theorem","Endogenous_growth_theory","John_Bates_Clark_Medal","Nobel_Prize_in_Economics","Von_Neumann_Theory_Prize","National_Medal_of_Science","Economist","Nobel_Memorial_Prize_in_Economics","John_Hicks","Neo-classical_economics","Social_choice_theory","Arrow's_impossibility_theorem","General_equilibrium","Endogenous_growth_theory","Asymmetric_information","Economists_for_Peace_and_Security","Health_Impact_Fund","Romania","Jews","Townsend_Harris_High_School","Bachelor's_degree","City_College_of_New_York","Sigma_Phi_Epsilon","Columbia_University","Master's_degree","Cowles_Commission_for_Research_in_Economics","University_of_Chicago","Doctor_of_Philosophy","Anita_Summers","Lawrence_Summers","Robert_Summers","Paul_Samuelson","Donna_Lynne_Champlin","Stanford_University","Pontifical_Academy_of_Social_Sciences","Economists_for_Peace_and_Security","Intergovernmental_Panel_on_Climate_Change","Annual_Review_of_Economics","Eric_Maskin","John_Harsanyi","Michael_Spence","Roger_Myerson","Robert_Solow","Doctor_of_Philosophy","Arrow's_impossibility_theorem","Welfare_economics","Justice","Amartya_Sen","Liberal_paradox","Pareto_optimality","GÃ©rard_Debreu","Lipschitz_continuity","Welfare_economics","Endogenous_growth_theory","Exogenous","Endogenous","Asymmetric_information","Warranty","Authentication","American_Academy_of_Arts_and_Sciences","National_Medal_of_Science","Extended_sympathy","Arrow_information_paradox","Learning_by_doing","List_of_economists","List_of_Jewish_Nobel_laureates","List_of_think_tanks","Florida_Atlantic_University","Economics","Democratic_Socialist_Organizing_Committee","Irving_Howe"]}
