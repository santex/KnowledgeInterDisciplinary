Increased\ncholesterol levels have been associated with cardiovascular diseases,\nand statins are therefore used in the prevention of these diseases. Research has\nfound that statins are most effective for treating cardiovascular disease (CVD)\n(secondary prevention), with questionable benefit in those without previous CVD,\nbut with elevated cholesterol levels. Statins have rare but severe adverse effects, particularly\nmuscle damage, and some doctors believe they are overprescribed.\n\nThe best-selling statin is atorvastatin, marketed as Lipitor (manufactured by\nPfizer) and Torvast. By 2003, atorvastatin became the best-selling\npharmaceutical in history, with Pfizer reporting sales of\nUS$12.4 billion in 2008.

As of 2010, a number of statins are on the market:\natorvastatin (Lipitor and Torvast), fluvastatin (Lescol), lovastatin (Mevacor,\nAltocor, Altoprev), pitavastatin (Livalo, Pitava), pravastatin (Pravachol,\nSelektine, Lipostat), rosuvastatin (Crestor) and simvastatin (Zocor, Lipex). Several combination preparations of a statin and another\nagent, such as ezetimibe/simvastatin, are also available.\n","linknr":1244,"url":"Statin","recorded":1362505222,"links":167,"instances":["biochemist","nutrition","biochemistry"],"pdf":["http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/live/11982/40675/40675.pdf","http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/live/11982/40675/40675.pdf","http://media.pfizer.com/files/annualreport/2008/annual/review2008.pdf","http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/live/11982/40689/40689.pdf","http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/live/11982/40689/40689.pdf","http://jama.ama-assn.org/content/292/21/2585.full.pdf","http://jama.ama-assn.org/content/292/21/2585.full.pdf","http://content.nejm.org/cgi/reprint/NEJMoa0807646v1.pdf","http://content.nejm.org/cgi/reprint/NEJMoa0807646v1.pdf"],"categories":["Statins|"],"headings":["Medical
