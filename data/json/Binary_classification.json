{"cursor":"12608","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Binary' or 'binomial classification' is the task of classifying the members of\na given set of objects into two groups on the basis of whether they have some\nproperty or not. Some typical binary classification tasks are\n\n* medical testing to determine if a patient has certain disease or not (the\n  classification property is the presence of the disease)\n* quality control in factories; i.e. deciding if a new product is good enough to\n  be sold, or if it should be discarded (the classification property is being\n  good enough)\n* deciding whether a page or an article should be in the result set of a search\n  or not (the classification property is the relevance of the article, or the\n  usefulness to the user)\n\nStatistical classification in general is one of the problems studied in computer\nscience, in order to automatically learn classification systems; some methods\nsuitable for learning binary classifiers include the decision trees, Bayesian\nnetworks, support vector machines, and neural networks.\n\nSometimes, classification tasks are trivial. Given 100 balls, some of them red\nand some blue, a human with normal color vision can easily separate them into\nred ones and blue ones. However, some tasks, like those in practical medicine,\nand those interesting from the computer science point-of-view, are far from\ntrivial, and may produce faulty results if executed imprecisely.\n","linknr":167,"url":"Binary_classification","recorded":1362480338,"links":20,"instances":["reference_value","tests","tests","image_processing","mathematics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Statistical classification","Machine learning"],"headings":["Hypothesis testing","Evaluation of binary classifiers","Measuring a classifier with sensitivity and specificity","Converting continuous values to binary","See also","Bibliography"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Binary-classification-labeled.svg/220px-Binary-classification-labeled.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/3/8/83878c91171338902e0fe0fb97a8c47a.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/d/5/5/d55cc79a57c061f065ebe39f25e6e27e.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/3/8/83878c91171338902e0fe0fb97a8c47a.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/6/9/7694f4a66316e53c8cdd9d9954bd611d.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/2/8/a/28a44724238fb2d5e107a9ca13327dac.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/3/8/2/382da15dfcfa571b3973cb5ae2223f76.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/c/0/5c0979a777bb373d53d87c32b48b8c86.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/b/f/0bfcc4fa7e7718bff26243e406a6be52.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["set","mathematics"],["sensitivity","tests"],["specificity","tests"],["cutoff","reference_value"],["thresholding","image_processing"]],"members":["cutoff","sensitivity","specificity","thresholding","set"],"related":["Statistical_classification","Set_(mathematics)","Property","Statistical_classification","Computer_science","Decision_tree_learning","Bayesian_network","Support_vector_machine","Neural_network","Statistical_hypothesis_testing","Null_hypothesis","Alternative_hypothesis","Statistically_significant","Type_I_error","Type_II_error","Sensitivity_(tests)","Specificity_(tests)","Receiver_Operating_Characteristic","Surrogate_endpoint","Human_chorionic_gonadotropin","Gravid","Neoplasm","Embryogenesis","Matthews_correlation_coefficient","Blood_values","Cutoff_(reference_value)","Positive_or_negative_test","Positive_predictive_value","Negative_predictive_value","Predictive_value","Human_chorionic_gonadotropin","Pregnancy_test","Multiclass_classification","Multi-label_classification","One-class_classification","Kernel_methods","Thresholding_(image_processing)","Prosecutor's_fallacy","Receiver_operating_characteristic","Matthews_correlation_coefficient","Classification_rule","Nello_Cristianini","John_Shawe-Taylor"]}
