With job production and batch\nproduction it is one of the three main production methods. [http://www.bbc.-\nco.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/business/production/methodsofproductionrev1.shtml\nProduction Methods], BBC GCSE Bitesize, retrieved 2012-10-26.\n\nThe concepts of mass production are applied to various kinds of products, from\nfluids and particulates handled in bulk (such as food, fuel, chemicals, and\nmined minerals) to discrete solid parts (such as fasteners) to assemblies of\nsuch parts (such as household appliances and automobiles).\n\nMass production is a diverse field, but it can generally be contrasted with\ncraft production. It has occurred for centuries; there are examples of\nproduction methods that can best be defined as mass production that predate the\nIndustrial Revolution. However, it has been widespread in human experience, and\ncentral to economics, only since the late 19th century.\n","linknr":343,"url":"Mass_production","recorded":1362481688,"links":54,"instances":["business","engineer","tool","physics","tool","equipment"],"pdf":["http://www.iiasa.ac.at/Admin/PUB/Documents/RR-89-001.pdf","http://www.iiasa.ac.at/Admin/PUB/Documents/RR-89-001.pdf","http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/teaching_folder/Econ_210c_spring_2002/Readings/Devine.pdf","http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/teaching_folder/Econ_210c_spring_2002/Readings/Devine.pdf","http://www.atomicacreative.com/images/ACG_EdisonAsIKnowHim.pdf","http://www.atomicacreative.com/images/ACG_EdisonAsIKnowHim.pdf"],"categories":["History of science and technology in the United States","Manufacturing","Production and manufacturing","Industry"],"headings":["Overview","History","Use of assembly lines","Vertical integration","Advantages and disadvantages","Socioeconomic impacts","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/53/Consolidated_TB-32_production_line.jpg/275px-Consolidated_TB-32_production_line.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f1/Hyundai_car_assembly_line.jpg/275px-Hyundai_car_assembly_line.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/83/Airacobra_P39_Assembly_LOC_02902u.jpg/220px-Airacobra_P39_Assembly_LOC_02902u.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/29/Ford_assembly_line_-_1913.jpg/220px-Ford_assembly_line_-_1913.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/Factory_1b.svg/32px-Factory_1b.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Emblem-money.svg/28px-Emblem-money.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/12px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["loader","equipment"],["jig","tool"],["john_penn","engineer"],["power","physics"],["jig","tool"],["fixture","tool"],["just-in-time","business"]],"members":["john_penn","fixture","power","jig","loader"],"related":["Assembly_line","Standardized","Assembly_line","Job_production","Batch_production","Fluids","Food","Fuel","Chemicals","Mined","Minerals","Household_appliances","Automobiles","Craft_production","Industrial_Revolution","Centrifugal_pump","Screw_conveyor","Process_control","Screw_conveyor","Bucket_elevator","Loader_(equipment)","Overhead_cranes","Capital_intensity","Automation","Robot","Machine_press","Workbench","Jig_(tool)","CNC","Fractionating_column","Crossbows","China","Warring_States_Period","Galley","Carthaginians","Mediterranean","Venice","Assembly_line","Venetian_Arsenal","Factory","Gutenberg_Bible","Printing_press","Industrial_Revolution","Portsmouth_Block_Mills","Royal_Navy","Napoleonic_Wars","Crimean_War","John_Penn_(engineer)","British_Standard_Whitworth","Interchangeable_parts","Machine_tools","Power_(physics)","Electricity","Scientific_management","Frederick_Winslow_Taylor","Industrial_engineering","Manufacturing_engineering","Operations_research","Management_consultancy","Henry_Ford","United_States_Department_of_War","Springfield,_Massachusetts","Harpers_Ferry,_West_Virginia","Machine_tools","Jig_(tool)","Fixture_(tool)","Singer_Corporation","Cyrus_McCormick","Reaper","High_speed_steel","Tungsten_carbide","Electric_resistance_welding","Polyethylene","Polystyrene","Polyvinyl_chloride","Plastics_extrusion","Blow_molding","Injection_molding","DC_motor","Frank_J._Sprague","AC_motor","Nikola_Tesla","Line_shaft","Ball_Brothers","Ball_Corporation","Mason_jar","Muncie,_Indiana","Day_labor","Henry_Ford","Line_shaft","Line_shaft","Ford_Motor_Company","Milling_machine","Ford_Model_T","Assembly_line","Overhead_crane","Vertical_integration","Ford_River_Rouge_Complex","Standard_Oil","Craft_production","Lead_time","Say's_law","Overproduction","Sociocultural_evolution","Consumerism","Unit_cost","Batch_production","Craft_production","Continuous_production","Fast_moving_consumer_goods","Ford_Model_T","Industrial_engineering","Instant_manufacturing","Job_production","Just-in-time_(business)","Lean_manufacturing","Manufacturing","Mass_market","Operations_management","Outline_of_industrial_organization","Pilot_plant","Production,_costs,_and_pricing","Second_Industrial_Revolution"]}
