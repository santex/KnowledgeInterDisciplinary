{"cursor":"9517","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'business rule' is a rule of a business, company, or corporation. It is a rule\nthat defines or constrains some aspect of business and always resolves to either\ntrue or false. Business rules are intended to assert business structure or to\ncontrol or influence the behavior of the business. Business\nrules describe the operations, definitions and constraints that apply to an\norganization. Business rules can apply to people, processes, corporate behavior\nand computing systems in an organization, and are put in place to help the\norganization achieve its goals.\n\nFor example a business rule might state that no credit check is to be performed\non return customers. Other examples of business rules include requiring a rental\nagent to disallow a rental tenant if their credit rating is too low, or\nrequiring company agents to use a list of preferred suppliers and supply\nschedules.\n\nWhile a business rule may be informal or even unwritten, writing the rules down\nclearly and making sure that they don't conflict is a valuable activity. When\ncarefully managed, rules can be used to help the organization to better achieve\ngoals, remove obstacles to market growth, reduce costly mistakes, improve\ncommunication, comply with legal requirements, and increase customer loyalty.\n","linknr":132,"url":"Business_rule","recorded":1362892752,"links":17,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Business terms","Management"],"headings":["Introduction","Categories of business rules","Real world applications and obstacles","Formal specification","See also","External links","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Business","Business_rules_approach","Business_rule_mining","Business_analyst","Glossary","Conceptual_schema","Knowledge","Business_analysis","Ephemeral","Aid","Wolf_Frameworks","Business_logic","Unified_Modeling_Language","Z_notation","Business_Process_Execution_Language","Business_Process_Modeling_Notation","Semantics_of_Business_Vocabulary_and_Business_Rules","Business_Process","Business_rules_approach","BRMS"]}
