Common names include 'coast redwood', 'California redwood', and\n'giant redwood'. It is an evergreen, long-lived, monoecious tree living\n1200â1800 years or more. This species includes the\ntallest trees on Earth, reaching up to in height (without the roots) and up to\nin diameter at breast height. Before commercial logging and clearing began by\nthe 1850s, this massive tree occurred naturally in an estimated along much of\ncoastal California (excluding southern California where rainfall is not\nsufficient) and the southwestern corner of coastal Oregon within the United\nStates. An estimated 95% or more of the original old-growth redwood forest has\nbeen cut down, Kelly, D. and G. Braasch. 1988.\nSecrets of the old growth forest.
