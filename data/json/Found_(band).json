The founding members, Ziggy Campbell, Tommy Perman and Kevin Sim met\nwhile studying fine art at Gray's School of Art in Aberdeen. They began working\non sound art installations together whilst in their final year at college in\n2001. Each project they do is given a catalogue number and documented on their\nwebsite. [http://found.surfacepressure.net Found.surfacepressure.net]\n\nIn 2005 they formed a band in order to play live music at the openings of their\nStop Look Listen exhibition tour (which toured from Peacock Visual Arts,\nAberdeen to The Meffan, Forfar and the Royal Scottish Academy in Edinburgh).\n\nThey recruited the keyboardist Gavin Sutherland in 2005, and then Alan Stockdale\njoined on drums and percussion at the beginning of 2006.\n\nIn 2006, FOUND released their debut single, \"Mullokian\" (SP4502), and album,\nFound Can Move (SPCD01), on Tommy Perman's label Surface Pressure Records.\nThey released two more singles from that album: \"Static 68\" on the Scottish\nlabel Creeping Bent and \"Synth Like Minds\" on the Hamburg based label,\nAufgeladen Und Bereit.\n\nIn October 2006, FOUND took part in the inaugural BBC Electric Proms with an\nunusual collaboration with multimedia comedians, (nobleandsilver).\n\nIn 2007, FOUND were commissioned to create a major sound installation to\ncommemorate the 20th anniversary of the Edinburgh Sculpture Workshop. They\nproduced a piece called Etiquette, which was funded by the PRSFoundation's award\nfor new music and uses some of the technology developed by Reactable. Etiquette\nwas displayed at the Edinburgh Sculpture Workshop's Magazine 07 exhibition,\nduring the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in Newhaven, Edinburgh.\n\nIn 2009, together with Simon Kirby from the University of Edinburgh, FOUND\ncreated Cybraphon, an \"autonomous emotional robot band\" in a\nwardrobe, {{Cite web\n  | title = Cybraphon url = http://cybraphon.com/ accessdate = 19 November\n  |
