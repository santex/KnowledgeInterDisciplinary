It was signed into law on July 23, 1866, by\nPresident Andrew Johnson. It denied him the opportunity of appointing any\njustices to the Supreme Court. It was the first major legislation dealing with\nthe judiciary following the American Civil War.\n\nThe Act redrew the boundaries of the judicial circuits and reduced the number of\ncircuits from ten to nine. It also provided for the gradual reduction in the\nnumber of seats on the Supreme Court from the ten that had been authorized in\n1863 to seven and established in large measure the geographical outlines of the\ncircuits ever since. Although Congress increased the size of the Supreme Court\njust three years later with the Circuit Judges Act of 1869, the geographical\noutline of the circuits has only been altered by the addition of new states to\ncircuits and the division of two large circuits in the twentieth century.\n\nAfter establishing nine circuits in 1837, Congress in 1842 shifted several\nsouthern states in order to accommodate transportation routes used by the\njustices when traveling on circuit. In 1862 Congress incorporated five\nadditional states into a restructured system of nine circuits, and within\nanother year had abolished the California Circuit, placed California and Oregon\nin a Tenth Circuit, and reorganized the mid-western states. The 1866 Act ended a\nperiod in which the arrangement of the states into circuits was frequently\nreorganized.\n\nThe geographical reorganization of the circuits in 1866 coincided with the\nbroader effort of the Republican majority in Congress to reduce what it\nconsidered the disproportionate influence the southern states enjoyed before the\nCivil War. Between 1837 and 1862, five of the nine circuits comprised\nexclusively slave states. The tradition of appointing a justice from each\ncircuit allowed Southern slaveowners to dominate the Supreme Court. After\nreducing the number of all-southern circuits in 1862, Congress in 1866 left only\ntwo circuits that comprised only former slave states, and only one that\ncomprised only former Confederate states.\n\nThe reduction in the size of the Supreme Court nullified the pending nomination\nof Henry Stanberry to the tenth seat on the Court and prevented President Andrew\nJohnson from appointing a justice during the remainder of his term. The\nlegislation owed less to the Republican opposition to Johnson, who signed the\nact, than to the efforts of Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase. The first draft of\nthe bill proposed a return to nine justices, thus preventing tie votes on the\nCourt and providing a justice for each circuit. In private communication with\ninfluential members of Congress and fellow justices, Chase urged a further\nreduction in the number of seats in hopes of winning approval for an increase in\nthe justices' salaries. Congress did not approve an increase in judicial\nsalaries until 1871, after it had returned the size of the Court to nine seats.\n","linknr":90,"url":"Judicial_Circuits_Act","recorded":1375074698,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Judicial_Circuits_Act&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Judicial_Circuits_Act&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/United_States_Statutes_at_Large","http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&fileName=014/llsl014.db&recNum=0240","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/United_States_Circuit_Court","/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States","/wiki/President_of_the_United_States","/wiki/Andrew_Johnson","/wiki/American_Civil_War","/wiki/Circuit_Judges_Act_of_1869","/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)","/wiki/U.S._Southern_States","/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America","/wiki/Henry_Stanberry","/wiki/Salmon_P._Chase","/w/index.php?title=Judicial_Circuits_Act&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Judiciary_Act_(disambiguation)","/w/index.php?title=Judicial_Circuits_Act&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Public_domain","http://www.fjc.gov/history/home.nsf/page/09a_bdy","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Judicial_Circuits_Act&oldid=565814775","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1866_in_law","/wiki/Category:1866_in_American_politics","/wiki/Category:United_States_federal_judiciary_legislation","/wiki/Category:History_of_the_Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Judicial+Circuits+Act&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Judicial+Circuits+Act","/wiki/Judicial_Circuits_Act","/wiki/Talk:Judicial_Circuits_Act","#","/wiki/Judicial_Circuits_Act","/w/index.php?title=Judicial_Circuits_Act&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Judicial_Circuits_Act&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Judicial_Circuits_Act","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Judicial_Circuits_Act","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Judicial_Circuits_Act&oldid=565814775","/w/index.php?title=Judicial_Circuits_Act&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6302850","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Judicial_Circuits_Act&id=565814775","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Judicial+Circuits+Act","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Judicial+Circuits+Act&oldid=565814775&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Judicial_Circuits_Act&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6302850#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judicial_Circuits_Act","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":["disambiguation","united_states"],"pdf":[],"categories":["1866
