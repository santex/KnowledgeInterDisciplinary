      "text" : "\n in the Philippines.]]\n\nIn culinary terms, a 'vegetable' is an edible plant or its part, intended for\ncooking or eating raw.<ref name=iarc></ref> In biological terms, \"vegetable\"\ndesignates members of the plant kingdom.\n\nThe non-biological definition of a vegetable is largely based on culinary and\ncultural tradition. Apart from vegetables, other main types of plant food are\nfruits, grains and nuts. Vegetables are most often consumed as salads or cooked\nin savory or salty dishes, while culinary fruits are usually sweet and used for\ndesserts, but it is not the universal rule.<ref name=iarc/> Therefore, the\ndivision is somewhat arbitrary, based on cultural views. For example, some\npeople consider mushrooms to be vegetables even though they are not biologically\nplants,<ref></ref><ref></ref> while others consider them a separate food\ncategory;<ref></ref> some cultures group potatoes with cereal products such as\nnoodles or rice,<ref></ref> while most English speakers would consider them\nvegetables.\n\nSome vegetables can be consumed raw, some may be eaten cooked, and some must be\ncooked to destroy certain natural toxins or microbes in order to be edible, such\nas eggplant, unripe tomatoes, potatoes, daylily, winter melon, fiddlehead fern,\nand most kinds of legume/beans (such as common beans). A number of processed\nfood items available on the market contain vegetable ingredients and can be\nreferred to as \"vegetable derived\" products. These products may or may not\nmaintain the nutritional integrity of the vegetable used to produce them.\n",
