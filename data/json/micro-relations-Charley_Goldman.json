{"cursor":"5526","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Charley Goldman' (December 22, 1887, in Warsaw, Poland â November 11, 1968) was\na famed boxing trainer who trained five world champions. Goldman's most famous\npupil was the undefeated heavyweight champion of the world, Rocky Marciano.\n\nGoldman, who was Jewish, grew up in the Red Hook section of Brooklyn. The area\nwas then known as a tough neighborhood, and Goldman learned how to use his fists\nat an early age to protect his older brother Sam. It is therefore not surprising\nthat Goldman became a professional boxer, as a bantamweight. He was a protÃ©gÃ© of\nworld champion \"Terrible\" Terry McGovern, and claimed to have adopted the habit\nof wearing a derby hat from McGovern. He fought his first professional fight, at\nthe age of 16, in a Brooklyn, New York saloon.\n\nGoldman claimed to have engaged in over 400 bouts, but most were unrecorded.\nGiven the quasi-legal status of the sport in New York at the time, it was not\nunusual that no record was kept of any particular encounter. He is attributed\nwith having engaged in 137 recorded fights, of which he won 36 (20 by KO) and\nlosing 6. The other fights were ruled either a No Decision or draw. Included in\nhis No Decision fights was a ten round attempt to wrest the bantamweight crown\nfrom champion Johnny Coulon in November 1912.\n\nUnlike today, ring rivals fought each other repeatedly and often. For example,\nGoldman had a rivalry with Whitey Kitson. The two were reputed to have fought\neach other 60 times. Goldman claimed to have fought Whitey twice on the same\nday, and 12 times in 12 days.\n\nAlthough, Goldman was considered a top notch fighter he was afflicted with\nbrittle hands, which affected his ability as a puncher. During his career he\nbroke his hands countless times, and was left with deformed, gnarled knuckles\nand fingers.\n\nAfter his career as a boxer ended, Goldman began training boxers. His first\nchampion was a middleweight Al McCoy. Eventually, Goldman teamed with boxing\nmanager Al Weill, and trained his fighters including world lightweight champion\nLou Ambers and featherweight champion Joey Archibald.\n\nIt was his work with Marciano, however, that Goldman is most famous for. When\nGoldman first met Marciano, the fighter was an inexperienced, short (approx.\n5'11), stoop shouldered, balding, clumsy heavyweight, with inordinately short\narms (Marciano's reach was the shortest of any heavyweight champion at\n69 inches). In addition, Marciano was starting late in the professional\nranks, and was light for a heavyweight.\n\nNevertheless, Goldman began to work with Marciano. Goldman believed that a\ntrainer should not interfere with a fighter's natural style, but rather refine\nand improve it. Accordingly, he did not try to turn him into a slick jabbing\nboxer. He also sought to turn Marciano's shortcomings into advantages. His adage\nwas: \"If you got a tall fighter, make him taller. If you got a short fighter\nmake him shorter.\" With Marciano, Goldman made him shorter by teaching him to\nfight out of crouch. By having him stoop low Goldman made the already low target\noffered by Marciano that much harder to hit.\n\nHe also worked with Marciano on shortening his punches and his too wide stance.\nGoldman tied Marciano's ankles together with a string to teach him to spread his\nfeet at the appropriate width. He taught him to throw combinations, rather than\none big bomb at a time. Although the finished product was still crude and\nclumsy, Marciano was a formidable offensive and defensive fighter. But, as\nGoldman pointed out: \"A lot of people say Rocky don't look too good in there,\nbut the guy on the ground don't look too good either.\"\n\nMarciano's defense was particularly deceiving. For example, boxing master,\nArchie Moore noted that, before he fought Marciano, his study of Marciano on\nfilm led him to believe that he could easily hit him with a left hook. When the\nfight began, Archie learned that, due to the angle of Marciano's crouch, he\ncould hit Marciano with a hook only if he placed himself in position to be hit\nby Marciano.\n\nUndisputedly, Marciano possessed assets that enabled him to become champion. But\nit is universally acknowledged that Goldman did a masterful job in bringing out\nthese assets to Marciano's greatest advantage, and refining his style to make\nthe fighter the best he could be. After Marciano retired, Goldman continued to\ntrain fighters. Although he worked with Oscar Bonavena shortly, at the beginning\nof the Argentinian's career, he never again trained a world championship\ncontender.\n\nGoldman was very popular with the sportswriters of his day. He was always good\nfor a quote, and continued to sport his derby hat long past the era when they\nwere customarily worn. The derby, along with his diminutive size (5'1\" tall),\never present cigar, pleasant disposition, and horn rimmed glasses, presented a\ncolorful image that endeared him to the boxing public of his day.\n\n{{Persondata \n| NAME = Goldman, Charley ALTERNATIVE NAMES = SHORT DESCRIPTION = DATE OF BIRTH\n| = December 22, 1887 PLACE OF BIRTH = DATE OF DEATH = November 11, 1968 PLACE\n| OF DEATH
