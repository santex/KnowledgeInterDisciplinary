This does not include\ngames played on dedicated handheld video game systems such as Nintendo 3DS or\nPlayStation Vita.\n\nThe first game on a mobile phone was a Tetris game on the Hagenuk MT-2000 device\nfrom 1994. [http://www.hagenuk-germany.de/en/history.html Hagenuk history] http://www.handy-sammler.de/Handys/Hagenuk_MT-\n2000.htm Hagenuk MT-2000 with Tetris\n\nThree years later Nokia launched the very successful [[Snake (video\ngame)|Snake]] on selected models in 1997. [http://www.nokia.com/A4303014\nNokia - Snake is born:a mobile gaming classic] Snake and its variants has\nsince become one of the most-played video games and is found on more than 350\nmillion devices worldwide. [http://blogs.nokia.com/nseries/2011/02/15/7-nokia-world-\nrecords-that-will-blow-your-mind/ 7 Nokia World Records That Will Blow Your\nMind]\n\nMobile games are played using the technology present on the device itself. For\nnetworked games, there are various technologies in common use. Examples include\ntext message (SMS), multimedia message (MMS) or GPS location identification. The\nfirst two-player game for mobile phones was a variant of the [[Snake (video\ngame)|Snake]] game for the Nokia 6110, using the infrared port.\n\nHowever, there are non networked applications, that simply use the device\nplatform to run the game software. The games may be installed over the air, side\nloaded onto the handset with a cable, or may be embedded in the handheld devices\nby the OEM or by the mobile operator.\n\nMobile games are usually downloaded via the mobile operator's network, but in\nsome cases are also loaded in the mobile handsets when purchased, via infrared\nconnection, Bluetooth, or memory card.\n","linknr":472,"url":"Mobile_game","recorded":1362688924,"links":31,"instances":["technology","programming_language","fifth_generation","operating_system","calculators","computing","apple","computer_game","programming_language","device","ios","video_game"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Mobile
