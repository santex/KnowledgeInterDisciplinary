It is an evolution of the Hewlett-Packard\nChemStation System.\n\nTwo versions are available: one (\"online\") in connection with the modules of\nthe HPLC chain is designed to control instruments and run experiments, and the\nother (\"offline\"), without a connection with the HPLC chain, is designed to\nanalyze data.\n\nChemStation is structured around a number of registers. Two of the more\nimportant registers are CHROMREG and CHROMRES, the chromatographic data\nregisters.\n\nChemStation has a command line interpreter and can run macros. Those macros are\nfiles grouping a set of commands. These files possess a .mac extension.\n\nChemStation can import analysis lists and export result files in XML by adding\nnew lines to the ChemStation.ini configuration file. This is a feature to\nimplement the connection with a Laboratory information management system (LIMS).\n","linknr":92,"url":"Agilent_ChemStation","recorded":1362477075,"links":13,"instances":["computer_science"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Chromatography software","Laboratory information management system"],"headings":["External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/75/Science-symbol-2.svg/30px-Science-symbol-2.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["macro","computer_science"]],"members":["macro"],"related":["Liquid_chromatography","Proprietary_software","Agilent","Liquid_chromatography","Gas_chromatography","Hewlett-Packard","Processor_register","Macro_(computer_science)","XML","Laboratory_information_management_system"]}
