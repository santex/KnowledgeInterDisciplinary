It\narises from a qualitative or quantitative deficiency of von Willebrand factor\n(vWF), a multimeric protein that is required for platelet adhesion. It is known\nto affect humans and dogs (notably Doberman Pinschers), and rarely swine,\ncattle, horses, and cats. There are three forms of vWD: inherited, acquired and\npseudo or platelet type. There are three types of hereditary vWD: vWD Type I,\nvWD Type II and vWD III. Within the three inherited types of vWD there are\nvarious subtypes. Platelet type vWD is also an inherited condition.\n\nvWD Type I is the most common type of the disorder and those that have it are\ntypically asymptomatic or may experience mild symptoms such as nosebleeds\nalthough there may be severe symptoms in some cases. There are various factors\nthat affect the presentation and severity of symptoms of vWD such as blood type.\n\nvWD is named after Erik Adolf von Willebrand, a Finnish pediatrician who first\ndescribed the disease in 1926.\n","linknr":487,"url":"Von_Willebrand_disease","recorded":1362481269,"links":31,"instances":["anatomy","medicine","biology","human"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Coagulopathies","Autosomal dominant disorders"],"headings":["Signs and symptoms","Diagnosis","Classification and types","Acquired von Willebrand disease","Pathophysiology","Genetics","Epidemiology","Therapy","History","Sources","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4e/Autosomal_dominant_-_en.svg/220px-Autosomal_dominant_-_en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/Autorecessive.svg/220px-Autorecessive.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["stress","medicine"],["colon","anatomy"],["polymorphism","biology"],["chromosome_12","human"]],"members":["colon","stress","polymorphism","chromosome_12"],"related":["Coagulation","Von_Willebrand_factor","Protein_subunit","Platelet","Doberman_Pinscher","Hereditary","Asymptomatic","Epistaxis","Eponym","Erik_Adolf_von_Willebrand","Finland","Paediatrics","Bleeding_tendency","Epistaxis","Menorrhagia","Childbirth","Internal_bleeding","Hemarthrosis","Blood_plasma","Glycoprotein","Collagen","Factor_VIII","Medical_laboratory","PFA-100","Adrenaline","Adenosine_diphosphate","Acute_phase_reactant","Infection","Pregnancy","Stress_(medicine)","Complete_blood_count","Platelet","APTT","Prothrombin_time","Thrombin","Fibrinogen","Factor_IX","Hemophilia_B","Coagulation_factor","International_Society_on_Thrombosis_and_Haemostasis","Heterozygous","Coagulation","Incidental_findings","Menorrhagia","Autoantibody","Aortic_valve_stenosis","Gastrointestinal_bleeding","Heyde's_syndrome","Ventricular_Assist_Device","Thrombocythemia","Platelet","Wilms'_tumor","Hypothyroidism","Mesenchymal_dysplasia","Shear_stress","Gastrointestinal_tract","Uterus","Angiodysplasia","Telangiectasia","Colon_(anatomy)","Capillary","Penetrance","Pathology","Polymorphism_(biology)","ABO_blood_group_system","Chromosome_12_(human)","Autosomal_dominant","Autosomal_recessive","Prevalence","Menstruation","Blood_type","Desmopressin","Ã…land_Islands","Erik_von_Willebrand","Duke_method","Bernard-Soulier_syndrome","Blood_diseases","Purpura_secondary_to_clotting_disorders","University_of_Sheffield","National_Heart,_Lung,_and_Blood_Institute"]}
