Born in Barcelona, the son of a day laborer, his early musical training\nis unknown. It has been said that Terradellas studied with the composer\nFrancisco Valls in Barcelona, but Carreras i Bulbena did considerable research\nin Barcelona and found no evidence of this. On May 23, 1732 he entered in Naples\nas a student in the Conservatorio dei Poveri di GesÃ¹ Cristo. He studied\ncomposition with the famous Neapolitan composer, Francesco Durante.\n\nTerradellas was one of a group of foreign-born composers who studied in Italy\nand adopted the Italian style. The reason for this is that Italian opera was by\nfar the dominant genre of opera at this time, attracting composers from all\nacross Europe: (George Frederick Handel, Johann Adolf Hasse, Johann Christian\nBach (all Germans), Thomas Augustine Arne (an Englishman), Josef Myslivecek (a\nCzech), and Vicente Martin (a Spaniard).\n\nHis first work, an oratorio, Giuseppe Riconosciuto , with text by Metastasio was\nfirst performed in Naples in 1736. The musicologist, Felipe Pedrell, reported\nseeing the MS in the library of San Giacomo in Rome in 1898. The library was\ncatalogued shortly after his visit, but when he returned in 1902, the score was\nmissing and was not listed in the catalogue. This was probably a student work,\nbecause a note in the archives, dated May, 1736, states that \"Il figliolo\nTerradellas Ã¨ sempre in conservatorio\" (Terradellas is still (a student) at the\nconservatory.) Terradellas's first opera was Astarto was performed at Rome in\n1739 during the Carnival season. He may have collaborated with Gaetano Latilla\non an opera Romolo, performed in Naples during the same year, but the libretto\nnames only Latilla as the composer.\n\nA serenata, La Cerere was performed in Rome in 1740, probably privately for a\ngroup of clergymen, and the three-act comic opera, Gl'intrichi delle cantarine,\nwas performed in Naples during the same season. Carreras does not mention\nCerere, but the libretto in the Library of Congress, Washington D.C., attests to\nTerradellas's authorship and the date of performance. Carreras also mentions\noperas for which no documentation has been found. The operas are Artemesia, said\nto have been performed in Rome in 1739, and Issipile, supposedly performed in\nFlorence in 1742.\n\nSan Giacomo e San Ildefonso degli Spanuoli is a church established for Spanish\nresidents in Rome. This church was already quite old in 1743, because Spaniards\nhad been coming to Rome for centuries. Terradellas was approved as Maestro di\nCapella by the congregation of that church on May 1, 1743 with a salary of 10\nscudi per month. During his tenure, he composed at least four masses, a half\ndozen motets, as well as other short works for the service. Later, trouble\ndeveloped between Terradellas and one of his subordinates, and Terradellas was\ndismissed in August, 1745 after two years and three months.\n\nHis opera, La Merope, was performed during the Carnival of 1743. Alfred\nLoewenberg, in the Annals of Opera lists three other performances of this opera,\nbut provides no documentation. The dates given are Florence, Carnival of 1743\nand revived there December 26, 1749; Livorno during the Carnival of 1744; and\nAncona during the Carnival of 1746. Since there are two extant MSS of this\nopera, it seems quite likely that there was at least one other performance. A\nlibretto in the Library of Santa Cecilia names Terradellas as the composer of a\nMerope, performed in Florence in 1750, but the attribution is only written in\npencil on the flyleaf facing the title page. Comparison of this libretto with\nthat of 1743 casts serious doubt on its authenticity. The 1750 libretto has 22\narias, only five of which have the same text as the arias in the 1743 libretto.\n\nDuring the Carnival of 1744, his Artaserse was performed in Venice. Loewenberg\nstates that this opera was given on several other Italian stages, but no\ndocumentation has been found. The manuscript in Venice is dated 1744.\n","linknr":101,"url":"Domènech_Terradellas","recorded":1375066575,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Dom%C3%A8nec_Terradellas&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Dom%C3%A8nec_Terradellas&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","/wiki/Dom%C3%A8nec_Terradellas","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","/w/index.php?title=Dom%C3%A8nech_Terradellas&redirect=no","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Domenec_tarradellas.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/Domenec_tarradellas.jpg/220px-Domenec_tarradellas.jpg","/wiki/File:Domenec_tarradellas.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//es.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%27Aven%C3%A7","/wiki/Spain","/wiki/Opera","/wiki/Composer","/wiki/Italy","/wiki/Barcelona","/wiki/Francesco_Durante","/w/index.php?title=Dom%C3%A8nec_Terradellas&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/New_Grove_Dictionary_of_Opera","/wiki/Stanley_Sadie","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0333734327","http://mdc2.cbuc.cat/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=/avens82&CISOPTR=424&REC=31","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/13370428","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Domènec_Terradellas&oldid=540638132","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1711_births","/wiki/Category:1751_deaths","/wiki/Category:People_from_Barcelona","/wiki/Category:Catalan_composers","/wiki/Category:Opera_composers","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Dom%C3%A8nec+Terradellas&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Dom%C3%A8nec+Terradellas","/wiki/Dom%C3%A8nec_Terradellas","/wiki/Talk:Dom%C3%A8nec_Terradellas","#","/wiki/Dom%C3%A8nec_Terradellas","/w/index.php?title=Dom%C3%A8nec_Terradellas&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Dom%C3%A8nec_Terradellas&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Dom%C3%A8nec_Terradellas","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Dom%C3%A8nec_Terradellas","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Dom%C3%A8nec_Terradellas&oldid=540638132","/w/index.php?title=Dom%C3%A8nec_Terradellas&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q960294","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Dom%C3%A8nec_Terradellas&id=540638132","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Dom%C3%A8nec+Terradellas","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Dom%C3%A8nec+Terradellas&oldid=540638132&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Dom%C3%A8nec_Terradellas&printable=yes","//ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dom%C3%A8nec_Terradellas","//de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dom%C3%A8nech_Terradellas","//es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dom%C3%A8nec_Terradellas","//fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dom%C3%A8nec_Terradellas","//it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domingo_Miguel_Bernab%C3%A9_Terradellas","//pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dom%C3%A8nec_Terradelles","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q960294#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dom%C3%A8nec_Terradellas","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/lo
