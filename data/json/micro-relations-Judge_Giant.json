{"cursor":"11222","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"cover for theWhat ever happened to?'' issue about the Giant family, by Cliff\nRobinson.]]\n\n'Judge Giant' can refer to either of two fictional characters appearing in the\n[[Judge Dredd]] comic strip in [[2000 AD (comic)|2000 AD]]. They are father and\nson. Their first names have never been given.\n\nThey are both descended from another 2000 AD character, 'Giant' (real name John\nClay), who starred in his own series in 2000 AD, [[Harlem Heroes]], which ran in\nprogs (issues) 1–27 of the comic. 'John 'Giant' Clay' made a cameo\nappearance in the Judge Dredd strip in prog 28. Since Judge Dredd himself did\nnot appear in 2000 AD until prog 2, the Giant family's appearance in the comic\npredates Dredd's debut in his own strip.\n\nDredd writer Al Ewing has explained the appeal of the second Giant as \"heâs\nDreddâs successor, except heâs human in a way Dredd isnât... So thereâs a wealth\nof story potential there\".
