{"cursor":"27797","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n'Microgeneration' is the small-scale generation of heat and electric power by\nindividuals, small businesses and communities to meet their own needs, as\nalternatives or supplements to traditional centralized grid-connected power.\nAlthough this may be motivated by practical considerations, such as unreliable\ngrid power or long distance from the electrical grid, the term is mainly used\ncurrently for environmentally conscious approaches that aspire to zero or low-\ncarbon footprints. It differs from micropower in that it is principally\nconcerned with fixed power plants rather than for use with mobile devices.\n","linknr":501,"url":"Microgeneration","recorded":1362500126,"links":29,"instances":["electricity","electrical","2002_film","united_kingdom","tv_series","government"],"pdf":["http://www.israel-electric.co.il/Static/WorkFolder/HomeClients/pv-hahachlata-hamelea.pdf","http://www.rebelwolf.com/essn/ESSN-Dec2005.pdf"],"categories":["Energy
