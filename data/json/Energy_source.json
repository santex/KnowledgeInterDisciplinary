This energy allows people who can\nafford the cost to live under otherwise unfavorable climatic conditions through\nthe use of heating, ventilation, and/or air conditioning. Level of use of\nexternal energy sources differs across societies, as do the climate,\nconvenience, levels of traffic congestion, pollution and availability of\ndomestic energy sources.\n","linknr":1242,"url":"Energy_source","recorded":1362509543,"links":97,"instances":["electricity","window","humanity","geology","business","magazine","shaft"],"pdf":["http://www.ren21.net/Portals/97/documents/GSR/REN21_GSR2011.pdf","http://www.gwec.net/fileadmin/images/News/Press/GWEC_-_Global_Wind_Statistics_2011.pdf","http://www.gwec.net/uploads/media/07-02_PR_Global_Statistics_2006.pdf","http://files.epia.org/files/Global-Market-Outlook-2016.pdf","http://www.osti.gov/accomplishments/pdf/DE00014520/DE00014520.pdf","http://sefi.unep.org/fileadmin/media/sefi/docs/publications/SEFI_Investment_Report_2007.pdf","http://www.cleanedge.com/reports/pdf/Trends2009.pdf","http://www.stanford.edu/group/efmh/jacobson/PDF%20files/ReviewSolGW09.pdf","http://www.ren21.net/globalstatusreport/REN21_GSR_2010_full.pdf","http://media.beyondzeroemissions.org/ZCA2020_Stationary_Energy_Report_v1.pdf","http://www.ren21.net/pdf/RE_GSR_2009_update.pdf","http://www.wwindea.org/home/images/stories/pdfs/worldwindenergyreport2010_s.pdf","http://www.wwindea.org/home/images/stories/pdfs/worldwindenergyreport2010_s.pdf","http://www.ren21.net/Portals/97/documents/GSR/GSR2011_Master18.pdf","http://www.ren21.net/Portals/97/documents/GSR/GSR2011_Master18.pdf","http://www.un.org/esa/sustdev/sdissues/energy/op/hydro_tremblaypaper.pdf","http://www.un.org/esa/sustdev/sdissues/energy/op/hydro_tremblaypaper.pdf","http://www.ren21.net/pdf/RE_GSR_2009_update.pdf","http://www.ren21.net/pdf/RE_GSR_2009_update.pdf","http://pubs.usgs.gov/circ/2004/c1249/c1249.pdf","http://www.geni.org/globalenergy/research/renewable-energy-potential-of-spain/REN_Spain_Nigel_PBMfinal.pdf","http://sustainablenuclear.org/PADs/pad11983cohen.pdf","http://sustainablenuclear.org/PADs/pad11983cohen.pdf","https://netfiles.uiuc.edu/mragheb/www/NPRE%20402%20ME%20405%20Nuclear%20Power%20Engineering/Thorium%20Resources%20in%20%20Rare%20Earth%20Elements.pdf","http://www.energywatchgroup.org/fileadmin/global/pdf/EWG_Press_Uranium_29-11-2006.pdf","http://www.stormsmith.nl/report20050803/Chap_2.pdf","http://www.stormsmith.nl/report20050803/Chap_2.pdf","http://ee.ucd.ie/erc/events/nuclear/Crawley.pdf","http://ee.ucd.ie/erc/events/nuclear/Crawley.pdf","http://www.greens-efa.org/cms/topics/dokbin/206/206749.the_world_nuclear_industry_status_report@en.pdf","http://www.fusie-energie.nl/artikelen/ongena.pdf","http://www.fusie-energie.nl/artikelen/ongena.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20080227092435/http://www.generalcompression.com/gc_summary.pdf","http://www.generalcompression.com/gc_summary.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20080227092435/http://www.generalcompression.com/gc_summary.pdf","http://www.natcapsolutions.org/publications_files/FragileDomEnergy_AtlanticMonthly_Nov1983.pdf"],"categories":["Applied
