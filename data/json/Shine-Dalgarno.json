{"cursor":"3508","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The 'Shine-Dalgarno sequence' (or Shine-Dalgarno box), proposed by Australian\nscientists John Shine (b.1946) and Lynn Dalgarno (b.1935), is a\nribosomal binding site in the mRNA, generally located 8 basepairs upstream of\nthe start codon AUG. The Shine-Dalgarno sequence exists both in bacteria and\narchaea, being also present in some chloroplastic and mitochondial transcripts.\nThe six-base consensus sequence is 'AGGAGG'; in E. coli, for example, the\nsequence is AGGAGGU. This sequence helps recruit the ribosome to the mRNA to\ninitiate protein synthesis by aligning it with the start codon. The\ncomplementary sequence ('UUCCUCC'), is called the 'anti-Shine-Dalgarno sequence'\nand is located at the 3' end of the 16S rRNA in the ribosome. The eukaryotic\nequivalent of the Shine-Dalgarno sequence is called the Kozak sequence.\n\nMutations in the Shine-Dalgarno sequence can reduce translation. This reduction\nis due to a reduced mRNA-ribosome pairing efficiency, as evidenced by the fact\nthat complementary mutations in the anti-Shine-Dalgarno sequence can restore\ntranslation.\n\nThe Shine-Dalgarno sequence GAGG dominates in bacteriophage T4 early genes,\nwhereas the sequence GGAG is a target for the T4 endonuclease RegB that\ninitiates the early mRNA degradation.\n\nWhen the Shine-Dalgarno sequence and anti-Shine-Dalgarno sequence pair, the\ntranslation initiation factors IF2-GTP, IF1, IF3, as well as the initiator tRNA\nfMet-tRNA ([[N-Formylmethionine| fmet ]] ) are\nrecruited to the ribosome.\n","linknr":270,"url":"Shine-Dalgarno","recorded":1362483971,"links":23,"instances":["dna","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Protein biosynthesis"],"headings":["The ribosomal S1 protein in Gram-negative bacteria","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["upstream_and_downstream","dna"],["translation","biology"]],"members":["upstream_and_downstream","translation"],"related":["Australia","John_Shine","Lynn_Dalgarno","Ribosome","MRNA","Upstream_and_downstream_(DNA)","Start_codon","Bacteria","Archaea","Consensus_sequence","MRNA","Protein_synthesis","Start_codon","16S_ribosomal_RNA","RRNA","Kozak_consensus_sequence","Mutation","Translation_(biology)","Initiation_factor","Gram-negative_bacteria","Kozak_consensus_sequence","Eukaryote","Prokaryotic_translation"]}
