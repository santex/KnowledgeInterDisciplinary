His longtime partners were Jerry Doggett (1956â1987) and\nRoss Porter (1977â2004). In 1976, he was\nselected by Dodgers fans as the Most Memorable Personality (on the field or off)\nin the team's history. He is also a recipient of the Baseball Hall of Fame's\nFord C. Frick Award for broadcasters (inducted in 1982). He currently is in his\n63rd year with the team. Unlike the modern style in which multiple sportscasters\nhave an on-air conversation (usually with one functioning as play-by-play\nannouncer and the other(s) as color commentator), Scully, Doggett and Porter\ngenerally called games solo, trading with each other inning-by-inning. In the\n1980s and 1990s, Scully would call the entire radio broadcast except for the 3rd\nand 7th inning; allowing the other Dodger commentators to broadcast an inning.\n\nWhen Doggett retired after the 1987 season, he was replaced by Hall-of-Fame\nDodgers pitcher Don Drysdale, who previously broadcast games for the California\nAngels. Drysdale died in his hotel room\nfollowing a heart attack before a game in 1993, resulting in a very difficult\nbroadcast for Scully and Porter, who were told of the death but could not\nmention it on-air until Drysdale's family had been notified and the official\nannouncement of the death made. He was replaced by former Dodgers outfielder Rick Monday. Porter's tenure was terminated somewhat\ncontroversially after the 2004 season, after which the current format of play-by-\nplay announcers and color commentators was installed, led by newcomer Charley\nSteiner and Monday. Scully, however,\ncontinues to announce solo.\n\nAs of the 2012 season, Scully calls roughly 100 games per season (all home games\nand road games in California and Arizona) for both flagship radio station KLAC and television outlets KCAL-\nTV and Prime Ticket. Scully is simulcast for the first three innings of each of\nhis appearances, then announces the remaining innings only for the TV audience.\nIf Scully is calling the game, Charley Steiner takes over play-by-play on radio\nbeginning with the fourth inning, with Rick Monday as color commentator. If Scully is not calling the\ngame, Eric Collins and Steve Lyons call the entire game on television while\nSteiner and Monday do the same on radio.\n\nIn the event the Dodgers are in post-season play, Scully calls the first three\nand last three innings of the radio broadcast alone; with Charley Steiner and\nRick Monday handling the middle innings.\n\nThe Dodgers also broadcast on radio in Spanish, and the play-by-play is handled\nby another Ford C. Frick Award winner, Jaime JarrÃ­n. Jarrin has been with the\nDodgers since 1959. The color analyst for some games is former Dodger pitcher\nFernando Valenzuela, for whom Jarrin once translated post-game interviews. The\nSpanish-language flagship is KTNQ.\n\nLive traffic reports pertaining to Dodger Stadium were broadcast from the\nDodgers Transportation Center inside the ballpark when the Dodgers were on KABC.\nKABC radio's Captain Jorge Jarrin (son of Dodger broadcaster Jaime JarrÃ­n) and\nDoug Dunlap handled those duties during the pre-game and post-game shows as well\nas during Dodger Talk following the game.\n\nIn 2006, the Dodgers introduced an on demand channel on Time Warner Cable called\n\"Dodgers on Demand\", hosted by Tony Kinkela.\n\nCurrently, Steiner has been converted to radio-only with Rick Monday. Jerry Reuss was\nremoved from his broadcast position, though he is still with the club to serve\nin other aspects. Steve Lyons will be retained as a color-commentator, and the Dodgers\nrecently hired ESPN broadcaster Eric Collins as a play-by-play announcer to\nreplace Steiner on road games for television.\n\nBroadcast outlets Since 2006, the over-the-air games have aired on KCAL-TV\n(Channel 9) after the two parties signed a multi-year, multi-million dollar deal\nin 2005, and will air 50 games per season. Since 1997, The cable television home\nof the Dodgers has been Fox Sports Net Prime Ticket (previously known as Fox\nSports Net West 2). The previous over-the-air television homes for the Dodgers\nwere KCOP-TV (Channel 13) from 2002-2005, KTLA-TV (Channel 5) from 1993-2001,\nand KTTV (Channel 11) from 1958-1992. In their New York days, WOR (Channel 9,\nnow WWOR-TV) carried Dodgers games from 1951 until their move following the\nseason of 1957.\n\nStarting in the late 1970s through the early 1990s, the Dodgers put a small\nnumber of their home games on a subscription/pay-per-view service appropriately\ncarried 'Dodgervision'. During that timeframe, in addition to the road telecasts\nfrom KTTV, selected home games were also televised on the ONTV subscription\nservice, the now-defunct Z Channel/SportsChannel Los Angeles network, and then\nagain, on a pay-per-view basis until a majority of Dodgers games debuted on the\nthen-new Fox Sports Net West 2 in 1997, just around the same time FSN West 2's\nparent company, News Corporation (also owner of KTTV) bought the team from the\nO'Malley family. In relation to News Corp's purchase of the Dodgers, there was\nspeculation that the Dodgers over-the-air telecasts would return to KTTV, but\nthey were still under contract to KTLA. KTLA's contract with the Dodgers ended\nin 2001, and the over-the-air telecasts then moved to KTTV's now-sister station,\nKCOP, with the production handled by FSN West 2.\n\nOn radio, the Dodgers will be broadcast in 2012 on KLAC (570 AM). In October\n2011 the team signed a three-year deal with KLAC parent company Clear Channel\nCommunications. KABC (790 AM) was the Dodgers' flagship station from 1973\nthrough 1997 and from 2008 through 2011. The games had aired on KFWB (980 AM)\nfrom 2002 through 2007. Other station to carry the Dodgers included KXTA (1150\nAM; now KTLK), which was a sports-talk station, from 1998 through 2001. KFI (640\nAM) was the radio flagship from 1961 to 1972. And previous to that, KMPC (710\nAM, now KSPN) was the original flagship radio station in Los Angeles of the vast\nDodgers Radio Network, which is carried on 16 stations in five states\n(California, Nevada, New Mexico, Hawaii, Florida, plus the U.S. Virgin Islands).\nTheir Spanish radio network was led by KHJ which took over in 2008 from longtime\nhome KWKW (1330 AM), with Jarrin, Pepe YÃ±iguez, and former Dodger great Fernando\nValenzuela on the call, and was carried on six stations in California, Nevada,\nand Arizona. In 2011 Spanish-language Dodger broadcasts returned to KTNQ, the\nstation that carried the games from 1979 to 1989.\n\nScully normally does all nine innings (plus extra innings if necessary) on\nlocally televised games (KCAL and FSN Prime Ticket), with the first three\ninnings being simulcast on radio, while Steiner and Monday take over in the\nfinal innings on radio. However, Scully's current schedule calls for him to work\nonly the home and road games within the National League Western division and any\nWest Coast interleague contests within the American League West, as he decided\nin recent years to cut back on his schedule. In Scully's absence, play-by-play\nnewcomer Eric Collins and Steve Lyons (a former analyst for Fox Sports' national\nbaseball coverage) work the games together on television only, while Steiner and\nMonday continue to call the game on the radio network.\n\nFox Sports West's current broadcast deal with the team expires at the end of the\n2013 MLB season. On June 20, 2011, MLB Commissioner Bud Selig rejected a\nproposed contract extension between the Dodgers and Fox, stating \"Critically,\nthe transaction is structured to facilitate the further diversion of Dodgers\nassets for the personal needs of Mr. McCourt. Given the magnitude of the\ntransaction, such a diversion of assets would have the effect of mortgaging the\nfuture of the franchise to the long-term detriment of the club and its fans.\"\n[http://losangeles.dodgers.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20110620&content_i-\nd=20770860&vkey=news_la&c_id=la Commish: TV deal not in Dodgers' best interests]\nMLB News June 20, 2011 Both Fox Sports West and the Dodgers were involved\nin separate lawsuits over the team's broadcast rights as well as the sale of the\nclub.
