{"cursor":"14133","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nIn human spaceflight, a 'life support system' is a group of devices that allow a\nhuman being to survive in space. US government space agency NASA,  and private spaceflight companies use the term\n'environmental control and life support system' or the acronym 'ECLSS' when\ndescribing these systems for their human spaceflight missions.  The\nlife support system may supply air, water and food. It must also maintain the\ncorrect body temperature, an acceptable pressure on the body and deal with the\nbody's waste products. Shielding against harmful external influences such as\nradiation and micro-meteorites may also be necessary. Components of the life\nsupport system are life-critical, and are designed and constructed using safety\nengineering techniques.\n","linknr":339,"url":"Life_support_system","recorded":1362477497,"links":38,"instances":["ecology","aircraft"],"pdf":["http://www.nasa.gov/centers/marshall/pdf/104840main_eclss.pdf","http://www.nasa.gov/centers/marshall/pdf/104840main_eclss.pdf","http://www.marsjournal.org/contents/2006/0005/files/rapp_mars_2006_0005.pdf"],"categories":["Human spaceflight","Spacecraft design","Spacecraft life support systems"],"headings":["Human physiological and metabolic needs","Atmosphere","Water","Food","Microbe detection and control","Space vehicle systems","Space station systems","EVA systems","Natural systems","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg/20px-Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/6c/Wiki_letter_w.svg/23px-Wiki_letter_w.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/RocketSunIcon.svg/28px-RocketSunIcon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/7c/MAVENnMars.jpg/125px-MAVENnMars.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["energy_flow","ecology"],["environmental_control_system","aircraft"]],"members":["energy_flow","environmental_control_system"],"related":["Human_spaceflight","NASA","Private_spaceflight","Human_spaceflight","Life-critical_system","Safety_engineering","Oxygen","Carbon_dioxide","Mass_balance","Partial_pressure","Barometric_pressure","Diluent","Spacecraft","Oxygen_toxicity","Pressure_suits","Extravehicular_activity","Composting_toilet","LOCAD","Space_Shuttle","Extravehicular_Mobility_Unit","Orion_Multi-Purpose_Crew_Vehicle","Lockheed_Martin","Houston,_Texas","Soyuz_spacecraft","Paragon_Space_Development_Corporation","CCDev","Bigelow_Commercial_Space_Station","Bigelow_Aerospace","Las_Vegas,_Nevada","Space_station","Sundancer","BA_330","Human-in-the-Loop","Extra-vehicular_activity","Space_suit","Extravehicular_Mobility_Unit","Orlan_space_suit","Primary_Life_Support_System","Biosphere_2","Closed_ecological_systems","Multi-trophic","Zero_waste","Integrated_biotectural_system","Multi-disciplinary_engineering","Integrated_multi-trophic_aquaculture","Energy_flow_(ecology)","Closed_ecological_system","Chlorella_pyrenoidosa","Effect_of_spaceflight_on_the_human_body","Environmental_control_system_(aircraft)","International_Conference_on_Environmental_Systems","Primary_Life_Support_System","Thermal_Control_System"]}
