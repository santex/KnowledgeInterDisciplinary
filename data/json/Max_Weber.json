EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica Online. 20 April\n2009. [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/638565/Max-Weber\nBritannica.com] Weber is often cited, with Ãmile Durkheim and Karl Marx,\nas among the three founding architects of sociology. Radkau, Joachim and\nPatrick Ca miller. (2009). Max Weber: A Biography. Trans. Patrick Ca miller.\nPolity Press. (ISBN 9780745641478)\n\nWeber was a key proponent of methodological antipositivism, arguing for the\nstudy of social action through interpretive (rather than purely empiricist)\nmeans, based on understanding the purpose and meaning that individuals attach to\ntheir own actions. Weber's main intellectual concern was understanding the\nprocesses of rationalisation, secularisation, and \"disenchantment\" that he\nassociated with the rise of capitalism and modernity, and which he saw as the result of a new way of thinking about the\nworld.\n\nPerhaps Weber is best known for his thesis combining economic sociology and the\nsociology of religion, elaborated in his book [[The Protestant Ethic and the\nSpirit of Capitalism]], in which he proposed that ascetic Protestantism was one\nof the major \"elective affinities\" associated with the rise in the Western world\nof market-driven capitalism and the rational-legal nation-state. Against Marx's\n\"historical materialism,\" Weber emphasised the importance of cultural influences\nembedded in religion as a means for understanding the genesis of\ncapitalism. Weber, Max The Protestant Ethic and \"The Spirit of Capitalism\"\n(1905). Translated by Stephen Kalberg (2002), Roxbury Publishing Company, pp.\n19, 35; Weber's references on these pages to \"Superstructure\" and \"base\" are\nunambiguous references to Marxism's base/superstructure theory. The\nProtestant Ethic formed the earliest part in Weber's broader investigations into\nworld religion: he would go on to examine the , the and ancient Judaism, with\nparticular regard to the apparent non-development of capitalism in the\ncorresponding societies, as well as to their differing forms of social\nstratification.\n\nIn another major work, [[Politics as a Vocation]], Weber defined the state as an\nentity which successfully claims a \"monopoly on the legitimate use of violence\".\nHe was also the first to categorise social authority into distinct forms, which\nhe labelled as charismatic, traditional, and rational-legal. His analysis of\nbureaucracy emphasised that modern state institutions are increasingly based on\nrational-legal authority.\n\nWeber also made a variety of other contributions in economic history, as well as\neconomic theory and methodology. Weber's analysis of modernity and\nrationalisation significantly influenced the critical theory associated with the\nFrankfurt School.\n\nAfter the First World War, Max Weber was among the founders of the liberal\nGerman Democratic Party. He also ran unsuccessfully for a seat in parliament and\nserved as advisor to the committee that drafted the ill-fated democratic Weimar\nConstitution of 1919. After contracting the Spanish flu, he died of pneumonia in\n1920, aged 56.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Max_Weber","recorded":1372152583,"links":[],"instances":["paranormal","religious","sociology","economics","germany","philosophy","spirit","journal","polity","philosophy","weimar_constitution","sociology","book","economics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["1864
