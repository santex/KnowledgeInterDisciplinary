This can refer to a set of simultaneous offspring, such as the chicks\nhatched from one clutch of eggs, or to all the offspring, as with the honeybee.\n\nHuman offspring (descendants) are referred to as children (without reference to\nage, thus one can refer to a parent's \"minor children\" or \"adult children\" or\n\"infant children\" or \"teenage children\"); male children are sons and female\nchildren are daughters. See kinship and descent. Offspring can occur after\nmating or after Artificial Insemination\n",
