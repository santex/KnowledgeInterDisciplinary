The class is used by other\nsanctioning bodies with compatible rules, such as the International Conference\nof Sports Car Clubs.\n\nThe classifications within the Improved Touring group define cars that will run\ntogether competitively in a road race. While cars in different classifications\nmay be on the track simultaneously, the only positioning that matters is between\ncars of the same classification.\n\nThe rules for the class include the 'General Competition Rules' (GCR), a section\nof the SCCA rulebook that defines the basic setup and preparation for cars in\nany class of SCCA racing. Improved Touring cars are also subject to the rules in\nthe 'Improved Touring Category Section' (ITCS) of the rulebook, which define the\nspecific classes and provide the class-specific rules.\n","linknr":89,"url":"Improved_Touring","recorded":1362551660,"links":10,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Sports Car Club of America"],"headings":["GCR Rules","Rules","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Road_racing","Sports_Car_Club_of_America","ICSCC","Honda_CR-X","Mazda_Wankel_engine","Acura_Integra","BMW","Honda_CR-X","BMW","Nissan_240Z","BMW","Porsche"]}
