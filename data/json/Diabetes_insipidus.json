There are\nseveral different types of DI, each with a different cause. The most common type\nin humans is central DI, caused by a deficiency of arginine vasopressin (AVP),\nalso known as antidiuretic hormone (ADH). The second common type of DI is\nnephrogenic diabetes insipidus, which is caused by an insensitivity of the\nkidneys to ADH. It can also be an iatrogenic artifact of drug use.\n\nAlthough they have a common name, diabetes mellitus and diabetes insipidus are\ntwo entirely separate conditions with unrelated mechanisms. Both cause large\namounts of urine to be produced (polyuria), and the term \"diabetes\" is derived\nfrom the Greek name for this symptom. However, diabetes insipidus is either a\nproblem with the production of antidiuretic hormone (central diabetes\ninsipidus) or kidney's response to antidiuretic hormone (nephrogenic diabetes\ninsipidus), whereas diabetes mellitus causes polyuria via a process called\nosmotic diuresis, due to the high blood sugar leaking into the urine and taking\nexcess water along with it.\n\nThe incidence of diabetes insipidus in the general population is three in\n100,000.\n","linknr":756,"url":"Diabetes_insipidus","recorded":1362482026,"links":50,"instances":["biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Endocrine diseases","Nephrology"],"headings":["Signs and symptoms","Diagnosis","Pathophysiology","Classification","Treatment","Etymology","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c6/Arginine_vasopressin3d.png/230px-Arginine_vasopressin3d.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["human_development","biology"]],"members":["human_development"],"related":["Vasopressin","Disease","Polydipsia","Polyuria","Vasopressin","Nephrogenic_diabetes_insipidus","Kidney","Iatrogenic_artifact","Diabetes_mellitus","Polyuria","Osmotic_diuresis","Diabetes_mellitus","Hyperglycemia","Blood_glucose","Dehydration","Human_development_(biology)","Fever","Vomiting","Diarrhea","Dehydration","Blood_glucose","Bicarbonate","Calcium","Electrolyte","Sodium","Hypernatremia","Dehydration","Urinalysis","Specific_gravity","Osmolarity","Fluid_deprivation_test","Primary_polydipsia","Antidiuretic_hormone","Antidiuretic_hormone","Osmolality","Desmopressin","Pituitary","Magnetic_resonance_imaging","Prolactinoma","Histiocytosis","Syphilis","Tuberculosis","Tumor","Granuloma","Psychogenic_polydipsia","Homeostasis","Blood_pressure","Sodium","Potassium","Hypothalamus","Vasopressin","Supraoptic_nucleus","Paraventricular_nucleus","Pituitary_gland","Ventromedial_nucleus","Cerebral_cortex","Body_water","Kidney","Collecting_ducts","Aquaporin","Cyclic_AMP","Protein_kinase_A","Cytoplasm","Vasopressin","Pregnancy","Placenta","Pre-eclampsia","HELLP_syndrome","Acute_fatty_liver_of_pregnancy","Desmopressin","Carbamazepine","Diuretic","Hydrochlorothiazide","Indomethacin","Amiloride","Hypokalemia","Latin","Ancient_Greek","Siphon","Ancient_Greece","Physician","Aretaeus_of_Cappadocia","Floruit","Common_Era","Glycosuria"]}
