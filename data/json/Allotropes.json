{"cursor":"10486","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n and graphite are two allotropes of carbon: pure forms of the same element that\n differ in crystalline structure.]]\n\n'Allotropy' or 'allotropism' (coined from Greek \"other\" + \"grow\") is the\nproperty of some chemical elements to exist in two or more different forms,\nknown as 'allotropes' of these elements. Allotropes are different structural\nmodifications of an element; Allotrope in IUPAC Compendium of Chemical\nTerminology, Electronic/ version, http://goldbook.iupac.org/A00243.html.\nAccessed March 2007. the atoms of the element are bonded together in a\ndifferent manner. For example, the allotropes of carbon include diamond (where\nthe carbon atoms are bonded together in a tetrahedral lattice arrangement),\ngraphite (where the carbon atoms are bonded together in sheets of a hexagonal\nlattice), graphene (single sheets of graphite), and fullerenes (where the carbon\natoms are bonded together in spherical, tubular, or ellipsoidal formations). The\nterm allotropy is used for elements only, not for compounds. The more general\nterm, used for any crystalline material, is polymorphism. Allotropy refers only\nto different forms of an element within the same phase (i.e. different solid,\nliquid or gas forms); the changes of state between solid, liquid and gas in\nthemselves are not considered allotropy.\n\nFor some elements, allotropes have different molecular formulae which can\npersist in different phases â for example, two allotropes of oxygen (dioxygen,\nO 2, and ozone, O 3), can both exist in the solid, liquid\nand gaseous states. Conversely, some elements do not maintain distinct\nallotropes in different phases â for example phosphorus has numerous solid\nallotropes, which all revert to the same P 4 form when melted to the\nliquid state.\n","linknr":299,"url":"Allotropes","recorded":1362375298,"links":57,"instances":["materials_science","iron"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Allotropy","Inorganic chemistry"],"headings":["History","Differences in properties of an element's allotropes","List of allotropes","See also","Notes","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/Diamond_and_graphite.jpg/300px-Diamond_and_graphite.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg/20px-Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0a/Actinide_phases.svg/250px-Actinide_phases.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/12px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["polymorphism","materials_science"],["polymorphism","materials_science"],["ferrite","iron"],["ferrite","iron"]],"members":["polymorphism","ferrite"],"related":["Graphite","Chemical_element","Atoms","Chemical_bond","Allotropes_of_carbon","Diamond","Tetrahedral","Graphite","Hexagonal_lattice","Graphene","Fullerene","Chemical_compound","Polymorphism_(materials_science)","State_of_matter","Solid","Liquid","Gas","Allotropes_of_oxygen","Oxygen","Ozone","Phosphorus","Allotropes_of_phosphorus","Jöns_Jakob_Berzelius","Greek_language","Avogadro's_law","Wilhelm_Ostwald","Polymorphism_(materials_science)","IUPAC","Pressure","Photochemistry","Temperature","Iron","Body-centered_cubic","Ferrite_(iron)","Face-centered_cubic","Austenite","Tin","Tin_pest","Metallic","Semiconductor","Coordination_number","Oxidation_states","Catenation","Non-metal","Halogen","Noble_gas","Metalloid","Metal","Allotropes_of_carbon","Diamond","Lonsdaleite","Graphite","Graphene","Linear_acetylenic_carbon","Amorphous_carbon","Fullerene","Buckminsterfullerene","Carbon_nanotube","Allotropes_of_phosphorus","White_phosphorus","Diphosphorus","Allotropes_of_oxygen","Ozone","Tetraoxygen","Metastability","Solid_oxygen","Allotropes_of_sulfur","Selenium","Allotropes_of_boron","Silicon","Amorphous_silicon","Diamond_cubic","Arsenic","Germanium","Antimony","Polonium","Cubic_crystal_system","Rhombohedral","Phase_transition","Allotropes_of_iron","Ferrite_(iron)","Allotropes_of_plutonium","Americium","Berkelium","Californium","Superdense_carbon_allotropes"]}
