Ranker uses\nlists and rankings to harness the \"wisdom of crowds\" to answer both watercooler\ndebates like [http://www.ranker.com/crowdranked-list/the-worst-movies-of-all-\ntime Worst Movies of All Time] as well as practical searches like [http://www.ranker.com/list/best-lip-gloss/makeup-\ntips Best Lip Gloss].\n\nAll lists on Ranker are powered by linked datasets to power “connected\nlistmaking” across over 7 million \"rankable items\" on many different verticals\nand topics. (Ranker’s content and data partners include Google-owned\nFreebase[http://www.freebase.com], as well as Factual[http://www.factual.com])\n\nRanker launched in August, 2009, and has since grown to over 5.8 monthly unique\nvisitors and over 21 million monthly page views, per Quantcast. As of May 2013\nRanker’s US traffic was ranked at 498 on Quantcast.<ref></ref> Ranker also\ngarners significant traffic from the mobile web, ranking 92 in the US on\nQuantcast. Ranker appears to have tens of thousands of users (over 7000 people\nhave participated in the above-mentioned Worst Movies ranking alone).\n\nThe site was founded by serial entrepreneur Clark Benson whose previous site,\neCrush, sold to Hearst in 2006. Board members include Draper Associates investor\nJoel Yarmon and former MySpace CEO and Userplane founder Michael Jones. Ranker\nhas raised a total of $3.1 million in funding, beginning with a $1 million seed\nround in 2008 and buffeted by a Series A investment round of $1.3 in April 2011.\nOther Ranker investors include Draper Associates, Rincon Venture Partners,\nSiemer Venture Capital and various angels, including Factual founder Gil Elbaz,\nRyan Steelberg, and founder Benson himself.<ref></ref>\n\nRanker has many lists that reflect an individual user's opinion, but judging by\nhow prominently they promote their \"Ultimate Lists\" on the site, these lists\nseem to be a major focus. Ultimate Lists are rankings that are determined by a\ncombination of users ranking their version of a given topic, and individuals\nvoting positively or negatively on items on the list. Ranker apparently sees\nstrong user engagement on these lists, stating that 15% of the visitors vote on\nan average of 10 items per ranking <ref></ref> While the Ranker site explains\nthat the Ultimate List rankings weight list inputs heavier than votes \"while\nevery vote counts, your ranked lists count a lot more\", they don't appear to\noffer any additional insight into this algorithm. Ranker's Ultimate lists have\nbeen cited by authoritative sources like Forbes, Motley Fool, and VentureBeat.\n\nThe Ranker platform is designed to (anonymously) collect individual user votes\nand track them, using cookies, across various lists. Per the company's\nblog,<ref></ref> this allows the company to assemble a taste graph for people\nwho have voted on lists, as opposed to the sort of social graph that sites like\nFacebook can assemble using their users' personal data. Ranker has also used\ntheir taste graph to perform Factor Analysis, a way of looking deeper into user\nvoting trends (for example, the connections between movies that a certain group\nof people all tagged as \"bad.\") <ref></ref>\n","title":"ranker","headings":["Notes"]},"micro-relation":["1: Freebase","1: Factual","1: Quantcast","1: Clark_Benson","1: ECrush","1: Draper_Associates","1: Forbes","1: Motley_Fool","1: VentureBeat"]}
