Many different types of tracheal tubes\nare available, suited for different specific applications. An endotracheal\ntube is a specific type of tracheal tube that is nearly always inserted\nthrough the mouth (orotracheal) or nose (nasotracheal). A tracheostomy tube is\nanother type of tracheal tube; this curved metal or plastic tube may be\ninserted into a tracheostomy stoma to maintain a patent lumen. A tracheal\nbutton is a rigid plastic cannula about 1Â inch in length that can be\nplaced into the tracheostomy after removal of a tracheostomy tube to maintain\npatency of the lumen.\n","linknr":156,"url":"Endotracheal_tube","recorded":1362668408,"links":26,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://ether.stanford.edu/library/thoracic_anesthesia/One-Lung%20Ventilation/DLT%20Placement.pdf","http://ether.stanford.edu/library/thoracic_anesthesia/One-Lung%20Ventilation/DLT%20Placement.pdf"],"categories":["Medical equipment"],"headings":["History","Applications","Endotracheal tube","Tracheostomy tube","Tracheal button","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5d/Endotracheal_tube_colored.png/230px-Endotracheal_tube_colored.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/19/Sondeintubation.jpg/300px-Sondeintubation.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/Carlens.jpg/300px-Carlens.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Vertebrate_trachea","Esophagus","Catheter","Gas_exchange","David_S._Sheridan","Helium","Nitric_oxide","Nitrous_oxide","Xenon","Desflurane","Isoflurane","Sevoflurane","Salbutamol","Atropine","Epinephrine","Ipratropium","Lidocaine","Airway_management","Mechanical_ventilation","Polyvinyl_chloride","Silicone_rubber","Natural_rubber","Stainless_steel","Bronchus","Cricoid_cartilage","VATS_lobectomy","Rubber","Polyvinyl_chloride","Double-lumen_endo-bronchial_tube","Thoracic_surgery","Single-lung_ventilation","Obstructive_sleep_apnea","Tracheal_intubation"]}
