One end is coated\nwith a material that can be ignited by frictional heat generated by striking the\nmatch against a suitable surface.<ref name=oxford></ref> Matches are usually\nsold in quantity; wooden ones are packaged in boxes, and paper matches are\nclustered in rows stapled into matchbooks. They are commonly sold by\ntobacconists and many other kinds of shops. The coated end of a match, known as\nthe match \"head,\" contains either phosphorus or phosphorus sesquisulfide as the\nactive ingredient and gelatin as a binder. There are two main types of matches:\n'safety matches', which can be struck only against a specially prepared surface,\nand 'strike-anywhere matches', for which any suitably frictional surface can be\nused. Some match-like compositions, known as electric matches, are ignited\nelectrically and do not make use of heat from friction.\n",
