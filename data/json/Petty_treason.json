{"cursor":"6033","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Petty treason' or 'petit treason' was an offence under the common law of\nEngland which involved the betrayal of a superior by a subordinate. It differed\nfrom the better-known high treason in that high treason can only be committed\nagainst the Sovereign. In England and Wales, petty treason ceased to be a\ndistinct offence from murder by virtue of the Offences against the Person Act\n1828. Section 1 (repealing the previous statute) and section 2 (assimilating\nthe offence to murder). It was abolished in Ireland in 1829. 9 Geo.4\nc. 31, sections 1 and 3. It never existed in Scotland. It has also been\nabolished in other common-law countries.\n\nThe element of betrayal is the reason why this crime was considered worse than\nan ordinary murder; medieval and post-medieval society rested on a framework in\nwhich each person had his or her appointed place and such murders were seen as\nthreatening this framework. Many people had somebody subordinate to them and\nfeared the consequences if the murder of superiors was not punished harshly.\n\nThe common law offence was codified in the Treason Act 1351. Under that Act,\npetty treason was an aggravated form of murder. It consisted of:\n\n# a wife killing her husband, a clergyman killing his prelate, or a servant\n# killing his master or mistress, or his master's wife. Hale p. 380\n\nThe Act abolished three other forms of petty treason which had existed under\ncommon law:\n\n# a wife attempting to kill her husband, a servant forging his master's seal, or\n# a servant committing adultery with his master's wife or daughter.\n\nCounterfeiting gold or silver coin was also petty treason before the 1351 Act\nelevated this to high treason. [http://www.lonang.com/exlibris/blackstone/bla-\n406.htm Commentaries on the Laws of England, William Blackstone, Book 4 chapter\n6] However the method of execution was not changed.\n\nThe punishment for a man convicted of petty treason was to be drawn to the place\nof execution and hanged, but not quartered as in the case of high treason. The\npunishment for a woman was to be burned at the stake without being drawn there\n(the penalty for high treason was drawing and burning). In later years the law\noffered a modicum of mercy to women who were to be executed in this fashion: the\nexecutioner was equipped with a cord passed around the victim's throat and,\nstanding outside of the fire, would pull it tight, strangling her before the\nflames could reach her. In a few instances, however, this could go wrong, with\nthe cord burning through and the victim burning alive; the ensuing scandals\ncontributed to the abolition of this punishment and its substitution by hanging\nin 1790. Treason Act 1790\n\nThe common law defence of provocation, by which a verdict of murder could be\nreduced to manslaughter, was also available in petty treason trials.\n\nThe rules of evidence and procedure in petty treason trials were the same as in\nhigh treason trials, except that the Treason Act 1695 did not apply to petty treason. [http://www.lonang.com/exlibris/blackstone/bla-\n414.htm Commentaries on the Laws of England, William Blackstone, Book 4 chapter\n14] Petty treason also differed from high treason in that the legal\ndefence of benefit of clergy was available for petty treason until\n1496, Benefit of Clergy Act 1496 (12 Hen. 7 c. 7) whereas it was never\navailable for high treason.\n","linknr":161,"url":"Petty_treason","recorded":1372152818,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Petty_treason&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Petty_treason&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Common_law","/wiki/England","/wiki/High_treason","/wiki/Murder","/wiki/Offences_against_the_Person_Act_1828","#cite_note-1","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Treason_Act_1351","/wiki/Murder_in_English_law","/wiki/Prelate","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Seal_(device)","/wiki/Adultery","/wiki/Counterfeit","#cite_note-4","/wiki/Hanging","/wiki/Hanged,_drawn_and_quartered","/wiki/Burned_at_the_stake","#cite_note-5","/wiki/Common_law","/wiki/Provocation_(legal)","/wiki/Manslaughter","/wiki/Treason_Act_1695","#cite_note-6","/wiki/Benefit_of_clergy","#cite_note-7","/w/index.php?title=Petty_treason&action=edit&section=1","http://books.google.com/books?id=2KoDAAAAQAAJ&dq=subject%3A%22Pleas%20of%20the%20crown%22%20volume%20one&lr&pg=PA376#v=onepage&q=subject:%22Pleas%20of%20the%20crown%22%20volume%20one&f=false","/wiki/Google_Book_Search","http://books.google.com/books?id=vZc0AAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_book_other_versions_r&cad=3_0#PPA105,M1","/wiki/Google_Book_Search","http://books.google.com/books?id=uG40AAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_book_other_versions_r&cad=2_1#PPA336,M1","/wiki/Google_Book_Search","http://books.google.com/books?id=_Ik0AAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=coke%27s+institutes#PPA19,M1","/wiki/Google_Book_Search","http://books.google.com/books?id=Q6A0AAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_book_other_versions_r&cad=3_0#PPA176,M1","http://books.google.com/books?id=Q6A0AAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_book_other_versions_r&cad=3_0#PPA211,M1","/wiki/Google_Book_Search","http://books.google.com/books?id=QPw8AAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=editions:LCCN06027017&lr=#PRA1-PA156,M1","http://books.google.com/books?id=Q1ozAAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=editions:LCCN06027017#PPA202,M1","http://books.google.com/books?id=HnoDAAAAQAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=editions:LCCN06027017&lr=#PPA202,M1","/wiki/Google_Book_Search","http://books.google.com/books?id=hhsY0Yq8sWEC&pg=PA225&source=gbs_toc_r&cad=0_0","/wiki/Google_Book_Search","#cite_ref-1","#cite_ref-2","#cite_ref-3","#cite_ref-4","http://www.lonang.com/exlibris/blackstone/bla-406.htm","#cite_ref-5","/wiki/Treason_Act_1790","#cite_ref-6","http://www.lonang.com/exlibris/blackstone/bla-414.htm","#cite_ref-7","/wiki/Benefit_of_Clergy_Act_1496","/wiki/Template:History_of_English_criminal_law","/wiki/Template_talk:History_of_English_criminal_law","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:History_of_English_criminal_law&action=edit","/wiki/History_of_English_criminal_law","/wiki/Common_law","/wiki/Felony","/wiki/Misdemeanor","/wiki/Arrestable_offence","/wiki/File:Scale_of_justice_2.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/Scale_of_justice_2.svg/100px-Scale_of_justice_2.svg.png","/wiki/Inchoate_offences_in_English_law","/wiki/Incitement","/wiki/Provocation_in_English_law","/wiki/Offence_against_the_person","/wiki/Capital_murder","/wiki/Felo_de_se","/wiki/Sexual_offences_in_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Buggery","/wiki/Labouchere_Amendment","/wiki/Indecent_assault","/wiki/Criminal_libel","/wiki/Seditious_libel","/wiki/Sedition","/wiki/Blasphemous_libel","/wiki/Blasphemy_law_in_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Obscene_libel","/wiki/Defamatory_libel","/wiki/Property_crime","/wiki/Larceny","/wiki/Embezzlement","/wiki/Fraudulent_conversion","/wiki/Cheating_(law)","/wiki/Misprision_of_felony","/wiki/Compounding_a_felony","/wiki/Champerty_and_maintenance","/wiki/Embracery","/wiki/Portal:Law_of_England_and_Wales","/wiki/Portal:Criminal_justice","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Petty_treason&oldid=513402586","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:English_criminal_law","/wiki/Category:Treason","/wiki/Category:Murder","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Petty+treason&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Petty+treason","/wiki/Petty_treason","/wiki/Talk:Petty_treason","#","/wiki/Petty_treason","/w/index.php?title=Petty_treason&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Petty_treason&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf7/skins/vector/images/sea
