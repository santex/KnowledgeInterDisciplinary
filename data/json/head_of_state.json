Arthur (President of the United States).]]\n\n'Head of State' (), or 'Chief of State' (), is a term used in constitutional\nlaw, international law, political science, and diplomatic protocol when\nreferring to the official who holds the highest ranked position in a sovereign\nstate and has the vested or implied powers to act as the chief public\nrepresentative of a state. Heads of state in most countries are natural persons\nholding an office; however, in four United Nations member states the head of\nstate position is held by a body of persons: the Federal Council of Switzerland,\nthe Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Co-Princes of Andorra and the\nCaptains Regent of San Marino.<ref>Even in such systems (Switzerland and Bosnia-\nHercegovina) one of the members, elected as president or chairman, discharges\nthe representational responsibilities a single-person head of state would carry\nout, as can observed in the UN protocol list.</ref><ref name=\"unprotocol\"/>\n\nThe term head of state is often used differentiating it from the term head of\ngovernment, e.g. as in article 7 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of\nTreaties, article 1 of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Crimes\nagainst Internationally Protected Persons, including Diplomatic Agents and the\nUnited Nations protocol list.<ref\nname=\"unprotocol\">[http://www.un.int/protocol/documents/Hspmfm.pdf HEADS OF\nSTATE, HEADS OF GOVERNMENT, MINISTERS FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS], Protocol and Liaison\nService, United Nations (2012-10-19).

Retrieved on 2012-10-23.</ref> The latter is also\ngenerally true in absolute monarchies and sometimes as well in other forms of\nauthoritarian government.\n\nThe role of the head of state generally includes legitimizing the state and\nexercising the political powers, functions, and duties granted to the head of\nstate in the country's constitution and laws. The Vienna Convention on\nDiplomatic Relations operates under the presumption that the head of a\ndiplomatic mission (i.e. ambassador or nuncio) of the sending state is\naccredited to the head of state of the receiving state.<ref name=\"vienna diplom-\natic\">[http://untreaty.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/conventions/9_1_196-\n1.pdf Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations 1961], International Law\nCommission, United Nations. Retrieved on 2012-10-15.</ref> In nation states the\nhead of state position is often thought of, depending on the powers held by that\nposition, as either the official \"leader\" or \"mascot\" of the nation.\n\nCharles de Gaulle described the role he envisaged for the French presidency\nbefore he wrote the modern French constitution, stating the head of state should\nembody \"the spirit of the nation\" for the nation itself and the world: \"a\ncertain idea about France\" ().<ref>The citation in French is taken from [http://www.de-gaulle-\nedu.net/sentrainer/trois_commt/certaineidee.htm Charles de Gaulle, Mémoires de\nguerre, tome 1, Plon, 1954]</ref> Today, many countries expect their head of\nstate to embody national values in a similar fashion.\n",
