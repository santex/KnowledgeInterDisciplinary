Here is a\nsampling of some of the more influential theories that can be found in this\nbranch of psychology.\n\n*Attribution theory â is concerned with the ways in which people explain (or\nattribute) the behaviour of others. The theory divides the way people attribute\ncauses to events into two types. External or \"situational\" attributions assign\ncausality to an outside factor, such as the weather. Internal or \"dispositional\"\nattributions assign causality to factors within the person, such as ability or\npersonality. *Cognitive dissonance â was originally based on the concept of\ncognitive consistency, but is now more related to self-concept theory. When\npeople do something that violates their view of themselves, this causes an\nuncomfortable state of dissonance that motivates a change in either attitudes or\nbehaviour (Festinger, 1957). *Drive theory â posits that the presence of an\naudience causes arousal which creates dominant or typical responses in the\ncontext of the situation. *Elaboration likelihood model â maintains that\ninformation processing, often in the case of a persuasion attempt can be divided\ninto two separate processes based on the \"likelihood of cognitive elaborations,\"\nthat is, whether people think critically about the content of a message, or\nrespond to superficial aspects of the message and other immediate cues.\n*Evolutionary psychology â suggests that human behavioural tendencies are at\nleast partly inherited and have been influenced by the process of natural\nselection. One popular area of study is the possibility that human sex\ndifferences are due to differential reproductive strategies. *Observational\nlearning (social learning) â suggests that behaviour can be acquired by\nobservation and imitation of others, unlike traditional learning theories which\nrequire reinforcement or punishment for learning to occur. *Schemata theory â\nfocuses on \"schemas\" which are cognitive structures that organize knowledge and\nguide information processing. They take the form of generalized beliefs that can\noperate automatically and lead to biases in perception and memory. *Self-\nperception theory â emphasizes that we observe ourselves in the same manner that\nwe observe others, and draw conclusions about our likes and dislikes. Extrinsic\nself perceptions can lead to the over-justification effect. *Self-verification\ntheory â focuses on peopleâs desire to be known and understood by others. The\nkey assumption is that once people develop firmly held beliefs about themselves,\nthey come to prefer that others see them as they see themselves. *Social\ncomparison theory â suggests that humans gain information about themselves, and\nmake inferences that are relevant to self-esteem, by comparison to relevant\nothers. *Social exchange theory â is an economic social theory that assumes\nhuman relationships are based on rational choice and cost-benefit analyses. If\none partner's costs begin to outweigh his or her benefits, that person may leave\nthe relationship, especially if there are good alternatives available. *Social\nidentity theory â was developed by Henri Tajfel and examines how categorizing\npeople (including oneself) into ingroups or outgroups affects perceptions,\nattitudes, and behavior. *Social penetration theory â proposes that, as\nrelationships develop, interpersonal communication moves from relatively\nshallow, non-intimate levels to deeper, more intimate ones. The theory was formulated by psychologists Irwin Altman\nand Dalmas Taylor in 1973 to provide an understanding of the closeness between\ntwo individuals. *Socioemotional selectivity theory â posits that as people age\nand their perceived time left in life decreases, they shift from focusing on\ninformation seeking goals to focusing on emotional goals. *System justification\ntheory â proposes that people have a motivation to defend and bolster the status\nquo, in order to continue believing that their social, political, and economic\nsystems are legitimate and just. *Terror management theory â suggests that human\nmortality causes existential dread and terror, and that much of human behavior\nexists as a buffer against this dread (e.g., self-esteem and worldviews).\n*Triangular theory of love â by Sternberg, characterizes love in an\ninterpersonal relationship on three different scales: intimacy, passion, and\ncommitment. Different stages and types of love can be categorized by different\ncombinations of these three elements.\n","linknr":119,"url":"List_of_social_psychology_theories","recorded":1375090027,"links":["/w/index.php?title=List_of_social_psychology_theories&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=List_of_social_psychology_theories&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Psychology","/wiki/Wikipedia:P","/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_social_psychology_theories&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/Personality_theory","/wiki/Social_psychology","/wiki/Psychology","/wiki/Attribution_theory","/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance","/wiki/Drive_theory_(social_psychology)","/wiki/Audience_effect","/wiki/Arousal","/wiki/Elaboration_likelihood_model","/wiki/Evolutionary_psychology","/wiki/Observational_learning","/wiki/Schemata_theory","/wiki/Self-perception","/wiki/Self-verification_theory","/wiki/Social_comparison_theory","/wiki/Social_exchange_theory","/wiki/Social_identity","/wiki/Social_penetration_theory","/wiki/Interpersonal_communication","/wiki/Intimate_relationship","#cite_note-Griffin-1","/wiki/Psychologist","/wiki/Irwin_Altman","/wiki/Socioemotional_selectivity_theory","/wiki/System_justification_theory","/wiki/Status_quo","/wiki/Terror_management_theory","/wiki/Self-esteem","/wiki/Worldviews","/wiki/Triangular_theory_of_love","/w/index.php?title=List_of_social_psychology_theories&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-Griffin_1-0","/wiki/McGraw-Hill","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_social_psychology_theories&oldid=555617220","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Psychology_lists","/wiki/Category:Social_psychology","/wiki/Category:Articles_needing_expert_attention_with_no_reason_or_talk_parameter","/wiki/Category:Articles_needing_expert_attention_from_May_2013","/wiki/Category:All_articles_needing_expert_attention","/wiki/Category:Psychology_articles_needing_expert_attention","/wiki/Category:Miscellaneous_articles_needing_expert_attention","/wiki/Category:Articles_lacking_sources_from_May_2013","/wiki/Category:All_articles_lacking_sources","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=List+of+social+psychology+theories&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=List+of+social+psychology+theories","/wiki/List_of_social_psychology_theories","/wiki/Talk:List_of_social_psychology_theories","#","/wiki/List_of_social_psychology_theories","/w/index.php?title=List_of_social_psychology_theories&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=List_of_social_psychology_theories&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/List_of_social_psychology_theories","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/List_of_social_psychology_theories","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=List_of_social_psychology_theories&oldid=555617220","/w/index.php?title=List_of_social_psychology_theories&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6639695","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=List_of_social_psychology_theories&id=555617220","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=List+of+social+psychology+theories","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=List+of+social+psychology+theories&oldid=555617220&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=List_of_social_psychology_theories&printable=yes","#","//www.wikid
