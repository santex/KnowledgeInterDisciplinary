It is their job to make\nobservations and predictions in changes of new or existing cultural trends. The\nword derives from the aesthetic of \"cool\".\n\nIn this they resemble the intuitive fashion magazine editors of the 1960s such\nas Nancy White ([[Harper's Bazaar]] 1958â1971). Coolhunters operate most notably\nin the world of street fashion and design, but their work also blurs into that\nof futurists such as Faith Popcorn. Many webloggers now serve as online\ncoolhunters, in a variety of cultural and technological areas.\n","linknr":203,"url":"Coolhunting","recorded":1362480270,"links":22,"instances":["knowledge","aesthetic","editor"],"pdf":["http://www.planningaboveandbeyond.com/downloads/coolhunting.pdf","http://www.planningaboveandbeyond.com/downloads/coolhunting.pdf"],"categories":["Cultural trends","Creativity","Street fashion"],"headings":["Business","Methods and practices","See also","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cool","aesthetic"],["intuition","knowledge"],["nancy_white","editor"]],"members":["intuition","cool","nancy_white"],"related":["Marketing","Observation","Prediction","Fads_and_trends","Cool_(aesthetic)","Intuition_(knowledge)","Nancy_White_(editor)","Street_fashion","Futurology","Faith_Popcorn","Weblogger","Research","Youth_culture","Consultant","Corporation","Outsourcing","Market_research","Viacom","MTV","Advertising","Focus_group","Thought","Feeling","Demographic","Recording","Information_gathering","Brand","Leader","Statistical_survey","Chatroom","Webgroup","Consumerism","Pop_culture","Scott_Westerfeld","Public_Broadcasting_Service","Malcolm_Gladwell"]}
