{"cursor":"17064","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" ecoregions. The yellow line encloses the ecoregions per the World Wide Fund for\n Nature.]] \n\nAn 'ecoregion' ('ecological region') is an ecologically and geographically\ndefined area that is smaller than a bioregion, which in turn is smaller than an\necozone. All three of these are larger than an ecosystem. Ecoregions cover\nrelatively large areas of land or water, and contain characteristic,\ngeographically distinct assemblages of natural communities and species. The\nbiodiversity of flora, fauna and ecosystems that characterise an ecoregion tends\nto be distinct from that of other ecoregions. In theory, biodiversity or\nconservation ecoregions are relatively large areas of land or water where the\nprobability of encounter of different species and communities at any given point\nremain relatively constant, within an acceptable range of variation (largely\nundefined at this point). Three caveats are appropriate for all biogeographic\nmapping approaches. Firstly, no single biogeographic framework is optimal for\nall taxa. Ecoregions reflect the best compromise for as many taxa as possible.\nSecondly, ecoregion boundaries rarely form abrupt edges; rather, ecotones and\nmosaic habitats bound them. Thirdly, most ecoregions contain habitats that\ndiffer from their assigned biome.\n","linknr":266,"url":"Freshwater_ecoregion","recorded":1362675678,"links":42,"instances":["ethic","plants","ecology","geographer","animals","wwf"],"pdf":["http://www.nature.org/tncscience/files/spalding.pdf","http://www.nature.org/tncscience/files/spalding.pdf"],"categories":["Ecoregions|","Biogeography"],"headings":["Definition and categorization","Importance","Terrestrial","Marine","Freshwater","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/Amazon_rainforest.jpg/240px-Amazon_rainforest.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/A_map_of_North_America%27s_bioregions%2C_improved_from_the_previous.jpg/220px-A_map_of_North_America%27s_bioregions%2C_improved_from_the_previous.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/83/Hintere_Schwaerze.jpg/260px-Hintere_Schwaerze.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/Swiss_National_Park_131.JPG/260px-Swiss_National_Park_131.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/97/The_Earth_seen_from_Apollo_17.jpg/175px-The_Earth_seen_from_Apollo_17.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/Mouths_of_amazon_geocover_1990.png/250px-Mouths_of_amazon_geocover_1990.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/Aegopodium_podagraria1_ies.jpg/32px-Aegopodium_podagraria1_ies.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Earth_flag_PD.jpg/32px-Earth_flag_PD.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["community","ecology"],["flora","plants"],["fauna","animals"],["robert_bailey","geographer"],["list_of_terrestrial_ecoregions","wwf"],["conservation","ethic"],["list_of_terrestrial_ecoregions","wwf"]],"members":["conservation","flora","community","robert_bailey","fauna","list_of_terrestrial_ecoregions"],"related":["Ecology","Ecozone","Ecosystem","Community_(ecology)","Species","Biodiversity","Flora_(plants)","Fauna_(animals)","Ecosystems","Ecotone","Habitat","Biome","Mountain_range","Alps","Europe","Central_Eastern_Alps","Swiss_National_Park","Soil","Landform","Geographical","Ecosystems","Geology","Physiography","Hydrology","Fauna","Algorithmic","Robert_Bailey_(geographer)","Geomorphology","United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency","North_America","Commission_for_Environmental_Cooperation","World_Wildlife_Fund","Landscape_ecology","Agricultural","Conservationists","Global_200","Wildlife_conservation","Bioregionalism","Drainage_basin","Bioregional_democracy","Terrestrial_ecoregion","Earth","Ecologist","Earth","Ecozone","List_of_terrestrial_ecoregions_(WWF)","Bioregional_democracy","World_Wide_Fund_for_Nature","Continent","Himalayas","Sahara","Biome","Deserts_and_xeric_shrublands","Tropical","Subtropical","Temperate","Boreal_ecosystem","Conifer","Gymnosperm","Angiosperm","Mediterranean_forests,_woodlands,_and_scrub","Tundra","Mangroves","Marine_ecoregion","Wild_fisheries","Ocean","Marine_ecoregions","Conservation_(ethic)","Marine_ecosystems","Biomes","Marine_provinces","Marine_realms","Ecozones","National_Oceanic_and_Atmospheric_Administration","Freshwater_ecoregion","Wild_fisheries_of_the_world","Brazil","River","Stream","Lake","Wetland","World_Wildlife_Fund","Global_200","Biodiversity","Crisis_Ecoregions","Lists_of_ecoregions_by_country","List_of_freshwater_ecoregions_in_Africa_and_Madagascar","List_of_freshwater_ecoregions_of_Latin_America_and_the_Caribbean","List_of_marine_ecoregions","List_of_terrestrial_ecoregions_(WWF)"]}
