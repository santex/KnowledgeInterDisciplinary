As the\nfirst Grand Master he developed the Knights Hospitaller into a strong military\nforce. He made the eight-pointed cross the official symbol of the Order, which\nlater became known as the Maltese Cross after the establishment of the Order on\nMalta. Raymond also divided the membership of the Order into clerical, military,\nand serving brothers and established the first significant Hospitaller infirmary\nnear the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem. He was present at the\ncapture of Ascalon in 1153.\n\nAccording to The Great Historical Dictionary written by Louis Moreri in 1759:\n \"Raymond du Puy, the first grand master of the order of St. John of\nJerusalem, (who later became known as the Knights of Malta) succeeded Gerard as\nrector in 1118. He came from the province of DauphinÃ© and was of the illustrious\nhouse of du Puy... Raymond was elected by the brothers of the order, following\nthe disposition of the bull of Pope Paschal II, given in 1113, and was from then\non called Master of the Hospital of the City of Jerusalem to mark his authority.\nGerard had only used the name of Governor and Rector of the Hospital. Since\nthere were many gentlemen and men of arms among the ranks of the Order, he\nestablished a militia for the defense of religion against enemies of the Holy\nLand, while others were assigned to care for the poor and the sick at the\nhospital. To better succeed in his pious designs, he held the first general\nassembly and divided the order into three ranks: knights, men at arms, and\nchaplains. He also instituted a new constitution to improve the rules that\nGerard established. They were approved in 1123 by Pope Callixtus II and in 1130\nPope Innocent II gave the order their coat of arms, a silver cross (today known\nas the Maltese cross) in a field of blue (gueulles). Raymond armed his troops\nand offered them to Baldwin II of Jerusalem, to join him and his army in the\nfight against infidels. From that time on, there was never a battle that this\norder did not participate in. In the year 1153, the king of Jerusalem was ready\nto lift the siege of Ashkelon; however, Grand Master du Puy received permission\nto extend the siege and camp his army in front of the city. The city surrendered\nwithin a few days. Because of this conquest he acquired great glory and received\nthe esteem of the pope, Pope Anastasius IV, who granted many privileges to the\norder. Raymond thereafter built a magnificent palace which caused much jealousy\namong the prelates of Jerusalem and the holy land. But the order was supported\nby the supreme pontiff in his exemptions and in the privileges granted to them.\nRaymond du Puy died in 1160 and his successor was Auger de Balben. He was the\nfirst to assume, and the first to whom was given, the title of Grand Master of\nthe Order. He never used it except after Roger II of Sicily used the title in\nthe letters he wrote to Raymond\"
