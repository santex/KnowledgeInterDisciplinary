{"cursor":"7139","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nA 'physical property' is any property that is measurable whose value describes\na physical system's state. The changes in the physical properties of a system\ncan be used to describe its transformations (or evolutions between its\nmomentary states).\n\nPhysical properties can be intensive or extensive or neither. An intensive\nproperty does not depend on the size or amount of matter in the object, while an\nextensive property does in an additive manner. In addition to extensiveness,\nproperties can also be either isotropic if their values do not depend on the\ndirection of observation or anisotropic otherwise. Physical properties are\nreferred to as observables. They are not modal properties.\n\nOften, it is difficult to determine whether a given property is physical or not.\nColor, for example, can be \"seen\"; however, what we perceive as color is really\nan interpretation of the reflective properties of a surface. In this sense, many\nostensibly physical properties are termed as [[supervenience|supervenient]]. A\nsupervenient property is one which is actual (for dependence on the reflective\nproperties of a surface is not simply imagined), but is secondary to some\nunderlying reality. This is similar to the way in which objects are supervenient\non atomic structure. A \"cup\" might have the physical properties of mass, shape,\ncolor, temperature, etc., but these properties are supervenient on the\nunderlying atomic structure, which may in turn be supervenient on an underlying\nquantum structure.\n\nPhysical properties are contrasted with chemical properties which determine the\nway a material behaves in a chemical reaction.\n\nPhysical properties- Properties that do not change the chemical nature\nof matter.\n","linknr":197,"url":"Physical_property","recorded":1362508001,"links":27,"instances":["electromagnetic_radiation","physics_","mineralogy","electromagnetic_radiation_","optics_","physics","physics","physics","electromagnetism","philosophy"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Physical quantities"],"headings":["List of properties","Distinction from perceptions","See also","Bibliography","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["property","philosophy"],["absorption","chemistry"],["absorption","electromagnetic_radiation_"],["elasticity","physics_"],["emission","electromagnetic_radiation"],["intensity","physics"],["lustre","mineralogy"],["opacity","optics_"],["permeability","electromagnetism"],["plasticity","physics_"],["tension","physics"],["elasticity","physics"]],"members":["emission","plasticity","lustre","absorption","opacity","tension","elasticity","intensity","permeability","property"],"related":["Property_(philosophy)","Measurement","Physical_system","Intensive_and_extensive_properties","Isotropy","Anisotropy","Observable","Modal_property","Color","Chemical_property","Chemical_reaction","Classical_mechanics","Absorption_(chemistry)","Absorption_(electromagnetic_radiation)_","Albedo","Angular_momentum","Area","Brittleness","Boiling_point","Capacitance","Color","Concentration","Density","Dielectric","Ductility","Distribution_function","Efficacy","Elasticity_(physics)_","Electric_charge","Electrical_conductivity","Electrical_impedance","Electric_field","Electric_potential","Emission_(electromagnetic_radiation)","Flow_rate","Fluidity","Frequency","Hardness","Inductance","Intrinsic_impedance","Intensity_(physics)","Irradiance","Length","Absolute_location","Luminance","Luminescence","Lustre_(mineralogy)","Malleability","Magnetic_field","Magnetic_flux","Mass","Melting_point","Magnetic_moment","Momentum","Opacity_(optics)_","Permeability_(electromagnetism)","Permittivity","Plasticity_(physics)_","Pressure","Radiance","Solubility","Specific_heat","Resistivity","Reflectivity","Refractive_index","Rotation","Strength_of_materials","Stiffness","Temperature","Tension_(physics)","Thermal_conductivity","Velocity","Viscosity","Volume","Wave_impedance","Perception","Bijection","Temperature","Loudness","Sound_pressure_level","Acoustics","Hue","Color","Spectrum","Chemical_property","Physical_quantity","List_of_materials_properties","Physical_test","Test_method","Elasticity_(physics)","Hardness","Heat_conductivity","Oxford_University_Press","Academic_Press"]}
