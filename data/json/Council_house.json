{"cursor":"31497","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n, South Yorkshire]] A 'council house', otherwise known as a local authority\nhouse, is a form of public or social housing. The term is used primarily in the\nUnited Kingdom and Ireland. Council houses were built and operated by local\ncouncils to supply uncrowded, well-built homes on secure tenancies at reasonable\nrents to primarily working-class people. Council house development began in the\nlate 19th century and peaked in the mid-20th century, at which time council\nhousing included many large suburban \"council estates\" and numerous urban\ndevelopments featuring tower blocks. Many of these developments did not live up\nto the hopes of their supporters, and now suffer from urban blight.\n\nSince 1979, the role of council housing has been reduced by the introduction of\nright to buy legislation, and a change of emphasis to the development of new\nsocial housing by housing associations. Nonetheless, a substantial part of the\nUK population still lives in council housing. Approximately 40% of the countryâs\nsocial housing stock is owned by local authorities, 15% is managed by arm's\nlength management organisations, and 45% by housing associations. In\nScotland, council estates are known as schemes.\n","linknr":556,"url":"Council_house","recorded":1362540543,"links":40,"instances":["county","author","uk","flats","uk","district"],"pdf":[],"categories":["House types","Public housing in the
