If this is the case, then the matrix 'B'\nis uniquely determined by 'A' and is called the 'inverse' of 'A', denoted by\n'A'<sup>−1</sup>. It follows from the theory of matrices that if\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{AB} = \\mathbf{I} \\ </math>\n\nfor finite square matrices 'A' and 'B', then also\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{BA} = \\mathbf{I}. \\ </math><ref>.</ref>\n\nNon-square matrices (m-by-n matrices for which m ≠ n) do not have an inverse.\nHowever, in some cases such a matrix may have a left inverse or right inverse.\nIf 'A' is m-by-n and the rank of 'A' is equal to n, then 'A' has a left inverse:\nan n-by-m matrix 'B' such that 'BA'&nbsp;=&nbsp;'I'. If 'A' has rank m, then it\nhas a right inverse: an n-by-m matrix 'B' such that 'AB'&nbsp;=&nbsp;'I'.\n\n A square matrix that is not invertible is called 'singular' or 'degenerate'.\n A square matrix is singular if and only if its determinant is 0. Singular\n matrices are rare in the sense that if you pick a random square matrix over\n a continuous uniform distribution on its entries, it will almost surely not\n be singular.\n\nWhile the most common case is that of matrices over the real or complex numbers,\nall these definitions can be given for matrices over any commutative ring.\nHowever, in this case the condition for a square matrix to be invertible is that\nits determinant is invertible in the ring, which in general is a much stricter\nrequirement than being nonzero. The conditions for existence of left-inverse\nresp. right-inverse are more complicated since a notion of rank does not exist\nover rings.\n\n'Matrix inversion' is the process of finding the matrix 'B' that satisfies the\nprior equation for a given invertible matrix 'A'.\n","title":"invertible%20matrix","headings":["Properties","Methods of matrix inversion","Derivative of the matrix inverse","{{anchor|Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse}}Moore–Penrose pseudoinverse","Applications","See also","Notes","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["5: Determinant","3: Identity_matrix","3: LU_decomposition","2: Inverse_element#Matrices","2: Row_equivalence","2: Linear_independence","2: Basis_of_a_vector_space","2: Transpose","2: GaussâJordan_elimination","2: Newton's_method","2: Matrix_of_cofactors","2: Binomial_inverse_theorem","2: MooreâPenrose_pseudoinverse","1: Linear_algebra","1: Matrix_multiplication","1: If_and_only_if","1: Continuous_uniform_distribution","1: Almost_surely","1: Real_number","1: Complex_number","1: Pivot_position","1: Commutative_ring","1: Null_space","1: Linear_span","1: Bijection","1: Eigenvalue","1: Elementary_matrix","1: Involutory_matrix","1: Null_set","1: Lebesgue_measure","1: Measure_zero","1: Measure_theory","1: Almost_all","1: Dense_set","1: Open_set","1: Topological_space","1: Closed_set","1: Nowhere_dense","1: Numerical_analysis","1: Condition_number#Matrices","1: Algorithm","1: Multiplicative_inverse#Algorithms","1: Victor_Pan","1: John_Reif","1: Homotopy","1: Square_root_of_a_matrix","1: Matrix_square_root#By_Denman.E2.80.93Beavers_iteration","1: Round-off_error","1: Nonsingular","1: Diagonal_matrix","1: Positive_definite_matrix","1: Cholesky_decomposition","1: Adjugate_matrix","1: Rule_of_Sarrus","1: Cross_product","1: Triple_product","1: Parallelepiped","1: Block_matrix","1: Schur_complement","1: Hans_Boltz","1: Tadeusz_Banachiewicz","1: Nullity_theorem","1: Matrix_multiplication#Algorithms_for_efficient_matrix_multiplication","1: Ran_Raz","1: Divide_and_conquer_algorithm","1: Neumann_series","1: Preconditioner","1: System_of_linear_equations","1: Computer_graphics","1: 3D_graphics","1: MIMO","1: Matrix_decomposition","1: Matrix_square_root","1: Pseudoinverse","1: Singular_value_decomposition","1: Woodbury_matrix_identity","1: Google_books"]}
