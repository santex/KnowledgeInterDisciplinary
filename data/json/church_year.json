Distinct liturgical colours may appear in connection with different\nseasons of the liturgical year. The dates of the festivals vary somewhat between\nthe different churches, though the sequence and logic is largely the same.\n\nIn both East and West, the dates of many feasts vary from year to year, usually\nin line with the variation in the date of Easter, with which most other moveable\nfeasts are associated. The extent to which feasts and festivals are celebrated\nalso varies between churches; in general, Protestant churches observe far fewer\nthan Catholic and Orthodox, in particular with regard to feasts of the Virgin\nMary and the other Saints.\n",
