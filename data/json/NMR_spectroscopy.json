{"cursor":"25806","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" magnet at HWB-NMR , Birmingham, UK]] 'Nuclear\n magnetic resonance spectroscopy', most commonly known as 'NMR spectroscopy', is\n a research technique that exploits the magnetic properties of certain atomic\n nuclei . It determines the physical and chemical properties of atoms or the\n molecules in which they are contained. It relies on the phenomenon of nuclear\n magnetic resonance and can provide detailed information about the structure,\n dynamics, reaction state, and chemical environment of molecules.\n\nMost frequently, NMR spectroscopy is used by chemists and biochemists to\ninvestigate the properties of organic molecules, though it is applicable to any\nkind of sample that contains nuclei possessing spin. Suitable samples range\nfrom small compounds analyzed with 1-dimensional proton or carbon-13 NMR\nspectroscopy to large proteins or nucleic acids using 3 or 4-dimensional\ntechniques. The impact of NMR spectroscopy on the sciences has been substantial\nbecause of the range of information and the diversity of samples, including\nsolutions and solids.\n","linknr":342,"url":"NMR_spectroscopy","recorded":1362509616,"links":40,"instances":["physics","nmr","magnetism","unit"],"pdf":["http://www-keeler.ch.cam.ac.uk/lectures/Irvine/chapter2.pdf","http://www-keeler.ch.cam.ac.uk/lectures/Irvine/chapter2.pdf"],"categories":["Spectroscopy","Nuclear magnetic resonance"],"headings":["Basic NMR techniques","Correlation spectroscopy","Solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance","Biomolecular NMR spectroscopy","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f9/HWB-NMR_-_900MHz_-_21.2_Tesla.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/NMR_sample.JPG/200px-NMR_sample.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/44/Lipscomb-NMR-hexaborene-B6H10.png/220px-Lipscomb-NMR-hexaborene-B6H10.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f2/1H_NMR_Ethanol_Coupling_shown.GIF/450px-1H_NMR_Ethanol_Coupling_shown.GIF","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["spin","physics"],["tesla","unit"],["shim","magnetism"],["relaxation","nmr"]],"members":["spin","relaxation","shim","tesla"],"related":["Magnetism","Atomic_nucleus","Atom","Molecule","Nuclear_magnetic_resonance","Organic_molecule","Spin_(physics)","Proton_NMR","Carbon-13_NMR","Protein","Nucleic_acid","Solution","Solid-state_chemistry","Electromagnetic_radiation","Isotope","Tesla_(unit)","Proton","Megahertz","Nuclear_magnetic_moment","Tetramethylsilane","Shim_(magnetism)","Parts_per_billion","Millisecond","Degenerate_energy_level","Integral","Carbon-13","Hyperfine_coupling","Chemical_shift","Hydrogen","Hydroxyl_group","Methyl_group","Methylene_group","Spin-spin_coupling","Pascal's_triangle","Cyclic_compound","Aromatic","Spin_quantum_number","2D-NMR","Acronym","Correlation_spectroscopy","Nuclear_Overhauser_effect","HSQC","HMQC","HMBC","Molecule","Richard_R._Ernst","Magic_angle","Protein","Protein_NMR","Structural_biology","X-ray_crystallography","KDa","Intrinsically_unstructured_proteins","Conformation_Activity_Relationship","Order_of_magnitude","Isotope","Nuclear_Overhauser_effect","Distance_geometry","Nucleic_acid","DNA","RNA","Nucleic_acid_double_helix","Proton_NMR","Carbon-13_NMR","Nitrogen-15_NMR","Phosphorus-31_NMR","Two-dimensional_NMR","Nuclear_Overhauser_effect","J-coupling","Glycosidic_bond","Dihedral_angle","Karplus_equation","Coaxial_stacking","Stem-loop","Pseudoknot","Carbohydrate","Distance_geometry","Earth's_field_NMR","In_vivo_magnetic_resonance_spectroscopy","Functional_magnetic_resonance_spectroscopy_of_the_brain","Low_field_NMR","Magnetic_Resonance_Imaging","NMR_crystallography","NMR_spectra_database","NMR_tube","NMR_spectroscopy_of_stereoisomers","Nuclear_Magnetic_Resonance","Nuclear_magnetic_resonance_spectroscopy_of_carbohydrates","Nuclear_magnetic_resonance_spectroscopy_of_nucleic_acids","Nuclear_magnetic_resonance_spectroscopy_of_proteins","Relaxation_(NMR)","Triple-resonance_nuclear_magnetic_resonance_spectroscopy"]}
