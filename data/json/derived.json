This\nmay also refer to structures that are not present in an organism, but were\npresent in its ancestors, i.e. traits that have undergone secondary loss. Here\nthe lack of a structure is a derived trait.\n\nFor the sake of precision, the term \"derived\" is preferred to \"advanced,\" a term\nwhich may inaccurately imply superiority. Simplicity is often secondarily\nderived.<ref name=Clark1999></ref> For example, the absence of mitochondria in\nthe anaerobic protist [[Entamoeba histolytica]] is a result of their secondary\nloss, and when considered in the context of eukaryotes as a whole, is a derived\ntrait.<ref></ref> Likewise, the primitive character state for birds (i.e. the\nstate possessed by their last common ancestor) is flight, which was secondarily\nlost by penguins and dodos.\n\nWhether or not a trait is considered derived depends on the group in question.\nFor example, among the (crown group) tetrapods, having five fingers is the\nprimitive trait - as their last common ancestor bore a five-digit hand. However,\namongst the vertebrates, five fingers is a derived trait, as the last common\nancestor to the vertebrates did not even bear fingers.\n","title":"Derived%20trait","headings":["References"]},"micro-relation":["1: Phylogenetics","1: Mitochondria","1: Protist"]}
