Built on the chassis of the famous\nFord T and armoured with re-used armoured plates, the car was a successful\ndesign for its time. The main designer was the engineer Tadeusz TaÅski. The\narmoured vehicle originated on account of the high demand during the Polish-\nSoviet war in 1920.\n\nAfter the outbreak of the Polish-Soviet War in 1919, the Polish Army was\nseverely under-equipped. Except for a number of FT-17 tanks that arrived with\nthe Blue Army formed in France, the Polish forces lacked any armoured\nreconnaissance vehicles. During the Soviet offensive leading to the battle of\nWarsaw the situation became even more tragic as many Austin-Putilov Amoured Cars\ncaptured from the Red Army were retaken by the Bolsheviks. It was then that\nengineer Tadeusz TaÅski, a renowned inventor and a worker of the Ministry of\nMilitary Affairs, designed his armoured car. The project originated within only\n2 weeks from Tanskiâs initiative. The prototype was prepared in less than two\nweeks in the Gerlach i Pulsing works in Warsaw. After a series of tests the\nproduction started, and each of the battle-ready cars was immediately dispatched\nto the front-line and attached to various units. Altogether a series of 16 or 17\ncars were made.\n\nThe project was based on the successful Ford Model T, one of the most popular\ncars of the epoch. The chassis and the levers were significantly reinforced and\nthe fuel tank was moved. In addition, the crank was extended to allow for\nstarting the engine from the inside and the dashboard had been modified. The\narmoured plating was handmade out of scrapped German armoured trench shields,\nand attached to the chassis by bolts.\n\nThe FT-B cars took part in the later stage of the Polish-Soviet war and fought\nin the battles along the Wkra river and in the battle of Warsaw, as well as the\nbattle of Kowel and in numerous other battles.\n\nThe high speed, agility, and uncomplicated servicing and repair (thanks to the\ncommercial Ford T chassis) were among the advantages of the vehicle. The\narmoured vehicles managed In spite of the extra weight of the armour, the\nvehicles managed well in heavy terrain, and were also able to cross relatively\nweak bridges on account of their low mass in comparison to other armoured\nvehicles. The Ford Tf C was really small in comparison to other armoured\nvehicles of the era, being for example half the size of the Austin-Putilov, and\noffered a smaller target. Nevertheless, the consequence was that Ford Tf C were\nvery cramped inside, and the driver had to steer from a squatting position.\nAnother problem was engine overheating during longer cross-countrydrives, or\nwith let down cooler armour plating. Also the springs were overloaded in spite\nof strengthening, but the vehicle was urgently required and the advantages\noffset the defects. In 1921 Tanski offered to build another series of 30\nvehicles; however, this was rejected, because the war was over and no other\narmoured vehicles were required. 12 Fords Tf C armored vehicles outlasted the\nwar and were in use until 1931. Some had proper names such as \"Osa\" (wasp),\n\"Mucha\" (fly), and \"Komar\" (mosquito) painted on their armor.\n","linknr":113,"url":"Ford_FT-B","recorded":1375081689,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Ford_FT-B&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Ford_FT-B&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:External_links","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources#Inline_citations","/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Fact_and_Reference_Check","/wiki/File:Ford_FT-B.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8b/Ford_FT-B.jpg/300px-Ford_FT-B.jpg","/wiki/Armored_car_(military)","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/12/Flag_of_Poland.svg/23px-Flag_of_Poland.svg.png","/wiki/Poland","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/12/Flag_of_Poland.svg/23px-Flag_of_Poland.svg.png","/wiki/Poland","/wiki/Polish-Bolshevik_War","/wiki/Tadeusz_Ta%C5%84ski","/wiki/Vehicle_armour","/wiki/Maschinengewehr_08","/wiki/Hand_grenade","/wiki/Armored_car_(military)","/wiki/Poland","/wiki/Ford_T","/wiki/Tadeusz_Ta%C5%84ski","/wiki/Polish-Soviet_war","/wiki/Polish-Soviet_War","/wiki/Polish_Army","/wiki/FT-17","/wiki/Blue_Army_(Poland)","/wiki/Battle_of_Warsaw_(1920)","/w/index.php?title=Austin-Putilov_Amoured_Cars&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Bolsheviks","/wiki/Tadeusz_Ta%C5%84ski","/wiki/Ford_Model_T","/wiki/Polish-Soviet_war","/w/index.php?title=Wkra_river&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Battle_of_Warsaw","//toolserver.org/%7Edispenser/cgi-bin/dab_solver.py?page=Ford_FT-B&editintro=Template:Disambiguation_needed/editintro&client=Template:Dn","/wiki/Battle_of_Kowel","/w/index.php?title=Ford_FT-B&action=edit&section=1","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ford_FT-B&oldid=541481611","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Armoured_fighting_vehicles_of_the_interwar_period","/wiki/Category:Armoured_cars_of_Poland","/wiki/Category:Articles_lacking_in-text_citations_from_November_2009","/wiki/Category:All_articles_lacking_in-text_citations","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_links_needing_disambiguation_from_February_2012","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Ford+FT-B&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Ford+FT-B","/wiki/Ford_FT-B","/wiki/Talk:Ford_FT-B","#","/wiki/Ford_FT-B","/w/index.php?title=Ford_FT-B&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Ford_FT-B&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Ford_FT-B","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Ford_FT-B","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Ford_FT-B&oldid=541481611","/w/index.php?title=Ford_FT-B&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1150464","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Ford_FT-B&id=541481611","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Ford+FT-B","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Ford+FT-B&oldid=541481611&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Ford_FT-B&printable=yes","//hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_FT%E2%80%93B","//ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%95%E3%82%A9%E3%83%BC%E3%83%89FT-B","//pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_FT-B","//ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_FT-B","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1150464#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/w
