{"cursor":"4910","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Dun Karm' (Ä¦aÅ¼-Å»ebbuÄ¡, 18 October 1871 – 13 October 1961),89, was\na Maltese writer and poet, sometimes called 'the bard of Malta' [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9044743/Dun-\nKarm Dun Karm - Britannica Online Encyclopedia ]\n\nHe was educated at the Seminary between the years 1885 and 1894 and then\nproceeded to study philosophy in 1888 and theology in 1890 the\nUniversity of Malta.\n\nHe was ordained priest in 1894. From 1895 to 1921 he taught various subjects at\nthe Seminary: Italian, Latin, English, arithmetic, geography, cosmography,\necclesiastical history and Christian archaeology. In 1921 he was appointed\nassistant librarian at the National Library of Malta and in 1923 directory of\ncirculating libraries, a post he held till his retirement in 1936.\n\nIn 1921, Albert Laferla, the director of education, asked Dun Karm to compose\nsome verses to a music score by Robert Samut. The [[Innu Malti]] was sung for\nthe first time in 1923. In 1941 it was officially designated the national\nanthem, a status confirmed by the Constitution at independence in 1964.\n\nIn 1921 Dun Karm was one of the founding members of the GÄ§aqda tal-Kittieba tal-\nMalti and on the death of Ä uÅ¼Ã¨ Muscat Azzopardi in 1927, he was elected\npresident of the GÄ§aqda and later editor of the official organ, Il-Malti. He\ncarried out these functions till 1942 when he was nominated honorary president\nof the ghaqda for life. In recognition of his contribution to Maltese\nliterature, he was granted a D. Litt (honoris causa) by the Royal University of\nMalta in 1945 - the first time the University granted such an honour. A year\nlater he was awarded the Ä uÅ¼Ã¨ Muscat Azzopardi gold medal. Queen Elizabeth II\ndecorated him with the Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1956. In\n1957 the Maltese government issued him an ex-gratia pension in recognition of\nhis services to Maltese literature. During his lifetime he was also honoured as\nthe National Poet of Malta.\n\nBefore 1912 Dun Karm wrote only in Italian. His first known published poem is La\nDignitÃ  Episcopale (1889) after which he published Foglie d'Allora (1896) and\nVersi (1903) another collection of Italian poems.\n\nDun Karm wrote Quddiem Xbieha tal-Madonna his first poem in Maltese, which\nappeared in the first issue of the Maltese periodical Il-Ä¦abib, published by\nMgr. Pawl Galea and Ä uÅ¼Ã¨ Muscat Azzopardi. His best poems include Il-MusbieÄ§ tal-\nMuÅ¼ew (1920).\n\nDun Karm often found poetic expression in his solitude, which was eventually\naccompanied by a high degree of spiritual balance. His poetry reflects a\nbackground of village life crowned with an atmosphere of family feelings and it\nalso portrays the Maltese countryside with a perspective imagination. It\nsynthesises the popular culture of the Maltese people, which is quite evident\nfrom the rural characteristics that furnish its local identity with the literary\nculture based largely on Italian romanticism.\n\nHis first works in Italian reveal an early life of peace and calm; after the\ndeath of his mother, solitude became his companion. When he decided to make\nMaltese the medium of his creativity he poetically explored the history of\nMalta to confirm its cultural and national identity. At the same time some of\nhis best poems illustrate an inner journey of sentimental and more experience.\nHis poetry exhibits great subjectivity but it also expresses his country\ncollective aspirations. Both the personal and the national sentiments are\ntreated from a deep religious viewpoint that discusses existentialism The\nspiritual crisis in Il-Jien u lil hinn Minnu is analyzed in universal human\nterms that illuminate man's existence and insist on the inexplicability of the\nrelations between God and man, except for the latter's absolute acceptance of\nthe formers hidden power.\n\nA.J. Arberry translated about 37 of Dun Karm's poems into English, Guze Delia\ntranslated Il-Vjatku into Spanish and Laurent Ropa translated Il-Jien u lil hinn\nMinnu into French.\n\nDun Karm's writings include Å»ewÄ¡ AnÄ¡li: Inez u Emilia (translated in 1934 from\nan Italian novel by D Caprile) Besides these he wrote a few critical works. He\nalso compiled a dictionary between 1947 and 1955 in three volumes, Dizzjunarju\nIngliÅ¼ u Malti.\n\n\n","linknr":110,"url":"Dun_Karm_Psaila","recorded":1375077000,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Dun_Karm_Psaila&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Dun_Karm_Psaila&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/%C4%A6a%C5%BC-%C5%BBebbu%C4%A1","/wiki/Malta","#cite_note-britannica.com-1","/wiki/University_of_Malta","/wiki/National_Library_of_Malta","/w/index.php?title=Albert_Laferla&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Robert_Samut","/wiki/Innu_Malti","/wiki/National_anthem","/wiki/%C4%A0u%C5%BC%C3%A8_Muscat_Azzopardi","/wiki/Maltese_literature","/wiki/Elizabeth_II","/wiki/Order_of_the_British_Empire","/wiki/Italian_language","/w/index.php?title=Pawl_Galea&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/%C4%A0u%C5%BC%C3%A8_Muscat_Azzopardi","/wiki/Maltese_people","/wiki/Romanticism","/wiki/Maltese_language","/wiki/History_of_Malta","#cite_note-britannica.com-1","/w/index.php?title=Dun_Karm_Psaila&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-britannica.com_1-0","#cite_ref-britannica.com_1-1","http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9044743/Dun-Karm","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dun_Karm_Psaila&oldid=554590654","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Maltese_poets","/wiki/Category:1871_births","/wiki/Category:1961_deaths","/wiki/Category:National_anthem_writers","/wiki/Category:Use_dmy_dates_from_January_2012","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Dun+Karm+Psaila&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Dun+Karm+Psaila","/wiki/Dun_Karm_Psaila","/wiki/Talk:Dun_Karm_Psaila","#","/wiki/Dun_Karm_Psaila","/w/index.php?title=Dun_Karm_Psaila&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Dun_Karm_Psaila&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Dun_Karm_Psaila","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Dun_Karm_Psaila","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Dun_Karm_Psaila&oldid=554590654","/w/index.php?title=Dun_Karm_Psaila&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q575350","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Dun_Karm_Psaila&id=554590654","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Dun+Karm+Psaila","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Dun+Karm+Psaila&oldid=554590654&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Dun_Karm_Psaila&printable=yes","//de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dun_Karm_Psaila","//es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dun_Karm_Psaila","//eo.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dun_Karm","//fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dun_Karm_Psaila","//it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmelo_Psaila","//hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karmenu_Psaila","//mt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dun_Karm_Psaila","//pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dun_Karm_Psaila","//fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dun_Karm_Psaila","//sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dun_Karm_Psaila","//tr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dun_Karm_Psaila","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q575350#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dun_Karm_Psaila","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&m
