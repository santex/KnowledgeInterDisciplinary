This cup measures volume in units of\n cups, fluid ounces, and millilitres.]] 'Volume' is the quantity of three-\n dimensional space enclosed by some closed boundary, for example, the space that\n a substance (solid, liquid, gas, or plasma) or shape occupies or contains.<ref>\n\n</ref> Volume is often quantified numerically using the SI derived unit, the\ncubic metre. The volume of a container is generally understood to be the\ncapacity of the container, i. e. the amount of fluid (gas or liquid) that the\ncontainer could hold, rather than the amount of space the container itself\ndisplaces.\n\nThree dimensional mathematical shapes are also assigned volumes. Volumes of some\nsimple shapes, such as regular, straight-edged, and circular shapes can be\neasily calculated using arithmetic formulas<!--- both \"formulae\" and \"formulas\"\nare correct plurals of \"formula\" --->. The volumes of more complicated shapes\ncan be calculated by integral calculus if a formula exists for the shape's\nboundary. One-dimensional figures (such as lines) and two-dimensional shapes\n(such as squares) are assigned zero volume in the three-dimensional space.\n\nThe volume of a solid (whether regularly or irregularly shaped) can be\ndetermined by fluid displacement. Displacement of liquid can also be used to\ndetermine the volume of a gas. The combined volume of two substances is usually\ngreater than the volume of one of the substances. However, sometimes one\nsubstance dissolves in the other and the combined volume is not\nadditive.<ref>One litre of sugar (about 970 grams) can dissolve in 0.6 litres of\nhot water, producing a total volume of less than one litre. </ref>\n\nIn [[differential geometry]], volume is expressed by means of the volume form,\nand is an important global Riemannian invariant. In [[thermodynamics]], volume\nis a fundamental parameter, and is a conjugate variable to pressure.\n","title":"volume","headings":["Units","Related terms","Volume formulas","Volume formula derivations","See also","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["3: Integral_calculus","3: Integral","2: Liquid","2: Fluid_ounce","2: Millilitre","2: Volume_form","2: Pint","2: Quart","2: Gallon","2: Length","2: Litre","2: Sphere","2: Surface_area","1: Quantity","1: Three-dimensional_space","1: Solid","1: Gas","1: SI_derived_unit","1: Cubic_metre","1: Formula","1: Additive_function","1: Riemannian_geometry","1: Gas_volume","1: Pressure","1: Cube","1: Cubic_centimetre","1: Centimetre","1: International_System_of_Units","1: Metric_system","1: Cubic_inch","1: Cubic_foot","1: Cubic_mile","1: Teaspoon","1: Tablespoon","1: Fluid_dram","1: Peck","1: Bushel","1: Hogshead","1: Capacity_management","1: Thermodynamics","1: Volumetric_flow_rate","1: Fluid_dynamics","1: Rectangular_prism","1: Ellipsoid","1: Circle","1: Tetrahedron","1: H._S._M._Coxeter","1: Parallelepiped","1: Archimedes","1: Perimeter","1: Area","1: Mass","1: Weight","1: Conversion_of_units#Volume","1: Dimensional_weight","1: Dimensioning","1: Banach–Tarski_paradox"]}
