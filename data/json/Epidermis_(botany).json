(),\n6.  ,\n7.  ]] The 'epidermis' (from the Greek \"ÎµÏÎ¯Î´ÎµÏÎ¼Î¯Î´Î±\", meaning \"over-skin\") is a\n    single-layered group of cells that covers plants' leaves, flowers, roots and\n    stems. It forms a boundary between the plant and the external environment.\n    The epidermis serves several functions, it protects against water loss,\n    regulates gas exchange, secretes metabolic compounds, and (especially in\n    roots) absorbs water and mineral nutrients. The epidermis of most leaves\n    shows dorsoventral anatomy: the upper (adaxial) and lower (abaxial) surfaces\n    have somewhat different construction and may serve different functions.\n    Woody stems and some other stem structures produce a secondary covering\n    called the periderm that replaces the epidermis as the protective covering.\n","linknr":211,"url":"Epidermis_(botany)","recorded":1362582482,"links":40,"instances":["optics","chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Plant anatomy","Tissues"],"headings":["Description","Guard cells","Cell differentiation in the epidermis","References","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/92/Stem-histology-cross-section-tag.svg/250px-Stem-histology-cross-section-tag.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/Leaf_Tissue_Structure.svg/600px-Leaf_Tissue_Structure.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/Leaf_Structure.svg/600px-Leaf_Structure.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/92/Tomato_leaf_stomate_1.jpg/240px-Tomato_leaf_stomate_1.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/Leaf_epidermis_w_scale.jpg/220px-Leaf_epidermis_w_scale.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["transparency","optics"],["analog","chemistry"]],"members":["transparency","analog"],"related":["Leaf","Flowers","Plant_stem","Plant","Periderm","Parenchyma","Transparency_(optics)","Cutin","Plant_cuticle","Epicuticular_wax","Monocot","Dicot","Trichome","Root_hairs","Secondary_growth","Cork_cambium","Stomata","Poaceae","Trichome","Stoma","Pavement_cell","Guard_cell","Stomata","Trichome","Conical_cell","Genetics","Leaf","Gene","Plant_hormone","Gibberellin","Endoreplication","DNA","Cell_division","Conical_cell","Petal","Flower","Analog_(chemistry)","Cellular_differentiation","Transcription_factor","Plant_respiration","Subsidiary_cell","Dicot","Monocot","Random","Mutant","Asymmetric_cell_division","Density","Ethylene","Cytokines","Plasmodesmata","Bark","Cork_cambium","Periderm"]}
