It differs from other digital adders in that it\noutputs two numbers of the same dimensions as the inputs, one which is a\nsequence of partial sum bits and another which is a sequence of carry bits.\n","linknr":103,"url":"Carry-save_adder","recorded":1362667064,"links":12,"instances":["arithmetic"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Binary arithmetic","Adders"],"headings":["Motivation","The basic concept","Carry-save accumulators","Drawbacks","Technical details","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/math/1/c/7/1c71652a2558a611c71ecf02cf77eb45.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/d/d/9/dd9408c01c45a6155bf1b58898b47a95.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["adder","electronics"],["carry","arithmetic"],["adder","electronics#full_adder"],["adder","electronics#ripple_carry_adder"]],"members":["adder","carry"],"related":["Adder_(electronics)","Binary_numeral_system","Carry_(arithmetic)","Carry_look-ahead_adder","Public-key_cryptography","John_von_Neumann","Redundant_binary_representation","Montgomery_multiplication","Logical_shift","Most_significant_bit"]}
