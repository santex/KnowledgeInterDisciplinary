They had observed that European ships came from the\nwest, from the direction of the setting sun, the location, they believed of\nKuranup, the land of the departed spirits of the dead. The fact that Europeans\nseemed ignorant of Aboriginal language and culture confirmed for the Noongar\nthat these people had somehow forgotten who they were and where they really came\nfrom, typical of the spirit of a dead person.\n\nThe fact that Europeans were returned spirits of the dead, was reported in the\ncase of George Grey, who was recognised by one Aboriginal woman as the spirit of\nher dead son. Despite offers from fellow Europeans to drive the woman and her\nfamily away, Grey accepted the association, allowing a kenning (or\n[[corroboree]]) to be performed by the family in his honour.\n\nThe association of Europeans with the spirits of the dead was confirmed by many\nother characteristics of the first settlement. Europeans odours were found\noffensive to Aboriginal people, as clothes were frequently not washed for long\nperiods, and bathing of the British settlers was not frequent. The odours were\nconsidered similar to the odours that accompanied corpses. Similarly, as\nindigenous Aboriginal people did not have resistance to many diseases that\naccompanied the Europeans (measles epidemics swept through the state repeatedly\nin the early 1930s killing many Aboriginal people, and Aboriginal people were\nnot included in smallpox vaccination programs made available to white settlers.\n\nThese findings may account in part for the attempts of Aboriginal people, after\nan initial period of welcome and trade, to withdraw from further contact for a\nwhile. (Other reasons include the expropriation of Aboriginal lands and\nterritories, the indiscriminate killing of kangaroo and other Australian\nwildlife by Europeans, and the violent punishment meted out to Aboriginal people\nfor spearing European livestock or for digging traditional [[bush tucker]] from\nEuropean claimed land).\n\nDjanga has not been used for Europeans much since the 1940s. The term used by\nNoongar and other Western Australian Aboriginal Groups for European settlers now\nis \"Wetjala\", derived from the English term \"white fella\".\n","linknr":88,"url":"Djanga","recorded":1375069604,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Djanga&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Djanga&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Djanga,_Burkina_Faso","#cite_note-1","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Noongar","/wiki/Australian_Aboriginal","/wiki/Western_Australia","/wiki/George_Grey","/wiki/Corroboree","/wiki/Measles","/wiki/Epidemic","/wiki/Smallpox","/wiki/Vaccination","/wiki/Bush_tucker","/w/index.php?title=Djanga&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","/wiki/George_Fletcher_Moore","//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Diary_of_ten_years_eventful_life_of_an_early_settler_in_Western_Australia_and_also_A_descriptive_vocabulary_of_the_language_of_the_aborigines/A_descriptive_vocabulary_of_the_language_in_common_use_amongst_the_aborigines_of_Western_Australia/Part_1/D#Dj.C4.83ndga","/wiki/A_Descriptive_Vocabulary_of_the_Language_in_Common_Use_Amongst_the_Aborigines_of_Western_Australia","#cite_ref-2","http://kiangardarup.blogspot.com/2005/02/minang-and-destruction-of-southern.html","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Djanga&oldid=564884854","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Australian_Aboriginal_words_and_phrases","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Djanga&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Djanga","/wiki/Djanga","/wiki/Talk:Djanga","#","/wiki/Djanga","/w/index.php?title=Djanga&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Djanga&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Djanga","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Djanga","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Djanga&oldid=564884854","/w/index.php?title=Djanga&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5285228","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Djanga&id=564884854","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Djanga","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Djanga&oldid=564884854&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Djanga&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5285228#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Djanga","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Australian Aboriginal words and phrases"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Noongar","Australian_Aboriginal","Western_Australia","George_Grey","Measles","Epidemic","Smallpox","Vaccination"]}
