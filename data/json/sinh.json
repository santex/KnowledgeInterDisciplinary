The basic hyperbolic functions are\nthe 'hyperbolic sine' \"sinh\" ( or ), and the 'hyperbolic cosine' \"cosh\" ,\nfrom which are derived the 'hyperbolic tangent' \"tanh\" ( or ), 'hyperbolic\ncosecant' \"csch\" or \"cosech\" , 'hyperbolic secant' \"sech\" , and\n'hyperbolic cotangent' \"coth\" ,<ref>[http://www.mathcentre.ac.uk/resource-\ns/workbooks/mathcentre/hyperbolicfunctions.pdf tanh]</ref> corresponding\nto the derived trigonometric functions. The inverse hyperbolic functions\nare the 'area hyperbolic sine' \"arsinh\" (also called \"asinh\" or sometimes\n\"arcsinh\")<ref>[http://www.google.com/books?q=arcsinh+-library Some\nexamples of using 'arcsinh'] found in Google Books.</ref> and so on.\n\nJust as the points (cos&nbsp;t,&nbsp;sin&nbsp;t) form a circle with a unit\nradius, the points (cosh&nbsp;t,&nbsp;sinh&nbsp;t) form the right half of the\nequilateral hyperbola. Hyperbolic functions occur in the solutions of some\nimportant linear differential equations, for example the equation defining a\ncatenary, of some cubic equations, and of Laplace's equation in Cartesian\ncoordinates. The latter is important in many areas of physics, including\nelectromagnetic theory, heat transfer, fluid dynamics, and special relativity.\n\nThe hyperbolic functions take real values for a real argument called a\nhyperbolic angle. The size of a hyperbolic angle is the area of its hyperbolic\nsector. The hyperbolic functions may be defined in terms of the legs of a right\ntriangle covering this sector.\n\nIn complex analysis, the hyperbolic functions arise as the imaginary parts of\nsine and cosine. When considered defined by a complex variable, the hyperbolic\nfunctions are rational functions of exponentials, and are hence meromorphic.\n\nHyperbolic functions were introduced in the 1760s independently by Vincenzo\nRiccati and Johann Heinrich Lambert.<ref>Robert E. Bradley, Lawrence A.\nD'Antonio, Charles Edward Sandifer. Euler at 300: an appreciation. Mathematical\nAssociation of America, 2007.
