He described the Dobuan character as \"paranoid\", obsessed with black\nmagic, and as having extremely unusual attitudes toward sex and violence.\n\nFortune's account was reiterated by Ruth Benedict in her popular work Patterns\nof Culture. However, many later anthropologists expressed skepticism.

In\nparticular, Kuehling's interest lies at the intersection of ethics and\npersonal conduct.\n","linknr":239,"url":"Dobu","recorded":1362480940,"links":24,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Islands of Papua New Guinea","Milne Bay Province"],"headings":["References","Sources","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/CHIEF_GAGANAMOLE_AND_WIFE%2C_DOBU.jpg/220px-CHIEF_GAGANAMOLE_AND_WIFE%2C_DOBU.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/Flag-map_of_Papua_New_Guinea.svg/40px-Flag-map_of_Papua_New_Guinea.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["D'Entrecasteaux_Islands","Papua_New_Guinea","Fergusson_Island","Normanby_Island,_Papua_New_Guinea","Reo_Fortune","Ruth_Benedict"]}
