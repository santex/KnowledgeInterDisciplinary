In general, a military base provides\naccommodations for one or more units, but it may also be used as a command\ncenter, a training ground, or a proving ground. In most cases, a military base\nrelies on some outside help in order to operate. However, certain complex bases\nare able to endure by themselves for long periods because they are able to\nprovide food, water and other life support necessities for their inhabitants\nwhile under siege.\n\nThe military sense of the word base dates from the 1860s.\n",
