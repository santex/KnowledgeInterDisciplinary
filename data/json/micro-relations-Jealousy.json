In the original broad meaning\nused in this article, jealousy is distinct from [[envy]], though the two terms\nhave popularly become synonymous in the English language, with both now taking\non the narrower definition originally used for envy alone.\n\nJealousy is a familiar experience in human relationships.

ISBN\n978-0-89862-555-4\n\nJealousy is often reinforced as a series of particularly strong emotions and\nconstructed as a universal human experience; it has been a theme of many\nartistic works. Psychologists have proposed several models of the processes\nunderlying jealousy and have identified factors that result in jealousy.\nSociologists have demonstrated that cultural beliefs and values play an\nimportant role in determining what triggers jealousy and what constitutes\nsocially acceptable expressions of jealousy. Biologists have identified factors\nthat may unconsciously influence the expression of jealousy. Artists have\nexplored the theme of jealousy in photographs, paintings, movies, songs, plays,\npoems, and books. Theologians have offered religious views of jealousy based on\nthe scriptures of their respective faiths.\n","linknr":518,"url":"Jealousy","recorded":1362373737,"links":60,"instances":["relational_transgressions","linguistics","food"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Emotions","Philosophy of love","Personal life"],"headings":["Different forms","Romantic jealousy","Sexual jealousy","Gender-based differences","Etymology","Theories","Applications","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/25/Jealousy_and_Flirtation.jpg/220px-Jealousy_and_Flirtation.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/Miyagawa_Issh%C3%B4-Spring_Pastimes-H.jpg/275px-Miyagawa_Issh%C3%B4-Spring_Pastimes-H.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Wikiquote-logo-en.svg/40px-Wikiquote-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/12px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ce/Plutchik-wheel.svg/90px-Plutchik-wheel.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["root","linguistics"],["fermentation","food"],["jealousy","relational_transgressions"]],"members":["jealousy","root","fermentation"],"related":["Emotion","Thought","Feeling","Anger","Resentment","Disgust","Synonym","Interpersonal_relationship","Solipsism","Brighton","Adult","Peter_Salovey","Psychologist","Sociologist","Biologist","Theologian","Colleagues","Sexual_jealousy_in_humans","Parental_investment","Vulgar_Latin","Greek_language","Root_(linguistics)","Boil","Fermentation_(food)","William_Shakespeare","Social_psychology","Self-esteem","Sexual_jealousy","Human_sexual_behavior","Journal_of_Personality_and_Social_Psychology","Envy","Germanic_languages","Classical_Latin","Cornell_University","Journal_of_Personality_and_Social_Psychology","Personality_and_Social_Psychology_Bulletin","John_Rawls","A_Theory_of_Justice","Harvard_University_Press","Peter_Salovey","Self_control","Evolutionary_psychology","Sexual_arousal","Paraphilia","Sexual_function","Cultural_learning","Competition","Jealousy_in_art","Envy","Title_role","Folk_story","Envious","Compersion","Empathy","Crime_of_passion","Delusional_jealousy","Emotion","Envy","Jealousy_in_art","Jealousy_in_religion","Jealousy_(relational_transgressions)","Jealousy_sociology","Relational_transgressions","Relationship_obsessive–compulsive_disorder","Oxford_University_Press","Chögyam_Trungpa"]}
