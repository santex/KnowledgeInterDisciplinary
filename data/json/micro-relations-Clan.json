{"cursor":"6143","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nA 'clan' is a group of people united by actual or perceived kinship and descent.\nEven if lineage details are unknown, clan members may be organized around a\nfounding member or apical ancestor. The kinship-based bonds may be symbolical,\nwhereby the clan shares a \"stipulated\" common ancestor that is a symbol of the\nclan's unity. When this ancestor is not human, it is referred to as an animalian\ntotem. Clans can be most easily described as tribes or sub-groups of tribes. The\nword clan is derived from 'clann' meaning 'family' in the Irish and Scottish\nGaelic languages. The word was taken into English about 1425 as a label for the\ntribal nature of Irish and Scottish Gaelic\nsociety. [http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=clan \"Clan\"], Online\nEtymology Dictionary The Gaelic term for 'clan' is fine . Clans preceded\nmore centralized forms of community organization and government; they are\nlocated in every country. Members may identify with a coat of arms or other\nsymbol to show they are an independent clan.\n\nIn different cultures and situations, a clan may mean the same thing as other\nkin-based groups, such as tribes, castes, and bands. Often, the distinguishing\nfactor is that a clan is a smaller part of a larger society such as a tribe, a\nchiefdom, or a state. Examples include Irish, Scottish, Chinese, Japanese clans,\nRajput clans, Nair Clan or Malayala Kshatriya Clan in India and Pakistan, which\nexist as kin groups within their respective nations. Note, however, that tribes\nand bands can also be components of larger societies. However, the early Norse\nclans, the Ã¦tter, cannot be translated with tribe or band, and consequently they\nare often translated as house or line. The Biblical tribes of Israel were\ncomposed of many clans, 1 Chronicles 4 Numbers, chapter 26\nArab clans are small groups within Arab society. Ojibwa bands are smaller parts\nof the Ojibwa tribe or people in North America, as one example of the many\nNative American peoples distinguished by language and culture, most having clans\nand bands as the basic kinship organizations. In some cases more than one tribe\nrecognized each other's clans; for instance, both the Chickasaw and Choctaw\ntribes had fox and bear clans whose membership could supersede the tribe.\n\nApart from these different historical traditions of kinship, conceptual\nconfusion arises from colloquial usages of the term. In post-Soviet countries,\nfor example, it is quite common to speak of \"clans\" in reference to informal\nnetworks within the economic and political sphere. This usage reflects the\nassumption that their members act towards each other in a particularly close and\nmutually supportive way approximating the solidarity among kinsmen.\n\nPolish clans differ from most others as they are a collection of families who\nbear the same coat of arms, as opposed to claiming a common descent. This is\ndiscussed under the topic of Polish Heraldry.\n\nClans in indigenous societies are likely to be exogamous, meaning that their\nmembers cannot marry one another. In some societies, clans may have an\nofficial leader such as a chieftain or patriarch; in others, leadership\npositions may have to be achieved, or people may say that 'elders' make\ndecisions. There are multiple closely related clans in the Indian sub-\ncontinent, especially south India.\n","linknr":326,"url":"Clan","recorded":1362477188,"links":48,"instances":["social","caste","community","surname","surname","african_great_lakes"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Kinship and descent|Clan","Scottish Gaelic loanwords"],"headings":["Clans by region","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["clan","african_great_lakes"],["hou","surname"],["peng","surname"],["bunt","community"],["nai","caste"],["sept","social"],["clan","african_great_lakes"],["clan","african_great_lakes"],["clan","african_great_lakes"]],"members":["sept","nai","bunt","hou","peng","clan"],"related":["People","Kinship_and_descent","Apical_ancestor","Animal","Totem","Tribe","Irish_language","Scottish_Gaelic","Gaelic_language","English_language","Tribe","Caste","Band_society","Society","Chiefdom","Sovereign_state","Irish_clans","Scottish_clan","Chinese_clan","Japanese_clans","Rajput_clans","Nair","Malayala_Kshatriya","India","Pakistan","Norse_clans","Tribes_of_Arabia","Ojibwa","North_America","Chickasaw","Choctaw","Soviet_Union","Poland","Families","Coat_of_arms","Polish_Heraldry","Exogamy","Tribal_chief","Patriarch","Tribes_of_Arabia","Armenian_nobility","Azerbaijan","Nakhchivan","Yeraz","Baloch_tribes","Clan_(African_Great_Lakes)","Teip","Tibetan_Empire","Clans_in_Central_Asia","Chinese_clan","Chinese_family_name","Consort_clan","Han_Chinese","Tang_Clan","Hou_(surname)","Peng_(surname)","Wen_Tianxiang","Liao","Sippe","Indian_subcontinent","Kshatriya","Clans","List_of_Bhuiyar_clans","Bunt_(community)","Gakhars","Arain","List_of_Gujjar_clans","Jat_clan_system","Khatri","Maratha_clan_system","Meenas","Mukkulathor","Vellalar","Rajput_clans","Tarakhāna","Yadav_caste","Nai_(caste)","Nair","Malayala_Kshatriya","Seven_Parthian_clans","Irish_clans","Sept_(social)","Chiefs_of_the_Name","Edward_Mac_Lysaght","Israelites","Japanese_clans","Bon-gwan","Korean_name","List_of_Manchu_clans","Manchu_family_name","List_of_medieval_Mongolian_tribes_and_clans","Norse_clans","Pashtun_tribes","Polish_clans","Clan_(African_Great_Lakes)","Scottish_clan","Armigerous_clan","Scottish_clan_chief","Senegambia","Gambian","Senegal","Joof_family","Joos_Maternal_Dynasty","Serer_maternal_clans","Serb_clans","Clan_(African_Great_Lakes)","Clan_(African_Great_Lakes)"]}
