French engineers Edmond\nFouchÃ© and Charles Picard became the first to develop oxygen-acetylene welding\nin 1903. Carlisle, Rodney (2004). Scientific American Inventions and\nDiscoveries, p.365. John Wright & Songs, Inc., New Jersey. ISBN 0-471-24410-\n4. Pure oxygen, instead of air (20% oxygen/80% nitrogen), is used to\nincrease the flame temperature to allow localized melting of the workpiece\nmaterial (e.g. steel) in a room environment. A common propane/air flame burns at\nabout , a propane/oxygen flame burns at about , and an acetylene/oxygen flame\nburns at about .\n\nOxy-fuel is one of the oldest welding processes. Still used in industry, in\nrecent decades it has been less widely utilized in industrial applications as\nother specifically devised technologies have been adopted. It is still widely\nused for welding pipes and tubes, as well as repair work. It is also frequently\nwell-suited, and favored, for fabricating some types of metal-based artwork.\n\nIn 'oxy-fuel welding', a welding torch is used to weld metals. Welding metal\nresults when two pieces are heated to a temperature that produces a shared pool\nof molten metal. The molten pool is generally supplied with additional metal\ncalled filler. Filler material depends upon the metals to be welded.\n\nIn 'oxy-fuel cutting', a torch is used to heat metal to its kindling\ntemperature. A stream of oxygen is then trained on the metal, burning it into a\nmetal oxide that flows out of the as slag. The Oxy-Acetylene Handbook, Union Carbide Corp 1975 Sometimes\ncalled a \"Gas Axe\".\n\nTorches that do not mix fuel with oxygen (combining, instead, atmospheric air)\nare not considered oxy-fuel torches and can typically be identified by a single\ntank (Oxy-fuel cutting requires two isolated supplies, fuel and oxygen). Most\nmetals cannot be melted with a single-tank torch. As such, single-tank torches\nare typically used only for soldering and brazing, rather than welding.\n","linknr":720,"url":"Oxy-fuel_welding_and_cutting","recorded":1362477497,"links":51,"instances":["unit","unit"],"pdf":["http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/indg297.pdf","http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/indg297.pdf","http://www.em.doe.gov/EM20Pages/pdfs/pubs/itsrs/itsr1847.pdf"],"categories":["Hydrogen technologies","Metalworking cutting tools","Oxygen","Welding"],"headings":["Uses","Apparatus","Fuels","The role of oxygen","Types of flame","Safety","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/Cutted_metal.jpg/200px-Cutted_metal.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a6/Cutting_torch.jpg/200px-Cutting_torch.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e3/Types_of_gas_torch_head.jpg/220px-Types_of_gas_torch_head.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/83/Laskarbit.jpg/200px-Laskarbit.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3b/Compressed_gas_cylinders.mapp_and_oxygen.triddle.jpg/220px-Compressed_gas_cylinders.mapp_and_oxygen.triddle.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d5/OxygenRichBlowTorchFlame.jpg/220px-OxygenRichBlowTorchFlame.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b3/FuelRichBlowTorchFlame.jpg/220px-FuelRichBlowTorchFlame.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/Railway-cutting-2-a.jpg/220px-Railway-cutting-2-a.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/Oxygas_welding_station.jpg/220px-Oxygas_welding_station.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/Blowtorching_goggles_and_helmet.jpg/220px-Blowtorching_goggles_and_helmet.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["pascal","unit"],["atmosphere","unit"]],"members":["atmosphere","pascal"],"related":["Welding","Acetylene","Air","Adiabatic_flame","Kindling_temperature","Burning","Slag","Soldering","Brazing","Quicklime","Limelight","Platinum","Gas_cylinder","Pressure","Solder","Cart","Oxyhydrogen","Diving_tank","Backpack","Rescue","Needle_valve","Health_and_Safety_Executive","Liquefied_petroleum_gas","Propane","Hose_clip","Jubilee_clip","Explosive","Mine_Safety_and_Health_Administration","Flashback_arrestor","Shock_wave","Rose-bud","Venturi_effect","Acetylene","Propylene","Liquified_petroleum_gas","Natural_gas","Hydrogen","MAPP_gas","Kapok","Diatomaceous_earth","Asbestos","Acetone","Pascal_(unit)","Pound-force_per_square_inch","Instability","Explosion","KPa","Oxygen","Celsius","Fahrenheit","Gasoline","Aluminium","Hydrogen_embrittlement","Electrolysis","Jewelry","Electronics","Butane","Distillation","Dewar_flask","Thermos","Zeolite","Nitrogen","Argon","Carbon_monoxide","Hardfacing","Ignition_temperature","Iron_oxide","Petrol","Cut-off_grinder","Repetitive_strain_injury","Shipbuilding","Liquefied_petroleum_gas","Joule","Carbon_steel","Wrought_iron","Cast_iron","Welding_goggles","Didymium","Atmosphere_(unit)","Mythbusters","Valve","Tank","Carbon_dioxide","Copper","Beryllium","Poison","Arsenic","Manganese","Silver","Zinc","Cadmium","Fluoride","Iron","Steel","Oxidizing","Galvanized","Zinc_oxide","Metal_fume_fever","Influenza","Flashback_arrestor","Air-arc_cutting","Flame_cleaning","Oxyhydrogen_flame","Plasma_arc_cutting","Thermal_lance","Underwater_welding","ANSI_Z87","Goodheart_-_Willcox"]}
