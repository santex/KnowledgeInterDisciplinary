There he attended\nthe lectures of Antoine FranÃ§ois Fourcroy and Louis Nicolas Vauquelin. He was\nallowed into Vauquelin's laboratory even though he was unable to pay the monthly\nfee of 20 francs, due to the requests of Vauquelin's sisters.. and\nsucceeded in gaining admission, in a humble capacity, to the latter's\nlaboratory. But his progress was so rapid that in two or three years he was able\nto take his master's place at the lecture-table, and Fourcroy and Vauquelin were\nso satisfied with his performance that they procured for him a school\nappointment in 1797 as teacher of chemistry, and in 1798 one as rÃ©pÃ©titeur at\nthe Ãcole Polytechnique.\n\nIn 1804 Vauquelin resigned his professorship at the CollÃ¨ge de France and\nsuccessfully used his influence to obtain the appointment for ThÃ©nard, who six\nyears later, after Fourcroy's death, was further elected to the chairs of\nchemistry at the Ãcole Polytechnique and the FacultÃ© des Sciences. He also\nsucceeded Fourcroy as member of the Academy. In 1821, he was elected a foreign\nmember of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. In 1825 he received the title\nof baron from Charles X, and in 1832 Louis Philippe made him a peer of France.\nFrom 1827 to 1830 he represented the [[dÃ©partement in France|dÃ©partement]] of\nYonne in the chamber of deputies, and as vice-president of the conseil superieur\nde l'instruction publique, he exercised a great influence on scientific\neducation in France. He died in Paris on 21 June 1857. A statue was erected to\nhis memory at Sens in 1861, and in 1865 the name of his native village was\nchanged to La LouptiÃ¨re-ThÃ©nard.\n\nAbove all things ThÃ©nard was a teacher; as he himself said, the professor, the\nassistants, the laboratory — everything must be sacrificed to the\nstudents. Like most great teachers he published a textbook, and his TraitÃ© de\nchimie Ã©lÃ©mentaire, thÃ©orique et pratique (4 vols., Paris, 1813-16), which\nserved as a standard for a quarter of a century, perhaps did even more for the\nadvance of chemistry than his numerous original discoveries.\n\nSoon after his appointment as rÃ©pÃ©titeur at the Ãcole Polytechnique he began a\nlifelong friendship with Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac, and the two carried out many\nresearch projects together. Careful analysis led him to dispute some of Claude\nLouis Berthollet's theoretical views regarding the composition of the metallic\noxides, and he also showed Berthollet's \"zoonic acid\" to be impure acetic acid\n(1802). In response, Berthollet invited him to become a member of the Society\nof Arcueil.\n\nHis first original paper (1799) was on the compounds of arsenic and antimony\nwith oxygen and sulphur. In 1807, he began important research into ethers. His\nresearches on sebacic acid (1802) and on bile (1807) deserve mention as well, as\ndoes his discovery of hydrogen peroxide (1818). L. J. ThÃ©nard (1818) [http://books.google.com/books?id=-\nN43AAAAMAAJ&pg=PA306#v=onepage&q&f=false âObservations sur des nouvelles\ncombinaisons entre lâoxigÃ¨ne et divers acides,â] Annales de chimie et de\nphysique, 2nd series, vol. 8, pages 306-312; see especially page 308. In\n1799 he developed the pigment known as ThÃ©nard's blue in response to a request\nby Jean-Antoine-Claude Chaptal for a cheap colouring matter.\n\nHis name is one of the 72 names inscribed on the Eiffel Tower.\n","linknr":154,"url":"Louis_Jacques_Thénard","recorded":1371243225,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Louis_Jacques_Th%C3%A9nard&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Louis_Jacques_Th%C3%A9nard&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Louis_Jacques_Th%C3%A9nard.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/14/Louis_Jacques_Th%C3%A9nard.jpg/200px-Louis_Jacques_Th%C3%A9nard.jpg","/wiki/La_Loupti%C3%A8re","/wiki/Champagne_(historical_province)","/wiki/Aube","/wiki/Paris","/wiki/Chemistry","/wiki/Doctoral_advisor","/wiki/Louis_Nicolas_Vauquelin","/wiki/Chemist","/wiki/Sens","/wiki/Pharmacy","/wiki/Paris","/wiki/Antoine_Fran%C3%A7ois_Fourcroy","/wiki/Louis_Nicolas_Vauquelin","#cite_note-1","/wiki/%C3%89cole_Polytechnique","/wiki/Coll%C3%A8ge_de_France","/wiki/Royal_Swedish_Academy_of_Sciences","/wiki/Charles_X_of_France","/wiki/Louis-Philippe_of_France","/wiki/D%C3%A9partement_in_France","/wiki/Yonne","/wiki/La_Loupti%C3%A8re-Th%C3%A9nard","/wiki/Joseph_Louis_Gay-Lussac","/wiki/Claude_Louis_Berthollet","/wiki/Oxide","/wiki/Acetic_acid","/wiki/Society_of_Arcueil","/wiki/Arsenic","/wiki/Antimony","/wiki/Oxygen","/wiki/Sulfur","/wiki/Ether","/wiki/Sebacic_acid","/wiki/Bile","/wiki/Hydrogen_peroxide","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Jean-Antoine-Claude_Chaptal","/wiki/List_of_the_72_names_on_the_Eiffel_Tower","/w/index.php?title=Louis_Jacques_Th%C3%A9nard&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/12px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png","//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Catholic_Encyclopedia_(1913)/Baron_Louis-Jacques_Th%C3%A9nard","/wiki/Catholic_Encyclopedia","#cite_ref-2","http://books.google.com/books?id=-N43AAAAMAAJ&pg=PA306#v=onepage&q&f=false","/wiki/File:PD-icon.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/62/PD-icon.svg/12px-PD-icon.svg.png","/wiki/Public_domain","/wiki/Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica_Eleventh_Edition","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/56695277","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","/wiki/La_Loupti%C3%A8re","/wiki/Aube","/wiki/Paris","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Louis_Jacques_Thénard&oldid=558609024","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1777_births","/wiki/Category:1857_deaths","/wiki/Category:French_chemists","/wiki/Category:Members_of_the_French_Academy_of_Sciences","/wiki/Category:Members_of_the_Royal_Swedish_Academy_of_Sciences","/wiki/Category:Foreign_Members_of_the_Royal_Society","/wiki/Category:18th-century_French_people","/wiki/Category:18th-century_chemists","/wiki/Category:19th-century_French_people","/wiki/Category:19th-century_chemists","/wiki/Category:Articles_incorporating_a_citation_from_the_1913_Catholic_Encyclopedia_with_Wikisource_reference","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_incorporating_a_citation_from_the_1911_Encyclopaedia_Britannica_with_no_article_parameter","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_incorporating_text_from_the_1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Louis+Jacques+Th%C3%A9nard&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Louis+Jacques+Th%C3%A9nard","/wiki/Louis_Jacques_Th%C3%A9nard","/wiki/Talk:Louis_Jacques_Th%C3%A9nard","#","/wiki/Louis_Jacques_Th%C3%A9nard","/w/index.php?title=Louis_Jacques_Th%C3%A9nard&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Louis_Jacques_Th%C3%A9nard&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf5/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Louis_Jacques_Th%C3%A9nard","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Louis_Jacques_Th%C3%A9nard","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Louis_Jacques_Th%C3%A9nard&oldid=558609024","/w/index.php?
