{"cursor":"54263","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Babylonia' was an ancient Akkadian speaking Semitic nation state and cultural\nregion based in central-southern Mesopotamia (present-day Iraq). It emerged as\nan independent state circa 1894 BC, the city of Babylon being its capital. It\nwas often involved in rivalry with its fellow Akkadian state of Assyria in\nnorthern Mesopotamia. Babylonia became the major power in the region after\nHammurabi (fl. ca. 1792- 1752 BC middle chronology, or ca. 1696 â 1654 BC,\nshort chronology) created an empire out of many of the territories of the former\nAkkadian Empire.\n\nThe Babylonian state retained the written Semitic Akkadian language for official\nuse (the language of its native populace), despite its Amorite founders and\nKassite successors not being native Akkadians. It retained the Sumerian language\nfor religious use, but by the time Babylon was founded this was no longer a\nspoken language, having been wholly subsumed by Akkadian. The earlier Akkadian\nand Sumerian traditions played a major role in Babylonian (and Assyrian)\nculture, and the region would remain an important cultural center, even under\nprotracted periods of outside rule.\n\nThe earliest mention of the city of Babylon can be found in a tablet from the\nreign of Sargon of Akkad (2334- 2279 BC), dating back to the 23rd century BC.\nBabylon was merely a religious and cultural centre at this point and not an\nindependent state; like the rest of Mesopotamia, it was subject to the Akkadian\nEmpire which united all the Akkadian and Sumerian speakers under one rule. After\nthe collapse of the Akkadian empire, the south Mesopotamian region was dominated\nby the Gutians for a few decades before the rise of the Sumerian third dynasty\nof Ur, which encompassed the whole of Mesopotamia, including Babylon.\n\nFollowing the collapse of this \"Ur-III\" dynasty at the hands of the Elamites\n(2002 BC traditional, 1940 BC short), the Amorites, another Semitic people,\ngradually gained control over most of southern Mesopotamia, where they formed a\nseries of small kingdoms, while the Assyrians reasserted their independence in\nthe north. During the first centuries of what is called the \"Amorite period\",\nthe most powerful city states in the south were Isin and Larsa, although Shamshi-\nAdad I usurped the throne of Assyria and formed a short lived empire in the\nnorth. Another of these Amorite dynasties founded the city-state of Babylon,\nwhich would ultimately take over the others and form the short-lived first\nBabylonian empire, also called the Old Babylonian Period.\n","linknr":1012,"url":"Babylonian","recorded":1362534945,"links":91,"instances":["pharmaceutical","babylonian_calendar","geology","persia","mythology","pharmacy","timekeeping","new_testament"],"pdf":["http://oi.uchicago.edu/pdf/OIS2.pdf","http://fax.libs.uga.edu/BM530xK531l/1f/legends_of_babylon_and_egypt.pdf","http://fax.libs.uga.edu/BL1620xB7/1f/babylonian_legends_of_creation.pdf","http://fax.libs.uga.edu/DS71xJ39C/1f/civilization_of_babylonia_and_assyria.pdf"],"categories":["Babylonia|","Mesopotamia","Fertile
