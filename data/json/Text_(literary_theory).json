{"cursor":"3287","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In literary theory, a 'text' is any object that can be \"read,\" whether this\nobject is a work of literature, a street sign, an arrangement of buildings on a\ncity block, or styles of clothing. It is a coherent set of symbols that\ntransmits some kind of informative message. Yuri Lotman - The Structure of\nthe Artistic Text This set of symbols is considered in terms of the\ninformative message's content, rather than in terms of its physical form or the\nmedium in which it is represented.\n\nWithin the field of literary criticism, \"text\" also refers to the original\ninformation content of a particular piece of writing; that is, the \"text\" of a\nwork is that primal symbolic arrangement of letters as originally composed,\napart from later alterations, deterioration, commentary, translations,\nparatext, etc. Therefore, when literary criticism is concerned with the\ndetermination of a \"text,\" it is concerned with the distinguishing of the\noriginal information content from whatever has been added to or subtracted from\nthat content as it appears in a given textual document (that is, a physical\nrepresentation of text).\n\nSince the history of writing predates the concept of the \"text\", most texts were\nnot written with this concept in mind. Most written works fall within a narrow\nrange of the types described by text theory. The concept of \"text\" becomes\nrelevant if/when a \"coherent written message is completed and needs to be\nreferred to independently of the circumstances in which it was created.\"\n","linknr":143,"url":"Text_(literary_theory)","recorded":1362897696,"links":45,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Literary theory"],"headings":["Origin of the term","See also","References","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1d/P_literature.svg/30px-P_literature.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Literary_theory","Symbol","Message","Yuri_Lotman","Paratext","Quintilian","Text_linguistics","Bakhtin","Terry_Eagleton"]}
