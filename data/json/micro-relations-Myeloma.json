In multiple myeloma, collections of abnormal\nplasma cells accumulate in the bone marrow, where they interfere with the\nproduction of normal blood cells. Most cases of myeloma also feature the\nproduction of a paraproteinâan abnormal antibody which can cause kidney\nproblems. Bone lesions and hypercalcemia (high calcium levels) are also often\nencountered.\n\nMyeloma is diagnosed with blood tests (serum protein electrophoresis, serum free\nkappa/lambda light chain assay), bone marrow examination, urine protein\nelectrophoresis, and X-rays of commonly involved bones. Myeloma is generally\nthought to be treatable but incurable. Remissions may be induced with steroids,\nchemotherapy, proteasome inhibitors (e.g. bortezomib), immunomodulatory drugs\n(IMiDs) such as thalidomide or lenalidomide, and stem cell transplants.\nRadiation therapy is sometimes used to reduce pain from bone lesions.\n\nMyeloma develops in 1â4 per 100,000 people per year. It is more common in men,\nand for unknown reasons is twice as common in African-Americans as it is in European-\nAmericans. With conventional treatment, median survival is 3â4 years, which may\nbe extended to 5â7 years or longer with advanced treatments. Multiple myeloma is\nthe second most common hematological malignancy in the U.S. (after non-Hodgkin\nlymphoma), and constitutes 1% of all cancers.\n","linknr":946,"url":"Myeloma","recorded":1362576102,"links":48,"instances":["human","epidemiology","medical"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Hematologic neoplasms"],"headings":["Signs and
