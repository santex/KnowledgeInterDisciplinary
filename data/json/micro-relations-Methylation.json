{"cursor":"16465","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In the chemical sciences, 'methylation' denotes the addition of a methyl group\nto a substrate or the substitution of an atom or group by a methyl group.\nMethylation is a form of alkylation with, to be specific, a methyl group, rather\nthan a larger carbon chain, replacing a hydrogen atom. These terms are commonly\nused in chemistry, biochemistry, soil science, and the biological sciences.\n\nIn biological systems, methylation is catalyzed by enzymes; such methylation can\nbe involved in modification of heavy metals, regulation of gene expression,\nregulation of protein function, and RNA metabolism. Methylation of heavy metals\ncan also occur outside of biological systems. Chemical methylation of tissue\nsamples is also one method for reducing certain histological staining artifacts.\n","linknr":463,"url":"Methylation","recorded":1362481179,"links":40,"instances":["chemistry","biology","biology","biology"],"pdf":["http://www.roberts-publishers.com/walsh/chapter5.pdf","http://www.roberts-publishers.com/walsh/chapter5.pdf"],"categories":["Epigenetics","Organic reactions","Posttranslational modification","Methylating agents"],"headings":["In biology","In chemistry","5-O-Methylations","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/db/Iodomethane_rxn1.png/350px-Iodomethane_rxn1.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6d/MeLi_on_acetone.png/250px-MeLi_on_acetone.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/29/Purdie_methylation.png/500px-Purdie_methylation.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["substrate","chemistry"],["promoter","biology"],["cell","biology"],["polymorphism","biology"]],"members":["substrate","polymorphism","promoter","cell"],"related":["Methyl","Substrate_(chemistry)","Alkylation","Biochemistry","Catalysis","Enzyme","Heavy_metals","Gene_expression","RNA_metabolism","Heavy_metals","Biological_systems","Epigenetic_inheritance","CpG_site","Cytosine","Guanine","5-methylcytosine","Catalysis","DNA_methyltransferase","Arginine","Lysine","Amino_acid","Peptidylarginine_methyltransferases","Lysine_methyltransferases","Histone","Methyl","S-adenosyl_methionine","Histone_methyltransferase","Epigenetics","Post-translational_modification","Demethylation","Somatic_cell","Oocyte","Zygote","Imprinted_gene","Blastula","Reprogramming","Gene_knockout","Morula","Rat","Promoter_(biology)","Gene_expression","Interleukin","Coding_region","Neoplasia","Genome","Gene_expression","DNA_methyltransferase","GSTP1","Diagnostic_indicator","Prostate_cancer","Adenosine","Cytosine","Restriction_modification_system","Bacteria","DNA","Methylase","Cell_(biology)","Restriction_enzyme","Bacteriophage","Restriction_fragment_length_polymorphism","Polymorphism_(biology)","Organic_chemistry","Alkylation","Electrophile","Iodomethane","Dimethyl_sulfate","Dimethyl_carbonate","Methyl_triflate","Magic_methyl","Nucleophilic_substitution","Carboxylate","Ester","Alkoxide","Ether","Enolate","Ketone","Phenol","Iodomethane","Nucleophile","Methyllithium","Grignard_reagent","Acetone","Carbonyl","C=O","Alkoxide","Tert-Butanol","Methyl_lithium","Carbohydrate","Iodomethane","Silver_oxide","5-O-Methylgenistein","5-O-Methylmyricetin","5-O-Methylquercetin","Alkylation","Bisulfite_sequencing","MethDB","Microscale_thermophoresis"]}
