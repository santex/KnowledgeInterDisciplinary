During Judaism's New\nYear, Rosh Hashanah, through the High Holidays and culminating in Yom Kippur\n(the Day of Atonement), one is to reflect upon one's wrongdoings over the year\nand both seek and offer forgiveness. People may act similarly during the\nCatholic fasting period of Lent, though the motive behind this holiday is more\nof sacrifice than of responsibility, in fact the practice of New Year's\nresolutions partially came from the Lenten sacrifices.\nThe concept, regardless of creed, is to reflect upon self-improvement annually.\n","linknr":201,"url":"New_Year's_resolution","recorded":1362901652,"links":17,"instances":["biological","role"],"pdf":[],"categories":["New Year celebrations","Winter traditions","Motivation"],"headings":["Participation","Popular goals","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3c/Postcards2CardsNewYearsResolution1915.jpg/350px-Postcards2CardsNewYearsResolution1915.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["job","role"],["stress","biological"]],"members":["stress","job"],"related":["Medieval_era","Knight","Les_Voeux_du_paon","Chivalry","Rosh_Hashanah","High_Holidays","Yom_Kippur","Catholic","Lent","Self-improvement","Poverty","Assertive","Environmental_movement","Body_weight","Exercise","Nutrition","Alcoholic_beverage","Smoking_cessation","Nail_biting","Personal_finance","Debt","Job_(role)","Education","Foreign_language","Music","Stress_(biological)","Anger_management","Time_management","Volunteer","Richard_Wiseman","University_of_Bristol","Goal_setting"]}
