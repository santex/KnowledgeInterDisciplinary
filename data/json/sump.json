A sump can also be an\ninfiltration basin used to manage surface runoff water and recharge underground\naquifers.<ref></ref> Sump can also refer to an area in a cave where an\nunderground flow of water exits the cave into the earth.\n\nOne common example of a sump is the lowest point in a basement, into which flows\nwater that seeps in from outside. If this is a regular problem, a sump pump that\nmoves the water outside of the house may be used.\n",
