{"cursor":"47840","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nThe 'Proto-Indo-European language' ('PIE') is the reconstructed common ancestor\nof the Indo-European languages, spoken by the Proto-Indo-Europeans. PIE was the\nfirst proposed proto-language to be widely accepted by linguists. Far more work\nhas gone into reconstructing it than any other proto-language, and it is by far\nthe most well-understood of all proto-languages at its time depth. During the\n19th century, the vast majority of linguistic work was devoted to reconstruction\nof Proto-Indo-European or of daughter proto-languages such as Proto-Germanic,\nand most of the current techniques of historical linguistics (e.g. the\ncomparative method and the method of internal reconstruction) were developed as\na specific result.\n\nScholars estimate that PIE may have been spoken as a single language (before\ndivergence began) around 3700 BC, though estimates by different authorities can\nvary by more than a millennium. The most popular hypothesis for the origin and\nspread of the language is the Kurgan hypothesis, which postulates an origin in\nthe Pontic-Caspian steppe of Eastern Europe.\n\nThe existence of PIE was first postulated in the 18th century by Sir William\nJones, who observed the similarities between Sanskrit, Ancient Greek, and Latin.\nBy the early 20th century, well-defined descriptions of PIE had been developed\nthat are still accepted today (with some refinements). The largest developments\nof the 20th century have been the discovery of Anatolian and Tocharian languages\nand the acceptance of the laryngeal theory. The Anatolian languages have also\nspurred a major re-evaluation of theories concerning the development of various\nshared Indo-European language features and the extent to which these features\nwere present in PIE itself.\n\nPIE is thought to have had a complex system of morphology that included\ninflections (suffixing of roots, as in who, whom, whose), and ablaut (vowel\nalterations, as in sing, sang, sung). Nouns used a sophisticated system of\ndeclension and verbs used a similarly sophisticated system of conjugation.\n\nRelationships to other language families, including the Uralic languages, have\nbeen proposed but remain controversial.\n\nThere is no written evidence of Proto-Indo-European, so all knowledge of the\nlanguage is derived by reconstruction from later languages using linguistic\ntechniques such as the comparative method and the method of internal\nreconstruction.\n","linknr":854,"url":"PIE","recorded":1362564867,"links":82,"instances":["linguistics","linguistics","phonetics","linguistics_","philologist","linguistics","phonetics","linguistics"],"pdf":["http://www.kortlandt.nl/publications/art111e.pdf","http://www.kortlandt.nl/publications/art111e.pdf","http://language.psy.auckland.ac.nz/files/gray_and_atkinson2003/grayatkinson2003.pdf","http://language.psy.auckland.ac.nz/files/gray_and_atkinson2003/grayatkinson2003.pdf","http://www.kortlandt.nl/publications/art130e.pdf","http://www.kortlandt.nl/publications/art130e.pdf","http://www.kortlandt.nl/publications/art111e.pdf","http://www.kortlandt.nl/publications/art111e.pdf","http://www2.let.uu.nl/Solis/homelet/publicaties/lezingenreeks/pdf/Schrijver_Peter_oratie.pdf","http://www2.let.uu.nl/Solis/homelet/publicaties/lezingenreeks/pdf/Schrijver_Peter_oratie.pdf","http://www.phil.muni.cz/linguistica/art/blazek/bla-003.pdf","http://www.phil.muni.cz/linguistica/art/blazek/bla-003.pdf","http://www.kortlandt.nl/publications/art203e.pdf","http://www.kortlandt.nl/publications/art203e.pdf"],"categories":["Bronze
