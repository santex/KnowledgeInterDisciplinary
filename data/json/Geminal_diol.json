{"cursor":"2089","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'geminal diol' (or 'gem-diol' for short) is any organic compound having two\nhydroxyl functional groups (-OH) bound to the same carbon atom.\n\nThe simplest geminal diol is methanediol CH 4O 2 or\nH 2C(OH) 2. Other examples are dihydroxymalonic acid HOOC-C(OH) 2-\nCOOH and decahydroxycyclopentane (C(OH) 2) 5.\n\nGeminal diols are a subclass of the diols, which in turn are a special class\nof alcohols.\n\nThe two hydroxyls in a geminal diol are easily converted to a carbonyl or keto\ngroup C=O by loss of one water molecule, thus turning the diol into a ketone.\nConversely, ketones tend to combine with water to form the corresponding geminal\ndiols. The equilibrium in water solution may be shifted towards either compound;\nfor example, the equilibrium constant for the conversion of acetone\n(H 3C) 2C=O to propane-2,2-diol\n(H 3C) 2C(OH) 2 is about\n10 âˆ’3 , Peter Taylor (2002),\n[http://books.google.com/books?id=A3PKKplklUUC&pg=PA31 Mechanism and synthesis],\nBook 10 of Molecular world.
