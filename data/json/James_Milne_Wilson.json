Educated at Banff and\nEdinburgh, he emigrated to Tasmania in 1829, studied practical engineering and\nafterwards became a ship's officer. He was connected with the Cascade Brewery\nfor 14 years and became its manager. He entered politics in October 1859 as\nmember for Hobart in the legislative council, and in January 1863 joined the\nWhyte cabinet as minister without portfolio. In 1868, at the time of the visit\nof the Duke of Edinburgh, Wilson was Mayor of Hobart and on 4 August 1869 became\nPremier and colonial secretary in a ministry which lasted until November 1872.\n\nAnthony Trollope, who came to Australia in 1871, formed a high opinion of\nWilson: \"I thought I had not met a sounder politician in Australia... Victoria\nis desirous of annexing Tasmania. Perhaps when she has done so, Mr Wilson will\nbecome premier for the joint colonies, and then great things may be expected.\"\nIn 1872, Wilson was elected President of the Tasmanian Legislative Council,\nand held this position until his death on 29 February 1880, on his \"17th\"\nbirthday aged 68.\n\nIn 1847, he married Deborah Hope, daughter of Peter Degraves. Lady Wilson\nsurvived him with children. He was knighted in 1873 and created K.C.M.G. in\n1878. He was a man of unbounded popularity, well known for his charities. He was\npresident of the Southern Tasmanian Agricultural Society and chairman of\ncommittees and president of the Tasmanian Jockey Club. As a politician Wilson\nshowed wisdom in his advocacy of free-trade between the Australian colonies.\nTasmania passed an intercolonial freetrade act in 1870 during his premiership,\nbut the question made no headway on the mainland.\n\nWilson achieved the extremely rare feat of being both born on 29 February\n(making him a leapling) and dying on the same date at the age of 68.\n","linknr":167,"url":"James_Milne_Wilson","recorded":1375077236,"links":["/w/index.php?title=James_Milne_Wilson&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=James_Milne_Wilson&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:James_Milne_Wilson.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/James_Milne_Wilson.jpg/220px-James_Milne_Wilson.jpg","/wiki/Premier_of_Tasmania","/wiki/Richard_Dry","/wiki/Frederick_Innes","/wiki/Banff,_Aberdeenshire","/wiki/Scotland","/wiki/United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland","/wiki/Hobart,_Tasmania","/wiki/Tasmania","/wiki/United_Kingdom","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/ae/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg/23px-Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png","/wiki/Great_Britain","/wiki/Presbyterianism","/wiki/Order_of_St_Michael_and_St_George","/wiki/Premier_of_Tasmania","/wiki/Banff,_Aberdeenshire","/wiki/Scotland","/wiki/Edinburgh","/wiki/Cascade_Brewery","/wiki/James_Whyte_(Australian_politician)","/wiki/Duke_of_Edinburgh","/wiki/List_of_mayors_and_lord_mayors_of_Hobart","/wiki/Anthony_Trollope","/wiki/President_of_the_Tasmanian_Legislative_Council","/wiki/Order_of_St_Michael_and_St_George","/wiki/Leapling","/w/index.php?title=James_Milne_Wilson&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Percival_Serle","http://gutenberg.net.au/dictbiog/0-dict-biogWe-Wy.html#wilson4","/wiki/Dictionary_of_Australian_Biography","http://www.parliament.tas.gov.au/history/tasparl/wilsonj.htm","/wiki/Richard_Dry","/wiki/Premier_of_Tasmania","/wiki/Frederick_Innes","/wiki/Template:Premiers_of_Tasmania","/wiki/Template_talk:Premiers_of_Tasmania","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Premiers_of_Tasmania&action=edit","/wiki/Premier_of_Tasmania","/wiki/William_Champ","/wiki/Thomas_Gregson","/wiki/William_Weston_(Australian_politician)","/wiki/Francis_Smith_(Australian_politician)","/wiki/Thomas_Chapman_(Australian_politician)","/wiki/James_Whyte_(Australian_politician)","/wiki/Richard_Dry","/wiki/Frederick_Innes","/wiki/Alfred_Kennerley","/wiki/Thomas_Reibey","/wiki/Philip_Fysh","/wiki/William_Giblin","/wiki/William_Crowther_(Australian_politician)","/wiki/Adye_Douglas","/wiki/James_Agnew","/wiki/Henry_Dobson","/wiki/Edward_Braddon","/wiki/Elliott_Lewis","/wiki/William_Propsting","/wiki/John_Evans_(Australian_politician)","/wiki/John_Earle_(Australian_politician)","/wiki/Albert_Solomon","/wiki/Walter_Lee_(Australian_politician)","/wiki/John_Hayes_(Australian_politician)","/wiki/Joseph_Lyons","/wiki/John_McPhee_(politician)","/wiki/Albert_Ogilvie","/wiki/Edmund_Dwyer-Gray","/wiki/Robert_Cosgrove","/wiki/Edward_Brooker","/wiki/Eric_Reece","/wiki/Angus_Bethune_(politician)","/wiki/Bill_Neilson","/wiki/Doug_Lowe_(Australian_politician)","/wiki/Harry_Holgate","/wiki/Robin_Gray_(Australian_politician)","/wiki/Michael_Field_(Australian_politician)","/wiki/Ray_Groom","/wiki/Tony_Rundle","/wiki/Jim_Bacon","/wiki/Paul_Lennon","/wiki/David_Bartlett","/wiki/Lara_Giddings","/wiki/File:Flag_of_Tasmania.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/Flag_of_Tasmania.svg/80px-Flag_of_Tasmania.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","/wiki/Banff,_Aberdeenshire","/wiki/Scotland","/wiki/United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland","/wiki/Hobart,_Tasmania","/wiki/Tasmania","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=James_Milne_Wilson&oldid=559550660","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1812_births","/wiki/Category:1880_deaths","/wiki/Category:Premiers_of_Tasmania","/wiki/Category:People_from_Banff_and_Buchan","/wiki/Category:Australian_people_of_Scottish_descent","/wiki/Category:Knights_Commander_of_the_Order_of_St_Michael_and_St_George","/wiki/Category:Presidents_of_the_Tasmanian_Legislative_Council","/wiki/Category:Mayors_and_Lord_Mayors_of_Hobart","/wiki/Category:Scottish_emigrants_to_Australia","/wiki/Category:Use_dmy_dates_from_August_2010","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=James+Milne+Wilson&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=James+Milne+Wilson","/wiki/James_Milne_Wilson","/wiki/Talk:James_Milne_Wilson","#","/wiki/James_Milne_Wilson","/w/index.php?title=James_Milne_Wilson&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=J
