{"cursor":"24920","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n offices in Washington, D.C.]] A 'charitable organization' is a type of non-\n profit organization (NPO). It differs from other types of NPOs in that it\n centers on non-profit and philanthropic goals as well as social well-being\n (e.g. charitable, educational, religious, or other activities serving the\n public interest or common good).\n\nThe legal definition of charitable organization (and of Charity) varies\naccording to the country and in some instances the region of the country in\nwhich the charitable organization operates. The regulation, tax treatment, and\nthe way in which charity law affects charitable organizations also varies.\n\nFinancial figures (e.g.,Â tax refund, revenue from fundraising, revenue from\nsale of goods and services or revenue from investment) are important indicators\nto assess the financial sustainability of a charity, especially to charity\nevaluators. This information can impact a charity's reputation with donors and\nsocieties, and thus the charity's financial gains.\n","linknr":349,"url":"Charitable_organization","recorded":1362585325,"links":40,"instances":["practice","hong_kong","ontario","charity"],"pdf":["http://www.aph.gov.au/library/pubs/bd/2003-04/04bd164.pdf","http://www.aph.gov.au/library/pubs/bd/2003-04/04bd164.pdf","http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p557.pdf","http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p557.pdf","http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p4220.pdf","http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p4220.pdf"],"categories":["Types of organization","Charitable organizations|*","Wills and trusts"],"headings":["Australia","Canada","United Kingdom","Ireland","United States","List of relevant organizations","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Ambox_globe_content.svg/48px-Ambox_globe_content.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c6/Universal_North_Building.JPG/220px-Universal_North_Building.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["charity","practice"],["501(c(3"],["foundation","nonprofit_organization"],["501(c(3"],["inland_revenue_department","hong_kong"],["public_trustee","ontario"],["foundation","charity"]],"members":["charity","inland_revenue_department","public_trustee","foundation"],"related":["Non-profit_organization","Charity_(practice)","Educational","Religious","Public_interest","Common_good","Charity_evaluators","The_Charitable_Uses_Act_1601","Extension_of_Charitable_Purpose_Act_2004","Sunnykids","Sunnykids","Charity_Commission_for_England_and_Wales","Office_of_the_Scottish_Charity_Regulator","Charity_Commission_for_Northern_Ireland","Charities_Act_2006","Poverty","Education","Religion","Human_rights","Poverty","Education","Religion","Unincorporated_association","Trust_law","Royal_Charter","Privy_Council","Charitable_Incorporated_Organisation","British_Heart_Foundation","Charity_Commission","Charity_Commission","HM_Revenue_and_Customs","HM_Revenue_and_Customs","Exempt_charity","Northern_Ireland","HM_Revenue_and_Customs","Charity_Commission_for_Northern_Ireland","Scotland","Office_of_the_Scottish_Charity_Regulator","Tax_avoidance","Ireland","United_States","Public_interest","Tax-exempt","501(c)(3)","Internal_Revenue_Code","Private_foundation","Internal_Revenue_Service","Private_foundation","Grantmaker","Foundation_(nonprofit_organization)","Grantmaking","Financial_endowment","Rockefeller_Foundation","Bill_&_Melinda_Gates_Foundation","Elizabeth_Glaser_Pediatric_AIDS_Foundation","American_Cancer_Society","World_Wildlife_Fund","IRS_Form_990","501(c)(3)","Australian_Taxation_Office","Canada_Revenue_Agency","Inland_Revenue_Department_(Hong_Kong)","Public_Trustee_(Ontario)","Charity_Commission_for_England_and_Wales","Office_of_the_Scottish_Charity_Regulator","Charity_Commission_for_Northern_Ireland","Internal_Revenue_Service","Charitable_trust","Cy_pres_doctrine","Foundation_(charity)","Small_Charity_Governance","Grants","Non-profit_organization","Philanthropy","Social_enterprise","List_of_charities_accused_of_ties_to_terrorism","World_Giving_Index"]}
