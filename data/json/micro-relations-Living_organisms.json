{"cursor":"35134","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'' cells provide an example of a prokaryotic microorganism]] mushroom has\nparasitic relationship with its host]] l fungus]] In biology, an 'organism' is\nany contiguous living system (such as animal, fungus, micro-organism, or plant).\nIn at least some form, all types of organisms are capable of response to\nstimuli, reproduction, growth and development, and maintenance of homeostasis as\na stable whole.\n\nAn organism may be either unicellular (a single cell) or, as in the case of\nhumans, comprise many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and\norgans. The term [[multicellular]] (many cells) describes any organism made up\nof more than one cell.\n\n All organisms living on Earth are divided\ninto the eukaryotes and prokaryotes based on the presence or absence of true\nnuclei in their cells. The prokaryotes represent two separate domains, the\nBacteria and Archaea. Eukaryotic organisms, with a membrane-bounded cell\nnucleus, also contain organelles, namely mitochondria and (in plants) plastids,\ngenerally considered to be derived from endosymbiotic bacteria. T.Cavalier-\nSmith (1987) The origin of eukaryote and archaebacterial cells, Annals of the\nNew York Academy of Sciences 503, 17â54 Fungi, animals and plants are\nexamples of species that are eukaryotes.\n\nIn 2002 Thomas Cavalier-Smith proposed a clade, Neomura, which groups together\nthe Archaea and Eukarya. Neomura is thought to have evolved from Bacteria, more\nspecifically from Actinobacteria. T.
