[http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=15491\nMedicineNet.com --> Definition of Anemia] Last Editorial Review: 12/9/2000\n8:31:00 AM [http://www.merriam-\nwebster.com/dictionary/anemia merriam-webster dictionary --> anemia] Retrieved\non May 25, 2009 However, it can include decreased oxygen-binding ability\nof each hemoglobin molecule due to deformity or lack in numerical development as\nin some other types of hemoglobin deficiency. Because hemoglobin (found inside\nRBCs) normally carries oxygen from the lungs to the capillaries, anemia leads to\nhypoxia (lack of oxygen) in organs. Since all human cells depend on oxygen for\nsurvival, varying degrees of anemia can have a wide range of clinical\nconsequences.\n\nAnemia is the most common disorder of the blood. The several kinds of anemia are\nproduced by a variety of underlying causes. It can be classified in a variety of\nways, based on the morphology of RBCs, underlying etiologic mechanisms, and\ndiscernible clinical spectra, to mention a few. The three main classes include\nexcessive blood loss (acutely such as a hemorrhage or chronically through low-\nvolume loss), excessive blood cell destruction (hemolysis) or deficient red\nblood cell production (ineffective hematopoiesis).\n\nOf the two major approaches to diagnosis, the \"kinetic\" approach involves\nevaluating production, destruction and loss, and the \"morphologic\"\napproach groups anemia by red blood cell size. The morphologic approach uses a\nquickly available and low-cost lab test as its starting point (the MCV). On the\nother hand, focusing early on the question of production may allow the clinician\nto expose cases more rapidly where multiple causes of anemia coexist.\n","linknr":846,"url":"anemia","recorded":1362572554,"links":92,"instances":["medicine","medicine","scientist","disorder","medical","medicine","medicine"],"pdf":["http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2008/9789241596657_eng.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20090312111339/http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2008/9789241596657_eng.pdf","http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2008/9789241596657_eng.pdf","http://www.who.int/nutrition/publications/en/ida_assessment_prevention_control.pdf","http://www.who.int/nutrition/publications/en/ida_assessment_prevention_control.pdf","http://www.trcc.org/blood/10b_autoimmune.pdf","http://choosingwisely.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/5things_12_factsheet_Amer_Soc_Neph.pdf","http://choosingwisely.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/5things_12_factsheet_Amer_Soc_Neph.pdf"],"categories":["Anemias","Hematopathology"],"headings":["Signs
