{"cursor":"6473","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":", Lord High Admiral of the United Kingdom.]] This is a 'List of Lords High\nAdmiral' of England, Great Britain and then the United Kingdom, beginning in the\n15th century. Most have been courtiers or members of the Royal family, and not\nprofessional naval officers. In medieval England the Lord High Admiral was one\nof the nine Great Officers of State.\n\nFrom the 17th century onwards, when an individual Lord High Admiral was\nappointed, there was also a Council of the Lord High Admiral which assisted him\nand performed some of the duties of the Admiralty. When the office was not\noccupied by an individual, it was \"put into commission\" and exercised by a board\nof Lords Commissioners headed by a First Lord of the Admiralty, and this was the\nusual arrangement from 1709 until 1964, when the office of First Lord of the\nAdmiralty was finally abolished and the functions of the Lords Commissioners\nwere transferred to the Admiralty Board of the tri-service Defence Council of\nthe United Kingdom.\n\nIn 1964 the ancient title of Lord High Admiral was vested in the sovereign. In\n2011, the title was bestowed by H. M. the Queen on her husband, the Duke of\nEdinburgh, on the occasion of his 90th birthday.\n","linknr":172,"url":"List_of_Lords_High_Admiral","recorded":1375075888,"links":["/w/index.php?title=List_of_Lords_High_Admiral&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=List_of_Lords_High_Admiral&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Prince_Philip_by_Allan_Warren_1992.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/54/Prince_Philip_by_Allan_Warren_1992.jpg/170px-Prince_Philip_by_Allan_Warren_1992.jpg","/wiki/File:Prince_Philip_by_Allan_Warren_1992.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf8/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Prince_Philip,_Duke_of_Edinburgh","/wiki/Kingdom_of_England","/wiki/Kingdom_of_Great_Britain","/wiki/United_Kingdom","/wiki/Great_Officers_of_State","/wiki/Admiralty","/wiki/First_Lord_of_the_Admiralty","/wiki/Admiralty_Board","/wiki/Defence_Council_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/British_Monarch","/wiki/Elizabeth_II","/wiki/Prince_Philip,_Duke_of_Edinburgh","#cite_note-bbc-1","#Lords_High_Admiral_of_England.2C_1413_to_1628","#Lords_High_Admiral_of_England.2C_1638.E2.80.931708","#Lords_High_Admiral_of_Great_Britain.2C_1708.E2.80.931709","#Lord_High_Admiral_of_the_United_Kingdom.2C_1827.E2.80.931828","#Lords_High_Admiral_of_the_United_Kingdom.2C_1964_to_present","#References","#See_also","/w/index.php?title=List_of_Lords_High_Admiral&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Thomas_Beaufort,_Duke_of_Exeter","/wiki/John_of_Lancaster,_1st_Duke_of_Bedford","/wiki/John_Holland,_2nd_Duke_of_Exeter","/wiki/William_de_la_Pole,_1st_Duke_of_Suffolk","/wiki/Henry_Holland,_3rd_Duke_of_Exeter","/wiki/William_Neville,_1st_Earl_of_Kent","/wiki/Richard_III_of_England","/wiki/Richard_Neville,_16th_Earl_of_Warwick","/wiki/Richard_III_of_England","/wiki/John_Howard,_1st_Duke_of_Norfolk","/wiki/John_de_Vere,_13th_Earl_of_Oxford","/wiki/Edward_Howard_(admiral)","/wiki/Thomas_Howard,_3rd_Duke_of_Norfolk","/wiki/Henry_FitzRoy,_1st_Duke_of_Richmond_and_Somerset","/wiki/William_Fitzwilliam,_1st_Earl_of_Southampton","/wiki/John_Russell,_1st_Earl_of_Bedford","/wiki/Edward_Seymour,_1st_Duke_of_Somerset","/wiki/John_Dudley,_1st_Duke_of_Northumberland","/wiki/Thomas_Seymour,_1st_Baron_Seymour_of_Sudeley","/wiki/John_Dudley,_1st_Duke_of_Northumberland","/wiki/Edward_Clinton,_1st_Earl_of_Lincoln","/wiki/William_Howard,_1st_Baron_Howard_of_Effingham","/wiki/Edward_Clinton,_1st_Earl_of_Lincoln","/wiki/Charles_Howard,_1st_Earl_of_Nottingham","/wiki/George_Villiers,_1st_Duke_of_Buckingham","/w/index.php?title=List_of_Lords_High_Admiral&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Algernon_Percy,_10th_Earl_of_Northumberland","/wiki/Francis_Cottington,_1st_Baron_Cottington","/wiki/James_II_of_England","#cite_note-nationalarchives-2","/wiki/Charles_II_of_England","#cite_note-nationalarchives-2","/wiki/Prince_Rupert_of_the_Palatinate","#cite_note-nationalarchives-2","/wiki/Charles_II_of_England","#cite_note-nationalarchives-2","/wiki/James_II_of_England","#cite_note-nationalarchives-2","/wiki/William_III_of_England","#cite_note-nationalarchives-2","/wiki/Arthur_Herbert,_1st_Earl_of_Torrington","#cite_note-nationalarchives-2","/wiki/Thomas_Herbert,_8th_Earl_of_Pembroke","#cite_note-nationalarchives-2","/wiki/Prince_George_of_Denmark","#cite_note-nationalarchives-2","/w/index.php?title=List_of_Lords_High_Admiral&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/Anne,_Queen_of_Great_Britain","#cite_note-nationalarchives-2","/wiki/Thomas_Herbert,_8th_Earl_of_Pembroke","#cite_note-nationalarchives-2","/w/index.php?title=List_of_Lords_High_Admiral&action=edit&section=4","/wiki/William_IV_of_the_United_Kingdom","/w/index.php?title=List_of_Lords_High_Admiral&action=edit&section=5","/wiki/Elizabeth_II","#cite_note-bbc-1","/wiki/Prince_Philip,_Duke_of_Edinburgh","#cite_note-bbc-1","/w/index.php?title=List_of_Lords_High_Admiral&action=edit&section=6","#cite_ref-bbc_1-0","#cite_ref-bbc_1-1","#cite_ref-bbc_1-2","http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-13730067","/wiki/BBC_News","#cite_ref-nationalarchives_2-0","#cite_ref-nationalarchives_2-1","#cite_ref-nationalarchives_2-2","#cite_ref-nationalarchives_2-3","#cite_ref-nationalarchives_2-4","#cite_ref-nationalarchives_2-5","#cite_ref-nationalarchives_2-6","#cite_ref-nationalarchives_2-7","#cite_ref-nationalarchives_2-8","#cite_ref-nationalarchives_2-9"
