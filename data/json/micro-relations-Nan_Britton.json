{"cursor":"4894","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Nan P. \"Nanny\" Britton' (November 9, 1896âMarch 21, 1991) was a figure\nassociated with the Presidency of Warren G. Harding due to her claim that\nHarding fathered her illegitimate daughter shortly before his election as\nPresident.\n\nBorn in Marion, Ohio, Britton developed an obsession with Harding, a friend of\nher father. As a girl, her bedroom walls were covered with images of Harding\nfrom local papers and magazines. While still less than 16 years old, she would\nalso dawdle near his [[Marion Daily Star]] building in downtown Marion, Ohio\nhoping to bump into him on his walk home from work.\n\nHer father, Dr. Britton, talked to Harding about his daughter's infatuation, and\nin turn, Harding spoke with the girl, assuring her that one day she would find\nthe man of her dreams. At the time, Harding was involved in a very passionate\naffair with Carrie Fulton Phillips, wife of James Phillips, co-owner of Marion's\nUhler-Phillips Company, a local department store. Following her graduation from\nMarion High School in 1914, Britton moved to New York City, where she hoped to\nstart a career as a secretary.\n\nFollowing Harding's death in 1923, Britton wrote what is considered to be the\nfirst kiss-and-tell book, [[The President's Daughter (1928 book)|The President's\nDaughter]], published in 1928. In it, she claimed to have been his mistress\nbefore and during his presidency, and that Harding was the father of her\ndaughter, Elizabeth Ann (1919â2005), who was later adopted by Britton's husband,\nMr. Christian. One famous passage mentions their making love in a coat\ncloset in the executive office of the White House.\n\nAccording to Britton, Harding had promised to support her daughter, but after\nhis sudden death in 1923, Harding's family refused to acknowledge the\nobligation. The ostensible purpose of the book was to earn money for the support\nof her daughter, and to champion the rights of illegitimate children.\nEventually, a lawsuit ([[Britton v. Klunk]]) was brought; however, Britton was\nunable to provide any concrete evidence and buckled under the cross-examination\nof former Marion U.S. Representative Grant Mouser, which cost her the case.\nAuthor Carl Sferraza Anthony ('Florence Harding', p. 530) writes that court\ntranscripts in Toledo, Ohio (Lucas County Ohio), stated that Mouser referred to\nBritton as a \"degenerate and pervert\" before shifting the defense's argument\nthat \"Mouser brought (Florence Kling Harding) into the conflict using Warren's\n'love of his good wife' against 'distorted ... deranged ... demented ...\ndiabolical' Nan who had no respect for the marriage tie ...\"\n\nBritton's memoirs seemed sincere, but her portrayal of Harding and his\ncolloquialisms â which she found charming â painted a picture of a crude\nwomanizer. In his 1931 book [[Only Yesterday: An Informal History of the\n1920s]], Frederick Lewis Allen remarks that, on the testimony of Britton's book,\nHarding's private life was \"one of cheap sex episodes\" and that \"one sees with\ndeadly clarity the essential ordinariness of the man, the commonness of his 'Gee\ndearie' and 'Say, you darling'.\" The book was among those irreverently reviewed\nby Dorothy Parker for [[The New Yorker]] magazine as part of her famous Constant\nReader column, under the title \"An American DuBarry.\"\n\nAt the time of her death, aged 94, on March 21, 1991 in Clackamas County,\nOregon, she was known as 'Nan P. Britton'. She was always resolute that Harding\nwas Elizabeth Ann's father.\n","linknr":114,"url":"Nan_Britton","recorded":1364116710,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Nan_Britton&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Nan_Britton&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:External_links","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources#Inline_citations","/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Fact_and_Reference_Check","/wiki/Warren_G._Harding","/wiki/Marion,_Ohio","/wiki/Marion_Daily_Star","/wiki/Marion,_Ohio","/wiki/Limerence","/wiki/Carrie_Fulton_Phillips","/wiki/Department_store","/wiki/New_York_City","/wiki/The_President%27s_Daughter_(1928_book)","/wiki/Elizabeth_Ann_Blaesing","/w/index.php?title=Britton_v._Klunk&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Cross-examination","/wiki/Grant_E._Mouser","#cite_note-1","/w/index.php?title=Only_Yesterday:_An_Informal_History_of_the_1920s&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Frederick_Lewis_Allen","/wiki/Dorothy_Parker","/wiki/The_New_Yorker","/wiki/Madame_du_Barry","/wiki/Clackamas_County,_Oregon","/w/index.php?title=Nan_Britton&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","/w/index.php?title=Carl_Sferraza_Anthony&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Nan_Britton&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0688077943","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0836971329","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0805069569","/wiki/University_of_Missouri_Press","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0826212026","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0871313405","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/56653843","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nan_Britton&oldid=538133732","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1896_births","/wiki/Category:1991_deaths","/wiki/Category:People_from_Marion,_Ohio","/wiki/Category:American_memoirists","/wiki/Category:American_women_writers","/wiki/Category:Warren_G._Harding","/wiki/Category:People_from_Clackamas_County,_Oregon","/wiki/Category:Articles_lacking_in-text_citations_from_May_2010","/wiki/Category:All_articles_lacking_in-text_citations","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Nan+Britton&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Nan+Britton","/wiki/Nan_Britton","/wiki/Talk:Nan_Britton","#","/wiki/Nan_Britton","/w/index.php?title=Nan_Britton&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Nan_Britton&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Nan_Britton","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Nan_Britton","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Nan_Britton&oldid=538133732","/w/index.php?title=Nan_Britton&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Nan_Britton&id=538133732","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Nan+Britton","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Nan+Britton&oldid=538133732&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Nan_Britton&printable=yes","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nan_Britton","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_m
