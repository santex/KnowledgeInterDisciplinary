It\noccupies the southern portion of Rulers Bar Hassock (known colloquially as\n\"Broad Channel Island\"), which is the only inhabited island (pop. about\n3,000) in Jamaica Bay. The neighborhood stands on Big Egg Marsh, an area of\nfill approximately 20 blocks long and 4 blocks wide. The community is an\ninholding within the Gateway National Recreation Area, a unit of the U.S\nNational Park Service\n\nLying between Howard Beach and the Rockaway Peninsula, it is connected to those\ncommunities by bridges at either end of the islandâthe Cross Bay Veterans\nMemorial Bridge and the Joseph P. Addabbo Memorial Bridgeâwhich carry vehicular,\nbicycle and pedestrian traffic. Cross Bay Boulevard is the only\nthrough road. The area consists of artificial canals separating dead-end\nresidential blocks.\n\nThe IND Rockaway Line of the New York City Subway ( trains) serves the Broad\nChannel station.\n\nFrom the 1950s to the 1970s, some mapmakers have shown the streets of Broad\nChannel numbered along the same continuum found in the rest of Queens besides\nthe Rockaways, with the numbers of \"Streets\" increasing from west to east, the\nnumbers of \"Avenues\" increasing from north to south, etc. http://forgotten-ny.com/2008/03/broad-channel-\nqueens/ However, Broad Channel streets have always had their own\nnumbering format, including \"East\" and \"West\" prefixed \"Roads\" numbered north\nto south, independent of those used elsewhere in the borough. The directional\nprefixes ensured no duplication with any other \"Road\" in Queens. Note that\nthere are no north-south streets in Broad Channel named as a \"Street\", they are\nmostly \"Roads\".\n","linknr":416,"url":"Broad_Channel,_Queens","recorded":1362545146,"links":24,"instances":["learning_for_life","ind_rockaway_line","new_york_city"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Islands of New York City","Neighborhoods in Queens","Irish-American neighborhoods","Neighborhoods in Rockaway, Queens","Islands of Queens County, New York"],"headings":["History","Education","Organizations","Parks","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a1/CBayBlvdBroadChn.JPG/250px-CBayBlvdBroadChn.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/63/Gateway_National_Recreation_Area_Jamaica_Bay_Unit_map.jpg/250px-Gateway_National_Recreation_Area_Jamaica_Bay_Unit_map.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cc/Virgilius_RC_n_Christ_Presb_Ch_jeh.jpg/220px-Virgilius_RC_n_Christ_Presb_Ch_jeh.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/11/PS_47_Chris_Gala_BC_jeh.jpg/220px-PS_47_Chris_Gala_BC_jeh.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7e/Queens_Library-Broad_Channel.jpg/220px-Queens_Library-Broad_Channel.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7c/Broad_Chan_FD_Amb_Rescue_jeh.jpg/220px-Broad_Chan_FD_Amb_Rescue_jeh.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/16/Unisphere_in_summer.jpg/90px-Unisphere_in_summer.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c1/Freiheitsstatue_NYC_full.jpg/50px-Freiheitsstatue_NYC_full.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["borough","new_york_city"],["broad_channel","ind_rockaway_line"],["history_of_new_york_city","1898-1945"],["exploring","learning_for_life"]],"members":["exploring","history_of_new_york_city","broad_channel","borough"],"related":["Neighborhoods_of_New_York_City","Gateway_National_Recreation_Area","Jamaica_Bay_Wildlife_Refuge","List_of_sovereign_states","United_States","U.S._state","New_York","List_of_counties_in_New_York","Queens_County,_New_York","New_York_City","Borough_(New_York_City)","Queens","Colloquially","Jamaica_Bay","Inholding","Gateway_National_Recreation_Area","National_Park_Service","Howard_Beach,_Queens","Rockaway,_Queens","Cross_Bay_Veterans_Memorial_Bridge","Joseph_P._Addabbo_Memorial_Bridge","Cross_Bay_Boulevard","IND_Rockaway_Line","New_York_City_Subway","Broad_Channel_(IND_Rockaway_Line)","Lenape","History_of_New_York_City_(1898-1945)","Gateway_National_Recreation_Area","National_Park_System","Broad_Channel_Corporation","Cross_Bay_Boulevard","Robert_Moses","John_F._Kennedy_International_Airport","New_York_City","James_Byrd,_Jr.","Blackface","Afro","FindLaw","Effects_of_Hurricane_Irene_in_New_York","Hurricane_Sandy","New_York_City_Department_of_Education","Venice","New_York_State_Senate","Queens_Borough_Public_Library","Jamaica,_Queens","Exploring_(Learning_for_Life)","Zodiac_Group","Jamaica_Bay","Baseball","Basketball","Roller_hockey","Park_Slope","Brooklyn","Hell's_Kitchen,_Manhattan","Manhattan","Broad_Channel_Civic_Association","Queens_Community_Board_14","Playground","Willow_tree","Red_maple","Euonymus_atropurpureus","Cross_Bay_Veterans_Memorial_Bridge"]}
