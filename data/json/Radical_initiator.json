{"cursor":"2698","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In chemistry, 'radical initiators' are substances that can produce radical\nspecies under mild conditions and promote radical reactions. These\nsubstances generally possess weak bonds—bonds that have small bond\ndissociation energies. Radical initiators are utilized in industrial processes\nsuch as polymer synthesis. Typical examples are halogen molecules, azo\ncompounds, and organic peroxides.\n\n*Like all diatomic molecules, halogens can generate two free radicals\nresulting from the homolysis of the bond, but halogens undergo the homolytic\nfission relatively easily. Chlorine, for example, gives two chlorine radicals\n(Clâ¢) by irradiation with ultraviolet light. This process is used for\nchlorination of alkanes.\n\n*Azo compounds (R-N=N-R') can be the precursor of two carbon-centered radicals\n(Râ¢ and R'â¢) and nitrogen gas upon heating and/or by irradiation. For example,\nAIBN and ABCN yield isobutyronitrile and cyclohexanecarbonitrile radicals,\nrespectively.\n:\n\n*Organic peroxides each have a peroxide bond (-O-O-), which is readily cleaved\nto give two oxygen-centered radicals. The oxyl radicals are rather unstable and\nbelieved to be transformed into relatively stable carbon-centered radicals. For\nexample, di-''tert''-butyl peroxide ( tBuOO tBu) gives two\nt-butanoyl radicals ( tBuOâ¢) and the radicals become methyl radicals\n(CH 3â¢) with the loss of acetone. Benzoyl peroxide\n((PhCOO) 2) generates benzoyloxyl radicals (PhCOOâ¢), each of which\nloses carbon dioxide to be converted into a phenyl radical (Phâ¢). Methyl ethyl\nketone peroxide is also common, and acetone peroxide is on rare occasions used\nas a radical initiator, too.\n\nRadical initiators, especially azo compounds and organic peroxides, are\ninherently unstable. They must be kept in a cool place or refrigerated. Care\nshould be taken with the handling of the compounds or an explosion may occur.\n","linknr":135,"url":"Radical_initiator","recorded":1362509929,"links":16,"instances":["chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Radical initiators|"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3f/AIBN-radical-2D.png/400px-AIBN-radical-2D.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["radical","chemistry"]],"members":["radical"],"related":["Chemistry","Radical_(chemistry)","Radical_reaction","Bond_dissociation_energy","Polymer","Halogen","Molecule","Azo_compound","Organic_peroxide","Diatomic","Molecule","Halogen","Homolysis","Halogen","Homolysis","Chlorine","Ultraviolet","Free-radical_halogenation","Alkane","Azo_compound","Nitrogen","Nitrogen","Carbon","Nitrogen","Azobisisobutyronitrile","ABCN","Organic_peroxide","Oxygen","Oxygen","Oxygen","Carbon","Di-tert-butyl_peroxide","Butyl","Oxygen","Butyl","Butyl","Oxygen","Methyl","Carbon","Hydrogen","Acetone","Benzoyl_peroxide","Phenyl","Carbon","Oxygen","Phenyl","Carbon","Oxygen","Carbon_dioxide","Phenyl","Phenyl","Methyl_ethyl_ketone_peroxide","Acetone_peroxide","Azo_compound","Organic_peroxide","Explosion"]}
