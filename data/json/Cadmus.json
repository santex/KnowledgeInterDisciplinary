(1883) The [[Greek Anthology]], pp. 160-162. the son of king\nAgenor and queen Telephassa of Tyre and the brother of Phoenix, Cilix and\nEuropa. He was originally sent by his royal parents to seek out and escort his\nsister Europa back to Tyre after she was abducted from the shores of Phoenicia\nby Zeus. A modern application of genealogy would make him the paternal\ngrandfather of Dionysus, through his daughter by Harmonia, Semele. Plutarch once\nadmitted that he would rather be assisted by Lamprias, his own grandfather, than\nby Dionysus' grandfather, i.e. Cadmus. (Symposiacs, Book IX, [http://etext.libr-\nary.adelaide.edu.au/p/plutarch/symposiacs/chapter9.html#section91 question\nII]) Cadmus founded the Greek city of Thebes, the acropolis of which was\noriginally named [[Cadmeia]] in his honor.\n\nCadmus was credited by the ancient Greeks (Herodotus Herodotus, Histories,\n[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+5.58&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%-\n3A1999.01.0126 Book V, 58]. is an example) with introducing the original\nAlphabet or Phoenician alphabet -- phoinikeia grammata, \"Phoenician letters\"âto\nthe Greeks, who adapted it to form their Greek alphabet. Herodotus estimates\nthat Cadmus lived sixteen hundred years before his time, or around 2000\nBC. Herodotus. Histories, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Per-\nseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126%3Abook%3D2%3Achapter%3D145%3Asection%3D4 Book II,\n2.145.4]. Herodotus had seen and described the Cadmean writing in the\ntemple of Apollo at Thebes engraved on certain tripods. He estimated those\ntripods to date back to the time of Laius the great-grandson of Cadmus.\nHerodotus. Histories, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+5.59.1-\n&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126 Book V.59.1] On one of the tripods\nthere was this inscription in Cadmean writing, which, as he attested, resembled\nIonian letters: (\"[[Amphitryon]] dedicated me [don't forget]the spoils of [the\nbattle of] Teleboae.\").\n\nThough later Greeks like Herodotus dated Cadmus's role in the founding myth of\nThebes to well before the Trojan War (or, in modern terms, during the Aegean\nBronze Age), this chronology conflicts with most of what is now known or thought\nto be known about the origins and spread of both the Phoenician and Greek\nalphabets. While a Phoenician origin for the Greek alphabet is certain, the\nearliest Greek inscriptions match Phoenician letter forms from the late 9th or\n8th centuries BCâand, in any case, the Phoenician alphabet properly speaking\nwasn't developed until around 1050 BC (or after the Bronze Age collapse). The\nHomeric picture of the Mycenaean age betrays extremely little awareness of\nwriting, possibly reflecting the loss during the Dark Age of the earlier Linear\nB script. Indeed the only Homeric reference to writing There are several\nexamples of written letters, such as in Nestor's narrative concerning\nBellerophon and the \"Bellerophontic letter\", another description of a letter\npresumably sent to Palamedes from Priam but in fact written by Odysseus\n(Hyginus. Fabulae, [http://www.theoi.com/Text/HyginusFabulae3.html#105 105]), as\nwell as the letters described by Plutarch in Parallel Lives, Theseus, which were\npresented to Ariadne presumably sent from Theseus. Plutarch goes on to describe\nhow Theseus erected a pillar on the Isthmus of Corinth, which bears an\ninscription of two lines. was in the phrase \"Î³ÏÎ¬Î¼Î¼Î±ÏÎ± Î»ÏÎ³ÏÎ¬\", grÃ¡mmata\nlygrÃ¡, literally \"uneducated\", when referring to the Bellerophontic letter.\n(According to Walter Burkert in The Orientalizing Revolution, literacy explodes\nwithin a few decades after 750 BC: \"The earliest Greek letters recognized to\ndate originate in Naxos, Ischia, Athens, and Euboea, and appear around or a\nlittle before 750\". Burkert, The Orientalizing Revolution 1993:26, noting\nthe inscribed Dipylon jug at Athens, the Ischia inscription on the \"cup of\nNestor\", a geometric period shard from Naxos and some Euboean material. )\nLinear B tablets have been found in abundance at Thebes, which might lead one to\nspeculate that the legend of Cadmus as bringer of the alphabet could reflect\nearlier traditions about the origins of Linear B writing in Greece (as Frederick\nAhl speculated in 1967 F.M. Ahl. \"Cadmus and the Palm-Leaf Tablets.\"\nAmerican Journal of Philology 88.2, Apr. 1967, pp. 188-94. ). But such a\nsuggestion, however attractive, is by no means a certain conclusion in light of\ncurrently available evidence. The connection between the name of Cadmus and the\nhistorical origins of either the Linear B script or the later Phoenician\nalphabet, if any, remains elusive. However, in modern day Lebanon, Cadmus is\nstill revered and celebrated as the 'carrier of the letter' to the world.\n\nAccording to Greek myth, Cadmus's descendants ruled at Thebes on and off for\nseveral generations, including the time of the Trojan War.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Cadmus","recorded":1372152323,"links":[],"instances":["mythology","mythology","mythology","mythology","son_of_agenor","mythology","mythology","boeotia","son_of_cadmus","greek_mythology","mythology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Metamorphoses in Greek mythology","Kings in Greek mythology","Theban kings","Mortal parents of demigods in Classical mythology","Phoenician characters in Greek mythology","Founding monarchs","Greek mythological hero cult","Greek culture heroes"],"headings":["Etymology","Wanderings","Native Boeotian hero","Genealogy","Offspring","See also","Citations","References","Further reading"],"image":[],"tags":[["phoenix","son_of_agenor"],["europa","mythology"],["harmonia","mythology"],["ancient_thebes","boeotia"],["palamedes","mythology"],["ancient_thebes","boeotia"],["harmonia","greek_goddess"],["ancient_thebes","boeotia"],["dragon's_teeth","mythology"],["harmonia","greek_goddess"],["polydorus","son_of_cadmus"],["agave","mythology"],["ino","greek_mythology"],["libya","mythology"],["nilus","mythology"],["harmonia","mythology"],["ino","greek_mythology"],["polydorus","son_of_cadmus"],["agave","mythology"],["ancient_thebes","boeotia"]],"members":["libya","europa","nilus","agave","phoenix","palamedes","harmonia","ancient_thebes","polydorus","ino"],"related":["Louvre_Museum","Greek_mythology","Agenor","Telephassa","Tyre,_Lebanon","Phoenix_(son_of_Agenor)","Cilix","Europa_(mythology)","Phoenicia","Zeus","Dionysus","Harmonia_(mythology)","Semele","Plutarch","Lamprias","Ancient_Thebes_(Boeotia)","Acropolis","Herodotus","Alphabet","Phoenician_alphabet","History_of_the_Greek_alphabet","Apollo","Laius","Ionic_Greek","Founding_myth","Trojan_War","Aegean_civilizations","History_of_the_Greek_Alphabet","Phoenician_alphabet","Bronze_Age_collapse","Linear_B","Homer","Bellerophon","Bellerophontic_letter","Palamedes_(mythology)","Priam","Odysseus","Hyginus","Plutarch","Parallel_Lives","Ariadne","Theseus","Isthmus_of_Corinth","Inscription","Bellerophontic_letter","Thebes_tablets","Frederick_Ahl","Lebanon","Trojan_War","LSJ","Pre-Greek","Euboea","Louvre","John_Adams_Building","Zeus","Phoenicia","Samothrace","Samothrace_temple_complex","Kabeiroi","Ancient_Thebes_(Boeotia)","Telephassa","Thasos","Diodorus_Siculus","Clement_of_Alexandria","Electra","Dardanos","Eetion","Iasion","Harmonia_(Greek_goddess)","Ares","Aphrodite","Hellenistic","Scholium","Peleus","Thetis","Apple_of_Discord","Delphi","Pythia","Pelagon","Phocis","Boeotia","Ancient_Thebes_(Boeotia)","Robert_Graves","Selene","Athena","Castalian_Spring","Lernaean_Hydra","Culture_hero","Dragon's_teeth_(mythology)","Ares","Harmonia_(Greek_goddess)","Polydorus_(son_of_Cadmus)","Agave_(mythology)","Autonoë","Ino_(Greek_mythology)","Semele","Hephaestus","Necklace_of_Harmonia","Illyria","Encheleans","Lychnidos","Bouthoe","Euripides","Dionysus","Phoenician_language","Hebrew","Orient","Walter_Burkert","Hesychius_of_Miletus","Hermes","Samothrace","Diodorus_Siculus","Zeus","Electra","Boeotia","Phoenicia","Alphabet","Pherecydes_of_Leros","Herodotus","Hellanicus_of_Mytilene","Poseidon","Libya_(mythology)","Nilus_(mythology)","River_Nile","Harmonia_(mythology)","Ino_(Greek_mythology)","Polydorus_(son_of_Cadmus)","Autonoe","Agave_(mythology)","Semele","Illyrius","Cadmus_of_Miletus","Cadmean_victory","Theban_kings_in_Greek_mythology","Ovid","Karl_Kerenyi","Theban_kings_in_Greek_mythology","Ancient_Thebes_(Boeotia)","Pentheus"]}
