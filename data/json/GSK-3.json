First discovered in\n1980 as a regulatory kinase for its namesake, Glycogen synthase, GSK-3 has since been identified as a kinase for over\nforty different proteins in a variety of different pathways. In mammals GSK-3 is encoded by two known genes, GSK-3\nalpha (GSK3A) and GSK-3 beta (GSK3B). GSK-3 has recently been the subject of\nmuch research because it has been implicated in a number of diseases, including\nType II diabetes (Diabetes mellitus type 2), Alzheimer's Disease, inflammation,\ncancer, and bipolar disorder.\n","linknr":733,"url":"GSK-3","recorded":1362900807,"links":18,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Protein kinases","Biology of bipolar disorder","EC 2.7.11"],"headings":["Mechanism","Function","Regulation","Disease Relevance","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/85/Gsk3.png/220px-Gsk3.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4b/GSK3_active_site.png/220px-GSK3_active_site.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["GSK3A","GSK3A","GSK3B","N-terminus","C-terminus","GSK3B","Serine/threonine_protein_kinase","Serine","Threonine","Glycogen_synthase","GSK3A","GSK3B","Diabetes_mellitus_type_2","Alzheimer's_Disease","Inflammation","Cancer","Bipolar_disorder","Glycogen_synthase","Casein_kinase_2","CK2","IRS1","Phosphoenolpyruvate_carboxykinase","Glucose_6_phosphatase","GSK3B","Beta-catenin","Beta-catenin","Wnt_signaling_pathway","Apoptosis","P53","Axin","Alzheimer's_disease","Diabetes_mellitus_type_2","Cancer","Bipolar_Disorder","Lithium","Bi-polar_disorder","Tau-protein_kinase"]}
