{"cursor":"20331","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Planned obsolescence' or 'built-in obsolescence' in\nindustrial design is a policy of planning or designing a product with a limited\nuseful life, so it will become obsolete, that is, unfashionable or no longer\nfunctional after a certain period of time. Planned\nobsolescence has potential benefits for a producer because to obtain continuing\nuse of the product the consumer is under pressure to purchase again, whether\nfrom the same manufacturer (a replacement part or a newer model), or from a\ncompetitor which might also rely on planned obsolescence.\n\nFor an industry, planned obsolescence stimulates demand by encouraging\npurchasers to buy sooner if they still want a functioning product. Built-in\nobsolescence is used in many different products. There is, however, the\npotential backlash of consumers who learn that the manufacturer invested money\nto make the product obsolete faster; such consumers might turn to a producer (if\nany exists) that offers a more durable alternative.\n\nEstimates of planned obsolescence can influence a company's decisions about\nproduct engineering. Therefore, the company can use the least expensive\ncomponents that satisfy product lifetime projections. Such decisions are part of\na broader discipline known as value engineering.\n","linknr":278,"url":"Planned_obsolescence","recorded":1362485859,"links":43,"instances":["product","electricity","economics","designer","economics","law"],"pdf":["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/London_(1932)_Ending_the_depression_through_planned_obsolescence.pdf","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/London_%281932%29_Ending_the_depression_through_planned_obsolescence.pdf"],"categories":["Ethically disputed business practices","Product development","Waste","Business","Commerce","Trade","Marketing techniques","Industrial history","History of technology"],"headings":["Origins of the phrase","Types of obsolescence","Economics of planned obsolescence","Obsolescence and durability","Planned obsolescence in software","Ethics and consequences of planned obsolescence","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/London_%281932%29_Ending_the_depression_through_planned_obsolescence.pdf/page1-220px-London_%281932%29_Ending_the_depression_through_planned_obsolescence.pdf.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/Factory_1b.svg/32px-Factory_1b.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Emblem-money.svg/28px-Emblem-money.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Conscience_and_law.jpg/32px-Conscience_and_law.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/Aegopodium_podagraria1_ies.jpg/32px-Aegopodium_podagraria1_ies.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["good","economics"],["competition","economics"],["company","law"],["george_nelson","designer"],["battery","electricity"],["end-of-life","product"]],"members":["battery","competition","george_nelson","good","company"],"related":["Good_(economics)","Obsolete","Production,_costs,_and_pricing","Consumer","Competition_(economics)","Company_(law)","Product_engineering","Product_lifetime","Discipline","Value_engineering","Bernard_London","Brooks_Stevens","Minneapolis","Volkswagen","Vance_Packard","Debt","George_Nelson_(designer)","Sales","Purchasing","Research_and_development","Opportunity_cost","Vance_Packard","Technological","Innovation","Monopoly","Maintenance,_repair_and_operations","Gramophone_record","Magnetic_tape_sound_recording","Compact_Disc","VHS","DVD","Blu-ray_Disc","Battery_(electricity)","Solder","Rechargeable_battery","Substitute_good","Complement_good","Reverse-engineering","Marketing","Automobile","Clothing","Mobile_phone","Oligopoly","Information_asymmetry","Japan","1960s","1970s","Externalities","Waste","Pollution","Natural_resource","Consumer_spending","Jury-rig","MacGyverism","Upcycling","Economic_growth","Value_engineering","Overengineering","Vance_Packard","Engineering","Proprietary_software","End-of-life_(product)","Open_source_software","Backwards_compatibility","Continuous_obsolescence","DIVX","DVD-D","Functional_obsolescence","Phoebus_cartel","Product_lifecycle"]}
