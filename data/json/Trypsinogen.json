{"cursor":"5428","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Trypsinogen' (EC 3.4.23.18/20/21/23/24/26) is the precursor form or zymogen of\nthe pancreatic enzyme trypsin. It is found in pancreatic juice, along with\namylase, lipase, and chymotrypsinogen. It is activated by enteropeptidase, which\nis found in the intestinal mucosa, to form trypsin. Once activated, the trypsin\ncan activate more trypsinogen into trypsin. Trypsin cleaves the peptide bond on\nthe carboxyl side of basic amino acids such as arginine and lysine.\n","linknr":153,"url":"Trypsinogen","recorded":1362484423,"links":18,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["EC 3.4.23"],"headings":["Function","Activation of trypsinogen","Safeguards against trypsinogen activation","Serum trypsinogen","Trypsinogen isoforms","Trypsinogen and diseases","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/Merge-arrow.svg/50px-Merge-arrow.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Precursor_form","Zymogen","Pancreatic","Enzyme","Trypsin","Pancreatic_juice","Amylase","Lipase","Chymotrypsinogen","Enteropeptidase","Intestinal_mucosa","Trypsin","Trypsin","Trypsin","Amino_acid","Arginine","Lysine","Digestion","Mucosa","Lysine","Oxyanion_hole","Aprotinin","SPINK1","Aspartate","Blood_plasma","Blood_test","Pancreatitis","Cystic_fibrosis","Isoforms","Pancreatitis","Trypsin_1"]}
