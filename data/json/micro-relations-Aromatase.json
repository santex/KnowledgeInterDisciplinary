{"cursor":"18836","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Aromatase', also called 'estrogen synthetase' or 'estrogen synthase', is an\nenzyme responsible for a key step in the biosynthesis of estrogens. It is a\nmember of the cytochrome P450 superfamily (), which are monooxygenases that\ncatalyze many reactions involved in steroidogenesis. In particular, aromatase is\nresponsible for the aromatization of androgens into estrogens. The aromatase\nenzyme can be found in many tissues including gonads, brain, adipose tissue,\nplacenta, blood vessels, skin, and bone, as well as in tissue of endometriosis,\nuterine fibroids, breast cancer, and endometrial cancer. It is an important\nfactor in sexual development. Some bodybuilders taking steroids also take\nantiaromatase supplements to prevent excess testosterone conversion into\nestrogens, which can cause gynecomastia.\n","linknr":1139,"url":"Aromatase","recorded":1362485047,"links":32,"instances":["biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["EC 1.14.14","Cytochrome P450"],"headings":["Function","Genomics","Activity","Role in sex-determination","Disorders","Aromatase inhibitors","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/85/Aromatase_3EQM.png/250px-Aromatase_3EQM.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/PBB_GE_CYP19A1_203475_at_tn.png/250px-PBB_GE_CYP19A1_203475_at_tn.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/72/Testosterone_estradiol_conversion.png/400px-Testosterone_estradiol_conversion.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/db/Aromatase_mechanism.png/485px-Aromatase_mechanism.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["promoter","biology"]],"members":["promoter"],"related":["Enzyme","Biosynthesis","Estrogens","Cytochrome_P450","Monooxygenase","Steroidogenesis","Aromaticity","Androgen","Estrogen","Gonads","Brain","Adipose_tissue","Placenta","Blood_vessels","Skin","Bone","Endometriosis","Uterine_fibroids","Breast_cancer","Endometrial_cancer","Sexual_development","Bodybuilding","Steroid","Testosterone","Gynecomastia","Subcellular_localization","Endoplasmic_reticulum","Promoter_(biology)","Hormones","Cytokines","Androstenedione","Estrone","Testosterone","Estradiol","Hydroxylation","Formic_acid","Estradiol","Cyclic_compound","Aromaticity","Redox","Elimination_reaction","Estrogen","Gene","Chromosome","Chordate","Cephalochordate","Amphioxus","Lancelet","Tunicate","Invertebrates","Insects","Molluscs","Echinoderms","Sea_sponge","Corals","Estrogens","Senescence","Obesity","Insulin","Gonadotropins","Alcohol","Prolactin","Anti-MÃ¼llerian_hormone","Temperature-dependent_sex_determination","Sex_reversal","Temperature-dependent_sex_determination","Gynecomastia","Precocious_puberty","Gigantomastia","Epiphysis","Akhenaten","Autosomal_recessive","Virilization","Amenorrhea","Hypoestrogenism","Aromatase_inhibitor","Breast_cancer","Estrogen_receptor","Letrozole","Androgen_replacement_therapy","Mushrooms","WikiNews"]}
