There are hundreds\nof potential factors, both physical and emotional, which can influence the mother-\nchild bonding process.\n\nMany new mothers do not always experience the \"instantly-in-mother-love\"\nemotions. Bonding is a gradually unfolding experience that can take hours, days,\nweeks, or even months to develop.\n",
