{"cursor":"5614","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Hughes Tool Company' was established in 1908 as Sharp-Hughes Tool Company when\nHoward R. Hughes, Sr. patented a roller cutter bit that dramatically improved\nthe rotary drilling process for oil drilling rigs. He partnered with longtime\nbusiness associate Walter Benona Sharp to manufacture and market the bit.\nSharp's widow, Estelle Sharp, sold her 50% share in the company to Howard Hughes\nSr. following her husband's death in 1912. The company was renamed Hughes Tool\nat this point.\n\nWhen Hughes Sr. died in 1924, 75% of the company was left to Howard Hughes Jr.,\nwho at the time was a student at Rice University. According to Howard Sr.'s\nwill, his son was to initially receive a 25% share, his wife 50%, and the\nremaining 25% was to be divided between various family members. Since Howard\nSr.'s wife had died some years earlier, and the will had not been updated to\nreflect that, Howard Jr. automatically inherited his mother's shares. Resentful\nof his relatives' attempts to run the business, Howard Hughes Jr. had himself\ndeclared a legal adult (21 being the age of majority at the time), and bought\nout his relatives' minority share in the business.\n\nUnder Howard Jr.'s ownership, Hughes Tool ventured into the motion picture\nbusiness via Hughes Productions during the 1920s, and into the airline business\nin 1939 with the acquisition of a controlling interest in Transcontinental and\nWestern Air (later renamed Trans World Airlines).\n\nIn 1932, Hughes formed Hughes Aircraft Company as a division of the Hughes Tool\nCompany. Hughes Aircraft thrived on wartime contracts during World War II\n(though not on the only two contracts it received to actually build airplanes),\nand by the early 1950s was one of America's largest defense contractors and\naerospace companies with revenues far outpacing the original oil tools business.\nIn 1953, Hughes Aircraft became a separate company and was donated to the Howard\nHughes Medical Institute as its endowment. Hughes Aircraft's helicopter\nmanufacturing business was retained by Hughes Tool Co. as its Aircraft Division\nuntil 1972.\n\nFor a period of time in the 1940s to late 1950s, Hughes Tool owned the RKO\ncompanies, including RKO Pictures, RKO Studios, RKO Theatres, and the RKO Radio\nNetwork. For a brief period in the early 1960s, Hughes Tool held a minority\nstake in Northeast Airlines. Hughes Tool's majority stake in TWA was sold off in\n1966. Two years later, in 1968, Hughes Tool Company purchased the North Las\nVegas Air Terminal.\n\nIn the late 1960s, Hughes Tool ventured into the hotel and casino business with\nthe acquisition of the Sands, Castaways, Landmark, Frontier, Silver Slipper, and\nDesert Inn, all in Las Vegas. Hughes Tool also purchased KLAS-TV, Las Vegas' CBS\naffiliate. In the early 70's, Hughes Tool ventured back into the airline\nindustry with the takeover of the largest regional air carrier in the western\nUnited States: Air West, renamed Hughes Airwest following the purchase. Hughes\nTool also briefly owned Los Angeles Airways, a small airline operating a\ncommuter service with a fleet of helicopters.\n\nIn 1968, Hughes Tool purchased Sports Network Incorporated and renamed it the\nHughes Television Network, with Dick Bailey continuing as president.\n\nThe huge main plant for Hughes Tool located in Houston, Texas, fronting\nHarrisburg Blvd., had grown to be one of the biggest oil tool manufacturers in\nthe World. It had the latest, largest, and most automated equipment for\nfoundries, forging, heat treating, and machining anywhere. At its peak during\nthe Texas Oil Boom, it was a center for manufacturing, design, research,\nmetallurgy, and engineering for oil field technologies. This included tool bits\nand tool joints critical for oil drilling, some of the first technologies for\nram blast bits for drilling in mines, geothermal drilling, and a hydraulic\njackhammer known as the Hughes Impactor. It even had a fully\nfunctioning oil drilling rig inside its main research lab where any kind of rock\nbit could be tested on any kind of rock, up to and including granite. In 1972,\nHoward Hughes sold the Hughes Tool Company; it had been the consistently\nprofitable part of his empire, and produced the profits that built all the rest\nfrom the very beginning. This became the \"new\" Hughes Tool Company while the\nremaining divisions of the business were placed in a new holding company, the\nSumma Corporation.\n\nHughes Tool merged with Baker International to form Baker Hughes\nIncorporated in 1987.\n","linknr":131,"url":"Hughes_Tool_Company","recorded":1374763678,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Hughes_Tool_Company&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Hughes_Tool_Company&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hughes_Tool_Company&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Template:Citation_needed","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:LEAD","/wiki/Wikipedia:Layout_guide","/wiki/Wikipedia:Lead_section_guidelines","/wiki/Howard_R._Hughes,_Sr.","/wiki/Drilling","/wiki/Drilling_rig","/wiki/Walter_Benona_Sharp","/wiki/Howard_Hughes","/wiki/Rice_University","/wiki/Trans_World_Airlines","/wiki/Hughes_Aircraft_Company","/wiki/Howard_Hughes_Medical_Institute","/wiki/RKO_Pictures","/wiki/RKO_Radio_Network","/wiki/Northeast_Airlines","/wiki/North_Las_Vegas_Airport","/wiki/Sands_Hotel","/wiki/Castaways_(casino)","/wiki/The_Landmark_Hotel_and_Casino","/wiki/New_Frontier_Hotel_and_Casino","/wiki/Silver_Slipper","/wiki/Desert_Inn","/wiki/Las_Vegas,_Nevada","/wiki/KLAS-TV","/wiki/CBS","/wiki/Hughes_Airwest","/wiki/Los_Angeles_Airways","/wiki/Hughes_Television_Network","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Houston","/wiki/Texas_Oil_Boom","/wiki/Tool_bit","/w/index.php?title=Ram_blast_bit&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Geothermal_drilling","/wiki/Jackhammer","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Granite","/wiki/Summa_Corporation","/wiki/Merger","/wiki/Baker_International","/wiki/Baker_Hughes","/w/index.php?title=Hughes_Tool_Company&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1499&dat=19680907&id=EW0jAAAAIBAJ&sjid=UigEAAAAIBAJ&pg=2325,2955778","#cite_ref-2","http://worldwide.espacenet.com/textdoc?DB=EPODOC&IDX=US3699675","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hughes_Tool_Company&oldid=542522527","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Howard_Hughes","/wiki/Category:Defunct_manufacturing_companies_of_the_United_States","/wiki/Category:Oilfield_services_companies","/wiki/Category:Companies_established_in_1908","/wiki/Category:1908_establishments_in_the_United_States","/wiki/Category:Articles_needing_additional_references_from_December_2009","/wiki/Category:All_articles_needing_additional_references","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_introduction_cleanup_from_May_2012","/wiki/Category:All_pages_needing_cleanup","/wiki/Category:Articles_covered_by_WikiProject_Wikify_from_May_2012","/wiki/Category:All_articles_covered_by_WikiProject_Wikify","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Hughes+Tool+Company&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Hughes+Tool+Company","/wiki/Hughes_Tool_Company","/wiki/Talk:Hughes_Tool_Company","#","/wiki/Hughes_Tool_Company","/w/index.php?title=Hughes_Tool_Company&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Hughes_Tool_Company&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf8/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Hughes_Tool_Company","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Hughes_Tool_Company","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Hughes_Tool_Company&oldid=542522527","/w/index.php?title=Hughes_Tool_Company&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Hughes_Tool_Company&id=542522527","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Hughes+Tool+Company","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Hughes+Tool+Company&oldid=542522527&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Hughes_Tool_Company&printable=yes","//de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hughes_Tool_Company","//fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hughes_Tool_Compa
