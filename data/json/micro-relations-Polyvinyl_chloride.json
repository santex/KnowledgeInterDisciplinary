It can\nbe made softer and more flexible by the addition of plasticizers, the most\nwidely used being phthalates. In this form, it is also used in clothing and\nupholstery, electrical cable insulation, inflatable products and many\napplications in which it replaces rubber.\n\nPure polyvinyl chloride is a white, brittle solid. It is insoluble in alcohol,\nbut slightly soluble in tetrahydrofuran.\n","linknr":599,"url":"Polyvinyl_chloride","recorded":1362555474,"links":42,"instances":["chemistry","london","physics","architecture"],"pdf":["http://www.institutodopvc.org/congresso2/ShahRahman.pdf","http://www.institutodopvc.org/congresso2/ShahRahman.pdf","http://www.hultec.co.za/downloads/Buried_lifelines.pdf","http://www.hultec.co.za/downloads/Buried_lifelines.pdf","http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/site/en/oj/2005/l_344/l_34420051227en00400043.pdf","http://www.dehp-facts.com/upload/documents/webpage/DEHP%20RA%20report%20full.pdf","http://ec.europa.eu/health/ph_risk/committees/04_scenihr/docs/scenihr_o_014.pdf","http://www.didp-facts.com/upload/documents/document7.pdf","http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/ost/dehp-pvc.pdf","http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/ost/dehp-pvc.pdf","http://www.pops.int/documents/meetings/cop_2/followup/toolkit/submissions/IPEN%20Comments/Estimating%20Dioxin%20Releases%20English.pdf","http://www.nrel.gov/docs/legosti/old/5518.pdf","http://www.pvcinfo.be/bestanden/ASME%20abstract1.pdf","http://www.pvcinfo.be/bestanden/ASME%20abstract1.pdf","http://www.healthybuilding.net/pvc/Thornton_Enviro_Impacts_of_PVC.pdf","http://www.healthybuilding.net/pvc/Thornton_Enviro_Impacts_of_PVC.pdf","http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/pvc/pdf/en.pdf","http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/sectors/chemicals/files/sustdev/pvc-final_report_lca_en.pdf","http://www.solvayplastics.com/sites/solvayplastics/SiteCollectionDocuments/VinyLoop/The%20VinyLoop%20Eco-Footprint%20Study.pdf","http://www.london2012.com/mm%5CDocument%5CPublications%5CStategiesPolicy%5C01%5C24%5C09%5C43%5Cuse-of-pvc-policy.pdf","http://learninglegacy.london2012.com/documents/pdfs/design-and-engineering-innovation/221-implementation-of-pvc-policy.pdf","http://chej.org/wp-content/uploads/Documents/PVC/bad_news_comes_in_threes.pdf"],"categories":["Plastics","Vinyl
