It\nconsists of steel wire ropes mounted on weak posts. As is the case with any\nroadside barrier, its primary purpose is to prevent a vehicle from leaving\nthe traveled way and striking a fixed object or terrain feature that is less\nforgiving than itself. American\nAssociation of State Highway and Transportation Officials. Roadside Design\nGuide. Third Edition, 2006. Task Force on Roadside Safety, 2006. Also\nsimilar to most roadside barriers, cable barriers function by capturing\nand/or redirecting the errant vehicle.\n\nBecause these barriers are relatively inexpensive to install and very effective\nat capturing vehicles, their use is becoming increasingly prevalent worldwide.\nBy far, the most popular use of the cable barrier system occurs in the medians\nof divided highways.\n\nGiven the opposing directions of traffic on divided highways, cross median\ncrashes are particularly severe. While median width plays a large role in the\noccurrence of these crashes, increased width alone does not eliminate them and\nquite often, the median must be shielded with a barrier. Cable barriers provide\na cost-effective solution to the shielding issue.\n\nThe system is more forgiving than traditional concrete (Jersey) barriers or\nsteel barriers used today and remains effective when installed on sloping\nterrain. The flexibility of the system absorbs impact energy and dissipates it\nlaterally, which reduces the forces transmitted to the vehicle occupants.\n\nAlthough cable barriers have been used since the 1960s it wasnât until the mid\n1990s that many departments of transportation began to deploy them with any\nregularity.\n\nIn many countries of the European Union these cable barriers are not allowed to\nbe used along highways due to the perception that they are especially hazardous\nfor motorcyclists.\n","linknr":197,"url":"Cable_barrier","recorded":1362890058,"links":18,"instances":["device","engineering","united_states"],"pdf":["http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/publications/fulltext/cablemedianbarrier/11_AppdxC_Reduced.pdf"],"categories":["Road safety","Road infrastructure"],"headings":["Types","Performance limits","Environmental limits","Defective installation and accidents","Common specifications","Common characteristics","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Ambox_globe_content.svg/48px-Ambox_globe_content.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/94/E20_2plus1_west_of_Skara.jpg/350px-E20_2plus1_west_of_Skara.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf8/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["spring","device"],["national_highway_system","united_states"],["deflection","engineering"],["washington","u.s._state"]],"members":["spring","deflection","national_highway_system","washington"],"related":["Sweden","Traffic_barrier","Steel","Wire_rope","Vehicle","Terrain","Divided_highways","Jersey_barrier","Energy","European_Union","Spring_(device)","Workhorse","Manufacturing","Temperature","National_Highway_System_(United_States)","Highway","Passenger","Automobile","Pickup_truck","Semi-trailer_truck","Slope","Computer","Deflection_(engineering)","Arizona","Arizona_Department_of_Transportation","Washington_(U.S._state)","Department_of_Transportation","Crash_barrier","Concrete_step_barrier","Jersey_barrier","Guard_rail","Impact_attenuator"]}
