H. P. Westman et al., (ed), Reference Data for Radio Engineers,\nFifth Edition, 1968, Howard W. Sams and Co., no ISBN, Library of Congress Card\nNo. 43-14665 page 26-1 As a form of electromagnetic radiation, like light\nwaves, radio waves are affected by the phenomena of reflection, refraction,\ndiffraction, absorption, polarization and scattering. Demetrius T Paris and\nF. Kenneth Hurd, Basic Electromagnetic Theory, McGraw Hill, New York 1969 ISBN\n-0 048470-8, Chapter 8\n\nRadio propagation is affected by the daily changes of water vapor in the\ntroposphere and ionization in the upper atmosphere, due to the Sun.\nUnderstanding the effects of varying conditions on radio propagation has many\npractical applications, from choosing frequencies for international shortwave\nbroadcasters, to designing reliable mobile telephone systems, to radio\nnavigation, to operation of radar systems.\n\nRadio propagation is also affected by several other factors determined by its\npath from point to point. This path can be a direct line of sight path or an over-the-\nhorizon path aided by refraction in the ionosphere, which is a region between\napproximately 60 and 600 km. Radiowave propagation, edited by M.Hall\nand L.Barclay, page 2, published by Peter Peregrinus Ltd., (1989), ISBN 0-86341-156-\n8 Factors influencing ionospheric radio signal propagation can include sporadic-\nE, spread-F, solar flares, geomagnetic storms, ionospheric layer tilts, and\nsolar proton events.\n\nRadio waves at different frequencies propagate in different ways. At extra low\nfrequencies (ELF) and very low frequencies the wavelength is very much larger\nthan the separation between the earth's surface and the D layer of the\nionosphere, so electromagnetic waves may propagate in this region as a\nwaveguide. Indeed, for frequencies below 20 kHz, the wave propagates as a\nsingle waveguide mode with a horizontal magnetic field and vertical electric\nfield. Radiowave propagation, edited by M.Hall and L.Barclay, published by\nPeter Peregrinus Ltd., page 3, (1989), ISBN 0-86341-156-8 The interaction\nof radio waves with the ionized regions of the atmosphere makes radio\npropagation more complex to predict and analyze than in free space. Ionospheric\nradio propagation has a strong connection to space weather. A sudden ionospheric\ndisturbance or shortwave fadeout is observed when the x-rays associated with a\nsolar flare ionize the ionospheric D-region. Enhanced ionization in that region\nincreases the absorption of radio signals passing through it. During the\nstrongest solar x-ray flares, complete absorption of virtually all\nionospherically propagated radio signals in the sunlit hemisphere can occur.\nThese solar flares can disrupt HF radio propagation and affect GPS accuracy.\n\nSince radio propagation is not fully predictable, such services as emergency\nlocator transmitters, in-flight communication with ocean-crossing aircraft, and\nsome television broadcasting have been moved to communications satellites. A\nsatellite link, though expensive, can offer highly predictable and stable line\nof sight coverage of a given area.\n","linknr":544,"url":"Radio_propagation","recorded":1362570135,"links":28,"instances":["amateur_radio_software","radio","waves","physics","astronomy","electromagnetic_radiation","meteorology","physics"],"pdf":["http://www.ncg.knaw.nl/Publicaties/Geodesy/pdf/56Kleijer.pdf"],"categories":["Radio frequency propagation|"],"headings":["Free space propagation","Modes","Measuring HF Propagation","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/d/a/f/daf646301adafe20f1ea9eedb869d7d5.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1d/Radio_icon.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["reflection","physics"],["absorption","electromagnetic_radiation"],["polarization","waves"],["polarization","waves"],["reflection","physics"],["skip","radio"],["aurora","astronomy"],["inversion","meteorology"],["wspr","amateur_radio_software"],["inversion","meteorology"],["ray_tracing","physics"],["skip","radio"]],"members":["wspr","skip","polarization","ray_tracing","aurora","absorption","inversion","reflection"],"related":["Radio_wave","Transmitted","Wave_propagation","Earth","Atmosphere","Electromagnetic_radiation","Reflection_(physics)","Refraction","Diffraction","Absorption_(electromagnetic_radiation)","Polarization_(waves)","Scattering","Water_vapor","Troposphere","Upper_atmosphere","Sun","Shortwave","Broadcasting","Mobile_phone","Radio_navigation","Radar","Line-of-sight_propagation","Horizon","Refraction","Ionosphere","Sporadic_E_propagation","Solar_flare","Geomagnetic_storm","Solar_proton_event","Space_weather","Sudden_ionospheric_disturbance","Solar_flares","HF_radio","Global_Positioning_System","Distress_radiobeacon","Television","Communications_satellite","Free_space","Electromagnetic_wave","Inverse-square_law","Point_source","Extremely_low_frequency","Hertz","Very_low_frequency","Kilohertz","Ionosphere","Low_frequency","Kilohertz","D_layer","Surface_wave","Medium_frequency","Kilohertz","F_layer","High_frequency","Shortwave","Megahertz","E_layer","F2_propagation","Very_high_frequency","Megahertz","Sporadic_E_propagation","F2_propagation","Tropospheric_ducting","Ultra_high_frequency","Megahertz","Line-of-sight_propagation","Tropospheric_ducting","Super_high_frequency","Gigahertz","Extremely_high_frequency","Gigahertz","Groundwave","Polarization_(waves)","Attenuation","Low_frequency","VLF","Earth-ionosphere_waveguide","Time_signal","Military_communications","Long_wave","Medium_wave","Short_wave","American_Radio_Relay_League","Line-of-sight_propagation","VHF","Ground_plane","Reflection_(physics)","Skywave","Skip_(radio)","Refraction","Ionosphere","Earth's_atmosphere","Maximum_usable_frequency","Diurnal","Sunspot_cycle","10.7cm_radiation","Solar_minima","Amateur_radio","Ocean","Aircraft","Shortwave","Radio_propagation_beacon","Meteor","Meteor_burst_communications","Aurora_(astronomy)","Backscatter","Solar_flare","Coronal_holes","Coronal_mass_ejection","Sporadic_E","Radio_propagation_beacon","VHF","Troposphere","White_Alice_Communications_System","Tropospheric_scatter","Microwave","UHF","VHF","Inversion_(meteorology)","GPS_meteorology","Gigahertz","Wavelength","Horizontal_polarization","Vertical_polarization","Knife-Edge_diffraction","Line-of-sight_propagation","Cellular_telephony","Multipath_propagation","Microwave","Radar","World_War_II","VOACAP","Chirp_Transmitter","WSPR_(amateur_radio_software)","Diversity_scheme","Earth_bulge","Earth-ionosphere_waveguide","Electromagnetic_radiation","Fading","Fresnel_zone","Free_space","Inversion_(meteorology)","Kennelly–Heaviside_layer","Near_and_far_field","Radio_atmospherics","Radio_frequency","Radio_horizon","Radio_propagation_model","Rayleigh_fading","Ray_tracing_(physics)","Schumann_resonance","Skip_(radio)","Skip_zone","Skywave","Tropospheric_propagation","TV_and_FM_DX","Upfade","VOACAP","ARRL","Space_weather","Doctor_of_Medicine","PhD","Physics","Astronomy","University_of_Tennessee","Cell_phones","Mobile_devices","Wireless_Markup_Language","Wireless_Application_Protocol","Space_weather"]}
