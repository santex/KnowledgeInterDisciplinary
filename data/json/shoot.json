The new growth from seed germination that grows upward\nis a shoot where leaves will develop. In the spring, perennial plant shoots are\nthe new growth that grows from the ground in herbaceous plants or the new stem\nand/or flower growth that grows on woody plants.\n\n ]] In everyday speech, shoots are often confused with stems. Stems, which are a\n critical component of shoots, provide an axis for buds, fruits, and leaves.\n\nShoots are often eaten by animals because the fibres in the new growth have not\nyet completed secondary cell wall development; this makes shoots softer and\neasier to chew and digest. As shoots grow and age, the cells develop completed\ncell walls that have a hard and tough structure. Some plants (e.g. bracken)\nproduce toxins that make their shoots inedible or less palatable.\n\n shoot]]\n",
