Depending on its locale or certain characteristics, a stream\nmay be referred to as a branch, brook, beck, [[Burn (topography)|burn]], creek,\n\"crick\", gill (occasionally ghyll), [[Kill (body of water)|kill]], [[lick\n(stream)|lick]], [[mill race]], [[rill]], [[river]], syke, [[bayou]], rivulet,\nstreamage, wash, run or runnel.\n\nStreams are important as conduits in the water cycle, instruments in groundwater\nrecharge, and corridors for fish and wildlife migration. The biological habitat\nin the immediate vicinity of a stream is called a riparian zone. Given the\nstatus of the ongoing Holocene extinction, streams play an important corridor\nrole in connecting fragmented habitats and thus in conserving biodiversity. The\nstudy of streams and waterways in general is known as surface [[hydrology]] and\nis a core element of environmental geography. U.S. Geological Survey (USGS).\nAtlanta, GA.
