      "text" : "\nA 'chain reaction' is a sequence of reactions where a reactive product or by-\nproduct causes additional reactions to take place. In a chain reaction, positive\nfeedback leads to a self-amplifying chain of events.\n\nChain reactions are one way in which systems which are in thermodynamic non-\nequilibrium can release energy or increase entropy in order to reach a state of\nhigher entropy. For example, a system may not be able to reach a lower energy\nstate by releasing energy into the environment, because it is hindered in some\nway from taking the path that will result in the energy release. If a reaction\nresults in a small energy release making way for more energy releases in an\nexpanding chain, then the system will typically collapse explosively until much\nor all of the stored energy has been released. Since chain reactions result in\nenergy transformation into forms associated with larger amounts of entropy. In\naccordance with the laws of thermodynamics, the reactions cannot be reversed.\n\nA macrosopic metaphor for chain reactions is thus a snowball causing larger\nsnowfall until finally an avalanche results (\"snowball effect\"). This is a\nresult of stored gravitational potential energy seeking a path of release over\nfriction. Chemically, the equivalent to a snow avalanche is a spark causing a\nforest fire. In nuclear physics, a single stray neutron can result in an prompt\ncritical event, which may be finally be energetic enough for a nuclear reactor\nmeltdown or (in a bomb) a nuclear explosion.\n",
