The label has\nreleased a variety of work in different genres, making it difficult to\npigeonhole as having any one artistic mission. Overall, though, the political\nsensibilities of the label can be said to be left-wing, feminist, and anti-war,\nand the label initially showed a commitment towards underground punk bands and\nto representing artists in the Olympia area music\nscene. [http://killrockstars.com/about/about.html About Kill Rock Stars]\n(Retrieved Mar. 1, 2004)\n\nMoon initially started the label because in his words, \"I just wanted to put out\nmy friendsâ records because nobody was putting out my friendsâ records. And to\nput out spoken word 7\" records.\" [http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?pa-\nge=intrview/opar/intrview_Slim_Moon_Interview.html \"Interview With Slim Moon\"],\nHitQuarters, 13 April 2009. KRS-101 (the label's first release) was in\nfact a split 7\" spoken-word record with Kathleen Hanna and Slim Moon; other\n\"Wordcore\" releases followed. The first major release was a compilation of Olympia-\narea bands simply titled [[Kill Rock Stars (album)|Kill Rock Stars]] ([[Stars\nKill Rock]] and [[Rock Stars Kill]] would follow in the same compilation series)\nand featured Bikini Kill, Bratmobile, Unwound, Nirvana, The Melvins, as well as\nsinger-songwriter Elliott Smith.\n\nAlthough the label's music has never reflected just a single genre or\nunderground music movement, it is arguably most notable for releasing the work\nof various riot grrrl bands during the mid-'90s, some of which, especially the\naforementioned Bikini Kill, generated a good deal of press attention. Other KRS\nreleases in this genre includes albums by Bratmobile, Huggy Bear, Heavens to\nBetsy and Excuse 17. The label continued its tradition of spoken word by\nreleasing their first full-length spoken word LP Big Broad by Juliana Lueking in\n1995. This was also the year that Elliott Smith released his self-titled solo LP\non the label. Another milestone was the 1997 release of Sleater-Kinney's third\nLP (and first on KRS) [[Dig Me Out]], which garnered national press attention in\n[[Spin magazine|Spin]] and [[Rolling Stone]]\nmagazines. [http://killrockstars.com/about/timeline.php Kill Rock Stars\nTimeline] (Retrieved October 22, 2005)\n\nIn 1997/98, the 5RC label was formed as a sister label to Kill Rock Stars; it\nreleased generally harsher-sounding and more challenging indie rock than KRS.\nThe 5RC roster includes Xiu Xiu, Deerhoof, Need New Body, The Mae Shi, The Robot\nAte Me, and Metalux among others. 1998 also marked the first-ever Mailorder\nFreak Singles Club and featured Quasi, Small Stars, Sta-Prest and Rock-A-Teens\namong others. Another popular band on KRS was The Decemberists, who released\nthree full-length albums on the label between 2001 and 2005. Colin Meloy, singer\nfor The Decemberists, also released a solo album on the label in April 2008.\n\nOther notable releases by KRS include: albums by bands such as The Paper\nChase, Jeff Hanson, Unwound, Marnie Stern, Gossip, Mecca Normal, Two Ton Boa\nand Comet Gain; spoken word albums by Kathy Acker and Miranda July; and\nreissues of work by earlier punk/post-punk bands such as Kleenex/Liliput,\nEssential Logic, and Delta 5.\n\nIn October 2006 Slim Moon, the owner, announced he would be departing Kill Rock\nStars to work as an A&R representative at Nonesuch Records, a Warner Music Group\nsubsidiary.

October 6, 2006)\nSlim's wife Portia Sabin took over ownership of Kill Rock Stars and in 2007 the\nlabel released 11 records, including [[New Moon (Elliott Smith album)|New\nMoon]], a collection of songs recorded by Elliott Smith between 1994 and 1997.\n","linknr":179,"url":"Kill_Rock_Stars","recorded":1363370293,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Kill_Rock_Stars&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Kill_Rock_Stars&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:TONE","/wiki/Wikipedia:Guide_to_writing_better_articles","/wiki/File:Kill_Rock_Stars_logo.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/bb/Kill_Rock_Stars_logo.png/250px-Kill_Rock_Stars_logo.png","/wiki/Slim_Moon","/wiki/Redeye_Distribution","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/Portland,_Oregon","http://killrockstars.com/","/wiki/Independent_record_label","/wiki/Slim_Moon","/wiki/Olympia,_Washington","/wiki/Washington_(U.S._state)","/wiki/Portland,_Oregon","/wiki/Politics","/wiki/Left-wing","/wiki/Feminist","/wiki/Anti-war","/wiki/Punk_rock","/wiki/Music_of_Olympia","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Spoken_word","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Kathleen_Hanna","/wiki/Kill_Rock_Stars_(album)","/wiki/Stars_Kill_Rock","/wiki/Rock_Stars_Kill","/wiki/Bikini_Kill","/wiki/Bratmobile","/wiki/Unwound","/wiki/Nirvana_(band)","/wiki/The_Melvins","/wiki/Elliott_Smith","/wiki/Riot_grrrl","/wiki/Huggy_Bear_(band)","/wiki/Heavens_to_Betsy","/wiki/Excuse_17","/w/index.php?title=Big_Broad&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Juliana_Lueking","/wiki/Elliott_Smith","/wiki/Sleater-Kinney","/wiki/Dig_Me_Out","/wiki/Spin_magazine","/wiki/Rolling_Stone","#cite_note-3","/wiki/5RC","/wiki/Xiu_Xiu","/wiki/Deerhoof","/wiki/Need_New_Body","/wiki/The_Mae_Shi","/wiki/The_Robot_Ate_Me","/wiki/Metalux","/wiki/Quasi","/w/index.php?title=Small_Stars&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Sta-Prest_(band)","/wiki/Rock-A-Teens","/wiki/The_Decemberists","/wiki/Colin_Meloy","/wiki/The_Decemberists","/wiki/Colin_Meloy_Sings_Live!","/wiki/The_Paper_Chase_(band)","/wiki/Jeff_Hanson","/wiki/Marnie_Stern","/wiki/The_Gossip","/wiki/Mecca_Normal","/w/index.php?title=Two_Ton_Boa&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Comet_Gain","/wiki/Kathy_Acker","/wiki/Miranda_July","/wiki/Kleenex/Liliput","/wiki/Essential_Logic","/wiki/Delta_5","/wiki/Nonesuch_Records","/wiki/Warner_Music_Group","#cite_note-4","/wiki/New_Moon_(Elliott_Smith_album)","/wiki/Elliott_Smith","/w/index.php?title=Kill_Rock_Stars&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/List_of_record_labels","/wiki/List_of_Kill_Rock_Stars_artists","/w/index.php?title=Kill_Rock_Stars&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-1","http://killrockstars.com/about/about.html","#cite_ref-2","http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_Slim_Moon_Interview.html","#cite_ref-3","http://killrockstars.com/about/timeline.php","#cite_ref-4","http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/news/38909/Kill_Rock_Stars_Slim_Moon_Leaves_KRS_for_Nonesuch","/w/index.php?title=Kill_Rock_Stars&action=edit&section=3","http://killrockstars.com/","http://podcast.krs5rc.com/","http://www.pluginmusic.com/features/label.php?page=killrockstars","http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_Slim_Moon_Interview.html","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kill_Rock_Stars&oldid=540490291","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Record_labels_established_in_1991","/wiki/Category:Kill_Rock_Stars","/wiki/Category:Alternative_rock_record_labels","/wiki/Category:American_independent_record_labels","/wiki/Category:Riot_grrrl","/wiki/Category:Oregon_record_labels","/wiki/Category:Companies_based_in_Washington_(state)","/wiki/Category:Privately_held_companies_based_in_Oregon","/wiki/Category:Companies_based_in_Portland,_Oregon","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_needing_style_editing_from_December_2010","/wiki/Category:All_articles_needing_style_editing","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Kill+Rock+Stars&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Kill+Rock+Stars","/wiki/Kill_Rock_Stars","/wiki/Talk:Kill_Rock_Stars","#","/wiki/Kill_Rock_Stars","/w/index.php?title=Kill_Rock_Stars&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Kill_Rock_Stars&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:R
