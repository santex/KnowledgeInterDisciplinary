{"cursor":"36941","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Rounding' a numerical value means replacing it by another value that is\napproximately equal but has a shorter, simpler, or more explicit representation;\nfor example, replacing Â£23.4476 with Â£23.45, or the fraction 312/937 with 1/3,\nor the expression â2 with 1.414.\n\nRounding is often done on purpose to obtain a value that is easier to write and\nhandle than the original. It may be done also to indicate the accuracy of a\ncomputed number; for example, a quantity that was computed as 123,456 but is\nknown to be accurate only to within a few hundred units is better stated as\n\"about 123,500.\"\n\nOn the other hand, rounding introduces some round-off error in the result.\nRounding is almost unavoidable in many computations â especially when dividing\ntwo numbers in integer or fixed-point arithmetic; when computing mathematical\nfunctions such as square roots, logarithms, and sines; or when using a floating\npoint representation with a fixed number of significant digits. In a sequence of\ncalculations, these rounding errors generally accumulate, and in certain ill-\nconditioned cases they may make the result meaningless.\n\nAccurate rounding of transcendental mathematical functions is difficult because\nthe number of extra digits that need to be calculated to resolve whether to\nround up or down cannot be known in advance. This problem is known as \"the table-\nmaker's dilemma\".\n\nRounding has many similarities to the quantization that occurs when physical\nquantities must be encoded by numbers or digital signals.\n","linknr":356,"url":"Rounding","recorded":1362374611,"links":44,"instances":["programming_language","programming","computing","signal_processing","mathematics","computing","mathematics"],"pdf":["http://mscweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/543web/files/GSFC-X-673-64-1F.pdf","http://www.kennethkuhn.com/students/ee431/text/voltage_regulators_zeners.pdf","http://www.open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/JSG/docs/m3/docs/jsgn326.pdf","http://www.open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/JSG/docs/m3/docs/jsgn326.pdf","http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/publications/publication1224_en.pdf","http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/ECMA-262.pdf"],"categories":["Arithmetic"],"headings":["Types of rounding","Rounding to a specified increment","Rounding to integer","Tie-breaking","Dithering and error diffusion","Rounding to simple fractions","Scaled rounding","Round to available value","Floating-point rounding","Double rounding","Exact computation with rounded arithmetic","The table-maker's dilemma","History","Rounding functions in programming languages","Other rounding standards","See also","External links","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/3/a/c/3ac48b92d0581b94ac65dc25c5572cef.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/f/1/7f1eb5a3e67c0f2a1af7615441ff31e4.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/5/2/75274eba6cb765beaeaf4cb72a931942.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/2/7/8/2780e17a2ae96496ef383c7f691fe653.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/a/1/0/a101e1b5e24e74958a349d78d0884b77.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/d/6/4d6d988833eccdb7e561a22240e5e8ef.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/d/7/3/d7379bbdcd27e09dbe8ff4480f299e99.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/4/2/e4285e294af127b52e55dbee175238d1.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/1/6/1/161c650bed8c5ce55684ef2803367f5e.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["quantization","signal_processing"],["power","mathematics"],["expectation","mathematics"],["c","programming_language"],["integer","computing"],["variable","programming"],["library","computing"]],"members":["c","variable","integer","quantization","power","library","expectation"],"related":["Round-off_error","Integer","Fixed-point_arithmetic","Square_root","Logarithm","Sine","Floating_point","Ill-conditioned","Transcendental_function","Quantization_(signal_processing)","Physical_quantity","Digital_signal","Pi","Rational_number","Decimal_number","Integer","Significant_figure","Number_system","Decimal_number","Power_(mathematics)","Binary_number","Extended_real_number_line","Stock_index","Vancouver_Stock_Exchange","Stock_price","Random","Expectation_(mathematics)","IEEE_754","Dithering","Error_diffusion","Pulse-width_modulation","Floyd–Steinberg_dithering","Farey_sequence","Stern-Brocot_tree","Continued_fraction","Preferred_number","Lumber","Preferred_value","Preferred_value","IEEE_754-2008","X87","Strictfp","William_Kahan","Transcendental_function","Transcendental_function","Unit_in_the_last_place","Theorem","IEEE_floating_point_standard","Gelfond–Schneider_theorem","Lindemann–Weierstrass_theorem","Transcendental_number","MPFR","IBM","Sun_Microsystems","ENS_Lyon","Computable_number","Halting_problem","Goldbach's_conjecture","Unprovable","Clay_tablet","Mesopotamia","Multiplicative_inverse","Pi","ASTM","Robert_Simpson_Woodward","Human_computer","Churchill_Eisenhart","Interval_arithmetic","Programming_language","FORTRAN","C_(programming_language)","Integer_(computing)","Variable_(programming)","Array_data_type","Library_(computing)","Double_precision_floating-point_format","Arithmetic_overflow","PHP","Printf","Cascading_Style_Sheets","Scalable_Vector_Graphics","Document_Object_Model","Interface_description_language","Javascript","ECMAScript","United_States","Office_of_the_Federal_Coordinator_for_Meteorology","Meteorology","Celsius","False_precision","Gal's_accurate_tables","Interval_arithmetic","Kahan_summation_algorithm","Nearest_integer_function","Round-off_error","Significant_figures","Truncation","Signed_zero","Signed-digit_representation","Swedish_rounding"]}
