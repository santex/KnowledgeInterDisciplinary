Formed in the\nmid-1980s in Brisbane by main songwriter guitarist and vocalist David Smith, he\nwas soon joined by keyboardists Brett Mitchell and Carol Rohde and somewhat\nlater by drummer-percussionist Crispin Trist. They initially released several\ncassette-only releases including the album P.C.M.. Boxcar's early material\nsounded similar to contemporaries such as Cabaret Voltaire and Severed Heads.\nBoxcar were also notable for playing many live shows in the Brisbane area and\naround the country, including shows where they performed wearing gas masks.\nPerforming electronic music live was a difficult feat given the preference in\nAustralian live venues for guitar-driven pub rock and they would sometimes be\njeered by members of the crowd.\n\nThey rose to prominence after releasing the single \"Freemason (You Broke The\nPromise)\" in 1988 after signing with Volition Records, and hit number 8 in the\nUnited States [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] dance music chart. Initially\ncriticised in the local press for being derivative of New Order they\nnevertheless built a local following, despite a lack of commercial radio\nairplay for electronic music. \"Freemason\" was soon followed by the singles\n\"Insect\" (remixed by noted producer Arthur Baker) and \"Gas Stop (Who Do You\nThink You Are?)\" (remixed by Francois Kevorkian) (both of which also charted in\nthe US but had little local impact - \"Gas Stop\" peaked at No. 82 on the ARIA\nsingles chart) and by their formal debut album [[Vertigo (Boxcar\nalbum)|Vertigo]] on Volition in 1990.\n\nVertigo was well received by critics who noted the production was considerably\nmore sophisticated than most electronic music produced in Australia to that\npoint, due in large part to producer Robert Racic, who had also worked with\nSevered Heads and other Volition artists such as Single Gun Theory. Overall,\nVertigo had a fairly pop feel, however the band also included more experimental\ninstrumentals on the album such as \"Comet\" (also on the B-side of the\n\"Freemason\" single) and \"Lelore\" (featuring an eerie wailing as the centrepiece\n\"vocal\", it was released as a single in its own right). A round of live dates\nand tours followed including supports for New Order, Depeche Mode, Erasure and\nPet Shop Boys.\n\nSoon after the release of Vertigo, Rohde and Trist left Boxcar and the band\nrelocated from Brisbane to Sydney and added keyboardist Stewart Lawler. A remix\nalbum [[Revision (Boxcar album)|Revision]] with reworkings of Vertigo tracks by\nvarious local producers, including Tom Ellard from Severed Heads, was released\nin 1992, but it was another two years until the follow-up album [[Algorhythm]]\nwas released in Australia in 1994.\n\nAlgorhythm was a notably more trance and house-influenced effort than the synth-\npop of Vertigo and spawned the singles \"Universal Hymn\", \"What Are You So Happy\nAbout?\" (featured on the soundtrack to the 1996 film [[Love and Other\nCatastrophes]]) and \"People Get High\". The album took almost another two full\nyears until it was released in the United Kingdom and Europe in 1996 on Pulse-8.\nAlthough not officially defunct, it was around about 1997 that Boxcar started to\nplay fewer live dates.\n\nIn October 2007, [http://www.boxcar.com.au/rewired.html an announcement] was\nmade of their return gig participating in the [http://www.trans.com.au/upgrade/\nUpgrade] night at QUT. There is also a new track on their website, named for the\ninfamous Atari ST game, Llamatron. It is also indicated that Brett Mitchell is\nno longer a member of the band.\n","linknr":139,"url":"Revision_(Boxcar_album)","recorded":1374858977,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Boxcar_(band)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Boxcar_(band)&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","/wiki/Boxcar_(band)","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","/w/index.php?title=Revision_(Boxcar_album)&redirect=no","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability","/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research#Primary.2C_secondary_and_tertiary_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research#Primary.2C_secondary_and_tertiary_sources","/wiki/Brisbane","/wiki/Australia","/wiki/Music_genre","/wiki/Synthpop","/wiki/Techno_music","/wiki/House_music","/wiki/Electronica","/wiki/Record_label","/wiki/Volition_Records","/wiki/Nettwerk_Records","/wiki/North_America","/wiki/Arista_Records","http://www.boxcar.com.au","/wiki/Australia","/wiki/Sydney","/wiki/Synth_pop","/wiki/Techno_music","/wiki/Brisbane","/wiki/Cabaret_Voltaire_(band)","/wiki/Severed_Heads","/wiki/Gas_mask","/wiki/Pub_rock_(Australia)","/wiki/Volition_Records","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/Billboard_(magazine)","/wiki/New_Order","/wiki/Arthur_Baker_(musician)","/wiki/Francois_Kevorkian","/wiki/Vertigo_(Boxcar_album)","/wiki/Robert_Racic","/wiki/Severed_Heads","/wiki/Single_Gun_Theory","/wiki/B-side","/wiki/Depeche_Mode","/wiki/Erasure","/wiki/Pet_Shop_Boys","/wiki/Remix_album","/wiki/Revision_(Boxcar_album)","/wiki/Tom_Ellard","/wiki/Algorhythm","/wiki/Trance_music","/wiki/House_music","/wiki/Soundtrack","/wiki/Love_and_Other_Catastrophes","/wiki/United_Kingdom","/wiki/Europe","http://www.boxcar.com.au/rewired.html","http://www.trans.com.au/upgrade/","/wiki/Queensland_University_of_Technology","/wiki/Atari_ST","/wiki/Llamatron","/w/index.php?title=Boxcar_(band)&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Vertigo_(Boxcar_album)","/wiki/Revision_(Boxcar_album)","/wiki/Algorhythm","/w/index.php?title=Boxcar_(band)&action=edit&section=2","http://www.nettwerk.com/artistpage.jsp?artist_id=109&mode=bio","http://www.discogs.com/artist/Boxcar","/wiki/Discogs","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Boxcar_(band)&oldid=504853069","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Australian_electronic_music_groups","/wiki/Category:Queensland_musical_groups","/wiki/Category:Synthpop_groups","/wiki/Category:Articles_lacking_reliable_references_from_February_2008","/wiki/Category:All_articles_lacking_reliable_references","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_hCards","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Boxcar+%28band%29&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Boxcar+%28band%29","/wiki/Boxcar_(band)","/wiki/Talk:Boxcar_(band)","#","/wiki/Boxcar_(band)","/w/index.php?title=Boxcar_(band)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Boxcar_(band)&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Boxcar_(band)","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Boxcar_(band)","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Boxcar_(band)&oldid=504853069","/w/index.php?title=Boxcar_(band)&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4951639","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Boxcar_%28band%29&id=504853069","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Boxcar+%28band%29","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Boxcar+%28band%29&oldid=504853069&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Boxcar_(band)&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4951639#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//crea
