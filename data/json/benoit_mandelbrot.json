He later created the Mandelbrot set of intricate, never-ending\nfractal shapes, named in his honor.<ref></ref>\n\nAs a child, his family fled to France in 1936 to escape the growing Nazi\npersecution of Jews. After World War II ended in 1945, Mandelbrot studied\nmathematics, graduating from universities in Paris and the U.S., receiving a\nmasters degree in aeronautics from Caltech. He spent most of his career in both\nthe U.S. and France, having dual French and American citizenship. In 1958 he\nbegan working for IBM, where he stayed for 35 years and was an IBM Fellow.\n\nBecause of his access to IBM's computers, Mandelbrot was one of the first to use\ncomputer graphics to create and display fractal geometric images, leading to his\ndiscovering the Mandelbrot set in 1979. In so doing, he was able to show how\nvisual complexity can be created from simple rules. He said that things\ntypically considered to be \"rough\", a \"mess\" or \"chaotic\", like clouds or\nshorelines, actually had a \"degree of order\".<ref name=Wolfram/> His research\ncareer included contributions to fields including geology, medicine, cosmology,\nengineering and the social sciences. Science writer Arthur C. Clarke credits the\nMandelbrot set as being \"one of the most astonishing discoveries in the entire\nhistory of mathematics\".<ref name=Clarke/>\n\nToward the end of his career, he was Sterling Professor of Mathematical Sciences\nat Yale University, where he was the oldest professor in Yale's history to\nreceive tenure.<ref></ref> Mandelbrot also held positions at the Pacific\nNorthwest National Laboratory, Université Lille Nord de France, Institute for\nAdvanced Study and Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique. During his\ncareer, he received over 15 honorary doctorates and served on many science\njournals, along with winning numerous awards. His autobiography, The Fractalist,\nwas published in 2012.\n",
