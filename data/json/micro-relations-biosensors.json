{"cursor":"41648","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'biosensor' is an analytical device, used for the detection of an analyte,\nthat combines a biological component with a physicochemical detector.\n* the sensitive biological element (e.g. tissue, microorganisms, organelles,\n  cell receptors, enzymes, antibodies, nucleic acids, etc.), a biologically\n  derived material or biomimetic component that interacts (binds or recognizes)\n  the analyte under study. The biologically sensitive elements can also be\n  created by biological engineering.\n* the transducer or the detector element (works in a physicochemical way;\n  optical, piezoelectric, electrochemical, etc.) that transforms the signal\n  resulting from the interaction of the analyte with the biological element into\n  another signal (i.e., transduces) that can be more easily measured and\n  quantified;\n* biosensor reader device with the associated electronics or signal processors\n  that are primarily responsible for the display of the results in a user-\n  friendly way. This sometimes accounts for the most expensive part\n  of the sensor device, however it is possible to generate a user friendly\n  display that includes transducer and sensitive element(see Holographic\n  Sensor). The readers are usually custom-designed and manufactured to suit\n  the different working principles of biosensors. Known manufacturers of\n  biosensor electronic readers include PalmSens, Gwent Biotechnology Systems\n  and Rapid Labs.\n\nA common example of a commercial biosensor is the blood glucose biosensor, which\nuses the enzyme glucose oxidase to break blood glucose down. In doing so it\nfirst oxidizes glucose and uses two electrons to reduce the FAD (a component of\nthe enzyme) to FADH2. This in turn is oxidized by the electrode (accepting two\nelectrons from the electrode) in a number of steps. The resulting current is a\nmeasure of the concentration of glucose. In this case, the electrode is the\ntransducer and the enzyme is the biologically active component.\n\nRecently, arrays of many different detector molecules have been applied in so\ncalled electronic nose devices, where the pattern of response from the detectors\nis used to fingerprint a substance.  . In the Wasp Hound odor-detector, the mechanical element is a\nvideo camera and the biological element is five parasitic wasps who have been\nconditioned to swarm in response to the presence of a specific chemical. Current commercial electronic noses, however, do not use\nbiological elements.\n\nA canary in a cage, as used by miners to warn of gas, could be considered a\nbiosensor. Many of today's biosensor applications are similar, in that they use\norganisms which respond to toxic substances at a much lower concentrations than\nhumans can detect to warn of their presence. Such devices can be used in\nenvironmental monitoring, trace gas detection and in water treatment facilities.\n\nMany optical biosensors are based on the phenomenon of surface plasmon resonance\n(SPR) techniques. This utilises a property of and other materials; specifically\nthat a thin layer of gold on a high refractive index glass surface can absorb\nlaser light, producing electron waves (surface plasmons) on the gold surface.\nThis occurs only at a specific angle and wavelength of incident light and is\nhighly dependent on the surface of the gold, such that binding of a target\nanalyte to a receptor on the gold surface produces a measurable signal.\n\nSurface plasmon resonance sensors operate using a sensor chip consisting of a\nplastic cassette supporting a glass plate, one side of which is coated with a\nmicroscopic layer of gold. This side contacts the optical detection apparatus of\nthe instrument. The opposite side is then contacted with a microfluidic flow\nsystem. The contact with the flow system creates channels across which reagents\ncan be passed in solution. This side of the glass sensor chip can be modified in\na number of ways, to allow easy attachment of molecules of interest. Normally it\nis coated in carboxymethyl dextran or similar compound.\n\nLight of a fixed wavelength is reflected off the gold side of the chip at the\nangle of total internal reflection, and detected inside the instrument. The\nangle of incident light is varied in order to match he evanescent wave\npropagation rate with the propagation rate of the surface plasmon\nplaritons. This induces the evanescent wave to penetrate through the\nglass plate and some distance into the liquid flowing over the surface.\n\nThe refractive index at the flow side of the chip surface has a direct influence\non the behaviour of the light reflected off the gold side. Binding to the flow\nside of the chip has an effect on the refractive index and in this way\nbiological interactions can be measured to a high degree of sensitivity with\nsome sort of energy. The refractive index of the medium near the surface changes\nwhen biomolecules attach to the surface, and the SPR angle varies as a function\nof this change.\n\nOther evanescent wave biosensors have been commercialised using waveguides where\nthe propagation constant through the waveguide is changed by the absorption of\nmolecules to the waveguide surface. One such example, Dual Polarisation\nInterferometry uses a buried waveguide as a reference against which the change\nin propagation constant is measured. Other configurations such as the Mach-\nZehnder have reference arms lithographically defined on a substrate. Higher\nlevels of integration can be achieved using resonator geometries where the\nresonant frequency of a ring resonator changes when molecules are\nabsorbed. M. Iqbal, M. A. Gleeson, B. Spaugh, F. Tybor, W. G. Gunn, M.\nHochberg, T. Baehr-Jones, R. C. Bailey, L. C. Gunn, \"Label-Free Biosensor Arrays\nBased on Silicon Ring Resonators and High-Speed Optical Scanning\nInstrumentation\", IEEE J. Sel. Top. Quant. Elec. 16, 654-661\n(2010)\n\nOther optical biosensors are mainly based on changes in absorbance or\nfluorescence of an appropriate indicator compound and do not need a total\ninternal reflection geometry. For example, a fully operational prototype device\ndetecting casein in milk has been fabricated. The device is based on detecting\nchanges in absorption of a gold layer. H. M. Hiep et al. \"A localized\nsurface plasmon resonance based immunosensor for the detection of casein in\nmilk\" Sci. Technol. Adv. Mater. 8 (2007) 331\n[http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.stam.2006.12.010 free download] A widely used\nresearch tool, the micro-array, can also be considered a biosensor.\n\nNanobiosensors use an immobilized bioreceptor probe that is selective for target\nanalyte molecules. Nanomaterials are exquisitely sensitive chemical and\nbiological sensors. Nanoscale materials demonstrate unique properties. Their\nlarge surface area to volume ratio can achieve rapid and low cost reactions,\nusing a variety of designs. Gerald A Urban 2009 Meas. Sci. Technol. 20\n012001 \n\nBiological biosensors often incorporate a genetically modified form of a native\nprotein or enzyme. The protein is configured to detect a specific analyte and\nthe ensuing signal is read by a detection instrument such as a fluorometer or\nluminometer. An example of a recently developed biosensor is one for detecting\ncytosolic concentration of the analyte cAMP (cyclic adenosine monophosphate), a\nsecond messenger involved in cellular signaling triggered by ligands interacting\nwith receptors on the cell membrane. Fan, F. et al. (2008) Novel Genetically\nEncoded Biosensors Using Firefly Luciferase. ACS Chem. Biol. 3, 346â51.\n[http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/cb8000414 free download] Similar\nsystems have been created to study cellular responses to native ligands or\nxenobiotics (toxins or small molecule inhibitors). Such \"assays\" are commonly\nused in drug discovery development by pharmaceutical and biotechnology\ncompanies. Most cAMP assays in current use require lysis of the cells prior to\nmeasurement of cAMP. A live-cell biosensor for cAMP can be used in non-lysed\ncells with the additional advantage of multiple reads to study the kinetics of\nreceptor response.\n","linknr":357,"url":"biosensors","recorded":1362506488,"links":38,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.mdpi.org/sensors/papers/s8052932.pdf","http://www.mdpi.org/sensors/papers/s8052932.pdf","http://nzbio2012.co.nz/content/nzbio2012/images/3_Biosensor_Development_for_Detecting_Lactose_in_Dairy_Wastewater__Neil_Pasco.pdf"],"categories":["Biotechnology","Sensors","Forensic equipment"],"headings":["The Biosensor System","Bioreceptors","Surface attachment of the biological elements","Biotransducer","Placement of Biosensors","Applications","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ec/Biosensor_System.jpg/220px-Biosensor_System.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/41/Biosensors_based_on_biotransducers.png/220px-Biosensors_based_on_biotransducers.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Wiki_ics-a.jpg/130px-Wiki_ics-a.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/Wiki_ics-b.jpg/130px-Wiki_ics-b.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Analyte","Enzyme","Antibody","Nucleic_acid","Biological_engineering","Holographic_Sensor","Blood_glucose","Glucose_oxidase","Electronic_nose","Wasp_Hound","Toxic","Surface_plasmon_resonance","Carboxymethyl_dextran","Dual_Polarisation_Interferometry","Mach-Zehnder","Cytosol","Antibodies","Enzyme","Base_pair","DNA","Hybridization_probe","Surface_engineering","Layer_by_layer","Hydrogel","Xerogel","Sol-gel","Tetramethyl_orthosilicate","Tetraethyl_orthosilicate","Polyethylene_glycol","Acrylate_polymer","Radical_initiator","Peroxide","Ammonium_persulfate","Tetramethylethylenediamine","Polyacrylamide_gel","Protein_electrophoresis","2,2-dimethoxy-2-phenylacetophenone","Biotransducer","Electrode","Reference_electrode","Model_lipid_bilayer","Piezoelectric","Quartz_crystal_microbalance","Pesticides","Bacterium","Bioremediation","Organophosphate","Folic_acid","Biotin","Vitamin_B12","Pantothenic_acid","Microbiological_assay","Drug_residue","Antibiotics","Growth_promoters","Mycotoxin","Blood_glucose_monitoring","Glucose_oxidase","Fluorescent_glucose_biosensors","Water-soluble_vitamins","Drug_residues","Sulfonamides","Beta-agonists","Surface_plasmon_resonance","ELISA","Ars_operon","Bioactive_paper","DNA_field-effect_transistor","Surface_plasmon_resonance","Plasmon","Dual_Polarisation_Interferometry","Biointerface","Electrochemiluminescence","Royal_Society_of_Chemistry"]}
