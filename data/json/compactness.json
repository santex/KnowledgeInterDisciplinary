There are several different notions of compactness, noted\nbelow, that are equivalent in good cases. The version just described is known as\nsequential compactness. The Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem gives an equivalent\ncondition for sequential compactness when considering subsets of Euclidean\nspace: a set then is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded. Examples\ninclude a closed interval or a rectangle. Thus if one chooses an infinite number\nof points in the 'closed' unit interval, some of those points must get\narbitrarily close to some real number in that space. For instance, some of the\nnumbers get arbitrarily close to 0. (Also, some get arbitrarily close to 1.)\nNote that the same set of points would not have, as an accumulation point, any\npoint of the 'open' unit interval; hence that space cannot be compact. Euclidean\nspace itself is not compact since it is not bounded. In particular, one could\nchoose the sequence of points , of which no sub-sequence ultimately gets\narbitrarily close to any given real number.\n\nApart from closed and bounded subsets of Euclidean space, typical examples of\ncompact spaces include spaces consisting not of geometrical points but of\nfunctions. The term compact was introduced into mathematics by Maurice Fréchet\nin 1906 as a distillation of this concept. Compactness in this more general\nsituation plays an extremely important role in mathematical analysis, because\nmany classical and important theorems of 19th century analysis, such as the\nextreme value theorem, are easily generalized to this situation. A typical\napplication is furnished by the Arzelà–Ascoli theorem and in particular the\nPeano existence theorem, in which one is able to conclude the existence of a\nfunction with some required properties as a limiting case of some more\nelementary construction.\n\nVarious equivalent notions of compactness, including sequential compactness and\nlimit point compactness, can be developed in general metric spaces. In general\ntopological spaces, however, the different notions of compactness are not\nnecessarily equivalent, and the most useful notion, introduced by Pavel\nAlexandrov and Pavel Urysohn in 1929, involves the existence of certain finite\nfamilies of open sets that \"cover\" the space in the sense that each point of the\nspace must lie in some set contained in the family. This more subtle definition\nexhibits compact spaces as generalizations of finite sets. In spaces that are\ncompact in this latter sense, it is often possible to patch together information\nthat holds locally&mdash;that is, in a neighborhood of each point&mdash;into\ncorresponding statements that hold throughout the space, and many theorems are\nof this character.\n","title":"Compact%20space","headings":["Introduction","Definition","Historical development","Examples","Theorems","Other forms of compactness","See also","Notes","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["5: Topological_space","4: Bounded_set","4: Metric_space","4: Limit_point","4: HeineâBorel_theorem","3: Sequential_compactness","3: Euclidean_space","3: Closed_set","3: Unit_interval","3: Extreme_value_theorem","3: ArzelÃ âAscoli_theorem","3: Limit_point_compact","3: Finite_set","3: Local_property","3: Continuous_function","3: Open_cover","3: Hausdorff_space","3: Locally_compact","3: Sequence","3: Totally_bounded","3: Uniform_space","2: BolzanoâWeierstrass_theorem","2: Accumulation_point","2: Pavel_Alexandrov","2: Pavel_Urysohn","2: Open_set","2: Real_number","2: Order_topology","2: Uniformly_continuous","2: Subcover","2: Uniform_convergence","2: LindelÃ¶f_space","2: Banach_space","2: Profinite_group","2: Proper_map","2: Axiom_of_choice","2: Pseudocompact_space","1: Mathematics","1: General_topology","1: Metric_topology","1: Infinite_sequence","1: Closed_interval","1: Rectangle","1: Function_space","1: Maurice_FrÃ©chet","1: Mathematical_analysis","1: Peano_existence_theorem","1: Ordered_set","1: Calculus","1: Subsequence","1: Algebraic_geometry","1: Nicolas_Bourbaki","1: Hausdorff_spaces","1: Induced_topology","1: Bernard_Bolzano","1: Method_of_bisection","1: Karl_Weierstrass","1: Function_spaces","1: Giulio_Ascoli","1: Cesare_ArzelÃ ","1: Integral_equation","1: David_Hilbert","1: Erhard_Schmidt","1: Green's_function","1: Mean_convergence","1: Hilbert_space","1: Compact_operator","1: Maurice_RenÃ©_FrÃ©chet","1: Linear_continuum","1: Eduard_Heine","1: Ãmile_Borel","1: Pierre_Cousin","1: Henri_Lebesgue","1: Lebesgue_integral","1: Point-set_topology","1: Separated_sets","1: Infinity","1: Singleton_set","1: Separation_axiom","1: Finite_topological_space","1: Empty_set","1: Finite_topology","1: Trivial_topology","1: Cofinite_topology","1: Alexandroff_one-point_compactification","1: Right_order_topology","1: Left_order_topology","1: Totally_ordered_set","1: Sierpinski_space","1: Lower_limit_topology","1: Cocountable_topology","1: Compact_group","1: Orthogonal_group","1: General_linear_group","1: Natural_number","1: Sphere","1: Normed_vector_space","1: Closed_unit_ball","1: Alaoglu's_theorem","1: Cantor_set","1: P-adic_numbers","1: Homeomorphic","1: Topology_of_pointwise_convergence","1: Tychonoff_theorem","1: Lipschitz_condition","1: Spectrum_of_an_operator","1: Bounded_linear_operator","1: Complex_number","1: Sequence_spaces#âp_spaces","1: Spectrum_of_a_ring","1: Commutative_ring","1: Zariski_topology","1: Spectrum_of_a_boolean_algebra","1: Stone_representation_theorem","1: Stone_space","1: Totally_disconnected_space","1: Structure_space","1: Banach_algebra","1: Hilbert_cube","1: Glossary_of_topology","1: Product_topology","1: Tychonoff's_theorem","1: Dense_topological_subspace","1: Total_order","1: Complete_lattice","1: Alexander's_sub-base_theorem","1: Finite_intersection_property","1: Mathematical_filter","1: Ultrafilter","1: Complete_accumulation_point","1: Subset","1: Limit_of_a_sequence","1: Real_line","1: Discrete_topology","1: Lebesgue's_number_lemma","1: Separable_space","1: First-countable","1: Sequentially_compact","1: Normal_space","1: Mathematical_ring","1: Ring_homomorphism","1: GelfandâNaimark_theorem","1: Continuous_functions_on_a_compact_Hausdorff_space","1: Closed_map","1: Bijective","1: Homeomorphism","1: Tychonoff_space","1: Maximal_ideal","1: Residue_field","1: First_isomorphism_theorem","1: Completely_regular_space","1: Non-archimedean_field","1: Hyperreal_field","1: Non-standard_analysis","1: Infinitesimal","1: Metric_spaces","1: Sequentially_compact_space","1: Countably_compact_space","1: First_uncountable_ordinal","1: Relatively_compact","1: Locally_compact_space","1: H-closed_space","1: H-set","1: Compactly_generated_space","1: Exhaustion_by_compact_sets","1: Metacompact_space","1: Noetherian_space","1: Orthocompact_space","1: Paracompact_space"]}
