Biomass is any organic material which has stored sunlight in\nthe form of chemical energy. As a fuel it may include wood, wood waste, straw,\nmanure, sugarcane, and many other byproducts from a variety of agricultural\nprocesses. By 2010, there was 35GW of globally installed bioenergy capacity for\nelectricity generation, of which 7GW was in the United States. Frauke Urban and Tom Mitchell 2011.

London: Overseas Development Institute and Institute of Development\nStudies\n\nIn its most narrow sense it is a synonym to biofuel, which is fuel derived from\nbiological sources. In its broader sense it includes biomass, the biological\nmaterial used as a biofuel, as well as the social, economic, scientific and\ntechnical fields associated with using biological sources for energy. This is a\ncommon misconception, as bioenergy is the energy extracted from the biomass, as\nthe biomass is the fuel and the bioenergy is the energy contained in the\nfuel.\n\nThere is a slight tendency for the word bioenergy to be favoured in Europe\ncompared with biofuel in North America.\n","linknr":419,"url":"Bioenergy","recorded":1362510202,"links":51,"instances":["state"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Bioenergy|","Biofuels"],"headings":["Solid biomass","Electricity generation from biomass","Environmental impact—","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/STM_Stirling_Generator_set.jpg/200px-STM_Stirling_Generator_set.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d0/Montana_16_bg_062406.jpg/200px-Montana_16_bg_062406.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/57/Canaviais_Sao_Paulo_01_2008_06.jpg/200px-Canaviais_Sao_Paulo_01_2008_06.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/16/Panorama_Usina_Costa_Pinto_Piracicaba_SAO_10_2008.jpg/200px-Panorama_Usina_Costa_Pinto_Piracicaba_SAO_10_2008.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ad/Wind-turbine-icon.svg/28px-Wind-turbine-icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Sugarcane_field.jpg/120px-Sugarcane_field.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["são_paulo","state"]],"members":["são_paulo"],"related":["Renewable_energy","Wood","Straw","Manure","Sugarcane","United_States","Overseas_Development_Institute","Institute_of_Development_Studies","Biofuel","Biomass","Organism","Carbon_cycle","Natural_resource","Petroleum","Coal","Nuclear_reactor","Animal_waste","Pollutant","Biofuel","Maize","Soybeans","Willow","Switchgrass","Rapeseed","Wheat","Sugar_beet","Palm_oil","Miscanthus","Sorghum","Cassava","Jatropha","Hemp","Biodegradable","Anaerobic_digestion","Biogas","Gasification","Syngas","Biodegradable_waste","Climate_change","United_States","Mauritius","Southeast_Asia","UK","Ituverava","State_of_São_Paulo","São_Paulo_(state)","Bagasse","Sugarcane","Angra_Nuclear_Power_Plant","Environmentally_friendly","State_of_São_Paulo","Cellulosic_ethanol","Greenpeace","Natural_Resources_Defense_Council","Biochar","Bioenergy_in_China","Biofuel","Biogas","Thylakoid","Jean_Pain","Idaho_National_Laboratory","Oak_Ridge_National_Laboratory","National_Wildlife_Federation","Rockefeller_Brothers_Fund","ACORE","Heinrich_Boell_Foundation","Worldwatch_Institute","Office_of_Energy_Efficiency_and_Renewable_Energy"]}
