Muscles\nare composed of tubular muscle cells (myocytes or myofibers). Muscle cells are\ncomposed of tubular myofibrils. Myofibrils are composed of repeating sections\nof sarcomeres, which appear under the microscope as dark and light bands.\nSarcomeres are composed of long, fibrous proteins that slide past each other\nwhen the muscles contract and relax.\n\nTwo of the important proteins are myosin, which forms the thick filament, and\nactin, which forms the thin filament. Myosin has a long, fibrous tail and a\nglobular head, which binds to actin. The myosin head also binds to ATP, which is\nthe source of energy for muscle movement. Myosin can only bind to actin when the\nbinding sites on actin are exposed by calcium ions.\n\nActin molecules are bound to the Z line, which forms the borders of the\nsarcomere. Other bands appear when the sarcomere is relaxed. {{cite book |author=Reece, Jane; Campbell, Neil |title=Biology\n|publisher=Benjamin Cummings |location=San Francisco |year=2002 |pages= |isbn=0-8053-6624-\n5 }}\n\nA muscle cell from a biceps may contain 100,000 sarcomeres. Assuming that\nthe length of biceps is 20 cm and the length of sarcomere is 2 micrometer, there\nare 100,000 sarcomeres along the length of biceps. The myofibrils of\nsmooth muscle cells are not arranged into sarcomeres.\n","linknr":276,"url":"Sarcomere","recorded":1362371337,"links":31,"instances":["physics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Cell anatomy","Cell movement","Muscular system"],"headings":["Bands","Contraction","Rest","Storage","Comparative sarcomere structure","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Sarcomere.gif/250px-Sarcomere.gif","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6e/Sarcomere.svg/300px-Sarcomere.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["force","physics"]],"members":["force"],"related":["Muscle","Myocytes","Myofibers","Myofibrils","Myosin","Actin","Adenosine_triphosphate","Benjamin_Cummings","Muscle_cell","Biceps","Smooth_muscle","Cardiac_muscle","German_language","Microscope","Microscope","Nebulin","Myomesin","Muscle_contraction","Tropomyosin","Sarcoplasmic_reticulum","Endoplasmic_reticulum","Sarcoplasm","Acetylcholine","Acetylcholine","Nicotinic_acetylcholine_receptor","Sodium","Action_potential","Adenosine_triphosphate","Adenosine_diphosphate","Phosphagen","Creatine_phosphate","Vertebrates","Force_(physics)","Arthropods"]}
