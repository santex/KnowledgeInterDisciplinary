These filters can also be created by\ncombining a low-pass filter with a high-pass filter.\n\nBandpass is an adjective that describes a type of filter or filtering process;\nit is to be distinguished from passband, which refers to the actual portion of\naffected spectrum. Hence, one might say \"A dual bandpass filter has two\npassbands.\" A bandpass signal is a signal containing a band of frequencies away\nfrom zero frequency, such as a signal that comes out of a bandpass filter.\n{{cite book\n | title = Introduction to digital signal processing and filter design author =\n | Belle A.

Additionally, the transition out of the passband would be\ninstantaneous in frequency. In practice, no bandpass filter is ideal. The filter\ndoes not attenuate all frequencies outside the desired frequency range\ncompletely; in particular, there is a region just outside the intended passband\nwhere frequencies are attenuated, but not rejected. This is known as the filter\nroll-off, and it is usually expressed in dB of attenuation per octave or decade\nof frequency. Generally, the design of a filter seeks to make the roll-off as\nnarrow as possible, thus allowing the filter to perform as close as possible to\nits intended design. Often, this is achieved at the expense of pass-band or stop-\nband ripple.\n\nThe bandwidth of the filter is simply the difference between the upper and lower\ncutoff frequencies. The shape factor is the ratio of bandwidths measured using\ntwo different attenuation values to determine the cutoff frequency, e.g., a\nshape factor of 2:1 at 30/3 dB means the bandwidth measured between frequencies\nat 30 dB attenuation is twice that measured between frequencies at 3 dB\nattenuation.\n\nOutside of electronics and signal processing, one example of the use of band-\npass filters is in the atmospheric sciences. It is common to band-pass filter\nrecent meteorological data with a period range of, for example, 3 to 10 days, so\nthat only cyclones remain as fluctuations in the data fields.\n\nIn neuroscience, visual cortical simple cells were first shown by David Hubel\nand Torsten Wiesel to have response properties that resemble Gabor filters,\nwhich are band-pass.\n","linknr":196,"url":"Band-pass","recorded":1362481265,"links":36,"instances":["signal_processing","log_scale","electronics","signal_processing"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Linear filters","Synthesiser modules","Filter frequency response"],"headings":["Q-factor","References in popular culture","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/Bandwidth_2.svg/300px-Bandwidth_2.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Bandpass_Filter.svg/300px-Bandpass_Filter.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/KilroySchematic.svg/300px-KilroySchematic.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["filter","signal_processing"],["octave","electronics"],["decade","log_scale"],["bandwidth","signal_processing"]],"members":["bandwidth","decade","octave","filter"],"related":["Frequency","Attenuate","Optical_band-pass_filter","Analog_circuit","Filter_(signal_processing)","RLC_circuit","Resistor","Inductor","Capacitor","Electrical_network","Low-pass_filter","High-pass_filter","Passband","Roll-off","Decibel","Octave_(electronics)","Decade_(log_scale)","Bandwidth_(signal_processing)","Cutoff_frequency","Atmospheric_sciences","Periodic_function","Cyclone","Neuroscience","Visual_cortex","Simple_cell","David_Hubel","Torsten_Wiesel","Gabor_filter","Q-factor","Band-stop_filter","Thomas_Pynchon","Graffiti","Kilroy_was_here","Atomic_line_filter","Audio_crossover","Band-stop_filter","Bias_tee"]}
