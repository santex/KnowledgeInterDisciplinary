National\nHydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data.\n[http://viewer.nationalmap.gov/viewer/ The National Map], accessed April 26,\n2011 river in Georgia and North Carolina. It begins in Clay County, North\nCarolina, near Standing Indian Mountain in the Southern Nantahala Wilderness and\nflows south into Georgia, crossing the state line into Towns County. Mast, M.A., and Turk, J.T., 1999,\n[http://pubs.usgs.gov/circ/circ1173/circ1173a/chapter05.htm U.S. Geological\nSurvey Circular 1173-A, p.158] USGS.gov (accessed October 19, 2006) The\nriver then travels through Rabun County and ends in Habersham County. It cuts\nthrough the Tallulah Dome rock formation to form the Tallulah Gorge and its\nseveral waterfalls (collectively known as Tallulah Falls). The Tallulah River\nintersects with the Chattooga River to form the Tugaloo River at Lake Tugalo in\nHabersham County, which then joins South Carolina's Seneca River at Lake\nHartwell to create the Savannah River which flows southeastward into the\nAtlantic Ocean.\n\nFrom its headwaters to its confluence with the Tugaloo River, the Tallulah River\nis approximately long. The Tallulah River Basin drains approximately , as\nmeasured at the Tallulah Falls Hydroelectric Plant in Habersham County, Georgia,\nnear the lower end of the Tallulah\nGorge. [http://ga2.er.usgs.gov/LibAreportPDF/2004/Discharge/sp02181580.pdf\nTallulah River summary in 2004 Water Resources Data for Georgia] USGS.gov\n(accessed October 19, 2006) The lower part of the river includes a string\nof man-made lakes along the river created by hydroelectric dams operated by\nGeorgia Power. The first (and northernmost) lake in the series is Lake Burton,\nwhich is followed by Lake Seed, Lake Rabun, and Lake Tallulah Falls. From\nTallulah Falls Lake, the lower part of the river flows through the Tallulah\nGorge and now ends as an arm of Lake Tugalo, the other arm of the lake being\nformed by the Chattooga River. Starting at a point about downstream from the dam\nfor Tallulah Falls Lake, the boundary line between Habersham and Rabun counties\nfollows the course of the Tallulah River to its end.\n\n\nThe upper Tallulah River Basin drains to the portion of the Tallulah River that\nis upstream from Lake Burton and includes northwestern Rabun County,\nnortheastern Towns County and part of Clay County, North Carolina. The United\nStates Geological Survey collects data for the upper Tallulah River Basin from\nits gauging station at the point where the river crosses Plum Orchard Road. [http://www.topoquest.com/map.asp?lat=34.89028&lon=-\n83.53056&datum=nad83&u=6&layer=DRG&size=l&s=50 TopoQuest map of gauging\nlocation] The upper Tallulah River Basin includes a section of the river\nthat is about 14.3 miles (23 km) long, draining a 56.5 square mile\n(146 kmÂ²) area. [http://ga2.er.usgs.gov/LibAreportPDF/-\n2004/Discharge/sp02178400.pdf Tallulah River summary in 2004 Water Resources\nData for Georgia] USGS.gov (accessed October 19, 2006) Annually, the area\nreceives at least 72 inches of rainfall and is entirely within the\nboundaries of the Chattahoochee National Forest, with about one third of the\nland falling in the Southern Nantahala Wilderness and about one fifth privately\nowned. The primary tributaries of the Tallulah River in Rabun\nCounty are Coleman River and Persimmon Creek. .]] The upper Tallulah River Basin\nis as scenic as it is rugged. The highest elevations are found in North Carolina\non Standing Indian Mountain, elevation 5,499 feet, where the Tallulah River\nheadwaters are located. After coming into Georgia and passing\nthrough the old mining and logging town of Tate City, Georgia in eastern Towns\nCounty, the river enters into to what some people call Tallulahâs upper gorge or\nthe Rock Mountain Gorge. [http://www.sherpaguides.com/georgia/m-\nountains/blue_ridge/eastern/tallulah_basin.html The Tallulah Basin] Sherpa\nGuides (accessed October 19, 2006) This upper \"gorge\" is far less dramatic\nthat the more famous Tallulah Gorge, but it starts just upstream from the\nriverâs confluence with Coleman River and runs nearly past Rock Mountain on the\nwestern side of the river. The scenic \"gorge\" is accessible via a drive along\nthe Tallulah River Road (Forest Service Road 70). The Tallulah River Road\nfollows an old railroad bed before ending in the Southern Nantahala\nWilderness and provides the only access to Tate City. Heavily\nwooded today, the upper Tallulah River Basin was stripped nearly bare by logging\nin the 1930s before the establishment of the Chattahoochee National Forest.\n\nBecause Georgians long have assumed that Tallulah was a Cherokee word, there is\nno agreement regarding the derivation of the name for the Tallulah River.\nTourism promoters in the late 19th century described the word Tallulah as\nmeaning \"thundering waters\" in Cherokee. Some scholars later theorized the that\ntallulah meant âterribleâ in Cherokee or was possibly derived from a number of\nother words, but it is more likely that there is no translation for the\nword. Krakow, K., 3rd Ed. (1999) [http://www.kenkrakow.com/gpn/t.pdf Georgia\nPlace-Names] (accessed October 19, 2006) It actually has no meaning in\nCherokee. The most likely source of the word is the Okonee (a branch of the\nCreek Indians) word talula, which means \"town\". The Okonee People occupied\nnortheastern Georgia and northwestern South Carolina for hundreds of years prior\nto the arrival of the Cherokees in the early 18th century.\n\nIn any event, there was a Cherokee Over-the-Hill settlement called Tallulah\nlocated on the upper portion of the river.
