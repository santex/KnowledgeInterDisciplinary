{"cursor":"4307","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Gilgai' is an Australian English word referring to a small, ephemeral lake\nformed from a depression in the soil surface. Gilgais are commonly a few metres\nacross and less than 30Â cm deep, however in some instances they may be\nseveral metres deep and up to 100 metres across. Gilgais are common and\nwidespread in Australia but also occur in isolated locations worldwide. Gilgais\nare also commonly called 'Melon holes' in Northern Australia. In the United\nStates these landforms were called 'hogwallows' in the 19th and early 20th\ncenturies.\n\nThere are various theories of the origin of gilgai. A popular theory is as\nfollows: Gilgais form on certain clay soils due to the swelling of the clay when\nwet and subsequent shrinkage upon drying. This action causes the soil to crack\nwhen dry and loose soil material then fills these cracks. When the soil swells\nupon subsequent re-wetting the soil pressure cannot be dispersed into the now-\nfull cracks and the soil is forced sideways causing a mound to form between\ncracks and a depression to form at the location of the crack. The process is\nthen further exaggerated by the depressions holding water and thus becoming\nwetter and swelling more than the mounds, causing even greater shrinkage and\ncracking. In addition, the cracks channel water deeply into the soil causing\neven greater swelling and subsequent cracking of the depression areas. Each\ncycle of swelling, shrinkage and cracking becomes more exaggerated and the\nlandscape eventually becomes covered by a repeated pattern of mounds and\ndepressions. The depressions are gilgais which become filled with water during\nthe wet seasons.\n\nAustralia has an abundance of cracking clay soils and a large areas dominated by\nvery pronounced wet and dry seasons providing ideal circumstances for the\nformation of gilgais. Brigalow and gidgee soils are particularly suited to\ngilgai formation. Small areas outside Australia also have the necessary soil\ntypes and rainfall variability for gilgai formation, including central Russia\nand the southern United States. Gilgais are structurally similar to the soil\npolygons of frigid regions, however soil polygons are formed by repeated rounds\nof soil shrinkage and swelling due to the freezing of soil water rather than the\nshrinkage and swelling caused by dehydration and rehydration that leads to\ngilgai formation.\n\nGilgais were an important source of water for Indigenous Australians and enabled\npeople to seasonally forage over areas that lacked permanent water. Gilgais were\nimportant for similar reasons for early Australian pastoralists, allowing stock\nto seasonally graze areas that lacked permanent water. The introduction of water\nwells and pumps has reduced the value of gilgais to humans as a source of water.\nGilgais are now generally considered a nuisance by farmers. The movement of soil\nassociated with gilgai formation damages infrastructure including building\nfoundations, roads and railway lines and the undulations produced interfere with\ncrop harvesting. The presence of seasonal water in grazing land makes it more\ndifficult to control stock and provides a water supply for vermin such as feral\npigs and kangaroos.\n\nGilgais remain of great ecological significance as a source of water for animal\nand plant life.\n","linknr":91,"url":"Gilgai","recorded":1375069602,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Gilgai&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Gilgai&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Gilgai,_New_South_Wales","/wiki/Australian_English","/wiki/Ephemeral#Geographical_examples","/wiki/Brigalow","/wiki/Acacia_cambagei","/wiki/Russia","/wiki/United_States","/w/index.php?title=Soil_polygons&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Indigenous_Australians","/wiki/Pastoralism","/wiki/Water_well","/wiki/Pump","/wiki/Feral","/wiki/Kangaroo","/w/index.php?title=Gilgai&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Vertisol","/wiki/Vernal_pool","/wiki/Pond","/w/index.php?title=Gilgai&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=Gilgai&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Special:BookSources/978-1-4020-5718-2","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gilgai&oldid=554259469","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Australian_English","/wiki/Category:Lakes","/wiki/Category:Lakes_of_Australia","/wiki/Category:Australian_Aboriginal_words_and_phrases","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Gilgai&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Gilgai","/wiki/Gilgai","/wiki/Talk:Gilgai","#","/wiki/Gilgai","/w/index.php?title=Gilgai&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Gilgai&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Gilgai","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Gilgai","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Gilgai&oldid=554259469","/w/index.php?title=Gilgai&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Gilgai&id=554259469","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Gilgai","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Gilgai&oldid=554259469&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Gilgai&printable=yes","#","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilgai","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Australian
