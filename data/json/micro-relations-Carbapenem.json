Recently, alarm has been raised over the spread of drug\nresistance to carbapenem antibiotics among these coliforms, due to production of\nthe New Delhi metallo-Î²-lactamase, NDM-1. There are currently no new antibiotics\nin the pipeline to combat bacteria resistant to carbapenems, and worldwide\nspread of the resistance gene is considered a potential nightmare\nscenario.\n","linknr":417,"url":"Carbapenem","recorded":1362500838,"links":35,"instances":["journal"],"pdf":["http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/pdf/wk/mm5924.pdf","http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/pdf/wk/mm5924.pdf","http://www.infectio-lille.com/diaporamas/invites/struct-act-duatb05-bryskier.pdf","http://www.sdshp.cshp.org/uploads/informulary/Informulary_Vol_3_Issue_3.pdf"],"categories":["Carbapenem antibiotics"],"headings":["Examples","Uses","Structure","Biosynthesis","Administration","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/Carbapenems_structure.svg/200px-Carbapenems_structure.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["razupenem","pz-601"],["pharmacotherapy","journal"]],"members":["pharmacotherapy","razupenem"],"related":["Beta-lactam_antibiotic","Beta-lactamase","Current_Opinion_in_Microbiology","Thienamycin","American_Journal_of_Medicine","New_Delhi_metallo-beta-lactamase","Imipenem","Imipenem/cilastatin","Meropenem","Ertapenem","Doripenem","Panipenem/betamipron","Biapenem","Razupenem_(PZ-601)","Tebipenem","Penicillin","Cephalosporin","Beta-lactamase","New_Delhi_metallo-beta-lactamase","Enzyme","Hydrolysis","Morbidity_and_Mortality_Weekly_Report","Gram-positive","Gram-negative","Anaerobes","Intracellular_bacteria","FEMS_Microbiology_Reviews","Penicillin","Penam","Degree_of_unsaturation","Malonyl-CoA","Glutamate-5-semialdehyde","Adenosine_triphosphate","Carbapenam","Current_Medicinal_Chemistry","Faropenem","Penem","Pharmacotherapy_(journal)"]}
