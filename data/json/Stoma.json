The term\nstomata is also used collectively to refer to an entire stomatal complex, both\nthe pore itself and its accompanying guard cells. Air\ncontaining carbon dioxide and oxygen enters the plant through these openings\nwhere it is used in photosynthesis and respiration, respectively. Oxygen\nproduced by photosynthesis in the '[[leaf|spongy layer]]' cells (parenchyma\ncells with pectin) of the leaf interior exits through these same openings. Also,\nwater vapor is released into the atmosphere through these pores in a process\ncalled transpiration.\n\nStomata are present in the sporophyte generation of all land plant groups\nexcept liverworts. Dicotyledons usually have more stomata on the lower\nepidermis than the upper epidermis. Monocotyledons, on the other hand, usually\nhave the same number of stomata on the two epidermes. In plants with floating\nleaves, stomata may be found only on the upper epidermis; submerged leaves may\nlack stomata entirely.\n","linknr":353,"url":"Stoma","recorded":1362482680,"links":52,"instances":["botany"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Photosynthesis","Plant physiology","Plant anatomy","Plant cells"],"headings":["Function","Evolution","Development","Stomata as pathogenic pathways","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/Tomato_leaf_stomate_1-color.jpg/300px-Tomato_leaf_stomate_1-color.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/02/HPIM0188-ligusterblad.jpg/300px-HPIM0188-ligusterblad.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/LeafUndersideWithStomata.jpg/300px-LeafUndersideWithStomata.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3c/Tomato_stoma_observed_through_immersion_oil.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3f/Plant_stoma_guard_cells.png/300px-Plant_stoma_guard_cells.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/6/6/7661240f68c850b79a3f3d2102d59805.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/6/8/e/68e619cfaba742f9069aac6684927021.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/b/8/a/b8aea299e5b5dab151cc6dd67ec5d4f7.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/a/e/c/aec12ca2bf99bba70df9b4c9d8c938c1.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/1859-Martinique.web.jpg/100px-1859-Martinique.web.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["epidermis","botany"],["epidermis","botany"]],"members":["epidermis"],"related":["Scanning_electron_microscope","Botany","Greek_language","Gaseous_exchange","Guard_cell","Carbon_dioxide","Oxygen","Photosynthesis","Cellular_respiration","Oxygen","Water_vapor","Transpiration","Sporophyte","Land_plant","Marchantiophyta","Dicotyledons","Epidermis_(botany)","Monocotyledons","Transpiration","Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate","RuBisCO","Photorespiration","Phosphoenolpyruvate_carboxylase","Crassulacean_acid_metabolism","RuBisCO","Fluorescence","Green_fluorescent_protein","Chlorophyll","Proton_pump","Protons","Guard_cell","Electrical_potential","Potassium","Water_potential","Osmosis","Osmotic_pressure","Microfibrils","Epidermis_(botany)","Abscisic_acid","Cytosol","Water_potential","Osmosis","Plasmolysed","Transpiration","Diffusion","Humidity","Ozone","Photosynthesis_system","Water_use_efficiency","Conceptacles","Plant_cuticle","Shoot_apical_meristem","Trichome","Pavement_cells","Guard_cell","Arabidopsis_thaliana","Coronatine"]}
