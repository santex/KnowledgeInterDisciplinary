This includes\nnational, regional, and global economies. {{Citation\n  | last = Sullivan first = Arthur authorlink = Arthur O' Sullivan coauthors =\n  | Steven M.

Macroeconomists\ndevelop models that explain the relationship between such factors as national\nincome, output, consumption, unemployment, inflation, savings, investment,\ninternational trade and international finance. In contrast, microeconomics is\nprimarily focused on the actions of individual agents, such as firms and\nconsumers, and how their behavior determines prices and quantities in specific\nmarkets. While macroeconomics is a broad field of study, there are two areas of\nresearch that are emblematic of the discipline: the attempt to understand the\ncauses and consequences of short-run fluctuations in national income (the\nbusiness cycle), and the attempt to understand the determinants of long-run\neconomic growth (increases in national income). Macroeconomic models and their\nforecasts are used by both governments and large corporations to assist in the\ndevelopment and evaluation of economic policy and business strategy.\n","linknr":563,"url":"Macroeconomics","recorded":1362670707,"links":100,"instances":["economics","keynes","economics","economics","economics","economics"],"pdf":["http://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/es/10/ES1004.pdf","http://www.econ.ucla.edu/workingpapers/wp165.pdf"],"categories":["Macroeconomics|"],"headings":["Basic macroeconomic concepts","Macroeconomic models","Macroeconomic policy","Development","See also","Notes","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/GDP_PPP_Per_Capita_IMF_2008.svg/200px-GDP_PPP_Per_Capita_IMF_2008.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7e/Circulation_in_macroeconomics.svg/300px-Circulation_in_macroeconomics.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/db/Okuns_law_differences_1948_to_mid_2011.png/220px-Okuns_law_differences_1948_to_mid_2011.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/80/M2andInflation.png/220px-M2andInflation.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/25/AS_%2B_AD_graph.svg/220px-AS_%2B_AD_graph.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b9/Islm.svg/270px-Islm.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/2/1/d/21dd521b3522222dc25d178fdc30cb31.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Emblem-money.svg/28px-Emblem-money.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["output","economics"],["consumption","economics"],["output","economics"],["capital","economics"],["crowding_out","economics"],["animal_spirits","keynes"],["sticky","economics"]],"members":["sticky","animal_spirits","crowding_out","consumption","output","capital"],"related":["Economics","Behavior","Economy","Microeconomics","Economics","Gross_domestic_product","Price_index","National_income","Output_(economics)","Consumption_(economics)","Unemployment","Inflation","Savings","Investment","International_trade","International_finance","Microeconomics","Business_entity","Prices","Short-run","Business_cycle","Long-run","Economic_growth","Macroeconomic_model","Economic_policy","Output_(economics)","Final_goods","Value_added","Gross_Domestic_Product","National_accounts","Capital_(economics)","Human_capital","Business_cycles","Recessions","Macroeconomic_policies","Labor_force","Discouraged_worker","Okun's_law","Inflation","Deflation","Price_indexes","Central_bank","Monetary_policy","Quantity_theory_of_money","Money_supply","AD-AS_model","Aggregate_demand","Aggregate_supply","Pigou_effect","Keynes_effect","Potential_output","Demand-pull_inflation","Cost-push_inflation","IS/LM","Liquidity_preference","Stabilization_policy","Inflation_targeting","Liquidity_trap","Quantitative_easing","Operation_Twist","Yield_curve","Fiscal_multiplier","Crowding_out_(economics)","Automatic_stabilizers","Business_cycle","Monetary_theory","Quantity_theory_of_money","Irving_Fisher","Money_velocity","Money_supply","Ludwig_Von_Mises","Theory_of_Money_and_Credit","Austrian_School","John_Maynard_Keynes","Keynesian_economics","Liquidity_preference","Multiplier_effect","Animal_spirits_(Keynes)","Neoclassical_synthesis","Paul_Samuelson","Franco_Modigliani","James_Tobin","Robert_Solow","Milton_Friedman","Phillips_Curve","Edmund_Phelps","Oil_shock","New_classical_macroeconomics","Robert_Lucas,_Jr.","Rational_expectations","Adaptive_expectations","Lucas_critique","Edward_C._Prescott","Finn_E._Kydland","Real_business_cycle","New_Keynesian","Stanley_Fischer","John_B._Taylor","Sticky_(economics)","Dynamic_stochastic_general_equilibrium","New_neoclassical_synthesis","AP_Macroeconomics","Dynamic_stochastic_general_equilibrium","Economic_development","University_of_Chicago_Press","London","UCLA"]}
