Industrial\ncontrol systems are used in industrial production.\n\nThere are two common classes of control systems, with many variations and\ncombinations: logic or sequential controls, and feedback or linear controls.\nThere is also fuzzy logic, which attempts to combine some of the design\nsimplicity of logic with the utility of linear control. Some devices or systems\nare inherently not controllable.\n",
