Towards the right-center among the\n coils, a prosthetic group called a heme group (shown in gray) with a bound\n oxygen molecule (red).]] 'Proteins' ( or ) are large biological molecules\n consisting of one or more chains of amino acids. Proteins perform a vast array\n of functions within living organisms, including catalyzing metabolic reactions,\n replicating DNA, responding to stimuli, and transporting molecules from one\n location to another. Proteins differ from one another primarily in their\n sequence of amino acids, which is dictated by the nucleotide sequence of their\n genes, and which usually results in folding of the protein into a specific three-\n dimensional structure that determines its activity.\n\nA polypeptide is a single linear polymer chain of amino acids bonded together by\npeptide bonds between the carboxyl and amino groups of adjacent amino acid\nresidues. The sequence of amino acids in a protein is defined by the sequence of\na gene, which is encoded in the genetic code. In general, the genetic code\nspecifies 20 standard amino acids; however, in certain organisms the genetic\ncode can include selenocysteine and—in certain archaea—pyrrolysine. Shortly\nafter or even during synthesis, the residues in a protein are often chemically\nmodified by posttranslational modification, which alters the physical and\nchemical properties, folding, stability, activity, and ultimately, the function\nof the proteins. Sometimes proteins have non-peptide groups attached, which can\nbe called prosthetic groups or cofactors. Proteins can also work together to\nachieve a particular function, and they often associate to form stable protein\ncomplexes.\n\nLike other biological macromolecules such as polysaccharides and nucleic acids,\nproteins are essential parts of organisms and participate in virtually every\nprocess within cells. Many proteins are enzymes that catalyze biochemical\nreactions and are vital to metabolism. Proteins also have structural or\nmechanical functions, such as actin and myosin in muscle and the proteins in the\ncytoskeleton, which form a system of scaffolding that maintains cell shape.\nOther proteins are important in cell signaling, immune responses, cell adhesion,\nand the cell cycle. Proteins are also necessary in animals' diets, since animals\ncannot synthesize all the amino acids they need and must obtain essential amino\nacids from food. Through the process of digestion, animals break down ingested\nprotein into free amino acids that are then used in metabolism.\n\nProteins may be purified from other cellular components using a variety of\ntechniques such as ultracentrifugation, precipitation, electrophoresis, and\nchromatography; the advent of genetic engineering has made possible a number of\nmethods to facilitate purification. Methods commonly used to study protein\nstructure and function include immunohistochemistry, site-directed mutagenesis,\nnuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry.\n",
