{"cursor":"19585","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The 'AutoAnalyzer' is an automated analyzer using a special flow technique named\n'continuous flow analysis' (CFA), first made by the 'Technicon Corporation'. The\ninstrument was invented 1957 by Leonard Skeggs, PhD and commercialized by Jack\nWhitehead's Technicon Corporation. The first applications were for clinical\nanalysis, but methods for industrial analysis soon followed.\n\nThe AutoAnalyzer profoundly changed the character of the chemical testing\nlaboratory by allowing significant increases in the numbers of samples that\ncould be processed. The novel design based on separating a continuously flowing\nstream with air bubbles all but eliminated slow, clumsy, and error prone manual\nmethods of analysis. This instrument single handedly changed the concept of\ndays per sample to a mindset that hundreds, or even thousands, of tests are\npossible per day.\n\nTechnicon sold its business to Revlon in 1980\n[http://www.wi.mit.edu/about/25th/jack/jack2.html Whitehead Institute -\nMaking clinical progress ] who later sold the\ncompany to separate clinical (Bayer) and industrial (Bran+Luebbe - now SEAL\nAnalytical) buyers in 1987. At the time, industrial applications accounted for\nabout 20% of CFA machines sold.\n\nIn 1974 Ruzicka and Hansen carried out in Denmark and in Brasil initial\nexperiments on a competitive technique, that they termed Flow Injection Analysis\n(FIA). Since then the technique found world wide use in research and routine\napplications, and was further modified through micro miniaturization and by\nreplacing continuous flow with computer controlled programmable flow.( see\nSequential Injection and Lab-on-valve technology).\n","linknr":187,"url":"AutoAnalyzer","recorded":1362481258,"links":14,"instances":["biochemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Medical equipment","Laboratory equipment","Analytical chemistry"],"headings":["Instruments","Clinical analysis","Industrial analysis","Operating Principle","Current Uses","Method sheets","See also","Notes","External links",""],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/Cobas_u_411.JPG/220px-Cobas_u_411.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["dialysis","biochemistry"]],"members":["dialysis"],"related":["Automated_analyzer","Denmark","Brasil","Flow_Injection_Analysis","Medical_laboratory","Chemical_analysis","Human_serum_albumin","Alkaline_phosphatase","Aspartate_transaminase","Blood_urea_nitrogen","Bilirubin","Calcium","Cholesterol","Creatinine","Glucose","Phosphorus","Protein","Uric_acid","Blood_serum","Technician","Hans_Baruch","Color_reaction","Dialysis_(biochemistry)","Protein","Molecule","Chart_recorder","Data_logger","Personal_computer","ASTM","International_Organization_for_Standardization","Nitrite","Nitrate","Ammonia","Cyanide","Phenol","Analytical_chemistry","Good_Laboratory_Practice","Medical_technologist","Virtual_instrumentation","Verification_and_validation"]}
