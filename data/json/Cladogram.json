{"cursor":"12926","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\n\nA 'cladogram' is a diagram used in cladistics which shows relations among\norganisms. A cladogram is not however an evolutionary tree because it does not\nshow how ancestors are related to descendants or how much they have changed;\nmany evolutionary trees can be inferred from a single cladogram. A cladogram\nuses lines that branch off in different directions ending at groups of\norganisms. There are many shapes of cladograms but they all have lines that\nbranch off from other lines. The lines can be traced back to where they branch\noff. These branching off points represent a hypothetical ancestor (not an actual\nentity) which would have the combined traits of the lines above it. This\nhypothetical ancestor might then provide clues about what to look for in an\nactual evolutionary ancestor. Although traditionally such cladograms were\ngenerated largely on the basis of morphological characters, DNA and RNA\nsequencing data and computational phylogenetics are now very commonly used in\nthe generation of cladograms.\n","linknr":218,"url":"Cladogram","recorded":1362372732,"links":26,"instances":["mathematics","genetics","mathematics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Diagrams","Phylogenetics"],"headings":["Generating a cladogram","Cladogram statistics","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/31/Cladogram-example1.svg/250px-Cladogram-example1.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Identical_cladograms.svg/250px-Identical_cladograms.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/04/Cladistics-Apomorphy.png/250px-Cladistics-Apomorphy.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/Simple_cladistics.svg/250px-Simple_cladistics.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["reversion","genetics"],["metric","mathematics"],["optimization","mathematics"]],"members":["optimization","reversion","metric"],"related":["Cladistics","Evolutionary_tree","DNA","RNA","Computational_phylogenetics","Notochord","DNA_sequencing","Molecular_systematics","Maximum_likelihood","Bayesian_inference","Retrotransposon_marker","Reversion_(genetics)","Genome","Homoplasy","Bat","Anatomy","Phylogeny","Metazoa","Heuristic","NP-hard","Algorithms","Metric_(mathematics)","Optimization_(mathematics)","Minimization","Least_squares","Neighbor-joining","Parsimony","Maximum_likelihood","Bayesian_inference","Parsimony","Simulated_annealing","Phylogenetics"]}
