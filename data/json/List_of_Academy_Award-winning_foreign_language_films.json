{"cursor":"17928","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'s [[Gate of Hell (film)|Gate of Hell]], a recipient of the Academy Award for\nCostume Design as well as an Academy Honorary Award]] The Academy of Motion\nPicture Arts and Sciences has given Academy Awards to foreign language films\nsince 1945. The Academy defines a foreign language film as a feature-length\nmotion picture produced outside the United States that contains primarily non-\nEnglish dialogue. Films that meet these criteria are eligible for the Academy\nAward for Best Foreign Language Film. They can be nominated for awards in\ncategories other than Best Foreign Language Film provided that they have been\ncommercially released in Los Angeles County and comply with the special rules\ngoverning those categories. In addition, foreign-language films produced in the\nUnited States are not eligible for Best Foreign Language Film, but are eligible\nfor awards in other categories.\n\nAs of 2008, 24 foreign language films have won Academy Awards outside of the\nBest Foreign Language Film category. The foreign language films with the most\nawards are Sweden's [[Fanny and Alexander]] and Taiwan's [[Crouching Tiger,\nHidden Dragon]], with both winning four awards, including the Academy Award for\nBest Foreign Language Film. Crouching\nTiger, Hidden Dragon received ten Academy Award nominations, the highest number\nof nominations ever garnered for a foreign language film. No foreign language film has been a\nrecipient of an Academy Award for Best Picture, although eight foreign language\nfilms have been nominees for the award.\n","linknr":845,"url":"List_of_Academy_Award-winning_foreign_language_films","recorded":1375055785,"links":["/w/index.php?title=List_of_Academy_Award-winning_foreign-language_films&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=List_of_Academy_Award-winning_foreign-language_films&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","/wiki/List_of_Academy_Award-winning_foreign-language_films","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","/w/index.php?title=List_of_Academy_Award-winning_foreign_language_films&redirect=no","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Jigokumon_poster.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/Jigokumon_poster.jpg/220px-Jigokumon_poster.jpg","/wiki/File:Jigokumon_poster.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Japan","/wiki/Gate_of_Hell_(film)","/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Costume_Design","/wiki/Academy_Honorary_Award","/wiki/Academy_of_Motion_Picture_Arts_and_Sciences","/wiki/Academy_Awards","/wiki/Feature-length","/wiki/English_language","/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Foreign_Language_Film","/wiki/Los_Angeles_County","#cite_note-Rules-1","/wiki/Sweden","/wiki/Fanny_and_Alexander","/wiki/Republic_of_China","/wiki/Crouching_Tiger,_Hidden_Dragon","#cite_note-ForeignLanguageFilmFacts-2","#cite_note-PeopleDailyCrouchingTiger-3","/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Picture","#cite_note-ForeignLanguageFilmFacts-2","#cite_note-USATodayOscars-4","#Best_Foreign_Language_Film_winners","#Other_categories","#Notes","#Academy_Award-winning_foreign_language_films_using_English_dubbage","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=List_of_Academy_Award-winning_foreign-language_films&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/List_of_Academy_Award_winners_and_nominees_for_Best_Foreign_Language_Film","#cite_note-HistPg2-5","/wiki/Secret_ballot","#cite_note-Rules-1","/wiki/Academy_Honorary_Award","#cite_note-HistPg1-6","/w/index.php?title=List_of_Academy_Award-winning_foreign-language_films&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/List_of_foreign_language_films_nominated_for_Academy_Awards","/wiki/List_of_actors_nominated_for_Academy_Awards_for_foreign_language_performances","/wiki/Los_Angeles_County","#cite_note-Rules-1","/wiki/Gate_of_Hell_(film)","#cite_note-VarietyToho-7","#cite_note-VarietyForeignFilmWinners-8","/wiki/1945_in_film","/wiki/18th_Academy_Awards","/wiki/Marie-Louise_(film)","/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Writing_Original_Screenplay","/wiki/Richard_Schweizer","/wiki/Switzerland","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Flag_of_Switzerland.svg/16px-Flag_of_Switzerland.svg.png","/wiki/Cinema_of_Switzerland","/wiki/German_language","/wiki/1954_in_film","/wiki/27th_Academy_Awards","/wiki/Gate_of_Hell_(film)","#endnote_Note1A","/wiki/Help:Installing_Japanese_character_sets","/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Costume_Design","/wiki/Sanzo_Wada","/wiki/Japan","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/79/Merchant_flag_of_Japan_%281870%29.svg/22px-Merchant_flag_of_Japan_%281870%29.svg.png","/wiki/Cinema_of_Japan","/wiki/Japanese_language","/wiki/1956_in_film","/wiki/29th_Academy_Awards","/wiki/The_Red_Balloon","/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Writing_Original_Screenplay","/wiki/Albert_Lamorisse","/wiki/France","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c3/Flag_of_France.svg/23px-Flag_of_France.svg.png","/wiki/Cinema_of_France","/wiki/French_language","/wiki/1961_in_film","/wiki/34th_Academy_Awards","/wiki/La_Dolce_Vita","/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Costume_Design","/wiki/Piero_Gherardi","/wiki/Italy","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/03/Flag_of_Italy.svg/23px-Flag_of_Italy.svg.png","/wiki/Cinema_of_Italy","/wiki/Italian_language","/wiki/English_language","/wiki/French_language","/wiki/German_language","/wiki/1961_in_film","/wiki/34th_Academy_Awards","/wiki/Two_Women","/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Actress","/wiki/Sophia_Loren","/wiki/Italy","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/03/Flag_of_Italy.svg/23px-Flag_of_Italy.svg.png","/wiki/Cinema_of_Italy","/wiki/France","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c3/Flag_of_France.svg/23px-Flag_of_France.svg.png","/wiki/Cinema_of_France","/wiki/Italian_language","/wiki/German_language","/wiki/1962_in_film","/wiki/35th_Academy_Awards","/wiki/Divorce,_Italian_Style","/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Writing_Original_Screenplay","/wiki/Ennio_d
