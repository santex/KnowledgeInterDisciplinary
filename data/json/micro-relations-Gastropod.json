The class\nGastropoda includes snails and slugs of all kinds and all sizes from microscopic\nto large. There are many thousands of species of sea snails and sea slugs, as\nwell as freshwater snails and freshwater limpets, as well as land snails and\nland slugs.\n\nThe class Gastropoda contains a vast total of named species, second only to the\ninsects in overall number. The fossil history of this class goes back to the\nLate Cambrian. There are 611 families of gastropods, of which 202 families are\nextinct and appear only in the fossil record.\n\nGastropoda (previously known as 'univalves' and sometimes spelled Gasteropoda)\nare a major part of the phylum Mollusca and are the most highly diversified\nclass in the phylum, with 60,000 to 80,000 [http://www-\n.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/226777/gastropod/35708/Distribution-and-\nabundance Britannica online: abundance of the Gastropoda] living snail and\nslug species. The anatomy, behavior, feeding and reproductive adaptations of\ngastropods vary significantly from one clade or group to another. Therefore, it\nis difficult to state many generalities for all gastropods.\n\nThe class Gastropoda has an extraordinary diversification of habitats.\nRepresentatives live in gardens, in woodland, in deserts, and on mountains; in\nsmall ditches, great rivers and lakes; in estuaries, mudflats, the rocky\nintertidal, the sandy subtidal, in the abyssal depths of the oceans including\nthe hydrothermal vents, and numerous other ecological niches, including\nparasitic ones.\n\nAlthough the name \"snail\" can be, and often is, applied to all the members of\nthis class, commonly this word means only those species with an external shell\nlarge enough that the soft parts can withdraw completely into it. Those\ngastropods without a shell, and those with only a very reduced or internal\nshell, are usually known as slugs.\n\nThe marine shelled species of gastropod include edible species such as abalone,\nconches, periwinkles, whelks, and numerous other sea snails that produce\nseashells that are coiled in the adult stageâthough in some, the coiling may not\nbe very visible, for example in cowries. In a number of families of species,\nsuch as all the various limpets, the shell is coiled only in the larval stage,\nand is a simple conical structure after that.\n","linknr":636,"url":"Gastropod","recorded":1362509276,"links":102,"instances":["literature","anatomy","gastropod","biology","mollusc","mollusc","gastropod","mollusc","mollusc","social_pedagogy","biology","mollusc","biology"],"pdf":["http://www.bio-nica.info/biblioteca/Monje1996.pdf","http://www.journal-malaco.fr/bouchet&rocroi_2005_Visaya.pdf","http://www.bolinfonet.org/pdf/MPEVsnailpaper.pdf","http://www.bolinfonet.org/pdf/MPEVsnailpaper.pdf","http://www.ucd.ie/cobid/unitas/newsletter/UMNewsletter_21.pdf"],"categories":["Gastropods|"],"headings":["Etymology","Diversity","Habitat","Anatomy","Life
