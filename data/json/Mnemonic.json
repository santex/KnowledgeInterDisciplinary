Each projecting knuckle represents a 31-day month.]] A 'mnemonic'\n  (, with a silent \"m\"), or 'mnemonic device', is any learning\n  technique that aids information retention. Mnemonics aim to translate\n  information into a form that the human brain can retain better than its\n  original form. Even the process of applying this conversion might already aid\n  the transfer of information to long-term memory. Commonly encountered\n  mnemonics are often for lists and in auditory form, such as short poems,\n  acronyms, or memorable phrases, but mnemonics can also be for other types of\n  information and in visual or kinesthetic forms. Their use is based on the\n  observation that the human mind more easily remembers spatial, personal,\n  surprising, physical, sexual, humorous, or otherwise 'relatable' information,\n  rather than more abstract or impersonal forms of information.\n\nThe word mnemonic is derived from the Ancient Greek word Î¼Î½Î·Î¼Î¿Î½Î¹ÎºÏÏ\n(mnÄmonikos), meaning \"of memory\" [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text-\n?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dmnhmoniko%2Fs Î¼Î½Î·Î¼Î¿Î½Î¹ÎºÏÏ], Henry\nGeorge Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus and is\nrelated to Mnemosyne (\"remembrance\"), the name of the goddess of memory in Greek\nmythology. Both of these words are derived from Î¼Î½Î®Î¼Î· (mnÄmÄ), \"remembrance, me-\nmory\".

The former is inborn, and is the\none that everyone uses automatically and without thinking. The artificial memory\nin contrast has to be trained and developed through the learning and practicing\nof a variety of mnemonic techniques.\n\nMnemonic systems are special techniques or strategies consciously used to\nimprove memory, it helps employ information already stored in long-term memory\nto make memorization an easier task.
