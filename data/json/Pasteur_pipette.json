They are usually glass tubes tapered to a\nnarrow point, and fitted with a rubber bulb at the top. The combination of the\nPasteur pipette and rubber bulb has also been referred to as a teat pipette.\nPasteur pipettes come in various lengths and are sold in boxes of hundreds. They\nare named after the French scientist Louis Pasteur, who was known to have used a\nvariant of them extensively during his research. Generally, they are considered\ncheap enough to be disposable, however, so long as the glass point is not\nchipped, the Pasteur pipette may be washed and reused indefinitely.\n\nThe name 'eye dropper' also may refer to early models of fountain-pens, which\nhave to be refilled with some kind of Pasteur pipette.\n","linknr":118,"url":"Pasteur_pipette","recorded":1362552466,"links":24,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Laboratory glassware"],"headings":["Plastic Pasteur pipettes","Microscale use","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9b/Pasteur_Pipets.jpg/220px-Pasteur_Pipets.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/Pipetti.jpg/220px-Pipetti.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/23/%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%B5%D8%A9-pipette.jpg/220px-%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%B5%D8%A9-pipette.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Teat","Louis_Pasteur","Fountain-pen","Biology","Hexane","Acetone","Biohazard","Celite","Column_chromatography","Silica_gel","Flash_column_chromatography","University_of_Colorado_at_Boulder","Laboratory_glassware","Pipette"]}
