They are known\nfor being capable of producing an electric discharge, ranging from as little as\n8 volts up to 220 volts depending on species, used to stun prey and for\ndefense. Martin, R. Aidan. [http://www.elasmo-\nresearch.org/education/shark_profiles/torpediniformes.htm Electric Rays].\nReefQuest Centre for Shark Research. Retrieved on October 12, 2008. There\nare 69 species in four families.\n\nPerhaps the best known members are those of the genus [[Torpedo\n(genus)|Torpedo]], also called crampfish and numbfish, after which the device\ncalled a torpedo is named. The name comes from the Latin torpere, to be\nstiffened or paralyzed, referring to the effect on someone who handles or steps\non a living electric ray.\n","linknr":257,"url":"Torpedo_ray","recorded":1362485538,"links":47,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Torpediniformes|","Rays","Electric fish"],"headings":["Description","Relationship to humans","Bioelectricity","Systematics","In popular culture","References","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/10/Torpedo_marmorata2.jpg/240px-Torpedo_marmorata2.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b7/Fish4345_-_Flickr_-_NOAA_Photo_Library.jpg/240px-Fish4345_-_Flickr_-_NOAA_Photo_Library.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6d/Torpedo_electric_organs.jpg/220px-Torpedo_electric_organs.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Marbled_electric_ray","Lesser_electric_ray","Animal","Chordate","Chondrichthyes","Elasmobranchii","Batoidea","Don_Fernando_de_Buen_y_Lozano","Batoid","Cartilaginous_fish","Pectoral_fin","Electric_discharge","Volt","Volt","Genus","Common_torpedo","Numbfish","Torpedo","Latin","Dorsal_fin","Caudal_fin","Dermal_denticle","Kidney","Electric_organ","Nostril","Gill_slit","Childbirth","Plato","Socrates","Scribonius_Largus","Common_torpedo","Headache","Gout","Occult_qualities","Mains_electricity","Narcinidae","Narkinae","Stunfisk","Stargazer","Flatfish","Electric_fish"]}
