He is recognized as one of the most\ninfluential and universal mathematicians of the 19th and early 20th centuries.\nHilbert discovered and developed a broad range of fundamental ideas in many\nareas, including invariant theory and the axiomatization of geometry. He also\nformulated the theory of Hilbert spaces,<ref></ref> one of the foundations of\nfunctional analysis.\n\nHilbert adopted and warmly defended Georg Cantor's set theory and transfinite\nnumbers. A famous example of his leadership in mathematics is his 1900\npresentation of a collection of problems that set the course for much of the\nmathematical research of the 20th century.\n\nHilbert and his students contributed significantly to establishing rigor and\ndeveloped important tools used in modern mathematical physics. Hilbert is known\nas one of the founders of proof theory and mathematical logic, as well as for\nbeing among the first to distinguish between mathematics and\nmetamathematics.<ref>{{cite web
