{"cursor":"16450","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"Mac}}\n\nA 'media access control address' ('MAC address') is a unique identifier assigned\nto network interfaces for communications on the physical network segment. MAC\naddresses are used for numerous network technologies and most IEEE 802 network\ntechnologies, including Ethernet. Logically, MAC addresses are used in the media\naccess control protocol sublayer of the OSI reference model.\n\nMAC addresses are most often assigned by the manufacturer of a network\ninterface card (NIC) and are stored in its hardware, such as the card's read-\nonly memory or some other firmware mechanism. If assigned by the manufacturer,\na MAC address usually encodes the manufacturer's registered identification\nnumber and may be referred to as the 'burned-in address'. It may also be known\nas an 'Ethernet hardware address' ('EHA'), 'hardware address' or 'physical\naddress'. This is can be contrasted to a programmed address, where the host\ndevice issues commands to the NIC to use an arbitrary address. An example is\nmany SOHO routers, where the ISP grants access to only one MAC address (used\npreviously to inserting the router) so the router must use that MAC address on\nits Internet-facing NIC. Therefore the router administrator configures a MAC\naddress to override the burned-in one.\n\nA network node may have multiple NICs and each must have one unique MAC\naddress per NIC.\n\nMAC addresses are formed according to the rules of one of three numbering name\nspaces managed by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE):\nMAC-48, EUI-48, and EUI-64. The IEEE claims trademarks on the names EUI-48 and\nEUI-64, in which EUI is an abbreviation for Extended Unique Identifier.\n","linknr":271,"url":"MAC_address","recorded":1362477076,"links":62,"instances":["computer_networking","computing","networking","computing"],"pdf":["http://standards.ieee.org/getieee802/download/802-2001.pdf","http://standards.ieee.org/getieee802/download/802-2001.pdf","http://standards.ieee.org/develop/regauth/tut/eui.pdf","http://standards.ieee.org/develop/regauth/tut/eui.pdf","http://standards.ieee.org/develop/regauth/tut/macgrp.pdf","http://standards.ieee.org/develop/regauth/tut/macgrp.pdf","http://standards.ieee.org/develop/regauth/tut/fibre.pdf","http://standards.ieee.org/develop/regauth/tut/fibre.pdf","http://standards.ieee.org/develop/regauth/tut/eui64.pdf","http://standards.ieee.org/develop/regauth/tut/eui64.pdf"],"categories":["Network addressing","Universal identifiers","Media access control"],"headings":["Notational conventions","Address details","Usage in Hosts","Usage in Switches","Bit-reversed notation","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/94/MAC-48_Address.svg/475px-MAC-48_Address.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Wikibooks-logo-en-noslogan.svg/40px-Wikibooks-logo-en-noslogan.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["octet","computing"],["router","computing"],["flooding","computer_networking"],["node","networking"]],"members":["flooding","octet","node","router"],"related":["Unique_identifier","Network_interface_controller","IEEE_802","Ethernet","Media_access_control","OSI_reference_model","Small_office/home_office","Internet_service_provider","Network_node","Institute_of_Electrical_and_Electronics_Engineers","Trademark","IEEE_802","Hexadecimal","Univerally_Administered_Address","Locally_Administered_Address","IEEE_802","Xerox","Octet_(computing)","Organizationally_Unique_Identifier","Least_significant_bit","Network_card","Unicast","Collision_domain","Network_switch","Router_(computing)","Promiscuous_mode","Multicast","IEEE_802.11","Bluetooth","Token_ring","FDDI","Asynchronous_Transfer_Mode","NSAP_address","Fibre_Channel","Serial_Attached_SCSI","World_Wide_Name","ITU-T","G.hn","Local_area_network","Power_line_communication","Ethernet_over_coax","Medium_Access_Control","FireWire","IPv6","ZigBee","IEEE_802.15","6LoWPAN","Network_Interface_Card","Hexadecimal","Flooding_(computer_networking)","IBM_token_ring","IPv6","Individual_Address_Block","Organizationally_Unique_Identifier","Network_virtualization","MAC_spoofing","Network_segment","Network_bridge","Internet_protocol_suite","IP_address","Address_Resolution_Protocol","Internet_Protocol","IPv4","Neighbor_Discovery_Protocol","IPv6","OSI_model","Node_(networking)","Link_layer","Layer_2","Address_learning","Iproute2","Ifconfig","Ipconfig","IEEE_802.3","IEEE_802.4","IEEE_802.5","IEEE_802.6","Organizationally_Unique_Identifier","IPv6","Hot_Standby_Router_Protocol","Virtual_Router_Redundancy_Protocol","IP_address","OpenBSD","Common_Address_Redundancy_Protocol","Linux","Iptables","CLUSTERIP","NSAP_address","Sleep_Proxy_Service","Wireshark"]}
