{"cursor":"5617","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Bit manipulation' is the act of algorithmically manipulating bits or other\npieces of data shorter than a word. Programming tasks that require bit\nmanipulation include low-level device control, error detection and correction\nalgorithms, data compression, encryption algorithms, and optimization. For most\nother tasks, modern programming languages allow the programmer to work directly\nwith abstractions instead of bits that represent those abstractions. Source code\nthat does bit manipulation makes use of the bitwise operations: AND, OR, XOR,\nNOT, and bit shifts.\n\nBit manipulation, in some cases, can obviate or reduce the need to loop over a\ndata structure and can give many-fold speed ups, as bit manipulations are\nprocessed in parallel, but the code can become rather more difficult to write\nand maintain.\n","linknr":127,"url":"Bit_manipulation","recorded":1362574581,"links":12,"instances":["computer_science","disambiguation","computing","computing","computer_science","disambiguation","data_type","computing","programming_language"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Binary arithmetic","Computer arithmetic"],"headings":["Terminology","Example of bit manipulation","Bit manipulation in the C programming language","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["data","computing"],["word","data_type"],["optimization","computer_science"],["abstraction","computer_science"],["c++","programming_language"],["bit_twiddler","disambiguation"],["bit_specification","disambiguation"],["flag","computing"],["mask","computing"]],"members":["optimization","bit_specification","flag","data","abstraction","bit_twiddler","word","mask"],"related":["Algorithm","Bit","Data_(computing)","Word_(data_type)","Computer_programming","Error_detection","Error_correction","Data_compression","Encryption","Optimization_(computer_science)","Programming_languages","Programmer","Abstraction_(computer_science)","Source_code","Bitwise_operation","Low-level_device_control","History_of_computing_hardware","Computation","C++_(programming_language)","Power_of_two","Bit_field","Bit_array","Bitset","Modulo_operation","Bit_twiddler_(disambiguation)","Bit_specification_(disambiguation)","Find_first_set","Flag_(computing)","Nibble","Mask_(computing)","Bit-banging","Bit_array","Addison-Wesley"]}
