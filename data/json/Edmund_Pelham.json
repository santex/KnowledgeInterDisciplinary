{"cursor":"3356","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Sir Edmund Pelham' (c.1533 â 1606), a member of the distinguished Pelham family\nof Laughton, was an Irish judge who held the office of Chief Baron of the Irish\nExchequer, and was noteworthy as the first judge to hold assizes in Ulster.\n\nHe was the fifth son of Sir William Pelham of Laughton and his second wife Mary\nSandys, daughter of William Sandys, 1st Baron Sandys of the Vyne. Sir William\nPelham, Lord Justice of Ireland was his brother.\n\nHis father died when he was a small child; little is recorded of him from then\nuntil 1563 when he was admitted to Gray's Inn, and he was called to the bar in\n1574. He remained at Gray's Inn for 40 years, becoming reader and ancient, but\ndoes not seem to have advanced far in his legal career, although he was elected\nto the House of Commons as member for Hastings in 1597. The fact that his wife\nbelonged to an openly Catholic family may have hindered his career.\n\nIn 1601 he finally became serjeant: since he was now close to 70, this might\nreasonably have marked the height of his progress. However in 1602 Sir Robert\nNapier, who had long been recognised as unfit for office, was at last removed as\nIrish Chief Baron, and Pelham, perhaps because of his brother's long experience\nas Lord Justice there, replaced him.\n\nAs Chief Baron he is best remembered for holding the first assizes in Donegal in\n1603. Allowing for an element of self-congratulation, he seems to have been\nhighly successful: he wrote that \" the people reverenced him as though he had\nbeen an angel from Heaven, and prayed him on their knees to return to minister\njustice unto them\". Ball F. Elrington The Judges in Ireland 1221-1921 John\nMurray London 1926 Vol I p.228 He was knighted in 1604, went on the\nLeinster assize in 1605, and acted as Commissioner of the Great Seal the same\nyear. However he was now an old and sick man: he went to Bath for his health in\n1606, but died at Chester on 4 June. Ball, p.228 Sir Arthur Chichester\npraised him as a diligent and very worthy judge.\n\nHis marriage to Ellen Darrell of Scotney Castle, Sussex, was a surprising one\nfor an ambitious lawyer, since the Darrells were notorious recusants who allowed\nthe Jesuits to use Scotney as a refuge. He had at least one son, Herbert (born\n1587), ancestor of the Pelhams of Catsfield.\n","linknr":114,"url":"Edmund_Pelham","recorded":1375066022,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Edmund_Pelham&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Edmund_Pelham&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Laughton","/wiki/Chief_Baron_of_the_Irish_Exchequer","/wiki/Ulster","/wiki/William_Sandys,_1st_Baron_Sandys_of_the_Vyne","/wiki/William_Pelham_(lord_justice)","/wiki/Lord_Justice_of_Ireland","#cite_note-DNB-1","/wiki/Gray%27s_Inn","/wiki/House_of_Commons_of_England","/wiki/Hastings","/wiki/Serjeant","/wiki/Robert_Napier_(judge)","#cite_note-DNB-1","/wiki/Donegal","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Commissioner_of_the_Great_Seal","/wiki/Bath,_Somerset","/wiki/Chester","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Arthur_Chichester","/wiki/Scotney_Castle","/wiki/Recusants","/wiki/Jesuits","/wiki/Catsfield","/w/index.php?title=Edmund_Pelham&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-DNB_1-0","#cite_ref-DNB_1-1","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/12px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png","/wiki/Albert_Frederick_Pollard","//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Pelham,_Edmund_(DNB00)","/wiki/Sidney_Lee","/wiki/Dictionary_of_National_Biography","#cite_ref-2","#cite_ref-3","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Edmund_Pelham&oldid=557866142","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1606_deaths","/wiki/Category:People_from_Sussex","/wiki/Category:Irish_judges","/wiki/Category:Members_of_Gray%27s_Inn","/wiki/Category:English_MPs_1597%E2%80%931598","/wiki/Category:17th-century_Irish_people","/wiki/Category:17th-century_lawyers","/wiki/Category:16th-century_Irish_people","/wiki/Category:16th-century_lawyers","/wiki/Category:People_of_the_Tudor_period","/wiki/Category:People_of_the_Stuart_period","/wiki/Category:Year_of_birth_uncertain","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Edmund+Pelham&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Edmund+Pelham","/wiki/Edmund_Pelham","/wiki/Talk:Edmund_Pelham","#","/wiki/Edmund_Pelham","/w/index.php?title=Edmund_Pelham&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Edmund_Pelham&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Edmund_Pelham","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Edmund_Pelham","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Edmund_Pelham&oldid=557866142","/w/index.php?title=Edmund_Pelham&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5339732","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Edmund_Pelham&id=557866142","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Edmund+Pelham","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Edmund+Pelham&oldid=557866142&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Edmund_Pelham&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5339732#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Pelham","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":["lord_justice","judge"],"pdf":[],"categories":["1606
