{"cursor":"6953","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n a bioorganic and natural products chemist, is Centennial Professor Emeritus of\n Chemistry and former Chairman of the Chemistry Department, Columbia University.\n\nHe was born in Hong Kong on May 11, 1925. He received his bachelor's degree in\nchemistry from Nagoya University in 1947 from Prof. Fujio Egami. Following two\nyears of post-graduate work with Prof. Louis Fieser at Harvard University, he\nreturned to Nagoya University where he completed his Ph.D. in 1954 with Prof.\nYoshimasa Hirata. He took a position as Assistant Professor at Nagoya, and then\nProfessor of Chemistry at Tokyo Kyoiku University. In 1963 he moved to Tohoku\nUniversity in Sendai and remained there until 1969 when he joined the faculty of\nColumbia University. In 1980 he became 'Centennial Professor of Chemistry'. He\nwas Chairman of the Chemistry Department, 1987-\n90. [http://www.chemecol.org/newsletters/vol_23_3.htm#silver ISCE Newsletter\nVol_23_3 ]\n\nHe was a founding member and one of the six Directors of Research at the\nInternational Center of Insect Physiology and Ecology in Kenya, the first\nDirector of the nonprofit Suntory Institute for Bioorganic Research (Sunbor),\nOsaka, and he assisted the Brazilian government to set up a center of excellence\nin the Amazons, the Institute of Medicinal and Ecological Chemistry with its\nheadquarters in SÃ£o Paulo. In April 2001 he was asked to start a chemistry unit\nwithin Biosphere 2, Arizona, operated by Columbia University.\n\nHis research encompasses isolation, structural and bioorganic studies of\nbioactive compounds, retinal proteins, interaction between ligands and\nneuroreceptors, development of various spectroscopic methods, especially\ncircular dichroic spectroscopy. He has published around '750' papers, and\nhas authored, co-authored, or edited nine books on spectroscopy and\nnatural products.\n\nKoji Nakanishi has determined the structures of over 200 biologically active\nanimal and plant natural products, many of which are endogenous and/or the first\nmember of a new class. These include ginkgolides from the ancient ginkgo tree,\nfirst insect molting hormones from plants, new nucleic acid bases, insect\nantifeedants, antibiotics, first meiosis inducing substance from starfish,\ncrustacean molt inhibitors, shark repellents from fish, tunicate blood pigments,\nbrevetoxins from red-tide dinoflagellates, philanthotoxin (glutamate and\nnicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist) from a wasp, and the human eye\npigment involved in macular degeneration.\n\nHis studies with retinal analogs and retinal proteins have made seminal\ncontributions in understanding the structural and mechanistic basis of animal\nvision and phototaxis. In 2000 his research group succeeded in clarifying\nrelative movements of the retinal and the opsin receptor throughout the visual\ntransduction process; this is the first such study performed with G protein\ncoupled receptors ('GPCR') and will contribute in clarifying the mode of action\nof numerous other GPCRs. It also established the structure and biosynthesis of\nthe fluorescent pigment 'A2E' that leads to the incurable eye disease age-\nrelated macular degeneration (AMD) and its involvement in apoptosis.\n\nHis spectroscopic contributions include the first applications of the NMR\nnuclear Overhauser effect in structure determination during the ginkgolide\nstudies (1967), and in particular development of the exciton coupled circular\ndichroic method (1969), a non-empirical sub-microgram scale technique for\ndetermining various aspects of molecular chirality of organic molecules in\nsolution, an extremely versatile technique applicable to compounds ranging from\nsmall molecules to various types of ligand / receptor complexes.\n\nAs of December 2002, approximately 425 students and postdoctoral fellows have\nspent a period of time in his group, i.e., 95 in Japan and 330 at Columbia\nUniversity. About 140 of his former colleagues hold academic positions at\nuniversities.\n\nHe has received awards from U.S.A., Japan, Bulgaria, China, the Czech Republic,\nHolland, Italy, Saudi Arabia, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan and U.K. In an\nunprecedented international alliance, the Nakanishi Prize of the American\nChemical Society (ACS) and the Chemical Society of Japan (CSJ) was established\nin 1996 and is awarded in alternate years in Japan and the U.S. to recognize\nachievements in chemical and spectroscopic methods to the study of biological\nphenomena; it is the only CSJ prize with an individual's name. More recently in\n1999, he was awarded one of Japan's highest honors, \"Person of Cultural Merit\"\n[http://www.columbia.edu/cu/news/99/11/japanPrize.html Columbia News :::\nColumbia Chemist Koji Nakanishi Wins Prestigious Japanese Prize ] for his breakthrough research in the organic\nchemistry of natural products.\n\nHis many honors include the prestigious King Faisal International Prize in\nScience, the Welch Award, the Arthur C. Cope Award, the Imperial Prize of the\nJapan Academy, the National Academy of Sciences Award in Chemical Sciences, and\nthe Japan Academy Prize, as well as honorary doctorates from Williams College,\nGeorgetown University and the University of Uppsala.\n\nWhen Koji Nakanishi appears at a reception where he is scheduled to receive an\naward or to present a scientific paper, the audience could most generally expect\nan added spectacular surprise treat, as Koji is a famous and talented magician.-\n[http://c250.columbia.edu/c250_celebrates/remarkable_columbians/koji_nakan-\nishi.html Koji Nakanishi ]\n\nKoji Nakanishi has two children, Keiko and Jun, and three grandchildren, Aya,\nKenji, and Pico. Pico is currently a student at Columbia University.\n","linknr":153,"url":"Koji_Nakanishi","recorded":1374782088,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Koji_Nakanishi&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Koji_Nakanishi&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Biographies_of_living_persons","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability","/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources","/wiki/Defamation","/wiki/Help:Installing_Japanese_character_sets","/wiki/Bioorganic_chemistry","/wiki/Chemist","/wiki/Chemistry","/wiki/Columbia_University","/wiki/Hong_Kong","/wiki/Nagoya_University","/wiki/Louis_Fieser","/wiki/Harvard_University","/w/index.php?title=Tokyo_Kyoiku_University&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Tohoku_University","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Kenya","/w/index.php?title=Suntory_Institute_for_Bioorganic_Research&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Osaka","/wiki/S%C3%A3o_Paulo","/wiki/Biosphere_2","/wiki/Columbia_University","/wiki/Ginkgo","/wiki/Ecdysis","/wiki/Antibiotic","/wiki/Starfish","/wiki/Tunicate","/wiki/Brevetoxin","/wiki/Dinoflagellate","/wiki/Philanthotoxin","/wiki/Nicotinic_acetylcholine_receptor","/wiki/Wasp","/wiki/Phototaxis","/wiki/Opsin","/wiki/G_protein","/wiki/Age-related_macular_degeneration","/wiki/Nuclear_Overhauser_effect","/wiki/Ginkgolide","/wiki/Exciton","/wiki/Circular_dichroism","/wiki/Chirality_(chemistry)","/wiki/Ligand","/wiki/American_Chemical_Society","/wiki/Chemical_Society_of_Japan","/wiki/Person_of_Cultural_Merit","#cite_note-2","/w/index.php?title=King_Faisal_International_Prize_in_Science&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Welch_Award","/wiki/Arthur_C._Cope_Award","/w/index.php?title=Imperial_Prize&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Japan_Academy","/wiki/United_States_National_Academy_of_Sciences","/wiki/Japan_Academy_Prize","/wiki/Williams_College","/wiki/Georgetown_University","/wiki/University_of_Uppsala","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Columbia_University","/w/index.php?title=Koji_Nakanishi&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","http://www.chemecol.org/newsletters/vol_23_3.htm#silver","#cite_ref-2","http://www.columbia.edu/cu/news/99/11/japanPrize.html","#cite_ref-3","http://c250.columbia.edu/c250_celebrates/remarkable_columbians/koji_nakanishi.html","/w/index.php?title=Koji_Nakanishi&action=edit&section=2","http://www.jce.divched.org/JCEWWW/Features/eChemists/document.php?chemid=28","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/35261533","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Koji_Nakanishi&oldid=544885347","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1925_births","/wiki/Category:Living_people","/wiki/Category:Japanese_chemists","/wiki/Category:Harvard_University_staff","/wiki/Category:Columbia_University_faculty","/wiki/Category:Laureates_of_the_Imperial_Prize","/wiki/Category:Tohoku_University_faculty","/wiki/Category:BLP_articles_lacking_sources_from_March_2013","/wiki/Category:Articles_containing_Japanese-language_text","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Koji+Nakanishi&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Koji+Nakanishi","/wiki/Koji_Nakanishi","/wiki/Talk:Koji_Nakanishi","#","/wiki/Koji_Nakanishi","/w/index.php?title=Koji_Nakanishi&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Koji_Nakanishi&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Koji_Nakanishi","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Koji_Nakanishi","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special
