{"cursor":"9939","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Audio induction loop' systems, also called 'audio-frequency induction loops'\n('AFILs') or 'hearing loops', are an aid for the hard of\nhearing. They are a loop of cable around a designated area, usually a\nroom or a building, which generates a magnetic field picked up by a hearing aid.\nThe loops carry baseband audio-frequency currents; no carrier signal is used.\nThe benefit is that it allows the sound source of interestâwhether a musical\nperformance or a ticket taker's side of the conversationâto be transmitted to\nthe hearing-impaired listener clearly and free of other distracting noise in the\nenvironment. Typical installation sites would include\nconcert halls, ticket kiosks, high-traffic public buildings (for PA\nannouncements), auditoriums, places of worship, and homes.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, as an aid for disability, their provision where\nreasonably possible is required by the Disability Discrimination Act 1995, and\nthey are available in \"the back seats of all London taxis, which have a little\nmicrophone embedded in the dashboard in front of the driver; at 18,000 post\noffices in the U.K.; at most churches and cathedrals\", according\nto Prof. David G. Meyers.\n\nIn the United States, an older technology using FM transmission to \"neck loops\"\nis more established. In comparison, hearing loops require a greater initial\ninvestment, but offer greater convenience and avoid the social stigma entailed\nby the FM system's paraphernalia.\n\nAn alternative system used in theatres uses invisible infrared radiation;\ncompatible headsets can pick up the modulated infrared energy to produce sound.\n\nThis article considers the history and theory of induction loops, and some\npractical considerations.\n","linknr":146,"url":"Audio_induction_loop","recorded":1362564889,"links":17,"instances":["electricity"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Hearing aids","Assistive technology","Augmentative and alternative communication"],"headings":["History","Induction loop theory","Practical induction loops","Technical standards","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9b/Hearing_induction_loop_hearing_aid.jpg/220px-Hearing_induction_loop_hearing_aid.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["ground_loop","electricity"]],"members":["ground_loop"],"related":["Telecoil","Baseband","Public_address","Disability_Discrimination_Act_1995","Telephone","Loudspeaker","Faraday's_law_of_induction","Harmonics","Radio_interference","Electromagnetic_interference","EMC_Directive","Hearing_impairment","DB_SPL","Automatic_gain_control","Decibel","Ground_loop_(electricity)","British_Standards_Institution"]}
