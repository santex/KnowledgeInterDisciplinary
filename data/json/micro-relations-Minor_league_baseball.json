All of\nthe minor leagues are operated as independent businesses. Most are members of\nthe umbrella organization known as 'Minor League Baseball' ('MiLB'), which\noperates under the Commissioner of Baseball within the scope of organized\nbaseball. Several leagues, known as independent leagues, do not have any\nofficial links to Major League Baseball.\n\nExcept for the Mexican League, teams in the organized minor leagues are\ngenerally independently owned and operated but are directly affiliated with one\nmajor league team through a standardized Player Development Contract (PDC).\nThese leagues also go by the nicknames the \"farm system,\" \"farm club,\" or \"farm\nteam(s)\" because of a joke passed around by major league players in the 1930s\nwhen St. Louis Cardinals' general manager Branch Rickey formalized the system,\nand teams in small towns were \"growing players down on the farm like corn.\"\n\nMajor and Minor League teams may enter into a PDC for a two or four year term\nand may re-affiliate at the expiration of a PDC term, though many relationships\nare renewed and endure for extended time periods. For example, the Omaha Storm\nChasers (formerly the Omaha Royals) have been the Triple-A affiliate of the\nKansas City Royals since the Royals joined the American League in 1969, but the\nColumbus Clippers changed affiliations from the New York Yankees to the\nWashington Nationals in 2007 and are now affiliated with the Cleveland Indians.\nA few minor league teams are directly owned by their major league parent club,\nsuch as the Springfield Cardinals, owned by the St. Louis Cardinals, and all of\nthe Atlanta Braves' affiliates except for the Lynchburg Hillcats. Minor League\nteams that are owned directly by the major league Club do not have PDCs with\neach other and are not part of the reaffiliation shuffles that occur every\nother year.\n\nToday, 19 minor baseball leagues operate with 243 member clubs in large, medium,\nand small towns, as well as the suburbs of major cities, across the United\nStates, Canada, Mexico, the Dominican Republic, and Venezuela.\nhttp://www.milb.com/milb/info/teams.jsp\n","linknr":596,"url":"Minor_league_baseball","recorded":1362553813,"links":30,"instances":["baseball","company","baseball","baseball","baseball","20th_century","milby_awards","minor_league","baseball","baseball","early_20th_century","baseball","defunct_minor_league"],"pdf":[],"categories":["History
