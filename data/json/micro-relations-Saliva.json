Human saliva is 99.5% water, while the other 0.5% consists\nof electrolytes, mucus, glycoproteins, enzymes, and antibacterial compounds such\nas secretory IgA and lysozyme. The enzymes found in\nsaliva are essential in beginning the process of digestion of dietary starches\nand fats. These enzymes also play a role in breaking down food particles\nentrapped within dental crevices, protecting teeth from bacterial decay. {{cite book |last1 = Fejerskov |first1 = O |last2 = Kidd |first = E\n|author9 = Fejerskov, O.; Kidd, E.; |title = Dental Caries: The Disease and Its\nClinical Management, 2nd Edition |year = 2008 |publisher = Wiley-Blackwell |isbn\n= 978-1-4051-3889-5 }} Furthermore, saliva serves a lubricative function,\nwetting food and permitting the initiation of swallowing, and protecting the\nmucosal surfaces of the oral cavity from desiccation. {{cite book\n|last1 = Edgar |first1 = M |last2 = Dawes |first2 = C |last3 = O'Mullane |first3\n= D |title = Saliva and Oral Health: 3rd Edition |publisher = British Dental\nAssociation |year = 2004 |isbn = 0-904588-87-4 }}\n\nVarious species have special uses for saliva that go beyond predigestion. Some\nswifts use their gummy saliva to build nests. [[Aerodramus]] nests are prized\nfor use in bird's nest soup. Cobras, vipers, and\ncertain other members of the venom clade hunt with venomous saliva injected by\nfangs. Some arthropods, such as spiders and caterpillars, create thread from\nsalivary glands.\n","linknr":374,"url":"Saliva","recorded":1362504676,"links":81,"instances":["quinone","digestion"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Body fluids"],"headings":["Functions","Stimulation","Daily salivary output","Contents","Spitting","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1f/OakDoNotSpitOnFloor.jpg/225px-OakDoNotSpitOnFloor.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/15px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["bolus","digestion"],["nad(ph_dehydrogenase","quinone"]],"members":["bolus"],"related":["Salivary_glands","Water","Electrolyte","Mucus","Glycoproteins","Enzyme","Antiseptic","IgA","Lysozyme","British_Dental_Association","Swift","Bird's_nest_soup","Venom_clade","Bolus_(digestion)","Starch","Lingual_lipase","Lipase","Disinfection","Wound_licking","University_of_Florida","Gainesville,_Florida","Protein","Nerve_growth_factor","Mouse","Antibacterial","IgA","Lactoferrin","Lysozyme","Peroxidase","Wound_licking","Pathogen","Herpes","Antibiotics","Septicemia","Avian_influenza","Feces","Trophic","Antioxidant","Apoptosis","Iodide","Swift","Aerodramus","Bird's_nest_soup","Sympathetic_nervous_system","Parasympathetic","Muscarinic","Kallikrein","Myoepitheilium","Sialagogue","Antisialagogue","Submandibular_gland","Parotid_gland","Salivary_gland","Water","Electrolyte","Mucus","Antiseptic","Enzyme","Fluid","Water","Electrolyte","Sodium","Blood_plasma","Potassium","Calcium","Magnesium","Chloride","Bicarbonate","Phosphate","Iodine","Mucus","Glycosaminoglycan","Glycoprotein","Thiocyanate","Hydrogen_peroxide","Immunoglobulin_A","Epidermal_growth_factor","EGF","Enzyme","Amylase","PH","Lingual_lipase","PH","Kallikrein","Bradykinin","Antimicrobial","Lysozyme","Lactoperoxidase","Lactoferrin","Immunoglobulin_A","Proline","Tooth_enamel","Acid_phosphatase","N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine_amidase","NAD(P)H_dehydrogenase_(quinone)","Superoxide_dismutase","Glutathione_transferase","Aldehyde_dehydrogenase","Glucose-6-phosphate_isomerase","Kallikrein","Halitosis","Opiorphin","New_Orleans","Spitting","Taboo","Spittle_cures","British_Dental_Association"]}
