Its\nheadquarters are located in Tehran, Iran.\n\nThe station has been criticised for its uncritical embrace of provocative\nstances. For British journalist Nick Cohen the station is \"a platform for the\nfull fascist conspiracy theory of supernatural Jewish power\" Nick Cohen [http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/dec/04/nick-cohen-press-tv-\nhatred \"Who will rid us of hate channels such as Press TV?\"], The Observer, 4\nDecember 2011 and for commentator Douglas Murray it is the \"Iranian\ngovernmentâs propaganda channel\".
