{"cursor":"11077","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nIn the United States, the title of 'federal judge' usually means a judge\nappointed by the President of the United States and confirmed by the United\nStates Senate pursuant to the Appointments Clause in Article II of the United\nStates Constitution.\n\nIn addition to the Supreme Court of the United States, whose existence and some\naspects of whose jurisdiction are beyond the constitutional power of Congress to\nalter, acts of Congress have established 13 courts of appeals (also called\n\"circuit courts\") with appellate jurisdiction over different regions of the\nUnited States, and 94 United States district courts. Every judge appointed to\nsuch a court may be categorized as a federal judge; such positions include the\nChief Justice and Associate Justices of the Supreme Court, Circuit Judges of the\ncourts of appeals, and district judges of the United States district courts. All\nof these judges described thus far are referred to sometimes as \"Article III\njudges\" because they exercise the judicial power vested in the judicial branch\nof the federal government by Article III of the U.S. Constitution. In addition,\njudges of the Court of International Trade exercise judicial power pursuant to\nArticle III.\n\nOther judges serving in the federal courts, including magistrate judges and\nbankruptcy judges, are also sometimes referred to as \"federal judges\"; however,\nthey are neither appointed by the President nor confirmed by the Senate, and\ntheir power derives from Article I instead. See Article I and Article III\ntribunals.\n","linknr":282,"url":"United_States_federal_judge","recorded":1375090167,"links":["/w/index.php?title=United_States_federal_judge&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=United_States_federal_judge&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/File:Great_Seal_of_the_United_States_(obverse).svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/Great_Seal_of_the_United_States_%28obverse%29.svg/125px-Great_Seal_of_the_United_States_%28obverse%29.svg.png","/wiki/Politics_of_the_United_States","/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States","/wiki/United_States_Constitution","/wiki/Taxation_in_the_United_States","/wiki/United_States_Congress","/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives","/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives","/wiki/Leaders_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives","/wiki/List_of_United_States_congressional_districts","/wiki/United_States_Senate","/wiki/President_pro_tempore_of_the_United_States_Senate","/wiki/Party_leaders_of_the_United_States_Senate","/wiki/President_of_the_United_States","/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States","/wiki/Cabinet_of_the_United_States","/wiki/List_of_United_States_federal_agencies","/wiki/United_States_federal_courts","/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States","/wiki/United_States_courts_of_appeals","/wiki/United_States_district_court","/wiki/Elections_in_the_United_States","/wiki/United_States_presidential_election","/wiki/United_States_midterm_election","/wiki/Off-year_election","/wiki/Political_parties_in_the_United_States","/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)","/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)","/wiki/Third_party_(United_States)","/wiki/Federalism_in_the_United_States","/wiki/State_governments_of_the_United_States","/wiki/List_of_current_United_States_governors","/wiki/State_legislature_(United_States)","/wiki/List_of_United_States_state_legislatures","/wiki/State_court_(United_States)","/wiki/Local_government_in_the_United_States","/wiki/Outline_of_political_science#Politics_by_region","//commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Atlas_of_the_United_States","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/01/A_coloured_voting_box.svg/16px-A_coloured_voting_box.svg.png","/wiki/Portal:Politics","/wiki/Template:Politics_of_the_United_States","/wiki/Template_talk:Politics_of_the_United_States","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Politics_of_the_United_States&action=edit","/wiki/Judge","/wiki/President_of_the_United_States","/wiki/United_States_Senate","/wiki/Appointments_Clause","/wiki/Article_II_of_the_U.S._Constitution","/wiki/United_States_Constitution","/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States","/wiki/United_States_court_of_appeals","/wiki/Appellate_jurisdiction","/wiki/United_States_district_court","/wiki/Chief_Justice_of_the_United_States","/wiki/Associate_Justice_of_the_Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States","/wiki/United_States_district_court","/wiki/Court_of_International_Trade","/wiki/United_States_magistrate_judge","/wiki/United_States_bankruptcy_court","/wiki/Article_I_and_Article_III_tribunals","#Tenure_and_salary","#Duty_station","#Retirement","#Number_of_judges","#Non-Article_III_judges","#See_also","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=United_States_federal_judge&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Impeachment_in_the_United_States","/wiki/William_Rehnquist","/wiki/Scire_facias","#cite_note-1","/wiki/United_States_Senate","/wiki/Nixon_v._United_States","/wiki/Associate_Justice_of_the_Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States","/wiki/Chief_Justice_of_the_United_States","#cite_note-2","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Revolving_door_(politics)","/wiki/Regulatory_capture","#cite_note-2006rfj-4","/w/index.php?title=United_States_federal_judge&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Judicial_Conference_of_the_United_States","/w/index.php?title=United_States_federal_judge&action=edit&section=3","#cite_note-5","#cite_note-6","#cite_note-7","#cite_note-8","/w/index.php?title=United_States_federal_judge&action=edit&section=4","/wiki/United_States_circuit_court","#cite_note-fjc-9","/wiki/United_States_Court_of_International_Trade","#cite_note-10","#cite_note-fjc-9","/w/index.php?title=United_States_federal_judge&action=edit&section=5","/wiki/United_
