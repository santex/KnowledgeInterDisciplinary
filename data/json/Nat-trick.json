{"cursor":"22850","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nA 'hat-trick' or 'hat trick' in sport is the achievement of a positive feat\nthree times or more during a game, or other achievements based on threes. The\nterm was first used in 1858 in cricket to describe HH Stephenson's feat of\ntaking three wickets in three balls. A collection was held for Stephenson, and\nhe was presented with a hat bought with the proceeds. Extended Oxford\nEnglish Dictionary 1999 Edition : \"It came into use after HH Stephenson took\nthree wickets in three balls for the all-England eleven against the twenty-two\nof Hallam at the Hyde Park ground, Sheffield in 1858. A collection was held for\nStephenson (as was customary for outstanding feats by professionals) and he was\npresented with a cap or hat bought with the proceeds.\" The term was used\nin print for the first time in 1878. The Oxford Companion to Australian\nCricket (Oxford University Press, 1996) mentions that the word hat-trick was\nused in print for the first time in The Sportsman to describe Spofforth clean\nbowling three consecutive batsmen in the match against Hastings and Districts at\nthe Oval on 29 August 1878. Spofforth did take a hat-trick and nine wickets in\n20 balls against the XVIII of Hastings and Districts in 1878 (not a first class\nmatch), but the dates are incorrect.\n\nThe term was eventually adopted by many other sports including association\nfootball, water polo, and team handball, but did not become popular in North\nAmerica until the mid-1940s in the National Hockey League.\n","linknr":437,"url":"Nat-trick","recorded":1362539226,"links":53,"instances":["striker","association_football","cricket","disambiguation","rugby","bowling","scrabble","cricket","cricketer","cricket","target","darts_player","cricketer","cricketer"],"pdf":["http://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/federation/81/42/36/lawsofthegameen.pdf","http://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/federation/81/42/36/lawsofthegameen.pdf"],"categories":["Cricket terminology","Bowling (cricket)","Association football terminology","Ice hockey terminology"],"headings":["Origin","Cricket","Association football","Hockey","Rugby","Lacrosse","Darts","Poker","Motor racing","Marbles","Scrabble","Baseball","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/66/HatTrick.jpg/220px-HatTrick.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["batting","cricket"],["over","cricket"],["jalal-ud-din","cricketer"],["neil_johnson","cricketer"],["mohammad_yousuf","cricketer"],["duck","cricket"],["penalty_shootout","association_football"],["tommy_ross","striker"],["penalty","rugby"],["bullseye","target"],["alan_evans","darts_player"],["bingo","scrabble"],["triple_crown","disambiguation"],["turkey","bowling"]],"members":["tommy_ross","penalty_shootout","over","triple_crown","penalty","turkey","bingo","duck","neil_johnson","batting","bullseye","alan_evans","mohammad_yousuf"],"related":["Cricket","HH_Stephenson","Water_polo","Team_handball","National_Hockey_League","Batting_(cricket)","Over_(cricket)","Cricket_pitch","Innings","Test_cricket","Test_cricket_hat-tricks","Fred_Spofforth","Australian_cricket_team","English_cricket_team","Jimmy_Matthews","South_African_cricket_team","Hugh_Trumble","Pakistani_cricket_team","Wasim_Akram","Sri_Lankan_cricket_team","One_Day_International","One_Day_International_cricket_hat-tricks","Jalal-ud-Din_(cricketer)","Thisara_Perera","Sri_Lanka_cricket_team","Lasith_Malinga","Sri_Lanka_cricket_team","Lasith_Malinga","Wasim_Akram","Saqlain_Mushtaq","Pakistani_cricket_team","Chaminda_Vaas","Sri_Lankan_cricket_team","Wasim_Akram","Twenty20_International","Brett_Lee","Jacob_Oram","Tim_Southee","2007_Cricket_World_Cup","Sri_Lankan_cricket_team","Lasith_Malinga","South_African_cricket_team","Shaun_Pollock","Andrew_Hall","Jacques_Kallis","Makhaya_Ntini","First-class_cricket","Kevan_James","Hampshire_County_Cricket_Club","Cricinfo","Nuwan_Zoysa","Murray_Goodwin","Neil_Johnson_(cricketer)","Trevor_Gripper","Irfan_Pathan","Salman_Butt","Younis_Khan","Mohammad_Yousuf_(cricketer)","Karachi","Chaminda_Vaas","Hannan_Sarkar","Mohammad_Ashraful","Ehsanul_Haque","Pietermaritzburg","Albert_Trott","Joginder_Rao","Merv_Hughes","Curtly_Ambrose","Patrick_Patterson","Gordon_Greenidge","Test_cricket","Duck_(cricket)","Penalty_shootout_(association_football)","Tommy_Ross_(striker)","Ross_County_F.C.","Nairn_County_F.C.","FIFA_World_Cup_Final","Geoff_Hurst","1966_FIFA_World_Cup_Final","Alexander_Ovechkin","Field_hockey","Ice_hockey","National_Hockey_League","Toronto","Haberdasher","Toronto_Maple_Leafs","Stan_Mikita","Bobby_Hull","Chicago_Blackhawks","Syl_Apps","Charlie_Conacher","Norm_Ullman","Detroit_Red_Wings","Alex_Kaleta","Hockey_Hall_of_Fame","Guelph,_Ontario","Guelph_Biltmore_Mad_Hatters","Ontario_Hockey_Association","New_York_Rangers","Fedora","Montreal","Hatter","NHL","Montreal_Forum","Wayne_Gretzky","Bill_Mosienko","Junior_hockey","Duluth_Clydesdales","Iron_Range_Ironheads","Superior_International_Junior_Hockey_League","Gordie_Howe_hat_trick","Florida_Panthers","Scott_Mellanby","Rat_trick","John_Vanbiesbrouck","Rat","Hockey_stick","1996_Stanley_Cup_playoffs","List_of_players_with_five_or_more_goals_in_an_NHL_game","Hockey_Hall_of_Fame","Mario_Lemieux","Mario_Lemieux","Rugby_football","Rugby_union","Rugby_league","Try","Penalty_(rugby)","Drop_goal","Colorado_Mammoth","Gary_Gait","Anaheim_Storm","Bullseye_(target)","Alan_Evans_(darts_player)","Poker","Pole_position","Marbles","Scrabble","Bingo_(Scrabble)","Strikeout","Hitting_for_the_cycle","Nap_hand","Trifecta","Triple_Crown_(disambiguation)","Turkey_(bowling)"]}
