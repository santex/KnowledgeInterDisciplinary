{"cursor":"13783","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the 'Great Officers of State' are traditional Crown\nministers, who either inherit their positions or are appointed to exercise\ncertain largely ceremonial functions or operate as part of the government.\nSeparate Great Officers exist for England and Scotland, and formerly for\nIreland. Many of the Great Officers became largely ceremonial because\nhistorically they were so influential that their powers had to be resumed by the\nCrown or dissipated.\n\nGovernment in all the medieval monarchies generally comprised the king's\ncompanions, later becoming the royal household from which the officers of state\narose. Initially having household and governmental duties, later some of these\nofficers split into two counterparts in the Great Officer of the State and the\nroyal household, or where superseded by new officers or absorbed by existing\nofficers. This was due to many of the officers having become hereditary and thus\ntoo removed from practical operation of either the state or the household.\n","linknr":298,"url":"Great_Officers_of_State","recorded":1375084757,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Great_Officer_of_State&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Great_Officer_of_State&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","/wiki/Great_Officer_of_State","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","/w/index.php?title=Great_Officers_of_State&redirect=no","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Great_Offices_of_State","/wiki/Great_Officer_of_State_(disambiguation)","/wiki/United_Kingdom","/wiki/The_Crown","/wiki/England","/wiki/Scotland","/wiki/Ireland","#cite_note-eb-1","#cite_note-rh-2","#England_.28and_Wales.29","#Scotland","#Officers_of_State","#Officers_of_the_Crown","#Great_Officers_of_the_Royal_Household","#History","#Current_Great_Officers_of_State","#See_also","#References","/w/index.php?title=Great_Officer_of_State&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Kingdom_of_England","/wiki/England_and_Wales","#cite_note-eb-1","/wiki/Royal_Households_of_the_United_Kingdom","#cite_note-rh-2","/wiki/Lord_High_Steward","/wiki/Lord_Steward","/wiki/Lord_Chancellor","/wiki/Chris_Grayling","/wiki/Lord_High_Treasurer","/wiki/Lord_President_of_the_Council","/wiki/Nick_Clegg","/wiki/Lord_Privy_Seal","/wiki/Andrew_Lansley","/wiki/Lord_Great_Chamberlain","/wiki/David_George_Philip_Cholmondeley,_7th_Marquess_of_Cholmondeley","/wiki/Lord_Chamberlain","/wiki/Lord_High_Constable_of_England","/wiki/Master_of_the_Horse#Master_of_the_Horse_.28United_Kingdom.29","/wiki/Earl_Marshal","/wiki/Edward_Fitzalan-Howard,_18th_Duke_of_Norfolk","/wiki/Master_of_the_Horse#Master_of_the_Horse_.28United_Kingdom.29","/wiki/List_of_Lords_High_Admiral","/wiki/Prince_Philip,_Duke_of_Edinburgh","/wiki/Norman_conquest_of_England","/wiki/Duchy_of_Normandy","/wiki/Royal_Households_of_the_United_Kingdom","#cite_note-rh-2","/wiki/Lord_High_Steward","/wiki/Lord_Great_Chamberlain","/wiki/Justiciar","/wiki/Lord_High_Treasurer","#cite_note-rh-2","#cite_note-3","#cite_note-eb-1","/wiki/Earl_of_Leicester","/wiki/Coronation_of_the_British_monarch","/wiki/Peerage","#cite_note-4","/wiki/Earl_of_Oxford","#cite_note-5","/wiki/Earl_of_Hereford","/wiki/Attainder","#cite_note-6","/wiki/Duke_of_Norfolk","#cite_note-7","#cite_note-eb-1","#cite_note-8","/wiki/Prime_Minister","/wiki/Chancellor_of_the_Exchequer","/wiki/Whip_(politics)","#cite_note-9","/wiki/Leader_of_the_House_of_Commons","/wiki/Leader_of_the_House_of_Lords","#cite_note-eb-1","/wiki/Privy_Council","/wiki/Sinecure","/wiki/Ministry_of_Justice_(United_Kingdom)","/wiki/Lord_Chancellor%27s_Department","/wiki/Department_for_Constitutional_Affairs","/wiki/House_of_Lords_Act_1999","/w/index.php?title=Great_Officer_of_State&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Acts_of_Union_1707","/w/index.php?title=Great_Officer_of_State&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/Great_Seal_of_Scotland","/wiki/First_Minister_of_Scotland","/wiki/Keeper_of_the_Privy_Seal_of_Scotland","/wiki/Lord_Justice_General","/wiki/Lord_Clerk_Register","/wiki/Lord_Advocate","/wiki/Lord_Justice_Clerk","/wiki/Lord_Lyon_King_of_Arms","/w/index.php?title=Great_Officer_of_State&action=edit&section=4","/wiki/Great_Chamberlain","/wiki/Lord_High_Constable_of_Scotland","/wiki/Earl_Marischal","/wiki/Lord_High_Admiral_of_Scotland","/wiki/The_Knight_Marischal","/wiki/Lord_Lyon_King_of_Arms","/w/index.php?title=Great_Officer_of_State&action=edit&section=5","/wiki/Lord_High_Constable_of_Scotland","/wiki/The_Master_of_the_Household","/wiki/Palace_of_Holyroodhouse","/wiki/The_Armour-Bearer","/wiki/The_Bearer_of_the_Royal_Banner","/wiki/The_Bearer_of_the_National_Flag_of_Scotland","/wiki/Lord_Justice_General","/wiki/High_Steward_of_Scotland","/wiki/The_Master_Carver","/wiki/Hereditary_Keepers_of_Palaces_and_Castles","/wiki/Lord_Lyon","/wiki/Heralds","/wiki/Pursuivant","/wiki/Edinburgh_Castle","/wiki/Royal_Company_of_Archers","/wiki/Dean_of_the_Thistle","/wiki/Dean_of_the_Chapel_Royal","/wiki/Historiographer_Royal","/wiki/Botanist,_Scotland","/wiki/Painter_and_Limner","/wiki/Sculptor,_Scotland","/wiki/Astronomer_Royal_for_Scotland","/w/index.php?title=Great_Officer_of_State&action=edit&section=6","/wiki/Act_of_Union_1707","/wiki/Lord_Chancellor_of_Scotland","/wiki/Treasurer_of_Scotland","/wiki/Treasurer-depute_of_Scotland","/wiki/Secretary_of_State,_Scotland","/wiki/Master_of_Requests","/wiki/Pri
