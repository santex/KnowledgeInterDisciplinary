One example is the \"bloom\" or great\n increase of phytoplankton in a water body as a response to increased levels of\n nutrients. Negative environmental effects include hypoxia, the depletion of\n oxygen in the water, which induces reductions in specific fish and other animal\n populations. Other species (such as Nomura's jellyfish in Japanese waters) may\n experience an increase in population that negatively affects other species.\n","linknr":753,"url":"Eutrophication","recorded":1362482270,"links":65,"instances":["pollution","ecology","environmental","ecology","meteorology","pedology","freshwater_ecology","physiology","epidemiology"],"pdf":["http://www.cbd.int/doc/case-studies/inc/cs-inc-iucn-12-en.pdf","http://www.nature.org/ourinitiatives/regions/northamerica/oyster-restoration-study-kroeger.pdf","http://article.pubs.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/RPAS/rpv?hm=HInit&journal=cjfas&volume=66&calyLang=eng&afpf=f09-134.pdf"],"categories":["Water pollution","Environmental chemistry","Environmental issues with water","Aquatic ecology"],"headings":["Lakes and rivers","Ocean waters","Terrestrial ecosystems","Ecological effects","Sources of high nutrient runoff","Prevention and reversal","Cultural eutrophication","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/36/Potomac_green_water.JPG/170px-Potomac_green_water.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/Caspian_Sea_from_orbit.jpg/170px-Caspian_Sea_from_orbit.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Water_pollution.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/Estuary-mouth.jpg/140px-Estuary-mouth.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/Maldivesfish2.jpg/140px-Maldivesfish2.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["hypoxia","environmental"],["hypoxia","environmental"],["leaching","agriculture"],["biomass","ecology"],["respiration","physiology"],["hypoxia","environmental"],["dead_zone","ecology"],["vector","epidemiology"],["point_source","pollution"],["precipitation","meteorology"],["leaching","pedology"],["hypoxia","environmental"],["upland_and_lowland","freshwater_ecology"]],"members":["point_source","biomass","hypoxia","dead_zone","precipitation","leaching","upland_and_lowland","respiration","vector"],"related":["Cyanobacteria","Greek_language","Nitrate","Phosphate","Fertilizer","Sewage","Phytoplankton","Hypoxia_(environmental)","Nomura's_jellyfish","Species","Phytoplankton","Algal_bloom","Oxygen","Shellfish","Eutrophic","Water_treatment","World_Health_Organization","Water_pollution","Asia","Eutrophic","Europe","North_America","South_America","Africa","Paleolimnology","Meiotrophication","Barotse_Floodplain","Zambezi_River","Rainy_season","Hypoxia_(environmental)","Ecosystem","Agriculture","Septic_system","Sanitary_sewer","Nitrogen","Phosphorus","Phosphorus_cycle","Tonne","Nitrogen","Estuary","Algae","World_Resources_Institute","Nitrogen_fixation","Fen","Microbe","Nitrogen_fixation","Nitrate","Limiting_factor","Phosphorus","Soluble","Leaching_(agriculture)","Phosphorus","Caspian_Sea","Primary_production","Phytoplankton","Zooplankton","Biomass_(ecology)","Benthic","Epiphytic","Algae","Macrophyte","Turbidity","Oxygen_saturation","Fish_kill","Shellfish","Algal_bloom","Respiration_(physiology)","Photosynthesis","Hypoxia_(environmental)","Anaerobic_organism","Toxins","Dead_zone_(ecology)","Limiting_factor","Invasive_species","New_England","Salt_marsh","Algal_bloom","Toxic","Food_chain","Neurotoxin","Hepatotoxins","Shellfish","Paralysis","Diarrhea","Vector_(epidemiology)","Ciguatera","Nonpoint_source_pollution","Point_source_(pollution)","Season","Precipitation_(meteorology)","Act_of_god","Plough","Agriculture","Urban_planning","Soil","Phosphorus","Storm_drains","Surface_runoff","Leachate","Agriculture","Ammonia","Volatilization","Combustion","Fossil_fuels","Acid_rain","Stagnant_water","Wetlands","Ecosystem","Sustainable_agriculture","Finland","Oyster","Harmful_algal_blooms","Denitrification","Mussels","Riparian","Sediment","Treatment_of_sewage","Fertilizer","Leaching_(pedology)","Land_runoff","Phosphates","Nitrate","Estuaries","Algal_bloom","Water_pollution","Aquatic_plant","Coral_reef","Nutrient_pollution","Experimental_Lakes_Area","Ontario","Canada","Ecosystem_approach","Cultural_eutrophication","Algal_bloom","Anaerobic_digestion","Auxanography","Biodilution","Biogeochemical_cycle","Coastal_fish","Drainage_basin","Fish_kill","Hypoxia_(environmental)","Hypoxia_in_fish","Lake_Erie","Lake_ecosystem","Limnology","Nitrogen_cycle","No-till_farming","Outwelling","Phoslock","Riparian_zone","Upland_and_lowland_(freshwater_ecology)"]}
