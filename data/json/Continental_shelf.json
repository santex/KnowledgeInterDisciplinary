Much of the shelf was exposed during glacial periods,\nbut it is now submerged under relatively shallow seas (known as 'shelf seas')\nand gulfs and was similarly submerged during other interglacial periods.\n\nThe continental margin, between the continental shelf and the abyssal plain,\ncomprises a steep continental slope followed by the flatter continental rise.\nSediment from the continent above cascades down the slope and accumulates as a\npile of sediment at the base of the slope, called the continental rise.\nExtending as far as 500 km from the slope, it consists of thick sediments\ndeposited by turbidity currents from the shelf and slope. Pinet 39, Gross\n45. The continental rise's gradient is intermediate between the slope and\nthe shelf, on the order of 0.5â1Â°. Pinet 37.\n\nUnder the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, the name continental\nshelf was given a legal definition as the stretch of the seabed adjacent to the\nshores of a particular country to which it belongs.\n","linknr":633,"url":"Continental_shelf","recorded":1362372958,"links":83,"instances":["sea","island"],"pdf":["http://untreaty.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/conventions/8_1_1958_continental_shelf.pdf","http://www.iilj.org/publications/documents/CavnarESP15-09.pdf"],"categories":["Aquatic ecology","Fisheries","Physical oceanography","Aquatic biomes","Coastal geography","Coastal and oceanic landforms","Law of the sea","Continental shelves|"],"headings":["Geographical distribution","Topography","Sediments","Biota","Economic significance","See also","Notes","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d5/Southeastern_United_States_continental_shelf.jpg/220px-Southeastern_United_States_continental_shelf.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/93/Elevation.jpg/370px-Elevation.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/Continental_shelf.png/350px-Continental_shelf.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/Aegopodium_podagraria1_ies.jpg/32px-Aegopodium_podagraria1_ies.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Earth_flag_PD.jpg/32px-Earth_flag_PD.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/6b/Terrestrial_globe.svg/29px-Terrestrial_globe.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/94/Cloud.jpg/32px-Cloud.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Upwelling.svg/140px-Upwelling.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/Antarctic_bottom_water_hg.png/140px-Antarctic_bottom_water_hg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/48/Accreting_coast_Image6.svg/140px-Accreting_coast_Image6.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/58/Fernando_noronha.jpg/140px-Fernando_noronha.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["java","island"],["baseline","sea"],["baseline","sea"]],"members":["baseline","java"],"related":["Continent","Coastal_plain","Glacial_period","Sea","Bay","Ice_age","Continental_margin","Abyssal_plain","Sediment","Turbidity_current","Gradient","United_Nations_Convention_on_the_Law_of_the_Sea","Seabed","Oceanic_crust","Continental_crust","Subduction_zone","Chile","Sumatra","Siberian_Shelf","Arctic_Ocean","South_China_Sea","Sunda_Shelf","Borneo","Java_(island)","North_Sea","Persian_Gulf","Physiography","Ocean","Passive_continental_margin","Atlantic_Ocean","Active_continental_margin","Earthquakes","Abyssal_plain","Continental_margin","Geomorphology","Marine_biology","Submarine_canyon","Terrigenous","River","Pelagic_sediments","Abyssal_plain","Pelagic","Neritic_zone","Benthic","Sublittoral_zone","Anoxic_event","Geologic_time","Source_rock","Fossil_fuel","Hydrocarbon","Convention_on_the_Continental_Shelf","International_Law_Commission","United_Nations_Convention_on_the_Law_of_the_Sea","Continental_margin","Baseline_(sea)","Canary_Islands","Baseline_(sea)","Continental_Island","Continental_shelf_pump","Continental_shelf_of_Russia","Exclusive_economic_zone","International_waters","Land_bridge","Outer_Continental_Shelf","Region_of_Freshwater_Influence","Territorial_waters","Passive_margin"]}
