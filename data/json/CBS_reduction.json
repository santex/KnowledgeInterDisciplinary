{"cursor":"11932","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nThe 'Corey-Itsuno Reduction', also known as the 'Corey-Bakshi-Shibata (CBS)\nreduction', is a chemical reaction in which an achiral ketone is\nenantioselectively reduced to produce the corresponding chiral, non-racemic\nalcohol. The oxazaborolidine reagent which mediates the enantioselective\nreduction of ketones was previously developed by the laboratory of Itsuno and\nthus this transformation may more properly be called the Itsuno-Corey\noxazaborolidine reduction.\n\n\n\nIn 1981, Itsuno and coworkers first reported the use of chiral alkoxy-amine-\nborane complexes in reducing achiral ketones to chiral alcohols\nenantioselectively and in high yield. Several years\nlater in 1987, E. J. Corey and coworkers developed the reaction between chiral\namino alcohols and borane (BH 3), generating oxazaborolidine products\nwhich were shown to rapidly catalyze the enantioselective reduction of achiral\nketones in the presence of BH 3â¢THF.\n\nThe CBS Reduction has since been utilized by organic chemists as a reliable\nmethod for the asymmetric reduction of achiral ketones. Notably, it has found\nprominent use not only in a number of natural product syntheses, but has been\nutilized on large scale in industry (See Scope Below). Several reviews have been\npublished.\n","linknr":246,"url":"CBS_reduction","recorded":1362481958,"links":21,"instances":["chemistry","chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Name reactions","Organic redox reactions"],"headings":["Mechanism","Scope and Limitations","Variations","Applications","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/Overall_Rxn.png/400px-Overall_Rxn.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/62/Chem_Draw_Mechanism_TS.png/600px-Chem_Draw_Mechanism_TS.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e2/Scope_Rxn2.png/550px-Scope_Rxn2.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4e/Application_Rxn.png/450px-Application_Rxn.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["achiral","chemistry"],["chiral","chemistry"]],"members":["chiral","achiral"],"related":["Achiral_(chemistry)","Chiral_(chemistry)","Non-racemic","Enantioselective_reduction_of_ketones","Oxazaborolidine","Stereoselective","Chemoselective","Enone","Ynone","Heteroatoms","Enantiomeric_excesses","Diethylaniline","Borane","Midland_Alpine_Borane_Reduction","Noyori_asymmetric_hydrogenation"]}
