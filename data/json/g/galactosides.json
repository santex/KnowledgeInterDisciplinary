The H of the OH group on\ncarbon-1 of galactose is replaced by an organic moiety.\n\nDepending on whether the glycosidic bond lies \"above\" or \"below\" the plane of\nthe galactose molecule, galactosides are classified as Î±-galactosides or Î²-\ngalactosides.\n\nA Î²-galactoside is a type of galactoside in which the glycosidic bond lies above\nthe plane of the galactose residue. The most commonly recognized and used Î²-\ngalactoside in biochemistry is lactose. However, other chemicals, such as ONPG,\nare known, but these are typically synthesized for biochemical assays. An enzyme\nthat breaks the Î²-galactoside bond is called a Î²-galactosidase.\n","linknr":154,"url":"galactosides","recorded":1362512884,"links":20,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Galactosides|"],"headings":[],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/AlphaHelixSection.svg/40px-AlphaHelixSection.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Glycoside","Galactose","Galactose","Glycosidic_bond","Galactose","Lactose","ONPG","Β-galactosidase"]}
