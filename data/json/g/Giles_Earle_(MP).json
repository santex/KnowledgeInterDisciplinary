{"cursor":"6706","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Giles Earle' (1678 â 20 August 1758), was an English politician and wit.\n\nEarle came from a family resident at Crudwell, near Malmesbury. He served in\nearly life in the army, attaining to the rank of colonel, and was attached to\nJohn, the second duke of Argyll, who was distinguished both in war and in\npolitics. This connection had lasted in 1716 for twenty years, and was so marked\nthat Sir Robert Walpole, in a letter written in that year, styles him âthe Duke\nof Argyll's Erle.â On the accession of George I he plunged into political life,\nand in that king's first parliament (1715â22) sat for Chippenham.\n\nAt the general election of 1722 he succeeded on petition in establishing his\nright to represent the electors of Malmesbury, and he held the seat until 1747,\nwhen he was rejected and his parliamentary career terminated. Through his\nintimacy with the Duke of Argyll, who was Groom of the Stole to the Prince of\nWales, he exerted himself very actively in the autumn of 1716 in promoting\naddresses of congratulation from Gloucestershire and the adjacent counties to\nthe prince on his success as regent during the absence of George I in Hanover.\nFor his services in such matters Earle was rewarded in 1718 with the post of\ngroom of the prince's bedchamber; but he resigned this position in 1720, when\npublic differences broke out between the prince and his father.\n\nThe price of this desertion was promptly paid. He became clerk-comptroller of\nthe king's household at once, and in 1728 was made a commissioner of Irish\nrevenue. When Sir George Oxenden was deprived of his lordship of the treasury in\n1737, the vacant place was filled by Earle, and he retained its emoluments until\n1742. A soldier of fortune, his readiness to do the minister's bidding\ningratiated him with Walpole, and the coarseness of his humour made him an\nacceptable companion in the minister's happier hours of social life. Through the\npartiality of Walpole he filled the place of chairman of committees of election\nin the two parliaments from 1727 to 1741; but his covetous disposition had\nrendered him unpopular, and his strokes of wit, which he had freely exercised\nagainst the Scotch, turned into hatred the distrust with which they had always\nregarded him for his abandonment of the Duke of Argyll.\n\nLord Chesterfield, when Walpole's fall seemed probable, wrote, with evident\nallusion to Earle, that âthe court generally proposes some servile and shameless\ntool of theirs to be chairman of the committee of privileges and elections. Why\nshould not we therefore pick out some whig of a fair character and with personal\nconnections to oppose the ministerial nominee?â These tactics were adopted. The\nministry proposed Earle, though some thought that his unpopularity would have\nled to the selection of another candidate, and the opposition proposed Dr. Lee.\nThe struggle came off on 15 Dec. 1741, when Earle was beaten by four votes,\npolling 238 to 242 for his opponent, a result which showed the imprudence of\nWalpole's nomination. From that time Earle's name dropped out of notoriety. He\ndied at his seat, Eastcourt House, Crudwell, on 20 August 1758, aged 80.\n\nHe married Elizabeth, daughter of Sir William Rawlinson, knight, serjeant-at-\nlaw, and had issue Eleanor and William Rawlinson. The latter, who was also a\nmember of parliament and a placeman, died in 1774, aged 72, and was buried near\nhis sister in the vault of his grandfather at Hendon, Middlesex. A monument in\nCrudwell Church records the names of Giles Earle and his descendants to 1771.\nFrom a marriage license granted by the Bishop of London on 20 May 1702, it\nwould appear that the wife of Giles Earle died young, and that he proposed to\nmarry âMrs. Elizabeth Lowther, of St. Andrew, Holborn, widow, in chapel at\nChelsea College.â\n\nHis sordid nature and his broad jokes are the subject of universal comment, and\nhis jests are said to have been âset off by a whining tone, crabbed face, and\nvery laughing eyes.â Two dialogues between âGââs Eââe and Bââb Dâânâ (Earle and\nBubb Dodington) were published, one in l741, and the other in 1743; the former,\nwritten by Sir C. Hanbury Williams, conveyed a âlively image of Earle's style\nand sentiments,â and in both of them the shameless political conduct of this\npair of intriguers was vividly displayed. Three of Earle's letters to Mrs.\nHoward, afterwards the Countess of Suffolk, are in the âSuffolk Letters.â Lady\nMary Wortley Montagu speaks of him as âa facetious gentleman, vulgarly called\nTom Earle. â¦ His toast was always âGod bless you, whatever becomes of me.ââ\n","linknr":125,"url":"Giles_Earle_(MP)","recorded":1375067184,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Giles_Earle_(politician)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Giles_Earle_(politician)&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","/wiki/Giles_Earle_(politician)","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","/w/index.php?title=Giles_Earle_(MP)&redirect=no","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Crudwell","/wiki/Malmesbury","/wiki/John_Campbell,_2nd_Duke_of_Argyll","/wiki/Robert_Walpole","/wiki/George_I_of_Great_Britain","/wiki/Chippenham_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Malmesbury_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/John_Campbell,_2nd_Duke_of_Argyll","/wiki/Groom_of_the_Stole","/wiki/George_II_of_Great_Britain","/wiki/George_I_of_Great_Britain","/wiki/Sir_George_Oxenden,_5th_Baronet","/wiki/List_of_Lords_Commissioners_of_the_Treasury","/wiki/Robert_Walpole","/wiki/Lord_Chesterfield","/w/index.php?title=Sir_William_Rawlinson&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=William_Rawlinson_Earle&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Chelsea_College","/w/index.php?title=Giles_Earle_(politician)&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/File:Wikisource-logo.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/12px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png","/wiki/Public_domain","//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Earle,_Giles_(DNB00)","/wiki/Dictionary_of_National_Biography","/wiki/Parliament_of_Great_Britain","/wiki/Sir_John_Eyles,_2nd_Baronet","/w/index.php?title=John_Norris_(died_1752)&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Member_of_Parliament","/wiki/Chippenham_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Sir_John_Eyles,_2nd_Baronet","/wiki/Sir_John_Eyles,_2nd_Baronet","/w/index.php?title=Edward_Rolt&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Sir_John_Rushout,_4th_Baronet","/wiki/Trevor_Hill,_1st_Viscount_Hillsborough","/wiki/Member_of_Parliament","/wiki/Malmesbury_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/w/index.php?title=John_Fermor&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Charles_Stewart_(Royal_Navy_officer)","/w/index.php?title=William_Rawlinson_Earle&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/John_Lee_(1695%E2%80%931761)","/wiki/James_Douglas_(British_MP)","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Giles_Earle_(politician)&oldid=564799540","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1678_births","/wiki/Category:1758_deaths","/wiki/Category:English_politicians","/wiki/Category:18th-century_politicians","/wiki/Category:People_from_Malmesbury","/wiki/Category:Members_of_the_Parliament_of_Great_Britain_for_English_constituencies","/wiki/Category:British_MPs_1715%E2%80%931722","/wiki/Category:British_MPs_1722%E2%80%931727","/wiki/Category:British_MPs_1727%E2%80%931734","/wiki/Category:British_MPs_1734%E2%80%931741","/wiki/Category:British_MPs_1741%E2%80%931747","/wiki/Category:Articles_incorporating_DNB_text_with_Wikisource_reference","/wiki/Category:Use_dmy_dates_from_August_2011","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Giles+Earle+%28politician%29&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Giles+Earle+%28politician%29","/wiki/Giles_Earle_(politician)","/wiki/Talk:Giles_Earle_(politician)","#","/wiki/Giles_Earle_(politician)","/w/index.php?title=Giles_Earle_(politician)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Giles_Earle_(politician)&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Giles_Earle_(politician)","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Giles_Earle_(politician)","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Giles_Earle_(politician)&oldid=564799540","/w/index.php?title=Giles_Earle_(politician)&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki
