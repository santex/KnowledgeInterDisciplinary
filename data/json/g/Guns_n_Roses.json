The classic lineup as signed to Geffen Records in 1986,\nconsisted of vocalist Axl Rose, lead guitarist Slash, rhythm guitarist Izzy\nStradlin, bassist Duff McKagan and drummer Steven Adler. Today, Axl Rose is the\nonly remaining original member, in a lineup that comprises [[Use Your\nIllusion]]âera keyboardist Dizzy Reed, lead guitarists DJ Ashba and Ron\n\"Bumblefoot\" Thal, lead and rhythm guitarist Richard Fortus, bassist Tommy\nStinson, drummer Frank Ferrer and keyboardist Chris Pitman. The band released\nsix studio albums, accumulating sales of more than 100 million albums\nworldwide, including shipments of 45 million in the United\nStates.\n\nA year after its release, Guns N' Roses' debut album [[Appetite for\nDestruction]] (1987) reached No. 1 on the ''Billboard'' 200, on the\nstrength of the hit \"Sweet Child o' Mine\", their only single to reach No. 1\non the ''Billboard'' Hot 100. The\nalbum has sold in excess of 28 million copies worldwide, including 18 million units sold in the United\nStates, making it the best-selling debut album of all time in the U.S. The success of their debut was followed by the eight-\nsong album [[G N' R Lies]] (1988). The twin albums [[Use Your Illusion I]] and\n[[Use Your Illusion II]] (1991) debuted at No. 2 and No. 1 on the\nBillboard 200 and have sold a combined 35 million copies worldwide,\nincluding 14 million units sold in the United States alone. The cover album [[\"The Spaghetti Incident?\"]] (1993) was the band's last\nstudio album to feature Slash and McKagan. After more than a decade of work and\nmany lineup changes, Guns N' Roses released the long-awaited album [[Chinese\nDemocracy]] (2008) which, at an estimated fourteen million dollars in production\ncosts, made it the most expensive album to ever be produced in music\nhistory. It debuted at No. 3 on the\nBillboard 200 but underwhelmed industry expectations, despite mostly positive\ncritical reception.\n\nGuns N' Roses have been credited with reviving the mainstream popularity of rock\nmusic, at a time when popular music was dominated by dance music and pop\nmetal. Their late 1980s and early 1990s years\nhave been described as the period in which they brought forth a \"hedonistic\nrebelliousness\" reminiscent of the early Rolling Stones, a reputation that had earned them the nickname \"The Most\nDangerous Band in the World\". The band's classic lineup, along with\nlater members Reed and drummer Matt Sorum, were inducted into the Rock and Roll\nHall of Fame in 2012, their first year of eligibility.\n","linknr":1110,"url":"Guns_'n'_Roses","recorded":1362674998,"links":93,"instances":["photographer","manager","band","artist","band","montreal","band","musician","band","musician","band","band","band","band","musician","song","los_angeles","comedian","band","film_series","magazine","west_hollywood","producer","rolling_stones_song"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Guns
