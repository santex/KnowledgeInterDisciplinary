This field includes Women's studies (concerning women, feminism,\ngender, and politics), Men's studies, and LGBT studies. Sometimes Gender studies is offered together with Study of\nSexuality. These disciplines study gender and sexuality in the fields of\nliterature and language, history, political science, sociology, anthropology,\ncinema and media studies, human development, law, and medicine. It also analyses race, ethnicity, location, nationality,\nand disability. Healey, J. F. (2003).\n\"Race, Ethnicity, Gender and Class: the Sociology of Group Conflict and\nChange\".\n\nGender study has many different forms. One view exposed by the philosopher\nSimone de Beauvoir said: \"One is not born a woman, one becomes one\". de Beauvoir, S. (1949, 1989). \"The Second Sex\". This\nview proposes that in gender studies, the term \"gender\" should be used to refer\nto the social and cultural constructions of masculinities and femininities, not\nto the state of being male or female in its entirety. Garrett, S. (1992). \"Gender\", p. vii. However, this view is not\nheld by all gender theorists. Other areas of gender study closely examine the\nrole that the biological states of being male or female (anatomical,\nphysiological, and genetical explanations of male and female body parts,\nstructure and nature of functions of body organs, genetic carriers etc.) have on\nsocial constructs of gender. Specifically, in what way gender roles are defined\nby biology and how they are defined by cultural trends. The field emerged from a\nnumber of different areas: the sociology of the 1950s and later (see Sociology\nof gender); the theories of the psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan; and the work of\nfeminists such as Judith Butler.\n\nGender is an important area of study in many disciplines, such as literary\ntheory, drama studies, film theory, performance theory, contemporary art\nhistory, anthropology, sociology, psychology and psychoanalysis. These\ndisciplines sometimes differ in their approaches to how and why they study\ngender. For instance in anthropology, sociology and psychology, gender is often\nstudied as a practice, whereas in cultural studies representations of gender are\nmore often examined. In politics, gender can be viewed as a foundational\ndiscourse that political actors employ in order to position themselves on a\nvariety of issues. Salime, Zakia. Between Feminism and Islam: Human Rights\nand Sharia Law in Morocco. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press,\n2011. Gender studies is also a discipline in itself: an interdisciplinary\narea of study that incorporates methods and approaches from a wide range of\ndisciplines.\n\nEach field came to regard \"gender\" as a practice, sometimes referred to as\nsomething that is performative. Feminist\ntheory of psychoanalysis, articulated mainly by Julia Kristeva Anne-Marie\nSmith, Julia Kristeva: Speaking the Unspeakable (Pluto Press, 1988) (the\n\"semiotic\" and \"abjection\") and Bracha Ettinger Griselda Pollock,\n\"Inscriptions in the Feminine\" and \"Introduction\" to \"The With-In-Visible\nScreen\", in: Inside the Visible edited by Catherine de Zegher.

studies.\n","recorded":1362124466,"portal":[],"list":[],"links":"716","instances":["geography","politics","sexology","sexuality_and_gender","person","other_than_voting","sexual_slang","human_classification","judaism","international_relations","interdisciplinary","south_asia"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Critical
