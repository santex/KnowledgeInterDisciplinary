{"cursor":"21827","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n (1864), that established humane rules of war.]]\n\nThe 'Geneva Conventions' comprise four treaties, and three additional protocols,\nthat establish the standards of international law for the humanitarian treatment\nof war. The singular term Geneva Convention denotes the agreements of 1949,\nnegotiated in the aftermath of the Second World War (1939â45), which updated the\nterms of the first three treaties (1864, 1906, 1929), and added a fourth treaty.\nThe articles of the Fourth Geneva Convention (1949) extensively defined the\nbasic, wartime rights of prisoners (civil and military); established protections\nfor the wounded; and established protections for the civilians in and around a\nwar zone. The treaties of 1949 were ratified, in whole or with reservations, by\n194 countries. Moreover, the Geneva Convention also defines the\nrights and protections afforded to non-combatants, yet, because the Geneva\nConventions are about people in war, the articles do not address warfare proper\nâ the use of weapons of war â which is the subject of the Hague Conventions\n(First Hague Conference, 1899; Second Hague Conference 1907), and the\nbioâchemical warfare Geneva Protocol (Protocol for the Prohibition of the Use in\nWar of Asphyxiating, Poisonous or other Gases, and of Bacteriological Methods of\nWarfare, 1929).\n","linknr":520,"url":"Geneva_Conventions","recorded":1362567502,"links":80,"instances":["diplomacy","law"],"pdf":["http://www.ejil.org/pdfs/16/4/316.pdf","http://www.ejil.org/pdfs/16/4/316.pdf","http://www.humanrightsfirst.info/pdf/07801-etn-leave-no-marks.pdf"],"categories":["Geneva Conventions|"],"headings":["History","The conventions and their agreements","Application","Enforcement","The Geneva Conventions today","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d3/Original_Geneva_Conventions.jpg/250px-Original_Geneva_Conventions.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6e/Herter_-_In_the_name_of_mercy_give.jpg/200px-Herter_-_In_the_name_of_mercy_give.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/International_Criminal_Court_logo.svg/220px-International_Criminal_Court_logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9d/Wappen_Genf_matt.svg/22px-Wappen_Genf_matt.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/38px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/International_Criminal_Court_logo.svg/150px-International_Criminal_Court_logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["protocol","diplomacy"],["reservation","law"],["protocol","diplomacy"],["war_in_afghanistan","2001–present"]],"members":["war_in_afghanistan","protocol","reservation"],"related":["Treaty","Protocol_(diplomacy)","International_law","Humanitarian","War","World_War_II","Fourth_Geneva_Convention","Reservation_(law)","List_of_parties_to_the_Geneva_Conventions","Warfare","Weapon","Hague_Conventions_of_1899_and_1907","Biological_warfare","Chemical_warfare","Geneva_Protocol","Henry_Dunant","Government","Red_Cross","Geneva","Nobel_Peace_Prize","Switzerland","Baden","Belgium","Denmark","France","Hesse","Holland","Italy","Portugal","Prussia","Spain","Wurtemburg","Clara_Barton","United_States","World_War_II","War_crimes","Nuremberg_Trials","War","Cold_War","Asymmetric_warfare","Civilians","Hague_Conventions_of_1899_and_1907","Protective_sign","Emblems_of_the_International_Red_Cross_and_Red_Crescent_Movement","First_Geneva_Convention","Second_Geneva_Convention","Third_Geneva_Convention","Fourth_Geneva_Convention","Protocol_(diplomacy)","Protocol_I","Protocol_II","Protocol_III","Sovereignty","Declaration_of_war","Police_action","Protocol_I","Rules_of_war","Armed_conflicts","Protocol_II","Sovereign_State","Hostilities","United_Nations_Security_Council","Charter","UN_Charter","UN_Charter","War_crime","Right_to_a_fair_trial","War_Crimes_Act_of_1996","Command_responsibility","Universal_jurisdiction","UN_Security_Council","Authority","Jurisdiction","UN_Charter","UNSC","International_Criminal_Court","International_Criminal_Tribunal_for_Rwanda","International_Criminal_Tribunal_for_the_former_Yugoslavia","War_in_Afghanistan_(2001–present)","Hamdan_v._Rumsfeld","2003_invasion_of_Iraq","2008_War_in_Georgia","Syrian_Civil_War","Sri_Lankan_Civil_War","Second_Sudanese_Civil_War","Colombian_Armed_Conflict","International_Criminal_Tribunal_for_the_former_Yugoslavia","Customary_international_law","United_Nations","International_Court_of_Justice","List_of_parties_to_the_Geneva_Conventions","Attacks_on_humanitarian_workers","Civilian","Convention_on_Certain_Conventional_Weapons","Declaration_on_the_Protection_of_Women_and_Children_in_Emergency_and_Armed_Conflict","Geneva_Conference","Human_rights","International_Committee_of_the_Red_Cross","International_Federation_of_Red_Cross_and_Red_Crescent_Societies","International_humanitarian_law","Laws_of_war","Nuremberg_Principles","Reprisal","Rule_of_Law_in_Armed_Conflicts_Project","Targeted_killing","Ian_Fishback","German_Prisoners_of_War_in_the_United_States"]}
