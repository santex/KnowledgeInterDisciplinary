{"cursor":"2976","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nThe 'Goermans' (or 'Germain') family were French harpsichord makers of\nFlemish origin.\n\n'Jean Germain' I (or 'Joannes Goermans', as he signed his instruments) (1703 â\n18 February 1777) was born in Geldern, the Netherlands, and is known to have\nbeen working as a harpsichord maker in Paris by 1730, where he remained for the\nrest of his life. He had seven children: his daughter Jeanne-ThÃ©rÃ¨se was a\nharpist and friend of Jean-Philippe Rameau's patron La PoupliniÃ¨re. He retired\nin 1773 after starting to suffer from paralysis. At his death he was very rich,\nowning property worth 195,000 livres. His workshop was taken over by his son-in-\nlaw Jean Liborius HermÃ¨s.\n\n'Jean Germain' II (1735 â c.1795) was the eldest son of the above, and became\nknown as a dealer of harpsichords and harps as well as a harpsichord teacher. He\nlived in Paris. He dealt mainly in Flemish [[ravalement]]s of Ruckers\ninstruments, popular in France at the time; the adaptations to the original\nharpsichords included knee levers for changing stops, and an enlarged range. In\n1778 he advertised a Ruckers ravalement which went as far as 'producing the\neffect of the Flute, Oboe and Vox humana'.\n\n'Jacques Germain' (variants: 'Jacob Germain', 'Jacobus Goermans', 'Jacques\nGoermans') (c. 1740 â 8 April 1789) was the son of the first Jean Germain and\nfollowed him into the craft of harpsichord-making, living his life in Paris. He\nestablished a workshop in his father's house, becoming a master maker in 1766.\nHe made fortepianos after public taste started to favour them, and was an\nimportant early French maker of the instrument. After his death, HermÃ¨s took\nover the business as he had done with his father's. The production of pianos and\nharps continued until HermÃ¨s's death in 1813.\n\nSurviving Goermans harpsichords are in the French style; one of the most notable\nis the Goermans/Taskin in the Russell Collection, Edinburgh, which has been very\nhighly praised for its excellent sound and used by leading modern\nharpsichordists such as Trevor Pinnock for recordings of the French baroque\nrepertoire. A notable oddity produced by Jacques Goermans in 1782 was a\nharpsichord with 21 keys to the octave using a tuning system suggested by Jean-\nBenjamin de la Borde.\n","linknr":102,"url":"Goermans","recorded":1374761367,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Goermans&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Goermans&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Harpsichord","/wiki/Flanders","/wiki/Geldern","/wiki/The_Netherlands","/wiki/Paris","/wiki/Harp","/wiki/Jean-Philippe_Rameau","/w/index.php?title=La_Pouplini%C3%A8re&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Livres","/w/index.php?title=Jean_Liborius_Herm%C3%A8s&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Ravalement","/wiki/Ruckers","/wiki/Flute","/wiki/Oboe","/wiki/Vox_humana","/wiki/Master_craftsman","/wiki/Fortepiano","/wiki/Pascal_Taskin","/w/index.php?title=Russell_Collection&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Edinburgh","/wiki/Trevor_Pinnock","/wiki/Baroque_music","/wiki/Musical_keyboard","/wiki/Octave","/wiki/Musical_temperament","/w/index.php?title=Jean-Benjamin_de_la_Borde&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Goermans&action=edit&section=1","http://www.grovemusic.com/","/w/index.php?title=Goermans&action=edit&section=2","http://www.music.ed.ac.uk/russell/instruments/hd5jg176329/hd5jg176329.html","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Goermans&oldid=544805646","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Harpsichord_makers","/wiki/Category:Piano_makers","/wiki/Category:French_musical_instrument_makers","/wiki/Category:Belgian_musical_instrument_makers","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Goermans&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Goermans","/wiki/Goermans","/wiki/Talk:Goermans","#","/wiki/Goermans","/w/index.php?title=Goermans&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Goermans&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Goermans","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Goermans","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Goermans&oldid=544805646","/w/index.php?title=Goermans&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3159006","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Goermans&id=544805646","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Goermans","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Goermans&oldid=544805646&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Goermans&printable=yes","//fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Goermans","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3159006#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goermans","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Harpsichord
