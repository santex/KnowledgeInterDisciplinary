The conferences have been\nheld since 1931, and have expanded to almost 200 conferences per year.\nConference locations are chosen partly for their scenic and often isolated\nnature, to encourage an informal community atmosphere. Contributions are \"off-\nrecord\" to encourage free discussion, often of unpublished research. Conferences\nwere extended to cover science education in 1991. The conference\ntopics are regularly publicised in the journal [[Science (journal)|Science]]:\n2010, 2009,\n2008, 2007,\nand 2006. \n","linknr":151,"url":"Gordon_Research_Conferences","recorded":1362505039,"links":15,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Academic conferences"],"headings":["History","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/75/Science-symbol-2.svg/30px-Science-symbol-2.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Scientific_conference","Non-profit_organization","Biology","Chemistry","Physics","Science_education","Johns_Hopkins_University"]}
