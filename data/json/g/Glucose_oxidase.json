In cells,\nit aids in breaking the sugar down into its metabolites.\n\nGlucose oxidase is widely used for the determination of free glucose in body\nfluids (diagnostics), in vegetal raw material, and in the food industry. It also\nhas many applications in biotechnologies, typically enzyme assays for\nbiochemistry including biosensors in nanotechnologies.
