{"cursor":"38297","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nThe 'giant impact hypothesis' states that the Moon was formed out of the debris\nleft over from a collision between the Earth and a body the size of Mars,\napproximately 4.5 Gya (four and a half billion years ago). The colliding body is\nsometimes called Theia, for the mythical Greek Titan who was the mother of\nSelene, the goddess of the Moon.\n\nThe giant impact hypothesis is the currently-favoured scientific hypothesis for\nthe formation of the Moon. Supporting evidence includes:\nthe identical direction of the Earth's spin and the Moon's orbit, Moon samples that indicate the surface of the Moon was once\nmolten, the Moon's relatively small iron core, lower density compared to the\nEarth, evidence of similar collisions in other star systems (that result in\ndebris disks), and that giant collisions are consistent with the leading\ntheories of the formation of the solar system. Finally, the stable isotope\nratios of lunar and terrestrial rock are identical, implying a common\norigin.\n\nThere remain several questions concerning the best current models of the giant\nimpact hypothesis, however. The energy of such a giant impact is predicted to\nheat Earth to produce a global 'ocean' of magma; yet there is no evidence of the\nresultant planetary differentiation of the heavier material sinking into Earth's\nmantle. At present, there is no self-consistent model that starts with the giant\nimpact event and follows the evolution of the debris into a single moon. Other\nremaining questions include when the Moon lost its share of volatile elements\nand why Venus, which also experienced giant impacts during its formation, does\nnot host a similar moon.\n","linknr":619,"url":"Giant_impact_hypothesis","recorded":1362268752,"links":59,"instances":["astronomy","geology","geology","mythology","rotating_reference_frame"],"pdf":["http://www.es.ucsc.edu/~rcoe/eart206/canup_Moon_Nature_01.pdf","http://www.es.ucsc.edu/~rcoe/eart206/canup_Moon_Nature_01.pdf","http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/origin98/pdf/4045.pdf","http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/origin98/pdf/4045.pdf","http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc97/pdf/1070.PDF","http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc97/pdf/1070.PDF","http://www.ias.ac.in/jessci/dec2005/ilc-3.pdf","http://www.ias.ac.in/jessci/dec2005/ilc-3.pdf","http://www.geolsoc.org.uk/webdav/site/GSL/shared/pdfs/Geoscientist/Download%20PDF%20copy%20of%20Geoscientist%2019.9%20September%202009.pdf","http://www.geolsoc.org.uk/webdav/site/GSL/shared/pdfs/Geoscientist/Download%20PDF%20copy%20of%20Geoscientist%2019.9%20September%202009.pdf"],"categories":["Lunar science","Hypothetical impact events","Earth sciences","Solar System dynamic theories","Hypothetical bodies of the Solar System","Hypothetical planets"],"headings":["History of model","Theia","Basic model of impact","Energetic aftermath","Evidence","Difficulties","Possible origin of Theia","Modified hypothesis","Alternative hypotheses","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/Giantimpact.gif/270px-Giantimpact.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/BigSplashEnglish.svg/220px-BigSplashEnglish.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/Crab_Nebula.jpg/28px-Crab_Nebula.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/Earth-moon.jpg/32px-Earth-moon.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4d/Moon-Mdf-2005.jpg/28px-Moon-Mdf-2005.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e1/FullMoon2010.jpg/120px-FullMoon2010.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg/16px-Portal-puzzle.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg/16px-Portal-puzzle.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["titan","mythology"],["core","geology"],["centrifugal_force","rotating_reference_frame"],["core","geology"],["mantle","geology"],["trojan","astronomy"]],"members":["trojan","core","mantle","titan","centrifugal_force"],"related":["Moon","Earth","Mars","Gya","Titan_(mythology)","Selene","Scientific_hypothesis","Core_(geology)","Debris_disk","Nebular_hypothesis","Planetary_differentiation","Volatile_elements","Venus","George_Darwin","Centrifugal_force_(rotating_reference_frame)","Apollo_program","Russian_Federal_Space_Agency","Lunar_Laser_Ranging_experiment","Reginald_Aldworth_Daly","Harvard_University","William_Kenneth_Hartmann","Alastair_G._W._Cameron","William_R._Ward","Protoplanet","Greek_mythology","Theia","Selene","Oblique_angle","Core_(geology)","Mantle_(geology)","Ejecta","Computer_simulation","Angular_momentum","Mass","Coplanarity","Lagrange_point","Apollo_program","Apollo_Moon_landing","Oxygen","Isotope","Anorthositic","KREEP","Lunar_magma_ocean","Iron","Terrestrial_planet","Zinc","Mars","Zinc","Isotope_fractionation","Volatilization","Igneous","HD172555","Pleiades","BD_+20°307","Basalt","Angular_momentum","Princeton_University","Edward_Belbruno","J._Richard_Gott_III","Lagrangian_point","Trojan_asteroid","Trojan_(astronomy)","Far_side_of_the_Moon","Tidal_locking","ETH_Zürich","Centrifugal_force","Lunar_capture","Accretion_disk","Angular_momentum","Geology_of_the_Moon","Lunar_geologic_timescale","History_of_Earth","Geologic_time_scale","Roche_limit","William_K._Hartmann","Donald_R._Davis","International_Astronomical_Union","Cornell_University","Icarus","Alastair_GW_Cameron","William_R._Ward","John_Wiley_&_Sons"]}
