It measures densities of carbon dioxide and methane from 56,000\nlocations on the Earth's atmosphere. The GOSAT was\ndeveloped by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) and launched on\nJanuary 23, 2009, from the Tanegashima Space Center. Japan's\nMinistry of the Environment, and National Institute for Environmental Studies\n(NIES) http://www.nies.go.jp/ use the data to track gases causing the\ngreenhouse effect, and share the data with NASA and other international\nscientific organizations.\n","linknr":555,"url":"Greenhouse_Gases_Observing_Satellite","recorded":1362267785,"links":30,"instances":["japan","transportation"],"pdf":["http://www.gosat.nies.go.jp/eng/proposal/download/GOSAT_RA_A_en.pdf","http://www.gosat.nies.go.jp/eng/proposal/download/GOSAT_RA_A_en.pdf","http://www.jaxa.jp/countdown/f15/pdf/20090123_2255_e.pdf","http://www.jaxa.jp/countdown/f15/pdf/20090123_2255_e.pdf"],"categories":["2009 in spaceflight","Earth observation satellites","Greenhouse gases|*","Japanese satellites and space probes"],"headings":["Launch","Instruments","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["ministry_of_the_environment","japan"],["piggy-back","transportation"]],"members":["ministry_of_the_environment"],"related":["JAXA","Mitsubishi_Electric","Earth_observation_satellite","Earth","H-IIA","Tanegashima_Space_Center","Japanese_language","Earth_observation_satellite","Greenhouse-gas","Carbon_dioxide","Methane","Earth's_atmosphere","Japan_Aerospace_Exploration_Agency","Tanegashima_Space_Center","Japan","Ministry_of_the_Environment_(Japan)","National_Institute_for_Environmental_Studies","Greenhouse_effect","NASA","Piggy-back_(transportation)","H-IIA","Expendable_launch_system","Tanegashima","Infrared","Spectrometer","Orbiting_Carbon_Observatory","National_Institute_for_Environmental_Studies"]}
