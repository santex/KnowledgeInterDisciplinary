{"cursor":"4118","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The 'genotypeâphenotype distinction' is drawn in genetics. \"Genotype\" is an\norganism's full hereditary information. \"Phenotype\" is an organism's actual\nobserved properties, such as morphology, development, or behavior. This\ndistinction is fundamental in the study of inheritance of traits and their\nevolution.\n\nIt is the organism's physical properties which directly determine its chances of\nsurvival and reproductive output, while the inheritance of physical properties\noccurs only as a secondary consequence of the inheritance of genes. Therefore,\nto properly understand the theory of evolution via natural selection, one must\nunderstand the genotypeâphenotype distinction. The genes cause a trait, and the\nphenotype is the observable expression of the genes (and therefore the genotype\nthat affects the trait). Say a white mouse had the recessive genes that caused\nthe genes that cause the color of the mouse to be inactive (so \"cc\"). Its\ngenotype would be responsible for its phenotype (the white color).\n\nThe mapping of a set of genotypes to a set of phenotypes is sometimes referred\nto as the 'genotypeâphenotype map'.\n\nAn organism's genotype is a major (the largest by far for morphology)\ninfluencing factor in the development of its phenotype, but it is not the only\none. Even two organisms with identical genotypes normally differ in their\nphenotypes. One experiences this in everyday life with monozygous (i.e.\nidentical) twins. Identical twins share the same genotype, since their genomes\nare identical; but they never have the same phenotype, although their phenotypes\nmay be very similar. This is apparent in the fact that their mothers and close\nfriends can always tell them apart, even though others might not be able to see\nthe subtle differences. Further, identical twins can be distinguished by their\nfingerprints, which are never completely identical.\n\nThe concept of phenotypic plasticity describes the degree to which an organism's\nphenotype is determined by its genotype. A high level of plasticity means that\nenvironmental factors have a strong influence on the particular phenotype that\ndevelops. If there is little plasticity, the phenotype of an organism can be\nreliably predicted from knowledge of the genotype, regardless of environmental\npeculiarities during development. An example of high plasticity can be observed\nin larval newts 1: when these larvae sense the presence of predators\nsuch as dragonflies, they develop larger heads and tails relative to their body\nsize and display darker pigmentation. Larvae with these traits have a higher\nchance of survival when exposed to the predators, but grow more slowly than\nother phenotypes.\n\nIn contrast to phenotypic plasticity, the concept of genetic canalization\naddresses the extent to which an organism's phenotype allows conclusions about\nits genotype. A phenotype is said to be canalized if mutations (changes in the\ngenome) do not noticeably affect the physical properties of the organism. This\nmeans that a canalized phenotype may form from a large variety of different\ngenotypes, in which case it is not possible to exactly predict the genotype from\nknowledge of the phenotype (i.e. the genotype-phenotype map is not invertible).\nIf canalization is not present, small changes in the genome have an immediate\neffect on the phenotype that develops.\n\nThe terms \"genotype\" and \"phenotype\" were created by Wilhelm Johannsen in 1911.\n","linknr":133,"url":"Genotype-phenotype_distinction","recorded":1363439077,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Genotype-phenotype_distinction&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Genotype-phenotype_distinction&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/Genetics","/wiki/Genotype","/wiki/Hereditary","/wiki/Phenotype","/wiki/Morphology_(biology)","/wiki/Developmental_biology","/wiki/Behavior","/wiki/Biological_inheritance","/wiki/Trait_(biology)","/wiki/Evolution","/wiki/Natural_selection","/wiki/Map_(mathematics)","/wiki/File:PAX6_Phenotypes_Washington_etal_PLoSBiol_e1000247.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/14/PAX6_Phenotypes_Washington_etal_PLoSBiol_e1000247.png/400px-PAX6_Phenotypes_Washington_etal_PLoSBiol_e1000247.png","/wiki/File:PAX6_Phenotypes_Washington_etal_PLoSBiol_e1000247.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Morphology_(biology)","/wiki/Identical_twins","/wiki/Fingerprint","/wiki/Phenotypic_plasticity","/wiki/Environmental_factor","/wiki/Environment_(biophysical)","/wiki/Larva","/wiki/Newt","/wiki/Predator","/wiki/Dragonfly","/wiki/Pigmentation","/wiki/Survival_skills","/wiki/Canalisation_(genetics)","/wiki/Mutation","/wiki/Wilhelm_Johannsen","/w/index.php?title=Genotype-phenotype_distinction&action=edit&section=1","http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/genotype-phenotype/","/wiki/Template:Genarch","/wiki/Template_talk:Genarch","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Genarch&action=edit","/wiki/Morphogenesis","/wiki/Phenotype","/wiki/Norms_of_reaction","/wiki/Gene%E2%80%93environment_interaction","/wiki/Heritability","/wiki/Quantitative_genetics","/wiki/Genetic_architecture","/wiki/Dominance_(genetics)","/wiki/Epistasis","/wiki/Polygenic_inheritance","/wiki/Pleiotropy","/wiki/Phenotypic_plasticity","/wiki/Canalisation_(genetics)","/wiki/Fitness_landscape","/wiki/Transgressive_segregation","/wiki/Epigenetics","/wiki/Maternal_effect","/wiki/Dual_inheritance_theory","/wiki/Polyphenism","/wiki/Morphogenesis","/wiki/Segmentation_(biology)","/wiki/Modularity_(biology)","/wiki/Evolvability","/wiki/Mutational_robustness","/wiki/Evolution_of_sexual_reproduction","/wiki/Conrad_Hal_Waddington","/wiki/Richard_Lewontin","/wiki/Nature_versus_nurture","/wiki/Morphogenetic_field","/wiki/Index_of_evolutionary_biology_articles","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Genotype-phenotype_distinction&oldid=542203913","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Genetics","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Genotype-phenotype+distinction&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Genotype-phenotype+distinction","/wiki/Genotype-phenotype_distinction","/wiki/Talk:Genotype-phenotype_distinction","#","/wiki/Genotype-phenotype_distinction","/w/index.php?title=Genotype-phenotype_distinction&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Genotype-phenotype_distinction&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Genotype-phenotype_distinction","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Genotype-phenotype_distinction","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Genotype-phenotype_distinction&oldid=542203913","/w/index.php?title=Genotype-phenotype_distinction&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Genotype-phenotype_distinction&id=542203913","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Genotype-phenotype+distinction","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Genotype-phenotype+distinction&oldid=542203913&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Genotype-phenotype_distinction&printable=yes","//no.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype_og_fenotype","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:ItemBy
