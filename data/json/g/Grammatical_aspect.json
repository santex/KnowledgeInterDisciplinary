{"cursor":"41876","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Aspect' is a grammatical category that expresses how an action, event or state,\ndenoted by a verb, relates to the flow of time.\n\nA basic aspectual distinction is that between perfective and imperfective\naspects (not to be confused with perfect and imperfect verb forms; the meanings\nof the latter terms are somewhat different). Perfective aspect is used in\nreferring to an event conceived as bounded and unitary, without reference to any\nflow of time during it (\"I killed him\"). Imperfective aspect is used for\nsituations conceived as existing continuously or repetitively as time flows (\"I\nwas killing him\"; \"I used to kill people\"). Further distinctions can be made,\nfor example, to distinguish states and ongoing actions (continuous and\nprogressive aspects) from repetitive actions (habitual aspect).\n\nCertain aspectual distinctions express a relation in time between the event and\nthe time of reference. This is the case with the perfect aspect, which indicates\nthat an event occurred prior to (but has continuing relevance at) the time of\nreference: \"I have eaten\"; \"I had eaten\"; \"I will have eaten\".\n\nDifferent languages make different grammatical aspectual distinctions; some\n(such as Standard German; see below) do not make any. The marking of aspect is\noften conflated with the marking of tense and mood (see tenseâaspectâmood).\nAspectual distinctions may be restricted to certain tenses: in Latin and the\nRomance languages, for example, the perfectiveâimperfective distinction is\nmarked in the past tense, by the division between imperfects and preterites.\nExplicit consideration of aspect as a category first arose out of study of the\nSlavic languages; here verbs often occur in the language in pairs, with two\nrelated verbs being used respectively for imperfective and perfective meanings.\n","linknr":444,"url":"Grammatical_aspect","recorded":1362899136,"links":51,"instances":["grammatical_category","grammar","linguistics","linguistics","linguistics"],"pdf":["https://netfiles.uiuc.edu/tionin/www/MyDownloads/gabriele_2003.pdf","https://netfiles.uiuc.edu/tionin/www/MyDownloads/gabriele_2003.pdf"],"categories":["Grammatical aspects|"],"headings":["Basic concept","Common aspectual distinctions","Aspect vs. tense","Lexical vs. grammatical aspect","Indicating aspect","Aspect by language","Terms for various aspects","See also","Notes","Other references","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["perfect","grammar"],["boundedness","linguistics"],["perfect","grammar#perfect_as_aspect"],["marker","linguistics"],["perfect","grammar"],["morphology","linguistics"],["morphology","linguistics"],["morphology","linguistics"],["perfect","grammar"],["perfect","grammar"],["transitivity","grammatical_category"],["perfect","grammar"]],"members":["transitivity","perfect","marker","boundedness","morphology"],"related":["Grammatical_category","Verb","Perfective","Imperfective","Perfect_(grammar)","Imperfect","Boundedness_(linguistics)","Stative_verb","Continuous_and_progressive_aspects","Habitual_aspect","Standard_German","Grammatical_tense","Grammatical_mood","Tense–aspect–mood","Latin","Romance_languages","Past_tense","Imperfect","Preterite","Slavic_languages","Yaska","Slavic_languages","Oxford_English_Dictionary","Grammatical_tense","Present_tense","Language","Inflection","Marker_(linguistics)","K'iche'_language","Standard_Mandarin","Adverb","Continuous_aspect","Present_participle","Perfect_(grammar)","Past_participle","Morphology_(linguistics)","Auxiliary_verb","Syntax","Lexical_aspect","Morphology_(linguistics)","Aorist","Greek_language","Simple_past","Germanic_languages","Grammatical_tense","Perfective_and_imperfective","Pluperfect","Past_anterior","Aorist","Preterite","Mandarin_Chinese","Lexical_aspect","Semelfactive","German_language","Slavist","Athabaskan_languages","Telicity","Semelfactive","Chinese_language","American_Sign_Language","Indo-European_languages","Slavic_languages","Russian_language","Morphology_(linguistics)","Auxiliary_verb","Arabic_language","Prospective_aspect","Esperanto","Perfect_(grammar)","Auxiliary_verb","Will_future","Shall","Adverb","Progressive_aspect","Perfect_(grammar)","Present_simple","Present_progressive","Present_perfect","Present_perfect_progressive","Past_simple","Past_progressive","Past_perfect","Past_perfect_progressive","Non-finite_verb","Infinitive","Present_participle","Gerund","English_modal_verbs","Simple_future","Simple_conditional","Future_progressive","Conditional_progressive","Future_perfect","Conditional_perfect","Future_perfect_progressive","Conditional_perfect_progressive","Moscow","Illocutionary_act","Uses_of_English_verb_forms","Habitual_aspect","Prospective_aspect","African-American_Vernacular_English","Habitual_be","English-based_creole_language","Hawaiian_Creole_English","Standard_German","Upper_German_languages","West_Central_German","Regiolect","Continuous_aspect","Slavic_languages","Lexical_aspect","Suppletion","Polish_language","Dictionary_form","Russian_language","Habitual_aspect","Progressive_aspect","Latin_language","Prospective","Continuous_aspect","Progressive_aspect","Finnish_language","Estonian_language","Telicity","List_of_grammatical_cases","Accusative","Partitive","Frequentative","Momentane","Causative","Inchoative","Transitivity_(grammatical_category)","Austronesian_languages","Philippine_languages","Philippine_languages","Filipino_language","Tagalog_language","Hawaiian_language","Östen_Dahl","Creole_language","Atlantic_Creole","Jamaican_Creole","Haitian_Creole","Tok_Pisin","American_Sign_Language","Perfective_aspect","Momentane","Perfect_(grammar)","Recent_perfect","Hiberno-English","Prospective_aspect","Imperfective_aspect","Continuous_aspect","Progressive_aspect","Stative_verb","Habitual_aspect","Gnomic_aspect","Episodic_aspect","Continuative_aspect","Inceptive","Inchoative","Terminative_aspect","Cessative_aspect","Defective_aspect","Pausative_aspect","Resumptive_aspect","Punctual_aspect","Durative_aspect","Delimitative_aspect","Protractive_aspect","Iterative_aspect","Frequentative","Experiential_aspect","Intentional_aspect","Accidental_aspect","Intensive","Moderative_aspect","Attenuative_aspect","Aktionsart","Grammatical_conjugation","Grammatical_tense","Grammatical_mood","Nominal_TAM","Tense–aspect–mood","German_language","Stuttgart"]}
