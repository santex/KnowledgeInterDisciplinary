It was first named by K.J.\nTravouillon, Y. Gurovich, R.M.D. Beck and J. Muirhead in 2010 and the type\nspecies is Galadi speciosus; additional three species, G. adversus, G. amplus\nand G. grandis, were described in 2013. The genus is represented by three well-\npreserved skulls and several isolated maxillae and dentaries. Its body mass\nwould have been close to two pounds, making it relatively large for its family.\nThe combination of body size, robustness and short, stout skull indicates that\nGaladi would have been able to take relatively large prey for its size, though\nthe morphology of its molars indicates it may have been omnivorous.\n","linknr":113,"url":"galadi","recorded":1362512883,"links":14,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Peramelemorphs","Oligocene marsupials","Prehistoric mammals of Australia","Miocene marsupials","Fossil taxa described in 2010"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/45/Composite_Nimbadon_lavarackorum_skeleton_from_AL90%2C_Riversleigh_-_journal.pone.0048213.g001.png/40px-Composite_Nimbadon_lavarackorum_skeleton_from_AL90%2C_Riversleigh_-_journal.pone.0048213.g001.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Oligocene","Miocene","Animal","Chordate","Mammal","Marsupial","Peramelemorphia","2010_in_paleontology","Species","Type_species","2013_in_paleontology","Genus","Predatory","Bandicoot","Miocene","Riversleigh","Australia","Omnivorous"]}
