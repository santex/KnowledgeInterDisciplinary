When a model of such\nsocial behavior includes such social structure, and when the calculation of the\nfitness of individuals is treated as dependent upon the structure of the group\nin which the individuals are located, we speak of 'group selection' in\nevolutionary biology. Group selection in this sense is often called multi-level\nselection, because it posits social organization with a complexity above dyadic\ninteractions of individuals. It is often maintained by critics of the notion\nthat group selection asserts that a behavior can spread in a population because\nof the benefits they bestow on groups even though they cause the individuals who\nexhibit this behavior, as a whole, sacrifice fitness by aiding the group.\nEvolutionary genetics does not allow for this possibility, and modern theories\nof group selection are completely compatible with modern population genetics.\n\nGroup selection was used as a popular explanation for adaptations, especially by\nV.

Perrins (1964), cast serious\ndoubt on group selection as a major mechanism of evolution, and though some\nscientists have pursued the idea over the last few decades, only since the mid\n1990s have group selection models seen a resurgence.
