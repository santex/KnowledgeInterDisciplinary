Gestures include movement of the hands,\n face, or other parts of the body. Gestures differ from physical non-verbal\n communication that does not communicate specific messages, such as purely\n expressive displays, proxemics, or displays of joint attention. Kendon, Adam. (2004) Gesture: Visible Action as Utterance.\n Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. ISBN 0-521-83525-9 Gestures allow\n individuals to communicate a variety of feelings and thoughts, from contempt\n and hostility to approval and affection, often together with body language in\n addition to words when they speak.\n\nGesture processing takes place in areas of the brain such as Broca's and\nWernicke's areas, which are used by speech and sign language.
