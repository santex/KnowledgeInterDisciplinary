{"cursor":"35463","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nA 'graduate school' is a school that awards advanced academic degrees (i.e.\nmaster's and doctoral degrees) with the general requirement that students must\nhave earned a previous undergraduate (bachelor's) degree. http://www.grad.w-\nisc.edu/education/admissions/requirements.html http://wordnetweb.prin-\nceton.edu/perl/webwn?s=graduate%20school A distinction is typically made\nbetween graduate schools (where courses of study do not provide training for a\nparticular profession) and professional schools, which offer specialized\nadvanced degrees in professional fields such as medicine, business, engineering,\nministry or law.\n\nMany universities award graduate degrees; a graduate school is not necessarily a\nseparate institution. While the term \"graduate school\" is typical in the United\nStates and often used elsewhere (e.g., the UK and Canada), \"postgraduate\neducation\" is also used in some English-speaking countries (Australia, Canada,\nIreland, India, New Zealand, Pakistan and the UK) to refer to the spectrum of\neducation beyond a bachelor's degree. Those attending graduate schools are\ncalled \"graduate students\" (in both American and British English), or often in\nBritish English as \"postgraduate students\" and, colloquially, \"postgraduates\"\nand \"postgrads\". Degrees awarded to graduate students include master's degrees,\ndoctoral degrees, and other postgraduate qualifications such as graduate\ncertificates and professional degrees.\n\nProducing original research is often a significant component of graduate\nstudies, including the writing and defense of a thesis or dissertation. The\nterm \"graduate school\" is primarily North American. Additionally, in North\nAmerica, the term does not usually refer to medical school (whose students are\ncalled \"medical students\"), and only occasionally refers to law school or\nbusiness school. (The latter types of programs are often collectively termed\nprofessional schools).\n\nAlthough graduate school programs are distinct experiences from undergraduate\ndegree programs, graduate instruction (in Australia, the United States, and\nother countries) is often offered by some of the same senior academic staff and\ndepartments that teach undergraduate courses. Unlike in undergraduate programs,\nhowever, it is rare for graduate students to take coursework outside their\nspecific field of study at graduate or graduate entry level. At the Ph.D. level,\nthough, it is quite common to take courses from a wider range of study, for\nwhich some fixed portion of coursework, sometimes known as a residency, is\ntypically required to be taken from outside the department and college of the\ndegree-seeking candidate, to broaden the research abilities of the student. Some\ninstitutions designate separate graduate versus undergraduate staff and denote\nother divisions (often called School of X, e.g., diplomacy)\n","linknr":425,"url":"Graduate_students","recorded":1362504000,"links":31,"instances":["document","division","education"],"pdf":["http://ifap.ed.gov/sfahandbooks/attachments/0708FSAHBKVol1Ch2.pdf","http://www.yaleunions.org/geso/reports/BlackboardBlues.pdf","http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~harchol/gradschooltalk.pdf","http://web.pdx.edu/~obrienk/gradschool%20advice.pdf"],"categories":["Postgraduate schools|","School types"],"headings":["Australia","Brazil","Canada","France","Germany","United Kingdom","United States","See also","Notes","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0b/Platopainting.jpg/23px-Platopainting.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/12px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["transcript","education"],["faculty","division"],["visa","document"]],"members":["visa","faculty","transcript"],"related":["School","Academic_degree","Master's_degree","Doctorate","Undergraduate_education","Bachelor's_degree","Professional_school","Medicine","Business","Engineering","Christian_ministry","Law","University","Postgraduate_education","American_English","British_English","Doctorate","Professional_degree","Original_research","Thesis_or_dissertation","North_America","Medical_school","Law_school","Business_school","Professional_school","Australia","United_States","Coursework","Graduate_entry","College","Academic_grading_in_Canada","Letter_grade","Research_proposal","TOEFL","Student_loans_in_Canada","Teaching_assistant","Research_assistant","Transcript_(education)","Scholarship","Bursary","Coursework","Faculty_(division)","Thesis","Comprehensive_examination","Japanese_language","Standard_Mandarin","Classical_Chinese","Classical_Japanese_language","German_language","German_literature","Deutsche_Forschungsgemeinschaft","German_Universities_Excellence_Initiative","University_of_Birmingham","Durham_University","Keele_University","University_of_Nottingham","Bournemouth_University","University_of_London","King's_College_London","Royal_Holloway","University_College_London","Doctorates","Graduate_Record_Examination","Standardized_test","Graduate_Management_Admission_Test","Recommendation_letter","Statement_of_purpose","Letter_of_Intent","Grade_point_average","TOEFL","All_but_dissertation","Master_of_Philosophy","Candidate_of_Philosophy","Comprehensive_examination","Lecturer","Prelims","Astronomy","Observational_astronomy","Theoretical_astronomy","Humanities","Social_science","Natural_science","Doctorate","Archaeology","National_Research_Service_Award","NIH","Biotechnology_Training_Program_â€“_University_of_Virginia","National_Science_Foundation","United_States_Department_of_Defense","United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency","German_Marshall_Fund","Social_Science_Research_Council","Immigration_law","Visa_(document)","U.S._Citizenship_and_Immigration_Services","Surveillance","Student_and_Exchange_Visitor_Program","United_States_Department_of_Homeland_Security","Labor_union","Canadian_Union_of_Public_Employees","Coalition_of_Graduate_Employee_Unions","National_Labor_Relations_Act","Michigan","Central_Michigan_University","Michigan_State_University","University_of_Michigan","Wayne_State_University","Western_Michigan_University","United_Auto_Workers","American_Federation_of_Teachers","Strike_action","Teach-in","EURODOC","List_of_fields_of_doctoral_studies","List_of_postgraduate-only_institutions","Professional_association","Professional_certification","Carnegie_Mellon","MIT","Portland_State_University"]}
