{"cursor":"7608","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Group captain' ('Gp Capt' or 'Grp Cpt' in the RAF and IAF, 'GPCAPT' in the\nRNZAF and RAAF, formerly 'G/C' in the RCAF) is a senior commissioned rank in the\nRoyal Air Force and the air forces of many other Commonwealth\ncountries. It ranks above wing commander and immediately below air commodore.\nThe name of the rank is the complete phrase, and is never shortened to\n\"captain\".\n\n It has a NATO ranking code of OF-5, and is equivalent to a captain in the\nRoyal Navy or a colonel in the British Army or the Royal Marines. Group captain\nis the rank usually held by the station commander of a large RAF station.\n\nThe equivalent rank in the Women's Auxiliary Air Force (WAAF), Women's Auxiliary\nAustralian Air Force (WAAAF), Women's Royal Air Force (WRAF) (until 1968) and\nPrincess Mary's Royal Air Force Nursing Service (PMRAFNS) (until 1980) was\n'group officer'. The equivalent rank in the Royal Observer Corps (until 1995)\nwas 'observer captain' which had a similar rank insignia.\n","linknr":314,"url":"Group_Captain","recorded":1362477196,"links":25,"instances":["air_force_unit","uniform","royal_navy","rank","rank","group_captain"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Military ranks of Pakistan","Military ranks of the Commonwealth","Military ranks of Australia","Military ranks of Canada","Military ranks of India","Military ranks of the Royal Air Force","Air force ranks"],"headings":["Origins","Use","Insignia and command pennant","Other air forces","Notable group captains","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cc/UK-Air-OF5.svg/150px-UK-Air-OF5.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cc/UK-Air-OF5.svg/65px-UK-Air-OF5.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f0/File-UK-Air-OF5-mess-insignia.svg/65px-File-UK-Air-OF5-mess-insignia.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b9/UK-Air-OF5-Flag.svg/120px-UK-Air-OF5-Flag.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/eb/RAF-Gp_Capt-OF-5.png/120px-RAF-Gp_Capt-OF-5.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/RAAF_O6_rank.png/75px-RAAF_O6_rank.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Hellenic_Air_Force_OF-5.svg/72px-Hellenic_Air_Force_OF-5.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/Gp_Capt.png/77px-Gp_Capt.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/Group_Captain_of_IAF.png/65px-Group_Captain_of_IAF.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/Thai_air_O5.png/54px-Thai_air_O5.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["wing_commander","rank"],["captain","royal_navy"],["group","air_force_unit"],["group","air_force_unit"],["scrambled_egg","uniform"],["commodore","rank"],["peter_townsend","group_captain"]],"members":["group","scrambled_egg","captain","wing_commander","commodore","peter_townsend"],"related":["Royal_Air_Force","Indian_Air_Force","RNZAF","RAAF","Royal_Canadian_Air_Force","Royal_Air_Force","Commonwealth_of_Nations","Wing_commander_(rank)","Air_commodore","NATO","Captain_(Royal_Navy)","Royal_Navy","Colonel","British_Army","Royal_Marines","Women's_Auxiliary_Air_Force","Women's_Auxiliary_Australian_Air_Force","Women's_Royal_Air_Force","Princess_Mary's_Royal_Air_Force_Nursing_Service","Royal_Observer_Corps","British_Army","Royal_Naval_Air_Service","Royal_Flying_Corps","Royal_Navy","Admiralty","Group_(air_force_unit)","Group_(air_force_unit)","Air_officer","RAF_station","Expeditionary_air_wing","Insignia","Scrambled_egg_(uniform)","Commonwealth_of_Nations","Bangladesh_Air_Force","Ghana_Air_Force","Indian_Air_Force","Nigerian_Air_Force","Pakistan_Air_Force","Royal_Australian_Air_Force","Royal_New_Zealand_Air_Force","Sri_Lankan_Air_Force","Republic_of_Singapore_Air_Force","Egyptian_Air_Force","Hellenic_Air_Force","Royal_Air_Force_of_Oman","Royal_Thai_Air_Force","Royal_Canadian_Air_Force","Canadian_Forces","Colonel","Argentine_Air_Force","Commodore_(rank)","Chilean_Air_Force","RAAF","Hellenic_Air_Force","Pakistan_Air_Force","Indian_Air_Force","Royal_Thai_Air_Force","Leonard_Cheshire","Victoria_Cross","Douglas_Bader","Peter_Townsend_(Group_Captain)","Princess_Margaret,_Countess_of_Snowdon","Hugh_Dundas","James_Stagg","Meteorologist","D-Day","Thomas_\"Loel\"_Guinness","Peter_Sellers","Sachin_Tendulkar","Captain_Jack_Harkness","Doctor_Who","Torchwood","Geoffrey_Flindell_Wood","Comparative_military_ranks"]}
