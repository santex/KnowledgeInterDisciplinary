{"cursor":"1105","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Gene redundancy' is the existence of several genes in the genome of an organism\nthat perform the same role to some extent. This is the case for many sets of\nparalogous genes. When an individual gene in such a set is disrupted by mutation\nor targeted knockout, there can be little effect on phenotype as a result of\ngene redundancy, whereas the effect is large for double or triple gene\nknockouts.\n","linknr":92,"url":"Gene_redundancy","recorded":1362374194,"links":13,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Genetics"],"headings":["References","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/DNA_stub.png/40px-DNA_stub.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Paralogous","Gene_knockout","Phenotype"]}
