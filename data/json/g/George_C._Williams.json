He was best known for his vigorous critique of group\nselection. The work of Williams in this area, along with W. D. Hamilton, John\nMaynard Smith and others led to the development of a gene-centric view of\nevolution in the 1960s.\n","linknr":199,"url":"George_C._Williams","recorded":1362374141,"links":25,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://life.bio.sunysb.edu/ee/upload/williams.pdf"],"categories":["1926 births","American biologists","Evolutionary biologists","Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences","State University of New York faculty","University of California, Los Angeles alumni","Guggenheim Fellows","2010 deaths","Deaths from Parkinson's disease","National Academy of Sciences laureates","Biogerontologists"],"headings":["Academic work","Academic career","Books","Selected papers","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/42/George_C._Williams.jpg/150px-George_C._Williams.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Charlotte,_North_Carolina","United_States","UCLA","Charles_Darwin","Richard_Dawkins","Daniel_Giraud_Elliot_Medal","Crafoord_Prize","United_States","Evolutionary_biologist","Professor_emeritus","Biology","State_University_of_New_York_at_Stony_Brook","Group_selection","W._D._Hamilton","John_Maynard_Smith","Gene-centric_view_of_evolution","Antagonistic_pleiotropy","Senescence","Natural_selection","John_Maynard_Smith","Nature_Magazine","Grandmother_hypothesis","Inclusive_fitness","Adaptation","Selection","Genes","Richard_Dawkins","Evolution_of_sex","Evolutionary_medicine","Doctor_of_Philosophy","University_of_California_at_Los_Angeles","Marine_biology","Vertebrate","Zoology","Ichthyological","Daniel_Giraud_Elliot_Medal","United_States_National_Academy_of_Sciences","Crafoord_Prize","Ernst_Mayr","John_Maynard_Smith","Carl_Zimmer"]}
