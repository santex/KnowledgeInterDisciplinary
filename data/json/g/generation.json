In kinship terminology, it is a structural term\ndesignating the parent-child relationship. The term is also often used\nsynonymously with [[cohort]] in social science, even though some researchers\nbelieve that this usage is misleading; under this formulation the term means\n\"people within a delineated population who experience the same significant\nevents within a given period of time.\"<ref name=Pilcher></ref> Generation in\nthis sense of birth cohort, also known as a \"social generation,\" is widely used\nin popular culture, and has been the basis for much social analysis. Serious\nanalysis of generations began in the century, emerging from an increasing\nawareness of the possibility of permanent social change and the idea of youthful\nrebellion against the established social order. Some analysts believe that a\ngeneration is one of the fundamental social categories in a society, while\nothers view its importance as being overshadowed by other factors such as class,\ngender, race, education and so on.\n",
