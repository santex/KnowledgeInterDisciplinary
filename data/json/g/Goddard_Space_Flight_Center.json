Langley Research Center, however, is NASA's oldest field\ncenter GSFC employs approximately 10,000 civil servants and contractors,\nand is located approximately northeast of Washington, D.C. in Greenbelt,\nMaryland, USA. GSFC, one of ten major NASA field centers, is named in\nrecognition of Dr. Robert H. Goddard (1882â1945), the pioneer of modern rocket\npropulsion in the United States.\n\nGSFC is the largest combined organization of scientists and engineers in the\nUnited States dedicated to increasing knowledge of the Earth, the Solar System,\nand the Universe via observations from space. GSFC is a major U.S. laboratory\nfor developing and operating unmanned scientific spacecraft. GSFC conducts\nscientific investigation, development and operation of space systems, and\ndevelopment of related technologies. Goddard scientists can develop and support\na mission, and Goddard engineers and technicians can design and build the\nspacecraft for that mission. Goddard scientist John C. Mather shared the 2006\nNobel Prize in Physics for his work on COBE.\n\nGSFC also operates two spaceflight tracking and data acquisition networks (the\nSpace Network and the Near Earth Network), develops and maintains advanced space\nand Earth science data information systems, and develops satellite systems for\nthe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).\n\nGSFC manages operations for many NASA and international missions including the\nHubble Space Telescope (HST), the Explorer program, the Discovery Program, the\nEarth Observing System (EOS), [[INTEGRAL]], the Solar and Heliospheric\nObservatory (SOHO), the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) and [[Swift Gamma-Ray\nBurst Mission|Swift]]. Past missions managed by GSFC include the Compton Gamma\nRay Observatory, [[Solar Maximum Mission|SMM]], [[Cosmic Background\nExplorer|COBE]], [[IUE]], and [[ROSAT]]. Typically, unmanned earth observation\nmissions and observatories in Earth orbit are managed by GSFC, while unmanned\nplanetary missions are managed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in\nPasadena, California.\n","linknr":481,"url":"Goddard_Space_Flight_Center","recorded":1362505465,"links":54,"instances":["fdo_or_fido"],"pdf":["http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/pdf/106025main_40th.pdf","http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/pdf/106025main_40th.pdf","http://www.swri.org/9what/releases/2007/MMS_brochure%5B1%5D%5B2%5D.pdf","http://history.nasa.gov/spaceact-legishistory.pdf","http://www.sti.nasa.gov/tto/spinoff2002/spin02.pdf"],"categories":["1959
