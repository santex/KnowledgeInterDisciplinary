{"cursor":"4412","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n__NOTOC__ 'Î²-Glucocerebrosidase' (also called 'acid Î²-glucosidase', 'D-glucosyl-N-\nacylsphingosine glucohydrolase', or 'GCase') is an enzyme with\nglucosylceramidase activity () that is needed to cleave, by hydrolysis, the beta-\nglucosidic linkage of the chemical glucocerebroside, an intermediate in\nglycolipid metabolism. It is localized in the lysosome and has a molecular\nweight of 59700 Daltons.\n\nMutations in the glucocerebrosidase gene cause Gaucher's disease, a lysosomal\nstorage disease characterized by an accumulation of glucocerebrosides. A related\npseudogene is approximately 12 kb downstream of this gene on chromosome 1.\nAlternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding the same\nprotein.\n\nIn November 2008 mutations in the glucocerebrosidase gene were the mutations\nwith the strongest association with Parkinson's disease in the PDGene\ndatabase. {{Cite web\n | title = PDGene url = http://www.pdgene.org/ date = 2008-11-12 accessdate =\n | 2008-11-13 publisher = Alzheimer Research Forum\n}} The initial study that examined this link was published in\n2004. {{Cite journal\n | author = Alicia Lwin, Eduard Orvisky, Ozlem Goker-Alpan, Mary E.
