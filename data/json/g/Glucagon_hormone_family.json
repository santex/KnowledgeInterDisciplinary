Once such hormone,\nglucagon is widely distributed and produced in the alpha-cells of pancreatic\nislets. {{cite journal |author=Conlon JM, Thim L\n|title=Primary structure of glucagon from an elasmobranchian fish.

Glucagon is\nproduced, like other peptide hormones, as part of a larger precursor\n(preproglucagon), which is cleaved to produce glucagon, glucagon-like protein I\nand glucagon-like protein II. The structure of\nglucagon itself is fully conserved in all mammalian species in which it has been\nstudied. Other members of the structurally similar\ngroup include glicentin precursor, secretin, gastric inhibitory peptide,\nvasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), prealbumin, peptide HI-27 and growth\nhormone releasing factor.\n","linknr":161,"url":"Glucagon_hormone_family","recorded":1362668915,"links":11,"instances":["hormone"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Protein domains","Peripheral membrane proteins","Peptide hormones","Hormones of the digestive system","Hormones of glucose metabolism"],"headings":["Human hormones from this family","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/64/1gcn_opm.gif/220px-1gcn_opm.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["sct","hormone"]],"members":["sct"],"related":["Glucagon","Protein_family","Peptide_hormone","G-protein_coupled_receptors","Secretin_receptor_family","Intestine","Pancreas","Glucagon","Glucose","Metabolism","Liver","Fatty_acid","Ketone_bodies","Diabetes_mellitus","GLP-1","GLP-2","Secretin","Gastric_inhibitory_peptide","Vasoactive_intestinal_peptide","Prealbumin","Growth_hormone_releasing_factor","ADCYAP1","Glucagon","GHRH","Gastric_inhibitory_polypeptide","SCT_(hormone)","Vasoactive_intestinal_peptide"]}
