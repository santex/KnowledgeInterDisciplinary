{"cursor":"7084","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Go4It' was a children's magazine programme broadcast on Sunday evenings at\n7.15pm on BBC Radio 4, and one of the few speech-based shows on British national\nradio aimed at younger listeners.\n\nChildren's radio had been provided by [[Listen with Mother]] from 1950 to 1982.\nIn the early 1990s there were Children's BBC radio serials on BBC Radio 5. When\nthat station closed in 1994 CBBC serials moved to Radio 4 on Sundays from 7 to\n7.30pm until Easter 1998 when it was replaced by another episode of [[The\nArchers]].\n\n\"Go4It\" started in 2001 and was originally hosted by Matt Smith and included\nCromarty the space cat and many jokes. Smith was replaced one year later by CBBC\npresenter Barney Harwood on 5 May 2002. http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pr-\nessreleases/stories/2002/04_april/28/barney.shtml With Harwood's arrival\nthe show became less patronising with the theme tune changed to [[Danger Man]].\nWhen Harwood was off on holiday there were guest presenters like Kirsten\nO'Brien, Natalie Barrass and David McFetridge.\n\nThe show typically centred around themes of books, poetry and literature. A\ntypical episode featured a guest author or poet and often a trip 'on location'\nto an event related to children's literature. It could be considered a junior\nversion of Radio 4's Book Club with an author being asked questions by the young\nfans in the studio: the 'g4it-ers'. Also included were games and competitions.\nSome shows were also themed, for instance an Arthurian theme (27 May 2007) or\nEnid Blyton (3 June 2007). The programme included readings of serialized stories\nalthough this was later dropped as the show 'matured'; instead listeners were\nencouraged to listen to sister programme [[Big Toe Books]] on BBC7.\n\nThe 4 May 2008 episode was a special on comics. Featured was Philip Pullman's\nnew comic strip and [[Eagle (comic\nbook)|Eagle]]. http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00b45sj\n\nDuring the first year the show was extensively parodied on the Radio 4\nimpressionist satire [[Dead Ringers (comedy)|Dead Ringers]] for being about\n'what people at Radio 4 think young people want to listen to', for instance\nDylan Thomas poetry read by Richard Burton and Will Self stories. Matt Smith was\nsingularly highlighted for what could be seen as a patronising attitude towards\nthe audience, including excessive use of the word 'ace'.\n\nIn March 2009, it was announced that Go4It would be cancelled. The last episode\nwas broadcast on 24 May 2009. The reason given was that it did not attract\nenough young listeners. The show attracted an average of 450,000 listeners, but\nonly 20,000 were aged between 4-14. The average age of the listeners was between\n52-55. The decision to axe Go4It means that there is now no children's\nprogrammes on BBC analogue radio.\n","linknr":188,"url":"Go_4_It","recorded":1374520715,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Go4It&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Go4It&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","/wiki/Go4It","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","/w/index.php?title=Go_4_It&redirect=no","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Cleanup","/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style","/wiki/Template:Cleanup/doc","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Go4It&action=edit","/wiki/BBC_Radio_4","/wiki/Listen_with_Mother","/wiki/BBC_Radio_5_(former)","/wiki/The_Archers","/wiki/Matt_Smith_(broadcaster)","/wiki/CBBC","/wiki/Barney_Harwood","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Danger_Man","/wiki/Kirsten_O%27Brien","/wiki/Natalie_Barrass","/wiki/Arthurian_Legend","/wiki/Enid_Blyton","/wiki/Big_Toe_Books","/wiki/BBC7","/wiki/Comics","/wiki/Philip_Pullman","/wiki/Eagle_(comic_book)","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Dead_Ringers_(comedy)","/wiki/Dylan_Thomas","/wiki/Richard_Burton","/wiki/Will_Self","#Guests_on_the_programme","#See_also","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Go4It&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Philip_Pullman","/wiki/Dakota_Blue_Richards","/wiki/The_Golden_Compass_(film)","/wiki/His_Dark_Materials","/wiki/Lyra_Belacqua","#cite_note-CBBC-29June07-3","#cite_note-Guardian-30June2007-4","/wiki/Michael_Morpurgo","/wiki/Terry_Deary","/wiki/Horrible_Histories","/wiki/The_Fire_Thief","/wiki/Greek_Mythology","/wiki/Morris_Gleitzman","#cite_note-5","/wiki/Rainer_Hersch","/wiki/Lynne_Reid_Banks","/wiki/The_Indian_in_the_Cupboard","#cite_note-6","/wiki/Paul_Jennings_(Australian_author)","/wiki/Michael_Rosen","#cite_note-7","/wiki/Jacqueline_Wilson","/wiki/The_Story_of_Tracy_Beaker","/wiki/Raymond_Briggs","/wiki/The_Snowman","/wiki/Steve_Jackson_(UK_game_designer)","/wiki/Daniel_Radcliffe","/wiki/Harry_Potter","/w/index.php?title=Nick_Tocjek&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/wiki/Kevin_Crossley-Holland","/wiki/Philip_Reeve","/wiki/Mortal_Engines","/wiki/Enid_Blyton","/w/index.php?title=Eva_Rice&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Frag_Dolls","/w/index.php?title=Dan_Freedman&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Andrew_Cope","/w/index.php?title=Catherine_Lamb&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/David_Gilman_(writer)","/wiki/Anthony_Horowitz","/wiki/Alex_Rider","/wiki/The_Power_of_Five","/wiki/Philip_Ardagh","/wiki/Eddie_Dickens","/wiki/Louise_Rennison","#cite_note-8","/wiki/Shirley_Hughes","/wiki/Dogger_(book)","#cite_note-9","/w/index.php?title=Minne_Gray&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Tom_Daley_(diver)","/w/index.php?title=Go4It&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Children%27s_Hour","/wiki/The_Big_Toe_Radio_Show","/w/index.php?title=Go4It&action=edit&section=3","#cite_ref-1","http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2002/04_april/28/barney.shtml","#cite_ref-2","http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00b45sj","#cite_ref-CBBC-29June07_3-0","http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/newsid_5120000/newsid_5128500/5128532.stm","#cite_ref-Guardian-30June2007_4-0","http://books.guardian.co.uk/news/articles/0,,1809554,00.html","#cite_ref-5","http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b008m3w2","#cite_ref-6","http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/womanshour/2004_08_fri_06.shtml","#cite_ref-7","http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/gfi/bestbits/bereavement.shtml","#cite_ref-8","/wiki/BBC_Radio_4","http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b007sngv","#cite_ref-9","http://www.lovereading4kids.co.uk/book/2086/Dogger-Shirley_Hughes.html","/w/index.php?title=Go4It&action=edit&section=4","http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/gfi/","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Go4It&oldid=530794509","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:BBC_Radio_4_programmes","/wiki/Category:Children%27s_radio","/wiki/Category:2001_radio_programme_debuts","/wiki/Category:Articles_needing_cleanup_from_June_2011","/wiki/Category:All_articles_needing_cleanup","/wiki/Category:Cleanup_tagged_articles_without_a_reason_field_from_June_2011","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_pages_needing_cleanup_from_June_2011","/wiki/Category:All_articles_with_unsourced_statements","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_unsourced_statements_from_June_2007","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Go4It&
