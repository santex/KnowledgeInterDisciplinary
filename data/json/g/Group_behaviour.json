The field of group dynamics\ndeals with small groups that may reach consensus and act in a coordinated way.\nGroups of a large number of people in a given area may act simultaneously to\nachieve a goal that differs from what individuals would do acting alone (herd\nbehaviour). A large group (a crowd or ) is likely to show examples of group\nbehaviour when people gathered in a given place and time act in a similar\nway—for example, joining a protest or march, participating in a fight or\nacting patriotically.\n\nSpecial forms of large group behaviour are:\n* crowd \"hysteria\"\n* spectators - when a group of people gathered together on purpose to\n  participate in an event like theatre play, cinema movie, football match, a\n  concert, etc.\n* public - exception to the rule that the group must occupy the same physical\n  place. People watching same channel on television may react in the same way,\n  as they are occupying the same type of place - in front of television -\n  although they may physically be doing this all over the world.\n\nGroup behaviour differs from mass actions which refers to people behaving\nsimilarly on a more global scale (for example, shoppers in different shops),\nwhile group behaviour refers usually to people in one place. If the group\nbehaviour is coordinated, then it is called group action.\n\nSwarm intelligence is a special case of group behaviour, referring to the\ninteraction between a group of agents in order to fulfil a given task. This type\nof group dynamics has received much attention by the soft computing community in\nthe form of the particle swarm optimization family of algorithms.\n","linknr":178,"url":"Group_behaviour","recorded":1362477169,"links":39,"instances":["sociology","sociology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Crowd psychology","Group processes","Organizational behavior","Organizational psychology","Systems psychology"],"headings":["Why do people join groups","Defining characteristics of groups","Types of groups","Group structure","Stages of group development","Intergroup dynamics and behaviour","Intergroup conflict","Improving the quality of intergroup relations","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/Merge-arrow.svg/50px-Merge-arrow.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["mass_action","sociology"],["group_action","sociology"]],"members":["group_action","mass_action"],"related":["Sociology","Crowd","Small_group","Group_dynamics","Consensus_decision-making","Herd_behaviour","Crowd","Protest","Fight","Patriotic","Crowd","Collective_hysteria","Theatre","Movie_theater","Football","Concert","General_public","Mass_action_(sociology)","Group_action_(sociology)","Swarm_intelligence","Soft_computing","Particle_swarm_optimization","Bandwagon_effect","Behavioral_sink","Belbin_Team_Inventory","Collective_consciousness","Collective_effervescence","Collective_hysteria","Collective_intelligence","Collective_narcissism","Crowd_psychology","Group_conflict","Groupthink","Herd_behavior","Judge–advisor_system","Keeping_up_with_the_Joneses","Ochlocracy","Moral_panic","Peer_pressure","Social_anthropology","Social_behaviour","Social_comparison_theory","Sociomapping","Spiral_of_silence"]}
