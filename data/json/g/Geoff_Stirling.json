Stirling, along with other members of his family, owns\nseveral media outlets in the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador\nunder the corporate brand 'Stirling Communications International'. SCI is\nnot a single legal entity but rather refers collectively to Newfoundland\nBroadcasting Company Ltd., The Sunday Herald Ltd., and associated holding\ncompanies. Specifically, these properties are CJON-DT which goes by the\nslogan Canada's Superstation; radio station CHOZ-FM; and the [[Newfoundland\nHerald]], a weekly news, gossip and TV listings magazine.\n\nIn some circles, Stirling is regarded as an eccentric for the way in which he\nhas used his media outlets to promote a variety of personal interests such as\neastern mysticism and intestinal health. For example, he devoted many hours of,\noften unscheduled, broadcast time to conversations with gurus such as Ram Dass\nand Swami Shyam and to a variety of esoteric subjects ranging from pyramids to\nunidentified flying objects, a practice which continues today as the station is\nrun by his son Scott and Scott and Judy's son, Jesse. When he watched his own\ntelevision station he would sometimes phone Master Control to order that a\nfavorite tape immediately preempt the current broadcast or that the technician\napply a particular effect to the screen. Stirling himself claims that after\nbeing diagnosed with arthritis he had a doctor inject liquid gold directly into\nhis blood.\n\nStirling appeared in the 1974 documentary film [[Waiting for Fidel]] about a\ntrip he made to Cuba along with former Newfoundland premier Joey Smallwood and\ndirector Michael Rubbo. The trio never met the Cuban leader. Almost all of the\nprogram is a poolside conversation between Smallwood and Stirling as to what\nthey would like to ask Castro. Some of the dialogue occurs while Stirling is\ndemonstrating yoga and standing on his head while conversing with Smallwood. Although considered eccentric by some, Stirling pioneered\nmany television firsts in North America. NTV was the first station to broadcast\n24 hours a day. In the late 1970s, in between television programs and late at\nnight, Stirling would broadcast, what were called at the time, promotional films\nby popular music and rock bands, a precursor to music videos.\n\nStirling supervised the creation of the graphic novel Atlantis featuring the\nsuperheroes Captain Atlantis (a.k.a. Captain Newfoundland) and Captain Canada,\nand drawing on elements of Canadian history as well as New Age philosophy.\nCaptain Canada has become a mascot for the NTV station and has appeared in\ntelevision programs, commercials and made numerous public appearances.\n\nStirling was a co-founder in the Economic Union Party, a late-1940s political\nmovement that sought closer ties to the United States for the Dominion of\nNewfoundland, at the time still independent from Canada. It was one of two\norganizations at the time that unsuccessfully opposed the dominion's\nconfederation into Canada, which eventually occurred in 1949.\n\nIn 2001 Stirling was inducted into the CAB Broadcast Hall of Fame. As of 2012 he\nsplits his time between Torbay, Newfoundland and Labrador, and his ranch in\nWickenburg, Arizona. Stirling has also owned homes in India and Hong Kong.\n","linknr":120,"url":"Geoff_Stirling","recorded":1374539903,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Geoff_Stirling&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Geoff_Stirling&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Canada","/wiki/Businessman","/wiki/St._John%27s,_Newfoundland_and_Labrador","/wiki/Newfoundland_and_Labrador","#cite_note-1","/wiki/CJON-DT","/wiki/Radio_station","/wiki/CHOZ-FM","/wiki/Newfoundland_Herald","/wiki/Broadcast_programming","/wiki/Magazine","/wiki/Guru","/wiki/Ram_Dass","/wiki/Swami_Shyam","/wiki/Pyramids","/wiki/Unidentified_flying_object","/wiki/Master_Control","/wiki/Arthritis","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/wiki/Waiting_for_Fidel","/wiki/Cuba","/wiki/Joey_Smallwood","/wiki/Michael_Rubbo","#cite_note-NFB_film-2","/wiki/Graphic_novel","/wiki/Captain_Canada_(comics)","/wiki/New_Age","/wiki/Economic_Union_Party","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/Dominion_of_Newfoundland","/wiki/Canadian_Association_of_Broadcasters","/wiki/Torbay,_Newfoundland_and_Labrador","/wiki/Wickenburg,_Arizona","/wiki/India","/wiki/Hong_Kong","/w/index.php?title=Geoff_Stirling&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","#cite_ref-NFB_film_2-0","http://www.nfb.ca/film/waiting_for_fidel","/w/index.php?title=Geoff_Stirling&action=edit&section=2","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0196195/","/wiki/Internet_Movie_Database","http://www.broadcasting-history.ca/personalities/personalities.php?id=64","http://www.internationalhero.co.uk/c/canatlan.htm","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Geoff_Stirling&oldid=529558600","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1921_births","/wiki/Category:Living_people","/wiki/Category:Canadian_mass_media_owners","/wiki/Category:People_from_St._John%27s,_Newfoundland_and_Labrador","/wiki/Category:People_from_Maricopa_County,_Arizona","/wiki/Category:Pre-Confederation_Newfoundland_and_Labrador_people","/wiki/Category:Businesspeople_from_Newfoundland_and_Labrador","/wiki/Category:All_articles_with_unsourced_statements","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_unsourced_statements_from_November_2012","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Geoff+Stirling&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Geoff+Stirling","/wiki/Geoff_Stirling","/wiki/Talk:Geoff_Stirling","#","/wiki/Geoff_Stirling","/w/index.php?title=Geoff_Stirling&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Geoff_Stirling&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Geoff_Stirling","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Geoff_Stirling","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Geoff_Stirling&oldid=529558600","/w/index.php?title=Geoff_Stirling&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5534331","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Geoff_Stirling&id=529558600","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Geoff+Stirling","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Geoff+Stirling&oldid=529558600&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Geoff_Stirling&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5534331#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoff_Stirling","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_medi
