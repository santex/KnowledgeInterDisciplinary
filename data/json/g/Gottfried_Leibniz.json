He occupies a\nprominent place in the history of mathematics and the history of philosophy.\n\nLeibniz developed the infinitesimal calculus independently of Isaac Newton, and\nLeibniz's mathematical notation has been widely used ever since it was\npublished. His visionary Law of Continuity and Transcendental Law of Homogeneity\nonly found mathematical implementation in the 20th century. He became one of the\nmost prolific inventors in the field of mechanical calculators. While working on\nadding automatic multiplication and division to Pascal's calculator, he was the\nfirst to describe a pinwheel calculator in 1685 David Smith, p.173-181\n(1929) and invented the Leibniz wheel, used in the arithmometer, the first\nmass-produced mechanical calculator. He also refined the binary number system,\nwhich is at the foundation of virtually all digital computers.\n\nIn philosophy, Leibniz is mostly noted for his optimism, e.g., his conclusion\nthat our Universe is, in a restricted sense, the best possible one that God\ncould have created. Leibniz, along with RenÃ© Descartes and Baruch Spinoza, was\none of the three great 17th century advocates of rationalism. The work of\nLeibniz anticipated modern logic and analytic philosophy, but his philosophy\nalso looks back to the scholastic tradition, in which conclusions are produced\nby applying reason to first principles or prior definitions rather than to\nempirical evidence. Leibniz made major contributions to physics and technology,\nand anticipated notions that surfaced much later in philosophy, probability\ntheory, biology, medicine, geology, psychology, linguistics, and computer\nscience. He wrote works on philosophy, politics, law, ethics, theology, history,\nand philology. Leibniz's contributions to this vast array of subjects were\nscattered in various learned journals, in tens of thousands of letters, and in\nunpublished manuscripts. He wrote in several languages, but primarily in Latin,\nFrench, and German. Roughly 40%, 30%, and 15%, respectively.[http://www.gwlb.de/Leibniz/Leibniz-\nNachlass/index.htm www.gwlb.de].
