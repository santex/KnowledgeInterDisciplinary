{"cursor":"28927","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"Most transportation historians date the history of Canada's railways as\nbeginning on February 25, 1832, with the incorporation of British North\nAmerica's first steam-powered railway, the Champlain and St. Lawrence Railroad.\nThis line opened for traffic on July 21, 1836, although there are cases of animal-\ndrawn mining tramways in Nova Scotia from the 18th century onward.\n\nThousands of railways followed the C&SL and were given a charter by the federal\nor provincial governments, although in most cases these charters never resulted\nin an actual line being constructed. Many of these charters were so-called\n\"paper railways\" and were absorbed into other railways, that is they existed on\npaper with the actual trains bearing the name of another railway or system of\nrailways. For example, Canadian National Railways alone consisted of over some\n400 railways (see Canadian National Railways-List of Companies).\n\nThe reason for these \"paper\" railways was the ease of getting a charter, this\nwas often done by a major railway such as Canadian Pacific Railway or Grand\nTrunk Railway but, the true interests were kept hidden to keep attention away\nfrom the efforts of competing major railways to gain access to anotherâs\nterritory. In other instances local interests wanted a railway to connect their\ncommunity with the main line of a major railway that did not enter their town,\nor to connect to another major railway for competitive reasons, to get lower\nfreight rates, something that remains to this day. In many cases these local\nefforts were quickly taken over by a major railway to both expand its own\nnetwork and to deny its competition access to traffic.\n\nStreetcar and interurban railways were chartered provincially, in the case of\nOntario under the Street Railway Act.\n\nNon-common carrier railways did not require a charter under the Railway Act\nsince they were used primarily for the owners own purposes, mainly logging\nand mining.\n\nAmerican railroads always operated in Canada under charters of subsidiary\nrailways even though most had equipment lettered only for the parent company.\nMost U.S. railroads also operated in Canada through subsidiary railways with\none exception: Wabash Railway which had not a mile of track in Canada as it\ncrossed southern Ontario using trackage rights granted by the Grand Trunk\nRailway of Canada. These rights still exist with present day Canadian National\nand Norfolk Southern.\n\n----\n\nThis list of defunct railways includes only those railways that actually came\ninto existence. Many were taken over by other railways or had a name change and\nthus continued to operate trains over the same tracks. A few ceased to exist\nbecause they went out of business and were abandoned and dismantled.\n\nFor simplicity on this list, Canadian National Railways (CNR) (pre-1960),\nCanadian National Railway (CN) (post-1960), Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR),\nGrand Trunk Railway (GTR), and Canadian Northern Railway (CNoR) will be\nabbreviated for notations. Others will be abbreviated as required.\n\nAlso consult the list of active Canadian railways.\n","linknr":562,"url":"Great_Northern_Railway_of_Canada","recorded":1375061479,"links":["/w/index.php?title=List_of_defunct_Canadian_railways&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=List_of_defunct_Canadian_railways&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","/wiki/List_of_defunct_Canadian_railways","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","/w/index.php?title=Great_Northern_Railway_of_Canada&redirect=no","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Canada","/wiki/British_North_America","/wiki/Champlain_and_St._Lawrence_Railroad","/wiki/Nova_Scotia","/wiki/Canadian_National_Railways","/wiki/Canadian_National_Railways-List_of_Companies","/wiki/Canadian_Pacific_Railway","/wiki/Grand_Trunk_Railway","/wiki/Ontario","/wiki/Wabash_Railway","/wiki/Grand_Trunk_Railway","/wiki/Norfolk_Southern","/wiki/Canadian_National_Railways","/wiki/Canadian_National_Railway","/wiki/Canadian_Pacific_Railway","/wiki/Grand_Trunk_Railway","/wiki/Canadian_Northern_Railway","/wiki/List_of_Canadian_railways","#top","#0.E2.80.939","#A","#B","#C","#D","#E","#F","#G","#H","#I","#J","#K","#L","#M","#N","#O","#P","#Q","#R","#S","#T","#U","#V","#W","#X","#Y","#Z","/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Lists#Incomplete_lists","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_defunct_Canadian_railways&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=List_of_defunct_Canadian_railways&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Alberta_Railway_and_Navigation_Company&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Canadian_Pacific_Railway","/wiki/Alberta_and_Great_Waterways_Railway","/wiki/Northern_Alberta_Railways","/w/index.php?title=Albion_Railway&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Algoma_Central_Railway","/wiki/Wisconsin_Central_Transportation","/wiki/Algoma_Eastern_Railway","/wiki/Canadian_Pacific_Railway","/w/index.php?title=Alma_and_Jonqui%C3%A8res_Railway&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Roberval_and_Saguenay_Railway","/w/index.php?title=Atlantic_and_North-West_Railway&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Canadian_Pacific_Railway","/w/index.php?title=Atlantic,_Quebec_and_Western_Railway&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Canadian_National_Railways","/w/index.php?title=List_of_defunct_Canadian_railways&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=Bay_of_Quinte_Railway&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Canadian_Northern_Railway","/w/index.php?title=Botwood_Railway&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Anglo_Newfoundland_Development_Company&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Grand_Falls_Central_Railway&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Brantford,_Hamilton_and_Western_Railway&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/British_Columbia_Electric_Railway","/wiki/BC_Hydro","/wiki/Southern_Railway_of_British_Columbia","/wiki/British_Columbia_Railway","/wiki/Canadian_National_Railway","/wiki/Brockville_and_Ottawa_Railway","/wiki/Canadian_Pacific_Railway","/wiki/Brockville,_Westport_and_North-Western_Railway","/wiki/Canadian_Northern_Railway","/w/index.php?title=Bruce_Mines_and_Algoma_Railway&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Buchans_Railway&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/ASARCO","/w/index.php?title=Buctouche_and_Moncton_Railway&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Canadian_National_Railways","/w/index.php?title=Burlington_Northern_Manitoba_Limited&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Burlington_Northern_Railroad","/wiki/Burlington_Northern_Santa_Fe_Manitoba","/wiki/Bytown_and_Prescott_Railway","/w/index.php?title=List_of_defunct_Canadian_railways&action=edit&section=3","/w/index.php?title=Canada_and_Gulf_Terminal_Railway&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Canadian_National_Railway","/wiki/Calgary_and_Edmonton_Railway","/wiki/Canadian_Pacific_Railway","/w/index.php?title=Campbellford,_Lake_Ontario_and_Western_Railway&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Canadian_Pacific_Railway","/w/index.php?title=Canada_Air_Line_Railway&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Great_Western_Railway_(Ontario)","/wiki/Canada_Atlantic_Railway","/wiki/Grand_Trunk_Railway","/wiki/Canada_Central_Railway","/wiki/Canadian_Pacific_Railway","/w/index.php?title=Canada_Coal_and_Railroad_Company&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Maritime_Coal_Railway_and_Power_Company&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Canada_Coals_and_Railway_Company&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Canada_Coal_and_Railroad_Company&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Canada_Southern_Railway","/wi
