{"cursor":"4244","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Garry Lambert' is an Australian politician. He was the Lord Mayor of Darwin\nfrom 2007 to 2008. He was the unsuccessful Country Liberal Party candidate\nfor the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly seat of Fannie Bay in the\n2008 election.\n\nLambert was an alderman on the Darwin City Council prior to his election as Lord\nMayor, and begun his working life in the Territory as a teacher. He has lived in\nvarious locations throughout the Territory, and had first entered politics when\nhe was made secretary of the Mataranka Progress Association.\n\nLambert was elected to the role of Lord Mayor on 31 July 2007, after the\nresignation of disgraced former mayor Peter Adamson, convicted of stealing from\nthe Darwin City Council. Following the conviction on\n16 July 2007, the deputy mayor of the time, Allan Mitchell, acted as Lord Mayor\nfor the remainder of the month. During this time the city council elected\nLambert as their leader from their own ranks â€” an unprecedented event in\nDarwin's history, which usually votes for the mayor via public by-\nelections. Lambert publicly described himself as the \"caretaker\" of\nthe role during his reign, much of which was spent dealing with the troubled\nlegacy of his predecessor, and did not contest the April 2008 mayoral election,\nwhen he was succeeded by Graeme Sawyer.\n\nLambert began expressing an interest contesting the 2008 territory election for\nthe conservative Country Liberal Party not long after his retirement as Lord\nMayor. He subsequently won preselection for the seat of Fannie Bay, a marginal\nseat being vacated by former Chief Minister Clare Martin. \"Scent of NT\nelection sparks CLP in-fighting.\" [[Northern Territory News]], 29 June\n2008. He was immediately touted as a potential CLP leader, and as a\npotential challenger to current Opposition Leader Terry Mills. He declined to\nstate at the time who he had voted for at the 2005 election, refusing to deny\nreports that he had had a sign for Labor minister Kon Vatskalis in his yard\nduring that campaign. Calacouras, Nick. \"Lambert sharpening knife for tilt\nat Mills' job.\" [[Northern Territory News]], 18 June 2008. He was tipped\nas an early favourite in election betting, with SportingBet odds marking him as\nnarrow favourite. Calacouras, Nick. \"Bookies predict the next race will be a\nclose one.\" [[Northern Territory News]], 12 June 2008. He was narrowly\ndefeated by Labor candidate Michael Gunner, in a result that was not known for\nseveral days. Gunner's victory over Lambert gave Labor the final seat it needed\nto retain government.\n\nLambert's daughter, Stephanie, is the official ambassador for the 2008 Darwin\nCup Carnival. Bourchier, Daniel. \"Dressed to impress in true NT style.\"\n[[Northern Territory News]], 15 July
