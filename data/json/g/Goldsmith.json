{"cursor":"7022","size":14,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n of the goldsmith and patron saint of goldsmiths Saint Eligius in his workshop]]\n\n\nA 'goldsmith' is a metalworker who specializes in working with gold and other\nprecious metals. Historically goldsmiths have also made silverware, platters,\ngoblets, decorative and serviceable utensils, and ceremonial or religious items,\nbut the rising prices of precious metals have curtailed the making of such items\nto a large degree.\n\nGoldsmiths must be skilled in forming metal through filing, soldering, sawing,\nforging, casting, and polishing metal. Traditionally, these skills had been\npassed along through apprenticeships, however, more recently Jewelry Arts\nSchools specializing solely in teaching goldsmithing and a multitude of skills\nfalling under the jewelry arts umbrella are available. Many universities and\njunior colleges also offer goldsmithing, silversmithing and metal arts\nfabrication as a part of their fine arts curriculum.\n","linknr":397,"url":"Goldsmith","recorded":1362480242,"links":55,"instances":["household","purity","metalworking","tool","caste","dishware"],"pdf":[],"categories":["History of banking","Jewellery making","Goldsmiths|","Metalworking"],"headings":["Gold","History","Current situation","Notable goldsmiths","Contemporary goldsmiths","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/02/Saint_Eligius_in_his_workshop.jpg/300px-Saint_Eligius_in_his_workshop.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/Goldworker_in_Baghdad.jpg/300px-Goldworker_in_Baghdad.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/74/Fotothek_df_tg_0007208_St%C3%A4ndebuch_%5E_Beruf_%5E_Handwerk_%5E_Goldschmied.jpg/200px-Fotothek_df_tg_0007208_St%C3%A4ndebuch_%5E_Beruf_%5E_Handwerk_%5E_Goldschmied.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/12px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["platter","dishware"],["file","tool"],["casting","metalworking"],["carat","purity"],["casting","metalworking"],["silver","household"],["sunar","caste"]],"members":["silver","carat","casting","file","sunar","platter"],"related":["Patron_saint","Saint_Eligius","Metalworker","Gold","Precious_metal","Cutlery","Platter_(dishware)","Goblet","Ceremonial","Religious","File_(tool)","Brazing","Saw","Forging","Casting_(metalworking)","Polishing","Apprenticeship","Silversmithing","Malleable","Ductile","Chemical_element","Yellow","Color","Bronze","Native_metal","Cultures","Medieval","Guild","Banker","Middle_Ages","Base_metal","Jeweler","Khudabadi_Sindhi_Swarankar","The_Great_Exhibition_of_1851","Printmaking","Engraving","Engraver","Master_E._S.","Martin_Schongauer","Albrecht_Dürer","Gold","Malleable","Platinum","Carat_(purity)","Fine_gold","Alloy","Casting_(metalworking)","Lost_wax_casting","Rolling_mill","Drawplate","Swage_block","Brazing","Gemstone","Jocelyn_Burton","Paul_de_Lamerie","Paul_Storr","Lorenzo_Ghiberti","Benvenuto_Cellini","Georges_Cuyvers","Johannes_Gutenberg","House_of_Fabergé","Jean-Valentin_Morel","Adrien_Vachette","Andrea_Cagnetti_-_Akelo","William_Claude_Harper","Mary_Lee_Hu","Linda_MacNeil","Vytautas_Matulionis","Mazlo","Gary_Lee_Noffke","Robert_Spotten","Society_of_North_American_Goldsmiths","Old_master_print","Engraving","Niello","Bench_jeweler","Toreutics","Persian-Sassanide_art_patterns","Jewelers'_Row","Silver_(household)","Sunar_(caste)"]}
