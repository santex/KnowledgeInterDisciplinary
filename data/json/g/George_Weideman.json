Three of\nhis dramas was performed by the University of Namibia.\n\nHis first book aimed at the youth, \"Los my uit, paloekas!\", received the silver\nSanlam Prize in 1992, and \"Die optog van die aftjoppers\" received gold in 1994.\nThe latter also received the highly-acclaimed Scheepers Prize in 1995, as well\nas a nomination by the Children's Book Forum as IBBY Honour Book for the\nInternational Board on Books for Young People.\n\nIn 1994 his second collection of short stories appeared, entitled \"Die donker\nmelk van daeraad\".\n\nIn 1997 he published 'n Staning onder sterre, a collection of poetry; Nuwe\nstemme, an omnibus of the works of eleven debut poets, which George arranged;\nand his first adult novel, Die onderskepper (\"The Interceptor\"), about a\nmysterious woman from the city. {{cite journal\n  | last = Van Coller first = Hennie P. authorlink = title = The Peregrination\n  | of Afrikaans Prose Fiction from Farm to City journal = AUMLA volume = issue\n  | = 109 pages = 27â46 date = May 2008 url = issn = 0001-2793 accessdate =\n  | }} The latter won the 1998 W.A.
