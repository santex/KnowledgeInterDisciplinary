Whittow, John (1984). Dictionary of Physical\nGeography. London: Penguin, 1984, p. 103. ISBN 0-14-051094-X. It may also\nbe called a 'notch', a 'gap' or a 'saddle', although the\nlast-named usually has a wider meaning and may contain a mountain pass. The\nheight of a summit above its highest col is effectively a measure of a\nmountain's prominence, an important measure of the independence of its summit.\nCols lie on the line of the watershed between two mountains, often on a\nprominent ridge or arÃªte.\n\nParticularly rugged and forbidding cols in the terrain are usually referred to\nas 'notches'. They are generally unsuitable as mountain passes, but are\noccasionally crossed by mule tracks or climbers' routes.\n\nFor example, the highest col in Austria, the Obere Glocknerscharte (\"Upper\nGlockner Col\", ), lies between the Kleinglockner () and GroÃglockner ()\nmountains, giving the Kleinglockner a minimum prominence of 17 metres. The\nnotch is about 8 metres wide and links the two peaks with a usually\ncorniced, often only two foot wide, narrow, snow-covered ridge. The col is on\nthe normal climbing route from the Adlersruhe to the summit of the GroÃglockner;\nit acts as the exit from the Pallavicini Couloir (Pallavicini-Rinne) (an ice\ngully lying at up to 55 Â° to the horizontal) from the north and has never\nbeen climbed from the south. Hardly anyone has ever considered crossing the\nGlockner massif via this col. Willi End, Hubert Peterka: AlpenvereinsfÃ¼hrer\nGlockner- und Granatspitzgruppe, Bergverlag Rudolf Rother, Munich, 1990. ISBN\n3-7633-1258-7 [http://www.rother.de/titpage/1266.php]\n\nThe overwhelming majority of cols are, however, unnamed and are either never\ntransited or only crossed in the course of negotiating a ridge line. For\nexample, every Gratturm (\"ridge pinnacle\", e.g. the Gendarm) has a col. Many\ndouble summits are separated by prominent cols. The number of cols gave rise to\nthe name of the Lyskamm (Lauskamm).\n\nThe distinction with other names for breaks in mountain ridges such as saddle,\nwind gap or notch is not sharply defined and may vary from place to place.\n\n\n (3773 m), BrÃ¨che-sud (3429 m), the Dames Anglaises (3601 m), BrÃ¨che-central,\n L'IsolÃ©e, BrÃ¨che-nord (3491 m), Aiguille Blanche de Peuterey (4112 m) and Col\n de Peuterey (3934 m)]] Other well-known cols are:\n* South Col between Mount Everest and Lhotse\n* Langkofel Col (Langkofelscharte) in the Langkofel Group\n* The notches of the Peuterey ridge on Mont Blanc\n* Hohe Dachsteinscharte () between the Hoher and Niederer Dachstein.\n* the cols between the five points above 4,000 metres on the ridge of\n  Teufelsgrat on the Mont Blanc du Tacul\n* BrÃ¨che de Roland in the Pyrenees\n","linknr":132,"url":"Gap_(landform)","recorded":1362674034,"links":16,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Geomorphology","Landforms"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/90/Saslonch.jpg/220px-Saslonch.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/78/Brecha_rolando.jpg/220px-Brecha_rolando.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/72/SantaCruz-CerroTorre-FitzRoyP2140126b-closeup.jpg/220px-SantaCruz-CerroTorre-FitzRoyP2140126b-closeup.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/Aiguilles_de_Peuterey_001.JPG/220px-Aiguilles_de_Peuterey_001.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Pyrenees","Fitz_Roy","Geomorphological","Mountain_pass","Topographic_prominence","Drainage_divide","Mountain","Arête","Mountain_pass","Mule","Kleinglockner","Großglockner","Cornice","Adlersruhe","Lyskamm","Wind_gap","Aiguille_Blanche_de_Peuterey","South_Col","Mount_Everest","Lhotse","Langkofel_Group","Mont_Blanc","Hoher_Dachstein","Mont_Blanc_du_Tacul","Brèche_de_Roland","Pyrenees"]}
