In\nanimals, the produced ammonia is, however, usually bled off to the urea cycle.\nTypically, the Î±-ketoglutarate to glutamate reaction does not occur in mammals\nas glutamate dehydrogenase equilibrium favours the production of ammonia and Î±-\nketoglutarate. Glutamate dehydrogenase also has a very low affinity for ammonia\n(high Michaelis constant K_m of about 1 mM), and therefore toxic\nlevels of ammonia would have to be present in the body for the reverse reaction\nto proceed (that is, Î±-ketoglutarate and ammonia to glutamate and NAD(P)+). In\nbacteria, the ammonia is assimilated to amino acids via glutamate and\naminotransferases. In plants, the enzyme can\nwork in either direction depending on environment and stress. Transgenic\nplants expressing microbial GLDHs are improved in tolerance to herbicide, water\ndeficit, and pathogen infections. They are more\nnutritionally valuable.\n\n Image:GlutaminsÃ¤ure - Glutamic acid.svg|Glutamate Image:Alpha-\nketoglutaric acid.png |Î±-Ketoglutarate \n\nThe enzyme represents a key link between catabolic and metabolic pathways, and\nis, therefore, ubiquitous in eukaryotes.\n","linknr":784,"url":"Glutamate_dehydrogenase","recorded":1362481909,"links":29,"instances":["biochemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["EC 1.4.1"],"headings":["Clinical application","Cofactors","Role in flow of nitrogen","Regulation of glutamate dehydrogenase","Regulation","Isozymes","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/Mergefrom.svg/50px-Mergefrom.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/b/7/5/b754d16bfd50c76edbefd48bc88fbfa6.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/Glutamins%C3%A4ure_-_Glutamic_acid.svg/120px-Glutamins%C3%A4ure_-_Glutamic_acid.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/66/Alpha-ketoglutaric_acid.png/120px-Alpha-ketoglutaric_acid.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/b/e/ebe1915c432cf9c372b4ecfe36ff1fa2.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/b/e/ebe1915c432cf9c372b4ecfe36ff1fa2.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/b/e/ebe1915c432cf9c372b4ecfe36ff1fa2.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cofactor","biochemistry"]],"members":["cofactor"],"related":["Enzyme","Mitochondria","Eukaryotes","Urea","Glutamate","Alpha-Ketoglutaric_acid","Urea_cycle","Michaelis_constant","Glutamate","Alpha-Ketoglutaric_acid","Catabolic","Metabolic_pathways","Medical_laboratory","Blood_serum","Aminotransferases","Mitochondria","Clinical_trials","Nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide","NADP","Cofactor_(biochemistry)","Ammonium","Glutamine_synthetase","Mammalian","ADP-ribose","Sirt4","Caloric_restriction","Blood_glucose","Citric_acid_cycle","Adenosine_triphosphate","Michaelis_constant","Insulin","Β_cells","Adenosine_diphosphate","Glucose","Allosteric_regulation","Morpheein","Allosteric_regulation","Adenosine_triphosphate","Guanosine_triphosphate","Adenosine_diphosphate","Guanosine_diphosphate","Isozyme","GLUD1","GLUD1","GLUD2","GLUD2","Anaplerotic_reactions"]}
