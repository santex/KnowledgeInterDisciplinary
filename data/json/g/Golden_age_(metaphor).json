The term originated from early Greek and Roman poets who used\nto refer to a time when mankind lived in a better time and was pure (see\nGolden Age).\n\nThe origin of the term is with the ancient Greek philosopher Hesiod, who\nintroduced it as a period in his Works and Days as the period where the \"Golden\nRace\" of man lived. This was part of fivefold division of Ages of Man, starting\nwith the Golden age, then the Silver Age, the Bronze Age, the Age of Heroes\n(including the Trojan War) and finally the current Iron Age. The concept was further refined by Ovid in his\nMetamorphoses into the four \"metal ages\" (golden, silver, bronze,\niron). Ovid, Metamorphoses. Trans. A.D. Melville.
