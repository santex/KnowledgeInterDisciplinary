{"cursor":"20021","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\n'Grafting' or 'graftage' is a horticultural technique\nwhereby tissues from one plant are inserted into those of another so that the\ntwo sets of vascular tissues may join together. This vascular joining is called\ninosculation. The technique is most commonly used in asexual propagation of\ncommercially grown plants for the horticultural and agricultural trades.\n\nIn most cases, one plant is selected for its roots and this is called the\n'stock' or rootstock. The other plant is selected for its stems, leaves,\nflowers, or fruits and is called the 'scion' or 'cion'. The\nscion contains the desired genes to be duplicated in future production by the\nstock/scion plant.\n\nIn stem grafting, a common grafting method, a shoot of a selected, desired plant\ncultivar is grafted onto the stock of another type. In another common form\ncalled bud grafting, a dormant side bud is grafted onto the stem of another\nstock plant, and when it has inosculated successfully, it is encouraged to grow\nby pruning off the stem of the stock plant just above the newly grafted bud.\n\nFor successful grafting to take place, the vascular cambium tissues of the stock\nand scion plants must be placed in contact with each other. Both tissues must be\nkept alive until the graft has 'taken', usually a period of a few weeks.\nSuccessful grafting only requires that a vascular connection take place between\nthe grafted tissues. Joints formed by grafting are not as strong as naturally\nformed joints, so a physical weak point often still occurs at the graft, because\nonly the newly formed tissues inosculate with each other. The existing\nstructural tissue (or wood) of the stock plant does not fuse.\n","linknr":331,"url":"Grafting","recorded":1362480601,"links":60,"instances":["shrub","botany","plant","biology","biology","horticulture"],"pdf":["http://www.uky.edu/Ag/HLA/Geneve/teaching/PLS%20440/lectures/grafting%20for%20web1.pdf","http://www.uky.edu/Ag/HLA/Geneve/teaching/PLS%20440/lectures/grafting%20for%20web1.pdf"],"categories":["Horticultural techniques","Plant reproduction","Agronomy"],"headings":["Advantages","Techniques","Natural grafting","Graft hybrids","Scientific uses","Herbaceous grafting","History","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3b/Zweij%C3%A4hrige-Gei%C3%9Ffu%C3%9Fveredelu.jpg/180px-Zweij%C3%A4hrige-Gei%C3%9Ffu%C3%9Fveredelu.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/eb/Newly_Grafted_Cherry_Tree.JPG/180px-Newly_Grafted_Cherry_Tree.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6a/Grafted_blossoming_tree_unidentified_white_pink.JPG/200px-Grafted_blossoming_tree_unidentified_white_pink.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/Grafting_of_Plum_%28cultivar_Regina_Claudia_yellow%29.JPG/300px-Grafting_of_Plum_%28cultivar_Regina_Claudia_yellow%29.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/Neadle.jpg/150px-Neadle.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9d/Okulera.jpg/150px-Okulera.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/93/CleftGraft2ndYr.JPG/180px-CleftGraft2ndYr.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/CleftGraft4thYr.JPG/180px-CleftGraft4thYr.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c8/Good_graft.JPG/200px-Good_graft.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/62/Ugly_graft.JPG/180px-Ugly_graft.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/95/StubGraft.JPG/150px-StubGraft.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c6/Eglinton_fish_pond_island_inosculated_Q._petraea.JPG/170px-Eglinton_fish_pond_island_inosculated_Q._petraea.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/Husband_and_Wife_Trees_-_Linncraigs%2C_Dalry.JPG/170px-Husband_and_Wife_Trees_-_Linncraigs%2C_Dalry.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["tissue","biology"],["cutting","plant"],["hybrid","biology"],["trunk","botany"],["broom","shrub"],["nursery","horticulture"]],"members":["broom","trunk","cutting","tissue","hybrid","nursery"],"related":["Horticulture","Tissue_(biology)","Plant","Inosculation","Asexual_reproduction","Plant_propagation","Horticultural","Agricultural","Root","Rootstock","Plant_stem","Leaf","Flower","Fruit","Gene","Shoot","Cultivar","Inosculation","Pruning","Vascular_cambium","Week","Mangosteen","Apple","Orchard","Fruit","Cutting_(plant)","Hybrid_(biology)","Flower","Western_Australia","Phytophthora_cinnamomi","Eastern_Australia","Grevillea","Eucalyptus","Trunk_(botany)","Ornamental_plant","Rose","Pollenizer","Orchard","Malus","Pollen","Bark","Rodent","Bridge_graft","Watershoot","Basal_shoot","Cultivar","Gardener","Potato","Tomato","Cactus","Cultivar","Fruit_Salad_Tree","Pruning","Tree_shaping","Furniture","Axel_Erlandson","Root","Pleaching","Shield_budding","Prunus_spinosa","Branch","Root","Inosculation","Pathogen","Dutch_elm_disease","Garden_strawberry","Potato","Graft-chimaera","Foliage","+Laburnocytisus_'Adamii'","Laburnum","Broom_(shrub)","Nursery_(horticulture)","Paris","Flower","Leaf","Plant_virus","Woody_plant","Vegetable","Tomato","Cucumber","Eggplant","Watermelon","Tomato_grafting","Japan","Robot","China","Eurasia","Ancient_Greece"]}
