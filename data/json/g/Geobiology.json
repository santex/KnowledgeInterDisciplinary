{"cursor":"3113","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nBroadly defined, 'geobiology' is an interdisciplinary field of scientific\nresearch that explores interactions between the biosphere and the lithosphere\nand/or the atmosphere. \n\nInvestigators from numerous fields are involved in 'geobiologic' research,\nincluding, but not limited to, such disciplines as: paleontology, paleobiology,\nmicrobiology, mineralogy, biochemistry, sedimentology, genetics, physiology,\ngeochemistry (organic and inorganic), and atmospheric science. One major\nsubdiscipline of geobiology is 'geomicrobiology', an area of study that focuses\non investigating the interactions between microbes and minerals. Another related\narea of research is astrobiology, an interdisciplinary field that uses a\ncombination of 'geobiological' and planetary science data to establish a context\nfor the search for life on other planets.\n\nThe study also focuses on biosphere/geosphere/atmosphere interactions throughout\nEarth's history, as preserved in the sedimentary rock record. One example of\nsuch an interaction is the Archean era introduction of oxygen into the\natmosphere by photosynthetic bacteria. This oxygenation of Earth's primoidial\natmosphere (the so-called oxygen catastrophe) may have resulted in the\nprecipitation of banded-iron rock formations.\n\nOne example of geobiological research in a modern context is the study of\nbacteria that \"breathe\" metals such as manganese and uranium. These organisms\nuse metals as terminal electron acceptors in the same way that animals use\noxygen. These processes hold promise as tools for environmental bioremediation.\n","linknr":198,"url":"Geobiology","recorded":1362505547,"links":18,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Earth sciences","Geology","Geobiology|"],"headings":["See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Interdisciplinary","Scientific_research","Biosphere","Lithosphere","Celestial_body_atmosphere","Paleontology","Paleobiology","Microbiology","Mineralogy","Biochemistry","Sedimentology","Genetics","Physiology","Geochemistry","Atmospheric_science","Microbe","Mineral","Astrobiology","Planetary_science","Planet","Biosphere","Geosphere","Atmosphere","History_of_Earth","Sedimentary_rock","Archean","Oxygen","Photosynthesis","Bacteria","Great_Oxygenation_Event","Earth","Oxygen_catastrophe","Iron","Rock_formation","Metal","Manganese","Uranium","Electron_acceptors","Animal","Natural_environment","Bioremediation","Biogeochemistry","Biogeography","Biogeology","Fossil","Geologic_time_scale","Invertebrate_paleontology","Micropaleontology","Paleobiology","Paleobotany","Paleontology","Vertebrate_paleontology"]}
