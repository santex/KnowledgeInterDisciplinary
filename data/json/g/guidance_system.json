      "text" : "A 'guidance system' is a device or group of devices used to navigate a ship,\naircraft, missile, rocket, satellite, or other craft. Typically, this refers to\na system that navigates without direct or continuous human control. Systems that\nare intended to have a high degree of human interaction are usually referred to\nas a navigation system.\n\nOne of the earliest examples of a true guidance system is that used in the\nGerman V-1 during World War II. This system consisted of a simple gyroscope to\nmaintain heading, an airspeed sensor to estimate flight time, an altimeter to\nmaintain altitude, and other redundant systems.\n\nA guidance system has three major sub-sections: Inputs, Processing, and Outputs.\nThe input section includes sensors, course data, radio and satellite links, and\nother information sources. The processing section, composed of one or more CPUs,\nintegrates this data and determines what actions, if any, are necessary to\nmaintain or achieve a proper heading. This is then fed to the outputs which can\ndirectly affect the system's course. The outputs may control speed by\ninteracting with devices such as turbines, and fuel pumps, or they may more\ndirectly alter course by actuating ailerons, rudders, or other devices.\n",
