Gambling thus requires three elements be present: consideration,\nchance and prize.<ref></ref> Typically, the outcome of the wager is evident\nwithin a short period.\n\nThe term 'gaming'<ref></ref> in this context typically refers to instances in\nwhich the activity has been specifically permitted by law. The two words are not\nmutually exclusive; i.e., a “gaming” company offers (legal) “gambling”\nactivities to the public<ref></ref> and may be regulated by one of many gaming\ncontrol boards, for example, the Nevada Gaming Control Board. However, this\ndistinction is not universally observed in the English-speaking world. For\ninstance, in the&nbsp;UK, the regulator of gambling activities is called the\nGambling Commission (not the Gaming Commission).<ref></ref> Also, the word\n[[wiktionary:gaming|gaming]] is frequently used to describe activities that do\nnot involve wagering, especially online.\n\nGambling is also a major international commercial activity, with the legal\ngambling market totaling an estimated $335 billion in 2009.<ref></ref> In other\nforms, gambling can be conducted with materials which have a value, but are not\nreal money. For example, players of marbles games might wager marbles, and\nlikewise games of [[Pogs]] or [[Magic: The Gathering#Gambling|Magic: The\nGathering]] can be played with the collectible game pieces (respectively, small\ndiscs and trading cards) as stakes, resulting in a meta-game regarding the value\nof a player's collection of pieces.\n","title":"Gambling","headings":["History","Regulation","Types of gambling","Staking systems","Other uses of the term \"gambling\"","Psychological aspects","See also","References","External links","",""]},"micro-relation":["2: Europe","2: Blackjack","2: Keno","2: Insurance","2: Casino","2: Tokyo","2: Parimutuel_betting","2: Bookmaker","1: Money","1: Law","1: Gaming_control_board","1: Nevada_Gaming_Control_Board","1: UK","1: Gambling_Commission","1: Online_game","1: Meta-game","1: Hindu","1: Gambler's_Lament","1: Catholic_Church","1: Judaism","1: Hanukkah","1: Religious","1: Our_Sunday_Visitor","1: Social_cost","1: Gaming_regulation","1: China","1: Craps","1: Baccarat","1: Roulette","1: Pai_gow_poker","1: Pai_gow","1: Poker","1: Tourism#Special_forms_of_tourism","1: Monaco","1: Macau","1: Aleatory_contract","1: Statistical_randomness","1: Probability","1: Pachinko","1: Slot_machine","1: Video_poker","1: Dead_pool","1: Lottery","1: Pull-tab","1: Scratchcard","1: Mahjong","1: Card_game","1: Liars_poker","1: Contract_bridge","1: Lansquenet","1: Piquet","1: Put_option","1: Teen_patti","1: Carnival_game","1: Coin","1: Head_and_Tail","1: Two-up","1: Confidence_trick","1: Three-card_Monte","1: Shell_game","1: Dice_game","1: Backgammon","1: Liar's_dice","1: Passe-dix","1: Threes","1: Stock_market_index","1: Television","1: Election","1: Prediction_market","1: Horse_racing","1: Greyhound_racing","1: Service_industry","1: Football_pools","1: United_Kingdom","1: NCAA_Men's_Division_I_Basketball_Championship","1: Super_Bowl","1: Fantasy_sport","1: Moundball","1: Arbitrage","1: Bet_exchange","1: Expected_value","1: Card_counting","1: Due-column_betting","1: Kelly_criterion","1: Skydiving","1: Political_campaign","1: Insurable_interest","1: Raffle","1: Charitable_gambling","1: Investments","1: Stock","1: Real_estate","1: Speculation","1: Forex","1: Prediction_markets","1: Futures_contract","1: Recreation","1: Neurochemistry","1: Behavioral_addiction","1: Reinforcement","1: Fyodor_Dostoevsky","1: Get_rich_quick","1: Russian_roulette","1: Evolutionary_psychology","1: Faro_Ladies","1: Gambler's_conceit","1: Gambler's_fallacy","1: Gambler's_ruin","1: Gaming_mathematics","1: List_of_bets","1: Mobile_gambling","1: Online_gambling","1: Put_your_money_where_your_mouth_is","1: University_of_Nevada,_Las_Vegas","1: University_of_Nevada,_Reno"]}
