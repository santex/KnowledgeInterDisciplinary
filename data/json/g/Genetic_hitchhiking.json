More generally,\ngenetic hitchhiking can refer to changes in an allele's frequency due to any\nform of selection operating upon linked genes, including background selection\nagainst deleterious mutations.\n\nWhether a neutral allele becomes fixed is a matter of chance. The traditional\nview of this stochastic process is that it is dominated by sampling error,\nthat is genetic drift. But it may instead be dominated by whether the allele\nis linked to a good genetic background: this is known as genetic\ndraft. {{Cite journal\n| volume = 55 issue = 11 pages = 2161â2169 last = Gillespie first = John H.\n| title = Is the population size of a species relevant to its evolution? journal\n| = Evolution year = 2001 pmid = 11794777 url = http://www.ufscar.br/~evolucao/popgen/ref12-\n| 6.pdf\n}}\n","linknr":110,"url":"Genetic_hitchhiking","recorded":1362483381,"links":15,"instances":["population_genetics"],"pdf":["http://www.ufscar.br/~evolucao/popgen/ref12-6.pdf","http://www.ufscar.br/~evolucao/popgen/ref12-6.pdf"],"categories":["Genetics","Population genetics"],"headings":["Advantage to mutators","See also","References","Further reading"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["fixation","population_genetics"],["fixation","population_genetics"]],"members":["fixation"],"related":["Allele","Genetic_linkage","Chromosome","Selective_sweep","Fixation_(population_genetics)","Genetic_drift","Linkage_disequilibrium","Mutation","Fixation_(population_genetics)","Evolution","Genetic_recombination","Mutation_rate","Asexual_reproduction","Muller's_ratchet","Selective_sweep","Hill-Robertson_effect","John_Maynard_Smith"]}
