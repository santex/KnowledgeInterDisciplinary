Richards\nbegan his career with hometown club Swansea City, turning professional in August\n1981. He made his first team debut at the end of the 1981-82 season in Swansea's\n3-0 defeat at Aston Villa. He would appear 15 times the following season as\nSwansea suffered relegation from the First Division and would also feature in\nSwansea's 1983 Welsh Cup final success when the Swans defeated Wrexham 4-1.\nRichards was a regular the following season, appearing 34 times, but Swansea\nslipped to a second successive relegation. He reached only 16 appearances in the\n1984-85 season, departing Swansea at the end of the season for a spell in Sweden\nwith JÃ¶nkÃ¶pings SÃ¶dra IF.\n\nReturning to the Football League, Richards linked up with Lincoln City, making\nhis debut in the 1-1 home draw with Bristol City on 6 November 1985. Following\nthe sacking of Lincoln's manager John Pickering in December, Richards found\nhimself out of favour with the new manager George Kerr and moved on to\nCambridge United.\n\nIn July 1986 he moved on to Torquay United where a serious injury caused the\nend of his professional career. He moved into the non-league ranks and played\nfor Newport County in their ill-fated 1988-89 season before enjoying spells\nwith Llanelli, Saltash United, Forest Green Rovers, Barry Town and\nHaverfordwest County.\n\nHe resides in Swansea where he has been employed as a postman. {{cite web\n|title=Swansea City Past Players - R |url=http://www.swanseacity.premiumtv.co.u-\nk/page/Legends/0,,10354~1284908,00.html |publisher=Swansea City Official Web-\nsite |date=10 November 2007 |accessdate=2008-04-30}} He has been involved\nwith youth football coaching for a number of years, particularly with the\nSwansea City Bravehearts, a football club for children with disabilities.\nRichards has been involved with the club from its beginning in 2000 and is\npresently Head Coach and Chairperson. {{cite web |title=Swansea City\nBravehearts: History of the Bravehearts |url=http://beehive.thisissouthwales.co-\n.uk/default.asp?WCI=SiteHome&ID=12698&PageID=77471 |publisher=The South Wales\nBeehive |accessdate=2008-04-30}} In 2003 he was awarded City of Swansea\nCoach of the Year for his work with the Bravehearts. {{cite web\n|title=Hayley tops in Swansea a third time |url=http://www.swanseaharriers.co.u-\nk/index/HAYLEY%20TOPS%20IN%20SWANSEA%20A%20THIRD%20TIME.htm |date=27 September\n2003 |publisher=Swansea Harriers AC |accessdate=2008-04-30}} He is also a\ncoach within Swansea City's Centre of Excellence.
