It was named by Abraham\nGottlob Werner in 1789 from the Ancient Greek Î³ÏÎ¬ÏÏ (graphÅ), \"to\ndraw/write\", for its use in pencils, where it is commonly called\n'lead' (not to be confused with the metallic element lead). Unlike diamond\n(another carbon allotrope), graphite is an electrical conductor, a semimetal. It\nis, consequently, useful in such applications as arc lamp electrodes. Graphite\nis the most stable form of carbon under standard conditions. Therefore, it is\nused in thermochemistry as the standard state for defining the heat of formation\nof carbon compounds. Graphite may be considered the highest grade of coal, just\nabove anthracite and alternatively called meta-anthracite, although it is not\nnormally used as fuel because it is difficult to ignite.\n\nThere are three principal types of natural graphite, each occurring in different\ntypes of ore deposit: #Crystalline flake graphite (or flake graphite for short)\noccurs as isolated, flat, plate-like particles with hexagonal edges if unbroken\nand when broken the edges can be irregular or angular; #Amorphous graphite\noccurs as fine particles and is the result of thermal metamorphism of coal, the\nlast stage of coalification, and is sometimes called meta-anthracite. Very fine\nflake graphite is sometimes called amorphous in the trade; #Lump graphite (also\ncalled vein graphite) occurs in fissure veins or fractures and appears as\nmassive platy intergrowths of fibrous or acicular crystalline aggregates, and is\nprobably hydrothermal in origin.\n\nHighly ordered pyrolytic graphite or highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG)\nrefers to graphite with an angular spread between the graphite sheets of less\nthan 1Â°. This highest-quality synthetic form is used in scientific research, in\nparticular, as a standard for scanner calibration of scanning probe\nmicroscope. The name\n\"graphite fiber\" is also sometimes used to refer to carbon fiber or carbon fiber-\nreinforced polymer.\n","linknr":700,"url":"Graphite","recorded":1362375342,"links":98,"instances":["fiber","geology","geology","cue_sports","chemical_science","composite","crystal"],"pdf":["http://rruff.geo.arizona.edu/doclib/hom/graphite.pdf","http://www.galaxycapitalcorp.com/sites/default/files/110720%20-%20Electric%20Graphite%20-%20Initiating%20Coverage.pdf","http://www.galaxycapitalcorp.com/sites/default/files/110720%20-%20Electric%20Graphite%20-%20Initiating%20Coverage.pdf","http://metals.lincdigital.com.au/files/ASM_Tech_Notes/TN7-0506-Galvanic%20Corrosion.pdf","http://metals.lincdigital.com.au/files/ASM_Tech_Notes/TN7-0506-Galvanic%20Corrosion.pdf","http://www.galaxycapitalcorp.com/sites/default/files/110720%20-%20Electric%20Graphite%20-%20Initiating%20Coverage.pdf","http://www.galaxycapitalcorp.com/sites/default/files/110720%20-%20Electric%20Graphite%20-%20Initiating%20Coverage.pdf","http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Module-6.pdf","http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Module-6.pdf","http://www.iop.org/EJ/article/1468-6996/9/4/044102/stam8_4_044102.pdf","http://www.iop.org/EJ/article/1468-6996/9/4/044102/stam8_4_044102.pdf","http://www.northerngraphite.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Concern-over-battery-grade-graphite-supplies.pdf"],"categories":["Native
