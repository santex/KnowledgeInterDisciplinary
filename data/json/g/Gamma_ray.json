Gamma rays are ionizing radiation and are thus biologically\nhazardous. They are classically produced by the decay from high energy states of\natomic nuclei (gamma decay), but are also created by other processes. Paul\nVillard, a French chemist and physicist, discovered gamma radiation in 1900,\nwhile studying radiation emitted from radium during its gamma decay. Villard's\nradiation was named \"gamma rays\" by Ernest Rutherford in 1903.\n\nNatural sources of gamma rays on Earth include gamma decay from naturally\noccurring radioisotopes, and secondary radiation from atmospheric interactions\nwith cosmic ray particles. Rare terrestrial natural sources produce gamma rays\nthat are not of a nuclear origin, such as lightning strikes and terrestrial gamma-\nray flashes. Gamma rays are produced by a number of astronomical processes in\nwhich very high-energy electrons are produced, that in turn cause secondary\ngamma rays by the mechanisms of bremsstrahlung, inverse Compton scattering and\nsynchrotron radiation. A large fraction of such astronomical gamma rays are\nscreened by Earth's atmosphere and must be detected by spacecraft.\n\nGamma rays typically have frequencies above 10 exahertz (or >10 19\nHz), and therefore have energies above 100 keV and wavelengths less than 10\npicometers (less than the diameter of an atom). However, this is not a hard and\nfast definition, but rather only a rule-of-thumb description for natural\nprocesses. Gamma rays from radioactive decay are defined as gamma rays no matter\nwhat their energy, so that there is no lower limit to gamma energy derived from\nradioactive decay. Gamma decay commonly produces energies of a few hundred keV,\nand almost always less than 10 MeV. In astronomy, gamma rays are defined by\ntheir energy, and no production process need be specified. The energies of gamma\nrays from astronomical sources range over 10 TeV, at a level far too large to\nresult from radioactive decay. A notable example is extremely powerful bursts of\nhigh-energy radiation normally referred to as long duration gamma-ray bursts,\nwhich produce gamma rays by a mechanism not compatible with radioactive decay.\nThese bursts of gamma rays, thought to be due to the collapse of stars called\nhypernovas, are the most powerful events so far discovered in the cosmos.\n","linknr":824,"url":"Gamma_ray","recorded":1362675092,"links":105,"instances":["physics","unit","particle_radiation","atomic_structure","unit","unit"],"pdf":["http://radiology.rsna.org/content/251/1/166.full.pdf","http://radiology.rsna.org/content/251/1/166.full.pdf"],"categories":["Radiation","Radioactivity","Nuclear
