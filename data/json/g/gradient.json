In simple terms, the variation in\nspace of any quantity can be represented (e.g. graphically) by a slope. The\ngradient represents the steepness and direction of that slope.\n\nA generalization of the gradient for functions on a Euclidean space that have\nvalues in another Euclidean space is the Jacobian.
