GDP per capita is not a measure of personal income (See [[Gross\ndomestic product#Standard of living and GDP|Standard of living and GDP]]). Under\neconomic theory, GDP per capita exactly equals the gross domestic income (GDI)\nper capita (See [[Gross domestic income]]).\n\nGDP is related to national accounts, a subject in macroeconomics.
