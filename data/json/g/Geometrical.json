A mathematician who works in\nthe field of geometry is called a geometer. Geometry arose independently in a\nnumber of early cultures as a body of practical knowledge concerning lengths,\nareas, and volumes, with elements of a formal mathematical science emerging in\nthe West as early as Thales (6th Century BC). By the 3rd century BC geometry was\nput into an axiomatic form by Euclid, whose treatmentâEuclidean geometryâset a\nstandard for many centuries to follow. Martin J. Turner,Jonathan M.\nBlackledge,Patrick R. Andrews (1998). \"[http://books.google.com/books?id=oLXgFd-\nfKp78C&pg=PA1&dq&hl=en#v=onepage&q=&f=false Fractal geometry in digital\nimaging]\". Academic Press. p.1. ISBN 0-12-703970-8 Archimedes developed\ningenious techniques for calculating areas and volumes, in many ways\nanticipating modern integral calculus. The field of astronomy, especially\nmapping the positions of the stars and planets on the celestial sphere and\ndescribing the relationship between movements of celestial bodies, served as an\nimportant source of geometric problems during the next one and a half millennia.\nBoth geometry and astronomy were considered in the classical world to be part of\nthe Quadrivium, a subset of the seven liberal arts considered essential for a\nfree citizen to master.\n\nThe introduction of coordinates by RenÃ© Descartes and the concurrent\ndevelopments of algebra marked a new stage for geometry, since geometric\nfigures, such as plane curves, could now be represented analytically, i.e., with\nfunctions and equations. This played a key role in the emergence of\ninfinitesimal calculus in the 17th century. Furthermore, the theory of\nperspective showed that there is more to geometry than just the metric\nproperties of figures: perspective is the origin of projective geometry. The\nsubject of geometry was further enriched by the study of intrinsic structure of\ngeometric objects that originated with Euler and Gauss and led to the creation\nof topology and differential geometry.\n\nIn Euclid's time there was no clear distinction between physical space and\ngeometrical space. Since the 19th-century discovery of non-Euclidean geometry,\nthe concept of space has undergone a radical transformation, and the question\narose: which geometrical space best fits physical space? With the rise of formal\nmathematics in the 20th century, also 'space' (and 'point', 'line', 'plane')\nlost its intuitive contents, so today we have to distinguish between physical\nspace, geometrical spaces (in which 'space', 'point' etc. still have their\nintuitive meaning) and abstract spaces. Contemporary geometry considers\nmanifolds, spaces that are considerably more abstract than the familiar\nEuclidean space, which they only approximately resemble at small scales. These\nspaces may be endowed with additional structure, allowing one to speak about\nlength. Modern geometry has multiple strong bonds with physics, exemplified by\nthe ties between pseudo-Riemannian geometry and general relativity. One of the\nyoungest physical theories, string theory, is also very geometric in flavour.\n\nWhile the visual nature of geometry makes it initially more accessible than\nother parts of mathematics, such as algebra or number theory, geometric language\nis also used in contexts far removed from its traditional, Euclidean provenance\n(for example, in fractal geometry and algebraic geometry). It is quite\ncommon in algebraic geometry to speak about geometry of [[algebraic\nvariety|algebraic varieties]] over [[finite field]]s, possibly singular. From a\nnaÃ¯ve perspective, these objects are just finite sets of points, but by invoking\npowerful geometric imagery and using well developed geometric techniques, it is\npossible to find structure and establish properties that make them somewhat\nanalogous to the ordinary spheres or cones.\n","linknr":896,"url":"Geometrical","recorded":1362579072,"links":163,"instances":["mathematics","geometry","mathematics","geometry","geometry","algebraic_geometry","mathematics","graphical","geometry","drafting","mathematics","geometry","projective_geometry","geometry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Geometry|*"],"headings":["Overview","History
