period of time and\nthat are not related to any specific field of study. The GRE General Test is\noffered as a computer-based exam administered through qualified testing centers.\n\nIn the graduate school admissions process, the level of emphasis that is placed\nupon GRE scores varies widely between schools and between departments within\nschools. The importance of a GRE score can range from being a mere admission\nformality to an important selection factor.\n\nThe GRE was significantly overhauled in August 2011, resulting in an exam that\nis not adaptive on a question-by-question basis, but rather by section, so that\nthe performance on the first verbal and math sections determine the difficulty\nof the second sections presented. Overall, the test retained the sections and\nmany of the question types from its predecessor, but the scoring scale was\nchanged to a 130 to 170 scale (from a 200 to 800 scale).\n\nThe cost to take the test varies between US$130 and $210, depending on the\ncountry in which it is taken, although ETS will reduce the fee under certain\ncircumstances. They also promote financial aid to those GRE applicants who prove\neconomic hardship.<ref>MBA Channel: [http://www.mba-channel.com/channel/article/gre-\nwharton/ \"GRE:Wharton joins the club\"] 31 July 2009</ref> ETS does not release\nscores that are older than 5 years, although graduate program policies on the\nacceptance of scores older than 5 years will vary.\n","title":"Graduate%20Record%20Examinations","headings":["Structure","Scoring","Use in admissions","GRE Subject Tests","GRE and GMAT","Preparation","Testing locations","Validity","Criticism","2011 Revision of the GRE","GRE prior to October 2002","See also","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["2: Graduate_school","2: English_language","2: SAT","2: MCAT","2: GMAT","1: Standardized_test","1: United_States","1: Educational_Testing_Service","1: US$","1: Quantitative_property","1: Mathematics","1: Holism#Education_reform","1: Undergraduate","1: Abstract_thinking","1: Law_School_Admission_Test","1: GRE_Biochemistry,_Cell_and_Molecular_Biology_Test","1: GRE_Biology_Test","1: GRE_Chemistry_Test","1: GRE_Computer_Science_Test","1: GRE_Literature_in_English_Test","1: GRE_Mathematics_Test","1: GRE_Physics_Test","1: GRE_Psychology_Test","1: MBA","1: Wharton_School_of_the_University_of_Pennsylvania","1: MIT_Sloan_School_of_Management","1: Columbia_Business_School","1: Test_preparation","1: Item_response_theory","1: Robert_Sternberg","1: Oklahoma_State_UniversityâStillwater","1: Yale_University","1: Correlation","1: Kaplan,_Inc","1: Knewton","1: Jose_Ferreira","1: List_of_admissions_tests","1: Business_School","1: Law_School","1: Medical_School","1: LSAT","1: Graduate_Aptitude_Test_in_Engineering","1: Common_Admission_Test","1: TOEFL","1: IELTS","1: Licensure","1: Master's_degree","1: Doctorate_degree","1: First_professional_degree","1: Professional_degree","1: Terminal_degree"]}
