{"cursor":"3474","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Music examinations' are a method of formally assessing the accomplishments of\npupils learning musical instruments.\n\nAlthough there are music examinations available to school and university\nstudents alongside other regular qualifications and assessments, there are also\na number of independent bodies who solely provide assessment in musical ability\nwhich are open to all.\n\nTrinity College London was the first organisation to offer examinations in music\nto external students in 1877. As of 2012, Trinity College London conducts around\n600,000 assessments worldwide per year, as does the Associated Board of the\nRoyal Schools of Music. Other examination boards based in the UK include the\nLondon College of Music; Victoria College of Music, the National College of\nMusic and [http://www.rockschool.co.uk/ Rockschool].\n\nMany students who enter these exams have taken a course of music lessons with a\nprivate tutor, although some are self-taught. Often this is a way for children\nto receive music training over and above what is provided at their usual place\nof learning, although private lessons are also popular with adults who turn to\nmusic later in life.\n\nMusic exams are set in both theory and practical aspects. The theory\nexaminations are taken by pupils of all instruments and typically cover areas\nsuch as musical notation, construction of scales and composition.\n\nThe practical exams concentrate on the particular instrument favoured by the\npupil, for example piano, guitar or flute. They cover elements such as playing\nset pieces, technical work including scales, sight reading, aural, musical\nknowledge and improvisation.\n\nIn the United Kingdom the music exams are graded from 1 to 8, with Grade 1 being\nthe entry level, and Grade 8 being the standard required for entry to higher\nstudy in a music college. Additionally, Trinity College London offers an Initial\nlevel qualification at Entry Level 3 of the UK Qualifications and Credit\nFramework, and ABRSM offer a Prep Test qualification as a useful preparation\nbefore the Grade 1 exam.\n\nOther reputable music examination boards offering examinations on musical\ninstruments and music theory include:-\n\n*Australian Music Examinations Board ([http://www.ameb.edu.au/site/index.cfm\nwww.ameb.edu.au])\n\n*New Zealand Music Examinations Board ([http://www.nzmeb.org/ www.nzmeb.org])\n\n*Suro Bharati Sangeet Kala Kendra (Board of music and fine arts education),\nIndia ([http://www.sskalakendra.org/ www.sskalakendra.org])\n\n*The Royal Conservatory of Music, Canada ([http://www.rcmexaminations.org/\nwww.rcmexaminations.org])\n\n*University of South Africa - Directorate Music\n([http://www.unisa.ac.za/Default.asp?Cmd=ViewContent&ContentID=2049\nwww.unisa.ac.za])\n\n*Vienna Music Examination Board (Wiener Musik-PrÃ¼fungskommission)\n([http://www.vmeb.org/ www.vmeb.org])\n\nDifferent music examination boards may have different grade levels for\ninstruments and music theory examination. Depending on how they are recognised\nby regulatory bodies such as [http://www.ofqual.gov.uk/ Ofqual], examination\nresults or credits may be transferable from one exam board to the other.\n","linknr":109,"url":"Grade_(music)","recorded":1363418041,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Music_examination&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Music_examination&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","/wiki/Music_examination","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","/w/index.php?title=Grade_(music)&redirect=no","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Music_examination&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/Musical_instruments","/wiki/Examination","/wiki/School","/wiki/University","/wiki/Trinity_College_London","/wiki/Associated_Board_of_the_Royal_Schools_of_Music","/wiki/London_College_of_Music_Examinations","/wiki/Victoria_College_of_Music,_London","/wiki/National_College_of_Music","http://www.rockschool.co.uk/","/wiki/Music_lesson","/wiki/Music_theory","/wiki/Musical_notation","/wiki/Major_scale","/wiki/Musical_composition","/wiki/Piano","/wiki/Guitar","/wiki/Flute","/wiki/Musical_scale","/wiki/Sight_reading","/wiki/United_Kingdom","/wiki/Australian_Music_Examinations_Board","http://www.ameb.edu.au/site/index.cfm","http://www.nzmeb.org/","http://www.sskalakendra.org/","/wiki/The_Royal_Conservatory_of_Music","http://www.rcmexaminations.org/","/wiki/University_of_South_Africa","http://www.unisa.ac.za/Default.asp?Cmd=ViewContent&ContentID=2049","http://www.vmeb.org/","http://www.ofqual.gov.uk/","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Music_examination&oldid=544379819","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:School_examinations","/wiki/Category:Music","/wiki/Category:Articles_lacking_sources_from_December_2009","/wiki/Category:All_articles_lacking_sources","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Music+examination&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Music+examination","/wiki/Music_examination","/wiki/Talk:Music_examination","#","/wiki/Music_examination","/w/index.php?title=Music_examination&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Music_examination&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Music_examination","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Music_examination","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Music_examination&oldid=544379819","/w/index.php?title=Music_examination&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Music_examination&id=544379819","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Music+examination","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Music+examination&oldid=544379819&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Music_examination&printable=yes","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_examination","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=skins.vector&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","/w/index.php?title=MediaWiki:Gadget-ReferenceTooltips.js&action=raw&ctype=text/javascript&508635914","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scr
