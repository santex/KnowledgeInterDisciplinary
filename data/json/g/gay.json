      "text" : "\n\n\n\n'Gay' is a term that primarily refers to a homosexual person or the trait of\nbeing homosexual.\n\nThe term was originally used to refer to feelings of being \"carefree\", \"happy\",\nor \"bright and showy\". The term's use as a reference to homosexuality may date\nas early as the late 19th century, but its use gradually increased in the 20th\ncentury.<ref name=etymonline></ref> In modern English, \"gay\" has come to be used\nas an adjective, and as a noun, referring to the people, especially to males,\nand the practices and cultures associated with homosexuality.\n\nBy the end of the 20th century, the word \"gay\" was recommended by major LGBT\ngroups and style guides to describe people attracted to members of the same\nsex.<ref></ref><ref></ref> At about the same time, a new, pejorative use became\nprevalent in some parts of the world. In the Anglosphere, this connotation,\namong younger speakers, has a derisive meaning equivalent to rubbish or stupid\n(as in \"That's so gay.\"). In this use, the word does not mean \"homosexual\", so\nit can be used, for example, to refer to an inanimate object or abstract concept\nof which one disapproves. This usage can also refer to weakness or unmanliness.\nWhen used in these ways, the extent to which it still retains connotations of\nhomosexuality has been debated and harshly criticized.<ref\nname=\"Winterman\"></ref><ref></ref>\n",
