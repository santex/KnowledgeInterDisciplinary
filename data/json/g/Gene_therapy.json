If the\n treatment is successful, the new gene will make functional protein to treat a\n disease.]]\n\n'Gene therapy' is the use of DNA as a pharmaceutical agent to treat disease. It\nderives its name from the idea that DNA can be used to supplement or alter genes\nwithin an individual's cells as a therapy to treat disease. The most common form\nof gene therapy involves using DNA that encodes a functional, therapeutic gene\nto replace a mutated gene. Other forms involve directly correcting a mutation,\nor using DNA that encodes a therapeutic protein drug (rather than a natural\nhuman gene) to provide treatment. In gene therapy, DNA that encodes a\ntherapeutic protein is packaged within a \"vector\", which is used to get the DNA\ninside cells within the body. Once inside, the DNA becomes expressed by the cell\nmachinery, resulting in the production of therapeutic protein, which in turn\ntreats the patient's disease.\n\nGene therapy was first conceptualized in 1972, with the authors urging caution\nbefore commencing gene therapy studies in humans.\nThe first FDA-approved gene therapy experiment in the United States occurred in\n1990, when Ashanti DeSilva was treated for ADA-SCID. Since then, over 1,700 clinical trials have been\nconducted using a number of techniques for gene therapy. [http://www.wiley.com/legacy/wileychi/genmed/clinical/ J. Gene Med.\nGene Therapy Clinical Trials Database]. wiley.com/\n\nAlthough early clinical failures led many to dismiss gene therapy as over-hyped,\nclinical successes in 2006â2011 have bolstered new optimism in the promise of\ngene therapy. These include successful treatment of patients with the retinal\ndisease Leber's congenital amaurosis, X-linked SCID, ADA-SCID,\nadrenoleukodystrophy, chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), and Parkinson's disease. These recent clinical successes\nhave led to a renewed interest in gene therapy, with several articles in\nscientific and popular publications calling for continued investment in the\nfield.

The New York Times.\n\nIn 2012, Glybera became the first gene therapy treatment to be approved for\nclinical use in either Europe or the United States after its endorsement by the\nEuropean Commission.\n","linknr":1056,"url":"Gene_therapy","recorded":1362507547,"links":81,"instances":["united_states","molecular_biology","biology","journal"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Applied
