Mendel demonstrated that the inheritance of certain\ntraits in pea plants follows particular patterns, now referred to as the laws of\nMendelian inheritance. The profound significance of Mendel's work was not\nrecognized until the turn of the 20th century, when the independent rediscovery\nof these laws initiated the modern science of genetics.\n","linknr":441,"url":"Gregor_Johann_Mendel","recorded":1362486439,"links":102,"instances":["genetics","biological","school","vražné","biology","geneticist"],"pdf":["http://papa.indstate.edu/amcbt/volume_27/v27-2.pdf","http://papa.indstate.edu/amcbt/volume_27/v27-2.pdf","http://www.esp.org/foundations/genetics/classical/gm-65.pdf","http://www.esp.org/foundations/genetics/classical/gm-65.pdf"],"categories":["Augustinian friars","Austrian biologists","Austrian botanists","Austrian Roman Catholics","Botanists with author abbreviations","Czech biologists","Czech botanists","Czech Roman Catholics","Deaths from nephritis","Geneticists","Moravian-German people","People from Austrian Silesia","People from Brno","Roman Catholic cleric–scientists","Roman Catholic philosophers","Silesian-German people","1822 births","1884 deaths"],"headings":["Biography","Rediscovery of Mendel's work","Controversy","See also","References","Bibliography","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/Padlock-silver.svg/20px-Padlock-silver.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d3/Gregor_Mendel.png/220px-Gregor_Mendel.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/Mendelian_inheritance.svg/220px-Mendelian_inheritance.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["hynčice","vražné"],["hynčice","vražné"],["trait","biological"],["hynčice","vražné"],["hynčice","vražné"],["gymnasium","school"],["hybrid","biology"],["dominance","genetics"],["curt_stern","geneticist"],["hynčice","vražné"]],"members":["dominance","trait","gymnasium","hynčice","hybrid","curt_stern"],"related":["Hynčice_(Vražné)","Austrian_Empire","Hynčice_(Vražné)","Czech_Republic","Brno","Austria-Hungary","Czech_Republic","Genetics","Abbey_of_St._Thomas_in_Brno","University_of_Olomouc","University_of_Vienna","Genetics","German_language","Silesians","Augustinians","Friar","Science","Genetics","Biological_inheritance","Trait_(biological)","Pea","Mendelian_inheritance","Ethnic_Germans","Hynčice_(Vražné)","Austrian_Silesia","Austrian_Empire","Hynčice_(Vražné)","Czech_Republic","Beekeeping","Gymnasium_(school)","Opava","Philosophical_Institute","Johann_Karl_Nestler","Physics","Friedrich_Franz","Augustinians","St_Thomas's_Abbey,_Brno","Religious_life","University_of_Vienna","Abbot","Christian_Doppler","Bee_hive","Astronomy","Meteorology","University_of_Olomouc","Friedrich_Franz","Johann_Karl_Nestler","Pea","Purebred","Recessive","Alleles","Hybrid_(biology)","Dominance_(genetics)","Law_of_Segregation","Law_of_independent_assortment","Moravia","Charles_Darwin","Jacob_Bronowski","Species","List_of_botanists_by_author_abbreviation","Brno","Moravia","Austria-Hungary","Nephritis","Leoš_Janáček","Blending_inheritance","Quantitative_genetics","Charles_Darwin","Pangenesis","Blending_inheritance","Hugo_de_Vries","Carl_Correns","Erich_von_Tschermak","Genotype","Phenotype","Biostatistics","Karl_Pearson","W.F.R._Weldon","William_Bateson","Genetics","R._A._Fisher","Natural_selection","Modern_evolutionary_synthesis","Confirmation_bias","Genetic_linkage","List_of_Roman_Catholic_cleric–scientists","Mendel_Museum_of_Genetics","Mendel_Polar_Station","Mendel_University_Brno","Mendelian_error","Mendelcollege","William_Bateson","Reginald_Punnett","Curt_Stern_(geneticist)","Ronald_A._Fisher","Virtual_Laboratory","Max_Planck_Institute_for_the_History_of_Science","Genetics","Hynčice_(Vražné)","Silesia","Brno","Moravia"]}
