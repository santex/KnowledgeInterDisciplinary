{"cursor":"53464","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\n\nIn linguistics, 'grammatical gender' is a system of noun classification present\nin approximately one fourth of the world's languages, including the Indo-\nEuropean languages (Spanish, German, Persian, Hindi, etc.), Semitic languages\n(Arabic, Amharic, Hebrew, etc.) and others. In these languages, every noun must\npertain to one category called 'gender'. The different genders form a closed set\nof usually 2 or 3 divisions, in which all the nouns are included. Very few items\ncan belong to several classes at once. Common gender divisions include:\nmasculine, feminine, neuter, animate, or inanimate.\n\nIn a few languages, the gender assignation of nouns is solely determined by\ntheir meaning or attributes, like biological sex, humanness, animacy. However,\nin most languages, this semantic division is only partially valid, and many\nnouns may belong to a gender category that contrasts with their meaning (e.g.\nthe word \"manliness\" could be of feminine gender). It is in Spanish\n(hombrÃ­a, virilidad, masculinidad), Latin (virtÅ«s), German (MÃ¤nnlichkeit,\nVirilitÃ¤t), Russian (Ð¼ÑÐ¶ÐµÑÑÐ²ÐµÐ½Ð½Ð¾ÑÑÑ - mÃºÅ¾estvennostâ) or Hindi (à¤®à¤°à¥à¤¦à¤¾à¤¨à¤à¥ -\nmardÃ¢negi), among others In this case, the gender assignation can also be\ninfluenced by the morphology or phonology of the noun, or in some cases, can be\ncompletely arbitrary.\n\nGrammatical gender manifests itself when words related to a noun like\ndeterminers, pronouns or adjectives change their form ([[inflection]]) according\nto the gender of noun they refer to (''agreement''). The parts of speech\naffected by gender agreement, the circumstances in which it occurs, and the way\nwords are marked for gender vary cross-linguistically. Gender inflection may\ninteract with other grammatical categories like number or case.\n\nGrammatical gender is typical of the Afro-Asiatic, Dravidian, Indo-European, and\nNortheast Caucasian language families; as well as several Australian aboriginal\nlanguages like Dyirbal, and Kalaw Lagaw Ya. Also, most NigerâCongo languages\nhave extensive systems of noun classes, which can be grouped into several\ngrammatical genders.\n\nGrammatical gender is usually absent from the Altaic, Austronesian, Sino-\nTibetan, Uralic and most Native American language families.\n\nModern English is not considered to have grammatical gender, although\nhistorically it did.\n","linknr":636,"url":"Grammatical_gender","recorded":1362543061,"links":76,"instances":["grammar","linguistics","norm","linguistics","linguistics","linguistics","grammar","linguistics","name","linguistics"],"pdf":["http://www.freidok.uni-freiburg.de/volltexte/1412/pdf/Diss_Freidok.pdf","http://www.freidok.uni-freiburg.de/volltexte/1412/pdf/Diss_Freidok.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20080414093055/http://ling.upenn.edu/~urih/numerals.pdf"],"categories":["Linguistic
