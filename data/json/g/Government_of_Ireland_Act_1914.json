It was the third such bill introduced by a\n  Liberal government in a thirty-year period in response to the Irish Home\n  Rule movement.\n\nThe Act was the first law ever passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom\nthat sought to establish devolved government in any part of the United Kingdom.\nHowever, the implementation of both it and the equally controversial Welsh\nChurch Act 1914 was formally postponed for a minimum of twelve months with the\noutbreak of the First World War. Subsequent developments in Ireland led to\nfurther postponements, meaning that the Act never took effect; it was finally\nsuperseded by a fourth home rule bill, enacted as the Government of Ireland Act\n1920, which partitioned Ireland, creating Northern Ireland and Southern Ireland,\nboth intended to enjoy Home Rule.\n\nIn 1922, rather than Home Rule as envisioned in the 1914 and 1920 Acts, Southern\nIreland was granted dominion status as the Irish Free State, while Northern\nIreland, the island's six north-eastern counties, was given the right to decide\nto remain in Union with Great Britain; a right which it quickly exercised.\n","linknr":318,"url":"Government_of_Ireland_Act_1914","recorded":1375090347,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Government_of_Ireland_Act_1914&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Government_of_Ireland_Act_1914&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a9/Coat_of_Arms_of_the_United_Kingdom_%281837-1952%29.svg/140px-Coat_of_Arms_of_the_United_Kingdom_%281837-1952%29.svg.png","/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Long_title","/wiki/Citation_of_United_Kingdom_legislation","/wiki/Ireland","/wiki/Royal_Assent","/wiki/Coming_into_force","/wiki/Suspensory_Act_1914","/wiki/Government_of_Ireland_Bill_1886","/wiki/Irish_Government_Bill_1893","/wiki/Local_Government_(Ireland)_Act_1898","/wiki/Suspensory_Act_1914","/wiki/Government_of_Ireland_Act_1920","/wiki/Act_of_Parliament","/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Home_rule","/wiki/United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland","/wiki/Ireland","/wiki/Liberal_(UK)","/wiki/Irish_Home_Rule_movement","/wiki/Devolution","/wiki/Welsh_Church_Act_1914","/wiki/Suspensory_Act_1914","/wiki/World_War_I","/wiki/Government_of_Ireland_Act_1920","/wiki/Partition_of_Ireland","/wiki/Northern_Ireland","/wiki/Southern_Ireland","/wiki/Dominion_status","/wiki/Irish_Free_State","/wiki/Great_Britain","#Background","#The_Bill","#Ulster_crisis","#Partition","#The_passing_of_the_Bill","#Notes","#See_also","#References","/w/index.php?title=Government_of_Ireland_Act_1914&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/House_of_Lords","/wiki/David_Lloyd_George","/wiki/Liberal_(UK)","/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)","/wiki/John_Redmond","/wiki/Irish_Parliamentary_Party","/wiki/House_of_Commons_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Irish_Home_Rule_movement","#cite_note-Lydon326-1","/wiki/Parliament_Act_1911","/wiki/Veto","#cite_note-Lydon326-1","/w/index.php?title=Government_of_Ireland_Act_1914&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/File:St_Patrick%27s_saltire.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/20/St_Patrick%27s_saltire.svg/80px-St_Patrick%27s_saltire.svg.png","/wiki/Parliament_Act_1911","/wiki/Privy_Council_of_Ireland","/wiki/Government_of_Ireland_Act_1920","/wiki/H._H._Asquith","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Bicameralism","/wiki/Irish_Parliament","/wiki/Dublin","/wiki/Senate_of_Southern_Ireland","/wiki/House_of_Commons_of_Southern_Ireland","/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Dublin_Castle_administration_in_Ireland","/wiki/Lord_Lieutenant_of_Ireland","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Royal_Assent","/w/index.php?title=Government_of_Ireland_Act_1914&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/Home_Rule_Crisis","/wiki/Irish_Unionist_Alliance","/wiki/Sir_Edward_Carson","/wiki/Ulster_Volunteers","/wiki/Ulster_Covenant","/wiki/James_Craig,_1st_Viscount_Craigavon","#cite_note-4","/wiki/Paramilitary","#cite_note-5","/wiki/Irish_Volunteers","#cite_note-6","/wiki/Curragh_incident","#cite_note-7","/w/index.php?title=Government_of_Ireland_Act_1914&action=edit&section=4","/wiki/Third_reading#Third_reading","/wiki/Irish_Unionist_Party","/wiki/Ulster","/wiki/House_of_Lords","/wiki/George_V_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Buckingham_Palace_Conference","#cite_note-8","/w/index.php?title=Government_of_Ireland_Act_1914&action=edit&section=5","/wiki/World_War_I","/wiki/Suspensory_Act_1914","/wiki/Royal_Assent","/wiki/Welsh_Church_Act_1914","#cite_note-Jackson.2C_Alvin:_p.164-9","#cite_note-10","#cite_note-11","#cite_note-Jackson.2C_Alvin:_p.164-9","/wiki/Easter_Rising","/wiki/H._H._Asquith","/wiki/World_War_I","/wiki/David_Lloyd_George","#cite_note-12","/wiki/Irish_Convention","/wiki/Horace_Plunkett","/wiki/Irish_War_of_Independence","/wiki/Government_of_Ireland_Act_1920","/wiki/Northern_Ireland","/wiki/Southern_Ireland","/wiki/Anglo-Irish_Treaty","/wiki/Irish_Free_State","/w/index.php?title=Government_of_Ireland_Act_1914&action=edit&section=6","#cite_ref-Lydon326_1-0","#cite_ref-Lydon326_1-1","http://books.google.ie/books?id=yKA9AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA326#v=onepage&q&f=false","#cite_ref-2","http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1912/apr/11/government-of-ireland-bill","#cite_ref-3","http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1912/apr/11/financial-arrangements","#cite_ref-4","/wiki/ATQ_Stewart","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0571080669","
