Illustration by Frederic Remington, 1890.]]\n\nThe 'Ghost Dance' (Caddo: 'NanissÃ¡anah', Edmonds, Randlett. Nusht'uhti?ti?\nHasinay: Caddo Phrasebook. Richardson, TX: Various Indian Peoples Publishing,\n2003: 19. ISBN 1-884655-00-9. also called the 'Ghost Dance of 1890') was a\nnew religious movement which was incorporated into numerous Native American\nbelief systems. According to the prophet Jack Wilson (''Wovoka'')'s teachings,\nproper practice of the dance would reunite the living with the spirits of the\ndead and bring peace, prosperity, and unity to native peoples throughout the\nregion. The basis for the Ghost Dance, the circle dance,\nis a traditional ritual which has been used by many Native Americans since\nprehistoric times, but this new form was first practiced among the Nevada Paiute\nin 1889. The practice swept throughout much of the Western United States,\nquickly reaching areas of California and Oklahoma. As the Ghost Dance spread\nfrom its original source, Native American tribes synthesized selective aspects\nof the ritual with their own beliefs. This process often created change in both\nthe society that integrated it, and in the ritual itself.\n\nThe chief figure in the movement was the prophet of peace, Jack Wilson, known as\n[[Wovoka]] among the Paiute. He prophesied a peaceful end to white expansion\nwhile preaching goals of clean living, an honest life, and cross-cultural\ncooperation by Native Americans. Practice of the Ghost Dance movement was\nbelieved to have contributed to Lakota resistance. In the Wounded Knee Massacre\nin 1890, U.S. Army forces killed at least 153 Lakota Sioux. Utley, Robert,\nThe Last Days of the Sioux Nation, Yale University Press, 1964 The Sioux\nvariation on the Ghost Dance tended towards millenarianism, an innovation that\ndistinguished the Sioux interpretation from Jack Wilson's original teachings.\nThe Caddo Nation still practices the Ghost Dance today.
