Barry N. Taylor, Guide for\n the Use of the International System of Units (SI), 1995, NIST Special\n Publication 811, [http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP811/appenB9.html#ACCELERATION\n Appendix B]. BIPM SI brochure, 8th ed. 2006,\n [http://www.bipm.org/en/si/si_brochure/chapter4/table9.html Table 9: Non-SI\n units associated with the CGS and the CGS-Gaussian system of\n units]. Some sources, such as the\n [http://www.unc.edu/~rowlett/units/dictG.html University of North Carolina],\n the [http://www.esa.int/esaLP/ESAK4XZK0TC_LPgoce_0.html European Space\n Agency], and [http://www.conversiontables.info/index.php5?page=conversion_fac-\n tors&item=Acceleration%20%5Bgeneric%5D ConversionTables.com] state that the\n unit name is \"galileo\". The NIST and the BIPM are here considered as more\n authoritative sources regarding the proper unit name. The gal is defined\n as 1 centimeter per second squared (1 cm/s 2). The 'milliGal'\n (mGal) and 'microGal' (ÂµGal) refer respectively to one thousandth and one\n millionth of a Gal.\n\nThe gal is not part of the International System of Units (known by its French-\nlanguage initials \"SI\"). However, in 1978 the CIPM decided that it was\npermissible to use the gal \"with the SI until the CIPM considers that [its] use\nis no longer necessary.\" NIST Guide to SI Units; Section 5, Units Outside the SI;\nSubsection 5.2: [http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP811/sec05.html#5.2 Units\ntemporarily accepted for use with the SI].\n\nThe gal is a derived unit, defined in terms of the centimeter-gram-second (CGS)\nbase unit of length, the centimeter, and the second, which is the base unit of\ntime in both the CGS as well as the modern SI system. In SI base units,\n1 Gal is precisely equal to 0.01 m/s 2.\n\nThe acceleration due to Earthâs gravity (see [[Standard gravity]]) at its\nsurface is 976 to 983 Gal, the variation being due mainly to differences in\nlatitude and elevation. Mountains and masses of lesser density within the\nEarth's crust typically cause variations in gravitational acceleration of tens\nto hundreds of milligals (mGal). The gravity gradient (variation with height)\nabove Earth's surface is about 3.1 ÂµGal per centimeter of height (),\nresulting in a maximum difference of about 2 Gal (0.02 m/s 2)\nfrom the top of Mount Everest to sea level.

As\nwith the torr and its symbol, the unit name (gal) and its symbol (Gal) are\nspelled identically except that the latter is capitalized.\n\nThe gal is named after Galileo Galilei, a physicist who made the first\nmeasurements of the Earth's gravity, and who dropped items out of the Tower of\nPisa to see if weight had a bearing on the time taken for them to fall.\n\nIt can also be used to measure peak ground acceleration in earthquakes.\n","linknr":151,"url":"Gal_(unit)","recorded":1362560798,"links":47,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.geo.ucalgary.ca/~wu/Goph547/Gravimeters.pdf"],"categories":["Galileo Galilei","Units of acceleration","Centimetre–gram–second system of units","Gravimetry"],"headings":["Conversions","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a9/Southern_ocean_gravity_hg.png/231px-Southern_ocean_gravity_hg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Acceleration","Gravimetry","NIST","BIPM","International_System_of_Units","French_language","International_Committee_for_Weights_and_Measures","Centimeter-gram-second","Centimeter","Second","Latitude","Elevation","Gravitational_acceleration","Gradient","Mount_Everest","Torr","Galileo_Galilei","Peak_ground_acceleration","G-force","Standard_gravity","Earth's_gravity","Metre_per_second_squared","Foot_per_second_squared","Gravity_gradiometry","Acceleration","Gravitation","Gravitational_acceleration","Gravitational_constant","Gravitational_field"]}
