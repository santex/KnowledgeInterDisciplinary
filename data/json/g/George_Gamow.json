He discovered a\ntheoretical explanation of alpha decay via quantum tunneling, and worked on\nradioactive decay of the atomic nucleus, star formation, stellar nucleosynthesis\nand Big Bang nucleosynthesis (which he collectively called nucleocosmogenesis),\nand molecular genetics.\n\nIn his middle and late career, Gamow focused more on teaching, and became well\nknown as an author of popular books on science, including [[One Two Three ...\nInfinity]], and the [[Mr Tompkins|Mr. Tompkins ...]] series of books\n(1939â1967). Some of his books are still in print more than a half-century after\ntheir original publication, and have become classic but still-relevant\nintroductions to fundamental principles of mathematics and science.\n","linknr":479,"url":"George_Gamow","recorded":1362483930,"links":58,"instances":["paris"],"pdf":["http://www.nasonline.org/publications/biographical-memoirs/memoir-pdfs/gamow-george.pdf"],"categories":["Cosmologists","20th-century
