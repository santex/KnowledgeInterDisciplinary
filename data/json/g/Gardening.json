{"cursor":"30924","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n in an English garden]]\n\n'Gardening' is the practice of growing and cultivating plants as part of\nhorticulture. In gardens, ornamental plants are often grown for their flowers,\nfoliage, or overall appearance; useful plants, such as root vegetables, leaf\nvegetables, fruits, and herbs, are grown for consumption, for use as dyes, or\nfor medicinal or cosmetic use. A 'gardener' is someone who practices gardening,\neither professionally or as a hobby. Gardening is considered to be a relaxing\nactivity for many people.\n\nGardening ranges in scale from fruit orchards, to long boulevard plantings with\none or more different types of shrubs, trees and herbaceous plants, to\nresidential yards including lawns and foundation plantings, to plants in large\nor small containers grown inside or outside. Gardening may be very specialized,\nwith only one type of plant grown, or involve a large number of different\nplants in mixed plantings. It involves an active participation in the growing\nof plants, and tends to be labor intensive, which differentiates it from\nfarming or forestry.\n","linknr":722,"url":"Gardening","recorded":1362373126,"links":93,"instances":["landform","land","tool","architecture","plant","gardening","horticulture","plant","furniture","architecture","greenhouse"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Horticulture
