{"cursor":"2441","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'' with gemmae.]] A 'gemma' (plural gemmae) is a single cell, or a mass of\ncells, or a modified bud of tissue, that detaches from the parent and develops\ninto a new individual. This type of asexual reproduction is referred to as\nfragmentation. It is a means of asexual propagation in plants. These structures\nare commonly found in fungi, algae, liverworts and mosses, but also in some\nflowering plants such as pygmy sundews and some species of butterworts.\n","linknr":126,"url":"Gemma_(botany)","recorded":1362480615,"links":18,"instances":["botany","reproduction","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Plant morphology","Fungal morphology and anatomy","Cryptogams","Plant reproduction"],"headings":["In bryophytes","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/DroseraRoseanaGemmae.jpg/220px-DroseraRoseanaGemmae.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2e/Thallose_liverwort_%28Marchantia_and_Lunularia_spp.%29_showing_clonal_plantlets_in_gemma_cups.jpg/220px-Thallose_liverwort_%28Marchantia_and_Lunularia_spp.%29_showing_clonal_plantlets_in_gemma_cups.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8d/Fern.jpg/35px-Fern.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cell","biology"],["fragmentation","reproduction"],["turion","botany"]],"members":["turion","fragmentation","cell"],"related":["Cell_(biology)","Fragmentation_(reproduction)","Asexual_reproduction","Plant","Fungi","Alga","Marchantiophyta","Moss","Flowering_plant","Sundew","Butterwort","Lunularia","Haploid","Gametophyte","Bulbils","Turion_(botany)"]}
