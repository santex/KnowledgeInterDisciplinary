The city is situated on the River\nClyde in the country's West Central Lowlands. Glasgow grew from a small rural\nsettlement on the River Clyde to become one of the largest seaports in the\nworld. Expanding from the medieval bishopric of Glasgow and the later\nestablishment of the University of Glasgow in the 15th century, it became a\nmajor centre of the Scottish Enlightenment in the 18th century. From the 18th\ncentury the city also grew as one of Britain's main hubs of trade, along with\nBristol and Liverpool, with British North America and the British West Indies.\n\nWith the onset of the Industrial Revolution, the population and economy of\nGlasgow and the surrounding region expanded exponentially to become one of the\nworld's pre-eminent centres of chemicals, textiles and engineering; most notably\nin the shipbuilding and marine engineering industry, which produced many\ninnovative and famous vessels. Glasgow was known as the \"[[List of second\ncities|Second City]] of the [[British Empire]]\" for much of the Victorian era\nand Edwardian period. Today it is\none of Europe's top ten financial centres and is home to\nmany of Scotland's leading businesses. Glasgow is also ranked as the\n57th most liveable city in the world.\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries Glasgow grew in population, eventually\nreaching a peak of 1,128,473 in 1939, and was the fourth-largest city\nin Europe, after London, Paris and Berlin. In the 1960s,\ncomprehensive urban renewal projects resulting in large-scale relocation of\npeople to new towns and peripheral suburbs, followed by successive boundary\nchanges, have reduced the current population of the City of Glasgow council area\nto 592,000, with 1,199,629\npeople living in the Greater Glasgow urban area. The entire region surrounding\nthe conurbation covers approximately 2.3 million people, 41% of Scotland's\npopulation. Glasgow will host the 2014 Commonwealth Games\nand is currently a candidate city to host the 2018 Summer Youth Olympics.
