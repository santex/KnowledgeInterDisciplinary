The American Academy of Periodontology. Proceedings of\nthe World Workshop in Clinical Periodontics. Chicago:The American Academy of\nPeriodontology; 1989:I/23-I/24. The most common form of gingivitis, and\nthe most common form of periodontal disease overall, is in response to bacterial\nbiofilms (also called plaque) adherent to tooth surfaces, termed plaque-induced\ngingivitis. In the absence of treatment, gingivitis may progress to\nperiodontitis, which is a destructive form of periodontal disease.\n\nWhile in some sites or individuals gingivitis never progresses to\nperiodontitis, data indicates that periodontitis is always preceded\nby gingivitis.\n","linknr":658,"url":"Gingivitis","recorded":1362511539,"links":49,"instances":["dentistry","dental","dermatology","dental","medicine"],"pdf":["http://perio.org/resources-products/classification.pdf","http://perio.org/resources-products/classification.pdf"],"categories":["Inflammations","Periodontal disorders"],"headings":["Classification","Signs and symptoms","Cause","Diagnosis","Prevention","Treatment","Complications","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/28/Gingivitis_before_and_after-2.jpg/230px-Gingivitis_before_and_after-2.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Dentistry_stub.svg/14px-Dentistry_stub.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["debridement","dental"],["stippling","dentistry"],["ulcer","dermatology"],["calculus","dental"],["saline","medicine"]],"members":["stippling","calculus","ulcer","debridement","saline"],"related":["Debridement_(dental)","Inflammation","Gingiva","Periodontal_disease","Periodontal_disease","Biofilms","Dental_plaque","Periodontitis","Gingival","Symptom","Halitosis","Stippling_(dentistry)","Epithelium","Ulcer_(dermatology)","Host_response","Dental_plaque","Gingival_sulcus","Removable_partial_denture","Calculus_(dental)","Lipopolysaccharide","Endotoxin","Lipoteichoic_acid","Periodontitis","X-ray","Periodontal_probing","Periodontist","Oral_hygiene","Tooth_brushing","Flossing","Hydrogen_peroxide","Saline_(medicine)","Ethanol","Chlorhexidine","Mouth_wash","American_Dental_Association","Scaling_and_root_planing","Root_planing","Food_and_Drug_Administration","Triclosan","Calcium","Periodontal_disease","Pennsylvania_Medical_Society","Curettage","Mouth_wash","Chlorhexidine","Hydrogen_peroxide","Periodontitis","Abscess","Trench_mouth","Oral_ulcer","Periodontist","Periodontitis"]}
