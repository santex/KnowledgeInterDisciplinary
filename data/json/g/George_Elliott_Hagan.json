{"cursor":"4005","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'George Elliott Hagan' (May 24, 1916 â December 26, 1990) was an American\npolitician, businessman and farmer and a member of the Democrat.\n\nHagan was born in Sylvania, Georgia and attended the University of Georgia\nUniversity of Georgia in Athens. He served in the Georgia House of\nRepresentatives from 1939 to 1944, resigned from office to join the United\nStates Army as a member of the Signal Corps for two years. Following the war, he\nwas returned to the House in 1946 and served until his election to the Georgia\nSenate in 1950 where he served for one term, leaving office in 1953.\n\nHagan served in numerous other state government positions and also worked in the\ninsurance and financial planning industry and several agricultural pursuits. He\nserved on the board of trustees for Tift College.\n\nIn 1960, Hagan challenged incumbent Congressman Prince H. Preston, Jr., a\nnoted segregationist in the Democratic primary for Georgia's 1st congressional\ndistrict. Preston narrowly prevailed in the actual popular vote (34,318 to\n33,629), but under Georgia's election laws, Hagan defeated Preston on \"county\nunit\" votes by a margin of 26 to 18 and went on to win unopposed in the\ngeneral election (the Georgia Republican Party being very weak at the time and\nfielded very few candidates, having not won a race for any Congressional race\nsince 1872). Preston would die only a month after the conclusion of his term\nin early 1961.\n\nHagan would serve six terms from the 87th United States Congress to the 92nd\nUnited States Congress. He ran unopposed in 1962, and faced minor Independent\nopposition in 1964, winning with 72%. In 1966, he was challenged in the\nDemocratic primary by several opponents and was forced by Savannah State Sen.\nFrank Downing into a runoff. Hagan held off Downing by a margin of 53-47%. In\nthe general election, he faced his first Republican opponent, Porter Carswell\n(1904-?) of Burke County, whom held Hagan to a 58-42% margin. In 1968, he would\nface desultory opposition in the primary and defeated Savannah Republican State\nSenator and former Georgia Republican Party Chairman Joe Tribble (1920-2003) by\na 68-32% margin. He would dispatch another challenger in the 1970 Democratic\nprimary by 2-to-1 and faced no Republican in the general election.\n\nIn 1972, former Hagan staffer and assistant Ronald 'Bo' Ginn would aggressively\nchallenge his former boss in a spirited three-man primary. Holding Hagan to a\n43-39% margin in the first round, Ginn would defeat Hagan by a margin of 55-45%\nin the runoff. Ginn would go on to win the general unopposed. Hagan retired from\nactive politics and returned to Sylvania and remained there until his death on\nDecember 26, 1990.\n","linknr":133,"url":"George_Elliott_Hagan","recorded":1364190427,"links":["/w/index.php?title=George_Elliott_Hagan&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=George_Elliott_Hagan&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:External_links","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources#Inline_citations","/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Fact_and_Reference_Check","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/Politician","/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)","/wiki/Sylvania,_Georgia","/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)","/wiki/University_of_Georgia","/wiki/University_of_Georgia","/wiki/Athens,_Georgia","/wiki/Georgia_House_of_Representatives","/wiki/United_States_Army","/wiki/United_States_Army_Signal_Corps","/wiki/Georgia_Senate","/wiki/Tift_College","/wiki/Prince_H._Preston,_Jr.","/wiki/Segregationist","/wiki/Georgia%27s_1st_congressional_district","/wiki/87th_United_States_Congress","/wiki/92nd_United_States_Congress","/wiki/Frank_Downing","/w/index.php?title=Porter_Carswell&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Joe_Tribble&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Ronald_%27Bo%27_Ginn","/w/index.php?title=George_Elliott_Hagan&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/File:P_vip.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/69/P_vip.svg/28px-P_vip.svg.png","/wiki/Portal:Biography","/wiki/File:United_States_Department_of_the_Army_Seal.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/United_States_Department_of_the_Army_Seal.svg/28px-United_States_Department_of_the_Army_Seal.svg.png","/wiki/Portal:United_States_Army","/w/index.php?title=George_Elliott_Hagan&action=edit&section=2","http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=H000010","/wiki/Biographical_Directory_of_the_United_States_Congress","/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives","/wiki/Prince_Hulon_Preston,_Jr.","/wiki/List_of_United_States_Representatives_from_Georgia","/wiki/Georgia%27s_1st_congressional_district","/wiki/Ronald_%27Bo%27_Ginn","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/96834219","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","/wiki/File:Flag_of_Georgia_(U.S._state).svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/54/Flag_of_Georgia_%28U.S._state%29.svg/30px-Flag_of_Georgia_%28U.S._state%29.svg.png","/wiki/File:Crystal_personal.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/24/Crystal_personal.svg/30px-Crystal_personal.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=George_Elliott_Hagan&action=edit","/wiki/Template:GeorgiaUS-politician-stub","/wiki/Template_talk:GeorgiaUS-politician-stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:GeorgiaUS-politician-stub&action=edit","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=George_Elliott_Hagan&oldid=544619881","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1916_births","/wiki/Category:1990_deaths","/wiki/Category:Members_of_the_Georgia_House_of_Representatives","/wiki/Category:Georgia_(U.S._state)_State_Senators","/wiki/Category:Members_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives_from_Georgia_(U.S._state)","/wiki/Category:United_States_Army_soldiers","/wiki/Category:University_of_Georgia_people","/wiki/Category:Georgia_(U.S._state)_politician_stubs","/wiki/Category:Articles_lacking_in-text_citations_from_March_2013","/wiki/Category:All_articles_lacking_in-text_citations","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=George+Elliott+Hagan&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=George+Elliott+Hagan","/wiki/George_Elliott_Hagan","/wiki/Talk:George_Elliott_Hagan","#","/wiki/George_Elliott_Hagan","/w/index.php?title=George_Elliott_Hagan&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=George_Elliott_Hagan&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=side
