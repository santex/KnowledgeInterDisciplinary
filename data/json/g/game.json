However, the\n distinction is not clear-cut, and many games are also considered to be work\n (such as professional players of spectator sports/games) or art (such as\n jigsaw puzzles or games involving an artistic layout such as Mahjong,\n solitaire, or some video games).\n\nKey components of games are goals, , , and interaction.
