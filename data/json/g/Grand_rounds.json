{"cursor":"5443","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Grand rounds' are an important teaching tool and ritual of medical education\nand inpatient care, consisting of presenting the medical problems and treatment\nof a particular patient to an audience consisting of doctors, residents and\nmedical students. The patient was traditionally present for the round and would\nanswer questions; grand rounds have evolved with most sessions now rarely having\na patient present and being more like lectures. An actor portrays the patient in\nsome instances.\n\nGrand rounds help doctors and other healthcare professionals keep up to date in\nimportant evolving areas which may be outside of their core practice. Most\ndepartments at major teaching hospitals will have their own specialized, often\nweekly, Grand Rounds. Attending Grand Rounds is also an important supplement to\nmedical school and on-the-job resident training. (Grand rounds can also be\ndistinguished from rounds which is the (typically) daily visit by the attending\nphysician and team to all that physician's patients on the ward. Rounding with\nan attending physician is an important part of medical on-the-job training and\neducation, but its primary focus is immediate care for the patients on the ward.\nGrand rounds tends to present the bigger picture, including experience with\npatients over many years, and the newest research and treatments in an area.\nGrand rounds tend to be open to the entire medical professional community,\nwhereas rounds are specific to individual attending physicians and their teams).\n","linknr":119,"url":"Grand_rounds","recorded":1363424458,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Grand_rounds&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Grand_rounds&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/Grand_Rounds_Scenic_Byway","/wiki/Medical_education","#Recent_innovation_:_Video_Grand_Round_Archives","#Links_to_Free_Grand_Rounds_Video_Streaming_Archives_by_Specialty","#HIV.2FAIDS","#Internal_Medicine_.28aka._Medical_Grand_Rounds.29","#Neurology","#Oncology","#Gastroenterology","#Cardiology","#Space_Medicine","#Orthopaedic_Surgery","#General_Surgery","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Grand_rounds&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Streaming_video","/wiki/Hippocratic_Oath","/w/index.php?title=Grand_rounds&action=edit&section=2","http://www.psychiatry.ufl.edu/education/grand-rounds/","/w/index.php?title=Grand_rounds&action=edit&section=3","http://hivinsite.ucsf.edu/insite?page=cme-00-00","http://www.viraled.com/modules/info/hiv_grand_rounds_upenn.html","/w/index.php?title=Grand_rounds&action=edit&section=4","http://www.mayoclinic.org/grand-rounds/","http://medicine.med.nyu.edu/education/medicine-grand-rounds-video-archive","http://medicine.med.unc.edu/whatsnew/grand-rounds-video","/w/index.php?title=Grand_rounds&action=edit&section=5","http://neurosciences.ucsd.edu/2pagevid.php","http://www.ohsu.edu/xd/education/schools/school-of-medicine/departments/clinical-departments/neurology/news/grand-rounds-video.cfm","http://streaming.biocom.arizona.edu/categories/?id=11","/w/index.php?title=Grand_rounds&action=edit&section=6","http://medicine.yale.edu/cancer/research/education/grand-rounds/index.aspx","http://www.mskcc.org/education/cme/videos-healthcare-professionals?tid=1195","http://www.mskcc.org/education/cme/videos-healthcare-professionals?tid=1194","http://www.mskcc.org/education/cme/videos-healthcare-professionals?tid=1189","http://www.mskcc.org/education/cme/videos-healthcare-professionals?tid=1187","http://www.mskcc.org/education/cme/videos-healthcare-professionals?tid=1190","http://www.mskcc.org/education/cme/videos-healthcare-professionals?tid=1188","http://www.mskcc.org/education/cme/videos-healthcare-profes","http://www.mskcc.org/education/cme/videos-healthcare-professionals?tid=1191","http://www.mskcc.org/education/cme/videos-healthcare-professionals?tid=1186","http://www.massgeneral.org/palliativecare/grandrounds/","/w/index.php?title=Grand_rounds&action=edit&section=7","http://daveproject.org/category/clinical-grand-rounds/","/w/index.php?title=Grand_rounds&action=edit&section=8","/w/index.php?title=Grand_rounds&action=edit&section=9","http://www.dsls.usra.edu/education/grandrounds/archive/2011/","/w/index.php?title=Grand_rounds&action=edit&section=10","http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0571A3CE063DEF5C&feature=plcp","/w/index.php?title=Grand_rounds&action=edit&section=11","/w/index.php?title=Grand_rounds&action=edit&section=12","http://www.dhslides.org/mgr/default.asp","http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=40370","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Grand_rounds&oldid=537220174","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Teaching_hospitals","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Grand+rounds&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Grand+rounds","/wiki/Grand_rounds","/wiki/Talk:Grand_rounds","#","/wiki/Grand_rounds","/w/index.php?title=Grand_rounds&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Grand_rounds&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Grand_rounds","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Grand_rounds","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Grand_rounds&oldid=537220174","/w/index.php?title=Grand_rounds&action=inf
