{"cursor":"6066","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In abstract algebra, a 'generating set of a group' is a subset that is not\ncontained in any proper subgroup of the group. Equivalently, a generating set of\na group is a subset such that every element of the group can be expressed as the\ncombination (under the group operation) of finitely many elements of the subset\nand their inverses.\n\nMore generally, if S is a subset of a group G, then , the 'subgroup generated\nbyS', is the smallest subgroup of G containing every element of S, meaning the\nintersection over all subgroups containing the elements of S; equivalently,\n<S> is the subgroup of all elements of G that can be expressed as the\nfinite product of elements in S and their inverses.\n\nIf G = <S>, then we say S 'generates' G; and the elements in S are called\n'generators' or 'group generators'. If S is the empty set, then  is the\ntrivial group {e}, since we consider the empty product to be the identity.\n\nWhen there is only a single element x in S,  is usually written as . In\nthis case,  is the 'cyclic subgroup' of the powers of x, a cyclic group, and\nwe say this group is generated by x. Equivalent to saying an element x generates\na group is saying that  equals the entire group G. For finite groups, it is\nalso equivalent to saying that x has order |G|.\n","linknr":144,"url":"Generating_set_of_a_group","recorded":1362671682,"links":24,"instances":["mathematics","group_theory"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Group theory"],"headings":["Finitely generated group","Free group","Frattini subgroup","Examples","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/math/6/e/d/6ed965ff1e54eac9d40074b4314ee934.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/b/0/3/b036580b74bb50f3296cebea331d6ee9.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["group","mathematics"],["order","group_theory"]],"members":["group","order"],"related":["Abstract_algebra","Subset","Subgroup","Group_(mathematics)","Inverse_element","Subgroup","Trivial_group","Cyclic_group","Finite_group","Order_(group_theory)","Finitely_generated_abelian_group","Integer","Rational_number","Uncountable","Greatest_common_divisor","Bézout's_identity","Quotient_group","Subgroup","Free_group","Natural_number","Isomorphism","Abelian_group","Group_extension","Normal_subgroup","Free_group_","Isomorphic","Quotient_group","Presentation_of_a_group","Frattini_subgroup","Group_of_units","Coprime","Modular_arithmetic","Symmetric_group","Bézout's_identity","Cayley_graph","Generating_set","Presentation_of_a_group"]}
