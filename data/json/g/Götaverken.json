{"cursor":"3000","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'GÃ¶taverken' was a shipbuilding company that was located on Hisingen,\nGothenburg. During the 1930s it was the world's biggest shipyard by launched\ngross tonnes. It was founded in 1841, and went bankrupt in 1989.\n\nThe company was founded in 1841 by Scottish businessman Alexander Keiller under\nthe name 'Keillers Werkstad i GÃ¶teborg', and was aimed at industrial production.\nAfter bankruptcy in 1867, the company was reorganised into 'GÃ¶teborgs Mekaniska\nVerkstads' AB.\n\nIn 1906, the majority of the company's stocks were taken over by Hugo Hammar and\nSven Almqvist. Because of this, the company was reorganised into 'GÃ¶teborgs Nya\nVerkstads' AB and the shipyards capacity was increased. In 1916 the shipyard was\nrenamed to AB GÃ¶taverken. During the 1930s, the company had grown so much that\nGÃ¶taverken became the world's biggest shipyard by launched gross tonnes. In 1950\na completely new shipyard was built at Arendal, which is also located in\nGothenburg. When the shipyard was completed in 1963, it was internationally\nunique because most of the building was done indoors. Their old shipyard\n(Cityvarvet) closed down in 1968.\n\nIn 1971, the company was taken over by SalÃ©nrederierna AB. And in 1977, the\nstate-owned shipbuilding company, Svenska Varv, took over SalÃ©nrederierna\nbecause of the Swedish shipyard crisis. During this last period of the\ncompany's history, they searched for alternatives to the traditional\nproduction of tankers and ore transporters. The company tried to aim its\nproduction towards special vessels, such as icebreakers, ferries and freezer\nships. In 1989, the state-owed icebreaker ''Oden'' was delivered from Arendal\nas GÃ¶taverkens last own-made ship.\n\nHowever, GÃ¶taverken Cityvarvet survived the crisis. Today the shipyard performs\na few types of reparations, maintenance work, and renovation of ships. It\ncurrently employs around 140 employees. Since the year 2000, the shipyard is\nowned by the Dutch group, Damen Shipyards Group.\n\nGÃ¶taverkens head office, located at Lindholmen, was built in 1951. After the\nSwedish shipyard crisis and GÃ¶taverkens restructuring, the building has bein\nunoccupied since 1991. During 2006, the building underwent an extensive\nrenovation for approximately one hundred million Swedish kronor. In the\nbeginning of December 2006, ESAB moved in.\n","linknr":104,"url":"Götaverken","recorded":1375087566,"links":["/w/index.php?title=G%C3%B6taverken&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=G%C3%B6taverken&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Gotaverken-docka.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7b/Gotaverken-docka.jpg/250px-Gotaverken-docka.jpg","/wiki/File:Gotaverken-docka.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/File:Cityvarvet_september_2010.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/76/Cityvarvet_september_2010.jpg/250px-Cityvarvet_september_2010.jpg","/wiki/File:Cityvarvet_september_2010.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Shipbuilding","/wiki/Hisingen","/wiki/Gothenburg","/wiki/Alexander_Keiller_(Gothenburg)","/wiki/Hugo_Hammar","/w/index.php?title=Sven_Almqvist&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Arendal_(Sweden)&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Sal%C3%A9nrederierna_AB&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Svenska_Varv&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Swedish_shipyard_crisis&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Icebreaker","/wiki/Oden_(1988_icebreaker)","/w/index.php?title=Damen_Shipyards_Group&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Swedish_krona","/wiki/ESAB","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Götaverken&oldid=563879389","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:History_of_Gothenburg","/wiki/Category:Defunct_companies_of_Sweden","/wiki/Category:Hisingen","/wiki/Category:1840s_establishments_in_Sweden","/wiki/Category:Companies_established_in_1841","/wiki/Category:Companies_based_in_Gothenburg","/wiki/Category:Shipbuilding_companies_of_Sweden","/wiki/Category:1989_disestablishments","/wiki/Category:Companies_disestablished_in_1989","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=G%C3%B6taverken&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=G%C3%B6taverken","/wiki/G%C3%B6taverken","/wiki/Talk:G%C3%B6taverken","#","/wiki/G%C3%B6taverken","/w/index.php?title=G%C3%B6taverken&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=G%C3%B6taverken&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/G%C3%B6taverken","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/G%C3%B6taverken","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=G%C3%B6taverken&oldid=563879389","/w/index.php?title=G%C3%B6taverken&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1559702","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=G%C3%B6taverken&id=563879389","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=G%C3%B6taverken","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=G%C3%B6taverken&oldid=563879389&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=G%C3%B6taverken&printable=yes","//de.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6taverken_Cityvarvet","//fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6taverken","//no.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6taverken","//fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6taverken","//sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6taverken","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1559702#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6taverken","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikim
