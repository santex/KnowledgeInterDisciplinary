{"cursor":"1130","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nA 'group' in stratigraphy is a lithostratigraphic unit, a part of the geologic\nrecord or rock column that consists of defined rock strata. Groups are generally\ndivided into individual formations. Groups may sometimes be divided into\n\"subgroups\" and are themselves sometimes grouped into \"supergroups\".\n\nSome well known groups of northwestern Europe have in the past also been used as\nunits for chronostratigraphy and geochronology. These are the Rotliegend,\nZechstein (both of Permian age), Buntsandstein, Muschelkalk, Keuper (Triassic in\nage), Lias, Dogger and Malm (Jurassic in age) groups. Because of the confusion\nthis causes, the official geologic timescale of the ICS does not contain any of\nthese names any longer.\n","linknr":109,"url":"Group_(stratigraphy)","recorded":1362477158,"links":18,"instances":["stratigraphy"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Stratigraphy","Geology terminology"],"headings":[],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/WikiProject_Geology.svg/30px-WikiProject_Geology.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["formation","stratigraphy"]],"members":["formation"],"related":["Stratigraphy","Lithostratigraphy","Geologic_record","Stratum","Formation_(stratigraphy)","Chronostratigraphy","Geochronology","Rotliegend","Zechstein","Permian","Buntsandstein","Muschelkalk","Keuper","Triassic","Lias_Group","Middle_Jurassic","Malm","Jurassic","Geologic_timescale","International_Commission_on_Stratigraphy"]}
