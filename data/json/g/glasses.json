They are normally used for vision correction or eye protection. Safety\n   glasses are a kind of eye protection against flying debris or against visible\n   and near visible light or radiation. Sunglasses allow better vision in bright\n   daylight, and may protect against damage from high levels of ultraviolet\n   light. Other types of glasses may be used for viewing visual information\n   (such as stereoscopy) or simply just for aesthetic or fashion purposes.\n\nHistorical types of glasses include the [[pince-nez]], monocle, lorgnette, and\nscissor or scissors-glasses.\n\nModern glasses are typically supported by pads on the bridge of the nose and by\n'temple arms' (sides) placed over the ears. CR-39 lenses are the most common\nplastic lenses due to their low weight, high scratch resistance, low dispersion,\nand low transparency to ultraviolet and infrared radiation. Polycarbonate and\nTrivex lenses are the lightest and most shatter-resistant, making them the best\nfor impact protection.<ref name=\"polycarb\" />\n\nThough modern frames can be both lightweight and flexible, and new lens\nmaterials and optical coatings are resistant to breakage and scratching, glasses\ncan pose problems during rigorous sports. Scraping, fracturing, or breakage of\nthe lenses can require repair by a Licensed Optician professional.\n","title":"glasses","headings":["History","Types of Glasses","Fashion","Redistribution","See also","Notes","References","Bibliography","External links"]},"micro-relation":["5: Presbyopia","4: Horn-rimmed_glasses","3: Sunglasses","3: Stereoscopy","3: Polycarbonate","3: Eyeglass_prescription","2: Eye_protection","2: Ultraviolet_light","2: Monocle","2: Lorgnette","2: Scissors-glasses","2: Human_nose","2: CR-39","2: Hyperopia","2: Myopia","2: United_Kingdom","2: Ophthalmologist","2: Optometrist","2: Bifocals","2: Visible_light","2: Goggles","2: Photochromic_lens","2: Lensless_glasses","2: Bug-eye_glasses","1: Human_eye","1: Corrective_lens_","1: Light","1: Radiation","1: UV_Coating","1: Ear","1: Optical_coating","1: Hugh_of_Saint-Cher","1: Magnification","1: Ancient_Egypt","1: Egyptian_hieroglyphs_","1: Seneca_the_Younger","1: Nero","1: Roman_Empire","1: Gladiator","1: Emerald","1: Ibn_al-Haytham","1: Latin_translations_of_the_12th_century","1: Italy","1: Englishman","1: Robert_Grosseteste","1: Roger_Bacon","1: Smoky_quartz","1: China","1: Inuit","1: Inuit_snow_goggles","1: Jordan_of_Pisa","1: Alessandro_della_Spina","1: Berthold_Laufer","1: German_American","1: Anthropologist","1: British_Journal_of_Ophthalmology","1: Salvino_degli_Armati","1: Marco_Polo","1: Master_of_Heiligenkreuz","1: Getty_Center","1: Tommaso_da_Modena","1: Scriptorium","1: Alps","1: Bad_Wildungen","1: Germany","1: Aging","1: Johannes_Kepler","1: United_States","1: Benjamin_Franklin","1: George_Whatley","1: John_Fenno","1: George_Airy","1: Girolamo_Savonarola","1: Hat","1: Edward_Scarlett","1: Moritz_von_Rohr","1: Carl_Zeiss_AG","1: Contact_lenses","1: Laser","1: Refractive_surgery","1: Memory_metal","1: Titanium","1: Skyline","1: Refraction","1: Refractive_error","1: Myopia_","1: Hypermetropia_","1: Diopter","1: Lensmeter","1: Pinhole_glasses","1: Retina","1: Concave_lens#Types_of_simple_lenses_","1: Convex_lens#Types_of_simple_lenses","1: Cylindrical_lens","1: Light_rays","1: Life_quality","1: Headaches","1: Sports","1: Plastic","1: Index_of_refraction","1: List_of_eye_diseases_and_disorders","1: Hydrophobic","1: Anti-reflective_coating","1: Contact_lens","1: Welding","1: Abbe_number","1: ANSI","1: Ultraviolet","1: Photosensitivity","1: Liquid_crystal_displays","1: Blindness","1: Anaglyph_3D","1: Polarized_3D_system","1: Active_shutter_3D_system","1: Virtual_reality","1: Head-mounted_display","1: 3D_film","1: Optician","1: Macular_degeneration","1: Glaucoma","1: Diabetes","1: Pharmacy","1: Department_store","1: Eyestrain","1: Nausea","1: Dioptre","1: Trifocal_lenses","1: Progressive_lens","1: Albinism","1: Binoculars","1: Theodore_Roosevelt","1: Harold_Lloyd","1: Buddy_Holly","1: John_Lennon","1: Eric_Sykes","1: Hearing_aid","1: Deafness","1: Barry_Goldwater","1: Drew_Carey","1: LASIK","1: Anne_Kirkbride","1: Deirdre_Barlow","1: Masaharu_Morimoto","1: Chef","1: Iron_Chef","1: Japan","1: NBA","1: Post-game_show_","1: Geek_chic","1: Steve_Urkel","1: Superhero","1: Superman","1: Clark_Kent","1: Wonder_Woman","1: Diana_Prince","1: Fashion","1: Browline_glasses","1: Cat_eye_glasses","1: GI_glasses","1: Pince_nez","1: Rimless_glasses","1: Bridge_piercing","1: Lions_Clubs_International","1: Unite_For_Sight","1: New_Eyes_for_the_Needy","1: Adjustable-focus_eyeglasses","1: Contacts","1: Corrective_lens","1: Eye_examination","1: Geek#Geek_chic","1: History_of_optics","1: X-ray_vision"]}
