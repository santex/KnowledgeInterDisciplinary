Glass-ceramic materials share many properties\nwith both glasses and ceramics. Glass-ceramics have an amorphous phase and one\nor more crystalline phases and are produced by a so called \"controlled\ncrystallization\" in contrast to a spontaneous crystallization, which is usually\nnot wanted in glass manufacturing. Glass-ceramics have the fabrication advantage\nof glass as well as special properties of ceramics. Glass-ceramics usually have\nbetween 30% [m/m] to 90% [m/m] crystallinity and yield an array of materials\nwith interesting properties like zero porosity, high strength, toughness,\ntranslucency or opacity, pigmentation, opalescence, low or even negative thermal\nexpansion, high temperature stability, fluorescence, machinability,\nferromagnetism, resorbability or high chemical durability, biocompatibility, bio-\nactivity, ion conductivity, superconductivity, isolation capabilities, low\ndielectric constant and loss, high resistivity and break down voltage. These\nproperties can be tailored by controlling the base glass composition and by\ncontrolled heat treatment/crystallization of base glass.\n\nGlass-ceramics are mostly produced in two steps: First, a glass is formed by a\nglass manufacturing process. The glass is cooled down and is then reheated in a\nsecond step. In this heat treatment the glass partly crystallizes. In most cases\nnucleation agents are added to the base composition of the glass-ceramic. These\nnucleation agents aid and control the crystallization process. Because there is\nusually no pressing and sintering, glass-ceramics have, unlike sintered\nceramics, no pores.\n\nA wide variety of glass-ceramic systems exists, e.g., the Li 2O x\nAl 2O 3 x nSiO 2-System (LAS-System), the MgO x\nAl 2O 3 x nSiO 2-System (MAS-System), the ZnO x\nAl 2O 3 x nSiO 2-System (ZAS-System).\n","linknr":239,"url":"Glass-ceramic","recorded":1362481793,"links":25,"instances":["material"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Glass-ceramics","Ceramic materials","Glass engineering and science","Glass chemistry"],"headings":["LAS System","Cooktops","Source","Literature"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/16/Glass_ceramic_cooktop.jpg/240px-Glass_ceramic_cooktop.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["fatigue","material"]],"members":["fatigue"],"related":["Polycrystal","Glass","Ceramic","Crystallizes","Lithium","Silicon","Aluminum","Oxide","Spodumene","Coefficient_of_thermal_expansion","Fatigue_(material)","Mirror","Telescope","Kitchen_stove","Cookware_and_bakeware","Thermal_conductivity","Infrared","Wavelength","Stove","Radiant","Halogen","Induction_cooker","Metal","Electromagnetic_induction","Germany","Schott_Glass","Corningware","Corningware"]}
