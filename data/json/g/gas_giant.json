      "text" : "\n\n\n\n\nA 'gas giant' (sometimes also known as a 'jovian planet' after the planet\nJupiter, or 'giant planet') is a large planet that is not primarily composed of\nrock or other solid matter. There are four gas giants in the Solar System:\nJupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. However, astronomers sometimes categorize\nUranus and Neptune as \"ice giants\", in order to emphasize the differences in\ncomposition between them and larger gas giants like Jupiter and Saturn.<ref\nname=\"Lunine 1993\">\n\n</ref><ref>See for example: {{cite journal\n| first = Alan P.|last = Boss title = Formation of gas and ice giant planets\n| journal = Earth and Planetary Science Letters year = 2002|volume = 202|issue =\n| 3–4 pages = 513–523|doi = 10.1016/S0012-821X(02)00808-7|bibcode =\n| 2002E&PSL.202..513B}}</ref> Many extrasolar gas giants have been identified\n| orbiting other stars.\n\nPlanets above 10 Earth masses are termed giant planets.<ref></ref> Lower-mass\ngassy planets are sometimes called \"gas\ndwarfs\".<ref>[http://www.eldacur.com/~brons/NerdCorner/StarGen/StarGen.html\nStarGen - Solar System Generator], 2003</ref>\n\nObjects large enough to start deuterium fusion (above 13 Jupiter masses for\nsolar composition) are called brown dwarfs and these occupy the mass range\nbetween that of large gas giants and the lowest-mass stars. The 13 Jupiter mass\n(M<sub>J</sub>) cutoff is a rule of thumb rather than something of precise\nphysical significance. Larger objects will burn most of their deuterium and\nsmaller ones will burn only a little, and the value is somewhere in between. The\namount of deuterium burnt depends not only on mass but also on the composition\nof the planet, especially on the amount of helium and deuterium\npresent.<ref>[http://arxiv.org/abs/1008.5150 The Deuterium-Burning Mass Limit\nfor Brown Dwarfs and Giant Planets], David S. Spiegel, Adam Burrows, John A.\nMilsom</ref> The Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia includes objects up to 25\nJupiter masses, and the Exoplanet Data Explorer up to 24 Jupiter masses.\n",
