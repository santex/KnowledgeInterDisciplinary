'Baseline\n  expression' may also refer to the expected or historical measure of expression\n  for a gene.\n\nC *'Candidate genes' - see '[[#S|signature]]'. Do not confuse with the genetics\ndefinition of Candidate gene. *'Cellular reprogramming' - conversion of a cell\nfrom one tissue-specific cell type to another. This involves a conversion to a\npluripotent state, otherwise known as dedifferentiation. One example is the\nconversion of mouse somatic cells to an embryonic state, which relies on the\ntranscription factors of Oct4, Sox2, Myc, and Klf4. 'Citation:' Nishikawa, S.\n(2007). Reprogramming by the numbers. Nature Biotechnology, 25, 877-878.\n*'Cofactor' - non-protein compound that is bound to an enzyme. Cofactors are\nrequired for the initiation of catalysis. *'Conditional gene expression' -\ncontrolled inducible expression of transgene either in vitro or in vivo.\n*'Constitutive gene' or 'constitutive expression' - a gene that is transcribed\ncontinually compared to a facultative gene which is only transcribed as needed.\n*'Cis-dominant' - mutations (e.g., of an operator) that alter the functioning of\ngenes on that same piece of DNA. It arises because the operator represents a\nsite on the DNA rather than a gene that encodes a product.\n* 'Coregulator' - Transcription coregulators are proteins that work with\n  transcription factors to regulate gene expression.\n\nD\n* 'Distance measures' - used to measure the dissimilarity between the\n  expressions of different genes.\n\n* '[[DNA Microarray]]' - A DNA microarray is a high-throughput technology used\n  to measure expression levels of mRNA transcripts or to detect certain changes\n  in the nucleotide sequence. It is an array of series of thousands of\n  microscopic spots of DNA oligonucleotides, called features, each containing\n  picomoles of a specific DNA sequence. This can be a short section of a gene or\n  other DNA element that are used as probes to hybridize a cDNA, cRNA or genomic\n  DNA sample (called target) under high-stringency conditions. Probe-target\n  hybridization is usually detected and quantified by fluorescence-based\n  detection of fluorophore-labeled targets t.\n\n* 'Down regulation' - decreasing the rate of gene expression.\n\n* 'Down-regulated' - describes a gene which has been observed to have lower\n  '[[#E|expression]]' (lower mRNA levels) in one sample compared to another\n  sample (usually a '[[#C|control]]').\n\nE\n* '[[Emergenesis]]' - quality of genetic traits that result from a specific\n  configuration of interacting genes, rather than simply their combination\n* '[[Epistasis]]' - the collective action of multiple genes that interact during\n  expression. A form of gene action, epistasis can either be additive or\n  multiplicative in its effects on specific phenotypic traits.\n* '[[Gene expression]]' - the transcription of DNA into messenger RNA by RNA\n  polymerase. The messenger RNA is then translated into protein by the ribosome.\n  In gene expression analysis, expression level refers to the amount of mRNA\n  detected in a sample.\n\nF *'[[FGED]]' - Functional GEnomics Data (FGED) Society, an organization that\nworks with others \"to develop standards for biological research data quality,\nannotation and exchange,\" and software tools that facilitate their use. *'Facultative gene' - a gene which is only\ntranscribed as needed compared to a constitutive gene. *A 'feature' - see\n'[[#P|probe]]' or '[[#R|reporter]]'\n\nG\n* 'Gene expression omnibus' or 'GEO' - a National Center for Biotechnology\n  Information database for gene expression *'[[Gene knockout]]' - is a genetic\n  technique in which an organism is engineered to carry genes that have been\n  made inoperative (have been \"knocked out\" of the organism). *'[[Gene\n  knockdown]]' - refers to techniques by which the expression of one or more of\n  an organism's genes is reduced, either through genetic modification (a change\n  in the DNA of one of the organism's chromosomes) or by treatment with a\n  reagent such as a short DNA or RNA oligonucleotide with a sequence\n  complementary to either an mRNA transcript or a gene. *'[[Genetic regulatory\n  network|Genetic regulatory network (GRN)]]' - a graph that represents the\n  regulatory complexity of gene expression. The vertices (nodes) are represented\n  by various regulatory elements and gene products while the edges (links) are\n  represented by their interactions. These network structures also represent\n  functional relationships by approximating the rate at which genes are\n  transcribed.\n\nH *'[[Housekeeping gene]]' - typically a constitutive gene that is transcribed\nat a relatively constant level across many or all known conditions. The\nhousekeeping gene's products are typically needed for maintenance of the cell.\nIt is generally assumed that their expression is unaffected by experimental\nconditions. Examples include actin, GAPDH and ubiquitin.\n\n*'[[Nucleic_acid_thermodynamics#Hybridization|Hybridization]]' - refers to the\nprocess by which the single-stranded DNA or RNA '[[#P|preparation]]' is added to\nthe array surface, in solution, and potentially anneals to the complementary\n'[[#P|probe]]'. Note that with respect to a gene expression assay,\n'hybridization' is a step in the experimental paradigm, while in molecular\nbiology or genetics, hybridization is the chemical process.\n\n*'Heterogeneous expression'\n\nI *'Inducible gene' - a gene whose expression is either responsive to\nenvironmental change or dependent on the position of the cell cycle.\n*'Insulator' - a stretch of DNA that prevents a gene from being influenced by\nthe activation or repression of nearby genes.\n\nJ\n\n\nK Karyoptyping\n\nL *'Library' - a collection of DNA or '[[#O|oligonucleotide]]' '[[#P|probes]]',\noften stored in a microtiter plate, which are transferred to the array during\nfabrication.\n\nM\n* '[[MicroArray and Gene Expression|MAGE]]' - 'MicroArray and Gene Expression',\n  a group that \"aims to provide a standard for the representation of [[DNA\n  microarray]] [[gene expression]] data that would facilitate the exchange of\n  microarray information between different data systems\".\n\n* '[[MIAME]]' - a commercial standard developed by 'FGED' based on 'MAGE' to\n  facilitate storage and sharing of gene expression data It stands for 'Minimum\n  information about a microarray experiment'.\n\n* '[[MINSEQE]]' - commercial standard developed by 'FGED' for storage and\n  sharing of high-throughput sequencing data. It stands for 'Minimal Information\n  about a high-throughput SEQuencing Experiment'.\n\n* '[[MGED]]' - former name of the 'FGED Society'.\n\nN\n* 'NBF or Neutral Buffer [[Formalin]]' - a common solution used in the fixation\n  of cells or cellular tissue for marking and study.\n\nO *'oligo' - short for oligonucleotide, a small chain of nucleic acid residues.\n** When used to detect the presence of larger mRNA molecules, see '[[#P|probe]]'\nor '[[#R|reporter]]'. ** When assembled into a two-dimensional array, see\n'oligonucleotide array' or '[[#M|microarray]]'. *'[[Operon]]' - a genetic unit\nfor coordinating expression of different genes.\n\nP\n* 'Probe' - a term to describe a reagent used to make a single measurement in a\n  gene expression experiment. See reporter, 'probe-set'.\n* 'Probe-set' - a collection of two or more probes that are designed to measure\n  a single molecular species. For example, several oligonucleotides designed to\n  hybrize to various parts of the mRNA generated from a single gene.\n* '[[Promoter (biology)|Promoter]]' - a region of DNA that facilitates the\n  transcription of a particular gene.\n* 'Promotion' - increasing the rate of gene expression. *'Putative genes' - a\n  nucleotide sequence thought to be a gene based on the identification of its\n  open reading frame (ORF). The gene is \"putative\" in the sense that no function\n  has been assigned to its products.\n\nQ\n\n\nR\n* '[[Replication (statistics)|Replication]]' - a technique to estimate technical\n  and biological variation in experiments for statistical analysis of the\n  microarray data. Replicates may be: ** 'technical replicates', such as dye\n  swaps or repeated array '[[H#|hybridizations]]', or ** 'biological\n  replicates', using biological samples from separate experiments that test the\n  effects of the same treatments.\n* 'Reporter' - a MIAMI-compliant term to describe a reagent used to make a\n  single measurement in a gene expression experiment. 'MIAMI' defines it as \"the\n  nucleotide sequence present in a particular location on the array\". A 'Reporter' may be single-stranded DNA that is\n  covalently attached to the array surface. See probe or probe-set.\n* 'Repression' - decreasing the rate of gene expression.\n* '[[Repressor]]' - a DNA-binding protein that regulates the expression of one\n  or more genes by binding to the operator and blocking the attachment of RNA\n  polymerase to the promoter, thus preventing transcription of the genes.\n* '[[RNA splicing]]' - modification of an RNA strand where exons (the coding\n  regions of a transcribed gene) are retained and the introns are removed.\n  Sometimes the exons are recombined either in vivo or experimentally to form\n  alternative splicings, which have various functional effects.\n\nS\n* '[[Signal transduction|Signal transduction pathway]]' - a set of biochemical\n  reactions and biomolecular interactions that convert a stimulus into a\n  metabolic response. A signaling molecule initially binds to a receptor on the\n  surface of the cell, which stimulates the activation of immediate early genes\n  and second messenger molecules. This further activates enzymes that carry out\n  larger-scale processes such as phosphorylation and gene expression. The\n  process just described is known as a signaling cascade, during which the\n  initial stimulus is amplified to have a far-reaching effect on the cellular\n  environment.\n* 'Signature' - refers to the set of expression measurements which satisfy a\n  certain arbitrary threshold criteria, such as 1.5 fold change with a\n  significance
