As\nsuch, they form a paraphyletic group, although the group including both green\nalgae and embryophytes is monophyletic (and often just known as kingdom\nPlantae). The green algae include unicellular and colonial flagellates, most\nwith two flagella per cell, as well as various colonial, coccoid and filamentous\nforms, and macroscopic seaweeds. In the Charales, the closest relatives of\nhigher plants, full differentiation of tissues occurs. There are about 6,000\nspecies of green algae. Thomas, D. 2002. Seaweeds. The\nNatural History Museum, London. ISBN 0-565-09175-1 Many species live most\nof their lives as single cells, while other species form colonies, coenobia,\nlong filaments, or highly differentiated macroscopic seaweeds.\n\nA few other organisms rely on green algae to conduct photosynthesis for them.\nThe chloroplasts in euglenids and chlorarachniophytes were acquired from\ningested green algae, and in the latter retain a vestigial\nnucleus (nucleomorph). Green algae are also found symbiotically in the ciliate\nParamecium, and in Hydra viridis and flatworms. Some species of green algae,\nparticularly of genera [[Trebouxia]] and [[Pseudotrebouxia]] (Trebouxiophyceae),\ncan be found in symbiotic associations with fungi to form lichens. In general\nthe fungal species that partner in lichens cannot live on their own, while the\nalgal species is often found living in nature without the fungus. [[Trentepohlia\n(alga)|Trentepohlia]] is a green filamentous alga that can live freely on humid\nsoil, rocks or tree bark or form the photosymbiont in lichens of the family\nGraphidaceae.\n","linknr":347,"url":"Green_alga","recorded":1362372826,"links":43,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Green algae|","Non-vascular plants"],"headings":["Cellular structure","Origins","Classification","Reproduction","Chemistry","Physiology","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/Stigeoclonium_sp_zugespitzte_seitenzweige.jpeg/220px-Stigeoclonium_sp_zugespitzte_seitenzweige.jpeg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/78/Intertidal_greenalgae.jpg/280px-Intertidal_greenalgae.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/9c/Algaeconjugate.jpg/220px-Algaeconjugate.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Plantae","Chlorophyta","Charophyta","Embryophyta","Algae","Embryophyte","Paraphyletic","Plantae","Flagellate","Flagellum","Seaweed","Charales","Coenobia","Euglenid","Chlorarachniophyte","Fungi","Lichen","Graphidaceae","Chlorophyll","Beta_carotene","Xanthophyll","Thylakoid","Mitochondrion","Flagellum","Microtubule","Cellulose","Mitosis","Centrioles","Endosymbiotic_theory","Cyanobacteria","Red_algae","Sea_lettuce","Nutrient","Land_runoff","Clade","Viridiplantae","Chlorobionta","Glaucophyte","Archaeplastida","Protista","Chlorophyta","Prasinophyceae","Ulvophyceae","Trebouxiophyceae","Chlorophyceae","Streptophyta","Chlorokybales","Klebsormidiales","Zygnematales","Desmidiales","Coleochaetales","Charales","Embryophyte","Charophyta","Paraphyletic","Streptophyta","Flagellate","Streptophyta","Alternation_of_generations","Isogamy","Fertilisation","Prasinophyte","Diploid","Meiosis","Δ13C","Osmoregulation","Turgor_regulation","Salt_tolerance","Cytoplasmic_streaming","Action_potentials","Brown_algae","Red_algae","Seaweed"]}
