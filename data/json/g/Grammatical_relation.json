{"cursor":"11094","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nIn linguistics, 'grammatical relations' (= 'grammatical functions', 'grammatical\nroles', 'syntactic functions') refer to functional relationships between\nconstituents in a clause. The standard examples of grammatical functions from\ntraditional grammar are subject, direct object, and indirect object. Beyond\nthese concepts from traditional grammar, more modern theories of grammar are\nlikely to acknowledge many further types of grammatical relations (e.g.\ncomplement, specifier, predicative, etc.). The role of grammatical relations in\ntheories of grammar is greatest in many dependency grammars, which tend to posit\ndozens of distinct grammatical relations. Every head-dependent dependency bears\na grammatical function.\n","linknr":148,"url":"Grammatical_relation","recorded":1362585031,"links":19,"instances":["linguistics","grammar","grammar","grammar","grammar","linguistics","linguistics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Syntax","Semantics"],"headings":["In traditional grammar","Defining the grammatical relations","Heads and dependents","Notes","References","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/79/CGELFunctions.png/220px-CGELFunctions.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/75/Grammatical_relations.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["subject","grammar"],["object","grammar"],["head","linguistics"],["subject","grammar"],["agent","grammar"],["patient","grammar"],["morphology","linguistics"],["head","linguistics"],["determiner","linguistics"]],"members":["head","object","patient","subject","agent","determiner","morphology"],"related":["Linguistics","Clause","Subject_(grammar)","Object_(grammar)","Indirect_object","Dependency_grammar","Head_(linguistics)","Subject_(grammar)","Direct_object","Indirect_object","Thematic_relations","Agent_(grammar)","Patient_(grammar)","Diathesis_alternation","Ergative_verb","Verb_argument","Finite_verb","Verb_phrase","Phrase_structure_grammar","Transformational_grammar","Government_and_Binding","Minimalist_program","Syntactic_expletive","Inflection","Morphology_(linguistics)","Grammatical_case","Nominative","Accusative","Dative","Genitive","Ergative_case","Absolutive","Dependency_grammar","Head_(linguistics)","Determiner_(linguistics)","Dependency_grammar","Phrase_structure_grammar","Syntax","Thematic_relations"]}
