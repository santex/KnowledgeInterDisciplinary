{"cursor":"20199","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n, [[Cardsharps|The Cardsharps]], c. 1594]] 'Gambling' is the of money\nor something of material value (referred to as \"the stakes\") on an event\nwith an uncertain outcome with the primary intent of winning additional\nmoney and/or material goods. Typically, the outcome of the wager is evident\nwithin a short period.\n\nThe term 'gaming' in this context typically refers to instances in\nwhich the activity has been specifically permitted by law. The two words are not\nmutually exclusive; i.e., a âgamingâ company offers (legal) âgamblingâ\nactivities to the public and may be regulated by one of many gaming\ncontrol boards, for example, the Nevada Gaming Control Board. However, this\ndistinction is not universally observed in the English-speaking world. For\ninstance, in the UK, the regulator of gambling activities is called the\nGambling Commission (not the Gaming Commission). Also, the word\n[[wiktionary:gaming|gaming]] is frequently used to describe activities that do\nnot involve wagering, especially online.\n\nGambling is also a major international commercial activity, with the legal\ngambling market totaling an estimated $335 billion in 2009. In other\nforms, gambling can be conducted with materials which have a value, but are not\nreal money. For example, players of marbles games might wager marbles, and\nlikewise games of [[Pogs]] or can be played with the collectible game pieces\n(respectively, small discs and trading cards) as stakes, resulting in a meta-\ngame regarding the value of a player's collection of pieces.\n","linknr":440,"url":"Gambling","recorded":1362486196,"links":94,"instances":["finance","game","economics","uk","betting_system","casino","game","probability_theory","finance","game","finance","card_game","dice","game"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Gambling|"],"headings":["History","Regulation","Types
