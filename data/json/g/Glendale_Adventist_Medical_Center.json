GAMC is one of the city's\noldest businesses, founded in 1905, a year before Glendale was incorporated as\na city. Back then, they were known as Glendale Sanitarium, and they occupied\nthe former Glendale Hotel, a 75-room Victorian structure on what is now\nBroadway Avenue.\n\nThen it was owned and operated by the Seventh-day Adventist Church. And it was\ntheir Christian mission of community caring that helped form their reputation as\na \"health resort\" of choice. Now, as part of Adventist Health, this same mission\ncontinues.\n\nToday, Glendale Adventist Medical Center emphasizes eight Centers of Excellence:\nAdvanced Surgical Program, Cancer Services, Heart and Vascular Institute,\nNeuroscience Institute, Orthopedic Services, Rehabilitative Services, Spine\nInstitute and Women's Services. As of 2011, GAMC had been voted Glendale's Best\nHospital for several years running. Other designations include: Certified\nAdvanced Primary Stroke Center, One of the Best Places to Work in Los Angeles\nand San Fernando Valleys, Gold Performance Plus Achievement Award from the\nAmerican Stroke Association, and Three-Year Certificate of Approval with\nCommendations from the American College of Surgeons Commission on Cancer. In\naddition to many other awards and accolades, GAMC offers over 80 support groups\nand ongoing health education classes. In addition, the cafeteria food is notewo-\nrthy. [http://www.burbankleader.com/articles/2009/10/24/entertainment/gnp-\nfoodfight102409.1.txt/ Burbank Leader, October 23, 2009]\n\nThe mission statement of Glendale Adventist Medical Center is, \"To share God's\nlove with the community by promoting healing and wellness for the whole\nperson.\" To expand efforts to promote healing and wellness in 2009, GAMC\ndebuted HEALTHline, a weekly television show helping people understand their\nhealth and health options. HEALTHline can also be viewed\nonline. [http://glendaleadventist.com/healthline HEALTHline Glendale,\nCalifornia (CA) - Glendale Adventist Medical Center ]\n\nIn addition to being a non-profit organization, Glendale Adventist Medical\nCenter is heavily involved with the community supporting and participating in\nmany annual events such as Glendale Downtown Dash held on daylight savings every\nMarch, the American Cancer Society's Relay for Life, and the American Heart\nAssociation/American Stroke Association's Saving Strokes.\n\nPrior to 1998, the hospital was victimized by an employee who was a respiratory\ntherapist. Efren Saldivar came to be dubbed the \"Angel of Death\" when he\nconfessed to 50 murders of patients through the injection of paralytic drugs. He\nwas tried and found guilty. Many more patients were believed to have\ndied.
