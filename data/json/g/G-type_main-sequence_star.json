{"cursor":"5413","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n, a typical example of a G V star (yellow-toned B/W photo)]] A 'G-type main-\nsequence star' (G V), often (and imprecisely) called a 'yellow dwarf', or 'G\ndwarf star', is a main-sequence star of spectral type G and luminosity class V.\nSuch a star has about 0.8 to 1.2 solar masses and surface temperature of between\n5,300 and 6,000 K. [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1981A&AS...46..193H Empirical\nbolometric corrections for the main-sequence], G. M. H. J. Habets and J. R. W.\nHeintze, Astronomy and Astrophysics Supplement '46' (November 1981), pp.\n193â237. , Tables VII, VIII. Like other main-sequence stars, a G\nV star is in the process of converting hydrogen to helium in its core by means\nof nuclear fusion.

The Sun is the best\nknown (and most visible) example of a G V star. Each second, it fuses\napproximately 600 million tons of hydrogen to helium, converting about 4 million\ntons of matter to energy.

Besides the Sun, other well-known examples of G-type main-\nsequence stars include Alpha Centauri A, Tau Ceti, and 51 Pegasi.

[http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-id?Ident=51+Pegasi 51\nPegasi], SIMBAD query result. Accessed on line December 4, 2007.\n\nThe term yellow dwarf is a misnomer, as G stars actually range in color from\nwhite, for more luminous types like the Sun, to only slightly yellow for the\nless luminous GV stars. [http://www.vendian.org/mncharity/dir3/starcolor/ What Color Are the\nStars?], Mitchell N. Charity's webpage, accessed November 25, 2007 Our own\nSun is in fact white, but appears yellow through the Earth's atmosphere due to\nRayleigh scattering. In addition, although the term \"dwarf\" is used to contrast\nyellow main-sequence stars from giant stars, yellow dwarfs like the Sun outshine\n90% of the stars in the Galaxy (which are largely orange dwarfs, red dwarfs, and\nwhite dwarfs, the latter being a post-main-sequence star).\n\nA G V star will fuse hydrogen for approximately 10 billion years, until it is\nexhausted at the center of the star. When this happens, the star expands to many\ntimes its previous size and becomes a red giant, such as Aldebaran (Alpha\nTauri).

Eventually the red\ngiant sheds its outer layers of gas, which become a planetary nebula, while the\ncore cools and contracts into a compact, dense white dwarf.\n","linknr":405,"url":"G-type_main-sequence_star","recorded":1362672302,"links":52,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://physics.valpo.edu/courses/a101/notes/070409_LowMass.pdf"],"categories":["Star types","G-type main sequence stars|"],"headings":["Spectral Standard Stars","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/Sun920607.jpg/220px-Sun920607.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5f/He1523a.jpg/15px-He1523a.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Main_sequence","Star","Spectral_classification","Solar_mass","Effective_temperature","Kelvin","Hydrogen","Helium","Nuclear_fusion","Valparaiso_University","Sun","Ton","Hydrogen","Helium","Matter","Energy","Ohio_State_University","ARICNS","Alpha_Centauri_A","Tau_Ceti","51_Pegasi","SIMBAD","SIMBAD","SIMBAD","Earth","Rayleigh_scattering","Giant_stars","Orange_dwarfs","Red_dwarfs","White_dwarfs","Hydrogen","Red_giant","Aldebaran","SIMBAD","Aldebaran","Planetary_nebula","White_dwarf","MK_spectral_classification","Beta_CVn","Sun","Kappa1_Ceti","61_Ursae_Majoris","HD_115043","16_Cygni","70_Virginis","82_Eridani","Solar_twin","Red_dwarf","Brown_dwarf","K_V_star","Star_count"]}
