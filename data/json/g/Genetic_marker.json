{"cursor":"8958","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'genetic marker' is a gene or DNA sequence with a known location on a\nchromosome that can be used to identify individuals or species. It can be\ndescribed as a variation (which may arise due to mutation or alteration in the\ngenomic loci) that can be observed. A genetic marker may be a short DNA\nsequence, such as a sequence surrounding a single base-pair change (single\nnucleotide polymorphism, SNP), or a long one, like minisatellites.\n","linknr":167,"url":"Genetic_marker","recorded":1362508980,"links":27,"instances":["genetic","biology","genetics","genetics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Genetics","DNA","Molecular biology"],"headings":["Background","Types","Uses","Insulin production","See also","Other references","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c5/SFP_discovery_principle.jpg/220px-SFP_discovery_principle.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["microsatellite","genetics"],["microsatellite","genetics"],["lineage","genetic"],["locus","genetics"],["polymorphism","biology"]],"members":["lineage","polymorphism","microsatellite","locus"],"related":["DNA_sequence","Chromosome","Species","Single_nucleotide_polymorphism","Minisatellite","Restriction_fragment_length_polymorphism","Simple_sequence_length_polymorphism","Amplified_fragment_length_polymorphism","RAPD","Variable_number_tandem_repeat","Microsatellite_(genetics)","Microsatellite_(genetics)","Single_nucleotide_polymorphism","Short_tandem_repeat","Single_feature_polymorphism","Diversity_Arrays_Technology","Restriction_site_associated_DNA_markers","Inherited_disease","Genetics","Mutation","Gene","Protein","Genealogical_DNA_test","Genetic_genealogy","Genetic_distance","Mitochondrial_DNA","Y_chromosome","Lineage_(genetic)","Autosome","Locus_(genetics)","Polymorphism_(biology)","Homozygotes","Allozyme","Genome","Phylogenetics","Amplified_fragment_length_polymorphism","CTVT","Canine_transmissible_venereal_tumor","Allograft","Phylogenetics","Jonathan_K._Pritchard","Genetic_engineering","Replica_plating","Diabetes_mellitus","Tetracycline","Ampicillin","Restriction_endonucleases","Agar","Antibody","Molecular_marker"]}
