The organization works to end discrimination\nbased on sexual orientation, HIV status, and gender identity and expression.\n\nJohn Ward founded GLAD in 1978 and filed its first case, Doe v. McNiff that same\nyear. An early victory came in [[Fricke v. Lynch]] (1980), in which GLAD\nrepresented Aaron Fricke, an 18-year-old student at Cumberland High School in\nRhode Island, who won the right to bring a same-sex date to a high school\ndance.

Services it provides include litigation, advocacy, and\neducational work in all areas of LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender)\ncivil rights and the rights of people living with HIV. The organization also\noperates a telephone hotline and website.\n\nIn 2003, GLAD received national attention for its work in winning marriage\nrights for same-sex couples in Massachusetts. In [[Goodridge v. Department of\nPublic Health]], it successfully argued before the Massachusetts Supreme\nJudicial Court that to restrict marriage to heterosexual couples was a violation\nof the state constitution.\n\nOn November 18, 2008, the fifth anniversary of Goodridge, GLAD, working with\nother statewide groups, launched a project called the \"Six by Twelve\" campaign\nthat aimed to bring same-sex marriage to all six New England states by 2012.

Office of Personnel Management]], [[Massachusetts\nv. United States Department of Health and Human Services]], and [[Pedersen v.\nOffice of Personnel Management]].\n\nOn June 30, 2011, EqualityMaine and GLAD announced plans to place a voter\ninitiative in support of same-sex marriage on Maine's November 2012 ballot. The\nvoter initiative passed, making Maine the first state to legalize same sex\nmarriage through a ballot vote.
