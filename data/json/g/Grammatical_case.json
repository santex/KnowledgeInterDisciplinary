{"cursor":"23548","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nIn grammar, the 'case' of a noun or pronoun is an inflectional form that\nindicates its grammatical function in a phrase, clause, or sentence. For\nexample, a pronoun may play the role of subject (\"'I' kicked the ball\"), of\nobject (\"John kicked 'me'\"), or of possessor (\"That ball is 'mine'\"). Languages\nsuch as Ancient Greek, Latin, and Sanskrit had ways of altering or inflecting\nnouns to mark roles which are not specially marked in English, such as the\nablative case (\"John kicked the ball 'away from the house'\") and the\ninstrumental case (\"John kicked the ball 'with his foot'\"). In Ancient Greek\nthose last three words would be rendered tÅi podi (Ïá¿· ÏÎ¿Î´Î¯), with the noun pous\n(ÏÎ¿ÏÏ, foot) changing to podi to reflect the fact that John is using his foot as\nan instrument (any adjective modifying \"foot\" would also change case to match).\nAs a language evolves, cases can merge (for instance in Ancient Greek genitive\nand ablative have merged as genitive), a phenomenon formally called\nsyncretism. Clackson (2007) p.91\n\nUsually a language is said to \"have cases\" only if nouns change their form\n(decline) to reflect their case in this way. Other languages perform the same\nfunction in different ways. English, for example, uses prepositions such as \"of\"\nor \"with\" in front of a noun to indicate functions which in Ancient Greek or\nLatin would be indicated by changing (declining) the ending of the noun itself.\n\nMore formally, case has been defined as \"a system of marking dependent nouns for\nthe type of relationship they bear to their heads.\" Blake, Barry\nJ. Case. Cambridge University Press: 2001. Cases should be distinguished\nfrom thematic roles such as [[agent (grammar)|agent]] and [[patient\n(grammar)|patient]]. They are often closely related, and in languages such as\nLatin several thematic roles have an associated case, but cases are a\nmorphological notion, while thematic roles are a semantic one. Languages having\ncases often exhibit free word order, since thematic roles are not dependent on\nposition in a sentence.\n","linknr":514,"url":"Grammatical_case","recorded":1362665738,"links":80,"instances":["phonetics","grammar","linguistics","grammar","morphology","linguistics","linguistics","linguistics","grammar","linguistics","linguistics","linguistics","linguistics","linguistics"],"pdf":["http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/~haroldfs/public/h_sch_9a.pdf","http://www.remivantrijp.be/pubs/2012/vantrijp2012evolution.pdf"],"categories":["Grammatical cases|"],"headings":["Etymology","Indo-European languages","Hierarchy of cases","Case concord systems","Declension paradigms","Examples","Evolution","Linguistic typology","See also","Notes","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2d/E7127-Balakhna-500-Years.jpg/220px-E7127-Balakhna-500-Years.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["subject","grammar"],["object","grammar"],["possession","linguistics"],["syncretism","linguistics"],["morphology","linguistics"],["complement","linguistics"],["copula","linguistics"],["object","grammar"],["assimilation","linguistics"],["fusion","phonetics"],["agent","linguistics"],["patient","linguistics"],["lemma","morphology"],["agreement","linguistics"],["voice","grammar"]],"members":["fusion","object","possession","subject","lemma","complement","copula","morphology","voice","patient","syncretism","agent","assimilation","agreement"],"related":["Grammar","Noun","Pronoun","Inflection","Grammatical_function","Phrase","Clause","Subject_(grammar)","Object_(grammar)","Possession_(linguistics)","Ancient_Greek","Latin","Sanskrit","Inflection","Ablative_case","Instrumental_case","Syncretism_(linguistics)","Declension","Thematic_role","Morphology_(linguistics)","Semantics","Free_word_order","Proto-Indo-European_root","Old_English_language","Indo-European_languages","Latin","Ancient_Greek","Sanskrit_language","Balto-Slavic_languages","Icelandic_language","German_language","Modern_Greek","Germanic_languages","Proto-Germanic_language","Nominative_case","Accusative_case","Dative_case","Ablative_case","Genitive_case","Vocative_case","Locative_case","Instrumental_case","English_language","Isolating_language","Personal_pronoun","Old_English_declension","Word_order","Preposition","Genitive","Saxon_genitive","English_personal_pronouns","Finite_verb","Complement_(linguistics)","Copula_(linguistics)","Object_(grammar)","Turkic_languages","Mongolian_language","Quechua_language","Dravidian_languages","Papuan_languages","Indo-Aryan_languages","Basque_language","Amazonian_languages","Australian_languages","Hungarian_language","Indo-European_language","Balto-Finnic_languages","Semitic_languages","Latin_declension","Greek_declension","Grammatical_gender","Grammatical_number","Slavic_languages","Noun","Adjective","Nominative_case","Genitive_case","Dative_case","Accusative_case","Ablative_case","Vocative_case","Sanskrit","Pāṇini","Thematic_role","Nominative_case","Accusative_case","Instrumental_case","Dative_case","Ablative_case","Genitive_case","Locative_case","Declension","Tamil_language","Nominative_case","Accusative_case","Instrumental_case","Dative_case","Ablative_case","Genitive_case","Locative_case","Vocative_case","Ancient_Greek","Hindi","Oblique_case","Adposition","Assimilation_(linguistics)","Schwa","Fusion_(phonetics)","Agent_(linguistics)","Patient_(linguistics)","Trigger_case","Verb","Affix","Tagalog_language","Genitive_case","Adposition","Tsez_language","Northeast_Caucasian_languages","Finno-Ugric_languages","Finnish_language","Finnish_noun_cases","Estonian_language","Hungarian_language","Constructed_language","Ithkuil","Ilaksh","Lemma_(morphology)","Markedness","Agreement_(linguistics)","Case_hierarchy","Declension","Differential_object_marking","Inflection","List_of_grammatical_cases","Verbal_case","Thematic_relation","Voice_(grammar)","Phi_features","James_Clackson"]}
