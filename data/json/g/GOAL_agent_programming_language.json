{"cursor":"10714","size":14,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'GOAL' is an agent programming language for programming rational agents. GOAL\nagents derive their choice of action from their beliefs and goals. The language\nprovides the basic building blocks to design and implement rational agents by\nmeans of a set of programming constructs. These programming constructs allow and\nfacilitate the manipulation of an agent's beliefs and goals and to structure its\ndecision-making. The language provides an intuitive programming framework based\non common sense or practical reasoning.\n","linknr":128,"url":"GOAL_agent_programming_language","recorded":1362582519,"links":13,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Agent-based programming languages","Declarative programming languages","Multi-agent systems"],"headings":["Overview","GOAL agent program","Download","Related agent programming languages","See also","References","External links","Notes"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/92/Blokken.png/475px-Blokken.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/7b/Elevatorworld.png/475px-Elevatorworld.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Programming_language","Rational_agent","Decision-making","Common_sense","Practical_reasoning","Michael_Bratman","Knowledge_representation","Prolog","Answer_set_programming","SQL","Datalog","Planning_Domain_Definition_Language","Blocks_world","STRIPS","Precondition","Postcondition","Download","Delft_University_of_Technology","AgentSpeak","JACK_Intelligent_Agents","Declarative","Declarative_programming","Reasoning","Autonomous_agent","Agent_communication_language","Declarative_programming","Cognitive_architecture","Practical_reasoning","Rational_agent","Australian_Artificial_Intelligence_Institute"]}
