It is a foundational element of logic and\nhuman reasoning. Generalizations posit the existence of a domain or set of\nelements, as well as one or more common characteristics shared by those\nelements. As such, they are the essential basis of all valid deductive\ninferences. The process of verification is necessary to determine whether a\ngeneralization holds true for any given situation.\n\nThe concept of generalization has broad application in many related disciplines,\nsometimes having a specialized context or meaning.\n\nOf any two related concepts, such as A and B, A is a \"generalization\" of B, and\nB is a special case of A, if and only if\n* every instance of concept B is also an instance of concept A; and\n* there are instances of concept A which are not instances of concept B.\n\nFor instance, [[animal]] is a generalization of [[bird]] because every bird is\nan animal, and there are animals which are not birds (dogs, for instance). (See\nalso: Specialisation (biology)).\n","title":"Generalization","headings":["Hypernym and hyponym","Examples","See also"]},"micro-relation":["1: American_and_British_English_spelling_differences#-ise.2C_-ize_.28-isation.2C_-ization.29","1: Logic","1: Reasoning","1: Set_theory","1: Deductive","1: Falsifiability","1: Special_case","1: Dog","1: Hypernym","1: Hyponym","1: Generic_antecedents","1: Animal","1: Mammal","1: Bird","1: Fish","1: Amphibian","1: Reptile","1: Cartography","1: Cartographic_generalization","1: Geospatial","1: Polygon","1: Triangle","1: Quadrilateral","1: Hypercube","1: Cube","1: Abstraction","1: Categorical_imperative","1: Class_diagram#Generalization","1: External_validity","1: Faulty_generalization","1: Generic_antecedent","1: Hasty_generalization","1: -onym","1: Ramer–Douglas–Peucker_algorithm","1: Semantic_compression"]}
