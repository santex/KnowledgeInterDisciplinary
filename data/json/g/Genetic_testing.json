{"cursor":"22349","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Genetic testing' (also called DNA-based tests) is among the newest and most\nsophisticated of techniques Human Genome Project Information.\n[http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/medicine/genetest.shtml Gene\nTesting] used to test for genetic disorders which involves direct\nexamination of the DNA molecule itself. Other genetic tests include biochemical\ntests for such gene products as enzymes and other proteins and for microscopic\nexamination of stained or fluorescent chromosomes. Genetic tests are used for\nseveral reasons, including:\n\n*  identifying unaffected individuals who carry one copy of a gene for a disease\n   that requires two copies for the disease to be expressed, for example\n   Huntington's disorder.\n* preimplantation genetic diagnosis (see the side bar, Screening Embryos\n  for Disease)\n* prenatal diagnostic testing\n* newborn screening\n* Genealogical DNA test (for genetic genealogy purposes)\n* presymptomatic testing for predicting adult-onset disorders such as\n  Huntington's disease\n* presymptomatic testing for estimating the risk of developing adult-onset\n  cancers and Alzheimer's disease\n* confirmational diagnosis of a symptomatic individual\n* forensic/identity testing\n\nGenetic testing allows the genetic diagnosis of vulnerabilities to inherited\ndiseases, and can also be used to determine a child's paternity (genetic father)\nor a person's ancestry. Normally, every person carries two copies of every gene\n(with the exception of genes related to sex-linked traits, which are only\ninherited from the mother by males), one inherited from their mother, one\ninherited from their father. The human genome is believed to contain around\n20,000 - 25,000 genes. In addition to studying chromosomes to the level of\nindividual genes, genetic testing in a broader sense includes biochemical tests\nfor the possible presence of genetic diseases, or mutant forms of genes\nassociated with increased risk of developing genetic disorders. Genetic testing\nidentifies changes in chromosomes, genes, or proteins. Most of the\ntime, testing is used to find changes that are associated with inherited\ndisorders. The results of a genetic test can confirm or rule out a suspected\ngenetic condition or help determine a person's chance of developing or passing\non a genetic disorder. Several hundred genetic tests are currently in use, and\nmore are being developed. \n\nSince genetic testing may open up ethical or psychological problems, genetic\ntesting is often accompanied by genetic counseling.\n","linknr":292,"url":"Genetic_testing","recorded":1362503716,"links":25,"instances":["rank","novel","biology"],"pdf":["http://www.actuary.org/pdf/health/geneticmono.pdf","http://www.genome.gov/Pages/PolicyEthics/GeneticDiscrimination/SAPonHR493.pdf","http://www.biomedcentral.com/content/pdf/1741-7007-8-15.pdf","http://www.biomedcentral.com/content/pdf/1741-7007-8-15.pdf"],"categories":["Medical tests","Medical ethics","Medical genetics","Alternatives to animal testing"],"headings":["Types","Medical procedure","Risks and limitations","Direct-to-Consumer genetic testing","Government regulation in the United States","In popular culture","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Ambox_globe_content.svg/48px-Ambox_globe_content.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/62/Mol_Anth_Ico.PNG/20px-Mol_Anth_Ico.PNG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["polymorphism","biology"],["promotion","rank"],["next","novel"]],"members":["promotion","next","polymorphism"],"related":["DNA","DNA_molecule","Enzyme","Protein","Prenatal_diagnosis","Newborn_screening","Genealogical_DNA_test","Genetics","Medical_diagnosis","Diseases","Ancestry","Gene","Human_genome","Chromosomes","Biochemical","Chromosomes","Genetic_disorder","Genetic_counseling","Chromosome","Metabolites","Genotype","Mutation","Phenotype","Karyotype","Person","Newborn_screening","Phenylketonuria","Mental_illness","Congenital","Hypothyroidism","Thyroid","Diagnostic_testing","Carrier_testing","Fetus","Abortion","Birth_defect","Preimplantation_genetic_diagnosis","Human_embryo","In_vitro_fertilization","Predictive_testing","Cancer","Breast_cancer","Hemochromatosis","Forensic_genetics","Parental_testing","Pharmacogenomics","Informed_consent","Blood","Hair","Skin","Amniotic_fluid","Medical_procedure","Mouthwash","Newborn","Blood_lancet","Polymorphism_(biology)","Genetic_discrimination","The_New_York_Times","American_Academy_of_Actuaries","Genetic_Information_Nondiscrimination_Act","United_States","Genetic_Information_Nondiscrimination_Act","Genetic_predisposition","Hiring","Firing","Promotion_(rank)","United_States_Senate","George_W._Bush","Kaiser_Family_Foundation","Science_fiction_film","Next_(novel)","Anime","Gundam_Seed","Personalized_medicine","Eugenics","Full_Genome_Sequencing","Gene_Diagnostics","Gene_theft","Genetic_counseling","List_of_genetic_disorders","List_of_genetic_genealogy_topics","List_of_human_genes","Misattributed_paternity","National_Institutes_of_Health"]}
