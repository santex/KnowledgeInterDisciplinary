{"cursor":"3526","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Gene mapping', also called 'genome mapping', is the creation of a genetic map\nassigning DNA fragments to chromosomes.\n\nWhen a genome is first investigated, this map is nonexistent. The map improves\nwith the scientific progress and is perfect when the genomic DNA sequencing of\nthe species has been completed. During this process, and for the investigation\nof differences in strain, the fragments are identified by small tags. These may\nbe genetic markers (PCR products) or the unique sequence-dependent pattern of\nDNA-cutting enzymes. The ordering is derived from genetic observations\n(recombinant frequency) for these markers or in the second case from a\ncomputational integration of the fingerprinting data. The term \"mapping\" is used\nin two different but related contexts.\n\nTwo different ways of mapping are distinguished. Genetic mapping uses classical\ngenetic techniques (e.g. pedigree analysis or breeding experiments) to determine\nsequence features within a genome. Using modern molecular biology techniques for\nthe same purpose is usually referred to as physical mapping.\n","linknr":140,"url":"Gene_mapping","recorded":1362898137,"links":25,"instances":["genetics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Genetics"],"headings":["Physical Mapping","Disease-association","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/Mergefrom.svg/50px-Mergefrom.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/DNA_stub.png/40px-DNA_stub.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["clone","genetics"]],"members":["clone"],"related":["Genetic_map","DNA","Chromosome","Genome","DNA_sequencing","Genetic_marker","PCR","Recombinant_frequency","Pedigree_analysis","Breeding_experiments","Genome","Restriction_enzyme","Electrophoresis","Genetic_fingerprint","Clone_(genetics)","Contig","DNA","In_situ_hybridization","Disease","Genetic_linkage","Genetic_association","Genome_project","Human_Genome_Project","Quantitative_trait_locus","Genetic_fingerprinting","Genetic_linkage","Sulston_score","Optical_mapping","British_Columbia"]}
