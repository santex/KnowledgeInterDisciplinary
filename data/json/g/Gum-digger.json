The carving is owned and displayed by the Dargaville Museum,\n New Zealand.]] 'Kauri gum' is a fossilized resin detracted from kauri trees\n ([[Agathis australis]]), which is used for chewing or tattooing, and made into\n jewellery. Kauri forests once covered much of the North Island of New Zealand,\n before MÄori and European settlers caused deforestation, causing several areas\n to revert to sand dunes, scrubs, and swamps. The ancient kauri fields continued\n to provide a source for the gum and the remaining forests. Hayward, pp 4-5\n\nKauri gum formed when resin from a kauri trees leaked out through fractures or\ncracks in the bark, hardening with the exposure to air. Lumps commonly fell to\nthe ground and became covered with soil and forest litter, eventually\nfossilising. Other lumps formed as branches forked or trees were damaged, which\nreleased the resin.
