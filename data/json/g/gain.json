      "text" : "\n\nIn electronics, 'gain' is a measure of the ability of a circuit (often an\namplifier) to increase the power or amplitude of a signal from the input to\nthe output, by adding energy to the signal converted from some power supply.\nIt is usually defined as the mean ratio of the signal output of a system to\nthe signal input of the same system. It may also be defined on a logarithmic\nscale, in terms of the decimal logarithm of the same ratio (\"dB gain\"). A gain\ngreater than one (zero dB), that is, amplification, is the defining property\nof an active component or circuit, while a passive circuit will have a gain of\nless than one.\n\nThus, the term gain on its own is ambiguous. For example, \"a gain of five\" may\nimply that either the voltage, current or the power is increased by a factor of\nfive, although most often this will mean a voltage gain of five for audio and\ngeneral purpose amplifiers, especially operational amplifiers, but a power gain\nfor radio frequency amplifiers. Furthermore, the term gain is also applied in\nsystems such as sensors where the input and output have different units; in such\ncases the gain units must be specified, as in \"5 microvolts per photon\" for the\nresponsivity of a photosensor. The \"gain\" of a bipolar transistor normally\nrefers to forward current transfer ratio, either h<sub>FE</sub> (\"Beta\", the\nstatic ratio of I<sub>c</sub> divided by I<sub>b</sub> at some operating point),\nor sometimes h<sub>fe</sub> (the small-signal current gain, the slope of the\ngraph of I<sub>c</sub> against I<sub>b</sub> at a point).\n\nThe term gain has a slightly different meaning in antenna design; antenna gain\nis the ratio of power received by a directional antenna to power received by an\nisotropic antenna.\n",
