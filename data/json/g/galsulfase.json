The purpose of the\nenzyme is to hydrolyze sulfates in the body. ARSB does this by breaking down\nglycosaminoglycans(GAGs), which are large sugar molecules in the body. ARSB\ntargets two GAGs in particular: dermatan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate. U.S. National Library of Medicine. [http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/ARSB\n\"ARSB\"], Genetics Home Resource, November 7, 2010, Retrieved November 22,\n2010\n\nOver 130 mutations to ARSB have been found, each leading to a deficiency in the\nbody. In most cases, the mutation occurs on a single nucleotide in the sequence.\nAn arylsulfatase B deficiency can lead to an accumulation of GAGs in\nlysosomes, which in turn can lead to MaroteauxâLamy syndrome,\nor mucopolysaccharidosis VI.\n","linknr":413,"url":"galsulfase","recorded":1362513102,"links":21,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/images/3ED4_ram_m_500.pdf"],"categories":[],"headings":["Structure","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dc/Arylsulfatase_B.jpg/220px-Arylsulfatase_B.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/07/Arylsulfatase_B_hydropathy_plot.gif/220px-Arylsulfatase_B_hydropathy_plot.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf8/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/Acethylcholinesterase_TC_1EA5.png/40px-Acethylcholinesterase_TC_1EA5.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Enzyme","Mucopolysaccharidosis_VI","Arylsulfatase","Liver","Pancreas","Kidney","Glycosaminoglycan","Dermatan_sulfate","Chondroitin_sulfate","Nucleotide","Maroteaux–Lamy_syndrome","Maroteaux–Lamy_syndrome","Alpha_helix","Beta_sheet","Tetramer","Sulfatase","Aryl"]}
