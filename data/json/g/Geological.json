In modern times, geology is commercially important for mineral and\nhydrocarbon exploration and exploitation and for evaluating water resources. It\nis publicly important for the prediction and understanding of natural hazards,\nthe remediation of environmental problems, and for providing insights into past\nclimate change. Geology plays a role in geotechnical engineering and is a major\nacademic
