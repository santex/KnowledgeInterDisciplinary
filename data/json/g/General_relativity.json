General relativity generalises special relativity and Newton's\n law of universal gravitation, providing a unified description of gravity as a\n geometric property of space and time, or spacetime. In particular, the\n curvature of spacetime is directly related to the energy and momentum of\n whatever matter and radiation are present. The relation is specified by the\n Einstein field equations, a system of partial differential equations.\n\nSome predictions of general relativity differ significantly from those of\nclassical physics, especially concerning the passage of time, the geometry of\nspace, the motion of bodies in free fall, and the propagation of light. Examples\nof such differences include gravitational time dilation, gravitational lensing,\nthe gravitational redshift of light, and the gravitational time delay. The\npredictions of general relativity have been confirmed in all observations and\nexperiments to date. Although general relativity is not the only relativistic\ntheory of gravity, it is the simplest theory that is consistent with\nexperimental data. However, unanswered questions remain, the most fundamental\nbeing how general relativity can be reconciled with the laws of quantum physics\nto produce a complete and self-consistent theory of quantum gravity.\n\nEinstein's theory has important astrophysical implications. For example, it\nimplies the existence of black holesâregions of space in which space and time\nare distorted in such a way that nothing, not even light, can escapeâas an end-\nstate for massive stars. There is ample evidence that the intense radiation\nemitted by certain kinds of astronomical objects is due to black holes; for\nexample, microquasars and active galactic nuclei result from the presence of\nstellar black holes and black holes of a much more massive type, respectively.\nThe bending of light by gravity can lead to the phenomenon of gravitational\nlensing, in which multiple images of the same distant astronomical object are\nvisible in the sky. General relativity also predicts the existence of\ngravitational waves, which have since been observed indirectly; a direct\nmeasurement is the aim of projects such as LIGO and NASA/ESA Laser\nInterferometer Space Antenna and various pulsar timing arrays. In addition,\ngeneral relativity is the basis of current cosmological models of a consistently\nexpanding universe.\n","recorded":1362123961,"portal":[],"list":[],"links":"1647","instances":["physicist","physicist","mathematics","physics","mathematics","general_relativity","mathematics_and_physics","physics","physics","general_relativity","mathematics","relativity","physics","book","physicist","book","general_relativity","mathematics","kinetic_theory","general_relativity","book","intrinsic_definition","mathematics","number","astrophysics","physics","journal","general_relativity","physics","mathematics","physics","astronomy","aps","planet","index_notation","physics"],"pdf":["http://www.ipgp.jussieu.fr/~tarantola/Files/Professional/GPS/Neil_Ashby_Relativity_GPS.pdf","http://www.ipgp.jussieu.fr/~tarantola/Files/Professional/GPS/Neil_Ashby_Relativity_GPS.pdf","http://www.srl.caltech.edu/lisa/documents/KarstenAlbrechtOverviewCQG20-2003.pdf","http://www.srl.caltech.edu/lisa/documents/KarstenAlbrechtOverviewCQG20-2003.pdf","http://www.soso.ch/wissen/hist/SRT/E-1907.pdf","http://www.soso.ch/wissen/hist/SRT/E-1907.pdf","http://einstein.stanford.edu/content/exec_summary/GP-B_ExecSum-scrn.pdf","http://einstein.stanford.edu/content/exec_summary/GP-B_ExecSum-scrn.pdf","http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/15/3/168.pdf","http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/15/3/168.pdf","http://einstein.stanford.edu/content/press_releases/SU/pr-aps-041807.pdf","http://einstein.stanford.edu/content/press_releases/SU/pr-aps-041807.pdf","http://www.europhysicsnews.com/full/42/article4.pdf","http://www.europhysicsnews.com/full/42/article4.pdf","http://www.pitt.edu/~jdnorton/papers/ProfE_re-set.pdf","http://www.pitt.edu/~jdnorton/papers/ProfE_re-set.pdf","http://publicliterature.org/pdf/relat10.pdf","http://people.hofstra.edu/faculty/Stefan_Waner/RealWorld/pdfs/DiffGeom.pdf","http://people.hofstra.edu/faculty/Stefan_Waner/RealWorld/pdfs/DiffGeom.pdf"],"categories":["Concepts
