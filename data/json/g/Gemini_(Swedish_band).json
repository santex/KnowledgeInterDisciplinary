The duo released two original albums: [[Gemini (Gemini\nalbum)|Gemini]] (1985) and [[Geminism]] (1987). Both albums reached the Swedish\nTop 20, while their success was limited to Scandinavia. Their only truly\ninternational release was the single \"Just Like That\" (the chorus of which was\nrecorded and is, as yet, officially unreleased by ABBA).\n\nPrior to their work as Gemini, Karin and Anders formed half of the group\nGlenmarks (with their Uncle Bruno and Aunt Ann-Louise Hanson) and also released\ntwo singles together, with 1985's 'Kall som is' ('Cold As Ice') being placed 4th\nat Melodifestivalen (the Swedish heats for the Eurovision Song Contest 1986.)\nThe winner of Melodifestivalen, Herreys, went on to win the Eurovision Song\nContest with 'Diggi-Loo Diggi-Ley' and recorded a version of 'Kall som is' for\ntheir album.\n\nGemini's eponymous first album received an international release but was not a\nsales success. Much of the material was written by former ABBA members Benny\nAndersson and BjÃ¶rn Ulvaeus, who also coined the group's name. The remainder was\nwritten by Anders and his songwriting partner at that time, Ingela Forsman. The\nlead single, 'Just Like That' reached the charts in central Europe, while the\nalbum track 'Slowly' had previously been recorded by former ABBA member Frida\nLyngstad on her 1984 album 'Shine.' One cover version in Spanish of Gemini's\n'Slowly' (entitled 'Muriendo Lento') was recorded by the Mexican group\n\"Timbiriche\".\n\n1987's 'Geminism' album was a return to straightforward pop music and featured\nthe singles 'T.L.C.', 'Wild About That Girl' and 'Mio My Mio.' Written by Benny\nAndersson and BjÃ¶rn Ulvaeus for inclusion in the film adaptation of Astrid\nLindgren's children's book, 'Mio In The Land Of Faraway', the Swedish-language\nrecording entitled 'Mio min Mio' became the duo's most successful single\nrelease, reaching #3 on the Swedish charts.\n\nAlthough not a Gemini recording per se, the 1994 release of \"Chess In Concert\"\n(a musical by Benny Andersson, Tim Rice and BjÃ¶rn Ulvaeus) showcased their\ncombined voices and distinctive harmonies; Anders playing the role of The\nAmerican and Karin playing Florence.\n\nKarin and Anders returned to the studio together in 2005 to record 'Den som sa\ndet var det' (Those Who Said That Was That) - a new Swedish version of \"Too Much\nLove Is Wasted\" - and added a new backing track to 'When I Close My Eyes'. The\nlatter was originally intended to be released on their first, eponymous album\nbut was deemed too similar to the closing track, 'Another You, Another Me.' All\nof these songs were included on the compilation album 'Det bÃ¤sta med..' ('The\nBest Of..') which reached the Swedish Top 25.\n\nIn 2006 the duo signed a distribution deal with Sony Music Sweden, resulting in\nthe album, 'VÃ¥r jul' ('Our Christmas'). The Gemini name was dropped in favour of\nGlenmark & Glenmark, while all instruments and voices were provided by the duo\nthemselves. The radio single 'NÃ¤r vi nÃ¤rmar oss jul' ('As We Head Towards\nChristmas'), along with TV and radio interviews, successfully promoted their\nChristmas tour.\n\nIn 2006 Anders said of his intention to record new material with Karin, although\nno firm plans have been announced.\n","linknr":109,"url":"Gemini_(Swedish_band)","recorded":1374761082,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Gemini_(Swedish_band)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Gemini_(Swedish_band)&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gemini_(Swedish_band)&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/Sweden","/wiki/Music_genre","/wiki/Pop_music","/wiki/Record_label","/wiki/Polar_Music","/wiki/Warner_Music","/wiki/Karin_Glenmark","/wiki/Anders_Glenmark","/wiki/Gemini_(Gemini_album)","/wiki/Geminism","/wiki/Just_Like_That_(song)","/wiki/ABBA","/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest_1986","/wiki/ABBA","/wiki/Benny_Andersson","/wiki/Bj%C3%B6rn_Ulvaeus","/wiki/Just_Like_That_(song)","/wiki/Frida_Lyngstad","/wiki/Cover_version","/wiki/Geminism","/wiki/Benny_Andersson","/wiki/Bj%C3%B6rn_Ulvaeus","/w/index.php?title=Gemini_(Swedish_band)&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Gemini_(Gemini_album)","/wiki/Geminism","/wiki/Det_b%C3%A4sta_med_Karin_och_Anders_Glenmark","/w/index.php?title=Gemini_(Swedish_band)&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Mio_My_Mio_(song)","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gemini_(Swedish_band)&oldid=541392850","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Swedish_musical_groups","/wiki/Category:Articles_lacking_sources_from_April_2009","/wiki/Category:All_articles_lacking_sources","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_hCards","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Gemini+%28Swedish+band%29&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Gemini+%28Swedish+band%29","/wiki/Gemini_(Swedish_band)","/wiki/Talk:Gemini_(Swedish_band)","#","/wiki/Gemini_(Swedish_band)","/w/index.php?title=Gemini_(Swedish_band)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Gemini_(Swedish_band)&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Gemini_(Swedish_band)","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Gemini_(Swedish_band)","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Gemini_(Swedish_band)&oldid=541392850","/w/index.php?title=Gemini_(Swedish_band)&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q851834","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Gemini_%28Swedish_band%29&id=541392850","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Gemini+%28Swedish+band%29","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Gemini+%28Swedish+band%29&oldid=541392850&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Gemini_(Swedish_band)&printable=yes","//de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_(schwedische_Band)","//hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_(sv%C3%A9d_egy%C3%BCttes)","//ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_(%D0%B3%D1%80%D1%83%D0%BF%D0%BF%D0%B0,_%D0%A8%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%86%D0%B8%D1%8F)","//sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_(Sverige)","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q851834#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_(Swedish_band)","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wi
