This is generally described as one's private\nsense of being a man or a woman, consisting primarily of the acceptance of\nmembership into a category of people: male or female. Neil R., Carlson, and\nDonald Heth C.. \"5.\" Psychology--the science of behaviour, fourth Canadian\nedition [by] Neil R. Carlson, C. Donald Heth. Toronto: Pearson, 2010. 140-141.\nPrint. All societies have a set of gender categories that can serve as the\nbasis of the formation of a social identity in relation to other members of\nsociety. In most societies, there is a basic division between gender attributes\nassigned to males and females. In all societies, however, some individuals do\nnot identify with some (or all) of the aspects of gender that are assigned to\ntheir biological sex.\n\nIn most Western societies, there exists a gender binary, a social dichotomy that\nenforces conformance to (and often refuses to acknowledge anything outside of)\nthe ideals of masculinity and femininity in all aspects of gender and sex -\ngender identity, gender expression and biological sex. Some societies have so-\ncalled third gender categories that can be used as a basis for a gender identity\nby people who are uncomfortable with the gender that is usually associated with\ntheir sex; in other societies, membership of any of the gender categories is\nopen to people regardless of their sex.\n\nWhile many may think gender identity and confusion forms when a child is going\nthrough puberty, gender identity in children begins to form around the age of\nthree. Gender identity is affected by influence of others, social interactions,\nand a childâs own personal interest. Understanding gender can be broken down\ninto four parts: (1) understanding the concept of gender, (2) learning gender\nrole standards and stereotypes, (3) identifying with parents, and (4) forming\ngender preference (Newman 243). A three year old can identify themselves as a\nboy or a girl, though they do not yet know gender is permanent.\n\nGender identity is formed as children search for social cues and display\napproval for others based upon the gender with which the child identifies,\nthough gender identity is very fluid among young children. Studies suggest that\nchildren develop gender identity in three distinct stages: as toddlers and\npreschoolers, they learn about defined characteristics, which are socialized\naspects of gender; the second stage is consolidation, in which identity becomes\nrigid, around the ages of 5â7 years; after this \"peak of rigidity,\" fluidity\nreturns and socially defined gender roles relax somewhat.\n\nAlthough the term \"gender identity\" was originally a medical term used to\nexplain sex reassignment surgery to the public, \"The term 'gender\nidentity' was used in a press release, November 21, 1966, to announce the new\nclinic for transsexuals at The Johns Hopkins Hospital. It was disseminated in\nthe media worldwide, and soon entered the vernacular. ... gender identity is\nyour own sense or conviction of maleness or femaleness.\"  it is most often\nfound in psychology today, often as core gender identity. , Richard G. Kopf, Edward Nersessian, Textbook of\nPsychoanalysis, (American Psychiatric Association, 1996), p. 645. Basic\ngender identity is usually formed by age three and is extremely difficult to\nchange after that. Ann M. Gallagher,\nJames C. Kaufman, Gender differences in mathematics: an integrative\npsychological approach, Cambridge University Press, 2005, ISBN 0-521-82605-5,\nISBN 978-0-521-82605-1 [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/228219/gender-\nidentity \"gender identity.\"] EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica Online. 11 Mar. 2011.\nAlthough the formation of gender identity is not completely understood, many\nfactors have been suggested as influencing its development. Biological factors\nthat may influence gender identity include pre- and post-natal hormone levels\nand genetic makeup. Social factors which may influence gender\nidentity include ideas regarding gender roles conveyed by family, authority\nfigures, mass media, and other influential people in a child's life. Another factor that has a significant role in the process\nof gender identity is language, there are ways that certain words are associated\nwith specific genders, \"The relationship between language and gender has largely\nreflected how linguistic practices, among other kinds of practices, are used in\nthe construction of social identities relating to issues of masculinity and\nfemininity.\" (Adegoju,2000). So children while learning a language learn to\nseparate masculine and feminine characteristics and unconsciously adjust their\nown behavior to these predetermined roles. Williams, Michael, [http://journ-\nals1.scholarsportal.info.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/tmp/4851621215264571264.p-\ndf, \"Cultural Identity, Language Identity, Gender Identity\"], \"The English\nAcademy of South Africa\", 2011 Children are often shaped and molded by the\npeople surrounding them by trying to imitate and follow. One's gender\nidentity is also influenced by the social learning theory, which assumes that\nchildren develop their gender identity through observing and imitating gender-\nlinked behaviors, and then being rewarded or punished for behaving that way. Myers, David G. (2008). Psychology. New York: Worth. In some\ncases, a person's gender identity may be inconsistent with their biological sex\ncharacteristics, resulting in individuals dressing and/or behaving in a way\nwhich is perceived by others as being outside cultural gender norms; these\ngender expressions may be described as gender variant or transgender.\n\nSince the development of gender identity is influenced by so many factors, it is\nunderstandable that there are disorders and conditions associated with it as\nwell. One of the major disorders is gender identity disorder (GID). Gender\nidentity disorder is defined by strong, persistent feelings of identification\nwith the opposite gender and discomfort with one's own assigned sex. \"Gender\nIdentity Disorder | Psychology Today.\" Psychology Today: Health, Help, Happiness\nFind a Therapist. Psychology Today, 24 Oct. 2005. Web. 17 Dec. 2010. .  The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\n(302.85) has five criteria that must be met before a diagnosis of gender\nidentity disorder can be made. \"In gender identity disorder, there is\ndiscordance between the natal sex of one's external genitalia and the brain\ncoding of one's gender as masculine or feminine.\"\nInterestingly, gender identity disorder is also made up of more specific\ndisorders, each of which focuses on the disorder in people of certain age\ngroups. For example, gender identity disorder in children is specific to\nchildren who experience gender dysphoria.\n","linknr":647,"url":"Gender_identity","recorded":1362668550,"links":61,"instances":["social_science","south_asia"],"pdf":["http://bms.brown.edu/faculty/f/afs/dimorphic.pdf","http://bms.brown.edu/faculty/f/afs/dimorphic.pdf","http://www.yogyakartaprinciples.org/yogyakarta-principles-jurisprudential-annotations.pdf","http://www.ypinaction.org/files/02/85/Activists_Guide_English_nov_14_2010.pdf","http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Publications/BornFreeAndEqualLowRes.pdf"],"categories":["Gender","Gender studies","Identity","Self"],"headings":["Gender identity—below the surface","History","Present views","Gender identity and sex","Influencing factors","Non-Western gender identities","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b1/Portal_Transgender.svg/16px-Portal_Transgender.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg/20px-Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["hijra","south_asia"],["identity","social_science"]],"members":["identity","hijra"],"related":["Gender","Man","Woman","Male","Female","Social_identity","Sex","Gender_binary","Masculinity","Femininity","Third_gender","Sex_reassignment_surgery","Psychology","Richard_G._Kopf","American_Psychiatric_Association","Social_learning_theory","Gender_variant","Transgender","Gender_identity_disorder","Assigned_sex","Diagnostic_and_Statistical_Manual_of_Mental_Disorders","Gender_identity_disorder_in_children","Cisgender","Man","Woman","Chromosome","Gene","Sex_organ","X_chromosome","Y_chromosome","Intersex","Gynandromorph","Zebra_finch","Sigmund_Freud","Psychosexual_development","Phallic_stage","Oedipus_complex","Carl_Jung","Electra_complex","Homosexuality","Mental_disorder","UCLA_Medical_Center","Robert_Stoller","Stockholm,_Sweden","John_Money","Johns_Hopkins_University","Interactionist","College_textbook","Judith_Butler","Feminism","Gender_Trouble","Feminist_theory","Gender_studies","Transgender","Diagnostic_and_Statistical_Manual_of_Mental_Disorders","DSM-III","Mental_disorder","Dysphoria","Transsexualism","DSM-III-R","Gender_identity_disorder","Mental_disorder","The_Yogyakarta_Principles","International_human_rights_law","Experience","Self-determination","Dignity","Free_will","The_Yogyakarta_Principles","Gender_expression","Mental_illness","Electroshock_therapy","Yogyakarta_Principles_in_Action","UN_declaration_on_sexual_orientation_and_gender_identity","Health_insurance_exchange","LGBT","Gender_neutrality","Transsexual","Primary_sexual_characteristics","Sex_reassignment_surgery","Secondary_sex_characteristics","Gender_dysphoria","Sex_assignment","Transsexual","Transgender","Intersex","Gender_role","Gender_typing","Gender_identity_disorder","Transgender","Sex_reassignment_surgery","Transsexual","Transgender","Genderqueer","Cloacal_exstrophy","David_Reimer","Polynesians","Fa'afafine","Third_gender","Male","Female","Samoa","Samoa","Gender","Asia","Hijra_(South_Asia)","Male","Intersex","Female","Gender","Prostitute","Transvestism","Drag_queen","Xanith","Oman","Male","Homosexual","Prostitute","Wedding","Society","Masculinity","Marriage","Divorce","Gender_bias","Gender_binary","Gender_differences","Sex/gender_distinction","Queer_theory","Queer_studies","Masculinity","Femininity","Intersexuality","Identity_(social_science)","Uranian","List_of_transgender-related_topics","Office_of_the_United_Nations_High_Commissioner_for_Human_Rights"]}
