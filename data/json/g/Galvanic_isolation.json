{"cursor":"4191","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Galvanic isolation' is a principle of isolating functional sections of\nelectrical systems to prevent current flow; no metallic conduction path is\npermitted. Energy or information can still be exchanged between the sections by\nother means, such as capacitance, induction or electromagnetic waves, or by\noptical, acoustic or mechanical means.\n\nGalvanic isolation is used where two or more electric circuits must communicate,\nbut their grounds may be at different potentials. It is an effective method of\nbreaking ground loops by preventing unwanted current from flowing between two\nunits sharing a ground conductor. Galvanic isolation is also used for safety,\npreventing accidental current from reaching ground through a person's body.\n","linknr":122,"url":"Galvanic_isolation","recorded":1362584971,"links":29,"instances":["electricity","electricity"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Electronic circuits"],"headings":["Methods","Applications"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fb/Flyback_converter.svg/220px-Flyback_converter.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/85/Fototransistor.JPG/220px-Fototransistor.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["ground","electricity"],["ground_loop","electricity"]],"members":["ground","ground_loop"],"related":["Electricity","Capacitance","Electromagnetic_induction","Ground_(electricity)","Electric_potential","Ground_loop_(electricity)","Electrical_conductor","Electric_shock","Transformer","Magnetic_flux","Autotransformer","Kilovolt","Technical_standard","Magnetic_amplifier","Isolation_transformer","Optocoupler","Light_waves","Light_source","Photosensitivity","Capacitor","Alternating_current","Direct_current","Power_grid","Electric_razor","Isolation_transformer"]}
