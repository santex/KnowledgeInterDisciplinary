{"cursor":"6872","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Geroscience' is an interdisciplinary field that aims to understand the\nrelationship between aging and age-related diseases. Because aging is the major\nrisk factor for most non-genetic chronic diseases, an understanding of the role\nof aging in the onset of disease should open up new avenues for disease\nprevention and cures. This term describes the interrelated activities of\nmolecular biologists, neuroscientists, protein chemists, cell biologists,\ngeneticists, endocrinologists, pharmacologists, mathematicians, and others. They\nhave the common goal of explaining and intervening in age-related disease.\n\nAge-related disease is arguably the single greatest challenge for biomedicine in\nthe 21st century. Statistics from numerous sources highlight the fact that age-\nrelated diseases increasingly represent a true worldwide emergency: for example,\nby 2030 the national healthcare bill in the US is projected to reach four\ntrillion dollars, with fully 50% of that being required for Americans 65 years\nand older (based on statistics supplied by the National Institute on Aging and\nthe Alliance for Aging Research).\n\nA traditional approach in research on aging is to investigate single-disease\nconditions in isolation. While this approach will continue to yield important\ninformation, understanding age-related disease poses a unique set of challenges,\nas well as opportunities. To prevent a catastrophic outcome, by the year 2050\nscientists studying diseases like Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, and\nadult cancer need to understand why aging is the largest risk factor for\ndeveloping such conditions. Studying the role of aging mechanisms across a wide\nvariety of disease states is wider in scope than traditional disciplines such as\nneurodegeneration, cancer biology, and geriatric medicine. It is also distinct\nfrom the traditional discipline of gerontology, which has large patient care and\nsocial sciences components.\n\nMany human clinical trials have failed in part due to an incomplete picture of\nthe nature of complex chronic diseases of the elderly. The biology of aging\nfield has developed spectacularly over the last twenty five years, and yet\nlittle headway has been made in preventing the diseases of aging. The\nmanipulation of longevity in simple laboratory animals by genetic modification\nor pharmacological interventions is now commonplace.

However, a central\nconcept of geroscience is that multiple human diseases arise from a common\ncause: aging itself. The term \"geroscience\" was coined by scientists at the Buck\nInstitute for Research on Aging in 2007. The scientific discipline\nwas recognized in the U.S. Senate Appropriations on the FY2010 Senate Labor,\nHealth and Human Services and Education Bill. FY2010 Senate Labor, Health\nand Human Services and Education Bill. Senate Report 111-66, August 4th,\n2009\n\nGeroscience was the organizing principle of the Interdisciplinary Research\nConsortium on Geroscience established at the Buck\nInstitute. This Consortium was funded by the National\nInstitutes of Health Common Fund. The IRC on Geroscience was also discussed in\nthe Senate Report 110-527; quote \"The National Institutes of Healthâs (NIH)\nInterdisciplinary Research Consortium in Geroscience fosters collaboration among\nbiologists, biochemists, geneticists, physicians, physiologists, statisticians,\nand chemists that will help scientists to better understand age-related diseases\nand disorders. Examples include studies of the effects of diet on aging and why\nthe aging brain recovers less easily from traumatic brain injury.\"\n\nIn 2011 the term \"geroscience\" was adopted by a trans-NIH team interested in the\nsame concepts, the Geroscience Interest Group (GSIG). The NIH, with\nsupport from the Alliance for Aging Research and the Gerontological Society of\nAmerica, will host âAdvances in Geroscience: Impacts on Healthspan and Chronic\nDiseaseâ on October 30â31, 2013. This scientific conference, which takes place\non the NIH campus in Bethesda, MD, examines the extent to which the\nphysiological effects of aging represent a common major risk factor for chronic\ndiseases.\n","linknr":108,"url":"Geroscience","recorded":1374761413,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Geroscience&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Geroscience&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/National_Institute_on_Aging","/wiki/Alliance_for_Aging_Research","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Alzheimer%27s_Disease","/wiki/Parkinson%27s_Disease","/wiki/Cancer","/wiki/Gerontology","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Buck_Institute_for_Research_on_Aging","#cite_note-3","#cite_note-4","#cite_note-5","#cite_note-6","#cite_note-7","/wiki/National_Institutes_of_Health","#cite_note-8","#cite_note-9","#cite_note-10","/w/index.php?title=Geroscience&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","http://www.silverbook.org/uploads/images/Silverbook.pdf","#cite_ref-2","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0879698241","#cite_ref-3","/wiki/Digital_object_identifier","http://dx.doi.org/10.1038%2F450603a","/wiki/PubMed_Identifier","//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18046373","#cite_ref-4","#cite_ref-5","http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CRPT-111srpt66/pdf/CRPT-111srpt66.pdf","#cite_ref-6","http://commonfund.nih.gov/Interdisciplinary/consortia/gero.aspx","#cite_ref-7","http://www.geroscienceonline.org/","#cite_ref-8","http://www.aging.senate.gov/award/report.pdf","#cite_ref-9","http://sigs.nih.gov/geroscience/Pages/default.aspx","#cite_ref-10","http://www.nia.nih.gov/research/announcements/2013/06/nih-host-october-2013-geroscience-summit","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Geroscience&oldid=563712488","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Ageing","/wiki/Category:Theories_of_aging","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Geroscience&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Geroscience","/wiki/Geroscience","/w/index.php?title=Talk:Geroscience&action=edit&redlink=1","#","/wiki/Geroscience","/w/index.php?title=Geroscience&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Geroscience&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Geroscience","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Geroscience","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Geroscience&oldid=563712488","/w/index.php?title=Geroscience&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Geroscience&id=563712488","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Geroscience","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Geroscience&oldid=563712488&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Geroscience&printable=yes","#","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geroscience","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.silverbook.org/uploads/images/Silverbook.pdf","http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CRPT-111srpt66/pdf/CRPT-111srpt66.pdf","http://www.aging.senate.gov/award/report.pdf"],"categories":["Ageing","Theories
