{"cursor":"12081","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Glass-like carbon', often called 'glassy carbon' or 'vitreous carbon', is a\nnon-graphitizing carbon which combines glassy and ceramic properties with those\nof graphite. The most important properties are high temperature resistance,\nhardness (7 Mohs), low density, low electrical resistance, low friction, low\nthermal resistance, extreme resistance to chemical attack and impermeability to\ngases and liquids. Glassy carbon is widely used as an electrode material in\nelectrochemistry, as well as for high temperature crucibles and as a component\nof some prosthetic devices, and can be fabricated as different shapes, sizes\nand sections.\n\nThe names glassy carbon and vitreous carbon have been introduced as trademarks;\ntherefore, IUPAC does not recommend their use as technical terms.\n","linknr":230,"url":"Glassy_carbon","recorded":1362375372,"links":19,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.personal.rdg.ac.uk/~scsharip/PM_glassy.pdf"],"categories":["Carbon forms","Amorphous solids"],"headings":["History","Structure","Electrochemical properties","Advantages","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/15/GlassyCarbon.PNG/250px-GlassyCarbon.PNG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/35/Vitreos_carbon_crucible_2.PNG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/6/b/56b9345b551736a9e4d31b4cc461b386.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/3/6/f/36f8ae4c86b69d52d037a6802d91cc4a.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/b/e/ebe1915c432cf9c372b4ecfe36ff1fa2.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Carbon","Ceramic","Graphite","Mohs_scale_of_mineral_hardness","Electrochemistry","Crucible","IUPAC","Sellotape","Plessey","Amorphous_carbon","Fullerenes","Amorphous_carbon","Conchoidal_fracture","Standard_hydrogen_electrode","Graphite","Electrochemistry","Fullerenes"]}
