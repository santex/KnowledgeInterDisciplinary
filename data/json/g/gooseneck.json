The boom moves from side to side and up and down by\nswiveling on the gooseneck.\n\nThe gooseneck may be a two axis swivel as pictured. Having an integrated shackle\nfor the tack is common. Goosenecks on older rigs may be formed by a loop\nattached to the end of the boom that fits loosely about the mast.\n",
