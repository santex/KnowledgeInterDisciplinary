{"cursor":"4258","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Gas exchange' is a process in biology where gases contained in an organism and\natmosphere transfer or exchange. In human gas-exchange, gases contained in the\nblood of human bodies exchange with gases contained in the atmosphere. Human gas-\nexchange occurs in the lungs. In unicellular organisms the respiratory surface\nand gas-exchange is governed by Fick's law. In humans and mammals, respiratory\ngas exchange is carried out by mechanisms of the heart and lungs. Ventilation is\nthe process of air movement into and out of the lungs. Once air enters the\nlungs, diffusion of O 2 and CO 2 occurs in the alveoli. The\noxygenated blood is then perfused throughout the body where gas exchange occurs\nin the capillary beds.\n","linknr":134,"url":"Gas_exchange","recorded":1362584064,"links":31,"instances":["physiology","anatomy"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Biological processes"],"headings":["Pulmonary physics","Interchange","Diffusion","Control of respiration","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["ventilation","physiology"],["diaphragm","anatomy"]],"members":["ventilation","diaphragm"],"related":["Human_lung","Unicellular_organism","Fick's_law","Ventilation_(physiology)","Diffusion","Alveoli","Perfusion","Capillary","Atmospheric_pressure","Sea_level","MmHg","Kilopascal","Nares","Oxygen","2,3-Bisphosphoglyceric_acid","Capnograph","Ammonia","Acetone","Isoprene","Selected_ion_flow_tube_mass_spectrometry","Hydrogen","Ion","Bicarbonate","Hemoglobin","Carbonic_anhydrase","Involuntary_control_of_respiration","Phrenic_nerve","Diaphragm_(anatomy)","Inhalation","Exhalation"]}
