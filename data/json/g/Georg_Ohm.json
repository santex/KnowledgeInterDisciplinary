As a high school teacher, Ohm began his research with the new\nelectrochemical cell, invented by Italian scientist Alessandro Volta. Using\nequipment of his own creation, Ohm found that there is a direct proportionality\nbetween the potential difference (voltage) applied across a conductor and the\nresultant electric current. This relationship is known as Ohm's law.\n","linknr":403,"url":"Georg_Ohm","recorded":1362485606,"links":91,"instances":["mathematics","unit"],"pdf":["http://www.mb.fh-nuernberg.de/bib/textarchiv/Ohm.Grundlinien.pdf","http://www.mb.fh-nuernberg.de/bib/textarchiv/Ohm.Die_galvanische_Kette.pdf","http://www.mb.fh-nuernberg.de/bib/textarchiv/Ohm.Molecular-Physik_1.pdf","http://www.mb.fh-nuernberg.de/bib/textarchiv/Ohm.Grundzuege_der_Physik.pdf"],"categories":["1789 births","1854 deaths","People from Erlangen","German physicists","Recipients of the Copley Medal","People associated with electricity","University of Erlangen-Nuremberg alumni"],"headings":["Biography","The discovery of Ohm's law","Ohm's acoustic law","Study and publications","See also","Notes","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2a/Georg_Simon_Ohm3.jpg/200px-Georg_Simon_Ohm3.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/16/Denkmal_Ohm_TU_M%C3%BCnchen.jpg/220px-Denkmal_Ohm_TU_M%C3%BCnchen.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Wikiquote-logo-en.svg/40px-Wikiquote-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/12px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/62/PD-icon.svg/12px-PD-icon.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["proportionality","mathematics"],["ohm","unit"],["ohm","unit"]],"members":["proportionality","ohm"],"related":["Erlangen","Brandenburg-Bayreuth","Munich","Kingdom_of_Bavaria","Brandenburg-Bayreuth","Bavaria","Germany","Physics","Electricity","University_of_Munich","University_of_Erlangen","Karl_Christian_von_Langsdorf","Ohm's_law","Ohm's_Phase_Law","Ohm's_acoustic_law","Copley_Medal","Germany","Physicist","Mathematician","Electrochemical_cell","Alessandro_Volta","Voltage","Electric_current","Ohm's_law","Protestant","Erlangen","Brandenburg-Bayreuth","Holy_Roman_Empire","Martin_Ohm","Mathematics","Physics","Chemistry","Philosophy","Daniel_Bernoulli","Karl_Christian_von_Langsdorf","Friedrich-Alexander-University,_Erlangen-Nuremberg","Gottstadt_bei_Nydau","Karl_Christian_von_Langsdorf","Ruprecht_Karl_University_of_Heidelberg","Heidelberg","Leonhard_Euler","Pierre-Simon_Laplace","Sylvestre_François_Lacroix","Neuchâtel","Doctorate","Bavaria","Bamberg","Geometry","Frederick_William_III_of_Prussia","Dreikönigsgymnasium","Cologne","Physics","Nuremberg","University_of_Munich","Alter_Südfriedhof","Henry_Cavendish","Electromotive_force","Electrical_circuit","Electric_current","Electrical_resistance","Joseph_Fourier","Claude-Louis_Navier","Conceptual_framework","Circuit_theory","Vitold_Belevitch","Berlin","Electric_current","Electrical_engineering","Proportionality_(mathematics)","Voltage","Resistor","SI","Electrical_resistance","Ohm_(unit)","Royal_Society","Copley_Medal","Bavarian_Academy_of_Sciences_and_Humanities","Martin_Ohm","Ohm_(unit)","Physics","Erlangen","Bavaria","Germany","Munich","Germany"]}
