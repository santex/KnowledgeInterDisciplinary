In American\nEnglish, government refers to the larger system by which any state is\norganized.<ref></ref> Furthermore, government is occasionally used in English as\na synonym for [[governance]].\n\nIn the case of its broad associative definition, government normally consists of\nlegislators, administrators, and arbitrators. Government is the means by which\nstate policy is enforced, as well as the mechanism for determining the policy of\nthe state. A form of government, or form of state governance, refers to the set\nof political systems and institutions that make up the organisation of a\nspecific government.\n\nGovernment of any kind currently affects every human activity in many important\nways. For this reason, political scientists generally argue that government\nshould not be studied by itself; but should be studied along with anthropology,\neconomics, history, philosophy, science, and sociology.\n","title":"Government","headings":["Political science","Forms of government by associated attributes","Forms of government by other characteristic
