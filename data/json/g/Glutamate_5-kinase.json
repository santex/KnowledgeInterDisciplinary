The systematic name of this enzyme class is 'ATP:L-glutamate\n5-phosphotransferase'. Other names in common use include 'ATP-L-glutamate 5-\nphosphotransferase', 'ATP:gamma-L-glutamate phosphotransferase', 'gamma-\nglutamate kinase', 'gamma-glutamyl kinase', and 'glutamate kinase'. This enzyme\nparticipates in urea cycle and metabolism of amino groups.\n","linknr":130,"url":"Glutamate_5-kinase","recorded":1362481905,"links":13,"instances":["biochemistry","chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["EC 2.7.2","Enzymes of known structure"],"headings":["Structural studies","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/b/e/ebe1915c432cf9c372b4ecfe36ff1fa2.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d9/PBB_GE_PNPLA6_203718_at_tn.png/60px-PBB_GE_PNPLA6_203718_at_tn.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["substrate","biochemistry"],["product","chemistry"]],"members":["substrate","product"],"related":["Enzymology","Enzyme","Catalysis","Chemical_reaction","Substrate_(biochemistry)","Adenosine_triphosphate","L-glutamate","Product_(chemistry)","Adenosine_diphosphate","L-glutamate_5-phosphate","Transferase","Phosphotransferase","Urea_cycle_and_metabolism_of_amino_groups","Tertiary_structure","Protein_Data_Bank"]}
