GDP per capita is often considered an indicator of a country's standard\nof living; [http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2009/sep/14/sarkozy-\nattacks-gdp-focus French President seeks alternatives to GDP], The Guardian 14-09-\n2009. GDP per capita is not a measure of personal income (See [[Gross\ndomestic product#Standard of living and GDP|Standard of living and GDP]]). Under\neconomic theory, GDP per capita exactly equals the gross domestic income (GDI)\nper capita (See [[Gross domestic income]]).\n\nGDP is related to national accounts, a subject in macroeconomics. GDP is not to\nbe confused with gross national product (GNP) which allocates production based\non ownership.\n","recorded":1362124574,"portal":[],"list":[],"links":"572","instances":["economics","ppp_per_capita","ppp_per_capita_estimates","economics","ppp","nominal","ppp_per_capita","ppp","humanity","disambiguation","ppp","finance","ppp","nominal","economics","statistics","per_hour","economics","economics","nominal","nominal","level_1","ppp_per_capita","economics","ppp","ppp","nominal_per_capita","ppp","ppp_per_person_employed","ppp_per_capita","ppp_per_capita","ppp","accounting","decision_making","ppp","unsna","ppp"],"pdf":["http://www.bea.gov/national/pdf/NIPAhandbookch1-4.pdf","http://www.beyond-gdp.eu/download/bgdp-bp-goossens.pdf","http://fraser.stlouisfed.org/docs/publications/nipab/19340104_nationalinc.pdf","http://www.bea.gov/national/pdf/nipa_primer.pdf","http://www.bea.gov/national/pdf/nipa_primer.pdf","http://www.bea.gov/national/pdf/nipaguid.pdf","http://www.h-economica.uab.es/wps/2012_01.pdf","http://www.tobiaspreis.de/bigdata/future_orientation_index.pdf","http://www.tobiaspreis.de/bigdata/future_orientation_index.pdf"],"categories":["Gross
