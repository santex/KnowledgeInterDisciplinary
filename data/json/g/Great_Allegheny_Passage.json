It is the central trail of a network\nof long-distance hiker-biker trails covering hundreds of miles through the\nAllegheny region of the Appalachian Mountains, connecting Washington, D.C. to\nPittsburgh, Pennsylvania and beyond.\n\nThe multi-use trail, suitable for biking and walking, occupies abandoned\ncorridors of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad,\nUnion Railroad and the Western Maryland Railroad. When completed, the Great\nAllegheny Passage will extend from Cumberland, Maryland to Point State Park in\ndowntown Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, with a branch (Montour Trail) to the\nPittsburgh International Airport.\n\nThis GAP also connects with the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal towpath trail, which\nruns for an additional between Cumberland, Maryland and Washington, DC -\ncreating a continuous non-motorized corridor, long, from McKeesport, near\nPittsburgh (ultimately to begin from Pittsburgh's Point State Park ) to\nWashington, DC. The Great Allegheny Passage is a segment of the Potomac Heritage\nNational Scenic Trail, one of eight nationally-designated scenic\ntrails. {{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/pohe |title=Potomac
