He attended several\nuniversities, \"but biographers make no mention of him graduating,\" according to\nan online biographical sketch of Wyllys at the Connecticut State Library and\nMuseum Web site. [http://www.cslib.org/gov/wyllysg.htm \"George\nWyllys: Governor of the Colony of Connecticut 1642\" at website of the\nConnecticut State Library, a biographical sketch prepared by the library's\nHistory and Genealogy Unit, April 1999]\n\nHe may well have become a Puritan in his university years.\n\nHe married Bridget Yonge/Young on 2 November 1609 at the Holy Trinity Church in\nStratford-on-Avon. They had three children before she died in 1629. In 1631 he\nmarried again, this time to Mrs. Mary Brisbey. They had one son.\n\nThe family emigrated to New England in the early 1630s. By 1634, Wyllys had been\nappointed an Assistant to the General Court of the Massachusetts Bay Colony.\n\nIn 1636, Wyllys sent his steward, William Gibbons, to Hartford along with 20\ndomestics and indentured servants in order to buy land and oversee construction\nof a house. That house was the largest home of any of Hartford's early settlers\nand one of the largest in Connecticut. The famous Charter Oak stood on the\nproperty.\n\nThe same street contained the homes of future Governors Wyllys, Webster, Welles,\nand Hopkins and was called Governor Street until, much later, its name was\nchanged to Popieluszko Court.\n\nIt was not until 1638 that the Wyllys family arrived in Hartford. He was soon\nelected as one of six Assistants to the General Court in 1639-41. He became\ndeputy governor of the colony in 1641 and in 1642 he served a year as governor.\nIn 1643 and 1644 he again served as an Assistant to the General Court.\n\nRumors that the Narragansetts would form an alliance with several other tribes\nto destroy the English settlers prompted Wyllys and the General Court to send\ntwo delegates to a meeting in Boston which later resulted in the Articles of\nConfederation between the colonies of Massachusetts Bay, New Haven, and\nConnecticut, a compact to provide cooperation in defense of the colonies.\n\nIn December of 1642, the General Court passed the colony's first penal code,\nwhich named 12 capital crimes.\n\nAfter his term as governor expired, Wyllys was chosen to be a Commissioner from\nConnecticut to The United Colonies of New England in 1643.\n\nOn his death in Hartford on March 9, 1644/5, his estate, which included slaves,\nwas the largest in the colony until 1680. No portrait of him is known to\nexist.\n\nWyllys' home in Hartford was torn down in 1827. He is buried in the Hartford's\nAncient Burying Ground, and his name appears on the Founders Monument. Wyllys\nStreet in Hartford is named after him. One of his direct\ndescendants was Frank Lloyd Wright.\n","linknr":142,"url":"George_Wyllys","recorded":1375075684,"links":["/w/index.php?title=George_Wyllys&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=George_Wyllys&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Governor_of_the_Colony_of_Connecticut","/wiki/John_Haynes","/wiki/Fenny_Compton","/wiki/Warwickshire","/wiki/England","/wiki/Hartford,_Connecticut","/wiki/United_Kingdom","/wiki/Puritan","/wiki/Connecticut_Colony","/wiki/Fenny_Compton","/wiki/Warwickshire","/wiki/England","#cite_note-library-1","#cite_note-library-1","/wiki/Church_of_the_Holy_Trinity,_Stratford-upon-Avon","/wiki/Stratford-on-Avon","#cite_note-library-1","/wiki/Massachusetts_Bay_Colony","#cite_note-library-1","/wiki/Indentured_servant","/wiki/Charter_Oak","#cite_note-library-1","/wiki/John_Webster_(governor)","/wiki/Thomas_Welles","/wiki/Edward_Hopkins","#cite_note-library-1","#cite_note-library-1","/wiki/Narragansett_(tribe)","/wiki/New_Haven_Colony","#cite_note-library-1","/wiki/Capital_crime","#cite_note-library-1","/wiki/New_England_Confederation","#cite_note-library-1","#cite_note-library-1","/wiki/First_Church_of_Christ_and_the_Ancient_Burying_Ground","#cite_note-library-1","/wiki/Frank_Lloyd_Wright","/w/index.php?title=George_Wyllys&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/File:P_vip.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/69/P_vip.svg/28px-P_vip.svg.png","/wiki/Portal:Biography","/wiki/Wyllys-Haynes_Family","/w/index.php?title=George_Wyllys&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-library_1-0","#cite_ref-library_1-1","#cite_ref-library_1-2","#cite_ref-library_1-3","#cite_ref-library_1-4","#cite_ref-library_1-5","#cite_ref-library_1-6","#cite_ref-library_1-7","#cite_ref-library_1-8","#cite_ref-library_1-9","#cite_ref-library_1-10","#cite_ref-library_1-11","http://www.cslib.org/gov/wyllysg.htm","/w/index.php?title=George_Wyllys&action=edit&section=3","http://www.cslib.org/gov/wyllysg.htm","/wiki/John_Haynes","/wiki/List_of_colonial_governors_of_Connecticut","/wiki/John_Haynes","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","/wiki/Fenny_Compton","/wiki/Warwickshire","/wiki/England","/wiki/Hartford,_Connecticut","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=George_Wyllys&oldid=544511937","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1590_births","/wiki/Category:1645_deaths","/wiki/Category:Connecticut_colonial_people","/wiki/Category:Founders_of_Hartford,_Connecticut","/wiki/Category:Colonial_governors_of_Connecticut","/wiki/Category:Lieutenant_Governors_of_Connecticut","/wiki/Category:People_from_Stratford-on-Avon_(district)","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=George+Wyllys&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=George+Wyllys","/wiki/George_Wyllys","/wiki/Talk:George_Wyllys","#","/wiki/George_Wyllys","/w/index.php?title=George_Wyllys&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=George_Wyllys&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/George_Wyllys","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/George_Wyllys","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=George_Wyllys&oldid=544511937","/w/index.php?title=George_Wyllys&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1508656","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=George_Wyllys&id=544511937","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=George+Wyllys","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=George+Wyllys&oldid=544511937&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=George_Wyllys&printable=yes","//de.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Wyllys","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1508656#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAli
