During this period,\nA&P created the concept of the chain grocery store and expanded into the\ncountry's largest retailer. He joined the firm as a clerk in 1861 and quickly\nassumed managerial responsibilities. When A&P's founder, George Gilman retired\nin 1878, Hartford entered into a partnership agreement and ran the company until\nthe founder's death in 1901. In the settlement of Gilman's estate, Hartford\nacquired control of the company and ultimately purchased the interests of\nGilman's heirs.\n\nGeorge Hartford was born on a farm in Augusta, Maine and started his retail\ncareer at age 18 in Boston. By 1861, he lived in Brooklyn, New York where he\nmarried Marie Josephine Ludlum (1837 - 1925). They had three sons and two\ndaughters. While he was known to be a private person, Hartford was elected Mayor\nof Orange, New Jersey in 1878 and served for 12 years. Hartford retired from the\nactive management of the business about 1907 or 1908 and turned the firm over to\ntwo of his sons, George Ludlum Hartford (1864 - 1957) and John Augustine\nHartford (1872 - 1951). He continued as an advisor while they expanded the firm,\nbecoming the country's largest retailer by 1915. Hartford died in 1917, aged 84,\nand was interred at Rosedale Cemetery, in Orange, New Jersey. Hartfordâs estate\nwas worth $125 million dollars. The press respected that he was a private\nman, and there were few obituaries about him. \"To\nimmortalize outstanding American merchants\", Joseph Kennedy in 1953 commissioned\na bronze bust of George Huntington Hartford, four times life size along with 7\nother men, which would come to be known as the Merchandise Mart Hall of Fame in\nChicago.\n\nBy 1930, A&P operated approximately 16,000 stores and became the first retailer\nto report combined revenue of US$1 billion. [http://www.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19501113,00.html John\nHartford Time Magazine Cover] The Time magazine published on November 13,\n1950 had both George and John Hartford on its front cover. Time wrote\nthat \"the familiar red-front A & P store is the real melting pot of the\ncommunity, patronized by the boss's wife and the baker's daughter, the priest\nand the policeman. To foreigners A & P's vast supermarkets are among the wonders\nof the age; to the US middle class, they are one of the direct roads to\nsolvency. 'Going to the A & P' is almost an American tribal rite.\" \nTime Magazine also wrote in 1950 that \"Of every dollar the U.S. spends on food,\nabout 10Â¢ is passed over A & P countersâa massive yearly total of $2.9 billion.\nNext to General Motors, the A&P sells more goods than any other company in the\nworld.\" The New York Times in an editorial on September 7, 2011 wrote that\nGeorge Huntington Hartford's 2 sons John and George Hartford \"were among the\n20th centuryâs most accomplished and visionary businessmen.\"  Wall\nStreet Journal in an editorial on August 29, 2011 wrote \"Together the brothers,\nneither of whom had finished high school, built what would be, for 40 years, the\nlargest retail outlet in the world.\"
