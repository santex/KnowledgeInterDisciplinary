{"cursor":"11792","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nThe 'grade' (also called 'slope', 'incline', 'gradient', 'pitch' or 'rise') of a\nphysical feature, topographic landform or constructed element refers to the\namount of inclination of that surface to the horizontal. It is a special case of\nthe gradient in calculus where zero indicates [[Gravitation|gravitational\nlevel]]. A larger number indicates higher or steeper degree of \"tilt\". Often\nslope is calculated as a ratio of \"rise\" to \"run\", or as a fraction (\"rise over\nrun\") in which run is the horizontal distance and rise is the vertical distance.\n\nGrade or slope is applied to measuring existing physical features (such as\ncanyon and hillsides, stream and river banks and beds), or in designing and\nengineering new elements for construction (such as roads, landscape and garden\ngrading, roof pitches, railroads, aqueducts, and pedestrian-handicapped-bicycle\ncirculation routes).\n","linknr":289,"url":"Grade_(slope)","recorded":1362534999,"links":42,"instances":["calculus","earthmoving","transportation","rail_transport","geography","watercourse"],"pdf":["http://www.linzag.at/cms/media/en/linzagwebsite/dokumente/mobilittverkehr_1/pstlingbergbahn_1/folder_bergbahn.pdf","http://www.linzag.at/cms/media/en/linzagwebsite/dokumente/mobilittverkehr_1/pstlingbergbahn_1/folder_bergbahn.pdf","http://www.linzag.at/cms/media/en/linzagwebsite/dokumente/mobilittverkehr_1/pstlingbergbahn_1/folder_bergbahn.pdf","http://www.linzag.at/cms/media/en/linzagwebsite/dokumente/mobilittverkehr_1/pstlingbergbahn_1/folder_bergbahn.pdf"],"categories":["Physical
