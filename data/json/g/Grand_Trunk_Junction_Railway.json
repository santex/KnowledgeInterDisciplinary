{"cursor":"2621","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nThe 'Grand Trunk Junction Railway' was a subsidiary of the Grand Trunk Railway\nthat built a connecting line along 49th Street in Chicago, Illinois. The company\nwas incorporated on June 11, 1880, and opened on August 29, 1881 under lease to\nthe Chicago and Grand Trunk Railway. Poor's Manual of Railroads, 1885, p.\n[http://www.archive.org/stream/poorsmanualofrai18newyuoft#page/982/mode/2up\n982] Its line was double-tracked and began at the Chicago and Grand\nTrunk's main line at Elsdon, heading east across the Columbus, Chicago and\nIndiana Central Railway and just south of the Union Stock Yards to a junction\nwith the Chicago and Western Indiana Railroad, a terminal railroad that gave the\nChicago and Grand Trunk access to downtown Chicago, and which the Grand Trunk\nJunction acquired a one-fifth interest in. The 'Polk and Forty-ninth Streets\nJunction Railway', which did not construct any railroad, was incorporated on\nMarch 27 and merged into the Grand Trunk Junction on June 21, 1889. On January 15, 1901, just after the Chicago and\nGrand Trunk was reorganized as the Grand Trunk Western Railway, the latter\ncompany bought the property of the Grand Trunk Junction.\n\nThe western half of the line is still owned and operated by the Grand Trunk\nWestern Railroad as part of its Elsdon Subdivision, which continues south from\nElsdon along the Port Huron-bound main line, and north from a junction at Oakley\nAvenue to the Railport Yard at 43rd Street. The latter line is just east of the\nNorfolk Southern Railway's ex-Chicago River and Indiana Railroad line.
