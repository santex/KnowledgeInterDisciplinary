He served an eight-year\napprenticeship to bookseller Robert Bolton, starting in 1592, and became a\n\"freeman\" (a full member) of the Stationers Company on 13 January 1600. He\nestablished himself in his own printing business in 1604, at the sign of the\nWhite Horse in Fleet Lane, by marrying the widow of not one but two master\nprinters. Sidney Lee, Shakespeare's Venus and Adonis, Oxford, Clarendon\nPress, 1905; p. 32. His shop featured two or perhaps three presses, and\nfour compositors — a substantial operation for the time. Eld entered into\na partnership with Miles Fletcher in 1617; Fletcher took over the business once\nEld died of plague in 1624. F. E.
