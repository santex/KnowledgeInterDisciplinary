{"cursor":"70460","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n'The Gospel According to Thomas', commonly shortened to the 'Gospel of Thomas',\nis a well preserved early Christian, non-canonical sayings-gospel which many\nscholars believe provides insight into the Christian Oral Tradition. It was\ndiscovered near Nag Hammadi, Egypt, in December 1945, in one of a group of books\nknown as the Nag Hammadi library. The Gospel of Thomas was found among a\ncollection of fifty-two writings that included, in addition to an excerpt from\nPlato's ''Republic'', gospels claiming to have been written by Jesus's disciple\nPhilip. Scholars have speculated that the works were buried in response to a\nletter from Bishop Athanasius who for the first time declared a strict canon of\nChristian scripture. Bound by a method now called Coptic binding, the books\n(technically called codices) were found in an earthenware jar by a group of\npeasants who broke open the jar and otherwise subjected the books to careless\ntreatment resulting in significant damage\n\nThe Coptic language text, the second of seven contained in what modern-day\nscholars have designated as Codex II, is composed of 114 sayings attributed to\nJesus. Modern-day scholars have numbered the sayings and even parts of the\nsayings, but the text contains no numbering. Almost half of these sayings\nresemble those found in the Canonical Gospels, while it is speculated that the\nother sayings were added from Gnostic tradition. Lost Scriptures: Books that\ndid not make it into the New Testament by Bart Ehrman, pp. 19-20 Its place\nof origin may have been Syria, where Thomasine traditions were\nstrong. Eerdmans Commentary on the Bible by James D. G. Dunn, John William\nRogerson, 2003, ISBN 0-8028-3711-5 page 1574\n\nThe introduction states: \"These are the hidden words that the living Jesus\nspoke and Didymos Judas Thomas wrote them down.\" The Fifth Gospel,\nPatterson, Robinson, Bethge, 1998 Didymus (Greek) and Thomas (Aramaic)\nboth mean \"twin\". Some critical scholars suspect that this reference to the\nApostle Thomas is false, and that therefore the true author is\nunknown. April D. DeConick 2006 The Original Gospel of Thomas in\nTranslation ISBN 0-567-04382-7 page 2\n\nIt is possible that the document originated within a school of early Christians,\npossibly proto-Gnostics. Layton, Bentley, The Gnostic Scriptures, 1987,\np.361. Some critics further claim that even the description of Thomas as a\n\"gnostic\" gospel is based upon little other than the fact that it was found\nalong with gnostic texts at Nag Hammadi. Davies, Stevan L., The Gospel of\nThomas and Christian Wisdom, 1983, pp. 23â24. The name of Thomas was also\nattached to the Book of Thomas the Contender, which was also in Nag Hammadi\nCodex II, and the Acts of Thomas. It is important to note, however, that while\nthe Gospel of Thomas does not directly point to Jesus' divinity, it also does\nnot directly contradict it, and therefore neither supports nor contradicts\ngnostic beliefs. When asked his identity in the Gospel of Thomas, Jesus usually\ndeflects, ambiguously asking the disciples why they do not see what is right in\nfront of them. This is similar to passages in the canonical gospels like John\n12:16 and Luke 18:34. The text itself, however, continuously reflects Gnostic\nteachings by continuously referring to Jesus's sayings as \"secret\" and\n\"mysterious\", which were common gnostic catchphrases.\n\nThe Gospel of Thomas is very different in tone and structure from other New\nTestament apocrypha and the four Canonical Gospels. Unlike the canonical\nGospels, it is not a narrative account of the life of Jesus; instead, it\nconsists of [[logia]] (sayings) attributed to Jesus, sometimes stand-alone,\nsometimes embedded in short dialogues or parables. The text contains a possible\nallusion to the death of Jesus in logion 65 DeConick, April D., The\nOriginal Gospel of Thomas in Translation, 2006, p.214 (Parable of the\nWicked Tenants, paralleled in the Synoptic Gospels), but doesn't mention\ncrucifixion, resurrection, or final judgement; nor does it mention a messianic\nunderstanding of Jesus.
