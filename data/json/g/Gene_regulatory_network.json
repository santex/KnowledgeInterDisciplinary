In general, each mRNA molecule goes on to make a specific\nprotein (or set of proteins). In some cases this protein will be structural, and\nwill accumulate at the cell membrane or within the cell to give it particular\nstructural properties. In other cases the protein will be an enzyme, i.e., a micro-\nmachine that catalyses a certain reaction, such as the breakdown of a food\nsource or toxin. Some proteins though serve only to activate other genes, and\nthese are the transcription factors that are the main players in regulatory\nnetworks or cascades. By binding to the promoter region at the start of other\ngenes they turn them on, initiating the production of another protein, and so\non. Some transcription factors are inhibitory.\n\nIn single-celled organisms, regulatory networks respond to the external\nenvironment, optimising the cell at a given time for survival in this\nenvironment. Thus a yeast cell, finding itself in a sugar solution, will turn on\ngenes to make enzymes that process the sugar to alcohol. This\nprocess, which we associate with wine-making, is how the yeast cell makes its\nliving, gaining energy to multiply, which under normal circumstances would\nenhance its survival prospects.\n\nIn multicellular animals the same principle has been put in the service of gene\ncascades that control body-shape. Each time a cell divides, two cells\nresult which, although they contain the same genome in full, can differ in which\ngenes are turned on and making proteins. Sometimes a 'self-sustaining feedback\nloop' ensures that a cell maintains its identity and passes it on. Less\nunderstood is the mechanism of epigenetics by which chromatin modification may\nprovide cellular memory by blocking or allowing transcription. A major feature\nof multicellular animals is the use of morphogen gradients, which in effect\nprovide a positioning system that tells a cell where in the body it is, and\nhence what sort of cell to become. A gene that is turned on in one cell may make\na product that leaves the cell and diffuses through adjacent cells, entering\nthem and turning on genes only when it is present above a certain threshold\nlevel. These cells are thus induced into a new fate, and may even generate other\nmorphogens that signal back to the original cell. Over longer distances\nmorphogens may use the active process of signal transduction. Such signalling\ncontrols embryogenesis, the building of a body plan from scratch through a\nseries of sequential steps. They also control maintain adult bodies through\nfeedback processes, and the loss of such feedback because of a mutation can be\nresponsible for the cell proliferation that is seen in cancer. In parallel with\nthis process of building structure, the gene cascade turns on genes that make\nstructural proteins that give each cell the physical properties it needs. It has\nbeen suggested that, because biological molecular interactions are intrinsically\nstochastic, gene networks are the result of cellular processes and not their\ncause (i.e. cellular Darwinism). However, recent experimental evidence has\nfavored the attractor view of cell fates.\n","linknr":427,"url":"Gene_regulatory_network","recorded":1362483232,"links":29,"instances":["mathematics","biochemistry","biology","boston_university","mathematics","biochemistry","mathematics"],"pdf":["http://lis.epfl.ch/~markus/References/Kauffman69.pdf","http://lis.epfl.ch/~markus/References/Kauffman69.pdf","http://panmental.de/papers/FlagPottsGRNALife11.pdf","http://panmental.de/papers/FlagPottsGRNALife11.pdf","http://www.bu.edu/abl/pdf/blake2003.pdf?file=/nature/journal/v422/n6932/full/nature01546_fs.html&content_filetype=PDF","http://www.bu.edu/abl/pdf/blake2003.pdf?file=/nature/journal/v422/n6932/full/nature01546_fs.html&content_filetype=PDF","http://axon.cs.byu.edu/papers/smith_2010biot.pdf","http://axon.cs.byu.edu/papers/smith_2010biot.pdf","http://www.molgen.mpg.de/~markowet/docs/network-bib.pdf"],"categories":["Gene expression","Networks","Systems biology"],"headings":["Overview","Modelling","Prediction","Network connectivity","Bacterial regulatory networks","See also","Notes","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c4/Gene_Regulatory_Network.jpg/360px-Gene_Regulatory_Network.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Gene_Regulatory_Network_2.jpg/360px-Gene_Regulatory_Network_2.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/d/9/8d9c307cb7f3c4a32822a51922d1ceaa.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/2/2/d/22d771285d0051e884c5a39bf4215a8d.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/d/9/8d9c307cb7f3c4a32822a51922d1ceaa.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/3/5/e358efa489f58062f10dd7316b65649e.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/1/c/1/1c1ffd93f18791b792e9ec3b8432ea38.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/9/a/1/9a117e3374e84fb46920450946569279.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/1/a/81af8d9a5183838442a428b851906cd4.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/9/a/1/9a117e3374e84fb46920450946569279.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/9/a/1/9a117e3374e84fb46920450946569279.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/a/8/4/a8480d5d310e2e02229b6784ff310283.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/3/6/3/363b122c528f54df4a0446b6bab05515.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/3/d/83de78a4cc7c5a3e5e237ee045babd33.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["promoter","biology"],["hill_equation","biochemistry"],["fixed_point","mathematics"],["stability","mathematics"],["steady_state","biochemistry"],["critical_point","mathematics"],["james_collins","boston_university"]],"members":["critical_point","hill_equation","promoter","james_collins","fixed_point","steady_state","stability"],"related":["DNA","MRNA","Enzyme","Transcription_factors","Promoter_(biology)","Epigenetics","Chromatin","Morphogen","Diffuse","Morphogens","Signal_transduction","Embryogenesis","Body_plan","Feedback","Cancer","Transcription_factor","Gene_expression","Boolean_functions","Information_processing","Systems_biology","Mathematical_model","Differential_equation","Boolean_network","Petri_net","Bayesian_network","Graphical_Gaussian_model","Stochastic","Process_calculus","Time_series","Ordinary_differential_equation","Stochastic_differential_equation","Rate_equation","Michaelis-Menten","Polynomials","Hill_equation_(biochemistry)","Ansatz","Dynamical_system","Reaction_rate","Fixed_point_(mathematics)","Stability_(mathematics)","Steady_state","Oscillation","Attractor","Steady_state_(biochemistry)","Critical_point_(mathematics)","Bifurcation_theory","Nonlinearity","Dynamical_systems","Bifurcation_theory","Chaos_theory","Boolean_network","Stuart_Kauffman","Directed_graph","Boolean_function","Artificial_neural_network","Recurrent_neural_network","Cellular_differentiation","Morphogenesis","James_Collins_(Boston_University)","Gillespie_algorithm","Bacteria","Body_plan","Cis-regulatory_module","Genenetwork","Morphogen","Operon","Synexpression","Systems_biology"]}
