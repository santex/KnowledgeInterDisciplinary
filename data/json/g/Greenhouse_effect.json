The ability of the atmosphere to capture and recycle energy emitted by\nthe Earth surface is the defining characteristic of the greenhouse effect.]]\n\n\nThe 'greenhouse effect' is a process by which thermal radiation from a planetary\nsurface is absorbed by atmospheric greenhouse gases, and is re-radiated in all\ndirections. Since part of this re-radiation is back towards the surface and the\nlower atmosphere, it results in an elevation of the average surface temperature\nabove what it would be in the absence of the gases.\n\nSolar radiation at the frequencies of visible light largely passes through the\natmosphere to warm the planetary surface, which then emits this energy at the\nlower frequencies of infrared thermal radiation. Infrared radiation is absorbed\nby greenhouse gases, which in turn re-radiate much of the energy to the surface\nand lower atmosphere. The mechanism is named after the effect of solar radiation\npassing through glass and warming a greenhouse, but the way it retains heat is\nfundamentally different as a greenhouse works by reducing airflow, isolating the\nwarm air inside the structure so that heat is not lost by convection.\n\nIf an ideal thermally conductive blackbody was the same distance from the Sun as\nthe Earth is, it would have a temperature of about 5.3 Â°C. However, since the\nEarth reflects about 30%  of the incoming\nsunlight, this idealized planet's effective temperature (the temperature of a\nblackbody that would emit the same amount of radiation) would be about â18\nÂ°C.
