{"cursor":"3118","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'']] 'Gustav Heynhold' (or Gustav Heinhold, 1800â1860) was a German botanist who\nworked at the botanic gardens of Dresden and Frankfurt.\n\nIn 1828 he was in Trieste where he carried out mapping and published \"Uebersicht\nder Vegetation in den Umgebungen Triest's; von Hrn. Gustav Heynhold zu Dresden.\"\nHis best-known work was the [[Nomenclator Botanicus Hortensis]], an index of the\nbotanical names of garden plants. It is not certain whether he had an academic\ndegree or title. In 1846 the \"Botanischen Centralblatt fÃ¼r Deutschland\" listed\nhim as a private scholar in Dresden. In total he was responsible for naming some\n426 plant species. http://www.hm-noroc.de/personen/gustav-\nheynhold.html\n\nIn 1841, he renamed Arabis thaliana as [[Arabidopsis thaliana]] (L.) Heynh.\nArabidopsis was the first plant to have its genome sequenced, and is frequently\nused as a model for understanding the molecular biology of many plant traits,\nincluding flower development and light sensing.\n","linknr":128,"url":"Gustav_Heynhold","recorded":1362666023,"links":20,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["German botanists","1800 births","1860 deaths"],"headings":["Works","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/Arabidopsis_thaliana.jpg/220px-Arabidopsis_thaliana.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Wikispecies-logo.svg/34px-Wikispecies-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/ba/Flag_of_Germany.svg/40px-Flag_of_Germany.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/03/Scientist.svg/30px-Scientist.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/Beli-hibiskus.jpg/30px-Beli-hibiskus.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Dresden","Frankfurt","Trieste"]}
