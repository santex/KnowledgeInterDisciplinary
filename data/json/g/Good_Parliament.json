Sitting in London from April 28 to July 10, it was the longest\nParliament up until that time.\n\nIt took place during a time when the English court was perceived by much of the\nEnglish population to be corrupt, and its traditional name was due to the\nsincere efforts by its members to reform the government. It had a formidable\nenemy, however, in John of Gaunt, third son of Edward III and the effective\nruler of England at the time.\n\nParliament had not met since November 1373, 2Â½ years previously, because Edward\nIII and his councilors recognised the danger of calling parliament during a\nperiod of dissatisfaction. However, the need for funds was so pressing in 1376\nthat another Parliament was necessary.\n\nOnce the members were assembled, they were determined to clean up the corrupt\nRoyal Council. Peter de la Mare, a knight representing Hereford, had been\nelected as Speaker by the House of Commons, and on the first day he delivered an\naddress criticising England's recent military failures, condemning the\ncorruption at court, and calling for close scrutiny of the royal accounts.\nRichard Lyons (Warden of the Mint) and Lord Latimer, who were believed to be\nrobbing the treasury, were called before parliament and then imprisoned.\nLatimer's impeachment is the earliest recorded in Parliament. The\nking's mistress, Alice Perrers, was called and condemned to seclusion.\n\nJohn of Gaunt raised the question of the Salic law, which was the basis for the\nFrench case against Edward III's claim to the Crown of France, suggesting that\nthe English follow the French custom, but was unable to sway the assembly to his\npoint of view.\n\nMeanwhile, the eldest prince of the realm, Edward the Black Prince, was dying.\nHaving taken a house in London, he summoned both Edward III and John of Gaunt\nand made them swear to recognise his son, the future Richard II, as successor to\nEdward. Both John and the King swore to recognise Richard, and soon after\nParliament summoned Richard and acknowledged him as heir to the throne. The\nmembers were swayed by the immense prestige of Prince Edward, the country's\ngreatest military hero at the time.\n\nParliament then imposed a new set of councillors on the King: Edmund Mortimer,\nthe earl of March; William Courtenay, bishop of London; and William of Wykeham,\nbishop of Winchester.\n\nParliament was dissolved in July, and the following autumn, John of Gaunt\nattempted to undo its work. He barred the admission of the new councillors\nassigned to the king. He threw Peter de la Mare into prison at Nottingham. He\ndismissed the new council and recalled Latimer. Alice of Perrers was restored to\nthe company of the king. John also attacked William of Wykeham.\n\nIn 1377, John had another Parliament convene, the Bad Parliament. John had the\nGood Parliament declared unconstitutional and its acts removed from the books.\nDespite this, the public treasured the memory of the reforming Parliament and\nbestowed upon it the name of the Good Parliament.\n","linknr":102,"url":"Good_Parliament","recorded":1375081210,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Good_Parliament&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Good_Parliament&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/English_Parliament","/wiki/English_court","/wiki/John_of_Gaunt","/wiki/Edward_III_of_England","/wiki/Royal_Council","/wiki/Peter_de_la_Mare","/wiki/Hereford","/wiki/Speaker_of_the_English_House_of_Commons","/wiki/House_of_Commons_of_England","/wiki/Richard_Lyons_(Warden_of_the_Mint)","/wiki/William_Latimer,_4th_Baron_Latimer","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Alice_Perrers","/wiki/Salic_law","/wiki/Crown_of_France","/wiki/Edward_the_Black_Prince","/wiki/Richard_II_of_England","/wiki/Edmund_Mortimer,_3rd_Earl_of_March","/wiki/William_Courtenay","/wiki/William_of_Wykeham","/wiki/Nottingham","/wiki/Bad_Parliament","/w/index.php?title=Good_Parliament&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/List_of_Parliaments_of_England","/w/index.php?title=Good_Parliament&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-1","http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons/lib/research/briefings/snpc-02666.pdf","/wiki/Portable_Document_Format","/wiki/House_of_Commons_of_the_United_Kingdom","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Good_Parliament&oldid=543613335","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1376_in_England","/wiki/Category:14th-century_English_parliaments","/wiki/Category:Corruption_in_England","/wiki/Category:Privy_Council_of_England","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Good+Parliament&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Good+Parliament","/wiki/Good_Parliament","/wiki/Talk:Good_Parliament","#","/wiki/Good_Parliament","/w/index.php?title=Good_Parliament&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Good_Parliament&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Good_Parliament","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Good_Parliament","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Good_Parliament&oldid=543613335","/w/index.php?title=Good_Parliament&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1420353","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Good_Parliament&id=543613335","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Good+Parliament","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Good+Parliament&oldid=543613335&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Good_Parliament&printable=yes","//de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Parliament","//fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bon_Parlement","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1420353#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Parliament","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":["warden_of_the_mint"],"pdf":["http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons/lib/research/briefings/snpc-02666.pdf"],"categories":["1376
