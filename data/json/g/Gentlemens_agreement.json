The\nessence of a gentlemen's agreement is that it relies upon the honor of the\nparties for its fulfillment, rather than being in any way enforceable. It is,\ntherefore, distinct from a legal agreement or contract, which can be enforced if\nnecessary.\n","linknr":212,"url":"Gentlemen's_agreement","recorded":1362891408,"links":27,"instances":["business","resource_management","1956","automobile"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Contract law","Agreements"],"headings":["History","Gentlemen's bet","See also","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["pooling","resource_management"],["consolidation","business"],["saloon","automobile"],["gentlemen's_agreement_of_andhra_pradesh","1956"]],"members":["consolidation","pooling","saloon"],"related":["Agreement","Etiquette","Honor","Contract","Pooling_(resource_management)","Macmillan_Company","New_York","Industry","Steel_industry","Iron_industry","United_States_House_of_Representatives","United_States_Steel_Corporation","Consolidation_(business)","Government_Printing_Office","Washington,_D.C.","Saloon_(automobile)","Station_wagons","Monetary_policy","Trade_policy","Martinus_Nijhoff_Publishers","Edmund_Osma≈Ñczyk","Routledge","New_York","Treaty","Westview_Press","Boulder,_Colorado","United_States","Discriminatory","Restrictive_covenants","Upper-class","Rowman_&_Littlefield","Lanham,_Maryland","United_States_Supreme_Court","National_Football_League","Jackie_Robinson","Brooklyn_Dodgers","African_American","Baseball_color_line","Bet","Anti-trust","Gentlemen's_agreement_of_Andhra_Pradesh_(1956)","Good_faith","Handshake","Memorandum_of_understanding","News_embargo"]}
