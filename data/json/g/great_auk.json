It was the only modern species in the genus\n'Pinguinus', a group of birds that formerly included one other species of\nflightless giant auk from the Atlantic Ocean region. It bred on rocky, isolated\nislands with easy access to the ocean and a plentiful food supply, a rarity in\nnature that provided only a few breeding sites for the auks. When not breeding,\nthe auks spent their time foraging in the waters of the North Atlantic, ranging\nas far south as northern Spain through Canada, Greenland, Iceland, the Faroe\nIslands, Norway, Ireland, and Great Britain.\n\nThe Great Auk was tall and weighed around , making it the largest member of the\nalcid family. It had a black back and a white belly. The black beak was heavy\nand hooked with grooves on its surface. During summer, the Great Auk had a white\npatch over each eye. During winter, the auk lost these patches, instead\ndeveloping a white band stretching between the eyes. The wings were only long,\nrendering the bird flightless. Instead, the auk was a powerful swimmer, a trait\nthat it used in hunting. Its favourite prey were fish, including Atlantic\nMenhaden and Capelin, and crustaceans. Although agile in the water, it was\nclumsy on land. Great Auk pairs mated for life. They nested in extremely dense\nand social colonies, laying one egg on bare rock. The egg was white with\nvariable brown streaking. Both parents incubated for about six weeks before\ntheir young hatched. The young auks left the nest site after two or three weeks\nand the parents continued to care for them.\n\nThe Great Auk was an important part of many Native American cultures which\ncoexisted with the bird, both as a food source and as a symbolic item. Many\nMaritime Archaic people were buried with Great Auk bones, and one was buried\ncovered in over 200 auk beaks, which are assumed to have been part of a cloak\nmade of their skins. Early European explorers to the Americas used the auk as a\nconvenient food source or as fishing bait, reducing its numbers. The bird's down\nwas in high demand in Europe, a factor which largely eliminated the European\npopulations by the mid-16th century. Scientists soon began to realize that the\nGreat Auk was disappearing and it became the beneficiary of many early\nenvironmental laws, but this proved not to be enough. Its growing rarity\nincreased interest from European museums and private collectors in obtaining\nskins and eggs of the bird. On 3 July 1844, the last two confirmed specimens\nwere killed on Eldey, off the coast of Iceland, which also eliminated the last\nknown breeding attempt. There are unconfirmed later reports of roaming\nindividuals being seen or caught. A record of a bird in 1852 is considered by\nsome to be the last sighting of the species. The Great Auk is mentioned in a\nnumber of novels and the scientific journal of the American Ornithologists'\nUnion is named [[The Auk]] in honour of this bird.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"great_auk","recorded":1372152430,"links":[],"instances":["mythology","zoology","1762","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Alcinae","Animals described in 1758","Atlantic auks","Bird extinctions since 1500","Extinct animals of the United States","Extinct birds of the Faroe Islands","Extinct flightless birds","Prehistoric birds of North America","Species made extinct by human activities","Extinct birds of North America","Extinct birds of Atlantic islands"],"headings":["Taxonomy and evolution","Description","Distribution and habitat","Ecology and behavior","Relationship with humans","See also","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["morphology","biology"],["specific_name","zoology"],["hms_boston","1762"],["roc","mythology"]],"members":["roc","specific_name","hms_boston","morphology"],"related":["Kelvingrove_Art_Gallery_and_Museum","Glasgow","Animal","Chordate","Bird","Charadriiformes","Auk","Pierre_Joseph_Bonnaterre","Carolus_Linnaeus","Auk","Extinction","Species","Bird","Auk","Atlantic_Ocean","North_Atlantic","Beak","Atlantic_Menhaden","Capelin","Crustaceans","Maritime_Archaic","Eldey","American_Ornithologists'_Union","MtDNA","DNA_sequence","Morphology_(biology)","Biogeography","Razorbill","Little_Auk","Sister_species","Xantus's_Murrelet","Guillemot","Pliocene","Pliocene","Yorktown_Formation","North_Carolina","Carolus_Linnaeus","Genus","Specific_name_(zoology)","Latin","Flight_feather","Irish_language","Basque_language","French_language","Norsemen","Inuit","Welsh_language","Penguin","Convergent_evolution","Charadriiformes","Molt","Beak","Wing","Razorbill","St._Kilda,_Scotland","North_Atlantic","Canada","United_States","Norway","Greenland","Iceland","Faroe_Islands","Ireland","Great_Britain","France","Spain","Baffin_Bay","Gulf_of_St._Lawrence","British_Isles","Polar_Bear","Papa_Westray","Orkney_Islands","St_Kilda,_Scotland","Grímsey","Eldey_Island","Funk_Island","Newfoundland_and_Labrador","Magdalen_Islands","Gulf_of_St._Lawrence","Cape_Cod","Massachusetts","Grand_Banks","Florida","Massachusetts_Bay","Marine_mammal","Orca","White-tailed_Eagle","Funk_Island","Atlantic_Menhaden","Capelin","Lumpsucker","Shorthorn_Sculpin","Cod","Sand_lance","Plankton","Neanderthal","El_Pinto_Cave","Grotte_Cosquer","Maritime_Archaic","Port_au_Choix","Newfoundland_and_Labrador","Beothuk","Dorset_Eskimo","Saqqaq_culture","Grand_Banks_of_Newfoundland","Down_feather","Scandinavia","Labrador","Jacques_Cartier","Baffin_Island","Murre","Little_Ice_Age","St._John's,_Newfoundland_and_Labrador","Eider","HMS_Boston_(1762)","Stac_an_Armin","St_Kilda,_Scotland","Geirfuglasker","Eldey","John_Wolley","Grand_Banks_of_Newfoundland","IUCN","Funk_Island","Neolithic","Midden","Zoological_Museum,_Copenhagen","Errol_Fuller","Los_Angeles_County_Museum_of_Natural_History","Royal_Belgian_Institute_of_Natural_Sciences","Übersee-Museum_Bremen","Victorian_era","Guinness_Book_of_Records","Mainz","Second_World_War","Lisbon","Charles_Kingsley","Enid_Blyton","Robert_W._Chambers","James_Joyce","Roc_(mythology)","Nobel_Prize","Anatole_France","Myopia","Missionary","Stephen_Maturin","Patrick_O'Brian","Allen_Eckert","Farley_Mowat","Rockford's_Rock_Opera","Igor_Stravinsky","W._H._Auden","Chester_Kallman","Mascot","Archmere_Academy","Claymont,_Delaware","Fleming_College","Ontario","Adelaide_University","Australia","Knowledge_Masters","American_Ornithologists'_Union","Homer_Hickam","Walton_Ford","Errol_Fuller","Cuba","List_of_extinct_birds","Naturalis","QuickTime"]}
