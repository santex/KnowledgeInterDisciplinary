Geologists\nusually engage in studying geology. Geologists, studying more of an applied\nscience than a theoretical one, must approach Geology using physics, chemistry\nand biology as well as other sciences. Geologists, compared to scientists\nengaged in other fields, are generally more exposed to the outdoors than staying\nin laboratories; although some geologists prefer to perform most of their\nstudies in the lab.\n\nGeologists are engaged in exploration for mining companies in search of metals,\noils, and other Earth resources. They are also in the forefront of natural\nhazards and disasters warning and mitigation, studying earthquakes, volcanic\nactivity, tsunamis, weather storms, and the like; their studies are used to warn\nthe general public of the occurrence of these events. Currently, geologists are\nalso engaged in the discussion of climate change, as they study the history and\nevidence for this Earth process.\n",
