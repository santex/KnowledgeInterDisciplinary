{"cursor":"4729","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Gertrude Blanch' (ca. 1897 - 1996) was an American mathematician who did\npioneering work in numerical analysis and computation.\n\nBlanch was born 'Gittel Kaimowitz' in Kolno, Poland, arrived in the United\nStates as a child, and attended public schools in New York City. She spent\nfourteen years as a clerk, saving money for school. She received her B.S. in\nmathematics (minor in physics) from New York University in 1932. She received\nher Ph.D. from Cornell University in algebraic geometry in 1935.\n\nFor a while she worked as a substitute teacher at Hunter College; then, in 1938,\nshe began work on the Mathematical Tables Project of the WPA, for which she was\ntechnical director. This entailed designing algorithms that were executed by\nteams of human computers under her direction. Many of these computers possessed\nonly rudimentary mathematical skills, but the algorithms and error checking in\nthe Mathematical Tables Project were sufficiently well designed that their\noutput defined the standard for transcendental function solution for decades.\nThis project later became the Computation Laboratory of the National Bureau of\nStandards.\n\nThe Mathematical Tables Project became an independent organization following the\ntermination of the WPA at the end of 1942. During World War II, it operated as a\nmajor computing computing office for the US government and did calculations for\nthe Office for Scientific Research and Development, the Army, the Navy, the\nManhattan Project and other institutions. Blanch led group throughout the war.\n\nAfter the war, Blanch's career was hampered by FBI suspicions that she was\nsecretly a communist. Their evidence for this seems scarce, and included, for\nexample, the observation that she had never married or had children. In what\nmust have been a remarkable showdown, the diminutive fifty-year-old\nmathematician demanded, and won, a hearing to clear her name.\n\nSubsequently, she worked for the Institute for Numerical Analysis at UCLA and\nthe Aerospace Research Laboratory at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton,\nOhio. She was an early member of the ACM.\n\nShe published over thirty papers on functional approximation, numerical analysis\nand Mathieu functions. In 1962, she was elected a Fellow in the American\nAssociation for the Advancement of Science. In 1964, she received the Federal\nWoman's Award, an award for women who had exemplary professional service in the\nUnited States Government.\n\nBlanch retired in 1967 at the age of 69, but continued working under a\nconsulting contract for the Air Force for another year. Thereafter she moved to\nSan Diego and continued to work on numerical solutions of Mathieu functions\nuntil her death in 1996, concentrating on the use of continued fractions to\nachieve highly accurate results in a small number of computational steps. This\nwork has not been published.\n\nThe Gertrude Blanch Papers, 1932-1996 are stored at the Charles Babbage\nInstitute, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis.\n\nNote: The year of birth is given as both 1897 and 1898.\n","linknr":120,"url":"Gertrude_Blanch","recorded":1375067383,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Gertrude_Blanch&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Gertrude_Blanch&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/Mathematician","/wiki/Numerical_analysis","/wiki/Computation","/wiki/Poland","/wiki/New_York_City","/wiki/New_York_University","/wiki/Cornell_University","/wiki/Algebraic_geometry","/wiki/Hunter_College","/wiki/Mathematical_Tables_Project","/wiki/Works_Progress_Administration","/wiki/Human_computers","/wiki/Transcendental_function","/wiki/National_Bureau_of_Standards","/wiki/World_War_II","/wiki/Manhattan_Project","/wiki/FBI","/wiki/Communist","/wiki/UCLA","/wiki/Wright-Patterson_Air_Force_Base","/wiki/Dayton,_Ohio","/wiki/Association_for_Computing_Machinery","/wiki/Hybrid_functional","/wiki/Mathieu_function","/wiki/American_Association_for_the_Advancement_of_Science","/wiki/San_Diego","/wiki/Mathieu_function","/wiki/Continued_fraction","/wiki/Charles_Babbage_Institute","/wiki/University_of_Minnesota","/wiki/Minneapolis","/w/index.php?title=Gertrude_Blanch&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Gertrude_Blanch&action=edit&section=2","http://www.agnesscott.edu/lriddle/women/Blanch.htm","/wiki/Agnes_Scott_College","http://www.cbi.umn.edu/collections/inv/cbi00162.html","/wiki/Charles_Babbage_Institute","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/18823315","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gertrude_Blanch&oldid=558240817","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1897_births","/wiki/Category:1996_deaths","/wiki/Category:Imperial_Russian_emigrants_to_the_United_States","/wiki/Category:New_York_University_alumni","/wiki/Category:Cornell_University_alumni","/wiki/Category:Hunter_College","/wiki/Category:University_of_California,_Los_Angeles_staff","/wiki/Category:Women_mathematicians","/wiki/Category:People_from_Dayton,_Ohio","/wiki/Category:20th-century_American_mathematicians","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Gertrude+Blanch&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Gertrude+Blanch","/wiki/Gertrude_Blanch","/wiki/Talk:Gertrude_Blanch","#","/wiki/Gertrude_Blanch","/w/index.php?title=Gertrude_Blanch&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Gertrude_Blanch&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Gertrude_Blanch","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Gertrude_Blanch","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Gertrude_Blanch&oldid=558240817","/w/index.php?title=Gertrude_Blanch&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5553285","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Gertrude_Blanch&id=558240817","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Gertrude+Blanch","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Gertrude+Blanch&oldid=558240817&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Gertrude_Blanch&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5553285#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gertrude_Blanch","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikime
