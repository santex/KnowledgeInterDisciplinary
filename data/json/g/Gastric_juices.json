It has a pH of 1.5\nto 3.5 and is composed of hydrochloric acid (HCl) (around 0.5%, or 5000 parts\nper million) as high as 0.1 N http://www.acidbase.org/index.php?show=sb&act-\nion=explode&id=31&sid=42 , and large quantities of potassium chloride (KCl)\nand sodium chloride (NaCl). The acid plays a key role in digestion of proteins,\nby activating digestive enzymes, and making ingested proteins unravel so that\ndigestive enzymes break down the long chains of amino acids.\n\nGastric acid is produced by cells lining the stomach, which are coupled to\nsystems to increase acid production when needed. Other cells in the stomach\nproduce bicarbonate, a base, to buffer the fluid, ensuring that it does not\nbecome too acidic. These cells also produce mucus, which forms a viscous\nphysical barrier to prevent gastric acid from damaging the stomach. Cells in the\nbeginning of the small intestine, or duodenum, further produce large amounts of\nbicarbonate to completely neutralize any gastric acid that passes further down\ninto the digestive tract.\n\nThe presence of gastric acid in the stomach and its function in digestion was\nfirst characterized by United States Army surgeon William Beaumont around 1830.\nBeaumont was able to study the stomach action of fur trapper Alexis St. Martin\ndue to the latter's gastric fistula.\n","linknr":365,"url":"Gastric_juices","recorded":1362500819,"links":44,"instances":["parietal_cell","biology","chemistry","molecule","biochemistry","anatomy"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Acids","Body fluids","Stomach|Acid"],"headings":["Physiology","Role in disease","Pharmacology","History","See also","Notes","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/22/Control-of-stomach-acid-sec.png/350px-Control-of-stomach-acid-sec.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/90/Determinants_of_Gastric_Acid_Secretion.svg/760px-Determinants_of_Gastric_Acid_Secretion.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg/20px-Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["canaliculus","parietal_cell"],["lumen","anatomy"],["denaturation","biochemistry"],["d_cell","biology"],["neutralization","chemistry"],["water","molecule"]],"members":["canaliculus","d_cell","neutralization","water","denaturation","lumen"],"related":["Stomach","PH","Hydrochloric_acid","Parts_per_million","Potassium_chloride","Sodium_chloride","Proteins","Digestive_enzymes","Amino_acids","Bicarbonate","Buffering_agent","Mucus","Duodenum","United_States_Army","William_Beaumont","Alexis_St._Martin","Fistula","Parietal_cell","Canaliculus_(parietal_cell)","Lumen_(anatomy)","Epithelium","Fundic_glands","Gastric_mucosa","PH","Proton_pump","Hydrogen_potassium_ATPase","Bicarbonate","Alkaline_tide","Protein","Denaturation_(biochemistry)","Peptide_bond","Chief_cell","Pepsinogen","Rennin","Hydrochloric_acid","Enzyme","Pepsin","Amino_acid","Proteolysis","Microorganism","Infection","Cytoplasm","Transmembrane_potential_difference","Volt","Diffusion","Carbonic_anhydrase","Carbonic_acid","Hydrogen_potassium_ATPase","Antiporter","Molarity","Artery","Blood","Isotonicity","Vagus_Nerve","Parietal_cells","ECL_cells","Histamine","Gastrin_Releasing_Peptide","G_cells","Somatostatin","D_cells","Amino_acids","Caffeine","Chyme","Amino_acids","Entero-oxyntin","Autonomic_nervous_system","Hormone","Parasympathetic_nervous_system","Vagus_nerve","Gastrin","Histamine","Enterochromaffine-like_cell","Vasoactive_intestinal_peptide","Cholecystokinin","Secretin","Negative_feedback","G_cell","D_cell_(biology)","Neurotransmitter","Acetylcholine","Gastrin-releasing_peptide","Somatostatin","Duodenum","Neutralization_(chemistry)","Sodium_bicarbonate","PH","Pancreas","Secretin","Polypeptide","S_cell","Jejunum","Carbonic_acid","Carbon_dioxide","Water_(molecule)","Hypochlorhydria","Achlorhydria","Disinfectant","Digestive_tract","Zollinger–Ellison_syndrome","Hypercalcemia","Gastrin","Gastric_ulcer","Chlorine","Metabolic_alkalosis","Hydrogen","Chlorine","Proton_pump_inhibitor","H2_antagonist","Antacid","Digestion","William_Beaumont","Alexis_St._Martin","Fistula","Stomach","Digestion","Gastroesophageal_reflux_disease","Discovery_and_development_of_proton_pump_inhibitors"]}
