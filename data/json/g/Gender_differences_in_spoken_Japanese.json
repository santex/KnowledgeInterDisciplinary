{"cursor":"8445","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nThe Japanese language has some words and some grammatical constructions that are\nassociated with men or boys, while others are associated with women or girls.\nSuch differences are sometimes called \"gendered language.\" In Japanese, speech\npatterns associated with women are referred to as onna kotoba (å¥³è¨è, \"women's\nwords\") or joseigo (å¥³æ§èª, \"women's language\").\n\nIn general, the words and speech patterns associated with men are seen as rough,\nvulgar, or abrupt, while those associated with women are considered more polite,\nmore deferential, or \"softer\". Some linguists consider the rough/soft continuum\nmore accurate than the male/female continuum. For example, Eleanor Harz Jorden\nin [[Japanese: The Spoken Language]] refers to the styles as blunt/gentle,\nrather than male/female.\n\nThere are no gender differences in written Japanese (except in quoted speech),\nand almost no differences in polite speech ([[teineigo]]), since males take on\n\"softer\" speech, except for the fact that women may be more likely to use polite\nspeech in the first place.\n","linknr":254,"url":"Gender_differences_in_spoken_Japanese","recorded":1362480907,"links":25,"instances":["linguistic_anthropologist","linguistics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Japanese language","Japanese society","Gender in language|Japanese","Etiquette by region|Japanese","Sociolinguistics","Japanese honorifics"],"headings":["Traditional characteristics of women's speech","Traditional characteristics of Japanese men's speech","Gender differences in modern society","Problems for Japanese learners","See also","References","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["copula","linguistics"],["miyako_inoue","linguistic_anthropologist"]],"members":["miyako_inoue","copula"],"related":["Japanese_language","Eleanor_Harz_Jorden","Copula_(linguistics)","Honorific_speech_in_Japanese","Miyako_Inoue_(linguistic_anthropologist)","Gender-neutral_language","Okama","Faux_pas","Language_acquisition","Japanese_pronouns","Japanese_titles","Japanese_pronouns","Language_and_gender","Nyōbō_kotoba"]}
