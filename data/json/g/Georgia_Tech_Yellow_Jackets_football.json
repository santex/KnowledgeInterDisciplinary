The Yellow Jackets\nteam, also known as the \"Ramblin' Wreck\", and historically as the \"Engineers\",\ncompetes in the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) of the National Collegiate\nAthletic Association (NCAA) and the Coastal Division of the Atlantic Coast\nConference (ACC). The Georgia Institute of Technology has fielded a football\nteam since 1892 and has an all-time record of 664â447â43 (a .575 winning\npercentage). The Yellow Jackets play in Bobby Dodd Stadium at Historic Grant\nField in Atlanta, Georgia, which has a capacity of 55,000. The Yellow Jackets\nhave won four Division I-A college football national championships and fifteen\nconference titles.\n\nA number of successful collegiate and professional football players once played\nfor Tech. The school has 48 first-team All-Americans and over\n150 alumni who have played in the NFL. Among the most lauded and most\nnotable players the school has produced are Keith Brooking, Joe Hamilton, Joe\nGuyon, Billy Shaw and Calvin Johnson. In addition to its players, Tech's\nfootball program has been noted for its coaches and its, in many cases bizarre\ntraditions and game finishes. Among the team's former coaches are John Heisman,\nfor whom the Heisman trophy is named, and Bobby Dodd, for whom the Bobby Dodd\nCoach of the Year Award and the school's stadium are named. Heisman led the team\nto the highest-scoring game in American football history, and both Heisman and\nDodd led Tech's football team to national championships. Dodd also led the\nJackets on their longest winning streak against the University of Georgia,\nTech's most time-endured rival.\n","linknr":1401,"url":"Georgia_Tech_Yellow_Jackets_football","recorded":1375066865,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Georgia_Tech_Yellow_Jackets_football&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Georgia_Tech_Yellow_Jackets_football&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d8/AmericanFootball_current_event.svg/40px-AmericanFootball_current_event.svg.png","/wiki/2012_Georgia_Tech_Yellow_Jackets_football_team","/wiki/File:Georgia_Tech_Outline_Interlocking_logo.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1e/Georgia_Tech_Outline_Interlocking_logo.svg/100px-Georgia_Tech_Outline_Interlocking_logo.svg.png","/wiki/Paul_Johnson_(American_football_coach)","/wiki/Bobby_Dodd_Stadium_at_Historic_Grant_Field","/wiki/Atlanta","/wiki/Atlantic_Coast_Conference","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Ramblin%27_Wreck_from_Georgia_Tech","/wiki/Up_With_the_White_and_Gold","/wiki/Georgia_Tech_Yellow_Jacket_Marching_Band","/wiki/Russell_Athletic","http://www.ramblinwreck.com/","/wiki/Georgia_Institute_of_Technology","/wiki/American_football","/wiki/Division_I_(NCAA)#Division_I-Bowl_Subdivision","/wiki/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association","/wiki/Coastal_Division","/wiki/Atlantic_Coast_Conference","/wiki/Bobby_Dodd_Stadium","/wiki/Atlanta,_Georgia","/wiki/Football_Bowl_Subdivision","/wiki/College_football_national_championships_in_NCAA_Division_I_FBS","/wiki/All-Americans","/wiki/National_Football_League","/wiki/Keith_Brooking","/wiki/Joe_Hamilton_(American_football)","/wiki/Joe_Guyon","/wiki/Billy_Shaw","/wiki/Calvin_Johnson_(American_football)","/wiki/John_Heisman","/wiki/Heisman_trophy","/wiki/Bobby_Dodd","/wiki/Bobby_Dodd_Coach_of_the_Year_Award","/wiki/1916_Cumberland_vs._Georgia_Tech_football_game","/wiki/Georgia_Bulldogs_football","/wiki/Georgia-Georgia_Tech_Rivalry","#History","#The_beginnings:_1892.E2.80.931903","#Heisman.27s_legend:_1904.E2.80.931919","#Alexander_continues_the_trend:_1920.E2.80.931944","#Dodd_wins_titles.2C_sets_records.2C_.26_beats_the_Dogs:_1945.E2.80.931966","#Coaching_in_Dodd.27s_shadow:_1967.E2.80.931986","#Old_gold_gets_new_shine:_1987.E2.80.931991","#Controversies_and_Heisman_contention:_1992.E2.80.932001","#Great_upsets.2C_upsetting_losses.2C_and_a_termination:_2002.E2.80.932007","#Paul_Johnson_era:_2008.E2.80.93Present","#Home_stadium","#Logos_and_uniforms","#Rivalries","#Traditions","#Team_achievements","#National_championships","#Conference_championships","#Divisional_championships","#Bowl_history","#Individual_achievements","#Heisman_Trophy_finalists","#All-Americans","#Position_award_winners","#Post-collegiate_accolades","#Future_non-conference_opponents","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Georgia_Tech_Yellow_Jackets_football&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/List_of_Georgia_Tech_Yellow_Jackets_football_seasons","/w/index.php?title=Georgia_Tech_Yellow_Jackets_football&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/File:First_GT_Football_Team_1893.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/First_GT_Football_Team_1893.jpg/220px-First_GT_Football_Team_1893.jpg","/wiki/File:First_GT_Football_Team_1893.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Mercer_University","/wiki/Macon,_Georgia","/wiki/Macon_Telegraph","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Leonard_Wood","/wiki/United_States_Army","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Clean,_Old-Fashioned_Hate","#cite_note-cofh-4","#cite_note-more-5","#cite_note-dhwg-6","/w/index.php?title=Georgia_Tech_Yellow_Jackets_football&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/1916_Cumberland_vs._Georgia_Tech_football_game","/wiki/John_Heisman","/wiki/Clemson_Tigers_football","#cite_note-ens-7","#cite_note-cofh-4","/wiki/File:GT_Cumberland_222_scoreboard.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d0/GT_Cumberland_222_scoreboard.jpg/220px-GT_Cumberland_222_scoreboard.jpg","/wiki/File:GT_Cumberland_222_scoreboard.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Cumberland_University","#cite_note-story222-8","/wiki/1916_Cumberland_vs._Georgia_Tech_football_game","#cite_note-222to0-9","#cite_note-story222-8","/wiki/College_football_national_championships_in_NCAA_Division_I_FBS","#cite_note-timeline1910
