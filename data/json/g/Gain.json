{"cursor":"7009","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nIn electronics, 'gain' is a measure of the ability of a circuit (often an\namplifier) to increase the power or amplitude of a signal from the input to\nthe output, by adding energy to the signal converted from some power supply.\nIt is usually defined as the mean ratio of the signal output of a system to\nthe signal input of the same system. It may also be defined on a logarithmic\nscale, in terms of the decimal logarithm of the same ratio (\"dB gain\"). A gain\ngreater than one (zero dB), that is, amplification, is the defining property\nof an active component or circuit, while a passive circuit will have a gain of\nless than one.\n\nThus, the term gain on its own is ambiguous. For example, \"a gain of five\" may\nimply that either the voltage, current or the power is increased by a factor of\nfive, although most often this will mean a voltage gain of five for audio and\ngeneral purpose amplifiers, especially operational amplifiers, but a power gain\nfor radio frequency amplifiers. Furthermore, the term gain is also applied in\nsystems such as sensors where the input and output have different units; in such\ncases the gain units must be specified, as in \"5 microvolts per photon\" for the\nresponsivity of a photosensor. The \"gain\" of a bipolar transistor normally\nrefers to forward current transfer ratio, either h FE (\"Beta\", the\nstatic ratio of I c divided by I b at some operating point),\nor sometimes h fe (the small-signal current gain, the slope of the\ngraph of I c against I b at a point).\n\nThe term has slightly different meanings in two other fields. In antenna design,\nantenna gain is the ratio of power received by a directional antenna to power\nreceived by an isotropic antenna. In laser physics, gain may refer to the\nincrement of power along the beam propagation direction in a gain medium, and\nits dimension is m â1 (inverse meter) or 1/meter.\n","linknr":181,"url":"Gain","recorded":1362478003,"links":31,"instances":["electrical_engineering","physics","telecommunication","radio"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Antennas (radio)","Electronics terminology"],"headings":["Logarithmic units and decibels","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/5/d/45da35dfe9b8705f5dfbce2242a2d17d.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/3/0/e3055f2ed107586a29279b5be034dd3f.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/6/4/f/64f36fe9b0163f836424bf34579c98dd.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/c/9/a/c9a5fd06507604f34bf5c9114819ed64.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/3/9/83938f8ba1d766fa984a431608efee48.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/c/f/ecf58c2afead28ec72b6ee917b30432d.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/a/a/b/aabee1cd3a636386fcec36f862cd8e52.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/e/e/4ee8e39e2c1a58bb81d55b0f37f1e476.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/9/2/592841be3aa47cf8fcb2e6bc4f7a1859.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/6/7/b/67b614d267c2bbb62b677e95c174de15.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/6/9/4697bc5b578ef3a8760652631302d82b.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/d/5/8d5df70ccdbdcb429728efa1ba6a3dd3.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/e/b/eeb16b821d46701e95f01326c0cdf5ec.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/62/PD-icon.svg/12px-PD-icon.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["power","physics"],["signal","electrical_engineering"],["signalling","telecommunication"],["signalling","telecommunication"],["antenna","radio"]],"members":["signal","power","signalling","antenna"],"related":["Electronics","Electrical_network","Amplifier","Power_(physics)","Amplitude","Signal_(electrical_engineering)","Power_supply","Ratio","Signalling_(telecommunication)","Signalling_(telecommunication)","Logarithm","Decibel","Active_component","Passive_circuit","Voltage","Electric_current","Electric_power","Amplifier","Operational_amplifier","Radio_frequency","Sensor","Responsivity","Bipolar_transistor","Antenna_(radio)","Antenna_gain","Isotropic_antenna","Laser_physics","Gain_medium","Inverse_meter","Power_gain","Decibel","10_log_rule","Natural_logarithm","Neper","Joule's_law","20_log_rule","Electrical_impedance","Joule's_law","Electrical_impedance","Bipolar_transistor","SI","Operational_transconductance_amplifier","Transconductance","Siemens","Mho","Active_laser_medium","Antenna_gain","Aperture-to-medium_coupling_loss","Automatic_gain_control","Attenuation","Complex_gain","DC_offset","Effective_radiated_power","Gain_before_feedback","Insertion_gain","Loop_gain","Open-loop_gain","Net_gain","Power_gain","Process_gain","Transmitter_power_output"]}
