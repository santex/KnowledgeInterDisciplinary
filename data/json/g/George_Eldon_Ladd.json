{"cursor":"6512","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'George Eldon Ladd' (July 31, 1911 â 1982 ) was a Baptist\nminister and professor of New Testament exegesis and theology at Fuller\nTheological Seminary in Pasadena, California, known in Christian eschatology for\nhis promotion of inaugurated eschatology and \"futuristic post-tribulationism.\"\n\nLadd was born in Alberta, Canada, and was raised in New England. He studied\ntheology at Gordon College in Massachusetts, and was ordained in 1933 in the\nNorthern Baptist Convention. He pastored churches in New\nHampshire and Vermont while pursuing further education at Gordon Divinity\nSchool. Ladd served as an instructor at Gordon College of Theology and Missions\n(now Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary), Wenham, Massachusetts from 1942â45.\nHe was an associate professor of New Testament and Greek from 1946â50, and head\nof the department of New Testament from 1946â49. He studied at Harvard\nUniversity during this period, completing a PhD dissertation on \"The Eschatology\nof the Didache\".\n\nLadd moved to California in 1950, and taught biblical theology at Fuller\nTheological Seminary, Pasadena. Fuller was in the fourth year of its existence\nwhen Ladd joined the faculty, and Hagner notes that he \"became one of the key\nfigures in developing the seminary's direction.\"\n\nLadd's best-known work, A Theology of the New Testament, has been used by\nthousands of seminary students since its publication in 1974. In a poll\nconducted by Mark Noll in 1986, this work ranked as the second most influential\nbook among evangelical scholars, second only to Calvin's [[Institutes of the\nChristian Religion|Institutes]]. A Theology of the New Testament was\nenhanced and updated by Donald A. Hagner in 1993. Ladd's belief in both present\nand future aspects of the Kingdom of God caused his detractors to critically\ncompare his eschatological views to the Amillennialism that was popular within\nReformed theological circles. D'Elia, John A.. A Place at the Table: George\nEldon Ladd and the Rehabilitation of Evangelical Scholarship in America. Oxford\nUniversity Press, 2008, p. 49. Despite these comparisons, Ladd was not\nReformed, and in fact rejected the Calvinistic view of the doctrine of\nsalvation. D'Elia, John A.. A Place at the Table: George Eldon Ladd and the\nRehabilitation of Evangelical Scholarship in America. Oxford University Press,\n2008, p. 10.\n\nJohn Piper uses Ladd's desire for scholarly credibility as a cautionary tale,\nand relates how Ladd \"was almost undone emotionally and professionally\" by\nNorman Perrin's critical review of Ladd's Jesus and the Kingdom. Piper goes on\nto describe how Ladd walked through the halls of Fuller shouting and waving a\nroyalty check when A Theology of the New Testament was a stunning success ten\nyears later.\n\nLadd was a notable, modern proponent of Historic Premillennialism, and often\ncriticized dispensationalist views. This was notable during this period, as\ndispensationalism was by far the most widely held view among evangelicals during\nthe mid-twentieth century. D'Elia, John A.. A Place at the Table: George\nEldon Ladd and the Rehabilitation of Evangelical Scholarship in America. Oxford\nUniversity Press, 2008, p. xxiii. His writings regarding the Kingdom of\nGod (especially his view of inaugurated eschatology) have become a cornerstone\nof Kingdom theology. His perspective is expressed in The Meaning of the\nMillennium: Four Views, R. G. Clouse, editor (Downers Grove: InterVarsity Press,\n1977) and the shorter and more accessible The Gospel of the Kingdom\n(Paternoster, 1959).\n\nIn 1978, a [[Festschrift]] was published in his honour. Unity and Diversity in\nNew Testament Theology: Essays in Honor of George E. Ladd (ISBN 080283504X),\nwhich included contributions by Leon Morris, William Barclay, F. F. Bruce, I.\nHoward Marshall, Richard Longenecker and Daniel Fuller.\n","linknr":160,"url":"George_Eldon_Ladd","recorded":1375070645,"links":["/w/index.php?title=George_Eldon_Ladd&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=George_Eldon_Ladd&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/George_Ladd_(disambiguation)","#cite_note-Hagner-1","/wiki/Baptist","/wiki/New_Testament","/wiki/Exegesis","/wiki/Theology","/wiki/Fuller_Theological_Seminary","/wiki/Pasadena,_California","/wiki/Christian_eschatology","/wiki/Inaugurated_eschatology","/wiki/Alberta","/wiki/Canada","/wiki/New_England","/wiki/Gordon_College_(Massachusetts)","/wiki/Massachusetts","/wiki/American_Baptist_Churches_USA","#cite_note-Hagner-1","/wiki/New_Hampshire","/wiki/Vermont","/wiki/Gordon_Divinity_School","/wiki/Gordon-Conwell_Theological_Seminary","/wiki/Wenham,_Massachusetts","/wiki/New_Testament","/wiki/Harvard_University","/wiki/Didache","#cite_note-Hagner-1","/wiki/Fuller_Theological_Seminary","/wiki/Pasadena,_California","#cite_note-Hagner-1","/wiki/Seminary","/wiki/Mark_Noll","/wiki/John_Calvin","/wiki/Institutes_of_the_Christian_Religion","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Inaugurated_eschatology","/wiki/Amillennialism","/wiki/Calvinism","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Monergism","#cite_note-4","/wiki/John_Piper_(theologian)","/wiki/Norman_Perrin","#cite_note-5","/wiki/Historic_Premillennialism","/wiki/Dispensationalist","#cite_note-6","/wiki/Kingdom_of_God","/wiki/Inaugurated_eschatology","/wiki/Kingdom_theology","/wiki/Festschrift","/wiki/Special:BookSources/080283504X","/wiki/Leon_Morris","/wiki/William_Barclay_(theologian)","/wiki/F._F._Bruce","/wiki/I._Howard_Marshall","/wiki/Richard_Longenecker","/wiki/Daniel_Fuller","/w/index.php?title=George_Eldon_Ladd&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0802811116","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0802812805","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0802816843","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0802806805","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0802815316","/w/index.php?title=George_Eldon_Ladd&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-Hagner_1-0","#cite_ref-Hagner_1-1","#cite_ref-Hagner_1-2","#cite_ref-Hagner_1-3","#cite_ref-2","/wiki/Mark_Noll","#cite_ref-3","#cite_ref-4","#cite_ref-5","/wiki/John_Piper_(theologian)","#cite_ref-6","/w/index.php?title=George_Eldon_Ladd&action=edit&section=3","http://www.theologicalstudies.org.uk/theo_ladd.php","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/109914665","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=George_Eldon_Ladd&oldid=551000506","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1911_births","/wiki/Category:1982_deaths","/wiki/Category:Premillennialism","/wiki/Category:Fuller_Theological_Seminary_faculty","/wiki/Category:Gordon-Conwell_Theological_Seminary_faculty","/wiki/Category:New_Testament_scholars","/wiki/Category:People_from_Alberta","/wiki/Category:Gordon_College_(Massachusetts)_alumni","/wiki/Category:Gordon_College_(Massachusetts)_faculty","/wiki/Category:Harvard_University_alumni","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=George+Eldon+Ladd&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=George+Eldon+Ladd","/wiki/George_Eldon_Ladd","/wiki/Talk:George_Eldon_Ladd","#","/wiki/George_Eldon_Ladd","/w/index.php?title=George_Eldon_Ladd&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=George_Eldon_Ladd&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/George_Eldon_Ladd","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/George_Eldon_Ladd","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=George_Eldon_Ladd&oldid=551000506","/w/index.php?title=Geor
