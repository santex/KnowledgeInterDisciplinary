Until he\nwas 14, he attended school in Sommerfeld (now Lubsko, Poland). Domagk studied\nmedicine at the University of Kiel, but volunteered to serve as a soldier in\nWorld War I, where he was wounded in December 1914, working the rest of the war\nas medic. After the war, he finished his studies, and worked at the University\nof Greifswald, where he researched infections caused by bacteria. In 1925, he\nfollowed his professor Walter Gross to the University of MÃ¼nster (WWU) and\nbecame professor there himself. He also started working at the Bayer\nlaboratories at Wuppertal. The same year, he married Gertrud StrÃ¼be. Later they\nwould have three sons and a daughter.\n\nHe was appointed the director of Bayer's Institute of Pathology and\nBacteriology, where he continued the studies of Josef Klarer and Fritz Mietzsch,\nbased on works by Paul Ehrlich, to use dyes, at that time a major product of IG\nFarben, as antibiotics. He found the sulfonamide Prontosil to be effective\nagainst streptococcus, and treated his own daughter with it, saving her the\namputation of an arm.\n\nIn 1939, Domagk received the Nobel Prize in Medicine for this discovery, the\nfirst drug effective against bacterial infections. He was forced by the Nazi\nregime to refuse the prize and was arrested by the Gestapo for a\nweek.

Domagk's work on sulfonamides eventually\nled to the development of the antituberculosis drugs thiosemicarbazone and\nisoniazid, which helped to curb the epidemic of tuberculosis which swept Europe\nafter World War II.\n\nAfter the war, in 1947, Domagk was finally able to receive his Nobel Prize, but\nnot the monetary portion of the prize due to the time that had elapsed.\n\nHe became a Foreign Member of the Royal Society in 1959, his short biography was\npublished by the Royal Society in 1964.

He continued\nto live and work in Wuppertal.
