{"cursor":"5713","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" chansonnier]] 'Guilhem Ademar' (; also spelled 'Guillem', 'Adamar', or\n 'Azemar'; fl. 1190/1195–1217) was a troubadour from the GÃ©vaudan.He\n travelled between the courts of Albi, Toulouse, Narbonne, and Spain. He\n achieved fame enough in his lifetime to be satirised by the Monge de Montaudon.\n He entered holy orders towards the end of his life. Sixteen\n poems—fourteen [[Canso (song)|cansos]], a [[sirventes]], and a\n [[partimen]] with Eble d'Ussel—form his surviving corpus. His cansos are\n his most famous pieces. Usually humorous, several mock the poetry of Ademar's\n more illustrious contemporary Arnaut Daniel. One canso survives with a tune.\n\nAccording to his [[Vida (Occitan literary form)|vida]], Guilhem was the son of a\npoor knight from Meyrueis (Maruois), the lord of which castle created him a\nknight. He was an eloquent man who \"knew well how to invent (trobaire)\npoetry.\" Egan, 46. When he was no longer able to support\nhimself as a knight he took to minstrelsy and \"was greatly honoured by all the\nhigh society.\" Towards the end of his life he joined the Order\nof Grandmont (Granmon).\n\nGuilhem Ademar's career can be dated from a reference in a poetic satire of\ncontemporary troubadours by the Monge de Montaudon around 1195. The Monge\nplayfully insults Guilhem as a \"bad [[joglar]]\" who always wears old clothes and\nwhose lady has thirty lovers. The earliest reference to a W. Ademars, a petty\nnoble of the GÃ©vaudan, occurs in 1192, though this figure, who (variously as\nAdemars or Azemars) appears in documents until 1217, cannot be definitively\nidentified with the troubadour. Aubrey, 20.\n\n\nOne of Guilhem's more famous pieces is Non pot esser sofert ni atendut, a\nsensuous canso of courtly love wherein he is wishing that his lady's husband\nwould go far away. It has presented a riddle for its dating through references\nto two Spanish kings: a rey Ferrans (\"king Ferdinand\") and reis N'Amfos, cui\ndopton li masmut / e.l mieiller coms de la crestiantat (\"king Don Alfonso, whom\nthe Almohads fear / and the greatest count in Christendom\"). Ferrans may be\neither Ferdinand II of LeÃ³n (died 1188) or Ferdinand III of Castile (began\nreigning in 1217), both of whom present difficulties because their reigns lie\noutside the usual dating of Guilhem's career. The Alfonso could be Alfonso II of\nAragon (contemporary with Ferdinand II), who was also the Count of Barcelona. It\ncould also be Alfonso IX of LeÃ³n, Ferdinand II's successor, whose kingdom lay\nabout as far away as Guilhem coul possibly hope to send his lover's husband; or\nAlfonso VIII of Castile, whose exploits against the Almohads culminated in the\ndefinitive victory at Las Navas in 1212. Since Guilhem wrote a poem sometime\nbetween 1215 and 1217 in which he referred to Raymond VI of Toulouse as En\nRaimon, mon seigner (\"Lord Raymond, my lord\"), it has also be posited that the\nmieiller coms referred to in the previous work is Raymond, who was with Alfonso\nat Las Navas in 1212. Guilhem may thus have had in mind the events of Las Navas\nand been writing at a time after Ferdinand III's succession. Guilhem may have\neven been at Las Navas with Raymond.\n\nGuilhem's poetry is in general light, easy-going, and characterised by irony.\nLike Peire Raimon, his contemporary at the court of Raymond VI of Toulouse, he\nseems to have been influenced by (and perhaps had an influence on) Arnaut\nDaniel. Guilhem's lone surviving piece of music is neumatic in texture and\nmotivic in phrasing. Aubrey, 229.\n\nIn his primary love songs, Guilhem praises two ladies, one from Albi (Na Bona\nNasques, a pet name) and another from Narbonne (Beatriz, perhaps her real name).\nDespite this, Guilhem has been accused of misogyny for his poem El temps\nd'estui, qan par la flors el bruoill. His love song Ben for'oimais sazos e locs\nis written as a message to his lover to be delivered by her porter, who is\nstrictly warned to follow through. In his only sirventes, Ieu ai ja vista manhta\nrey, Guilhem moralises in a slightly Marcabrunian fashion on how loyal and\ngenerous suitors are rejected in favour \"fools and misers\".\n","linknr":146,"url":"Guilhem_Ademar","recorded":1375077345,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Guilhem_Ademar&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Guilhem_Ademar&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:BnF_ms._12473_fol._88_-_Guilhem_Ademar_(1).jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5d/BnF_ms._12473_fol._88_-_Guilhem_Ademar_%281%29.jpg/170px-BnF_ms._12473_fol._88_-_Guilhem_Ademar_%281%29.jpg","/wiki/File:BnF_ms._12473_fol._88_-_Guilhem_Ademar_(1).jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Lombardy","/wiki/Chansonnier","/wiki/Help:IPA","/wiki/Troubadour","/wiki/G%C3%A9vaudan","/wiki/Albi","/wiki/Toulouse","/wiki/Narbonne","/wiki/Spain","/wiki/Monge_de_Montaudon","/wiki/Holy_orders","/wiki/Canso_(song)","/wiki/Sirventes","/wiki/Partimen","/wiki/Eble_d%27Ussel","/wiki/Arnaut_Daniel","/wiki/Vida_(Occitan_literary_form)","/wiki/Meyrueis","#cite_note-egan-1","/wiki/Minstrel","#cite_note-egan-1","/wiki/Order_of_Grandmont","/wiki/Monge_de_Montaudon","/wiki/Joglar","#cite_note-aubrey20-2","/wiki/File:BnF_ms._854_fol._104_-_Guilhem_Ademar_(1).jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/84/BnF_ms._854_fol._104_-_Guilhem_Ademar_%281%29.jpg/170px-BnF_ms._854_fol._104_-_Guilhem_Ademar_%281%29.jpg","/wiki/File:BnF_ms._854_fol._104_-_Guilhem_Ademar_(1).jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Courtly_love","/wiki/Almohads","/wiki/Christendom","/wiki/Ferdinand_II_of_Le%C3%B3n","/wiki/Ferdinand_III_of_Castile","/wiki/Alfonso_II_of_Aragon","/wiki/Count_of_Barcelona","/wiki/Alfonso_IX_of_Le%C3%B3n","/wiki/Alfonso_VIII_of_Castile","/wiki/Battle_of_Las_Navas_de_Tolosa","/wiki/Raymond_VI_of_Toulouse","/wiki/Trobar_leu","/wiki/Irony","/wiki/Peire_Raimon_de_Tolosa","/wiki/Neumatic","/wiki/Motivic","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Albi","/wiki/Narbonne","/wiki/Misogyny","/wiki/Porter_(doorkeeper)","/wiki/Marcabru","/w/index.php?title=Guilhem_Ademar&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-egan_1-0","#cite_ref-egan_1-1","#cite_ref-aubrey20_2-0","#cite_ref-3","/w/index.php?title=Guilhem_Ademar&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0253213894","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0824094379","/wiki/Mart%C3%ADn_de_Riquer","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/160882415","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Guilhem_Ademar&oldid=565317747","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Medieval_composers","/wiki/Category:Medieval_poets","/wiki/Category:Occitan_poets","/wiki/Category:Troubadours","/wiki/Category:Reconquista","/wiki/Category:12th-century_births","/wiki/Category:13th-century_deaths","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Guilhem+Ademar&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Guilhem+Ademar","/wiki/Guilhem_Ademar","/wiki/Talk:Guilhem_Ademar","#","/wiki/Guilhem_Ademar","/w/index.php?title=Guilhem_Ademar&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Guilhem_Ademar&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Guilhem_Ademar","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Guilhem_Ademar","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Guilhem_Ademar&oldid=565317747","/w/index.php?title=Guilhem_Ademar&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1778227","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Guilhem_Ademar&id=565317747","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Guilhem+Ademar","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&artt
