That genome is transcribed to produce RNAs, which are\nnecessary for the function of the organism. Some RNA is processed by splicing to\nremove introns, leaving the exons in the mature messenger RNA (mRNA). The mature\nmRNA may then be translated by the ribosome into protein.\n","linknr":166,"url":"GDNA","recorded":1362670840,"links":15,"instances":["genetics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["DNA"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/DNA_stub.png/40px-DNA_stub.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["transcription","genetics"]],"members":["transcription"],"related":["DNA","Plasmid","Genome","Transcription_(genetics)","RNA","RNA_splicing","Introns","Exons","MRNA","Ribosome","Protein"]}
