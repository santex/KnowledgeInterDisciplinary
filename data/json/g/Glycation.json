{"cursor":"8074","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Glycation' (sometimes called non-enzymatic glycosylation) is the result of\ntypically covalent bonding of a protein or lipid molecule with a sugar molecule,\nsuch as fructose or glucose, without the controlling action of an enzyme. All\nblood sugars are reducing molecules. Glycation may occur either inside the body\n(endogenous glycation) or outside the body (exogenous glycation). Enzyme-\ncontrolled addition of sugars to protein or lipid molecules is termed\nglycosylation; glycation is a haphazard process that impairs the functioning of\nbiomolecules, whereas glycosylation occurs at defined sites on the target\nmolecule and is required in order for the molecule to function. Much of the\nearly laboratory research work on fructose glycations used inaccurate assay\ntechniques that led to drastic underestimation of the importance of fructose in\nglycation.\n","linknr":196,"url":"Glycation","recorded":1362372301,"links":25,"instances":["anatomy"],"pdf":["http://web.archive.org/web/20061023013648/http://www.alteon.com/scientific_publications/role/Vlassara.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20061023013648/http://www.alteon.com/scientific_publications/role/Vlassara.pdf"],"categories":["Carbohydrates","Posttranslational modification","Aging processes"],"headings":["Exogenous","Endogenous","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["lens","anatomy"]],"members":["lens"],"related":["Glycosylation","Protein","Lipid","Molecule","Fructose","Glucose","Enzyme","Blood_sugar","Reducing_agent","Glycosylation","Advanced_Glycation_Endproduct","Maillard_reaction","French_fries","Acrylamide","Carcinogen","Glucose","Fructose","Galactose","Amadori_product","Schiff_base","Maillard_reaction","Advanced_glycation_endproduct","Cardiovascular_disease","Alzheimer's_disease","Cancer","Peripheral_neuropathy","Deafness","Hydrogen_peroxide","Diabetes","Glycated_hemoglobin","HbA1c","Crystallin","Lens_(anatomy)","Cornea","Retina","Beta_cell","Advanced_glycation_end-product","Alagebrium","Fructose","Galactose","Glucose","Glycosylation"]}
