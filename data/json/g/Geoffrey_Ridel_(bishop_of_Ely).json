Fryde, et al. Handbook of British Chronology\np. 84\n\nRidel was probably the great-nephew of Geoffrey Ridel, who died in 1120 and was\na royal justice. He was a royal clerk by about 1156, when he first starts\nwitnessing charters. Duggan\n\"[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/23618 Ridel, Geoffrey (d. 1189)]\" Oxford\nDictionary of National Biography He was a king's clerk before he was\nArchdeacon of Canterbury, which office he held by March 1163. [http://british-\nhistory.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=33855 British History Online Archdeacons of\nCanterbury] He performed the duties of the chancellor's office after\nThomas Becket's resignation of the office, but no documents explicitly name him\nto the office. Warren Henry II p. 307 He also served\nas a royal judge. Barlow English Church 1066â1154 p.\n256 By 1165, Ridel was a baron of the Exchequer.\n\nDuring the controversy between King Henry II of England and Archbishop Thomas\nBecket, Ridel supported the king. Bartlett England Under\nthe Norman and Angevin Kings p. 401 Ridel was one of the persons whom the\nConstitutions of Clarendon were addressed to, along with Richard de Luci and\nRichard of Ilchester. Knowles, et al. \"Henry II's\nSupplement\" English Historical Review p. 759 Ridel went to Rome in 1164 to\nrepresent the king before the papal curia, and in 1166 opposed Becket once more.\nBy 1169 he was urging King Louis VII of France to no longer give refuge to\nBecket. Becket's supporters called Ridel the \"archidiabolus\", Warren Henry II p. 535 or \"our archdevil\", a play on the\noffice of archdeacon which Ridel held. Ridel also urged King Henry's son, Henry\nthe Young King, to refuse to see the archbishop in 1170, telling the prince that\nBecket wished to disinherit the prince.\n\nAfter the controversy was resolved, Ridel was rewarded with a bishopric. Poole Domesday Book to Magna Carta p. 220 He was elected to\nthe see of Ely in late April 1173 and consecrated on 6 October 1174 Fryde, et al. Handbook of British Chronology p. 244 at\nCanterbury. For a number of years previous to his election he had\nbeen the custodian of the see, and had received the episcopal revenues. He resigned the chancellorship when he became a bishop. Huscroft Ruling England p. 191 He continued to be\ninvolved in governmental affairs, attending councils and escorting King Henry\nII's daughter Joanna to Provence when the princess was sent to Sicily to marry\nKing William II of Sicily. He also continued to hold the office of baron of the\nexchequer at least as late as 1185.\n\nRidel died on either 20 or 21 August 1189.
