He traveled extensively, exposing himself to a wide\nvariety of medical theories and discoveries before settling in Rome, where he\nserved prominent members of Roman society and eventually was given the position\nof personal physician to several emperors.\n\nGalen's understanding of anatomy and medicine was principally influenced by the\nthen-current theory of humorism, as advanced by many ancient Greek physicians\nsuch as Hippocrates. His theories dominated and influenced Western medical\nscience for nearly two millennia. His anatomical reports, based mainly on\ndissection of monkeys, especially the Barbary Macaque, and pigs, remained\nuncontested until 1543, when printed descriptions and illustrations of human\ndissections were published in the seminal work [[De humani corporis fabrica]] by\nAndreas Vesalius {{cite book |author=Andreas Vesalius\n|title=De humani corporis fabrica, Libri VII |publisher=Johannes Oporinus\n|location=Basel, Switzerland |language=Latin |year=1543\n|url=http://vesalius.northwestern.edu/ |accessdate=7 August\n2010}} O'Malley, C., Andreas Vesalius of Brussels, 1514â1564,\nBerkeley: University of California Press where Galen's physiological\ntheory was accommodated to these new observations.
