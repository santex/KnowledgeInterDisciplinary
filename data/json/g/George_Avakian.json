His younger brother\nwas the photographer and filmmaker Aram Avakian (1926â1987). The elder Avakian\nattended Yale University, and became an avid collector and fan of jazz music.\nWhile still at Yale he was responsible for the first reissues Columbia put out\naround 1940, discovering some unissued Louis Armstrong masters from his Hot Five\nand Hot Seven period in the process. He later produced some of Armstrong's most\nimportant albums of the traditional jazz revival era, including [[Louis\nArmstrong Plays W. C. Handy]]. His annotations were noted for the education they\nprovided to their listeners. To expand on this concept, in 1946, Avakian started\na course in jazz history at Columbia University.\n\nHis long tenure at Columbia Records culminated in his becoming responsible for\nthe Popular Music and International divisions. During that time, Avakian\nintroduced the LP record format created by Columbia engineers and produced the\nindustry's first 100 long-playing discs of popular music and jazz. He also\nproduced the first live LPâBenny Goodmanâs 1938 Carnegie Hall concert.\n\nWhile at Columbia, Avakian signed and produced Dave Brubeck, Miles Davis,\nLouis Armstrong, Johnny Mathis, Rita Reys, and Erroll Garner to the label,\namong others. In 1959 he was hired as one of the founding A&R managers for the\nnewly-established Warner Bros. Records and also worked as a producer for RCA\nVictor. In 1960-61 he produced recordings by Bill Haley & His Comets for\nWarner Bros. Records. Additionally, he signed\n[http://www.bobnewhart.com/index.cfm Bob Newhart], producing the first comedy\nalbum to win a Best Album Grammy Award. In 1962 he was responsible for\norganizing Benny Goodman's successful tour of the USSR.\n\nFrom about 1970 to 1974, he was the manager of Keith Jarrett; before this, he\nmanaged the Charles Lloyd Quartet of which Jarrett was a member. After this, he\nlargely retired from the record business and bred racehorses. Avakian bred\nchampion pacer [http://www.alabar.com.au/Stallions/Australia/PresidentialBall/t-\nabid/75/Default.aspx Presidential Ball].\n\nHe is a founding officer of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences\n(presenters of the Grammy Awards). His awards over the past years include:\n*2011 â Added to the ASCAP Jazz Wall of Fame as a Living Legend Giant of\nJazz *2010 â National Endowments for the Arts AB Spellman Jazz Advocacy\nAward. The nations highest honor in Jazz for his work as a Producer, Manager,\nCritic, Jazz Historian and Educator.\n* 2009 â The Trustees Lifetime Achievement Award (Grammy) from the National\n  Association of Recording Arts and Sciences for contributions to the music\n  industry worldwide.\n* 2008 â France awarded the rank of Commandeur des Arts et Lettres in\n  recognition of his significant contributions to the arts\n* 2006 â Europeâs prestigious jazz award, the Django dâOr\n* 2000 â A Lifetime Achievement award from Down Beat Magazine\n* 1990 â The former Soviet Unionâs highest decoration, the Order of Lenin\n* 1984 â Knighthood from the Knights of Malta\n\nUpon seeing the original cover of his album [[Miles Ahead]], which featured a\nphoto of a young white woman aboard a sailboat, Miles Davis is reported to have\nsaid: \"Why'd you put that white bitch on there?\" {{cite web\n|url=http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Miles_Davis |title=Miles Davis Wikiquote Page\n}} The cover, which had been chosen by Avakian while he was working at Columbia,\nwas subsequently changed.\n\nAvakian is married to violinist Anahid Ajemian, and the two, together with\nAjemian's pianist sister Maro Ajemian, were crucial in helping classical\ncomposer Alan Hovhaness achieve his international breakthrough in the 1950s,\nthrough concert performances and through Avakian securing numerous LP\nrecordings. The Avakians have three children: Maro, Anahid and Gregory.\n","linknr":153,"url":"George_Avakian","recorded":1375058534,"links":["/w/index.php?title=George_Avakian&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=George_Avakian&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:George_Avakian_(Gottlieb_00371).jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/George_Avakian_%28Gottlieb_00371%29.jpg/220px-George_Avakian_%28Gottlieb_00371%29.jpg","/wiki/William_P._Gottlieb","/wiki/Armavir,_Russia","/wiki/Russian_Soviet_Federative_Socialist_Republic","/wiki/Music_genre","/wiki/Jazz","/wiki/Record_producer","/wiki/Record_label","/wiki/Columbia_Records","/wiki/Warner_Bros._Records","/wiki/RCA_Victor","/wiki/Miles_Davis","/wiki/File:George_Avakian_Hardrock_2Aug07.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/22/George_Avakian_Hardrock_2Aug07.jpg/200px-George_Avakian_Hardrock_2Aug07.jpg","/wiki/File:George_Avakian_Hardrock_2Aug07.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Armenian_language","/wiki/Russian_language","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/Record_producer","/wiki/Columbia_Records","/wiki/Miles_Davis","/wiki/Jazz","/wiki/Armenians","/wiki/Aram_Avakian","/wiki/Yale_University","/wiki/Jazz","/wiki/Louis_Armstrong","/wiki/Louis_Armstrong_and_his_Hot_Five","/wiki/Louis_Armstrong_and_his_Hot_Seven","/wiki/Louis_Armstrong_Plays_W._C._Handy","/wiki/Columbia_Records","/wiki/Benny_Goodman","/wiki/Dave_Brubeck","/wiki/Miles_Davis","/wiki/Louis_Armstrong","/wiki/Johnny_Mathis","/wiki/Rita_Reys","/wiki/Erroll_Garner","/wiki/Warner_Bros._Records","/wiki/RCA_Victor","/wiki/Bill_Haley_%26_His_Comets","/wiki/Warner_Bros._Records","http://www.bobnewhart.com/index.cfm","/wiki/Benny_Goodman","/wiki/Soviet_Union","/wiki/Keith_Jarrett","/w/index.php?title=Charles_Lloyd_Quartet&action=edit&redlink=1","http://www.alabar.com.au/Stallions/Australia/PresidentialBall/tabid/75/Default.aspx","/wiki/National_Academy_of_Recording_Arts_and_Sciences","/wiki/Grammy","/wiki/Miles_Ahead","/wiki/Miles_Davis","http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Miles_Davis","/wiki/Anahid_Ajemian","/wiki/Maro_Ajemian","/wiki/Alan_Hovhaness","/w/index.php?title=George_Avakian&action=edit&section=1","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:George_Avakian","http://www.cilicia.com/armo_article_george_avakian.html","http://www.jazzwax.com/2010/03/interview-george-avakian-part-1.html","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=George_Avakian&oldid=566100051","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1919_births","/wiki/Category:Soviet_emigrants_to_the_United_States","/wiki/Category:American_record_producers","/wiki/Category:American_people_of_Armenian_descent","/wiki/Category:Living_people","/wiki/Category:Grammy_Award-winning_artists","/wiki/Category:Soviet_Armenians","/wiki/Category:People_from_Armavir,_Russia","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_hCards","/wiki/Category:Articles_containing_Armenian-language_text","/wiki/Category:Articles_containing_Russian-language_text","/wiki/Category:Commons_category_template_with_no_category_set","/wiki/Category:Commons_category_with_page_title_same_as_on_Wikidata","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=George+Avakian&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=George+Avakian","/wiki/George_Avakian","/wiki/Talk:George_Avakian","#","/wiki/George_Avakian","/w/index.php?title=George_Avakian&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=George_Avakian&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us"
