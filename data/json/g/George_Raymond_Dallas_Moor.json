Son of William Henry Moor (Auditor-General,\nTransvaal, retired) and Mrs. Moor, and nephew of the late Sir Ralph Moor,\nformerly High Commissioner for Southern Nigeria. He was educated at Cheltenham\nCollege, commissioned into the 3rd Battalion the Hampshire Regiment in October\n1914, and was granted a Regular Commission on 1 August 1915.\n\nAfter six months' training in England and Egypt, he went with the 2nd\nBattalion to the Dardanelles, and was at the landing at V Beach at Gallipoli\non 25 April 1915.\n\nHis V.C. decoration was gazetted on the 24th July, 1915, when he was only 18\nyears of age.\n\n\"For most conspicuous bravery and resource on the 5th June, 1915, during\noperations South of Krithia, Dardenelles. When a detachment of a battalion on\nhis left, which had lost all its officers, was rapidly retiring before a heavy\nTurkish attack, 2nd Lieutenant Moor immediately grasping the danger to the\nremainder of the line, dashed back some two hundred yards, stemmed the\nretirement, led back the men, and recaptured the lost trench. This young officer\nwho only joined the Army in October, 1914, by his personal bravery and presence\nof mind saved a dangerous situation.\"\n\nHe was invalided home soon afterwards suffering from dysentery. After recovering\nhe joined the 1st Battalion in France and was badly wounded in the arm. He\nreturned to England, and before regaining the use of his arm-was appointed Aide-de-\nCamp (A.D.C.) to Major-General W. de L. 'Williams, C.B ., C.M.G., D.S.O., in\nFrance, where he gained the M.C. and Bar. Moor was promoted Lieutenant on 30\nOctober 1916.\n\nMilitary Cross citation: (gazetted 2 December 1918) \"Lieutenant George Raymond\nDallas Moor, V.C., Hampshire Regiment. For conspicuous gallantry and skill. He\ncarried out a daylight reconnaissance all along the divisional front in face of\nheavy machine-gun fire at close range, in many places well in front of our\nforemost posts.\"\n\nBar to Military Cross (gazetted 29 July 1919) \"On October 20th, 1918, near to\nPijpestraat, the vanguard commander was wounded and unable to carry on. Owing to\nheavy shelling and machine-gun fire, the vanguard came to a standstill. Lieut.\nMoor, Acting General Staff Officer, who was reconnoitring the front, noticed\nthis ; he immediately took charge, and by his fearless example and skilful\nleading continued the advance until the objective was reached. He has a positive\ncontempt for danger, and distinguishes himself on every occasion.\"\n\nLieutenant-General Sir Beauvoir de Lisle, K.C.B., K.C.M.G., D.S.O., in a\nnarrative of the V.C. action, said, \"I have often quoted this young Officer as\nbeing one of the bravest men I have met in this War.\"\n\nMoor died of Spanish Influenza at Mouvaux, France, on 3 November 1918. He is\nburied in the Y Farm Military Cemetery, Bois-Grenier, which is cared for by the\nCommonwealth War Graves Commission.
