The service\nwas started in 1995 as Deja News, and was transitioned to Google Groups after a\nFebruary 2001 buyout.\n\nMembership in Google Groups is free of charge and many groups are anonymous.\nUsers can find discussion groups related to their interests and participate in\nthreaded conversations, either through a web interface or by e-mail. They can\nalso start new groups, which are inaccessible by NNTP and act more like mailing\nlists. Google Groups also includes an archive of Usenet newsgroup\npostings dating back to 1981 and supports reading and posting to\nUsenet groups. Users can also set up mailing list archives for e-mail\nlists that are hosted elsewhere.\n","linknr":487,"url":"Google_Groups","recorded":1362477192,"links":41,"instances":["programming_language"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Electronic mailing lists","Google services","Usenet free posting","Usenet clients","Internet forums"],"headings":["History","Privacy","Criticism","Blocking","See also","Notes","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/77/Logo_Google_groups.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a0/Google-Groups.png/200px-Google-Groups.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/70/Deja_News_logo.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/82/Deja-dot-com-logo.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["java","programming_language"]],"members":["java"],"related":["Google","Cross-platform","Java_(programming_language)","Newsgroup","Electronic_mailing_lists","Google","Internet_forum","Usenet","Threaded_discussion","Mailing_list","Archive","Usenet","Steve_Madere","Austin,_Texas","Search_engine","Online","World_Wide_Web","Newsgroup","Privacy","X-No-Archive","Copyright","Scientology_vs._the_Internet","Internet_forum","EBay","Half.com","University_of_Western_Ontario","Henry_Spencer","University_of_Toronto","AOL","The_Guardian","Adnan_Oktar","Turkey","Islam","GroupSpaces","MSN_Groups","Windows_Live_Groups","Yahoo!_Groups"]}
