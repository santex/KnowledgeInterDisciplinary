steam turbine generator]] Generator in Zwevegem, West\n Flanders, Belgium]] made in Budapest, Hungary, in the power generating hall of\n a hydroelectric station]] In electricity generation, an 'electric generator' is\n a device that converts mechanical energy to electrical energy. A generator\n forces electric current to flow through an external circuit. The source of\n mechanical energy may be a reciprocating or turbine steam engine, water falling\n through a turbine or waterwheel, an internal combustion engine, a wind turbine,\n a hand crank, compressed air, or any other source of mechanical energy.\n Generators provide nearly all of the power for electric power grids.\n\nThe reverse conversion of electrical energy into mechanical energy is done by an\nelectric motor, and motors and generators have many similarities. Many motors\ncan be mechanically driven to generate electricity and frequently make\nacceptable generators.\n","title":"Electric%20generator","headings":["History","Electromagnetic generators","Electrostatic generator","Terminology","Equivalent circuit","Vehicle-mounted generators","Engine-generator","Human powered electrical generators","Linear electric generator","Tachogenerator","See also","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["4: Wind_turbine","4: Electric_motor","4: Direct_current","4: Alternator","4: Alternating_current","3: Electrostatic_generator","3: Voltage","3: Faraday's_law_of_induction","2: Electricity","2: Electrostatic","2: Electrostatic_induction","2: Triboelectric_effect","2: Michael_Faraday","2: Magnet","2: Electromagnetic_induction","2: Hippolyte_Pixii","2: Rotary_converter","2: Singly_fed_electric_machine","2: Electrical_generator","2: Induction_motor","2: Doubly_fed_electric_machine","2: Brushless_wound-rotor_doubly_fed_electric_machine","2: Stator","2: Hybrid_vehicle","2: Wave_power","1: Zwevegem","1: West_Flanders","1: Belgium","1: Budapest","1: Hungary","1: Hydroelectric","1: Electricity_generation","1: Mechanical_energy","1: Electrical_energy","1: Electrical_circuit","1: Turbine","1: Steam_engine","1: Hydropower","1: Internal_combustion_engine","1: Compressed_air","1: Electric_power_grid","1: Magnetism","1: Electric_current","1: Electric_charge","1: Electrical_insulation","1: Wimshurst_machine","1: Van_de_Graaff_generator","1: Anyos_Jedlik","1: Jedlik's_dynamo","1: Ernst_Werner_von_Siemens","1: Charles_Wheatstone","1: Self-excitation","1: Electromotive_force","1: Magnetic_flux","1: Faraday_disk","1: Homopolar_generator","1: Copper","1: Synchronous_motor","1: James_Edward_Henry_Gordon","1: Lord_Kelvin","1: Sebastian_Ziani_de_Ferranti","1: Hertz","1: Nikola_Tesla","1: Polyphase_system","1: Transformer","1: Incandescent_lamp","1: Fluorescent_lamp","1: Rankine_cycle","1: Power_plant","1: Soviet_Union","1: Topping_cycle","1: Combined_cycle","1: Gas_turbines","1: Renewable_energy","1: Electrical_polarity","1: Amperes","1: Remanent_magnetism","1: Power_outage","1: Islanding","1: Black_start","1: High_voltage","1: Continuous_current","1: Phenomenon","1: Mechanical_work","1: Electric_energy","1: Electrical_charge","1: Electric_potential","1: Electrode","1: Inventor","1: James_Wimshurst","1: Spark_gap","1: Robert_J._Van_de_Graaff","1: Potential_difference","1: Capacitor","1: Electrical_machine","1: Field_coil","1: Slip_ring","1: Rectifier","1: Car_battery","1: Power_steering","1: Air_conditioning","1: Starter_motor","1: Diesel_engine","1: Rare_earth_element","1: Magneto","1: Bicycle_lighting","1: Bottle_dynamo","1: Rare-earth_magnet","1: Hub_dynamo","1: Light-emitting_diode","1: Energy_conversion_efficiency","1: Propeller","1: Impeller","1: Micropower","1: Engine","1: Petrol","1: DIY","1: Clockwork_radio","1: Australian_outback","1: School_of_the_Air","1: Solenoid","1: Faraday_flashlight","1: Tachometer","1: Diesel_generator","1: Goodness_factor","1: Mechanical_generator","1: Radioisotope_thermoelectric_generator","1: Solar_cell","1: Superconducting_electric_machine","1: Thermogenerator","1: Tidal_generator","1: Tidal_power","1: Turbine_hall"]}
