{"cursor":"1597","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'Gun Stabilizer' is a device intended to facilitate aiming a gun by\ncompensating for the motion of the platform on which the gun is mounted. The\nprimary armament of all US tanks was stabilized at least by 1944. Popular\nScience, September 1944, p. 82 Some attemp was made to stabilize Soviet\ntank guns as early as 1938. Chris Bishop, The Encyclopedia of Weapons of\nWWII, p. 37 (2002) The Bradley Fighting Vehicle main gun is also\nstabilized. (The defensive guns of the B-29 bomber were also electronically\naimed, though platform rotation was not the main problem for them.) This was an\nimportant factor in World War II, because it allowed much greater accuracy while\nmoving and, in addition to allowing a faster average speed, the survivability of\na vehicle in battle depends on its unpredictable motion.\n\nThe mechanism usually includes an angular reference device such as a mechanical\nor optical gyro and servo mechanisms. In the case of a tank, there is one servo\nstabilizing the turret and another for the elevation of the gun. The aiming is\nthen done by control input to the mechanism, rather than directly on the gun.\nThe control mechanism usually has other functions, such as applying super-\nelevation and leading the target according to its velocity, making it a Fire-\ncontrol system, and some guns are entirely automatic.\n","linknr":80,"url":"Gun_stabilizer","recorded":1362562490,"links":10,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Artillery"],"headings":["External links","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Bradley_Fighting_Vehicle","B-29","World_War_II","Survivability","Gyroscope","Servomechanism","Fire-control_system"]}
