Gaucher's disease is the most common of\nthe lysosomal storage diseases. It is a form of\nsphingolipidosis (a subgroup of lysosomal storage diseases), as it involves\ndysfunctional metabolism of sphingolipids. The disorder is characterized by\nbruising, fatigue, anemia, low blood platelets, and enlargement of the liver and\nspleen. It is caused by a hereditary deficiency of the enzyme\nglucocerebrosidase. The enzyme acts on the fatty acid glucosylceramide. When the\nenzyme is defective, glucosylceramide accumulates, particularly in white blood\ncells, most often macrophages (mononuclear leukocytes). Glucosylceramidase can\ncollect in the spleen, liver, kidneys, lungs, brain and bone marrow.\n\nSymptoms may include enlarged spleen and liver, liver malfunction, skeletal\ndisorders and bone lesions that may be painful, severe neurologic complications,\nswelling of lymph nodes and (occasionally) adjacent joints, distended abdomen, a\nbrownish tint to the skin, anemia, low blood platelets and yellow fatty deposits\non the white of the eye (sclera). Persons affected most seriously may also be\nmore susceptible to infection. Some forms of Gaucher's disease may be treated\nwith enzyme replacement therapy.\n\nThe disease is caused by a recessive mutation in a gene located on chromosome 1\nand affects both males and females. About 1 in 100 people in the United States\nare carriers of the most common type of Gaucher disease. The carrier rate among\nAshkenazi Jews is 8.9% while the birth incidence is 1 in 450.\n\nThe disease is named after the French doctor Philippe Gaucher, who originally\ndescribed it in 1882.\n","linknr":483,"url":"Gaucher's_disease","recorded":1362504383,"links":39,"instances":["genetics","epidemiology","human"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Autosomal recessive disorders","Rare diseases","Lipid storage disorders","Ashkenazi Jews topics","Skin conditions resulting from errors in metabolism"],"headings":["Classification","Signs and symptoms","Pathophysiology","Genetics","Diagnosis","Treatment","Epidemiology","History","Gallery","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e2/Acid_beta_glucosidase.png/230px-Acid_beta_glucosidase.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/82/Gaucher_disease_-_very_high_mag.jpg/220px-Gaucher_disease_-_very_high_mag.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2a/Sphingolipidoses.svg/120px-Sphingolipidoses.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/47/Sound-icon.svg/45px-Sound-icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/47/Sound-icon.svg/15px-Sound-icon.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["dominance","genetics"],["chromosome_1","human"],["incidence","epidemiology"]],"members":["dominance","incidence","chromosome_1"],"related":["ILDS","Lysosomal_storage_disease","Sphingolipidosis","Sphingolipids","Glucocerebrosidase","Mononuclear_leukocytes","Spleen","Kidney","Human_lung","Human_brain","List_of_skeletal_disorders","Neurology","Lymph_node","Anemia","Platelet","Sclera","Dominance_(genetics)","Chromosome_1_(human)","Genetic_carrier","Ashkenazi_Jews","Eponym","Philippe_Gaucher","Ashkenazi_Jews","Hepatomegaly","Splenomegaly","Hepatosplenomegaly","Leukopenia","Bruise","Spasticity","Seizure","Phenotypes","Hepatomegaly","Splenomegaly","Hypersplenism","Pancytopenia","Anemia","Neutropenia","Leukopenia","Thrombocytopenia","Infection","Bleeding","Cirrhosis","Neurology","Myoclonus","Osteoporosis","Femur","Erlenmeyer_flask","Pigmentation","Housekeeping_gene","Chromosome","Enzyme","Kilodalton","Amino_acid","Glucosylceramide","Cell_membrane","Red_blood_cell","White_blood_cell","Macrophage","Light_microscopy","Lipid","Myelin_sheath","Phenotype","Heterozygote","Parkinson's_disease","United_States","Non-Hodgkin_lymphoma","Melanoma","Pancreatic_cancer","Autosomal_recessive","Genetic_counseling","Genetic_testing","Homozygote","Ashkenazi","Allele","Lysosome","Sweden","Norrbotten","H&E_stain","Genetic_test","Alkaline_phosphatase","Angiotensin-converting_enzyme","Immunoglobulin","Acid_phosphatase","Enzyme_replacement_treatment","Intravenous","Recombinant_DNA","Imiglucerase","Liver","Orphan_drug","Velaglucerase_alfa","Food_and_Drug_Administration","Taliglucerase_alfa","Bone_marrow_transplantation","Monocyte","Splenectomy","Blood_transfusion","Replacement_joint","Antibiotic","Antiepileptic","Bisphosphonate","Liver_transplant","Gene_therapy","Pharmacological_chaperone","Miglustat","Isofagomine_tartrate","Incidence_(epidemiology)","Ashkenazi_Jew","Norrbotten","Philippe_Gaucher","Alglucerase","Imiglucerase","Niemann–Pick_disease","Fabry_disease","Tay–Sachs_disease","Krabbe_disease","Metachromatic_leukodystrophy","Medical_genetics_of_Ashkenazi_Jews","List_of_radiographic_findings_associated_with_cutaneous_conditions"]}
