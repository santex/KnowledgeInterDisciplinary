      "text" : "A 'generic drug' (generic drugs, short: generics) is a drug defined as \"a drug\nproduct that is comparable to brand/reference listed drug product in dosage\nform, strength, route of administration, quality and performance\ncharacteristics, and intended use.\"<ref>[http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/Dev-\nelopmentApprovalProcess/SmallBusinessAssistance/ucm127615.pdf \"Generic Drugs\"],\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research, U.S. Food and Drug Administration</ref>\nIt has also been defined as a term referring to any drug marketed under its\nchemical name without\nadvertising.<ref>[http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=33073\nwww.medterms.com: definition of generic drug]</ref>\n<ref>http://www.genericmedicines.in/</ref>\n\nAlthough they may not be associated with a particular company, generic drugs are\nsubject to the regulations of the governments of countries where they are\ndispensed. Generic drugs are labeled with the name of the manufacturer and the\nadopted name (nonproprietary name) of the drug.\n\nA generic drug must contain the same active ingredients as the original\nformulation. According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), generic\ndrugs are identical or within an acceptable bioequivalent range to the brand-\nname counterpart with respect to pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties.\nBy extension, therefore, generics are considered (by the FDA) identical in dose,\nstrength, route of administration, safety, efficacy, and intended\nuse.<ref></ref> The FDA's use of the word \"identical\" is very much a legal\ninterpretation, and is not literal. In most cases, generic products are\navailable once the patent protections afforded to the original developer have\nexpired. When generic products become available, the market competition often\nleads to substantially lower prices for both the original brand name product and\nthe generic forms. The time it takes a generic drug to appear on the market\nvaries. In the US, drug patents give 20 years of protection.<ref></ref>\n\nPrescriptions may be issued for drugs specifying only the chemical name, rather\nthan a manufacturer's name; such a prescription can be filled with a drug of any\nbrand meeting the specification. For example, a prescription for lansoprazole\ncan be filled with generic lansoprazole, Prevacid, Helicid, Zoton, Inhibitol, or\nMonolitum.\n\nA generic drug of biological type (e.g. monoclonal antibodies), is different to\nchemical drugs because of its biological nature and it is regulated under\nextended set of rules for it; see Biosimilars.\n",
