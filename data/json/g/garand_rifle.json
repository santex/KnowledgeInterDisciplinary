During World War II, the M1 gave U.S.\nforces a distinct advantage in firefights against their Axis enemies, as their\nstandard-issue rifles were slower-firing bolt-action rifles. The M1 continued to\nbe used in large numbers until 1963 and to a lesser degree until 1976. Like its\npredecessor, the M1 originated from the Springfield Armory.\n\nThe M1 is an air-cooled, gas-operated, clip-fed, and semi-automatic shoulder\nweapon. This means that the air cools the barrel; that the power to cock the\nrifle and chamber the succeeding round comes from the expanding gas of the round\nfired previously; that it is loaded by inserting an en-bloc (i.e., it goes into\nthe rifle's action and functions as part of the rifle) metal clip (containing\neight rounds) into the receiver; and that the rifle fires one round each time\nthe trigger is pulled.<ref>U.S. Army Field Manual FM 23.5 (May 1965) U.S. Rifle,\nCaliber .30, M1, p.3</ref> After the eight rounds have been shot the clip\nautomatically ejects causing a \"ping\" noise to occur.\n\nThe M1 was the standard-issue service rifle of the U.S. forces in World War II,\nthe Korean War, and also saw service to a limited extent in the Vietnam War.\nMost M1 rifles were issued to U.S. forces, though many thousands were also lent\nor provided as foreign aid to America's allies. The Garand is still used by\ndrill teams and military honor guards. It is also widely sought by the civilian\npopulation as a hunting rifle, target rifle, and military collectible. Although\nthe name \"Garand\" is frequently pronounced , according to experts and people who\nknew John Garand, the weapon's designer, ('rhymes with \"errand\"') is\npreferred.<ref>Hatcher, Julian.
