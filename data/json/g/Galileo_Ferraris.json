Alternating currents of electricity: their generation, measurement,\ndistribution, and application by Gisbert Kapp, William Stanley, Jr.. Johnston,\n1893. p. 140. [cf., This direction has been first indicated by Professor Galileo\nFerraris, of Turin, some six years ago. Quite independent of Ferraris, the same\ndiscovery was also made by Nikola Tesla, of New York; and since the practical\nimportance of the discovery has been recognized, quite a host of original\ndiscoverers have come forward, each claiming to be the first.] Larned,\nJ.

[cf., At about\nthe same time [1888], Galileo Ferraris, in Italy, and Nikola Tesla, in the\nUnited States, brought out motors operating by systems of alternating currents\ndisplaced from one another in phase by definite amounts and producing what is\nknown as the rotating magnetic field.] The Electrical engineer.\n(1888). London: Biggs & Co. p., 239. [cf., \"[...] new application of the\nalternating current in the production of rotary motion was made known almost\nsimultaneously by two experimenters, Nikola Tesla and Galileo Ferraris, and the\nsubject has attracted general attention from the fact that no commutator or\nconnection of any kind with the armature was required.\"] Ferraris has\npublished an extensive and complete monograph on the experimental results\nobtained with open-circuit transformers of the type designed by the power\nengineers Lucien Gaulard and John Dixon Gibbs.\n","linknr":147,"url":"Galileo_Ferraris","recorded":1362485613,"links":23,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["1847 births","1897 deaths","Italian engineers","Italian physicists","Italian inventors","People from the Province of Vercelli"],"headings":["Biography","Memorials","Publications","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4e/Galileo_Ferraris.jpg/300px-Galileo_Ferraris.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Italy","Physics","Engineering","Alternating_current","Physicist","Electrical_engineer","Rotating_magnetic_field","Induction_motor","Gisbert_Kapp","William_Stanley,_Jr.","Nikola_Tesla","Power_engineer","Lucien_Gaulard","John_Dixon_Gibbs","Rotating_magnetic_field","Alternator","Turin","Nikola_Tesla","Politecnico_di_Torino","Italian_Electrotechnical_Association","Sulle_differenze_di_fase_delle_correnti_e_sulla_dissipazione_di_energia_nei_trasformatori"]}
