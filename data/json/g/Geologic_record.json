According to the\n law of superposition sedimentary and volcanic rock layers are deposited on top\n of each other. They harden over time to become a solidified (competent) rock\n column, that may be intruded by igneous rocks and disrupted by tectonic events\n over time.\n","linknr":314,"url":"Geologic_record","recorded":1362371936,"links":27,"instances":["geology","geology","sediment","geology","geology","geometry","geology","geology","geology","geology"],"pdf":["http://web.archive.org/web/20091229003212/http://www.stratigraphy.org/upload/ISChart2009.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20091229003212/http://www.stratigraphy.org/upload/ISChart2009.pdf"],"categories":["Paleontology","Zoology","Fossils","Historical geology","Geologic time scale","Geochronology","Stratigraphy"],"headings":["Correlating the rock record","Discordant strata example","Lithology vs paleontology","Notes"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/Concordant.jpg/220px-Concordant.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cc/End_of_cobbles.jpg/220px-End_of_cobbles.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a0/Horseshoe_Canyon.jpg/220px-Horseshoe_Canyon.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/Biostratigraphie_usgs.png/220px-Biostratigraphie_usgs.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c8/Dinosaur_Park_Fm.jpg/180px-Dinosaur_Park_Fm.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a0/DeepSiltOffMirabeau.jpg/160px-DeepSiltOffMirabeau.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bb/Tremp_formatie.jpg/180px-Tremp_formatie.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/P%C3%A9ry-Reuchenette_Oxfordian.JPG/90px-P%C3%A9ry-Reuchenette_Oxfordian.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bb/Time-Honored_Rockfall.jpg/180px-Time-Honored_Rockfall.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b9/Ocean_core_sediments_on_the_Polarstern.jpg/180px-Ocean_core_sediments_on_the_Polarstern.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg/16px-Portal-puzzle.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["deposition","sediment"],["competence","geology"],["cross_section","geometry"],["period","geology"],["age","geology"],["fold","geology"],["fault","geology"],["stage","geology"],["series","geology"],["stage","geology"],["stage","geology"],["eon","geology"],["eon","geology"]],"members":["fold","competence","deposition","stage","period","cross_section","age","series","eon","fault"],"related":["San_Sebastián","Spain","Stratigraphy","Paleontology","Natural_sciences","Stratum","Volcanism","Deposition_(sediment)","Weathering","Clay","Sand","Fossil","Climate","Evolution","Law_of_superposition","Sedimentary_rock","Volcanic_rock","Competence_(geology)","Igneous_rock","Tectonic","Drumheller","Alberta","Cross_section_(geometry)","Natural_history","Period_(geology)","Geography","Age_(geology)","Stratum","Weathering","Landform","Geologic_time_scale","Tectonics","Erosion","Weathering","Fold_(geology)","Fault_(geology)","Structural_basin","Biostratigraphy","Geobiology","Paleobiology","Stage_(geology)","Geologic_time_scale","United_States_Geological_Survey","South_Carolina","Virginia","Eocene","Series_(geology)","Stage_(geology)","Correlate","Stage_(geology)","Eonothem","Eon_(geology)","Stratum","Alberta","Canada","Eon_(geology)","Stratum","Colorado_Plateau","New_Orleans","Hurricane_Katrina","London_Avenue_Canal","Limestone","Marl","Clay","Grand_Staircase-Escalante_National_Monument","Quaternary"]}
