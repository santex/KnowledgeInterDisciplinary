Coin (diameter 24 mm) for\n comparison.]]\n\n'Gunpowder', also known since the late 19th century as 'black powder', was the\nfirst chemical explosive and the only one known until the mid-1800s. See\nNitroglycerine#History It is a mixture of sulfur, charcoal, and potassium\nnitrate (saltpetre)âwith the sulfur and charcoal acting as fuels, while the\nsaltpeter works as an oxidizer. Because of its\nburning properties and the amount of heat and gas volume that it generates,\ngunpowder has been widely used as a propellant in firearms and as a pyrotechnic\ncomposition in fireworks.\n\nGunpowder was, according to prevailing academic consensus, discovered in the 9th\ncentury in China, attributed to Chinese alchemists searching for an elixir of\nimmortality. Jack Kelly Gunpowder: Alchemy, Bombards,\nand Pyrotechnics: The History of the Explosive that Changed the World, Perseus\nBooks Group: 2005, ISBN 0465037224, ISBN 9780465037223: pp. 2â5 The\nearliest record of a written formula for gunpowder appears in the 11th century\nSong Dynasty text, [[Wujing Zongyao]]. : \"the earliest\nsurviving formulas for gunpowder can be found in the Wujing zongyao, a military\nwork from around 1040\" This discovery led to the invention of fireworks\nand the earliest gunpowder weapons in China. In the centuries following the\nChinese discovery, gunpowder weapons began appearing in the Arab world, Europe,\nand India. The technology spread from China through the Middle East, and then\ninto Europe. The earliest Western accounts of gunpowder\nappear in texts written by English philosopher Roger Bacon in the 13th\ncentury.\n\nGunpowder is classified as a low explosive because of its relatively slow\ndecomposition rate and consequently low brisance. Low explosives deflagrate\n(i.e., burn) at subsonic speeds, whereas high explosives detonate, producing a\nsupersonic wave. Ignition of the powder packed behind a bullet must generate\nenough pressure to force it from the muzzle at high speed, but not enough to\nrupture the gun barrel. Gunpowder thus makes a good propellant, but is less\nsuitable for shattering rock or fortifications. Gunpowder was widely used to\nfill artillery shells and in mining and civil engineering to blast rock roughly\nuntil the second half of the 19th century, when the first high explosives (nitro-\nexplosives) were discovered. Gunpowder is no longer used in modern explosive\nmilitary warheads, nor is it used as main explosive in mining operations due to\nits cost relative to that of newer alternatives such as ammonium nitrate/fuel\noil (ANFO).\n","linknr":1146,"url":"Gunpowder","recorded":1362482244,"links":112,"instances":["broth","cairo","weapon","medievalist","united_states_coin","gun","indonesia","1258","scale","cartridge","scotland","1531"],"pdf":["http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA454209&Location=U2&doc=GetTRDoc.pdf","http://www.freepyroinfo.com/Pyrotechnic/Pyrotechnic_Books/The_Wizards_Great_Book_of_Absoundite_and_Forbidden_Pyrotechnic_Knowledge.pdf"],"categories":["Gunpowder|*","Chinese
