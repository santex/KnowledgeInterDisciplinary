The term can legitimately refer to\nany form of psychotherapy when delivered in a group format, including Cognitive\nbehavioural therapy or Interpersonal therapy, but it is usually applied to\npsychodynamic group therapy where the group context and group process is\nexplicitly utilised as a mechanism of change by developing, exploring and\nexamining interpersonal relationships within the group. The broader concept of\ngroup [[therapy]] can be taken to include any helping process that takes place\nin a group, including support groups, skills training groups (such as anger\nmanagement, mindfulness, relaxation training or social skills training), and psycho-\neducation groups. The differences between psychodynamic groups, activity groups,\nsupport groups, problem-solving and psycoeducational groups are discussed by\nMontgomery (2002). Montgomery C (2002) Role of dynamic group therapy in\npsychiatry Advances in Psychiatric Treatment, 8(1): 34-41 Other, more\nspecialised forms of group therapy would include non-verbal expressive therapies\nsuch as art therapy, dance therapy, or music therapy.\n","linknr":333,"url":"Group_psychotherapy","recorded":1362890573,"links":41,"instances":["mental_health","philosopher"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Group psychotherapy| *","Group processes"],"headings":["History of group psychotherapy","Therapeutic principles","Settings","Research on effectiveness","See also","Notes","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1d/Grouptherapy.jpg/230px-Grouptherapy.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["fred_newman","philosopher"],["case_management","mental_health"]],"members":["case_management","fred_newman"],"related":["Psychotherapy","Cognitive_behavioural_therapy","Interpersonal_therapy","Group_dynamics","Support_groups","Anger_management","Mindfulness-based_Cognitive_Therapy","Relaxation_technique","Social_skills","Psychoeducation","Expressive_therapy","Art_therapy","Dance_therapy","Music_therapy","Trigant_Burrow","Paul_Schilder","World_War_II","Jacob_L._Moreno","Hyman_Spotnitz","Irvin_Yalom","Psychodrama","S._H._Foulkes","Wilfred_Bion","Transference","Group_Analysis","Institute_of_Group_Analysis","Tavistock_Clinic","Social_Therapy","Lois_Holzman","Fred_Newman_(philosopher)","Unconscious_mind","Transference","Observational_learning","Catharsis","Self-awareness","Milieu_Therapy","Partial_hospitalization","Expressive_therapy","Drama_therapy","Psychodrama","Art_therapy","Music_therapy","Milieu_Therapy","Therapeutic_Community","University_of_Oxford","Projective_psychotherapy","Delusion","Red_Orc's_Rage","Major_depressive_disorder","Meta-analysis","Effect_size","Child_sexual_abuse","Posttraumatic_stress_disorder","Borderline_personality_disorder","Mentalization_based_treatment","Case_management_(mental_health)","Global_Assessment_of_Functioning","Self-help_groups_for_mental_health","Twelve-step_program","Expressive_therapy","Drama_therapy","Family_therapy","Play_therapy","Psychotherapy","Social_Therapy","Milieu_Therapy","Systemic_Constellations","Dance/Movement_Therapy"]}
