This\nprocess usually occurs in the vadose zone below plant roots and is often\nexpressed as a flux to the water table surface. Recharge occurs both naturally\n(through the water cycle) and through anthropogenic processes (i.e., \"artificial\ngroundwater recharge\"), where rainwater and or reclaimed water is routed to the\nsubsurface.\n","linknr":191,"url":"Groundwater_recharge","recorded":1362685750,"links":21,"instances":["hydrology","agriculture","software","earth_sciences"],"pdf":["https://es.ucmerced.edu/Past_Seminars/2008-fall-es-seminar-material/Glynn-Plummer2005.pdf","https://es.ucmerced.edu/Past_Seminars/2008-fall-es-seminar-material/Glynn-Plummer2005.pdf"],"categories":["Aquifers","Hydrology","Land management","Soil physics","Sustainable environmental design","Sustainable gardening","Sustainable technologies","Water","Water and the environment","Water conservation","Water resources management"],"headings":["Processes","Estimation methods","See also","References","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/80/Surface_water_cycle.svg/220px-Surface_water_cycle.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["permeability","earth_sciences"],["infiltration","hydrology"],["hydrus","software"],["infiltration","hydrology"],["hydrology","agriculture"]],"members":["infiltration","hydrology","hydrus","permeability"],"related":["Hydrology","Water","Surface_water","Groundwater","Vadose_zone","Root","Flux","Water_table","Water_cycle","Reclaimed_water","Rain","Snow","Logging","Surface_runoff","Irrigation","Sustainable","Water_abstraction","Aquifer","Groundwater","Surface_runoff","Flooding","Stream_bed","Permeability_(earth_sciences)","International_Water_Management_Institute","Surface_runoff","Evaporation","Transpiration","Evapotranspiration","Infiltration_(hydrology)","Soil_physics","Inert","Isotopic_tracer","Chloride","Numerical_analysis","Source_code","Hydrologic_Evaluation_of_Landfill_Performance","UNSAT-H","SHAW","Weap","MIKE_SHE","HYDRUS_(software)","Climate","Soil","Richards_equation","Vadose_zone","Contour_trenching","Depression_focused_recharge","Drainage","Infiltration_(hydrology)","Hydrology_(agriculture)","Soil_salinity_control","Watertable_control"]}
