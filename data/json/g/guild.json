The earliest types of guild were formed as\nconfraternities of workers. They were organized in a manner something between a\ntrade union, a cartel, and a secret society. They often depended on grants of\nletters patent by a monarch or other authority to enforce the flow of trade to\ntheir self-employed members, and to retain ownership of tools and the supply of\nmaterials. A lasting legacy of traditional guilds are the constructed and used\nas meeting places.\n\n was originally a meeting place for guilds, as well as magistrates' seat and\n town hall.]]\n\nAn important result of the guild framework was the emergence of universities at\nBologna, Paris, and Oxford around the year 1200; they originated as guilds of\nstudents as at Bologna, or of masters as at Paris.<ref>Hastings Rashdall, The\nUniversities of Europe in the Middle Ages: Salerno.
