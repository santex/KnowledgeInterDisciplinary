{"cursor":"142812","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n made of carbon atoms.]] 'Graphene' is a substance composed of pure carbon, with\n atoms arranged in a regular hexagonal pattern similar to graphite, but in a one-\n atom thick sheet. It is very light, with a 1-square-meter sheet weighing only\n 0.77 milligrams.\n\nIt is an allotrope of carbon whose structure is a single planar sheet of sp 2-\nbonded carbon atoms, that are densely packed in a honeycomb crystal lattice. The term graphene was coined as a combination of graphite\nand the suffix -ene by Hanns-Peter Boehm, who\ndescribed single-layer carbon foils in 1962.\nGraphene is most easily visualized as an atomic-scale chicken wire made of\ncarbon atoms and their bonds. The crystalline or \"flake\" form of graphite\nconsists of many graphene sheets stacked together.\n\nThe carbon-carbon bond length in graphene is about 0.142 nanometers.\nGraphene sheets stack to form graphite with an interplanar spacing of\n0.335 nm. Graphene is the basic structural element of some carbon\nallotropes including graphite, charcoal, carbon nanotubes and fullerenes. It can\nalso be considered as an indefinitely large aromatic molecule, the limiting case\nof the family of flat polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.\n\nThere is an analog of graphene composed of silicon called silicene.\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Physics for 2010 was awarded to Andre Geim and Konstantin\nNovoselov at the University of Manchester \"for groundbreaking experiments\nregarding the two-dimensional material\ngraphene\". [http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2010/ Nobel\nFoundation announcement] In 2013, graphene researchers led by Prof. Jari\nKinaret from Sweden's Chalmers University, secured a one-billion-euro grant from\nthe European Union.
