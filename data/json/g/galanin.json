Galanin signaling occurs through three G protein-coupled\nreceptors.\n\nThe functional role of galanin remains largely unknown; however, galanin is\npredominately involved in the modulation and inhibition of action potentials in\nneurons. Galanin has been implicated in many biologically diverse functions,\nincluding: nociception, waking and sleep regulation, cognition, feeding,\nregulation of mood, regulation of blood pressure, it also has roles in\ndevelopment as well as acting as a trophic factor.\nGalanin is linked to a number of diseases including Alzheimer's disease,\nepilepsy as well as depression, eating disorders and cancer. Galanin appears to have\nneuroprotective activity as its biosynthesis is increased 2-10 fold upon axotomy\nin the peripheral nervous system as well as when seizure activity occurs in the\nbrain. It may also promote neurogenesis.\n\nGalanin is predominantly an inhibitory, hyperpolarizing neuropeptide and as such inhibits neurotransmitter release. Galanin\nis often co-localized with classical neurotransmitters such as\nacetylcholine, serotonin, and norepinephrine, and also with other\nneuromodulators such as neuropeptide Y, substance P, and vasoactive\nintestinal peptide.\n","linknr":789,"url":"galanin","recorded":1362513112,"links":22,"instances":["biology","biology","genetics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Neuropeptides"],"headings":["Discovery","Tissue distribution","Structure","Receptors","Clinical characteristics","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/67/PBB_GE_GAL_214240_at_tn.png/250px-PBB_GE_GAL_214240_at_tn.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fb/Yes_check.svg/7px-Yes_check.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fb/Yes_check.svg/7px-Yes_check.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/X_mark.svg/14px-X_mark.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["hyperpolarization","biology"],["homology","biology"],["transcription","genetics"]],"members":["homology","hyperpolarization","transcription"],"related":["Neuropeptide","Gene","G_protein-coupled_receptors","Action_potentials","Neurons","Nociception","Trophic_factor","Alzheimer's_disease","Epilepsy","Major_depressive_disorder","Eating_disorders","Cancer","Neuroprotection","Axotomy","Peripheral_nervous_system","Neurogenesis","Hyperpolarization_(biology)","Neurotransmitter","Acetylcholine","Serotonin","Norepinephrine","Neuropeptide_Y","Substance_P","Vasoactive_intestinal_peptide","CDNA","Hypothalamus","Cerebral_cortex","Brainstem","Duodenum","Peptide","Amino_acids","Homology_(biology)","N-terminus","C-terminal","Insulin","Galanin-like_peptide","Translational","RNA_splicing","GALR1","GALR2","GALR3","G_protein-coupled_receptor","Central_nervous_system","Pancreas","Solid_tumour","Gene_knockout","Pathology","Alzheimer's_disease","Cholinergic","Cognition","Acetylcholine","Excitotoxic","Amyloid","Transcription_(genetics)","Hippocampus","Glutamate","GABA","Seizure_threshold","Anticonvulsant","Neural_development","Dorsal_root_ganglion","Substance_P","Apoptosis","Neurites","Sciatic_nerve","Galanin_receptor"]}
