This image illustrates Phong shading, one of the first computer shading\n   models ever developed. ]] from a webcam unshaded on the left, and the same\n   image with a special effects shader applied on the right which replaces all\n   light areas of the image with white and the dark areas with a brightly\n   colored texture.]]\n\nIn the field of computer graphics, a 'shader' is a computer program that runs on\nthe graphics processing unit and is used to do shading - the production of\nappropriate levels of light and darkness within an image - or, in the modern\nera, also to produce special effects or do postprocessing.\n\nShaders calculate rendering effects on graphics hardware with a high degree of\nflexibility. Shading languages are used to program the graphics processing unit\n(GPU) programmable rendering pipeline, which has mostly superseded the fixed-\nfunction pipeline that allowed only common geometry transformation and pixel-\nshading functions; with shaders, customized effects can be used. The position,\nhue, saturation, brightness, and contrast of all pixels, vertices, or textures\nused to construct a final image can be altered on the fly, using algorithms\ndefined in the shader, and can be modified by external variables or textures\nintroduced by the program calling the shader.\n\nShaders are used widely in cinema postprocessing, computer-generated imagery,\nand video games to produce a seemingly infinite range of effects. Beyond just\nsimple lighting models - see List of common shading algorithms - more complex\nuses include altering the hue, saturation, brightness and/or contrast of an\nimage, producing blur, bokeh, cel shading, posterization, bump mapping,\ndistortion, chroma keying (so-called \"bluescreen/ greenscreen\" effects), edge\ndetection and motion detection, psychedelic effects, and a wide range of others.\n","linknr":244,"url":"Shader","recorded":1362562959,"links":29,"instances":["programming_language","geometry","computer_science","computer_graphics","vision","visual_arts","computer_graphics","optics","computer_graphics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Shading"],"headings":["History","Technology overview","Types of shaders","Parallel processing","Programming shaders","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/Mergefrom.svg/50px-Mergefrom.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/84/Phong-shading-sample.jpg/320px-Phong-shading-sample.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e6/Example_of_a_Shader.png/320px-Example_of_a_Shader.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["rendering","computer_graphics"],["vertex","optics"],["texture","visual_arts"],["variable","computer_science"],["contrast","vision"],["distortion","optics"],["vertex","computer_graphics"],["vertex","computer_graphics"],["primitive","geometry"],["fragment","computer_graphics"],["cg","programming_language"]],"members":["cg","primitive","variable","fragment","contrast","texture","rendering","distortion","vertex"],"related":["Phong_shading","Webcam","Computer_graphics","Computer_program","Graphics_processing_unit","Shading","Special_effects","Video_post-processing","Rendering_(computer_graphics)","Graphics_processing_unit","Rendering_pipeline","Pixel","Vertex_(optics)","Texture_(visual_arts)","Algorithm","Variable_(computer_science)","Filmmaking","Computer-generated_imagery","Video_games","List_of_common_shading_algorithms","Hue","Colorfulness","Brightness","Contrast_(vision)","Defocus_aberration","Bokeh","Cel_shading","Posterization","Bump_mapping","Distortion_(optics)","Chroma_key","Chroma_key","Greenscreen","Edge_detection","Motion_detection","Psychedelic","Pixar","Graphics_processing_unit","OpenGL","Direct3D","Vertex_(computer_graphics)","Pixel","Texture_mapping","Z-buffering","Alpha_compositing","Geometric_primitive","Tessellation","Shading_language","Frame_buffer","Frame_buffer","Unified_shader","Vertex_(computer_graphics)","Rasterizer","3D_model","Primitive_(geometry)","Graphics_pipeline","Pixel_shader","Tessellation","Shadow_volume","Cube_map","Fragment_(computer_graphics)","Color","Bump_mapping","Shadows","Specular_highlight","Z-buffering","Edge_detection","Video_postprocessing","Video_filter","Rasterization","Parallel_computing","Graphics_pipeline","OpenGL_ES","OpenGL_Shading_Language","HLSL","Cg_(programming_language)","Nvidia","List_of_common_shading_algorithms","GLSL","HLSL","Steve_Upstill","David_S._Ebert","F._Kenton_Musgrave","Darwyn_Peachey","Ken_Perlin","Steven_Worley","Ken_Perlin","Perlin_noise","Randima_Fernando","Mark_Kilgard","Randi_J._Rost","GPGPU","MSDN"]}
