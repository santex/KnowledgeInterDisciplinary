It can be contracted by other animals such as dogs, cats and\ngoats. It is caused by infection with the bacterium [[Burkholderia mallei]],\nusually by ingestion of contaminated food or water. Symptoms of glanders include\nthe formation of nodular lesions in the lungs and ulceration of the mucous\nmembranes in the upper respiratory tract. The acute form results in coughing,\nfever and the release of an infectious nasal discharge, followed by septicaemia\nand death within days. In the chronic form, nasal and subcutaneous nodules\ndevelop, eventually ulcerating. Death can occur within months, while survivors\nact as carriers.\n\nGlanders is endemic in Africa, Asia, the Middle East, Central and South America.\nIt has been eradicated from North America, Australia and most of Europe through\nsurveillance and destruction of affected animals, and import restrictions.\n\n[[Burkholderia mallei]] is able to infect humans and is therefore classed as a\nzoonotic agent. Transmission occurs by direct contact with infected animals and\nentry is through skin abrasions, nasal and oral mucosal surfaces, or by\ninhalation.\n\nThe mallein test is a sensitive and specific clinical test for glanders. Mallein\n(ATCvet code: ), a protein fraction of the glanders organism ([[Burkholderia\nmallei]]), is injected intradermo-palpebrally or given by eye-drop. In infected\nanimals, the eyelid swells markedly in 1 or 2 days.\n\nGlanders has not been reported in the United States since 1945.\n","linknr":367,"url":"Glanders","recorded":1362501586,"links":31,"instances":["world_war_i"],"pdf":["http://www.usamriid.army.mil/education/bluebookpdf/USAMRIID%20BlueBook%206th%20Edition%20-%20Sep%202006.pdf","http://www.usamriid.army.mil/education/bluebookpdf/USAMRIID%20BlueBook%206th%20Edition%20-%20Sep%202006.pdf"],"categories":["Zoonotic bacterial diseases","Biological weapons","Horse diseases","Bacterium-related cutaneous conditions","Horse health"],"headings":["Biological warfare use","Vaccine Research","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["eastern_front","world_war_i"]],"members":["eastern_front"],"related":["Middle_English","Old_French","Latin","German_language","Infectious_disease","Horses","Mule","Donkeys","Bacterium","Contamination","Zoonosis","Mallein","ATCvet","Biological_warfare","Bioterrorism","Melioidosis","World_War_I","German_Empire","Russian_Empire","Eastern_Front_(World_War_I)","Japan","Unit_731","World_War_II","Soviet_Union"]}
