{"cursor":"13778","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Failure rate' is the frequency with which an engineered system or component\nfails, expressed, for example, in failures per hour. It is often denoted by the\nGreek letter Î» (lambda) and is important in reliability engineering.\n\nThe failure rate of a system usually depends on time, with the rate varying over\nthe life cycle of the system. For example, an automobile's failure rate in its\nfifth year of service may be many times greater than its failure rate during its\nfirst year of service. One does not expect to replace an exhaust pipe, overhaul\nthe brakes, or have major transmission problems in a new vehicle.\n\nIn practice, the mean time between failures (MTBF, 1/Î») is often reported\ninstead of the failure rate. This is valid and useful if the failure rate may be\nassumed constant - often used for complex units / systems, electronics - and is\na general agreement in some reliability standards (Military and Aerospace). It\ndoes in this case only relate to the flat region of the bathtub curve, also\ncalled the \"useful life period\". Because of this, it is incorrect to extrapolate\nMTBF to give an estimate of the service life time of a component, which will\ntypically be much less than suggested by the MTBF due to the much higher failure\nrates in the \"end-of-life wearout\" part of the \"bathtub curve\".\n\nThe reason for the preferred use for MTBF numbers is that the use of large\npositive numbers (like 150.000 hours) is more intuitive and easier to remember\nthan very small numbers (like 1.3e-4 per hour)\n\nThe MTBF is an important system parameter in systems where failure rate needs to\nbe managed, in particular for safety systems. The MTBF appears frequently in the\nengineering design requirements, and governs frequency of required system\nmaintenance and inspections. In special processes called renewal processes,\nwhere the time to recover from failure can be neglected and the likelihood of\nfailure remains constant with respect to time, the failure rate is simply the\nmultiplicative inverse of the MTBF (1/Î»).\n\nA similar ratio used in the transport industries, especially in railways and\ntrucking is mean distance between failures, a variation which attempts to\ncorrelate actual loaded distances to similar reliability needs and practices.\n\nFailure rates are important factors in the insurance, finance, commerce and\nregulatory industries and fundamental to the design of safe systems in a wide\nvariety of applications.\n","linknr":428,"url":"Failure_rate","recorded":1362485843,"links":30,"instances":["engineering","mechanics","number"],"pdf":["http://www.mitre.org/work/best_papers/02/mondro_approx/mondro_approx.pdf","http://lamspeople.epfl.ch/kirrmann/Pubs/FT_Tutorial_HK_050418.pdf"],"categories":["Actuarial
