Forced to abandon his studies after his father's building business\nfailed in 1774, he moved to London in 1777. He became a reporter for The General\nAdvertiser and the [[London Evening Post]], where he raised sales in 1779 by his\ncourt reporting from the Portsmouth trial of Admiral Keppel and Admiral\nPalliser. John Gorton, A General Biographical Dictionary, new ed., 3 vols,\n1841 He established [[The European Magazine]] in 1782, leaving it a year\nlater to edit The Gazeteer as 'the Paper of the People'. In 1790 he managed to\nbecome owner and editor of the [[Morning Chronicle]]. In 1791-2 he reported from\nParis on the progress of the French Revolution. His political influence was\nsufficient for Pitt and Lord Shelburne to offer him a parliamentary seat, though\nhe refused. His Foxite journalism occasionally led to government prosecution. On\ntwo occasions he was acquitted: for printing an advertisement for a Derby\nmeeting of the Society for Constitutional Information in 1792, and for copying a\nparagraph from Leigh Hunt's [[Examiner]] about the Prince of Wales in 1810.\nHowever, he was sentenced to three months imprisonment in Newgate for allegedly\nlibelling the house in 1798.\n\nIn August 1798 he married Anne Hull: their eight children included the Indian\njudge and politician Thomas Erskine Perry (1806â1882).\n","linknr":117,"url":"James_Perry_(journalist)","recorded":1375054385,"links":["/w/index.php?title=James_Perry_(journalist)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=James_Perry_(journalist)&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Aberdeen","/wiki/Scotland","/wiki/Brighton","/wiki/England","/wiki/Marischal_College,_Aberdeen","/wiki/Thomas_Erskine_Perry","/wiki/United_Kingdom","/wiki/Marischal_College,_Aberdeen","/wiki/Faculty_of_Advocates","/wiki/London","/wiki/London_Evening_Post","/wiki/Augustus_Keppel,_1st_Viscount_Keppel","/wiki/Hugh_Palliser","#cite_note-1","/wiki/The_European_Magazine","/wiki/Morning_Chronicle","/wiki/French_Revolution","/wiki/Foxite","/wiki/Society_for_Constitutional_Information","/wiki/James_Henry_Leigh_Hunt","/wiki/Examiner","/wiki/George_IV_of_England","/wiki/Newgate_gaol","/wiki/Thomas_Erskine_Perry","/w/index.php?title=James_Perry_(journalist)&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","/wiki/John_Gorton_(writer)","http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/21996","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/70513990","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","/wiki/Aberdeen","/wiki/Scotland","/wiki/Brighton","/wiki/England","/wiki/File:Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/ae/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg/30px-Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=James_Perry_(journalist)&action=edit","/wiki/Template:UK-journalist-stub","/w/index.php?title=Template_talk:UK-journalist-stub&action=edit&redlink=1","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:UK-journalist-stub&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=James_Perry_(journalist)&oldid=524028205","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1756_births","/wiki/Category:1821_deaths","/wiki/Category:British_journalists","/wiki/Category:Alumni_of_the_University_of_Aberdeen","/wiki/Category:British_journalist_stubs","/wiki/Category:Use_dmy_dates_from_December_2010","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_hCards","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=James+Perry+%28journalist%29&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=James+Perry+%28journalist%29","/wiki/James_Perry_(journalist)","/wiki/Talk:James_Perry_(journalist)","#","/wiki/James_Perry_(journalist)","/w/index.php?title=James_Perry_(journalist)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=James_Perry_(journalist)&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/James_Perry_(journalist)","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/James_Perry_(journalist)","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=James_Perry_(journalist)&oldid=524028205","/w/index.php?title=James_Perry_(journalist)&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=James_Perry_%28journalist%29&id=524028205","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=James+Perry+%28journalist%29","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=James+Perry+%28journalist%29&oldid=524028205&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=James_Perry_(journalist)&printable=yes","#","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","
