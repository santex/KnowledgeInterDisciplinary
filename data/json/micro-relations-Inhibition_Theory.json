{"cursor":"8036","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Inhibition theory' is based on the basic assumption that, during the\nperformance of any mental task, which requires a minimum of mental effort, the\nsubject actually goes through a series of alternating states of distraction (non-\nwork) and attention (work). These alternating states of distraction (state 0)\nand attention (state 1) are latent states, which cannot be observed and which\nare completely imperceptible to the subject. Additionally, the concept of\ninhibition or reactive inhibition is introduced, which is also latent. The\nassumption is made, that during states of attention inhibition linearly\nincreases with a certain slope a 1 and during states of distraction\ninhibition linearly decreases with a certain slope a 0. According to\nthis view the distraction states can be considered as a sort of recovery states.\nIt is further assumed, that when the inhibition increases during a state of\nattention, depending on the amount of increase, the inclination to switch to a\ndistraction state also increases and when the inhibition decreases during a\nstate of distraction, depending on the amount of decrease, the inclination to\nswitch to an attention state increases. The inclination to switch from one state\nto the other is mathematically described as a transition rate or hazard rate,\nwhich makes the whole process of alternating distraction times and attention\ntimes a stochastic process.\n","linknr":103,"url":"Inhibition_Theory","recorded":1362668430,"links":15,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Intelligence","Attention","Perception"],"headings":["Theory","Application","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/4/2/042207523ae3fe9224dcb1d776b83ca5.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/c/8/8/c88ccb3efe40537fab58a5a9b82a673c.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/d/9/5d9fa8adcd69aca846567cf21009f584.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/d/9/4d9eb45aa258f854020765b6d101907f.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/9/4/3/9437dc9e4943aefe976cbf1be5fd376b.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/1/c/01cda40f32108cef746f0647a9f7be11.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/7/6/876a98472778dc12d918d977936129ef.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Distraction","Attention","Reactive_inhibition","Probability_density_function","Cumulative_distribution_function","Mean_deviation","Binocular_rivalry"]}
