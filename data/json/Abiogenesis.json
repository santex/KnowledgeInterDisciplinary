In a National Institutes of\nHealth study, the authors hypothesize that if biological complexity increased\nexponentially during evolution, life in the universe may have begun \"10 billion\nyears ago\" - more than 5 billion years before the\nEarth existed.\n\nScientific hypotheses about the origins of life may be divided into several\ncategories. Most approaches investigate how self-replicating molecules or their\ncomponents came into existence. For example, the MillerâUrey experiment and\nsimilar experiments demonstrated that most amino acids, often called \"the\nbuilding blocks of life\", can be racemically synthesized in conditions thought\nto be similar to those of the early Earth. Several mechanisms have been\ninvestigated, including lightning and radiation. Other approaches (\"metabolism\nfirst\" hypotheses) focus on understanding how catalysis in chemical systems in\nthe early Earth might have provided the precursor molecules necessary for self-\nreplication.\n","linknr":2018,"url":"Abiogenesis","recorded":1362506362,"links":91,"instances":["biology","chemistry","chemist","writer","geology","evolution","biology","geology","unit","chemistry","spacecraft","biochemistry","biochemistry"],"pdf":["http://www.astro.ulg.ac.be/~mouchet/BIOC0701-1/Cleaves-etal-2008.pdf","http://www.astro.ulg.ac.be/~mouchet/BIOC0701-1/Cleaves-etal-2008.pdf","http://www.springerlink.com/content/mp42778372jv6054/fulltext.pdf","http://www.springerlink.com/content/mp42778372jv6054/fulltext.pdf","http://www.eso.org/public/archives/releases/sciencepapers/eso1234/eso1234a.pdf","http://www.eso.org/public/archives/releases/sciencepapers/eso1234/eso1234a.pdf","http://ool.weizmann.ac.il/Segre_Lipid_World.pdf","http://ool.weizmann.ac.il/Segre_Lipid_World.pdf","http://journalofcosmology.com/JoC16pdfs/Laoupi._commentary%202.pdf","http://journalofcosmology.com/JoC16pdfs/Laoupi._commentary%202.pdf","http://student.science.uva.nl/~jckastel/html/abiogenesis.pdf"],"categories":["Evolutionarily
