Richard Rorty, for\nexample, argued that relativist philosophers believe \"that the grounds for\nchoosing between such opinions is less algorithmic than had been thought,\" but\nnot that any belief is equally as valid as any other.\n\nMoral relativism has been espoused, criticized, and debated for thousands of\nyears, from ancient Greece and India down to the present day, in diverse fields\nincluding philosophy, science, and religion.\n","linknr":691,"url":"Moral_relativism","recorded":1362485774,"links":37,"instances":["sociology","author","philosopher","philosophy"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Social philosophy","Morality|Relativism","Meta-ethics","Relativism","Postmodernism","Ethical theories"],"headings":["Variations","History","Views on meta-ethical relativism","See also","References","Bibliography","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["universality","philosophy"],["norm","sociology"],["sam_harris","author"],["walter_kaufmann","philosopher"]],"members":["norm","sam_harris","walter_kaufmann","universality"],"related":["Philosophical","Moral","People","Culture","Moral_objectivism","Tolerate","Richard_Rorty","Greece","India","Science","Religion","Positive_science","Ontology","Epistemology","Anthropology","Sociology","Metaethics","Universality_(philosophy)","Truth","Chris_Gowans","Norm_(sociology)","Moral_universalism","Russell_Blackford","Moral_universalist","Utilitarian","Culture","Jainism","Anekantavada","Mahavira","Greeks","Philosopher","Protagoras","Historian","Herodotus","Philosopher","Baruch_Spinoza","The_enlightenment","David_Hume","Emotivism","Friedrich_Nietzsche","Moral_realism","Moral_skepticism","Moral_value","Brian_Leiter","Transcendentalism","Theory_of_forms","Allegory_of_the_cave","Christianity","Christianity","Ruth_Benedict","Ethnocentricism","Moral_nihilism","Social_sciences","Edward_Westermarck","G.E._Moore","Ethical_intuitionism","Sam_Harris_(author)","New_Atheism","Neuroscience","Science_of_morality","Ethical_realism","Ethical_naturalism","Utilitarianism","Consequentialism","Evolutionary_biology","Natural_phenomenon","Natural_selection","Group_selection","The_Science_of_Good_and_Evil","R._M._Hare","Discourse","Truth_condition","Walter_Terence_Stace","Moral_absolutism","Moral_universalism","Ibn_Warraq","Eddie_Tabash","Moral_nihilism","Hedonism","Solipsism","Inductive_reasoning","Simon_Blackburn","Moral_realist","World_War_II","Pope_Benedict_XVI","Marcello_Pera","Christianity","Human_sexual_behavior","Family","Sub-replacement_fertility","Islam","Pope_Benedict_XVI","Marcello_Pera","Encyclical","Pope_John_Paul_II","Bhikkhu_Bodhi","Buddhist","World_view","Bhikkhu_Bodhi","Existentialism","Cultural_relativism","Guy_Ankerl","Kurt_Baier","Prentice_Hall","Ruth_Benedict","Panayot_Butchvarov","Ronald_F._Duska","R.M._Hare","Oxford_University_Press","Gilbert_Harman","Judith_Jarvis_Thomson","Sterling_Harwood","David_Hume","Oxford_University_Press","G.E._Moore","Cambridge_University_Press","Jean-Paul_Sartre","Walter_Kaufmann_(philosopher)","Walter_Terence_Stace","Macmillan_Publishers","Leo_Strauss","University_of_Chicago_Press","Edvard_Westermarck","Macmillan_Publishers","Bernard_Williams","Harvard_University_Press","David_B._Wong","University_of_California_Press"]}
