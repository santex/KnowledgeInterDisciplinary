This includes familiar concepts such as\nvisible light (color), musical notes, radio/TV channels, and even the regular\nrotation of the earth. When these physical phenomena are represented in the form\nof a frequency spectrum, certain physical descriptions of their internal\nprocesses become much simpler. Often, the frequency spectrum clearly shows\nharmonics, visible as distinct spikes or lines, that provide insight into the\nmechanisms that generate the entire signal.\n","linknr":236,"url":"Frequency_spectrum","recorded":1362570829,"links":35,"instances":["electronics","waves","physics","signal_processing"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Spectroscopy","Scattering","Fourier analysis","Frequency domain analysis","Radio spectrum","Signal processing"],"headings":["Light","Sound","Radio","Spectrum analysis","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b4/68448_pinkyfinger_Piano_G.jpg/220px-68448_pinkyfinger_Piano_G.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/Sonagraphe.jpg/220px-Sonagraphe.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f1/Voice_waveform_and_spectrum.png/220px-Voice_waveform_and_spectrum.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/Triangle-td_and_fd.png/220px-Triangle-td_and_fd.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/d/3/4/d343c3b7575ee94b51c35a1fb27996bc.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/26/Spectrogram_showing_shared_partials.png/80px-Spectrogram_showing_shared_partials.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["signal","electronics"],["phase","waves"],["phase","waves"],["power","physics"],["sampling","signal_processing"],["sampling","signal_processing"]],"members":["signal","phase","power","sampling"],"related":["Signal_(electronics)","Frequency_domain","Fourier_transform","Amplitude","Phase_(waves)","Frequency","Visible_light","Color","Radio_frequency","Harmonics","Musical_tone","Timbre","Harmonic_spectrum","White_noise","Timbre","Sound","Note","Harmonic","Partial","Overtone","Spectrum_analyzer","Sound","Spectrogram","Hobbyist","Acoustic_signature","ADSR_envelope","ADSR_envelope","ADSR_envelope","ADSR_envelope","Tuned_circuit","Modulation","Discrete_Fourier_transform","Frequency_domain","Spectral_density_estimation","Periodic_function","Fourier_analysis","Fourier_transform","Inverse_Fourier_transform","Phase_(waves)","Polar_coordinates","Power_(physics)","Power_spectrum","Fast_Fourier_transform","Discrete_Fourier_transform","Sampling_(signal_processing)","Frequency_domain","Nonlinearity","Noise","Frequency_distribution","Sampling_(signal_processing)","Discrete_Fourier_transform","Welch's_method","White_noise","Frequency_estimation","Electromagnetic_spectrum","Spectrogram"]}
