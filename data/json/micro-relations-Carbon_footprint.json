{"cursor":"27944","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'carbon footprint' has historically been defined as \"the total sets of\ngreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions caused by an organization, event, product or\nperson.\"\n\nHowever, calculating the total carbon footprint is impossible due to the large\namount of data required and the fact that carbon dioxide can be produced by\nnatural occurrences. It is for this reason that Wright, Kemp, and Williams,\nwriting in the journal Carbon Management, have suggested a more practicable\ndefinition:\n\n''\"A measure of the total amount of carbon dioxide (CO 2) and methane\n(CH 4) emissions of a defined population, system or activity,\nconsidering all relevant sources, sinks and storage within the spatial and\ntemporal boundary of the population, system or activity of interest. Calculated\nas carbon dioxide equivalent (CO 2e) using the relevant 100-year\nglobal warming potential (GWP100).\"\n\nGreenhouse gases can be emitted through transport, land clearance, and the\nproduction and consumption of food, fuels, manufactured goods, materials, wood,\nroads, buildings, and services. For simplicity of reporting, it is\noften expressed in terms of the amount of carbon dioxide, or its equivalent of\nother GHGs, emitted.\n\nMost of the carbon footprint emissions for the average U.S. household come from\n\"indirect\" sources, i.e. fuel burned to produce goods far away from the final\nconsumer. These are distinguished from emissions which come from burning fuel\ndirectly in one's car or stove, commonly referred to as \"direct\" sources of the\nconsumer's carbon footprint. {{cite web|url=\nhttp://coolclimate.berkeley.edu/footprint |title=Graph of the Average Carbon\nFootprint of a U.S. Household|accessdate=4 May 2012}}\n\nThe concept name of the carbon footprint originates from ecological\nfootprint,discussion, which was developed by Rees and Wackernagel in\nthe 1990s which estimates the number of \"earths\" that would theoretically be\nrequired if everyone on the planet consumed resources at the same level as the\nperson calculating their ecological footprint. However, carbon footprints are\nmuch more specific than ecological footprints since they measure direct\nemissions of gasses that cause climate change into the atmosphere.\n\n'Measuring Carbon Footprints'\n\nAn individual's, nation's, or organization's carbon footprint can be measured by\nundertaking a GHG emissions assessment or other calculative activities denoted\nas carbon accounting. Once the size of a carbon footprint is known, a strategy\ncan be devised to reduce it, e.g. by technological developments, better process\nand product management, changed Green Public or Private Procurement (GPP),\ncarbon capture, consumption strategies, and others. Several free online carbon\nfootprint calculators exist, with at least one supported by publicly available\npeer-reviewed data and calculations from the University of California,\nBerkeley's CoolClimate Network research consortium.\n\nThe mitigation of carbon footprints through the development of alternative\nprojects, such as solar or wind energy or reforestation, represents one way of\nreducing a carbon footprint and is often known as Carbon offsetting.\n\nThe main influences on carbon footprints include population, economic output,\nand energy and carbon intensity of the economy.

These factors are the main\ntargets of individuals and businesses in order to decrease carbon footprints.\nScholars suggest the most effective way to decrease a carbon footprint is to\neither decrease the amount of energy needed for production or to decrease the\ndependence on carbon emitting fuels.\n","linknr":643,"url":"Carbon_footprint","recorded":1362500124,"links":53,"instances":["travel"],"pdf":["http://www.isa.org.usyd.edu.au/publications/documents/ISA_Nuclear_Report.pdf","http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/66043/20061201-0000/www.dpmc.gov.au/umpner/docs/commissioned/ISA_report.pdf","http://www.isa.org.usyd.edu.au/publications/documents/ISA_Nuclear_Report.pdf","http://iga.igg.cnr.it/documenti/IGA/Fridleifsson_et_al_IPCC_Geothermal_paper_2008.pdf","http://iga.igg.cnr.it/documenti/IGA/Fridleifsson_et_al_IPCC_Geothermal_paper_2008.pdf","http://ecosystemmarketplace.com/documents/acrobat/StateoftheVoluntaryCarbonMarket18July_Final.pdf"],"categories":["Buzzwords","Environmental issues with energy"],"headings":["By area","Kyoto Protocol, carbon offsetting, and certificates","Ways to reduce carbon footprint","See also","Notes","References","External links",""],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d3/Greenhouse_emissions_by_electricity_source.PNG/400px-Greenhouse_emissions_by_electricity_source.PNG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/24/Wikinews-logo.svg/40px-Wikinews-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["hypermobility","travel"]],"members":["hypermobility"],"related":["Greenhouse_gas","Carbon_dioxide","Methane","Carbon_dioxide_equivalent","Global-warming_potential","Carbon_dioxide","Ecological_footprint","Carbon_accounting","Carbon_capture","Solar_energy","Wind_energy","Reforestation","Carbon_offsetting","Cement","Publicly_Available_Specification","Coal","Oil","Natural_gas","Geothermal_power","Uranium","Nuclear_power","Hydroelectricity","Concentrating_solar_power","Photovoltaics","Wind_power","Wind_power","Hydropower","Carbon_offset","Kyoto_Protocol","Certified_Emission_Reduction","Emission_Reduction_Unit","Verified_Emission_Reduction","Flexible_Mechanisms","Clean_Development_Mechanism","Joint_Implementation","Emissions_trading","Emissions_Trading","Certified_Emissions_Reduction","Emission_Reduction_Unit","Emissions_Trading","Emissions_Trading","Emissions_Trading","Kyoto_Protocol","Emissions_Trading","Market_price","EU_Emissions_Trading_Scheme","EU_Emissions_Trading_Scheme","Chicago_Climate_Exchange","Emissions_trading","Carbon_neutral","Forestry","Deforestation","Carbon_dioxide_sink","Efficient_energy_use","Carbon_capture_and_storage","Renewable_energy","Ã†ON","Private_brand","Reduce,_Reuse,_Recycle","4_Degrees_and_Beyond_International_Climate_Conference","Avoiding_dangerous_climate_change","2000-watt_society","Carbon_accounting","Carbon_cycle","Carbon_diet","Carbon_intensity","Chief_green_officer","Earthcheck","Ecological_footprint","Ecosharing","Energy_neutral_design","Energy_policy","Enterprise_carbon_accounting","Environmental_impact_of_aviation","Food_miles","Greenhouse_debt","Global_warming","Green_conventions","Hypermobility_(travel)","Life_cycle_assessment","List_of_countries_by_carbon_dioxide_emissions_per_capita","List_of_countries_by_greenhouse_gas_emissions_per_capita","Low_carbon_diet","Medical_tourism","Open_Carbon_World","Relative_cost_of_electricity_generated_by_different_sources","Telecommuting","Water_footprint","Weighted_average_cost_of_carbon","Nova_Science_Publishers"]}
