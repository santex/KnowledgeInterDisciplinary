{"cursor":"3309","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'protein isoform' is any of several different forms of the same protein.\nDifferent forms of a protein may be produced from related genes, or may arise\nfrom the same gene by alternative splicing. A large number of isoforms are\ncaused by single-nucleotide polymorphisms or SNPs, small genetic differences\nbetween alleles of the same gene. These occur at specific individual nucleotide\npositions within a gene.\n\nThe discovery of isoforms partly explains the apparently small number of coding\nregions (genes) revealed by the human genome project: the ability to create\ncategorically different proteins from the same gene increases the diversity of\nthe proteome. Isoforms are readily described and discovered by microarray\nstudies and cDNA libraries.\n","linknr":141,"url":"Isoform","recorded":1362900880,"links":24,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Molecular biology","Proteins"],"headings":["Glycoforms","Examples","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/Myoglobin.png/30px-Myoglobin.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Protein","Genes","Alternative_splicing","Single-nucleotide_polymorphisms","Alleles","Genes","Human_genome_project","Proteome","Microarray","CDNA","Glycan","Glycoproteins","Saccharide","Oligosaccharide","Biosynthesis","Glycosylation","Glycosidases","Glycosyltransferases","Lectins","Lectin_affinity_chromatography","Lectin","Affinity_electrophoresis","Blood_proteins","Orosomucoid","Antitrypsin","Haptoglobin","Neural_cell_adhesion_molecule","Polysialic_acid","G-actin","Creatine_kinase","Myocardial_infarction","Hyaluronan_synthase","UDP-glucuronosyltransferase"]}
