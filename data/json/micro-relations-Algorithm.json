The\n algorithm proceeds by successive subtractions in two loops: IF the test B â¥ A\n yields \"yes\" (or true) (more accurately the number b in location B is greater\n than or equal to the number a in location A) THEN, the algorithm specifies B â\n B â A (meaning the number b â a replaces the old b). Similarly, IF A > B, THEN\n A â A â B. The process terminates when (the contents of) B is 0, yielding the\n g.c.d. in A. (Algorithm derived from Scott 2009:13; symbols and drawing style\n from Tausworthe 1977).]]\n\nIn mathematics and computer science, an 'algorithm' () is a step-by-step\nprocedure for calculations. Algorithms are used for calculation, data\nprocessing, and automated reasoning.\n\nMore precisely, an algorithm is an effective method expressed as a list \"Any\nclassical mathematical algorithm, for example, can be described in a finite\nnumber of English words\" (Rogers 1987:2). of well-defined\ninstructions Well defined with respect to the agent that executes the\nalgorithm: \"There is a computing agent, usually human, which can react to the\ninstructions and carry out the computations\" (Rogers 1987:2). for\ncalculating a function. \"an algorithm is a procedure for computing a\nfunction (with respect to some chosen notation for integers) ... this limitation\n(to numerical functions) results in no loss of generality\", (Rogers\n1987:1). Starting from an initial state and initial input (perhaps\nempty), \"An algorithm has zero or more inputs, i.e., quantities which are\ngiven to it initially before the algorithm begins\" (Knuth 1973:5). the\ninstructions describe a computation that, when executed, will proceed through a\nfinite \"A procedure which has all the characteristics of an algorithm\nexcept that it possibly lacks finiteness may be called a 'computational method'\"\n(Knuth 1973:5). number of well-defined successive states, eventually\nproducing \"output\" \"An algorithm has one or more outputs, i.e. quantities\nwhich have a specified relation to the inputs\" (Knuth 1973:5). and\nterminating at a final ending state. The transition from one state to the next\nis not necessarily deterministic; some algorithms, known as randomized\nalgorithms, incorporate random input. Whether or not a process with random\ninterior processes (not including the input) is an algorithm is debatable.\nRogers opines that: \"a computation is carried out in a discrete stepwise\nfashion, without use of continuous methods or analogue devices . . . carried\nforward deterministically, without resort to random methods or devices, e.g.,\ndice\" Rogers 1987:2).\n\nThough al-KhwÄrizmÄ«'s algorism referred to the rules of performing arithmetic\nusing Hindu-Arabic numerals and the systematic solution of linear and quadratic\nequations, a partial formalization of what would become the modern algorithm\nbegan with attempts to solve the Entscheidungsproblem (the \"decision problem\")\nposed by David Hilbert in 1928. Subsequent formalizations were framed as\nattempts to define \"effective calculability\" Kleene 1943 in Davis\n1965:274 or \"effective method\"; Rosser 1939 in Davis 1965:225\nthose formalizations included the GÃ¶delâHerbrandâKleene recursive functions of\n1930, 1934 and 1935, Alonzo Church's lambda calculus of 1936, Emil Post's\n\"Formulation 1\" of 1936, and Alan Turing's Turing machines of 1936â7 and 1939.\nGiving a formal definition of algorithms, corresponding to the intuitive notion,\nremains a challenging problem.\n","linknr":994,"url":"Algorithm","recorded":1362505068,"links":126,"instances":["computer_science","computing","mathematics","data_structure","computing","optimization","computer_science","logic","mathematics","computing","mathematics","mathematics","complexity"],"pdf":["http://groups.csail.mit.edu/netmit/sFFT/paper.pdf","http://research.microsoft.com/~gurevich/Opera/164.pdf","http://research.microsoft.com/~gurevich/Opera/164.pdf","http://research.microsoft.com/~gurevich/Opera/141.pdf"],"categories":["Algorithms|","Arabic
