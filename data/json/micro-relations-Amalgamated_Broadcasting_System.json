{"cursor":"4110","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The 'Amalgamated Broadcasting System' ('ABS') was a radio network established\non September 25, 1933 by the American comedian Ed Wynn and Hungarian-born\nviolinist Ota Gygi.\n\nWynn, the \"Fire Chief\" of the original [[Texaco Star Theater|Fire Chief\nProgram]] program on NBC and CBS, had been concerned with his own perilous-\nseeming future as an entertainer and the power the already-established networks\nhad over the programming policies of their local affiliate stations. He hoped\nthat ABS would serve as an alternative as well as helping him establish a more\nsecure future for himself and his family, according to radio historian\nElizabeth McLeod.\n\nIn fact, Wynn poured his entire personal savings as well as his reputation\ninto the project, then put together an investment group and bought New York\nstation WBNX as its planned flagship, hoping to establish a 100-station\nnetwork in due course. The investment team also looked to WOL Washington, WPEN\nPhiladelphia, WHDH Boston and WCFL Chicago among planned key affiliates. The\nnew network went on the air with a four-hour gala from WBNX's newly-built New\nYork studios on September 25, 1933---even as Wynn was preparing a new season\nof The Fire Chief Program.\n\nWynn, however, was also due to Hollywood to make a new film and put Gygi in\ncharge of the network in his absence. That, McLeod wrote, proved the biggest\nmistake of his career, if not his life. At a press conference launching the new\nABS, Gygi \"managed to alienate almost the entire New York City press corps,\"\nMcLeod wrote, \"by announcing . . . that he was only interested in what the [[New\nYork Times]] thought of the project and had no use for any of the other papers.\"\nThat irked then-powerful [[New York Daily News]] radio critic Ben Gross, whose\nlead in attacking the apparent ABS attitude was picked up by his peers---and by\nadvertisers whom Gygi reportedly alienated by positioning ABS toward treating\nadvertising as \"a necessary but distasteful evil,\" McLeod continued. ABS would\nallow no advertiser mention other than at the beginning and end of programs and\nno advertising spots during any programs. That was commercial radio's original\npolicy until NBC and CBS abandoned it as the 1930s progressed, McLeod noted,\nleaving ABS stranded for attracting top quality programming without big money\nadvertisers to sponsor it.\n\nThat attitude plus its weak organisation in Wynn's absence killed the project.\nAmalgamated went out of business on October 28, 1933, only five weeks after its\nfirst broadcast. Wynn had ended his association with ABS by that time but he had\nalso vowed to repay his investors---their loss was over $300,000, according to\nMcLeod---and that pressure, plus the end of The Fire Chief Program and his\nmarital trouble two years later, helped drive the comedian toward a nervous\nbreakdown by the end of the 1930s.\n\nA much more successful alternative network, the Mutual Broadcasting System, was\nestablished on September 29, 1934. Mutual was inspired in large part from the\nideas behind Amalgamated, and in fact had one of Amalgamated's planned key\naffiliates, WXYZ Detroit, as one of its charter stations. A recording of ABS's\nlaunch gala is believed to survive and circulate among history-minded old-time\nradio fans.\n\nThe film [[The Great Man]] (1956), which has a broadcasting background and\nfeatures Wynn in a supporting role, is centered on a fictional network known as\nthe \"Amalgamated Broadcasting System\".\n","linknr":94,"url":"Amalgamated_Broadcasting_System","recorded":1364112040,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Amalgamated_Broadcasting_System&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Amalgamated_Broadcasting_System&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/Ed_Wynn","/wiki/Hungary","/wiki/Texaco_Star_Theater","/wiki/NBC","/wiki/CBS","/wiki/Elizabeth_McLeod","/wiki/New_York","/wiki/WKDM","/wiki/WOL_(AM)","/wiki/Washington,_D.C.","/wiki/WKDN_(AM)","/wiki/Philadelphia,_Pennsylvania","/wiki/WEEI","/wiki/Boston,_Massachusetts","/wiki/WCFL_(AM)","/wiki/Chicago","/wiki/New_York","/wiki/Hollywood","/wiki/New_York_Times","/wiki/New_York_Daily_News","/wiki/Mutual_Broadcasting_System","/wiki/WXYT_(AM)","/wiki/The_Great_Man","/w/index.php?title=Amalgamated_Broadcasting_System&action=edit&section=1","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Amalgamated_Broadcasting_System&oldid=530261618","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:American_radio_networks","/wiki/Category:American_comedians","/wiki/Category:1933_establishments_in_the_United_States","/wiki/Category:1933_disestablishments_in_the_United_States","/wiki/Category:Defunct_radio_networks_in_the_United_States","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Amalgamated+Broadcasting+System&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Amalgamated+Broadcasting+System","/wiki/Amalgamated_Broadcasting_System","/wiki/Talk:Amalgamated_Broadcasting_System","#","/wiki/Amalgamated_Broadcasting_System","/w/index.php?title=Amalgamated_Broadcasting_System&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Amalgamated_Broadcasting_System&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Amalgamated_Broadcasting_System","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Amalgamated_Broadcasting_System","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Amalgamated_Broadcasting_System&oldid=530261618","/w/index.php?title=Amalgamated_Broadcasting_System&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Amalgamated_Broadcasting_System&id=530261618","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Amalgamated+Broadcasting+System","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Amalgamated+Broadcasting+System&oldid=530261618&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Amalgamated_Broadcasting_System&printable=yes","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amalgamated_Broadcasting_System","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=skins.vector&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","/w/index.php?title=MediaWiki:Gadget-ReferenceTooltips.js&action=raw&ctype=text/javascript&508635914","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":["am","am","am","am"],"pdf":[],"categories":["American
