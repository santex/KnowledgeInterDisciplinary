In\nhumans and other mammals, the anatomical features of the respiratory system\ninclude airways, lungs, and the respiratory muscles. Molecules of oxygen and\ncarbon dioxide are passively exchanged, by diffusion, between the gaseous\nexternal environment and the blood. This exchange process occurs in the alveolar\nregion of the lungs. Other animals, such as insects, have respiratory\nsystems with very simple anatomical features, and in amphibians even the skin\nplays a vital role in gas exchange. Plants also have respiratory systems but the\ndirectionality of gas exchange can be opposite to that in animals. The\nrespiratory system in plants also includes anatomical features such as holes on\nthe undersides of leaves known as stomata.\n","linknr":1069,"url":"Respiratory_system","recorded":1362555672,"links":108,"instances":["medical","biology","anatomy"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Respiratory system"],"headings":["Comparative anatomy and physiology","Anatomy in invertebrates","Physiology in mammals","Development","Disease","Plants","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/Respiratory_system_complete_en.svg/250px-Respiratory_system_complete_en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["gills","biology#vertebrate_gills"],["tissue","biology"],["diaphragm","anatomy"],["oxygenation","medical"]],"members":["gills","oxygenation","tissue","diaphragm"],"related":["Biological_system","Gas_exchange","Mammal","Lung","Molecule","Oxygen","Carbon_dioxide","Diffusion","Blood","Insects","Amphibians","Skin","Gas_exchange","Plants","Leaf","Stomata","Obligate_nasal_breathing","Elephant","Pleural_space","Parietal_pleura","Visceral_pleura","Connective_tissue","Thoracic_diaphragm","Air_sacs","Thoracic_diaphragm","Pleural_cavity","Capillary","Alveoli","Anatomy","Lungs","Reptiles","Mammals","Gas_exchange","Alveoli","Thoracic_diaphragm","Intercostal_muscles","Turtles","Inhalation","Exhalation","Amphibians","Mucus","Aquatic_respiration","Lungfish","Anabantoidei","Exoskeleton","Cell_membrane","Tissue_(biology)","Lactic_acid","Muscle_cell","Water_potential","Osmosis","Diffusion_pathway","Simple_diffusion","Muscle_contraction","Abdomen","Discontinuous_gas_exchange","Molluscs","Hemocyaninine","Respiratory_system_of_gastropods","Nervous_system","Brain_stem","Medulla_oblongata","Pons","Brain_cell","Pneumotaxic_center","Apneustic_center","Dorsal_respiratory_group","Ventral_respiratory_group","Shaken_baby_syndrome","Chemoreceptor","Aorta","Common_carotid_artery","Proprioception","Epinephrine","Inhalation","Diaphragm_(anatomy)","External_intercostal_muscles","Accessory_muscles_of_respiration","Sternocleidomastoid","Platysma","Scalene_muscles","Pectoral_muscles","Latissimus_dorsi","Rib","Thorax","External_intercostal_muscles","Thoracic_cavity","Exhalation","Abdominal_muscles","Internal_intercostal_muscles","Bell_jar","Gas_exchange","Circulatory_system","Oxygenation_(medical)","Metabolic_waste","Circulatory_system","Homeostasis","Respiratory_acidosis","Respiratory_alkalosis","Pulmonary_alveolus","Epithelium","Capillaries","Endothelium","White_blood_cell","Lymphocyte","Larynx","Pharynx","Mouth","Speech","Vocal_cords","Communication","Panting","Nasal_cavity","Airways","Coughing","Sneezing","Vertebrate_trachea","Nose","Mucus","Mouth","Swallowed","Fetus","Pregnancy","Premature_birth","Surfactant","Infant_respiratory_distress_syndrome","Steroid","Steroid","Respiratory_disease","Emphysema","Bronchitis","Allergic_asthma","Fibrosis","Sarcoidosis","Pleural_effusion","Pulmonary_edema","Pulmonary_embolism","Pulmonary_hypertension","Pneumonia","Tuberculosis","Asbestosis","Cough","Mucus","Saliva","Infection","Microbe","Pathogen","Pulmonology","Respiratory_therapy","Plant","Carbon_dioxide","Photosynthesis","Oxygen","Diffusion","Leaf","Stomata","John_B._West"]}
