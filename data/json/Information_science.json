Merriam-Webster and\nAmerican Heritage Dictionary. Practitioners within the field study the\napplication and usage of knowledge in organizations, along with the interaction\nbetween people, organizations and any existing information systems, with the\naim of creating, replacing, improving, or understanding information systems.\nInformation science is often (mistakenly) considered a branch of computer\nscience. However, it is actually a broad, interdisciplinary field,\nincorporating not only aspects of computer science, but often diverse fields\nsuch as archival science, cognitive science, commerce, communications, law,\nlibrary science, museology, management, mathematics, philosophy, public policy,\nand the social sciences.\n\nInformation science should not be confused with information theory or library\nscience. Information theory is the study of a particular mathematical concept of\ninformation, while library science is a field related to libraries which uses\nsome of the principles of information science.\n","linknr":549,"url":"Information_science","recorded":1362476942,"links":58,"instances":["online_database","logic","academic_field","computing","computing"],"pdf":["http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/pci/downloads/introduction.pdf","http://tomgruber.org/writing/ontolingua-kaj-1993.pdf","http://tomgruber.org/writing/ontolingua-kaj-1993.pdf","http://www.ida.liu.se/~janma/SemWeb/Slides/ontologies1.pdf","http://www.ida.liu.se/~janma/SemWeb/Slides/ontologies1.pdf","http://www.iainstitute.org/documents/learn/What_is_IA.pdf","http://www.webkb.org/doc/papers/iccs02/iswc02.pdf","http://www.cais-acsi.ca/proceedings/2000/monarch_2000.pdf"],"categories":["Information
