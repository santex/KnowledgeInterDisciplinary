In his works Primitive\nCulture and Anthropology, he defined the context of the scientific study of\nanthropology, based on the evolutionary theories of Charles Lyell. He\nbelieved that there was a functional basis for the development of society\nand religion, which he determined was universal. E. B. Tylor is considered\nby many to be a founding figure of the science of social anthropology, and\nhis scholarly works are seen as important and lasting contributions to the\ndiscipline of anthropology that was beginning to take shape in the 19th\ncentury. Paul Bohannan, Social Anthropology (New York:\nHolt, Rinehart & Winston, 1969) He believed that \"research into the\nhistory and prehistory of man [...] could be used as a basis for the reform\nof British society.\" Lewis, Herbert S.
