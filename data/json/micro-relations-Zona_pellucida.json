The zona pellucida first appears in unilaminar primary\noocytes. It is secreted by both the oocyte and the follicular cells.\n\nThis structure binds spermatozoa, and is required to initiate the acrosome\nreaction. In the mouse (the best characterised mammalian system), the zona\nglycoprotein, ZP3, is responsible for sperm binding, adhering to proteins on the\nsperm plasma membrane (GalT). ZP3 is then involved in the induction of the\nacrosome reaction, whereby a spermatozoon releases the contents of the acrosomal\nvesicle. The exact characterisation of what occurs in other species has become\nmore complicated as further zona proteins have been\nidentified.\n\nIn humans, five days after the fertilization, the blastocyst performs zona\nhatching; the zona pellucida degenerates and decomposes to be replaced by the\nunderlying layer of trophoblastic cells.\n\nThe zona pellucida is essential for oocyte death and fertilization.\n\nIn some older texts, it has also been called 'zona striata' and 'stratum\nlucidum' (not to be confused with the stratum lucidum of the skin).\n","linknr":325,"url":"Zona_pellucida","recorded":1362557172,"links":31,"instances":["embryology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Germ cells","Reproductive system","Developmental biology"],"headings":["Immunocontraception","Zona pellucida glycoproteins","Additional images","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/Gray3.png/250px-Gray3.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c4/Gray9.png/120px-Gray9.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3a/Gray1164.png/120px-Gray1164.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/HumanEmbryogenesis.svg/120px-HumanEmbryogenesis.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["corona_radiata","embryology"]],"members":["corona_radiata"],"related":["Ovum","Corona_radiata_(embryology)","Glycoprotein","Plasma_membrane","Oocyte","Spermatozoa","Acrosome_reaction","ZP3","Protein","Acrosome","Blastocyst","Zona_hatching","Trophoblast","Oocyte","Fertilization","Stratum_lucidum","Immunocontraception","Vitelline_layer","Fish","Immune_response","New_Jersey","Porcine_zona_pellucida","Deer","ZP3","ZP4","Acrosome_reaction","Fertilization","ZP3","Ovum","Human_embryogenesis","Maternal_influence_on_sex_determination"]}
