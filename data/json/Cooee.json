{"cursor":"3328","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Cooee!' (IPA /ku:'i:/) is a shout used in Australia, usually in the Bush, to\nattract attention, find missing people, or indicate one's own location. When\ndone correctly - loudly and shrilly - a call of \"cooee\" can carry over a\nconsiderable distance . It is also known as a call of help, which can blend in\nwith different natural sounds in the bush.\n\nThe word \"cooee\" originates from the Dharuk language of the original inhabitants\nof the Sydney area. It means \"come here\", The Macquarie Concise Dictionary,\nThe Macquarie Library, 1998, Sydney, ISBN 0-949757-95-0 and has now become\nwidely used in Australia as a call over distances. It was known among white\nsettlers in colonial times and Watkin Tench refers to the Aborigines of Sydney\ncalling to each other in this way.\n\nOne of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes mysteries hinges on the use of\n\"cooee!\". \"The Boscombe Valley Mystery\" is solved partly because, unlike\neveryone else, Holmes recognizes the call is commonly used among Australians.\n\nAn expression \"within cooee of\" has developed. It means \"within a manageable\ndistance\", and seems to be confined to New Zealand and Australian English, and\nis often used in the negative sense (i.e. \"you're not even within cooee\",\nmeaning not close to or, a long way off). The distance one's Cooee call travels\ncan be a matter of competitive pride. Another example would be: \"They realised\nthey were lost and there was no-one wihin cooee\". In the abstract (e.g. \"How\nmuch do you think they spent redoing this place?\" \"Oh, I don't know, $5000?\".\n\"You're not even within cooee - 25,000!\"\n\nThe word cooee has become a name of many organisations, places and even events.\nPerhaps the most historic of these was the Cooee March during the First World\nWar. It was staged by 35 men from Gilgandra, New South Wales, 766Â km\nnorthwest of Sydney, as a recruiting drive after enthusiasm for the war waned in\n1915 with the first casualty lists. The men marched to Sydney calling \"Cooee!\"\nto encourage others to come and enlist. When they reached Sydney on 12 December,\nthe group had grown to 277 men. To this day, Gilgandra holds a yearly Cooee\nFestival in October to commemorate the event. Other Cooee Festivals occur across\nAustralia. Cooee is also the name of a suburb in the Tasmanian city of Burnie.\n\nRichard White  \"Cooees across the Strand: Australian Travellers in London\nand the Performance of National Identity\" Australian Historical Studies 32(116)\nApril 2001 indicates the important means of demonstrating Australian\nnationality with the call taking on a consciously nationalistic meaning. He also\ndocuments its spread through the Empire, to New Zealand and South Africa.\n","linknr":100,"url":"Cooee","recorded":1375069606,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Cooee&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Cooee&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Australia","/wiki/The_Bush","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/wiki/Darug_language","/wiki/Sydney","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Watkin_Tench","/wiki/Arthur_Conan_Doyle","/wiki/Sherlock_Holmes","/wiki/The_Boscombe_Valley_Mystery","/wiki/New_Zealand_English","/wiki/Australian_English","/wiki/Snowball_marches","/wiki/First_World_War","/wiki/Gilgandra","/wiki/New_South_Wales","/wiki/Sydney","/wiki/Casualty_(person)","#cite_note-2","/w/index.php?title=Cooee&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Cooee_framework","/w/index.php?title=Cooee&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-1","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0949757950","#cite_ref-2","http://www.abc.net.au/rn/hindsight/stories/2008/2405905.htm","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cooee&oldid=554260369","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Australian_culture","/wiki/Category:Australian_English","/wiki/Category:New_Zealand_English","/wiki/Category:Australian_Aboriginal_words_and_phrases","/wiki/Category:All_articles_with_unsourced_statements","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_unsourced_statements_from_January_2012","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Cooee&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Cooee","/wiki/Cooee","/wiki/Talk:Cooee","#","/wiki/Cooee","/w/index.php?title=Cooee&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Cooee&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Cooee","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Cooee","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Cooee&oldid=554260369","/w/index.php?title=Cooee&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5166838","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Cooee&id=554260369","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Cooee","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Cooee&oldid=554260369&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Cooee&printable=yes","//pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooee","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5166838#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooee","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":["person"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Australian
