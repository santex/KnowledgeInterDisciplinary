{"cursor":"11033","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n 'PhilomÃ© Obin' (July 20, 1892 â August 1986) was\na Haitian painter. He was arguably the greatest of all Haitian artistsâhis main\nrival for that accolade is fellow painter Hector Hyppolite.\n\nPhilomÃ© Obin was born in Cap-HaÃ¯tien, the third child of Mr. and Mrs. ObÃ©nard\nObin. He received rudimentary instruction in drawing as a boy and produced his\nfirst known painting in 1908. He was still working at his art three-quarters of\na century later.\n\nMost of the paintings of Obinâs first half-centuryâoften on cardboard,\nsometimes on Masoniteâare lost. They were, in any event, unappreciated by middle-\nclass Haitians who preferred works that aped French paintings; they did not\nvalue Obinâs representations of Haitian street scenes or his visions of\nHaitian history. The celebrated artist also painted murals and other\ndecorative pieces for commercial establishments, fraternal organizations, and\nProtestant chapels in the beginning. (In a country sometimes described as \"80\npercent Catholic and 100 percent voodoo\"âvoodoo means \"spirit\", given its West-\nAfrican originâObin was a fervent Baptist, who did not find the practice of\nvoodoo appealing. He had, however, flirt with occultism through the\nFreemasonry. As the 20th century neared its midpoint, PhilomÃ© Obin had never\nearned enough money for any of his work.\n\nBy 1944 the artist was in despair. \"Dear God,\" he wrote on a small blackboard in\nhis home, in Cap-Haitian, \"the year 1944 was a bad one for PhilomÃ© Obin. Please\nmake 1945 a better year for him.\" He had reason for hope. Word had reached him\nof the opening, earlier in 1944, of a Centre dâArt in Port-au-Prince, Haiti's\ndistant capital. The Centre had been established by Dewitt Peters, an American\nQuaker and conscientious objector who had been sent to Haiti by the U.S. Office\nof Education as an alternative to World War II military service. Seeing the\nimaginative works that decorated many voodoo temples, or ounfÃ² (), Peters, also\nan artist, suspected that the country harbored much talent waiting to be\ndiscovered. He resolved to find and promote it.\n\n\n\n\nPhilomÃ© Obin sent Peters, at the Centre d'Art, a small painting extolling U.S.\nPresident Franklin D. Roosevelt for ending the 1915â34 American Occupation of\nHaiti. Peters immediately recognized Obinâs genius; the small payment he sent\nthe artist was by far the largest Obin had ever received. (Obin would later\npaint at least three other paintings of FDR, one showing him with Winston\nChurchill and Joseph Stalin, another of an angelic Roosevelt \"interceding in\nheaven for the unity of the Americas.\") The two menâPeters and Obinâwould become\ngood friends over the years.\n\nSelden Rodman, a Peters's associate, visited Obin at his residence in Cap-\nHaÃ¯tien. Now, with his 1944 prayer answered, PhilomÃ© sent painting after\npainting to the Centre d'Art. Soon his fame was such that both art-lovers and\nsouvenir-hunting tourists were seeking him out. His prices rose steadily; by the\n1970s heâwho had sold works for a paltry sumâwas painting only on commission,\nasking and getting $1,000 to $3,000 for paintings the size of 20x24 inches.\n\nAmong the works of PhilomÃ©âs first four decades that have survived is Vision de\nl'Artiste PhilomÃ© Obin pendant la nuit du 15 au 16 Janvier 1948. (He never sold\nthat painting, which graced his living room until his death.) It shows a lovely\nmulatress seated on a boulder in a mostly barren landscape. Many have\nerroneously interpreted this painting, contending that it represents \"MaÃ®tresse\nZulie\", a voodoo goddess. The reality is that Obinâs dream was so vivid that he\ndecided to capture it on his canvas, this he explained to this editor in 1983.\nHe added that he found amusing the aura created by pundits around this\nparticular painting. Like most of his paintings, it bears both his boxed\nsignature and its title, in neat letters centered toward the bottom of the work.\n\nSome have seen a white woman, a blond, in that painting and have commented that\n\"that old man never saw a blond he didn't adore.\" This is a gross distortion of\nreality. Furthermore, if the artist has painted a \"kitschy bust of a blond\n[standing] on the balcony just outside the studio of his large, airy, and final\nhome,\" it is simply to capture with his masterful strokes the \"clients\", as he\nliked to call Americans and others, who have visited him. Unfortunately, he did\nnot paint Mrs. Jackie Onassis or President LÃ©opold Sedar Senghor, or even Alfred\nMÃ©traux, who paid him a visit in the late 1970s. Those who knew this artist very\nwell, found him to be impenetrable, at times. For example, it was not until\nafter his death that his children discovered in his safe some documentation\nwhich stated that he was a commissioned officerâa Captain in the Haitian army\nbefore the American Occupation.\n\nPhilomÃ© Obin always celebrated his birthday with fanfare, saying that on that\ndateâJuly 20âhe almost lost his life during one of the numerous Haitian\n\"revolutions.\" Strapped on a pole, with soldiers in front of him, ready to\nshoot, he was saved by an officer who came on the scene and had recognized\nhim. The officer ordered the soldiers to release him immediately because, as\nhe put it: \"PhilomÃ© Obin does not get involved in politics!\" Thus, his\nbirthday was a thanksgiving celebration: \"I must thank God for sparing my\nlife,\" he used to say.\n\nSometimes called a âsophisticated naif,â PhilomÃ© had an imperfect sense of\nperspective. If his use of perspective was often suspect, Obinâs work was always\nenchanting . His allegories are potent and carry strong messages. One of his\npaintings, âTrois gÃ©nÃ©rations,â illustrates this point very well. In the\npainting Obin shows three individuals with different types of vestments who\nrepresent, each, their own period. He wrote as usual at the center bottom:\nâAvant lâoccupation, durant lâoccupation, aprÃ¨s lâoccupationâ [Before, During,\nand After the American Occupation]. With the last person casually attired in the\npainting, it is clear that the painter wanted to demonstrate the American\ninfluence in Haiti. Although some people have qualified some of his works as\n\"static,\" his craftsmanship is always delicate and precise, and the detail in\nhis works is nothing but astonishing. He avoids the glare. His colors are muted,\nunlike those of most Haitian painters outside the northern part of the country.\n\nIn the north itself, Obinâs influence was so powerful that subtle coloring is a\nleading characteristic in the works of hundreds of artists that he himself had\ntrained and many others he hadnât. Among painters of the âCap-Haitian school,â\nhis brother SÃ©nÃ¨que (1896â1972) is also a major talent; several of PhilomÃ©âs\nchildren like Antoine Obin, TÃ©lÃ©maque Obin, grandchildren such as Claude Obin,\nMichaÃ«lle Obin, Henry-Claude Obin, Harisson Obin, Donald Obin, and nephews and\nnieces are also accomplished painters.\n\nIn 1919, Obin lived through the âcrucifixionâ of 'Charlemagne PÃ©ralte', a\nHaitian patriot who had opposed the American Occupation of Haiti. Betrayed by a\nfriend, whose family name was 'ConzÃ©', PÃ©ralte died in an ambush set by the\nU.S. Marines. His body was brought to Cap-Haitian, strapped to a door. It was\n'displayed' for several days under the hot tropical sun like a trophy in an\neffort to discourage further resistance. Though Obin hadn't witnessed the\nâcrucifixion,â he honored PÃ©ralte as a hero because Charlemagne stood against\nthe American Occupation. His renditions of PÃ©ralteâs defilement and of his\nfuneral are powerful works that reflect PhilomÃ©âs nationalist pride. (He\npainted at least two versions of the âcrucifixion,â and his granddaughter,\nMichaÃ«lle, has painted an allegorical scene showing Obin mourning in front of\nPÃ©ralteâs corpse.)\n\nThe Roman Catholic archbishopâs refusal to allow Haitians to adorn his\ncathedralâa decision he later regrettedâresulted in what may be the summit of\nnaif art. The murals by Obin and other artists make Sainte TrinitÃ©âthe Episcopal\nCathedral in Port-au-Princeâone of the highlights of any visit to Haiti. (âThank\nGod!, they painted Haitians,â the Episcopal bishop exclaimed when he saw the\nfirst completed murals.) PhilomÃ© labored for many months on his masterpiece,\nCrucifixion, the centerpiece of three murals that rise above the high altar.\nPhilomÃ© was justifiably proud of what many consider his greatest work. He much\ndisliked Port-au-Prince, however, and rarely visited the Haitian capital after\nhis masterpiece was finished.\n\nIn his life outside art, PhilomÃ© Obin was a bit of a lothario. The painter was\nmarried twice, however. His first wife, the love of his life, 'FÃ©licia FÃ©lix\nObin,' died very early. He had a daughter by her. This child who is now 85 years\nold (2006), never knew her mother, unfortunately. PhilomÃ© would later divorce\nhis second wife, the mother of Antoine and GÃ©rard Obin. Nonetheless, like many\nHaitians of his time, he had children by several other women\n\nIn the early 1980s, PhilomÃ© decided to visit the capitals of Europe, with the\nUnited States as his last stop. Passing through New York, he visited some of his\nold acquaintances. At City College, he was honored by his African American\ncongeners. On that day, Mrs Rosalind Jeffries, of the Museum of Modern Art,\ntalked about him with meritorious and lofty terms. This editor served as his\ninterpreter on that memorable occasion. Before he returned to Haiti, he told\nthis editor that his only regret was that he hadn't taken this trip earlier:\n\"I'm too old now, I won't be able to do it again.\" He would die in 1986.\n\nTwo decades after his death, works by PhilomÃ© Obin are sometimes available at\ngalleries in Port-au-Prince, Santo Domingo, Sotheby's in New York, and elsewhere\nthroughout the world, including the Internet. Prices typically range from\n$40,000 to $100,000 and more.\n\n\n{{Persondata \n| NAME = Obin, Philome ALTERNATIVE NAMES = SHORT DESCRIPTION = DATE OF BIRTH =\n| 1891 PLACE OF BIRTH = DATE OF DEATH =
