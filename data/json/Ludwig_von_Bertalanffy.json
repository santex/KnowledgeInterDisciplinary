GST is an interdisciplinary\npractice that describes systems with interacting components, applicable to\nbiology, cybernetics, and other fields. Bertalanffy proposed that the laws of\nthermodynamics applied to closed systems, but not necessarily to \"open systems,\"\nsuch as living things. His mathematical model of an organism's growth over time,\npublished in 1934, is still in use today.\n\nVon Bertalanffy grew up in Austria and subsequently worked in Vienna, London,\nCanada and the USA.\n","linknr":380,"url":"Ludwig_von_Bertalanffy","recorded":1362476896,"links":36,"instances":["abstract","business"],"pdf":["http://www.richardjung.cz/bert1.pdf","http://www.richardjung.cz/bert1.pdf","http://www.richardjung.cz/bert1.pdf"],"categories":["1901 births","1972 deaths","Austrian scientists","Austro-Hungarian scientists","Systems biologists","Systems scientists","Theoretical biologists","Austrian emigrants to the United States","University of Alberta faculty","Université de Montréal faculty","University of Ottawa faculty","Austrian people of Hungarian descent","Austrian nobility","Scientists from Vienna","People from Liesing"],"headings":["Biography","Work","See also","Publications","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/2/0/e208d1c0ea4919337100c61118206ebe.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/9/5/e/95e4a0e5a318bf25a30bd6d6afee92fe.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/9/a/0/9a02f3369a6f6444d8189ceed4082383.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/ab/PassiveAnalog.jpg/220px-PassiveAnalog.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/Complex-adaptive-system.jpg/32px-Complex-adaptive-system.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Wikiquote-logo-en.svg/40px-Wikiquote-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["administration","business"],["model","abstract"]],"members":["model","administration"],"related":["Vienna","Austria-Hungary","Buffalo,_New_York","United_States","University_of_Vienna","Biology","Systems_theory","Rudolf_Carnap","Gustav_Theodor_Fechner","Nicolai_Hartmann","Otto_Neurath","Moritz_Schlick","Russell_L._Ackoff","Kenneth_E._Boulding","Peter_Checkland","C._West_Churchman","Jay_Wright_Forrester","Ervin_László","James_Grier_Miller","Anatol_Rapoport","General_System_Theory","Atzgersdorf","Vienna","Buffalo,_New_York","Austria","Biology","Systems_theory","Biology","Cybernetics","Liesing","Vienna","Hungary","Klagenfurt","Graz","Vienna","Railway","Administration_(business)","Paul_Kammerer","University_of_Innsbruck","Philosophy_of_science","Biology","Gustav_Theodor_Fechner","University_of_Vienna","University_of_London","Université_de_Montréal","University_of_Ottawa","University_of_Southern_California","Menninger_Foundation","University_of_Alberta","University_at_Buffalo,_The_State_University_of_New_York","Heart_attack","General_systems_theory","Biology","Cybernetics","Education","History","Philosophy","Psychiatry","Psychology","Sociology","Cell_growth","Model_(abstract)","Differential_equation","Isomorph","Howard_T._Odum","Energy_Systems_Language","Systems_theory","Organization","Holism","Organism","Closed_system","Second_law_of_thermodynamics","Steady_state","Physical_system","Information_theory","Cybernetics","Biology","Applied_science","Generalization","Hypothesis","Physical_law","Social_science","Sociology","Feedback","Information","Communication","Anthropology","Economics","Political_science","Psychology","Population_dynamics","Systems_theory","General_Systems_Theory","Peter_Corning","Debora_Hammond","Ervin_László","Vienna","Austria","New_York","United_States"]}
