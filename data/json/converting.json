These rolls of material vary significantly in size and weight —\nranging from 2 to 200 in. wide and weighing as much as several tons. The\nconverting industry takes these continuous rolls of thin, flat materials — known\nas webs — threads them though processing machines (such as printing presses,\nlaminating, coating and slitting machines) and converts or changes the web of\nmaterial into an intermediate form or final product. For example, a converter’s\nequipment might take a web of plastic film, cut it into lengths, and fuse their\nedges, thus converting it into plastic bags. This activity is known as web\nprocessing.\n\nTypical converting processes are coating, laminating and printing. Coating\ntechnologies can include hot melt coating, gravure coating, curtain coating and\nslot die coating. The most common printing techniques are flexo printing and\nrotogravure (gravure)printing. Both print processes are suited to high speed\nroll to roll processing.\n\nMany converting companies will process large diameter, wide rolls of material as\nthis increases the converting efficiency by minimising changes. On completion of\nthe converting process the rolls are cut into smaller rolls on a slitting\nmachine. These rolls are then a convenient size for handling on packaging and\nother machines.\n\nWeb alignment is an important part of a converting operation as a moving web of\nmaterial has a tendency to track off course and wander out of alignment during\nconverting processes. To avoid these problems, engineers have developed a\nvariety of automatic web-guiding systems that assure production accuracy and\nreduce waste. Web-guiding systems typically are positioned just before a\ncritical stage on a converting machine (for example, just before a print station\non a printing press).\n\nEach type of web guiding system uses a sensor to monitor the web position for\nlateral tracking, and each has an actuator to shift the running web mechanically\nback on course whenever the sensor detects movement away from the set path.\nActuators may be pneumatic or hydraulic cylinders, or some kind of\nelectromechanical device. Because the web may be fragile — particularly at its\nedge — non-contact sensors are used. These sensors may be pneumatic,\nphotoelectric, ultrasonic, or infrared. The system’s controls must put the\noutput signals from the sensors in to a form that can drive the actuator. Many\ncontrols today are electronic, typically using an amplifier to convert signals\nfrom the sensor, then commanding a special servo motor incorporating a lead or\nball screw for guiding actuation. The latest web guiding systems have touch\nscreen controls to simplify the set up procedure. Some web guiding systems have\nbeen designed specifically for the Converting industry.\n","title":"Converters%20%28industry%29","headings":["Services","External links"]},"micro-relation":["2: Roll_slitting","1: Polyester","1: Silicone","1: Paper","1: Coating","1: Curtain_coating","1: Flexo","1: Rotogravure","1: Web-guiding_systems","1: Pneumatic_web_guides","1: Labels","1: Adhesive_tape","1: Release_liner","1: Printing_services"]}
