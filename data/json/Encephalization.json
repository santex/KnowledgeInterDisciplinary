Quantifying an animal's encephalization has been\nargued to be directly related to that animal's level of intelligence. Aristotle\nwrote in 335 B.C. \"Of all the animals, man has the brain largest in proportion\nto his size.\" Also, in 1871, Charles Darwin wrote in\nhis book [[The Descent of Man]]: \"No one, I presume, doubts that the large\nproportion which the size of man's brain bears to his body, compared to the same\nproportion in the gorilla or orang, is closely connected with his mental\npowers.\"\n\nIn 2004, Dennis Bramble and Daniel Lieberman proposed that early [[Homo\n(genus)|Homo]] were scavengers that used stone tools to harvest meat off\ncarcasses and to open bones. They proposed that humans specialized in long-\ndistance running to compete with other scavengers in reaching carcasses. It has been suggested that such an adaptation ensured a food\nsupply that made large brains possible.\n\nMore encephalized species tend to have longer spinal shock duration.\n\nEncephalization may also refer to the tendency for a species toward larger\nbrains through evolutionary time. Anthropological studies indicate that\nbipedalism preceded encephalization in the human evolutionary lineage after\ndivergence from the chimpanzee lineage. Compared to the chimpanzee brain, the\nhuman brain is larger and certain brain regions have been particularly altered\nduring human evolution. Most brain growth of chimpanzees\nhappens before birth while most human brain growth happens after birth. see: Heterochrony\n","linknr":192,"url":"Encephalization","recorded":1362373303,"links":22,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.clas.ufl.edu/users/krigbaum/proseminar/Bramble_Leib_2004_nature.pdf","http://www.clas.ufl.edu/users/krigbaum/proseminar/Bramble_Leib_2004_nature.pdf","http://nb.vse.cz/kfil/elogos/biocosmology/saniot07b.pdf"],"categories":["Evolutionary biology","Human evolution"],"headings":["Encephalization quotient","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/math/c/4/3/c43626f2a278511d6750425c661d4a2f.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/Tree_of_life.svg/32px-Tree_of_life.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c2/Human_evolution_scheme.svg/43px-Human_evolution_scheme.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/P_human_body.svg/30px-P_human_body.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Brain","Brain_to_body_mass_ratio","Intelligence","Charles_Darwin","Dennis_Bramble","Daniel_Lieberman","Human_brain","Spinal_shock","Antropology","Bipedal","Chimpanzee","Heterochrony","Allometry","Evolutionary_biology","Cephalization","Human_evolution","Human_brain"]}
