The\nmembers were Alan Brown (bass, vocals), Greg Keeffe (guitar) and Dil Green\n(drums). After a debut single (Sink) on their own Laughing Gun label, they\njoined the Ron Johnson roster for a series of mid-eighties singles as well as an\nappearance on the NME's C86 compilation.\n\nOn the reverse of the \"Two Kan Guru\" compilation, it was jokingly stated that\nGreen and Brown played in the original line up of Wham! with George Michael and\nAndrew Ridgeley; incredibly, this was accepted as fact by many people.\n\nIn addition to releasing 5 singles and a compilation EP, Big Flame also recorded\nfour sessions for the John Peel Show. Big Flame were a major influence on Manic\nStreet Preachers. In a 1991 interview, Richie Edwards stated \"The 80s, for us,\nwas the biggest non-event ever, like C86. All we had was Big Flame. Big Flame\nwas the most perfect band. But we couldn't play their records 'cos they were too\navant garde\". Gabriel, Clive (1991) \"Art is just short for\nArthur\", Lime Lizard, October 1991, Lime Lizard Ltd., ISSN 0961-8104\n\nThe group also operated beyond the confines of the band itself. Keeffe and Green\nhosted a night at Manchester's Man Alive club which they christened \"The Wilde\nClub\" providing a useful venue for groups other than their own. This spirit was\nalso reflected in Ugly Noise Undercurrents which was a band-swap concept\nconceived by Alan to provide emerging groups with a facility for securing gigs\nin towns and cities beyond their home base. The Allez Ugly newsletter was the\nprimary driver for this.\n\nAfter the band split in 1986, Brown joined Ron Johnson labelmates A Witness on\ndrums, touring the UK and Europe and appearing on several records (the 12\" EP\n'One Foot in the Groove' and Strange Fruit Double Peel Sessions) and three\nsessions for BBC Radio One DJ John Peel. He left A Witness in 1988 to form solo\nproject Great Leap Forward, while Keeffe joined Meatmouth (with Mark Whittam and\nNicholas Blincoe) who released \"Meatmouth is murder\" on Factory Records, Fac196.\n\nAfter a break from music, Alan Brown teamed up with Daren Garratt (of Pram) and\nVince Hunt (of A Witness) in the band Marshall Smith, releasing an album\n'Colours' in 2006 on the Euphonium label.\n\nIn 2007 Alan Brown joined Sarandon as bass player.\n\nGreg Keeffe is now Professor of sustainable architecture at Leeds Metropolitan\nUniversity, Leeds.\n\nDil Green is now an architect based in London.\n","linknr":114,"url":"Big_Flame_(band)","recorded":1375081364,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Big_Flame_(band)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Big_Flame_(band)&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Big_Flame_(band)&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Template:Citation_needed","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/Manchester","/wiki/Music_genre","/wiki/Indie_rock","/wiki/Post_punk","/wiki/Record_label","/wiki/Ron_Johnson_Records","/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward_(band)","http://www.bigflame.biz/","/wiki/Indie_rock","/wiki/Manchester","/wiki/Ron_Johnson_Records","/wiki/NME","/wiki/C86_(music)","/wiki/Wham!","/wiki/George_Michael","/wiki/John_Peel","/wiki/Manic_Street_Preachers","#cite_note-Gabriel-1","/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward_(band)","/wiki/Nicholas_Blincoe","/wiki/Factory_Records","/wiki/Pram_(band)","/wiki/A_Witness","/w/index.php?title=Marshall_Smith_(band)&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Sarandon_(band)","/wiki/Leeds_Metropolitan_University","/w/index.php?title=Big_Flame_(band)&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Compilation_album","/w/index.php?title=Big_Flame_(band)&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-Gabriel_1-0","/w/index.php?title=Big_Flame_(band)&action=edit&section=3","http://www.timewasting.net/ronj/index.html","http://www.myspace.com/bigflamemcr","http://www.bigflame.biz","http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/johnpeel/artists/b/bigflame/","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Big_Flame_(band)&oldid=553631008","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:English_rock_music_groups","/wiki/Category:Musical_groups_from_Manchester","/wiki/Category:Articles_needing_additional_references_from_October_2010","/wiki/Category:All_articles_needing_additional_references","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_hCards","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Big+Flame+%28band%29&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Big+Flame+%28band%29","/wiki/Big_Flame_(band)","/wiki/Talk:Big_Flame_(band)","#","/wiki/Big_Flame_(band)","/w/index.php?title=Big_Flame_(band)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Big_Flame_(band)&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Big_Flame_(band)","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Big_Flame_(band)","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Big_Flame_(band)&oldid=553631008","/w/index.php?title=Big_Flame_(band)&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2902225","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Big_Flame_%28band%29&id=553631008","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Big+Flame+%28band%29","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Big+Flame+%28band%29&oldid=553631008&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Big_Flame_(band)&printable=yes","//fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Flame","//ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Flame","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2902225#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Flame_(band)","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bi
