There are two types of rerunsâ€”those that occur during a hiatus,\nand those that occur when a program is syndicated. Reruns can also be, as the\ncase with more popular shows, when a show is aired outside of its timeslot (e.g.\nin the afternoon).\n\nIn the UK, the word \"repeat\" refers only to a single episode; \"rerun\" or\n\"rerunning\" is the preferred term for an entire series/season. \"Repeat\" is also\nused to refer to programs shown less than a week after the original broadcast,\nbefore the next episode of the series.\n\nThe term \"rerun\" can also be used in some respects as a synonym for [[reprint]],\nthe equivalent term for print items; this is especially true for print items\nthat are part of ongoing series (such as comic strips; [[Peanuts]], for\ninstance, has been in reruns since the retirement and death of creator Charles\nM. Schulz).\n","linknr":212,"url":"Rerun","recorded":1362898779,"links":21,"instances":["magnetic_tape","tv_channel","entertainment_industry","tv_channel","tv_network","tv_channel","tv_channel","television"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Television terminology"],"headings":["Reruns in the United States","Repeats in the United Kingdom","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["hiatus","television"],["residual","entertainment_industry"],["tbs","tv_channel"],["the_hub","tv_network"],["boomerang","tv_channel"],["pbj","tv_channel"],["gold","tv_channel"],["wiping","magnetic_tape"]],"members":["wiping","tbs","residual","boomerang","the_hub","pbj","gold","hiatus"],"related":["Radio","Television","Broadcasting","Hiatus_(television)","Broadcast_syndication","Dayparting","United_Kingdom","Comic_strip","Charles_M._Schulz","United_States","Kinescope","East_Coast_of_the_United_States","West_Coast_of_the_United_States","Videotape","Sweeps","Sweeps","Television_special","VCR","List_of_Peanuts_media","Holiday_season","Broadcast_syndication","Money","Cable_television","100_episodes","Residual_(entertainment_industry)","Satellite_television","Digital_subchannel","SyndEx","Monochrome","Radio_format","Oldies","Classic_rock","Classic_hits","Adult_standards","Public_domain","Nick_at_Nite","TV_Land","TBS_(TV_channel)","USA_Network","WGN_America","TV_Guide_Network","The_Hub_(TV_network)","Game_Show_Network","Boomerang_(TV_channel)","Nicktoons_Network","The_Inspiration_Network","RFD-TV","Hallmark_Channel","Digital_television","Retro_Television_Network","Antenna_TV","Me-TV","This_TV","PBJ_(TV_channel)","Low-power_broadcasting","Daystar_Television_Network","Situation_comedy","Game_show","Variety_show","Saturday_morning_cartoon","Newsmagazine","Late-night_talk_show","Reality_television","Niche_market","MSG_Network","ESPN_Classic","NFL_Network","DVD","Box_set","Television_series","Videotape","United_Kingdom","Soap_opera","BBC","ITV","Channel_4","Reality_television","Situation_comedy","United_Kingdom","Sky_Television_plc","Gold_(TV_channel)","Atlantic_Ocean","British_Actors'_Equity_Association","Wiping_(magnetic_tape)","Terrestrial_television","Re-version"]}
