For\nexample, the rules of the United Kingdom Houses of Parliament specify that a\nMember of Parliament cannot resign from office, but since the law also states\nthat a Member of Parliament who is appointed to a paid office of the Crown must\neither step down or stand for re-election, the effect of a resignation can be\naccomplished by appointment to such an office. The second rule is used to\ncircumvent the first rule.\n\nLegal fictions may be counterintuitive in the sense that one might not normally\nview a certain fact or idea as established in the course of everyday life, but\nthey are preserved to advance public policy and preserve the rights of certain\nindividuals and institutions. A common example of a legal fiction is a\ncorporation, which is regarded in many jurisdictions as a \"person\" who has many\nof the same legal rights and responsibilities as a natural person.\n\nLegal fictions are mostly encountered under common law systems.\n\nThe term \"legal fiction\" is not usually used in a pejorative way, and has been\nlikened to scaffolding around a building under construction.
