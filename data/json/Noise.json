Signal noise is heard as acoustic noise if the signal is\nconverted into sound (e.g., played through a loudspeaker); it manifests as\n\"snow\" on a television or video image. High noise levels can block, distort,\nchange or interfere with the meaning of a message in human, animal and\nelectronic communication.\n\nIn signal processing or computing noise can be considered random unwanted data\nwithout meaning; that is, data that is not being used to transmit a signal, but\nis simply produced as an unwanted by-product of other activities. \"Signal-to-\nnoise ratio\" is sometimes used to refer to the ratio of useful to irrelevant\ninformation in an exchange.\n\nIn biology, many different forms of cellular noise exist, where a measurement\ndisplays substantial variance around its mean: for example, transcriptional\nnoise describes the variability in gene activity between cells in a population.\n\nIn many cases, the special case of thermal noise arises, which sets a\nfundamental lower limit to what can be measured or signaled and is related to\nbasic physical processes described by thermodynamics, some of which are\nexpressible by simple formulae.\n\nIn some fields, noise means unwanted information or data that is not relevant to\nthe hypothesis or theory being investigated or tested.\n","linknr":350,"url":"Noise","recorded":1362674573,"links":68,"instances":["electronics","communication","telecommunication","telecommunication"],"pdf":["http://www.ieee.li/pdf/viewgraphs_mohr_noise.pdf"],"categories":["Noise|"],"headings":["Acoustic noise","Use in Music","Non-acoustic noise","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6d/Noise_Research_Program_on_Hangar_Apron_-_GPN-2000-001457.jpg/220px-Noise_Research_Program_on_Hangar_Apron_-_GPN-2000-001457.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/87/Gnome-mime-sound-openclipart.svg/50px-Gnome-mime-sound-openclipart.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Wikiquote-logo-en.svg/40px-Wikiquote-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["noise","electronics"],["signal","electronics"],["noise","video"],["noise","signal_processing"],["signaling","telecommunication"],["noise","electronic"],["noise","telecommunication"],["interference","communication"]],"members":["signal","interference","signaling","noise"],"related":["Glenn_Research_Center","Aircraft_engine","Sound","Physics","Analog_electronics","Noise_(electronics)","Signal_(electronics)","Radio","Loudspeaker","Noise_(video)","Television","Video","Signal_processing","Noise_(signal_processing)","Data","Signaling_(telecommunication)","Signal-to-noise_ratio","Cellular_noise","Transcriptional_noise","Thermal_noise","Thermodynamics","Public_transport","Earbud","Portable_audio_player","Jet_engine","Sound_intensity","Vibrations_of_a_circular_membrane","Broadcasting","Audio_engineering","Noise_(electronic)","Signal_noise","A-weighting","ITU-R_468_noise_weighting","Ren√©_Clair","Noise_(telecommunication)","Johnson_Noise","Random","Electric_current","Voltage","Signal_level","Radio_receiver","Thermal_noise","Radio_telescopes","Front-end","Low-noise_amplifier","Liquid_nitrogen","Shot_noise","Flicker_noise","Quantization","Communication_channel","Additive_white_gaussian_noise","Electromagnetic_interference","Crosstalk","Interference_(communication)","Phase_modulation","Frequency_modulation","Phase_noise","Mobility_model","Fading","Doppler_shift","Jamming","Color_banding","Perlin_noise","Ambient_Vibrations","Frequency_range","Transcriptional_noise","Antibiotics","Association_of_Noise_Consultants","Background_noise","Noise_and_vibration_on_maritime_vessels","Noise_music","Noise_pollution","Silence","EU-OSHA"]}
