An anionic surfactant detected by the color reaction is called a\nmethylene blue active substance (MBAS). Alison L. George, Graham F.

The biphasic solution is\nthen agitated to distribute these reagents throughout the aqueous and organic\nphases. If an anionic surfactant is present, then the\ncationic methylene blue and the anionic surfactant forms an ion pair, which is\nextracted into the organic phase. The color of the chloroform increases with\nincreasing concentration of surfactants.\n\nMBAS assay is an ASTM International standard technique for detecting anionic\nsurfactants.

An MBAS assay alone\ndoes not, however, identify specific surfactants. ASTM withdrew the standard\n(ASTM D2330-02) in 2011 pending a review and update of the method, which was\nlast approved in 2003.\n\nStandard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater list the following\nmethods used by certified laboratories testing wastewater in the United\nStates: [http://www.standardmethods.org/store/ProductView.cfm?ProductID=43\nStandard Methods: 5540 Surfactants]\n\n*Method 5540B describes surfactant separation by sublation. *Method 5540C\ndiscusses anionic surfactants as methylene blue active substances (MBAS).\n*Method 5540D discusses nonionic surfactants as cobalt thiocyanate active\nsubstances (CTAS).\n","linknr":122,"url":"MBAS_assay","recorded":1362512420,"links":13,"instances":["device"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Analytical chemistry","Anionic surfactants","Water pollution"],"headings":["See also","Notes","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/59/Nuvola_apps_edu_science.svg/35px-Nuvola_apps_edu_science.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["agitator","device"]],"members":["agitator"],"related":["Colorimetric_analysis","Test_method","Methylene_blue","Anionic","Surfactant","Detergent","Foaming_agent","Water","Color_reaction","Boric_acid","Chloroform","Solution","Cationic","Dye","Biphasic","Agitator_(device)","Reagent","ASTM_International","Carboxylate","Phosphate","Sulfate","Sulfonate","Colorimetry","Water_chemistry_analysis","Water_testing"]}
