Its name means \"earth wolf\" in the Afrikaans /\nDutch language.<ref name=\"enc_bri\"></ref> It is also called \"maanhaar\njackal\".<ref name=\"OED\">[http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/00298717 maanhaar]\nin the Oxford English Dictionary</ref> The aardwolf is in the same family as the\nhyenas. Unlike its relatives, the carnivora, the aardwolf does not hunt large\nanimals, or even eat meat on a regular basis; instead it eats insects, mainly\ntermites - one aardwolf can eat about 200,000 termites during a single night by\nusing its long, sticky tongue to capture them.\n\nThe aardwolf is the only surviving species in the mammalian subfamily\n'Protelinae'. There are two subspecies: Proteles cristatus cristatus of Southern\nAfrica and Proteles cristatus septentrionalis of East Africa.<ref name=\"eb\">[http://search.eb.com/eb/article-\n9003205 \"aardwolf.\"] [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]. 8 Jan.\n2007</ref><ref>[http://www4.ncsu.edu/~jkim2/MolEvo/Spring2006/hyaenidae.pdf\nMolecular systematics of the Hyaenidae]</ref>\n\nThe aardwolf is usually classified with the Hyaenidae, though it was formerly\nplaced into the family 'Protelidae'. The aardwolf lives in the scrublands of\neastern and southern Africa - these are open lands covered with stunted trees\nand shrubs. Aardwolves usually hide in burrows during the day, and then they\ncome out at night to seek food. Their diet nearly always consists of termites,\ninsect larvae, and the carrion of larger animals.<ref name=\"wff\"></ref>\n",
