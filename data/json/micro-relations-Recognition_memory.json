When the previously experienced event is\nreexperienced, this environmental content is matched to stored memory\nrepresentations, eliciting matching signals. (Norman & O'Reilly, 2003)\n\nRecognition memory can be subdivided into two component processes: recollection\nand familiarity, sometimes referred to as \"remembering\" and \"knowing\",\nrespectively. Medina, J. J. (2008). The biology\nof recognition memory. Psychiatric Times. Retrieved March 14, 2009, from\nhttp://www.brainrules.net/pdf/JohnMedina_PsychTimes_June08.pdf\nRecollection is the retrieval of details associated with the previously\nexperienced event. In contrast, familiarity is the feeling that the event was\npreviously experienced, without recollection. Thus, the fundamental distinction\nbetween the two processes is that recollection is a slow, controlled search\nprocess, whereas familiarity is a fast, automatic process. Mandler G. Recognizing: The judgment of previous occurrence. (1980).\nPsych Rev. 87, 252â271. \n\nMandler's \"Butcher-on-the-bus\" example:\n\nImagine taking a seat on a crowded bus. You look to your left and notice a man.\nImmediately, you are overcome with this sense that you've seen this man before,\nbut you cannot remember who he is. This automatically elicited feeling is\nfamiliarity. While trying to remember who this man is, you begin retrieving\nspecific details about your previous encounter. For example, you might remember\nthat this man handed you a fine chop of meat in the grocery store. Or perhaps\nyou remember him wearing an apron. This search process is recollection.\n","linknr":646,"url":"Recognition_memory","recorded":1362670571,"links":16,"instances":["memory","sense","anatomy"],"pdf":["http://www.brainrules.net/pdf/JohnMedina_PsychTimes_June08.pdf","http://www.columbia.edu/~nvg1/Wickelgren/papers/1969_NormaWAW.pdf","http://www.columbia.edu/~nvg1/Wickelgren/papers/1969_NormaWAW.pdf"],"categories":["Memory processes"],"headings":["Historical overview","Measurement and methods","Factors in recognition accuracy","Neural underpinnings","Applications","Notes"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/Gray727.svg/220px-Gray727.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/Gray728.svg/220px-Gray728.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["organ","anatomy"],["recall","memory"],["hearing","sense"],["anatomical_terms_of_location#left_and_right","lateral,_and_medial"]],"members":["recall","hearing","organ"],"related":["Declarative_memory","Recollection","Psychology","Wilhelm_Wundt","Brain","Organ_(anatomy)","Recall_(memory)","Introspection","George_Mandler","Amnesia","Hermann_von_Helmholtz","Franciscus_Donders","Decision_making","Detection_theory","Distinctive_feature","Neural_encoding","State-dependent_learning","Recollection","Sound","Visual_system","Deese–Roediger–McDermott_paradigm","Ventral_stream","Temporal_lobe","Frontal_lobe","Hippocampus","Prefrontal_cortex","Fusiform_face_area","Sense","Hearing_(sense)","Olfaction","Gustation","Tactition","Entorhinal","Orbitofrontal_cortex","Cholinergic","Neurotransmission","Perirhinal_cortex","Taste_aversion","Fusiform_gyrus","Fusiform_Face_Area","Face_perception","Parahippocampal_place_area","Parahippocampal_gyrus","Agnosia","Temporal_lobe","Hippocampus","Memory_consolidation","Procedural_memory","Declarative_memory","Agnosia","Occipital_Lobe","Agnosia","Integrative_agnosia","Temporal_lobe","Neuroimaging","Parietal_lobe","Positron_emission_tomography","Functional_magnetic_resonance_imaging","Precuneus","Source-monitoring_error","Recollection","Top-down_and_bottom-up_design","Qualitative_data","Decision_making","Detection_theory","Temporal_lobe","Hippocampus","Parahippocampal_gyrus","Entorhinal_cortex","Frontal_lobe","Evolution","Decision_making","Perirhinal_cortex","Neuron","Hippocampus","Perirhinal_cortex"]}
