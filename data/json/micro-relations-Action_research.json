It sometimes called participatory\naction research.\n\nAction research involves the process of actively participating in an\norganization change situation whilst conducting research. Action research can\nalso be undertaken by larger organizations or institutions, assisted or guided\nby professional researchers, with the aim of improving their strategies,\npractices and knowledge of the environments within which they practice. As\ndesigners and stakeholders, researchers work with others to propose a new course\nof action to help their community improve its work practices.\n\nKurt Lewin, then a professor at MIT, first coined the term âaction researchâ in\n1944. In his 1946 paper âAction Research and Minority Problemsâ he described\naction research as âa comparative research on the conditions and effects of\nvarious forms of social action and research leading to social actionâ that uses\nâa spiral of steps, each of which is composed of a circle of planning, action\nand fact-finding about the result of the actionâ.\n","linknr":209,"url":"Action_research","recorded":1362476927,"links":29,"instances":["journal"],"pdf":["http://www.comp.dit.ie/dgordon/Courses/ILT/ILT0003/ActionResearchandMinortyProblems.pdf"],"categories":["Research","Social sciences methodology"],"headings":["Overview","Major theories","Action research in organization development","See also","References","Bibliography","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c5/Systems_Model_of_Action-Research_Process.jpg/450px-Systems_Model_of_Action-Research_Process.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/Wikiversity-logo.svg/40px-Wikiversity-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Wikiquote-logo-en.svg/40px-Wikiquote-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["action_research","journal"]],"members":["action_research"],"related":["Reflective_process","Problem_solving","Community_of_practice","Participatory_action_research","Kurt_Lewin","MIT","Chris_Argyris","Environment_variable","Single_loop_learning","Double_loop_learning","John_Heron","Peter_Reason_and_Demi_Brown","Paulo_Freire","Orlando_Fals_Borda","Developmental_Action_Inquiry","Living_theory_approach","Organization_development","Kurt_Lewin","Action_learning","Action_Medical_Research","Action_Research_(journal)","Appreciative_Inquiry","Lesson_study","Praxis_intervention","Reflective_practice","Maris_Martinsons","Ned_Kock","Davydd_Greenwood","Exemplar","Education_Resources_Information_Center","Columbus,_Ohio"]}
