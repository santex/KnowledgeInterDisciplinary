There are four boundary commissions in the United Kingdom: one each\nfor England, Scotland, Wales (), and Northern Ireland.\n\nThere are four members of each Commission, of which three actually take part in\nmeetings. The Speaker of the House of Commons is the ex officio Chairman of each\nBoundary Commission, though he takes no part in the proceedings. The Deputy\nChairman of a Commission, who presides over Commission meetings, is always a\nJustice in a British court.\n","linknr":189,"url":"Boundary_Commission_(United_Kingdom)","recorded":1375081202,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Boundary_Commissions_(United_Kingdom)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Boundary_Commissions_(United_Kingdom)&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","/wiki/Boundary_Commissions_(United_Kingdom)","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","/w/index.php?title=Boundary_Commission_(United_Kingdom)&redirect=no","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Non-departmental_public_bodies","/wiki/Border","/wiki/Constituency","/wiki/UK_Parliament","/wiki/Scottish_Parliament","/wiki/National_Assembly_for_Wales","/wiki/England","/wiki/Scotland","/wiki/Wales","/wiki/Welsh_language","/wiki/Northern_Ireland","/wiki/Speaker_of_the_British_House_of_Commons","#Legislation","#United_Kingdom_Parliament_constituencies","#Considerations_and_process","#Previous_reviews_of_UK_Parliament_constituencies","#Devolved_parliaments_and_assemblies","#Implementation_of_recommendations","#Relationship_with_local_government_functions","#See_also","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Boundary_Commissions_(United_Kingdom)&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Parliamentary_Constituencies_Act_1986","/wiki/Parliamentary_Voting_System_and_Constituencies_Act_2011","/wiki/House_of_Commons_(Redistribution_of_Seats)_Act_1944","/wiki/House_of_Commons_(Redistribution_of_Seats)_Act_1949","/wiki/Political_Parties,_Elections_and_Referendums_Act_2000","/wiki/Electoral_Commission_(United_Kingdom)","/wiki/Local_Democracy,_Economic_Development_and_Construction_Act_2009","/w/index.php?title=Boundary_Commissions_(United_Kingdom)&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Sixth_Periodic_Review_of_Westminster_constituencies","#cite_note-1","#cite_note-2","#cite_note-3","#cite_note-4","/w/index.php?title=Boundary_Commissions_(United_Kingdom)&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/Orkney","/wiki/Shetland","/wiki/Outer_Hebrides","/wiki/Isle_of_Wight","/wiki/Local_government_in_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Local_Governance_(Scotland)_Act_2004","#cite_note-5","/w/index.php?title=Boundary_Commissions_(United_Kingdom)&action=edit&section=4","#cite_note-6","#cite_note-7","#cite_note-8","#cite_note-9","/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_2010","#cite_note-10","/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_2005","/wiki/City_of_London","/wiki/Orkney","/wiki/Shetland","#cite_note-11","/w/index.php?title=Boundary_Commissions_(United_Kingdom)&action=edit&section=5","/wiki/Scottish_Parliament","/wiki/Scotland_Act_1998","#cite_note-12","/wiki/Scottish_Parliament_constituencies_and_regions_from_2011","/wiki/Government_of_Wales_Act_2006","/wiki/National_Assembly_for_Wales","/wiki/National_Assembly_for_Wales_constituencies_and_electoral_regions","/wiki/Parliamentary_Voting_System_and_Constituencies_Act_2011","/wiki/Northern_Ireland_Assembly","/w/index.php?title=Boundary_Commissions_(United_Kingdom)&action=edit&section=6","/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/British_monarchy","/wiki/Secretary_of_State","/wiki/Gerrymandering","/w/index.php?title=Boundary_Commissions_(United_Kingdom)&action=edit&section=7","/wiki/Local_Government_Boundary_Commission_for_Scotland","/wiki/Local_Government_Boundary_Commission_for_Wales","/wiki/Local_Government_Boundary_Commission_for_England","/w/index.php?title=Boundary_Commissions_(United_Kingdom)&action=edit&section=8","/wiki/Electoral_Affairs_Commission","/wiki/Hong_Kong","/wiki/Irish_Boundary_Commission","/wiki/Irish_Free_State","/wiki/Northern_Ireland","/w/index.php?title=Boundary_Commissions_(United_Kingdom)&action=edit&section=9","#cite_ref-1","http://www.boundarycommissionforengland.org.uk/news/news.htm","#cite_ref-2","http://www.bcomm-scotland.gov.uk/6th_westminster/","#cite_ref-3","http://www.bcomm-wales.gov.uk/sixth_review_e.htm","#cite_ref-4","http://www.boundarycommission.org.uk/","#cite_ref-5","http://www.epolitix.com/latestnews/article-detail/newsarticle/boundary-changes-favour-tories/","#cite_ref-6","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Boundary_Commissions_(United_Kingdom)&action=edit","#cite_ref-7","http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2006/1041/contents/made","#cite_ref-8","http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2007/1681/contents/made","#cite_ref-9","http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2008/1486/contents/made","#cite_ref-10","http://www.legislation
