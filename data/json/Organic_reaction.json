Strategic Applications of Named Reactions in Organic Synthesis\nLaszlo Kurti, Barbara Czako Academic Press (March 4, '2005') ISBN 0-12-429785-\n4 The basic organic chemistry reaction types are addition reactions,\nelimination reactions, substitution reactions, pericyclic reactions,\nrearrangement reactions, photochemical reactions and redox reactions. In organic\nsynthesis, organic reactions are used in the construction of new organic\nmolecules. The production of many man-made chemicals such as drugs, plastics,\nfood additives, fabrics depend on organic reactions.\n\nThe oldest organic reactions are combustion of organic fuels and saponification\nof fats to make soap. Modern organic chemistry starts with the WÃ¶hler synthesis\nin 1828. In the history of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry awards have been given\nfor the invention of specific organic reactions such as the Grignard reaction in\n1912, the Diels-Alder reaction in 1950, the Wittig reaction in 1979 and olefin\nmetathesis in 2005.\n","linknr":406,"url":"Organic_reaction","recorded":1362504719,"links":24,"instances":["chemistry","chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Organic chemistry","Organic reactions|"],"headings":["Classifications","Fundamentals","Organic reactions by mechanism","Organic reactions by functional groups","Other organic reaction classification","See also","External links","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/69/Claisen_Rearrangement_Scheme.png/400px-Claisen_Rearrangement_Scheme.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["base","chemistry"],["radical","chemistry"]],"members":["base","radical"],"related":["Chemical_reaction","Organic_compound","Organic_chemistry","Addition_reaction","Elimination_reaction","Substitution_reaction","Pericyclic_reaction","Rearrangement_reaction","Mechanistic_Organic_Photochemistry","Organic_redox_reaction","Organic_synthesis","Combustion","Saponification","Organic_chemistry","Wöhler_synthesis","Nobel_Prize_in_Chemistry","Grignard_reaction","Diels-Alder_reaction","Wittig_reaction","Olefin_metathesis","List_of_organic_reactions","Claisen_rearrangement","Bingel_reaction","Corey-House-Posner-Whitesides_reaction","CBS_reduction","Ene_reaction","Aldol_reaction","Organic_reagent","Inorganic_compound","Oxidizing_agent","Osmium_tetroxide","Reducing_agent","Lithium_aluminium_hydride","Base_(chemistry)","Lithium_diisopropylamide","Acid","Sulfuric_acid","Chemical_reaction","Conjugated_system","Hyperconjugation","Aromaticity","Reactive_intermediate","Radical_(chemistry)","Carbocation","Carbanion","Isomer","Regioselectivity","Diastereoselectivity","Enantioselectivity","Stereochemistry","Pericyclic_reaction","Woodward-Hoffmann_rules","Elimination_reaction","Zaitsev's_rule","Medication","Alkylation","Protective_group","Carbon-carbon_bond","Functional_group_interconversion","Reaction_mechanism","Addition_reaction","Electrophilic_addition","Halogenation","Hydrohalogenation","Hydration_reaction","Nucleophilic_addition","Radical_addition","Elimination_reaction","Dehydration_reaction","E1cB_elimination_reaction","Reaction_mechanism","Substitution_reaction","Nucleophilic_substitution","SN1_reaction","SN2_reaction","Reaction_mechanism","Nucleophilic_aromatic_substitution","Nucleophilic_acyl_substitution","Electrophilic_substitution","Electrophilic_aromatic_substitution","Radical_substitution","Organic_redox_reaction","Redox_reaction","Organic_compound","Rearrangement_reaction","1,2-rearrangement","Pericyclic","Olefin_metathesis","Condensation_reaction","Water","Reactant","Hydrolysis","Polymerization","Addition_polymerization","Step-growth_polymerization","Arrow_pushing","Functional_group","Fries_rearrangement","Ester","Alcohol","Alkyl_nitrites","Alkyl_nitrites","Heterocyclic_chemistry","Indole","Ring_expansion_and_ring_contraction","Homologation_reaction","Polymerization_reaction","Insertion_reaction","Ring-opening_reaction","Ring-closing_reaction","Organosilicon","Organosulfur_chemistry","Organophosphorus_chemistry","Organofluorine_chemistry","Organometallic_chemistry","List_of_organic_reactions","Inorganic_chemical_reaction","Metabolism","Organometallic_chemistry","Polymerization_reaction"]}
