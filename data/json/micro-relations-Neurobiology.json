{"cursor":"36167","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n (1899) of neurons in the pigeon cerebellum]] 'Neuroscience' is the scientific\n study of the nervous system. Traditionally, neuroscience has been\n seen as a branch of biology. However, it is currently an interdisciplinary\n science that collaborates with other fields such as chemistry, computer\n science, engineering, linguistics, mathematics, medicine and allied\n disciplines, philosophy, physics, and psychology. The term 'neurobiology' is\n usually used interchangeably with the term neuroscience, although the former\n refers specifically to the biology of the nervous system, whereas the latter\n refers to the entire science of the nervous system.\n\nThe scope of neuroscience has broadened to include different approaches used to\nstudy the molecular, cellular, developmental, structural, functional,\nevolutionary, computational, and medical aspects of the nervous system. The\ntechniques used by neuroscientists have also expanded enormously, from molecular\nand cellular studies of individual nerve cells to imaging of sensory and motor\ntasks in the brain. Recent theoretical advances in neuroscience have also been\naided by the study of neural networks.\n\nBecause of the increasing number of scientists who study the nervous system,\nseveral prominent neuroscience organizations have been formed to provide a forum\nto all neuroscientists and educators. For example, the International Brain\nResearch Organization was founded in 1960, the International Society\nfor Neurochemistry in\n1963, [http://www.neurochemistry.org/Information/History/TheBeginning.aspx\nThe Beginning], International Society for Neurochemistry the European\nBrain and Behaviour Society in 1968, and the Society for Neuroscience\nin 1969.\n","linknr":1077,"url":"Neurobiology","recorded":1362510138,"links":86,"instances":["publishers","psychology","brain","biology","biology"],"pdf":["http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/psych205-2.2.pdf","http://www.sfn.org/skins/main/pdf/annual_report/fy2010/highlights.pdf","http://www.sfn.org/skins/main/pdf/annual_report/fy2010/highlights.pdf"],"categories":["Branches
