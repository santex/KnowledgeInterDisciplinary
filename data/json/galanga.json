(Lao: \"kha\"; \"kha\" ; Indonesian/Malay: lengkuas\n(Alpinia galanga); Mandarin: åè or é«è¯è (traditional), åå§ or é«è¯å§(simplified), nÃ¡n\njiÄng or gÄo liÃ¡ng jiÄng (Pinyin) or ; Cantonese: èè laam4 goeng1 (Jyutping) ;\nVietnamese: riá»ng ).\n\nThe rhizomes are used in various Asian cuisines (for example in Thai and Lao tom\nyum and tom kha gai soups, Vietnamese Huáº¿ cuisine (tre) and throughout\nIndonesian cuisine, for example, in soto). Though it is related to and resembles\nginger, there is little similarity in taste.\n\nIn its raw form, galangals have a stronger taste than common ginger. They are\navailable as a whole rhizome, cut or powdered. The whole fresh rhizome is very\nhard, and slicing it requires a sharp knife. A mixture of galangal and lime\njuice is used as a tonic in parts of Southeast Asia. In the Indonesian language,\nthe greater galangal and lesser galangal are both called lengkuas or\n{{lang|id|laos}}, while [[Kaempferia galanga]] is known as kencur. It is also\nknown as galanggal, and somewhat confusingly galingale, which is also the name\nfor several plants of the unrelated [[Cyperus]] genus of sedges (also with\naromatic rhizomes). In Thai language, greater galangal is called \"à¸à¹à¸²\" (kha) or\n\"à¸à¹à¸²à¹à¸«à¸à¹\" (kha yai), while lesser galangal is called \"à¸à¹à¸²à¸à¸²à¹à¸à¸\" (kha ta daeng).\nIn Vietnamese, greater galangal is called riá»ng náº¿p and lesser galangal is\ncalled riá»ng thuá»c.\n\nThe word galangal, or its variant galanga, in common usage can refer to four\nplant species all in the Zingiberaceae (ginger family):\n\n*[[Alpinia galanga]] or greater galangal *[[Alpinia officinarum]] or lesser\ngalangal *[[Kaempferia galanga]], also called kencur, aromatic gingerorsand\nginger'' *[[Boesenbergia rotunda]], also called Chinese ginger or fingerroot\n\nPolish vodka Zoladkowa Gorzka is flavoured with galanga.\n","linknr":341,"url":"galanga","recorded":1362512880,"links":27,"instances":["food"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Medicinal plants","Zingiberaceae","Spices","Thai cuisine","Lao cuisine","Vietnamese cuisine","Indonesian cuisine"],"headings":["References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/Galangal.web.jpg/250px-Galangal.web.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/69/Galangal_ready_for_preparation.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Alpinia_officinarum_-_K%C3%B6hler%E2%80%93s_Medizinal-Pflanzen-156.jpg/200px-Alpinia_officinarum_-_K%C3%B6hler%E2%80%93s_Medizinal-Pflanzen-156.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["soto","food"]],"members":["soto"],"related":["Rhizome","Zingiberaceae","Indonesia","Lao_language","Pinyin","Jyutping","Thai_cuisine","Lao_cuisine","Tom_yum","Tom_kha_gai","Huế","Indonesian_cuisine","Soto_(food)","Ginger_root","Indonesian_language","Greater_galangal","Lesser_galangal","Genus","Cyperaceae","Thai_language","Zingiberaceae","Wódka_Żołądkowa_Gorzka"]}
