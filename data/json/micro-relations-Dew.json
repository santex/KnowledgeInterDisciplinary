As the exposed surface cools by radiating its heat,\natmospheric moisture condenses at a rate greater than that at which it can\nevaporate, resulting in the formation of water droplets.\n\nWhen temperatures are low enough, dew takes the form of ice; this form is called\nfrost (frost is, however, not frozen dew).\n\nBecause dew is related to the temperature of surfaces, in late summer it is\nformed most easily on surfaces which are not warmed by conducted heat from deep\nground, such as grass, leaves, railings, car roofs, and bridges.\n\nDew should not be confused with guttation, which is the process by which plants\nrelease excess water from the tips of their leaves.\n","linknr":234,"url":"Dew","recorded":1362372232,"links":88,"instances":["ecology","meteorology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Psychrometrics","Atmospheric thermodynamics","Precipitation"],"headings":["Formation","Occurrence","Measurement","Significance","Artificial harvesting","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Dew_drop.jpg/220px-Dew_drop.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/Spider_web_with_dew_drops.jpg/220px-Spider_web_with_dew_drops.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8c/Dew_on_a_leaf.JPG/220px-Dew_on_a_leaf.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Wikiquote-logo-en.svg/40px-Wikiquote-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["precipitation","meteorology"],["habitat","ecology"]],"members":["habitat","precipitation"],"related":["Thermal_radiation","Condensation","Evaporation","Frost","Guttation","Temperature","Dew_point","Precipitation_(meteorology)","Condensation_nuclei","Fog","Clouds","Infrared","Radiation","Solar_radiation","Thermal_conductivity","Distillation","Condensation","Drosometer","Lysimeter","Guttation","Distillation","Radiation_balance","Atacama_Desert","Namib","Fog","Habitat_(ecology)","Pathogen","Phytophthora_infestans","Ersa","Hebrew_language","Judaism","Passover","Sukkot","Amidah","Midrash","Ukraine","Dew_pond","Lanzarote","International_Organisation_for_Dew_Utilization","Indian_Institute_of_Management_Ahmedabad","International_Organisation_for_Dew_Utilization","Kutch"]}
