They are widely distributed throughout the\nanimal and plant kingdoms and are found in many subcellular organelles, in\ncytoplasm, and as membrane components. Aminopeptidases are used in essential\ncellular functions. Many, but not all, of these peptidases are zinc\nMetalloenzymes.\n\nSome aminopeptidases are monomeric, and others are assemblies of relatively high\nmass (50 kDa) subunits. CDNA sequences are available for several aminopeptidases\nand a crystal structure of the open state of human endoplasmic reticulum\nAminopeptidase 1 ERAP1 is presented here. Amino acid sequences\ndetermined directly or deduced from cDNAs indicate some amino acid sequence\nhomologies in organisms as diverse as Escherichia coli and mammals, particularly\nin catalytically important residues or in residues involved in metal ion\nbinding.\n\nOne important aminopeptidase is a zinc-dependent enzyme produced and secreted by\nglands of the small intestine. It helps the enzymatic digestion of proteins.\nAdditional digestive enzymes produced by these glands include dipeptidases,\nmaltase, sucrase, lactase, and enterokinase.\n","linknr":249,"url":"Aminopeptidase","recorded":1362484405,"links":20,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Zinc proteins"],"headings":["See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/99/3QNF.pdb.png/300px-3QNF.pdb.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d9/PBB_GE_PNPLA6_203718_at_tn.png/60px-PBB_GE_PNPLA6_203718_at_tn.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Amino_acids","Metalloenzymes","Monomeric","CDNA","Zinc","Enzyme","Small_intestine","Dipeptidases","Maltase","Sucrase","Lactase","Enterokinase","Alanine_aminopeptidase"]}
