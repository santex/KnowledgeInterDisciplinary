It is the\nmeaningful exchange of information between two or a group of person.\n\nOne definition of communication is “any act by which one person gives to or\nreceives from another person information about that person's needs, desires,\nperceptions, knowledge, or affective states. Communication may be intentional or\nunintentional, may involve conventional or unconventional signals, may take\nlinguistic or nonlinguistic forms, and may occur through spoken or other\nmodes.”<ref>de Valenzuela, Julia Scherba. (1992). American Speech-Language-\nHearing Association (ASHA): [http://www.asha.org/policy/GL1992-00201.htm\nGuidelines for Meeting the Communication Needs of Persons With Severe\nDisabilities]</ref>\n\nCommunication requires a sender, a message, and a recipient, although the\nreceiver doesn't have to be present or aware of the sender's intent to\ncommunicate at the time of communication; thus communication can occur across\nvast distances in time and space. Communication requires that the communicating\nparties share an area of communicative commonality. The communication process is\ncomplete once the receiver has understood the message of the sender.\n",
