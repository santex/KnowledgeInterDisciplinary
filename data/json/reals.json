The real numbers include all the rational numbers, such as\nthe integer −5 and the fraction 4/3, and all the irrational numbers such as √\n(1.41421356… the square root of two, an irrational algebraic number) and π\n(3.14159265…, a transcendental number). Real numbers can be thought of as points\non an infinitely long line called the number line or real line, where the points\ncorresponding to integers are equally spaced. Any real number can be determined\nby a possibly infinite decimal representation such as that of 8.632, where each\nconsecutive digit is measured in units one tenth the size of the previous one.\nThe real line can be thought of as a part of the complex plane, and\ncorrespondingly, complex numbers include real numbers as a special case.\n\nThese descriptions of the real numbers are not sufficiently rigorous by the\nmodern standards of pure mathematics. The discovery of a suitably rigorous\ndefinition of the real numbers — indeed, the realization that a better\ndefinition was needed — was one of the most important developments of 19th\ncentury mathematics. The currently standard axiomatic definition is that real\nnumbers form the unique Archimedean complete totally ordered field up to\nisomorphism,<ref>More precisely, given two complete totally ordered fields,\nthere is a unique isomorphism between them. This implies that the identity is\nthe unique field automorphism of the reals that is compatible with the\nordering.</ref> whereas popular constructive definitions of real numbers include\ndeclaring them as equivalence classes of Cauchy sequences of rational numbers,\nDedekind cuts, or certain infinite \"decimal representations\", together with\nprecise interpretations for the arithmetic operations and the order relation.\nThese definitions are equivalent in the realm of classical mathematics.\n\nThe reals are uncountable, that is, while both the set of all natural numbers\nand the set of all real numbers are infinite sets, there can be no one-to-one\nfunction from the real numbers to the natural numbers: the cardinality of the\nset of all real numbers (denoted <math>\\mathfrak c</math> and called cardinality\nof the continuum) is strictly greater than the cardinality of the set of all\nnatural numbers (denoted <math>\\aleph_0</math>). The statement that there is no\nsubset of the reals with cardinality strictly greater than <math>\\aleph_0</math>\nand strictly smaller than <math>\\mathfrak c</math> is known as the continuum\nhypothesis. It is known to be neither provable nor refutable using the axioms of\nZermelo–Fraenkel set theory, the standard foundation of modern mathematics,\nprovided ZF set theory is consistent.\n","title":"Real%20number","headings":["Basic properties","In physics","In computation","Notation","History","Definition","Properties","Generalizations and extensions","\"Reals\" in set theory","Real numbers and logic","See also","Notes","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["7: Total_order","5: Square_root","4: Irrational_number","4: Algebraic_number","4: Transcendental_number","3: Rational_number","3: Complex_number","3: Isomorphism","3: Continuum_hypothesis","3: Ordered_field","3: Metric_space","3: Hyperreal_number","2: Integer","2: Real_line","2: Decimal_representation","2: Complete_space","2: Cauchy_sequence","2: Dedekind_cut","2: Natural_number","2: Infinite_set","2: Cardinality_of_the_continuum","2: ZermeloâFraenkel_set_theory","2: Negative_number","2: Supremum","2: Almost_all","2: Dimension","2: Vector_space","2: Indian_mathematics","2: Quadratic_equation","2: David_Hilbert","2: Calculus","2: Georg_Cantor","2: Uncountable","2: Cantor's_diagonal_argument","2: Dedekind_completion","2: Empty_set","2: Limit_of_a_sequence","2: Uniform_space","2: Complete_lattice","2: Surreal_number","2: Separable_space","2: Compact_space","2: ZermeloâFraenkel","1: Mathematics","1: Square_root_of_two","1: Pi","1: Number_line","1: Integers","1: Complex_plane","1: Archimedean_property","1: Up_to","1: Equivalence_class","1: Classical_mathematics","1: Uncountable_set","1: One-to-one_function","1: Cardinality","1: Aleph_number#Aleph-naught","1: Consistency","1: Positive_number","1: Continuous_function","1: Ellipsis#In_mathematical_notation","1: Least_upper_bound_axiom","1: Upper_and_lower_bounds","1: Classical_mechanics","1: Electromagnetism","1: Quantum_mechanics","1: General_relativity","1: Standard_model","1: Smooth_manifolds","1: Hilbert_spaces","1: Accuracy_and_precision","1: Holographic_principle","1: Bekenstein_bound","1: Scott_Aaronson","1: SIGACT","1: Floating-point_number","1: Arbitrary_precision_arithmetic","1: Computer_algebra_system","1: Constant_problem","1: Countably_infinite","1: Undecidable_problem","1: Definable_number","1: R","1: Blackboard_bold","1: Cartesian_product","1: Euclidean_geometry","1: Coordinate_system","1: Coordinates","1: History_of_Egypt","1: Vedic_civilization","1: Sulba_Sutras","1: Manava","1: Greek_mathematics","1: Pythagoras","1: Square_root_of_2","1: Middle_Ages","1: Zero","1: Chinese_mathematics","1: Mathematics_in_medieval_Islam","1: Algebra","1: Number","1: Egypt","1: AbÅ«_KÄmil_ShujÄ_ibn_Aslam","1: Coefficient","1: Equation","1: Cube_root","1: Nth_root","1: Simon_Stevin","1: Decimal","1: Descartes","1: Johann_Heinrich_Lambert","1: Adrien-Marie_Legendre","1: Paolo_Ruffini","1: Niels_Henrik_Abel","1: AbelâRuffini_theorem","1: Quintic_equation","1: Ãvariste_Galois","1: Galois_theory","1: Joseph_Liouville","1: Charles_Hermite","1: Ferdinand_von_Lindemann","1: Adolf_Hurwitz","1: Paul_Gordan","1: Countable","1: Cantor's_first_uncountability_proof","1: Axiomatic_system","1: Addition","1: Multiplication","1: Upper_bound","1: Tarski's_axiomatization_of_the_reals","1: Construction_of_the_real_numbers","1: Sequence","1: Distance","1: Augustin_Louis_Cauchy","1: Exponential_function","1: Ordered_group","1: Logical_independence","1: Axiomatic_set_theory","1: Absolute_value","1: Order_topology","1: Topology","1: Contractible","1: Connected_space","1: Simply_connected","1: Hausdorff_dimension","1: Local_compactness","1: Homeomorphic","1: Real_closed_field","1: Fundamental_theorem_of_algebra","1: Lebesgue_measure","1: Haar_measure","1: Topological_group","1: Unit_interval","1: Vitali_set","1: First-order_logic","1: LÃ¶wenheim&ndash;Skolem_theorem","1: Non-standard_model","1: Non-standard_analysis","1: Extension_field","1: Axiom_of_choice","1: Linear_combination","1: Well-ordering_theorem","1: Well-order","1: Subset","1: Least_element","1: Open_interval","1: Polynomial","1: Algebraically_closed_field","1: Affinely_extended_real_number_system","1: Real_projective_line","1: Infinitesimal","1: Non-Archimedean_ordered_field","1: Self-adjoint_operator","1: Hilbert_space","1: Eigenvector","1: Associative_algebra","1: Positive-definite","1: Normal_operator","1: Set_theory","1: Descriptive_set_theory","1: Reverse_mathematics","1: Abraham_Robinson","1: Nonstandard_real_number","1: Infinitesimal_calculus","1: Edward_Nelson","1: Internal_set_theory","1: Cardinal_number","1: Completeness#Mathematical_completeness","1: Continued_fraction","1: Real_analysis","1: Imaginary_number","1: Edmund_Landau","1: American_Mathematical_Society"]}
