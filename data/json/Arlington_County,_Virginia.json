The land that\nbecame Arlington was originally donated by Virginia to the United States\ngovernment to form part of the new federal capital district. On February 27,\n1801, the United States Congress organized the area as a subdivision of the\nDistrict of Columbia named Alexandria County. In 1846, Congress returned the\nland donated by Virginia due to issues involving Congressional representation\nand the abolition of slavery. The General Assembly of Virginia changed the\ncounty's name to Arlington in 1920 to avoid confusion with the adjacent City of\nAlexandria.\n\nThe county is situated in Northern Virginia on the south bank of the Potomac\nRiver directly across from Washington, D.C. Arlington is also bordered by\nFairfax County and the City of Falls Church to the southwest, and the City of\nAlexandria to the southeast. With a land area of , Arlington is the\ngeographically smallest self-governing county in the United States and has no\nother incorporated towns within its borders. Given these unique characteristics,\nfor statistical purposes the county is included as a municipality within the\nWashington Metropolitan Area by the United States Census Bureau. As of 2012,\nArlington County had a population of 220,565 residents. It would be the fourth-largest city in the state\nif it were incorporated as such.\n\nGiven the county's proximity to Washington, D.C., Arlington is headquarters to\nmany departments and agencies of the federal government of the United States,\nincluding the Pentagon, the Department of Defense, the United States Drug\nEnforcement Administration, the Defense Intelligence Agency and the Defense\nAdvanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). The many federal agencies, government\ncontractors, and service industries contribute to Arlington's stable economy,\nwhich has made it one of the highest-income counties in the United States.\nArlington is also the location of national memorials and museums, including\nArlington National Cemetery, the Pentagon Memorial, the Marine Corps War\nMemorial, and the United States Air Force Memorial.\n","linknr":1361,"url":"Arlington_County,_Virginia","recorded":1362665894,"links":117,"instances":["washington_metro","plantation","washington_metro","united_states","united_states","district_of_columbia","politician","virginia","washington_metro","united_states","united_states","united_states","company","software","producer","christian_organization","washington_metro","united_states","virginia"],"pdf":["http://www.abanet.org/poladv/letters/electionlaw/060914testimony_dcvoting.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20080725102618/http://www.abanet.org/poladv/letters/electionlaw/060914testimony_dcvoting.pdf","http://www.abanet.org/poladv/letters/electionlaw/060914testimony_dcvoting.pdf","http://www.dcvote.org/pdfs/mdrretro062004.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20090118053203/http://www.dcvote.org/pdfs/mdrretro062004.pdf","http://www.dcvote.org/pdfs/mdrretro062004.pdf","http://www.dcvote.org/pdfs/mdrretro062004.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20090118053203/http://www.dcvote.org/pdfs/mdrretro062004.pdf","http://www.dcvote.org/pdfs/mdrretro062004.pdf","http://www.arlingtonva.us/departments/CPHD/planning/powerpoint/rbpresentation/rbpresentation_060107.pdf","http://www.arlingtonva.us/departments/CPHD/planning/zoning/pdfs/Ordinance_Section31a.pdf","http://www.arlingtonva.us/departments/ManagementAndFinance/budget/fy09adopted/C.2_Budget%20REsolution.pdf","http://www.arlingtonva.us/departments/ManagementAndFinance/budget/fy09adopted/C.1_County%20Profile.pdf","http://www.arlingtonva.us/departments/ManagementAndFinance/budget/fy09adopted/C.1_County%20Profile.pdf","http://files.connectionnewspapers.com/PDF/current/Arlington.pdf","http://files.connectionnewspapers.com/PDF/current/Arlington.pdf","http://www.arlingtonva.us/departments/ManagementAndFinance/cafr/file84409.pdf","http://www.arlingtonva.us/departments/ManagementAndFinance/cafr/file84409.pdf","http://www.fcps.k12.va.us/mediapub/pressrel/tjhsstadmisstats2005-06.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20060822061827/http://www.fcps.k12.va.us/mediapub/pressrel/tjhsstadmisstats2005-06.pdf","http://www.fcps.k12.va.us/mediapub/pressrel/tjhsstadmisstats2005-06.pdf","http://soildatamart.nrcs.usda.gov/Manuscripts/VA013/0/Arlington.pdf"],"categories":["1801
