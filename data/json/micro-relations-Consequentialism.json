{"cursor":"35309","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Consequentialism' is the class of normative ethical theories holding that the\nof one's conduct are the ultimate basis for any judgment about the rightness of\nthat conduct. Thus, from a consequentialist standpoint, a morally right act (or\nomission) is one that will produce a good outcome, or consequence.\n\nConsequentialism is usually distinguished from deontological ethics (or\ndeontology), in that deontology derives the rightness or wrongness of one's\nconduct from the character of the behaviour itself rather than the outcomes of\nthe conduct. It is also distinguished from virtue ethics, which focuses on the\ncharacter of the agent rather than on the nature or consequences of the act (or\nomission) itself, and pragmatic ethics which treats morality like science:\nadvancing socially over the course of many lifetimes, such that any moral\ncriterion is subject to revision. Consequentialist theories differ in how they\ndefine moral goods.\n\nSome argue that consequentialist and deontological theories are not necessarily\nmutually exclusive. For example, T.M. Scanlon advances the idea that human\nrights, which are commonly considered a \"deontological\" concept, can only be\njustified with reference to the consequences of having those rights. Similarly, Robert Nozick argues for a theory that is mostly\nconsequentialist, but incorporates inviolable \"side-constraints\" which restrict\nthe sort of actions agents are permitted to do.\n","linknr":454,"url":"Consequentialism","recorded":1362670383,"links":32,"instances":["philosopher","virtue","virtue","ethics","political","bible"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Consequentialism|","Meta-ethics","Normative ethics","Utilitarianism","Ethical theories"],"headings":["Consequentialist philosophies","Issues in consequentialism","Etymology","Criticisms","Notable consequentialists","See also","Further reading","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/75/JohnStuartMill.jpg/220px-JohnStuartMill.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c8/Jeremy_Bentham_by_Henry_William_Pickersgill_detail.jpg/220px-Jeremy_Bentham_by_Henry_William_Pickersgill_detail.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/16/Max_Weber_1894.jpg/220px-Max_Weber_1894.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Wikiquote-logo-en.svg/40px-Wikiquote-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["altruism","ethics"],["temperance","virtue"],["justice","virtue"],["job","bible"],["freedom","political"],["francis_hutcheson","philosopher"]],"members":["francis_hutcheson","temperance","justice","altruism","freedom","job"],"related":["Normative_ethics","Deontological_ethics","Virtue_ethics","Pragmatic_ethics","Value_theory","T.M._Scanlon","Robert_Nozick","Mohist_consequentialism","Mozi","Maslow's_hierarchy_of_needs","Stanford_University","Sinologist","David_S._Nivison","Xunzi","Utilitarianism","Jeremy_Bentham","John_Stuart_Mill","Peter_Singer","Preference_utilitarianism","Ethical_egoism","Henry_Sidgwick","Altruism_(ethics)","Auguste_Comte","Deontology","Rule_utilitarianism","Rule_egoism","Robert_Nozick","Amartya_Sen","Brad_Hooker","Derek_Parfit","Brad_Hooker","R.M._Hare","Peter_Singer","Negative_utilitarianism","Deontological","Eudaemonist","Courage","Temperance_(virtue)","Justice_(virtue)","Wisdom","Faith_in_Christianity","Hope","Love","Hedonism","Thomas_Hobbes","Utilitarianism","Jeremy_Bentham","John_Stuart_Mill","Henry_Sidgwick","Evolutionary_ethics","Herbert_Spencer","Despotism","Niccolò_Machiavelli","Friedrich_Nietzsche","Pragmatism","Ralph_Barton_Perry","John_Dewey","Existentialism","Jean-Paul_Sartre","Eudaemonist","Job_(Bible)","Socrates","Jesus","G.E._Moore","Hastings_Rashdall","John_Stuart_Mill","Acts_and_Omissions_Doctrine","Voluntary_euthanasia","Normative_ethics","Moral_responsibility","Altruism","John_Rawls","Motivation","Peter_Railton","Jeremy_Bentham","Utilitarianism","Peter_Singer","Utilitarianism","Pleasure","Eudaimonia","Equality_of_outcome","Freedom_(political)","Arete","Virtue_ethics","Philippa_Foot","Max_Weber","G._E._M._Anscombe","Modern_Moral_Philosophy","John_Stuart_Mill","Henry_Sidgwick","G._E._M._Anscombe","Principle_of_double_effect","Bernard_Williams","Peter_Railton","Robert_Merrihew_Adams","Jonathan_Baron","Jeremy_Bentham","Richard_B._Brandt","Milton_Friedman","William_Godwin","R.M._Hare","John_Harsanyi","Brad_Hooker","Francis_Hutcheson_(philosopher)","Shelly_Kagan","Niccolò_Machiavelli","James_Mill","John_Stuart_Mill","G.E._Moore","Mozi","Philip_Pettit","Peter_Railton","Henry_Sidgwick","Peter_Singer","J._J._C._Smart","Rule_consequentialism","Doctrine_of_mental_reservation","Demandingness_objection","Dharmayuddha","Utilitarianism","Welfarism","Mohism","Cārvāka"]}
