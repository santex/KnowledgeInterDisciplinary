By convention, the\nacceptor is the member of this pair which did not contain the resulting anomeric\ncarbon of the new glycosidic bond. Since the nucleophilic atom of the acceptor\nis typically an oxygen atom, this can be remembered using the mnemonic of the\nacceptor is the alcohol. A glycosyl acceptor can be a mono- or oligosaccharide\nthat contains an available nucleophile, such as an unprotected hydroxyl.\n","linknr":89,"url":"Glycosyl_acceptor","recorded":1362672335,"links":14,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Carbohydrate chemistry","Organic reactions"],"headings":["Background","Examples","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/6c/Wiki_letter_w.svg/23px-Wiki_letter_w.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/6c/Wiki_letter_w.svg/23px-Wiki_letter_w.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Nucleophile","Glycosyl_donor","Glycosidic_bond","Anomer","Chemical_glycosylation","Glycosyl_halide","Armed_and_disarmed_saccharides","Carbohydrate_chemistry"]}
