{"cursor":"25715","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":":Not to be confused with [[Ferrimagnetism]]; for an overview see [[Magnetism]]\n\n, an iron alloy. Ferromagnetism is the physical theory which explains how\nmaterials become magnets.]] 'Ferromagnetism' is the basic mechanism by which\ncertain materials (such as iron) form permanent magnets, or are attracted to\nmagnets. In physics, several different types of magnetism are distinguished.\nFerromagnetism (including ferrimagnetism) is the strongest type; it\nis the only type that creates forces strong enough to be felt, and is\nresponsible for the common phenomena of magnetism encountered in everyday\nlife. Other substances respond weakly to magnetic fields with two other types\nof magnetism, paramagnetism and diamagnetism, but the forces are so weak that\nthey can only be detected by sensitive instruments in a laboratory. An\neveryday example of ferromagnetism is a refrigerator magnet used to hold notes\non a refrigerator door. The attraction between a magnet and ferromagnetic\nmaterial is \"the quality of magnetism first apparent to the ancient world, and\nto us today\". Richard M. Bozorth, Ferromagnetism, first\npublished 1951, reprinted 1993 by IEEE Press, New York as a \"Classic Reissue.\"\nISBN 0-7803-1032-2.\n\nPermanent magnets (materials that can be magnetized by an external magnetic\nfield and remain magnetized after the external field is removed) are either\nferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic, as are other materials that are noticeably\nattracted to them. Only a few substances are ferromagnetic. The common ones are\niron, nickel, cobalt and most of their alloys, some compounds of rare earth\nmetals, and a few naturally-occurring minerals such as lodestone.\n\nFerromagnetism is very important in industry and modern technology, and is the\nbasis for many electrical and electromechanical devices such as electromagnets,\nelectric motors, generators, transformers, and magnetic storage such as tape\nrecorders, and hard disks.\n","linknr":396,"url":"Ferromagnetism","recorded":1362555107,"links":58,"instances":["magnetic","physics","thermodynamics","crystal_lattice","atomic_structure","metallurgy","magnetism","unit","mechanics"],"pdf":["http://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/docs/00/21/88/17/PDF/ajp-jphyscol197940C421.pdf","http://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/docs/00/21/88/17/PDF/ajp-jphyscol197940C421.pdf"],"categories":["Quantum
