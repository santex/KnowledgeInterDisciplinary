      "text" : "'Secretases' are enzymes that \"snip\" pieces off a longer protein that is\nembedded in the cell membrane. Among other roles in the cell, secretases act on\nthe amyloid precursor protein (APP) to cleave the protein into three fragments.\nSequential cleavage by β-secretase (BACE) and γ-secretase produces the amyloid-β\npeptide fragment that aggregates into clumps called \"plaques\" in the brains of\nAlzheimer's disease patients. If α-secretase acts on APP first instead of BACE,\nno amyloid-β is formed because α-secretase recognizes a target protein sequence\ncloser to the cell surface than BACE. The non-pathogenic middle fragment formed\nby an α/γ cleavage sequence is called P3.\n",
