Although this image only shows the integers from\nâˆ’9 to 9, the line includes all real numbers, continuing forever in each\ndirection, and also numbers not marked that are between the integers. It is\noften used as an aid in teaching simple addition and subtraction, especially\ninvolving negative numbers.\n\n\n\nIt is divided into two symmetric halves by the origin, i.e. the number zero.\n\nIn advanced mathematics, the expressions 'real number line', or '[[real line]]'\nare typically used to indicate the above-mentioned concept that every point on a\nstraight line corresponds to a single real number, and .\n","linknr":154,"url":"Number_line","recorded":1362374597,"links":46,"instances":["disambiguation","mathematics","mathematics","geometry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Elementary mathematics","Mathematical manipulatives"],"headings":["Drawing the number line","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/93/Number-line.svg/750px-Number-line.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/1/3/4/134676911181af05d24d406f16edf587.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/Numbers.svg/32px-Numbers.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["origin","mathematics"],["0","number"],["whole_number","disambiguation"],["imaginary_line","mathematics"],["line","geometry"]],"members":["whole_number","imaginary_line","origin","line"],"related":["Real_number","Integer","Real_number","Addition","Subtraction","Negative_number","Origin_(mathematics)","0_(number)","Horizontal_plane","Positive_number","Negative_number","Real_number","Irrational_number","Rational_numbers","Integer","Whole_number_(disambiguation)","Natural_number","Imaginary_number","Imaginary_line_(mathematics)","Complex_plane","Complex_number","Coordinate_system","Complex_plane","Extended_real_number_line","Number_form","Line_(geometry)","Real_number","Chronology"]}
