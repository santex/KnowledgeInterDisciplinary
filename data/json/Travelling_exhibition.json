{"cursor":"3854","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'travelling exhibition', also referred to as a \"'travelling exhibit'\" or a\n\"'touring exhibition'\", is a type of exhibition that is available for\ncirculation to one or more venues in addition to the premises of the organiser.\n\nTemporary exhibitions can bring together objects that might be dispersed amongst\nseveral collections, to reconstruct an original context such as an artistâs\ncareer or a patron's collection, or to propose connections - perhaps the result\nof recent research - which give new insights or a different way of understanding\nitems in museum collections. The whole exhibition, usually with associated\nservices - insurance, shipping, storage, conservation, mounting, set up, etc. -\ncan then be loaned to one or more venues, to lengthen the life of the exhibition\nand to allow the widest possible audiences - regionally, nationally or\ninternationally - to experience these objects and the stories they contain. Such\ncollaborations can add interest to museums where displays of permanent\ncollections might change only slowly, helping to provide fresh interpretations\nor more complete stories and attract new audiences. They also provide fresh\nideas and breathing space for organisations which have exhibition spaces but\nlack permanent collections.\n\nTo have more than one location for the same exhibition can benefit the organiser\nbecause it can then share a part of the production costs amongst the venues, so\nmuseums and galleries frequently use touring as a cost-efficient way of\npromoting access to their collections. For organisers and their venues, touring\nexhibitions are important for sharing 'ideas' (for example, promoting techniques\nfor providing for visitors with visual impairments or producing displays which\nexamine current or topical issues) and 'materials' (especially objects that\nmight not be seen in public frequently or even shown together), as well as\n'resources' (human as well as financial). Touring is a way of sharing with like-\nminded institutions and of achieving economies of scale which allow more\nambitious projects to happen.\n\nTravelling exhibitions are usually supported by governmental organizations for\nthe diffusion of knowledge and local cultures. As the acknowledgement of the\nimportance of travelling exhibitions, the International Council of Museums\n(ICOM) established the International Committee for Exhibition Exchange (ICEE) in\n1983, as a forum for many different aspects of exhibitions development,\ncirculation and exchange.\n","linknr":97,"url":"Travelling_exhibition","recorded":1374548798,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Travelling_exhibition&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Travelling_exhibition&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Art_exhibition","/wiki/Art_exhibition","/wiki/Museums","/wiki/Art_gallery","/wiki/International_Council_of_Museums","/wiki/International_Committee_for_Exhibition_Exchange","/w/index.php?title=Travelling_exhibition&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Art_exhibition","/wiki/Body_Worlds","/wiki/National_Touring_Exhibitions","/wiki/Museums_Association","/wiki/Touring_Exhibitions_Group","/wiki/Walking_with_Dinosaurs","/wiki/International_Arts_%26_Artists","/w/index.php?title=Travelling_exhibition&action=edit&section=2","http://www.ballodora.de/icee/","http://www.pch.gc.ca/progs/pei-trx/index_e.cfm","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0931201853","/wiki/Special:BookSources/1853322210","/wiki/Special:BookSources/075062518X","http://www.teg.org.uk","http://www.exposare.com","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Travelling_exhibition&oldid=559367702","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Museum_events","/wiki/Category:Traveling_exhibits","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Travelling+exhibition&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Travelling+exhibition","/wiki/Travelling_exhibition","/wiki/Talk:Travelling_exhibition","#","/wiki/Travelling_exhibition","/w/index.php?title=Travelling_exhibition&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Travelling_exhibition&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Travelling_exhibition","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Travelling_exhibition","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Travelling_exhibition&oldid=559367702","/w/index.php?title=Travelling_exhibition&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q936821","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Travelling_exhibition&id=559367702","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Travelling+exhibition","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Travelling+exhibition&oldid=559367702&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Travelling_exhibition&printable=yes","//de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wanderausstellung","//eo.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ekspozicio_migra","//it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mostra_itinerante","//hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/V%C3%A1ndorki%C3%A1ll%C3%ADt%C3%A1s","//pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exposi%C3%A7%C3%A3o_em_tour","//sr.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9F%D1%83%D1%82%D1%83%D1%98%D1%83%D1%9B%D0%B0_%D0%B8%D0%B7%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%B6%D0%B1%D0%B0","//sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vandringsutst%C3%A4llning","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q936821#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_exhibition","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Museum
