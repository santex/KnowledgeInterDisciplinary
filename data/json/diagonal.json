AC' (shown in blue) is a space diagonal with length\n <math>\\sqrt 3</math>, while AC (shown in red) is a face diagonal and has\n length <math>\\sqrt 2</math>.]] A 'diagonal' is a line joining two\n nonconsecutive vertices of a polygon or polyhedron. Informally, any sloping\n line is called diagonal. The word \"diagonal\" derives from the ancient Greek\n διαγώνιος diagonios,<ref>[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=diagona-\n l&searchmode=none Online Etymology Dictionary]</ref> \"from angle to angle\"\n (from διά- dia-, \"through\", \"across\" and γωνία gonia, \"angle\", related to\n gony \"knee\"); it was used by both Strabo<ref>Strabo, Geography\n 2.1.36–37</ref> and Euclid<ref>Euclid, Elements book 11, proposition 28</ref>\n to refer to a line connecting two vertices of a rhombus or\n cuboid,<ref>Euclid, Elements book 11, proposition 38</ref> and later adopted\n into Latin as diagonus (\"slanting line\").\n\nIn mathematics, in addition to its geometric meaning, a diagonal is also used in\nmatrices to refer to a set of entries along a diagonal line.\n",
