Incorporated in 1905, Audubon is one of the oldest of\nsuch organizations in the world and uses science, education and grassroots\nadvocacy to advance its conservation mission. It is named in honor of John James\nAudubon, a Franco-American ornithologist and naturalist who painted, cataloged,\nand described the birds of North America in his famous book [[Birds of America\n(book)|Birds of America]] published in sections between 1827 and 1838.\n\nThe society has nearly 500 local chapters, each of which is an independent\n501(c)(3) non-profit organization voluntarily affiliated with the National\nAudubon Society, which often organize birdwatching field trips and conservation-\nrelated activities. It also coordinates the Christmas Bird Count held each\nDecember in the U.S., a model of citizen science, in partnership with Cornell\nLab of Ornithology, the Great Backyard Bird Count each February. Together with\nCornell, Audubon created eBird, an online database for bird observation. The\nNational Audubon Society also has many global partners to help birds that\nmigrate beyond our borders, including BirdLife International based in England,\nBird Studies Canada, and many partners in Latin America and the Caribbean.\nAudubon's International Alliances Program (IAP) brings together people\nthroughout the Western Hemisphere to work together to implement conservation\nsolutions at Important Birds Areas (IBA's).\n\nThe society's main offices are in New York City and Washington, D.C., and it has\nstate offices in about 24 states. It also owns and operates a number of nature\ncenters open to the public, located in urban settings, including New York City,\nJoplin, Phoenix, Dallas and Los Angeles, as well as at bird refuges and other\nnatural areas. Audubon Centers help to forge lifelong connections between people\nand nature, developing stewards for conservation among young and diverse\ncommunities.\n","linknr":294,"url":"National_Audubon_Society","recorded":1362374740,"links":26,"instances":["ornithologist","united_states"],"pdf":[],"categories":["1905 establishments in the United States","Audubon movement","Ornithological organizations","Birdlife International national partners","Nature centers","National Audubon Society|"],"headings":["History","Current activities","Leadership","''Audubon'' magazine {{anchor|Audubon Magazine}}","Notes","Bibliography","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f8/National_Audubon_Society_logo.png/200px-National_Audubon_Society_logo.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2e/700_Broadway.jpg/237px-700_Broadway.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e1/Entry_logo.jpg/220px-Entry_logo.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c7/AudubonMag_jul-aug2012_cover.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/87/Bird-Lore_cover_1899.png/220px-Bird-Lore_cover_1899.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f0/Bird_lore_cover_1899.png/220px-Bird_lore_cover_1899.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/12px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["clean_air_act","united_states"],["hog_island","lincoln_county,_maine#hog_island_audubon_camp"],["frank_chapman","ornithologist"],["frank_chapman","ornithologist"]],"members":["frank_chapman","hog_island","clean_air_act"],"related":["Non-profit_organization","United_States","Environmental_organization","John_James_Audubon","Franco-American","Ornithologist","Birds_of_North_America","Birdwatching","Christmas_Bird_Count","Citizen_science","Cornell_Lab_of_Ornithology","Cornell","EBird","New_York_City","Washington,_D.C.","Manhattan","New_York_City","George_Bird_Grinnell","Oliver_Wendell_Holmes,_Jr.","Henry_Ward_Beecher","John_Greenleaf_Whittier","American_Ornithologists'_Union","Massachusetts_Audubon_Society","Florence_Augusta_Merriam_Bailey","Harriet_Hemenway","Theodore_Roosevelt","Migratory_Bird_Treaty_Act_of_1918","National_Wildlife_Refuge","Greenwich,_Connecticut","Paul_J._Rainey_Wildlife_Sanctuary","Brooklyn,_New_York","East_Los_Angeles,_California","California","Phoenix,_Arizona","Seattle,_Washington","Great_Depression","Field_guide","DDT","Silent_Spring","Rachel_Carson","Clean_Air_Act_(United_States)","Clean_Water_Act","National_Wild_and_Scenic_River","Endangered_Species_Act","International_Whaling_Commission","Louis_Bacon","Richard_Louv","Bullitt_Foundation","Edward_H._Harte","Michael_P._Dombeck","Chandler_Robbins","William_G._Conway","Hazel_Wolf","James_Parks_Morton","E._O._Wilson","Jimmy_Carter","Oren_Lyons","Anita_Roddick","John_H._Chafee","Ted_Turner","Robert_Redford","Ã“scar_Arias","Cecil_D._Andrus","Richard_Pough","Margaret_Murie","Russell_W._Peterson","John_Bertram_Oakes","Maurice_Strong","Tom_McCall","Rachel_Carson","Walt_Disney","Transmission_lines","Habitat","David_Yarnold","Renewable_energy","BP_oil_spill","Gulf_of_Mexico","Oil_spill","Petroleum_industry","Brown_Pelicans","Deepwater_Horizon_litigation","Manhattan","Important_Bird_Area","BirdLife_International","Title_16_of_the_United_States_Code","Greater_Sage_Grouse","Tejon_Ranch","Nature_centers","Wildlife_sanctuaries","Paul_J._Rainey_Wildlife_Sanctuary","Property_and_Environment_Research_Center","Elisha_Mitchell","Huachuca","Kalmiopsis","Ornithology","Wildlife_conservation","Frank_Chapman_(ornithologist)","Magazine","Utne_Reader","Frank_Chapman_(ornithologist)"]}
