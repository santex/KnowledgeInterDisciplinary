{"cursor":"110173","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n brain]]\n\nThe 'brain' is the center of the nervous system in all vertebrate and most\ninvertebrate animalsâonly a few invertebrates such as sponges, jellyfish, adult\nsea squirts and starfish do not have one, even if diffuse neural tissue is\npresent. It is located in the head, usually close to the primary sensory organs\nfor such senses as vision, hearing, balance, taste, and smell. The brain of a\nvertebrate is the most complex organ of its body. In a typical human the\ncerebral cortex (the largest part) is estimated to contain 15â33 billion\nneurons, each connected by synapses to several thousand other\nneurons. These neurons communicate with one another by means of long\nprotoplasmic fibers called axons, which carry trains of signal pulses called\naction potentials to distant parts of the brain or body targeting specific\nrecipient cells.\n\nPhysiologically, the function of the brain is to exert centralized control over\nthe other organs of the body. The brain acts on the rest of the body both by\ngenerating patterns of muscle activity and by driving secretion of chemicals\ncalled hormones. This centralized control allows rapid and coordinated responses\nto changes in the environment. Some basic types of responsiveness such as\nreflexes can be mediated by the spinal cord or peripheral ganglia, but\nsophisticated purposeful control of behavior based on complex sensory input\nrequires the information-integrating capabilities of a centralized brain.\n\nFrom a philosophical point of view, what makes the brain special in comparison\nto other organs is that it forms the physical structure that generates the mind.\nAs Hippocrates put it: \"Men ought to know that from nothing else but the brain\ncome joys, delights, laughter and sports, and sorrows, griefs, despondency, and\nlamentations.\" Through much of history, the mind was\nthought to be separate from the brain. Even for present-day neuroscience, the\nmechanisms by which brain activity gives rise to consciousness and thought\nremain very challenging to understand: despite rapid scientific progress, much\nabout how the brain works remains a mystery. The operations of individual brain\ncells are now understood in considerable detail, but the way they cooperate in\nensembles of millions has been very difficult to decipher. The most promising\napproaches treat the brain as a biological computer, very different in mechanism\nfrom electronic computers, but similar in the sense that it acquires information\nfrom the surrounding world, stores it, and processes it in a variety of ways.\n\nThis article compares the properties of brains across the entire range of animal\nspecies, with the greatest attention to vertebrates. It deals with the human\nbrain insofar as it shares the properties of other brains. The ways in which the\nhuman brain differs from other brains are covered in the human brain article.\nSeveral topics that might be covered here are instead covered there because much\nmore can be said about them in a human context. The most important is brain\ndisease and the effects of brain damage, covered in the human brain article\nbecause the most common diseases of the human brain either do not show up in\nother species, or else manifest themselves in different ways.\n","linknr":1541,"url":"Brain","recorded":1362554744,"links":167,"instances":["drug","philosophy_of_mind","neural","psychology","histology","food","biochemistry","neuroanatomy","unit"],"pdf":["http://www.cogs.indiana.edu/spackled/2005readings/CetaceanBrainEvolution.pdf","http://www.cogs.indiana.edu/spackled/2005readings/CetaceanBrainEvolution.pdf","http://www.cogsci.ucsd.edu/~sereno/papers/HumanRetin95.pdf","http://www.cogsci.ucsd.edu/~sereno/papers/HumanRetin95.pdf","http://jerome.lettvin.info/lettvin/Jerome/WhatTheFrogsEyeTellsTheFrogsBrain.pdf","http://jerome.lettvin.info/lettvin/Jerome/WhatTheFrogsEyeTellsTheFrogsBrain.pdf","http://www.columbia.edu/cu/psychology/silver/publications2/149%20antle%20et%20al.pdf","http://www.columbia.edu/cu/psychology/silver/publications2/149%20antle%20et%20al.pdf","http://www.princeton.edu/~cggross/Neuroscientist_98_Bernard.pdf","http://www.princeton.edu/~cggross/Neuroscientist_98_Bernard.pdf","http://www.nobel.se/medicine/laureates/1981/wiesel-lecture.pdf","http://www.nobel.se/medicine/laureates/1981/wiesel-lecture.pdf","http://osiris.rutgers.edu/BuzsakiHP/Publications/PDFs/Buzsaki2004NatNeurosci.pdf","http://osiris.rutgers.edu/BuzsakiHP/Publications/PDFs/Buzsaki2004NatNeurosci.pdf"],"categories":["Brain|","Organs"],"headings":["Anatomy","Physiology","Functions","Development","Research","History","See
