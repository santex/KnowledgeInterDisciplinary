Dictated by specific hydrogen bonding\npatterns, Watson-Crick base pairs (guanine-cytosine and adenine-thymine) allow\nthe DNA helix to maintain a regular helical structure that is independent of its\nnucleotide sequence. The complementary nature of this based-paired structure\nprovides a backup copy of all genetic information encoded within double-stranded\nDNA. The regular structure and data redundancy provided by the DNA helix make\nDNA an optimal molecule for the storage of genetic information, while base-\npairing between DNA and incoming nucleotides provide the mechanism through which\nDNA polymerase replicates DNA, and RNA polymerase transcribes DNA into RNA. Many\nDNA-binding proteins can recognize specific base pairing patterns that identify\nparticular regulatory regions of genes.\n\nIntramolecular base pairs can occur within single-stranded nucleic acids. This\nis particularly important in RNA molecules (e.g. transfer RNA), where Watson-\nCrick base pairs (G-C and A-U) permit the formation of short double-stranded\nhelices, and a wide variety of non-Watson-Crick interactions (e.g. G-U or A-A)\nallow RNAs to fold into a vast range of specific three-dimensional structures.\nIn addition, base-paring between transfer RNA (tRNA) and messenger RNA (mRNA)\nforms the basis for the molecular recognition events that result in the\nnucleotide sequence of mRNA becoming translated into the amino acid sequence\nof proteins.\n\nThe size of an individual gene or an organism's entire genome is often measured\nin base pairs because DNA is usually double-stranded. Hence, the number of total\nbase pairs is equal to the number of nucleotides in one of the strands (with the\nexception of non-coding single-stranded regions of telomeres). The haploid human\ngenome (23 chromosomes) is estimated to be about 3.2 billion base pairs long and\nto contain 20,000â25,000 distinct genes. A kilobase (kb) is a unit of measurement in molecular\nbiology equal to 1000 base pairs of DNA or RNA.
