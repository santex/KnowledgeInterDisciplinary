Zero itself is signless, although\nin some contexts it makes sense to consider a signed zero. Along its application\nto real numbers, \"change of sign\" is used throughout mathematics and physics to\ndenote the additive inverse (multiplication to −1), even for quantities which\nare not real numbers (so, which are not prescribed to be either positive,\nnegative, or zero). Also, the word \"sign\" can indicate aspects of mathematical\nobjects that resemble positivity and negativity, such as the sign of a\npermutation (see below).\n","title":"Sign%20%28mathematics%29","headings":["Sign of a number","Sign function","Meanings of sign","See also"]},"micro-relation":["4: Absolute_value","3: Physics","2: Mathematics","2: Real_number","2: Negative_number","2: Signed_zero","2: Additive_inverse","2: Parity_of_a_permutation","2: Complex_numbers","2: Computing","2: Calculus","2: Mathematical_analysis","2: Clockwise","1: â1","1: Numeral_system","1: Arithmetic","1: Plus_and_minus_signs","1: Subtraction","1: Minus_sign","1: Algebra","1: Signed_number_representations","1: One-sided_limit","1: Unit_circle","1: Counterclockwise","1: Angle","1: Rotation","1: Axis_of_rotation","1: Right-hand_rule","1: Finite_difference","1: Derivative","1: Monotonic_function","1: Analytic_geometry","1: Number_line","1: Linear_motion","1: Velocity","1: Cartesian_plane","1: Euclidean_vector","1: Vector_component","1: Most_significant_bit","1: Bit","1: Two's_complement","1: Signed_number_representation","1: Vector_space","1: Graph_theory","1: Signed_graph","1: Signed_measure","1: Signed-digit_representation","1: Signed_area","1: Signed_volume","1: Determinant","1: Electric_charge","1: Proton","1: Electron","1: Positive_element","1: Symmetry_in_mathematics"]}
