{"cursor":"10857","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The 'Federal Acquisition Regulation' (FAR) is the principal set of rules in the\nFederal Acquisition Regulation System. This system consists of sets of\nregulations issued by agencies of the federal government of the United States to\ngovern what is called the \"acquisition process\"; this is the process through\nwhich the government purchases (\"acquires\") goods and services. That process\nconsists of three phases: (1) need recognition and acquisition planning, (2)\ncontract formation, and (3) contract administration. The FAR System regulates\nthe activities of government personnel in carrying out that process. It does not\nregulate the purchasing activities of private sector firms, except to the extent\nthat parts of it are incorporated into government solicitations and contracts by\nreference.\n\nThe FAR is codified in Title 48 of the United States Code of Federal\nRegulations. It is issued pursuant to the Office of Federal Procurement Policy\nAct of 1974 (Pub. L. 93-400 and Title 41 of the United States Code), Chapter 7.\nStatutory authority to issue and maintain the FAR resides with the Secretary of\nDefense, the Administrator of General Services, and the Administrator, National\nAeronautics and Space Administration, 41 U.S.C. Â§ 421(c)(1), subject to the\napproval of the Administrator of Federal Procurement Policy, 41 U.S.C. Â§ 405.\n\nThe largest single part of the FAR is Part 52, which contains standard contract\nclauses and \"solicitation provisions.\" Solicitation provisions are\ncertifications, notices, and instructions for firms that plan to compete for a\nspecific contract. Many contract clauses incorporate parts of the FAR into\ngovernment contracts by reference, by which means they impose FAR rules on\ncontractors. If the FAR requires that a clause which addresses an important\ntopic be included in a government contract, and if the government's acquisition\npersonnel omit the clause without authorization, the agency boards of contract\nappeals and the Federal courts may interpret the contract as though the clause\nwere, in fact, included. This is done pursuant to a legal doctrine known as the\nChristian Doctrine, which is based on the underlying principle that government\nregulations have the force and effect of law, and government personnel may not\ndeviate from the law without proper authorization. The boards and courts charge\nprospective contractors with knowing what the law requires and knowing the\nlimitations of the authority of government acquisition personnel.\n\nThe single most heavily regulated aspect of acquisition is contract pricing,\nwhich is addressed throughout the FAR, but especially in Subpart 15.4, Parts 30\nand 31, and Subparts 42.7, 42.8, and 42.17. A large part of the FAR, Subchapter\nD, describes various socio-economic programs, such as the various small business\nprograms, purchases from foreign sources, and laws written to protect laborers\nand professionals working under government contracts.\n\nThe FAR and its agency supplements are said by the federal courts to have \"the\nforce and effect of law,\" see Davies Precision Machining, Inc. v. U.S., 35 Fed.\nCl. 651 (1995). Nearly all government agencies are required to comply with the\nFAR. However, some agencies are exempt (e.g., the Federal Aviation\nAdministration, and the U.S. Mint); in those cases, the agency promulgates its\nown specific procurement rules.\n","linknr":115,"url":"Federal_Acquisition_Regulation","recorded":1375090191,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Federal_Acquisition_Regulation&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Federal_Acquisition_Regulation&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Regulation","/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States","/wiki/Private_sector","/wiki/Code_of_Federal_Regulations","/wiki/Title_41_of_the_United_States_Code","/wiki/G.L._Christian_and_associates_v._US","/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration","/wiki/U.S._Mint","#Purpose","#Structure","#Supplements","#Criticisms","#See_also","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Federal_Acquisition_Regulation&action=edit&section=1","#cite_note-1","#cite_note-2","/w/index.php?title=Federal_Acquisition_Regulation&action=edit&section=2","#cite_note-48_CFR_TOC-3","#cite_note-48_CFR_1_TOC_VOL1-4","#cite_note-48_CFR_1_TOC_VOL2-5","#cite_note-48_CFR_1_TOC_VOL1-4","#cite_note-48_CFR_1_TOC_VOL2-5","/w/index.php?title=Federal_Acquisition_Regulation&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Defense","/w/index.php?title=Federal_Acquisition_Regulation&action=edit&section=4","http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d06533sp.pdf","/w/index.php?title=Federal_Acquisition_Regulation&action=edit&section=5","/wiki/Government_contracts","/w/index.php?title=Federal_Acquisition_Regulation&action=edit&section=6","#cite_ref-1","#cite_ref-2","#cite_ref-48_CFR_TOC_3-0","http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2010-title48-vol1/pdf/CFR-2010-title48-vol1.pdf","#cite_ref-48_CFR_1_TOC_VOL1_4-0","#cite_ref-48_CFR_1_TOC_VOL1_4-1","http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2010-title48-vol1/pdf/CFR-2010-title48-vol1.pdf","#cite_ref-48_CFR_1_TOC_VOL2_5-0","#cite_ref-48_CFR_1_TOC_VOL2_5-1","http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2010-title48-vol2/pdf/CFR-2010-title48-vol2.pdf","/w/index.php?title=Federal_Acquisition_Regulation&action=edit&section=7","http://acquisition.gov/far/index.html","http://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/dars/dfars/index.htm","http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/procurement/regs/nfstoc.htm","http://farsite.hill.af.mil/farsite.html","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Federal_Acquisition_Regulation&oldid=560822463","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Code_of_Federal_Regulations","/wiki/Category:Government_procurement_in_the_United_States","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Federal+Acquisition+Regulation&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Federal+Acquisition+Regulation","/wiki/Federal_Acquisition_Regulation","/wiki/Talk:Federal_Acquisition_Regulation","#","/wiki/Federal_Acquisition_Regulation","/w/index.php?title=Federal_Acquisition_Regulation&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Federal_Acquisition_Regulation&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Federal_Acquisition_Regulation","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Federal_Acquisition_Regulation","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Federal_Acquisition_Regulation&oldid=560822463","/w/index.php?title=Federal_Acquisition_Regulation&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5439994","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Federal_Acquisition_Regulation&id=560822463","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Federal+Acquisition+Regulation","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Federal+Acquisition+Regulation&oldid=560822463&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Federal_Acquisition_Regulation&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5439994#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAli
