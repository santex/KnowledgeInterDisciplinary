Some scientists hypothesize that nanobes are the smallest form of\nlife, 1/10 the size of the smallest known bacteria. No conclusive evidence\nexists for whether these structures are, or are not, living organisms, and their\nclassification is controversial.\n\nNanobes were discovered in 1996 (published in [[American Mineralogist]], vol\n83., 1998) by Philippa Uwins, [http://www.microscopy-\nuk.org.uk/nanobes/nanophil.html Nanobes] University of Queensland,\nAustralia. . They were found growing from rock samples (both full-\ndiameter and sidewall cores) of Jurassic and Triassic sandstones, originally\nretrieved from an unspecified number of oil exploration wells off Australia's\nwest coast. Depths of retrieval were between and below the sea bed. While Uwins\net al. present assertions against it, they do not exclude the possibility that\nthe nanobes are from a surface contaminant, not from the rock units cited.\n\nThe smallest are just 20 nanometers in diameter. Some researchers believe that\nthese structures are crystal growths, but the staining of these structures with\ndyes that bind to DNA might indicate that they are living\norganisms. [http://serc.carleton.edu/microbelife/topics/nanobes/index.html\nNanobacteria and Nanobes- Are They Alive?] They are similar to the\nstructures found in ALH84001, a Mars meteorite found in the Antarctic. Nanobes\nare similar in size to nanobacteria, which are also structures that have been\nproposed to be extremely small living organisms. However, these two should not\nbe confused. Nanobacteria are supposed to be cellular organisms, while nanobes\nare hypothesized to be a previously unknown form of life or protobionts.\n","linknr":179,"url":"Nanobe","recorded":1362483885,"links":27,"instances":["geology"],"pdf":["http://eprints.iisc.ernet.in/archive/00001799/01/25smallest25(1)-9to10mar2000.pdf","http://eprints.iisc.ernet.in/archive/00001799/01/25smallest25(1)-9to10mar2000.pdf","https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jsme2/16/2/16_2_67/_pdf","https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jsme2/16/2/16_2_67/_pdf"],"categories":["Microbiology"],"headings":["Claims","Responses","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8d/Nanobe.gif/300px-Nanobe.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/23/Nanobe2.gif/300px-Nanobe2.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["rock","geology"]],"members":["rock"],"related":["Structure","Rock_(geology)","Sediment","Hypothesis","Life","Bacterium","University_of_Queensland","Australia","Jurassic","Triassic","Oil_exploration","Nanometre","Crystal","DNA","ALH84001","Mars_meteorite","Antarctica","Nanobacteria","Protobiont","DNA","Actinomycetes","Fungi","Nanometre","Martian_meteorite","ALH84001","Antarctic","Astrobiology","Mars","Bacterium","Mimivirus","Virus","Archaeum","Nanobacterium","Parvovirus","Ultramicrobacteria","National_Academies_of_Sciences"]}
