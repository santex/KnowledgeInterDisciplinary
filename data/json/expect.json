Expect is available for Unix, Microsoft Windows, and other systems.\nIt is used to automate control of interactive applications such as telnet, ftp,\npasswd, fsck, rlogin, tip, ssh, and others. Expect uses pseudo terminals (Unix)\nor emulates a console (Windows), starts the target program, and then\ncommunicates with it, just as a human would, via the terminal or console\ninterface. Tk, another Tcl extension, can be used to provide a GUI.\n","title":"expect","headings":["Basics","Usage","Examples","\"\" || $passw","\"\" || $location","\"\" || $file2","Opinion","Alternatives","References","Further reading","External links"]},"micro-relation":["3: Tcl","3: GUI","3: Perl","2: Don_Libes","2: Microsoft_Windows","1: POSIX","1: Public_domain","1: Text_terminal","1: Unix","1: Application_software","1: Telnet","1: Ftp","1: Fsck","1: Rlogin","1: Secure_Shell","1: Pseudo_terminal","1: Regular_expression","1: Scripting_programming_language","1: DejaGnu","1: GNU_Compiler_Collection","1: Cron","1: C_shell","1: AutoHotkey","1: AutoIt","1: Winbatch"]}
