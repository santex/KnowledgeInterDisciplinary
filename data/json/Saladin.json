A Muslim of\nKurdish origins, A number of contemporary sources make note\nof this. The biographer Ibn Khallikan writes, \"Historians agree in stating that\n[Saladin's] father and family belonged to Duwin\n[ Dvin ]....They were Kurds and belonged to the\nRawÄdiya (sic), which is a branch of the great tribe al-HadÄniya\": Minorsky\n(1953), p. 124. The medieval historian Ibn Athir relates a passage from another\ncommander: \"â¦both you and Saladin are Kurds and you will not let power pass into\nthe hands of the Turks\": Minorsky (1953), p. 138. Steed, Brian L.,\nPiercing the Fog of War: Recognizing Change on the Battlefield, (Zenith Press,\n2009), 176;\"Saladin was a Kurd from Tikrit.\". Saladin led Islamic opposition against the\nEuropean Crusaders in the Levant. At the height of his power, his sultanate\nincluded Egypt, Syria, Mesopotamia, Hejaz, Yemen, and parts of North Africa.\n\nOriginally sent to Fatimid Egypt in 1163 with his uncle Shirkuh by their Zengid\nlord Nur ad-Din, Saladin climbed the ranks of the Fatimid government as a result\nof his military successes against Crusader assaults on its territory and his\npersonal closeness to the caliph al-Adid. When Shirkuh died in 1169, al-Adid\nappointed Saladin vizier, a rare nomination of a Sunni Muslim to such an\nimportant position in the Shia Muslim-controlled caliphate. During his term as\nvizier, Saladin began to undermine the Fatimid establishment and following al-\nAdid's death in 1171, he took over government and realigned the country's\nallegiance with the Sunni Baghdad-based Abbasid Caliphate. In the following\nyears, he led forays against the Crusaders in Palestine, ordered the successful\nconquest of Yemen and staved off pro-Fatimid rebellions in Upper Egypt.\n\nNot long after the death of Nur ad-Din in 1174, Saladin personally led the\nconquest of Syria, peacefully entering Damascus at the request of its leader. By\nmid-1175 he had conquered Hama and Homs, inviting the animosity of his former\nZengid lords, now based at Aleppo and Mosul, who had been official rulers of\nSyria. Soon after, he defeated the Zengid army in battle and was thereafter\nproclaimed the \"Sultan of Egypt and Syria\" by the Abbasid caliph al-Mustadi. He\nmade further conquests in northern Syria and Jazira and escaped two\nassassination attempts by the Hashashin before returning to Egypt in 1177 to\nhandle domestic issues. By 1182 Saladin completed the conquest of Syria after\ncapturing Aleppo, but ultimately failed in taking over the Zengid stronghold of\nMosul. He subsequently entered into an alliance with the Zengids and the\nArtuqids of Anatolia.\n\nUnder Saladin's personal leadership, the Ayyubid army defeated the Crusaders at\nthe decisive Battle of Hattin in 1187, leading the way to the Muslims' re-\ncapture of Palestine from the Crusaders who had conquered it 88 years earlier.\nThough the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem would continue to exist for a period,\nits defeat at Hattin marked a turning point in its conflict with the Muslim\npowers of the region. As a result of his achievements, Saladin has become a\nprominent figure in Muslim, Arab, Kurdish culture. Moors' Islamic Cultural\nHome souvenir III, 1970â1976 Islamic Cultural Home, 1978, p. 7. His\nreportedly noble and chivalrous behavior was noted by Christian chroniclers, and\ndespite being the nemesis of the Crusaders, he won the respect of many of them,\nincluding Richard the Lionheart who led the Third Crusade; rather than becoming\na hated figure in Europe, Saladin became a celebrated example of the principles\nof chivalry. In 1192 he died in Damascus a relatively poor man,\nhaving given much of his wealth to his subjects. Saladin is buried in a\nmausoleum adjacent to the Umayyad Mosque.\n","linknr":1432,"url":"Saladin","recorded":1362539439,"links":145,"instances":["1923_film","metal_gear","lebanon","1187","video_game","travellers","film","country","doctor_who","radio_plays","video_game","hume","ship","bbc_tv_series","crusader_castle","scott_novel","1183","heraldry","dante","film","laird_novel"],"pdf":[],"categories":["1130s
