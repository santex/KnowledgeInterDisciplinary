This topology differs from another, perhaps more\nobvious, topology called the box topology, which can also be given to a product\nspace and which agrees with the product topology when the product is over only\nfinitely many spaces. However, the product topology is \"correct\" in that it\nmakes the product space a categorical product of its factors, whereas the box\ntopology is too fine; this is the sense in which the product topology is\n\"natural\".\n","linknr":180,"url":"Product_space","recorded":1362372631,"links":25,"instances":["topology","topology","mathematics","set_theory","topology","set_theory","category_theory","mathematics","set_theory"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Topology","General topology","Binary operations"],"headings":["Definition","Examples","Properties","Relation to other topological notions","Axiom of choice","See also","Notes","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/math/b/6/3/b63969be196e88445941fc7a0867df7e.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/3/0/430e7de2484db3b5a632379437c6cef7.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/2/d/f2db9026a2a2cd9ad2333582173d547f.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/1/2/f/12f4f462f4dd14d4e0842b0b989ce399.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4f/CategoricalProduct-02.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/5/1/8512c39b192d00b612c68d9eb0c99408.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["product","category_theory"],["projection","set_theory"],["continuous","topology"],["union","set_theory"],["intersection","set_theory"],["product","category_theory"],["subspace","topology"],["net","mathematics"],["function","mathematics"],["disjoint_union","topology"],["subspace","topology"]],"members":["subspace","disjoint_union","function","intersection","continuous","projection","product","net","union"],"related":["Topology","Mathematics","Cartesian_product","Topological_space","Natural_topology","Box_topology","Product_(category_theory)","Comparison_of_topologies","Index_set","Projection_(set_theory)","Coarsest_topology","Continuous_(topology)","Subbase","Subset","Union_(set_theory)","Intersection_(set_theory)","Open_cylinder","Cylinder_set","Box_topology","Finer_topology","Standard_topology","Real_line","Euclidean_topology","Cantor_set","Homeomorphic","Countable","Discrete_space","Irrational_number","Natural_number","Initial_topology","Universal_property","Commutative_diagram","Product_(category_theory)","Category_of_topological_spaces","If_and_only_if","Open_map","Subspace_(topology)","Closed_map","Sequence","Net_(mathematics)","Real_number","Function_(mathematics)","Tychonoff's_theorem","Compact_space","Axiom_of_choice","T0_space","T1_space","Hausdorff_space","Regular_space","Tychonoff_space","Normal_space","Tychonoff's_theorem","Locally_compact_space","Connectedness","Axiom_of_choice","Tychonoff's_theorem","Disjoint_union_(topology)","Initial_topology","Quotient_space","Subspace_(topology)"]}
