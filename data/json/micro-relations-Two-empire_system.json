It classified life into Prokaryota and Eukaryota. When the three-\ndomain system was introduced, some biologists preferred the two-superkingdom\nsystem, claiming that the three-domain system overemphasized the division\nbetween Archaea and Bacteria. However, given the current state of knowledge and\nthe rapid progress in biological scientific advancement, especially due to\ngenetic analyses, that view has all but vanished.\n\n{| width=\"500\" style=\"margin-left: 0.5em;\"\n!
