It is the opposite of ascribed status.\nIt reflects personal skills, abilities, and efforts. Examples of achieved status\nare being an Olympic athlete, being a criminal, or being a college professor.\n\nStatus is important sociologically because it comes with a set of rights,\nobligations, behaviors, and duties that people occupying a certain position are\nexpected or encouraged to perform. These expectations are referred to as roles.\nFor instance, the role of a \"professor\" includes teaching students, answering\ntheir questions, being impartial, and dressing appropriately.\n","linknr":250,"url":"Achieved_status","recorded":1362676786,"links":18,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Sociological terminology","Socioeconomics","Social status","Sociology index"],"headings":["Achieved status vs. ascribed status","As related to social mobility","Cultural capital","Achieved status in stratification systems around the world","Cultural differences around the world","See also","Bibliography","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c7/SNA_segment.png/180px-SNA_segment.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/03/Surgeon.jpg/250px-Surgeon.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Social_status","Ascribed_status","Role","Ascribed_status","Ascribed_status","Social_mobility","Social_stratification","Social_mobility","Cultural_capital","Pierre_Bourdieu","Social_capital","Rodney_Stark","United_States","Italians","Social_stratification","United_States","Rodney_Stark","Russians","Italians","Bulgarians","Medieval_Europe","Feudalism","Social_mobility","Peasants","Social_class","Ernesto_Laclau","Feudalism","Capitalism","Europe","Caste","India","Goldsmith","Soldier","Dr_B_R_Ambedkar","Caste","Social_status","United_States","Canada","North_Americans","Ascribed_status","Master_status","Social_class","Social_hierarchy","Social_status","Social_structure_of_the_United_States","Status_attainment"]}
