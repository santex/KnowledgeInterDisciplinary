{"cursor":"93788","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Consciousness' is the quality or state of being aware of an external object or\nsomething within oneself. It has\nbeen defined as: subjectivity, awareness, sentience, the ability to experience\nor to feel, wakefulness, having a sense of selfhood, and the executive control\nsystem of the mind. Despite the\ndifficulty in definition, many philosophers believe that there is a broadly\nshared underlying intuition about what consciousness is. As Max\nVelmans and Susan Schneider wrote in The Blackwell Companion to Consciousness:\n\"Anything that we are aware of at a given moment forms part of our\nconsciousness, making conscious experience at once the most familiar and most\nmysterious aspect of our lives.\"\n\nPhilosophers since the time of Descartes and Locke have struggled to comprehend\nthe nature of consciousness and pin down its essential properties. Issues of\nconcern in the philosophy of consciousness include whether the concept is\nfundamentally valid; whether consciousness can ever be explained\nmechanistically; whether non-human consciousness exists and if so how it can be\nrecognized; how consciousness relates to language; whether consciousness can be\nunderstood in a way that does not require a dualistic distinction between mental\nand physical states or properties; and whether it may ever be possible for\ncomputers or robots to be conscious.\n\nAt one time consciousness was viewed with skepticism by many scientists, but in\nrecent years it has become a significant topic of research in psychology and\nneuroscience. The primary focus is on understanding what it means biologically\nand psychologically for information to be present in consciousnessâthat is, on\ndetermining the neural and psychological correlates of consciousness. The\nmajority of experimental studies assess consciousness by asking human subjects\nfor a verbal report of their experiences (e.g., \"tell me if you notice anything\nwhen I do this\"). Issues of interest include phenomena such as subliminal\nperception, blindsight, denial of impairment, and altered states of\nconsciousness produced by psychoactive drugs or spiritual or meditative\ntechniques.\n\nIn medicine, consciousness is assessed by observing a patient's arousal and\nresponsiveness, and can be seen as a continuum of states ranging from full\nalertness and comprehension, through disorientation, delirium, loss of\nmeaningful communication, and finally loss of movement in response to painful\nstimuli. Issues of practical concern include how the presence of\nconsciousness can be assessed in severely ill, comatose, or anesthetized people,\nand how to treat conditions in which consciousness is impaired or\ndisrupted.\n","linknr":1345,"url":"Conscious","recorded":1362567619,"links":86,"instances":["mythology","philosophy","neural_circuitry","philosophy_of_mind","novel","narrative_mode","philosophy_of_mind","biology","philosopher","physiology","philosopher","psychology","philosophy"],"pdf":["http://papers.klab.caltech.edu/29/1/438.pdf","http://papers.klab.caltech.edu/29/1/438.pdf"],"categories":["Article
