[http://nsidc.org/cgi-bin/words/letter.pl?P The\nNational Snow and Ice Data Center Glossary] There are no requirements with\nrespect to size or composition for a body of ice to be termed a polar ice cap,\nnor any geological requirement for it to be over land; only that it must be a\nbody of solid phase matter in the polar region. This causes the term \"polar ice\ncap\" to be something of a misnomer, as the term ice cap itself is applied with\ngreater scrutiny as such bodies must be found over land, and possess a surface\narea of less than 50,000 kmÂ²: larger bodies are referred to as ice sheets.\n\nThe composition of the ice will vary. For example Earth's polar ice caps are\nmainly water ice, while Mars's polar ice caps are a mixture of solid phase\ncarbon dioxide and water ice.\n\nPolar ice caps form because high latitude regions receive less energy in the\nform of solar radiation from the sun than equatorial regions, resulting in lower\nsurface temperatures.\n\nThe Earth's polar ice caps have changed dramatically over the last 12,000 years.\nSeasonal variations of the ice caps takes place due to varied solar energy\nabsorption as the planet or moon revolves around the sun. Additionally, in\ngeologic time scales, the ice caps may grow or shrink due to climate variation.\n","linknr":214,"url":"Polar_ice_cap","recorded":1362371923,"links":28,"instances":["physics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Polar regions of the Earth","Geography of the Arctic","Ice"],"headings":["Earth","Mars","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/83/Mars%2C_as_seen_by_the_Hubble_Telescope.jpg/300px-Mars%2C_as_seen_by_the_Hubble_Telescope.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d3/North_pole_september_ice-pack_1978-2002.png/120px-North_pole_september_ice-pack_1978-2002.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7b/North_pole_february_ice-pack_1978-2002.png/120px-North_pole_february_ice-pack_1978-2002.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/97/The_Earth_seen_from_Apollo_17.jpg/120px-The_Earth_seen_from_Apollo_17.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e0/Antarctica_6400px_from_Blue_Marble.jpg/200px-Antarctica_6400px_from_Blue_Marble.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/62/Mars_NPArea-PIA00161_modest.jpg/200px-Mars_NPArea-PIA00161_modest.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["sublimation","physics"]],"members":["sublimation"],"related":["Hubble_Telescope","High_latitude","Planet","Natural_satellite","Ice","Polar_region","Ice_cap","Ice_sheets","Earth","Water","Mars","Carbon_dioxide","Solar_radiation","Sun","Equator","Surface_temperature","Season","Climate","Earth","Apollo_17","NASA","North_pole","Pack_ice","Sea_ice","Arctic_Ocean","Greenland_ice_sheet","National_Snow_and_Ice_Data_Center","South_pole","Antarctica","Antarctic_ice_sheet","Fresh_water","Climate_of_Antarctica","NASA","Polar_region","Viking_1","NASA","JPL","Mars","Planum_Australe","Carbon_dioxide","Sublimation_(physics)","Cryosphere","Ice_age","Polar_climate","Polar_ice_packs"]}
