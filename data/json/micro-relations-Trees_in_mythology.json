{"cursor":"20107","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Tree worship' (dendrolatry) refers to the tendency of many societies throughout\nhistory to worship or otherwise mythologize trees. Trees have played an\nimportant role in many of the world's mythologies and religions, and have been\ngiven deep and sacred meanings throughout the ages. Human beings, observing the\ngrowth and death of trees, the elasticity of their branches, the sensitivity and\nthe annual decay and revival of their foliage, see them as powerful symbols of\ngrowth, decay and resurrection. The most ancient cross-cultural symbolic\nrepresentation of the universe's construction is the world tree.\n\nThe image of the Tree of life is also a favourite in many mythologies. Various\nforms of trees of life also appear in folklore, culture and fiction, often\nrelating to immortality or fertility. These often hold cultural and religious\nsignificance to the peoples for whom they appear. For them, it may also strongly\nbe connected with the motif of the world tree.\n\nOther examples of trees featured in mythology are the Banyan and the Peepal\n(Ficus religiosa) trees in Hinduism, and the modern tradition of the Christmas\nTree in Germanic mythology, the Tree of Knowledge of Judaism and Christianity,\nand the Bodhi tree in Buddhism. In folk religion and folklore, trees are often\nsaid to be the homes of tree spirits. Historical Druidism as well as Germanic\npaganism appear to have involved cultic practice in sacred groves, especially\nthe oak. Taylor, John W. (1979). Tree Worship, in Mankind Quarterly, Sept.,\npp. 79-142. ISSN 0025-2344. The term druid itself possibly derives from\nthe Celtic word for oak.\n\nTrees are a necessary attribute of the archetypical [[locus amoenus]] in all\ncultures. Already the Egyptian Book of the Dead mentions sycomores as part of\nthe scenery where the soul of the deceased finds blissful repose. Gollwitzer\n1984:13.\n\nThe evidence for tree-worship is almost unmanageably large, and since\ncomparative studies do not as yet permit a concise and conclusive synopsis of\nthe subject, this article will confine itself to some of the more prominent\ncharacteristics. in the Flag of Lebanon symbolizes immortality and\nsteadiness. ]]\n","linknr":324,"url":"Trees_in_mythology","recorded":1362373117,"links":23,"instances":["kabbalah","genre","kabbalah"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Mythemes","Mythological archetypes","Trees in mythology|","Religious behaviour and experience","Sacred trees|"],"headings":["Wishing trees","World tree","Religion and folklore","Sacred trees","Sacred groves","In literature","In film","See also","References","Other sources","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/59/Flag_of_Lebanon.svg/250px-Flag_of_Lebanon.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b9/Yggdrasil.jpg/250px-Yggdrasil.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8e/Sefan_and_tree.jpg/170px-Sefan_and_tree.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/12px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/62/PD-icon.svg/12px-PD-icon.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["mythopoeia","genre"],["sephirot","kabbalah"],["tree_of_life","biblical"],["tree_of_life","kabbalah"]],"members":["tree_of_life","mythopoeia","sephirot"],"related":["Trees","Tree","Mythology","Religion","Universe","World_tree","Tree_of_life","Tree_of_life","Immortality","Fertility","Banyan","Sacred_fig","Hinduism","Christmas_Tree","Germany","Tree_of_Knowledge_of_Good_and_Evil","Judaism","Christianity","Bodhi_tree","Buddhism","Folk_religion","Folklore","Tree_spirit","Druidism","Germanic_paganism","Sacred_grove","Oak","Egyptian_Book_of_the_Dead","Sycomore","Flag_of_Lebanon","Europe","Christian","Europe","Nebraska","South_America","Gauchos","Phallic","World_tree","Axis_mundi","Yggdrasil","Norse_mythology","Mesoamerican_world_tree","Cardinal_direction","Tree_of_life","Oral_tradition","Human_being","Tree","Plant","Flower","Egypt","Tale_of_Two_Brothers","Oracles","Dodona","Prussia","Hebrew","Sri_Lanka","India","Arabs","Buddhism","Nang_Takian","Thailand","Burma","African","Ancient_India","Tree_deity","Tamil_Nadu","Tamarind","Kadamba_tree","Birch","Komi_peoples","Great_Perm","Christianity","Islam","Stephan_of_Perm","Cult_image","Jain","Bodhi_Tree","Buddha","Enlightenment_in_Buddhism","Glastonbury_Thorn","Common_Hawthorn","Joseph_of_Arimathea","Christmas","Sacred_grove","Norse_mythology","Celtic_mythology","Nigerian","India","Shinto","Malaysia","J._R._R._Tolkien","Two_Trees_of_Valinor","Mythopoeia_(genre)","William_Butler_Yeats","Lord_of_the_Rings","White_Tree","Minas_Tirith","Gondor","C._S._Lewis","Rick_Riordan","Dryads","Ewok","Forest_moon_of_Endor","Axis_mundi","Celtic_tree_worship","Christmas_Tree","Five_Trees","Gerichtslinde","Irminsul","List_of_tree_deities","Mesoamerican_world_tree","Nature_worship","New_Year_Tree","Sacred_garden","Sacred_grove","Sacred_herbs","Sephirot_(Kabbalah)","Sidrat_al-Muntaha","Talking_trees","Trail_marker_trees","Tree_of_life","Tree_of_life_(biblical)","Tree_of_Life_(Kabbalah)","Tree_of_Knowledge_of_Good_and_Evil","Thor's_oak","Wish_Tree","World_tree","Zapis","James_Forlong"]}
