{"cursor":"1465","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Real income' is the income of individuals or nations after adjusting for\ninflation. It is calculated by subtracting inflation from the nominal income.\nReal variables, such as real income, real GDP, and real interest rate are\nvariables that are measured in physical units, while nominal variables such as\nnominal income, nominal GDP, and nominal interest rate are measured in monetary\nunits. Therefore, real income is a more useful of well-being, since it is based\non the amount of goods and services that can be purchased with the income.\nAccording to the classical dichotomy theory, real variables and nominal\nvariables are separate in the long-run, meaning they are not influenced by each\nother. In other words if the nominal starting income was 100 and there was a 10%\ninflation (general rise in prices e.g.: what cost 10 now costs 11) rate. So now\nwith 100 you can buy less and if your income is not adjusted by inflation (did\nnot rise by 10%),your real income has dropped\n10%. http://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/realincome.asp#axzz1p7SswT9y\n","linknr":110,"url":"Real_income","recorded":1362684306,"links":18,"instances":["mathematics","mathematics","economics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Income"],"headings":[],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/29/ThreeCoins.svg/40px-ThreeCoins.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["real_versus_nominal_value","economics"],["variable","mathematics"],["real_versus_nominal_value","economics"],["rate","mathematics"]],"members":["rate","variable","real_versus_nominal_value"],"related":["Income","Individuals","Nations","Inflation","Calculate","Subtraction","Real_versus_nominal_value_(economics)","Real_variables","Real_GDP","Real_interest_rate","Variable_(mathematics)","Measured","Physical_units","Real_versus_nominal_value_(economics)","Nominal_income_target","Nominal_GDP","Nominal_interest_rate","Monetary_unit","Well-being","Amount","Goods_and_services","Purchasing","Classical_dichotomy","Long-run","Rate_(mathematics)"]}
