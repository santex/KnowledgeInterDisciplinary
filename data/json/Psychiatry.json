These include various affective,\nbehavioural, cognitive and perceptual abnormalities. The term was first coined\nby the German physician Johann Christian Reil in 1808, and literally means the\n'medical treatment of the soul' ([[Wikt:psych|psych-]]: soul; from Ancient Greek\npsykhÄ: soul; [[Wikt:-iatry|-iatry]]: medical treatment; from Gk. iÄtrikos:\nmedical, iÄsthai: to heal). A medical doctor specializing in psychiatry is a\npsychiatrist.\n\nPsychiatric assessment typically starts with a mental status examination and the\ncompilation of a case history. Psychological tests and physical examinations may\nbe conducted, including on occasion the use of neuroimaging or other\nneurophysiological techniques. Mental disorders are diagnosed in accordance with\ncriteria listed in diagnostic manuals such as the widely used [[Diagnostic and\nStatistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM), published by the American\nPsychiatric Association, and the [[International Classification of Diseases]]\n(ICD), edited and used by the World Health Organization. The fifth edition of\nthe DSM (DSM-5) is scheduled to be published in 2013, and its development is\nexpected to be of significant interest to many medical fields.\n\nThe combined treatment of psychoactive medication and psychotherapy has become\nthe most common mode of psychiatric treatment in current\npractice, Psychotherapy in psychiatry, G.O. Gabbard, International Review of\nPsychiatry, [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17365154] but current\npractice also includes widely ranging variety of other modalities. Treatment may\nbe delivered on an inpatient or outpatient basis, depending on the severity of\nfunctional impairment or on other aspects of the disorder in question. Research\nand treatment within psychiatry as a whole are conducted on an interdisciplinary\nbasis, sourcing an array of sub-specialties and theoretical approaches.\n\nControversy has often surrounded psychiatry, and the term anti-psychiatry was\ncoined by psychiatrist David Cooper in 1967. The anti-psychiatry message is that\npsychiatric treatments are ultimately more damaging than helpful to patients,\nand psychiatry's history involves what may now be seen as dangerous\ntreatments. Electroconvulsive therapy was one of these,\nwhich was used widely between the 1930s and 1960s. Lobotomy was another practice\nthat was ultimately seen as too invasive and brutal. Valium and other sedatives\nwere over-prescribed, which led to an epidemic of dependence. There was also\nconcern about the significant increase in prescribing psychiatric drugs for\nchildren. Two charismatic psychiatrists came to personify the movement against\npsychiatry. The most influential of these was R.D. Laing who wrote a series of\nbest-selling books, including [[The Divided Self]]. Thomas Szasz rose to fame\nwith his book [[The Myth of Mental Illness]]. Some ex-patient groups have become\nmilitantly anti-psychiatric, often referring to themselves as \"survivors\".\n","linknr":1555,"url":"Psychiatry","recorded":1362543762,"links":129,"instances":["philosophy","statistics","medicine","philosophy_of_mind","psychiatrist","medicine","hospital","psychology","medical","medicine","behavior","scholar","statistics","psychiatrist","behavior"],"pdf":["http://www.gip-global.org/images/46/516.pdf","http://www.gip-global.org/images/46/516.pdf"],"categories":["Medical
