It is believed that he was born\nMargate, England 17 August 1799, the son of James Laming, a packet owner,\nand Sarah Walton. He had an elder brother James, born 1791, who was a\nprosperous merchant. In 1825, Richard qualified for membership of the Royal\nCollege of Surgeons, and he established a practice in London. {{Cite journal\n | last=Farrar | first=W.

Between 1838 and 1851 he published a series of papers speculating\nabout the electrical makeup of atoms. He hypothesized that there existed sub-\natomic particles of unit charge; perhaps one of the first persons ever to do so.\nHe suggested that the atom was made up of a core of material surrounded by\nconcentric shells of these electrical 'atoms', or particles. {{Cite book\n | first=Jed Z. | last=Buchwald coauthors=Warwick, Andrew | year=2001\n | title=Histories of the Electron publisher=MIT Press | isbn=0-262-52424-4\n | }} He also believed that these particles could be added or subtracted\n | to an atom, changing its charge.\n\nAround 1844, he suggested a mechanism for an insulator as an atom surrounded by\na \"perfect external spherical strata\" of electrical particles. He also supposed\nthat chemical reactions could occur when two atoms share an electrical charge.\nHowever, perhaps because he provided no experimental backing for his ideas, he\nreceived little interest from the Royal Society.\n\nIn 1838 he moved to Paris, where he remained for about a decade. There his ideas\nalso received little interest and he was regarded as eccentric. His medical\npractice apparently ended some time around 1842. When he returned to England his\ninterests leaned toward chemistry, and began working in the coal-gas\nindustry.\n\nHe applied for several patents:\n* 1844, for improvements in the purification and application of\n  ammonia. {{Cite journal\n | title=Patent granted to Richard Laming, London, for certain Improvements in\n | the Purification and Application of Ammonia journal=The Chemical Gazette |\n | year=1844 volume=2 | pages=199â200\n | url=http://books.google.com/?id=GwcAAAAAMAAJ accessdate=2008-09-16 }}\n* 1847, for a continuous recuperator made of iron tubes, which may be the oldest\n  such device known. {{Cite book\n | first=Charles Edward | last=Groves | year=1889 coauthors=Thorp, William;\n | Richardson, Thomas title=Chemical Technology, or Chemistry Applied to Arts\n | and Manufactures publisher=P.

He retired around 1865\nto live along the south coast of England. He died May 3, 1879 in Arundel,\nSussex. He was twice married and had at least two sons.\n","linknr":134,"url":"Richard_Laming","recorded":1363180656,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Richard_Laming&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Richard_Laming&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/Margate","/wiki/England","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/wiki/Membership_of_the_Royal_College_of_Surgeons","#cite_note-farrar-1","/wiki/Electricity","/wiki/Atom","#cite_note-2","#cite_note-farrar-1","/wiki/Royal_Society","#cite_note-farrar-1","/wiki/Paris","/wiki/Chemistry","#cite_note-farrar-1","/wiki/Ammonia","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Recuperator","#cite_note-4","/wiki/Coal_gas","#cite_note-5","/wiki/Alkaline","/wiki/Carbonates","#cite_note-6","#cite_note-7","/wiki/Telegraph","/wiki/Arundel","/wiki/Sussex","#cite_note-farrar-1","/w/index.php?title=Richard_Laming&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Richard_Laming&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-farrar_1-0","#cite_ref-farrar_1-1","#cite_ref-farrar_1-2","#cite_ref-farrar_1-3","#cite_ref-farrar_1-4","/wiki/Digital_object_identifier","http://dx.doi.org/10.1080%2F00033796900200141","#cite_ref-2","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0-262-52424-4","#cite_ref-3","http://books.google.com/?id=GwcAAAAAMAAJ","http://books.google.com/?id=GwcAAAAAMAAJ","#cite_ref-4","http://books.google.com/?id=bs1IAAAAMAAJ","http://books.google.com/?id=bs1IAAAAMAAJ","#cite_ref-5","/wiki/Joseph_Clinton_Robertson","/w/index.php?title=Perry_Fairfax_Nursey&action=edit&redlink=1","http://books.google.com/?id=K_k3AAAAMAAJ","http://books.google.com/?id=K_k3AAAAMAAJ","#cite_ref-6","http://books.google.com/?id=lRSWUY3p3GwC","http://books.google.com/?id=lRSWUY3p3GwC","#cite_ref-7","http://books.google.com/?id=y6hCAAAAIAAJ","http://books.google.com/?id=y6hCAAAAIAAJ","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Richard_Laming&oldid=541002779","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:British_chemists","/wiki/Category:1798_births","/wiki/Category:1897_deaths","/wiki/Category:All_articles_with_unsourced_statements","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_unsourced_statements_from_January_2009","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Richard+Laming&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Richard+Laming","/wiki/Richard_Laming","/wiki/Talk:Richard_Laming","#","/wiki/Richard_Laming","/w/index.php?title=Richard_Laming&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Richard_Laming&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Richard_Laming","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Richard_Laming","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Richard_Laming&oldid=541002779","/w/index.php?title=Richard_Laming&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Richard_Laming&id=541002779","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Richard+Laming","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Richard+Laming&oldid=541002779&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Richard_Laming&printable=yes","//ar.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%AA%D8%B4%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%AF_%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%85%D9%86%D8%AC","//ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Laming","//de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Laming","//es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Laming","//fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Laming","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:ItemByTitle/enwiki/Richard
