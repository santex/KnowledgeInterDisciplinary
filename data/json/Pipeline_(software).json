{"cursor":"11270","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nIn software engineering, a 'pipeline' consists of a chain of processing elements\n(processes, threads, coroutines, etc..), arranged so that the output of each\nelement is the input of the next. Usually some amount of buffering is provided\nbetween consecutive elements. The information that flows in these pipelines is\noften a stream of records, bytes or bits.\n\nThe concept is also called the 'pipes and filters [[software design\npattern|design pattern]]'. It was named by analogy to a physical pipeline.\n\nMultiprocessed pipelines:- Pipelines are often implemented in a multitasking OS,\nby launching all elements at the same time as processes, and automatically\nservicing the data read requests by each process with the data written by the\nupstream process. In this way, the CPU will be naturally switched among the\nprocesses by the scheduler so as to minimize its idle time. In other common\nmodels, elements are implemented as lightweight threads or as coroutines to\nreduce the OS overhead often involved with processes. Depending upon the OS,\nthreads may be scheduled directly by the OS or by a thread manager. Coroutines\nare always scheduled by a coroutine manager of some form.\n\nUsually, read and write requests are blocking operations, which means that the\nexecution of the source process, upon writing, is suspended until all data could\nbe written to the destination process, and, likewise, the execution of the\ndestination process, upon reading, is suspended until at least some of the\nrequested data could be obtained from the source process. Obviously, this cannot\nlead to a deadlock, where both processes would wait indefinitely for each other\nto respond, since at least one of the two processes will soon thereafter have\nits request serviced by the operating system, and continue to run.\n\nFor performance, most operating systems implementing pipes use pipe buffers,\nwhich allow the source process to provide more data than the destination process\nis currently able or willing to receive. Under most Unices and Unix-like\noperating systems, a special command is also available which implements a pipe\nbuffer of potentially much larger and configurable size, typically called\n\"buffer\". This command can be useful if the destination process is significantly\nslower than the source process, but it is anyway desired that the source process\ncan complete its task as soon as possible. E.g., if the source process consists\nof a command which reads an audio track from a CD and the destination process\nconsists of a command which compresses the waveform audio data to a format like\nMP3. In this case, buffering the entire track in a pipe buffer would allow the\nCD drive to spin down more quickly, and enable the user to remove the CD from\nthe drive before the encoding process has finished.\n\nSuch a buffer command can be implemented using system calls for reading and\nwriting data. Wasteful busy waiting can be avoided by using facilities such as\npoll or select or multithreading.\n","linknr":193,"url":"Pipeline_(software)","recorded":1363546512,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Pipeline_(software)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Pipeline_(software)&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/Pipeline_(Unix)","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/Mergefrom.svg/50px-Mergefrom.svg.png","/wiki/Pipeline_programming","/wiki/Wikipedia:Merging","/wiki/Talk:Pipeline_(software)","/wiki/Software_engineering","/wiki/Process_(computing)","/wiki/Thread_(computer_science)","/wiki/Coroutine","/wiki/Buffer_(computer_science)","/wiki/Stream_(computing)","/wiki/Record_(computer_science)","/wiki/Byte_stream","/wiki/Bitstream","/wiki/Software_design_pattern","/wiki/Pipeline_transport","/wiki/Computer_multitasking","/wiki/Operating_system","/wiki/Central_processing_unit","/wiki/Scheduling_(computing)","/wiki/Deadlock","/wiki/Buffer_(computer_science)","/wiki/CD","/wiki/Waveform","/wiki/MP3","/wiki/System_call","/wiki/Busy_waiting","/w/index.php?title=Poll_(Unix)&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Select_(Unix)","/wiki/Thread_(computer_science)","#VM.2FCMS_and_MVS","#Pseudo-pipelines","#Object_pipelines","#Pipelines_in_GUIs","#Other_considerations","#History","#See_also","#Notes","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Pipeline_(software)&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Hartmann_pipeline","/wiki/VM/CMS","/wiki/MVS","/wiki/File_descriptor","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/w/index.php?title=Pipeline_(software)&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Temporary_file","/wiki/Central_processing_unit","/wiki/Command_line_interpreter","/wiki/MS-DOS","/wiki/Pipeline_(Unix)","/wiki/Command_prompt","/wiki/Yes_(Unix)","/w/index.php?title=Pipeline_(software)&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/Windows_PowerShell","/wiki/Microsoft_.NET","/wiki/Channel_(programming)","/wiki/Limbo_programming_language","/wiki/IPython","/w/index.php?title=Pipeline_(software)&action=edit&section=4","/wiki/RISC_OS","/wiki/ROX_Desktop","/wiki/Dialog_box","/wiki/File_manager","/wiki/Program_(computing)","/wiki/Icon_(computing)","/wiki/Drag-and-drop","/wiki/World-wide_web","/wiki/Image_editor","/w/index.php?title=Pipeline_(software)&action=edit&section=5","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Filter_(software)","/wiki/Functional_programming","/wiki/Monads_in_functional_programming","/wiki/I/O","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Apache_Cocoon","/wiki/Software_framework","/wiki/XProc","/wiki/GUI","/w/index.php?title=Pipeline_(software)&action=edit&section=6","/wiki/Douglas_McIlroy","/wiki/Unix_shell","/wiki/Software_componentry","/wiki/DOS","/wiki/OS/2","/wiki/Windows_NT","/wiki/BeOS","/wiki/AmigaOS","/wiki/MorphOS","/wiki/Mac_OS_X","/w/index.php?title=Pipeline_(software)&action=edit&section=7","/wiki/Anonymous_pipe","/wiki/Component-based_software_engineering","/wiki/GStreamer","/wiki/Named_pipe","/wiki/Pipeline_(computing)","/wiki/Pipeline_(Unix)","/wiki/Unix","/wiki/Plumber_(program)","/wiki/Plan_9_from_Bell_Labs","/wiki/Programming_in_the_large","/wiki/Software_design_pattern","/wiki/Producer-consumer_problem","/wiki/XML_pipeline","/wiki/XML","/w/index.php?title=Pipeline_(software)&action=edit&section=8","#cite_ref-1","#cite_ref-2","http://okmij.org/ftp/Computation/monadic-shell.html","/w/index.php?title=Pipeline_(software)&action=edit&section=9","http://www.fullchipdesign.com/pipeline_space_time_architecture.htm","http://www.futurechips.org/parallel-programming-2/parallel-programming-clarifying-pipeline-parallelism.html","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pipeline_(software)&oldid=543900125","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Software_design_patterns","/wiki/Category:Programming_paradigms","/wiki/Category:Inter-process_communication","/wiki/Category:Articles_to_be_merged_from_August_2010","/wiki/Category:All_articles_to_be_merged","/wiki/Category:All_articles_with_unsourced_statements","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_unsourced_statements_from_February_2012","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Pipeline+%28software%29&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Pipeline+%28software%29","/wiki/Pipeline_(software)","/wiki/Talk:Pipeline_(software)","#","/wiki/Pipeline_(software)","/w/index.php?title=Pipeline_(software)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Pi
