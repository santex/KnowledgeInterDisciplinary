{"cursor":"12551","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n feeding on a flower's nectar]] 'Nectar' is a sugar-rich liquid produced by\n plants. It is produced in glands called 'nectaries', either within the flowers\n in which it attracts pollinating animals, or by 'extrafloral nectaries' which\n provide a nutrient source to animal mutualists, which in turn provide anti-\n herbivore protection. Common nectar-consuming pollinators include bees,\n butterflies and moths, hummingbirds and bats.\n\nNectar is an ecologically important item, the sugar source for honey. It is also\nuseful in agriculture and horticulture because the adult stages of some\npredatory insects feed on nectar such as almost all solitary wasps. In turn,\nthese wasps then hunt agricultural pest insects as food for their young. For\nexample, thread-waisted wasps (genus [[Ammophila (Sphecidae)|Ammophila]]) are\nknown for hunting caterpillars that are destructive to crops.\n\nNectar secretion increases as the flower is visited by pollinators. After\npollination, the nectar is frequently reabsorbed into the plant.\n","linknr":318,"url":"Nectar","recorded":1362372963,"links":67,"instances":["biology","chemistry","botany","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Flowers","Honey","Insect ecology","Pollination","Mount Olympus","Ancient Greek cuisine"],"headings":["Etymology","Floral nectaries","Extrafloral nectaries","Natural components of nectar","See also","References","Bibliography","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/Nectar.jpg/220px-Nectar.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/Australian_painted_lady_feeding_closeup.jpg/220px-Australian_painted_lady_feeding_closeup.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/de/Cherry_petiole_glands.JPG/180px-Cherry_petiole_glands.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e9/Prunus_africana_nectaries.jpg/180px-Prunus_africana_nectaries.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/66/Ants_on_Drynaria.jpg/220px-Ants_on_Drynaria.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["mutualism","biology"],["petiole","botany"],["family","biology"],["volatility","chemistry"]],"members":["mutualism","volatility","petiole","family"],"related":["Sugar","Flower","Pollination","Mutualism_(biology)","Pollinator","Bee","Butterfly","Moth","Hummingbird","Honey","Agriculture","Horticulture","Genus","Caterpillar","Latin","Latin","Greek_language","PIE","Ambrosia","AD","Perianth","Anthers","Pistil","Pollination","Petiole_(botany)","Stipule","Cotyledon","Fruit","Plant_stem","Trichome","Vascular_tissue","Frond","Herbivore","Ant","Wasp","Passiflora","Carnivorous_plant","Prey","Excretion","Hydathode","Italian_people","Botanist","Federico_Delpino","Monograph","Charles_Darwin","Myrmecophilic","Vascular_plant","Genus","Family_(biology)","Flowering_plant","Eudicot","Rosids","Fabaceae","Passifloraceae","Malvaceae","Salicaceae","Rosaceae","Malvaceae","Fern","Cyatheales","Polypodiales","Bryophyte","Gymnosperm","Angiosperm","Magnoliids","Apiales","Phylogenetic","Evolution","Sucrose","Glucose","Fructose","Utah","Volatility_(chemistry)","Nicotine","Chemical_&_Engineering_News","Aesculin","California_Buckeye","Amino_acid","Alanine","Arginine","Serine","Proline","Glycine","Isoleucine","Threonine","Valine","Nectar_guide","Nectar_source","Nectarivore","Northern_nectar_sources_for_honey_bees"]}
