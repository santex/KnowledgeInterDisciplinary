{"cursor":"2203","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Identification' in biology is the process of assigning a pre-existing taxon\nname to an individual organism. Identification of organisms to individual\nscientific names (or codes) may be based on individualistic natural body\nfeatures (e. g.), [http://www.environment.gov.au/coasts/publications/ballina-workshop-\n2004/pubs/burns.pdf Photographic identification of individual humpback whales\n(Megaptera novaeangliae) on their southern migration past Ballina, NSW, with\ncomparisons to other humpback whale databases from eastern Australia ] experimentally created individual markers (e.g.,\ncolor dot patterns), or natural individualistic molecular markers (similar to\nthose used in maternity or paternity identification tests). Individual\nidentification is used, e.g., in ecology, wildlife management or conservation\nbiology. The more common form of identification is the identification of\norganisms to common (e. g., \"lion\") scientific (e. g., \"Panthera leo\") class\nnames. By necessity this is based on inherited features (\"characters\") of the\nsexual organisms, the inheritance forming the basis of defining a class. The\nfeatures may, e. g., be morphological, anatomical, physiological, behavioral, or\nmolecular.\n\nThe term \"determination\" may occasionally be used as a synonym for\nidentification (e. g.), Osborne, D. V. 1963. Some Aspects of the theory of\ndichotomous keys. New Phytologist, 62 (2): 144-160. or as in\n\"determination\nslips\".
