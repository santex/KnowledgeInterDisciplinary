This gesture is most commonly used to refuse giving\nof aid or to disagree with the target of gesture. Usually it is connected with\nrequests for a financial loan or assistance with performing physical work.\n\nAnother use of this gesture is for warding off evil eye, jealousy, etc.\n\nRecently, it has also become a common term in Padonkaffsky jargon to refer to\nControl-Alt-Delete. Svitlana Pyrkalo, a producer at the BBC World Ukrainian\nService, explained that \"you need three fingers to press the buttons. So it's\nlike telling somebody (a computer in this case) to get lost.\"\n\nThe letter \"T\" in the American manual alphabet is identical to this gesture.\n","linknr":223,"url":"Fig_sign","recorded":1362371506,"links":19,"instances":["gesture"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Hand gestures"],"headings":["International nomenclature","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e4/Gesture_fist_with_thumb_through_fingers.jpg/220px-Gesture_fist_with_thumb_through_fingers.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["finger","gesture"]],"members":["finger"],"related":["Turkish_culture","Slavic_culture","Finger_(gesture)","Glans_penis","Metonym","Evil_eye","Padonkaffsky_jargon","Control-Alt-Delete","BBC_World","BBC_Ukrainian","American_manual_alphabet","Italy","The_finger","Dante_Alighieri","Republic_of_Macedonia","Rose_hip","Greece","Ionian_Islands","Moutza","I've_got_your_nose"]}
