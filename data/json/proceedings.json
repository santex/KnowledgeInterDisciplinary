They are usually distributed as printed\nvolumes or in electronic form either before the conference opens or after it has\nclosed. Proceedings contain the contributions made by researchers at the\nconference. They are the written record of the work that is presented to fellow\nresearchers.\n\nThe collection of papers is organized by one or more persons, who form the\neditorial team. The quality of the papers is typically ensured by having\nexternal people read the papers before they are accepted in the proceedings.\nThis process is called reviewing. Depending on the level of the conference, this\nprocess including making revisions can take up to a year. The editors decide\nabout the composition of the proceedings, the order of the papers, and produce\nthe preface and possibly other pieces of text. Although most changes in papers\noccur on basis of consensus between editors and authors, editors can also single-\nhandedly make changes in papers.\n\nSince the collection of papers comes from individual researchers, the character\nof proceedings is distinctly different from a textbook. Each paper typically is\nquite isolated from the other papers in the proceedings. Mostly there is no\ngeneral argument leading from one contribution to the next. In some cases, the\nset of contributions is so coherent and high-quality, that the editors of the\nproceedings may decide to further develop the proceedings into a textbook (this\nmay even be a goal at the outset of the conference).\n\nProceedings are published in-house, by the organizing institution of the\nconference, or via an academic publisher. For example, the [[Lecture Notes\nin Computer Science]] by Springer take much of their input from proceedings.\nIncreasingly, proceedings are published in electronic format via the\ninternet or on CD.\n\nIn the sciences, the quality of publications in conference proceedings is\nusually not as high as that of international scientific journals. It should be\nnoted, however, that a number of full-fledged academic journals unconnected to\nparticular conferences also use the word \"proceedings\" as part of their name,\nfor example, [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United\nStates of America|Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA]].\n","title":"proceedings","headings":[]},"micro-relation":["2: Textbook","1: United_States_Naval_Institute","1: Academic_paper","1: Academic_conference","1: Peer_review","1: Editing","1: Academic_publishing","1: Scientific_journal","1: Academic_journal"]}
