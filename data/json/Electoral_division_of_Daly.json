{"cursor":"4855","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"{{Infobox Australian Electorate | |name = Daly |state = nt |image = |caption =\n|created = 2001 |abolished= |mp = Gary Higgins |mp-party = Country Liberal Party\n|namesake = Daly River |electors = 5,329 (2012) |area = 81818 |class = Remote }}\n\n'Daly' is an electoral division of the Legislative Assembly in Australia's\nNorthern Territory. It was created in 2001, and takes its name from the Daly\nRiver region which lies at the heart of the electorate. Daly covers some 81,818\nkmÂ², encompassing the towns of Adelaide River, Acacia Hills, Batchelor, Dundee,\nNauiyu Nambiyu, Pine Creek, Timber Creek and Wadeye. There were 5,329 people\nenrolled in the electorate as of August 2012.\n\nDaly is the newest electorate in the Northern Territory, having only been\ncreated in 2001. It replaced the Victoria River electorate, which had been\nabolished when its namesake was moved out of the electorate by a\nredistribution. While Victoria River had been held by the Australian Labor\nParty in the past, Daly appeared on paper to be a safe seat for the Country\nLiberal Party, having been held easily by then-member Tim Baldwin. However, he\nretired at the 2005 election. While the CLP candidate, Debbi Aloisi, was widely\npredicted to succeed him, she was ultimately defeated by ALP candidate Rob\nKnight. In the lead-up to the election, there had been almost no suggestion\nthat Knight had any chance of defeating Aloisi. However, on election night the\nCLP primary vote almost halved, and Knight won on a two-party swing of 24.6\npercentâalmost unheard of in Australian politics-and turned Daly from a safe\nCLP seat into a safe Labor seat in one stroke. Knight actually took the seat\nwithout the need for preferences. He was re-elected in 2008, but was defeated\nby CLP candidate Gary Higgins in 2012.\n","linknr":163,"url":"Electoral_division_of_Daly","recorded":1374545092,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Electoral_division_of_Daly&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Electoral_division_of_Daly&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Northern_Territory","/wiki/Northern_Territory_Legislative_Assembly","/wiki/States_and_territories_of_Australia","/wiki/Northern_Territory","/wiki/Member_of_Parliament","/wiki/Gary_Higgins_(politician)","/wiki/List_of_political_parties_in_Australia","/wiki/Country_Liberal_Party","/wiki/Daly_River","/wiki/Voting","/wiki/Area","/wiki/Electoral_divisions_of_the_Northern_Territory","/wiki/Northern_Territory_Legislative_Assembly","/wiki/Australia","/wiki/Northern_Territory","/wiki/Daly_River","/wiki/Adelaide_River,_Northern_Territory","/wiki/Acacia_Hills,_Northern_Territory","/wiki/Batchelor,_Northern_Territory","/wiki/Dundee,_Northern_Territory","/w/index.php?title=Nauiyu_Nambiyu,_Northern_Territory&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Pine_Creek,_Northern_Territory","/wiki/Timber_Creek,_Northern_Territory","/wiki/Wadeye,_Northern_Territory","/wiki/Electoral_division_of_Victoria_River","/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party","/wiki/Country_Liberal_Party","/wiki/Tim_Baldwin","/wiki/Northern_Territory_legislative_election,_2005","/wiki/Rob_Knight_(politician)","/wiki/Gary_Higgins_(politician)","#Members_for_Daly","#Election_results","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Electoral_division_of_Daly&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Tim_Baldwin","/wiki/Country_Liberal_Party","/wiki/Rob_Knight_(politician)","/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party","/wiki/Gary_Higgins_(politician)","/wiki/Country_Liberal_Party","/w/index.php?title=Electoral_division_of_Daly&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Electoral_results_for_the_division_of_Daly","/wiki/Northern_Territory_general_election,_2012","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Country_Liberal_Party","/wiki/Gary_Higgins_(politician)","/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party","/wiki/Rob_Knight_(politician)","/wiki/Australian_Greens","/wiki/The_First_Nations_Political_Party","/wiki/Voter_turnout","/wiki/Country_Liberal_Party","/wiki/Gary_Higgins_(politician)","/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party","/wiki/Rob_Knight_(politician)","/wiki/Country_Liberal_Party","/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party","/wiki/Swing_(politics)","/w/index.php?title=Electoral_division_of_Daly&action=edit&section=3","#cite_ref-1","http://www.ntec.nt.gov.au/ElectionLAgeneral/Results/Pages/default.aspx","/w/index.php?title=Electoral_division_of_Daly&action=edit&section=4","http://www.ntec.nt.gov.au/ElectionLAgeneral/DivisionProfiles/Pages/Division%20of%20Daly.aspx","/wiki/Template:Electoral_divisions_of_the_Northern_Territory","/wiki/Template_talk:Electoral_divisions_of_the_Northern_Territory","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Electoral_divisions_of_the_Northern_Territory&action=edit","/wiki/Electoral_divisions_of_the_Northern_Territory","/wiki/Electoral_division_of_Arafura","/wiki/Electoral_division_of_Araluen","/wiki/Electoral_division_of_Arnhem","/wiki/Electoral_division_of_Barkly","/wiki/Electoral_division_of_Blain","/wiki/Electoral_division_of_Braitling","/wiki/Electoral_division_of_Brennan","/wiki/Electoral_division_of_Casuarina","/wiki/Electoral_division_of_Drysdale","/wiki/Electoral_division_of_Fannie_Bay","/wiki/Electoral_division_of_Fong_Lim","/wiki/Electoral_division_of_Goyder","/wiki/Electoral_division_of_Greatorex","/wiki/Electoral_division_of_Johnston","/wiki/Electoral_division_of_Karama","/wiki/Electoral_division_of_Katherine","/wiki/Electoral_division_of_Namatjira","/wiki/Electoral_division_of_Nelson_(Northern_Territory)","/wiki/Electoral_division_of_Nhulunbuy","/wiki/Electoral_division_of_Nightcliff","/wiki/Electoral_division_of_Port_Darwin","/wiki/Electoral_division_of_Sanderson","/wiki/Electoral_division_of_Stuart","/wiki/Electoral_division_of_Wanguri","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Electoral_division_of_Daly&oldid=550339033","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Electoral_divisions_of_the_Northern_Territory","/wiki/Category:Northern_Territory_articles_missing_geocoordinate_data","/wiki/Category:All_articles_needing_coordinates","/w/
