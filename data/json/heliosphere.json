Although electrically neutral atoms from the extra-solar volume\ncan penetrate this bubble, virtually all of the material in the heliosphere\nemanates from the Sun itself. The Sun's Corona is so hot that particles reach\nescape velocity, streaming outwards at 300 to 800 km/s (1 to 2 million mph)\nproducing the solar wind.<ref>[http://solarscience.msfc.nasa.gov/SolarWind.shtml\nThe Solar Wind]</ref>\n\nFor the first ten billion kilometers of its radius, the solar wind travels at\nover 1,000,000 km/h.<ref name=speed></ref> As it begins to interact with the\ninterstellar medium, it slows down before finally ceasing altogether. The point\nwhere the solar wind begins to slow is called the termination shock; the solar\nwind continues to slow as it passes through the heliosheath leading to a\nboundary called the heliopause where the interstellar medium and solar wind\npressures balance. The termination shock was successfully detected by both\nVoyager 1 in 2004,<Ref name=voyager/> and Voyager 2 in 2007.<ref>[http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/voyager/voyager-\n20071210.html Voyager 2 Proves Solar System Is Squashed NASA.gov #2007-12-\n10]</ref>\n\nAs the sun is moving through space it was assumed that beyond the heliopause\nthere might be a '[[bow shock]]', similar to a bow wave created as a ship passes\nthrough water, where the interstellar medium collides with the heliosphere.\nHowever, data from the Interstellar Boundary Explorer suggests that the velocity\nof the Sun through the interstellar medium is too low for a bow shock to\nform.<ref name=physorg20120511></ref> Also, Cassini and IBEX data challenged the\n\"heliotail\" theory in 2009.<ref name=jhopkins/><ref name=ibex09/> Voyager data\nled to a new theory that the heliosheath has \"magnetic bubbles\" and a stagnation\nzone.<ref name=stag/><ref>[http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/voyager/multimedia-\n/20110609_briefing_materials.html NASA 2011]</ref>\n\nThe 'stagnation region' within the heliosheath, starting around 113 AU, was\ndetected by Voyager 1 in 2010.<ref\nname=stag>[http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/voyager/voyager20111205.html NASA's\nVoyager Hits New Region at Solar System Edge 12.05.11]</ref> There the solar\nwind velocity drops to zero, the magnetic field intensity doubles, and high-\nenergy electrons from the galaxy increase 100-fold.<ref name=stag/> Starting in\nMay 2012 at 120 AU,<!-- Voyager 1 was 119.9 AU in March 2012, traveling at 3.6\nAU per year--> Voyager 1 detected a sudden increase in cosmic rays, an apparent\nsignature of approach to the heliopause.<ref\nname=rays>[http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/voyager/voyager20120614.html NASA =\nData From NASA's Voyager 1 Point to Interstellar Future 06.14.12]</ref> In\nDecember 2012 NASA announced that in late August 2012 Voyager 1, at about 122 AU\nfrom the Sun, entered a new region they called the \"magnetic highway\", an area\nstill under the influence of the Sun, but with some dramatic differences.<Ref\nname=voyager>[http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2012-381 NASA\nVoyager 1 Encounters New Region in Deep Space]</ref>\n",
