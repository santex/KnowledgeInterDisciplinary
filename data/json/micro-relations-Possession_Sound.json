Possession Sound\nconnects the main Puget Sound basin to the south with Saratoga Passage and\nPort Susan to the north. The Snohomish River flows into Possession Sound at\nPort Gardner Bay. Gedney Island, also called Hat Island, is located in\nPossession Sound.\n\nPossession Sound was named by George Vancouver. On June 3, 1792, Vancouver\nlanded near the present site of Everett and celebrated the birthday of George\nIII by holding a ceremony claiming possession of the land of \"New Georgia\" for\nBritain. Due to his circumnavigation of the world, Vancouver's dates\nare off by one. June 3 was, by his reckoning, June 4, the king's birthday. His\npossession ceremony also involved the naming of Possession Sound, Port Gardner,\nPort Susan, and the Gulf of Georgia.\n\nIn 1825 a large piece of the southern tip of Camano Island slid into Possession\nSoundâan event known as the Great Slide. A resultant tsunami from the slide\ndrowned many Indian residents of nearby Hat Island. After that, the Tulalip\nIndians used the site only for seasonal clamming. http://www.historylink.or-\ng/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&file_id=8852\n\nThe Washington State Route 525, Mukilteo-Clinton passenger ferry run crosses the\nnarrowest section of Possession Sound.\n","linknr":127,"url":"Possession_Sound","recorded":1362570359,"links":17,"instances":["washington"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Estuaries of Washington (state)","Everett, Washington","Landforms of Island County, Washington","Landforms of Puget Sound","Landforms of Snohomish County, Washington"],"headings":["References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/54/Flag_of_Washington.svg/30px-Flag_of_Washington.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/54/Flag_of_Washington.svg/30px-Flag_of_Washington.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["washington","u.s._state"],["gedney_island","washington"],["gedney_island","washington"]],"members":["gedney_island","washington"],"related":["Puget_Sound","U.S._state","Washington_(U.S._state)","Whidbey_Island","Snohomish_County,_Washington","Everett,_Washington","Mukilteo,_Washington","Saratoga_Passage","Port_Susan","Snohomish_River","Port_Gardner_Bay","Gedney_Island_(Washington)","George_Vancouver","George_III_of_the_United_Kingdom","Strait_of_Georgia","Camano_Island","Tsunami","Gedney_Island_(Washington)","Tulalip","Washington_State_Route_525","Mukilteo,_Washington","Clinton,_Washington","Washington_State_Ferries"]}
