It annotates\nthe number of full rotations completed in one minute around a fixed axis. It is\nused as a measure of rotational speed of a mechanical component.\n\nStandards organizations generally recommend the symbol 'r/min', which is more\nconsistent with the general use of unit symbols. This is not enforced as an\ninternational standard. In French for example, 'tr/mn' () is commonly used, and\nthe German equivalent reads 'U/min' ().\n","linknr":191,"url":"Revolutions_per_minute","recorded":1362568439,"links":46,"instances":["angular_velocity","audio_cd_standard","geometry"],"pdf":["http://www.llnl.gov/str/pdfs/04_96.2.pdf","http://www.llnl.gov/str/pdfs/04_96.2.pdf"],"categories":["Units of frequency"],"headings":["International System of Units","Examples","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/math/2/d/a/2da34c5bf535494a4b238be94df1a16a.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/6/9/1/6913be85dd2c632d521577ad905cd8f0.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["turn","geometry"],["red_book","audio_cd_standard"],["orders_of_magnitude","angular_velocity"],["turn","geometry"]],"members":["orders_of_magnitude","red_book","turn"],"related":["Frequency","Turn_(geometry)","Rotation_around_a_fixed_axis","Rotational_speed","Standards_organization","Germany","International_System_of_Units","Semantics","Annotation","Physical_quantity","Frequency","Angular_velocity","Hertz","Radian_per_second","Hertz","Gramophone_record","Dental_drill","Red_Book_(audio_CD_standard)","DVD","CDDA","Washing_machine","AC_power_plugs_and_sockets","Automobile","Engine","Formula_One_engines","V8_engine","F1_car","Straight_engine","Four-stroke_engine","Crankshaft","Aircraft_engine","Hard_drive","Advanced_Technology_Attachment","Serial_ATA","SCSI","Fibre_Channel","Solid-State_Disk","Floppy_disc","Zippe-type_centrifuge","Gas_turbine","JetCat","Flywheel_energy_storage","Turbocharger","Orders_of_magnitude_(angular_velocity)","Constant_linear_velocity","Constant_angular_velocity","Turn_(geometry)"]}
