Although in past it was mostly\nused to refer to religious groups, it has since expanded and in modern culture\ncan refer to any organization that breaks away from a larger one to follow a\ndifferent set of rules and principles. The term is occasionally used in a\nmalicious way to suggest the broken-off group follows a more negative path than\nthe original. The historical usage of the term sect in Christendom has had\npejorative connotations, referring to a group or movement with heretical beliefs\nor practices that deviate from those of groups considered orthodox.

A sect was a movement committed to\nheretical beliefs and often to ritual acts and practices like isolation that\ndeparted from orthodox religious procedures.\"\n\nA sect as used in an Indian context refers to an organized tradition.\n","linknr":363,"url":"Sect","recorded":1362477186,"links":60,"instances":["religious_practice","sociology_of_religion"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Sociology of religion"],"headings":["Etymology","Sociological definitions and descriptions","In other European languages","In Buddhism","In Christianity","In Hinduism","In Islam","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Catalogue_of_Sects.GIF/280px-Catalogue_of_Sects.GIF","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cult","disambiguation"],["cult","religious_practice"],["ecclesia","sociology_of_religion"]],"members":["cult","ecclesia"],"related":["Religion","Politics","Philosophy","Christendom","Pejorative","Christian_heresy","Bryan_Wilson","Oxford_University_Press","India","Latin","Online_Etymology_Dictionary","Metonym","Homonym","Max_Weber","Ernst_Troeltsch","Church-sect_typology","Religious_denomination","Heresy","Sociology","Rodney_Stark","William_Sims_Bainbridge","Rodney_Stark","Rodney_Stark","William_Sims_Bainbridge","Fred_Kniss","Paul_Numrich","Sectarianism","Sociology_of_religion","Roy_Wallis","Eileen_Barker","Epistemology","Europe","English_language","Cult_(disambiguation)","France","Christendom","Pejorative","Christian_heresy","Bryan_Wilson","Oxford_University_Press","Community_of_the_Lady_of_All_Nations","Palmarian_Catholic_Church","Philippine_Independent_Church","Brazilian_Catholic_Apostolic_Church","Free_Catholic_Church","Society_of_St._Pius_X","Movement_for_the_Restoration_of_the_Ten_Commandments_of_God","Indology","Hinduism","Cult_(religious_practice)","Ecclesia_(sociology_of_religion)","New_religious_movement","One_true_church","One_true_faith"]}
