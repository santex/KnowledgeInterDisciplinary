      "text" : "\n\n\n\n\n\n'Monkfish' (or 'headfish') is the English name of a number of types of fish in\nthe northwest Atlantic, most notably the species of the anglerfish genus\n[[Lophius]] and the angelshark genus [[Squatina]]. The term is also occasionally\nused for a European sea monster more often called a sea monk.\n\nMonkfish is the most common English name for the genus Lophius in the northeast\nAtlantic but goosefish<ref></ref> is used as the equivalent term on the eastern\ncoast of North America. Lophius has three long filaments sprouting from the\nmiddle of the head; these are the detached and modified three first spines of\nthe anterior dorsal fin. As in most anglerfish species, the longest filament is\nthe first (illicium), which terminates in an irregular growth of flesh, the\nesca. This modified fin ray is movable in all directions. This esca is used as a\nlure to attract other fishes, which monkfish then typically swallow whole.\nExperiments have shown that whether the prey has been attracted to the lure or\nnot is not strictly relevant, as the action of the jaws is an automatic reflex\ntriggered by contact with the esca.\n\nIt grows to a length of more than 1.5&nbsp;m (5&nbsp;ft); specimens of 1&nbsp;m\n(3&nbsp;ft) are common. The largest recorded specimen weighed 115 kg (253 lb)\nand was caught on January 7, 2012, by Frank-Rune Kopperud of Norway.<ref></ref>\nThe previous record holder was a specimen of .<ref> |publisher=ba.no |date=2011-12-\n30 |accessdate=2012-01-12}}</ref>\n",
