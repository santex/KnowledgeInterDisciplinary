Since then, life has evolved into a wide variety of forms, which\nbiologists have classified into a hierarchy of taxa. Life can survive and thrive\nin a wide range of conditions. The meaning of life—its significance, origin,\npurpose, and ultimate fate—is a central concept and question in philosophy and\nreligion. Both philosophy and religion have offered interpretations as to how\nlife relates to existence and consciousness, and on related issues such as life\nstance, purpose, conception of a god or gods, a soul or an afterlife. Different\ncultures throughout history have had widely varying approaches to these issues.\n\nThough the existence of life is confirmed on Earth only, many scientists think\nthat extraterrestrial life is not only plausible, but probable or even\ninevitable.<ref name=\"RaceRandolph2002\"></ref><ref></ref> Other planets and\nmoons in the Solar System have been examined for evidence of having once\nsupported simple life, and projects such as SETI have attempted to detect\ntransmissions from possible alien civilizations.
