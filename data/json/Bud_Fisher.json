{"cursor":"4578","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Harry Conway \"Bud\" Fisher' (April 3, 1885 – September 7, 1954) was an\nAmerican cartoonist who created [[Mutt and Jeff (comic strip)|Mutt and Jeff]],\nthe first successful daily comic strip in the United States.\n\nBorn in Chicago, Illinois, Fisher studied at the University of Chicago and then\nwent to work as a journalist and sketch artist in the sports department of the\n[[San Francisco Chronicle]]. In late 1907, he introduced a comic strip character\nnamed Mr. A. Mutt (the initial stood for Augustus) that became instantly popular\nwith readers. In March 1908, Fisher added a second character, the diminutive\nJeff, the opposite of the tall and skinny Mutt.\n\nMutt and Jeff gained such popularity that Fisher, who was able to claim\ncopyright to the characters, received an offer to produce it for the [[San\nFrancisco Examiner]], owned by William Randolph Hearst. The move to the Hearst\nCorporation chain exposed the strip to a multitude of new readers across the\nUnited States.\n\nIn 1911, Nestor Studios of New Jersey acquired the right to make Mutt and Jeff\nshort film comedies, after which Fisher decided he could make more money\ncontrolling film production himself. In 1913, he created the Bud Fisher Film\nCorporation and signed a deal with American PathÃ©. They made 36 Mutt and Jeff\nshort comedies in 1913, but production ceased for two years when Fisher's\ncopyright was challenged. Once the courts upheld Fisher's copyright claim, the\ncomic strip was syndicated nationwide, and between 1916 and 1926, his film\nproduction company created another 277 Mutt and Jeff film productions. On\nthese film projects, Fisher is almost exclusively credited as the writer,\nanimator and director, although the majority of animation was by Raoul BarrÃ©\nand Charles Bowers.\n\nMutt and Jeff was also published in comic book form. The income from multiple\nuses of his characters made Fisher a wealthy man. In 1932, he authorized Al\nSmith to produce the strip under his supervision. Smith drew Mutt and Jeff for\n48 years. When Fisher died in 1954, Smith began signing his own name and\ncontinued to draw the strip until 1980 when George Breisacher took over for its\nfinal two years.\n\nOn October 25 1925, Fisher married Aedita de Beaumont, former wife of Count\nFranÃ§ois de Beaumont. The couple parted after four weeks \"Private Lives\",\nLife magazine, 28 December 1936, page 62 but never divorced, so after\nFisher's death ownership of the strip devolved to Aedita de Beaumont, and on her\ndeath in 1985 to her son (from her earlier marriage with the Count de Beaumont),\nPierre de Beaumont (1915 â 2010).

The New York Times, March 18, 2011.]\n\nFisher died at the age of 69 in New York City and was buried in the Woodlawn\nCemetery in The Bronx.\n","linknr":137,"url":"Bud_Fisher","recorded":1375057758,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Bud_Fisher&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Bud_Fisher&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Budfisherdraws.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/d8/Budfisherdraws.jpg/250px-Budfisherdraws.jpg","/wiki/File:Budfisherdraws.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/Cartoonist","/wiki/Mutt_and_Jeff_(comic_strip)","/wiki/Comic_strip","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/Chicago,_Illinois","/wiki/University_of_Chicago","/wiki/Journalist","/wiki/San_Francisco_Chronicle","/wiki/Copyright","/wiki/San_Francisco_Examiner","/wiki/William_Randolph_Hearst","/wiki/Hearst_Corporation","/wiki/File:Budfisherself.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/82/Budfisherself.jpg/250px-Budfisherself.jpg","/wiki/File:Budfisherself.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Nestor_Studios","/wiki/New_Jersey","/wiki/Short_subject","/wiki/Path%C3%A9_Fr%C3%A8res","/wiki/Raoul_Barr%C3%A9","/wiki/Charles_Bowers","/wiki/Comic_book","/wiki/Al_Smith_(cartoonist)","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Pierre_de_Beaumont","#cite_note-2","/wiki/New_York_City","/wiki/Woodlawn_Cemetery,_Bronx","/wiki/The_Bronx","/w/index.php?title=Bud_Fisher&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Thoroughbred","/wiki/Horse_racing","/wiki/Nellie_Morse","/wiki/Filly","/wiki/Preakness_Stakes","/wiki/Belmont_Stakes","/w/index.php?title=Bud_Fisher&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-1","#cite_ref-2","http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/19/business/19beaumont.html?_r=1&ref=obituaries","http://www.thoroughbredtimes.com/tc99/history/hoofprints/1923/belmont/default.asp","http://www.kyhorsepark.com/imh/cal/cal2.html","/w/index.php?title=Bud_Fisher&action=edit&section=3","http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=4149","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/50691127","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bud_Fisher&oldid=550889002","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1885_births","/wiki/Category:1954_deaths","/wiki/Category:American_comics_artists","/wiki/Category:American_comic_strip_cartoonists","/wiki/Category:American_film_directors","/wiki/Category:American_film_producers","/wiki/Category:American_racehorse_owners_and_breeders","/wiki/Category:Burials_at_Woodlawn_Cemetery_(Bronx)","/wiki/Category:People_from_Chicago,_Illinois","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Bud+Fisher&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Bud+Fisher","/wiki/Bud_Fisher","/wiki/Talk:Bud_Fisher","#","/wiki/Bud_Fisher","/w/index.php?title=Bud_Fisher&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Bud_Fisher&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Bud_Fisher","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Bud_Fisher","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Bud_Fisher&oldid=550889002","/w/index.php?title=Bud_Fisher&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1000471","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Bud_Fisher&id=550889002","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Bud+Fisher","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Bud+Fisher&oldid=550889002&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Bud_Fisher&printable=yes","//de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bud_Fisher","//fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bud_Fisher","//it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bud_Fisher","//ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A4%D0%B8%D1%88%D0%B5%D1
