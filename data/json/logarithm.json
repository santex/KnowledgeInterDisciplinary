For example, the logarithm of 1000\nto base 10 is 3, because 1000 is 10 to the power 3: 10 × 10 × 10\n10<sup>3</sup>.}} More generally, if x = b<sup>y</sup>, then y is the logarithm\nof x to base&nbsp;b, and is written y = log<sub>b</sub>(x), so\nlog<sub>10</sub>(1000) = 3.\n\nThe logarithm to base b = 10 is called the common logarithm and has many\napplications in science and engineering. The natural logarithm has the constant\n{{nowrap begin}}''e'' (≈ 2.718) as its base; its use is widespread in pure\nmathematics, especially calculus. The binary logarithm uses base b = 2 and is\nprominent in computer science.\n\nLogarithms were introduced by John Napier in the early 17th century as a\nmeans to simplify calculations. They were rapidly adopted by navigators,\nscientists, engineers, and others to perform computations more easily, using\nslide rules and logarithm tables. Tedious multi-digit multiplication steps\ncan be replaced by table look-ups and simpler addition because of the\nfact—important in its own right—that the logarithm of a product is the sum of\nthe logarithms of the factors:\n:<math> \\log_b(xy) = \\log_b (x) + \\log_b (y). \\,</math>\nThe present-day notion of logarithms comes from Leonhard Euler, who connected\nthem to the exponential function in the 18th century.\n\nLogarithmic scales reduce wide-ranging quantities to smaller scopes. For\nexample, the decibel is a logarithmic unit quantifying sound pressure and\nvoltage ratios. In chemistry, pH is a logarithmic measure for the acidity of an\naqueous solution. Logarithms are commonplace in scientific formulae, and in\nmeasurements of the complexity of algorithms and of geometric objects called\nfractals. They describe musical intervals, appear in formulae counting prime\nnumbers, inform some models in psychophysics, and can aid in forensic\naccounting.\n\nIn the same way as the logarithm reverses exponentiation, the complex logarithm\nis the inverse function of the exponential function applied to complex numbers.\nThe discrete logarithm is another variant; it has applications in public-key\ncryptography.\n","title":"logarithm","headings":["Motivation and definition","Logarithmic identities","Particular bases","History","Analytic
