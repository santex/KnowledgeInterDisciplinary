Gerber. Sociology.\nToronto: Pearson Canada, 2011. Print. Labeling theory was developed by\nsociologists during the 1960s. Howard Saul Becker's book Outsiders was extremely\ninfluential in the development of this theory and its rise to popularity.\nLabeling theory holds that deviance is not inherent to an act, but instead\nfocuses on the tendency of majorities to negatively label minorities or those\nseen as deviant from standard cultural norms. Labeling theory: Social\nconstructionism, Social stigma, Deinstitutionalisation, George Herbert Mead,\nHoward S. Becker, Labelling The theory is concerned with how the self-\nidentity and behavior of individuals may be determined or influenced by the\nterms used to describe or classify them. It is associated with the concepts of\nself-fulfilling prophecy and stereotyping. The theory was prominent during the\n1960s and 1970s, and some modified versions of the theory have developed and are\nstill currently popular. Unwanted descriptors or categorizations - including\nterms related to deviance, disability or diagnosis of a mental disorder - may be\nrejected on the basis that they are merely \"labels\", often with attempts to\nadopt a more constructive language in its place. A stigma is defined as a\npowerfully negative label that changes a person's self-concept and social\nidentity. Macionis, J., and Gerber, L. (2010).
