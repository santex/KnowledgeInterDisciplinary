It was a part\nof the religion in ancient Greece and is part of religion in modern Greece and\naround the world, known as Hellenismos. Modern scholars refer to and study the\nmyths in an attempt to throw light on the religious and political institutions\nof Ancient Greece and its civilization, and to gain understanding of the nature\nof myth-making itself.\n\nGreek mythology is explicitly embodied in a large collection of narratives, and\nimplicitly in Greek representational arts, such as vase-paintings and votive\ngifts. Greek myth attempts to explain the origins of the world, and details the\nlives and adventures of a wide variety of gods, goddesses, heroes, heroines, and\nmythological creatures. These accounts initially were disseminated in an oral-\npoetic tradition; today the Greek myths are known primarily from Greek\nliterature.\n\nThe oldest known Greek literary sources, Homer's epic poems [[Iliad]] and\n[[Odyssey]], focus on events surrounding the aftermath of the Trojan War. Two\npoems by Homer's near contemporary Hesiod, the [[Theogony]] and the [[Works and\nDays]], contain accounts of the genesis of the world, the succession of divine\nrulers, the succession of human ages, the origin of human woes, and the origin\nof sacrificial practices. Myths are also preserved in the Homeric Hymns, in\nfragments of epic poems of the Epic Cycle, in lyric poems, in the works of the\ntragedians of the fifth century BC, in writings of scholars and poets of the\nHellenistic Age, and in texts from the time of the Roman Empire by writers such\nas Plutarch and Pausanias.\n\nArchaeological findings provide a principal source of detail about Greek\nmythology, with gods and heroes featured prominently in the decoration of many\nartifacts. Geometric designs on pottery of the eighth century BC depict scenes\nfrom the Trojan cycle as well as the adventures of Heracles. In the succeeding\nArchaic, Classical, and Hellenistic periods, Homeric and various other\nmythological scenes appear, supplementing the existing literary evidence. Greek mythology has had an extensive influence on the culture,\narts, and literature of Western civilization and remains part of Western\nheritage and language. Poets and artists from ancient times to the present have\nderived inspiration from Greek mythology and have discovered contemporary\nsignificance and relevance in the themes. J.M.
