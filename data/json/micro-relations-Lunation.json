The length of this cycle is linked to many phenomena in\nnature, such as the variation between (the extreme highest and lowest tides,\nrespectively).\n\nIn a lunar calendar each month corresponds to a lunation.\n\nIndividual lunations vary in length by several hours, because of the\neccentricity of the orbits of the Moon and Earth.  However, the lunation is\nnever more than 15 hours behind or ahead of a mean lunation. Each lunar cycle is\nassigned a unique Lunation Number to identify it.\n","linknr":103,"url":"Lunation","recorded":1362673535,"links":17,"instances":["orbit"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Phases of the Moon"],"headings":["See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4d/Moon-Mdf-2005.jpg/25px-Moon-Mdf-2005.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["eccentricity","orbit"]],"members":["eccentricity"],"related":["Lunar_phase","Synodic_period","Moon","Lunar_calendar","Month","Eccentricity_(orbit)","Orbit","Earth","Lunation_Number","Month","Lunar_phase","New_moon","Full_moon","Full_moon_cycle","Lunar_calendar","Lunisolar_calendar"]}
