It is the world's largest stock exchange by market\ncapitalization of its listed companies at US$14.242 trillion as of Dec 2011. [http://www.world-\nexchanges.org World-exchanges.org] Average daily trading value was\napproximately 153 billion in 2008.\n\nThe NYSE trading floor is located at 11 Wall Street and is composed of four\nrooms used for the facilitation of trading. A fifth trading room, located at 30\nBroad Street, was closed in February 2007. The main building, located at 18\nBroad Street, between the corners of Wall Street and Exchange Place, was\ndesignated a National Historic Landmark in 1978, National Park Service,\n[http://www.cr.nps.gov/nhl/designations/Lists/NY01.pdf National Historic\nLandmarks Survey, New York], Retrieved May 31, 2007. as was the 11 Wall\nStreet building.\n\nThe NYSE is operated by NYSE Euronext (), which was formed by the NYSE's 2007\nmerger with the fully electronic stock exchange Euronext. In December 2012, it\nwas announced that the company would be sold to Intercontinental Exchange (ICE),\na futures exchange headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, for $8 billion, a figure\nthat is significantly less than the $11 billion bid for the company tendered in\n2011. {{citation |title=For the New York Stock Exchange, a sell\norder |first=Steve |last=Rothwell
