{"cursor":"12248","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Turbidity' is the cloudiness or haziness of a fluid caused by individual\nparticles (suspended solids) that are generally invisible to the naked eye,\nsimilar to smoke in air. The measurement of turbidity is a key test of\nwater quality.\n\nFluids can contain suspended solid matter consisting of particles of many\ndifferent sizes. While some suspended material will be large enough and heavy\nenough to settle rapidly to the bottom of the container if a liquid sample is\nleft to stand (the settable solids), very small particles will settle only very\nslowly or not at all if the sample is regularly agitated or the particles are\ncolloidal. These small solid particles cause the liquid to appear turbid.\n\n'Turbidity' (or haze) is also applied to transparent solids such as glass or\nplastic. In plastic production haze is defined as the percentage of light that\nis deflected more than 2.5Â° from the incoming light\ndirection.
