The\npdb format accordingly provides for description and annotation of protein and\nnucleic acid structures including atomic coordinates, observed sidechain\nrotamers, secondary structure assignments, as well as atomic connectivity.\nStructures are often deposited with other molecules such as water, ions, nucleic\nacids, ligands and so on, which can be described in the pdb format as well. The\nProtein Data Bank also keeps data on biological macromolecules in the newer\nmmCIF file format.\n","linknr":120,"url":"Protein_Data_Bank_(file_format)","recorded":1362482892,"links":11,"instances":["programming_language","program"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Computational chemistry","Chemical file formats","Biological databases"],"headings":["Example","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["python","programming_language"],["coot","program"]],"members":["python","coot"],"related":["Chemical_file_format","Protein_Data_Bank","Rotamer","Protein_Data_Bank","Crystallographic_Information_File","Ångström","Chemical_file_format","ScientificPython","Python_(programming_language)","List_of_software_for_molecular_mechanics_modeling","UCSF_Chimera","Cn3D","Coot_(program)","Gabedit","Jmol","Molden","Molekel","PyMOL","RasMol","UGENE","VisIt","Visual_Molecular_Dynamics","Yasara","MMDB","National_Center_for_Biotechnology_Information"]}
