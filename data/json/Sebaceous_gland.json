Dellmann's textbook of veterinary histology (405\npages), Jo Ann Coers Eurell, Brian L. Frappier, 2006, p.29, weblink: [http://books.google.com/books?id=FnS4uiOlRT0C&pg=PA29 &lpg=PA29 Books-Google-RTOC].  In humans, they are found in greatest\nabundance on the face and scalp, though they are distributed throughout all skin\nsites except the palms and soles. In the eyelids,\nmeibomian sebaceous glands secrete a special type of sebum into tears. There are\nseveral related medical conditions, including acne, sebaceous cysts,\nhyperplasia, sebaceous adenoma and sebaceous gland carcinoma (see section below:\n[[#Pathology|Pathology]]).\n","linknr":482,"url":"Sebaceous_gland","recorded":1362486608,"links":55,"instances":["body_piercing","foot","disambiguation","biology"],"pdf":["http://www4.utsouthwestern.edu/moleculargenetics/pdf/dr_cur_res/JBiolChem2004-II.pdf","http://www4.utsouthwestern.edu/moleculargenetics/pdf/dr_cur_res/JBiolChem2004-II.pdf","http://www.summitplc.com/uploads/RNSSeborrhoeatrialFINAL.pdf"],"categories":["Skin anatomy"],"headings":["Locations and morphology","Sebum","Function","Changes during development","Pathology","Importance to other animals","Additional images","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/HairFollicle.png/250px-HairFollicle.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/Skin.png/250px-Skin.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/Haarbalgmilbe.jpg/220px-Haarbalgmilbe.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/29/Pilosebaceous_Unit_4x.JPG/120px-Pilosebaceous_Unit_4x.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cf/Base_of_Pilosebaceous_Unit_10x.JPG/120px-Base_of_Pilosebaceous_Unit_10x.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7c/Insertion_of_sebaceous_glands_into_hair_shaft_x10.jpg/120px-Insertion_of_sebaceous_glands_into_hair_shaft_x10.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c3/Gray893.png/60px-Gray893.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/Gray944.png/120px-Gray944.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["sole","foot"],["cell","biology"],["comedo","disambiguation"],["stretching","body_piercing"]],"members":["stretching","sole","comedo","cell"],"related":["Gland","Skin","Hair","Mammals","Human","Face","Scalp","Meibomian_gland","Acne","Sebaceous_cyst","Sebaceous_hyperplasia","Sebaceous_adenoma","Sebaceous_gland_carcinoma","Acinar_gland","Palms_of_the_hands","Sole_(foot)","Hair_follicle","Arrector_pili","Eyelid","Human_nose","Penis","Labia_minora","Nipple","Meibomian_gland","Human_eye","Tears","Latin","Triglyceride","Wax_esters","Squalene","Cell_(biology)","Holocrine_gland","Seborrhoeic_dermatitis","Bacteria","Earwax","Monoester","Triglyceride","Fatty_acid","Squalene","Sapienic_acid","Isotretinoin","SMT_D002","Spironolactone","Fetus","Vernix_caseosa","Puberty","Androgen","Smegma","Penis","Sexually_transmitted_disease","Labia_minora","Acne_vulgaris","Keratosis_pilaris","Keratin","Comedo_(disambiguation)","Isotretinoin","Anabolic_steroid","Bodybuilder","Muscular_hypertrophy","Sebaceous_hyperplasia","Sebaceous_gland_carcinoma","Cancer","Sebaceous_adenoma","Neoplasm","Stretching_(body_piercing)","Demodex_mite","Preputial_gland","Mouse","Rat","Pheromone","Sebaceous_adenitis","Autoimmune_disease","List_of_specialized_glands_within_the_human_integumentary_system"]}
