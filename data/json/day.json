In\ncommon usage, it is an interval equal to 24 hours.<ref name=Non-SI/> It also can\nmean the consecutive period of time during which the Sun is above the horizon of\na location, also known as daytime. The period of time measured from local noon\nto the following local noon is called a [[solar time|solar day]].<ref>\n\n</ref><ref>\n\n</ref>\n\nSeveral definitions of this universal human concept are used according to\ncontext, need and convenience. In 1967, the second was redefined in terms of\nthe wavelength of light, and it became the SI base unit of time. The unit of\nmeasurement for time called \"day\", redefined in 1967 as 86,400 SI seconds\nand symbolized d, is not an SI unit, but it is accepted for use with SI.<ref\nname=Non-SI>\n\n</ref> A 'civil day' is usually also 86,400 seconds, plus or minus a possible\nleap second in Coordinated Universal Time UTC, and, in some locations,\noccasionally plus or minus an hour when changing from or to daylight saving\ntime. The word day may also refer to a day of the week or to a calendar date, as\nin answer to the question \"On which day?\" Day also refers to the part of the day\nthat is not night — also known as daytime. The life patterns of humans and many\nother species are related to Earth's solar day and the cycle of day and night\n(see circadian rhythms).\n\nThe average length of a solar day on Earth is about 86,400 seconds (24 hours)\nand there are about 365.2422 solar days in one mean tropical year. Because\ncelestial orbits are not perfectly circular, and thus objects travel at\ndifferent speeds at various positions in their orbit, a solar day is not the\nsame length of time throughout the orbital year. A day, understood as the span\nof time it takes for the Earth to make one entire rotation<ref> Some authors\ncaution against identifying \"day\" with rotation period. For example: </ref> with\nrespect to the celestial background or a distant star (assumed to be fixed), is\ncalled [[Rotation period|stellar day]]. This period of rotation is about 4\nminutes less than 24 hours and there are about 366.2422 in one mean tropical\nyear (one more stellar day than the number of solar days). Mainly due to tidal\neffects, the Earth's rotational period is not constant, resulting in further\nminor variations for both solar days and stellar \"days\". Other planets and moons\nalso have stellar and solar days.\n","title":"day","headings":["Introduction","Etymology","International System of Units (SI)","Astronomy","Colloquial","Civil day","Leap seconds","Boundaries of the day","24 hours vs daytime","See also","Notes and references","External links"]},"micro-relation":["3: Leap_second","2: Time","2: Second","2: Daylight_saving_time","2: Tidal_acceleration","2: Solar_time","2: Moon","2: Kilosecond","1: Rabbit","1: Deer","1: Aztec_calendar","1: Calendar","1: Aztec_calendar_stone","1: Hour","1: Noon#Solar_noon","1: SI_base_unit","1: Units_of_measurement","1: International_System_of_Units","1: UTC","1: Week","1: Calendar_date","1: Circadian_rhythm","1: Seconds","1: Tropical_year","1: Rotation","1: List_of_Norse_gods_and_goddesses","1: Peter_Nicolai_Arbo","1: Sunlight","1: Minute_of_arc","1: Earth's_atmosphere","1: Refraction","1: Latitude","1: Longitude","1: Year","1: Sundial","1: Noon","1: Culmination","1: Midnight","1: Celestial_equator","1: Tide","1: Earth's_rotation","1: Rhythmites","1: Sandstone","1: Old_English","1: Dutch_language","1: SI_units","1: Universal_Coordinated_Time","1: Time_standard","1: International_Bureau_of_Weights_and_Measures","1: Radioactive_decay","1: Hyperfine_structure","1: Energy_level","1: Stationary_state","1: Caesium","1: Atom","1: Decimal_time","1: French_Republican_Calendar","1: Astronomy","1: Rotation_period","1: Star","1: Sidereal_time","1: Vernal_equinox","1: Sun","1: Fixed_stars","1: Sidereal_year","1: Horizon","1: Sunrise","1: Sunset","1: 12-hour_clock","1: Morning","1: Evening","1: Night","1: Time_zone","1: Rail_transport","1: Coordinated_Universal_Time","1: International_Earth_Rotation_and_Reference_Systems_Service","1: Diurnality","1: Judaism","1: Middle_Ages","1: Florentine_calendar","1: Christmas_Eve","1: Halloween","1: Agnes_of_Rome","1: Religious_holiday","1: Ancient_Egypt","1: Muslim","1: Damascus_Document","1: Dead_Sea_scrolls","1: Shabbat","1: Videocassette_recorder","1: Public_transport","1: Public_transport_timetable","1: Nederlandse_Spoorwegen","1: London_Regional_Transport","1: Calculating_the_day_of_the_week","1: Daylight","1: Meteorological_day","1: Season","1: Synodic_day","1: Holiday"]}
