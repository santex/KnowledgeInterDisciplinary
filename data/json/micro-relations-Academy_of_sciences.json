Many languages use a broad term for\nsystematized learning which includes both natural and social sciences and fields\nsuch as literary studies, history, art history etc. which are not typically\nlabelled \"sciences\" in English. This can be illustrated by contrasting examples\nfrom the English speaking world and the non-English speaking world. The\nAustralian Academy of Sciences is an organization of natural scientists,\nreflecting the English use of the term \"scientist.\" There are separate academies\nfor Arts, Humanities and Social Science. The Hungarian \"Academy of Science\"\n(Magyar TudomÃ¡nyos AkadÃ©mia) however, has members drawn from many other areas of\nacademia, including those not considered science in English. What has presumably\nhappened is that the Hungarian term \"tudomÃ¡ny\" has been translated as \"science\"\n- in a broad sense as it was used in English 200 years ago, and is still used in\nFrench and other languages.\n\nAs the engineering sciences have become more varied and advanced, there is\na recent trend in many advanced countries to organize the national Academy\nof Engineering (or Engineering Sciences), separate from the national\nAcademy of Sciences.\n\nExamples include:\n* Afghanistan -
