Turgenev started to work on it in 1855, and it was\nfirst published in the literary magazine \"Sovremennik\" in 1856; several changes\nwere made by Turgenev in subsequent editions. It is perhaps the least known of\nTurgenev’s novels.\n\nRudin was the first of Turgenev’s novels, but already in this work the topic of\nthe superfluous man and his inability to act (which became a major theme of\nTurgenev's literary work) was explored. Similarly to other Turgenev’s novels,\nthe main conflict in Rudin was centred on a love story of the main character and\na young, but intellectual and self-conscious woman who is contrasted with the\nmain hero (this type of female character became known in literary criticism as\n«тургеневская девушка», “Turgenev maid”).\n\n__TOC__\n","title":"rudin","headings":["Context","Main characters","Synopsis","Adaptations","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["2: Ivan_Turgenev","2: Sovremennik","1: Political","1: Romance_novel","1: Hardback","1: Paperback","1: Home_of_the_Gentry","1: Novel","1: Superfluous_man","1: Love","1: Crimean_War","1: Slavophiles","1: Hamlet","1: Don_Quixote","1: Pushkin","1: Eugene_Onegin","1: Lermontov","1: Pechorin","1: Novella","1: Gentry","1: Moscow_University","1: Heidelberg_University","1: Berlin_University","1: Berlin","1: St_Petersburg","1: Moscow","1: Biographer","1: Hospital","1: Cavalry","1: Secretary","1: Flattery","1: Raznochinets","1: Eugene_Bazarov","1: Rodion_Romanovich_Raskolnikov","1: Baron","1: University","1: French_Revolution_of_1848","1: Poles","1: Konstantin_Voynov","1: Oleg_Yefremov","1: Armen_Dzhigarkhanyan","1: Rolan_Bykov","1: Project_Gutenberg","1: IMDB"]}
