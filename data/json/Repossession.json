The extent to which repossession is authorized, and how it may be\nexecuted, greatly varies in different jurisdictions (see below).\n","linknr":150,"url":"Repossession","recorded":1362570430,"links":13,"instances":["law","finance"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Personal finance","Property","Personal property law"],"headings":["Procedure of a repossession (United States)","Repossession in various jurisdictions","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Ambox_globe_content.svg/48px-Ambox_globe_content.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["collateral","finance"],["self-help","law"]],"members":["collateral"],"related":["Financial_institution","Collateral_(finance)","Self-help_(law)","Right_of_ownership","Right_of_possession","Financial_institution","Lienholder","Replevin","Tow_truck","Pickup_truck","Vehicle_Identification_Number","Nonrecourse_debt","Jurisdictions","Court_citation","Council_of_Mortgage_Lenders","Ministry_of_Justice","Arrears","Loans","Arrears","BÃ¼rgerliches_Gesetzbuch","Foreclosure"]}
