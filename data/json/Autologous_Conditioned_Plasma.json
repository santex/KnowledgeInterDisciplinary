{"cursor":"2332","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Autologous Blood Injection' (ABI), also known as 'Autologous Conditioned Plasma\n(ACP) Injection' is a recent medical procedure whereby a patient's blood is\ninjected into an area of the body for the purposes of healing. It is most\ncommonly used to treat degeneration of tendons, which may occur in association\nwith small tears. This disorder of tendons is frequently referred to as\n\"tendinitis\" by the public, however is known as tendinosis or tendinopathy in\nthe medical profession. The procedure is usually performed under ultrasound\ncontrol by a radiologist. The injection of blood\ncontains small cells called platelets, which contain platelet derived growth\nfactor. This substance is thought to promote tendon healing. A variation on the\ntechnique is Platelet Rich Plasma(PRP), which is\nwhere the whole blood removed from the patient is spun in a centrifuge,\nseparating the cells of the blood. As such a higher concentration of platelets\nis delivered into the tissue for healing. As yet, there has been no study to\ndemonstrate that a PRP injection is superior to ABI, with both techniques\ndemonstrating improvement in 70-80% of patients.\n","linknr":105,"url":"Autologous_Conditioned_Plasma","recorded":1362540461,"links":13,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Medical treatments","Transfusion medicine"],"headings":["References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/AdhesiveBandage.png/40px-AdhesiveBandage.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Tendinitis","Ultrasound","Radiologist","Platelets","Platelet_derived_growth_factor","Platelet-rich_plasma"]}
