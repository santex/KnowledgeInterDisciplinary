      "text" : "\n\n\n semi-automatic pistol]] fires a full broadside during a target exercise near\n Vieques Island, Puerto Rico, 1 July 1984.]] A 'gun' is a normally tubular\n weapon or other device designed to discharge projectiles or other\n material.<ref>The Chambers Dictionary, Allied Chambers - 1998, \"gun\", page\n 717</ref> The projectile may be solid, liquid, gas or energy and may be free,\n as with bullets and artillery shells, or captive as with Taser probes and\n whaling harpoons. The means of projection varies according to design but is\n usually effected by the action of gas pressure, either produced through the\n rapid combustion of a propellant or compressed and stored by mechanical means,\n operating on the projectile inside an open-ended tube in the fashion of a\n piston. The confined gas accelerates the movable projectile down the length of\n the tube imparting sufficient velocity to sustain the projectile's travel once\n the action of the gas ceases at the end of the tube or muzzle. Alternatively,\n acceleration via electromagnetic field generation may be employed in which case\n the tube may be dispensed with and a guide rail substituted.\n\nThe first devices identified as guns appeared in China around 1000AD, and by the\n12th century the technology was spreading through the rest of Asia, and into\nEurope by the 13th century.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=U-\n5T2Zs5qG8C&pg=PA8&dq=%22the+first+gun%22+china&hl=en&sa=X&ei=9uBZUfHrM4eG0QG8kI-\nG4Cg&ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22the%20first%20gun%22%20china&f=false Judith\nHerbst, The History Of Weapons, Lerner Publications, 2005, page 8]</ref>\n",
