Applied science applies the basic\nscience toward practical endeavors. Applied science is typically engineering,\nwhich develops technology, although there might be feedback between basic\nscience and applied science: research and development (R&D).\n\nMedical sciences, for instance medical microbiology and its clinical virology,\nare applied sciences that apply biology toward medical knowledge and\ninventions, but not necessary medical technology, whose development is more\nspecifically biomedicine or biomedical engineering. Applied science can also\napply formal science, such as statistics and probability theory, as in\nepidemiology. Genetic epidemiology is an applied science applying both\nbiological and statistical methods.\n",
