Two types of sweat glands can be found in\nhumans: Eccrine glands and apocrine glands. The eccrine sweat glands are\ndistributed over much of the body.\n\nIn humans, sweating is primarily a means of thermoregulation which is achieved\nby the water-rich secretion of the eccrine glands. Maximum sweat rates of an\nadult can be up to 2-4 liters per hour or 10-14 liters per day (10-15\ng/minâ¢mÂ²) Jessen,C., Temperature regulation in humans and other mammals,\nSpringer, Berlin, 2000, 193 pp Mack,G.W. and Nadel,E.R., Body fluid\nbalance during heat stress in humans.

In: Fregly,M.J., Blatteis,C.M. (Eds.), Handbook of phys\nEvaporation of sweat from the skin surface has a cooling effect due to the\nlatent heat of evaporation of water. Hence, in hot weather, or when the\nindividual's muscles heat up due to exertion, more sweat is produced. Animals\nwith few sweat glands, such as dogs, accomplish similar temperature regulation\nresults by panting, which evaporates water from the moist lining of the oral\ncavity and pharynx. Primates and horses have armpits that sweat like those of\nhumans. Although sweating is found in a wide variety of\nmammals, relatively few, such as humans and horses,\nproduce large amounts of sweat in order to cool down.\n\nA study has discovered that men, on average, start perspiring much more quickly\nthan women, then twice as much when they are in the middle of exercising at the\nsame relative intensity. When men and women exercise at the same\nabsolute intensity there are no differences in sweating responses.\n","linknr":315,"url":"Sweat","recorded":1362372080,"links":78,"instances":["biological"],"pdf":["http://www.jbc.org/cgi/reprint/99/3/781.pdf","http://www.jbc.org/cgi/reprint/99/3/781.pdf","http://mail.inonu.edu.tr/~tipdergi/include/getdoc.php?id=79&article=35&mode=pdf","http://mail.inonu.edu.tr/~tipdergi/include/getdoc.php?id=79&article=35&mode=pdf"],"categories":["Body fluids","Animal physiology","Reflexes","Excretion"],"headings":["Definition","Mechanism","Composition","See also","References","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/Boy_Face_from_Venezuela.jpg/220px-Boy_Face_from_Venezuela.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c2/Demonstration_of_Sweat.jpg/220px-Demonstration_of_Sweat.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e2/Perspiration_stain_on_white_cotton_T-shirt.jpg/220px-Perspiration_stain_on_white_cotton_T-shirt.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["stress","biological"]],"members":["stress"],"related":["Transpiration","Diaphoresis","Sweat_gland","Skin","Mammal","Sweat_gland","Eccrine_gland","Apocrine_gland","Human","Thermoregulation","Evaporation","Latent_heat","Temperature","Dog","Pharynx","Primates","Hypohidrosis","Focal_hyperhidrosis","Hyperhidrosis","Hypothalamus","Skin","Gain","Feedback","Temperature","Evaporative_cooling","Water","Solution","Cold","Climate","Hot","Acclimatisation","Sodium","Cool","Exercise","Water","Minerals","Lactic_acid","Urea","Acclimatisation","Heat","Exercise","Stress_(biological)","Sauna","Body","Sodium","Potassium","Calcium","Magnesium","Trace_elements","Zinc","Copper","Iron","Chromium","Nickel","Lead","Blood_plasma","Diaphoresis","Hyperhidrosis","Anhidrosis","Hyponatremia","Hyperthermia","Body_odor","Hidradenitis_suppurativa","Pheromone","Sweat_gland","Sweat_therapy","Eccrine_gland","Apocrine_gland","Sauna_suit"]}
