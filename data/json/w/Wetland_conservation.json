{"cursor":"14180","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Wetland conservation' is aimed at protecting and preserving areas where water\nexists at or near the Earth's surface, such as swamps, marshes and bogs.\nWetlands cover at least six per cent of the Earth and have become a focal issue\nfor conservation due to the ecosystem services they provide. More than three\nbillion people, around half the worldâs population, obtain their basic water\nneeds from inland freshwater wetlands. The same number of people rely on rice as\ntheir staple food, a crop grown largely in natural and artificial wetlands. In\nsome parts of the world, such as the Kilombero wetland in Tanzania, almost the\nentire local population relies on wetland cultivation for their livelihoods.

According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, the\ntotal catch from inland waters (rivers and wetlands) was 8.7 million metric\ntonnes in 2002.

Rome, FAO. 2003. 60p In addition to food,\nwetlands supply fibre, fuel and medicinal plants. They also provide valuable\necosystems for birds and other aquatic creatures, help reduce the damaging\nimpact of floods, control pollution and regulate the climate. From economic\nimportance, to aesthetics, the reasons for conserving wetlands have become\nnumerous over the past few decades.\n","linknr":202,"url":"Wetland_conservation","recorded":1362584201,"links":17,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/Publications/Water_Issue_Briefs/PDF/Water_Issue_Brief_1.pdf","http://water.epa.gov/type/wetlands/outreach/upload/fun_val.pdf","http://www.naturvardsverket.se/Documents/publikationer/978-91-620-5925-5.pdf","http://www.naturvardsverket.se/Documents/publikationer/978-91-620-5925-5.pdf"],"categories":["Wetland conservation|"],"headings":["Wetland definition","Wetland functions","History","Conservation by country","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/67/Water_With_Plants_and_Trees.jpg/220px-Water_With_Plants_and_Trees.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6d/Food_web.gif/350px-Food_web.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Swamps","Marshes","Bogs","Wetland","Ecosystem_services","Aesthetics","Ramsar_Convention","United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency","Wetlands_Reserve_Program","Mississippi_River","Dead_zone","Bacteria","Microbes","Invertebrates","Floodwater","United_States","Groundwater","Erosion","Biomass","Tropical_rainforests","Conterminous_United_States","North_American","Waterfowl_hunting","Bird_watching","Shellfish","Florida_Keys","Migratory_bird_act","Field_and_Game_Australia","New_Zealand","Europe","Resource_Management_Act","South_African_Department_of_Environmental_Affairs","Poverty_relief","Sweden"]}
