He succeeded in securing\npeace with America and this feat remains his legacy. He was also well known as a collector of\nantiquities and works of art I. Bignamini, C. Hornsby, Digging And Dealing\nIn Eighteenth-Century Rome (2010), p.321-322\n\nLord Shelburne was born in Dublin in 1737 and spent his formative years in\nIreland. After attending Oxford University he served in the British army during\nthe Seven Years' War taking part in the Raid on Rochefort and the Battle of\nMinden. As a reward for his conduct at the Battle of Kloster Kampen Shelburne\nwas appointed an aide-de-camp to George III. He became involved in politics,\nbecoming a Member of Parliament in 1760. After his father's death in 1761 he\ninherited his title and was elevated to the House of Lords and took an active\nrole in politics. He served as President of the Board of Trade in the Grenville\nMinistry but resigned this position after only a few months and began to\nassociate with the opposition leader William Pitt.\n\nWhen Pitt was made Prime Minister in 1766 Shelburne was appointed as Southern\nSecretary, a position which he held for two years. He departed office during the\nCorsican Crisis and joined the Opposition. Along with Pitt he was an advocate of\na conciliatory policy towards Britain's American Colonies and a long-term critic\nof the North Government's measures in America.\n\nFollowing the fall of the North government Shelburne joined its replacement led\nby Lord Rockingham. Shelburne was made Prime Minister in 1782 following\nRockingham's death with the American War still being fought. Shelburne's\ngovernment was brought down largely due to the terms of the Peace of Paris which\nbrought the conflict to an end which were considered excessively generous.\n\nHe was an early advocate of free trade. Bowood House\nweb page\n\nHe was born 'William FitzMaurice' in Dublin in Ireland, the first son of John\nFitzMaurice, who was the second surviving son of the 1st Earl of Kerry; himself\na descendant of King Edward I. William's brother was The Honourable Thomas\nFitzMaurice (MP) (1742-1793). Lord Kerry had married Anne Petty, the\ndaughter of Sir William Petty, Surveyor General of Ireland, whose elder son had\nbeen created Baron Shelburne in 1688 and (on the elder son's death) whose\nyounger son had been created Baron Shelburne in 1699 and Earl of Shelburne in\n1719. On the younger son's death the Petty estates passed to the aforementioned\nJohn FitzMaurice, who changed his branch of the family's surname to \"Petty\" in\nplace of \"FitzMaurice\", and was created Viscount FitzMaurice later in 1751 and\nEarl of Shelburne in 1753 (after which his elder son John was styled 'Viscount\nFitzMaurice').\n\nFitzMaurice spent his childhood \"in the remotest parts of the south of\nIreland,\" Childhood in the remotest parts of the south of Ireland probably\nrefers to the family estates in County Kerry. The Pettys owned the Lansdowne\nEstates in the Kenmare area in South Kerry and the Fitzmaurice estates were in\nthe Lixnaw area in North Kerry. and, according to his own account, when he\nentered Christ Church, Oxford, in 1755, he had \"both everything to learn and\neverything to unlearn\". From a tutor whom he describes as \"narrow-minded\" he\nreceived advantageous guidance in his studies, but he attributes his improvement\nin manners and in knowledge of the world chiefly to the fact that, as was his\n\"fate through life\", he fell in \"with clever but unpopular connexions\".\n\nShelburne was one of the first British statesmen to advocate free trade, his\nconversion to which he attributed to a journey he made to London in 1761, when\nhe accompanied Adam Smith. In 1795 he described this to Dugald Stewart:\n\nI owe to a journey I made with Mr Smith from Edinburgh to London,\nthe difference between light and darkness through the best part of my life. The\nnovelty of his principles, added to my youth and prejudices, made me unable to\ncomprehend them at the time, but he urged them with so much benevolence, as well\nas eloquence, that they took a certain hold, which, though it did not develope\nitself so as to arrive at full conviction for some few years after, I can fairly\nsay, has constituted, ever since, the happiness of my life, as well as any\nlittle consideration I may have enjoyed in it.
