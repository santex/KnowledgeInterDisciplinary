It is\none of nine reserves managed by the charity, and it is designated an SSSI\n(Site of Special Scientific Interest), an SPA (Special Protection Area) and a\nRamsar Site.\n\nThe name of the centre comes from the mere on the west side of the reserve which\nis ringed by 11 observation hides. On the east side of the reserve there are a\nnumber of pens providing habitats for birds from Africa, Australasia, North\nAmerica, South America, Siberia, and Asia.\n\nMartin Mere has its own \"Domesday Book\", listing (for 2002) 517 species of\nplant, 287 species of fungus and 1,368 species of invertebrate. 284 species of\nbird have passed through the reserve, as well as 28 species of mammal and 19\nspecies of fish.\n\nThis reserve is at its best in winter, attracting huge flocks of pink-footed\ngeese and wigeon, many whooper swans and occasional rarer birds such as the\nsnow goose.\n\nIt is also excellent for wintering birds of prey such as hen harrier, peregrine\nand merlin.\n\nThe BBC television programme Autumnwatch was broadcast live from Martin Mere in\n2006 and 2007.\n","linknr":151,"url":"WWT_Martin_Mere","recorded":1362572256,"links":17,"instances":["ecology","bird"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Birdwatching sites in England","Ramsar sites in England|Martin Mere","Sites of Special Scientific Interest in Lancashire|Martin Mere","Special Protection Areas in England|Martin Mere","Wildfowl & Wetlands Trust centres|Martin Mere","Geography of West Lancashire|Martin Mere","Nature reserves in Lancashire|Martin Mere","Nature centres in England"],"headings":["History","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3a/Flamingoes_at_Martin_Mere.JPG/240px-Flamingoes_at_Martin_Mere.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/Lancashire_UK_location_map.svg/240px-Lancashire_UK_location_map.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/0c/Red_pog.svg/8px-Red_pog.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ea/Lancashire_rose.svg/22px-Lancashire_rose.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["habitat","ecology"],["merlin","bird"]],"members":["habitat","merlin"],"related":["Wetland","Nature_reserve","Wildfowl_and_Wetlands_Trust","Tarlscough","Burscough","Lancashire","West_Lancashire_Coastal_Plain","Ormskirk","Southport","Merseyside","Charitable_organization","SSSI","Special_Protection_Area","Ramsar_Site","Martin_Mere","Habitat_(ecology)","Africa","Australasia","North_America","South_America","Siberia","Asia","Domesday_Book","Species","Plant","Fungus","Invertebrate","Bird","Mammal","Fish","Pink-footed_Goose","Wigeon","Whooper_swan","Bird","Snow_goose","Bird_of_prey","Hen_harrier","Peregrine_Falcon","Merlin_(bird)","Autumnwatch_with_Bill_Oddie","Peter_Gladstone","William_Ewart_Gladstone","Peter_Scott","Burscough","Martin_Mere"]}
