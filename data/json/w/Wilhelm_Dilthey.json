As a polymathic\nphilosopher, working in a modern research university, Dilthey's research\ninterests revolved around questions of scientific methodology, historical\nevidence and history's status as a science. He could be considered an\nempiricist, in contrast to the idealism prevalent in Germany at the time, but\nhis account of what constitutes the empirical and experiential differs from\nBritish empiricism and positivism in its central epistemological and ontological\nassumptions, which are drawn from German literary and philosophical traditions.\n","linknr":466,"url":"Wilhelm_Dilthey","recorded":1362480937,"links":55,"instances":["philosophy","wiesbaden"],"pdf":[],"categories":["People from Wiesbaden","19th-century philosophers","German philosophers","19th-century German people","Continental philosophers","German literary critics","German sociologists","People from the Duchy of Nassau","Social philosophers","University of Breslau faculty","University of Kiel faculty","Humboldt University of Berlin faculty","1833 births","1911 deaths","Empiricists","Hermeneutics"],"headings":["Biography","Hermeneutics","Sociology","The distinction between the natural sciences and the human sciences","Weltanschauungen","Neo-Kantians","Bibliography","Further reading","References","See also","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Dilthey1-4.jpg/220px-Dilthey1-4.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/82/Plato%2C_Confucius%2C_Avicenna.png/180px-Plato%2C_Confucius%2C_Avicenna.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/Socrates.png/10px-Socrates.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["biebrich","wiesbaden"],["naturalism","philosophy"]],"members":["naturalism","biebrich"],"related":["Western_Philosophy","Wiesbaden-Biebrich","German_Confederation","Seis_am_Schlern","Austria-Hungary","Hermeneutics","Historism","Literary_theory","Literary_criticism","Intellectual_history","Human_sciences","Hermeneutic_circle","Facticity","Immanuel_Kant","Friedrich_Schleiermacher","German_Romanticism","Johann_Gustav_Droysen","Georg_Wilhelm_Friedrich_Hegel","John_Stuart_Mill","Friedrich_Adolf_Trendelenburg","Mikhail_Bakhtin","R._G._Collingwood","Max_Scheler","Georg_Simmel","Max_Weber","Karl_Jaspers","Martin_Heidegger","Georg_Misch","José_Ortega_y_Gasset","Hans-Georg_Gadamer","Jürgen_Habermas","Eduard_Spranger","Rudolf_Steiner","Ludwig_von_Mises","Ferdinand_Fellmann","Germany","Historian","Psychologist","Sociologist","Hermeneutics","Hegel","University_of_Berlin","Empiricist","Idealism","British_empiricism","Positivism","Epistemological","Ontological","Biebrich_(Wiesbaden)","Hesse","Theology","Heidelberg","Kuno_Fischer","Friedrich_Adolf_Trendelenburg","August_Boeckh","Friedrich_Schleiermacher","Hermeneutics","German_Romanticism","Johann_Gustav_Droysen","Leopold_von_Ranke","Humanities","Cartesian_dualism","Hermeneutic_circle","Human_sciences","Friedrich_Nietzsche","Georg_Simmel","Henri_Bergson","Martin_Heidegger","Hans-Georg_Gadamer","Sociology","Auguste_Comte","Herbert_Spencer","Dialectic","Evolution","Positivism","Neo-Kantian","Georg_Simmel","University_of_Berlin","Max_Weber","Antipositivism","Antipositivism","Verstehen","Jürgen_Habermas","Positivism_dispute","Natural_sciences","Human_science","Max_Weber","Aesthetics","Lifeworld","Weltanschauung","Nature","Naturalism_(philosophy)","Epicurean","Subjective_idealism","Friedrich_Schiller","Immanuel_Kant","Objective_idealism","G._W._F._Hegel","Baruch_Spinoza","Giordano_Bruno","Karl_Jaspers","Rudolf_Steiner","Philosophy_of_Freedom","Wilhelm_Windelband","Heinrich_Rickert","Baden_School","Neo-Kantianism","Rudolf_A._Makkreel","Karl_Dilthey","Germany","Historian","Psychologist","Sociologist","Hermeneutics","Philosopher","Wiesbaden-Biebrich","Seis_am_Schlern"]}
