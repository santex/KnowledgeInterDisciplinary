{"cursor":"5013","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Wilhelm Carl Eppingen Sponneck' (16 February 1815, RingkÃ¸bing – 29\nFebruary 1888) was a Danish nobleman ([[rigsgreve]]) and Minister of Finance. In\n1863, he accompanied 17 year old Prince Vilhelm of Denmark to Greece where\nVilhelm had just been elected king. Sponneck served as advisor to the king for a\nfew years.\n\nSponneck graduated as a student of SorÃ¸ Academy in 1832 and took a law degree in\n1836. He was employed in the Danish customs service and rose to a leading\nposition in the 1840s after publishing a 600-page work about customs services.\nThe king appointed him member of the Constitutional Assembly in 1848. The same\nyear, he was appointed Finance Minister, an office he occupied in a total of\nfive cabinets. He was first a supporter of the Unitary State with Holstein but\nduring the First War of Schleswig he switched to a pro-Danish policy, and in\n1850 he enacted a temporary law removing the customs differences between Denmark\nand Schleswig, and later the same year, he enacted a similar law abolishing the\nDanish-Schleswig customs border altogether. In 1850-51, he tried to introduce\nthe income tax, a proposal rejected by Parliament. Sponneck's proposal to\nintroduce stamps was more successful and the first Danish stamps were issued in\n1851.[http://runeberg.org/dbl/16/0240.html]\n\nIn January 1851, Sponneck travelled to Berlin and conducted negotiations with\nPrussia and Austria trying to establish a peace settlement that maintained\nthe Danish/Schleswig/Holsteinish union while securing extra close ties\nbetween the two first components. This initiative ultimately failed and\nfollowing the conclusion of peace in 1851, Sponneck abandoned his pro-Danish\nsympathies and returned to defending the pre-war Unitary\nState.[http://runeberg.org/dbl/16/0238.html]. In 1853, Parliament rejected\nhis proposal to remove the customs border between Denmark/Schleswig and\nHolstein by applying the same rates everywhere. Sponneck replied by enacting\nthe law anyway citing the king's absolutist powers in the two duchies,\nconsequently issuing the law in the name of the\nking.[http://runeberg.org/dbl/16/0238.html] After this turn of events,\nParliament ultimately approved the law. He later tried to enforce the use of\nDanish coinage in Southern Schleswig and Holstein, a policy that gave him\nmany enemies.[http://runeberg.org/dbl/16/0238.html] His popularity dropped\neven lower when he in 1854 proposed a return to absolutist royal rule in\nmatters relating to Danish-Holsteinish\naffairs.[http://runeberg.org/dbl/16/0239.html] Sponneck left politics in\n1854, and was appointed leader of the customs service, a position he occupied\nuntil 1863.\n\nIn 1863, the accompanied the future king of Greece to his new country. He\nremained in Greece for a few years, acting as advisor to the king.\n\nFollowing his return to Denmark, his became involved in private enterprise. In\n1866, he became chairman of the control commission for the Zealandic railways.\nIn 1868, he became the director of the National Bank and joined the board of the\nGreat Northern Telegraph Company. Sponneck later resigned these positions and\nbecame the leader of the newly-founded KjÃ¸benhavns Handelsbank and chairman for\nthe insurance company, Danmark.\n","linknr":124,"url":"Wilhelm_Sponneck","recorded":1375070282,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Wilhelm_Sponneck&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Wilhelm_Sponneck&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Wilhelm_Carl_Eppingen_Sponneck_by_Georg_Emil_Hansen.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c3/Wilhelm_Carl_Eppingen_Sponneck_by_Georg_Emil_Hansen.jpg/200px-Wilhelm_Carl_Eppingen_Sponneck_by_Georg_Emil_Hansen.jpg","/wiki/File:Wilhelm_Carl_Eppingen_Sponneck_by_Georg_Emil_Hansen.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Ringk%C3%B8bing","/wiki/Denmark","/w/index.php?title=Rigsgreve&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Minister_of_Finance_of_Denmark","/wiki/George_I_of_Greece","/wiki/Greece","/wiki/Sor%C3%B8_Academy","/wiki/Frederick_VII_of_Denmark","/wiki/Constitution_of_Denmark","/wiki/Minister_of_Finance_of_Denmark","/wiki/Holstein","/wiki/First_War_of_Schleswig","/wiki/Schleswig","/wiki/Income_tax","/wiki/Postage_stamp","http://runeberg.org/dbl/16/0240.html","/wiki/Berlin","/wiki/Kingdom_of_Prussia","/wiki/Austrian_Empire","http://runeberg.org/dbl/16/0238.html","/wiki/Frederick_VII_of_Denmark","/wiki/Absolutism_(European_history)","http://runeberg.org/dbl/16/0238.html","http://runeberg.org/dbl/16/0238.html","http://runeberg.org/dbl/16/0239.html","/wiki/Greece","/wiki/Zealand_(Denmark)","/wiki/Danmarks_Nationalbank","/wiki/GN_Store_Nord","/w/index.php?title=Kj%C3%B8benhavns_Handelsbank&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Wilhelm_Sponneck&action=edit&section=1","http://runeberg.org/dbl/16/0236.html","http://www.gentofte.dk/Teknik_miljoe_og_bolig/Kirkegaarde/Gentofte_Kirkegaard/Gentofte_Gravmindernes_historie_liste/Gentofte_kirkegaard_S_T.aspx","/wiki/Adam_Wilhelm_Moltke","/wiki/List_of_Finance_Ministers_of_Denmark","/wiki/Carl_Christoffer_Georg_Andr%C3%A6","http://familytreemaker.genealogy.com/users/v/o/n/Gottfried-H-Von-sponneck/","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/89582606","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wilhelm_Sponneck&oldid=541354986","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Danish_Finance_Ministers","/wiki/Category:1815_births","/wiki/Category:1888_deaths","/wiki/Category:Members_of_the_Folketing","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_Danish-language_external_links","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Wilhelm+Sponneck&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Wilhelm+Sponneck","/wiki/Wilhelm_Sponneck","/wiki/Talk:Wilhelm_Sponneck","#","/wiki/Wilhelm_Sponneck","/w/index.php?title=Wilhelm_Sponneck&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Wilhelm_Sponneck&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Wilhelm_Sponneck","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Wilhelm_Sponneck","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Wilhelm_Sponneck&oldid=541354986","/w/index.php?title=Wilhelm_Sponneck&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3182726","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Wilhelm_Sponneck&id=541354986","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Wilhelm+Sponneck","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Wilhelm+Sponneck&oldid=541354986&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Wilhelm_Sponneck&printable=yes","//da.wikipedia.org/wiki/W.C.E._Sponneck","//de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Sponneck","//el.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%92%CE%AF%CE%BB%CF%87%CE%B5%CE%BC_%CE%A3%CF%80%CF%8C%CE%BD%CE%B5%CE%BA","//fr.wikipedia.org/w
