He served as the head football coach at the\nGeorgia Institute of Technology from 1920 to 1944, compiling a record of\n134–95–15. Alexander has the second most victories of any Tech\nfootball coach. Alexander's 1928 Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets have been\nrecognized as national champions by a number of selectors. Alexander was the\nfirst college football coach to place his teams in the four major post-season\nbowl games of the time: Sugar, Cotton, Orange and Rose. His teams won three of\nthe four bowls. The 1929 Rose Bowl win, which earned his team the national\nchampionship, is the most celebrated because of the wrong-way run by\nCalifornia's Roy Riegels. Alexander was also the head basketball coach at\nGeorgia Tech for four seasons from 1919 to 1924. He was inducted into the\nCollege Football Hall of Fame as a coach in 1951.\n","linknr":447,"url":"William_Alexander_(coach)","recorded":1375066859,"links":["/w/index.php?title=William_Alexander_(coach)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=William_Alexander_(coach)&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/William_Alexander_(disambiguation)","/wiki/File:William_A._Alexander.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b4/William_A._Alexander.png/220px-William_A._Alexander.png","/wiki/American_football","/wiki/Basketball","/wiki/Mud_River_(Kentucky)","/wiki/Atlanta,_Georgia","/wiki/Georgia_Institute_of_Technology","/wiki/Head_coach","/wiki/Georgia_Institute_of_Technology","/wiki/Georgia_Institute_of_Technology","/wiki/Athletic_director","/wiki/Georgia_Institute_of_Technology","http://www.cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/coaching/alltime_coach_year_by_year.php?coachid=24","/wiki/College_football_national_championships_in_NCAA_Division_I_FBS","/wiki/Southern_Intercollegiate_Athletic_Association","/wiki/Southern_Conference","/wiki/Southeastern_Conference","/wiki/AFCA_Coach_of_the_Year","/wiki/Amos_Alonzo_Stagg_Award","/wiki/Southeastern_Conference_football_individual_awards#Coach_of_the_Year","/wiki/College_Football_Hall_of_Fame","http://www.footballfoundation.org/Programs/CollegeFootballHallofFame/SearchDetail.aspx?id=30033","/wiki/American_football","/wiki/Georgia_Institute_of_Technology","/wiki/Georgia_Tech_Yellow_Jackets_football","/wiki/College_football_national_championships_in_NCAA_Division_I_FBS","/wiki/Sugar_Bowl","/wiki/Cotton_Bowl_Classic","/wiki/Orange_Bowl","/wiki/Rose_Bowl_Game","/wiki/1929_Rose_Bowl","/wiki/California_Golden_Bears_football","/wiki/Roy_Riegels","/wiki/Basketball","/wiki/College_Football_Hall_of_Fame","#Player","#Coach","#Legacy","#Head_coaching_record","#Football","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=William_Alexander_(coach)&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/John_Heisman","#cite_note-hundred-1","#cite_note-bio-2","/wiki/Civil_engineering","/wiki/Valedictorian","/wiki/Kappa_Sigma","#cite_note-3","#cite_note-ens-4","/w/index.php?title=William_Alexander_(coach)&action=edit&section=2","#cite_note-ens-4","#cite_note-hundred-1","/wiki/The_Technique","#cite_note-ens-4","/wiki/Southern_Intercollegiate_Athletic_Association","/wiki/Sugar_Bowl","/wiki/Cotton_Bowl_Classic","/wiki/Orange_Bowl","/wiki/Rose_Bowl_Game","#cite_note-hundred-1","/wiki/1929_Rose_Bowl","/wiki/California_Golden_Bears_football","/wiki/Roy_Riegels","/wiki/1928_college_football_season","#cite_note-dhwg-5","#cite_note-6","//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hiatus","/wiki/1927_college_football_season","#cite_note-dhwg-5","/wiki/Great_Depression","/wiki/1930_college_football_season","#cite_note-7","/wiki/Ramblin%27_Reck_Club","#cite_note-bio-2","#cite_note-8","#cite_note-wins-9","/w/index.php?title=William_Alexander_(coach)&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/Bobby_Dodd","#cite_note-hundred-1","#cite_note-wins-9","/wiki/Alexander_Memorial_Coliseum","/wiki/Hank_McCamish_Pavilion","#cite_note-10","/w/index.php?title=William_Alexander_(coach)&action=edit&section=4","/w/index.php?title=William_Alexander_(coach)&action=edit&section=5","/wiki/Georgia_Tech_Yellow_Jackets_football","/wiki/Southern_Intercollegiate_Athletic_Association","/wiki/1920_college_football_season","/wiki/1921_college_football_season","/wiki/Georgia_Tech_Yellow_Jackets_football","/wiki/Southern_Conference","/wiki/1922_college_football_season","/wiki/1923_college_football_season","/wiki/1924_college_football_season","/wiki/1925_college_football_season","/wiki/1926_college_football_season","/wiki/1927_college_football_season","/wiki/1928_college_football_season","/wiki/1929_Rose_Bowl","/wiki/1929_college_football_season","/wiki/1930_college_football_season","/wiki/1931_college_football_season","/wiki/1932_college_football_season","/wiki/Georgia_Tech_Yellow_Jackets_football","/wiki/Southeastern_Conference","/wiki/1933_college_football_season","/wiki/1934_college_football_season","/wiki/1935_college_football_season","/wiki/1936_college_football_season","/wiki/1937_college_football_season","/wiki/1938_college_football_season","/wiki/1939_college_football_season","/wiki/Orange_Bowl","/wiki/1940_college_football_season","/wiki/1941_college_football_season","/wiki/1942_college_
