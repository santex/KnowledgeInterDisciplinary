Woodchips may be used as a biomass solid fuel and are raw\nmaterial for producing wood pulp. They may also be used as an organic mulch in\ngardening, landscaping, restoration ecology and mushroom cultivation. According\nto the different chemical and mechanical properties of the masses, the wood logs\nare mostly peeled, and the bark chips and the woodchips processed in different\nprocesses. The process of making wood chips are called woodchipping and are done\nwith a woodchipper.\n","linknr":242,"url":"Woodchips","recorded":1362500127,"links":26,"instances":["gravity","paper"],"pdf":["http://www.biomasscenter.org/pdfs/Wood-Chip-Heating-Guide.pdf"],"categories":["Sustainable products","Soil improvers","Biomass","Wood fuel"],"headings":["Raw materials","Production","Applications","Environmental Issues","Market Products, Supply and Demand","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b1/Europe_Chippers_1.jpg/220px-Europe_Chippers_1.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["pulp","paper"],["chute","gravity"]],"members":["chute","pulp"],"related":["Wood","Biomass","Solid_fuel","Wood_pulp","Mulch","Gardening","Landscaping","Restoration_ecology","Mushroom","Woodchipper","Pulpwood","Plantations","Construction","Agriculture","Landscaping","Logging","Sawmill","Energy_crops","Woodchipper","Pulp_(paper)","Pneumatic","Conveyor_belt","Chute_(gravity)","Pulp_mill","Mulch","Water_conservation","Soil_erosion","Acorn","Habitat","Ecological_restoration","Mulch","Playground_surfacing","Electric_power","Renewable_energy","Coal_power_plant","Steam_turbine","Heat_engine","Coal","Biomass","Energy_crisis","Climate_change","Carbon_neutral","Sustainable","Wood_ash","Fertilizer","Biochar","Wood_pellets","Steam_engines","Stirling_engines","Otto_engines","Woodgas","Internal_combustion_engines","Gasification","Woodgas","Sustainable","Renewable_energy","Clear_cutting","Forest","Ecosystem","Solar_energy","Short_rotation_coppice","Bulking_agent","Industrial_composting","Biodegradeable","Biosolids","Firebreak","Wildfire","Biofuels","Barkdust","Renewable_heat","Woodchipping_in_Australia"]}
