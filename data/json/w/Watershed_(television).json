{"cursor":"33468","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In television, 'watershed' is the point in time after which programmes with\nadult content may be broadcast. In the same way that a watershed in British and\nAustralian usage refers to \"the ridge or crest line dividing two drainage\nareas\", a television watershed serves as a dividing line. It divides the day\ninto the period where family oriented programming suitable for children may be\naired and where programming aimed at or suitable for a more adult audience is\npermitted though not required. It may also mean the period of time during which\nprogrammes with adult content may be broadcast. Examples of adult content\ninclude, but are not limited to, graphic violence, horror, strong language,\nnudity, sexual intercourse, gambling, and drug use, or references to these\nthemes without necessarily portraying them. In most countries, the same set of\nrules also apply to commercial advertisements both for the content of the\ncommercial and the nature of the product or service being advertised. Watershed\nmay have alternative names in other countries; it is known as safe harbor in the\nUnited States and as adult time in Venezuela.\n\nDue to cultural differences around the world, watershed times can vary. For\ninstance, in New Zealand, the watershed time starts at 20:30, and in Italy it\nstarts at 22:30. Some countries also have multiple watershed layers, where less\ninappropriate content than others may be allowed at an earlier time but may\nstill be restricted. In addition, some countries may be more lenient towards\nsubscription or pay-per-view channels than towards free-to-air channels.\n","linknr":332,"url":"Watershed_(television)","recorded":1362486312,"links":22,"instances":["ireland","new_zealand","north_america"],"pdf":["http://www.bai.ie/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/CC_Decisions_July2012_vFinal.pdf","http://www.bai.ie/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/CC_Decisions_July2012_vFinal.pdf","http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.astra.org.au/material/codes%5CSNTCodesofPractice2007.pdf","http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.astra.org.au/material/codes%5CSNTCodesofPractice2007.pdf"],"categories":["Television terminology","Broadcast law"],"headings":["Watersheds by country","Watersheds by time","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/37/Dagger-14-plain.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f9/Double-dagger-14-plain.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/37/Dagger-14-plain.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f9/Double-dagger-14-plain.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/37/Dagger-14-plain.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f9/Double-dagger-14-plain.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f9/Double-dagger-14-plain.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["tv3","ireland"],["office_of_film_and_literature_classification","new_zealand"],["central_time_zone","north_america"],["without_a_trace","season_2#ep29"]],"members":["tv3","office_of_film_and_literature_classification","without_a_trace","central_time_zone"],"related":["Television","Broadcast_programming","Adult_content","Graphic_violence","Horror_film","Profanity","Nudity","Sexual_intercourse","Gambling","Substance_abuse","Television_advertisement","Safe_harbor","United_States","Venezuela","Academic_year","Time_in_Australia","Gold_Coast,_Queensland","Department_of_Justice,_Rating,_Titles_and_Qualification","Rede_Globo","Rede_Record","Yle","MTV3","Nelonen","SBS_Broadcasting_Group","Fox_International_Channels","Freiwillige_Selbstkontrolle_der_Filmwirtschaft","India","Republic_of_Ireland","Statute","Broadcasting_Authority_of_Ireland","RTÉ_Television","RTÉ_programme_classifications","TV3_(Ireland)","TG4","RTÉ_Radio","Sky_Network_Television","Office_of_Film_and_Literature_Classification_(New_Zealand)","Rádio_e_Televisão_de_Portugal","Sociedade_Independente_de_Comunicação","Televisão_Independente","Integrated_receiver/decoder","Ofcom","Personal_identification_number","Sky_Movies","British_Board_of_Film_Classification","Horror_Channel","Bill_Grundy","Sex_Pistols","Terrestrial_television","Cinemax","HBO","Playboy_TV","Spice_Networks","Central_Time_Zone_(North_America)","Mountain_Time_Zone","Eastern_Time_Zone","CBS","Group_sex","Family_Viewing_Hour","Hardcore_pornography"]}
