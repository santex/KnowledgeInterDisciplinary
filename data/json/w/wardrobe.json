The earliest wardrobe was a chest, and it was not\nuntil some degree of luxury was attained in regal palaces and the castles of\npowerful nobles that separate accommodation was provided for the apparel of the\ngreat. The name of wardrobe was then given to a room in which the wall-space was\nfilled with cupboards and lockers, the drawer being a comparatively modern\ninvention. From these cupboards and lockers the modern wardrobe, with its\nhanging spaces, sliding shelves and drawers, evolved slowly.\n\nThroughout the chronological changes in the form of the enclosure, it more or\nless retained its preset function as a place to retain a king’s robe. The word\nhas gained coinage over successive generations as an independent store for among\nothers, preserving precious items for a ruler like gold, well highlighted in\nKing Edward I's times. It is also a simple patio where clothes are hung from\nmetal bars or tucked inside utility racks running from up to down. The modern\nwardrobe differs in one respect from the historical one for its triple\npartitioning: there are two linear compartments on either side with shelves as\nwell as a middle space made up of hanging pegs and drawers, the latter being a\nlatter-day addition, besides a clothes’ press in the higher central space on\nlevel with a person’s chest.<ref>[http://www.wardrobestorages.org/brief-information-about-\nwardrobe/ Wardrobe Storage: All you Need to Know about Wardrobe and Wardrobe\nStorage\"]</ref>\n",
