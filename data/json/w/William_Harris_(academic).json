In a\ncompromise, John Mitchell Mason, a Presbyterian minister who was denied the\npresidency, became the university's first provost and chief operating officer.\n\nWilliam Harris was born at Springfield, Massachusetts, April 29, 1765. His\nmother was Sarah, a granddaughter of Wm. Pynchon, the founder of Springfield,\nand his father Daniel was a deacon in the Congregational Church. Harris\ngraduated from Harvard College in 1786, and he began as a minister, but soon\nretired due to health issues. He turned to the study of medicine and during that\ntime converted to the Episcopalian Church. His health recovered and he rejoined\nthe ministry.\n\nAfter rectoring in Marblehead, Massachusetts, he was made a deacon on October\ni6th, 1791, in Trinity Church, New York, and advanced to the priesthood on the\nfollowing Sunday in St. George's Chapel. On November 3 of that year he married\nMartha, the daughter of the Rev. Jonas Clark, of Lexington, Massachusetts. They\nhad seven children.\n\nMr. Harris continued to officiate both as teacher and preacher until 1801, when\nhe received a unanimous call to St. Mark's Church in-the-Bowery to fill the\nvacancy caused by the death of the Rev. Mr. Callahan. On February 2, 1802 he was\ninducted as rector. In 1811 Mr. Harris was elected president of Columbia College\nand received the degree of Doctor of Divinity from Harvard and Columbia. At the\nsame time Dr. John M. Mason, the prominent Presbyterian divine, who had been\nproposed for the presidency, was made provost, an office created for him and\ncarrying with it some of the administrative duties. This lightening of the\npresident's work enabled Dr. Harris to retain the rectorship of St. Mark's until\n1816, when the resignation of Dr. Mason gave Harris all the duties of president.\n\nHarris is remembered as a greatly revered and beloved president. Dr. Harris\ndied at Columbia College, on October 18, 1829, and was buried in a vault at\nSt. Mark's.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{{Persondata \n| NAME = Harris, William ALTERNATIVE NAMES = SHORT DESCRIPTION
