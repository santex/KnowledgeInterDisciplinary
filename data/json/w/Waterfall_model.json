Since no formal software\ndevelopment methodologies existed at the time, this hardware-oriented model was\nsimply adapted for software development. {{cite journal |last=Benington\n|first=Herbert D. |title=Production of Large Computer Programs |journal=IEEE\nAnnals of the History of Computing |date=1 October 1983 |volume=5 |issue=4\n|pages=350â361 |doi=10.1109/MAHC.1983.10102 |publisher=IEEE Educational\nActivities Department |url=http://sunset.usc.edu/csse/TECHRPTS/1983/usccse83-501/usccse83-\n501.pdf |accessdate=2011-03-21}}\n\nThe first known presentation describing use of similar phases in software\nengineering was held by Herbert D.
