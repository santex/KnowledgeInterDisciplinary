They may be close members of the family, such as\nguide or service dogs, or they may be animals trained strictly to perform a job,\nsuch as logging elephants. They may also be used for milk, a job that requires\nhuman training to encourage the animal to cooperate. Some, at the end of their\nworking lives, may also be used for meat or other products such as leather. Such\nanimals are sometimes called 'draft animals' or 'beasts of burden'. Using\nanimals for work is considered by some as animal slavery. It raises concerns for\nanimals rights.\n\nThe history of working animals may predate agriculture, with dogs used by our\nhunter-gatherer ancestors. Around the world, millions of animals work in\nrelationship with their owners. Domesticated species are often bred to be\nsuitable for different uses and conditions, especially horses and working dogs.\nWorking animals are usually raised on farms, though some are still captured from\nthe wild, such as dolphins and some Asian elephants.\n\nPeople have found uses for a wide variety of abilities found in animals and even\nin industrialized society many animals are still used for work. The strength of\nhorses, elephants and oxen is used in pulling carts and logs. The keen sense of\nsmell of dogs and, sometimes, rats are used to search for drugs and explosives\nas well helping to find game while hunting and to search for missing or trapped\npeople. Several animals including camels, donkeys, horses and dogs are used for\ntransport, either riding or to pull wagons and sleds. Other animals including\ndogs and monkeys provide assistance to blind or disabled people.\n\nOn rare occasions, wild animals may be not only tamed, but trained to perform\nwork, though often solely for novelty or entertainment purposes, as such animals\ntend to lack the traits of trustworthiness and mild temper that characterize the\ntrue domesticated working animal. Conversely, not all domesticated animals are\nworking animals. For example, while cats may perform work catching mice, it is\nan instinctive behavior, not one that can be trained by human intervention.\nOther domesticated animals, such as sheep, or rabbits, may have agricultural\nuses for meat, hides and wool, but are not suitable for work. Finally, small\ndomestic pets such as most birds (other than certain types of pigeon) or\nhamsters are generally incapable of performing work other than that of providing\nsimple companionship.\n","linknr":281,"url":"Working_animal","recorded":1362904297,"links":35,"instances":["horse_powered_boat","fungi","livestock","australia","biology","organism","dog","skin"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Livestock","Animal-powered transport"],"headings":["Types of work","Animals used for their senses or instincts","Other uses","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Bullock_team.jpg/300px-Bullock_team.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/Chatillon_treuil_carriere_Auboin_2.jpg/220px-Chatillon_treuil_carriere_Auboin_2.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/68/Lloyd_the_Llama.jpg/220px-Lloyd_the_Llama.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/99/Mule_in_Morocco.JPG/220px-Mule_in_Morocco.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/Working_cocker_spaniel.jpg/220px-Working_cocker_spaniel.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/95/Australian_Cattle_Dog_Herding.jpg/220px-Australian_Cattle_Dog_Herding.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["hide","skin"],["hybrid","biology"],["pest","organism"],["pointer","dog"],["stockman","australia"],["muster","livestock"],["truffle","fungi"],["experiment","horse_powered_boat"]],"members":["experiment","truffle","muster","stockman","hybrid","pest","pointer","hide"],"related":["Wool","Domestication","Guide_dogs","Service_dog","Milk","Animals_rights","Hunter-gatherer","Breed","Working_dog","Asian_elephant","Ox","Rat","Camel","Donkey","Monkey","Animal_training","Hide_(skin)","Wool","Carrier_pigeon","Hamster","Limestone","Quarry","Pack_animal","Animal-powered_transport","Horse_harness","Equine","Pony","Donkey","Mule","Yaks","Camels","Dromedaries","Bactrian_camel","Central_Asia","Reindeer","Zebra","Ostrich","Mythical_creature","Garuda","Hinduism","Pegasus","Greek_mythology","Breed","Selective_breeding","Llama","Andes_Mountains","Ox","Cattle","Pack_goat","Homing_pigeon","Horse_harness","Team","Sled","Plough","Oxen","Domestic_buffalo","Carabao","Philippines","Draught_horse","Mule","Mare","Foal","Hybrid_(biology)","Pony","Donkey","Sled_dog","Reindeer","Arctic","Juan_Ignacio_Molina","Joris_van_Spilbergen","Llama","Mapuche","Mocha_Island","Plough","Moose","Pest_(organism)","Hound","Pointer_(dog)","Setter","Caracal","Ferret","Falconry","Cormorant","Search_and_rescue_horse","Guide_dog","Service_dog","Miniature_horse","Stockman_(Australia)","Shepherd","Herding_dog","Mountain_dog","Muster_(livestock)","Truffle_(fungi)","Truffle_hog","Guard_dog","War_elephant","Horses_in_warfare","Police_horse","Naval_mine","Landmine","Rats","APOPO","Animal_sentinels","Animals_in_sport","Animals_on_television","Donkey_rides","Experiment_(horse_powered_boat)","Horse-drawn_boat","Horseboating_Society","Hymenoptera_training","Military_animals","Working_dog"]}
