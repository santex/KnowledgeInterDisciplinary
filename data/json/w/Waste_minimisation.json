For the same commercial output, usually the fewer materials are\nused, the less waste is produced. Waste minimisation usually requires knowledge\nof the production process, cradle-to-grave analysis (the tracking of materials\nfrom their extraction to their return to earth) and detailed knowledge of the\ncomposition of the waste.\n\nThe main sources of waste vary from country to country. In the UK, most waste\ncomes from the construction and demolition of buildings, followed by mining and\nquarrying, industry and commerce. [http://www.official-\ndocuments.gov.uk/document/cm70/7009/7009.pdf ROYAL COMMISSION ON ENVIRONMENTAL\nPOLLUTION: Urban Environment] 2007 Household waste constitutes a\nrelatively small proportion of all waste. Reasons for the creation of waste\nsometimes include requirements in the supply chain. For example, a company\nhandling a product may insist that it should be packaged using particular\npacking because it fits its packaging equipment.\n\nIn the waste hierarchy, the most effective approaches to managing waste are at\nthe top. In contrast to waste minimisation, waste management focuses on\nprocessing waste after it is created, concentrating on re-use, recycling, and\nwaste-to-energy conversion.\n","linknr":386,"url":"Waste_minimisation","recorded":1362899210,"links":28,"instances":["economics"],"pdf":["http://www.official-documents.gov.uk/document/cm70/7009/7009.pdf"],"categories":["Waste management concepts","Industrial ecology","Waste reduction|*"],"headings":["Industries","Processes","Households","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/Waste_hierarchy.svg/300px-Waste_hierarchy.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/Windmills_D1-D4_-_Thornton_Bank.jpg/100px-Windmills_D1-D4_-_Thornton_Bank.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["resource","economics"]],"members":["resource"],"related":["Resource_(economics)","Energy","UK","Waste_hierarchy","Waste_management","Re-use","Recycling","Waste-to-energy","UK","Merseyside","Manufacturing","Raw_material","Toxicity","Paper","Metal","Glass","Plastic","Durable_goods","Vacuum_cleaner","Bottle","Consumer","Bottling_plant","Composting","Eco-labelling","United_Kingdom","Pullapart","Natural_environment","Consumer","Statistical_survey","Curbside_collection","Recycling","Cleaner_production","Eco-action","European_Week_for_Waste_Reduction","Food_waste","Life_Cycle_Assessment","List_of_waste_management_acronyms","Miniwaste","Pre-waste","Recycle","Reuse","Source_reduction","Waste_hierarchy","Waste_management"]}
