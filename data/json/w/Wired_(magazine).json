Owned by CondÃ©\nNast, it is headquartered in San Francisco, California.\n\nIt now has four international editions: [[Wired UK]], [[Wired Italia]], Wired\nJapan and Wired Germany (since September 2011).\n\nIn its earliest colophons Wired credited Canadian media theorist Marshall\nMcLuhan as its \"patron saint.\" From the beginning, the strongest immediate\ninfluence on the magazine's editorial outlook came from the techno-utopian\nagenda of co-founder Stewart Brand and his long-time associate Kevin\nKelly.\n\nFrom 1998 to 2006, Wired magazine and [[Wired News]] (which publishes at\nWired.com) had separate owners. However, throughout that time, Wired News\nremained responsible for reprinting Wired magazine's content online, due to a\nbusiness agreement made when CondÃ© Nast purchased the magazine (but not the\nwebsite). In July 2006, CondÃ© Nast announced an agreement to buy Wired News for\n$25 million, reuniting the magazine with its website.\n\nWired is known for coining new terms, such as \"the Long Tail\" and\n\"crowdsourcing\". It is also well known for its annual tradition of\nhanding out Vaporware Awards which recognize \"products, videogames and other\nnerdy tidbits pitched, promised and hyped, but never delivered\".\n","linknr":614,"url":"Wired_(magazine)","recorded":1362485774,"links":50,"instances":["game_designer","futurist","publishing","editor","software","author","writer","musician","journalist","journalist","journalist","journalist","writer"],"pdf":[],"categories":["American
