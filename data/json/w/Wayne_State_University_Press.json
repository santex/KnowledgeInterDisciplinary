Wayne State University Press also publishes\nsix academic journals, including Marvels and Tales, and several trade\npublications, including\n[http://wsupress.wayne.edu/turtle/sharoffac/sharoffb.html American City: Detroit\nArchitecture, 1845-2005] by author Robert Sharoff and\n[http://wsupress.wayne.edu/turtle/rivaww/rivab.html A Woman at War: Marlene\nDietrich Remembered] edited by Marlene Dietrich's grandson, J. David Riva.\n\nThe Press is located in the Leonard N. Simons Building designed by famed\narchitect Albert Kahn and is located on the Wayne State Universityâs main\ncampus in the heart of Midtown Detroit; Cultural Center, one block south of\nWarren Ave. and two blocks south of the Detroit Institute of Arts and the\nDetroit Public Library.\n\nThe imprint of the Wayne State University Press is controlled by the University\nPress Editorial Board, a group of scholars nominated from throughout the\nuniversity and appointed by the president to serve three-year terms. The board\nmeets regularly throughout the academic year to consider proposals and\nmanuscripts presented to it by the Pressâs acquisitions department. The Press\nalso has a fundraising group, the Board of Visitors, dedicated to raising funds\nfor the Press to support the publication of specific titles.\n\nOfficially, the Press is an auxiliary unit of the university, and receives an\nannual subvention that partially covers the cost of its operation. For the most\npart, the Press relies on revenue generated through the sale of its publications\nto meet its operating expenses.\n\nThe Wayne State University Press was founded in 1941 when faculty members of\nthen Wayne University volunteered to establish a publishing entity to âassist\nthe University in the encouragement and dissemination of scholarly learning.â\nOfficially called Wayne University Press, the initial effort was for years only\na sporadic activity run by an English professor. It was not until 1954 that the\nPress developed into a full-fledged publisher destined to have a national and\ninternational role in the creation of scholarly books and journals.\n","linknr":81,"url":"Wayne_State_University_Press","recorded":1375074620,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Wayne_State_University_Press&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Wayne_State_University_Press&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/University_press","/wiki/Wayne_State_University","/wiki/Imprint","http://wsupress.wayne.edu/turtle/sharoffac/sharoffb.html","/wiki/Robert_Sharoff","http://wsupress.wayne.edu/turtle/rivaww/rivab.html","/wiki/Marlene_Dietrich","/wiki/Albert_Kahn_(architect)","/w/index.php?title=Wayne_State_University_Press&action=edit&section=1","http://wsupress.wayne.edu/index.html","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wayne_State_University_Press&oldid=563582105","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Wayne_State_University","/wiki/Category:University_presses_of_the_United_States","/wiki/Category:Publishing_companies_established_in_1941","/wiki/Category:Book_publishing_companies_based_in_Michigan","/wiki/Category:1941_establishments_in_Michigan","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Wayne+State+University+Press&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Wayne+State+University+Press","/wiki/Wayne_State_University_Press","/wiki/Talk:Wayne_State_University_Press","#","/wiki/Wayne_State_University_Press","/w/index.php?title=Wayne_State_University_Press&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Wayne_State_University_Press&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Wayne_State_University_Press","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Wayne_State_University_Press","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Wayne_State_University_Press&oldid=563582105","/w/index.php?title=Wayne_State_University_Press&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7976644","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Wayne_State_University_Press&id=563582105","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Wayne+State+University+Press","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Wayne+State+University+Press&oldid=563582105&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Wayne_State_University_Press&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7976644#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_State_University_Press","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":["architect"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Wayne
