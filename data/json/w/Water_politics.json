The first use of the term, hydropolitics, came in the book by\nJohn Waterbury, entitled 'Hydropolitics of the Nile Valley', Syracuse University\nPress, 1979 (ISBN 0-8156-2192-2).\n\nThe availability of drinking water per capita is inadequate and shrinking\nworldwide. The causes, related to both quantity and quality, are many\nand varied; they include local scarcity, limited availability and population\npressures, but also human activities of mass consumption, misuse, environmental\ndegradation and water pollution, as well as climate change. Water's essential\nnature makes it a strategic natural resource globally, and in its absence, an\nimportant element of political conflicts in many areas, historically. With\ndecreasing availability and increasing demand for water, some have predicted\nthat clean water will become the \"next oil\"; making countries like Canada,\nChile, Norway, Colombia and Peru, with this resource in abundance, the water-\nrich countries in the\nworld.

More than 2.2 million people died in 2000 from diseases related\nto the consumption of contaminated water or drought. In 2004, the UK charity\nWaterAid reported that a child dies every 15 seconds from easily preventable water-\nrelated diseases; often this means lack of sewage disposal; see toilet. The\nUnited Nations Development Programme sums up world water distribution in the\n2006 development report: \"One part of the world sustains a designer bottled\nwater market that generates no tangible health benefits, another part suffers\nacute public health risks because people have to drink water from drains or from\nlakes and rivers.\" [http://hdr.undp.org/hdr2006/report.cfm# UNDP Human\nDevelopment Report 2006] United Nations Development Programme, 2006. Fresh\nwater — now more precious than ever in our history for its extensive use\nin agriculture, high-tech manufacturing, and energy production — is\nincreasingly receiving attention as a resource requiring better management and\nsustainable use.\n\nRiparian water rights have become issues of international diplomacy, in addition\nto domestic and regional water rights and politics ( Rahaman, M.

Barnaby, W.,\n2009. Do nations go to war over water?
