{"cursor":"13019","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nIn language, a 'word' is the smallest element that may be uttered in isolation\nwith semantic or pragmatic content (with literal or practical meaning). This\ncontrasts with a morpheme, which is the smallest unit of meaning but will not\nnecessarily stand on its own. A word may consist of a single morpheme (for\nexample: oh!, rock, red, quick, run, expect), or several (rocks, redness,\nquickly, running, unexpected), whereas a morpheme may not be able to stand on\nits own as a word (in the words just mentioned, these are -s, -ness, -ly, -ing,\nun-, -ed). A complex word will typically include a root and one or more affixes\n(rock-s, red-ness, quick-ly, run-ning, un-expect-ed), or more than one root in a\ncompound (black-board, rat-race). Words can be put together to build larger\nelements of language, such as phrases (a red rock), clauses (I threw a rock),\nand sentences (He threw a rock too but he missed).\n\nThe term word may refer to a spoken word or to a written word, or sometimes to\nthe abstract concept behind either. Spoken words are made up of units of sound\ncalled phonemes, and written words of symbols called graphemes, such as the\nletters of the English alphabet.\n","linknr":375,"url":"words","recorded":1362565564,"links":115,"instances":["linguistics","linguistics","linguistics","linguistics","morphology","linguistics","punctuation","linguistics"],"pdf":["http://www.une.edu.au/lcl/nsm/pdf/Goddard_Ch1_2002.pdf","http://www.une.edu.au/lcl/nsm/pdf/Goddard_Ch1_2002.pdf","http://www.sussex.ac.uk/english/documents/essay---what-is-a-word.pdf"],"categories":["Concepts","Lexical units","Syntactic entities","Units of linguistic morphology","Words|"],"headings":["Definitions","Morphology","Philosophy","Classes","See also","Notes","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/eb/Happy_Valentines_Day.jpg/220px-Happy_Valentines_Day.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["meaning","linguistics"],["root","linguistics"],["sentence","linguistics"],["lemma","morphology"],["feature","linguistics"],["sentence","linguistics"],["space","punctuation"],["compound","linguistics"],["mora","linguistics"],["root","linguistics"]],"members":["feature","sentence","mora","compound","lemma","root","space","meaning"],"related":["Language","Semantic","Pragmatics","Meaning_(linguistics)","Morpheme","Root_(linguistics)","Affix","Compound_word","Phrase","Clause","Sentence_(linguistics)","Spoken_words","Phoneme","Grapheme","Dictionaries","Lexicon","Lemma_(morphology)","Leonard_Bloomfield","Speech","Lexeme","Semantic_primes","Minimalist_program","Theoretical_syntax","Feature_(linguistics)","Bear","Lexical_category","Grammatical_numbers","Phonology","Sentence_(linguistics)","Infix","Separable_affix","German_language","Pronunciation","Lexical_stress","Vowel_harmony","Turkish_language","Writing","Orthography","Word_separator","Space_(punctuation)","Alphabetic_script","History_of_writing","English_orthography","Compound_(linguistics)","Vietnamese_language","Latin_alphabet","CJK_characters","Chinese_characters","Mora_(linguistics)","Kana","Hangul","Korean_language","Synthetic_language","Analytic_language","Polysynthetic_language","Inuktitut","Ubykh_language","Synthetic_language","Word_stem","Morpheme","Indo-European_languages","Root_(linguistics)","Suffixes","Desinence","Zero_grade","Thematic_suffix","Neuter_gender","Philosophy_of_language","Plato","John_Locke","Wittgenstein","Grammar","Natural_language","Noun","Verb","Dionysius_Thrax","Noun","Verb","Adjective","Pronoun","Preposition","Adverb","Grammatical_conjunction","Interjection","Pāṇini","Longest_words","Utterance","Larry_Trask","University_of_Sussex"]}
