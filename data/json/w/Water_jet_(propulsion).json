However, he never applied for a patent, and since\nthe device suffered from material problems resulting in a short life-span, it\nnever became a commercial product.\n\nThe first person to achieve that was New Zealand inventor Sir William\nHamilton in 1954.\n\nPump-jets were once limited to high-speed pleasure ships (such as jet skis and\njet boats) and other small craft, but since 2000-2010 the desire for high-speed\nvessels has increased and thus the pump-jet is gaining popularity on larger\ncraft, military vessels and ferries in particular. On these larger craft, they\ncan be powered by diesel engines or gas turbines. Speeds of up to 40 knots can\nbe achieved with this configuration, even with a conventional hull. [http://www.dlharbour.ie/content/stena/hss_story.php The\nInformation page of the Stena HSS 1500]\n\nPump-jet powered ships are well known to be very maneuverable. Examples of ships\nusing pumpjets are the fast patrol boat Dvora Mk-III craft, the Hamina class\nmissile boats, all ''Virginia'' Class submarines, the Stena HSS High-speed Sea\nService ferries, and the United States Littoral Combat Ships [LCS][3].\n\nIn the Ordovician geological period, the first known cephalopods swam by a\nnatural built-in reciprocating hydrojet.\n","linknr":191,"url":"Water_jet_(propulsion)","recorded":1362482162,"links":31,"instances":["hull","mechanics","watercraft","engineer"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Marine propulsion","Jet engines"],"headings":["Workings","Advantages","Disadvantages","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/Pump_jet.PNG/220px-Pump_jet.PNG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e0/Waterjet_on_HSS_Discovery.jpg/220px-Waterjet_on_HSS_Discovery.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/Propulsor_MK50.jpg/220px-Propulsor_MK50.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/Ship%27s_Waterjet_system_%28cut_view%29_NT.PNG/250px-Ship%27s_Waterjet_system_%28cut_view%29_NT.PNG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["bill_hamilton","engineer"],["hull","watercraft"],["transmission","mechanics"],["draft","hull"]],"members":["draft","transmission","hull","bill_hamilton"],"related":["High-speed_craft","HSS_Discovery","Ocean","Water","Marine_propulsion","Ducted_propeller","Nozzle","Centrifugal_pump","New_Zealand","Inventor","Bill_Hamilton_(engineer)","Jet_Ski","Jet_Boat","Navy","Ferries","Diesel_engine","Gas_turbine","Super_Dvora_Mk_III_class_patrol_boat","Hamina_class_missile_boat","Virginia_class_submarine","High-speed_Sea_Service","Littoral_combat_ship","Ordovician","Cephalopod","Hull_(watercraft)","Pump","Centrifugal_pump","Axial_flow_pump","Transmission_(mechanics)","CoandÄƒ_effect","Draft_(hull)","Cavitation","Dynamic_pressure","Vectored_thrust","Sonar","Submarine","Royal_Navy","Trafalgar_class_submarine","Astute_class_submarine","United_States_Navy","Seawolf_class_submarine","Virginia_class_submarine","French_Navy","Triomphant_class_submarine","Russian_Navy","Borei_class_submarine","Torpedoes","Spearfish_torpedo","Mark_48_torpedo","Mark_50_torpedo","Propulsor","Personal_water_craft","Jet_ski","Jetboat","Wetbike","Kitchen_rudder","Water_rocket"]}
