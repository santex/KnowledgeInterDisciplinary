Watson was named\nafter IBM's first president, Thomas J. Watson. The machine was specifically developed to\nanswer questions on the quiz show [[Jeopardy!]]. In 2011, Watson competed on\nJeopardy against former winners Brad Rutter, and Ken Jennings. Watson received the first prize of\n$1 million.\n\nWatson had access to 200 million pages of structured and unstructured content\nconsuming four terabytes of disk storage\nincluding the full text of Wikipedia, but was\nnot connected to the Internet during the game.\nFor each clue, Watson's three most probable responses were displayed on the\ntelevision screen. Watson consistently outperformed its human opponents on the\ngame's signaling device, but had trouble responding to a few categories, notably\nthose having short clues containing only a few words.\n\nIn February 2013, IBM announced that Watson software system's first commercial\napplication would be for utilization management decisions in lung cancer\ntreatment at Memorial SloanâKettering Cancer Center in conjunction with health\ninsurance company WellPoint.\n","linknr":966,"url":"Watson_(computer)","recorded":1362675431,"links":52,"instances":["computing","computer_scientist","chess_computer","database","editor","web_designer"],"pdf":["http://clair.si.umich.edu/~radev/papers/anlp00.pdf","http://clair.si.umich.edu/~radev/papers/anlp00.pdf","http://clair.si.umich.edu/~radev/papers/sigir00.pdf","http://clair.si.umich.edu/~radev/papers/sigir00.pdf","http://www.nymc.edu/OfficesAndServices/PublicRelations/Assets/June2012_InTouch.pdf"],"categories":["IBM supercomputers","Jeopardy!
