[http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/framework/index.htm\nDirective 2008/98/EC on waste (Waste Framework Directive)]\n\nThe waste hierarchy has taken many forms over the past decade, but the basic\nconcept has remained the cornerstone of most waste minimisation strategies. The\naim of the waste hierarchy is to extract the maximum practical benefits from\nproducts and to generate the minimum amount of waste.\n\nSome waste management experts have recently incorporated an additional R: \"Re-\nthink\", with the implied meaning that the present system may have fundamental\nflaws, and that a thoroughly effective system of waste management may need an\nentirely new way of looking at waste. Source reduction involves efforts to\nreduce hazardous waste and other materials by modifying industrial production.\nSource reduction methods involve changes in manufacturing technology, raw\nmaterial inputs, and product formulation. At times, the term \"pollution\nprevention\" may refer to source reduction.\n\nAnother method of source reduction is to increase incentives for recycling. Many\ncommunities in the United States are implementing variable-rate pricing for\nwaste disposal (also known as Pay As You Throw - PAYT) which has been effective\nin reducing the size of the municipal waste stream.\n\nSource reduction is typically measured by efficiencies and cutbacks in waste.\n[[Toxics use reduction]] is a more controversial approach to source reduction\nthat targets and measures reductions in the upstream use of toxic materials.\nToxics use reduction emphasizes the more preventive aspects of source\nreduction but, due to its emphasis on toxic chemical inputs, has been opposed\nmore vigorously by chemical manufacturers. Toxics use reduction programs have\nbeen set up by legislation in some states, e.g., Massachusetts, New Jersey,\nand Oregon.\n","linknr":338,"url":"Waste_hierarchy","recorded":1362899210,"links":33,"instances":["waste"],"pdf":["http://www.york.ca/NR/rdonlyres/mqi4323me34d7jbgnh5ogov33n2xakeedrixhnq26ymp67ppmy3befa4ahr5czxesyiauu4wp4bfosukghrjcnzi3d/2009+YR+WasteMgmt++Fact+Sheet.pdf"],"categories":["Waste management","Waste management concepts","Industrial ecology","Reuse","Recycling","Waste reduction"],"headings":["How the hierarchy works","Incentives for 3R","The Rest of the Hierarchy","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/Waste_hierarchy.svg/300px-Waste_hierarchy.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/63/Make_this_bag_last.jpg/220px-Make_this_bag_last.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/Sustainable_development.svg/32px-Sustainable_development.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["reduce","waste"]],"members":["reduce"],"related":["Waste_management","Reduce_(waste)","Reuse","Recycling","Energy_recovery","European_Waste_Hierarchy","Waste_minimisation","Raw_material","PAYT","Massachusetts","New_Jersey","Oregon","Composting","Grasscycling","Thermostats","Carpool","Efficient_energy","Ecological_footprint","Waste_exchange","Hand-me-down","Garage_sale","Quilting","Flask","Laundry","Repair","Regift","Mottainai","European_waste_hierarchy","Letsrecycle.com"]}
