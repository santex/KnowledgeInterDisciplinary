The practice typically sees the day divided into \"shifts\", set\nperiods of time during which different groups of workers take up their posts.\nThe term \"shift work\" includes both long-term night shifts and work schedules in\nwhich employees change or rotate shifts.<ref></ref><ref></ref>\n\nShift work is considered a risk factor for many health problems. It has many\nnegative cognitive effects (e.g., learning and memory deficits, loss of\nattention and vigilance). In addition, rotating night shift work disrupts our\ncircadian clocks which is associated with a higher probability of developing\nobesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease.<ref name=\"pmid22211891\">\n</ref><ref name=\"pmid19255424\"> </ref>\n\nShift work can also contribute to strain of marital, family, and personal\nrelationships.<ref name=niosh2012/>\n",
