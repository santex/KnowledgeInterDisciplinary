{"cursor":"3645","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n A 'writing circle' is a group of like-minded writers needing support\nfor their work, either through writing peer critiques, workshops or classes, or\njust encouragement. There are many different types of writing circles or writing\ngroups based on location, style of writing, or format. Normally, the goal of a\nwriting circle is to improve one's own craft by listening to the works and\nsuggestions of others in the group. It also builds a sense of community, and\nallows new writers to become accustomed to sharing their work. Writing circles\ncan be helpful inside and outside of the classroom.\n","linknr":128,"url":"Writing_workshop","recorded":1362677166,"links":12,"instances":["education"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Writing","Writing circles|"],"headings":["What a Writing Circle Does","How Writing Circles Help the Writer","Online","Australia","Canada","Ireland","United Kingdom","United States"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["class","education"]],"members":["class"],"related":["Writing","Peer_critiques","Workshops","Class_(education)","Scribophile","Reviewfuse","WordSmitten","Common_Cold_Poetry_Collective","Outwrites","Creative_Writers_Workshop","Rathmines_Writer's_Workshop","Malvern_Writers'_Circle","Norwich_Writers'_Circle","Creative_Writing_Society","University_of_Surrey","Oxford_University_Poetry_Society","Mitzi_Szereto","Erotic","Clarion_Workshop","Milford_Writer's_Workshop","Turkey_City_Writer's_Workshop","Wordos","Algonkian_Writers_Conference","Rio_Hondo_Writer's_Workshop","Sycamore_Hill_Writer's_Workshop","Iowa_Writers'_Workshop","The_Write_Group"]}
