Written language is an invention in that it must be taught to children;\nchildren will pick up spoken language (oral or sign) by exposure without being\nspecifically taught.\n\nA written language exists only as a complement to a specific spoken language,\nand no natural language is purely written. However, extinct languages may be in\neffect purely written when only their writings survive.\n",
