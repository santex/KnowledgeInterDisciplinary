Coyote' (also known simply as \"The Coyote\") and 'The Road Runner'\nare a duo of cartoon characters from a series of [[Looney Tunes]] and\n[[Merrie Melodies]] cartoons. The characters (a coyote and Greater\nRoadrunner) were created by animation director Chuck Jones in 1948 for Warner\nBros., while the template for their adventures was the work of writer Michael\nMaltese. The characters star in a long-running series of theatrical cartoon\nshorts (the first 16 of which were written by Maltese) and occasional made-for-\ntelevision cartoons.\n\nIn each episode, instead of animal senses and cunning, Wile E. Coyote uses\nabsurdly complex contraptions (sometimes in the manner of Rube Goldberg) and\nelaborate plans to pursue his quarry. It was originally meant to parody chase\ncartoons like Tom and Jerry, but it became popular, much to Jones' chagrin.\n\nThe Coyote appears separately as an occasional antagonist of Bugs Bunny in five\nshorts from 1952 to 1963: [[Operation: Rabbit]], [[To Hare Is Human]],\n[[Rabbit's Feat]], [[Compressed Hare]], and [[Hare-Breadth Hurry]]. While he is\ngenerally silent in the Coyote-Road Runner shorts, he speaks with a refined\naccent in these solo outings (except for [[Hare-Breadth Hurry]]), introducing\nhimself as \"Wile E. Coyote â super genius\", voiced with an upper-class,\ncultured English accent by Mel Blanc. The Road Runner vocalizes only\nwith a signature sound, \"Beep, Beep\", recorded by Paul Julian, and an occasional\n\"popping-cork\" tongue noise. The interviews\nincluded in the DVD commentary were recorded by animation historian Michael\nBarrier for his book Hollywood Cartoons: American Animation in Its Golden\nAge.\n\nTo date, 48 cartoons have been made featuring these characters (including the\nthree CGI shorts), the majority by Chuck Jones.\n","linknr":911,"url":"Wile_E._Coyote_and_Road_Runner","recorded":1362584669,"links":49,"instances":["family_guy","looney_tunes","united_states","historian","animator","tv_channel","mythology","tv_writer","looney_tunes","writer","looney_tunes_","sound","education"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Fictional characters introduced in 1949","Fictional rivalries","Dell Comics titles","Gold Key Comics titles","Looney Tunes characters","Fictional mute characters","Fictional characters who can move at superhuman speeds","Fictional coyotes","Fictional flightless birds","Fictional birds","Fictional anthropomorphic characters","Animated duos","Wile E.
