The\nword wealth is derived from the old English weal, which is from an Indo-European\nword stem. An individual, community, region or country that possesses\nan abundance of such possessions or resources is known as wealthy.\n\nThe concept of wealth is of significance in all areas of economics, and clearly\nso for growth economics and development economics yet the meaning of wealth is\ncontext-dependent. At the most general level, economists may define wealth as\n\"anything of value\" which captures both the subjective nature of the idea and\nthe idea that it is not a fixed or static concept. Various definitions and\nconcepts of wealth have been asserted by various individuals and in different\ncontexts.
