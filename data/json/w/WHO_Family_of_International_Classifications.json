The diagnoses and procedures are usually taken from a variety of\nsources within the health care record, such as the transcription of the\nphysician's notes, laboratory results, radiologic results, and other sources.\n\nDiagnosis codes are used to track diseases and other health conditions, whether\nthey are chronic diseases such as diabetes mellitus and heart disease, to\ncontagious diseases such as norovirus, the flu, and athlete's foot. These\ndiagnosis and procedure codes are used by government health programs, private\nhealth insurance companies, workers' compensation carriers and others.\n\nMedical classification systems are used for a variety of applications in\nmedicine, public health and medical informatics, including:\n* statistical analysis of diseases and therapeutic actions\n* reimbursement; e.g., based on diagnosis-related groups\n* knowledge-based and decision support systems\n* direct surveillance of epidemic or pandemic outbreaks\n","linknr":281,"url":"WHO_Family_of_International_Classifications","recorded":1362568698,"links":10,"instances":["medicine"],"pdf":["http://www.who.int/entity/classifications/icd/en/GRNBOOK.pdf"],"categories":["Medical classification","Nursing classification"],"headings":["Classification types","WHO Family of International Classifications","Other medical classifications","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["eurocat","medicine"]],"members":["eurocat"],"related":["Medical_diagnosis","Medical_procedure","Health_care","Diagnosis_codes","Disease","Diabetes_mellitus","Heart_disease","Norovirus","Flu","Athlete's_foot","Medicine","Public_health","Medical_informatics","Diagnosis-related_group","Decision_support_system","International_Statistical_Classification_of_Diseases_and_Related_Health_Problems","Rubric","Diagnosis_codes","Procedure_codes","Pharmaceutical_codes","Topographical_codes","World_Health_Organization","Health","World_Health_Assembly","ICD","ICD-9","ICD-9-CM","ICD-10","ICD-10-CM","ICD-10-PCS","EUROCAT_(medicine)","Congenital_disorders","International_Classification_of_Functioning,_Disability_and_Health","International_Classification_of_Health_Interventions","International_Classification_of_Primary_Care","ICPC-2_PLUS","International_Classification_of_External_Causes_of_Injury","Anatomical_Therapeutic_Chemical_Classification_System","ICD","DSM-IV_Codes","International_Classification_of_Sleep_Disorders","Online_Mendelian_Inheritance_in_Man","Read_codes","SNOMED_CT","Health_care_provider","International_Classification_of_Health_Interventions","International_Classification_of_Primary_Care","Australian_Classification_of_Health_Interventions","Canadian_Classification_of_Health_Interventions","Current_Procedural_Terminology","Health_Care_Procedure_Coding_System","ICD-10_Procedure_Coding_System","OPCS-4.5","Classification_of_Pharmaco-Therapeutic_Referrals","LOINC","Medical_Dictionary_for_Regulatory_Activities","Medical_Subject_Headings","List_of_MeSH_codes","Nursing_Interventions_Classification","Nursing_Outcomes_Classification","TIME-ITEM","TNM_staging_system","Unified_Medical_Language_System","Dewey_Decimal_System","Universal_Decimal_Classification","National_Library_of_Medicine_classification","Acronyms_in_healthcare","Ambulatory_Payment_Classification","Biological_database","Classification_of_mental_disorders","Clinical_coder","German_Institute_for_Medical_Documentation_and_Information","Health_information_management","Health_informatics","HRHIS","List_of_international_common_standards","Medical_dictionary","NANDA","Nosology"]}
