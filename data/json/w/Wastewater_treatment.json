{"cursor":"17284","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n, Germany]] 'Wastewater', also written as 'waste water', is any water that has\nbeen adversely affected in quality by anthropogenic influence. Municipal\nwastewater is usually treated in a combined sewer, sanitary sewer, effluent\nsewer or septic tank.\n\nSewage is the subset of wastewater that is contaminated with feces or urine, but\nis often used to mean any wastewater. Sewage includes domestic, municipal, or\nindustrial liquid waste products disposed of, usually via a pipe or sewer\n(sanitary or combined), sometimes in a cesspool emptier.\n\nSewerage is the physical infrastructure, including pipes, pumps, screens,\nchannels etc. used to convey sewage from its origin to the point of eventual\ntreatment or disposal. It is found in all types of sewage treatment, with the\nexception of septic systems, which treat sewage on-site.\n","linknr":636,"url":"Wastewater_treatment","recorded":1362505691,"links":43,"instances":["waste"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Chemical engineering","Environmental engineering","Aquatic ecology","Sewerage","Water pollution","Technical terminology"],"headings":["Origin","Wastewater constituents","Wastewater quality indicators","Sewage disposal","Treatment","Reuse","Etymology","Legislation","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d8/Grand_Coulee_Dam_spillway.jpg/230px-Grand_Coulee_Dam_spillway.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/2012-05-28_Fotoflug_Cuxhaven_Wilhelmshaven_DSCF9867_%28crop%29.jpg/220px-2012-05-28_Fotoflug_Cuxhaven_Wilhelmshaven_DSCF9867_%28crop%29.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0a/Wastewater_effluent.JPG/300px-Wastewater_effluent.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/Drinking_water.jpg/18px-Drinking_water.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["blackwater","waste"],["blackwater","waste"]],"members":["blackwater"],"related":["Water","Human_impact_on_the_environment","Combined_sewer","Sanitary_sewer","Effluent_sewer","Septic_tank","Sewage","Feces","Urine","Waste","Pipeline_transport","Cesspool_emptier","Sewerage","Pump","Human_waste","Human_f√¶ces","Toilet_paper","Urine","Blackwater_(waste)","Toilet","Cesspit","Septic_tank","Sewage_treatment","Greywater","Sullage","Rain","Oil","Fuel","Groundwater","Pesticide","Lubricant","Paint","Rainfall","Road","Litter","Gasoline","Diesel_fuel","Rubber","Metal","Exhaust_gas","Seawater","Salt","Microbe","River","Highway","Storm_drain","Blackwater_(waste)","Industry","Biocide","Biodegradable","Abattoir","Creamery","Ice_cream","Pharmaceutical","Pesticide","PH","Acid","Alkali","Metal_plating","Toxic","Plating","Cyanide","Pesticide","Solids","Emulsion","Paper","Oil","Agriculture","Hydraulic_fracturing","Flush_toilet","Pathogens","Virus","Prion","Parasite","Bacteria","Organic_material","Feces","Hair","Food","Vomiting","Humus","Soluble","Urea","Protein","Medication","Pharmaceuticals","Inorganic","Sand","Ceramic","Ammonia","Cyanide","Hydrogen_sulfide","Thiocyanate","Thiosulfate","Protozoa","Insect","Arthropod","Fish","Sanitary_napkin","Diaper","Condom","Hypodermic_needle","Gases","Hydrogen_sulfide","Carbon_dioxide","Methane","Emulsion","Paint","Adhesive","Mayonnaise","Hair","Toxins","Pesticide","Poison","Herbicide","Pharmaceuticals","Redox","Biochemistry","Biochemical_oxygen_demand","Chemical_oxygen_demand","Pollution","Biodegradation","Sugar","Confectionery","Sanitary_sewer","Storm_drain","Manhole","Sanitary_sewer_overflow","Public_health","Drainage_basin","Pathogen","Bioaccumulation","Sewage_treatment","Septic_tank","OSSF","Activated_sludge","Adsorb","Anaerobic","Reclaimed_water","Ecological","Reed_bed","Constructed_wetland","Micro_filtration","Synthetic_membranes","Nitrate","Denitrification","Methanol","Ozone_generator","Ozone","Petroleum_refineries","Petrochemical","Paper_and_pulp_production","Drinking_water","Cooling_towers","Irrigated","Everglades","Water_pollution","Agriculture","Water_resources","Water_pollution","World_Health_Organization","International_Water_Management_Institute","International_Water_Management_Institute","Sanitary_sewer","Old_French","Latin","Directive_98/15/EC","Commission_Decision_93/481/EEC","APHA_color","ATP_test","Combined_sewer","Ecological_sanitation","Industrial_water_treatment","List_of_waste_types","List_of_waste-water_treatment_technologies","Pt/Co_scale","Rain_garden","Sanitation","The_Environmental_Institute","Waste_management","Water_management","Water_treatment"]}
