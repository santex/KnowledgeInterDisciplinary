{"cursor":"90438","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n, worn as a pendant, depicts a pentagram, or five-pointed star, used as a symbol\nof Wicca by many adherents.]]\n\n 'Wicca' () is a modern pagan, witchcraft religion. It was developed in\nEngland during the first half of the 20th century and it was introduced to the\npublic in 1952 by Gerald Gardner, a retired British civil servant. It draws upon\na diverse set of ancient pagan and 20th century hermetic motifs for its\ntheological structure and ritual practice.\n\nWicca is a diverse religion with no central authority or figure defining it. It\nis divided into various lineages and denominations, referred to as \"traditions\",\neach with its own organisational structure and level of centralisation. Due to\nits decentralized nature, there is some disagreement over what actually\nconstitutes Wicca. Some traditions, collectively referred to as British\nTraditional Wicca, strictly follow the initiatory lineage of Gardner and\nconsider the term \"Wicca\" to apply only to such lineaged traditions, while other\neclectic traditions do not.\n\nWicca is typically duotheistic, worshipping a god and goddess traditionally\nviewed as a mother goddess and horned god. These two deities are often viewed as\nfacets of a greater pantheistic godhead. However, beliefs range from \"hard\"\npolytheism to even monotheism. Wiccan celebration follows approximately eight\nseasonally based festivals known as Sabbats. An unattributed statement known as\nthe Wiccan Rede is the traditional basis of Wiccan morality. Wicca involves the\nritual practice of magic.\n","linknr":1563,"url":"Wicca","recorded":1362372190,"links":84,"instances":["mythology","classical_element","paranormal","ritual","god","contemporary","wicca","season","classical_element","witch","classical_element","matter","neopaganism","number","wiccan","grammar","scholar","paranormal","tv_series","classical_element","contemporary","poet","wiccan","wiccan","paranormal","classical_element"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Wicca|"],"headings":["Terminology","Beliefs","Practices","Traditions","History","Debates
