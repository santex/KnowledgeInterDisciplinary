The need for\na water tank is as old as civilized man, providing storage of water for drinking\nwater, irrigation agriculture, fire suppression, agricultural farming, both for\nplants and livestock, chemical manufacturing, food preparation as well as many\nother applications. Water tank parameters include the general design of the\ntank, choice of materials of construction, as well as the following.\n\n 1. Location of the water tank (indoors, outdoors, above ground or\n    underground)determines color and construction characteristics.\n\n 2. Volume of water tank will need to hold to meet design requirements.\n\n 3. Purpose for which the water will be used, human consumption or industrial\n    determines concerns for materials that do not have side effects for humans.\n\n 4. Temperature of area where water will be stored, may create concern for\n    freezing and delivery of off setting heat.\n\n 5. Delivery pressure requirements, domestic pressures range from 35-60 PSI, the\n    demand for a given gpm (gallons per minute) of delivered flow requirements.\n\n 6. How is the water to be delivered to the point of use, into and out of the\n    water tank i.e. pumps, gravity or reservoir.\n\n 7. Wind and Earthquake design considerations allow a design of water tank\n    parameters to survive seismic and high wind events.\n\n 8. Back flow prevention, are check valve mechanisms to allow single direction\n    of water flow,\n\n 9. Chemical injection systems for algae, bacteria and virus control to allow\n    long term storage of water.\n\n10. Algae in water tanks can be mitigated by removing sunlight from access to\n    the water being stored.\n\n\n, Germany]] Throughout history, wood, ceramic and stone have been used as water\ntanks. These were all naturally occurring and manmade and some tanks are still\nin service.\n\nThe Indus Valley Civilization (3000â1500 BC) made use of granaries and water\ntanks.[http://www.eapen.com/jacob/report/indus.html] Medieval castles needed\nwater tanks for the defenders to withstand a\nsiege.[http://www.smr.herefordshire.gov.uk] A wooden water tank found at the AÃ±o\nNuevo State Reserve (California) was restored to functionality after being found\ncompletely overgrown with ivy. It had been built in\n1884.[http://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=23035]\n\n]]\n\nhttp://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/34/Wikitanks08.JPG/180px-\nWikitanks08.JPG\n\n'Chemical contact tank' of FDA and NSF polyethylene construction, allows for\nretention time for chemical treatment chemicals to \"contact\" ( chemically treat\n) with product water. (black tank in foreground)\n\n is used in Rajasthan as a traditional form of rainwater harvesting]] Various\n materials are used for making a water tank: plastics (polyethylene,\n polypropylene), fiberglass, concrete, stone, steel (welded or bolted, carbon,\n or stainless), Earthen ponds function as water storage.\n\nMaterials used in the manufacture of the tanks shown in picture:\n\n'Ground water tank' is made of lined carbon steel, it may receive water from a\nwater well or from surface water allowing a large volume of water to be placed\nin inventory and used during peak demand cycles.\n\n'Elevated Water Tank' is also known as a water tower, an elevated water tower\nwill create pressure at the ground-level outlet of 1 psi per 2.31 feet of\nelevation, thus a tank elevated to 70 feet creates about 30 psi of discharge\npressure. 30 psi is sufficient for most domestic and industrial requirements.\n\n'V'ertical cylindrical dome top tank may hold from fifty gallons to several\nmillion gallons. Horizontal cylindrical tank are typically used for transport;\nthis low-profile transport storage creates a low center of gravity helping to\nmaintain equilibrium for the transport vehicle, trailer or truck.\n\n'H'ydro-pneumatic tank is typically a horizontal pressurized storage tank.\nPressurizing this reservoir of water creates a surge free delivery of stored\nwater into the distribution system.\n\nCustom configurations include rectangular, cube shaped, cone bottom and special\nshapes for specific design requirements.\n\nBy design a water tank/container should do no harm to the water. Water is\nsusceptible to a number of ambient negative influences, including bacteria,\nviruses, algae, changes in pH, and accumulation of minerals, accumulated\ngas. A correctly designed water tank works to address and mitigate these\nnegative effects.\n\nCopper Poisoning: a fasely based news article, linked copper poisoning a plastic\ntank, the article indicated that rainwater was collected and stored in a plastic\ntank and that the tank did nothing to mitigate the low Ph. The water was then\nbrought into homes with copper piping, the copper was released by the high acid\nrainwater and caused poisoning in humans. It is important to note that while the\nplastic tank is an inert container, it has no effect on the incoming water. Good\npractice would be to analyze any water source periodically and treat\naccordingly, in this case the collected acid rain should be analyzed, and ph\nadjusted before being brought into a domestic water supply system.\n\nThe release of copper due to acidic water is monitored may be accomlished with a\nvariety of technology, beginning with Ph strips and going to more sophisticated\nPh monitors, indicate Ph which when acidic or caustic, some with output\ncommunication capabilities. There is no \"linkage\" between the plastic tank and\ncopper poisoning, a solution to the problem is easy, monitor 'stored rainwater'\nwith 'swimming pool strips' cheap and available at, swimming pool supply\noutlets. If the water is too acidic, contact state/county/local health officials\nto obtain advice and precise solutions and ph limits and guidelines as to what\nshould be used to treat rainwater to be used as domestic drinking water...\n\nThis a good point to discuss comtamination of water supplies from a variety of\norigins, piping, tank materials of construction, animal and bird feces, mineral\nand gas intrusion, all and others to be considered and integrated into design.\nhttp://water.epa.gov/drink/contaminants/index.cfm\n\nCalculate Tank Volume in US Gallons Volumes of simple tank geometry may be\ncalculated as follows. Beginning with the fact that a cubic foot contains\n7.48 gallons.\n\nA rectangular shaped tank is calculated at (length) times (width) times (height)\ntimes 7.48 gallons equals volumentric content in US gallons.\n\nFor a cylinder volume is calculated at Pi (3.14) times (radius squared)\ntimes (height) equals cubic feet times 7.48 gallons equals volumetric\ncontent in US gallons.\n\nArticles and specifications for Water Tank applications and design\nconsiderations, these AWWA details are required in many states to complete a\ncertification process to insure the quality of water being consumed.\n\nAmerican Water Works Association The AWWA is a reservoir of water tank\nknowledge; the association provides specifications for a variety of water\nstorage tank applications as well as design. The AWWA's site provides scientific\nresources with which the reader will be able to develop an informed perspective\non which to make decisions regarding their water tank requirements.\n","linknr":181,"url":"Water_tank","recorded":1362372130,"links":30,"instances":["geology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Containers","Water supply infrastructure","Water conservation"],"headings":["Other uses","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/34/Wikitanks08.JPG/220px-Wikitanks08.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/WaterTank_kwt.JPG/220px-WaterTank_kwt.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/01/Water_tank_Hanover_Germany.jpg/220px-Water_tank_Hanover_Germany.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/Bastei_-_Felsenburg_Neurathen_-_Burghof_und_Zisterne.jpg/220px-Bastei_-_Felsenburg_Neurathen_-_Burghof_und_Zisterne.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/72/Watertank29Palms.JPG/220px-Watertank29Palms.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/db/Rainwater_harvesting_tank%2C_India.jpg/220px-Rainwater_harvesting_tank%2C_India.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/Drinking_water.jpg/18px-Drinking_water.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["rock","geology"],["rock","geology"]],"members":["rock"],"related":["Drinking_water","Irrigation","Fire","Agricultural","Chemical","Food_preparation","Wood","Ceramic","Rock_(geology)","Indus_Valley_Civilization","Granary","The_Middle_Ages","Castle","Año_Nuevo_State_Reserve","California","Ivy","Rajasthan","Plastics","Polyethylene","Polypropylene","Fiberglass","Concrete","Rock_(geology)","Steel","Water_tower","Bacteria","Viruses","Algae","PH","Minerals","Gas","Calculate_Tank_Volume_in_US_Gallons","American_Water_Works_Association","Architecture","Cistern","Chemical_tank","Domestic_water_system","Drinking_water","Electropump","Fire_Water_Tank","Hand_pump","Safe_Household_Water_Storage","Rainwater_tank","Water_tower","Water","Potable_water_diver","Portable_water_tank","Intermediate_bulk_container"]}
