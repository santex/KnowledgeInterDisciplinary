{"cursor":"3380","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Winslow Lewis' (1770â1850) was a sea captain, engineer, inventor and contractor\nactive in the construction of many American lighthouses during the first half of\nthe nineteenth century.\n\nA resident of Wellfleet, Massachusetts, Lewis began developing his ideas during\nthe embargo of American shipping during the Napoleonic wars. He created a new\nlighting system based on Argand lamps; in 1812 the United States Congress\npurchased his patent rights for the system. In so doing, it awarded him a\ncontract to equip all American lighthouses with the lamps; the fitting took four\nyears. In 1815 Lewis won another contract with Samuel H. Smith, Commissioner of\nRevenue, which gave him a monopoly over the provision of winter pressed\nSpermaceti oil for lighthouses throughout the eastern seaboard. Amy K.\nMarshall,\"[http://www.uscg.mil/history/weblighthouses/Amy_Marshall_Thesis.pdf\nFrequently Close to the Point of Peril: A History of Buoys and Tenders in U.S.\nCoastal Waters, 1789-1939.]\" A Master's Thesis It also allowed him to\nvisit the lighthouses yearly to ensure their smooth operation.\n\nLewis soon branched out into contracting work, winning bids to build new\nlighthouses around the country. When Stephen Pleasonton took over the\nresponsibility for these contracts in 1820 and reorganized the Lighthouse\nEstablishment, Lewis apparently continued his oil supply contract. Pleasonton began an alliance with Lewis, who was soon being\nawarded most lighthouse construction deals in the United States. While demand\nfor the towers was high and funds were short, Pleasonton took great pride in the\nfact that Lewis was able to complete the work cheaply and rapidly. in Georgia]]\n\nLewis soon had a set of standard plans drawn up to meet demand; these plotted\nout five different sizes of lighthouses, at 25, 30, 40, 50, and 65 feet high.\nMany such towers were built; most were made of brick, but a few were constructed\nof stone. But Lewis knew little about proper engineering practices, and most of\nthe lighthouses were either poorly constructed, or they were too short. Most had\nto be replaced; only a handful survive today.\n\nLittle is known of Lewis' later career. His nephew, I. W. P. Lewis, was also a\nlighthouse builder and engineer.\n","linknr":126,"url":"Winslow_Lewis","recorded":1374768064,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Winslow_Lewis&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Winslow_Lewis&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Sea_captain","/wiki/Engineer","/wiki/Inventor","/wiki/General_contractor","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/Lighthouse","/wiki/Wellfleet,_Massachusetts","/wiki/Embargo","/wiki/Napoleonic_wars","/wiki/Lewis_lamp","/wiki/Argand_lamp","/wiki/United_States_Congress","/wiki/Sperm_oil","#cite_note-FreqPeril-1","/wiki/Stephen_Pleasonton","#cite_note-FreqPeril-1","/wiki/File:Sapeloisland1820.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/Sapeloisland1820.jpg/220px-Sapeloisland1820.jpg","/wiki/File:Sapeloisland1820.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf7/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Sapelo_Island_Light","/wiki/Georgia_(US_State)","/wiki/I._W._P._Lewis","/w/index.php?title=Winslow_Lewis&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-FreqPeril_1-0","#cite_ref-FreqPeril_1-1","http://www.uscg.mil/history/weblighthouses/Amy_Marshall_Thesis.pdf","/w/index.php?title=Winslow_Lewis&action=edit&section=2","http://terrypepper.com/lights/closeups/illumination/argand/lewis-lamp.htm","http://www.unc.edu/~rowlett/lighthouse/types/oldstylebrick.html","/wiki/F._Ross_Holland,_Jr.","/w/index.php?title=America%27s_Lighthouses:_Their_Illustrated_History_Since_1716&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/29471047","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","/wiki/File:Lightbulb.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/29/Lightbulb.jpg/24px-Lightbulb.jpg","/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Winslow_Lewis&action=edit","/wiki/Template:US-engineer-stub","/wiki/Template_talk:US-engineer-stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:US-engineer-stub&action=edit","/wiki/File:Cape_hatteras_lighthouse_img_0529.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0c/Cape_hatteras_lighthouse_img_0529.jpg/25px-Cape_hatteras_lighthouse_img_0529.jpg","/wiki/Lighthouse","/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Winslow_Lewis&action=edit","/wiki/Template:Lighthouse-stub","/wiki/Template_talk:Lighthouse-stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Lighthouse-stub&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Winslow_Lewis&oldid=522042804","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1770_births","/wiki/Category:1850_deaths","/wiki/Category:Lighthouse_keepers","/wiki/Category:People_from_Wellfleet,_Massachusetts","/wiki/Category:Lighthouse_builders","/wiki/Category:American_engineers","/wiki/Category:American_engineer_stubs","/wiki/Category:Lighthouse_stubs","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Winslow+Lewis&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Winslow+Lewis","/wiki/Winslow_Lewis","/wiki/Talk:Winslow_Lewis","#","/wiki/Winslow_Lewis","/w/index.php?title=Winslow_Lewis&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Winslow_Lewis&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Winslow_Lewis","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Winslow_Lewis","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Winslow_Lewis&oldid=522042804","/w/index.php?title=Winslow_Lewis&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Winslow_Lewis&id=522042804","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Winslow+Lewis","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book
