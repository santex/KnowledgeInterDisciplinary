He\nwas a founding contributor, with Rudolf Clausius and William Thomson (1st Baron\nKelvin), to the science of thermodynamics, particularly focusing on the first of\nthe three thermodynamic laws.\n\nRankine developed a complete theory of the steam engine and indeed of all heat\nengines. His manuals of engineering science and practice were used for many\ndecades after their publication in the 1850s and 1860s. He published several\nhundred papers and notes on science and engineering topics, from 1840 onwards,\nand his interests were extremely varied, including, in his youth, botany, music\ntheory and number theory, and, in his mature years, most major branches of\nscience, mathematics and engineering. He was an enthusiastic amateur singer,\npianist and cellist who composed his own humorous songs. He was born in\nEdinburgh and died in Glasgow, a bachelor.\n","linknr":351,"url":"William_John_Macquorn_Rankine","recorded":1362480424,"links":60,"instances":["engineer","chemistry","engineer","crater","1869","physics","material","physicist"],"pdf":[],"categories":["1820
