With radio waves distances can be short, such\nas a few metres for television remote control, or as far as thousands or even\nmillions of kilometres for deep-space radio communications. It encompasses\nvarious types of fixed, mobile, and portable applications, including two-way\nradios, cellular telephones, personal digital assistants (PDAs), and wireless\nnetworking. Other examples of applications of radio wireless technology include\nGPS units, garage door openers, wireless computer mice, keyboards and headsets,\nheadphones, radio receivers, satellite television, broadcast television and\ncordless telephones.\n\nLess common methods of achieving wireless communications include the use of\nlight, sound, magnetic, or electric fields.\n","recorded":1362124165,"portal":[],"list":[],"links":"676","instances":["country_subdivision","radio","radio","disambiguation","country","computing","audio","computing","telecommunications","telecommunications","telecommunications","umts","disambiguation","radio"],"pdf":["http://www.groupmobile.com/docs/products/TCO%20Insights%20On%20Rugged%20Mobile%20Computers.pdf","http://www.itu.int/ITU-D/imt-2000/DocumentsIMT2000/What_really_3G.pdf","http://www.wireless-nets.com/resources/downloads/wireless_industry_report_2007.pdf"],"categories":["Wireless
