{"cursor":"10752","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":": For the kennel club designation of thoroughbred canines, see [[Working Group\n: (dogs)]].\n\nA 'working group' (WG) is an interdisciplinary collaboration of researchers\nworking on new research activities that would be difficult to develop under\ntraditional funding mechanisms (e.g., federal agencies). The lifespan of the WG\ncan last anywhere between a few months and several years. Such groups have the\ntendency to develop a quasi-permanent existence once the assigned task is\naccomplished; hence the need to disband (or phase out) the WG once it has\nprovided solutions to the issues for which it was initially convened. Such goals\nto be achieved may include:\n\n\n\n:* creation of an informational document;\n:* creation of a standard, or\n:* resolution of problems related to a system or network.\n:* Continuous improvement\n\nThe WG may assemble experts (and future experts) on a topic together for\nintensive work. It is not an avenue for briefing novices about the subject\nmatter. Occasionally, a group might admit a person with little experience and a\nlot of enthusiasm. However, such participants should be present as observers and\nin the minority.\n\nWorking groups are also referred to as task groups or technical advisory groups.\n","linknr":188,"url":"Working_group","recorded":1362477160,"links":24,"instances":["business","disambiguation"],"pdf":["http://mitsloan.mit.edu/vc/Ideationpaper022805.pdf"],"categories":["Research","Working groups|","Negotiation"],"headings":["Characteristics","Motivation in Working Groups","Problem solving","Mechanics","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/Rachida-Dati-European-Parliament.jpg/220px-Rachida-Dati-European-Parliament.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["action_group","disambiguation"],["facilitation","business"]],"members":["facilitation","action_group"],"related":["Interdisciplinary","Expert","Interagency_Working_Group_on_Youth_Programs","Quality_circles","Artisan","Artist","Session_player","Project_stakeholder","Abdullah_Ibrahim_Trio","Alex_von_Schlippenbach_Trio","Dave_Holland","Die_Like_A_Dog_Quartet","Gary_Bartz_Quartet","Vandermark_5","William_Parker_Quartet","Standards_organization","IETF","HTTP_WG","Dave_Raggett","International_Organization_for_Standardization","International_Conference_on_Harmonisation_of_Technical_Requirements_for_Registration_of_Pharmaceuticals_for_Human_Use","W3C","W3C_Device_Description_Working_Group","Technical_Architecture_Group","SVG_Working_Group","Bioethics_Council","Printer_Working_Group","Salary","Threat","Problem-solving","TRIZ","Herrmann_Brain_Dominance_Instrument","Brainstorming","6-3-5_Brainwriting","Six_Thinking_Hats","Think_outside_the_box","Business_war_games","SWOT_analysis","SVTI","USIT","Five_Ws","Thought_experiment","Dilemma","Coaching","Continuous_improvement","Leadership","Action_group_(disambiguation)","Facilitation_(business)","Facilitator","Herrmann_Brain_Dominance_Instrument","Adhocracy","Interdisciplinarity","Workers'_self-management","Scientific_community","Parliamentary_system","United_Nations","Sustainable_Cities_Programme"]}
