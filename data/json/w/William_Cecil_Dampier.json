For the explorer, see [[William Dampier]].\n'Sir William Cecil Dampier' FRS (born 'William Cecil\nDampier Whetham') (27 December 1867 – 11 December 1952)\nwas a British scientist, agriculturist, and science historian who developed a\nmethod of extracting lactose (milk sugar) from whey.\n\nHe was born in London, the son of Charles Langley and Mary (nÃ©e Dampier) Whetham\nand the grandson of Sir Charles Whetham, a former Mayor of London. In 1886 he\nentered Trinity College, Cambridge and in 1889 commenced his varied researches\nin the Cavendish Laboratory. In 1891 was elected a Fellow of the college.\n\nIn June 1901 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. His\ncandidacy citation read: \"Lecturer in Physics. Fellow of Trinity College,\nCambridge. Author of the following scientific papers, &c: - 'On the Alleged\nSlipping at the Boundary of a Liquid in Motion' (Proc Roy Soc, xlviii, p 225,\n1890, and Phil Trans, 1890, A p559); 'Note on Kohlrausch's Theory of Ionic\nVelocity' (Phil Mag, July, 1891); 'Ionic Velocities' (Proc Roy Soc, lii, p 283,\n1893, translated Zeits fur Physikal Chem xi, p 220, 1893, also Phil Trans 1893,\nA, p337); 'On the velocity of the Hydrogen Ion through Solutions of Acetates'\n(Brit Assoc Reports, 1894, p 568); 'On the Velocities of the Ions and the\nRelative Ionization Powers of Solvents' (Phil Mag, 1894); 'The Velocity of the\nIons' (Proc Roy Soc, lvii, p 182, 1895, and Phil Trans, A, 1895, p507); 'The\nIonizing Power of Solvents' (Phil Mag, July , 1897); 'Report to the British\nAssociation on the Present State of our Knowledge in Electrolysis and Electro-\nChemistry'; 'The Theory of the Migration of the ions and of Specific Ionic\nVelocities' (Brit Assoc Report, 1897, p 227); 'The Coagulative Power of\nElectrolytes' (Phil Mag, 1899); 'The Ionization of Dilute Solutions at the\nFreezing Point' (a paper read before the Royal Society); an elementary text book\non 'Solution and Electrolysis' (Camb Univ Press, 1895); Letters and Articles in\n'Nature' and 'Science Progress.'\" \n\nFrom 1931 to 1935 he served as the first secretary of the Agricultural Research\nCouncil.
