{"cursor":"15722","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Wire transfer' or 'credit transfer' is a method of electronic funds transfer\nfrom one person or institution (entity) to another. A wire transfer can be made\nfrom one bank account to another bank account or through a transfer of cash at a\ncash office, such as Western Union. Wire transfer systems are intended to\nprovide more individualized transactions than bulk payment systems such as ACH\nand Check21.\n\nDifferent wire transfer systems and operators provide a variety of options\nrelative to the immediacy and finality of settlement and the cost, value, and\nvolume of transactions. Central bank wire transfer systems, such as the Federal\nReserve's FedWire system in the United States are more likely to be real time\ngross settlement (RTGS) systems. RTGS systems provide the quickest availability\nof funds because they provide immediate \"real-time\" and final \"irrevocable\"\nsettlement by posting the gross (complete) entry against electronic accounts of\nthe wire transfer system operator. Other systems such as CHIPS provide net\nsettlement on a periodic basis. More immediate settlement systems tend to\nprocess higher monetary value time-critical transactions, have higher\ntransaction costs, and a smaller volume of payments. Currency transaction risk\n(because of market fluctuations) may be reduced (in part) by immediacy of\nsettlement.\n","linknr":240,"url":"Wire_transfer","recorded":1362477126,"links":26,"instances":["finance"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Payment systems"],"headings":["Process","Regulation and price","Security","Methods","Other electronic transfers","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["settlement","finance"]],"members":["settlement"],"related":["Electronic_funds_transfer","Western_Union","Automated_Clearing_House","Check21","Federal_Reserve","Fedwire","Real_time_gross_settlement","Clearing_House_Interbank_Payments_System","Net_settlement","Bank","IBAN","ISO_9362","Society_for_Worldwide_Interbank_Financial_Telecommunication","Fedwire","Settlement_(finance)","Correspondent_bank","European_Commission","Euro","European_Union","Eurozone","Iceland","Liechtenstein","Norway","Single_Euro_Payments_Area","Bank_Of_America","United_States","Chargeback","Scam","Office_of_Foreign_Assets_Control","Cheque","CMC_Markets","Natwest","Western_Union","Money-laundering","Terrorist_group","September_11,_2001_attacks","RIA","Money_gram","LCC_Money_Transfer","Foreign_exchange_spot","SWIFT","La_Hulpe","Brussels","Belgium","United_Nations","ISO_9362","Deutsche_Bank","Frankfurt","Germany","Bad_Homburg","International_Bank_Account_Number","SWIFT","Clearing_House_Interbank_Payments_System","Fedwire","Fedwire","Federal_Reserve_System","Routing_transit_number","Electronic_funds_transfer","Automated_Clearing_House","ATM_card","Bank_fraud","Electronic_bill_payment","E-commerce_payment_system","Payment_card_industry","Payment_gateway","Payments_as_a_platform","Payment_system","Payment_Services_Directive","Prepayment_for_service"]}
