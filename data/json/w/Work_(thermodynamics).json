{"cursor":"25058","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nIn thermodynamics, 'work' is a special concept of amount of energy transferred\nfrom one body or closed system to another. It is based on the ordinary physical\nconcept of mechanical work. It is most customary to calculate amount of energy\ntransferred as work through quantities external to the system of interest, and\nthus belonging to its surroundings. Nevertheless, for historical reasons, the\nmost customary sign convention is to consider work done by the system on its\nsurroundings as of positive sign. Although all real physical processes entail\nsome dissipation of kinetic energy, it is matter of principle that the\ndissipation that results from transfer of energy as work occurs only inside the\nsystem; energy dissipated outside the system, in the process of transfer of\nenergy, is not counted as thermodynamic work. Thermodynamic work necessarily and\nessentially in principle (this term 'in principle' requires careful attention)\nexcludes energy transferred between systems as heat, which is modeled distinctly\nin thermodynamics, but this feature does not provide the thermodynamic\ndefinition of work, as follows.\n\nThermodynamic work encompasses mechanical work, such as compression, and\nincluding shaft work, stirring, and rubbing, plus many other kinds of transfer\nof energy, such as electrical. In the simplest case, for example, there are work\nof change of volume against a resisting pressure, and work without change of\nvolume, known as isochoric work. An example of isochoric work is when an outside\nagency, in the surrounds of the system, drives a frictional action on the\nsurface of the system. In this case the dissipation is not necessarily actually\nconfined to the system, and the quantity of energy so transferred as work must\nbe estimated through the overall change of state of the system as measured by\nboth its mechanically and externally measurable deformation variables (such as\nits volume), and its non-deformation variable (usually internal to the system,\nfor example its empirical temperature, regarded not as a temperature but simply\nas a mechanically measurable variable). In a process of transfer of energy as\nwork, the internal energy of the final state of the system is then measured by\nthe amount of adiabatic work of change of volume that would have been necessary\nto reach it from the initial state, such adiabatic work being measurable only\nthrough the externally measurable mechanical or deformation variables of the\nsystem, but including also full information about the forces exerted by the\nsurroundings on the system during the process. In the case of some of Joule's\nmeasurements, the process was so arranged that heat produced outside the system\nby the frictional process was practically entirely transferred into the system\nduring the process, so that the quantity of work done by the surrounds on the\nsystem could be calculated as shaft work, an external mechanical\nvariable.
