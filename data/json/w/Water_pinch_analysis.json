WPA was\nfirst introduced by Wang and Smith. Wang, Y. P. and Smith, R. (1994).\nWastewater Minimisation. Chem. Eng. Sci. 49, 981â1006. Since then, it has\nbeen widely used as a tool for water conservation in industrial process plants.\nWater Pinch Analysis has recently been applied for urban/domestic\nbuildings. Manan, Z. A., Wan Alwi, S. R. and Ujang Z. (2006). Water pinch\nanalysis for urban system: a case study on the Sultan Ismail Mosque at\nUniversiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM) . Desalination. 194: 52â68. It was\nextended in 1998 by Nick Hallale at the University of Cape Town, who developed\nit as a special case of mass exchange networks for capital cost targeting.\n\nTechniques for setting targets for maximum water recovery capable of handling\nany type of water-using operation including mass-transfer-based and non-mass-\ntransfer based systems include the source and sink composite curves (Nick\nHallale (2002). A New Graphical Targeting Method for Water Minimisation.\nAdvances in Environmental Research. 6(3): 377â390) and water cascade analysis\n(WCA). Manan, Z. A., Foo, C. Y. and Tan, Y. L. (2004). Targeting the Minimum\nWater Flowrate Using Water Cascade Analysis Technique, AIChE Journal, Volume 50,\nNo. 12, 2004. The source and sink composite curves is a graphical tool for\nsetting water recovery targets as well as for design of water recovery\nnetworks. Wan Alwi, S. R. and Manan, Z. A. (2008).
