The organization officially\ncommenced on January 1, 1995 under the Marrakech Agreement, replacing the\nGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), which commenced in\n1948. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/country_profiles/2430089.stm\nTimeline: World Trade Organization] at BBC News, 15 February 2012 The\norganization deals with regulation of trade between participating countries; it\nprovides a framework for negotiating and formalizing trade agreements, and a\ndispute resolution process aimed at enforcing participants' adherence to WTO\nagreements, which are signed by representatives of member governments [http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/tif_e/understanding_e.pdf\nUnderstanding the WTO] Handbook at WTO official website. (Note that the\ndocument's printed folio numbers do not match the pdf page numbers.) and\nratified by their parliaments. Most of the issues\nthat the WTO focuses on derive from previous trade negotiations, especially from\nthe Uruguay Round (1986â1994).\n\nThe organization is attempting to complete negotiations on the Doha Development\nRound, which was launched in 2001 with an explicit focus on addressing the needs\nof developing countries. , the future of the Doha Round remains uncertain: the\nwork programme lists 21 subjects in which the original deadline of 1 January\n2005 was missed, and the round is still\nincomplete. [http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/tif_e/doha1_e.htm\nUnderstanding the WTO: The Doha Agenda] The conflict between free trade on\nindustrial goods and services but retention of protectionism on farm subsidies\nto domestic agricultural sector (requested by developed countries) and the\nsubstantiation of the international liberalization of fair trade on agricultural\nproducts (requested by developing countries) remain the major obstacles. These\npoints of contention have hindered any progress to launch new WTO negotiations\nbeyond the Doha Development Round. As a result of this impasse, there has been\nan increasing number of bilateral free trade agreements signed.
