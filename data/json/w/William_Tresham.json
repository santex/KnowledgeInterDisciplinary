{"cursor":"5054","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Sir William Tresham' JP (born 1404 and died 22 September 1450) was an English\nlawyer and Speaker of the House of Commons.\n\nBorn in Northamptonshire, the son of Thomas Tresham of Sywell, he went on to\nbecome a major landowner in the region. He was elected as a Knight of the shire\nfor the parliament of 1423, and again in 1427, 1429, 1432, 1433, 1435, 1439,\n1442, 1445, 1447 and February and November 1449, serving in twelve successive\nparliaments overall. In 1424 he was also appointed a Justice of the\nPeace for Northamptonshire; a man born of common stock relied on advancement in\nhis home county for advancement nationally. Having trained as a lawyer, Tresham\nspent intermittent periods in the service of the king, such as in 1415, when he\nreviewed the accounts of the King's officials in southern Wales.\n\nIt is assumed he concentrated on his legal career in the 1420s, where there are\nfew records of his activities, but in 1430 he was appointed as a councillor to\nHumphrey Stafford, 1st Duke of Buckingham, and continued to receive a salary\nuntil at least 1447. In 1432 he was made one of the two Attorneys-general of\nHenry Beaufort, and spent much of the 1430s on various commissions of the crown,\nincluding one to Northamptonshire in 1434 to investigate the hiding of royal\nfunds, and another in 1439 to look at the value of royal lands, again in\nNorthamptonshire. He was employed by the royal household as an apprentice-at-law\nand thus secured a tie with them; this is likely why he was elected Speaker of\nthe House of Commons for the 1439 Parliament, when there were attempts to reform\nthe King's household. In 1438 he bought Rushton Hall in Northamptonshire as a\nfamily seat.\n\nHe was again elected Speaker in 1442 and 1447 and continued his royal service,\nmainly for the Duchy of Lancaster, and worked as an Apprentice-at-law between\n1444 and 1447. He was made a feoffee of the duchy estates in 1446 and in 1448\nwas made a chancellor of those feoffees, followed by an appointment as\nChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster on 3 June 1442. He was much-liked at court,\nand as a result was appointed to politically sensitive cases, such as the 1444\ncommission to investigate charges of treason against Thomas Carver, and a 1447\ncommission directed at members of the household of Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester.\nIn 1450 he was himself indicted for treason in the aftermath of Jack Cade's\nrebellion in Kent, but before any sort of commission could take place he was\nmurdered. While travelling to meet with Richard of York with his son, Sir Thomas\nTresham, the pair were assaulted by a group of local men with whom Tresham was\nin a property dispute. William was killed, and Thomas escaped injured.\n","linknr":271,"url":"William_Tresham","recorded":1375085688,"links":["/w/index.php?title=William_Tresham&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=William_Tresham&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/William_Tresham_(priest)","/wiki/Justice_of_the_Peace","/wiki/Kingdom_of_England","/wiki/List_of_Speakers_of_the_House_of_Commons_of_England","/wiki/House_of_Commons_of_England","/wiki/Northamptonshire","/wiki/Sywell","/wiki/Knight_of_the_shire","/wiki/Parliament_of_England","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Justice_of_the_Peace","/wiki/Humphrey_Stafford,_1st_Duke_of_Buckingham","/wiki/Henry_Beaufort","/wiki/Rushton_Hall","/wiki/Duchy_of_Lancaster","/wiki/Feoffee","/wiki/Chancellor_of_the_Duchy_of_Lancaster","/w/index.php?title=Thomas_Carver&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Humphrey,_Duke_of_Gloucester","/wiki/Jack_Cade","/wiki/Kent","/wiki/Richard_Plantagenet,_3rd_Duke_of_York","/wiki/Thomas_Tresham_(speaker)","/w/index.php?title=William_Tresham&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/27713?docPos=1","/wiki/Oxford_Dictionary_of_National_Biography","/wiki/Oxford_University_Press","/wiki/Digital_object_identifier","http://dx.doi.org/10.1093%2Fref%3Aodnb%2F27713","http://www.oup.com/oxforddnb/info/freeodnb/libraries/","/wiki/Parliament_of_England","/wiki/Member_of_Parliament","/wiki/Northamptonshire_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/William_Burley","/wiki/List_of_Speakers_of_the_House_of_Commons_of_England","/wiki/William_Burley","/wiki/William_Burley","/wiki/List_of_Speakers_of_the_House_of_Commons_of_England","/wiki/John_Say","/wiki/John_Popham_(fifteenth_century)","/wiki/List_of_Speakers_of_the_House_of_Commons_of_England","/wiki/William_Oldhall","/w/index.php?title=Walter_Sherington&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Chancellor_of_the_Duchy_of_Lancaster","/wiki/John_Say","/wiki/Template:Speaker_of_the_British_House_of_Commons","/wiki/Template_talk:Speaker_of_the_British_House_of_Commons","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Speaker_of_the_British_House_of_Commons&action=edit","/wiki/Speaker_of_the_House_of_Commons_(United_Kingdom)","/wiki/House_of_Commons_of_England","/wiki/Thomas_Hungerford_(Speaker)","/wiki/Peter_de_la_Mare","/wiki/James_Pickering","/wiki/John_Guildesborough","/wiki/Richard_Waldegrave_(politician)","/wiki/James_Pickering","/wiki/John_Bussy","/wiki/John_Cheyne_(speaker)","/wiki/John_Doreward","/wiki/Arnold_Savage","/wiki/Henry_Redford","/wiki/William_Esturmy","/wiki/John_Tiptoft,_1st_Baron_Tiptoft","/wiki/Thomas_Chaucer","/wiki/William_Stourton_(speaker)","/wiki/Walter_Hungerford,_1st_Baron_Hungerford","/wiki/Thomas_Chaucer","/wiki/Richard_Redman_(Speaker)","/wiki/Walter_Beauchamp","/wiki/Roger_Flower","/wiki/Roger_Hunt_(speaker)","/wiki/Thomas_Chaucer","/wiki/Richard_Baynard","/wiki/John_Russell_(speaker)","/wiki/Thomas_Walton","/wiki/Richard_Vernon_(speaker)","/wiki/John_Tyrell","/wiki/William_Alington_(speaker)","/wiki/John_Bowes_(speaker)","/wiki/William_Burley","/wiki/John_Say","/wiki/John_Popham_(military_commander)","/wiki/William_Oldhall","/wiki/Thomas_Thorpe_(Speaker_of_the_House_of_Commons)","/wiki/Thomas_Charlton_(speaker)","/wiki/John_Wenlock,_1st_Baron_Wenlock","/wiki/Thomas_Tresham_(speaker)","/wiki/John_Green_(speaker)","/wiki/James_Strangeways","/wiki/John_Wood_(speaker)","/wiki/William_Catesby","/wiki/Thomas_Lovell","/wiki/John_Mordaunt_(speaker)","/wiki/Thomas_Fitzwilliam","/wiki/Richard_Empson","/wiki/Robert_Drury_(speaker)","/wiki/Thomas_Englefield","/wiki/Edmund_Dudley","/wiki/Robert_Sheffield","/wiki/Thomas_Nevill","/wiki/Thomas_More","/wiki/Thomas_Audley,_1st_Baron_Audley_of_Walden","/wiki/Humphrey_Wingfield","/wiki/Richard_Rich,_1st_Baron_Rich","/wiki/Nicholas_Hare","/wiki/Thomas_Moyle","/wiki/John_Baker_(English_statesman)","/wiki/James_Dyer","/wiki/John_Pollard_(speaker)","/wiki/Robert_Broke","/wiki/Clement_Higham","/wiki/William_Cordell","/wiki/Thomas_Gargrave","/wiki/Thomas_Williams_(speaker)","/wiki/Richard_Onslow_(Solicitor_General)","/wiki/Christopher_Wray","/wiki/Robert_Bell_(Speaker_of_the_House_of_Commons)","/wiki/John_Popham_(Lord_Chief_Justice)","/wiki/John_Puckering","/wiki/Thomas_Snagge","/wiki/Edward_Coke","/wiki/Christopher_Yelverton","/wiki/John_C
