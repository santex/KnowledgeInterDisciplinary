      "text" : "\n\n, showing a late 17th-century built Dutch ship of the line]]\n\nA 'warship' is a ship that is built and primarily intended for combat. As well\nas being armed, warships are designed to withstand damage and are usually faster\nand more maneuverable than merchant ships. Unlike a merchant ship, which carries\ncargo, a warship typically only carries weapons, ammunition and supplies for its\ncrew. Warships usually belong to a navy, though they have also been operated by\nindividuals or companies.\n\nIn wartime, the distinction between warships and merchant ships is often\nblurred. In war, merchant ships are often armed and used as auxiliary warships,\nsuch as the Q-ships of the First World War and the armed merchant cruisers of\nthe Second World War. Until the 17th century it was common for merchant ships\nto be pressed into naval service and not unusual for more than half a fleet to\nbe composed of merchant ships. Until the threat of piracy subsided in the 19th\ncentury, it was normal practice to arm larger merchant ships such as galleons.\nWarships have also often been used as troop carriers or supply ships, such as\nby the French Navy in the 18th century or the Japanese Navy during the Second\nWorld War.\n",
