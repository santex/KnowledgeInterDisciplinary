{"cursor":"6467","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nThe 'Western Hemisphere' . or 'western hemisphere' or 'occidental\nhemisphere'  is mainly used as a geographical term for the half of\nthe Earth that lies west of the IERS Reference Meridian (which crosses\nGreenwich, London, United Kingdom) and east of the Antimeridian, the other half\nbeing called the Eastern Hemisphere, or \"oriental hemisphere\".\n\nIn this sense, the Western Hemisphere consists of the Americas, the western\nportions of Europe and Africa, the extreme eastern tip of Russia, numerous\nterritories in Oceania, and a portion of Antarctica, while excluding some of the\nAleutian Islands to the southwest of the Alaskan mainland.\n\nThe term is often used in political rhetoric to refer to only North and South\nAmerica (or the New World) and adjacent islands; however, the Western Hemisphere\ntechnically includes all of the aforementioned territories.\n\nIn an effort to define the Western Hemisphere as the parts of the world which\nare not part of the Old World, there also exist projections which use the 20th\nmeridian west and the diametrically opposed 160th meridian east to define the\nhemisphere. .. This projection excludes the\nEuropean and African mainlands and a small portion of northeast Greenland, but\nincludes more of eastern Russia and Oceania (e.g., New Zealand).\n\nThe population of the geographical Western Hemisphere exceeds 1 billion.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Western_Hemisphere","recorded":1372152288,"links":[],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Hemispheres of the Earth"],"headings":["Countries in both hemispheres","Nations in the Western Hemisphere but not in the Americas","Sources"],"image":[],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Geography","Earth","West","IERS_Reference_Meridian","Greenwich","London","United_Kingdom","East","Antimeridian","Eastern_Hemisphere","Americas","Europe","Africa","Russia","Oceania","Antarctica","Aleutian_Islands","Alaska","Political_rhetoric","North_America","South_America","New_World","Old_World","20th_meridian_west","160th_meridian_east","Greenland","New_Zealand","IERS_Reference_Meridian","United_Kingdom","Denmark","Greenland","Norway","Jan_Mayen","Netherlands","Saba","Bonaire","St._Eustatius","France","Spain","Algeria","Mali","Burkina_Faso","Togo","Ghana","180th_meridian","Russia","United_States","List_of_islands_of_the_United_States","Kiribati","Tuvalu","Wallis_and_Futuna","Fiji","Algeria","American_Samoa","Burkina_Faso","Cape_Verde","Cook_Islands","Faroe_Islands","Fiji","France","Metropolitan_France","French_Polynesia","Wallis_and_Futuna","Gambia","Ghana","Greenland","Guinea","Guinea-Bissau","Iceland","Ireland","Ivory_Coast","Kiribati","Liberia","Mali","Mauritania","Morocco","Western_Sahara","Niue","Portugal","Samoa","Senegal","Sierra_Leone","Spain","Togo","Tokelau","Tonga","Tuvalu","United_Kingdom","Gibraltar","Guernsey","Isle_of_Man","Jersey","Pitcairn_Islands","Saint_Helena,_Ascension_and_Tristan_da_Cunha"]}
