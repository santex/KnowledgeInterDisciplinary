With radio waves distances can be short, such\nas a few metres for television or as far as thousands or even millions of\nkilometres for deep-space radio communications. It encompasses various types of\nfixed, mobile, and portable applications, including two-way radios, cellular\ntelephones, personal digital assistants (PDAs), and wireless networking. Other\nexamples of applications of radio wireless technology include GPS units, garage\ndoor openers, wireless computer mice, keyboards and headsets, headphones, radio\nreceivers, satellite television, broadcast television and cordless telephones.\n\nLess common methods of achieving wireless communications include the use of\nlight, sound, magnetic, or electric fields.\n","title":"wireless","headings":["Introduction","Wireless services","Wireless networks","Modes","Cordless","History","Electromagnetic spectrum","Applications of wireless technology","Categories of wireless implementations, devices and standards","See also","References","Further reading","External links"]},"micro-relation":["4: Radio","4: Cordless_telephone","3: Wireless_network","3: Bluetooth","2: Television","2: Mobile_phone","2: Global_Positioning_System","2: Satellite_television","2: Wireless_USB","2: Infrared","2: Remote_control","2: Infrared_Data_Association","2: Broadcasting","2: Cellular_network","2: Digital_Enhanced_Cordless_Telecommunications","2: Amateur_radio","2: Cell_site","2: IEEE_802.11","2: Wi-Fi","2: 3G","2: List_of_emerging_technologies","2: TransferJet","2: EnOcean","2: Personal_area_network","1: Telecommunication","1: Two-way_radio","1: Personal_digital_assistant","1: Garage_door_opener","1: Headphone","1: Radio_receiver","1: Broadcast_television","1: Radio_waves","1: Land_Mobile_Radio","1: Mobile_Radio","1: Two_way_radio","1: Family_Radio_Service","1: Amateur_Radio","1: Marine_radio","1: Airband","1: Radio_navigation","1: Aviator","1: Air_traffic_control","1: Cellular_telephone","1: Geostationary_orbit","1: Direct_broadcast_satellite","1: Wireless_networking","1: Microwave","1: Consumer_IR","1: Ultrasound","1: Electromagnetic_induction","1: Point-to-multipoint_communication","1: Cordless","1: Alexander_Graham_Bell","1: Charles_Sumner_Tainter","1: Photophone","1: Light_beam","1: Electromagnetic_radiation","1: Electricity","1: Laser","1: Science_fiction","1: Free-space_optical_communication","1: Military_communications","1: Fiber-optic_communication","1: David_E._Hughes","1: Thomas_Edison","1: Heinrich_Hertz","1: Electromagnetic_wave","1: James_Clerk_Maxwell","1: Michael_Faraday","1: Jagadish_Chandra_Bose","1: Nikola_Tesla","1: Transceiver","1: Ultrasonics","1: Guglielmo_Marconi","1: Karl_Ferdinand_Braun","1: Nobel_Prize_for_Physics","1: Electromagnetic_spectrum","1: Radio_spectrum","1: Federal_Communications_Commission","1: Ofcom","1: Aircraft","1: Connection_manager_software","1: Mobile_virtual_private_network","1: Virtual_network","1: Local_area_network","1: Internet","1: Ethernet","1: GSM","1: Code_division_multiple_access","1: General_Packet_Radio_Service","1: Enhanced_Data_Rates_for_GSM_Evolution","1: CDMA2000","1: Communications_satellite","1: Transport","1: Aviation","1: Sea","1: Military","1: Radio_communication_system","1: Land_Mobile_Radio_System","1: Professional_Mobile_Radio","1: Terrestrial_Trunked_Radio","1: Project_25","1: OpenSky","1: EDACS","1: Digital_Mobile_Radio","1: DPMR","1: Mobile_radio_telephone","1: 1G","1: 2G","1: 4G","1: Wireless_microphone","1: Radio-frequency_identification","1: Dedicated_short-range_communications","1: Near_Field_Communication","1: Wireless_sensor_network","1: ZigBee","1: Ultra-wideband","1: WiMedia_Alliance","1: Wireless_LAN","1: HiperLAN","1: Wireless_Metropolitan_Area_Network","1: Local_Multipoint_Distribution_Service","1: WiMAX","1: HiperMAN","1: History_of_radio","1: Timeline_of_radio","1: Digital_radio","1: Radio_resource_management","1: Wireless_energy_transfer","1: Wireless_Wide_Area_Network","1: Wireless_security","1: Wireless_access_point","1: Li-Fi","1: Comparison_of_wireless_data_standards","1: Radio_antenna","1: Terrestrial_television"]}
