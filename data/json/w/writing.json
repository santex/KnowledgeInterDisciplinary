Around\nthe 4th millennium BC, the complexity of trade and administration in Mesopotamia\noutgrew human memory, and writing became a more dependable method of recording\nand presenting transactions in a permanent form.<ref name=\"Robinson, 2003, p.\n36\">Robinson, 2003, p.&nbsp;36</ref> In both Ancient Egypt and Mesoamerica\nwriting may have evolved through calendrics and a political necessity for\nrecording historical and environmental events.\n",
