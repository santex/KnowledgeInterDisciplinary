A related species, the Northern corn rootworm,\nD. barberi Smith and Lawrence, co-inhabits in much of the range, and is fairly\nsimilar in biology; in the discussion below, many comparisons are made between\nthe two species.\n\nThere are two other subspecies of D. virgifera; one, the Mexican corn rootworm\n(Diabrotica virgifera zeae) is a significant pest in its own right, attacking\ncorn in Mexico.\n\nCorn rootworm larvae can destroy significant percentages of corn if left\nuntreated. In the United States, current estimates show that 30 million acres\n(120,000 kmÂ²) of corn (out of 80 million grown) are infested with corn\nrootworms and area is expected to grow over the next 20 years. The United States\nDepartment of Agriculture estimates that corn rootworms cause $1 billion in lost\nrevenue each year  , which includes $800 million in yield loss and\n$200 million in cost of treatment for corn growers (The Dow Chemical Company).\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Western_corn_rootworm","recorded":1372152283,"links":[],"instances":["herbicide"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Chrysomelidae","Agricultural pest insects"],"headings":["Life cycle","Feeding habits","Feeding damage","History of invasions","Management","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["roundup","herbicide"]],"members":["roundup"],"related":["Animal","Arthropod","Insect","Beetle","Chrysomelidae","Galerucinae","John_Lawrence_LeConte","Corn_rootworm","North_America","Iowa","Northern_corn_rootworm","Subspecies","Mexican_corn_rootworm","Mexico","United_States_Department_of_Agriculture","North_America","Corn_Belt","North_America","Europe","Belgrade","Serbia","Greece","Poland","Italy","Ukraine","Europe","Europe","Venice","Italy","Piedmont","Switzerland","Canton_Ticino","Italy","Pordenone","Udine","Italy","Trentino","Alsace","Belgium","United_Kingdom","Netherlands","Parisian","France","Switzerland","Belgium","Netherlands","Parisian","North_America","Europe","Serbia","Piedmont","Ile-de-France","Alsace","Ile-de-France","North_America","United_States","Insecticides","Crop_rotation","Transgenic","Hybrid_corn","Nebraska","Diapause","Crop_protection","Genuity_Smartstax","Roundup_(herbicide)","Acceleron_Seed_Treatment_System"]}
