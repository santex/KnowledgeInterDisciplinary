It is treated with\nmedication that reduces copper absorption or removes the excess copper from the\nbody, but occasionally a liver transplant is required.\n\nThe condition is due to mutations in the Wilson disease protein (ATP7B) gene. A\nsingle abnormal copy of the gene is present in 1 in 100 people, who do not\ndevelop any symptoms (they are carriers). If a child inherits the gene from both\nparents, the child may develop Wilson's disease. Symptoms usually appear between\nthe ages of 6 and 20 years, but cases in much older people have been described.\nWilson's disease occurs in 1 to 4 per 100,000 people. Wilson's\ndisease is named after Samuel Alexander Kinnier Wilson (1878â1937), the British\nneurologist who first described the condition in 1912.\n","linknr":998,"url":"Wilson's_disease","recorded":1362510828,"links":50,"instances":["test","biochemistry","fruit","anatomy","doctor"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Neurological
