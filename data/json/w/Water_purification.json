{"cursor":"50841","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Water purification' is the process of removing undesirable chemicals,\nbiological contaminants, suspended solids and gases from contaminated water. The\ngoal is to produce water fit for a specific purpose. Most water is purified for\nhuman consumption (drinking water), but water purification may also be designed\nfor a variety of other purposes, including meeting the requirements of medical,\npharmacological, chemical and industrial applications. In general the methods\nused include physical processes such as filtration, sedimentation, and\ndistillation, biological processes such as slow sand filters or biologically\nactive carbon, chemical processes such as flocculation and chlorination and the\nuse of electromagnetic radiation such as ultraviolet light.\n\nThe purification process of water may reduce the concentration of particulate\nmatter including suspended particles, parasites, bacteria, algae, viruses,\nfungi; and a range of dissolved and particulate material derived from the\nsurfaces that water may have made contact with after falling as rain.\n\nThe standards for drinking water quality are typically set by governments or by\ninternational standards. These standards will typically set minimum and maximum\nconcentrations of contaminants for the use that is to be made of the water.\n\nIt is not possible to tell whether water is of an appropriate quality by visual\nexamination. Simple procedures such as boiling or the use of a household\nactivated carbon filter are not sufficient for treating all the possible\ncontaminants that may be present in water from an unknown source. Even natural\nspring water â considered safe for all practical purposes in the 19th century â\nmust now be tested before determining what kind of treatment, if any, is needed.\nChemical and microbiological analysis, while expensive, are the only way to\nobtain the information necessary for deciding on the appropriate method of\npurification.\n\nAccording to a 2007 World Health Organization (WHO) report, 1.1 billion people\nlack access to an improved drinking water supply, 88 percent of the 4 billion\nannual cases of diarrheal disease are attributed to unsafe water and inadequate\nsanitation and hygiene, and 1.8 million people die from diarrheal diseases each\nyear. The WHO estimates that 94 percent of these diarrheal cases are preventable\nthrough modifications to the environment, including access to safe\nwater. Simple techniques for treating water at home, such as\nchlorination, filters, and solar disinfection, and storing it in safe containers\ncould save a huge number of lives each year. Reducing deaths from\nwaterborne diseases is a major public health goal in developing countries.\n\n,
