When electricity is passed through a coil,\nit generates a magnetic field. One loop of wire is usually referred to as a turn\nor a winding, and a coil consists of one or more turns. For use in an electronic\ncircuit, electrical connection terminals called taps are often connected to a\ncoil. Coils are often coated with varnish or wrapped with insulating tape to\nprovide additional insulation and secure them in place. A completed coil\nassembly with one or more set of coils and taps is often called the 'windings'.\n\nWindings are used in transformers, electric motors, inductors, solenoids\nloudspeakers, and many other applications.\n","title":"Coil","headings":["General principles","Specific types","References","Further reading","External links"]},"micro-relation":["2: Inductor","2: Electromagnet","2: Transformer","2: Vacuum","1: Wire","1: Electronic_circuit","1: Electrical_connection","1: Electrical_insulation","1: Electric_motor","1: Solenoid","1: Loudspeaker","1: Electrical_conductor","1: Enameled_wire","1: Transformerboard","1: Electrical_steel","1: Oxygen-free_copper","1: Leakage_inductance","1: Litz_wire","1: Tap_changer","1: Arc_furnace","1: Center_tap","1: Amplifier","1: Push-pull_converter","1: Amplitude_modulation","1: Shellac","1: Transformer_types#Cast_resin_tranformer","1: Capacitance","1: French_language","1: Greek_language","1: Helix","1: André-Marie_Ampère","1: Physics","1: Metal","1: Magnetic_field","1: Electric_current","1: Engineering","1: Transducer","1: Energy","1: Solenoid_valve","1: Pneumatic","1: Hydraulic","1: Relay","1: Starter_solenoid","1: Inductive_coupling","1: Coil_tap"]}
