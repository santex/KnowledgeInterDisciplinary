ISBN 0-87893-518-\n5 Most wildlife biologists are concerned with the\npreservation and improvement of habitats although reinstatement is increasingly\nbeing used. Techniques can include reforestation, pest control, nitrification\nand denitrification, irrigation, coppicing and hedge laying.\n\nGame keeping is the management or control of wildlife for the well being of game\nand may include killing other animals which share the same niche or predators to\nmaintain a high population of the more profitable species, such as pheasants\nintroduced into woodland. In his 1933 book Game Management, Aldo Leopold, one of\nthe pioneers of wildlife management as a science, defined it as \"the art of\nmaking land produce sustained annual crops of wild game for recreational use\".\n\nPest control is the control of real or perceived pests and can be for the\nbenefit of wildlife, farmers, game keepers or safety reasons. In the United\nStates, wildlife management practices are often implemented by a governmental\nagency to uphold a law, such as the Endangered Species Act of 1973. Many\nwildlife managers are employed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and by\nstate governments.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, wildlife management undertaken by several organizations\nincluding government bodies such as the Forestry Commission, Charities such as\nthe RSPB and The Wildlife Trusts and privately hired gamekeepers and\ncontractors. Legislation has also been passed to protect wildlife such as the\nWildlife and Countryside Act 1981. The UK government also give farmers subsidies\nthrough the Countryside Stewardship Scheme to improve the conservation value of\ntheir farms.\n","linknr":203,"url":"Wildlife_management","recorded":1362510303,"links":22,"instances":["soil_study","ecology","scotland_1996"],"pdf":["http://www.fs.fed.us/pnw/pubs/pnw_gtr004.pdf","http://www.fs.fed.us/pnw/pubs/pnw_gtr004.pdf","http://www.michaelsoule.com/resource_files/85/85_resource_file1.pdf"],"categories":["Wildlife","Conservation","Environmental terminology"],"headings":["History","Types of wildlife management","Opposition","Management of hunting seasons","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/59/Sow_with_piglet.jpg/32px-Sow_with_piglet.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/Aegopodium_podagraria1_ies.jpg/32px-Aegopodium_podagraria1_ies.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["disturbance","ecology"],["pedology","soil_study"],["deer_act","scotland_1996"]],"members":["pedology","disturbance","deer_act"],"related":["Wildlife","Game_keeper","Wildlife_conservation","Pest_control","Holocene_extinction_event","Carrying_capacity","Disturbance_(ecology)","Ecological_succession","Physical_geography","Pedology_(soil_study)","Hydrology","Pest_control","Nitrification","Denitrification","Irrigation","Coppicing","Hedge_laying","Ecological_niche","Forestry_Commission","RSPB","The_Wildlife_Trusts","Gamekeeper","Wildlife_and_Countryside_Act","Subsidy_farming","Countryside_Stewardship_Scheme","Aldo_Leopold","William_T._Hornaday","University_of_Wisconsin,_Madison","The_Wildlife_Society","Yellowstone_National_Park","United_States_Secretary_of_the_Interior","Stewart_Udall","Leopold_Report","National_Park_Service","Conservation_biology","Animal_welfare","Animal_rights","Animal_welfare","Cruelty_to_animals","Environmentalism","Deer_Act_1991","Deer_Act_(Scotland)_1996","Breeding_season","Poaching","Anti-hunting","Fisheries_management","Game_law","Game_Warden","Goose_egg_addling","List_of_politically_endorsed_exterminations_of_animals","Nuisance_wildlife_management","Pest_control","Range_condition_scoring","Reintroduction","Remote-controlled_animal","Threshold_host_density","Wildlife_conservation"]}
