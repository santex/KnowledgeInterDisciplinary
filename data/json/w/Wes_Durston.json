He made his first-class debut\nfor Somerset against West Indies 'A' in 2002 and made his Championship debut in\n2003. He made more appearances in 2005 and was particularly valuable in one day\ngames.

His best bowling in first-\nclass cricket is 3-23 against Sri Lanka 'A' in 2004.

He was released by Somerset in November 2009 when his\ncontract expired.\n\nIn 2010, Durston was selected as one of 21 players to form the first Unicorns\nsquad to take part in the Clydesdale Bank 40 domestic limited overs competition\nagainst the regular first-class counties. The Unicorns were made up of 15 former\ncounty cricket professionals and 6 young cricketers looking to make it in the\nprofessional game.
