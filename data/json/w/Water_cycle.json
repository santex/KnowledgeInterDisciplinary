{"cursor":"22246","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n'The water cycle', also known as the 'hydrologic cycle' or the 'H 2O\ncycle', describes the continuous movement of water on, above and below the\nsurface of the Earth. Although the balance of water on Earth remains fairly\nconstant over time, individual water molecules can come and go, in and out of\nthe atmosphere. The water moves from one reservoir to another, such as from\nriver to ocean, or from the ocean to the atmosphere, by the physical processes\nof evaporation, condensation, precipitation, infiltration, runoff, and\nsubsurface flow. In so doing, the water goes through different phases: liquid,\nsolid (ice), and gas (vapor).\n\nThe water cycle involves the exchange of heat, which leads to temperature\nchanges. For instance, when water evaporates, it takes up energy from its\nsurroundings and cools the environment. When it condenses, it releases energy\nand warms the environment. These heat exchanges influence climate. By\ntransferring water from one reservoir to another, the water cycle purifies\nwater, replenishes the land with freshwater, and transports minerals to\ndifferent parts of the globe. It is also involved in reshaping the geological\nfeatures of the Earth, through such processes as erosion and sedimentation.\nFinally, the water cycle figures significantly in the maintenance of life and\necosystems on Earth.\n\n__TOC__\n\n{{multiple image\n| align = left direction = horizontal image1 = The Water Cycle.ogv width1 = 350\n| alt1 = caption1 = As the Earth's surface water evaporates, winds move water in\n| the air from the sea to the land, increasing the amount of fresh water on\n| land. image2 = The Water Cycle Watering the Land.ogv width2 = 350 alt2 =\n| caption2 = Water vapor is converted to clouds that bring fresh water to land\n| in the form of rain or snow. image3 = The Water Cycle -
