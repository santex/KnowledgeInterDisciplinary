Wristwatches are the most common type of watch\nused today. Watches evolved in the 17th century from spring powered clocks,\nwhich appeared in the 15th century. The first watches were strictly mechanical.\nAs technology progressed, the mechanisms used to measure time have, in some\ncases, been replaced by use of quartz vibrations or electronic pulses. The first digital electronic watch was\ndeveloped in 1970. Pulsar LED\n[http://invention.smithsonian.org/centerpieces/quartz/coolwatches/pulsar.html\nSmithsonian]\n\nBefore wristwatches became popular in the 1920s, most watches were pocket\nwatches, which often had covers and were carried in a pocket and attached to a\nwatch chain or watch fob. The New Oxford American Dictionary (2nd Ed., eBook\nedition), Oxford University Press, 2008 In the early 1900s, the\nwristwatch, originally called a Wristlet, was reserved for women and considered\nmore of a passing fad than a serious timepiece. Men, who carried pocket watches,\nwere quoted as saying they would \"sooner wear a skirt as wear a wristwatch\". This changed in World War I, when soldiers on the\nbattlefield found pocket watches to be impractical and attached their watches to\ntheir wrist by a cupped leather strap. It is also believed that Girard-Perregaux\nequipped the German Imperial Navy with wristwatches in a similar fashion as\nearly as the 1880s, to be used while synchronizing naval attacks and firing\nartillery.\n\nMost inexpensive and medium-priced watches used mainly for timekeeping are\nelectronic watches with quartz movements.\nExpensive collectible watches, valued more for their workmanship and aesthetic\nappeal than for simple timekeeping, often have purely mechanical movements and\nare powered by springs, even though mechanical movements are less accurate than\nmore affordable quartz movements. In addition to the time, modern watches often\ndisplay the day, date, month and year, and electronic watches may have many\nother functions. Watches that provide additional time-related features such as\ntimers, chronographs and alarm functions are not uncommon. Some modern designs\neven go as far as using GPS technology or heart-rate\nmonitoring capabilities.\n\nThe study of timekeeping is known as horology.\n","recorded":1362124104,"portal":[],"list":[],"links":"678","instances":["unit","decoration","time","tool","silversmithing","wristwatch","chain","timekeeping","watch_manufacturer","watch","electricity","time","purity","unit","disambiguation","gemstone","unit","film","time","clockwork","headgear","lignite","jewellery","wristwatch","horology","philosophy","astronomy","device","metalworking","watch","horology","measurement","horlogerie","metalworking"],"pdf":["http://www.taschenfernseher.de/doku/doku-seikotvwatch.pdf","http://www.taschenfernseher.de/doku/doku-seikotvwatch.pdf","http://www.richardmille.com/Documents/GallerieWatch/e2DNOMSAsBbqqINQGbsk1FI7EK1dCRD/PDF/EN-TECHNICAL%20DATA%20SHEET%20RM%20056.pdf","http://www.richardmille.com/Documents/GallerieWatch/e2DNOMSAsBbqqINQGbsk1FI7EK1dCRD/PDF/EN-TECHNICAL%20DATA%20SHEET%20RM%20056.pdf","http://www.sil.si.edu/digitalcollections/HistoryCultureCollections/SIL-029-015/pdf/SIL-029-015.pdf"],"categories":["Clocks","Horology","Time","Watches|","Fashion
