On the surface of the Earth,\nwind consists of the bulk movement of air. In outer space, solar wind is the\nmovement of gases or charged particles from the sun through space, while\nplanetary wind is the outgassing of light chemical elements from a planet's\natmosphere into space. Winds are commonly classified by their spatial scale,\ntheir speed, the types of forces that cause them, the regions in which they\noccur, and their effect. The strongest observed winds on a planet in our solar\nsystem occur on Neptune and Saturn.\n\nIn meteorology, winds are often referred to according to their strength, and\nthe direction from which the wind is blowing. Short bursts of high speed wind\nare termed gusts. Strong winds of intermediate duration (around one minute) are\ntermed squalls. Long-duration winds have various names associated with their\naverage strength, such as , gale, storm, hurricane, and typhoon. Wind occurs on\na range of scales, from thunderstorm flows lasting tens of minutes, to local\nbreezes generated by heating of land surfaces and lasting a few hours, to\nglobal winds resulting from the difference in absorption of solar energy\nbetween the climate zones on Earth. The two main causes of large-scale\natmospheric circulation are the differential heating between the equator and\nthe poles, and the rotation of the planet (Coriolis effect). Within the\ntropics, thermal low circulations over terrain and high plateaus can drive\nmonsoon circulations. In coastal areas the sea breeze/land breeze cycle can\ndefine local winds; in areas that have variable terrain, mountain and valley\nbreezes can dominate local winds.\n\nIn human civilization, wind has inspired mythology, influenced the events of\nhistory, expanded the range of transport and warfare, and provided a power\nsource for mechanical work, electricity and recreation. Wind powers the voyages\nof sailing ships across Earth's oceans. Hot air balloons use the wind to take\nshort trips, and powered flight uses it to increase lift and reduce fuel\nconsumption. Areas of wind shear caused by various weather phenomena can lead to\ndangerous situations for aircraft. When winds become strong, trees and man-made\nstructures are damaged or destroyed.\n\nWinds can shape landforms, via a variety of aeolian processes such as the\nformation of fertile soils, such as loess, and by erosion. Dust from large\ndeserts can be moved great distances from its source region by the prevailing\nwinds; winds that are accelerated by rough topography and associated with dust\noutbreaks have been assigned regional names in various parts of the world\nbecause of their significant effects on those regions. Wind affects the spread\nof wildfires. Winds disperse seeds from various plants, enabling the survival\nand dispersal of those plant species, as well as flying insect populations. When\ncombined with cold temperatures, wind has a negative impact on livestock. Wind\naffects animals' food stores, as well as their hunting and defensive strategies.\n","title":"wind","headings":["Cause","Measurement","Wind force scale","Wind power","Global climatology","Local
