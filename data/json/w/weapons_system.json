Weapons are used to increase\nthe efficacy and efficiency of activities such as hunting, crime, law\nenforcement, self-defense, and warfare. In a broader context, weapons may be\nconstrued to include anything used to gain a strategic, material or mental\nadvantage over an adversary.\n\nWhile ordinary objects such as sticks, stones, cars, or pencils can be used as\nweapons, many are expressly designed for the purpose – ranging from simple\nimplements such as clubs to swords and guns and on to complicated modern\nintercontinental ballistic missiles, biological and cyberweapons.\n",
