{"cursor":"21940","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nA 'water jet cutter', also known as a 'water jet' or 'waterjet', is an\nindustrial tool capable of cutting a wide variety of materials using a very high-\npressure jet of water, or a mixture of water and an abrasive substance. The term\n'abrasivejet' refers specifically to the use of a mixture of water and abrasive\nto cut hard materials such as metal or granite, while the terms 'pure waterjet'\nand 'water-only cutting' refer to waterjet cutting without the use of added\nabrasives, often used for softer materials such as food or rubber.\n\nWaterjet cutting is often used during fabrication of machine parts. It is the\npreferred method when the materials being cut are sensitive to the high\ntemperatures generated by other methods. Waterjet cutting is used in various\nindustries including mining and aerospace for cutting, shaping, and reaming.\n","linknr":806,"url":"Water_jet_cutter","recorded":1362372154,"links":46,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.kennametal.com/images/pdf/products_services/advanced_materials/roctecbrochure8-30-06.pdf","http://www.kennametal.com/images/pdf/products_services/advanced_materials/roctecbrochure8-30-06.pdf"],"categories":["Cutting machines","Metalworking cutting tools","Woodworking machines"],"headings":["History","Operation","Benefits","Versatility","Availability","Process","Edge quality","Multi-axis cutting","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5d/Water_jet_cutter_head.svg/170px-Water_jet_cutter_head.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2b/Evolution_of_the_Abrasive_Waterjet_Nozzle.jpg/220px-Evolution_of_the_Abrasive_Waterjet_Nozzle.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Water_jet_cutter_tool.jpg/220px-Water_jet_cutter_tool.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c1/Waterjet-Cut-Quality.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/5-Axis-Waterjet-Cutting-Head.jpg/220px-5-Axis-Waterjet-Cutting-Head.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ea/5-Axis-Waterjet-Part.jpg/220px-5-Axis-Waterjet-Part.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Water","Abrasive","Granite","Mining","Aerospace","Reamer","Hydraulic_mining","Corundum","Marlex","John_Paul_Hogan","Tungsten_carbide","CNC","G-code","High-pressure","Garnet","Aluminium_oxide","Meatcutting","Cross_contamination","Slaughterhouse","Composite_armour","Pound-force_per_square_inch","Boride","CryoJet"]}
