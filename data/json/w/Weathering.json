{"cursor":"21836","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Weathering' is the breaking down of rocks, soils and minerals as well as\nartificial materials through contact with the Earth's atmosphere, biota and\nwaters. Weathering occurs [[in situ]], or \"with no movement\", and thus should\nnot be confused with erosion, which involves the movement of rocks and minerals\nby agents such as water, ice, snow, wind, waves and gravity.\n\nTwo important classifications of weathering processes exist â physical and\nchemical weathering; each sometimes involves a biological component. Mechanical\nor physical weathering involves the breakdown of rocks and soils through direct\ncontact with atmospheric conditions, such as heat, water, ice and pressure. The\nsecond classification, chemical weathering, involves the direct effect of\natmospheric chemicals or biologically produced chemicals (also known as\nbiological weathering) in the breakdown of rocks, soils and\nminerals. http://facstaff.gpc.edu/~pgore/geology/geo101/weather.htm\n\nThe materials left over after the rock breaks down combined with organic\nmaterial creates soil. The mineral content of the soil is determined by the\nparent material, thus a soil derived from a single rock type can often be\ndeficient in one or more minerals for good fertility, while a soil weathered\nfrom a mix of rock types (as in glacial, aeolian or alluvial sediments) often\nmakes more fertile soil. In addition many of Earth's landforms and landscapes\nare the result of weathering processes combined with erosion and re-deposition.\n","linknr":456,"url":"Weathering","recorded":1362371936,"links":77,"instances":["physics","rock_formation","ecology","geology","geology","geology","geology","geology"],"pdf":["http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA247424&Location=U2&doc=GetTRDoc.pdf","http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA247424&Location=U2&doc=GetTRDoc.pdf"],"categories":["Weathering|","Soil"],"headings":["Physical
