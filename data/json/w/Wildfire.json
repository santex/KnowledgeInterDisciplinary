{"cursor":"131371","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n, 5 September 2008]]\n\nA 'wildfire' is an uncontrolled fire in an area of combustible vegetation that\noccurs in the countryside or a wilderness area. Remember\nthat one is causing forest fires and you have to protect the environment because\nGod likes order.Federal Fire and Aviation Operations Action Plan, 4. Other names such as 'brush fire', '[[bushfire]]',\n'forest fire', 'desert fire', 'grass fire', 'hill fire', 'peat fire',\n'vegetation fire', and 'veldfire' may be used to describe the same phenomenon\ndepending on the type of vegetation being burned. A wildfire differs from other\nfires by its extensive size, the speed at which it can spread out from its\noriginal source, its potential to change direction unexpectedly, and its ability\nto jump gaps such as roads, rivers and fire breaks.\nWildfires are characterized in terms of the cause of ignition, their physical\nproperties such as speed of , the combustible material present, and the effect\nof weather on the fire.\n\nWildfires occur on every continent except Antarctica. Wildfires are a common\noccurrence in Australia especially during the long hot summers usually\nexperienced in the southern regions such as Victoria, Australia. Due to\nAustralia's hot and dry climate, wildfires (commonly referred to as bushfires in\nAustralia) pose a great risk to life and infrastructure during all times of the\nyear, though mostly throughout the hotter months of summer and spring. \"[http://www.ema.gov.au/www/ema/schools.nsf/Page/Get_The_FactsBushfires\nBushfires - Get the Facts]\". Attorney-General's Department (Australia),\nRetrieved 2013-01-09 .  In the United States, there are typically between\n60,000 and 80,000 wildfires that occur each year, burning 3 million to 10\nmillion acres of land depending on the\nyear. http://www.nifc.gov/fireInfo/fireInfo_stats_totalFires.html\nFossil records and human history contain accounts of wildfires, as wildfires can\noccur in periodic intervals.\nWildfires can cause extensive damage, both to property and human life, but they\nalso have various beneficial effects on wilderness areas. Some plant species\ndepend on the effects of fire for growth and reproduction,\nalthough large wildfires may also have negative ecological effects.\n\nStrategies of wildfire prevention, detection, and suppression have varied over\nthe years, and international wildfire management experts encourage further\ndevelopment of technology and research. One of the more controversial\ntechniques is controlled burning: permitting or even igniting smaller fires to\nminimize the amount of flammable material available for a potential\nwildfire.

some\nwildfires burn in remote forested regions, they can cause extensive destruction\nof homes and other property located in the wildland-urban interface: a zone of\ntransition between developed
