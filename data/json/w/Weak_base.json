As BrÃ¸nstedâLowry bases are proton acceptors, a weak base may\nalso be defined as a chemical base in which protonation is incomplete. This\nresults in a relatively low pH compared to strong bases. Bases range from a pH\nof greater than 7 (7 is neutral, like pure water) to 14 (though some bases are\ngreater than 14). pH has the formula:\n: \\mbox{pH} = -\\log_{10} \\left[ \\mbox{H}^+ \\right]\nSince bases are proton acceptors, the base receives a hydrogen ion from water,\nH 2O, and the remaining H + concentration in the solution\ndetermines pH. Weak bases will have a higher H + concentration because\nthey are less completely protonated than stronger bases and, therefore, more\nhydrogen ions remain in the solution. If you plug in a higher H +\nconcentration into the formula, a low pH results. However, pH of bases is\nusually calculated using the OH - concentration to find the pOH first.\nThis is done because the H + concentration is not a part of the\nreaction, while the OH - concentration is.\n: \\mbox{pOH} = -\\log_{10} \\left[ \\mbox{OH}^- \\right]\n\nBy multiplying a conjugate acid (such as NH 4+ ) and a\nconjugate base (such as NH 3) the following is given:\n\n: K_a \\times K_b = {[H_3O^+] [NH_3]\\over[NH_4^+]} \\times {[NH_4^+] [OH^-\n:]\\over[NH_3]} = [H_3O^+] [OH^-]\n\nSince {K_w} = [H_3O^+] [OH^-] then, ' K_a \\times K_b =\nK_w '\n\nBy taking logarithms of both sides of the equation, the following is reached:\n\n: logK_a + logK_b = logK_w\n\nFinally, multiplying throughout the equation by -1, the equation turns into:\n\n: pK_a + pK_b = pK_w = 14.00\n\nAfter acquiring pOH from the previous pOH formula, pH can be calculated using\nthe formula 'pH = pK w - pOH' where pK w = 14.00.\n\nWeak bases exist in chemical equilibrium much in the same way as weak acids do,\nwith a '[[base dissociation constant]] (K b)' indicating the strength\nof the base. For example, when ammonia is put in water, the following\nequilibrium is set up:\n\n: \\mathrm{K_b={[NH_4^+] [OH^-]\\over[NH_3]}}\n\nBases that have a large K b will ionize more completely and are thus\nstronger bases. As stated above, pH of the solution depends on the H +\nconcentration, which is related to the OH - concentration by the '[[self-\nionization constant]] (K w = 1.0x10 â14 )'. A strong base has\na lower H + concentration because they are fully protonated and less\nhydrogen ions remain in the solution. A lower H + concentration also\nmeans a higher OH - concentration and therefore, a larger\nK b.\n\n\n\nNaOH (s) (sodium hydroxide) is a stronger base than\n(CH 3CH 2) 2NH (l) (diethylamine) which is a\nstronger base than NH 3 (g) (ammonia). As the bases get weaker, the\nsmaller the K b values become.\n","linknr":165,"url":"Weak_base","recorded":1362544152,"links":18,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Bases"],"headings":["Percentage protonated","A typical pH problem","Examples","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/5/2/f527ad48b384c4a6f2328ab8a42a971f.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/a/c/7/ac7b52a8f87104b49e536517a397e1df.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/1/4/c/14cf0b9c22142396e60185078497a046.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/f/f/8fff92ca2d3439b5512eae04c9c8fea1.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/2/0/d/20dbaa640fc8cdb3cca31fb6db1bbb67.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/6/2/4/624bae20eb93709bc38753c774b2476b.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/6/e/3/6e3b7dae0d5baa5ebac5929cff34a4bd.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/e/b/0eb8a1134449c8ec65872d591d4f306a.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/b/5/d/b5dbcd484d917a79500e962b8653da8b.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/2/9/429e42c38e12f6306fdfe7023b5bb11c.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/1/3/0/13040bd8589c2f940597f848423f5cbc.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/2/e/7/2e78271894ff37cd17623727cf1583f1.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/6/a/86ad63ef7fd14a2db4178c8c40cfe0ca.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/b/6/7/b67d398fe4033fea262e770c790a52ee.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/c/d/fcdace73df8c573c2b689281fe7e49f5.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/9/5/6/9564fb842d305dc8d44214218b22edd0.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/3/f/1/3f10afe7f6839edb47b6b5656f001936.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/b/3/e/b3ec5631153c3a27788ef6c2b9612fdf.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/1/6/016185b2cf6b930898762031af7763a8.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["base","chemistry"],["base","chemistry#strong_bases"]],"members":["base"],"related":["Chemical","Base_(chemistry)","Ionize","Aqueous_solution","Brønsted–Lowry_base","Protonation","PH","Proton","Concentration","Chemical_equilibrium","Weak_acid","Diethylamine","Alanine","Ammonia","Methylamine","Strong_base","Strong_base","Weak_acid"]}
