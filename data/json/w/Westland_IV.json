The 'Westland IV' and 'Westland\nWessex' were high wing, three-engined light transport aircraft built by\nWestland Aircraft.\n\nThe Westland IV first flew on 21 February 1929 at which time it was powered by\nthe 95 hp Cirrus engine. This prototype was registered as G-EBXK and was\ncertified for a crew of two and four passengers. The second machine had Hermes\nengines and a metal rear fuselage. The third machine, G-ABAJ, was modified to\ntake the 105 hp Armstrong Siddeley Genet Major engines as well as some\nother changes and became the prototype Westland Wessex. The two Westland IVs\nwere subsequently converted to Wessexes giving 10 aircraft in total.\n\nThe Wessex was noted for its reliability and ability to make short landing\nruns. This made it attractive to Sir Alan Cobham in 1935 when he was looking\nfor a small airliner to use for a service between Guernsey and the UK\nmainland. Previously, flyingboats had been used to provide a service between\nPortsmouth and St Peter Port on the island. There was no public airfield at\nthe time on Guernsey, only the private airfield at L'Eree run by the Guernsey\nAero Club, of which Sir Alan was a member. The Wessex was certified as the\nonly commercial aircraft to use L'Eree. Cobham Air Routes Ltd used the\nfollowing Wessex aircraft:\n\n'G-EBXK' - Westland serial number 1771, granted its certificate of airworthiness\non 21 March 1929. Originally the prototype Westland IV and retained as a\ndemonstrator, later converted to a Wessex and sold to Cobham Air Routes Ltd in\n1935 and withdrawn from use in 1936.\n\n'G-ABAJ' - Westland serial number 1897, c. of a. 27 May 1930. Built as a\nWestland IV and registered as G-AAJI, originally intended for service in Kenya\nwith Wilson's Airways but the order was never taken up. Instead, G-AAJI was\nrebuilt as a Wessex and sold to Sabena with Belgian registration OO-AGC, before\nbeing in turn sold to Cobham in 1935. This aircraft was used by Trafalgar\nAdvertising in 1936.\n\n'G-ADEW' - Westland serial number 1899, c. of a. 6 August 1930, sold to Sabena\nand registered as OO-AGF, then bought by Cobham in 1935. Unfortunately, this\naircraft was lost in the Channel on 3 July 1935, 3 to 4 miles south off The\nNeedles. The only passenger on board, a Mr C F Grainger, was picked up by the SS\nStanmore and taken to Fowey. The pilot, W H Ogden, was presumed drowned within\nthe aircraft and was never found. The blame was largely placed on Ogden, but was\nprobably also due to the age of the Wessex airframes and their engines. This\naccident was the last straw for Sir Alan, who was struggling operationally, and\nhe sold his airline to Olley Air Service.\n\n'G-ADFZ' - Westland serial number 1900, c. of a. 30 August 1930, sold to\nSabena and registered as OO-AGF, and bought by Cobham in 1935. G-ADFZ went on\nto work for Trafalgar Advertising with G-ABAJ, and it was decided to take G-\nADFZ to Blackpool for the air display in September 1935. On 7 September 1935\nit was involved in a collision over Blackpool with an Avro 504N (G-ACOD), the\nWessex crashing in Cedar Square with the crew safe but all three occupants of\nthe Avro being killed. Repaired, G-ADFZ was finally withdrawn from service 1\nDecember 1946.\n","linknr":226,"url":"Westland_IV","recorded":1375087419,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Westland_IV&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Westland_IV&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Westland_Wessex_plane.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0a/Westland_Wessex_plane.jpg/300px-Westland_Wessex_plane.jpg","/wiki/Sabena","/wiki/United_Kingdom","/wiki/Westland_Aircraft","/wiki/Arthur_Davenport_(engineer)","#cite_note-FOOTNOTEJames1991176-1","/wiki/Sabena","/wiki/Westland_Wessex","/wiki/Westland_Aircraft","/wiki/Cirrus_Aero-Engines","/wiki/ADC_Cirrus","/wiki/Armstrong_Siddeley_Genet_Major","#Operators","#Specifications_.28Wessex_.28Genet_Major_1A.29","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Westland_IV&action=edit&section=1","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d7/Flag_of_Egypt_1922.svg/23px-Flag_of_Egypt_1922.svg.png","/wiki/Egypt","/wiki/Egyptian_Air_Force","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/ae/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg/23px-Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png","/wiki/United_Kingdom","/wiki/Royal_Air_Force","/wiki/Cardiff_Municipal_Airport","/wiki/Christchurch_Airfield","/wiki/Oxo_(food)","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/92/Flag_of_Belgium_%28civil%29.svg/23px-Flag_of_Belgium_%28civil%29.svg.png","/wiki/Belgium","/wiki/Sabena","/w/index.php?title=Westland_IV&action=edit&section=2","#cite_note-Jackson_civil_v3p246-7-2","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Wingspan","/wiki/Manufacturer%27s_Weight_Empty","/wiki/Aircraft_engine","/wiki/Armstrong_Siddeley_Genet_Major","/wiki/Radial_engine","/wiki/V_speeds#Regulatory_V-speeds","/wiki/V_speeds#Vc","/wiki/Range_(aircraft)","/wiki/Ceiling_(aircraft)","/wiki/Rate_of_climb","/wiki/Wing_loading","/wiki/Power-to-weight_ratio","/w/index.php?title=Westland_IV&action=edit&section=3","#cite_ref-FOOTNOTEJames1991176_1-0","#CITEREFJames1991","#cite_ref-Jackson_civil_v3p246-7_2-0","#cite_ref-3","/wiki/Special:BookSources/185421103X","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0851778186","http://www.britishaircraft.co.uk/aircraftpage.php?ID=568","/wiki/Wikipedia:Link_rot","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0-85177-847-X","/w/index.php?title=Westland_IV&action=edit&section=4","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Westland_Aircraft","http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1930/untitled0%20-%201146.html","/wiki/Template:Westland_aircraft","/wiki/Template_talk:Westland_aircraft","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Westland_aircraft&action=edit","/wiki/Westland_Aircraft","/wiki/Westland_Helicopters","/wiki/Westland_Dreadnought","/wiki/Westland_Limousine","/wiki/Westland_Lysander","/wiki/Westland-Hill_Pterodactyl","/wiki/Westland_PV-3","/wiki/Westland_F.7/30","/wiki/Westland_Wallace","/wiki/Westland_PV.7","/wiki/Westland_Wallace","/wiki/Westland_Walrus","/wiki/Westland_Wapiti","/wiki/Westland_Widgeon_(fixed_wing)","/wiki/Westland_Witch","/wiki/Westland_Woodpigeon","/wiki/Westland_Wyvern","/wiki/Westland_Yeovil","/wiki/Westland_C.O.W._Gun_Fighter","/wiki/Westland_F.7/30","/wiki/Westland_Interceptor","/wiki/Westland_N.1B","/wiki/Westland_Wagtail","/wiki/Westland_Weasel","/wiki/Westland_Welkin","/wiki/Westland_Westbury","/wiki/Westland_Whirlwind_(fighter)","/wiki/Westland_Wizard","/wiki/Westland_30","/wiki/AgustaWestland_Apache","/wiki/Westland_Sea_King","/wiki/Westland_Dragonfly","/wiki/AgustaWestland_AW101","/wiki/A%C3%A9rospatiale_Gazelle","/wiki/Westland_Lynx","/wiki/AgustaWestland_AW101","/wiki/A%C3%A9rospatiale_Puma","/wiki/Westland_Sea_King","/wiki/Westland_Scout","/wiki/Bell_H-13_Sioux","/wiki/Westland_Lynx","/wiki/Westland_Wasp","/wiki/Westland_Wessex","/wiki/Westland_Westminster","/wiki/Westland_Whirlwind_(helicopter)","/wiki/Westland_Widgeon_(helicopter)","/wiki/Sikorsky_UH-60_Black_Hawk#S-70A","/w/index.php?title=Westland_Mte&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Westland_Wisp&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Westland_Wideye&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Template:AgustaWestland_aircraft","/wiki/Template:Aviation_lists","/wiki/Template_talk:Aviation_lists","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Templa
