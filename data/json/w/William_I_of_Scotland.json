(c 1143 – 4 December 1214)\nreigned as King of the Scots from 1165 to 1214. His reign was the second longest\nin Scottish history before the Act of Union with England in 1707, (James VI's\nwas the longest 1567â1625). He became King following his brother Malcolm IV's\ndeath on 9 December 1165 and was crowned on 24 December 1165.\n\nIn contrast to his deeply religious, frail brother, William was powerfully\nbuilt, redheaded, and headstrong. He was an effective monarch whose reign\nwas marred by his ill-fated attempts to regain control of Northumbria from\nthe Normans.\n\nTraditionally, William is credited with founding Arbroath Abbey, the site of the\nlater Declaration of Arbroath.\n\nHe was not known as \"The Lion\" during his own lifetime, and the title did not\nrelate to his tenacious character or his military prowess. It was attached to\nhim because of his flag or standard, a red lion rampant (with a forked tail) on\na yellow background. This (with the addition of a 'double tressure fleury counter-\nfleury' border) went on to become the Royal standard of Scotland, still used\ntoday but quartered with those of England and of Ireland. It became attached to\nhim because the chronicler John of Fordun called him the \"Lion of Justice\".\n\nWilliam also inherited the title of Earl of Northumbria in 1152 from his father,\nHenry of Huntingdon. He was grandson of David I of Scotland However he had to\ngive up this title to King Henry II of England in 1157. This caused trouble\nafter William became king, since he spent a lot of effort trying to regain\nNorthumbria.\n\nWilliam was a key player in the Revolt of 1173â1174 against Henry II. In 1174,\nat the Battle of Alnwick, during a raid in support of the revolt, William\nrecklessly charged the English troops himself, shouting, \"Now we shall see which\nof us are good knights!\" He was unhorsed and captured by Henry's troops led by\nRanulf de Glanvill and taken in chains to Newcastle, then Northampton, and then\ntransferred to Falaise in Normandy. Henry then sent an army to Scotland and\noccupied it. As ransom and to regain his kingdom, William had to acknowledge\nHenry as his feudal superior and agree to pay for the cost of the English army's\noccupation of Scotland by taxing the Scots. The church of Scotland was also\nsubjected to that of England. This he did by signing the Treaty of Falaise. He\nwas then allowed to return to Scotland. In 1175 he swore fealty to Henry II at\nYork Castle.\n\nThe humiliation of the Treaty of Falaise triggered a revolt in Galloway which\nlasted until 1186, and prompted construction of a castle at Dumfries. In 1179,\nmeanwhile, William and his brother David personally led a force northwards into\nEaster Ross, establishing two further castles, and aiming to discourage the\nNorse Earls of Orkney from expanding beyond Caithness.\n\nA further rising in 1181 involved Donald Meic Uilleim, direct descendant of\nKing Duncan II of Scots. Donald briefly took over Ross; not until his death\n(1187) was William able to reclaim Donald's stronghold of Inverness. Further\nroyal expeditions were required in 1197 and 1202 to fully neutralise the\nOrcadian threat.\n\nThe Treaty of Falaise remained in force for the next fifteen years. Then Richard\nthe Lionheart, needing money to take part in the Third Crusade, agreed to\nterminate it in return for 10,000 silver marks, on 5 December 1189.\n\nDespite the Scots regaining their independence, Anglo-Scottish relations\nremained tense during the first decade of the 13th century. In August 1209 King\nJohn decided to flex the English muscles by marching a large army to Norham\n(near Berwick), in order to exploit the flagging leadership of the ageing\nScottish monarch. As well as promising a large sum of money, the ailing William\nagreed to his elder daughters marrying English nobles and, when the treaty was\nrenewed in 1212, John apparently gained the hand of William's only surviving\nlegitimate son, and heir, Alexander, for his eldest daughter, Joan.\n\nDespite continued dependence on English goodwill, William's reign showed much\nachievement. He threw himself into government with energy and religiously\nfollowed the lines laid down by his grandfather, David I. Anglo-French\nsettlements and feudalization were extended, new burghs founded, criminal law\nclarified, the responsibilities of justices and sheriffs widened, and trade\ngrew. Arbroath Abbey was founded (1178), and the bishopric of Argyll established\n(c.1192) in the same year as papal confirmation of the Scottish church by Pope\nCelestine III.\n\nWilliam is recorded in 1206 as having cured a case of scrofula by his touching\nand blessing a child with the ailment whilst at York. Dalrymple, Sir David (1776). Annals of Scotland. Pub. J.\nMurray. London. P. 300 -301. William died in Stirling in 1214 and lies\nburied in Arbroath Abbey. His son, Alexander II, succeeded him as king, reigning\nfrom 1214 to 1250.\n","linknr":380,"url":"William_I_of_Scotland","recorded":1363498819,"links":["/w/index.php?title=William_the_Lion&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=William_the_Lion&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","/wiki/William_the_Lion","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","/w/index.php?title=William_I_of_Scotland&redirect=no","#mw-head","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Cleanup","/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style","/wiki/Template:Cleanup/doc","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=William_the_Lion&action=edit","/wiki/File:William_I,_King_of_Scots_(seal_01).png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/52/William_I%2C_King_of_Scots_%28seal_01%29.png/220px-William_I%2C_King_of_Scots_%28seal_01%29.png","/wiki/Seal_(emblem)","/wiki/King_of_the_Scots","/wiki/Malcolm_IV_of_Scotland","/wiki/Alexander_II_of_Scotland","/wiki/Ermengarde_de_Beaumont","/wiki/Margaret_of_Scotland,_Countess_of_Kent","/wiki/Isabella_of_Scotland,_Countess_of_Norfolk","/wiki/Alexander_II_of_Scotland","/wiki/Henry_of_Scotland","/wiki/Ada_de_Warenne","/wiki/Huntingdon","/wiki/Huntingdonshire","/wiki/England","/wiki/Stirling","/wiki/Arbroath_Abbey","/wiki/Scottish_Gaelic_language","#cite_note-Annals-1","/wiki/King_of_the_Scots","/wiki/Scottish_history","/wiki/Acts_of_Union_1707","/wiki/England","/wiki/James_I_of_England","/wiki/Malcolm_IV_of_Scotland","/wiki/Northumbria","/wiki/Arbroath_Abbey","/wiki/Declaration_of_Arbroath","/wiki/Royal_standard_of_Scotland","/wiki/Quartering_(heraldry)","/wiki/Coat_of_arms_of_England","/wiki/Coat_of_arms_of_Ireland","/wiki/John_of_Fordun","/wiki/Earl_of_Northumbria","/wiki/David_I_of_Scotland","/wiki/Henry_II_of_England","/wiki/Revolt_of_1173%E2%80%931174","/wiki/Battle_of_Alnwick_(1174)","/wiki/Ranulf_de_Glanvill","/wiki/Newcastle_upon_Tyne","/wiki/Falaise,_Calvados,_France","/wiki/Normandy","/wiki/Treaty_of_Falaise","/wiki/York_Castle","/wiki/Galloway","/wiki/Norsemen","/wiki/Earls_of_Orkney","/wiki/Caithness","/wiki/Meic_Uilleim","/wiki/Duncan_II_of_Scotland","/wiki/Inverness","/wiki/Richard_I_of_England","/wiki/Third_Crusade","/wiki/Mark_(money)","/wiki/York","#cite_note-Dalrymple-2","/wiki/Alexander_II_of_Scotland","/w/index.php?title=William_the_Lion&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Ermengarde_de_Beaumont","/wiki/Henry_I_of_England","/wiki/Woodstock_Palace","/wiki/Edinburgh_Castle","/wiki/Margaret_of_Scotland,_Countess_of_Kent","/wiki/Hubert_de_Burgh,_1st_Earl_of_Kent","/wiki/Isabella_of_Scotland,_Countess_of_Norfolk","/wiki/Roger_Bigod,_4th_Earl_of_Norfolk","/wiki/Alexander_II_of_Scotland","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Gilbert_Marshal,_4th_Earl_of_Pembroke","/wiki/Competitors_for_the_Crown_of_Scotland","/wiki/Robert_Avenel","/wiki/Justiciar_of_Lothian","/wiki/Robert_III_de_Brus","#cite_note-4","/wiki/Robert_de_Ros_(died_1227)","#cite_note-5","/wiki/Eustace_de_Vesci","#cite_note-6","#cite_note-Balfour_Paul.2C_Vol._I.2C_p.5-7","/wiki/Patrick_I,_Earl_of_Dunbar","#cite_note-Balfour_Paul.2C_Vol._I.2C_p.5-7","/w/index.php?title=Roger_de_Mandeville&action=edit&redlink=1","#cite_note-Balfour_Paul.2C_Vol._I.2C_p.5-7","/w/index.php?title=William_the_Lion&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Malcolm_IV_of_Scotland","/wiki/Normans","/wiki/Tam_Lin","/wiki/Fairy_Queen","#cite_note-8","#cite_note-9","#cite_note-10","/w/index.php?title=William_the_Lion&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/Duncan_I_of_Scotland","/wiki/Malcolm_III_of_Scotland","/wiki/David_I_of_Scotland","/wiki/Edward_the_Exile","/wiki/Saint_Margaret_of_Scotland","/wiki/Agatha,_wife_of_Edward_the_Exile","/wiki/Henry,_Earl_of_Northumbria","/wiki/Siward,_Earl_of_Northumbria","/wiki/Waltheof_II,_Earl_of_Northumbria","/wiki/Maud,_Countess_of_Huntingdon","/wiki/Lambert_II,_Count_of_Lens","/wiki/Judith_of_Lens","/wiki/Adelaide_of_Normandy","/wiki/Rodulf_II_de_Warenne","/wiki/William_de_Warenne,_1st_Earl_of_Surrey","/wiki/William_de_Warenne,_2nd_Earl_of_Surrey","/wiki/Gundred,_Countess_of_Surrey","/wiki/Ada_de_Warenne","/wiki/Henry_I_of_France","/wiki/Hugh_I_of_Vermandois","/wiki/Anne_of_Kiev","/wiki/Elizabeth_of_Vermandois","/wiki/Herbert_IV,_Count_of_Vermandois","/wiki/Adelaide,_Countess_of_Vermandois","/w/index.php?title=William_the_Lion&action=edit&section=4","#cite_ref-Annals_1-0",
