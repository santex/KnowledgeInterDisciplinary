Within a given\ncountry, different notations may also be employed for different kinds of\nlocomotives, such as steam, electric, and diesel powered.\n\nEspecially in steam days, wheel arrangement was an important attribute of a\nlocomotive because there were many different types of layout adopted, each wheel\nbeing optimised for a different use (often with only some being actually\n\"driven\"). Modern diesel and electric locomotives are much more uniform, usually\nwith all axles driven.\n","linknr":200,"url":"Wheel_arrangement","recorded":1362554010,"links":32,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Locomotives"],"headings":["Major notation schemes","Comparison from wheel arrangements and wheel picture","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Rail_transport","Locomotive","Locomotive","Steam_locomotive","Electric_locomotive","Diesel_locomotive","Whyte_notation","AAR_wheel_arrangement","Bogie","UIC_classification_of_locomotive_axle_arrangements","Steam_locomotive","United_States","Canada","United_Kingdom","Ireland","North_America","Europe","France","Switzerland","Swiss_locomotive_and_railcar_classification","Narrow_gauge_railway","AAR_wheel_arrangement","UIC_classification_of_locomotive_axle_arrangements","Whyte_notation","Switcher","0-2-2","2-2-0","2-2-2","4-2-0","6-2-0","0-4-0","2-4-0","2-4-2","4-4-0","4-4-2","4-4-4","0-6-0","2-6-0","4-6-0","2-6-2","4-6-2","2-6-4","4-6-4","0-8-0","2-8-0","2-8-2","2-8-4","4-8-0","4-8-2","4-8-4","0-10-0","0-10-2","2-10-0","4-10-0","2-10-2","2-10-4","4-10-2","2-12-0","2-12-2","4-12-2","0-6-6-0","2-6-6-0","2-6-6-2","2-6-6-4","4-6-6-4","Union_Pacific_Challenger","2-6-6-6","0-8-8-0","2-8-8-2","2-8-8-4","4-8-8-2","4-8-8-4","Union_Pacific_Big_Boy","2-10-10-2","Co-Co_locomotives"]}
