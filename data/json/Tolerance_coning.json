{"cursor":"1014","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Tolerance coning' is the engineering discipline of creating a budget of all\ntolerances that potentially add/subtract to affect adequacy of a particular\nparameter. This is particularly critical where stages of design/manufacture\nprecede test/use.\n\nFor example, when setting a test limit for a measurement on each manufactured\nitem of some type, to assure that no bad items are shipped, the limit must be\ntighter than the requirement to allow for the worst case sum of measurement\ninaccuracies (e.g. equipment, test fixture etc.). The design of the item thus\nhas to take into account not only the product requirement but also the test\ntolerances. The build up of this budget is tolerance coning.\n\nElectronics engineers intuitively do tolerance coning and tend to formalise it\nfor critical parameters. However it is also relevant to other engineering\ndisciplines.\n","linknr":79,"url":"Tolerance_coning","recorded":1362538094,"links":13,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Engineering concepts"],"headings":["See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/57/Nuvola_apps_kfig.svg/30px-Nuvola_apps_kfig.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Test_fixture","Test_method","Engineering_tolerance","Tolerance_stack"]}
