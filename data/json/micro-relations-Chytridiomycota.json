The name is derived\nfrom the Greek chytridion, meaning \"little pot\", describing the structure\ncontaining unreleased spores. In older classifications, chytrids (except the\nrecently established order Spizellomycetales) were placed in the class\nPhycomycetes under the subdivision Myxomycophyta of the kingdom Fungi. Also, in\nan older and more restricted sense (not used here), the term \"chytrids\" referred\njust to those fungi in the order Chytridiales. The chytrids have also been\nincluded among the Protista, but are now regularly classed as fungi.\n\nThe chytrids are the most primitive of the fungi and are mostly saprobic,\ndegrading chitin and keratin. The thalli are coenocytic and usually form no true\nmycelium (having rhizoids instead). Some species are unicellular. As with other\nfungi, the cell wall in chytrids is composed of chitin.\n\nMany chytrids are aquatic (mostly found in fresh water). There are approximately\n1,000 chytrid species, in 127 genera, distributed among 5 orders.\n","linknr":305,"url":"Chytridiomycota","recorded":1362684949,"links":41,"instances":["biology","botany","tissue","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Chytridiomycota|"],"headings":["Reproduction","As a parasite","Fossil record","In popular culture","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/Spizellomycete.jpg/220px-Spizellomycete.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["division","botany"],["kingdom","biology"],["order","biology"],["order","biology"],["thallus","tissue"]],"members":["order","division","thallus","kingdom"],"related":["Division_(botany)","Kingdom_(biology)","Fungi","Greek_language","Spore","Biological_classification","Order_(biology)","Spizellomycetales","Phycomycetes","Myxomycophyta","Order_(biology)","Chytridiales","Protista","Saprobic","Chitin","Keratin","Thallus_(tissue)","Coenocytic","Mycelium","Rhizoid","Unicellular","Cell_wall","Chitin","Aquatic_plant","Fresh_water","Zoospore","Gamete","Flagella","Saprotroph","Rhizoids","Haploid","Diploid","Gametangia","Gametes","Zygote","Pheromones","Thalli","Sporangia","Meiosis","Chytridiomycosis","Australia","Panama","Amphibian","Decline_in_frog_populations","Kihansi_Spray_Toad","Tanzania","Golden_toad","Maize","Alfalfa","Potato","Fossil","Scotland","Rhynie_chert","Devonian","Plant","Parasite","Rhyniophyte","Tom_Clancy","Fungus","Radioactive_decay","Islamic","United_States","University_of_Alabama"]}
