Large beef feedlots are called\n concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) in the United States and intensive livestock operations (ILOs) http://www.agriculture.gov.sk.ca/Default.aspx?DN=98892fe8-ed63-\n 4840-a7ba-5045d33bd0c5 or confined feeding operations (CFOs)\n http://www1.agric.gov.ab.ca/$department/deptdocs.nsf/all/epw2069 in\n Canada. They may contain thousands of animals in an array of pens. Most\n feedlots require some type of governmental permit and must have plans in place\n to deal with the large amount of waste that is generated. The Environmental\n Protection Agency has authority under the Clean Water Act to regulate all\n animal feeding operations in the United States. This authority is delegated to\n individual states in some cases. 2008 Final CAFO Rule, USEPA, Office of\n Water, 2009. http://cfpub.epa.gov/npdes/afo/cafofinalrule.cfm In Canada,\n regulation of feedlots is shared between all levels of government.\n","linknr":158,"url":"Feedlot","recorded":1362501643,"links":17,"instances":["nutrition","enclosure"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Livestock","Meat industry","Industrial agriculture","Animal cruelty"],"headings":["Scheduling and diet","Waste recycling","History","Marketing","See also","References","External links","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/75/Feedlot-1.jpg/350px-Feedlot-1.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["pen","enclosure"],["diet","nutrition"]],"members":["diet","pen"],"related":["Texas_Panhandle","Factory_farming","Beef","Cattle","Concentrated_animal_feeding_operations","Pen_(enclosure)","Environmental_Protection_Agency","Clean_Water_Act","Rangeland","Cereal","Pasture","Diet_(nutrition)","Cottonseed_meal","Rumen","Food_energy","Fed_cattle","Slaughterhouse","Out-wintering_pads","Forward_contract","Livestock","Managed_intensive_grazing","Temple_Grandin"]}
