Birgit Hadeler, Sirkka Scholz, Ralf\nReski (1995) Gelrite and agar differently influence cytokinin-sensitivity of a\nmoss. Journal of Plant Physiology 146, 369-371 There are different types\nof media for growing different types of cells.\n\nThere are two major types of growth media: those used for cell culture, which\nuse specific cell types derived from plants or animals, and microbiological\nculture, which are used for growing microorganisms, such as bacteria or yeast.\nThe most common growth media for microorganisms are nutrient broths and agar\nplates; specialized media are sometimes required for microorganism and cell\nculture growth. Some organisms, termed fastidious organisms,\nrequire specialized environments due to complex nutritional requirements.\nViruses, for example, are obligate intracellular parasites and require a growth\nmedium containing living cells.\n","linknr":367,"url":"Growth_medium","recorded":1362505898,"links":41,"instances":["brewing","food","biology","selective_medium","chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Growth media|Growth media","Microbiological media"],"headings":["Types of growth media","Enriched media","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/93/Agar_plate_with_colonies.jpg/250px-Agar_plate_with_colonies.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/07/Physcomitrella_growing_on_agar_plates.jpg/220px-Physcomitrella_growing_on_agar_plates.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/Campylobacter_jejuni.jpg/250px-Campylobacter_jejuni.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/Agarplate_redbloodcells_edit.jpg/250px-Agarplate_redbloodcells_edit.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7c/Agarplates.jpg/250px-Agarplates.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cell","biology"],["suspension","chemistry"],["wort","brewing"],["fermentation","food"],["ym","selective_medium"]],"members":["wort","fermentation","cell","ym","suspension"],"related":["Microorganism","Cell_(biology)","Plant","Moss","Ralf_Reski","Gellan_gum","Agar","Cytokinin","Cell_culture","Microbiological_culture","Bacteria","Yeast","Agar_plate","Virus","Parasite","Agar","Petri_dish","Agar_plate","Colloid","Suspension_(chemistry)","Hormones","Growth_factors","Blood_serum","Unicellular_organism","Carbon","Nitrogen","Glucose","Glycerol","Ammonium","Salt","Nitrate","Inorganic","Yeast_extract","Wort_(brewing)","Beer","Fermentation_(food)","Axenic","Agar_plate","Petri_dish","Glucose","Chemically_defined_medium","Recombinant_DNA","Exconjugant","Glucose","Succinate","Magnesium","Nitrogen","Phosphorus","Sulfur","Protein","Nucleic_acid","Amino_acid","Sugar","Auxotrophic","Staphylococcus","Antibiotic","Ampicillin","Tetracycline","Amino_acid","Proline","Escherichia_coli","Genomics","Chromosome_map","Cell_culture","Antibiotic_resistance","Metabolite","Gene","Allele","Genetic_marker","Eukaryotic","Neomycin","Transfection","Gancyclovir","Herpes_simplex_virus","Eosin_methylene_blue","Methylene_blue","Gram-positive","Gram_negative","YM_(selective_medium)","Yeast","Mold","PH","MacConkey_agar","Gram-negative","Hektoen_enteric_agar","Mannitol_salt_agar","XLD_agar","Buffered_charcoal_yeast_extract_agar","Neutral_red","Phenol_red","Eosin","Methylene_blue","Blood_agar","Group_A_streptococcal_infection","Eosin_methylene_blue","MacConkey_agar","Mannitol_salt_agar","X-gal","Lac_operon","Anaerobic_organism","Cholera","Blood_agar","Chocolate_agar","Cell_biology"]}
