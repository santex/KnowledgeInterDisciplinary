Cetus is Latin and is used in biological names to mean\n\"whale\"; its original meaning, \"large sea animal\", was more general. It comes\nfrom Ancient Greek ({{lang|grc-Latn|[[kÄtos]]}}), meaning \"whale\" or \"any huge\nfish or sea monster\". In Greek mythology, the monster Perseus defeated was\ncalled Ceto, which is depicted by the constellation of Cetus. Cetology is the\nbranch of marine science associated with the study of cetaceans.\n\nFossil evidence suggests that cetaceans share a common ancestor with land-\ndwelling mammals that began living in marine environments around 50 million\nyears ago. Today, they are the mammals best adapted to aquatic life. The body of\na cetacean is fusiform (spindle-shaped). The forelimbs are modified into\nflippers. The tiny hindlimbs are vestigial; they do not attach to the backbone\nand are hidden within the body. The tail has horizontal s. Cetaceans are nearly\nhairless, and are insulated from the cooler water they inhabit by a thick layer\nof blubber.\n\nSome species are noted for their high intelligence. At the 2012 meeting in\nVancouver, Canada, the American Association for the Advancement of Science (the\nworld's biggest science conference), support was reiterated for a cetacean bill\nof rights, listing cetaceans as \"non-human persons\".\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Cetacea","recorded":1372152405,"links":[],"instances":["anatomy","anatomy","anatomy","biology","ziphiid","whale","biology","whale","anatomy"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Cetaceans|"],"headings":["Physical
