the crossroads of Central Europe, the\nBalkans, and the Mediterranean. Its capital and largest city is Zagreb. The\ncountry is divided into 20 counties and the city of Zagreb. Croatia covers and\nhas diverse, mostly continental and Mediterranean climates. Croatia's Adriatic\nSea coast contains more than a thousand islands. The country's population is\n4.28&nbsp;million, most of whom are Croats, with the most common religious\ndenomination being Roman Catholicism. Having joined on 1 July 2013, Croatia is\nthe newest, 28th member state of the European Union.\n\nThe Croats arrived in the area of present-day Croatia during the early part of\nthe 7th century. They organised the state into two duchies by the 9th century.\nTomislav became the first king by 925 AD, elevating Croatia to the status of a\nkingdom. The Kingdom of Croatia retained its sovereignty for nearly two\ncenturies, reaching its peak during the rule of Kings Peter Krešimir IV and\nDmitar Zvonimir. Croatia entered a personal union with Hungary in 1102. In 1527,\nfaced with Ottoman conquest the Croatian Parliament elected Ferdinand I of the\nHouse of Habsburg to the Croatian throne. In 1918, after World War I, Croatia\nwas included in the short-lived State of Slovenes, Croats, and Serbs which\nseceded from Austria–Hungary and merged into the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. A\nfascist Croatian puppet state existed during World War II. After the war,\nCroatia became a founding member and a federal constituent of Second Yugoslavia,\na socialist state. In June 1991, Croatia declared independence, which came into\neffect on 8 October of the same year. The Croatian War of Independence was\nfought successfully during the four years following the declaration.\n\nCroatia today has a very high Human Development Index. The International\nMonetary Fund classified Croatia as an emerging and developing economy, and the\nWorld Bank identified it as a high income economy. Croatia is a member of the\nEuropean Union, United Nations, the Council of Europe, NATO, the World Trade\nOrganization and a founding member of the Union for the Mediterranean. As an\nactive participant in the UN peacekeeping forces, Croatia has contributed troops\nto the NATO-led mission in Afghanistan and took a non-permanent seat on the UN\nSecurity Council for the 2008–2009 term.\n\nThe service sector dominates Croatia's economy, followed by the industrial\nsector and agriculture. Tourism is a significant source of revenue during the\nsummer, with Croatia ranked the 18th most popular tourist destination in the\nworld. The state controls a part of the economy, with substantial government\nexpenditure. The European Union is Croatia's most important trading partner.\nSince 2000, the Croatian government has invested in infrastructure, especially\ntransport routes and facilities along the Pan-European corridors. Internal\nsources produce a significant portion of energy in Croatia; the rest is\nimported. Croatia provides a universal health care system and free primary and\nsecondary education, while supporting culture through numerous public\ninstitutions and through corporate investments in media and publishing.\n","title":"croatia","headings":["Etymology","History","Geography","Politics","Economy","Demographics","Culture","See also","References","Bibliography","External
