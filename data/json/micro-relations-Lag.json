It includes the time to encode the packet for\ntransmission and transmit it, the time for that data to traverse the network\nequipment between the nodes, and the time to receive and decode the data. This\nis also known as \"one-way latency\". A minimum bound on latency is determined by\nthe distance between communicating devices and the speed at which the signal\npropagates in the circuits (typically 70â95% of the speed of light in vacuum).\nActual latency is often much higher because of packet processing in networking\nequipment, and other traffic.\n\nThe term 'lag' is often also used as a synonym for communication\nlatency.
