Imaging modalities have long been crucial to\nthe researcher in observing changes, either at the organ, tissue, cell, or\nmolecular level, in animals responding to physiological or environmental\nchanges. Imaging modalities that are non-invasive and in vivo have become\nespecially important to study animal models longitudinally. Broadly speaking,\nthese imaging systems can be categorized into primarily morphological/anatomical\nand primarily molecular imaging techniques. Willmann JK, van\nBruggen N, Dinkelborg LM, Gambhir SS. Molecular imaging in drug development. Nat\nRev Drug Discov 2008 Jul;7:591-607. Techniques such as high-frequency micro-\nultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) are\nusually used for anatomical imaging, while optical imaging (fluorescence and\nbioluminescence), positron emission tomography (PET), and single photon emission\ncomputed tomography (SPECT) are usually used for molecular visualizations.\n\nThese days, many manufacturers provide multi-modal systems combining the\nadvantages of anatomical modalities such as CT and MR with the functional\nimaging of PET and SPECT. As in the clinical market, common combinations are\nSPECT/CT, PET/CT and PET/MR.\n","linknr":237,"url":"Preclinical_imaging","recorded":1362505383,"links":16,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://biosupport.licor.com/docs/SystematicApprch_MO2.pdf"],"categories":["Imaging","Medical physics","Medical imaging"],"headings":["Micro-ultrasound","Micro-PAT","Micro-MRI","Micro-CT","Micro-PET","Micro-SPECT","Optical Imaging","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e0/Vevo_2100.PNG/220px-Vevo_2100.PNG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f8/Micro-MRI.JPG/220px-Micro-MRI.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/7e/Micro-CT.JPG/220px-Micro-CT.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a0/VolRenderShearWarp.gif/220px-VolRenderShearWarp.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/Mouse02-spect.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["High-frequency_micro-ultrasound","Magnetic_resonance_imaging","Computed_tomography","Fluorescence","Bioluminescence","Positron_emission_tomography","Single_photon_emission_computed_tomography","SPECT/CT","PET/CT","PET/MR","High-frequency_micro-ultrasound","VisualSonics","Microbubbles","Angiogenesis","Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor_receptors","Ultrasound_research_interface","Cardiotoxicity","Biomarkers","Photoacoustic_tomography","Hemodynamic","VisualSonics","Craniotomy","Hemoglobin","FMRI","Magnetic_Resonance_Imaging","Paramagnetic","Radiofrequency","Computed_Tomography","Radiation","Radiotherapy","Confounding_variable","Positron_Emission_Tomography","Γ-rays","18F-FDG","Single_Photon_Emission_Computed_Tomography","Γ-rays","Technetium-99m","Γ-rays","Γ-rays","Radiation","Radiotherapy","Confounding_variable","Chelating","99mTC","Fluorescence","Bioluminescence","Charged_Coupled_Device","Bioluminescence","Fluorochromes"]}
