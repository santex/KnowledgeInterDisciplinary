{"cursor":"7549","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n.]] The 'Ionian school', a type of Greek philosophy centred in Miletus, Ionia in\nthe 6th and 5th centuries BCE, is something of a misnomer. Although Ionia was a\ncentre of Western philosophy, the scholars it produced, including Thales,\nAnaximander, Anaximenes, Heraclitus, Anaxagoras, Archelaus, and Diogenes of\nApollonia, American International Encyclopedia, J.J. Little Co., New York\n1954, Vol VIII had such diverse viewpoints that it cannot be said to be a\nspecific school of philosophy. Aristotle called them physiologoi meaning 'those\nwho discoursed on nature', but he did not group them together as an \"Ionian\nschool\". The classification can be traced to the 2nd century historian of\nphilosophy Sotion. They are sometimes referred to as cosmologists, since they\nwere largely physicalists who tried to explain the nature of matter.\n\nWhile some of these scholars are included in the Milesian school of philosophy,\nothers are more difficult to categorize.\n\nMost cosmologists thought that although matter can change from one form to\nanother, all matter has something in common which does not change. They did not\nagree what it was that all things had in common, and did not experiment to find\nout, but used abstract reasoning rather than religion or mythology to explain\nthemselves, thus becoming the first philosophers in the Western tradition.\n\nLater philosophers widened their studies to include other areas of thought. The\nEleatic school, for example, also studied epistemology, or how people come to\nknow what exists. But the Ionians were the first group of philosophers that we\nknow of, and so remain historically important.\n","linknr":259,"url":"Ionian_School_(philosophy)","recorded":1362537951,"links":25,"instances":["philosophy","philosopher","philosopher","metaphysics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Philosophical schools and traditions","Presocratic philosophy","Ionia"],"headings":["Thales","Anaximander","Heraclitus","Empedocles","Anaxagoras","Archelaus","Hippo","Diogenes of Apollonia","Notes","See also","External links","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/Map_Ciudades_Antiguas_Asia_Menor.svg/220px-Map_Ciudades_Antiguas_Asia_Menor.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/62/PD-icon.svg/12px-PD-icon.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["archelaus","philosopher"],["cosmology","metaphysics"],["archelaus","philosopher"],["hippo","philosopher"],["mechanism","philosophy"]],"members":["mechanism","archelaus","hippo","cosmology"],"related":["Greek_philosophy","Miletus","Ionia","Thales","Anaximander","Anaximenes","Heraclitus","Anaxagoras","Archelaus_(philosopher)","Diogenes_of_Apollonia","Aristotle","Sotion","Cosmology_(metaphysics)","Physicalism","Milesian_school","Religion","Mythology","Eleatics","Epistemology","Thales","Miletus","Anaximander","Heraclitus","Ephesus","Empedocles","Agrigentum","Sicily","Anaxagoras","Clazomenae","Classical_element","Archelaus_(philosopher)","Ion_of_Chios","Socrate","Hippo_(philosopher)","Magna_Graecia","Italy","Diogenes_of_Apollonia","Apollonia","Crete","Thrace","Cosmogony","Hylomorphism","Mechanism_(philosophy)","Monism","Milesian_School","Pre-Socratic_philosophy","Ionian_Enlightenment"]}
