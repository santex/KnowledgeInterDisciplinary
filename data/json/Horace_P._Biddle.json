{"cursor":"2894","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Horace Peters Biddle' (born Ohio around 1812; died Logansport, Indiana May 13,\n1900) was a lawyer, judge, poet, musicologist, and famous hermit.\n\nBorn on what was then the frontier, Biddle was the youngest of 9 children and\nwas largely raised by his oldest sister after the death of his mother when\nBiddle was five. After working for 7 years for his brother Daniel, a store\nowner, he caught the attention of lawyer and future Ohio Senator Thomas Ewing\nwho advised him to study law and found a place for him in the office of H. H.\nHunter. After being admitted to the Ohio Bar in 1839, Biddle moved to\nLogansport, Indiana and opened a practice there. He soon became a circuit court\njudge. In 1850 he was a member of the state constitutional convention. In 1852\nhe ran for United States Representative but was unsuccessful. He was elected as\na Republican to the Supreme Court of Indiana in 1857, but the court decided that\nthe vacancy, created by a resignation, could be filled by the governor by\nappointment. Biddle instead served a 12-year term as circuit court judge. He was\nelected to the Indiana Supreme Court in 1874 and served from January 1875 to\nJanuary 1881.\n\nBiddle was also a poet who published a number of works; his work was praised by\nWashington Irving and others. He published several works on literary theory,\nincluding The Definition of Poetry (1873) and The Analysis of Rhyme (1876). He\ntranslated a number of works (The Swallow by Lamartine, for example) and\npublished a book on Russian literature. He published several works on sound and\nmusic theory, including The Musical Scale (1860), a Review of [[John\nTyndall|Tyndall]] on Sound (1872), and a pamphlet describing an instrument of\nhis invention called the tetrachord. Brainard's Biographies of American\nMusicians, ed. E. Douglas Bomberger, 1999, p. 31-33\n\nIn his last years Biddle became rather reclusive, rarely leaving his home in\nLogansport, which was on a large island in the Wabash River. His will was not\nfound until almost a year after his death; his estate went largely to his niece\nEva Peters Reynolds.
