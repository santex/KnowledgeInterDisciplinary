{"cursor":"5496","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Karl Aage Rasmussen' (born 13 December 1947 in Kolding, Denmark) is a Danish\ncomposer and writer.\n\nQuotation and particularly collage played an important role in his music from\nthe early 70s, but increasingly he used pre-existing musical material in new\nconnections and for new purposes, most often in a densely woven montage of small\nidioms which in themselves were too tiny to work as quotes, but were put\ntogether so closely as to create entirely new patterns. He continued to use\nmontage technique, but the non-directional expression was gradually replaced by\ndevelopmental forms. This is apparent in music for the stage and was later\ncontinued in works such as âA Symphony in Timeâ and the string quartets âSolos\nand Shadowsâ and âSurrounded by Scalesâ.\n\nThe chamber symphony âMovements on a Moving Lineâ marks the beginning of a long\nperiod dominated by an interest in time and tempo, here as a kind of time-travel\nwhere the same music seems to appear and disappear in different tempi. New\nconceptions of time, partly related to the self-similarity in so-called fractal\nmathematics, has dominated his music since then. In more recent years\npsychological and dramatic dimensions have emerged in works such as the violin\nconcerto, âScherzo with Bellsâ and âWebs in a stolen Dreamâ.\n\nFor more than two decades Rasmussen worked as full professor of composition at\nthe Academy of Music in Aarhus, Denmark. Among his students: Louis Aguirre\nRovira, Kaj Aune, Peter Bruun, Anders BrÃ¸dsgaard, Karsten Fundal, Michael\nNyvang, and Simon Steen-Andersen.\n\nRasmussen is a prolific writer of essays, so far collected in three volumes. His\nbooks on Glenn Gould, Robert Schumann and Sviatoslav Richter have reached a wide\naudience. Moreover he has lately been engaged in several large projects centered\naround the music of Franz Schubert. Schubert left his opera âSakontalaâ\nunfinished and with only the parts for singers sketched out, but Rasmussen\ncompleted and orchestrated a performing version of the opera, first performed in\nStuttgart 2006. He has further reconstructed what he believes to be Schubert's\nâGasteinâ symphony, formerly considered lost, and an orchestral version of\nSchubert's melodrama âDer Taucherâ commissioned by the Danish singer Bo Skovhus.\n","linknr":131,"url":"Karl_Aage_Rasmussen","recorded":1374520625,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Karl_Aage_Rasmussen&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Karl_Aage_Rasmussen&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Kolding,_Denmark","/wiki/Quotation","/wiki/Collage","/wiki/Montage_(music)","/wiki/Fractal","/wiki/Peter_Bruun","/wiki/Essay","/wiki/Glenn_Gould","/wiki/Robert_Schumann","/wiki/Sviatoslav_Richter","/wiki/Franz_Schubert","/wiki/Stuttgart","/wiki/Bo_Skovhus","#Selected_works","#Opera","#Orchestral","#Concertante","#Chamber_music","#Piano_solo","#Arrangements.2C_transcriptions_etc.","#Honors","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Karl_Aage_Rasmussen&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Karl_Aage_Rasmussen&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Radio_opera","/w/index.php?title=Karl_Aage_Rasmussen&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/Asger_Jorn","/w/index.php?title=Karl_Aage_Rasmussen&action=edit&section=4","/w/index.php?title=Karl_Aage_Rasmussen&action=edit&section=5","/w/index.php?title=Karl_Aage_Rasmussen&action=edit&section=6","/w/index.php?title=Karl_Aage_Rasmussen&action=edit&section=7","/wiki/Carl_Nielsen","/wiki/Commotio_(organ_music_by_Carl_Nielsen)","/wiki/Franz_Schubert","/wiki/Robert_Schumann","/wiki/Hans_Christian_Andersen","/wiki/Johannes_Brahms","/wiki/Igor_Stravinsky","/wiki/Erik_Satie","/w/index.php?title=Karl_Aage_Rasmussen&action=edit&section=8","/w/index.php?title=Karl_Aage_Rasmussen&action=edit&section=9","http://www.karlaagerasmussen.com","http://www.ewh.dk/Default.aspx?TabId=2449&State_2955=2&composerId_2955=1267","http://www.gyldendal.dk/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/AuthorTitlesDisplay?storeId=10001&catalogId=10002&langId=1000&start=0&count=10&authorId=karl_aage_rasmussen_01","/wiki/Authority_control","http://www.worldcat.org/identities/lccn-n83-42580","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/79180037","/wiki/Library_of_Congress_Control_Number","http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n83042580","/wiki/Integrated_Authority_File","http://d-nb.info/gnd/119087898","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","/wiki/Kolding,_Denmark","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Karl_Aage_Rasmussen&oldid=545479087","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1947_births","/wiki/Category:Living_people","/wiki/Category:People_from_Kolding","/wiki/Category:Danish_composers","/wiki/Category:20th-century_classical_composers","/wiki/Category:21st-century_classical_composers","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_LCCN_identifiers","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_GND_identifiers","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Karl+Aage+Rasmussen&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Karl+Aage+Rasmussen","/wiki/Karl_Aage_Rasmussen","/wiki/Talk:Karl_Aage_Rasmussen","#","/wiki/Karl_Aage_Rasmussen","/w/index.php?title=Karl_Aage_Rasmussen&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Karl_Aage_Rasmussen&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Karl_Aage_Rasmussen","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Karl_Aage_Rasmussen","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Karl_Aage_Rasmussen&oldid=545479087","/w/index.php?title=Karl_Aage_Rasmussen&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6371516","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Karl_Aage_Rasmussen&id=545479087","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Karl+Aage+Rasmussen","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Karl+Aage+Rasmussen&oldid=545479087&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Karl_Aage_Rasmussen&printa
