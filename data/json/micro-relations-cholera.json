The main symptoms are watery diarrhea and vomiting.\nTransmission occurs primarily by drinking water or eating food that has been\ncontaminated by the feces (waste product) of an infected person, including one\nwith no apparent symptoms. The severity of the diarrhea and vomiting can lead to\nrapid dehydration and electrolyte imbalance, and death in some cases. The\nprimary treatment is oral rehydration therapy, typically with oral rehydration\nsolution, to replace water and electrolytes. If this is not tolerated or does\nnot provide improvement fast enough, intravenous fluids can also be used.\nAntibacterial drugs are beneficial in those with severe disease to shorten its\nduration and severity. Worldwide, it affects 3â5 million people and causes\n100,000â130,000 deaths a year . Cholera was one of the earliest infections to be\nstudied by epidemiological methods.\n","linknr":1142,"url":"cholera","recorded":1362902623,"links":132,"instances":["physician","virology","biology","musicologist","biology","personification"],"pdf":["http://www.who.int/immunization/Cholera_PP_Accomp_letter__Mar_10_2010.pdf","http://www.who.int/immunization/Cholera_PP_Accomp_letter__Mar_10_2010.pdf","http://www.emro.who.int/csr/Media/PDF/cholera_whopolicy.pdf","http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dbmd/diseaseinfo/cholera/top.pdf","http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dbmd/diseaseinfo/cholera/top.pdf","http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2005/9241593180.pdf","http://www.cdc.gov/haiticholera/pdf/chw_trainingmaterialsforcholera.pdf"],"categories":["Cholera|","Biological
