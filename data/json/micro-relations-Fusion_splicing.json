{"cursor":"4000","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n'Fusion splicing' is the act of joining two optical fibers end-to-end using\nheat. The goal is to fuse the two fibers together in such a way that light\npassing through the fibers is not scattered or reflected back by the splice,\nand so that the splice and the region surrounding it are almost as strong as\nthe virgin fiber itself. The source of heat is usually an electric arc, but can\nalso be a laser, or a gas flame, or a tungsten filament through which current\nis passed.\n","linknr":126,"url":"Fusion_splicing","recorded":1362543891,"links":15,"instances":["fiber","fiber","fiber","physics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Industrial processes","Fiber optics","Glass forming"],"headings":["Process","Hardware","Governing standards","References","See also","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/Core_alignment_splicer_by_Ilsintech.png/170px-Core_alignment_splicer_by_Ilsintech.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["reflection","physics"],["stripping","fiber"],["cleave","fiber"],["bending","fiber"]],"members":["bending","stripping","cleave","reflection"],"related":["Optical_fiber","Scattering","Reflection_(physics)","Electric_arc","Electrical_filament","Electric_current","Stripping_(fiber)","Cleave_(fiber)","Recoating","Optical_fiber_connector","Mechanical_splice","Insertion_loss","Return_loss","Optical_fiber","Single_mode_optical_fiber","Multi-mode_optical_fiber","Fiber_optic_communication","Bending_(fiber)"]}
