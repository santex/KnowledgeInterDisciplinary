      "text" : "Units of measurement for time have historically been based on the movement of\nthe Sun (as seen from Earth). Shorter intervals were measured by physiological\nperiods such as drawing breath, winking or the pulse.\n\nUnits of time consisting of a number of years include the lustrum (five years)\nand the olympiad (four years). The month could be divided into half-months or\nfortnights, and quarters or weeks. Longer periods were given in lifetimes or\ngenerations (saecula, aion), subdivisions of the solar day in hours. The\nSothic cycle was a period of 1,461 years of 365 days in the Ancient Egyptian\ncalendar. Medieval (Pauranic) Hindu cosmology is notorious for introducing\nnames for fabulously long time periods, such as [[Kalpa (aeon)|kalpa]] (4.32\nbillion years).\n\nIn classical antiquity, the hour divided the daylight period into 12 equal\nparts. The duration of an hour thus varied over the course of the year. In\nclassical China, the [[Ke (unit)|kè]] (刻) was a unit of decimal time, dividing a\nday into 100 equal intervals of 14.4 minutes. Alongside the ke, there were\ndouble hours (shíchen) also known as watches. Because one cannot divide 12\ndouble hours into 100 ke evenly, each ke was subdivided into 60 fēn (分).\n\nThe introduction of the minute (minuta; ′) as the 60th part of an hour, the\nsecond (seccunda; ′′) as the 60th part of a minute, and the third (tertia; ′′′)\nas the 60th part of the second dates to the medieval period, used by Al-Biruni\naround AD 1000, and by Roger Bacon in the 13th century. Bacon further subdivided\nthe tertia into a quarta or fourth (′′′′). Hindu chronology divides the civil\nday (daylight hours) into vipalas, palas and ghatikas. A [[tithi]] is the 30th\npart of the synodic month.\n\nThe introduction of the division of the solar day into 24 hours of equal\nlength, as it were the length of a classical hour at equinox used regardless of\ndaylight hours, dates to the 14th century, due to the development of the first\nmechanical clocks.\n\nToday, the fundamental unit of time suggested by the International System of\nUnits is the second, since 1967 defined as the second of International Atomic\nTime, based on the radiation emitted by a Caesium-133 atom in the ground state.\nIts definition was calibrated such that 86,400 seconds corresponded to a solar\nday. 31,557,600 (86,400 × 365.25) seconds are a Julian year, exceeding the true\nlength of a solar year by about 21 ppm.\n\nBased on the second as the base unit, the following time units are in use as\nfollows: *minute (1 min = 60 s) *hour (1 h = 60 min = 3.6 ks) *Julian day (1 d =\n24 h = 86.4 ks) *week (7 d = 604.8 ks) *Julian year (1 a = 365.25 d = 31.5576\nMs) *decade (10 years/annum) *century (100 annum = 3.15576 Gs) *millennium (1 ka\n= 31.5576 Gs)\n\nThere are a number of proposals for decimal time, or decimal calendars, notably\nin the French Republican Calendar of 1793. Such systems have either ten days per\nweek, a multiple of ten days in a month, or ten months per year.\n\nA suggestion for hexadecimal time divides the Julian day into 16 hexadecimal\nhours of 1h 30 min each, or 65,536 hexadecimal seconds (1 hexsec ≈ 1.32 s).\n\nThe Planck time (t<sub>P</sub>) is a natural unit of time, the shortest possible\ninterval that can be meaningfully considered in quantum mechanics. t<sub>P</sub>\nequals about 5.4&nbsp;×&nbsp;10<sup>&minus;44</sup>&nbsp;s.\n\n marked with units of time according to the internationally accepted Gregorian\n calendar.]]\n",
