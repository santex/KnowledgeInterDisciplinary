This appears to be a solitary star\nlocated at a distance of 162 light-years from Earth. Although it is bright enough to be seen with the naked eye,\nthe declination of this star means that it is best viewed from the southern\nhemisphere and is only readily visible below the tropic of cancer.\n\nThis star has more than three times the mass of the Sun and is about 330 million\nyears old. The spectrum of this star matches a stellar\nclassification of G8 II-III, with the luminosity class\nnotation 'II-III' indicating it shows some traits of both a giant star and a\nbright giant. At this evolutionary stage, the atmosphere has expanded to almost\nthirteen times the radius of the Sun and the outer envelope has an effective\ntemperature of 5,196 K. X-ray emission has been\ndetected from this star, with an estimated luminosity of .\n\nAlpha Reticuli has a 12th-magnitude visual companion, CCDM J04144-6228B, at\nan angular separation of 48 arcseconds away along a position angle of\n355Â°. Since the two stars share a common proper motion across the\ncelestial sphere, it is possible that Alpha Reticuli, rather than being\nsolitary, may instead be the primary component of a binary star system with an\norbital period is at least 60,000 years.\n","linknr":299,"url":"Alpha_Reticuli","recorded":1362560947,"links":22,"instances":["constellation"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Reticulum (constellation)","G-type bright giants","Binary stars","Bayer objects|Reticuli, Alpha","HR objects|1336","Hipparcos objects|019780","Henry Draper Catalogue objects|027256","Durchmusterung objects|PD-62 332","M-type main sequence stars"],"headings":["Naming","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/Reticulum_IAU.svg/250px-Reticulum_IAU.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/Cercle_rouge_100%25.svg/12px-Cercle_rouge_100%25.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["reticulum","constellation"],["reticulum","constellation"]],"members":["reticulum"],"related":["J2000.0","J2000.0","International_Celestial_Reference_System","Reticulum_(constellation)","Catalog_of_Components_of_Double_and_Multiple_Stars","Durchmusterung","Fifth_Fundamental_Catalogue","Boss_General_Catalogue","Henry_Draper_Catalogue","Hipparcos_Catalogue","Bright_Star_Catalogue","Index_Catalogue_of_Visual_Double_Stars","PPM_Star_Catalogue","Smithsonian_Astrophysical_Observatory_Star_Catalog","Washington_Double_Star_Catalog","Bayer_designation","List_of_stars_in_Reticulum","Circumpolar_constellation","Reticulum_(constellation)","Apparent_visual_magnitude","Light-year","Earth","Declination","Tropic_of_cancer","Spectrum","Stellar_classification","Luminosity_class","Giant_star","Bright_giant","Stellar_evolution","Effective_temperature","Apparent_visual_magnitude","Double_star","Angular_separation","Arcsecond","Position_angle","Proper_motion","Celestial_sphere","Binary_star","Orbital_period","Chinese_language","Theta_Doradus","SIMBAD","Centre_de_Données_astronomiques_de_Strasbourg","United_States_Naval_Observatory"]}
