This may be due to a lack of sugars, the presence of some other\ntaste that masks sweetness, or an underabundance of simple carbohydrates that\ncan be converted to sugar by enzymes in the mouth (amylase in particular). The\nterm \"dry\" may be applied to types of beer, wine, distilled spirits, or any\nother form of alcoholic beverage.\n\nIn a dry martini the dryness refers to the amount of vermouth used in the\ndrink.
