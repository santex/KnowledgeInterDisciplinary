It is\n112 km long.\n\nIts headstreams â the 'Little Enz' and the 'Big Enz' â rise in the northern\nBlack Forest, the latter at EnzklÃ¶sterle. In Calmbach (City of Bad Wildbad), the\nLittle Enz and the Big Enz join to form the Enz. The river passes through\nNeuenbÃ¼rg and Pforzheim, where it leaves the Black Forest. It then flows through\nthe cities of Vaihingen and Bietigheim-Bissingen. Along the lower course, wine\nis grown. Near Besigheim the Enz feeds into the Neckar.\n\nIn earlier times the Enz was important for floating timber.\n","linknr":120,"url":"enz","recorded":1362579329,"links":26,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Rivers of Baden-Württemberg"],"headings":[],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/93/Enzviadukt.jpg/288px-Enzviadukt.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/74/Coat_of_arms_of_Baden-W%C3%BCrttemberg_%28lesser%29.svg/21px-Coat_of_arms_of_Baden-W%C3%BCrttemberg_%28lesser%29.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Bietigheim_Enz_Valley_Viaduct","Bietigheim-Bissingen","Black_Forest","Neckar","Germany","Neckar","Baden-Württemberg","Black_Forest","Enzklösterle","Calmbach","Bad_Wildbad","Neuenbürg","Pforzheim","Vaihingen","Bietigheim-Bissingen","Wine","Besigheim","Timber"]}
