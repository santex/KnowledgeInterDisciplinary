{"cursor":"45704","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nThe 'definition ofplanet' set in 2006 by the International Astronomical Union\n(IAU) states that, in the Solar System, a planet is a celestial body which:\n# is in orbit around the Sun, has sufficient mass to assume hydrostatic\n# equilibrium (a nearly round shape), and has \"cleared the neighbourhood\" around\n# its orbit.\n\nA non-satellite body fulfilling only the first two of these criteria is\nclassified as a \"dwarf planet\". According to the IAU, \"planets and dwarf planets\nare two distinct classes of objects\". A non-satellite body fulfilling only the\nfirst criterion is termed a \"small Solar System body\" (SSSB). Initial drafts\nplanned to include dwarf planets as a subcategory of planets, but because this\ncould potentially have led to the addition of several dozens of planets into the\nSolar System, this draft was eventually dropped. The definition was a\ncontroversial one and has drawn both support and criticism from different\nastronomers, but has remained in use.\n\nAccording to the definition, there are currently eight planets and five dwarf\nplanets known in the Solar System. The definition distinguishes planets from\nsmaller bodies and is not useful outside the Solar System, where smaller bodies\ncannot be found yet. Extrasolar planets, or exoplanets, are covered separately\nunder a complementary 2003 draft guideline for the definition of planets, which\ndistinguishes them from dwarf stars, which are larger.\n","linknr":695,"url":"2006_definition_of_planet","recorded":1362665470,"links":42,"instances":["dwarf_planet","planet","dwarf_planet","mythology","dwarf_planet","astronomy","moon","planetoid","dwarf_planet","mechanics"],"pdf":["http://www.gps.caltech.edu/~mbrown/papers/ps/basribrown.pdf","http://www.gps.caltech.edu/~mbrown/papers/ps/basribrown.pdf","http://astro.cas.cz/nuncius/nsiii_09.pdf","http://www.iau.org/static/resolutions/Resolution_GA26-5-6.pdf","http://www.iau.org/static/resolutions/Resolution_GA26-5-6.pdf","http://www.americandialect.org/Word-of-the-Year_2006.pdf","http://www.americandialect.org/Word-of-the-Year_2006.pdf"],"categories":["2006
