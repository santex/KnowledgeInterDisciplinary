The audio\nlayer is most commonly provided by the music-oriented Vorbis format but other\noptions include the human speech compression codec Speex, the lossless audio\ncompression codec FLAC, and OggPCM.\n\nBefore 2007, the .ogg filename extension was used for all files whose content\nused the Ogg container format. Since 2007, the Xiph.Org Foundation recommends\nthat .ogg only be used for Ogg Vorbis audio files. The Xiph.Org Foundation\ndecided to create a new set of file extensions and media types to describe\ndifferent types of content such as .oga for audio only files, .ogv for video\nwith or without sound (including Theora), and .ogx for multiplexed\nOgg. {{cite web |url =\nhttp://wiki.xiph.org/index.php/MIME_Types_and_File_Extensions |title = MIME\nTypes and File Extensions |work = XiphWiki |date = 2007-09-07 |accessdate = 2007-09-\n10 }}\n\nAs of August 4, 2011, the current version of the Xiph.Org Foundation's reference\nimplementation, is libogg 1.3.0. Another version,\nlibogg2, has been in development, but is awaiting a rewrite as of\n2008. Both software libraries are free software, released under the\nnew BSD license. Ogg reference implementation was separated from Vorbis on\nSeptember 2, 2000. Xiph.Org (2002-07-19)\n[http://downloads.xiph.org/releases/ogg/ Ogg releases - libogg-1.0.tar.gz -\nCHANGES].
