The WLNK callsign\npredates its previous owner and thus, similarities to the name \"Lincoln\" are\ncoincidental. On November 12, 2007, as Lincoln Financial began to liquidate its\nbroadcasting assets, Greater Media announced plans to acquire WLNK, along with\nsister stations WBT and WBT-FM, for $100\nmillion, http://www.greatermedia.com/press/detail.php?ID=279, retrieved on\n2008/05/15. a deal which was finalized on January 31, 2008.\n","linknr":397,"url":"WLNK","recorded":1362485301,"links":14,"instances":["am","christianity","radio","band"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Adult contemporary radio stations in the United States","Radio stations in North Carolina|LNK","Greater Media stations|LNK","Radio stations in the Charlotte metropolitan area|LNK","Radio stations established in 1961"],"headings":["History","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8c/Link-Logo-Color.png/111px-Link-Logo-Color.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["chicago","band"],["chris_jones","radio"],["born_again","christianity"],["wbt","am"]],"members":["wbt","born_again","chris_jones","chicago"],"related":["Charlotte,_North_Carolina","Charlotte,_North_Carolina","Charlotte_metropolitan_area","Megahertz","1961_in_radio","Modern_Adult_Contemporary","Watt","Greater_Media","Charlotte,_North_Carolina","MHz","Charlotte_metropolitan_area","Hot_Adult_Contemporary","Philadelphia","Lincoln_Financial_Group","Greater_Media","Stereo","Classical_music","Beautiful_music","Chicago_(band)","Peter_Frampton","The_Rolling_Stones","Carly_Simon","Billy_Joel","Eddie_Money","John_Lambis","Chris_Jones_(radio)","Becky_Kent","Fred_Story","Adult_top_40","Adult_contemporary","John_Boy","John_Boy","Born_again_(Christianity)","The_Bob_and_Sheri_Show","WBT_(AM)","WBTV","Randy_and_Spiff","Randy_and_Spiff","John_Boy_and_Billy","Randy_and_Spiff","WSRV","Atlanta,_Georgia","Adult_contemporary","The_Bob_and_Sheri_Show","Top_40","Chester,_South_Carolina","Modern_adult_contemporary","Pam_Stone","Lifestyle_talk_radio","Kelly_McKay","Bob_and_Sheri","Dial_Global","2010_in_radio","Hot_Adult_Contemporary","Mediabase"]}
