DNA methylation serves a wide\nvariety of biological functions. All the known DNA methyltransferases use S-\nadenosyl methionine (SAM) as the methyl donor.\n","linknr":668,"url":"DNA_methyltransferase","recorded":1362560038,"links":24,"instances":["biochemistry","biochemistry","biology","molecular","genetics","chemistry","molecular_biology","genetics","chemistry"],"pdf":["http://www.activemotif.com/documents/tds/39206.pdf"],"categories":["EC 2.1.1"],"headings":["Classification","Mammalian DNA methyltransferase (DNMT)","Clinical significance","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/PDB_2ar0_EBI.jpg/220px-PDB_2ar0_EBI.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/PDB_1g55_EBI.jpg/220px-PDB_1g55_EBI.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/de/PDB_1g60_EBI.jpg/220px-PDB_1g60_EBI.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["product","chemistry"],["product","chemistry"],["sequence","biology"],["binding","molecular"],["cofactor","biochemistry"],["substrate","biochemistry"],["conservation","genetics"],["residue","chemistry"],["complementarity","molecular_biology"],["sequence","biology"],["cofactor","biochemistry"],["transcription","genetics"]],"members":["cofactor","substrate","sequence","binding","transcription","residue","complementarity","conservation","product"],"related":["Biochemistry","Enzyme","Catalysis","Methyl_group","DNA","DNA_methylation","S-adenosyl_methionine","N6-methyladenine","N4-methylcytosine","C5-methylcytosine","Enzymes","Adenine","Bacteria","Restriction_modification_system","Product_(chemistry)","Product_(chemistry)","Enzyme","Methylation","Sequence_(biology)","Genome","Restriction_enzyme","Sequence","Conserved_sequence","Protein_motif","Aspartic_acid","Asparagine","Proline","Tyrosine","Phenylalanine","Conserved_sequence","Enzyme_substrate","Binding_(molecular)","Catalytic","Secondary_structure","Angstrom","Molecule","Protein_folding","Catalysis","Cofactor_(biochemistry)","Beta-sheet","Alpha_helix","Protein_domain","Substrate_(biochemistry)","Conservation_(genetics)","Sequence_motif","Polypeptides","Protein_subunit","Methyltransferase","Methylation","Adenine","Residue_(chemistry)","Complementarity_(molecular_biology)","Recognition_sequence","Protein_complex","Endonuclease","Nucleotide_sequence","Peptide_sequence","Methylation","Alpha-helical","Protein_domain","N-terminus","Enzyme","Cytosine","Enzymes","Prokaryotes","Sequence_(biology)","Cytosine","Sequence","Bond_cleavage","Nucleotide_sequence","Carbon","Cytosine","C5-methylcytosine","Mammalia","Methyltransferase","CpG","Gene_expression","Cell_differentiation","Bacteria","Enzymes","Secondary_structure","Angstrom","Protein_domain","Catalytic","Cofactor_(biochemistry)","DNMT1","DNMT3A","DNMT3B","DNMT3L","Mammal","Methylation","CpG","Enzyme","Amino_acid","Glycine","Lysine","Isoform","Oocyte","Cytoplasm","Cell_nucleus","Embryo","Somatic","Embryonic_stem_cell","Aspartic_acid","DNA","CpG","Heterochromatin","CpG","Methylation","CpG","Sequence_motif","Genomic_imprinting","Catalytic","Gametogenesis","Genomic_imprinting","Allele","Methylation","Transcription_(genetics)","DNMT_inhibitor","Vidaza","Acute_myeloid_leukemia","Dacogen","Decitabine","Chronic_myelogenous_leukemia","Methyltransferase","DNA_methylation","PRMT4_pathway"]}
