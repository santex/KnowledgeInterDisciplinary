Although written in the form of\nproposition, an equation is not a statement, but a problem consisting in finding\nthe values, called 'solutions', that, when substituted to the unknowns, yields\nequal values of expressions A and B. For example, 2 is the unique solution of\nthe equation x&nbsp;+&nbsp;2&nbsp;=&nbsp;4, in which the unknown is\nx.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/equation title = Equation work =\n| Dictionary.com publisher = Dictionary.com, LLC accessdate = 2009-11-24\n}}</ref> Historically, equations arose from the mathematical discipline of\nalgebra, but later become ubiquitous. An equality may not be confused with\nidentities which are presented with the same notation but have a different\nsemantic: for example 2&nbsp;+&nbsp;2&nbsp;=&nbsp;4 and\nx&nbsp;+&nbsp;y&nbsp;=&nbsp;y&nbsp;+&nbsp;x are identities (which implies they\nare necessarily true) in arithmetic, and do not constitute any values-finding\nproblem, even if include variables.\n\n'Equation' may also refer to a relation between some variables that is expressed\nby the equality of some expressions of their values. For example the equation of\nthe unit circle is x<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;y<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;1, which\nmeans that a point belongs to the circle if and only if its coordinates are\nrelated by this equation. Most physical laws are expressed by equations. One of\nthe most popular ones is Einstein's equation ''E'' = ''mc''<sup>2</sup>.\n\nThe = symbol was invented by Robert Recorde (1510–1558), who considered that\nnothing could be more equal than parallel straight lines with the same length.\n\nCenturies ago, the word \"equation\" frequently meant what we now usually call\n\"correction\" or \"adjustment\". This meaning is still occasionally found,\nespecially in names which were originally given long ago. The \"equation of\ntime\", for example, is a correction that must be applied to the reading of a\nsundial in order to obtain mean time, as would be shown by a clock.\n","title":"Equation","headings":["Parameters and unknowns","Analogous illustration","Types of equations","Identities","Properties","See also","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["2: Algebra","2: Quadratic_equation","2: Functional_equation","2: Derivative","2: Antiderivative","1: Mathematics","1: Mathematical_formula","1: Binary_relation","1: Necessarily_true","1: Arithmetic","1: Unit_circle","1: Coordinates","1: Physical_law","1: Albert_Einstein","1: Massâenergy_equivalence","1: Robert_Recorde","1: Equation_of_time","1: Local_mean_time","1: Equation_solving","1: System_of_equations","1: Weighing_scale","1: Seesaw","1: Real_numbers","1: Algebraic_equation","1: Polynomial","1: System_of_polynomial_equations","1: Degree_of_a_polynomial","1: Linear_equation","1: Cubic_equation","1: Quartic_equation","1: Quintic_equation","1: Diophantine_equation","1: Integer","1: Transcendental_equation","1: Transcendental_function","1: Parametric_equation","1: Parameter","1: Differential_equation","1: Integral_equation","1: Integro-differential_equation","1: Difference_equation","1: Recurrence_relation","1: Trigonometry","1: Addition","1: Subtraction","1: Multiplication","1: Polynomial_expansion","1: Factorization_of_polynomials","1: Extraneous_solution","1: Gaussian_elimination","1: Formula","1: Formula_editor","1: History_of_algebra","1: Inequation","1: List_of_equations","1: List_of_scientific_equations_named_after_people","1: Theory_of_equations"]}
