{"cursor":"5122","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The 'George J. Mitchell Scholarship' is a scholarship given annually by the US-\nIreland Alliance to twelve Americans aged 18â30 to fund one year of graduate\nstudy in Ireland. Unlike in the United States, in Ireland one year is usually\nenough to complete a master's degree. Although the first class of scholars only\nbegan their studies in 2000, the Mitchell Scholarship has established itself as\none of the most selective fellowships in the United States, alongside\nthe much older Rhodes Scholarship and Marshall Scholarship. Approximately 300\npeople apply each year for the 12 scholarships.\n\nThe Mitchell Scholars Program, named to honor former US Senator George J.\nMitchell's pivotal contribution to the Northern Ireland peace process, is\ndesigned to introduce and connect generations of future American leaders to the\nisland of Ireland, while recognizing and fostering intellectual achievement,\nleadership, and a commitment to community and public service. Alumni\nof the Mitchell Scholarship program pursue careers in consulting, law, academia,\npolitics, and journalism. Alumni include Matt Haney, a member of the San\nFrancisco Board of Education, and Jimmy Soni, who serves as managing editor of\nthe Huffington Post.\n\nA Mitchell Scholarship award includes tuition, housing, airfare, a cash stipend,\nand other benefits such as a travel bursary to encourage travel both in and\noutside of Ireland and Northern Ireland. In recent years, Mitchell Scholars have\nused their travel bursary to explore countries as diverse as Oman, Cambodia,\nSenegal and Azerbaijan.\n\nMitchell Scholars are placed at universities in both the Republic of Ireland and\nNorthern Ireland, including Trinity College, Dublin, University College Cork,\nUniversity of Limerick, National University of Ireland, Galway, National\nUniversity of Ireland, Maynooth, University College Dublin, Dublin City\nUniversity, University of Ulster and Queen's University Belfast.\n\nThe George J. Mitchell Scholarship is organized under the auspices of the US-\nIreland Alliance, a non-profit non-partisan organization based in Arlington, VA.\nThe program began in 1998, created by US-Ireland Alliance president\nTrina Vargo with early support from the Irish and British Governments. Over the\nlast decade, the program has been largely funded by the United States Department\nof State, with additional support from the Northern Ireland Government, Becton\nDickinson, and Cross Atlantic Capital Partners. In 2010, the Irish Parliament\npassed legislation whereby it will match any contributions, up to 20 million\neuros, to an endowment for the Scholarship program.\n\nIn 2012, the Department of State attempted to eliminate funding for the program\nbut with the support of several members of the United States Congress;\nuniversity presidents and professors; the public, in the form of a petition; and\nthe Irish and Northern Ireland Governments, the decision was reversed for fiscal\nyear 2013.\n","linknr":138,"url":"George_J._Mitchell_Scholarship","recorded":1375080137,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Mitchell_Scholarship&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Mitchell_Scholarship&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","/wiki/Mitchell_Scholarship","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","/w/index.php?title=George_J._Mitchell_Scholarship&redirect=no","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Scholarship","/w/index.php?title=US-Ireland_Alliance&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/Graduate_school","/wiki/Ireland","/wiki/Master%27s_degree","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Rhodes_Scholarship","/wiki/Marshall_Scholarship","#cite_note-2","/wiki/George_J._Mitchell","#cite_note-3","/wiki/San_Francisco_Board_of_Education","/wiki/Jimmy_Soni","/wiki/Huffington_Post","/wiki/Bursary","/wiki/Oman","/wiki/Cambodia","/wiki/Senegal","/wiki/Azerbaijan","/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland","/wiki/Northern_Ireland","/wiki/Trinity_College,_Dublin","/wiki/University_College_Cork_-_National_University_of_Ireland,_Cork","/wiki/University_of_Limerick","/wiki/National_University_of_Ireland,_Galway","/wiki/National_University_of_Ireland,_Maynooth","/wiki/University_College_Dublin_-_National_University_of_Ireland,_Dublin","/wiki/Dublin_City_University","/wiki/University_of_Ulster","/wiki/Queen%27s_University_of_Belfast","#cite_note-4","/wiki/Trina_Vargo","/wiki/United_States_Department_of_State","/wiki/Northern_Ireland_Government","/wiki/Becton_Dickinson","/w/index.php?title=Cross_Atlantic_Capital_Partners&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Oireachtas","#cite_note-5","/wiki/United_States_Congress","#cite_note-6","/w/index.php?title=Mitchell_Scholarship&action=edit&section=1","http://www.us-irelandalliance.org/content/3/en/George%20Mitchell%20Scholarship%20Program%20%7C%20US-Ireland%20Alliance.html","/w/index.php?title=Mitchell_Scholarship&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-1","http://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/12/education/other-roads.html","#cite_ref-2","http://www.us-irelandalliance.org/content/393/en/Scholarships/Program%20News/Class%20of%202014%20Mitchell%20Scholars%20selected.html","#cite_ref-3","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Special:BookSources/978-1442211094","#cite_ref-4","http://www.us-irelandalliance.org/content/94/en/Leadership/Opinions/Trina%20Vargo%20On%20The%20Creation%20Of%20The%20US-Ireland%20Alliance%20(Washington%20Post).html","#cite_ref-5","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Special:BookSources/978-1442211094","#cite_ref-6","http://www.forbes.com/sites/susanadams/2012/11/19/scholarship-program-for-future-leaders-gets-new-lease-on-life/","/wiki/File:Irish_clover.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0c/Irish_clover.jpg/25px-Irish_clover.jpg","/wiki/Ireland","/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mitchell_Scholarship&action=edit","/wiki/Template:Ireland-stub","/wiki/Template_talk:Ireland-stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Ireland-stub&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mitchell_Scholarship&oldid=534419264","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Awards_established_in_2001","/wiki/Category:Scholarships_in_the_United_States","/wiki/Category:Ireland_stubs","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Mitchell+Scholarship&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Mitchell+Scholarship","/wiki/Mitchell_Scholarship","/wiki/Talk:Mitchell_Scholarship","#","/wiki/Mitchell_Scholarship","/w/index.php?title=Mitchell_Scholarship&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Mitchell_Scholarship&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Mitchell_Scholarship","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Mitchell_Schol
