{"cursor":"46673","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"{{multiple issues|\n\n\n}} In medicine, 'compliance' (also 'adherence' or 'capacitance') describes the\ndegree to which a patient correctly follows medical advice. Most commonly, it\nrefers to medication or drug compliance, but it can also apply to other\nsituations such as medical device use, self care, self-directed exercises, or\ntherapy sessions. Both the patient and the health-care provider affect\ncompliance, and a positive physician-patient relationship is the most important\nfactor in improving compliance, although the high cost\nof prescription medication also plays a major role.\n\nCompliance is commonly confused with concordance. Concordance is the process by\nwhich a patient and clinician make decisions together about\ntreatment.\n\nWorldwide, non-compliance is a major obstacle to the effective delivery of\nhealth care. Estimates from the World Health Organization (2003) indicate that\nonly about 50% of patients with chronic diseases living in developed countries\nfollow treatment recommendations. In particular, low\nrates of adherence to therapies for asthma, diabetes, and hypertension are\nthought to contribute substantially to the human and economic burden of those\nconditions. Compliance rates may be overestimated in the\nmedical literature, as compliance is often high in the setting of a formal\nclinical trial but drops off in a \"real-world\" setting.\n\nMajor barriers to compliance are thought to include the complexity of modern\nmedication regimens, poor \"health literacy\" and lack of comprehension of\ntreatment benefits, the occurrence of undiscussed side effects, the cost of\nprescription medicine, and poor communication or lack of trust between the\npatient and his or her health-care provider. Efforts to improve compliance have been aimed at\nsimplifying medication packaging, providing effective medication reminders,\nimproving patient education, and limiting the number of medications prescribed\nsimultaneously.\n","linknr":609,"url":"Compliance_(medicine)","recorded":1362582370,"links":45,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.who.int/chp/knowledge/publications/adherence_full_report.pdf","http://www.who.int/chp/knowledge/publications/adherence_full_report.pdf","http://www.harrisinteractive.com/news/newsletters/healthnews/HI_HealthCareNews2001Vol1_iss32.pdf","http://www.harrisinteractive.com/news/newsletters/healthnews/HI_HealthCareNews2001Vol1_iss32.pdf","http://obssr.od.nih.gov/pdf/Workshop_final_report.pdf","http://obssr.od.nih.gov/pdf/Workshop_final_report.pdf","http://www.who.int/chp/knowledge/publications/adherence_full_report.pdf","http://www.who.int/chp/knowledge/publications/adherence_full_report.pdf","http://www.who.int/chp/knowledge/publications/adherence_full_report.pdf"],"categories":["Medical terminology","Pharmacology","Pharmacy","Healthcare quality"],"headings":["Terminology","Societal impact","Compliance issues","Health and disease management","Improving compliance rates","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/97/Impact_on_patient_compliance.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c2/Womens_health_I_O_C.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f6/Diab_I_O_C.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/77/Diab_diag_Monitoring_A_I-01.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c0/Mental_health_I_O_C.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6e/Oral_nutrition_I_O_C-01.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Self_care","World_Health_Organization","Developed_countries","Asthma","Diabetes","Hypertension","Clinical_trial","World_Health_Organization","American_Pharmacists_Association","National_Institutes_of_Health","United_Kingdom","National_Health_Service","Antibiotic_resistance","Sustained_release","WHO","Statin","Hypercholesterolaemia","Systemic_hypertension","Coronary_heart_disease","Coronary_heart_disease","Stroke","Heart_attack","National_Health_Service","National_Audit_Office","GINA_Project","Department_of_Health","Entry_Level_3","Local_education_authority","Functional_literacy","National_Service_Framework","Office_for_National_Statistics","British_Heart_Foundation","Statin","Metabolites","Breast_Cancer","Leukemia","Non_Hodgkin's_lymphoma","Urine","Hodgkin's_disease","Acute_lymphocytic_leukemia","Tamoxifen","Royal_Marsden","Sulphonylureas","Metformin","A_question_of_choice","Polypharmacy","Withdrawal","World_Health_Organization"]}
