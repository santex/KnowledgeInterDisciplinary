It is one of the seven\nbase units in the International System of Units (SI) and is assigned the unit\nsymbol 'K'. The 'Kelvin scale' is an absolute, thermodynamic temperature scale\nusing as its null point absolute zero, the temperature at which all thermal\nmotion ceases in the classical description of thermodynamics. The kelvin is\ndefined as the fraction of the thermodynamic temperature of the triple point of\nwater (exactly 0.01 Â°C or 32.018 Â°F).\n\nThe Kelvin scale is named after the Belfast-born, Glasgow University engineer\nand physicist William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin (1824â1907), who wrote of the\nneed for an \"absolute thermometric scale\". Unlike the degree Fahrenheit and\ndegree Celsius, the kelvin is not referred to or typeset as a degree. The kelvin\nis the primary unit of measurement in the physical sciences, but is often used\nin conjunction with the degree Celsius, which has the same magnitude.\nSubtracting 273.16 K from the temperature of the triple point of water\n(0.01 Â°C) makes absolute zero (0 K) equivalent to .\n","linknr":410,"url":"Kelvin","recorded":1362504986,"links":124,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/pdf/sp811.pdf","http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/pdf/sp811.pdf","http://www.bipm.org/utils/en/pdf/si_brochure_draft_ch2.pdf","http://www.bipm.org/utils/en/pdf/si_brochure_draft_ch2.pdf","http://www.bipm.org/utils/common/pdf/si_brochure_8_en.pdf","http://www.bipm.org/utils/common/pdf/si_brochure_8_en.pdf"],"categories":["Scottish inventions","SI base units","Units of temperature"],"headings":["History","Usage conventions","Proposed redefinition","Practical uses","Temperature conversion between units","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a0/Lord_Kelvin_photograph.jpg/250px-Lord_Kelvin_photograph.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/timeline/63010677956f0109c4b8a12a5c863cb2.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/timeline/4a1bc9d993390bb02b954f391d486109.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/timeline/679a3f079df98e13aa9b9998d666f74d.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/timeline/ff07074aa057e2d611835ea2573f8977.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/timeline/b4202afeab2685128448a478eb6159e1.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/timeline/c7f769257e42d9377cef3ebefe6c4e4a.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/timeline/ade5a2d897e1d47e3c70556a1ea7e61a.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/timeline/e0be2e083efe2751ea8c5b29b2cce215.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c8/SI_base_unit.svg/75px-SI_base_unit.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Symbol_book_class2.svg/16px-Symbol_book_class2.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Units_of_measurement","Temperature","SI_base_unit","International_System_of_Units","Thermodynamic_temperature","Scale_of_temperature","Absolute_zero","Thermodynamics","Triple_point","Glasgow_University","William_Thomson,_1st_Baron_Kelvin","Degree_Fahrenheit","Degree_Celsius","Triple_point_of_water","William_Thomson,_1st_Baron_Kelvin","General_Conference_on_Weights_and_Measures_","Triple_point_of_water","Triple_point_of_water","International_Committee_for_Weights_and_Measures","Volt","Ohm","Adjective","General_Conference_on_Weights_and_Measures","Rankine_scale","Unicode","Unicode_compatibility_characters","Fullwidth","CIPM","CGPM","New_SI_definitions","Boltzmann's_constant","SI","Colour_temperature","Black_body","Photography","Astronomy","Stellar_classification","Hertzsprung–Russell_diagram","Effective_temperature","Sun","Electronic_noise","Noise_floor","Noise_temperature","Johnson–Nyquist_noise","Boltzmann_constant","Friis_formulas_for_noise","Comparison_of_temperature_scales","International_Temperature_Scale_of_1990","Negative_temperature","Rankine_scale","Thermodynamic_temperature","Triple_point"]}
