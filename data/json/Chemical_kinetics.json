Chemical kinetics includes investigations of how different\nexperimental conditions can influence the speed of a chemical reaction and yield\ninformation about the reaction's mechanism and transition states, as well as the\nconstruction of mathematical models that can describe the characteristics of a\nchemical reaction. In 1864, Peter Waage and Cato Guldberg pioneered the\ndevelopment of chemical kinetics by formulating the law of mass action, which\nstates that the speed of a chemical reaction is proportional to the quantity of\nthe reacting substances.\n\nChemical kinetics deals with the experimental determination of reaction rates\nfrom which rate laws and rate constants are derived. Relatively simple rate laws\nexist for zero-order reactions (for which reaction rates are independent of\nconcentration), first-order reactions, and second-order reactions, and can be\nderived for others. In consecutive reactions, the rate-determining step often\ndetermines the kinetics. In consecutive first-order reactions, a steady state\napproximation can simplify the rate law. The activation energy for a reaction is\nexperimentally determined through the Arrhenius equation and the Eyring\nequation. The main factors that influence the reaction rate include: the\nphysical state of the reactants, the concentrations of the reactants, the\ntemperature at which the reaction occurs, and whether or not any catalysts are\npresent in the reaction.\n","linknr":384,"url":"Chemical_kinetics","recorded":1362509646,"links":55,"instances":["matter","chemistry","temperature_coefficient","chemistry","chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Chemical kinetics|"],"headings":["Factors affecting reaction rate","Equilibrium","Free energy","Applications","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/41/Molecular-collisions.jpg/300px-Molecular-collisions.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/24/Activation_energy.svg/220px-Activation_energy.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/PlatformHolly.jpg/170px-PlatformHolly.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["steady_state","chemistry"],["phase","matter"],["q10","temperature_coefficient"],["activity","chemistry"],["product","chemistry"]],"members":["phase","product","q10","activity","steady_state"],"related":["Concentration","Collision_theory","Reaction_rate","Reaction_mechanism","Transition_state","Peter_Waage","Cato_Guldberg","Law_of_mass_action","Reaction_rate","Rate_law","Reaction_rate_constant","Rate_law","First-order_reaction","Second-order_reaction","Rate-determining_step","Steady_state_(chemistry)","Rate_law","Activation_energy","Arrhenius_equation","Eyring_equation","Reaction_rate","Physical_state","Concentrations","Temperature","Catalysts","Salts","Ion_exchange","Physical_state","Solid","Liquid","Gas","Phase_(matter)","Aqueous","Solution","Surface_area","Volume","On_water_reaction","Concentration","Combustion","Temperature","Thermal_energy","Activation_energy","Maxwell&ndash;Boltzmann_distribution","Q10_(temperature_coefficient)","Temperature_jump","Relaxation_time","Catalyst","Chemically","Reaction_mechanism","Activation_energy","Autocatalysis","Positive_feedback","Enzyme","Michaelis–Menten_kinetics","Enzyme_kinetics","Neighbouring_group_participation","Activity_(chemistry)","Pressure_jump","Relaxation_time","Thermodynamics","Reversible_reaction","Reactant","Product_(chemistry)","Haber&ndash;Bosch_process","Chemical_clock","Belousov&ndash;Zhabotinsky_reaction","Thermodynamic_free_energy","Exothermic","Entropy","Kinetic_reaction_control","Curtin&ndash;Hammett_principle","Free-energy_relationship","Kinetic_isotope_effect","Isotope","Residence_time","Heat_transfer","Chemical_reactor","Chemical_engineering","Molar_mass_distribution","Polymer_chemistry","Catalytic_cracking","Arrhenius_equation","Autocatalytic_reactions_and_order_creation","Collision_theory","Detonation","Enthalpy","Flame_speed","Reaction_progress_kinetic_analysis","Two-dimensional_gas","PottersWheel"]}
