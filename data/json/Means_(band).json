The band was formed in 2001 under the name of Means 2 An End as a\n3-piece by main-songwriter/lyricist Matt Goud. They were originally from the\nsmall city of Dauphin, Manitoba. In 2003, they relocated to Regina, SK. They\neventually integrated more and more elements of hardcore into their sound and\ndropped \"2 An End\" from their name. After many years of touring, the band began\nto accumulate a large fanbase. It was around this time, in 2005, that original\nbassist Blair Roberts quit to pursue a family. He was replaced by Dylan\nJohnstone(formerly of Yorkton, SK hardcore group Statement of Service). They\nremained a 3-piece until mid 2006 when Todd joined so Dylan could switch to lead\nvocals. This era of the band saw them switch to a mainly Metalcore sound\ninspired by Shai Hulud and Misery Signals.The group toured in the US and Canada\nconstantly, and was featured in the June 2007 issue of Alternative Press\nmagazine as well as multiple other publications. Their 2007 album, Sending You\nStrength, was released in the US on Facedown\nRecords. [http://www.geekburger.com/review/means/strength.asp Review of\nSending You Strength]. Geekburger.
