{"cursor":"2778","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'dihydrofolate reductase inhibitor' is a molecule that inhibits the function\nof dihydrofolate reductase, and is a type of antifolate.\n\nSince folate is needed by rapidly dividing cells to make thymine, this effect\nmay be used to therapeutic advantage. For example, methotrexate is used as\ncancer chemotherapy because it can prevent neoplastic cells from dividing. Bacteria also need DHFR\nto grow and multiply and hence inhibitors selective for bacterial vs. host DHFR\nhave found application as antibacterial agents.\n\n\n\nA variety of drugs act as inhibitors of dihydrofolate reductase:\n* the antibiotic trimethoprim and its derivatives brodimoprim, tetroxoprim,\n  and iclaprim.\n* the antimalarial drugs pyrimethamine and proguanil.\n* the experimental new antimalarial drug JPC-2056, which may also be more\n  effective and better tolerated than current treatments against\n  toxoplasmosis.\n* the chemotherapeutic agents methotrexate and pemetrexed. Methotrexate acts on\n  this enzyme binding to it some 1000 times more tightly than folate itself.\n","linknr":636,"url":"Dihydrofolate_reductase_inhibitor","recorded":1362511127,"links":21,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Dihydrofolate reductase inhibitors|*"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e9/THFsynthesispathway.png/400px-THFsynthesispathway.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/Amoxicillin-3D-vdW.png/50px-Amoxicillin-3D-vdW.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/Cisplatin-3D-vdW.png/40px-Cisplatin-3D-vdW.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Dihydrofolate_reductase","Antifolate","Thymine","Methotrexate","Neoplastic","Enzyme_inhibitor","Antibiotic","Trimethoprim","Brodimoprim","Tetroxoprim","Iclaprim","Antimalarial","Pyrimethamine","Proguanil","Antimalarial","JPC-2056","Toxoplasmosis","Chemotherapy","Methotrexate","Pemetrexed","Folic_acid"]}
