The precise meaning of\n\"structure-preserving\" depends on the kind of mathematical structure of which X\nand Y are instances. In the terminology of category theory, a structure-\npreserving map is called a morphism.\n\nThe fact that a map is an embedding is often indicated by the use of a \"hooked\narrow\", thus: <math> f : X \\hookrightarrow Y.</math> On the other hand, this\nnotation is sometimes reserved for inclusion maps.\n\nGiven X and Y, several different embeddings of X in Y may be possible. In many\ncases of interest there is a standard (or \"canonical\") embedding, like those of\nthe natural numbers in the integers, the integers in the rational numbers, the\nrational numbers in the real numbers, and the real numbers in the complex\nnumbers. In such cases it is common to identify the domain X with its image f(X)\ncontained in Y, so that then .\n","title":"embedding","headings":["Topology and geometry","Algebra","Order theory and domain theory","Metric spaces","Category theory","See also","Notes","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["4: Injective","2: Category_theory","2: Homeomorphism","2: Topological_subspace","2: Submanifold","2: Monomorphism","1: Mathematics","1: Mathematical_structure","1: Subgroup","1: Morphism","1: Inclusion_map","1: Natural_number","1: Integer","1: Rational_number","1: Real_number","1: Complex_number","1: General_topology","1: Topological_space","1: Open_map","1: Closed_map","1: Open_set","1: Closed_set","1: Topological_invariant","1: Differential_topology","1: Manifold","1: Diffeomorphism","1: Whitney_embedding_theorem","1: Real_projective_plane","1: Boy's_surface","1: Roman_surface","1: Cross-cap","1: List_of_mathematical_abbreviations","1: Topological_manifold#Manifolds_with_boundary","1: Riemannian_geometry","1: Riemannian_manifold","1: Riemannian_metric","1: Curve","1: Nash_embedding_theorem","1: Ring_homomorphism","1: Isomorphic","1: Universal_algebra","1: Model_theory","1: Iff","1: Elementary_embedding","1: Order_theory","1: Partial_order","1: Domain_theory","1: Directed_set","1: Metric_spaces","1: Normed_spaces","1: Normed_space","1: Dvoretzky's_theorem","1: Subobject","1: Small_class","1: Ordered_set","1: Closure_operator","1: Concrete_category","1: Injective_function","1: Factorization_system","1: Subcategory#Embeddings","1: Closed_immersion","1: Johnsonâ€“Lindenstrauss_lemma","1: Dimension_reduction"]}
