{"cursor":"12371","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Mortality rate' is a measure of the number of deaths (in general, or due to a\nspecific cause) in a population. Scaled to the size of that population, per unit\nof time. Mortality rate is typically expressed in units of deaths per 1000\nindividuals per year; thus, a mortality rate of 9.5 (out of 1000) in a\npopulation of 1,000 would mean 9.5 deaths per year in that entire population, or\n0.95% out of the total. It is distinct from morbidity rate, which refers to the\nnumber of individuals in poor health during a given time period (the prevalence\nrate) or the number of newly appearing cases of the disease per unit of time\n(incidence rate). The term \"mortality\" is also sometimes inappropriately used to\nrefer to the number of deaths among a set of diagnosed hospital cases for a\ndisease or injury, rather than for the general population of a country or ethnic\ngroup. This disease mortality statistic is more precisely referred to as \"case\nfatality rate\" (CFR).\n\nOne distinguishes:\n# The 'crude death rate', the total number of deaths per year per 1000 people.\n# the crude death rate for the whole world is about 8.37 per 1000 per year\n# according to the current CIA World Factbook. [https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-\n# factbook/rankorder/2066rank.html CIA World Factbook -- Rank Order - Death\n# rate] Search for \"World\".\n\n# The '[[perinatal mortality]] rate', the sum of neonatal deaths and fetal\n# deaths (stillbirths) per 1000 births. The '[[maternal mortality]] ratio', the\n# number of maternal deaths per 100,000 live births in same time period. The\n# '[[maternal mortality]] rate', the number of maternal deaths per 1,000 women\n# of reproductive age in the population (generally defined as 15â44 years of\n# age) . The '[[infant mortality]] rate', the number of deaths of children less\n# than 1 year old per 1000 live births. The '[[child mortality]] rate', the\n# number of deaths of children less than 5 years old per 1000 live births. The\n# '[[standardised mortality ratio]]' (SMR)- This represents a proportional\n# comparison to the numbers of deaths that would have been expected if the\n# population had been of a standard composition in terms of age, gender,\n# etc. Everitt, B.S. The Cambridge Dictionary of Statistics, CUP. ISBN 0-521-81099-\n# X The '[[age-specific mortality rate]]' (ASMR) - This refers to the\n# total number of deaths per year per 1000 people of a given age (e.g. age 62\n# last birthday).\n\nIn regard to the or failure of medical treatment or procedures, one would also\ndistinguish:\n\n# The 'early mortality rate', the total number of deaths in the early stages of\n# an ongoing treatment, or in the period immediately following an treatment. The\n# 'late mortality rate', the total number of deaths in the late stages of an\n# ongoing treatment, or a significant length of time after an acute treatment.\n\nNote that the crude death rate as defined above and applied to a whole\npopulation can give a misleading impression. The crude death rate depends on the\nage (and gender) specific mortality rates and the age (and gender) distribution\nof the population. The number of deaths per 1000 people can be higher for\ndeveloped nations than in less-developed countries, despite life expectancy\nbeing higher in developed countries due to standards of health being better.\nThis happens because developed countries typically have a completely different\npopulation age distribution, with a much higher proportion of older people, due\nto both lower recent birth rates and lower mortality rates. A more complete\npicture of mortality is given by a life table which shows the mortality rate\nseparately for each age. A life table is necessary to give a good estimate of\nlife expectancy.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Death_rate","recorded":1372152298,"links":[],"instances":["disease"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Population","Demography","Epidemiology","Death","Actuarial science","Population ecology","Medical statistics"],"headings":["Statistics","Use in Health Care","See also","References","Other Sources","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["plague","disease"]],"members":["plague"],"related":["Death","Morbidity_rate","Prevalence_rate","Incidence_rate","Death","Case_fatality_rate","Failure","Medicine","Surgery","Birth_rate","Life_table","Life_expectancy","CIA_World_Factbook","List_of_countries_by_death_rate","World_Health_Organization","Ischaemic_heart_disease","Cerebrovascular_disease","Lower_respiratory_infections","HIV/AIDS","Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease","Diarrhoeal_diseases","Tuberculosis","Trachea_cancer","Bronchus_cancer","Lung_cancer","Malaria","Road_traffic_accidents","List_of_causes_of_death_by_rate","Jean_Ziegler","United_Nations","Malnutrition","Micronutrients","Jean_Ziegler","Plague_(disease)","Epidemics","Global_health","Biodemography","Birth_rate","Case_fatality","Compensation_law_of_mortality","Death","Demography","Gompertz-Makeham_law_of_mortality","Life_expectancy","List_of_causes_of_death_by_rate","List_of_countries_by_death_rate","Maximum_life_span","Micromort","Morbidity","Mortality_displacement","Risk_adjusted_mortality_rate","Vital_Statistics","United_Nations","US_Centers_for_Disease_Control"]}
