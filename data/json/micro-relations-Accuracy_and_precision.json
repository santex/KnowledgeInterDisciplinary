{"cursor":"17760","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\nIn the fields of science, engineering, industry, and statistics, the\n'accuracy' [http://www.bipm.org/utils/common/documents-\n/jcgm/JCGM_200_2008.pdf JCGM 200:2008 International vocabulary of metrology] â\nBasic and general concepts and associated terms (VIM) of a [[measurement]]\nsystem is the degree of closeness of measurements of a [[quantity]] to that\nquantity's actual (true) [[value (mathematics)|value]]. The'precision''' of a measurement system, also called reproducibility or\nrepeatability, is the degree to which repeated measurements under unchanged\nconditions show the same results. Although the two words\nreproducibility and repeatability can be synonymous in colloquial use, they are\ndeliberately contrasted in the context of the scientific method.\n\nA measurement system can be accurate but not precise, precise but not accurate,\nneither, or both. For example, if an experiment contains a systematic error,\nthen increasing the sample size generally increases precision but does not\nimprove accuracy. The result would be a consistent yet inaccurate string of\nresults from the flawed experiment. Eliminating the systematic error improves\naccuracy but does not change precision.\n\nA measurement system is designated valid if it is both accurate and precise.\nRelated terms include bias (non-random or directed effects caused by a factor or\nfactors unrelated to the independent variable) and error (random variability).\n\nThe terminology is also applied to indirect measurementsâthat is, values\nobtained by a computational procedure from observed data.\n\nIn addition to accuracy and precision, measurements may also have a measurement\nresolution, which is the smallest change in the underlying physical quantity\nthat produces a response in the measurement.\n\nIn the case of full reproducibility, such as when rounding a number to a\nrepresentable floating point number, the word precision has a meaning not\nrelated to reproducibility. For example, in the IEEE 754-2008 standard it means\nthe number of bits in the significand, so it is used as a measure for the\nrelative accuracy with which an arbitrary number can be represented.\n","linknr":295,"url":"Accuracy_and_precision","recorded":1362897536,"links":45,"instances":["statistics","statistics","information_retrieval","tests","target","tests","statistics","weapon","statistics"],"pdf":["http://www.bipm.org/utils/common/documents/jcgm/JCGM_200_2008.pdf","http://www.icpr2010.org/pdfs/icpr2010_WeBCT8.62.pdf","http://www.bioinfo.in/uploadfiles/13031311552_1_1_JMLT.pdf","http://www.bioinfo.in/uploadfiles/13031311552_1_1_JMLT.pdf","http://img.en25.com/Web/Vaisala/NIST-article.pdf"],"categories":["Biostatistics","Statistical theory","Psychometrics","Evaluation","Critical thinking","Qualities of thought","Uncertainty of numbers","Measurement","Summary statistics for contingency tables"],"headings":["Accuracy versus precision: the target analogy","Quantification","In binary classification","In psychometrics and psychophysics","In logic simulation","In information systems","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/Mergefrom.svg/50px-Mergefrom.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/Accuracy_and_precision.svg/300px-Accuracy_and_precision.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/10/High_accuracy_Low_precision.svg/100px-High_accuracy_Low_precision.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3a/High_precision_Low_accuracy.svg/100px-High_precision_Low_accuracy.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/5/f/85fb106488e3cb8c02e397c917222ad4.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/5/c/05c24c4d7ffa993d678081d8243d9ac8.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/5/7/05796b84fc84aeeb8260a838ceac684f.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/2/0/e200da5e436cda83a8cab14fcb3a275d.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/c/d/7cdf4b6c2980d6b6d09d7f5a46a95de2.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/2/7/b/27bf7aacdb946726d9c17e34b6838458.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["arrow","weapon"],["bullseye","target"],["standard_error","statistics"],["sensitivity","tests"],["specificity","tests"],["validity","statistics"],["reliability","statistics"],["precision","statistics"],["gain","information_retrieval"]],"members":["reliability","standard_error","gain","specificity","bullseye","sensitivity","validity","arrow","precision"],"related":["Science","Engineering","Industry","Statistics","Reproducibility","Repeatability","Result","Reproducibility","Repeatability","Synonymous","Colloquial","Scientific_method","Experiment","Systematic_error","Sample_size","Random","Independent_variable","Floating_point","IEEE_floating_point","Significand","Analogy","Arrow_(weapon)","Bullseye_(target)","Circular_error_probable","Ballistics","Traceability","Technical_standard","SI","Standards_organization","National_Institute_of_Standards_and_Technology","United_States","Standard_error_(statistics)","Central_limit_theorem","Probability_distribution","Mean","Bias_of_an_estimator","Calibration","Significant_figures","False_precision","Binary_classification","Positive_predictive_value","Negative_predictive_value","Sensitivity_(tests)","Specificity_(tests)","True_positive","True_negative","Positive_predictive_value","False_positive","Sensitivity_and_specificity","Prevalence","Accuracy_paradox","Predictive_analytics","Predictive_power","Precision_and_recall","F-measure","Cohen's_kappa","Psychometrics","Psychophysics","Validity_(statistics)","Reliability_(statistics)","Cronbach's_alpha","Logic_simulation","Electronic_circuit_simulation","Transistor","Transistor_models","Data_quality","Information_quality","Kristo_Ivanov","±","Plus-minus_sign","Accuracy_class","ANOVA_Gauge_R&R","ASTM","Engineering_tolerance","Experimental_uncertainty_analysis","Failure_assessment","Precision_bias","Precision_engineering","Precision_(statistics)","Accepted_and_experimental_value","Binary_classification","Brier_score","Confusion_matrix","Detection_theory","F-score","Gain_(information_retrieval)","Matthews_correlation_coefficient","Precision_and_recall","Receiver_operating_characteristic","Sensitivity_and_specificity","Selectivity","Sensitivity_index","Statistical_significance","Youden's_J_statistic"]}
