In other terms, a budget is\nan organizational plan stated in monetary terms.\n\nIn summary, the purpose of budgeting is to:\n\n# Provide a forecast of revenues and expenditures, that is, construct a model of\n# how our business might perform financially if certain strategies, events and\n# plans are carried out.
