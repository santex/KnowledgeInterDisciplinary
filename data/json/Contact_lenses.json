Contact\nlenses are considered medical devices and can be worn to correct vision, for\ncosmetic or therapeutic reasons. In 2004, it was estimated that 125 million\npeople (2%) use contact lenses worldwide, including 28 to 38 million in the\nUnited States. Barr, J.\n[http://www.clspectrum.com/article.aspx?article=12733 \"2004 Annual Report\"].\nContact Lens Spectrum. January, 2005. In 2010, worldwide contact lens\nmarket was estimated at $6.1 billion, while the U.S. soft lens market is\nestimated at $2.1 billion. Nichols, Jason J., et al\n[http://www.clspectrum.com/article.aspx?article=105083 \"ANNUAL REPORT: Contact\nLenses 2010\"]. January 2011. Some have estimated that the global market\nwill reach $11.7 billion by 2015. As of 2010, the average\nage of contact lens wearers globally was 31 years old and two thirds of wearers\nwere female. Morgan, Philip B., et al.\n[http://www.clspectrum.com/article.aspx?article=105084 \"International Contact\nLens Prescribing in 2010\"]. Contact Lens Spectrum. October 2011.\n\nPeople choose to wear contact lenses for many reasons. Aesthetics and cosmetics\nare often motivating factors for people who would like to avoid wearing glasses\nor would like to change the appearance of their eyes. Other people\nwear contacts for more visual reasons. When compared with spectacles, contact\nlenses typically provide better peripheral vision, and do not collect moisture\nsuch as rain, snow, condensation, or sweat. This makes them ideal for sports and\nother outdoor activities. Additionally, there are conditions such as keratoconus\nand aniseikonia that are typically corrected better by contacts than by glasses.\n","linknr":614,"url":"Contact_lenses","recorded":1362511544,"links":65,"instances":["medical","eye","medicine","anatomy","optics","optics","anatomy","inventor","medicine"],"pdf":["http://new.cms.hhs.gov/manuals/downloads/Pub06_PART_45.pdf","http://new.cms.hhs.gov/manuals/downloads/Pub06_PART_45.pdf","http://www.ftc.gov/reports/contactlens/050214contactlensrpt.pdf","http://www.1800contacts.com/ExternalRelations/docs/ECP/FairnessToContactLensConsumersAct.pdf"],"categories":["Contact
