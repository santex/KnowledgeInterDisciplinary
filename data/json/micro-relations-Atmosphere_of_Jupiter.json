{"cursor":"87992","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nThe 'atmosphere of [[Jupiter]]' is the largest planetary atmosphere in the Solar\nSystem. It is mostly made of molecular hydrogen and helium in roughly solar\nproportions; other chemical compounds are present only in small amounts and\ninclude methane, ammonia, hydrogen sulfide and water. Although water is thought\nto reside deep in the atmosphere, its directly measured concentration is very\nlow. The oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, and noble gas abundances in Jupiter's\natmosphere exceed solar values by a factor of about three.\n\nThe atmosphere of Jupiter lacks a clear lower boundary and gradually transitions\ninto the fluid interior of the planet. From lowest to\nhighest, the atmospheric layers are the troposphere, stratosphere, thermosphere\nand exosphere. Each layer has characteristic temperature gradients. The lowest layer, the troposphere, has a complicated system of\nclouds and hazes, comprising layers of ammonia, ammonium hydrosulfide and water.\nThe upper ammonia clouds visible at Jupiter's surface are organized in a dozen\nzonal bands parallel to the equator and are bounded by powerful zonal\natmospheric flows (winds) known as jets. The bands alternate in color: the dark\nbands are called belts, while light ones are called zones. Zones, which are\ncolder than belts, correspond to upwellings, while belts mark descending\nair. The zones' lighter color is believed to result from\nammonia ice; what gives the belts their darker colors is not known with\ncertainty. The origins of the banded structure and jets\nare not well understood, though two models exist. The shallow model holds that\nthey are surface phenomena overlaying a stable interior. In the deep model, the\nbands and jets are just surface manifestations of deep circulation in Jupiter's\nmantle of molecular hydrogen, which is organized in a number of cylinders.\n\nThe Jovian atmosphere shows a wide range of active phenomena, including band\ninstabilities, vortices (cyclones and anticyclones), storms and lightning. The vortices reveal themselves as large red, white or brown\nspots (ovals). The largest two spots are the Great Red Spot (GRS) and Oval BA, which is also red.\nThese two and most of the other large spots are anticyclonic. Smaller\nanticyclones tend to be white. Vortices are thought to be relatively shallow\nstructures with depths not exceeding several hundred kilometers. Located in the\nsouthern hemisphere, the GRS is the largest known vortex in the Solar System. It\ncould engulf several Earths and has existed for at least three hundred years.\nOval BA, south of GRS, is a red spot a third the size of GRS that formed in 2000\nfrom the merging of three white ovals.\n\nJupiter has powerful storms, always accompanied by lightning strikes. The storms\nare a result of moist convection in the atmosphere connected to the evaporation\nand condensation of water. They are sites of strong upward motion of the air,\nwhich leads to the formation of bright and dense clouds. The storms form mainly\nin belt regions. The lightning strikes on Jupiter are more powerful than those\non Earth. However, there are fewer of them, and the average levels of lightning\nactivity are comparable to those on Earth.\n","linknr":1481,"url":"Atmosphere_of_Jupiter","recorded":1362371885,"links":117,"instances":["spacecraft","angle","hydrodynamics","publisher","spacecraft","journal","journal","spacecraft","unit","geology","thermodynamics","physics","journal","astronomy"],"pdf":["http://www-personal.umich.edu/~atreya/Chapters/2005_JovianCloud_Multiprobes.pdf","http://www-personal.umich.edu/~atreya/Chapters/2005_JovianCloud_Multiprobes.pdf","http://www.bu.edu/csp/uv/cp-aeronomy/Bhardwaj_Gladstone_RG_2000.pdf","http://www.bu.edu/csp/uv/cp-aeronomy/Bhardwaj_Gladstone_RG_2000.pdf","http://www.eso.org/public/archives/releases/sciencepapers/eso1010/eso1010.pdf","http://www.eso.org/public/archives/releases/sciencepapers/eso1010/eso1010.pdf","http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v438/n7065/pdf/nature04208.pdf","http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v438/n7065/pdf/nature04208.pdf","http://www.lpl.arizona.edu/~showman/publications/ingersolletal-2004.pdf","http://www.lpl.arizona.edu/~showman/publications/ingersolletal-2004.pdf","http://www.britastro.org/jupiter/JBAA111_Jup98.pdf","http://www.britastro.org/jupiter/JBAA111_Jup98.pdf","http://www.britastro.org/jupiter/JBAA113-Jup9900_II-IR.pdf","http://www.britastro.org/jupiter/JBAA113-Jup9900_II-IR.pdf","http://www.britastro.org/jupiter/JBAA-118-1_GRS-paper.pdf","http://www.britastro.org/jupiter/JBAA-118-1_GRS-paper.pdf","http://www.gps.caltech.edu/~ulyana/www_papers/west_Ch5_us.pdf","http://www.gps.caltech.edu/~ulyana/www_papers/west_Ch5_us.pdf","http://www.lpl.arizona.edu/~yelle/eprints/Yelle04c.pdf","http://www.lpl.arizona.edu/~yelle/eprints/Yelle04c.pdf","http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/bibliography/related_files/gw7501.pdf","http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/bibliography/related_files/gw7501.pdf","http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/bibliography/related_files/gw7801.pdf","http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/bibliography/related_files/gw7801.pdf","http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/bibliography/related_files/gw8502.pdf","http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/bibliography/related_files/gw8502.pdf","http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/bibliography/related_files/gw9701.pdf","http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/bibliography/related_files/gw9701.pdf","http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/bibliography/related_files/gw9601.pdf","http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/bibliography/related_files/gw9601.pdf","http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/bibliography/related_files/gpw0201.pdf","http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/bibliography/related_files/gpw0201.pdf","http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/bibliography/related_files/gw0301.pdf","http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/bibliography/related_files/gw0301.pdf","http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/bibliography/related_files/gw0304.pdf","http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/bibliography/related_files/gw0304.pdf","http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/bibliography/related_files/gw0303.pdf","http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/bibliography/related_files/gw0303.pdf","http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/bibliography/related_files/gw0302.pdf","http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/bibliography/related_files/gw0302.pdf","http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/bibliography/related_files/gw0601.pdf","http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/bibliography/related_files/gw0601.pdf"],"categories":["Jupiter","Planetary
