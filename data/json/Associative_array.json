{"cursor":"11119","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In computer science, an 'associative array', 'map', or 'dictionary' is an\nabstract data type composed of a collection of (key, value) pairs, such that\neach possible key appears at most once in the collection.\n\nOperations associated with this data type allow: ..\n* the addition of pairs to the collection\n* the removal of pairs from the collection\n* the modification of the values of existing pairs\n* the lookup of the value associated with a particular key\n\nThe 'dictionary problem' is the task of designing a data structure that\nimplements an associative array. A standard solution to the dictionary problem\nis a hash table; in some cases it is also possible to solve the problem using\ndirectly addressed arrays, binary search trees, or other more specialized\nstructures. .\n\nMany programming languages include associative arrays as primitive data\ntypes, and they are available in software libraries for many others. Content-\naddressable memory is a form of direct hardware-level support for\nassociative arrays.\n\nAssociative arrays have many applications including such fundamental programming\npatterns as memoization and the decorator pattern. , pp. 597â599.\n","linknr":336,"url":"Associative_array","recorded":1362540259,"links":32,"instances":["computer_science","programming_language","mathematics","programming_language","programming_language","computing","programming_language","programming_language","programming_language"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Associative arrays|*","Abstract data types","Composite data types","Data types"],"headings":["Operations","Example","Implementation","Language support","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["collection","computing"],["python","programming_language"],["collision","computer_science"],["python","programming_language"],["ruby","programming_language"],["lua","programming_language"],["python","programming_language"],["java","programming_language"],["go","programming_language"],["scala","programming_language"],["map","c++"],["unordered_map","c++"],["function","mathematics"]],"members":["collision","python","function","java","ruby","collection","unordered_map","scala","go","map","lua"],"related":["Computer_science","Abstract_data_type","Collection_(computing)","Data_structure","Hash_table","Array_data_structure","Binary_search_tree","Primitive_data_type","Software_library","Content-addressable_memory","Programming_pattern","Memoization","Decorator_pattern","Exception_handling","Iterator","Multimap","Bidirectional_map","Python_(programming_language)","Association_list","Linked_list","Sentinel_value","Hash_table","Array_data_structure","Hash_function","Collision_(computer_science)","Open_addressing","Binary_search_tree","Radix_tree","Trie","Judy_array","Van_Emde_Boas_tree","SNOBOL","MUMPS","SETL","AWK","Perl","Tcl","JavaScript","Python_(programming_language)","Ruby_(programming_language)","Lua_(programming_language)","Smalltalk","Objective-C",".NET_Framework","Python_(programming_language)","REALbasic","C++","Java_(programming_language)","Go_(programming_language)","Clojure","Scala_(programming_language)","Map_(C++)","Unordered_map_(C++)","Common_Lisp","Windows_PowerShell","PHP","JSON","Visual_FoxPro","Function_(mathematics)"]}
