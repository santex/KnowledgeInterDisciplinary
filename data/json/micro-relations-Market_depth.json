If the market is deep, a large order is needed to change the\nprice. Market depth closely relates to the notion of liquidity, the ease to find\na trading partner for a given order: a deep market is also a liquid market.\n\nA countryâs financial structure is composed of a mixture of banks, non-bank\nfinancial institutions (NBFIs), and the financial markets. Financial depth is\nused as a measure of the size of financial institutions and financial markets\nin a country. McKinnon (1973), Shaw (1973) and Levine and King (1993)\nWellâdeveloped financial systems are deep, i.e. sizeable relative to the\noverall size of the economy, and provide the economy with credit and other\nfinancial services.\n\nStudies show that a strong correlation between financial depth and longâterm\neconomic growth and poverty reduction. DemirgÃ¼Ã§âKunt and Levine, 2008\nGlobally, the annual average value of private credit across countries was 39\npercent with a standard deviation of 36 percent. Averaging over the time period\nof 1980â2010, private credit constitute less than 10 percent of GDPin Angola,\nCambodia, and Yemen, while exceeding 85 percent of GDP in Austria, China and the\nUnited Kingdom. For financial markets, research has shown that the trading of\nfirmsâ ownership (e.g. through stock exchanges) in an economy is closely tied to\nthe rate of economic development. For instance, the average of total value of\nstock traded is about 29 percent of GDP. In less developed countries such as\nArmenia, Tanzania, and Uruguay, stock value traded annually averaged less than\n0.23% over the 1980â2008 sample (10th percentile). In contrast, stock value\ntraded averaged over 75 percent in China (both Mainland and Hong Kong SAR),\nSaudi Arabia, Switzerland, and the United States (90th percentile).
