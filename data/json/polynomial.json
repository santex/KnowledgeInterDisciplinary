      "text" : " of a polynomial function of degree 3|thumb|upright]] In mathematics,\n 'polynomials' are the simplest class of mathematical expressions (apart from\n the numbers and expressions representing numbers). A 'polynomial' is an\n expression constructed from variables (also called indeterminates) and\n constants (usually numbers, but not always), using only the operations of\n addition, subtraction, multiplication, and non-negative integer exponents\n (which are abbreviations for several multiplications by the same value).\n However, the division by a constant is allowed, because the multiplicative\n inverse of a non-zero constant is also a constant. For example, is a\n polynomial, but is an algebraic expression that is not a polynomial, because\n its second term involves a division by the variable x (the term 4/x), and\n also because its third term contains an exponent that is not a non-negative\n integer (3/2).\n\nA 'polynomial function' is a function which is defined by a polynomial.\nSometimes, the term 'polynomial' is reserved for the polynomials that are\nexplicitly written as a sum (or difference) of terms involving only\nmultiplications and exponentiation by non negative integer exponents. In this\ncontext, the other polynomials are called 'polynomial expressions'. For example,\n<math>(x-y)^2</math> is a polynomial expression that represents the same thing\nas the polynomial <math>x^2-2xy+y^2.</math> The term \"polynomial\", as an\nadjective, can also be used for quantities that can be expressed as a polynomial\nof some parameter, as in [[polynomial time]], which is used in computational\ncomplexity theory.\n\nPolynomial comes from the Greek poly, \"many\" and medieval Latin binomium,\n\"binomial\".<ref>CNTRL (French National Center for Textual and Lexical\nResources), etymology of binôme\n[http://www.cnrtl.fr/etymologie/bin%C3%B4me]</ref><ref>Etymology of \"polynomial\"\nCompact Oxford English\nDictionary</ref><ref>[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=binomial Online\nEtymology Dictionary \"binomial\"]</ref> The word was introduced in Latin by\nFranciscus\nVieta.<ref>|[http://books.google.fr/books?id=mGJRjIC9fZgC&pg=PA139]</ref>\n\nPolynomials appear in a wide variety of areas of mathematics and science. For\nexample, they are used to form polynomial equations, which encode a wide range\nof problems, from elementary word problems to complicated problems in the\nsciences; they are used to define polynomial functions, which appear in settings\nranging from basic chemistry and physics to economics and social science; they\nare used in calculus and numerical analysis to approximate other functions. In\nadvanced mathematics, polynomials are used to construct polynomial rings, a\ncentral concept in algebra and algebraic geometry.\n",
