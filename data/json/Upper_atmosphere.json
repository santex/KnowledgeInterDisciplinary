This is above where\nairliners fly but below orbiting satellites. The area is of interest for\nmilitary surveillance purposes, as well as to commercial interests for\ncommunications. Craft that fly in near space include high altitude balloons, non-\nrigid airships and sounding rockets.\n\nThe terms \"near space\" and \"upper atmosphere\" are generally considered\nsynonymous. However, some sources distinguish between the two. Where such a\ndistinction is made, only the layers closest to the Karman line are called near\nspace, while only the remaining layers between the lower atmosphere and near\nspace are called the upper atmosphere.\n","linknr":153,"url":"Upper_atmosphere","recorded":1362375490,"links":17,"instances":[],"pdf":["https://research.maxwell.af.mil/papers/ay2005/ari/CADRE_ARI_2005-01.pdf"],"categories":["Altitudes in aviation"],"headings":["Exploration","Use in space travel","Atmospheric phenomena in near space","See also","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/83/Picture_taken_at_aprox._100%2C000_feet_above_Oregon_by_Justin_Hamel_and_Chris_Thompson.jpg/220px-Picture_taken_at_aprox._100%2C000_feet_above_Oregon_by_Justin_Hamel_and_Chris_Thompson.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/Aurora-SpaceShuttle-EO.jpg/140px-Aurora-SpaceShuttle-EO.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Earth's_atmosphere","Sea_level","Stratosphere","Mesosphere","Thermosphere","Airliner","Satellite","High_altitude_balloon","Non-rigid_airship","Sounding_rocket","Karman_line","Lower_atmosphere","Jean_Piccard","The_Century_of_Progress","Rockoon","Sounding_rockets","ARCASPACE","Da_Vinci_Project","JP_Aerospace","Spaceport","Airship_to_Orbit","Polar_aurora","High_altitude","Kármán_line","Amateur_Radio_High_Altitude_Ballooning"]}
