Lazopoulos\nwas ranked 83rd by the public in Skai TV's [[Great Greeks]] in 2009. In 2010,\n[[Forbes]] ranked Lazopoulos as the most powerful and influential celebrity in\nGreece.\n\nCareer Apostolos Lazopoulos was born in Larissa, Greece, where he received his\nprimary and secondary school education. He then entered the School of Law at the\nUniversity of Thrace and in 1984 received his Masterâs degree from the\nUniversity of Thessaloniki. Rather than practicing Law however, he chose to\ndevote himself exclusively to acting, which had by this time won him over.\n\nIn 1979, he writes his first script for the revue âSOMETHINGâS COOKING IN\nGIPSYLANDâ, in which he stars with the Thessalic Theatre. âSAY GOODBYE, ITâS ALL\nOVER NOWâ soon followed with tremendous success and thus Lakis Lazopoulos joins\nthe Free Theatre of Athens with whom he performs âWHY PEOPLE ARE HAPPYâ,\nfollowed by yet another successful revue, âCHANGE AND CRAZEâ.\n\nThe political situation at the time triggers the production of four revues of a\nmore politico-satirical nature, written between the years 1982-1986 by Lakis\nLazopoulos and Giannis Xanthoulis: âHAIDOâS PASOKââ (1982), âPASOK KEEPS HARPING\nONâ (1983), âBLOWING HOT AND COLD ON KASTRIâ (the PMâs residence), and âANDREAâS\nTAXING TOLLSâ (1985).\n\nIn the summer of 1986 he performs in [[Lysistrata]] by Aristophanes, and as the\nlead infuses the role with his own personal style through his translation of\nthe Ancient Greek comedy.
