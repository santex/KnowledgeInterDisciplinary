The Convention\nestablishes rules of airspace, aircraft registration and safety, and\ndetails the rights of the signatories in relation to air travel. The\nConvention also exempts air fuels from tax.\n\nThe document was signed on December 7, 1944 in Chicago, U.S., by 52 signatory\nstates. It received the requisite 26th ratification on March 5, 1947 and went\ninto effect on April 4, 1947, the same date that ICAO came into being. In\nOctober of the same year, ICAO became a specialized agency of the United Nations\nEconomic and Social Council (ECOSOC). The Convention has since been revised\neight times (in 1959, 1963, 1969, 1975, 1980, 1997, 2000 and 2006).\n\nAs of 2013, the Chicago Convention has 191 state parties, which includes all\nmember states of the United Nationsâexcept Dominica, Liechtenstein, and\nTuvaluâplus the Cook Islands.\n","linknr":457,"url":"Convention_on_International_Civil_Aviation","recorded":1375087186,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Chicago_Convention_on_International_Civil_Aviation&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Chicago_Convention_on_International_Civil_Aviation&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","/wiki/Chicago_Convention_on_International_Civil_Aviation","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","/w/index.php?title=Convention_on_International_Civil_Aviation&redirect=no","#mw-navigation","#p-search","#cite_note-ratifications-1","/wiki/International_Civil_Aviation_Organization","/wiki/United_Nations","/wiki/Airspace","/wiki/Aircraft_registration","/wiki/Air_travel","/wiki/Chicago","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/United_Nations_Economic_and_Social_Council","/wiki/United_Nations","/wiki/Dominica","/wiki/Liechtenstein","/wiki/Tuvalu","/wiki/Cook_Islands","#cite_note-ratifications-1","#Main_Articles","#Annexes","#Notes","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Chicago_Convention_on_International_Civil_Aviation&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/International_flight","/w/index.php?title=Chicago_Convention_on_International_Civil_Aviation&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Standards_And_Recommended_Practices","/wiki/Aeronautical_Information_Service","/wiki/Units_of_measurement","/wiki/International_System_of_Units","/wiki/Foot_(length)","/wiki/Distance","/wiki/Altitude","/wiki/Knot_(unit)","/wiki/Speed","/wiki/Nautical_mile","/w/index.php?title=Chicago_Convention_on_International_Civil_Aviation&action=edit&section=3","#cite_ref-ratifications_1-0","#cite_ref-ratifications_1-1","http://www.icao.int/secretariat/legal/List%20of%20Parties/Chicago_EN.pdf","/w/index.php?title=Chicago_Convention_on_International_Civil_Aviation&action=edit&section=4","http://www.icao.int/publications/pages/doc7300.aspx","http://dcaa.slv.dk:8000/icaodocs/Annex%205%20-%20Units%20of%20Measurement%20to%20be%20Used%20in%20Air%20and%20Ground%20Operations/","http://www.icao.int/secretariat/PostalHistory/the_chicago_convention.htm","/wiki/Template:Commercial_air_travel","/wiki/Template_talk:Commercial_air_travel","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Commercial_air_travel&action=edit","/wiki/Civil_aviation","/wiki/Airline","/wiki/Airline_codes","/wiki/List_of_airline_holding_companies","/wiki/List_of_charter_airlines","/wiki/List_of_low-cost_airlines","/wiki/List_of_passenger_airlines","/wiki/List_of_regional_airlines","/wiki/Airline_alliance","/wiki/Oneworld","/wiki/SkyTeam","/wiki/Star_Alliance","/wiki/Trade_association","/wiki/Airlines_for_America","/wiki/Arab_Air_Carriers_Organization","/wiki/Association_of_Asia_Pacific_Airlines","/wiki/Association_of_European_Airlines","/wiki/African_Airlines_Association","/wiki/Air_Transport_Action_Group","/wiki/Airline_Tariff_Publishing_Company","/wiki/European_Low_Fares_Airline_Association","/wiki/European_Regional_Airlines_Association","/wiki/International_Air_Transport_Association","/wiki/International_Association_of_Travel_Agents_Network","/wiki/International_Civil_Aviation_Organization","/wiki/International_Society_of_Transport_Aircraft_Trading","/wiki/Regional_Aviation_Association_of_Australia","/wiki/Aircrew","/wiki/Pilot_in_command","/wiki/First_officer_(civil_aviation)","/wiki/Second_Officer_(civil_aviation)","/wiki/Third_Officer_(civil_aviation)","/wiki/Flight_attendant","/wiki/Flight_engineer","/wiki/Loadmaster","/wiki/Aviator","/wiki/Purser#Aircraft","/wiki/Deadheading_(aviation)","/wiki/Airliner","/wiki/Travel_class","/wiki/First_class_(aviation)","/wiki/Business_class","/wiki/Premium_economy","/wiki/Economy_class","/wiki/Fare_basis_code","/wiki/Aircraft_cabin","/wiki/Aircraft_lavatory","/wiki/Aircraft_seat_map","/wiki/Airline_meal","/wiki/Airline_seat","/wiki/Airsickness_bag","/wiki/Buy_on_board","/wiki/In-flight_entertainment","/wiki/Inflight_smoking","/wiki/Galley_(kitchen)","/wiki/Airport","/wiki/Aerodrome","/wiki/Airline_hub","/wiki/Airport_check-in","/wiki/Airport_lounge","/wiki/Airport_rail_link","/wiki/Airport_security","/wiki/Airport_terminal","/wiki/Airstair","/wiki/Boarding_(transport)","/wiki/Domestic_airport","/wiki/Gate_(airport)","/wiki/International_airport","/wiki/Jet_bridge","/wiki/Runway","/wiki/Low_cost_carrier_terminal","/wiki/Transit_hotel","/wiki/Customs","/wiki/Immigration","/wiki/
