Clockwise from top: kelvin\n(temperature), second (time), metre (length), kilogram (mass), candela (luminous\nintensity), mole (amount of substance) and ampere (electric current).]] The\n'International System of Units' (abbreviated 'SI' from ) is the modern form of\nthe metric system. It comprises a coherent system of units of measurement built\naround seven base units, 22 named and an indeterminate number of unnamed\ncoherent derived units, and a set of prefixes that act as decimal-based\nmultipliers. The standards, published in 1960, are based on the metre-kilogram-\nsecond system, rather than the centimetre-gram-second system, which, in turn,\nhad several variants. The SI has been declared to be an evolving system; thus\nprefixes and units are created and unit definitions are modified through\ninternational agreement as the technology of measurement progresses, and as the\nprecision of measurements improves. SI is the world's most widely used system of\nmeasurement, used in both everyday commerce and science. \n\n An extensive\npresentation on SI units is maintained on-line by\n[http://www.physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/units.html NIST], including a\n[http://www.physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/SIdiagram.html diagram] of the relations\nbetween the derived units based on the SI units. Definitions of the basic units\ncan be found on this site, as well as the\n[http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Constants/codata.pdf CODATA report], which lists\nvalues for special constants such as the electric constant, the magnetic\nconstant, and the speed of light, all of which have defined values as a result\nof the definition of the metre and ampere. In the International\nSystem of Units (SI) (BIPM, 2006), the definition of the metre fixes the speed\nof light in vacuum c 0, the definition of the ampere fixes the\nmagnetic constant (also called the permeability of vacuum) Î¼ 0, and\nthe definition of the mole fixes the molar mass of the carbon 12 atom\nM( 12 C) to have the exact values given in the table [Table 1, p.7].\nSince the electric constant (also called the permittivity of vacuum) is related\nto Î¼ 0 by Îµ 0 = 1/Î¼ 0c 02 , it\ntoo is known exactly.  â CODATA report\n\nThe system has been nearly globally adopted. Only Burma, Liberia and the United\nStates have not adopted SI units as their official system of weights and\nmeasures. In the United States metric units are not commonly used outside of\nscience, medicine and the government; {{cite web\n| url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-\n| factbook/appendix/appendix-g.html title=Appendix G : Weights and\n| Measures work=The World Factbook publisher=Central Intelligence Agency\n| accessdate=2011-09-03}}\n however, United States customary units are officially defined in terms of\nSI units. The United Kingdom has officially adopted a partial metrication\npolicy, with no intention of replacing imperial units entirely. Canada has\nadopted it for most purposes, but imperial units are still legally permitted and\nremain in common use throughout a few sectors of Canadian society, particularly\nin the buildings, trades and railways sectors.
