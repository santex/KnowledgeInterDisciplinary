He played one season each for the NFL's\n  Atlanta Falcons and the AFL's Oakland Raiders and Buffalo Bills. He was\n  drafted by the San Francisco 49ers in the 11th round, pick 166 overall, in the\n  1966 NFL draft and by the New York Jets in the 19th round, pick 168 overall,\n  of the 1966 AFL draft.\n\nRidlehuber is best known for scoring a touchdown with 33 seconds remaining in a\ngame against the New York Jets, by recovering a fumbled kickoff. It occurred in\nthe Heidi Game, and was not seen by television viewers because NBC switched from\nfootball coverage to the 1968 film [[Heidi (1968 film)|Heidi]]. The Heidi Game\nor Heidi Bowl as it is also known led to a change in the way professional\nfootball is televised on network television; games are now shown to their\nconclusion before evening programming begins.\n\nHis most notable Buffalo Bills highlight came during a game against the 0â5 then\ncalled Boston Patriots. Preston was a backup running back with the 2â3 Bills.\nO.J. Simpson had been concussed in Houston the week before and was not dressed\nfor the Patriots game. Fullback Wayne Patrick (number 30) had run 17 times for\n131 yards. Max Anderson (number 22) also known as Mini Max Anderson had 10\ncarries for 46 yards.\n\nMini Max was injured during a collision on the field. His face mask shattered\nand Anderson's teeth were broken and lying on the turf. While medical personnel\nwere administering to Max, Bill's coach John Rauch called for Preston along the\nsideline. The score was tied 16â16 late in the 4th quarter. Rauch knelt down and\ndrew a play out in the dirt. The play, a halfback option play, had been\npracticed for the last couple of weeks. It was originally planned for O.J. to\nthrow a short pass to the Tight end. The Bills were in a short yardage\nsituation, and this pass completion would keep the drive alive.\n\nPreston took the play into the huddle and the play was set in motion. On the\nsnap, Ridlehuber who had been a quarterback at Georgia, noticed that the\nPatriots cornerback was closing in on the Tight end. His better judgement told\nhim, to look elsewhere for an available receiver. He then saw Bills wide\nreceiver Haven Moses wide open. He tossed a pass to the open Moses and he scored\na touchdown on the long 45-yard pass completion.\n\nWhen he returned to the bench, Coach Rauch congratulated him, and said: 'Be glad\nit worked.' The play gave the Bills a 23â16 lead. This touchdown stood up and\nwas the final score. Notably, during that game, his regular jersey number (37)\nwas ripped; as such, a replacement jersey with the number 31 was given to him to\nwear instead. The number 31 was retired for most of the team's history to\nrepresent a generic player and the \"spirit of the franchise;\" Ridlehuber would\nbe the only player to wear the number for the Bills until it was unceremoniously\nput back into circulation in 1991.\n\nPreston now is Honorary Commissioner of the Preston Ridlehuber Football League.\nThis fantasy football league has been in existence since 1991 and is named as a\ntribute to a man who made great plays before and after his time with the Buffalo\nBills. A career-ending injury prevented the world from enjoying Preston's\ncontributions on the field.\n","linknr":217,"url":"Preston_Ridlehuber","recorded":1375056840,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Preston_Ridlehuber&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Preston_Ridlehuber&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Biographies_of_living_persons","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability","/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources","/wiki/Defamation","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:External_links","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources#Inline_citations","/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Fact_and_Reference_Check","/wiki/American_football_positions","/wiki/Running_back","/wiki/Jersey_number#American_football","/wiki/Greenwood,_South_Carolina","/wiki/Season_(sports)","/wiki/1966_AFL_season","/wiki/1969_AFL_season","/wiki/American_Football_League_Draft","/wiki/1966_American_Football_League_Draft","/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers","/wiki/List_of_college_athletic_conferences","/wiki/University_of_Georgia","/wiki/Atlanta_Falcons","/wiki/American_Football_League","/wiki/Oakland_Raiders","/wiki/1968_AFL_season","/wiki/American_Football_League","/wiki/Buffalo_Bills","/wiki/1969_AFL_season","/wiki/Reception_(American_football)","/wiki/Touchdown","http://www.databasefootball.com/players/playerpage.htm?ilkid=RIDLEPRE01","/wiki/Greenwood,_South_Carolina","/wiki/Professional_football","/wiki/Running_back","/wiki/American_Football_League","/wiki/Atlanta_Falcons","/wiki/Oakland_Raiders","/wiki/Buffalo_Bills","/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers","/wiki/NFL","/wiki/New_York_Jets","/wiki/American_Football_League_(1960)","/wiki/Touchdown","/wiki/New_York_Jets","/wiki/Fumble","/wiki/Kickoff_(American_football)","/wiki/Heidi_Game","/wiki/NBC","/wiki/Heidi_(1968_film)","/wiki/Buffalo_Bills","/wiki/Boston_Patriots","/wiki/O.J._Simpson","/wiki/Wayne_Patrick","/wiki/Max_Anderson_(American_football)","/wiki/John_Rauch","/wiki/Halfback_option_play","/wiki/University_of_Georgia","/wiki/Haven_Moses","/wiki/Buffalo_Bills","/w/index.php?title=Preston_Ridlehuber&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Gainesville_High_School_(Georgia)","/wiki/Gainesville,_Georgia","/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates","/wiki/Sun_Bowl","/wiki/Texas_Tech_Red_Raiders_football","/wiki/Sigma_Nu","http://WWW.MyPRFL.com","/w/index.php?title=Preston_Ridlehuber&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/File:P_vip.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/69/P_vip.svg/28px-P_vip.svg.png","/wiki/Portal:Biography","/wiki/List_of_American_Football_League_players","/w/index.php?title=Preston_Ridlehuber&action=edit&section=3","http://www.onlineathens.com/stories/011904/dog_20040119041.shtml","/wiki/Template:1966_Atlanta_Falcons","/wiki/Template_talk:1966_Atlanta_Falcons","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:1966_Atlanta_Falcons&action=edit","/wiki/Atlanta_Falcons","/wiki/1966_Atlanta_Falcons_season","/wiki/Taz_Anderson","/wiki/Gary_Barnes","/wiki/Vern_Burke","/wiki/Lee_Calland","/wiki/Dennis_Claridge","/wiki/Junior_Coffey","/wiki/Angelo_Coia","/wiki/Ed_Cook_(American_football)","/w/index.php?title=Perry_Lee_Dunn&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Glenn_Glass&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Dan_Grimm","/wiki/Alex_Hawkins","/wiki/Ralph_Heck","/wiki/Tom_Hutchinson_(American_football)","/wiki/Bill_Jobko","/wiki/Randy_Johnson_(American_football)","/w/index.php?title=Rudy_Johnson&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Jerry_Jones_(offensive_lineman)&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Lou_Kirouac&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Dick_Koeper&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Errol_Linden","/wiki/Billy_Lothridge","/wiki/Red_Mack","/wiki/Frank_Marchlewski","/wiki/Bud_Marshall","/w/index.php?title=Bill_Martin_(American_football)&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Larry_Morris","/wiki/Tommy_Nobis","/wiki/Nick_Rassas","/wiki/Ken_Reaves","/wiki/Ron_Rector","/wiki/Guy_Reese","/wiki/Bobby_Richards","/wiki/Jerry_Richardson","/w/index.php?title=Bob_Riggle&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Karl_Rubke","/wiki/Marion_Rushing","/w/index.php?title=Charlie_Scales&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Bob_She
