{"cursor":"76016","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The principle of 'linguistic relativity' holds that the structure of a language\naffects the ways in which its speakers conceptualize their world, i.e. their\nworld view, or otherwise influences their cognitive processes. Popularly known\nas the 'SapirâWhorf hypothesis', or 'Whorfianism', the principle is often\ndefined as having two versions: (i) the strong version that language determines\nthought and that linguistic categories limit and determine cognitive categories\nand (ii) the weak version that linguistic categories and usage influence thought\nand certain kinds of non-linguistic behaviour. The term \"SapirâWhorf Hypothesis\"\nis a misnomer, as Edward Sapir and Benjamin Lee Whorf never co-authored\nanything, and never stated their ideas in terms of a hypothesis. The distinction\nbetween a weak and a strong version of the hypothesis is also a later invention,\nas Sapir and Whorf never set up such a dichotomy, although often in their\nwritings their views of this relativity principle are phrased in stronger or\nweaker terms. Hill & Mannheim (1992)\n\nThe idea was first clearly expressed by 19th-century thinkers, such as Wilhelm\nvon Humboldt, who saw language as the expression of the spirit of a nation.\nMembers of the early 20th-century school of American anthropology headed by\nFranz Boas and Edward Sapir also embraced forms of the idea to one extent or\nanother, but Sapir in particular wrote more often against than in favor of\nanything like linguistic determinism. Sapir's student Benjamin Lee Whorf came to\nbe seen as the primary proponent as a result of his published observations of\nhow he perceived linguistic differences to have consequences in human cognition\nand behavior. Harry Hoijer, one of Sapir's students, introduced the term\n\"SapirâWhorf hypothesis\", \"The SapirâWhorf hypothesis\", in Hoijer\n1954:92â105 even though the two scholars never actually advanced any such\nhypothesis. This usage is now generally seen as a misnomer. As Jane Hill and\nBruce Mannheim write: Yet, just as the Holy Roman Empire was neither holy, nor\nRoman, nor an Empire the \"SapirâWhorf Hypothesis\" is neither consistent with the\nwritings of Sapir and Whorf, nor a hypothesis (Hill & Mannheim 1992)\nWhorf's principle of linguistic relativity was reformulated as a testable\nhypothesis by Roger Brown and Eric Lenneberg who conducted experiments designed\nto find out whether color perception varies between speakers of languages that\nclassified colors differently. As the study of the universal nature of human\nlanguage and cognition came into focus in the 1960s the idea of linguistic\nrelativity fell out of favour among linguists. A 1969 study by Brent Berlin and\nPaul Kay demonstrated the existence of universal semantic constraints in the\nfield of color terminology which was widely seen to discredit the existence of\nlinguistic relativity in this domain, although this conclusion has been disputed\nby relativist researchers.\n\nFrom the late 1980s a new school of linguistic relativity scholars have examined\nthe effects of differences in linguistic categorization on cognition, finding\nbroad support for non-deterministic versions of the hypothesis in experimental\ncontexts. Koerner, E.F.K.\"Towards a full pedigree of the\nSapirâWhorf Hypothesis:from Locke to Lucy\" Chapter in \" Some\neffects of linguistic relativity have been shown in several semantic domains,\nalthough they are generally weak. Currently, a balanced view of linguistic\nrelativity is espoused by most linguists holding that language influences\ncertain kinds of cognitive processes in non-trivial ways, but that other\nprocesses are better seen as subject to universal factors. Research is focused\non exploring the ways and extent to which language influences thought. The principle of linguistic relativity and the relation\nbetween language and thought has also received attention in varying academic\nfields from philosophy to psychology and anthropology, and it has also inspired\nand colored works of fiction and the invention of constructed languages.\n","linknr":747,"url":"Linguistic_relativity","recorded":1362480866,"links":73,"instances":["book","psychologist","computer_programmer","programming_language","programming_language","linguistics"],"pdf":["http://www1.icsi.berkeley.edu/~kay/Everett.CA.Piraha.pdf","http://www1.icsi.berkeley.edu/~kay/Everett.CA.Piraha.pdf","http://tedlab.mit.edu/tedlab_website/researchpapers/Frank%20et%20al.%20InPress%20Cog.pdf","http://tedlab.mit.edu/tedlab_website/researchpapers/Frank%20et%20al.%20InPress%20Cog.pdf","http://junq.info/wp-content/uploads/downloads/2012/06/Whorf-effects.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20110710183418/http://elliscave.com/APL_J/tool.pdf","http://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/~kay/cats-dogs-in-press.pdf","http://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/~kay/cats-dogs-in-press.pdf","http://users.utu.fi/freder/Pullum-Eskimo-VocabHoax.pdf","http://users.utu.fi/freder/Pullum-Eskimo-VocabHoax.pdf","http://userwww.service.emory.edu/~kholme2/WHwires.pdf","http://userwww.service.emory.edu/~kholme2/WHwires.pdf","http://ldc.upenn.edu/myl/llog/EverettPiraha.pdf","http://ldc.upenn.edu/myl/llog/EverettPiraha.pdf","http://www-psych.stanford.edu/~lera/papers/gender.pdf"],"categories":["Psycholinguistics","Relativism","Arguments
