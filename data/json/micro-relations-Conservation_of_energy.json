It states that the total amount of\nenergy in an isolated system remains constant over time. The total energy is\nsaid to be conserved over time. For an isolated system, this law means that\nenergy can change its location within the system, and that it can change form\nwithin the system, for instance chemical energy can become kinetic energy, but\nthat energy can be neither created nor destroyed.\n\nIn the twentieth century, the definition of energy was broadened. It was found\nthat particles that have rest mass are equivalent to amounts of energy (see mass-\nenergy equivalence). There particles were found subject to annihilation in which\nmatter particles (such as electrons) can be converted to non-matter (such as\nphotons of electromagnetic radiation), or even into potential energy or kinetic\nenergy. Matter could also be created out of kinetic or other types of energy, in\nthe process of matter creation. Thus, matter (defined as ponderable matter\nparticles) was found not to be conserved.\n\nIn such a transformation process within an isolated system, neither the mass nor\nthe energy changes over time, although the matter content may change. Therefore,\nconservation of energy, and conservation of mass, each still holds as a law in\nits own right (indeed they are restatements of the same law, when mass and\nenergy are recognized to be equivalent). When stated alternatively, in terms of\nmass and of energy, they appear as the apparently distinct laws of the\nnineteenth century.\n\nA consequence of the law of conservation of energy is that no intended\n\"perpetual motion machine\" can perpetually deliver energy to its\nsurroundings. Planck, M. (1923/1927). Treatise on Thermodynamics, third\nEnglish edition translated by A. Ogg from the seventh German edition, Longmans,\nGreen & Co., London, page 40. Any delivery of energy by such a device\nwould result in delivery of mass also, and the machine would lose mass\ncontinually until it eventually disappeared.\n","recorded":1362124434,"portal":[],"list":[],"links":"310","instances":["classical_thermodynamics","manufacturing","scientist","thermodynamics","physics"],"pdf":["http://35.9.69.219/home/modules/pdf_modules/m158.pdf"],"categories":["Energy
