{"cursor":"2391","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nIn Sociology, 'master status' is the social position which is the primary\nidentifying characteristic of an individual. It is defined as \"a status that has\nexceptional importance for social identity, often shaping a person's entire\nlife\" \n\nThe master status is often the most important constituent in the architecture of\nan individualâs identity. Common master statuses are those of race or ethnicity,\nsex, sexual orientation, physical ability, age, economic standing, religion or\nspirituality, and education. Others include that of being a parent, child, or\nsibling; being employed or unemployed; and being disabled or mentally ill. It is\nnot realistic to deny that as a society we label individuals based on their most\nprominent characteristic in this respect, such as the \"old loon\", the \"blonde\nbimbo\", etc.\n\nIn perception, an individualâs master status supersedes her/his other\nidentifying traits; for example, if a woman feels that her role as a mother is\nmore important than her role as a woman, a daughter, a wife, an American, and a\nnovelist, she is more likely to label herself first as a mother and to identify\nwith other women who label themselves as such. Even more so, an individual's\nmaster status dominates her/his perception by others and their behaviour towards\nhim/her. More than other aspects of the status set, the master status affects\nhow the individual behaves and how others behave with respect to him in almost\nevery given situation.\n","linknr":101,"url":"Master_status","recorded":1362676785,"links":14,"instances":["classification_of_human_beings"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Sociological terminology","Role status"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/15/Vista_Login_Manager_Cropped.svg/40px-Vista_Login_Manager_Cropped.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["race","classification_of_human_beings"]],"members":["race"],"related":["Social_position","Character_structure","Race_(classification_of_human_beings)","Ethnicity","Sex","Sexual_orientation","Ageing","Socioeconomics","Religion","Spirituality","Education","Parent","Child","Sibling","Disability","Mental_illness"]}
