{"cursor":"19301","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Particle aggregation' refers to formation of clusters in a colloidal suspension\nand represents the most frequent mechanism leading to destabilization of\ncolloidal systems. During this process, which normally occurs within short\nperiods of time (seconds to hours), particles dispersed in the liquid phase\nstick to each other, and spontaneously form irregular particle clusters, flocs,\nor aggregates. This phenomenon is also referred to as coagulation or\nflocculation and such a suspension is also called unstable. Particle aggregation\ncan be induced by adding salts or an other chemical referred to as coagulant or\nflocculant. M. Elimelech, J. Gregory, X. Jia, R. Williams,\nParticle Deposition and Aggregation: Measurement, Modelling and Simulation, Butterworth-\nHeinemann, 1998. Some people refer to specifically to flocculation when\naggregation is induced by addition of polymers or polyelectrolytes, while\ncoagulation is a more widely used term.\n\n\nParticle aggregation is normally an irreversible process. Once particle\naggregates have formed, they will not easily disrupt. In the course of\naggregation, the aggregates will grow in size, and as a consequence they may\nsettle to the bottom of the container, which is referred to as sedimentation).\nAlternatively, a colloidal gel may form in concentrated suspensions which\nchanges its rheological properties. The reverse process whereby particle\naggregates are disrupted and dispersed as individual particles is referred to as\npeptization hardly occurs spontaneously, but may occur under stirring or shear.\n\nColloidal particles may also remain dispersed in liquids for long periods of\ntime (days to years). This phenomenon is referred to as colloidal stability and\nsuch a suspension said to be stable. Stable suspensions are often obtained at\nlow salt concentrations or by addition of chemicals referred to as stabilizers\nor stabilizing agents.\n\nSimilar aggregation processes occurs in other dispersed systems too. In\nemulsions, they may also be coupled to droplet coalescence, and not only lead to\nsedimentation but also to creaming. In aerosols, air-born particles may equally\naggregate and form larger clusters (e.g., soot).\n","linknr":209,"url":"Particle_aggregation","recorded":1362482979,"links":15,"instances":["disambiguation","chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Chemistry","Materials science","Colloidal chemistry"],"headings":["Early Stages","Later Stages","Homoaggregation versus Heteroaggregation","Experimental Techniques","Relevance","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/ParticleAggregationOverviewScheme1.png/400px-ParticleAggregationOverviewScheme1.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf7/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/41/ParticleAggregationSchemeStabilityPlot1.png/250px-ParticleAggregationSchemeStabilityPlot1.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf7/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c1/ParticleAggregationDLCAvsRLCA1.png/300px-ParticleAggregationDLCAvsRLCA1.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf7/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/4/1/041bf56ab91f9e9b3bb86986a35c0cce.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/MLS_scan.gif/200px-MLS_scan.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf7/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["coagulation","disambiguation"],["suspension","chemistry"]],"members":["coagulation","suspension"],"related":["Colloid","Flocculation","Polymer","Polyelectrolyte","Coagulation_(disambiguation)","Settling","Sedimentation","Gel","Rheology","Peptization","Shear_stress","Emulsion","Aerosol","Soot","Diffusion","Brownian_motion","Surface_charge","Electrical_double_layer","Double_layer_forces","Van_der_Waals_force","Ion","Elementary_charge","Surfactant","Polyelectrolyte","DLVO_theory","DLVO_theory","Flocculation","Shear_stress","Fractal","Radius_of_gyration","Gel","Elastic_modulus","Particle_deposition","Fouling","Transmittance","Light_scattering","Spectrophotometry","Absorbance","Static_light_scattering","Dynamic_light_scattering","Backscatter","Diffusing-wave_spectroscopy","Particle_counter","Coulter_counter","Settling","Filtration","Rheology","Ultrasound","Dielectric_spectroscopy","Polyelectrolyte","Aerosol","Colloid","Double_layer_forces","Electrical_double_layer","Emulsion","Flocculation","Gel","Nanoparticle","Particle_deposition","Peptization","Polyelectrolyte","Reaction_rate","Settling","Sol-gel","Surface_charge","Suspension_(chemistry)","Van_der_Waals_force"]}
