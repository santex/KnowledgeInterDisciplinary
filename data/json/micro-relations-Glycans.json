{"cursor":"12142","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":":Not to be confused with [[glucan]].\n\nThe term 'glycan' refers to a polysaccharide or oligosaccharide. Glycans usually\nconsist solely of O-glycosidic linkages of monosaccharides. For example,\ncellulose is a glycan (or, to be more specific, a glucan) composed of Î²-1,4-\nlinked D -glucose, and chitin is a glycan composed of Î²-1,4-linked\nN-acetyl- D-glucosamine. Glycans can be homo- or heteropolymers of\nmonosaccharide residues, and can be linear or branched. Glycan may also be used\nto refer to the carbohydrate portion of a glycoconjugate, such as a\nglycoprotein, glycolipid, or a proteoglycan.\n","linknr":320,"url":"Glycans","recorded":1362507643,"links":18,"instances":["protein"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Oligosaccharides","Glycoproteins","Carbohydrates","Carbohydrate chemistry","Glycomics"],"headings":["Glycans and Proteins","Glycoscience","Glycans and lipids","GPI-Anchors","See also","Resources","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["chaperone","protein"]],"members":["chaperone"],"related":["Polysaccharide","Oligosaccharide","Glycosidic_bond","Monosaccharides","Glucan","Carbohydrate","Glycoprotein","Glycolipid","Proteoglycan","Eukaryotes","Prokaryotes","N-linked-Glycan","Endoplasmic_reticulum","Asparagine","Sequon","Proline","N-acetyl_galactosamine","Galactose","Neuraminic_acid","N-acetylglucosamine","Fructose","Mannose","Fucose","Sugar","Cytoplasm","Endoplasmic_reticulum","Glycosyltransferase","Oligosaccharyltransferase","Golgi_apparatus","Neuraminic_acid","Chaperone_(protein)","Calnexin","Calreticulin","Cysteine","Natural_Killer_cell","Lysosomal","Mannose-6-phosphate","Mannose_6-phosphate_receptor","Serine","Threonine","Proline","Polylactosamine","Sialic_acid","Fucose","Sialyl-Lewis_X","Sialyl_lewis_x","ABO","Selectin","Weibel–Palade_body","Peptidoglycan","Extravasation","Glycoprotein","Glycophorin","Erythrocyte","Cell_membranes","Mucin","Saliva","Dental_plaque","Notch_signaling","Thrombospondin","Factor_VII","Factor_IX","Plasminogen_activator","Heparin","Heparan_sulfate","Dermatan","Keratan_sulfate","Chondroitin","U.S._National_Research_Council","Glycolipids","Glycophosphatidylinositol","Glycosylation","Glycoside","Glycoside_hydrolase","Glycosyltransferase","Swiss_Institute_of_Bioinformatics","Consortium_for_Functional_Glycomics","Nature_Publishing_Group","U.S._National_Research_Council","U.S._National_Research_Council"]}
