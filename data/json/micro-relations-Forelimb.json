{"cursor":"1936","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"s have varying functions but are all homologous.]]\n\nA 'forelimb' is an anterior limb (arm, leg, or similar appendage) on a\nterrestrial vertebrate's body. For quadrupeds, the term 'foreleg' is often used\ninstead. (A forearm however is the part of the arm or forelimb between the elbow\nand the wrist.)\n\nAll vertebrate forelimbs are homologous, meaning that they all evolved from the\nsame structures. So for example the flipper of a turtle or of a dolphin, the arm\nof a human, the foreleg of a horse, and the wings of both bats and birds are\nultimately homologous, despite the large differences between them.\n","linknr":103,"url":"Forelimb","recorded":1362673940,"links":14,"instances":["anatomy","biology","biology","anatomy"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Animal anatomy"],"headings":["Bibliography","Notes","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/64/Handskelett_MK1888.png/350px-Handskelett_MK1888.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/Kaprosuchus.jpg/70px-Kaprosuchus.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["homology","biology"],["limb","anatomy"],["homology","biology"],["evolution","biology"],["flipper","anatomy"]],"members":["flipper","evolution","homology","limb"],"related":["Homology_(biology)","Anterior","Limb_(anatomy)","Terrestrial_animal","Vertebrate","Quadruped","Forearm","Elbow-joint","Wrist","Homology_(biology)","Evolution_(biology)","Flipper_(anatomy)","Turtle","Dolphin"]}
