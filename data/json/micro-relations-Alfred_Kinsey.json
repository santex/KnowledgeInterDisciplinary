He is best known for writing \"Sexual Behavior in the Human Male\"\n (1948) and \"Sexual Behavior in the Human Female\" (1953), also known as the\n Kinsey Reports, as well as the Kinsey scale. Kinsey's research on human\n sexuality, foundational to the field of sexology, provoked controversy in the\n 1940s and 1950s. His work has profoundly influenced social and cultural values\n in the United States, as well as internationally.\n","linknr":516,"url":"Alfred_Kinsey","recorded":1362373754,"links":61,"instances":["new_jersey","boy_scouts_of_america","bloomington"],"pdf":[],"categories":["1894 births","1956 deaths","American biologists","American entomologists","American relationships and sexuality writers","American sexologists","Arnold Arboretum","Bisexual writers","Bowdoin College alumni","Cardiovascular disease deaths in Indiana","Deaths from pneumonia","Disease-related deaths in Indiana","Eagle Scouts","Harvard University people","Indiana University faculty","LGBT writers from the United States","LGBT scientists","People from Hoboken, New Jersey","People from South Orange, New Jersey","Rockefeller Foundation","Sex educators","Sexual orientation and medicine","Bisexual men","Polyamorous people"],"headings":["Early life and education","Personal life","Kinsey and sexology","Kinsey in the media","Death","Legacy in popular culture","Significant publications","See also","Notes","Bibliography","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4c/Akintervw.jpg/200px-Akintervw.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/First_Street_1320%2C_Kinsey_House%2C_Vinegar_Hill_HD.jpg/250px-First_Street_1320%2C_Kinsey_House%2C_Vinegar_Hill_HD.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Wikiquote-logo-en.svg/40px-Wikiquote-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["indiana_university","bloomington"],["eagle_scout_rank","boy_scouts_of_america"],["columbia_high_school","new_jersey"]],"members":["columbia_high_school","eagle_scout_rank","indiana_university"],"related":["Hoboken,_New_Jersey","New_Jersey","Bloomington,_Indiana","Indiana","Biology","Indiana_University","Bowdoin_College","Harvard_University","Sexology","Human_sexuality","Kinsey_Reports","Kinsey_scale","Kinsey_Institute_for_Research_in_Sex,_Gender,_and_Reproduction","Biologist","Entomology","Zoology","Sexologist","Sex","Indiana_University_(Bloomington)","Kinsey_Institute_for_Research_in_Sex,_Gender,_and_Reproduction","Sexual_Behavior_in_the_Human_Male","Sexual_Behavior_in_the_Human_Female","Kinsey_Reports","Kinsey_scale","Human_sexuality","Sexology","Hoboken,_New_Jersey","PBS","Stevens_Institute_of_Technology","Rickets","Rheumatic_fever","Typhoid_fever","Vitamin_D","The_Draft","World_War_I","Methodism","South_Orange,_New_Jersey","YMCA","Group_dynamics","Boy_Scouts_of_America","Eagle_Scout_rank_(Boy_Scouts_of_America)","Columbia_High_School_(New_Jersey)","Biology","Botany","Zoology","Botany","Stevens_Institute_of_Technology","Bowdoin_College","Entomology","Zeta_Psi","Phi_Beta_Kappa","Magna_cum_laude","Biology","Psychology","Harvard_University","Bussey_Institute","William_Morton_Wheeler","Entomology","Gall_wasp","Sc.D.","Harvard_University","American_Museum_of_Natural_History","Phylogeny","Merritt_Lyndon_Fernald","Bussey_Institute","Arnold_Arboretum","Clara_Bracken_McMillen","Juvenile_diabetes","Bisexual","Polyamorous","Vinegar_Hill_Historic_District","Gardening","Sexology","Gall_wasp","Kinsey_Scale","Heterosexuality","Homosexuality","Asexuality","Rockefeller_Foundation","Kinsey_Reports","Jonathan_Gathorne-Hardy","Orgasm","Paul_Gebhard","Martha_Raye","Cole_Porter","Too_Darn_Hot","Mae_West","Pneumonia","Sexual_Behavior_in_the_Human_Female","Television","The_Jack_Benny_Program","Cruise_ship","Hawaii","Jack_Benny","Clyde_Martin","Joseph_Jefferson_Awards","Biographical_film","Bill_Condon","Liam_Neeson","Laura_Linney","T._Coraghessan_Boyle","Public_Broadcasting_Service","Kinsey_Institute_for_Research_in_Sex,_Gender_and_Reproduction","BBC","Kinsey_Reports","Judith_Reisman","Hoboken,_New_Jersey","New_Jersey","Bloomington,_Indiana","Indiana"]}
