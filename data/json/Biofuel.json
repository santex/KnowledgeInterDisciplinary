Biofuels include fuels derived from biomass conversion, as well as\nsolid biomass, liquid fuels and various biogases. Biofuels are\ngaining increased public and scientific attention, driven by factors such as oil\nprice hikes and the need for increased energy security. However, according to\nthe European Environment Agency, biofuels address global warming concerns only\nin specific cases. [http://www.eea.europa.eu/about-us/governance/scientific-\ncommittee/sc-opinions/opinions-on-scientific-issues/sc-opinion-on-greenhouse-gas\nOpinion of the EEA Scientific Committee on Greenhouse Gas Accounting in Relation\nto Bioenergy]\n\nBioethanol is an alcohol made by fermentation, mostly from carbohydrates\nproduced in sugar or starch crops such as corn or sugarcane. Cellulosic biomass,\nderived from non-food sources, such as trees and grasses, is also being\ndeveloped as a feedstock for ethanol production. Ethanol can be used as a fuel\nfor vehicles in its pure form, but it is usually used as a gasoline additive to\nincrease octane and improve vehicle emissions. Bioethanol is widely used in the\nUSA and in Brazil. Current plant design does not provide for converting the\nlignin portion of plant raw materials to fuel components by fermentation.\n\nBiodiesel is made from vegetable oils and animal fats. Biodiesel can be used as\na fuel for vehicles in its pure form, but it is usually used as a diesel\nadditive to reduce levels of particulates, carbon monoxide, and hydrocarbons\nfrom diesel-powered vehicles. Biodiesel is produced from oils or fats using\ntransesterification and is the most common biofuel in Europe.\n\nIn 2010, worldwide biofuel production reached 105 billion liters (28 billion\ngallons US), up 17% from 2009, and biofuels\nprovided 2.7% of the world's fuels for road transport, a contribution largely\nmade up of ethanol and biodiesel. Global ethanol fuel production reached 86\nbillion liters (23 billion gallons US) in 2010, with the United States and\nBrazil as the world's top producers, accounting together for 90% of global\nproduction. The world's largest biodiesel producer is the European Union,\naccounting for 53% of all biodiesel production in 2010.\nAs of 2011, mandates for blending biofuels exist in 31 countries at the national\nlevel and in 29 states or provinces. According to the\nInternational Energy Agency, biofuels have the potential to meet more than a\nquarter of world demand for transportation fuels by 2050.\n\n__TOC__\n","linknr":1641,"url":"Biofuel","recorded":1362508854,"links":120,"instances":["nrel","farming"],"pdf":["http://www.ren21.net/Portals/97/documents/GSR/GSR2011_Master18.pdf","http://www.ren21.net/Portals/97/documents/GSR/GSR2011_Master18.pdf","http://www.ascension-publishing.com/BIZ/HD50.pdf","http://www.ascension-publishing.com/BIZ/HD50.pdf","http://www.pnnl.gov/main/publications/external/technical_reports/PNNL-20279.pdf","http://www.pnnl.gov/main/publications/external/technical_reports/PNNL-20279.pdf","http://www.europarl.europa.eu/registre/docs_autres_institutions/commission_europeenne/sec/2007/0055/COM_SEC(2007)0055_EN.pdf","http://www.europarl.europa.eu/registre/docs_autres_institutions/commission_europeenne/sec/2007/0055/COM_SEC(2007)0055_EN.pdf","http://ictsd.org/downloads/2011/12/the-impact-of-us-biofuel-policies-on-agricultural-price-levels-and-volatility.pdf","http://www1.eere.energy.gov/biomass/pdfs/mustard_hybrids.pdf","http://www1.eere.energy.gov/biomass/pdfs/mustard_hybrids.pdf","http://www.ethanol.org/pdf/contentmgmt/USDA_DOE_biofuels_letter_61208.pdf","http://www.ethanol.org/pdf/contentmgmt/USDA_DOE_biofuels_letter_61208.pdf","http://www.nrel.gov/biomass/pdfs/40742.pdf","http://www.nrel.gov/biomass/pdfs/40742.pdf","http://www.nrel.gov/docs/legosti/fy98/24190.pdf","http://www.nrel.gov/docs/legosti/fy98/24190.pdf","http://www.fern.org/sites/fern.org/files/Biomass%20imports%20to%20the%20EU%20final_0.pdf","http://scc.com.pl/konferencje/prezentacje/BPKL_22-23-03-2012/05%20Andrzej%20Rubczynski.pdf","http://www.europarl.europa.eu/registre/docs_autres_institutions/commission_europeenne/sec/2007/0055/COM_SEC(2007)0055_EN.pdf","http://www.unep.fr/scp/rpanel/pdf/Assessing_Biofuels_Full_Report.pdf","http://www.iea.org/textbase/nppdf/free/2004/biofuels2004.pdf","http://css.snre.umich.edu/css_doc/CSS08-09.pdf"],"categories":["Anaerobic
