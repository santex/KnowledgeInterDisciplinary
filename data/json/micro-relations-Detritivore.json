Wetzel, R. G. 2001.\nLimnology: Lake and River Ecosystems. Academic Press. 3rd. p.700. By doing\nso, they contribute to decomposition and the nutrient cycles. They should be\ndistinguished from other decomposers, such as many species of bacteria, fungi\nand protists, which are unable to ingest discrete lumps of matter, but instead\nlive by absorbing and metabolizing on a molecular scale. However, the terms\n'detritivore' and 'decomposer' are often used interchangeably.\n\n in most environments, illustrated here [[Mycena interrupta]]. Only fungi\n produce the enzymes necessary to decompose lignin, a chemically complex\n substance found in wood.]] Detritivores are an important aspect of many\n ecosystems. They can live on any soil with an organic component, including\n marine ecosystems, where they are termed interchangeably with bottom feeders.\n\nTypical detritivorous animals include millipedes, woodlice, dung flies, slugs,\nmany terrestrial worms, sea stars, sea cucumbers, fiddler crabs, and some\nsedentary polychaetes such as amphitrites (Amphitritinae, worms of the family\nterebellidae) and other terebellids.\n\nScavengers are typically not thought to be detritivores, as they generally eat\nlarge quantities of organic matter, but both detritivores and scavengers are\nspecific cases of consumer-resource systems. Getz, W. (2011). Biomass\ntransformation webs provide a unified approach to consumerâresource modelling.\nEcology Letters, . The eating of wood, whether live or dead, is known as\nxylophagy. Î¤he activity of animals feeding only on dead wood is called sapro-\nxylophagy and those animals, sapro-xylophagous.\n","linknr":522,"url":"Detritivore","recorded":1362509536,"links":56,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://globalecology.stanford.edu/DGE/CIWDGE/SCOPE%20Books%20Web%20Archive/SCOPE%2033/SCOPE_33_2.06_Tenore_191-206.pdf","http://www.mssf.org/mnews/0603mn.pdf"],"categories":["Detritivores|","Eating behaviors","Microbial growth and nutrition","Mycology","Soil biology"],"headings":["Ecology","Saprophytes","Saprophages","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/Earthworm.jpg/250px-Earthworm.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/16/Mycena_interrupta.jpg/250px-Mycena_interrupta.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5f/Starling_Feeding_Offspring.jpg/160px-Starling_Feeding_Offspring.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b3/FoodWeb.jpg/140px-FoodWeb.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Genomics_GTL_Program_Payoffs.jpg/140px-Genomics_GTL_Program_Payoffs.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Heterotroph","Nutrient","Detritus","Feces","Decomposition","Nutrient_cycles","Decomposer","Bacteria","Fungi","Protist","Ecosystem","Marine_ecosystems","Bottom_feeder","Millipede","Woodlouse","Scathophagidae","Slug","Worm","Sea_stars","Sea_cucumbers","Fiddler_crabs","Polychaete","Terebellidae","Terebellida","Scavenger","Consumer-resource_systems","Xylophagy","Food_webs","Decomposers","Heterotroph","Energy_flow","Biogeochemical_cycles","Woodland","Bottom-feeder","Benthos","Benthic","Food_chain","Nitrogen_cycle","Scientific_Committee_on_Problems_of_the_Environment","Carboniferous_period","Lignin","Fossil_fuel","Feeding","Toxic","Pollutant","Embryophytes","Plant","Orchidaceae","Monotropaceae","Parasite","Myco-heterotrophy","Decomposer","Saprotrophic_nutrition","Consumer-resource_systems"]}
