{"cursor":"3682","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'James E. \"Jim\" Bohannon' (born January 7, 1944) [http://www.nndb.com/people/078/000120715/ Jim Bohannon ] is an American broadcaster who has worked in both\ntelevision and radio.\n\nDuring the 1980s he was a fill-in for Larry King when King had his popular\nnighttime national radio program. He also does much work with the Smithsonian\nAssociates. He was inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame in 2003.\n\nBohannon took over as permanent host during Larry King's late night time slot on\nJanuary 29, 1993, when King moved his radio show to the afternoon. His radio\nprogram is called the Jim Bohannon Show, which is heard on over 300 affiliate\nradio stations nationwide and is produced by Dial Global (successor to Westwood\nOne, itself the successor to the Mutual Broadcasting System, Larry King's\noriginal radio network). He broadcasts from Washington, D.C., where WFED (as\nsuccessor to the now defunct [[Washington Post Radio]]) is considered his\nflagship station today.\n\nThe show airs Monday through Friday from 10:00 PM to 1:00 AM Eastern\nTime (02:00 to 05:00 UTC during daylight saving time, 03:00 to 06:00 UTC during\nstandard time). Each segment of the show features guests for interviews and\ncalls from listeners. His show usually deals with politics and popular culture.\nIn the event that Bohannon is not hosting that night's show, a substitute host\n(chosen by Dial Global) takes his place. Substitute hosts have historically\nvaried in nature and political views greatly; past substitute hosts include\nconservative talk host and comedian Dennis Miller, progressive talk host Leslie\nMarshall, and comedienne Joan Rivers.\n\nAt the beginning of each hour is bumper music and the music for the start of\neach hour is specially designed to inform the listener of who the show host is.\n\nJim Bohannon also hosts two other Dial Global radio programs: America in the\nMorning, a news-magazine that airs live Monday through Friday from 5:00 AM to\n6:00 AM ET (10:00 to 11:00 UTC during standard time, 09:00 to 10:00 UTC during\ndaylight saving time), and the weekend news-magazine America This Week.\n\nBohannon's political views, as stated on air, lean toward being moderate and/or\nslightly conservative. Bohannon has stated that he is a registered Democrat for\nthe purposes of voting in primary elections.\n\nBohannon also occasionally serves as a booth announcer for CBS-TV's [[Face the\nNation]]. He also does voice announcements for the satellite feeds of some Dial\nGlobal programs, such as The Dennis Miller Show.\n\nBohannon was born in Lebanon, Missouri, and is a Vietnam veteran.\n[http://www.pearlharborhero.net/medal_efforts.html Medal Efforts
