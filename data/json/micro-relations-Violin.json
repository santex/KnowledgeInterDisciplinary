It is the smallest, highest-pitched member of the violin family of\nstring instruments, which also includes the viola and cello.\n\nThe violin is sometimes informally called a fiddle, regardless of the type of\nmusic played on it. The word violin comes from the Medieval Latin word vitula,\nmeaning stringed instrument; {{Cite web\n|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=viola&searchmode=none\n|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary |title=Etymology of viola|accessdate=2008-09-\n26 }} this word is also believed to be the source of the Germanic\n\"fiddle\". {{Cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=fiddle\n|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary |title=Etymology of fiddle|accessdate=2010-12-\n03}} The violin, while it has ancient origins, acquired most of its modern\ncharacteristics in 16th-century Italy, with some further modifications occurring\nin the 18th and 19th centuries. Violinists and collectors particularly prize the\ninstruments made by the Gasparo da SalÃ², Giovanni Paolo Maggini, Stradivari,\nGuarneri and Amati families from the 16th to the 18th century in Brescia and\nCremona and by Jacob Stainer in Austria. Great numbers of instruments have come\nfrom the hands of \"lesser\" makers, as well as still greater numbers of mass-\nproduced commercial \"trade violins\" coming from cottage industries in places\nsuch as Saxony, Bohemia, and Mirecourt. Many of these trade instruments were\nformerly sold by Sears, Roebuck and Co. and other mass merchandisers.\n\nA person who makes or repairs violins is called a luthier. The parts of a violin\nare usually made from different types of wood (although electric violins may not\nbe made of wood at all, since their sound may not be dependent on specific\nacoustic characteristics of the instrument's construction), and it is usually\nstrung with gut, nylon or other synthetic, or steel strings.\n\nSomeone who plays the violin is called a violinist or a fiddler. The violinist\nproduces sound by drawing a bow across one or more strings (which may be\nstopped by the fingers of the other hand to produce a full range of pitches),\nby plucking the strings (with either hand), or by a variety of other\ntechniques. The violin is played by musicians in a wide variety of musical\ngenres, including Baroque music, classical, jazz, folk music, rock and roll,\nand Soft rock. The violin has come to be played in many non-Western music\ncultures all over the world.\n","linknr":1051,"url":"Violin","recorded":1362481518,"links":156,"instances":["music","music","music_technology","band","music","band","band","bowstroke","music","band","music","music","paganini","horse","wood","music","rock_song","violin","physics","music","violin","music","bow_stroke","band","music","violinist","music","instrument","music","band","music","liszt","band","music"],"pdf":["http://www.media.mit.edu/~young/publications/Young_Dissertation_2007.pdf"],"categories":["Violins|","Carnatic
