{"cursor":"8403","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The 'chain pump' is type of a water pump in which several circular discs are\npositioned on an endless chain. One part of the chain dips in to the water, and\nthe chain runs through a tube, slightly bigger than the diameter of the discs.\nAs the chain is drawn up the tube, water becomes trapped between the discs and\nis lifted to and discharged at the top. Chain pumps were used for centuries in\nthe ancient Middle East, Europe, China, and ancient Egypt.\n","linknr":218,"url":"Chain_pumps","recorded":1362476867,"links":13,"instances":["geometry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Pumps","Traditional Chinese objects","Hydraulics"],"headings":["In the Middle East and Rome","Square-pallet in China","See also","Notes","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/Al-Jazari_Automata_1205.jpg/220px-Al-Jazari_Automata_1205.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf8/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/10/Tiangong_Kaiwu_Chain_Pumps.jpg/220px-Tiangong_Kaiwu_Chain_Pumps.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf8/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cylinder","geometry"]],"members":["cylinder"],"related":["Pump","Middle_East","Europe","China","Ancient_Egypt","Hydropower","Babylonia","Ecclesiastes","Joseph_Needham","Ancient_Egypt","Gear","Donald_Routledge_Hill","Ancient_Rome","Philo_of_Byzantium","Vitruvius","Nemi_ships","Lake_Nemi","Inventions_in_the_Islamic_world","Timeline_of_Muslim_scientists_and_engineers","Islamic_Golden_Age","Flywheel","Floruit","Al-Andalus","Ahmad_Y_Hassan","Al-Jazari","Reservoir","Water_wheel","Ox","Hydropower","Crankshaft","Donald_Routledge_Hill","Routledge","Intermittency","Hydropower","Manual_labour","Damascus","Ahmad_Y_Hassan","Renaissance","Mineralogy","Georg_Agricola","Portsmouth_Block_Mills","Song_Yingxing","China","Philosophy","Wang_Chong","Hydraulics","Water_wheel","Ox","Irrigation","Public_works","Eunuch","Zhang_Rang","Luoyang","Palace","Luoyang","Ma_Jun","Mechanical_engineering","Three_Kingdoms","Garden","Cao_Rui","Windmill","Islam","Song_Yingxing","Cylinder_(geometry)","Airlift_pump","Chain_drive","Rope_pump","Su_Song","Pipeline_transport"]}
