Jung\nproposed and developed the concepts of the extraverted and the introverted\npersonality, archetypes, and the collective unconscious. His work has been\ninfluential in psychiatry and in the study of religion, literature, and\nrelated fields.\n\nThe central concept of analytical psychology is individuation – the\npsychological process of integrating the opposites, including the conscious with\nthe unconscious, while still maintaining their relative\nautonomy.<ref>[[Memories, Dreams, Reflections]], p. 209.</ref> Jung considered\nindividuation to be the central process of human development.<ref name=\"Jung's\nIndividuation process\">[http://soultherapynow.com/articles/individuation.html\nJung's Individuation process] Retrieved on 2009-2-20</ref>\n\nJung created some of the best known psychological concepts, including the\narchetype, the collective unconscious, the complex, and synchronicity. The Myers-\nBriggs Type Indicator (MBTI), a popular psychometric instrument, has been\ndeveloped from Jung's theories.\n\nJung saw the human psyche as \"by nature religious\",<ref>Aniela Jaffe, foreword\nto Memories, Dreams, Reflections, [http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search-\n?q=cache:j_6ig56piEUJ:www.archive.org/stream/memoriesdreamsre007394mbp/memories-\ndreamsre007394mbp_djvu.txt+%22by%20nature%20religious%22&hl=en p. x].</ref> and\nmade this religiousness the focus of his explorations.<ref></ref> Jung is one of\nthe best known contemporary contributors to dream analysis and symbolization.\n\nThough he was a practicing clinician and considered himself to be a\nscientist,<ref name=\"Lachmanpage258\" /> much of his life's work was spent\nexploring tangential areas, including Eastern and Western philosophy, alchemy,\nastrology, and sociology, as well as literature and the arts.
