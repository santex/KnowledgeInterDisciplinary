{"cursor":"6137","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Artificial flowers' are imitations of natural flowering plants, used for\ncommercial or residential decoration. They are sometimes made for scientific\npurposes (the collection of glass flowers at Harvard University, for example,\nwhich illustrates the flora of the United States.)\n\nMaterials used in their manufacture have included painted linen and shavings of\nstained horn in Egypt, gold and silver in ancient Rome, rice-paper in China,\nsilkworm cocoons in Italy, colored feathers in South America, and also wax and\ntinted shells. Modern techniques involve carved or formed soap, nylon netting\nstretched over wire frames, ground clay, and mass-produced injection plastic\nmouldings. Polyester is the major material for manufacturing of artificial\nflowers since 1970s. Most artificial flowers in the market nowadays are made of\npolyester fabrics.\n","linknr":139,"url":"Artificial_flower","recorded":1362673577,"links":24,"instances":["tool","plants"],"pdf":["http://www.ethnobotanyjournal.org/vol5/I1547-3465-05-159.pdf"],"categories":["Flowers|Artificial"],"headings":["Production","Simulacraceae","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/Artificial_flowers_bouquet_oldfashioned.jpg/220px-Artificial_flowers_bouquet_oldfashioned.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c4/Paper_flowers_in_vase.jpg/220px-Paper_flowers_in_vase.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/Rosenstrau%C3%9F_aus_Seidenblumen_und_pr%C3%A4parierten_Rosen.JPG/220px-Rosenstrau%C3%9F_aus_Seidenblumen_und_pr%C3%A4parierten_Rosen.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["flora","plants"],["lathe","tool"]],"members":["lathe","flora"],"related":["Glass_Flowers","Harvard_University","Flora_(plants)","Egypt","Ancient_Rome","Rice-paper","China","Silkworm","Italy","South_America","Animal_shell","Goffering_irons","Origami","Silk","United_States","NFPA_701","ASTM","Lathe_(tool)","Injection_moulding","Simulacraceae"]}
