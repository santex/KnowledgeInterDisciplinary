The word\n'polyhedron' comes from the Classical Greek ÏÎ¿Î»ÏÎµÎ´ÏÎ¿Î½, as poly- (stem of ÏÎ¿Î»ÏÏ,\n\"many\") + -hedron (form of Î­Î´ÏÎ±, \"base\", \"seat\", or \"face\").\n\nA polyhedron is a 3-dimensional example of the more general polytope in any\nnumber of dimensions.\n","linknr":833,"url":"Polyhedron","recorded":1362665961,"links":90,"instances":["graph_theory","geometry","polyhedron","graphical","geometry","topology","topology","geometry","geometry","geometry","geometry","mathematics","mathematics","geometry","mathematics","mathematics","geometry","geometry","mathematician","mathematician","geometry"],"pdf":["http://www.math.washington.edu/~grunbaum/Your%20polyhedra-my%20polyhedra.pdf","http://www.cgl.uwaterloo.ca/~csk/washington/tile/papers/kaplan_hart_bridges2001.pdf"],"categories":["Polyhedra|*"],"headings":["Basis
