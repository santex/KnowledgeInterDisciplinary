{"cursor":"49334","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n, champion cricketer and co-founder of Australian rules football]] This is a\nlisting of players to have played both Australian rules football in the nation's\npremier leagues 'and' first-class cricket or higher. These leagues are the\nAustralian Football League (AFL), formerly the VFL, West Australian Football\nLeague (WAFL) and South Australian National Football League (SANFL). First-class\ncricketers who played football in other states are eligible if they had a\nnotable career in that state's top league.\n\nIn the early years of the VFL it was quite common for footballers to play\ndistrict cricket over the summer months, some of them even made their state\nsides and others represented Australia. Likewise cricketers would often play\nfootball in the off season to keep fit and if good enough would appear in their\nstate's best league.\n\nPlayers are divided into the lists below by which state they spent the majority\nof their sporting career or in come cases their state or origin.\n","linknr":1024,"url":"List_of_Australian_rules_football_and_cricket_players","recorded":1375058853,"links":["/w/index.php?title=List_of_Australian_rules_footballers_and_cricketers&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=List_of_Australian_rules_footballers_and_cricketers&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","/wiki/List_of_Australian_rules_footballers_and_cricketers","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","/w/index.php?title=List_of_Australian_rules_football_and_cricket_players&redirect=no","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Tom_Wills_1857.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/Tom_Wills_1857.jpg/220px-Tom_Wills_1857.jpg","/wiki/File:Tom_Wills_1857.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Tom_Wills","/wiki/Australian_rules_football","/wiki/First-class_cricket","/wiki/Australian_Football_League","/wiki/West_Australian_Football_League","/wiki/South_Australian_National_Football_League","#International_cricketers_who_played_interstate_football","#International_cricketers_who_played_league_football","#State_cricketers_who_played_interstate_football","#Queensland","#South_Australia","#Tasmania","#Victoria","#Western_Australia","#First-class_cricketers_who_played_league_football","#South_Australia_2","#Tasmania_2","#Victoria_2","#Western_Australia_2","#References","/w/index.php?title=List_of_Australian_rules_footballers_and_cricketers&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Eric_Freeman_(cricketer)","/wiki/Port_Adelaide_Football_Club","http://www.fullpointsfooty.net/f.htm#Eric%20Freeman%20(Port%20Adelaide)","/wiki/Test_cricket","/wiki/Neil_Hawke","/wiki/Port_Adelaide_Football_Club","/wiki/East_Perth_Football_Club","/wiki/West_Torrens_Football_Club","http://www.fullpointsfooty.net/h.htm#Neil%20Hawke%20(Port%20Adelaide,%20East%20Perth,%20West%20Torrens)","/wiki/Test_cricket","/wiki/Clem_Hill","/wiki/South_Adelaide_Football_Club","http://www.fullpointsfooty.net/hi-hz.htm#Clem%20Hill%20(South%20Adelaide)","/wiki/Test_cricket","/wiki/Ernie_Jones_(Australian_sportsman)","/wiki/South_Adelaide_Football_Club","/wiki/North_Adelaide_Football_Club","/wiki/Port_Adelaide_Football_Club","http://www.fullpointsfooty.net/i-j.htm#Ernest%20Jones%20(South%20Adelaide,%20North%20Adelaide,%20Port%20Adelaide)","/wiki/Test_cricket","/wiki/Gil_Langley","/wiki/Sturt_Football_Club","/wiki/Essendon_Football_Club","http://stats.rleague.com/afl/stats/players/G/Gil_Langley.html","/wiki/Test_cricket","/wiki/Philip_Lee_(cricketer)","/wiki/Norwood_Football_Club","http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/46220702","/wiki/Test_cricket","/wiki/Keith_Miller","/wiki/St_Kilda_Football_Club","http://stats.rleague.com/afl/stats/players/K/Keith_Miller0.html","/wiki/Test_cricket","/wiki/Laurie_Nash","/wiki/Sydney_Swans","http://stats.rleague.com/afl/stats/players/L/Laurie_Nash.html","/wiki/Test_cricket","/wiki/John_Reedman","/wiki/South_Adelaide_Football_Club","/wiki/North_Adelaide_Football_Club","http://www.fullpointsfooty.net/r.htm#Jack%20Reedman%20(South%20Adelaide,%20North%20Adelaide,%20West%20Adelaide)","/wiki/Test_cricket","/wiki/Vic_Richardson","/wiki/Sturt_Football_Club","http://www.fullpointsfooty.net/r.htm#Victor%20Richardson%20(Sturt)","/wiki/Test_cricket","/wiki/Keith_Slater","/wiki/Swan_Districts_Football_Club","/wiki/Subiaco_Football_Club","http://www.fullpointsfooty.net/sh–sm.htm#Keith%20Slater%20(Swan%20Districts%20&%20Subiaco)","/wiki/Test_cricket","/wiki/David_Smith_(sportsman)","/wiki/Essendon_Football_Club","http://stats.rleague.com/afl/stats/players/D/Dave_Smith.html","/wiki/Test_cricket","/w/index.php?title=List_of_Australian_rules_footballers_and_cricketers&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Warwick_Armstrong","/wiki/Sydney_Swans","http://stats.rleague.com/afl/stats/players/W/Warwick_Armstrong.html","/wiki/Test_cricket","/wiki/Barlow_Carkeek","/wiki/Essendon_Football_Club","http://stats.rleague.com/afl/stats/players/W/William_Carkeek.html","/wiki/Test_cricket","/wiki/George_Giffen","/wiki/Norwood_Football_Club","http://www.fullpointsfooty.net/woodville_(original).htm","/wiki/Test_cricket","/wiki/Harry_Graham_(cricketer)","/wiki/Melbourne_Football_Club","http://stats.rleague.com/afl/stats/players/H/Harry_Graham.html","/wiki/Test_cricket","/wiki/Albert_Hartkopf","/wiki/Melbourne_U
