The specific goals and demands of\nthe movement are: accessibility and safety in transportation, architecture, and\nthe physical environment, equal opportunities in independent living, employment,\neducation, and housing, and freedom from abuse, neglect, and violations of\npatients' rights. [http://www.disabilityrightswi.org/priority-\nissues/abuse-neglect-and-patient-rights Abuse, Neglect and Patient Rights by the\nDisability Rights Wisconsin website] Effective civil rights legislation is\nsought in order to secure these opportunities and rights.\n\n\n\nFor people with physical disabilities accessibility and safety are primary\nissues that this movement works to reform. Access to public areas such as city\nstreets and public buildings and restrooms are some of the more visible changes\nbrought about in recent decades. A noticeable change in some parts of the world\nis the installation of elevators, automatic doors, wide doors and corridors,\ntransit lifts, wheelchair ramps, curb cuts, and the elimination of unnecessary\nsteps where ramps and elevators are not available, allowing people in\nwheelchairs and with other mobility impairments to use public sidewalks and\npublic transit more easily and more safely.\n","linknr":504,"url":"Disability_rights_movement","recorded":1362575088,"links":31,"instances":["disability_rights","activist"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Disability rights"],"headings":["Overview","History","Exhibitions and Collections","See also","External links","Further reading","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/eb/Handicapped_Accessible_sign.svg/16px-Handicapped_Accessible_sign.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/5c/Symbol_template_class.svg/16px-Symbol_template_class.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/5c/Symbol_template_class.svg/16px-Symbol_template_class.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/Disclogo1.svg/10px-Disclogo1.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d5/Disablemarker.jpg/250px-Disablemarker.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/47/Sound-icon.svg/45px-Sound-icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/47/Sound-icon.svg/15px-Sound-icon.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["american_civil_rights_movement","1955-1968"],["ed_roberts","activist"],["inclusion","disability_rights"]],"members":["american_civil_rights_movement","inclusion","ed_roberts"],"related":["Disability","Accessibility","Safety","Elevator","Elevator","Wheelchair_ramp","Curb_cut","Wheelchair","Public_transit","Developmental_disabilities","Workforce","Self-advocacy","Mental_illnesses","Self-determination","Independent_Living","Institutionalisation","Independent_living","Self-advocacy","Intellectual_disabilities","Mental_health","Education","Employment","Adaptive_technology","Independence","Education","American_Civil_Rights_Movement_(1955-1968)","Second-wave_feminism","Timothy_J._Nugent","Independent_living_movement","California","Ed_Roberts_(activist)","Rehabilitation_Act","HEW","Frank_Bowe","American_Coalition_of_Citizens_with_Disabilities","Rehabilitation_Act","Joseph_Califano","Frank_Bowe","Judith_Heumann","Americans_with_Disabilities_Act","Rehabilitation_Act","Atlantis_Community","ADAPT","Americans_with_Disabilities_Act","Deaf_President_Now","Gallaudet_University","I._King_Jordan","Americans_with_Disabilities_Act","United_Kingdom","Disability_Discrimination_Act_1995","Equality_and_Human_Rights_Commission","Northern_Ireland","Northern_Ireland_Equality_Commission","Americans_with_Disabilities_Act","Smithsonian_Institution","National_Museum_of_American_History","George_H.W._Bush","Wheelchair","Ableism","Accessibility_for_Ontarians_with_Disabilities_Act,_2005","Architectural_Barriers_Act_of_1968","Big_Apple_Pothole_and_Sidewalk_Protection_Committee","Convention_on_the_Rights_of_Persons_with_Disabilities","Declaration_on_the_Rights_of_Disabled_Persons","Inclusion_(disability_rights)","Independent_living","List_of_disability_rights_activists","List_of_disability_rights_organizations","Medical_model_of_disability","Nothing_About_Us_Without_Us","Person_Centred_Planning","Section_504","Social_model_of_disability","Transgenerational_design","Visitability","Access_Now_v._Southwest_Airlines","Mills_vs._Board_of_Education_of_District_of_Columbia","Universal_Design","Independent_Lens","Public_Broadcasting_Service","Community_Alliance_for_the_Ethical_Treatment_of_Youth","Jo_Freeman"]}
