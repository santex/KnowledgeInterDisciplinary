He became\nprofessed as an Augustinian in 1778, but owing to his turbulent character he\nspent a great part of his time in prison,and was constantly being transferred\nfrom one convent to another, finally giving up the monastic habit to live\nlicentiously in the capital.\n\nIn 1792 he was unfrocked, but by the aid of powerful friends he obtained a papal\nbrief which secularized him and permitted him to retain his ecclesiastical\nstatus. Taking to journalism and preaching he now made for himself a substantial\nliving and a unique position. In a short time he was recognized as the leading\npulpit orator of the day, and in 1802 he became one of the royal preachers.\n\nMacedo was the first to introduce from abroad and to cultivate didactic and\ndescriptive poetry, the best example of which is his notable transcendental poem\nMeditation (1813). His colossal egotism made him attempt to supersede LuÃ­s de\nCamÃµes as Portugal's greatest poet, and in 1814 he produced Oriente, an insipid\nepic notwithstanding its correct and vigorous verse, dealing with the same\nsubject as the [[Os LusÃ­adas]], namely Vasco da Gama's discovery of the sea\nroute to India. This amended paraphrase met with a cold reception, whereupon\nMacedo published his Censura dos Lusiadas, containing a minute examination and\nvirulent indictment of CamÃµes.\n\nMacedo founded and wrote for a large number of journals, and the tone and temper\nof these and his political pamphlets induced his leading biographer to name him\nthe chief libeller of Portugal, though at the time his jocular and satirical\nstyle gained him popular favor. An extreme adherent of absolutism, he expended\nall his brilliant powers of invective against the Constitutionalists, and\nadvocated a general massacre of the opponents of the Miguelist rÃ©gime.\nNotwithstanding hispriestly office and old age, he continued his aggressive\njournalistic campaign, until his own party, feeling that he was damaging the\ncause by his excesses, threatened him with proceedings, which caused him in 1829\nto resign the post of censor of books for the Ordinary, to which he had been\nappointed in 1824.\n\nThough his ingratitude was proverbial, and his moral character of the worst,\nwhen he died in 1831 he left behind him many friends, a host of admirers, and a\ngreat but ephemeral literary reputation. His ambition to rank as the king of\nletters led to his famous conflict with Bocage, whose poem Pena de Taliao was\nperhaps the hardest blow Macedo ever received. His malignity reached its height\nin a satirical poem in six cantos, Os Burros (1812-1814), in which he pilloried\nby name men and women of all grades of society, living and dead, with the utmost\nlicence of expression. His translation of the Odes of Horace, and his dramatic\nattempts, are only of value as evidence of the extraordinary versatility of the\nman, but his treatise, if his it be, A Demonstration of the Existence of God, at\nleast proves his possession of very high mental powers. As a poet, his odes on\nWellington and the emperor Alexander show true inspiration, and the poems of the\nsame nature in his Lyra anacreontica, addressed to his mistress, have\nconsiderable merit.\n\nSee Memorias pans la vida intima de Jos+e Agostinho de Macedo (ed.
