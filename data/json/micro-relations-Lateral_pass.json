{"cursor":"5997","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In American football, a 'lateral pass' or 'lateral', officially 'backward pass'\n('onside pass' in Canadian football), occurs when the ball carrier throws the\nfootball to any teammate behind him or directly next to him (i.e. on or behind a\nline running through the ball and parallel to the line of scrimmage). A lateral\npass is distinguished from a forward pass, in which the ball is thrown forward,\ntowards the opposition's end zone. In a lateral pass the ball is not advanced,\nbut unlike a forward pass a lateral may be attempted from anywhere on the field\nby any player to any player at any time.\n\nWhile the forward pass is an invention of the North American game, the lateral\nand backward pass is also a part of rugby union and rugby league, where such\npasses are much more common. Compared to its use in rugby, laterals and backward\npasses are less common in North American football, due to a much greater focus\non ball control in American football strategy; they are most commonly used by\nthe quarterback, after taking the snap, to quickly transfer (\"pitch\") the ball a\nshort distance to a nearby running back (or, rarely, wide receiver) on a rushing\nplay. Laterals are also often seen as part of a last-minute desperation strategy\nor as part of a trick play.\n","linknr":342,"url":"Lateral_pass","recorded":1362579791,"links":13,"instances":["american_football","texas","gridiron_football","american_football","american_football","gridiron_football","american_football","ncaa","football"],"pdf":[],"categories":["American football plays"],"headings":["Rules","Alternate uses","Famous plays in history","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["snap","gridiron_football"],["rush","gridiron_football"],["down","american_football"],["neutral_zone","american_football"],["big_game","football"],["kickoff","american_football"],["john_carney","american_football"],["division_iii","ncaa"],["trinity_university","texas"]],"members":["kickoff","trinity_university","rush","neutral_zone","john_carney","snap","down","division_iii","big_game"],"related":["American_football","Canadian_football","Line_of_scrimmage","Forward_pass","End_zone","Rugby_union","Rugby_league","American_football_strategy","Quarterback","Snap_(gridiron_football)","Running_back","Wide_receiver","Rush_(gridiron_football)","Trick_play","Down_(American_football)","Neutral_zone_(American_football)","Fumble","Interception","Hook_and_lateral","The_Play","Big_Game_(football)","Stanford_Cardinal_football","California_Golden_Bears_football","Kickoff_(American_football)","Stanford_Band","Forward_pass","Music_City_Miracle","Tennessee_Titans","Buffalo_Bills","NFL","River_City_Relay","New_Orleans_Saints","Jacksonville_Jaguars","Touchdown","Placekicker","John_Carney_(American_football)","Extra_point","Division_III_(NCAA)","Trinity_University_(Texas)","Millsaps_College","2007_Trinity_vs._Millsaps_football_game"]}
