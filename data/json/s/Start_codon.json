Specific sequences of DNA act as a template to\nsynthesize mRNA.\n\nThe start codon is the first codon of a messenger RNA (mRNA) transcript\ntranslated by a ribosome. The start codon always codes for methionine in\neukaryotes and a modified Met (fMet) in prokaryotes. The most common start\ncodon is AUG.\n\nThe start codon is almost always preceded by an untranslated region 5' UTR. In\nprokaryotes this includes the ribosome binding site.\n\nAlternate start codons (non ATG) are very rare in eukaryote's nuclear genome.\nMitochondrial genomes and prokaryotes use alternate start codons more\nsignificantly (mainly GUG and UUG). For example E. coli uses 83% ATG (AUG)\n(3542/4284), 14% (612) GTG (GUG), 3% (103) TTG (UUG)  and one or two\nothers (e.g., an ATT and possibly a CTG). Bioinformatics programs usually allow for alternate start\ncodons when searching for protein coding genes.\n\nNote that these alternate start codons are still translated as Met when they are\nat the start of a protein (even if the codon encodes a different amino acid\notherwise). This is because a separate transfer RNA (tRNA) is used for\ninitiation.\n\nWell-known coding regions that do not have ATG initiation codons are those of\nlacI (GTG) [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/146575?itemID=6&report=gbwi-\nthparts#feature_146575 E.coli lactose operon with lacI, lacZ, lacY and lacA\ngenes GenBank: J01636.1] and\nlacA (TTG) [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/viewer.fcgi?val=146575&itemI-\nD=4&view=gbwithparts#feature_146575 NCBI Sequence Viewer v2.0 ] in the [[E. coli]] lac operon.\n","linknr":315,"url":"Start_codon","recorded":1362483970,"links":26,"instances":["biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["DNA","Molecular genetics"],"headings":["See also","External links","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["translation","biology"]],"members":["translation"],"related":["Central_dogma_of_molecular_biology","Translation_(biology)","Gene","Protein","DNA","Codon","Messenger_RNA","Ribosome","Methionine","Eukaryote","Prokaryotes","5'_UTR","Prokaryotes","E._coli","Transfer_RNA","Lac_operon","Stop_codon","Codon","Transfer_RNA","Central_Dogma_of_Molecular_Biology"]}
