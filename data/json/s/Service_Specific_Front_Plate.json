The faceplate is easy-to-fit and no rewiring is\nrequired as the faceplate fits in between the existing front lower faceplate and\nthe rear of the NTE5 socket. Centralised ADSL filtering is then provided,\nnegating the need for plug-in microfilters with an RJ45/RJ11 socket providing\nthe connection for a modem/router. Alternatively, provision is made for a hard-\nwired connection to the modem via a two-way IDC connector on the front.\n\nThe latest VDSL faceplate filter from BT/Openreach is the next generation\nfaceplate for VDSL services (such as BT Infinity) that are being rolled out\nacross the United Kingdom. This faceplate is backwards compatible with all ADSL\nservices and represents the latest and best in broadband ADSL faceplates\navailable on the market.\n","linknr":88,"url":"Service_Specific_Front_Plate","recorded":1362484301,"links":13,"instances":[],"pdf":["https://www.btwholesale.com/shared/document/Products/Broadband/IPStream/dsl_max_myths_legends_issue1.pdf","http://www.openreach.co.uk/orpg/home/products/industryforums/superfastfibreaccess/downloads/FTTC_TWG_slide_deck_19th_Mar_2009_v4.pdf"],"categories":["Digital subscriber line"],"headings":["External References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/SSFP_Installed_March_2012_by_BT_Openreach.JPG/220px-SSFP_Installed_March_2012_by_BT_Openreach.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["British_telephone_socket","ADSL","RJ11","IDC_connector","VDSL","Openreach","United_Kingdom","Backwards_compatible"]}
