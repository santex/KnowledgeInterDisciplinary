Walshe, Bevan, Sealy, Phillipson p94 It gained a Queen's\nAwards for Export Achievement in 1974.\n\nEarly programmes were all half-hours, but the one-hour Survival Special became\nITVâs flagship wildlife documentary for three decades, often attracting\naudiences of more than 10 million. Series were also made for Channel\n4, for CITV and for regional transmission. Survival achieved great popularity in\nthe USA, where a syndicated half-hour series, 'The World of Survival' (narrated\nby John Forsythe), ran for 12 years, Willock, p194 and numerous one-\nhour films were aired by broadcasters including NBC, CBS and PBS.\n\nThe production unit was disbanded in 2001 and the title disappeared from\nBritish TV screens.

The Survival\nname was then subsequently used again with a series entitled Survival - Tales\nFrom The Wild.\n","linknr":638,"url":"Survival_(TV_series)","recorded":1362539568,"links":16,"instances":["filmmaker","actor","tv_network","road"],"pdf":[],"categories":["1961 television series debuts","1960s
