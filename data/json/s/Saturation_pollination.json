{"cursor":"7601","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Saturation pollination' is a pollination technique for agricultural crops in\nareas dominated by non-crop plant species that are preferred by pollinators. The\ntechnique involves keeping a larger number of bee colonies than normally\nmaintained for honey production so as to exhaust the preferred plants and ensure\nvisitation of the crop plants by the bees. McGregor, S.E. 1976. Insect\nPollination Of Cultivated Crop Plants. USDA\n[http://gears.tucson.ars.ag.gov/book/] The technique is applied in areas\nthat are normally avoided by beekeepers because of poor honey yields.\n\nSaturation pollination is especially important for those with special\npollination problems, such as crops with flowers that are unattractive to\nWestern honey bees (kiwifruit, for example), that have nectar that is low in\nsugars, or crops that have been moved from their native areas without the\ncorresponding movement of their normal pollinators. The keel of alfalfa flowers\nknock young honey bees on the head when they attempt to take the nectar and the\nbees soon learn to come in from the side to avoid getting hit with the keel's\npollen bearing structure while still getting the nectar. Thus only young,\ninexperienced bees are doused with pollen and able to pollinate alfalfa.\nSaturation pollination is becoming increasingly required for many crops due to\ndecline of wild pollinators and monocultured crops.\n","linknr":123,"url":"Saturation_pollination","recorded":1362480478,"links":11,"instances":["agriculture","beekeeping"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Pollination management","Plants and pollinators","Crops","Beekeeping"],"headings":["History of the technique","A supplement or alternative to honeybees","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["crop","agriculture"],["beehive","beekeeping"]],"members":["crop","beehive"],"related":["Pollination_management","Agriculture","Crop_(agriculture)","Flower","Western_honey_bee","Kiwifruit","Nectar","Sugar","Alfalfa","Monoculture","University_of_California","Entomology","Fruit","Western_honey_bee","Alfalfa","Seed","Utah","United_States","Legislature","Embargo","World_War_II","Legume","Nitrogen","Vegetable","Pesticide","Pollinator_decline","Beehive_(beekeeping)","University_of_California,_Davis","Woodland,_California","Mechanic","White_clover","Alsike","Clover","Alfalfa_leafcutter_bee","Pollination_management"]}
