NASA/ESA image]] , a G-type main-sequence star, the closest to Earth.]] A\n  'star' is a massive, luminous sphere of plasma held together by gravity. The\n  nearest star to Earth is the Sun, which is the source of most of the energy on\n  the planet. Some other stars are visible from Earth during the night when they\n  are not obscured by clouds or other atmospheric phenomena, appearing as a\n  multitude of fixed luminous points because of their immense distance.\n  Historically, the most prominent stars on the celestial sphere were grouped\n  together into constellations and asterisms, and the brightest stars gained\n  proper names. Extensive catalogues of stars have been assembled by\n  astronomers, which provide standardized star designations.\n\nFor at least a portion of its life, a star shines due to thermonuclear fusion of\nhydrogen into helium in its core, releasing energy that traverses the star's\ninterior and then radiates into outer space. Once a star's hydrogen is nearly\nexhausted, almost all naturally occurring elements heavier than helium are\ncreated, either via stellar nucleosynthesis during their lifetimes or by\nsupernova nucleosynthesis when very massive stars explode. Near the end of its\nlife, a star can also contain a proportion of degenerate matter. Astronomers can\ndetermine the mass, age, metallicity (chemical composition), and many other\nproperties of a star by observing its motion through space, luminosity, and\nspectrum respectively. The total mass of a star is the principal determinant of\nits evolution and eventual fate. Other characteristics of a star are determined\nby its evolutionary history, including diameter, rotation, movement and\ntemperature. A plot of the temperature of many stars against their luminosities,\nknown as a Hertzsprung–Russell diagram (H–R diagram), allows the age and\nevolutionary state of a star to be determined.\n\nA star begins as a collapsing cloud of material composed primarily of hydrogen,\nalong with helium and trace amounts of heavier elements. Once the stellar core\nis sufficiently dense, hydrogen becomes steadily converted into helium through\nnuclear fusion, releasing energy in the process.<ref name=\"sunshine\">{{cite web\n | last = Bahcall | first = John N. date = June 29, 2000 url =\n | http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/articles/fusion/index.html title =\n | How the Sun Shines | publisher = Nobel Foundation accessdate = 2006-08-30\n | }}</ref> The remainder of the star's interior carries energy away from the\n | core through a combination of radiative and convective processes.

hole.\n\nBinary and multi-star systems consist of two or more stars that are\ngravitationally bound, and generally move around each other in stable orbits.\nWhen two such stars have a relatively close orbit, their gravitational\ninteraction can have a significant impact on their evolution.<ref\nname=\"iben\">{{cite journal\n | last = Iben | first = Icko, Jr. title=Single and binary star evolution\n
