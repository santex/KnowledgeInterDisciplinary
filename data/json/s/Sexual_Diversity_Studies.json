Universities\nhave also labeled this area of analysis Sexual Diversity Studies, Sexualities\nStudies or LGBTQ Studies (Q for \"Questioning\" and/or \"Queer\").\n\nOriginally centered on LGBT history and literary theory, the field has expanded\nto include the academic study of issues raised in biology, sociology,\nanthropology, the history of science, philosophy,\npsychology, sexology, political science, ethics, and other fields by an\nexamination of the identity, lives, history, and perception of queer people.\nMarianne LaFrance, the former chair of the Larry Kramer Initiative for Lesbian\nand Gay Studies at Yale University, says,\n\"Now we're asking not just 'What causes homosexuality?' [but also] 'What causes\nheterosexuality?' and 'Why is sexuality so central in some people's\nperspective?'\" ]] Queer studies is not the same as\nqueer theory, an analytical viewpoint within queer studies (centered on literary\nstudies and philosophy) that challenges the putatively \"socially constructed\"\ncategories of sexual identity.\n","linknr":527,"url":"Sexual_Diversity_Studies","recorded":1362557121,"links":27,"instances":["marxism"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Queer","Queer studies|","Postmodernism","Post-structuralism","Queer theory","LGBT and education"],"headings":["Background","History","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/Eve_Kosofsky_Sedgwick_by_David_Shankbone.jpg/220px-Eve_Kosofsky_Sedgwick_by_David_Shankbone.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6d/Rainbow_flag_and_blue_skies.jpg/120px-Rainbow_flag_and_blue_skies.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["reification","marxism"]],"members":["reification"],"related":["Sexual_orientation","Gender_identity","Lesbian","Gay","Bisexual","Transgender","Intersex","LGBTI","LGBT_history","Literary_theory","Biology","Sociology","Anthropology","History_of_science","Philosophy","Psychology","Sexology","Political_science","Ethics","Queer","Yale_University","Queer_theory","Literary_study","Philosophy","United_States","City_College_of_San_Francisco","City_University_of_New_York","University_of_California,_Berkeley","University_of_Chicago","SUNY_Purchase_College","New_York_University","Hobart_and_William_Smith_Colleges","Yale_University","University_of_California,_Los_Angeles","Sarah_Lawrence_College","University_of_Maryland,_College_Park","DePaul_University","St._Andrews_University","California_State_University_Fullerton","California_State_University_Northridge","Portland_State_University","University_of_North_Texas","University_of_Toronto","Syracuse_University","University_of_Louisiana_at_Lafayette","Michel_Foucault","Judith_Butler","Lauren_Berlant","Teresa_de_Lauretis","Judith_Halberstam","David_Halperin","Eve_Kosofsky_Sedgwick","Michael_Warner","Racialized","List_of_gay,_lesbian_or_bisexual_people","Marxism","Reification_(Marxism)","Capitalism","Women's_studies","Critical_theory","Frankfurt_School","University_of_California,_Berkeley","Southern_Illinois_University_Edwardsville","University_of_Nebraskaâ€“Lincoln","Louis_Crompton","Harvard_University","City_University_of_New_York","City_College_of_San_Francisco","Jonathan_David_Katz","John_Boswell","Martin_Duberman","Yale_University","City_University_of_New_York","Center_for_Lesbian_and_Gay_Studies","AIDS","Larry_Kramer","Alison_Richard","Arthur_Kramer","Jonathan_David_Katz","Harvard_University","Harvard_Gay_&_Lesbian_Caucus","F._O._Matthiessen","Gender_studies","Group_entity","LGBT","Alliant_International_University"]}
