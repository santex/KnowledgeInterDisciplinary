The album was released\n  on July 5, 1983, through Frontier Records with the catalog number FLP 011. It\n  became one of the best-selling punk albums at the time and launched the band\n  into its future success. By 1986, Suicidal Tendencies sold at least 150,000\n  copies. \"Institutionalized\" was released as a radio hit to promote\n  the album.
