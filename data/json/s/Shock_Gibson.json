{"cursor":"2200","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" 'Shock Gibson' is a fictional comic book superhero who\nfirst appeared in Speed Comics #1 (Oct. 1939), from Brookwood Publications, a\ncompany later absorbed by Harvey Comics). He was created by artist Maurice\nScott, who drew it through issue #11, and an unknown writer. His 1939\nintroduction makes him one of comic books' earliest superheroes.\n\nIn the debut story, \"The Human Dynamo\", scientist Robert Charles Gibson perfects\na formula that allows people to directly store, generate, and control\nelectricity, and tests this formula on himself. The formula increases his\nstrength, gives him the power to fire bolts of lightning, and grants him the\npower of flight. He was one of the several superhero characters to join the US\nArmy in the wake of World War II, fighting the Japanese military forces both in\nand out of costume. Shock Gibson teamed up with other Harvey Comics characters\nsuch as the Black Cat, Captain Freedom, Tedd Parish and Girl Commandos (mostly\nin two-page text stories). The character remained in print in various Harvey\npublications through 1948.\n\nOther artists associated with the characters include Al Avison, Arthur\nCazeneuve, and the possibly pseudonymous Peter Jay, who introduced a new costume\nin Speed Comics #12 (March 1941).\n\nShock Gibson is among the public domain characters Image Comics revived in an\nanthology title, [[The Next Issue Project]] in\n2007.
