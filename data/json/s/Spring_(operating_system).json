Using technology substantially\nsimilar to concepts developed in the Mach kernel, Spring concentrated on\nproviding a richer programming environment supporting multiple inheritance and\nother features. Spring was also more cleanly separated from the operating\nsystems it would host, divorcing it from its Unix roots and even allowing\nseveral OSes to be run at the same time. Development faded out in the mid-1990s,\nbut several ideas and some code from the project was later re-used in the Java\nprogramming language libraries and the Solaris operating system.\n","linknr":166,"url":"Spring_(operating_system)","recorded":1362575370,"links":15,"instances":["operating_system","computing","programming_language","unix"],"pdf":["http://research.sun.com/features/tenyears/volcd/papers/Mitchell.pdf","http://research.sun.com/techrep/1993/smli_tr-93-14.pdf","http://research.sun.com/techrep/1993/smli_tr-93-9.pdf"],"categories":["Proprietary operating systems","Microkernels","Sun Microsystems software"],"headings":["History","Background","Rationale","Description","Other systems","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/49/Spring_OS_1.0_cover.jpg/200px-Spring_OS_1.0_cover.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["java","programming_language"],["solaris","operating_system"],["pipeline","unix"],["doors","computing"]],"members":["solaris","doors","java","pipeline"],"related":["Microkernel","Object_oriented","Operating_system","Sun_Microsystems","Mach_kernel","Multiple_inheritance","Unix","Java_(programming_language)","Programming_language","Solaris_(operating_system)","Old_AT&T","System_V_Release_4","Leading_edge","Berkeley_Software_Distribution","Inter-process_communication","Virtual_memory","Memory_management_unit","Copy_on_write","File_system","Network_stack","DOS","IBM","Workplace_OS","68k","SPARC","Set-top_box","Interface_definition_language","C++","CORBA","Real-time_computing","Input/output","Pipeline_(Unix)","Procedure_call","Virtual_memory","Memory_management_unit","SPARC","Context_switch","Register_window","IA-32","BSD_Unix","SPARCstation_2","Virtual_memory","RAM","GiB","Hard_disk","Backing_store","File_server","Web_server","Database_management_system","API","Plan_9_from_Bell_Labs","Access_control_list","Windows_NT","Object_persistence","Workstation","Doors_(computing)","L4_microkernel_family"]}
