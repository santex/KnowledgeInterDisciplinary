{"cursor":"2948","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nThe 'Sozialistische Deutsche Studentenbund' â the 'Socialist German Student\nUnion' or 'Socialist German Student League' â was founded in 1946 in Hamburg,\nGermany, as the collegiate branch of the [[Social Democratic Party of\nGermany|Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands]] (SPD; the \"Social Democratic\nParty of Germany\"). In the 1950s tensions between the SDS and the main party\nsurfaced, particularly over the party's support of Germany's rearming, until in\n1961 the SPD excluded all members of the SDS from the party.\n\nAfter its exclusion from the parent organization, the SDS became the leading\nelement in the AuÃerparlamentarische Opposition (APO; \"Extraparliamentary\nOpposition\"), that became active when the SPD and CDU formed a grand coalition\nwhich left Germany without a strong opposition inside parliament, since those\ntwo parties traditionally opposed each other. It consisted mainly of college and\nuniversity students. The SDS opposed the Vietnam War and Germany's political\ninvolvement in it, as well as the use of nuclear weapons, and objected that many\nformer Nazis still held influential positions in Germany. They also wanted to\nadvance democratic structures in all institutions, for example in school.\n\nAlternative lifestyles and more tolerance for same-sex couples, a more open\ntreatment of sexual topics, the right to abortion and equal rights for women are\nalso associated with the APO, and the SDS as its best known representative. The\nstudents involved used the same methods of protest as the anti-war movement in\nthe United States at that time, for example sit-ins and demonstrations. The\nstudent movement reached its height in 1968 (its membership peaked at 2,500 at\nthat time), after that the influence of the SDS declined. In 1970 it disbanded.\nA resurrection of the SDS in 1988 proved of no importance.\n\nImportant members of the SDS were Helmut Schmidt, later Chancellor of Germany\n(he was a member while the SDS was still part of the SPD), the later Red Army\nFaction member Ulrike Meinhof, and Rudi Dutschke.\n\nIn 2007 the student organisation of the new German Left Party, Die Linke,\nadopted the name Die Linke.SDS (Sozialistisch-Demokratischer\nStudierendenverband) at its founding congress.
