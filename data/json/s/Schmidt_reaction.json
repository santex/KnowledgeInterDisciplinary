The reaction was discovered in 1924 by Karl Friedrich Schmidt\n(1887â1971), who successfully converted benzophenone and hydrazoic\nacid to benzanilide. It is a tool regularly used in organic chemistry for the\nsynthesis of new organic compounds, for example, in that of the unusual 2-\nquinuclidone.\n","linknr":181,"url":"Schmidt_reaction","recorded":1362371453,"links":21,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Rearrangement reactions","Name reactions"],"headings":["Reaction mechanism","Reactions involving alkyl azides","See also","References","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Schmidt_reaction.png/800px-Schmidt_reaction.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/Schmidtreactionmechanismamine.png/500px-Schmidtreactionmechanismamine.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e6/SchmidtreactionmechanismAmide.png/500px-SchmidtreactionmechanismAmide.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c6/BoyerReaction.png/400px-BoyerReaction.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/SchmidtreactionApplication.png/400px-SchmidtreactionApplication.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Organic_reaction","Carbon","Nitrogen","Chemical_bond","Azide","Organic_Reactions","Hydrazoic_acid","Carboxylic_acid","Amine","Isocyanate","Ketone","Amide","Catalyst","Protic_acid","Sulfuric_acid","Lewis_acid","Karl_Friedrich_Schmidt","Benzophenone","Hydrazoic_acid","Benzanilide","Organic_chemistry","2-quinuclidone","Acylium","Protonation","Hydrazoic_acid","Rearrangement_reaction","Isocyanate","Carbamate","Carbon_dioxide","Amine","Curtius_rearrangement","Reaction_mechanism","Ketone","Nucleophilic_addition","Elimination_reaction","Imine","Beckmann_rearrangement","Tautomer","Amide","Azides","Benzaldehyde","Azide","Intramolecular","Bicyclic","Lactam","Curtius_rearrangement","Hofmann_rearrangement"]}
