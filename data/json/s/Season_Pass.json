Some passes allow you to get free (or prepaid for the duration of\nthe pass) parking, and free coupons to what non-holders couldn't do.\n\nSeason Pass can also refer to the term coined by the manufacturers of the TiVo\npersonal video recorder for their function which allows a user to program the\ndevice to record all of the episodes of a series, even if their airings are\nrescheduled or pre-empted.\n\nAlso, season passes are used in certain video games. When bought, this allows\nthe owner to get all future DLC's of a game (provided it has a pass) for a one-\ntime fee. Also, some passes have unique names, one example is Max Payne 3's\npass, which has the name 'Rockstar Pass.'\n\nSimilar functions are available on competitive 'PVR' systems and software\npackages such as ReplayTV and IceTV.\n\nSeasons Passes are often available for sporting events too.\n","linknr":97,"url":"Season_Pass","recorded":1362670124,"links":16,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Entertainment"],"headings":["External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/SeasonPasses.JPG/220px-SeasonPasses.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf8/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/66/Super_Star%2C_Freak_Out_and_KMG_Booster%2C_night.jpg/40px-Super_Star%2C_Freak_Out_and_KMG_Booster%2C_night.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Six_Flags","Cedar_Fair","TiVo","Personal_video_recorder","Television_series","ReplayTV","Icetv"]}
