In\ncontrast to other database management systems, SQLite is not a separate process\nthat is accessed from the client application, but an integral part of it.\n\nSQLite is ACID-compliant and implements most of the SQL standard, using a\ndynamically and weakly typed SQL syntax that does not guarantee the domain\nintegrity.\n\nSQLite is a popular choice as embedded database for local/client storage in\napplication software such as web browsers. It is arguably the most widely\ndeployed database engine, as it is used today by several widespread browsers,\noperating systems, and embedded systems, among others. SQLite has\nmany bindings to programming languages.\n\nThe source code for SQLite is in the public domain.\n","linknr":515,"url":"SQLite","recorded":1362891309,"links":46,"instances":["malware","operating_system","programming_language","computer_science","programming_language","operating_system","programming_language","computer_science","computing","web_browser","programming_language","programming_language","database","programming_language","engineering","software","programming_language","programming_language","programming_language","programming_language","software","dbms","computing","web_framework","programming_language","computer_science","computing","programming_language","programming_language","software"],"pdf":["http://ldapcon.org/downloads/chu-paper.pdf","http://documentation.openoffice.org/HOW_TO/data_source/SQLite.pdf"],"categories":["2000
