Generally, self-concept\nembodies the answer to \"Who am I?\"\n\nSelf-concept is distinguishable from self-awareness, which refers to the extent\nto which self-knowledge is clearly defined, consistent and currently applicable\nto one's attitudes and dispositions. Ayduk, Ozlem, Anett Gyurak, and Anna\nLuerssen. \"Rejection sensitivity moderates the impact of rejection on self-\nconcept clarity.\" Personality & Social Psychology Bulletin 35.11 (2009):\n1467+. Self-concept is made up of one's self-schemas. Additionally, self-\nconcept interacts with self-esteem, self-knowledge, and social self to form the\nself. Self-esteem refers to the evaluation or comparison of one's self-concept\nand self-schemas to form one's overall self-worth.\n\n\nThe self-concept includes past, present and future selves. Future or possible\nselves represent individuals' ideas of what they might become, what they would\nlike to become, or what they are afraid of becoming. These different selves\ncorrespond to one's hopes, fears, standards, goals, and threats for their\npresent selves. Possible selves may function as incentives for future behavior\nand also provide an evaluative and interpretive context for the current view of\nself that is used when one self-evaluates, contributing to one's self-\nesteem. Self-esteem and self-concept\ncannot be used interchangeably. Self-esteem focuses on an evaluative and\nopinionated aspect to one's self (e.g., I feel good about the fact that I am a\nfast runner), whereas self-concept is more of a cognitive or descriptive\ncomponent to one's self (e.g., I am a fast runner). This distinction is\nimportant to note, as self-concept and self-esteem closely interact to form an\noverall view of the self.\n\nThe perception which people have about their past or future selves is related to\nthe perception of their current self. The temporal self-appraisal theory\nWilson, A. E., & Ross, M. (2001). From chump to champ: Peopleâs appraisals\nof their earlier and present selves. Journal of Personality and Social\nPsychology, 80, 572-584. argues that people have a tendency to maintain a\npositive evaluation of the current self by distancing their self-concepts from\ntheir negative selves and paying more attention to their positive selves. In\naddition, people have a tendency to perceive the past self less\nfavorably Ross, M., & Wilson, A. E. (2002). It feels like yesterday: Self-\nesteem, valence of personal past experience, and judgments of subjective\ndistance. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 82, 792-803.\n(e.g., I'm better than I used to be) and the future self more positively\nWilson, A. E., Buehler, R., Lawford, H., Schmidt, C., & Yong, A. G. (2012).\nBasking in projected glory: The role of subjective temporal distance in future\nself-appraisal. European Journal of Social Psychology, 42, 342-353.
