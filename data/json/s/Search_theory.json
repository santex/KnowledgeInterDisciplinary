{"cursor":"9728","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nIn microeconomics, 'search theory' studies buyers or sellers who cannot\ninstantly find a trading partner, and must therefore search for a partner prior\nto transacting.\n\nSearch theory has been influential in many areas of economics. It has been\napplied in labor economics to analyze frictional unemployment resulting from job\nhunting by workers. In consumer theory, it has been applied to analyze\npurchasing decisions. From a worker's perspective, an acceptable job would be\none that pays a high wage, one that offers desirable benefits, and/or one that\noffers pleasant and safe working conditions. From a consumer's perspective, a\nproduct worth purchasing would have sufficiently high quality, and be offered at\na sufficiently low price. In both cases, whether a given job or product is\nacceptable depends on the searcher's beliefs about the alternatives available in\nthe market.\n\nMore precisely, search theory studies an individual's optimal strategy when\nchoosing from a series of potential opportunities of random quality, under the\nassumption that delaying choice is costly. Search models illustrate how best to\nbalance the cost of delay against the value of the option to try again.\nMathematically, search models are optimal stopping problems.\n\nMacroeconomists have extended search theory by studying general equilibrium\nmodels in which one or more types of searchers interact. These macroeconomic\ntheories have been called 'matching theory', or 'search and matching theory'.\n","linknr":186,"url":"Search_theory","recorded":1362554237,"links":14,"instances":["economics","game_theory","economics","macroeconomics","finance"],"pdf":["http://static.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/2010/press.pdf"],"categories":["Labor economics","Microeconomics"],"headings":["Search from a known distribution","Search from an unknown distribution","Endogenizing the price distribution","Matching theory","See also","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["strategy","game_theory"],["model","economics"],["option","finance"],["matching_theory","macroeconomics"],["vacancy","economics"]],"members":["vacancy","strategy","model","matching_theory","option"],"related":["Microeconomics","Labor_economics","Frictional_unemployment","Job_hunting","Consumer_theory","Strategy_(game_theory)","Stochastic","Model_(economics)","Option_(finance)","Optimal_stopping","Macroeconomics","General_equilibrium","Matching_theory_(macroeconomics)","George_J._Stigler","John_J._McCall","Optimal_stopping","Probability_distribution","Reservation_wage","Risk_aversion","Compensating_differential","Variance","Risk_aversion","Reservation_price","Multi-armed_bandit","Gittins_index","Price_dispersion","Law_of_one_price","Macroeconomic_model","Peter_A._Diamond","Dale_Mortensen","Christopher_A._Pissarides","Nobel_prize_in_economics","Vacancy_(economics)","Optimal_stopping","Job_hunting","Reservation_wage","Frictional_unemployment","Price_dispersion","Information_economics","Labor_economics","Real_options_analysis","Search_cost"]}
