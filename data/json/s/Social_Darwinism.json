Williams, Raymond. 2000. Social Darwinism. in Herbert\nSpencer's Critical Assessment. John Offer. (ed). pp. 186 -199 The term\nsocial Darwinism gained widespread currency when used in 1944 to oppose these\nearlier concepts. Today, because of the negative connotations of the theory of\nsocial Darwinism, especially after the atrocities of the Second World War\n(including the Holocaust), few people would describe themselves as Social\nDarwinists and the term is generally seen as pejorative.\n\nSocial Darwinism is generally understood to use the concepts of struggle for\nexistence and survival of the fittest to justify social policies which make no\ndistinction between those able to support themselves and those unable to support\nthemselves. Many such views stress competition between individuals in laissez-\nfaire capitalism; but the ideology has also motivated ideas of eugenics,\nscientific racism, imperialism, Leonard, Thomas C.

Journal of the History of Ideas 61 (2):223-\n240.\n\nOpponents of evolution theory have often maintained that social Darwinism is a\nlogical entailment of a belief in evolutionary theory, while biologists and\nhistorians maintain that it is rather a perversion of Charles Darwin's\nideas. While most scholars recognize historical\nlinks between Darwin's theory and forms of social Darwinism, they also\nmaintain that social Darwinism is not a necessary consequence of the\nprinciples of biological evolution Paul, Diane B. 2003.
