Some facilities require the wearing of swim\ncaps, in order to protect filters from becoming clogged with loose hairs which\nfall from the head of swimmers who are not wearing a cap. Caps are also\nsometimes worn in an attempt to keep the hair relatively dry or free from\nchlorinated water, to keep the sun off the hair, and also, when a cap is worn\nwith ear plugs, in order to keep water out of the ears.\n\nCompetitive swim caps are made of tightly fitted silicone, latex, or lycra that\nhugs the skull of its user, providing cover for his or her hair. This reduces\ndrag in the water caused by loose hair. During longer swimming sessions, a swim\ncap keeps the wearer's head warm.\n","linknr":143,"url":"Swim_cap","recorded":1362566606,"links":29,"instances":["water"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Swimming equipment"],"headings":["History","Double swim caps","English Channel swimming rules for swim caps","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Oussama_Mellouli_1.jpg/220px-Oussama_Mellouli_1.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["filter","water"]],"members":["filter"],"related":["Silicone","Latex","Lycra","Competitive_Swimwear","Filter_(water)","Hair","Chlorinated","Permanent_wave","Open_water_swimming","English_Channel","Neoprene"]}
