{"cursor":"1632","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Specific identification' is a method of finding out ending inventory cost.\n\nIt requires a detailed physical count, so that the company knows exactly how\nmany of each goods brought on specific dates remained at year end inventory.\nWhen this information is found, the amount of goods are multiplied by their\npurchase cost at their purchase date, to get a number for the ending\ninventory cost.\n\nIn theory, this method is the best method, since it relates the ending inventory\ngoods directly to the specific price they were bought for. However, this method\nallows management to easily manipulate ending inventory cost, since they can\nchoose to report that the cheaper goods were sold first, hence increasing ending\ninventory cost and lowering cost of goods sold. This will increase the income.\nAlternatively, management can choose to report lower income, to reduce the taxes\nthey needed to pay.\n\nThis method is also very hard to use on interchangeable goods. For example, it\nis hard to relate shipping and storage costs to a specific inventory item. These\nnumbers will need to be estimated, hence reducing the specific identification\nmethod's benefit of being extremely specific.\n","linknr":145,"url":"Specific_identification_(inventories)","recorded":1362668696,"links":11,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Inventory"],"headings":["See also","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Ending_Inventory","Cost_of_goods_sold","Tax","Shipping","Warehouse","Weighted_average_cost","Moving-average_cost","FIFO_and_LIFO_accounting"]}
