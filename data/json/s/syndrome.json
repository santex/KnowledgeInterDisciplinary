In recent decades,\nthe term has been used outside medicine to refer to a combination of phenomena\nseen in association.\n\nSome syndromes, such as Down syndrome, have only one cause; others, such as\nParkinsonian syndrome, have multiple possible causes. In other cases, the cause\nof the syndrome is unknown.\n\nThe term syndrome derives from the Greek συνδρομή (sundromē) and means\n\"concurrence of symptoms, concourse\",<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/-\ntext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dsundromh%2F συνδρομή], Henry\nGeorge Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus</ref> from σύν\n(syn), \"along with, together\"<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc-\n=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dsu%2Fn σύν], Henry George Liddell,\nRobert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus</ref> + δρόμος (dromos),\namongst others \"course\".<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Pers-\neus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Ddro%2Fmos δρόμος], Henry George Liddell,\nRobert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus</ref>\n\nA familiar syndrome name often continues to be used even after an underlying\ncause has been found, or when there are a number of different primary causes\nthat all give rise to the same combination of symptoms and signs. Many syndromes\nare named after the physicians credited with first reporting the association;\nthese are \"eponymous\" syndromes (see also the list of eponymous diseases, many\nof which are called \"syndromes\"). Otherwise, disease features or presumed\ncauses, as well as references to geography, history or poetry, can lend their\nnames to syndromes.\n",
