[...] We here define\n‘shape’ informally as ‘all the geometrical information that remains when\nlocation, scale<ref>Here, scale means only uniform scaling, as non-uniform\nscaling would change the shape of the object (e.g., it would turn a square into\na rectangle).</ref> and rotational effects are filtered out from an\nobject.’</blockquote> Simple shapes can be described by basic geometry objects\nsuch as a set of two or more points, a line, a curve, a plane, a plane figure\n(e.g. square or circle), or a solid figure (e.g. cube or sphere). Most shapes\noccurring in the physical world are complex. Some, such as plant structures and\ncoastlines, may be so arbitrary as to defy traditional mathematical\ndescription&nbsp;– in which case they may be analyzed by differential geometry,\nor as fractals.\n",
