It can be regarded as a numerical characteristic of a population\nor a model. Everitt, B.S. (2002) The Cambridge Dictionary of Statistics.\nCUP. ISBN 0-521-81099-X\n\nAmong parameterized families of distributions are the normal distributions, the\nPoisson distributions, the binomial distributions, and the exponential\ndistributions. The family of normal distributions has two parameters, the mean\nand the variance: if these are specified, the distribution is known exactly. The\nfamily of chi-squared distributions, on the other hand, has only one parameter,\nthe number of degrees of freedom.\n\nIn statistical inference, parameters are sometimes taken to be unobservable, and\nin this case the statistician's task is to infer what he can about the parameter\nbased on observations of random variables distributed according to the\nprobability distribution in question, or, more concretely stated, based on a\nrandom sample taken from the population of interest. In other situations,\nparameters may be fixed by the nature of the sampling procedure used or the kind\nof statistical procedure being carried out (for example, the number of degrees\nof freedom in a Pearson's chi-squared test).\n\nEven if a family of distributions is not specified, quantities such as the mean\nand variance can still be regarded as parameters of the distribution of the\npopulation from which a sample is drawn. Statistical procedures can still\nattempt to make inferences about such population parameters. Parameters of this\ntype are given names appropriate to their roles, including:\n:*location parameter *dispersion parameter or scale parameter *shape parameter\nWhere a probability distribution has a domain over a set of objects that are\nthemselves probability distributions, the term concentration parameter is used\nfor quantities that index how variable the outcomes would be.\n\nQuantities such as regression coefficients, are statistical parameters in the\nabove sense, since they index the family of conditional probability\ndistributions that describe how the dependent variables are related to the\nindependent variables.\n","linknr":133,"url":"Statistical_parameter","recorded":1362902890,"links":16,"instances":["statistics","statistics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Statistical theory","Statistical terminology","Theory of probability distributions"],"headings":["Analogies","Misuse of statistical terminology","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Bellcurve.svg/30px-Bellcurve.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["degrees_of_freedom","statistics"],["precision","statistics"]],"members":["precision","degrees_of_freedom"],"related":["Probability_distribution","Statistical_population","Statistical_model","Parametric_family","Normal_distribution","Poisson_distribution","Binomial_distribution","Exponential_distribution","Normal_distribution","Mean","Variance","Chi-squared_distribution","Statistical_inference","Random_variables","Degrees_of_freedom_(statistics)","Pearson's_chi-squared_test","Mean","Variance","Location_parameter","Statistical_dispersion","Scale_parameter","Shape_parameter","Concentration_parameter","Regression_coefficient","Conditional_probability_distribution","Dependent_and_independent_variables","Statistical_population","Statistic","Statistical_sample","Human","Earth","Grape","Bowl","Sovereign_state","Layman","Precision_(statistics)","Parametrization","Coordinate_system","Parsimony"]}
