Sailing Directions consists\nof 37 Enroute volumes, 4 Planning Guide volumes, and 1 volume combining both\ntypes. Planning Guides describe general features of ocean basins and country-\nspecific information such as firing areas, pilotage requirements, regulations,\nsearch and rescue information, ship reporting systems, and time zones, to name a\nfew; Enroutes describe features of coastlines, ports, and harbors.\n\nSailing Directions are updated when new data requires extensive revision of an\nexisting text. These data are obtained from several sources, including, but not\nlimited to, pilots and Sailing Directions from other countries.\n\nOne book comprises the Planning Guide and {{Not a typo|Enroute}} for\n[[Antarctica]]. This consolidation allows for a more effective presentation of\nmaterial on this unique area.\n\nSailing Directions (Planning Guide) and Sailing Directions (Enroute) are\nfrequently updated. In early 2005, NGA discontinued production of these\npublications in printed form; subsequent editions were distributed in digital\nform only. Between editions, Sailing Directions are corrected via a binary patch\nprocess referred to as Publication Data Update (PDU).\n\n'Figure 1' shows an overview of Sailing Directions coverage.\n","linknr":154,"url":"Sailing_Directions","recorded":1362576210,"links":32,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.irbs.com/bowditch/pdf/chapt04.pdf","http://msi.nga.mil/MSISiteContent/StaticFiles/NAV_PUBS/SD/PubXYZ/PubXYZbk.pdf"],"categories":["Navigation","Hydrography","Sailing books"],"headings":["''Sailing Directions'' (Planning Guide)","''Sailing Directions (Enroute)''","Source","See also","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b1/SDLIMITS.jpg/200px-SDLIMITS.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Sample_Planning_Guide_page.jpg/200px-Sample_Planning_Guide_page.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8f/Yacht_foresail.svg/24px-Yacht_foresail.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/43/Coast-pilot-5-cover.jpg/60px-Coast-pilot-5-cover.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/Bowditch-1st-edition.jpg/100px-Bowditch-1st-edition.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Navigation","National_Geospatial-Intelligence_Agency","Maritime_boundary","American_Practical_Navigator","United_States","American_Practical_Navigator","Buoy","Coast_Pilots","Light_List","List_of_Lights","Local_Notice_to_Mariners","Notice_to_Mariners","Nathaniel_Bowditch"]}
