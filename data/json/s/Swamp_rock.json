P. Auslander, Liveness: performance in a mediatized\nculture (London: Routledge, 2008), p. 83. It is particularly associated\nwith the creation of hybrid sub-genres from the later 1960s including country\nrock and Southern rock, which have been seen as responses to the perceived\nexcesses of dominant psychedelic and developing progressive rock. V. Bogdanov, C. Woodstra and S. T. Erlewine, All music guide to rock: the\ndefinitive guide to rock, pop, and soul (Backbeat Books, 3rd edn., 2002), p.\n1327. Because roots music (Americana) is often used to mean folk and world\nmusical forms, roots rock is sometimes used in a broad sense to describe any\nrock music that incorporates elements of this music. R. Shuker, Popular\nMusic: the Key Concepts (London: Routledge, 2005), p. 235. In the 1980s\nroots rock enjoyed a revival in response to trends in punk rock, New Wave and\nheavy metal music.\n","linknr":403,"url":"Swamp_rock","recorded":1362669079,"links":20,"instances":["band","band","band","band","band","music"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Alternative country","Crossover (music)","Rock music genres","Swamp rock"],"headings":["History","Notes","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Symbol_book_class2.svg/16px-Symbol_book_class2.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg/16px-Portal-puzzle.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["americana","music"],["americana","music"],["eagles","band"],["outlaws","band"],[".38_special","band"],["kansas","band"],["styx","band"]],"members":["eagles","kansas","styx","outlaws","americana"],"related":["Rock_music","Country_music","Blues","Folk_music","Folk_rock","Rock_and_roll","Roots_revival","United_States","Guitar","Acoustic_guitar","Electric_guitar","Pedal_steel_guitar","Piano","Drum","Bass_guitar","Country_rock","Southern_rock","Heartland_rock","Swamp_rock","Alternative_country","Cowpunk","Americana_(music)","Indie_folk","Folk_music","Blues","Country_music","Country_rock","Southern_rock","Psychedelic_rock","Progressive_rock","Americana_(music)","World_music","Punk_rock","New_Wave_music","Heavy_metal_music","Psychedelia","Roots_revival","Charlie_McCoy","Country_folk","The_Band","Creedence_Clearwater_Revival","Ry_Cooder","Bonnie_Raitt","Lowell_George","The_Byrds","Gram_Parsons","International_Submarine_Band","Pedal_steel_guitar","Chris_Hillman","The_Flying_Burrito_Brothers","Poco","Riders_of_the_Purple_Sage","Beau_Brummels","Nitty_Gritty_Dirt_Band","Everly_Brothers","Teen_idol","Ricky_Nelson","Mike_Nesmith","First_National_Band","Monkees","Neil_Young","Bluegrass_music","The_Dillards","Doobie_Brothers","R&B","Emmylou_Harris","Linda_Ronstadt","Eagles_(band)","Soul_music","Stax-Volt","Muscle_Shoals_Sound_Studio","FAME_Studios","Allman_Brothers_Band","Blues_rock","Boogie","Duane_Allman","Lynyrd_Skynyrd","Free_Bird","Sweet_Home_Alabama","Good_ol'_boy","Dixie_Dregs","Outlaws_(band)","Wet_Willie","Ozark_Mountain_Daredevils",".38_Special_(band)","Molly_Hatchet","The_Marshall_Tucker_Band","American_Midwest","Arena_rock","Kansas_(band)","REO_Speedwagon","Styx_(band)","Folk_music","Country_music","Rock_and_roll","Rust_Belt","Bruce_Springsteen","Bob_Seger","Tom_Petty","Southside_Johnny_and_the_Asbury_Jukes","Joe_Grushecky","John_Mellencamp","Steve_Earle","Bruce_Hornsby","Billy_Joel","Kid_Rock","The_Killers","Synth_pop","Cow_punk","Jason_&_The_Scorchers","Dash_Rip_Rock","Drivin_N_Cryin","The_Long_Ryders","Tex_&_the_Horseheads","The_Rave-Ups","Lone_Justice","Rank_and_File","Gun_Club","Chris_Isaak","John_Mellencamp","BoDeans","Los_Lobos","Alternative_country","Steve_Earle","Uncle_Tupelo","Son_Volt","Wilco","The_Bottle_Rockets","List_of_Roots_rock_bands_and_musicians"]}
