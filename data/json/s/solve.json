He pillaged in the Baltic Sea and at night they made shore in the\nhundred of Lofond/Lovund (perhaps Lovön or the Lagunda Hundred) where they\nsurrounded a house and set it on fire killing everybody inside. In the house\nthere was a feast where the Swedish king Östen was invited. Then Sölve and his\nmen arrived in Sigtuna (Old Sigtuna) and declared that the Swedes had to accept\nhim as king. The Swedes refused and fought Sölve for eleven days until they\nlost. Sölve then ruled Sweden until the Swedes rebelled and killed him.\n\nHistoria Norwegiae only relates that the Geats burnt Östen and his people to\ndeath inside his house.\n\nSölvi also appears in [[Half's saga]], of which there is a version from the year\n1300. This saga relates that Sölvi was the son of Högne the rich of Nærøy fyrir\nNaumundalsminni in Norway and that he was the brother of Hild the Slender.\nSölvi's brother-in-law, Hjorleiv, was the king of Hordaland and Rogaland and\nHjorleiv killed Hreidar, the king of Zealand. Then Hjorleiv put Sölvi as the\njarl of Zealand. Later in the saga, Sölvi is no longer the jarl of Zealand, but\nthe king of Sweden. Hjorleiv had a son named Half (after whom the saga is\nnamed), and after the Norwegian king Asmund had killed Half, a couple of his\nchampions go to Sweden and king Sölvi (til svíþjóðar ; fóru þeir ... á fund\nSölva konungs) (see also Gard Agdi).\n\nSölvi is also mentioned in a few other sources, but none of them relate of his\nDanish and Swedish dominions.\n\nHe was succeeded by Ingvar of the Swedish royal dynasty, the House of Yngling.\n","title":"S%C3%B6lve","headings":["Primary sources","Secondary sources"]},"micro-relation":["2: Östen","2: Heimskringla","2: Nærøy","1: Sea-king","1: Sweden","1: Hall","1: Högne_of_Njardö","1: Jutland","1: Historia_Norvegiae","1: Geatish","1: Baltic_Sea","1: Lovön","1: Lagunda_Hundred","1: Old_Sigtuna","1: Norway","1: Hordaland","1: Rogaland","1: Gard_Agdi","1: Ingvar","1: House_of_Yngling","1: Ynglingatal","1: Ynglinga_saga","1: Historia_Norvegiæ","1: Halfs_saga"]}
