He appears in the television series [[Star Trek: The Next\nGeneration]] and the feature films [[Star Trek: Generations]], [[Star Trek:\nFirst Contact]], [[Star Trek: Insurrection]], and [[Star Trek:\nNemesis]].\n\nDesigned and built by Doctor Noonien Soong, Data is a sentient, fully functional\nandroid who serves as the second officer and chief operations officer aboard the\nstarships USS ''Enterprise''-D and USS ''Enterprise''-E. His positronic brain\nallows him impressive computational capabilities. Data experienced ongoing\ndifficulties during the early years of his life with understanding various\naspects of human behavior TNG: \"Encounter at Farpoint\" and was unable\nto feel emotion or understand certain human idiosyncrasies, inspiring him to\nstrive for his own humanity. This goal eventually led to the addition of an\n\"emotion chip\", also created by Soong, to Data's positronic net. TNG: \"\",\n\"\" Though Data's striving for humanity and desire for human emotion is a\nsignificant plot point (and source for humor) throughout the series, he\ncontinually shows a nuanced sense of wisdom, sensitivity, and curiosity.\n\nData is in many ways a successor to the original [[Star Trek: The Original\nSeries|Star Trek]]s Spock (Leonard Nimoy), in that the character offers an\n\"outsider's\" perspective on humanity.\n","linknr":615,"url":"Spot_(Star_Trek)","recorded":1362566183,"links":41,"instances":["star_trek","robot","asimov","cat","star_trek","robot","star_trek"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Star Trek","Star Trek film characters","Starfleet officers","Fictional characters with superhuman strength","Fictional commanders","Fictional lieutenant commanders","Fictional actors","Fictional singers","Fictional violinists","Fictional artists","Fictional poets","Fictional robots","Fictional scientists","Fictional artificial intelligences","Fictional twins","Starfleet lieutenant commanders","Starfleet commanders","Fictional characters introduced in 1987","Fictional androids","Robot Hall of Fame inductees"],"headings":["Development","Depiction","Spot","Reception","Footnotes","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/09/DataTNG.jpg/250px-DataTNG.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Wikiquote-logo-en.svg/40px-Wikiquote-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Symbol_book_class2.svg/16px-Symbol_book_class2.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg/16px-Portal-puzzle.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/People_icon.svg/16px-People_icon.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["android","robot"],["list_of_star_trek_planets","m–q#o"],["uss_enterprise","ncc-1701-d"],["uss_enterprise","ncc-1701-e"],["list_of_star_trek_characters","n–s#noonien_soong"],["android","robot"],["uss_enterprise","ncc-1701-d"],["uss_enterprise","ncc-1701-e"],["lore","star_trek"],["b-4","star_trek"],["list_of_star_trek_characters","a–f#c"],["lore","star_trek"],["transporter","star_trek"],["borg","star_trek"],["robot_series","asimov"],["list_of_star_trek_characters","a–f#b"],["borg","star_trek#borg_queen"],["borg","star_trek"],["borg","star_trek#borg_queen"],["list_of_star_trek_characters","a–f#d"],["somali","cat"],["transporter","star_trek"],["droid","robot"]],"members":["lore","android","robot_series","list_of_star_trek_characters","somali","uss_enterprise","droid","transporter","list_of_star_trek_planets","borg"],"related":["Android_(robot)","Male","United_Federation_of_Planets","Starfleet","USS_Enterprise_(NCC-1701-D)","USS_Enterprise_(NCC-1701-E)","Brent_Spiner","Brent_Spiner","Television_series","Sentient","Android_(robot)","Second_mate","Chief_operations_officer","Starship","USS_Enterprise_(NCC-1701-D)","USS_Enterprise_(NCC-1701-E)","Positronic_brain","Human_behavior","Encounter_at_Farpoint","Emotion","Idiosyncrasies","Spock","Leonard_Nimoy","Gene_Roddenberry","Brent_Spiner","Charlie_Chaplin","Method_acting","Lore_(Star_Trek)","Noonien_Soong","B-4_(Star_Trek)","Stephen_Hawking","These_Are_the_Voyages...","Datalore","Starfleet_Academy","Starfleet","Jean-Luc_Picard","Lore_(Star_Trek)","Transporter_(Star_Trek)","Borg_(Star_Trek)","Isaac_Asimov","Philip_K._Dick","Artificial_intelligence","Reality","Human_condition","Robot_series_(Asimov)","Three_Laws_of_Robotics","Bit","Pebibyte","Lucasian_Professor_of_Mathematics","University_of_Cambridge","Polywater","Borg_(Star_Trek)","Geordi_LaForge","Tasha_Yar","Pet","Cat","Data's_Day","Somali_(cat)","Tabby_cat","Kitten","Shapeshifting","Transporter_(Star_Trek)","A_Fistful_of_Datas","Iguana","Reptile","Starfleet_ranks_and_insignia","William_Riker","Geordi_La_Forge","Worf","Allergy","Starfleet_ranks_and_insignia","Reginald_Barclay","Deleted_scene","Worf","Sex_symbol","Droid_(robot)","Carnegie_Mellon_University","Robot_Hall_of_Fame","Carnegie_Science_Center","Pittsburgh,_Pennsylvania","The_Pitt_News","The_Beat_Fleet","Croatia","Hip_hop_music","Croatian_Radiotelevision","Nerdcore_hip_hop"]}
