{"cursor":"2374","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Specific force' is defined as the non-gravitational force per unit mass.\n: \\mbox{Specific Force} = \\frac{\\mathrm{Force_{non-gravitational}}}}\n\nSpecific force (also called g-force and mass-specific force) is measured in\nmeters/secondÂ² (mÂ·s â2 ) which is the units for acceleration. Thus,\nspecific force is not actually a force, but a type of acceleration. However, the\n(mass-)specific force is not a coordinate-acceleration, but rather a proper\nacceleration, which is the acceleration relative to free-fall. Forces, specific\nforces, and proper accelerations are the same in all reference frames, but\ncoordinate accelerations are frame-dependent. For free bodies, the specific\nforce is the cause of, and a measure of, the body's proper acceleration.\n\nThe g-force acceleration is the same as the specific force. The acceleration of\nan object free falling towards the earth depends on the reference frame (it\ndisappears in the free-fall frame, also called the inertial frame), but any g-\nforce \"acceleration\" will be present in all frames. This specific force is zero\nfor freely-falling objects, since gravity acting alone does not produce g-forces\nor specific forces.\n\nAccelerometers on the surface of the Earth measure a constant 9.8 m/s^2\neven when they are not accelerating (that is, when they do not undergo\ncoordinate acceleration). This is because accelerometers measure the proper\nacceleration produced by the g-force exerted by the ground (gravity acting alone\nnever produces g-force or specific force). Accelerometers measure specific force\n(proper acceleration), which is the acceleration relative to free-\nfall, www.strapdownassociates.com/Accels%20Measure.pdf not the\n\"standard\" acceleration that is relative to a coordinate system.\n","linknr":101,"url":"Specific_force","recorded":1362375093,"links":14,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Physical quantities","Hydraulic engineering","Acceleration"],"headings":["Hydraulics","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/math/b/a/8/ba87b93616ee590feae56e1edaa5f687.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/d/8/d/d8df9f3954aeda13d0cf2715dfe6aba4.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/4/d/e4d94c7e720c127bbf461f21044fb368.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/6/9/7694f4a66316e53c8cdd9d9954bd611d.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/6/e/7/6e71a09d03e069b43003bb718366018c.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/1/5/415290769594460e2e485922904f345d.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/54/Science.jpg/30px-Science.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Force","Mass","G-force","Metre_per_second_squared","Proper_acceleration","Proper_acceleration","Proper_acceleration","G-force","Proper_acceleration","Hydraulic_engineering","Acceleration","Proper_acceleration"]}
