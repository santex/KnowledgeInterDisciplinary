It runs\nan online swimming website (known as SwimInfo prior to 2006).\n\nIn its earliest form, Junior Swimmer began as a mimeograph/newsletter published\nby Peter Daland in the summer of 1952. In 1960, Coach Daland passed the\nresponsibility of the project to Albert Schoenfeld due to Daland's greater\ncoaching demands as the swim coach at the University of Southern California and\nthe Los Angeles Athletic Club.\n\nThe publication then combined with Swimming World in June 1961. Swimming World\nwas a mimeograph/newsletter published for the previous 10 years by Robert J. H.\nKiphuth. The newly constituted magazine was then known as Junior Swimmer-\nSwimming World.\n\nThe magazine has a monthly publication rate of roughly 50,000 issues.
