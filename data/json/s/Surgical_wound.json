{"cursor":"37774","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n at the Fitzsimons Army Medical Center.]] 'Surgery' (from the cheirourgikÄ\n (composed of ÏÎµÎ¯Ï, \"hand\", and Î­ÏÎ³Î¿Î½, \"work\"), via , meaning \"hand work\") is an\n ancient medical specialty that uses operative manual and instrumental\n techniques on a patient to investigate and/or treat a pathological condition\n such as disease or injury, or to help improve bodily function or appearance.\n\nAn act of performing surgery may be called a surgical procedure, 'operation', or\nsimply 'surgery'. In this context, the verb 'operate' means to perform surgery.\nThe adjective 'surgical' means pertaining to surgery; e.g. surgical instruments\nor surgical nurse. The patient or subject on which the surgery is performed can\nbe a person or an animal. A surgeon is a person who practises surgery. Persons\ndescribed as surgeons are commonly physicians, but the term is also applied to\npodiatrists, dentists (known as oral and maxillofacial surgeons) and\nveterinarians. A surgery can last from minutes to hours, but is typically not an\nongoing or periodic type of treatment. The term surgery can also refer to the\nplace where surgery is performed, or simply the office of a physician, dentist,\nor veterinarian.\n\nElective surgery generally refers to a surgical procedure that can be scheduled\nin advance because it does not involve a medical emergency. Plastic, or cosmetic\nsurgeries are common elective procedures.\n","linknr":2121,"url":"Surgical_wound","recorded":1362500923,"links":135,"instances":["physician","paranormal","medicine","medicine","microbiology","medicine","surgery","clothing","tooth","physician"],"pdf":["http://choosingwisely.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/5things_12_factsheet_Amer_Coll_Radiology.pdf","http://choosingwisely.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/5things_12_factsheet_Amer_Coll_Radiology.pdf","http://www.acr.org/~/media/ACR/Documents/AppCriteria/Diagnostic/RoutineAdmissionAndPreoperativeChestRadiography.pdf","http://www.acr.org/~/media/ACR/Documents/AppCriteria/Diagnostic/RoutineAdmissionAndPreoperativeChestRadiography.pdf","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-789X.2009.00700.x/pdf"],"categories":["Surgery|*"],"headings":["Definitions
