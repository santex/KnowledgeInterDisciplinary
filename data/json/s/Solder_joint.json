{"cursor":"49879","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Soldering' is a process in which two or more metal items are joined together\nby melting and flowing a filler metal (solder) into the joint, the filler\nmetal having a lower melting point than the workpiece. Soldering differs from\nwelding in that soldering does not involve melting the work pieces. In\nbrazing, the filler metal melts at a higher temperature, but the workpiece\nmetal does not melt. Formerly nearly all solders contained lead, but\nenvironmental concerns have increasingly dictated use of lead-free alloys for\nelectronics and plumbing purposes.\n","linknr":455,"url":"Solder_joint","recorded":1362486671,"links":60,"instances":["chemistry","metallurgy","weatherproofing","optics","metallurgy"],"pdf":["http://www.goldbulletin.org/assets/file/goldbulletin/downloads/Colbus_2_7.pdf","http://www.coherent.com/Downloads/circuitsassembly0204Rev2.pdf","http://www.coherent.com/Downloads/circuitsassembly0204Rev2.pdf","http://www.vincenc.com.tw/download/Full%20color%20%20Hi%20POWER%20LED%20Application%20Note.pdf","http://www.vincenc.com.tw/download/Full%20color%20%20Hi%20POWER%20LED%20Application%20Note.pdf","http://www.dklmetals.co.uk/PDF%20Files/Factorfiction.pdf","http://europa.eu/eur-lex/pri/en/oj/dat/2003/l_037/l_03720030213en00190023.pdf"],"categories":["Brazing
