{"cursor":"11353","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\n'Software development' (also known as 'application development', 'software\ndesign', 'designing software', 'software application development', 'enterprise\napplication development', or 'platform development') is the\ndevelopment of a software product. The term \"software development\" may be used\nto refer to the activity of computer programming, which is the process of\nwriting and maintaining the source code, but in a broader sense of the term it\nincludes all that is involved between the conception of the desired software\nthrough to the final manifestation of the software, ideally in a planned and\nstructured process. Therefore, software development may include\nresearch, new development, prototyping, modification, reuse, re-engineering,\nmaintenance, or any other activities that result in software\nproducts.\n\nSoftware can be developed for a variety of purposes, the three most common being\nto meet specific needs of a specific client/business (the case with custom\nsoftware), to meet a perceived need of some set of potential users (the case\nwith commercial and open source software), or for personal use (e.g. a scientist\nmay write software to automate a mundane task). 'Embedded software development',\nthat is, the development of embedded software such as used for controlling\nconsumer products, requires the development process to be integrated with the\ndevelopment of the controlled physical product.\n\nThe need for better quality control of the software development process has\ngiven rise to the discipline of software engineering, which aims to apply the\nsystematic approach exemplified in the engineering paradigm to the process of\nsoftware development.\n","linknr":438,"url":"Software_development","recorded":1362477546,"links":52,"instances":["computing"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Software development|*","Marketing","Software project management","Project management","Computer occupations","Product development"],"headings":["Overview","Software development topic","See also","References","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/64/Coding_Shots_Annual_Plan_high_res-5.jpg/220px-Coding_Shots_Annual_Plan_high_res-5.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/12px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["user","computing"]],"members":["user"],"related":["Software","Computer_programming","Source_code","Custom_software","User_(computing)","Commercial_software","Open_source_software","Embedded_software","Quality_control","Software_engineering","Engineering","Software_Lifecycle_Processes","Software_development_process_models","Market_research","Demographics","Marketing","Software_feature","Alan_M._Davis","Human_resources","Risk_management","Intellectual_property","Budgeting","Crisis_management","Business_development","Software_development_methodology","Structure","Plan","Information_system","Application_software","Aspect-Oriented_Software_Development","Bachelor_of_Science_in_Information_Technology","Bus_factor","Capability_Maturity_Model","Computer_programmer","Consulting_software_engineer","Custom_software","Functional_specification","Incremental_funding_methodology","Marketing_strategies_for_product_software","Offshore_software_development","Search_Based_Software_Engineering","Service-Oriented_Modeling","Software_blueprint","Software_design","Software_developer","Software_development_effort_estimation","Software_development_process","Software_engineer","Software_industry","Software_project_management","Software_publisher","System_software","User_experience","Video_game_development","Web_application_development"]}
