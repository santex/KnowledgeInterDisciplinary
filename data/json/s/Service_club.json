{"cursor":"3604","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nA 'service club' or 'service organization' is a voluntary non-profit\norganization where members meet regularly to perform charitable works either by\ndirect hands-on efforts or by raising money for other organizations. A service\nclub is defined first by its service mission. Second its membership benefits,\nsuch as social occasions, networking, and personal growth opportunities\nencourage involvement. [http://www.amazon.com/Service-Clubs-American-Society-\nKiwanis/dp/0252020154 review of Charles, Jeffrey, \"Service Clubs in American\nSociety\"]\n\nA service organization is not necessarily exclusive of ideological motives,\nalthough organizations with such defined motives are more likely to identify\nthemselves through their association. Much like the historical religious\norganizations formed the basis for many of societal institutions, such as\nhospitals, service organizations perform many essential services for their\ncommunity and other worthy causes. In the United States, some of these clubs\nusually also have a component club organization that is a tax exempt, 501(c)(3)\nnon-profit organization.\n\nMany of today's service clubs got their start as social clubs for business\nnetworking, but quickly evolved into organizations devoted more to service and\nless for networking, although networking is still a primary reason for many\nmembers to join.\n\nHistorically, most service clubs consist of community-based groups that share\nthe same name, goals, membership requirements, and meeting structure. Many of\nthese clubs meet weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly on a recurring established day\nand time, commonly at a mealtime. Most of these clubs started with a single club\nin a single city, but then replicated themselves by organizing similar clubs in\nother communities. Many of the service club organizations have become world-wide\nmovements, and have obtained official recognition by the United Nations and\nvarious governments as non-government organizations\n\nService clubs in this article do not refer to the term \"service club\" used in\nthe United Kingdom, Australia, and some other Commonwealth countries, in which\nthose groups consist of clubs for members of \"the services\", a common\nexpression for the military or uniformed forces. In the western hemisphere,\nthese types of clubs are commonly known as veterans' organizations or veterans'\nfraternal groups.\n\nThe world's first service club, the Rotary Club of Chicago, was formed in 1905\nby Paul P. Harris, an attorney who wanted to create in a professional club\nwith the same friendly spirit he had felt in the small towns of his youth. The\nRotary name derived from the early practice of rotating meetings among\nmembers' offices.\n","linknr":113,"url":"Service_club","recorded":1374859480,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Service_club&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Service_club&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:ADDHIST","/wiki/Wikipedia:Systemic_bias","/wiki/Volunteer","/wiki/Non-profit_organization","/wiki/Charity_(practice)","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Religious","/wiki/Hospital","/wiki/Causes","/wiki/501(c)(3)","/wiki/Non-profit_organization","/wiki/United_Nations","/wiki/Non-government_organizations","/wiki/United_Kingdom","/wiki/Australia","/w/index.php?title=Service_club&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Apex_Clubs_of_Australia","/wiki/Altrusa_International","/wiki/Junior_Chamber_International","/wiki/Sertoma","/wiki/Rotary_International","/wiki/Kiwanis","/wiki/Lions_International","/wiki/National_Exchange_Club","/wiki/Optimist_International","/wiki/Soroptimists","/wiki/Kin_Canada","/wiki/Zonta_International","/wiki/Alpha_Phi_Omega","/w/index.php?title=Little_Sisters_of_the_Gold_Rose&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Little_Sisters_of_the_Pearls_and_Rubies&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Cosmopolitan_International&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Hands_On_Network","/wiki/BEAN_(charity)","/wiki/Do_Something","/w/index.php?title=Service_club&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-1","http://www.amazon.com/Service-Clubs-American-Society-Kiwanis/dp/0252020154","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Service_club&oldid=540800401","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Fraternal_service_organizations","/wiki/Category:Community_building","/wiki/Category:Articles_lacking_historical_information","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Service+club&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Service+club","/wiki/Service_club","/wiki/Talk:Service_club","#","/wiki/Service_club","/w/index.php?title=Service_club&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Service_club&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf8/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Service_club","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Service_club","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Service_club&oldid=540800401","/w/index.php?title=Service_club&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Service_club&id=540800401","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Service+club","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Service+club&oldid=540800401&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Service_club&printable=yes","//de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-Club","//fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Club_service","//id.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organisasi_Pelayanan_Manusia","//it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Club_di_servizio","//nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serviceclub","//pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clube_de_servi%C3%A7o","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1897098#sitelinks","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_club","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf8/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","/w/index.php?title=MediaWiki:Gadget-ReferenceTooltips.js&action=raw&ctype=text/javascript&508635914","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&
