Six Sigma became well known after Jack Welch made it a\ncentral focus of his business strategy at General Electric in 1995, and today it is used in different sectors of industry. >[http://my.safaribooksonline.com/search/SIX+SIGMA\" SAFARI BOOKS\nONLINE] \n\nSix Sigma seeks to improve the quality of process outputs by identifying and\nremoving the causes of defects (errors) and minimizing variability in\nmanufacturing and business processes. It uses a set of\nquality management methods, including statistical methods, and creates a special\ninfrastructure of people within the organization (\"Champions\", \"Black Belts\",\n\"Green Belts\", \"Orange Belts\", etc.) who are experts in these very complex\nmethods. Each Six Sigma project carried out within an\norganization follows a defined sequence of steps and has quantified financial\ntargets (cost reduction and/or profit increase).\n\nThe term Six Sigma originated from terminology associated with 'manufacturing',\nspecifically terms associated with statistical modeling of manufacturing\nprocesses. The maturity of a manufacturing process can be described by a sigma\nrating indicating its yield or the percentage of defect-free products it\ncreates. A six sigma process is one in which 99.99966% of the products\nmanufactured are statistically expected to be free of defects (3.4 defects per\nmillion), although, as discussed below, this defect level corresponds to only a\n4.5 sigma level. Motorola set a goal of \"six sigma\" for all of its manufacturing\noperations, and this goal became a byword for the management and engineering\npractices used to achieve it.\n","linknr":877,"url":"Six_Sigma","recorded":1362568156,"links":57,"instances":["statistical_software","software","motorola_engineer"],"pdf":["http://www.lasaterinstitute.com/casestudy/Healthcare/Commonwealth%20Health%20Corporation(Lean%20Six%20Sigma).pdf","http://www.ibisuva.nl/assets/files/sixsigmahealthcare2005.pdf","http://www.ibisuva.nl/assets/files/jhq-dekoning.pdf","http://www.sbtionline.com/files/Wall_Street_Journal_SBTI_Rebuttal.pdf","http://www.sbtionline.com/files/Wall_Street_Journal_SBTI_Rebuttal.pdf","http://www.som.cranfield.ac.uk/som/dinamic-content/research/cbp/CBPupdate1-SixSigmaFriendOrFoe.pdf","http://www.som.cranfield.ac.uk/som/dinamic-content/research/cbp/CBPupdate1-SixSigmaFriendOrFoe.pdf","http://xa.yimg.com/kq/groups/18751725/636586767/name/twelve+P+value+misconceptions.pdf"],"categories":["Business
