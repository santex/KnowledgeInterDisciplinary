India.]]\n\nA 'school' is an institution designed for the teaching of students (or \"pupils\")\nunder the direction of teachers. Most countries have systems of formal\neducation, which is commonly compulsory. In these systems, students progress\nthrough a series of schools. The names for these schools vary by country\n(discussed in the Regional section below), but generally include primary school\nfor young children and secondary school for teenagers who have completed primary\neducation. An institution where higher education is taught, is commonly called a\nuniversity college or university.\n\nIn addition to these core schools, students in a given country may also attend\nschools before and after primary and secondary education. Kindergarten or pre-\nschool provide some schooling to very young children (typically ages 3–5).\nUniversity, vocational school, college or seminary may be available after\nsecondary school. A school may also be dedicated to one particular field, such\nas a school of economics or a school of dance. Alternative schools may provide\nnontraditional curriculum and methods.\n\nThere are also non-government schools, called private schools. Private schools\nmay be required when the government does not supply adequate, or special\neducation. Other private schools can also be religious, such as Christian\nschools, hawzas, yeshivas, and others; or schools that have a higher standard of\neducation or seek to foster other personal achievements. Schools for adults\ninclude institutions of corporate training, Military education and training and\nbusiness schools.\n\nIn homeschooling and online schools, teaching and learning take place outside of\na traditional school building.\n","title":"school","headings":["Etymology","History and development of schools","Regional terms","School ownership and operation","Components of most schools","School security","School health services","Online schools and classes","Stress","Discipline","See also","References","Further reading"]},"micro-relation":["6: University","3: College","3: Grammar_school","2: Education","2: Primary_school","2: Secondary_school","2: Kindergarten","2: Vocational_school","2: Gurukul","2: Europe","2: India","1: Institution","1: Student","1: Teacher","1: Compulsory_education","1: Higher_education","1: University_college","1: Seminary","1: Alternative_school","1: Christian_school","1: Hawza","1: Yeshiva","1: Corporate_training","1: Military_education_and_training","1: Business_schools","1: Homeschooling","1: E-learning","1: Greek_language","1: Leisure","1: Mosaic","1: Pompeii","1: Classical_antiquity","1: Ancient_Greece","1: Academy","1: Ancient_Rome","1: Education_in_Ancient_Rome","1: History_of_India","1: History_of_China","1: History_of_education_in_China","1: Byzantine_Empire","1: Soldier","1: Islam","1: Mosque","1: Madrassa","1: Caliph","1: Nizamiyya","1: Nizam_al-Mulk","1: Ottomans","1: Bursa","1: Edirne","1: Külliye","1: Health_care","1: Scholasticism","1: Middle_Ages","1: Early_Modern","1: Latin","1: Denmark-Norway","1: One-room_school","1: Kid_hack","1: School_bus","1: The_Gambia","1: Catholic_Diocese_of_Madras","1: United_Kingdom","1: Pre-school","1: Nursery_school","1: Infant_school","1: Junior_school","1: Comprehensive_school","1: Secondary_modern","1: Her_Majesty's_Inspectorate_of_Education","1: Ofsted","1: Estyn","1: State_schools","1: North_American_English","1: Commonwealth_of_Nations","1: Australia","1: New_Zealand","1: Pakistan","1: Bangladesh","1: Sri_Lanka","1: South_Africa","1: Kenya","1: Tanzania","1: Hindu","1: Madrasah","1: Central_Board_for_Secondary_Education","1: Primary_education","1: Secondary_education","1: Gesamtschule","1: Hauptschule","1: Realschule","1: Tertiary_education","1: Eastern_Europe","1: World_War_II","1: Vocational_education","1: North_America","1: Preschool","1: Toddler","1: Elementary_school","1: Middle_school","1: Senior_high_school","1: Graduate_school","1: United_States","1: State_education_agency","1: Charter_schools","1: Private_school","1: School_voucher","1: Parochial_schools","1: Toronto_District_School_Board","1: Classroom","1: Cafeteria","1: Lunch","1: Breakfast","1: Gym","1: Sports","1: Physical_education","1: Auditorium","1: Office","1: Library","1: Laboratories","1: Computer_labs","1: Surveillance","1: Metal_detectors#Security_screening","1: Video_surveillance","1: Door_numbering","1: Bomb_threat","1: Gang","1: Vandalism","1: Bullying","1: School_Net_Namibia","1: Work-related_stress","1: Teacher_education","1: Critical_pedagogy","1: Self-esteem","1: Hierarchy_of_needs","1: Bullying_in_teaching","1: List_of_colleges_and_universities_by_country","1: List_of_schools_by_country","1: List_of_songs_about_school","1: List_of_television_series_about_school","1: Music_school","1: School_and_university_in_literature","1: School_bullying","1: Schooliosis","1: Student_transport","1: Teaching_for_social_justice","1: University-preparatory_school","1: Year-round_school","1: State_University_of_New_York","1: University_of_Colorado_Press","1: Boulder,_Colorado"]}
