{"cursor":"1051","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"]] 'Suspensory behavior', exhibited by primates, is a form of arboreal\nlocomotion or a feeding behavior which involves hanging or suspension of the\nbody below or among the branches, rather than moving or sitting on top of the\nbranches. This includes brachiation, climbing, and bridging, and allows larger\nspecies to distribute their weight among smaller branches rather than balancing\nabove these weak supports. Ruffed lemurs, sifakas,\nspider monkeys, gibbons, and orangutans are examples of primates that exhibit\nsuspensory behaviors.\n","linknr":95,"url":"Suspensory_behavior","recorded":1362537870,"links":26,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Arboreal locomotion","Eating behaviors"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8d/Varecia_variegata_suspensory_posture1.jpg/220px-Varecia_variegata_suspensory_posture1.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4e/Cebus_capucinus.png/40px-Cebus_capucinus.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Primate","Arboreal_locomotion","List_of_feeding_behaviours","Brachiation","Arboreal_locomotion","Ruffed_lemur","Sifaka","Spider_monkey","Gibbon","Orangutan"]}
