Hilton describes Shangri-La as a mystical, harmonious valley,\ngently guided from a lamasery, enclosed in the western end of the Kunlun\nMountains. Shangri-La has become synonymous with any earthly paradise, and\nparticularly a mythical Himalayan utopia — a permanently happy land, isolated\nfrom the outside world. In the novel Lost Horizon, the people who live at Shangri-\nLa are almost immortal, living years beyond the normal lifespan and only very\nslowly aging in appearance. The word also evokes the imagery of exoticism of\nthe Orient. In the ancient Tibetan scriptures, existence of seven such places\nis mentioned as Nghe-Beyul Khimpalung.<ref name=\"National Park\nbrochure\">{{cite book\n  | last = Shrestha | first = Dr. Tirtha Bahadur coauthors = Joshi, Rabindra Man\n  | and Sangam, Khagendra title = The Makalu-Barun National Park & Buffer Zone\n  | Brochure publisher = Makalu-Barun National Park | year = July 2009\n}}</ref> Khembalung is one of several [[beyul]]s (\"hidden lands\" similar to\nShangri-La) believed to have been created by Padmasambhava in the 8th century\nas idyllic, sacred places of refuge for Buddhists during times of strife\n(Reinhard 1978).\n\nMany scholars believe that Shangri-La is Shambhala, a mythical kingdom in\nTibetan Buddhist tradition, which was sought by Eastern and Western\nexplorers.<ref name=\"ShambhalaFacinating\"></ref>\n",
