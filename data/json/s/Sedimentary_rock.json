{"cursor":"55389","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" marginal marine sequence of siltstones (below) and limestones (above), Virgin\n Formation, southwestern Utah, USA]]\n\n'Sedimentary rocks' are types of rock that are formed by the deposition of\nmaterial at the Earth's surface and within bodies of water. Sedimentation is the\ncollective name for processes that cause mineral and/or organic particles\n(detritus) to settle and accumulate or minerals to precipitate from a solution.\nParticles that form a sedimentary rock by accumulating are called sediment.\nBefore being deposited, sediment was formed by weathering and erosion in a\nsource area, and then transported to the place of deposition by water, wind,\nice, mass movement or glaciers which are called agents of denudation.\n\nThe sedimentary rock cover of the continents of the Earth's crust is extensive,\nbut the total contribution of sedimentary rocks is estimated to be only 8% of\nthe total volume of the crust. Buchner & Grapes (2011), p. 24\nSedimentary rocks are only a thin veneer over a crust consisting mainly of\nigneous and metamorphic rocks. Sedimentary rocks are deposited in layers as\nstrata, forming a structure called bedding. The study of sedimentary rocks and\nrock strata provides information about the subsurface that is useful for civil\nengineering, for example in the construction of roads, houses, tunnels, canals\nor other constructions. Sedimentary rocks are also important sources of natural\nresources like coal, fossil fuels, drinking water or ores.\n\nThe study of the sequence of sedimentary rock strata is the main source for\nscientific knowledge about the Earth's history, including palaeogeography,\npaleoclimatology and the history of life. The scientific discipline that studies\nthe properties and origin of sedimentary rocks is called sedimentology.\nSedimentology is both part of geology and physical geography and overlaps partly\nwith other disciplines in the Earth sciences, such as pedology, geomorphology,\ngeochemistry or structural geology.\n","linknr":977,"url":"Sedimentary_rock","recorded":1362372870,"links":95,"instances":["geology","geology","geology","geology","environmental","chemistry","geology","geology","geology","geology","geology","stream","geology","geology","mechanics","chemistry","geology","geology","geology","sediment","biology","chemical_science","district","mathematics","geology","soil","soil_study","earth_sciences","geology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Sedimentary
