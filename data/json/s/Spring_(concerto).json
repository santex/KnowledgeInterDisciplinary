The texture of each concerto is\nvaried, each resembling its respective season. For example, \"Winter\" is peppered\nwith silvery pizzicato notes from the high strings, calling to mind icy rain,\nwhereas \"Summer\" evokes a thunderstorm in its final movement, which is why the\nmovement is often dubbed \"Storm\".\n\nThe concertos were first published in 1725 as part of a set of twelve concerti,\nVivaldi's Op. 8, entitled 'Il cimento dell'armonia e dell'inventione' (The\nContest Between Harmony and Invention). The first four concertos were designated\nLe quattro stagioni, each being named after a season. Each one is in three\nmovements, with a slow movement between two faster ones. At the time of writing\nThe Four Seasons, the modern solo form of the concerto had not yet been defined\n(typically a solo instrument and accompanying orchestra). Vivaldi's original\narrangement for solo violin with string quartet and basso continuo helped to\ndefine the form of the concerto.\n","linknr":271,"url":"Spring_(concerto)","recorded":1362575285,"links":59,"instances":["music","music","music"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Compositions by Antonio Vivaldi","Violin concertos","1723 works","United States National Recording Registry recordings"],"headings":["List of concertos and movements","Sonnets and allusions","Media","Recordings","Derivative works","Covers","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/38px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["texture","music"],["movement","music"],["organ","music"]],"members":["movement","organ","texture"],"related":["Violin_concerto","Antonio_Vivaldi","Baroque_music","Texture_(music)","Pizzicato","Movement_(music)","Opus_number","Il_cimento_dell'armonia_e_dell'inventione","String_quartet","Basso_continuo","Ryom_Verzeichnis","Sonnet","Program_music","Alfredo_Campoli","Acetate_disc","Bernardino_Molinari","Italy","Grammophone_record","LP_album","Louis_Kaufman","Henry_Swoboda","Harpsichord","Organ_(music)","Grand_Prix_du_Disque","Grammy_Hall_of_Fame","National_Recording_Registry","Library_of_Congress","Zürich","Vivaldi","I_Musici","Felix_Ayo","I_Musici","Felix_Ayo","Pina_Carmirelli","Mariana_Sîrbu","Academy_of_St_Martin_in_the_Fields","Neville_Marriner","Alan_Loveday","Norman_Lebrecht","Nigel_Kennedy","English_Chamber_Orchestra","Gil_Shaham","Orpheus_Chamber_Orchestra","The_Weather_Channel","Michel_Corrette","Psalms","1997","Jacques_Loussier","Max_Richter","Celtic_Woman","Chloë_Agnew","Hayley_Westenra","English_language"]}
