In theoretical terms, the idea of\n\"sovereignty\", historically, from Socrates to Thomas Hobbes, has always\nnecessitated a moral imperative on the entity exercising it.\n\nFor centuries past, the idea that a state could be sovereign was always\nconnected to its ability to guarantee the best interests of its own citizens.\nThus, if a state could not act in the best interests of its own citizens, it\ncould not be thought of as a “sovereign” state.<ref></ref>\n\nThe concept of sovereignty has been discussed throughout history, from the time\nof the Romans through to the present day. It has changed in its definition,\nconcept, and application throughout, especially during the Age of Enlightenment.\nThe current notion of state sovereignty contains four aspects consisting of\nterritory, population, authority and recognition.<ref></ref> According to\nStephen D. Krasner, the term could also be understood in four different ways:\n* domestic sovereignty – actual control over a state exercised by an authority\n  organized within this state,<ref name=Krasner></ref>\n* interdependence sovereignty – actual control of movement across state's\n  borders, assuming the borders exist,<ref name=Krasner/>\n* international legal sovereignty – formal recognition by other sovereign\n  states,<ref name=Krasner/>\n* Westphalian sovereignty – lack of other authority over state than the domestic\n  authority (examples of such other authorities could be a non-domestic church,\n  a non-domestic political organization, or any other external agent).<ref\n  name=Krasner/>\n\nOften, these four aspects all appear together, but this is not necessarily the\ncase – they are not affected by one another, and there are historical examples\nof states that were non-sovereign in one aspect while at the same time being\nsovereign in another of these aspects.<ref name=Krasner/> According to Immanuel\nWallerstein, another fundamental feature of sovereignty is that its a claim that\nmust be recognised by others if there is to have any meaning: \"Sovereignty is\nmore than anything else a matter of legitimacy [...that] requires reciprocal\nrecognition. Sovereignty is a hypothetical trade, in which two potentially\nconflicting sides, respecting de facto realities of power, exchange such\nrecognitions as their least costly strategy.\"<ref></ref>\n",
