Like the UK party, it has a centre-right\npolitical philosophy which promotes conservatism and strong British Unionism.\nIts leader in the Scottish Parliament is Ruth Davidson MSP, who has held the\npost since 2011.\n\nIt was established in 1965, when the previously separate Unionist Party was\nmerged into the Conservative Party of England and Wales, to form the basis of\nthe modern UK Conservative Party. The Unionist Party (unionist in the sense of\npreserving the United Kingdom), in alliance with a small number of Liberal\nUnionist and National Liberal politicians, had always taken the Conservative\nwhip at Westminster and had been the dominant force in Scottish politics from\nthe 1930s to the late 1950s.

From the early 1960s that\nrole was taken by the Labour Party and the Scottish Conservatives went into a\nstate of decline, which culminated in the loss of all Scottish Conservative\nseats in 1997.\n\nThe Scottish Conservatives have yet to see a revival of fortunes following the\n1997 wipeout; only one Conservative MP was returned to Westminster for a\nScottish constituency at the general elections of 2001, 2005 and 2010. In the\nScottish Parliament, the Scottish Conservatives currently control 16 of the 129\nseats, with 12 of these seats won through the system of proportional\nrepresentation. The party has one of the six Scottish seats in the European\nParliament. In March 2006, the party was thought to have around 16,500 members\nin Scotland.
