[http://ibot.sav.sk/icbn/main.htm online here]\n\nThe purpose of a formal name is to have a single name that is accepted and used\nworldwide for a particular plant or plant group. For example, the botanical name\n[[Bellis perennis]] denotes a plant species which is native to most of the\ncountries of Europe and the Middle East, where it has accumulated various names\nin many languages. Later it has been introduced worldwide, bringing it into\ncontact with more languages. English names for this plant species include:\ndaisy, [http://www.ecoflora.co.uk/search_species2.php?plant_no=1690050020\nEcological Flora of the British Isles] English daisy, [http://www.ars-grin.gov/cgi-\nbin/npgs/html/taxon.pl?6728 USDA Germplasm Resources Information Network]\nlawndaisy. [http://plants.usda.gov/java/profile?symbol=BEPE2 USDA PLANTS\ndatabase] The cultivar [[Bellis perennis]] 'Aucubifolia' is a golden-\nvariegated horticultural selection of this species.\n\nThe botanical name itself is fixed by a type, which is a particular specimen (or\nin some cases a group of specimens) of an organism to which the scientific name\nis formally attached. In other words, a type is an example that serves to anchor\nor centralize the defining features of that particular taxon.\n\nThe usefulness of botanical names is limited by the fact that taxonomic groups\nare not fixed in size; a taxon may have a varying , depending on the , thus, the\ngroup that a particular botanical name refers to can be quite small according to\nsome people and quite big according to others. For example, the traditional view\nof the family Malvaceae has been expanded in some modern approaches to include\nwhat were formerly considered to be several closely related families. Some\nbotanical names refer to groups that are very stable (for example Equisetaceae,\nMagnoliaceae) while for other names a careful check is needed to see which\ncircumscription is being used (for example Fabaceae, Spiraeoideae, [[Taraxacum\nofficinale]]).\n\nDepending on rank, botanical names may be in one part (genus and above), two\nparts (species and above, but below the rank of genus) or three parts (below the\nrank of species):\n\n;in one part :Plantae (the plants) :Marchantiophyta (the liverworts)\n:Magnoliopsida (class including the family Magnoliaceae) :Liliidae (subclass\nincluding the family Liliaceae) :Pinophyta (the conifers) :Fagaceae (the\nbeech family)\n:[[birch|Betula]] (the birch genus)\n\n;in two parts\n:[[Acacia]] subg. Phyllodineae (the wattles) [[Berberis thunbergii]] (Japanese\n:barberry)\n\n;in three parts:\n:[[Calystegia sepium]] subsp. americana (American hedge bindweed) [[Crataegus\n:azarolus]] var. pontica (a Mediterranean hawthorn)\n\nA name in three parts, i.e., an infraspecific name (a name for a taxon below the\nrank of species) needs a \"connecting term\" to indicate rank. In the Calystegia\nexample above, this is \"subsp.\" (for subspecies). In botany there are many ranks\nbelow that of species (in zoology there is only one such rank, subspecies, so\nthat this \"connecting term\" is unnecessary there). A name of a \"subdivision of a\ngenus\" also needs a connecting term (in the Acacia example above, this is\n\"subg.\", subgenus). The connecting term is not part of the name itself.\n\nA taxon may be indicated by a listing in more than three parts: \"Saxifraga\naizoon var. aizoon subvar. brevifolia f. multicaulis subf. surculosa Engl. &\nIrmsch.\" but this is a classification, not a formal botanical name. The\nbotanical name is Saxifraga aizoon subf. surculosa Engl. & Irmsch. (ICBN Art\n24: Ex 1).\n\nGeneric, specific, and infraspecific botanical names are usually printed in\nitalics. The example set by the ICBN is to italicize all botanical names,\nincluding those above genus, though the ICBN preface states: \"The Code sets no\nbinding standard in this respect, as typography is a matter of editorial style\nand tradition not of nomenclature\". Most peer-reviewed scientific botanical\npublications do not italicize names above the rank of genus, and non-botanical\nscientific publications do not, which is in keeping with two of the three other\nkinds of scientific name; zoological and bacterial (viral names above genus are\nitalicized, a new policy adopted in the early 1990s).\n","linknr":244,"url":"Specific_name_(botany)","recorded":1362375082,"links":26,"instances":["botany","botany","botany","botany","botany","botany","botany"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Botanical nomenclature|"],"headings":["Binary name","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/29/English_Daisy_%28Bellis_Perennis%29.jpg/233px-English_Daisy_%28Bellis_Perennis%29.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/1859-Martinique.web.jpg/100px-1859-Martinique.web.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["type","botany"],["rank","botany"],["infraspecific_name","botany"],["infraspecific_name","botany"],["rank","botany"],["infraspecific_name","botany"],["section","botany"],["series","botany"],["correct_name","botany"],["author_citation","botany"]],"members":["author_citation","infraspecific_name","correct_name","section","type","rank","series"],"related":["Scientific_name","Cultigen","Cultivar","Cultivar_group","Cyanobacteria","Fungus","Chytridiomycota","Oomycete","Slime_moulds","Photosynthesis","Protist","Europe","Middle_East","Type_(botany)","Malvaceae","Equisetaceae","Magnoliaceae","Fabaceae","Spiraeoideae","Rank_(botany)","Genus","Species","Infraspecific_name_(botany)","Plant","Marchantiophyta","Dicotyledon","Magnoliaceae","Liliidae","Liliaceae","Pinophyta","Conifers","Fagaceae","Beech","Birch","Infraspecific_name_(botany)","Scientific_name","Zoological_nomenclature","International_Code_of_Nomenclature_of_Bacteria","Virus_classification","Rank_(botany)","Infraspecific_name_(botany)","Subgenus","Section_(botany)","Subsection","Series_(botany)","Subseries","Species","Genus","Botanical_nomenclature","Hybrid_name","International_Code_of_Botanical_Nomenclature","International_Code_of_Nomenclature_for_Cultivated_Plants","International_Plant_Names_Index","International_Association_for_Plant_Taxonomy","Correct_name_(botany)","Author_citation_(botany)","Biological_classification","Binomial_nomenclature","Nomenclature_Codes","Taxonomy"]}
