{"cursor":"11022","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":":: See also [[RNA interference]]\n\n\n\n'Small interfering RNA' ('siRNA'), sometimes known as 'short interfering RNA' or\n'silencing RNA', is a class of double-stranded RNA molecules, 20-25 base pairs\nin length. siRNA plays many roles, but its most notable is in the RNA\ninterference (RNAi) pathway, where it interferes with the expression of specific\ngenes with complementary nucleotide sequence. siRNA also acts in RNAi-related\npathways, e.g., as an antiviral mechanism or in shaping the chromatin structure\nof a genome. The complexity of these pathways is only now being elucidated.\n\nsiRNAs and their role in post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) in plants\nwere first discovered by David Baulcombe's group at the Sainsbury Laboratory in\nNorwich, England and reported in [[Science (journal)|Science]] in\n1999. Thomas Tuschl and colleagues soon reported in [[Nature\n(journal)|Nature]] that synthetic siRNAs could induce RNAi in mammalian\ncells. This discovery led to a surge in interest in harnessing RNAi\nfor biomedical research and drug development.\n","linknr":348,"url":"Small_interfering_RNA","recorded":1362374341,"links":37,"instances":["genetics","genetics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["RNA","RNA interference","Molecular biology"],"headings":["Structure","RNAi induction using siRNAs or their biosynthetic precursors","RNA activation","Challenges: avoiding nonspecific effects","Possible therapeutic applications and challenges","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a9/SiRNAvitro.gif/300px-SiRNAvitro.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/SiRNA_Structure2.svg/308px-SiRNA_Structure2.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/2ffl-by-domain.png/220px-2ffl-by-domain.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["transcription","genetics"],["transcription","genetics"],["splicing","genetics"]],"members":["splicing","transcription"],"related":["Molecule","Base_pair","RNA_interference","Gene_expression","Chromatin","Genome","Transcription_(genetics)","Gene_silencing","David_Baulcombe","Sainsbury_Laboratory","Norwich,_England","England","Thomas_Tuschl","Biomedical_research","Drug_development","Base_pair","RNA","Phosphorylation","Hydroxylation","Dicer","Enzyme","DsRNA","Small_hairpin_RNA","Transfection","Gene_knockdown","Gene_knockdown","Transfection","Expression_vector","Transcription_(genetics)","Dicer","RNA_polymerase_III","Splicing_(genetics)","Ribonuclease","Dicer","RNAa","SaRNA","MicroRNA","Messenger_RNA","Transfection","Age-related_macular_degeneration","Oligonucleotide_synthesis","EsiRNA","NatsiRNA","MicroRNA","Viroid"]}
