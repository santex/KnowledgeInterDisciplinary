{"cursor":"3725","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Solaris' is a progressive rock band from Hungary. Established in 1980, the band\nwent through several formations. Their music has a strong melodic content, often\nlaced with Eastern European themes, and is highlighted by the use of dynamics\nand extended thematic development. There is a great deal of interplay among the\nlead instruments of flute, guitar and keyboard which is used regularly to\ndevelop their themes. The emphasis is not on providing solo spots for the\nvarious instruments, but rather in employing those instruments within the\ncontext of the development of the individual piece.\n\nThe band's name is a reference to the StanisÅaw Lem sci-fi novel, [[Solaris\n(novel)|Solaris]]. The first album's title is a reference to [[The Martian\nChronicles]]. The members have said that they were influenced by these - and\nother - sci-fi books.\n\nThe majority of Solaris' songs are instrumentals. The first track on their first\nLP, MarsbÃ©li KrÃ³nikÃ¡k, is an exception, with a few lines spoken over the music.\nThe pitch-shifting, distortion, and album's theme have led many listeners to\nassume that the voiceover is in a putative Martian language, but it's actually\nin Hungarian: \"Megrepedt tÃ¼krÃ¶k (Cracked mirrors) / Kormos acÃ©lfalak (Sooty\nsteel walls) / Halott szemÃ©thegyek (Dead piles of garbage) / Ãs szennyes tavak\n(And polluted lakes) / Azt mondod, itt Ã©lt valaha az ember? (Do you say mankind\nused to live here?)\". \"EgÃ©szsÃ©ges Optimizmus\" (Healthy Optimism) from the\nSOLARIS 1990 LP also has an introductory voiceover in Hungarian, and chanting in\nLatin appears in several tracks on the album Nostradamus: PrÃ³fÃ©ciÃ¡k kÃ¶nyve.\n\nIn June 2003, Attila KollÃ¡r said in an interview that the band is still alive,\nand they will start working on a new studio album that year.\n\nFollowing their regular albums (and a live double CD recorded in 1995 during the\nProgfest in Los Angeles), the band also started a 3-volume \"Official Bootleg\"\nseries. As the title says, these contain recordings that were never officially\nreleased before and consist of mainly live material. The title track of the\nsecond volume was originally intended to appear on the first album but has never\nbeen recorded in the studio.\n\nIn December 2007, drummer LÃ¡szlÃ³ GÃ¶mÃ¶r told Alternative Press magazine that\n\"the band has made few attempts to reunite and it seems unlikely (Solaris)\nwill reunite.\"\n","linknr":96,"url":"Solaris_(band)","recorded":1374861937,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Solaris_(band)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Solaris_(band)&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Progressive_rock","/wiki/Hungary","/wiki/Melodic","/wiki/Eastern_Europe","/wiki/Flute","/wiki/Guitar","/wiki/Keyboard_instrument","/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem","/wiki/Solaris_(novel)","/wiki/The_Martian_Chronicles","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability","#Members","#Past_members","#Discography","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Solaris_(band)&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Solaris_(band)&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=Solaris_(band)&action=edit&section=3","/w/index.php?title=Solaris_(band)&action=edit&section=4","http://www.solaris.hu/index_eng.htm","http://www.progreviews.com/reviews/list.php?show=solaris","http://www.e-prog.net/bands/solaris.htm","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Solaris_(band)&oldid=561100733","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Hungarian_progressive_rock_groups","/wiki/Category:Hungarian_rock_music_groups","/wiki/Category:Musical_groups_established_in_1980","/wiki/Category:All_pages_needing_factual_verification","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_needing_factual_verification_from_July_2007","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Solaris+%28band%29&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Solaris+%28band%29","/wiki/Solaris_(band)","/wiki/Talk:Solaris_(band)","#","/wiki/Solaris_(band)","/w/index.php?title=Solaris_(band)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Solaris_(band)&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Solaris_(band)","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Solaris_(band)","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Solaris_(band)&oldid=561100733","/w/index.php?title=Solaris_(band)&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q742726","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Solaris_%28band%29&id=561100733","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Solaris+%28band%29","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Solaris+%28band%29&oldid=561100733&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Solaris_(band)&printable=yes","//it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solaris_(gruppo_musicale)","//hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solaris_(egy%C3%BCttes)","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q742726#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solaris_(band)","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Hungarian
