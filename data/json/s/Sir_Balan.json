{"cursor":"2651","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Sir Balan le Savage', brother of Sir Balin from Northumberland, is a minor\ncharacter mentioned in various Arthurian legends. His story is retold, along\nwith his brother's, in The Ballad of Balin and Balan, Book II in Malory's Le\nMortÃ© d' Arthur and by Alfred, Lord Tennyson in [[Idylls of the King]].\n\nAfter Balin fought with Sir Lanceor of Ireland and killed him (in turn causing\nLanceor's lover Colombe to take her own life, which makes him destined to make\nthe Dolorous Stroke), he went on to find his brother Balan, who was also in\ndisfavour of King Arthur. Merlin foretold of a curse that was laid on the\nbrothers by a damsel after Balin drew a magical sword from the damsel's gilt\nand failed to return it, thereby laying a fatal curse \"on him and the man he\nloves most\".\n\nBalan, joined by his brother, decide to attack King Rience in order to regain\ntheir lost honour for King Arthur. The Brothers succeeded in ambushing Rience en\nroute to sleep with the Lady de Vance and brought the king before Arthur.\nRience's capture resulted in the forming of an alliance of twelve rebel kings,\nincluding King Rience's brother, King Nero. The kings, most notably Nero and\nLot, were captured or killed by Arthur with the help of Balin and Balan.\n\nAfter the battle, Balan comes across a cursed knight, guarding an island castle,\nwho challenges all knights who approach. Balan slays the cursed knight at the\ngate, whereby falling under the same curse that holds him to protect the castle\nfrom any passersby. Sir Balyn eventually comes across the castle, and is told\nthat he must joust with the guarding knight in order to continue his passage.\nNeither brother, however, recognises that his opponent is his brother: Balan\nbeing in disguising red armour with an unrecognisable shield; Balyn having been\npersuaded just before the battle to swap his own shield. The brothers end up\nfighting to the death, with Balan dying a few hours prior to Balin's own end.\n\nThe brothers were buried together on the island by Merlin, who also left the\ninfamous sword on the island later to be found by Galahad.\n\nIn T. H. White's [[The Sword in the Stone]], Balin and Balan are the names of\ntwo hawks that the Wart meets in the mews; Balan is helpful and kindly, while\nBalin is more eager to see the Wart have a hard time.\n","linknr":89,"url":"Sir_Balan","recorded":1375058608,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Sir_Balan&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Sir_Balan&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Sir_Balin","/wiki/Northumberland","/wiki/Arthurian_legend","/wiki/Malory","/wiki/Le_Morte_d%27Arthur","/wiki/Alfred_Tennyson,_1st_Baron_Tennyson","/wiki/Idylls_of_the_King","/wiki/Dolorous_Stroke","/wiki/King_Arthur","/wiki/Merlin_(wizard)","/wiki/Rience","/wiki/Merlin","/wiki/Galahad","/wiki/T._H._White","/wiki/The_Sword_in_the_Stone","/w/index.php?title=Sir_Balan&action=edit&section=1","http://www.arthurian-legend.com/summary-mort-darthur-02.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sir_Balan&oldid=542467997","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Arthurian_characters","/wiki/Category:Fictional_knights","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Sir+Balan&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Sir+Balan","/wiki/Sir_Balan","/wiki/Talk:Sir_Balan","#","/wiki/Sir_Balan","/w/index.php?title=Sir_Balan&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Sir_Balan&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Sir_Balan","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Sir_Balan","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Sir_Balan&oldid=542467997","/w/index.php?title=Sir_Balan&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1073810","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Sir_Balan&id=542467997","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Sir+Balan","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Sir+Balan&oldid=542467997&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Sir_Balan&printable=yes","//es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Balan","//eo.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balan_(mitologio)","//it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Balan","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1073810#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Balan","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":["wizard"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Arthurian characters|Balan","Fictional knights|Balan"],"headings":["External links"],"image":["//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["merlin","wizard"]],"members":["merlin"],"related":["Sir_Balin","Northumberland","Arthurian_legend","Malory","Le_Morte_d'Arthur","Alfred_Tennyson,_1st_Baron_Tennyson","Dolorous_Stroke","King_Arthur","Merlin_(wizard)","Rience","Merlin","Galahad","T._H._White"]}
