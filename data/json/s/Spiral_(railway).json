{"cursor":"14154","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n, on the Union Pacific Railroad, California, U.S.A., from the air.]]\n\nA 'spiral' (sometimes called a 'spiral loop' or just 'loop') is a technique\nemployed by railways to ascend steep hills.\n\nA railway spiral rises on a steady curve until it has completed a loop, passing\nover itself as it gains height, allowing the railway to gain vertical elevation\nin a relatively short horizontal distance. It is an alternative to a zig-zag,\nand avoids the need for the trains to stop and reverse direction while\nascending. If the train is of sufficient length, it is possible to view the\ntrain looping onto itself.\n\nA spiral loop should not be confused with the transition spiral or spiral\neasement used to provide a transition from a tangent into a horizontal circular\ncurve. Spiral easement is used to avoid abrupt changes in the sideward\nacceleration experienced by a railroad vehicle and the passengers in the vehicle\napproaching the horizontal circular curve and to prevent abrupt forces and\ndiscomfort. These curves are also used in highway engineering.\n\nA similar feature to railway spirals in road design is the pigtail bridge.\n","linknr":460,"url":"Spiral_(railway)","recorded":1362564919,"links":26,"instances":["france_line","tokyo","slope","railway","railway","rail","free_state","bulgaria","transportation"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Railway
