It replaced the S-IV second stage of the Saturn I with the much\nmore powerful S-IVB, able to launch a partially fueled Apollo Command/Service\nModule (CSM) or a fully fueled Lunar Module (LM) into low Earth orbit for early\nflight tests before the larger Saturn V needed for lunar flight was ready.\n\nBy sharing the S-IVB upper stage, the Saturn IB and Saturn V provided a common\ninterface to the Apollo spacecraft. The only major difference was that the S-IVB\non the Saturn V burned only part of its propellant to achieve earth orbit, so it\ncould be restarted for translunar injection. The S-IVB on the Saturn IB needed\nall of its propellant to achieve earth orbit.\n\nThe Saturn IB launched two unmanned CSM suborbital flights, one unmanned LM\norbital flight, and the first manned CSM orbital mission (first planned as\nApollo 1, later flown as Apollo 7). It also launched one orbital mission, AS-\n203, without a payload so the S-IVB would have residual liquid hydrogen fuel.\nThis mission supported the design of the restartable version of the S-IVB used\nin the Saturn V, by observing the behavior of the liquid hydrogen in\nweightlessness.\n\nIn 1973, the year after the Apollo lunar program ended, three Apollo CSM/Saturn\nIBs ferried crews to the Skylab space station. In 1975, one last Apollo/Saturn\nIB launched the Apollo portion of the joint US-USSR Apollo Soyuz Test Project. A\nbackup Apollo CSM/Saturn IB was assembled and made ready for a Skylab rescue\nmission but never flown.\n","linknr":657,"url":"Saturn_IB","recorded":1362267860,"links":51,"instances":["rocket_engine","les","rocket_engine","sla"],"pdf":["http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19750065090_1975065090.pdf","http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19750065090_1975065090.pdf","http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19740021163_1974021163.pdf","http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19710065502_1971065502.pdf"],"categories":["1966 in spaceflight","1968 in spaceflight","1973 in spaceflight","1975 in spaceflight","Apollo program","Saturn (rocket family)|IB"],"headings":["Specifications","S-IB stage","S-IVB-200 stage","Instrument Unit","Launch sequence events","Saturn IB vehicles and launches","Cost","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4f/Saturn_IB_launch_configurations.jpg/270px-Saturn_IB_launch_configurations.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/Saturn_IB_1st_stage.jpg/300px-Saturn_IB_1st_stage.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e4/Saturn_S-IB_SIV-B.jpg/300px-Saturn_S-IB_SIV-B.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/Saturn_V_IU.jpg/220px-Saturn_V_IU.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/82/ASTP_Saturn_IB.jpg/220px-ASTP_Saturn_IB.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0b/Saturn_IB_launches.jpg/500px-Saturn_IB_launches.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4b/Saturn_IB_at_KSC.jpg/220px-Saturn_IB_at_KSC.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/RocketSunIcon.svg/28px-RocketSunIcon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/Ksc-69pc-442.jpg/100px-Ksc-69pc-442.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["h-1","rocket_engine"],["j-2","rocket_engine"],["apollo_spacecraft#launch_escape_system","les"],["apollo_spacecraft#spacecraft_lunar_module_adapter","sla"],["h-1","rocket_engine"],["h-1","rocket_engine"],["j-2","rocket_engine"]],"members":[],"related":["AS-203","Apollo_5","United_States","Low_Earth_orbit","Launch_vehicle","Chrysler","S-IB","Douglas_Aircraft_Company","S-IVB","Cape_Canaveral_Air_Force_Station_Launch_Complex_37","Cape_Canaveral_Air_Force_Station_Launch_Complex_34","Cape_Canaveral_Air_Force_Station","Kennedy_Space_Center_Launch_Complex_39","Kennedy_Space_Center","Apollo_CSM","Apollo_LM","S-IB","H-1_(rocket_engine)","RP-1","LOX","S-IVB","Rocketdyne","J-2_(rocket_engine)","LH2","LOX","NASA","Apollo_program","S-IV","Saturn_I","S-IVB","Apollo_Command/Service_Module","Apollo_Lunar_Module","Low_Earth_orbit","Saturn_V","Translunar_injection","Apollo_1","Apollo_7","AS-203","Liquid_hydrogen","Weightlessness","Skylab","Union_of_Soviet_Socialist_Republics","Apollo_Soyuz_Test_Project","Apollo_Command/Service_Module","Apollo_Lunar_Module","Nose_cone","Chrysler","Michoud_Assembly_Facility","New_Orleans,_Louisiana","H-1_(rocket_engine)","RP-1","Liquid_oxygen","PGM-11_Redstone","PGM-19_Jupiter","Gimbal","H-1_(rocket_engine)","RP-1","Kerosene","Oxygen","LOX","Douglas_Aircraft_Company","Huntington_Beach,_California","Saturn_V","J-2_(rocket_engine)","Hydrogen","LH2","Oxygen","LOX","IBM","Orbital_state_vectors","Range_safety","Cape_Canaveral_Air_Force_Station_Launch_Complex_34","Cape_Canaveral_Air_Force_Station_Launch_Complex_37","Cape_Canaveral_Air_Force_Station","Skylab","Apollo-Soyuz_Test_Project","Kennedy_Space_Center_Launch_Complex_39","Mobile_Launcher_Platform","AS-201","AS-203","AS-202","Apollo_1","Apollo_5","Apollo_7","Skylab_2","Skylab_3","Skylab_Rescue","Skylab_4","Skylab_Rescue","Skylab_5","Space_Shuttle","Apollo_Soyuz_Test_Project","Skylab","Saturn_I","Kennedy_Space_Center_Visitor_Complex","S-IVB","I-65","U.S._Space_and_Rocket_Center","Huntsville,_Alabama","Comparison_of_orbital_launchers_families","Comparison_of_orbital_launch_systems"]}
