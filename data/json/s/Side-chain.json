{"cursor":"9218","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":":For other meanings see [[Substitution (disambiguation)|Substitution]]. In\norganic chemistry and biochemistry, a 'substituent' is an atom or group of atoms\nsubstituted in place of a hydrogen atom on the parent chain of a hydrocarbon.\nThe terms 'substituent', 'side-chain', 'group', 'branch', or '[[pendant group]]'\nare used almost interchangeably to describe branches from a parent\nstructure, though certain distinctions are made in the context of\npolymer chemistry. This distinguishes a pendant group as neither oligomeric\nnor polymeric, whereas a pendant chain must be oligomeric or polymeric. In\npolymers, side chains extend from a backbone structure. In proteins, side chains\nare attached to the alpha carbon atoms of the amino acid backbone.\n\nThe suffix 'yl' is used when naming organic compounds that contain a single bond\nreplacing one hydrogen; '-ylidene' and '-ylidyne' are used with double bonds and\ntriple bonds, respectively. In addition, when naming hydrocarbons that contain a\nsubstituent, positional numbers are used to indicate which carbon atom the\nsubstituent attaches to when such information is needed to distinguish between\nisomers. The polar effect exerted by a substituent is a combination of the\ninductive effect and the mesomeric effect. Additional steric effects result from\nthe volume occupied by a substituent.\n\nThe phrases 'most-substituted' and 'least-substituted' are frequently used to\ndescribe molecules and predict their products. For example:\n\n*  Markovnikov's rule predicts that the hydrogen adds to the carbon of the\n   alkene functional group that has the greater number of hydrogen substituents.\n*  Zaitsev's rule predicts that the major reaction product is the alkene with\n   the more highly substituted (more stable) double bond.\n","linknr":246,"url":"Side-chain","recorded":1362560321,"links":28,"instances":["chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Organic chemistry","Chemical nomenclature","Substituents|*"],"headings":["Nomenclature","Methane substituents","Structures","Statistical distribution","See also","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["radical","chemistry"]],"members":["radical"],"related":["Organic_chemistry","Biochemistry","Atom","Hydrogen","Parent_chain","Hydrocarbon","Polymer","Polymers","Protein","Alpha_carbon","Amino_acid","Organic_compound","Single_bond","Double_bond","Triple_bond","Isomer","Polar_effect","Inductive_effect","Mesomeric_effect","Steric_effects","Markovnikov's_rule","Zaitsev's_rule","Affix","Organic_chemistry","Radical_(chemistry)","Greek_language","Methyl_group","Parent_compound","IUPAC","Double_bond","Triple_bond","PubChem","Alkane","Hydride","Carboxylic_acid","Alcohol","Triple_bond","Vinyl","Polyvinyl","Methane","Methyl_group","Methylene_group","Methylene_bridge","Methylidyne_group","Methine_group","Methanetriyl_group","Methylylidyne_group","Methanediylidene_group","Methanediylylidene_group","Methanetetrayl_group","Structural_formula","Methyl","Ethyl_group","Aryl","Charles_Frédéric_Gerhardt","Halides","Cheminformatics","Phenyl","Chlorine","Methoxy","Hydroxyl","Ethyl_group","Functional_group"]}
