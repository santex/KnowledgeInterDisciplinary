Its concept was born out of a response\nof a lawsuit by an African American resident, Charles J. Hatfield, III, seeking\nto attend law school at a state institution. On December 16, 1946, Louisiana\nState Board of Education took steps to establish a Law School for blacks at\nSouthern University to be in operation for the 1947-1948 session. The University\nis a member-school of Thurgood Marshall College Fund.\n\nThere are full-time, part-time, and evening programs. For students who want to\npursue the JD and MPA, the school offers a joint-degree program in cooperation\nwith the Nelson Mandela School of Public Policy and Urban Affairs. There's also\na study-abroad program in London, in which students take courses with\ninternational subject matter. SULC also publishes two legal journals: its\ntraditional Law Review as well as The Journal of Race, Gender and Poverty.\nSULC's students also learn two different systems of law: Louisiana is a civil\nlaw jurisdiction (in the tradition of France and Continental Europe), while law\nin every other state is based on the common law tradition.\n","linknr":427,"url":"Southern_University_Law_Center","recorded":1362582674,"links":25,"instances":["louisiana_politician","louisiana_politician"],"pdf":["https://officialguide.lsac.org/Release/SchoolsABAData/SchoolPage/SchoolPage_PDFs/ABA_LawSchoolData/ABA6663.pdf","https://officialguide.lsac.org/Release/SchoolsABAData/SchoolPage/SchoolPage_PDFs/ABA_LawSchoolData/ABA6663.pdf","https://officialguide.lsac.org/Release/SchoolsABAData/SchoolPage/SchoolPage_PDFs/ABA_LawSchoolData/ABA6663.pdf","https://officialguide.lsac.org/Release/SchoolsABAData/SchoolPage/SchoolPage_PDFs/ABA_LawSchoolData/ABA6663.pdf","http://www.lasc.org/press_room/bar_results/results/July2011/711_SCHOOL.pdf","http://www.lasc.org/press_room/bar_results/results/July2011/711_SCHOOL.pdf"],"categories":["Educational institutions established in 1947","Law schools in Louisiana","Universities and colleges accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools","Southern University","Universities and colleges in Baton Rouge, Louisiana"],"headings":["History","Accreditation","Clinical program","Physical plant","Other accomplishments","Notable alumni","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/89/Sulclogo.JPG/220px-Sulclogo.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["taylor_townsend","louisiana_politician"],["jonathan_perry","louisiana_politician"]],"members":["jonathan_perry","taylor_townsend"],"related":["Public_university","Baton_Rouge,_Louisiana","Louisiana","United_States","Southern_University_System","African_American","Thurgood_Marshall_College_Fund","American_Bar_Association","Jesse_N._Stone","Sherman_Q._Mack","Japan","Gaiben","Cleo_Fields","Walmart","Taylor_Townsend_(Louisiana_politician)","Jody_Amedee","Robert_M._Marionneaux","Jonathan_Perry_(Louisiana_politician)","Vermilion_Parish,_Louisiana","Cameron_Parish,_Louisiana","Murphy_J._Foster,_Jr.","Governor_of_Louisiana","Faith_Jenkins","Miss_Louisiana","Miss_America_2001"]}
