The outward effect can be as dramatic as a\nwild thrashing movement (tonic-clonic seizure) or as mild as a brief loss of\nawareness (absence seizure). It can manifest as an alteration in , tonic or\nclonic movements, convulsions, and various other psychic symptoms (such as dÃ©jÃ \nvu or jamais vu). Sometimes it is not accompanied by convulsions but a full body\n\"slump\", where the person simply will lose body control and slump to the ground.\nThe medical syndrome of recurrent, unprovoked seizures is termed epilepsy, but\nseizures can occur in people who do not have epilepsy. For more information, see\nnon-epileptic seizure.\n\nAbout 4% of people will have an unprovoked seizure by the age of 80 and the\nchance of experiencing a second seizure is between 30% and 50%. Treatment may reduce the chance of a second one by as much as\nhalf. Most single episode seizures are managed by primary care\nphysicians (emergency or general practitioners), whereas investigation and\nmanagement of ongoing epilepsy is usually done by neurologists. Difficult-to-\nmanage epilepsy may require consultation with an epileptologist, a neurologist\nwith an interest in epilepsy.\n","linknr":567,"url":"Seizure","recorded":1362511108,"links":32,"instances":["tests","symptom","medical","tests","physiology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Epilepsy|*","Symptoms and signs"],"headings":["Classification","Signs and symptoms","Causes","Diagnosis","Management","Prognosis","Epidemiology","History","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/26/Spike-waves.png/230px-Spike-waves.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4e/Bittentongue.JPG/220px-Bittentongue.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["tonic","physiology"],["aura","symptom"],["hypoxia","medical"],["sensitivity","tests"],["specificity","tests"],["sensitivity","tests"]],"members":["sensitivity","aura","hypoxia","specificity","tonic"],"related":["Neural_oscillation","Tonic_(physiology)","Clonic","Convulsion","Déjà_vu","Jamais_vu","Epilepsy","Non-epileptic_seizure","Epileptologist","Simple_partial_seizures","Complex_partial_seizures","Absence_seizure","Myoclonus","Clonic_seizure","Tonic–clonic_seizure","Atonic_seizure","Memory","Epigastric","Status_epilepticus","Motoneuron","Sensory_neuron","Autonomic_nervous_system","Emotion","Cognitive","Postictal","Level_of_consciousness","Vertiginous_epilepsy","Tonic–clonic_seizure","Aura_(symptom)","Focal_seizure","Complex_partial_seizure","Absence_seizure","Seizure_disorder","Dehydration","Sleep_deprivation","Cavernoma","Cavernous_malformation","Arteriovenous_malformation","Traumatic_brain_injury","Post-traumatic_seizures","Post-traumatic_epilepsy","Drug_overdose","Aminophylline","Local_anaesthetics","Tricyclic_antidepressant","Infection","Encephalitis","Meningitis","Fever","Febrile_convulsions","Metabolism","Hypoglycaemia","Hyponatremia","Hypoxia_(medical)","Withdrawal","Anticonvulsant","Antidepressant","Sedative","Ethanol","Barbiturates","Benzodiazepines","Abscess","Tumor","Eclampsia","Hydrocephalus","Shunt","Stroke","Embolism","Cerebral_venous_sinus_thrombosis","Multiple_sclerosis","Electroconvulsive_therapy","EEG","Psychogenic_non-epileptic_seizure","Epilepsy","Blood_tests","Lumbar_puncture","Drug_screen","Meningitis","Drug_overdose","Electroencephalogram","CT_scan","MRI_scan","Postictal_state","Sensitivity_(tests)","Specificity_(tests)","Meta-analysis","Prolactin","Sensitivity_(tests)","Electroencephalography","Subclinical_seizure","CT_Scan","MRI","Angiography","Differential_diagnosis","Glucose","Hypoglycemia","Fainting","Cardiac_arrhythmia","Panic_attack","Cataplexy","Tilt_table_test","Cerebral_hypoxia","Non-epileptic_seizures","Fainting","Decerebrate_posturing","Dystonia","Migraine_headache","Recovery_position","Voluntary_caregiver","Lorazepam","Barbiturate","Propofol","Seizure_response_dog","Status_epilepticus","Hippocrates","Migralepsy","Phantosmia"]}
