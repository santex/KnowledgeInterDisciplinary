{"cursor":"17676","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"{{multiple issues|\n\n\n}}\n\n'Statistical significance' refers to two separate notions:\n* the ''p''-value, the probability that the observed data would occur by chance\n  in a given single null hypothesis (Ronald Fisher); or\n* the Type I error rate Î± (false positive rate) of a statistical hypothesis\n  test, the probability of incorrectly rejecting a given null hypothesis in\n  favor of a second alternative hypothesis (Jerzy Neyman and Egon Pearson). A\n  fixed number, most often 0.05, is referred to as a 'significance level' or\n  'level of significance'; such a number may be used either in the first sense,\n  as a cutoff mark for p-values (each p-value is calculated from the data), or\n  in the second sense as a desired parameter in the test design (Î± depends only\n  on the test design, and is not calculated from observed data).\n\nThese two notions reflect distinct aspects of statistical analysis and measure\ndifferent quantities which cannot be compared. However, they are often\nconflated. In the first approach p is often compared to 0.05 ( p \\leq\n0.05 is checked), and in the second approach Î± is often set to 0.05\n( \\alpha = 0.05 ), so combining these equations yields \" p \\leq\n\\alpha \", which is not a meaningful comparison. Due to this confusion, the\nnotation Î± is sometimes used for a cutoff value of p even when the\nNeymanâPearson approach is not being used. In this article, \"statistical\nsignificance\" is used in the sense of p-value (Fisher), and to avoid confusion,\nÎ± will not be used.
