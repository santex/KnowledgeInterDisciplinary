{"cursor":"3498","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Structural biology' is a branch of molecular biology, biochemistry, and\nbiophysics concerned with the molecular structure of biological macromolecules,\nespecially proteins and nucleic acids, how they acquire the structures they\nhave, and how alterations in their structures affect their function. This\nsubject is of great interest to biologists because macromolecules carry out most\nof the functions of cells, and because it is only by coiling into specific three-\ndimensional shapes that they are able to perform these functions. This\narchitecture, the \"tertiary structure\" of molecules, depends in a complicated\nway on the molecules' basic composition, or \"primary structures.\"\n\n, the oxygen transporting protein found in red blood cells]]\n\nBiomolecules are too small to see in detail even with the most advanced light\nmicroscopes. The methods that structural biologists use to determine their\nstructures generally involve measurements on vast numbers of identical molecules\nat the same time. These methods include: *Macromolecular crystallography,\n*Proteolysis *NMR, *EPR, *Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) *Multiangle light\nscattering, *Small angle scattering, *Ultra fast laser spectroscopy, and *Dual\nPolarisation Interferometry and circular dichroism. Most often researchers use\nthem to study the \"native states\" of macromolecules. But variations on these\nmethods are also used to watch nascent or denatured molecules assume or reassume\ntheir native states. See protein folding.\n\nA third approach that structural biologists take to understanding structure is\nbioinformatics to look for patterns among the diverse sequences that give rise\nto particular shapes. Researchers often can deduce aspects of the structure of\nintegral membrane proteins based on the membrane topology predicted by\nhydrophobicity analysis. See protein structure prediction.\n\nIn the past few years it has become possible for highly accurate physical\nmolecular models to complement the in silico study of biological structures.\n","linknr":147,"url":"Structural_biology","recorded":1362509737,"links":29,"instances":["electron_density","biochemistry","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Molecular biology","Protein structure","Biophysics","Structural biology|"],"headings":["See also","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/ba/Hemoglobin_t-r_state_ani.gif/220px-Hemoglobin_t-r_state_ani.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/Wikiversity-logo.svg/40px-Wikiversity-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cell","biology"],["denaturation","biochemistry"],["resolution","electron_density"]],"members":["resolution","denaturation","cell"],"related":["Molecular_biology","Biochemistry","Biophysics","Macromolecule","Protein","Nucleic_acid","Cell_(biology)","Tertiary_structure","Primary_structure","Biomolecule","Microscope","Proteolysis","Protein_NMR","Electron_paramagnetic_resonance","Cryo-electron_microscopy","Multiangle_light_scattering","Biological_small-angle_scattering","Ultra_fast_laser_spectroscopy","Dual_Polarisation_Interferometry","Circular_dichroism","Native_state","Denaturation_(biochemistry)","Protein_folding","Bioinformatics","DNA_sequence","Integral_membrane_protein","Membrane_topology","Hydrophobicity_analysis","Protein_structure_prediction","Molecular_model","Primary_structure","Secondary_structure","Tertiary_structure","Quaternary_structure","Structural_domain","Structural_motif","Protein_subunit","Molecular_model","Cooperativity","Chaperonin","Structural_genomics","Stereochemistry","Resolution_(electron_density)","Proteopedia"]}
