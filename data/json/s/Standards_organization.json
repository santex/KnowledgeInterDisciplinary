{"cursor":"18915","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nA 'standards organization', 'standards body', 'standards developing\norganization' ('SDO'), or 'standards setting organization' ('SSO') is any\norganization whose primary activities are developing, coordinating,\npromulgating, revising, amending, reissuing, interpreting, or otherwise\nproducing technical standards that are intended to address the needs of some\nrelatively wide base of affected adopters.\n\nMost standards are voluntary in the sense that they are offered for adoption by\npeople or industry without being mandated in law. Some standards become\nmandatory when they are adopted by regulators as legal requirements in\nparticular domains.\n\nThe term formal standard refers specifically to a specification that has been\napproved by a standards setting organization. The term [[de jure]] standard\nrefers to a standard mandated by legal requirements or refers generally to any\nformal standard. In contrast, the term [[de facto standard]] refers to a\nspecification (or protocol or technology) that has achieved widespread use and\nacceptance â often without being approved by any standards organization (or\nreceiving such approval only after it already has achieved widespread use).\nExamples of de facto standards that were not approved by any standards\norganizations (or at least not approved until after they were in widespread de\nfacto use) include the Hayes command set developed by Hayes, Apple's TrueType\nfont design and the PCL protocol used by Hewlett-Packard in the computer\nprinters they produced.\n\nNormally, the term standards organization is not used to refer to the individual\nparties participating within the standards developing organization in the\ncapacity of founders, benefactors, stakeholders, members or contributors, who\nthemselves may function as the standards organizations.\n","linknr":225,"url":"Standards_organization","recorded":1362480324,"links":22,"instances":["law"],"pdf":["http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/standards_policy/vademecum/doc/98_34_ec_consolidated_version.pdf"],"categories":["Standards organizations|"],"headings":["Overview","Trends","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["benefactor","law"],["501(c(3"]],"members":["benefactor"],"related":["Technical_standard","Hayes_command_set","Hayes_Microcomputer_Products","Apple_Computer","TrueType","Printer_Command_Language","Hewlett-Packard","Computer_printer","Benefactor_(law)","Project_stakeholder","National_standards","International_standards","International_Organization_for_Standardization","International_Electrotechnical_Commission","International_Telecommunication_Union","Geneva","Switzerland","World_Standards_Cooperation","United_Nations","Codex_Alimentarius","ASME","ASTM_International","IEEE","Internet_Engineering_Task_Force","SAE_International","TAPPI","World_Wide_Web_Consortium","Universal_Postal_Union","European_Committee_for_Standardization","European_Committee_for_Electrotechnical_Standardization","European_Telecommunications_Standards_Institute","Institute_for_Reference_Materials_and_Measurements","Pacific_Area_Standards_Congress","Pan_American_Standards_Commission","African_Organization_for_Standardization","Arabic_industrial_development_and_mining_organization","MERCOSUR","CARICOM_Regional_Organisation_for_Standards_and_Quality","Www.eac-quality.net","Bureau_of_Indian_Standards","India","Brazilian_National_Standards_Organization","Asociación_Española_de_Normalización_y_Certificación","AFNOR","American_National_Standards_Institute","British_Standards_Institution","Dirección_General_de_Normas","Deutsches_Institut_für_Normung","Instituto_Argentino_de_Normalización_y_Certificación","Bureau_of_Standards_of_Jamaica","ICONTEC","Japanese_Industrial_Standards_Committee","Korean_Agency_for_Technology_and_Standards","Nederlandse_Norm","South_African_Bureau_of_Standards","Standardization_Administration_of_China","Standards_Council_of_Canada","Swedish_Standards_Institute","Finnish_Standards_Association","Standards_Norway","Swiss_Association_for_Standardization","Standards_New_Zealand","Ente_Nazionale_Italiano_di_Unificazione","Crown_Corporation","501(c)(3)","National_Institute_of_Standards_and_Technology","Memorandum_of_understanding","International_Organization_for_Standardization","IEEE","Audio_Engineering_Society","Interface_standard","Safety_standards","ISO_9000","False_advertising","International_Telecommunication_Union","Public_domain","Central_government","Copyright","Intellectual_property","Publication","Copyright","Treaties","Standardization","World_Wide_Web_Consortium","HTML","Cascading_Style_Sheets","XML","Internet_Engineering_Task_Force","OpenOffice.org","Apache_Software_Foundation","Open_standard","Microsoft_Office","DVD","International_standard","Coordination_game","List_of_technical_standard_organisations","Technical_standard","Transport_standards_organisations","Fair,_reasonable,_and_non-discriminatory_terms","Autocracy"]}
