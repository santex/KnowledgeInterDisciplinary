{"cursor":"13528","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Scientific consensus' is the collective judgment, position, and opinion of the\ncommunity of scientists in a particular field of study. Consensus implies\ngeneral agreement, though not necessarily unanimity. Scientific consensus is not\nby itself a scientific argument, and it is not part of the scientific method.\nNevertheless, consensus may be based on both scientific arguments and the\nscientific method.\n\nConsensus is normally achieved through communication at conferences, the\npublication process, replication (reproducible results by others) and peer\nreview. These lead to a situation in which those within the discipline can often\nrecognize such a consensus where it exists, but communicating to outsiders that\nconsensus has been reached can be difficult, because the 'normal' debates\nthrough which science progresses may seem to outsiders as contestation. On occasion, scientific institutes issue\nposition statements intended to communicate a summary of the science from the\n\"inside\" to the \"outside\" of the scientific community. In cases where there is\nlittle controversy regarding the subject under study, establishing what the\nconsensus is can be quite straightforward.\n\nScientific consensus may be invoked in popular or political debate on subjects\nthat are controversial within the public sphere but which may not be\ncontroversial within the scientific community, such as\nevolution or the claimed linkage of MMR vaccinations and\nautism.\n","linknr":209,"url":"Scientific_consensus","recorded":1362483073,"links":29,"instances":["medical"],"pdf":["http://www.aaas.org/news/releases/2006/pdf/0219boardstatement.pdf","http://www.aaas.org/news/releases/2006/pdf/0219boardstatement.pdf","http://dels-old.nas.edu/dels/rpt_briefs/climate_change_2008_final.pdf","http://dels-old.nas.edu/dels/rpt_briefs/climate_change_2008_final.pdf","http://www.antievolution.org/features/wedge.pdf"],"categories":["Heuristics","Scientific method"],"headings":["How consensus can change over time","Politicization of science","See also","Notes"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["consensus","medical"]],"members":["consensus"],"related":["Opinion","Scientific_community","Scientist","Scientific_discipline","Unanimity","Scientific_method","Consensus","Peer_review","Evolution","MMR_vaccine_controversy","Experiment","Karl_Popper","Falsifiability","Thomas_Kuhn","Paradigm","Paradigm_shift","Paul_Feyerabend","Scientific_opinion_on_climate_change","History_of_science_and_technology","Naomi_Oreskes","Anthropogenic_global_warming","Evolution","New_England_Journal_of_Medicine","Wedge_strategy","Theistic_evolution","Falsifiability","Appeal_to_authority","Consensus_(medical)","Consensus_reality","Mertonian_norms","Empiricism","Paradigm"]}
