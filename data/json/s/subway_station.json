It is often underground or\n elevated. At crossings of metro lines, they are multi-level.\n\nAt street level the logo of the metro company marks the entrance of the station,\nalong with the schematics of the services at the station. Often there are\nseveral entrances for one station, saving one from having to cross the street.\nIn such a case, tunnels or overhead stations can often also be used just to\ncross the street.\n\nIn some cases metro stations are connected to important buildings by a direct\nenclosed hallway (see underground city).\n\nSome metro systems, such as those of Naples, Stockholm, Moscow, St. Petersburg,\nTashkent, Kiev,<ref name=\"mb art\"></ref> Montreal, Kaohsiung and Prague are\nfamous for the beautiful architecture and public art. The Paris Métro is famous\nfor its [[art nouveau]] station entrances; while the Athens Metro is known for\nits display of archeological relics found during construction.\n\nMetro stations, more so than railway and bus stations, often have a\ncharacteristic artistic design that can identify each stop. Some have sculptures\nor frescoes. For example, London's Baker Street station is adorned with tiles\ndepicting Sherlock Holmes. The tunnel for Paris' Concorde station is decorated\nwith tiles spelling the Déclaration des Droits de l'Homme et du Citoyen. Every\nmetro station in Valencia, Spain has a different sculpture on the ticket-hall\nlevel. Alameda station is decorated with fragments of white tile, like the\ndominant style of the [[Ciutat de les Arts i les Ciències]]. On the Tyne and\nWear Metro, the station at Newcastle United's home ground St James' Park is\ndecorated in the clubs famous black and white stripes.\n\nEach station of the Red Line and Purple Line subway in Los Angeles was built\nwith different artwork and decorating schemes, such as murals, tile artwork and\nsculptural benches. This is not always the case, however, Sir Norman Foster's\nnew system in Bilbao, Spain uses the same modern architecture at every station\nto make navigation easier for the passenger, though some may argue that this is\nat the expense of character.\n\nIn some stations, especially where trains are fully automated, the entire\nplatform is screened from the track by a wall, typically of glass, with\nautomatic platform-edge doors (PEDs). These open, like elevator doors, only when\na train is stopped, and thus eliminate the hazard that a passenger will\naccidentally fall (or deliberately jump) onto the tracks and be run over or\nelectrocuted.\n\nControl over ventilation of the platform is also improved, allowing it to be\nheated or cooled without having to do the same for the tunnels. The doors add\ncost and complexity to the system, and trains may have to approach the station\nmore slowly so they can stop in accurate alignment with them.\n\nThe largest and most complex metro station in the world is the Paris Métro-RER\nstation Châtelet-Les Halles in\nFrance.<ref>http://www.ratp.fr/common/ressources/concertation_p1.pdf</ref>\n\nThe metro station with the highest elevation above-ground in the world is New\nYork City's Smith–Ninth Streets station of the New York City Subway in the\nUnited States.<ref>http://www.mta.info/news/stories/?story=177</ref>\n",
