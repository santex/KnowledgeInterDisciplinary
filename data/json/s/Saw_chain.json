{"cursor":"9388","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nThe 'saw chain', or \"cutting chain\", is a key component of a chainsaw. It\nconsists of steel links held together by rivets, and superficially resembles the\nbicycle-style roller chain, although it is closer in design to a leaf chain. Its\nkey differences are sharp cutting teeth on the outside of the chain loop, and\nflat drive links on the inside, to retain the chain on the saw's bar and allow\npropulsion by the engine or motor.\n\nSaw chains (and chainsaws generally) are used for cutting wood. This may be\nfor harvesting trees for pulp or timber, for tree surgery, or for\nprocessing firewood.\n\nWhether for hand-held chainsaws, mechanical timber harvesters or chain\nmortisers, the saw chain has undergone dramatic development since its invention.\nModern chains designed for high power, high-speed sawing applications will\nvastly outperform older designs, while allowing a far greater degree of safety\nand reliability in use.\n","linknr":149,"url":"Saw_chain","recorded":1362476867,"links":20,"instances":["forestry"],"pdf":["http://www.oregonchain.co.uk/pdfs/MaintManual_English.pdf"],"categories":["Chainsaws","Logging","Saws"],"headings":["Principles of saw chain operation","Early saw chain designs","Modern tooth designs","Chain arrangements","Chain specifications and dimensioning","Specialised chains","Joining chain","See also","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/3b/Scratcher-1.JPG/220px-Scratcher-1.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4c/Scratcher-2.JPG/220px-Scratcher-2.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c2/Oregon10.JPG/220px-Oregon10.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8b/Chainsaw_depth_gauge.jpg/220px-Chainsaw_depth_gauge.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["harvester","forestry"]],"members":["harvester"],"related":["Chainsaw","Rivet","Bicycle","Roller_chain","Tree_surgery","Harvester_(forestry)","Chain_mortiser","Motor","Joseph_Buford_Cox","Forestry","Tree_surgery","Firewood","Chisel","Softwood","Hardwood","Steel","Tungsten_carbide","Chainsaw_mill","Bicycle_chain","Joseph_Buford_Cox","Chainsaw_safety_features","Chainsaw_safety_clothing","Stihl"]}
