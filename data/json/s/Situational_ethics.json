{"cursor":"16270","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Situational ethics,' or 'situation ethics,' is a Christian ethical theory that\nwas principally developed in the 1960s by the then Episcopal priest Joseph\nFletcher. It basically states that sometimes other moral principles can be cast\naside in certain situations if love is best served; as Paul Tillich once put it:\n\"Love is the ultimate law.\" The moral principles Fletcher is specifically\nreferring to are the moral codes of Christianity and the type of love he is\nspecifically referring to is 'Î±Î³Î±ÏÎ·' love. AgapÄ is a Greek term meaning love\n(sometimes translated as unconditional love). Fletcher believed that in forming\nan ethical system based on love, he was best expressing the notion of \"love thy\nneighbor,\" which Jesus Christ taught in the Gospels of the New Testament of the\nBible. Through situational ethics, Fletcher attempted to find a \"middle road\"\nbetween legalistic and antinomian ethics. Fletcher developed situational ethics\nin his books: The Classic Treatment and Situation Ethics.\n\nFletcher believed that there are no absolute laws other than the law of AgapÄ\nlove and all the other laws were laid down in order to achieve the greatest\namount of this love. This means that all the other laws are only guidelines to\nhow to achieve this love, and thus they may be broken if the other course of\naction would result in more love.\n\nSituational ethics is a teleological, or consequential theory, in that it is\nconcerned with the outcome or consequences of an action; the end. In the case of\nsituational ethics, the ends can justify the means or rules can be used to\njustify the means if a situation is not intrinsically bad. Whether you believe\nin the Bible or Church there is always right and wrong consequences. He to\nbelieved you should base moral decisions upon the commandment to love your\nneighbor. Relating to freewill he also claimed you should follow the bible and\nchurch guidance's depending whether it is the most loving thing to do.\n","linknr":470,"url":"Situational_ethics","recorded":1362684332,"links":16,"instances":["ethics","theology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Ethical schools and movements","Religious ethics","Philosophical movements","Political theories","Relational ethics","Christian terms"],"headings":["Ethical classification","Fletcher's four examples","Situational ethics outlined","Biblical links","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["legalism","theology"],["intrinsic_value","ethics"]],"members":["intrinsic_value","legalism"],"related":["Christian_Ethics","Joseph_Fletcher","Paul_Tillich","Moral_codes","Agapē","Jesus_Christ","Gospels","New_Testament","Legalism_(theology)","Antinomian","Teleology","Consequentialism","Consequentialism","Utilitarianism","Utilitarianism","Proportionalism","Joseph_Fletcher","Joseph_Fletcher","Agape","Intrinsic_value_(ethics)","Greek_words_for_love","Greek_words_for_love","Greek_words_for_love","Justice","Justice","Greek_words_for_love","Joseph_Fletcher","Justice","Greek_words_for_love","Duties","Obligations","Factors_of_production","Justice","Greek_words_for_love","Greek_words_for_love","The_ends_justify_the_means","Greek_words_for_love","Joseph_Fletcher","Biblical","Bible","New_International_Version","Biblical","Torah","Old_testament","Earth","Pharisees","Torah","Rabbi","Ten_commandments","Torah","Ten_commandments","Ten_commandments","Torah","Old_Testament","Ten_commandments","Rabbi","Torah","Ten_commandments","Ten_commandments","Ten_commandments","Ten_commandments","Rabbi","Kingdom_of_God","Pharisee","Dropsy","Pharisees","Torah","Ox","Biblical_law_in_Christianity","Biblical_Sabbath","Joseph_Fletcher","Graded_absolutism","Moral_relativism","Prima_facie_right"]}
