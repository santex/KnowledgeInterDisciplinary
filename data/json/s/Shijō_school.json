{"cursor":"3753","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":". One of two sixfold screens.]]\n\nThe , also known as the Maruyama-ShijÅ school, was an offshoot school of the\nMaruyama school of Japanese painting founded by Maruyama Åkyo, and his former\nstudent Matsumura Goshun in the late 18th century. This school was one of\nseveral that made up the larger Kyoto school. The school is named after the\nstreet in Kyoto where many major artists were based; ShijÅ literally translates\nto \"fourth avenue.\" Its primary patrons were rich merchants in and around\nKyoto/Osaka and also appealed to the 'kamigata' who were of the established\naristocrat and artisan families of the Imperial capital during the late\n18th/19th centuries.\n\nStylistically, the ShijÅ style can best be described as a synthesis of two rival\nstyles of the time. Maruyama Åkyo was an experienced and expert painter of [[sumi-\ne]] ink paintings, and accomplished a great degree of realism in his creations,\nemphasizing direct observation of depicted subjects which was a direct\ncontravention of the officially sponsored schools of the time, KanÅ and Tosa,\nwhich emphasized decorativeness with highly formalized and stylized figures\ntaught to its students via copying paintings of past masters. The KanÅ and Tosa\nschools had become bywords for rigid formalism by this time. Meanwhile, a number\nof artists, rebelling against Åkyo's realism, formed the [[Nanga (art)|nanga]]\n(southern pictures) school, basing their style largely on the Southern school of\nChinese painting. The artists of the ShijÅ school sought to reconcile the\ndifferences between these two styles, creating works that synthesized the best\nelements of both.\n\nThe school's style focuses on a Western-influenced objective realism, but\nachieved with traditional Japanese painting techniques. It concentrates less on\nthe exact depiction of its subject, but rather on expressing the 'inner spirit'\nand usually has an element of playfulness and humor compared to the Maruyama\nschool. Popular motifs include tranquil landscapes, kachÅ (bird and flower),\nanimals, and traditional subjects from Chinese poetic and Confucian lore, but\nthere is generally little or no interest in legends, history, or classical\nliterature.

Shibata Zeshin is also closely\nassociated with the ShijÅ school, though he worked in many other styles and\nmediums, most notably lacquer objects and lacquer painting.\n","linknr":123,"url":"Shijō_school","recorded":1375074408,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Shij%C5%8D_school&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Shij%C5%8D_school&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Okyo_Pine,_Bamboo,_Plum.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1d/Okyo_Pine%2C_Bamboo%2C_Plum.jpg/300px-Okyo_Pine%2C_Bamboo%2C_Plum.jpg","/wiki/File:Okyo_Pine,_Bamboo,_Plum.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Maruyama_%C5%8Ckyo","/wiki/Help:Installing_Japanese_character_sets","/wiki/Maruyama_school","/wiki/Japanese_painting","/wiki/Maruyama_%C5%8Ckyo","/wiki/Matsumura_Goshun","/wiki/Kyoto_school_(art)","/wiki/Kyoto","/wiki/Maruyama_%C5%8Ckyo","/wiki/Sumi-e","/wiki/Kan%C5%8D_school","/wiki/Tosa_school","/wiki/Kan%C5%8D_school","/wiki/Tosa_school","/wiki/Nanga_(art)","/wiki/Southern_school","/wiki/Chinese_painting","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Mori_Sosen","/wiki/Shibata_Zeshin","/w/index.php?title=Shij%C5%8D_school&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Matsumura_Goshun","/wiki/Edo_period#cite_ref-BMA_12-0","/wiki/Maruyama_%C5%8Ckyo","/wiki/Mori_Sosen","/wiki/Kikuchi_Y%C5%8Dsai","/w/index.php?title=Ohara_Shoson_(Koson)&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Shibata_Zeshin","/w/index.php?title=Shij%C5%8D_school&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-1","/wiki/File:Nuvola_apps_package_graphics.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/22/Nuvola_apps_package_graphics.png/30px-Nuvola_apps_package_graphics.png","/wiki/Art_movement","/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shij%C5%8D_school&action=edit","/wiki/Template:Art-movement-stub","/w/index.php?title=Template_talk:Art-movement-stub&action=edit&redlink=1","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Art-movement-stub&action=edit","/wiki/File:Art-stub.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/94/Art-stub.jpg/30px-Art-stub.jpg","/wiki/Art_history","/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shij%C5%8D_school&action=edit","/wiki/Template:Art-hist-stub","/w/index.php?title=Template_talk:Art-hist-stub&action=edit&redlink=1","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Art-hist-stub&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shijō_school&oldid=547636256","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Schools_of_Japanese_art","/wiki/Category:Art_movement_stubs","/wiki/Category:Art_history_stubs","/wiki/Category:Articles_containing_Japanese-language_text","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Shij%C5%8D+school&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Shij%C5%8D+school","/wiki/Shij%C5%8D_school","/wiki/Talk:Shij%C5%8D_school","#","/wiki/Shij%C5%8D_school","/w/index.php?title=Shij%C5%8D_school&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Shij%C5%8D_school&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Shij%C5%8D_school","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Shij%C5%8D_school","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Shij%C5%8D_school&oldid=547636256","/w/index.php?title=Shij%C5%8D_school&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3577704","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Shij%C5%8D_school&id=547636256","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Shij%C5%8D+school","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Shij%C5%8D+school&oldid=547636256&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Shij%C5%8D_school&printable=yes","//es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escuela_Maruyama-Shij%C5%8D","//fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89cole_Shij%C5%8D","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3577704#sitelinks-wikipedia","/
