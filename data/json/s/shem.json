He is most popularly regarded as the eldest\nson, though some traditions regard him as the second son. Genesis 10:21 refers\nto relative ages of Shem and his brother Japheth, but with sufficient ambiguity\nto have yielded different translations. The verse is translated in the KJV as\n\"Unto Shem also, the father of all the children of Eber, the brother of\n<u>Japheth the elder</u>, even to him were children born.\". However, the New\nAmerican Standard Bible gives, \"Also to Shem, the father of all the children of\nEber, and the <u>older brother of Japheth</u>, children were born.\"\n\nGenesis 11:10 records that Shem was still 100 years old at the birth of\nArphaxad, (but nearly 101 - see Chronology note,) two years after the flood,\nmaking him barely 99 at the time the flood began; and that he lived for another\n500 years after this, making his age at death 600 years.\n\nThe children of Shem were Elam, Asshur, Arphaxad, Lud, and Aram, in addition to\ndaughters. Abraham, the patriarch of the Hebrews and Arabs, was one of the\ndescendants of Arphaxad.\n\nIslamic literature describes Shem as one of the believing sons of Noah. Some\nsources even identify Shem as a prophet in his own right and that he was the\nnext prophet after his father.<ref>Historical Dictionary of Prophets in Islam\nand Judaism, Wheeler, Shem</ref> In one Muslim legend, Shem was one of the\npeople that God made Jesus resurrect as a sign to the Children of\nIsrael.<ref>Stories of the Prophets, Ibn Kathir, Story of Jesus</ref>\n\nThe 1st-century historian Flavius Josephus, among many others, recounted the\ntradition that these five sons were the progenitors of the nations of Elam,\nAssyria, Chaldea, Lydia, and Syria, respectively.\n\nSemitic is still a commonly used term for the Semitic languages, as a subset of\nthe Afro-Asiatic languages, denoting the common linguistic heritage of Arabic,\nAramaic, Akkadian, Ethiopic, Hebrew and Phoenician languages.\n\nAccording to some Jewish traditions (e.g., B. Talmud Nedarim 32b; Genesis Rabbah\n46:7; Genesis Rabbah 56:10; Leviticus Rabbah 25:6; Numbers Rabbah 4:8.), Shem is\nbelieved to have been Melchizedek, King of Salem whom Abraham is recorded to\nhave met after the battle of the four kings.\n\nIn a few of the many extra-biblical sources that describe him, Shem is also\ncredited with killing Nimrod, son of Cush.\n\nShem is mentioned in Genesis 5:32, 6:10; 7:13; 9:18,23,26-27; 10; 11:10; also in\n1 Chronicles 1:4.\n\n, c. 100 AD; Japheth's sons shown in red, Ham's sons in blue, Shem's sons\nin green.]]\n",
