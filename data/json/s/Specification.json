A specification is a type of technical standard.\n\nA technical specification may be developed by any of various kinds of\norganizations, both public and private. Example organization types include a\ncorporation, a consortium (a small group of corporations), a trade association\n(an industry-wide group of corporations), a national government (including its\nmilitary, regulatory agencies, and national laboratories and institutes), a\nprofessional association (society), a purpose-made standards organization such\nas ISO, or vendor-neutral developed generic requirements ([http://telecom-info.telcordia.com/site-\ncgi/ido/index.html Telcordia Technologies]). It is common for one organization\nto refer to (reference, call out, cite) the standards of another. Voluntary\nstandards may become mandatory if adopted by a government or business contract.\n\nA Design or Product Specification describes the features of the solutions for\nthe Requirement Specification. Sometimes the term specification is here used in\nconnection with a data sheet (or spec sheet). This may be confusing. A data\nsheet describes the technical characteristics of an item or product as designed\nand/or produced. It can be published by a manufacturer to help people choose\nproducts or to help use the products. A data sheet is not a technical\nspecification as described in this article.\n","linknr":429,"url":"Specification","recorded":1362689066,"links":45,"instances":["assessment","pharmacy","united_states","construction","engineering","software","business"],"pdf":["http://www.astm.org/COMMIT/Blue_Book.pdf","http://www.astm.org/COMMIT/Blue_Book.pdf","http://www.fda.gov/cder/guidance/3634fnl.pdf","http://www.fda.gov/cder/guidance/3634fnl.pdf","http://www.villanova.edu/unit/assets/documents/support/admin/sop-project-specification.pdf","http://www.villanova.edu/unit/assets/documents/support/admin/sop-project-specification.pdf","http://www.peterstout.com/pdfs/tech_specs_detailed.pdf","http://www.peterstout.com/pdfs/tech_specs_detailed.pdf","http://www.ieee.org/portal/cms_docs/pubs/confstandards/pdfs/IEEE-PDF-SpecV401.pdf","http://www.ieee.org/portal/cms_docs/pubs/confstandards/pdfs/IEEE-PDF-SpecV401.pdf","http://www.pmda.go.jp/ich/m/m4_ectd_spec_ver3-2_04_5_27e.pdf","http://www.pmda.go.jp/ich/m/m4_ectd_spec_ver3-2_04_5_27e.pdf","http://www.utdallas.edu/~chung/ieee-templates.pdf","http://www.utdallas.edu/~chung/ieee-templates.pdf","http://www-group.slac.stanford.edu/esh/eshmanual/references/laserTemplateSOP.pdf","http://www-group.slac.stanford.edu/esh/eshmanual/references/laserTemplateSOP.pdf","http://www.utoledo.edu/depts/safety/docs/Lab_Safety/BSL2_SOP.pdf","http://www.utoledo.edu/depts/safety/docs/Lab_Safety/BSL2_SOP.pdf"],"categories":["Product
