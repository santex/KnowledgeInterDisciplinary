{"cursor":"30628","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n spinning yarn in 1942. Gandhi believed in a life of simplicity and self-\n sufficiency.]] 'Simple living' encompasses a number of different voluntary\n practices to simplify one's lifestyle. These may include reducing one's\n possessions or increasing self-sufficiency, for example. Simple living may be\n characterized by individuals being satisfied with what they need rather than\n want. Although asceticism generally promotes living\n simply and refraining from luxury and indulgence, not all proponents of simple\n living are ascetics. Griffiths, Michael. B., Flemming Christiansen, and\n Malcolm Chapman. (2010) 'Chinese Consumers: The Romantic Reappraisalâ.\n Ethnography, Sept 2010, 11, 331â57. Simple living is distinct from those\n living in forced poverty, as it is a voluntary lifestyle choice.\n\nAdherents may choose simple living for a variety of personal reasons, such as\nspirituality, health, increase in quality time for family and friends, workâlife\nbalance, personal taste, frugality, or reducing personal ecological footprint\nand stress. Simple living can also be a reaction to materialism and conspicuous\nconsumption. Some cite socio-political goals aligned with the anti-consumerist\nor anti-war movements, including conservation, degrowth, social justice, ethnic\ndiversity, tax resistance and sustainable development.\n","linknr":1369,"url":"Simple_living","recorded":1362579856,"links":61,"instances":["medicine","philosophy","sociology","author","activist","philosophy","biophysical","moneyless_man","horticulturist","nutrition","social_philosopher","economics","activist"],"pdf":["http://www.tssf.org.uk/attachments/article/219/Living_a_Life_of_Simplicity.pdf","http://www.jamesrobertson.com/book/neweconomicsofsustainabledevelopment.pdf","http://www.nwfriends.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/the-testimony-of-quaker-simplicity.pdf"],"categories":["Simple
