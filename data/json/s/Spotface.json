{"cursor":"3434","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'spotface' or 'spot face' is a machined feature in which a certain region of\nthe workpiece (a spot) is faced, providing a smooth, flat, accurately located\nsurface. This is especially relevant on workpieces that are cast or forged,\nwhere the spotface's smooth, flat, accurately located surface stands in\ndistinction to the surrounding surface whose roughness, flatness, and location\nare subject to wider tolerances and thus not assured with a machining level of\nprecision. The most common application of 'spotfacing' ('spot facing') is facing\nthe area around a bolt hole where the bolt's head will sit, which is often done\nby cutting a shallow counterbore, just deep enough \"to clean up\"âthat is, only\nenough material is removed to get down past any irregularity and thus make the\nsurface flat. . Other common applications of spotfacing involve facing\na pad onto a boss, creating planar surfaces in known locations that can orient a\ncasting or forging into position in the assembly; allow part marking such as\nstamping or nameplate riveting; or offer machine-finish visual appeal in spots,\nwithout the need for finishing all over (FAO).\n\nThe cutters most often used to cut spotfaces are counterbore cutters and\nendmills. In manual machining especially, the former is useful because its pilot\nguides the cutter into the correct location (established by the bolt hole), and\nits cutting lips are perpendicular to the hole axis with no relief angle,\nmeaning that a plunging cut, moving in only the Z-axis, will leave a flat\nsurface. In contrast, most general-purpose endmills have a relief angle such\nthat a plunging cut (Z-axis-only toolpath) will leave a very slightly convex\nsurface. But in CNC machining this is irrelevant, because the flat spotface is\nleft by circular interpolation of the endmill as it traces a circular toolpath\nin the XY plane. Zero-angle cutters obviate this, functioning similarly to the\ntraditional counterbore cutters of manual machining but needing no pilot. Spot\nfacing of larger planar surfaces sometimes employs face mills.\n\n'Backspotfacing' ('back spot facing') is analogous to backboring, meaning that\nthe tool manages to reach to the far side of the workpiece (away from the\nspindle side) and cut back toward the spindle. Such operations can be done with\nboring bars reaching through a hole while shifted off-center, then shifting onto\ncenter for the cut, or with back-deburring style tools whose cutting edges open\nand close in umbrella-like or check-valve-like fashion.\n\nSome fastener designs can obviate spotfacing for some applications. For example,\na self-aligning nut allows the nut to find its own perpendicularity to the\nthread axis by floating via a pair of spherical bearing surfaces (a ball-in-cup\narrangement).\n","linknr":92,"url":"Spotface","recorded":1374544277,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Spotface&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Spotface&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Machining","/wiki/Facing_(machining)","/wiki/Casting","/wiki/Forging","/wiki/Surface_roughness","/wiki/Flatness_(manufacturing)","/wiki/Engineering_tolerance","/wiki/Counterbore","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Boss_(engineering)","/wiki/Counterbore","/wiki/Endmill","/wiki/Numerical_control","/wiki/Milling_cutter#Face_mill","/wiki/Boring_bar","/wiki/Self-aligning_nut","/w/index.php?title=Spotface&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Spotface&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-1","#CITEREFDegarmoBlackKohser2003","/w/index.php?title=Spotface&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0-471-65653-4","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Spotface&oldid=528353205","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Machining","/wiki/Category:Metalworking_terminology","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Spotface&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Spotface","/wiki/Spotface","/wiki/Talk:Spotface","#","/wiki/Spotface","/w/index.php?title=Spotface&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Spotface&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Spotface","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Spotface","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Spotface&oldid=528353205","/w/index.php?title=Spotface&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7580052","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Spotface&id=528353205","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Spotface","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Spotface&oldid=528353205&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Spotface&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7580052#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotface","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":["machining","engineering","manufacturing"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Machining","Metalworking
