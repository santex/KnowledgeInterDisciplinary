Continued heat input\nwill then \"super\" heat, the dry saturated steam. This will occur if saturated\nsteam contacts a surface with a higher temperature.

The steam is then described as superheated by the\nnumber of degrees it has been heated above saturation temperature.\n\nSuperheated steam and liquid water cannot coexist under thermodynamic\nequilibrium, as any additional heat simply evaporates more water and the steam\nwill become saturated steam. However this restriction may be violated\ntemporarily in dynamic (non-equilibrium) situations. To produce superheated\nsteam in a power plant or for processes (such as drying paper) the saturated\nsteam drawn from a boiler is passed through a separate heating device (a\nsuperheater) which transfers additional heat to the steam by contact or by\nradiation.\n\nSuperheated steam is not suitable for sterilization.

This is because the superheated steam is dry. Dry steam must\nreach much higher temperatures and the materials exposed for a longer time\nperiod to have the same effectiveness; or equal Fo kill value. Superheated\nsteam is also not useful for heating. Saturated steam has a much higher\nuseful heat content.

The\nvalue of superheated steam in these applications is its ability to release\ntremendous quantities of internal energy yet remain above the condensation\ntemperature of water vapor; at the pressures at which reaction turbines and\nreciprocating piston engines operate.\n\nOf prime importance in these applications is the fact that water vapor\ncontaining entrained liquid droplets is incompressible. If steam doing work in a\nreciprocating engine or turbine, cools to a temperature at which liquid droplets\nform; the water droplets entrained in the fluid flow will strike the mechanical\nparts of engines or turbines, with enough force to bend, crack or fracture them.\nSuperheating and pressure reduction through expansion, ensures that the steam\nflow throughout its passage through a turbine or an engine, always remains as a\ncomprisable gas, which will not damage the internal moving parts of the turbine\nor engine through which the steam passes.\n","linknr":133,"url":"Superheated_steam","recorded":1362480474,"links":17,"instances":["microbiology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Water","Steam power"],"headings":["Saturated steam","Uses","See also","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["sterilization","microbiology"]],"members":["sterilization"],"related":["Steam","Vapor_quality","Thermodynamic_equilibrium","Boiler","Superheater","Radiation","Sterilization_(microbiology)","Fourier_number","Boiling_point","Standard_pressure","Steam_turbine","Steam_locomotive","Saturated_steam","Steam_engine","Shunting_locomotives","Soil_steam_sterilization","Superheated_water"]}
