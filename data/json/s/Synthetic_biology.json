{"cursor":"44728","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Synthetic biology' is the design and construction of biological devices and\nsystems for useful purposes. It is an area of biological\nresearch and technology that combines science and engineering. It encompasses a\nvariety of different approaches, methodologies, and disciplines with a focus on\nengineering biology  .\n\nSynthetic biologists approach the creation of new biological systems from\ndifferent perspectives, focusing on finding how life works (the origin of life)\nor how to use it to benefit society. The former focus includes the approach of\nbiology, inserting man-made DNA into a living cell; and chemistry, working on\ngene synthesis as an extension of synthetic chemistry. The latter focus includes\nengineering, building the new biological system as a platform for various\ntechnologies; and rewriting, rebuilding the natural systems to provide the\nengineered surrogates.\n\nThe advance of synthetic biology relies on several key enabling technologies\nprovided at ever increasing speed and lower cost. DNA sequencing, fabrication of\ngenes, modeling how synthetic genes behave, and precisely measuring gene\nbehavior are essential tools in synthetic biology.\n\nGeneticists have found a number of gene sequences which correspond to differing\ntraits in organisms, these individual gene sequences have been developed and\nincorporated into DNA similar to genetic \"lego\" blocks. This is essentially how\ngenetic engineers alter the DNA of living organisms. What separates Synthetic\nbiology from Genetic engineering is that rather than altering an already\nexistent DNA strand, synthetic biology puts these \"blocks\" together from scratch\nto build an entirely new strand of DNA which is then placed into an empty living\ncell. These new cells can be \"built\" to perform a number of functions that could\ngreatly benefit humanity but could not be found in nature. Synthetic biology\nintroduces three new foundational technologies to genetic engineering; the\nability to synthesize new genes in a de novo fashion, the ability to obscure\ncomplexity through abstraction and the introduction of engineering standards.\n\nBiosafety and biosecurity concerns are the understandable response to this new\nscience and technology that have the potential to profoundly change the nature\nof life forms as we know it. Numbers of civic society groups and online forums\ncalled for study of societal and ethical impact of this new technology,\nlicensing and monitoring. The community of synthetic biology has discussed\npolicy options and started initiatives of self-regulation. Symposia and meetings\nby the broader science community have brought the efforts at developing\nguidelines and regulations; addressing the issues of intellectual property and\ngovernance, and the ethical, societal and legal implications. Several bioethics\nresearch institutes published reports on ethical concerns and the public\nperception of synthetic biology. A report from the U.S. Presidential Commission\nfor the Study of Bioethical Issues called for enhanced federal oversight in the\nUnited States on this emerging technology.\n\n\"]]\n","linknr":832,"url":"Synthetic_biology","recorded":1362510204,"links":57,"instances":["boston_university","biology"],"pdf":["http://www.jcvi.org/cms/fileadmin/site/research/projects/synthetic-genomics-report/synthetic-genomics-report.pdf","http://www.synbiosafe.eu/uploads///pdf/SSBJ-SYNBIOSAFE%20e-conference.pdf","http://etcgroup.org/upload/publication/602/01/synbioreportweb.pdf","http://www.synbiosafe.eu/uploads/pdf/Schmidt_etal-2009-SSBJ.pdf","http://www.synbiosafe.eu/uploads/pdf/Schmidt_etal-2009-SSBJ.pdf","http://www.synbiosafe.eu/uploads/pdf/Kelle-2009-SSBJ.pdf","http://www.synbiosafe.eu/uploads/pdf/Kelle-2009-SSBJ.pdf","http://www.markusschmidt.eu/pdf/Diffusion_of_synthetic_biology.pdf","http://www.markusschmidt.eu/pdf/Diffusion_of_synthetic_biology.pdf","http://www.ia-sb.eu/tasks/sites/synthetic-biology/assets/File/pdf/iasb_report_biosecurity_syntheticbiology.pdf","http://www.synbiosafe.eu/uploads/pdf/Marliere-SSBJ-2009.pdf","http://www.synbiosafe.eu/uploads/pdf/Marliere-SSBJ-2009.pdf","http://www.synbiosafe.eu/uploads///pdf/Diffusion_of_synthetic_biology.pdf","http://www.synbiosafe.eu/uploads///pdf/Diffusion_of_synthetic_biology.pdf","http://www.springerlink.com/content/r170x43868877p68/fulltext.pdf","http://www.springerlink.com/content/r170x43868877p68/fulltext.pdf","http://www.springerlink.com/content/r170x43868877p68/fulltext.pdf","http://www.springerlink.com/content/r170x43868877p68/fulltext.pdf","http://www.bioethics.gov/documents/synthetic-biology/PCSBI-Synthetic-Biology-Report-12.16.10.pdf","http://www.bioethics.gov/cms/sites/default/files/PCSBI-Synthetic-Biology-Report-Press-Release-12.16.10.pdf","http://www.bioethics.gov/cms/sites/default/files/PCSBI-Synthetic-Biology-Report-Press-Release-12.16.10.pdf"],"categories":["Biotechnology","Molecular
