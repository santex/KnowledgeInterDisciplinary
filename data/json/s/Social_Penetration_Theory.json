{"cursor":"27290","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The 'social penetration theory' proposes that, as relationships develop,\ninterpersonal communication moves from relatively shallow, non-intimate levels\nto deeper, more intimate ones. Griffin, E. (2006). A first look\nat communication theory. (6th edition). New York: McGraw-Hill. The theory\nwas formulated by psychologists Irwin Altman and Dalmas Taylor in 1973 to\nprovide an understanding of the closeness between two individuals.\n\nThe social penetration theory states that this process occurs primarily through\nself-disclosure and closeness develops if the participants proceed in a gradual\nand orderly fashion from superficial to intimate levels of exchange as a\nfunction of both immediate and forecast outcomes. Altman, I. &\nTaylor, D. (1973). Social penetration: The development of interpersonal\nrelationships. New York: Holt. Altman and Taylor believe that only through\nopening one's self to the main route to social penetration-self-disclosure-by\nbecoming vulnerable to another person can a close relationship develop.\nVulnerability can be expressed in a variety of ways, including the giving of\nanything which is considered to be a personal possession, such as a dresser\ndrawer given to a partner. Taylor, D. & Altman, I. (1987).\nCommunication in interpersonal relationships: Social penetration processes.\nInterpersonal processes: New directions in communication research. p.257-\n277. This psychological theory, as with many others, is applied in the\ncontext of interpersonal communication. It can also be defined as the process of\ndeveloping deeper intimacy with another person through mutual self-disclosure\nand other forms of vulnerability. The Social Penetration theory is known as an\nobjective theory, meaning that the theory is based on data drawn from\nexperiments, and not from conclusions based on individuals' specific\nexperiences. This theory is also guided by the assumptions that relationship\ndevelopment is systematic and predictable and also includes deterioration, or\ngrowing apart, besides the major four stages.\n\nAs for the speed of self-disclosure, Altman and Taylor were convinced that the\nprocess of social penetration moves a lot faster in the beginning stages of a\nrelationship but then it slows considerably. Those who are able to develop a\nlong term, positive reward/ cost outcome are the same people who are able to\nshare important matches of breadth categories. The early reward/ cost assessment\nhave a strong impact on the relationships reactions and involvement. When you\nhave expectancies in a relationship regarding the future it plays a major role\non the outcome in the relationship.\n\nTo self-disclose, one must open up their inner feelings,this could be anything\nfrom their personal motives or desires. To self disclose could bring a\nrelationship to a new level of intimacy.\n","linknr":211,"url":"Social_Penetration_Theory","recorded":1372154313,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Social_penetration_theory&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Social_penetration_theory&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","/wiki/Social_penetration_theory","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","/w/index.php?title=Social_Penetration_Theory&redirect=no","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Interpersonal_communication","/wiki/Intimate_relationship","#cite_note-Griffin-1","/wiki/Psychologist","/wiki/Irwin_Altman","/wiki/Self-disclosure","#cite_note-Altman1-2","#cite_note-Taylor-3","/wiki/Interpersonal_communication","/wiki/Vulnerability","#Assumptions","#Onion_metaphor","#Stages","#Breadth_and_depth","#Breadth","#Depth","#Relationship","#Rewards_and_costs_assessment","#Outcome","#Comparison_level","#Comparison_level_of_alternatives","#Extensive_research_and_applications","#Interpersonal_communication","#Organizational_communication","#Computer-mediated_communication","#Benefits","#Barriers","#Examples","#Social_networking","#Online_dating","#Blogging_and_online_chatting","#Criticism","#Notes","#Further_reading","/w/index.php?title=Social_penetration_theory&action=edit&section=1","#cite_note-4","/w/index.php?title=Social_penetration_theory&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/File:Cortando_cebolla.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/Cortando_cebolla.jpg/220px-Cortando_cebolla.jpg","/wiki/File:Cortando_cebolla.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf6/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Onion","#cite_note-5","/w/index.php?title=Social_penetration_theory&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/Clich%C3%A9s","/wiki/Norm_(social)","/wiki/Appropriateness","/wiki/Friendship","/wiki/Idioms","/wiki/Kissing","/wiki/Plateau_(mathematics)","/wiki/Thoughts","/wiki/Beliefs","/wiki/Values","/wiki/Withdrawal","#cite_note-6","/w/index.php?title=Social_penetration_theory&action=edit&section=4","/wiki/File:Breadth_and_depth.jpeg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/15/Breadth_and_depth.jpeg/220px-Breadth_and_depth.jpeg","/wiki/File:Breadth_and_depth.jpeg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf6/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/w/index.php?title=Social_penetration_theory&action=edit&section=5","#cite_note-7","/w/index.php?title=Social_penetration_theory&action=edit&section=6","/wiki/Human_sexual_activity","/wiki/Anxiety","/w/index.php?title=Social_penetration_theory&action=edit&section=7","/w/index.php?title=Social_penetration_theory&action=edit&section=8","/wiki/Social_Exchange_Theory","/wiki/John_Thibaut","/wiki/Harold_Kelley","/w/index.php?title=Social_penetration_theory&action=edit&section=9","/w/index.php?title=Social_penetration_theory&action=edit&section=10","/wiki/Desirability","/wiki/Social_interaction","/wiki/Dyadic_relation","#cite_note-Griffin-1","/w/index.php?title=Social_penetration_theory&action=edit&section=11","/w/index.php?title=Social_penetration_theory&action=edit&section=12","/w/index.php?title=Social_penetration_theory&action=edit&section=13","#cite_note-8","/w/index.php?title=Social_penetration_theory&action=edit&section=14","/w/index.php?title=Social_penetration_theory&action=edit&section=15","/w/index.php?title=Social_penetration_theory&action=edit&section=16","/wiki/Computer-mediated_communication","/wiki/Unconventional","/w/index.php?title=Social_penetration_theory&action=edit&section=17","/wiki/Skepticism","/w/index.php?title=Social_penetration_theory&action=edit&section=18","/w/index.php?title=Social_penetration_theory&action=edit&section=19","/wiki/Social_networking_sites","/wiki/Facebook","/wiki/MySpace","/wiki/Twitter","/wiki/LinkedIn","/wiki/Hi5","/wiki/Myyearbook","/wiki/Friendster","#cite_note-9","/wiki/Trust_(social_sciences)","/wiki/Affection","/wiki/Hyperpersonal_model","/wiki/Attribution_(psychology)","/w/index.php?title=Social_penetration_theory&action=edit&section=20","#cite_note-10","#cite_note-11","/w/index.php?title=Social_penetration_theory&action=edit&section=21","/wiki/Online_chat","#cite_note-12","#cite_note-13","/w/index.php?title=Social_penetration_theory&action=edit&section=22","#cite_note-14","#cite_note-15","/w/index.php?title=Social_penetration_theory&action=edit&section=23","#cite_ref-Griffin_1-0","#cite_ref-Griffin_1-1","#cite_ref-Altman1_2-0","#c
