In mammals, there are two broad\ntypes of stem cells: embryonic stem cells, which are isolated from the inner\ncell mass of blastocysts, and adult stem cells, which are found in various\ntissues. In adult organisms, stem cells and progenitor cells act as a repair\nsystem for the body, replenishing adult tissues. In a developing embryo, stem\ncells can differentiate into all the specialized cells (these are called\npluripotent cells), but also maintain the normal turnover of regenerative\norgans, such as blood, skin, or intestinal tissues.\n\nThere are three accessible sources of autologous adult stem cells in humans:\n# Bone marrow, which requires extraction by harvesting, that is, drilling into\n# bone (typically the femur or iliac crest), Adipose tissue (lipid cells), which\n# requires extraction by liposuction, and Blood, which requires extraction\n# through pheresis, wherein blood is drawn from the donor (similar to a blood\n# donation), passed through a machine that extracts the stem cells and returns\n# other portions of the blood to the donor.\nStem cells can also be taken from umbilical cord blood just after birth. Of all\nstem cell types, autologous harvesting involves the least risk. By definition,\nautologous cells are obtained from one's own body, just as one may bank his or\nher own blood for elective surgical procedures.\n\nHighly plastic adult stem cells are routinely used in medical therapies, for\nexample in bone marrow transplantation. Stem cells can now be artificially grown\nand transformed (differentiated) into specialized cell types with\ncharacteristics consistent with cells of various tissues such as muscles or\nnerves through cell culture. Embryonic cell lines and autologous embryonic stem\ncells generated through therapeutic cloning have also been proposed as promising\ncandidates for future therapies. Research into stem cells grew out of\nfindings by Ernest A. McCulloch and James E. Till at the University of Toronto\nin the 1960s. Israel is one of the world leaders in stem\ncell research, with the largest number of articles, patents and research studies\nper capita.
