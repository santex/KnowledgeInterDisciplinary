Following the election, the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats\nformed the Scottish Executive, with Labour Member of the Scottish Parliament\n(MSP) Donald Dewar becoming First Minister.\n\nThe Scottish Parliament was created after a referendum on devoloution took place\non 11 September 1997 in which 74.3% of those who voted approved the idea. The\nScotland Act (1998) was then passed by the UK Parliament which established the\ndevolved Scottish parliament and Scottish Executive. The parliament was to be\nelected using Mixed member proportional representation which is a combination of\n73 (First-past-the-post) constituencies using the same boundaries as was used in\nthe 1997 UK General Election with the exception of Orkney and Shetland as they\nwere made separate constituencies and proportional representation with the 73\nconstituencies being grouped together to make eight regions which would each\nelect seven additional members to make a total of 129 Members of Scottish\nParliament (MSP's). This meant that it would be unlikely for any party to gain a\nmajority of seats in the new parliament and either minority or coalition\nScottish Executive's would have to be formed.\n\nThe first general election to the Scottish Parliament overall produced few\nsurprises with the Labour Party still enjoying high popularity following their\nlandslide UK general election win two years earlier as widely expected was the\nlargest party winning 56 seats, mostly in their traditional Central Belt\nheartlands, which was nine seats short of an overall majority and a coalition\nwas then formed with the Liberal Democrats who won 17 seats. The Scottish\nNational Party (SNP) had done well in opinion polls running up to the election,\ngaining 40% in some approval ratings but this level of support was not\nmaintained, and the SNP were the second largest party with 35 seats, but this\nwas at the time their best performance since October 1974. The Conservative\nParty, still recovering from their wipeout in 1997 across Scotland, failed to\nwin a single constituency seat but did manage to win 18 seats through the\nAdditional Member System.\n\nThe Scottish Socialist Party (SSP) and the Greens picked up unexpected\nadditional member seats. Robin Harper became the first ever elected Green\nparliamentarian in the history of the United Kingdom. Dennis Canavan, who had\nfailed to become an approved Labour candidate, won the Falkirk West constituency\nas an independent candidate.\n\nFollowing the election the new parliament meet in the General Assembly Hall of\nthe Church of Scotland in Edinburgh for the very first time on Wednesday 12 May\n1999 although the actual devolution of powers from Westminster to the Scottish\nParliament did take place until midnight on Thursday 1 July 1999 almost two\nmonths later.\n\nFor a full list of MSPs elected, see [[Members of the Scottish Parliament, 1999-\n2003]].
