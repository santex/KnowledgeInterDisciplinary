A specification is a type of technical standard.\n\nA technical specification may be developed by any of various kinds of\norganizations, both public and private. Example organization types include a\ncorporation, a consortium (a small group of corporations), a trade association\n(an industry-wide group of corporations), a national government (including its\nmilitary, regulatory agencies, and national laboratories and institutes), a\nprofessional association (society), a purpose-made standards organization such\nas ISO, or vendor-neutral developed generic requirements ([http://telecom-info.telcordia.com/site-\ncgi/ido/index.html Telcordia Technologies]). It is common for one organization\nto refer to (reference, call out, cite) the standards of another. Voluntary\nstandards may become mandatory if adopted by a government or business contract.\n\nA Design or Product Specification describes the features of the solutions for\nthe Requirement Specification. Sometimes the term specification is here used in\nconnection with a data sheet (or spec sheet). This may be confusing. A data\nsheet describes the technical characteristics of an item or product as designed\nand/or produced. It can be published by a manufacturer to help people choose\nproducts or to help use the products. A data sheet is not a technical\nspecification as described in this article.\n","title":"Specification%20%28technical%20standard%29","headings":["Use","Guidance and content","Process capability considerations","Construction specifications in North America","Construction specifications in the UK","Food and drug specifications","Information technology","See also","Notes and references","Further reading"]},"micro-relation":["11: International_Organization_for_Standardization"," 5: Technical_standard"," 2: ASTM"," 2: Verification_and_Validation"," 2: Change_control"," 2: Quality_management_system"," 2: MasterFormat"," 2: Pharmacopoeia"," 2: Mathematics"," 2: Software"," 2: Documentation"," 1: Requirements"," 1: ASTM_International"," 1: WebFinance"," 1: Overengineering"," 1: Public_sector"," 1: Private_sector"," 1: Corporation"," 1: Consortium"," 1: Trade_association"," 1: Military"," 1: Regulatory_agency"," 1: Professional_association"," 1: Standards_organization"," 1: Data_sheet"," 1: Engineering"," 1: Manufacturing"," 1: Business"," 1: Suppliers"," 1: Gary_Blake"," 1: Robert_W._Bly"," 1: New_York_City"," 1: Contract"," 1: European_Committee_for_Standardization"," 1: United_States_Military_Standard"," 1: Verification_and_validation"," 1: Standing_operating_procedure"," 1: Identifier"," 1: Logo"," 1: Trademark"," 1: Copyright"," 1: Ownership"," 1: Terminology"," 1: Definitions"," 1: Abbreviations"," 1: Test_method"," 1: Acceptance_testing"," 1: Drawings"," 1: Photograph"," 1: Technical_illustration"," 1: Certification"," 1: Safety"," 1: Natural_environment"," 1: Quality_control"," 1: Acceptance_sampling"," 1: References"," 1: Citation"," 1: Traceability"," 1: ISO_690"," 1: Signatures"," 1: Title_21_CFR_Part_11"," 1: IEEE"," 1: Annexes"," 1: Addendum"," 1: Normal_distribution"," 1: Process_capability"," 1: Process_control"," 1: Total_Quality_Management"," 1: North_America"," 1: Building"," 1: Firestop"," 1: Building_envelope"," 1: Fireproofing"," 1: Europe"," 1: Area"," 1: Drywall"," 1: Quantity_surveyor"," 1: Architect"," 1: Architectural_engineering"," 1: Building_materials"," 1: UK"," 1: Architects"," 1: Architectural_technologists"," 1: Structural_engineer"," 1: Landscape_architect"," 1: Building_services_engineering"," 1: National_Building_Specification"," 1: Royal_Institute_of_British_Architects"," 1: Building_Information_Modeling"," 1: British_Pharmacopoeia"," 1: European_Pharmacopoeia"," 1: Japanese_Pharmacopoeia"," 1: The_International_Pharmacopoeia"," 1: United_States_Pharmacopoeia"," 1: British_National_Formulary_for_Children"," 1: British_National_Formulary"," 1: National_Formulary"," 1: Codex_Alimentarius"," 1: Food_Standards_Australia_New_Zealand"," 1: Food_labeling_regulations"," 1: Hazard_Analysis_and_Critical_Control_Points"," 1: Food"," 1: Pharmaceutical"," 1: Machinery"," 1: Packaging"," 1: Logistics"," 1: Cold_chain"," 1: Computer_hardware"," 1: Implementation"," 1: Formal_verification"," 1: Program_refinement"," 1: Computer_program"," 1: Safety-critical"," 1: Software_systems"," 1: Software_development"," 1: Software_system"," 1: System"," 1: International_Conference_on_Harmonisation_of_Technical_Requirements_for_Registration_of_Pharmaceuticals_for_Human_Use"," 1: The_University_of_Toledo"," 1: Benchmarking"," 1: Benchmark_specification"," 1: Construction_Specifications_Institute"," 1: Defense_Standard"," 1: Design_specification"," 1: Diagnostic_design_specification"," 1: Document_identifier"," 1: Document_management_system"," 1: Formal_specification"," 1: Functional_specification"," 1: List_of_ISO_standards"," 1: List_of_Air_Ministry_specifications"," 1: Manufacturing_test_requirement_design_specification"," 1: Open_standard"," 1: Process_specification"," 1: Product_design_specification"," 1: Publicly_Available_Specification"," 1: Revision_control"," 1: Requirements_analysis"," 1: Shop_drawing"," 1: Specification_and_Description_Language"," 1: Specification_tree"," 1: Standardization"," 1: Statistical_interference"," 1: Technical_documentation"," 1: Emerald_Group_Publishing"]}
