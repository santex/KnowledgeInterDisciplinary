It is prepared using a\nstandard substance, such as a primary standard. Standard solutions are used to\ndetermine the concentrations of other substances, such as solutions in\ntitrations. The concentrations of standard solutions are normally expressed in\nunits of moles per litre (mol/L, often abbreviated to M for molarity), moles per\ncubic decimetre (mol/dm 3), kilomoles per cubic metre\n(kmol/m 3) or in terms related to those used in particular titrations\n(such as titres).\n\nA simple standard is obtained by the dilution of a single element or a substance\nin a soluble solvent with which it reacts...\n","linknr":102,"url":"Standard_solution","recorded":1362575907,"links":21,"instances":["unit"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Analytical chemistry"],"headings":["Uses","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/Chem_template.svg/32px-Chem_template.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["mole","unit"]],"members":["mole"],"related":["Analytical_chemistry","Solution","Concentration","Primary_standard","Titration","Mole_(unit)","Molarity","Titre","Analyte","Absorbance","Beer's_Law","Spectroscopy","Wiley-Blackwell"]}
