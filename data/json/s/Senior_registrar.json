{"cursor":"5667","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nA 'Senior Registrar' was a type of doctor in the United Kingdom or Ireland, but\nthe post no longer exists.\n\nSenior Registrars (SRs) were medical (or dental) practitioners who were\nundertaking, or had completed, several years of higher level training in a\nhospital specialty or Public Health but had not yet gained a position as\nconsultant (either by choice or because the competition was too stiff), thus\ndifferentiating them from the modern day Specialist registrars who are still\ncompleting training.\n\nUsually, but not invariably, a higher qualification such as the membership or\nfellowship of one of the Royal Colleges and, in the more competitive\nspecialties, several publications in peer-reviewed journals would have been\nobtained at the Senior House Officer or Registrar level, a short or long time\nbefore obtaining the Senior Registrar post.\n\nAs well as gaining clinical, teaching and administrative experience, SRs were\nexpected to do research: usually clinical, but sometimes laboratory-based, even\nin clinical specialties. Several publications were expected. Some tried to\nobtain a higher degree: in earlier days normally an MD or ChM (or the local\nvariant), but in later times a few aimed at a PhD (which involved more formal\nsupervision) instead. Research for a PhD could be done part-time. Sometimes a\nhigher degree would have been obtained before the SR appointment. This was also\nthe most convenient stage for a minority of psychiatrists to undergo personal\nanalysis as part of their psychotherapy training.\n\nThe numbers of these posts were limited, with the aim of roughly corresponding\nto the numbers of vacancies expected for Consultant or Senior Lecturer posts in\nthe National Health Service or medical schools, so in many fields competition\nwas more severe at the level of entry to the SR grade than for consultant posts.\n\nLatterly Senior Registrars each had a National Training Number (NTN), which they\nrelinquished on leaving training on obtaining a Certificate of Completion of\nTraining (CCT): later changed to Certificate of Completion of Specialist\nTraining (CCST) and now replaced by CT. Sometimes the same department would\ncontain both registrars with higher qualifications waiting for a SR post and a\nsenior registrar with NTN, who could be doing similar clinical work and\nresearch. In some other systems, such as that of Canada, there was no such externally-\nimposed limit on trainee numbers.\n\nFull-time academics (lecturers and some research fellows) could sometimes be\nupgraded from Honorary Registrar to Honorary Senior Registrar (with NTN) at an\ninterview, without the open competition otherwise required.\n\nThere was also a side pathway for academics with an international reputation\n(shown by publications and presentations abroad) to get onto the General Medical\nCouncil's Specialist Register (and thus become eligible for an NHS consultant\nappointment) on the strength of their research, without having the clinical\nexperience normally required for any particular specialty. This was justified by\nthe likelihood of such a person having a tertiary-referral post as part of a\nteam in an academic centre.\n\nSRs could, especially towards the end of their training, be given similar\nresponsibility to a consultant, but there was normally a named consultant with\nclinical responsibility for each junior doctorâs activities. Locum consultant\nappointments could be taken by a SR (or sometimes a trainee at a lower grade, or\nan experienced person with no higher qualification) while retaining their SR\npost. It was also possible to go abroad to do research for a defined period.\n\nSenior Registrars had their progress reviewed annually by a local committee of\nsenior clinicians and academics: this was in force long before the other\ntraining grades such as Senior House Officer and Registrar had any supervision\noutside of their immediate superiors and has been continued in the successor\ngrades of Specialist Registrar (SpR) and Specialty Registrar (StR).\n\nThe duration of an SR post depended largely on the level of competition in the\nfield, and the kind of post sought after: sole consultant in the speciality in a\ncountry hospital, part-time consultant in a metropolitan centre with substantial\nprivate practice, academic in a university centre, etc. Women holding part-time\nSR posts could take twice as many years in higher training.\n\nThose who stayed on too long could be under pressure to move on and allow others\nin. Some people changed speciality at this level (e.g. from cardiology to\ngeriatrics), switched to general practice, or went abroad, though a certain\namount of retraining might be required. After training in a subspecialty, the\npost obtained might be in a broader subject. In general practice a trainee might\nhave to spend a year as a registrar as there were no senior registrars.\n\nIn contrast, in certain fields and at certain times it might be possible to\nmake rapid progress: it was possible for psychiatric SRs to move into a\nconsultant appointment âsomewhereâ after a year or so in the less regulated\n1970s and 1980s.\n\nThe term âJunior Registrarâ is sometimes encountered: this title was\noccasionally given to a Senior House Officer awarded enhanced responsibility.\n\nIn the USA, the title of âSenior Registrarâ might be applied to a Senior or\nChief Resident in Surgery.\n\nThe senior registrar post still exists in Australia.\n","linknr":90,"url":"Senior_registrar","recorded":1374855193,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Senior_registrar&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Senior_registrar&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Senior_registrar&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/Physician","/wiki/United_Kingdom","/wiki/Ireland","/wiki/Consultant_(medicine)","/wiki/Specialist_registrar","/wiki/National_Health_Service","/wiki/General_Medical_Council","/wiki/Senior_House_Officer","/wiki/Registrar","//toolserver.org/%7Edispenser/cgi-bin/dab_solver.py?page=Senior_registrar&editintro=Template:Disambiguation_needed/editintro&client=Template:Dn","/wiki/Specialist_registrar","/wiki/Specialty_Registrar","/wiki/Australia","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Senior_registrar&oldid=437003286","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Medical_education_in_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Category:Healthcare_occupations_in_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Category:Articles_lacking_sources_from_December_2009","/wiki/Category:All_articles_lacking_sources","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_links_needing_disambiguation_from_June_2011","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Senior+registrar&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Senior+registrar","/wiki/Senior_registrar","/w/index.php?title=Talk:Senior_registrar&action=edit&redlink=1","#","/wiki/Senior_registrar","/w/index.php?title=Senior_registrar&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Senior_registrar&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Senior_registrar","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Senior_registrar","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Senior_registrar&oldid=437003286","/w/index.php?title=Senior_registrar&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Senior_registrar&id=437003286","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Senior+registrar","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Senior+registrar&oldid=437003286&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Senior_registrar&printable=yes","#","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_registrar","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":["medicine"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Medical
