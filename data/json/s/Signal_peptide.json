These proteins include those\nthat reside either inside certain organelles (the endoplasmic reticulum, golgi\nor endosomes), secreted from the cell, or inserted into most cellular membranes.\nAlthough most type I membrane-bound proteins have signal peptides, the majority\nof type II and multi-spanning membrane-bound proteins are targeted to the\nsecretory pathway by their first transmembrane domain, which biochemically\nresembles a signal sequence except that it is not cleaved.\n","linknr":352,"url":"Signal_peptide","recorded":1362486633,"links":24,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Gene expression","Protein targeting"],"headings":["Translocation","Signal Peptide Structure","Co-translational versus Post-translational Translocation","Nucleotide Level Features","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Amino_acid","Peptide","N-terminal_end","Proteins","Secretory_pathway","Endoplasmic_reticulum","Golgi","Endosomes","Transmembrane_protein","Transmembrane_domain","Prokaryotes","Plasma_membrane","Eukaryotes","Translocon","Signal_peptidase","Ribosome","Signal-recognition_particle","SRP_receptor","SecB","Chaperone_protein","SecA","TLOC1","SEC63","MRNA","Adenine","Sequence_motif","Exon","Protein_targeting","Target_peptide"]}
