{"cursor":"7990","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Setting up to fail' is a psychological manipulation performed on a target in\nwhich the target is given a task which is designed to fail as it has an\nunrealistic objective - \"the setting of impossible objectives... set up to\nfail\". Tim Field, Bully in Sight Success Unlimited (1996) p. 43 ISBN 978-0-9529121-0-\n1 The target will become stressed trying to achieve the impossible,\nparticularly if under pressure. Once the task attempt has failed, the outcome\ncan then be used as ammunition to discredit and blame the target. A variation on\nthis is that an otherwise achievable objective is covertly sabotaged and\nundermined to make it unachievable.\n\nThe same result may result unintentionally by way of a \"negative spiral of\nexpectations... the 'set-up-to-fail' syndrome\".
