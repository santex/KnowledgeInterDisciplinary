{"cursor":"41335","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n]] 'Semiotics', also called 'semiotic studies' and including (in the Saussurean\ntradition) 'semiology', is the study of signs and sign processes (semiosis),\nindication, designation, likeness, analogy, metaphor, symbolism, signification,\nand communication. Semiotics is closely related to the field of linguistics,\nwhich, for its part, studies the structure and meaning of language more\nspecifically. However, as different from linguistics, semiotics studies also non-\nlinguistic sign systems. Semiotics is often divided into three branches:\n* '[[Semantics]]': Relation between signs and the things to which they refer;\n  their denotata, or meaning\n* '[[Syntax|Syntactics]]': Relations among signs in formal structures\n* '[[Pragmatics]]': Relation between signs and the effects they have on the\n  people who use them\n\nSemiotics is frequently seen as having important anthropological dimensions; for\nexample, Umberto Eco proposes that every cultural phenomenon can be studied as\ncommunication. However, some semioticians focus on the\nlogical dimensions of the science. They examine areas belonging also to the\nnatural sciences â such as how organisms make predictions about, and adapt to,\ntheir semiotic niche in the world (see semiosis). In general, semiotic theories\ntake signs or sign systems as their object of study: the communication of\ninformation in living organisms is covered in biosemiotics (including\nzoosemiotics).\n\nSyntactics is the branch of semiotics that deals with the formal properties of\nsigns and symbols. The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language:\n[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/syntactics Syntactics] More precisely,\nsyntactics deals with the \"rules that govern how words are combined to form\nphrases and sentences.\" [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/syntax\nWiktionary.org] Charles Morris adds that semantics deals with the relation\nof signs to their designata and the objects which they may or do denote; and,\npragmatics deals with the biotic aspects of semiosis, that is, with all the\npsychological, biological, and sociological phenomena which occur in the\nfunctioning of signs.\n","linknr":758,"url":"Semiotics","recorded":1362480879,"links":86,"instances":["semiotics","semiotics","semiotics","semiotics","semiotics","linguistics","peirce","norm","critic","semiotics","gregorian_chant","semiotics","linguist","semiotics","semiotics"],"pdf":["http://menchik.com/Menchik_Tian_AJS.pdf"],"categories":["Cybernetics","Semiotics|*","Philosophy
