The terms 'fragrance' and 'aroma' are used primarily by the\nfood and cosmetic industry to describe a pleasant odor, and are sometimes used\nto refer to perfumes. In contrast, 'malodor', 'stench', 'reek', and 'stink' are\nused specifically to describe unpleasant odor.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, odour refers to scents in general. In the United States,\nodor has a more negative connotation, such as smell, stench or stink, while\nscent or aroma are used for pleasant smells.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Scent","recorded":1372152446,"links":[],"instances":["science","physiology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Olfaction","Odor","Qualia"],"headings":["Basics","Measurement","In the indoor environment","Legislative provisions","Adsorption as separating process","Types","Behavioral cues","See also","Notes","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["stimulus","physiology"],["objectivity","science"]],"members":["objectivity","stimulus"],"related":["Museo_del_Prado","Chemical_compound","Sense","Olfaction","Perfume","United_Kingdom","Olfactory_nerve","Neuron","Nasal_cavity","Cilia","Axon","Kenneth_S._Suslick","Lewis_acids_and_bases","Robert_H._Crabtree","Olfactory_bulb","Limbic_system","Organic_compound","Hydrogen_sulfide","Ammonia","Stimulus_(physiology)","Objectivity_(science)","Analytical_technique","Perceptions","Gender","Body_odor","Ingredient","Flavorist","Perfumer","Musk","Putrid","Pungent","Camphoraceous","Essential_oil","Floral","Peppermint","Germany","Butan-1-ol","Gas_chromatography","Olfactometer","European_Committee_for_Standardization","Odor_threshold","N-Butanol","Journal_of_the_Air_&_Waste_Management_Association","Teflon","Hedonic","Unpleasant","Pleasant","Wind_tunnel","Biofilter","Throat_irritation","Volatile_organic_compounds","Germany","Defensive_wall","Atmosphere","Adsorption","Molecule","Physisorption","Chemisorption","Chemical_bonds","Statistical_fluctuations","Electrons","Dipole","Solid","Reversible_reaction","Energy","Heterogeneous_catalysis","Adsorption","Heat_of_adsorption","Enthalpy","Adsorbate","Deodorant","Limbic_system","Aromatherapy","Anecdotal_evidence","Science","Anaphylactic_shock","Unpleasant","Body_odor","Perspiration","Sewage_treatment","Refinery","Body_odor","Olfactory_system","Bee","Vapor_pressure","Angewandte_Chemie_International_Edition","Aldehyde","Nonanal","Ketone","1-Octen-3-one","Ferrous","Pheromone","Moth","Honeybee","Beehive","Electronic_nose","Chemical_sensors","Multivariate_analysis","Neural_network","Temperature","Humidity","Kenneth_S._Suslick","Body_odor","Homosexuality","Heterosexuality","Sexual_orientation","Aroma_compound","Machine_olfaction","Olfaction","Olfactometer","Olfactory_fatigue","Phantosmia","Scented_water"]}
