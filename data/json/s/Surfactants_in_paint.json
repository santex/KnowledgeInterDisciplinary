{"cursor":"13458","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nPaint has four major components: pigments, binders, solvents, and other\nadditives. Pigments serve to give paint its color, texture, toughness, as well\nas determining if a paint is opaque or not. Common white pigments include\ntitanium dioxide TiO 2 and zinc oxide ZnO. Binders are the film that\nforms as a paint dries and they affect the durability, gloss, and flexibility of\nthe coating. Polyurethanes, polyesters, and acrylics are all examples of common\nbinders. The solvent helps adjust the curing rate and viscosity of the paint in\nits liquid state. The solvent evaporates off as the paint dries. There are two\ntypes of solvents: solvent-borne and water-borne. The additives that are\nincorporated into paints are a wide range of things which help to effect the\nproperties of the paint and the final coating. The main additives added to many\npaints are surfactants.\n\nThe word surfactant is short for surface active agent. Surfactants are compounds that lower the surface tension of a liquid,\nthe interfacial tension between two liquids, or the interfacial tension between\na liquid and a solid. In solutions this behavior is known as wetting, and it\noccurs as a result of surfactants adsorbing to the air/water\ninterface. Soluble surfactants are also capable of forming micelles\nand other aggregate structures in solution, leading to a stabilizing effect in\nlatex paints. Surfactants in paint are used to change many end properties of a\ndried paint, as well as to emulsify paints in their liquid state.\n","linknr":180,"url":"Surfactants_in_paint","recorded":1362512443,"links":13,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Surfactants"],"headings":["Role of surfactants in paint","Classification of surfactants","Problems with surfactant use","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/62/Latexemulsion.png/250px-Latexemulsion.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/d/a/4/da43f41cd0f6feeec23466672de4d280.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/2/3/f/23faa386f818309dd679b05efa8331ca.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/SDS_surfactant.png/350px-SDS_surfactant.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/45/Siloxanechain.png/220px-Siloxanechain.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Paint","Pigments","Solvents","Pigments","Titanium_dioxide","Zinc_oxide","Solvent","Surfactants","Wetting","Micelles","Macroemulsion","Sulfates","Amines","Ammonium","Fatty_acids","Glycols"]}
