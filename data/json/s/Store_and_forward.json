{"cursor":"3163","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Store and forward' is a telecommunications technique in which information is\nsent to an intermediate station where it is kept and sent at a later time to the\nfinal destination or to another intermediate station. The intermediate station,\nor node in a networking context, verifies the integrity of the message before\nforwarding it. In general, this technique is used in networks with intermittent\nconnectivity, especially in the wilderness or environments requiring high\nmobility. It may also be preferable in situations when there are long delays in\ntransmission and variable and high error rates, or if a direct, end-to-end\nconnection is not available.\n\nThis technique originates the delay-tolerant networks. No real-time services are\navailable for these kinds of networks.\n","linknr":113,"url":"Store_and_forward","recorded":1362575669,"links":17,"instances":["networking"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Network protocols"],"headings":["Manually operated relay","Automatic relay","UUCP","See also","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["node","networking"]],"members":["node"],"related":["Telecommunications","Information","Node_(networking)","Computer_network","Data_integrity","Delay-tolerant_networking","Teleprinter","Paper_tape","Tape_relay","United_States_military","Plan_55-A","Paper_tape","Internet","Packet_switching","Cut-through_switching","Delay-tolerant_networking","Email_forwarding","FidoNet","Fragment_free","Hop-by-hop_transport","Internet_fax","Network_switch","Packet_radio","Stofor","Store_and_forward_delay","Store-and-forward_switching_center","Wormhole_routing"]}
