It occupies all of the space behind an opaque object\nwith light in front of it. The cross section of a shadow is a two-dimensional\nsilhouette, or reverse projection of the object blocking the light. The sun\ncauses many objects to have shadows and at certain times of the day, when the\nsun is at certain heights, the lengths of shadows change.\n\nAn astronomical object casts human-visible shadows when its apparent magnitude\nis equal or lower than âˆ’4.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20070627044109/http:-\n//www.gsfc.nasa.gov/scienceques2005/20060406.htm NASA Science Question of the\nWeek].
