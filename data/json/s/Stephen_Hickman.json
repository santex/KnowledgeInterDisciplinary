{"cursor":"6828","size":14,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Stephen Hickman' (born April 9, 1949) is an award-winning American artist,\nillustrator, sculptor and author. He is best known for his work in science\nfiction and fantasy with over 350 book and magazine covers to his credit. His\nefforts have brought an extra dimension to the stories of Robert A. Heinlein, H.\nP. Lovecraft, J. R. R. Tolkien, Anne McCaffrey, and Andre Norton. He\nmay be best known for illustrating Larry Niven's Man-Kzin Wars novels and the\nevocative dragons he created for Steven Brust's Dragaeran series, which have\noften been imitated. His most widely circulated effort is a series of space\nfantasy postage stamps done for the United States Postal Service.\n\nHickman has mastered a variety of styles and is known for his versatility.\nHowever, his work is especially notable for two features. His use of the\npossibilities of oil color, in layers both transparent and translucent, is\nbalanced to create subtle moods that can range for the contemplative to the\nunsettling. Frank Kelly Freas said that no one since Rembrandt has mastered the\nuse of gold the way Hickman has.\n\nAnother consistent feature of Hickman's work is the intelligence of his\ncharacters, especially the women. The faces of Hickman's subjects are fully\nengaged in thought, sometimes absorbed in a dream, sometimes on the verge of a\nclimactic \"aha.\" This characteristic might best be compared to that of another\nDutch painter, Vermeer.\n\nHickman says the most difficult thing to capture in art is the sublime, likening\nit to 'catching the gold ring on the artistic carousel'. He strives to create a\npositive, reassuring effect in his viewers by communicating beauty and elegance.\n\"Besides, the elegant and sublime have a certain shock value in the present\nage.\" His style is classically based and often, as he puts it, with \"a strong\nvision quest aspect.\"\n\nStephen Hickman was born in Washington, DC, the son of John F. and Mary Lee\nHickman. Because his father was in the foreign service, he was already a world\ntraveler before high school, having lived in Manila and Karachi. He also lived\nin Texas and Arizona before his family returned to the Washington area, settling\nin Alexandria Virginia. Hickman's father regularly told him tales, from ghost\nstories to his own childhood experiences in the Philippine Islands, and Hickman\ncredits him with inspired his interest in literature and writing. Hickman's\nmother introduced him to painting and encouraged him to be original in all\nthings. Both parents were supportive of his creative endeavors.\n\nIn Alexandria, Hickman went to Francis Hammond High School. The art program was\ndirected by Fletcher Proctor, who later was responsible for art in the whole\nschool district. Between regular and summer sessions, Hickman had the\nequivalent of eight years of training in art from Proctor, what he considered\nto be all of useful training he had for his profession. After graduating high\nschool, Hickman spent two years at Richmond Professional Institute (now part of\nVirginia Commonwealth University) where he shared classes with Mike Kaluta and\nPhil Trumbo.\n\nA turning point for Hickmanâs career was when he went to the 1967 NY Comic\nConvention. There he met Frank Frazetta and Roy G. Krenkel. He found that both\nmen were thoughtful and helpful. He got advice that included mastering artistic\nanatomy, with special attention to the skeleton. They advised him to spend the\nmoney on decent brushes. The conventional was also eye-opening for him because\nhe got to see original painting after years of only knowing the artists through\npaperback covers.\n\nHickman's professional career was launched in 1972 when he got a job creating\nT-shirt designs for Shirt Explosion in Lanham, MD. In this situation where\nHickman was given virtually unlimited artistic freedom, he realized that he\ncould earn a living by doing what he wanted to. His entry into book illustration\ncame in 1974, when Neil Adams of Continuity Studios, NYC, introduced Hickman to\nCharles Volpe, Art Editor at Ace Books. Volpe bought the printing rights of\nitems from his portfolio, and later commissioning paintings which were used for\nreprints of Ace Doubles in the Classics of Science-Fiction series. Since then he\nhas been a full-time artist. Some of his work has been collected in The Fantasy\nArt of Stephen Hickman. He has been honored with a Hugo Award (1993, for\nAchievement in Science Fiction and Fantasy), five Chesley Awards and two gold\nawards from the Spectrum Anthology.\n\nHickman has tried his hand at writing and illustrating his own work. His novel,\nThe [[Lemuria (continent)|Lemuria]]n Stone, was published in 1988. In this work,\nhe created the Pharazar Mythos, which has been the basis for several major\npaintings, including The Lion Pavilion and The Astronomer Prince. His work has\nalso motivated other writers. Most notably, The Diver and Mermaid, done as a\nprivate commission, inspired Harlan Ellison to write \"Midnight in the Sunken\nCathedral.\"\n","linknr":132,"url":"Stephen_Hickman","recorded":1375088787,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Stephen_Hickman&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Stephen_Hickman&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Biographies_of_living_persons","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability","/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources","/wiki/Defamation","/wiki/Science_fiction","/wiki/Fantasy","/wiki/Robert_A._Heinlein","/wiki/H._P._Lovecraft","/wiki/J._R._R._Tolkien","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Anne_McCaffrey","/wiki/Andre_Norton","/wiki/Larry_Niven","/wiki/Man-Kzin_Wars","/wiki/Steven_Brust","/w/index.php?title=Dragaeran&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/United_States_Postal_Service","/wiki/Frank_Kelly_Freas","/wiki/Rembrandt","/wiki/Vermeer","/wiki/Vision_quest","/wiki/Washington,_DC","/wiki/Mike_Kaluta","/wiki/Frank_Frazetta","/wiki/Roy_G._Krenkel","/wiki/Hugo_Award","/wiki/Chesley_Awards","/wiki/Lemuria_(continent)","/wiki/Harlan_Ellison","/w/index.php?title=Stephen_Hickman&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Barrayar","/wiki/Lois_McMaster_Bujold","/wiki/Man-Kzin_Wars","/wiki/Amber_Diceless_Roleplaying_Game","/wiki/The_Ship_Who_Searched","/wiki/Jhereg_(novel)","/w/index.php?title=Stephen_Hickman&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-1","http://books.google.com/books?id=eHAyr784pREC&pg=PA169&dq=%22Stephen+Hickman%22&hl=en&ei=AfAQTOrHCZCSNqTqvPkC&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=7&ved=0CEsQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=%22Stephen%20Hickman%22&f=false","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Special:BookSources/1-56414-702-9,_9781564147028","/wiki/Help:CS1_errors#bad_isbn","/w/index.php?title=Stephen_Hickman&action=edit&section=3","http://www.stephenhickman.com/","http://www.graphicclassics.com/pgs/hickman.htm","http://www.artcyclopedia.com/artists/hickman_stephen.html","http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/ea.cgi?Stephen_Hickman","/wiki/Internet_Speculative_Fiction_Database","http://www.insideyourart.com/artists/Stephen-Hickman","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/16327329","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","/wiki/Washington,_DC","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Stephen_Hickman&oldid=544304050","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1949_births","/wiki/Category:Living_people","/wiki/Category:Science_fiction_artists","/wiki/Category:Fantasy_artists","/wiki/Category:Hugo_Award_winning_artists","/wiki/Category:Pages_with_ISBN_errors","/wiki/Category:BLP_articles_lacking_sources_from_June_2010","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Stephen+Hickman&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Stephen+Hickman","/wiki/Stephen_Hickman","/wiki/Talk:Stephen_Hickman","#","/wiki/Stephen_Hickman","/w/index.php?title=Stephen_Hickman&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Stephen_Hickman&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Stephen_Hickman","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Stephen_Hickman","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Stephen_Hickman&oldid=544304050","/w/index.php?title=Stephen_Hickman&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3498575","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Stephen_Hickman&id=544304050","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Stephen+Hickman","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Stephen+Hickman&oldid=544304050&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Stephen_Hickman&printable=yes","//fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Hic
