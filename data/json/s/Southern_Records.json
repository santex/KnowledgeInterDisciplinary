It is based in London and\npreviously had offices in Chicago (closed November 2008), Le Havre (closed July\n2009) and Berlin (closed December 2008).\n\nSouthern was originally a recording studio owned and operated by John Loder.\nLoder became friends with musician, author and poet Penny Rimbaud and\ncollaborated with him and others in an experimental progressive band called\nEXIT. Rimbaud later formed anarchist punk band Crass and Southern Studios and\nJohn Loder were the obvious choice of venue for the recording of their first\nalbum [[The Feeding of the 5000 (album)|The Feeding of the 5000]], originally\nreleased on Small Wonder Records. When Small Wonder encountered problems\nmanufacturing the release, due to the allegedly blasphemous nature of some of\nthe lyrics, Crass determined they would need to start their own label to take\nfull responsibility and control of their output. Loder facilitated this by\nacting as the business manager behind the label: arranging manufacture,\ndistribution and accounting.
