However, lacking any such nuclei, the liquid phase can be maintained all\nthe way down to the temperature at which crystal homogeneous nucleation occurs.\nHomogeneous nucleation can occur above the glass transition temperature, but if\nhomogenous nucleation has not occurred above that temperature an amorphous (non-\ncrystalline) solid will form.\n\nWater normally freezes at 273.15 K (0 Â°C or 32 Â°F) however it can\nalso be \"supercooled\" at standard pressure down to its crystal homogeneous\nnucleation at almost 224.8 K (â48.3 Â°C/â55 Â°F).  The process of supercooling requires that water be\npure and free of nucleation sites, which can be achieved by processes like\nreverse osmosis, but the cooling itself does not require any specialised\ntechnique. If water is cooled at a rate on the order of 10 6 K/s,\nthe crystal nucleation can be avoided and water becomes a glass. Its glass\ntransition temperature is much colder and harder to determine, but studies\nestimate it at about 165 K (â108 Â°C/â162.4 Â°F). .\nGlassy water can be heated up to approximately 150 K\n(â123 Â°C/â189.4 Â°F). In the range of\ntemperatures between 231 K (â42 Â°C/â43.6 Â°F) and 150 K\n(â123 Â°C/â189.4 Â°F) experiments find only crystal ice.\n\nDroplets of supercooled water often exist in stratiform and cumulus clouds.\nAircraft flying through these clouds seed an abrupt crystallization of these\ndroplets, which can result in the formation of ice on the aircraft's wings\nor blockage of its instruments and probes, unless the aircraft are equipped\nwith an appropriate de-icing system. Freezing rain is also caused by\nsupercooled droplets.\n\nThe process opposite to supercooling, the melting of a solid above the freezing\npoint, is much more difficult, and a solid will almost always melt at the same\ntemperature for a given pressure. For this reason, it is the melting point which\nis usually identified, using melting point apparatus; even when the subject of a\npaper is \"freezing-point determination\", the actual methodology is \"the\nprinciple of observing the disappearance rather than the formation of\nice\". \"[http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/reprint/26/1/57.pdf A new method of\nfreezing-point determination for small quantities]\", J. A. Ramsay, [[J. Exp.\nBiol.]].1949; 26 It is, however, possible, at a given pressure to\nsuperheat a liquid above its boiling point without it becoming gaseous.\n\nSupercooling is often confused with freezing-point depression. Supercooling is\nthe cooling of a liquid below its freezing point without it becoming solid.\nFreezing point depression is when a solution can be cooled below the freezing\npoint of the corresponding pure liquid due to the presence of the solute; an\nexample of this is the freezing point depression that occurs when sodium\nchloride is added to pure water.\n","linknr":412,"url":"Supercooled","recorded":1362481810,"links":44,"instances":["beverage","soft_drink","matter","unit"],"pdf":["http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/reprint/26/1/57.pdf"],"categories":["Thermodynamic processes","Condensed matter physics","Concepts in physics","Glass physics"],"headings":["Constitutional supercooling","In plants","In fish","Applications","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/Constitutional_supercooling_-_phase_diagram%2C_concentration%2C_and_temperature.png/220px-Constitutional_supercooling_-_phase_diagram%2C_concentration%2C_and_temperature.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/2/d/82d6211b48ff4aa96cc01b5f4ec56a7e.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/a/3/2/a326cee0dc19fd857172e8147e7439d8.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/6/5/7/65718571a514b068c09b393c56639c66.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/c/e/5/ce5bc3b442f9fad08a881607fd544af6.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/6/f/e/6fe658895f1377bd7093fa7fedd8218c.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/1/7/9/17988af054ce54579480d3e53e9a559e.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/d/5/7d515590b2aef037b7a95f689f9fc369.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/a/5/4/a5444cad08ec228386c9a0cd67e9e6ea.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/1/6/4/1643456624f786b7f30adb2a11c8d215.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0b/Phase_change_-_en.svg/300px-Phase_change_-_en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["phase","matter"],["osmole","unit"],["sprite","soft_drink"],["slush","beverage"]],"members":["slush","sprite","phase","osmole"],"related":["Liquid","Gas","Melting_point","Solid","Crystallization_process","Nucleation","Crystal","Seed_crystal","Phase_(matter)","Glass_transition_temperature","Amorphous","Water","Kelvin","Standard_pressure","Nucleation","Reverse_osmosis","Glass_transition_temperature","Amorphous_ice","Stratus_cloud","Cumulus_cloud","Cloud","Aircraft","Aircraft","De-icing","Freezing_rain","Temperature","Pressure","Melting_point_apparatus","Superheating","Boiling_point","Freezing-point_depression","Solution","Solution","Sodium_chloride","Solid–liquid_interface","Liquidus","Cytosol","Vacuole","Antifreeze_protein","Body_fluid","Teleostei","Osmole_(unit)","Refrigeration","The_Coca-Cola_Company","Sprite_(soft_drink)","Slush_(beverage)","Amorphous_solid","Pumpable_ice_technology","Subcooling","Ultracold_atom","Viscous_liquid"]}
