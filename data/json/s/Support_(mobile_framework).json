It is shown that such\nprotocols can be designed to work correctly and efficiently for communication by\navoiding message flooding. The protocols manage to establish communication\nbetween any pair of mobile hosts in small, a-priori guaranteed expected time\nbounds. Theoretical analytical results exploit and further develop some\nfundamental properties of random walks in finite graph.\n\nApart from studying the general case of mobile ad-hoc networks, the framework\ninvestigates two practical and interesting cases of ad-hoc mobile networks:\n* hierarchical ad-hoc networks,\n* highly changing ad-hoc networks, for which specific protocols are proposed\n  that efficiently deal with the problem of basic communication.\n","linknr":158,"url":"Support_(mobile_framework)","recorded":1362535171,"links":30,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://ru1.cti.gr/~ichatz/pub/jpdc03ichatz.pdf","http://ru1.cti.gr/~ichatz/pub/monet04ichatz.pdf","http://ru1.cti.gr/~ichatz/pub/wmc04ichatz.pdf","http://ru1.cti.gr/~ichatz/pub/wae00ichatz.pdf","http://ru1.cti.gr/~ichatz/pub/wae01ichatz.pdf","http://ru1.cti.gr/~ichatz/pub/podc01ichatz.pdf","http://ru1.cti.gr/~ichatz/pub/pomc01ichatz.pdf","http://ru1.cti.gr/~ichatz/pub/disc01ichatz.pdf","http://ru1.cti.gr/~ichatz/pub/pci01ichatz.pdf","http://ru1.cti.gr/~ichatz/pub/12-IWNMC-04.pdf","http://ru1.cti.gr/~ichatz/pub/mascots04ichatz.pdf","http://ru1.cti.gr/~ichatz/pub/icon04ichatz.pdf"],"categories":["Wireless networking"],"headings":["List of journal publications","List of conference publications"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/6c/Wiki_letter_w.svg/40px-Wiki_letter_w.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Wireless_network","Topology","Communications_protocol","Computer_network","Ad-hoc_network","Paul_Spirakis","Paul_Spirakis","Saarbr√ºcken","Springer_Science+Business_Media","Paul_Spirakis","IEEE","Association_for_Computing_Machinery","Hyatt_Regency_San_Francisco","Paul_Spirakis","University_of_Aarhus","Denmark","Springer_Science+Business_Media","Paul_Spirakis","Rhode_Island","Paul_Spirakis","Rhode_Island","Paul_Spirakis","University_of_Lisbon","Portugal","Springer_Science+Business_Media","Paul_Spirakis","Cyprus","IEEE","Association_for_Computing_Machinery","Fort_Lauderdale","Florida","Netherlands","Singapore"]}
