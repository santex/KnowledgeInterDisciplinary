A system model is required to describe and represent all these\nmultiple views.\n\nThe system model describes and represents the multiple views possibly using two\ndifferent approaches. The first one is the non-architectural approach and the\nsecond one is the architectural approach.\n\nThe non-architectural approach respectively picks a model for each view. For\nexample, Structured Systems Analysis and Design Method (SSADM), picking the\nStructure Chart (SC) for structure description and the Data Flow Diagram (DFD)\nfor behavior description, is categorized into the non-architectural approach.\n\nThe architectural approach, instead of picking many heterogeneous and\nunrelated models, will use only one single coalescence model. For example,\nSystem architecture, using the Architecture Description Language (ADL) for\nboth structure and behavior descriptions, is categorized into the\narchitectural approach.\n","linknr":98,"url":"System_model","recorded":1362476911,"links":14,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Systems analysis"],"headings":["See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Conceptual_model","System","View_model","Planning","Requirement_analysis","Design","Implementation","System_deployment","Structure","Behavior","Input/output","Structured_Systems_Analysis_and_Design_Method","Structure_Chart","Data_Flow_Diagram","System_architecture","Architecture_Description_Language","Community_Climate_System_Model","Human_visual_system_model","Internal_Family_Systems_Model","Solar_system_model","Viable_System_Model"]}
