The family includes about 51 species\n(one extinct) in 8 genera, all marine and found worldwide in shallow waters.\n\nIn addition to the top-mounted eyes, stargazers also have a large upward-facing\nmouth in a large head. Their usual habit is to bury themselves in sand, and leap\nupwards to ambush prey (benthic fish and invertebrates) that pass overhead. Some\nspecies have a worm-shaped lure growing out of the floor of the mouth, which\nthey can wiggle to attract prey's attention. Both the dorsal and anal fins are\nrelatively long; some lack dorsal spines. Lengths range from 18&nbsp;cm up to\n90&nbsp;cm, for the giant stargazer Kathetostoma giganteum.\n\nStargazers are venomous; they have two large poison spines situated behind the\nopercle and above the pectoral fins. The species within the genera\n[[Astroscopus]] and [[Uranoscopus]] can also cause electric shocks. The species\nwithin [[Astroscopus]] have an electric organ consisting of modified eye\nmuscles, while the species within [[Uranoscopus]] have theirs derived from sonic\nmuscles.<ref></ref> They are one of the few (the other being the striped\ncatfish<ref></ref>) marine bony fishes that are electrogenic. The two genera\nwithin stargazers are out of eight total independent evolutions of\nbioelectrogenesis.<ref></ref> They are also unique among electric fish in not\npossessing specialized electroreceptors.<ref name=Alves-Gomes></ref>\n",
