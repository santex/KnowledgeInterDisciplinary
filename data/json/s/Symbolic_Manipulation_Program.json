Cole and Stephen Wolfram at Caltech circa 1979 and\ninitially developed in the Caltech physics department under Wolfram's leadership\nwith contributions from Geoffrey C. Fox, Jeffrey M. Greif, Eric D. Mjolsness,\nLarry J. Romans, Timothy Shaw, and Anthony E. Terrano. It was first sold\ncommercially in 1981 by the Computer Mathematics Corporation of Los Angeles\nwhich later became part of Inference Corporation; Inference Corp. further\ndeveloped the program and marketed it commercially from 1983 to 1988. SMP was\nessentially Version Zero of the more ambitious Mathematica system.\n\nSMP was influenced by the earlier computer algebra systems Macsyma (of which\nWolfram was a user) and Schoonschip (whose code Wolfram\nstudied [http://www.ddj.com/184406157 \"Is Cyberspace Dead?\" by Michael\nSwaine, July 01, 2005.] ).\n","linknr":100,"url":"Symbolic_Manipulation_Program","recorded":1362574581,"links":13,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Computer algebra systems"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/LampFlowchart.svg/22px-LampFlowchart.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Computer_algebra_system","Chris_A._Cole","Stephen_Wolfram","Caltech","Geoffrey_Charles_Fox","Los_Angeles","Inference_Corporation","Mathematica","Macsyma","Schoonschip","Chris_A._Cole","Stephen_Wolfram","SIGSAM","Stephen_Wolfram","Chris_A._Cole","Stephen_Wolfram"]}
