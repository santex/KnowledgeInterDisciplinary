The core game engine is\nlicensed under the GNU GPL.\n\nVarious games http://springrts.com/wiki/Games leveraging the Spring\nengine range from free content games with minimal restrictions on use and\ndistribution to games with commercially licensed art, such as P.U.R.E. [http://wolfegames.com/gpl.htm\nhttp://wolfegames.com] P.U.R.E - Powered by the GPL Additionally, content\nfrom Total Annihilation has been modified to run on the Spring Engine, although\nplaying games that incorporate such content requires that one own a copy of the\noriginal Total Annihilation game.\n\nSpring is being developed by the engine's community since 2005. The project has\nsurpassed its initial goal to have the game run the mods and third-party units\nfrom Total Annihilation, and has evolved into a more general RTS engine. Most of\nthe games running on the engine (as of December 2010) are focused on multiplayer\ngameplay. There are also currently a number of single player missions, built on\nframeworks utilizing the engine's Lua scripting capabilities. There are also a\nlarge number of skirmish AIs, allowing for offline play or extra players in an\nonline game.\n","linknr":391,"url":"Spring_(game_engine)","recorded":1362575370,"links":33,"instances":["programming_language","programming_language","gaming","programming_language","programming_language","computer_game","programming_language","programming_language"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Total Annihilation","Fangames","Real-time strategy video games","Free game engines","Lua-scriptable game engines","Free, open source strategy games","Windows games","Linux games","2006 video games","Free software programmed in C++","Lua-scripted video games","Video game mods"],"headings":["Engine","Games","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/Spring-Logo.png/100px-Spring-Logo.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0a/KernelPanic.jpg/220px-KernelPanic.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/Chess.svg/28px-Chess.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c1/Computer-aj_aj_ashton_01.svg/28px-Computer-aj_aj_ashton_01.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["lua","programming_language"],["lua","programming_language"],["c","programming_language"],["c++","programming_language"],["python","programming_language"],["java","programming_language"],["groovy","programming_language"],["java","programming_language"],["python","programming_language"],["darwinia","computer_game"],["lua","programming_language"],["rts","gaming"]],"members":["groovy","python","rts","java","c","darwinia","lua"],"related":["Cross-platform","C++","Lua_(programming_language)","Game_engine","GNU_General_Public_License","Free_software","Open_source_software","Real-time_strategy","Game_engine","3D_computer_graphics","High-level_programming_language","Extensibility","Lua_programming_language","GNU_GPL","Free_content","Third-party_software_component","Multiplayer","Lua_programming_language","Artificial_intelligence","Linux","Microsoft_Windows","Internet_Relay_Chat","Lua_(programming_language)","C_(programming_language)","C++_(programming_language)","Python_(programming_language)","JVM_Languages","Java_(programming_language)","Groovy_(programming_language)","User_interface","Source_code","GNU_General_Public_License","C++","Programming_language","Delphi_programming_language","Java_(programming_language)","Python_(programming_language)","Doxygen","Integrated_development_environment","CMake","KDevelop","Microsoft_Visual_C++","Xcode","Galactic_Civil_War","Darwinia_(computer_game)","Cavedog_Entertainment","Lua_(programming_language)","RTS_(gaming)","Technology_tree","Second_World_War","USA","United_Kingdom","Nazi_Germany","USSR","Total_Annihilation"]}
