A\nstate with an official religion, while not secular, is not necessarily a\ntheocracy.\n\nThe term [[state church]] is associated with Christianity, historically the\nstate church of the Roman Empire, and is sometimes used to denote a specific\nmodern national branch of Christianity. Closely related to state churches are\nwhat sociologists call ecclesiae, though the two are slightly different.\n\nState religions are official or government-sanctioned establishments of a\nreligion, but neither does the state need be under the control of the church (as\nin a theocracy), nor is the state-sanctioned church necessarily under the\ncontrol of the state.\n\nThe institution of state-sponsored religious cults is ancient, reaching into the\nAncient Near East and prehistory. The relation of religious cult and the state\nwas discussed by Varro, under the term of [[theologia civilis]] (\"civic\ntheology\"). The first state-sponsored Christian church was the Armenian\nApostolic Church, established in 301 AD.
