[http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue-\n_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=39064 ISO/IEC 14764:2006 Software Engineering\nâ Software Life Cycle Processes â Maintenance]\n\nA common perception of maintenance is that it merely involves fixing defects.\nHowever, one study indicated that the majority, over 80%, of the maintenance\neffort is used for non-corrective actions (Pigosky 1997). This perception is\nperpetuated by users submitting problem reports that in reality are\nfunctionality enhancements to the system.\n\nSoftware maintenance and evolution of systems was first addressed by Meir M.\nLehman in 1969. Over a period of twenty years, his research led to the\nformulation of Lehman's Laws (Lehman 1997). Key findings of his research include\nthat maintenance is really evolutionary development and that maintenance\ndecisions are aided by understanding what happens to systems (and software) over\ntime. Lehman demonstrated that systems continue to evolve over time. As they\nevolve, they grow more complex unless some action such as code refactoring is\ntaken to reduce the complexity.\n\nThe key software maintenance issues are both managerial and technical. Key\nmanagement issues are: alignment with customer priorities, staffing, which\norganization does maintenance, estimating costs. Key technical issues are:\nlimited understanding, impact analysis, testing, maintainability measurement.\n","linknr":403,"url":"Software_maintenance","recorded":1362667644,"links":38,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.compaid.com/caiinternet/ezine/capersjones-maintenance.pdf","http://sce.uhcl.edu/helm/SWEBOK_IEEE/data/swebok_chapter_06.pdf","http://sce.uhcl.edu/helm/SWEBOK_IEEE/data/swebok_chapter_06.pdf"],"categories":["Software maintenance|*"],"headings":["See also","The importance of software maintenance","Software maintenance planning","Software maintenance processes","Categories of maintenance in ISO/IEC 14764","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/64/Coding_Shots_Annual_Plan_high_res-5.jpg/220px-Coding_Shots_Annual_Plan_high_res-5.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/12px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Software_engineering","Software_bug","Software_evolution","Meir_M._Lehman","Code_refactoring","Change_impact_analysis","Life-cycle_cost","DBMS","Operating_system","Software_migration","Service_Level_Agreement","Maintainability","Software_maintainer","Software_archaeology","Software_development","Computer_software","Search_Based_Software_Engineering","DOUA"]}
