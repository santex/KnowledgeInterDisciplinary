It works to uncover all the structures that\nunderlie all the things that humans do, think, perceive, and feel.\nAlternately, as summarized by philosopher Simon Blackburn, Structuralism is\n\"the belief that phenomena of human life are not intelligible except through\ntheir interrelations. These relations constitute a structure, and behind\nlocal variations in the surface phenomena there are constant laws of\nabstract culture\". Blackburn, Simon (2008).

In the late 1950s and early '60s, when\nstructural linguistics was facing serious challenges from the likes of Noam\nChomsky and thus fading in importance, an array of scholars in the humanities\nborrowed Saussure's concepts for use in their respective fields of study. French\nanthropologist Claude LÃ©vi-Strauss was arguably the first such scholar, sparking\na widespread interest in Structuralism.\n\nThe structuralist mode of reasoning has been applied in a diverse range of\nfields, including anthropology, sociology, psychology, literary criticism,\neconomics and architecture. The most prominent thinkers associated with\nstructuralism include LÃ©vi-Strauss, linguist Roman Jakobson, and psychoanalyst\nJacques Lacan. As an intellectual movement, structuralism was initially presumed\nto be the heir apparent to existentialism. However, by the late 1960s, many of\nstructuralism's basic tenets came under attack from a new wave of predominantly\nFrench intellectuals such as the philosopher and historian Michel Foucault, the\nphilosopher and social commentator Jacques Derrida, the Marxist philosopher\nLouis Althusser, and the literary critic Roland Barthes. Though\nelements of their work necessarily relate to structuralism and are informed by\nit, these theorists have generally been referred to as post-structuralists.\n\nIn the 1970s, structuralism was criticised for its rigidity and ahistoricism.\nDespite this, many of structuralism's proponents, such as Jacques Lacan,\ncontinue to assert an influence on continental philosophy and many of the\nfundamental assumptions of some of structuralism's post-structuralist critics\nare a continuation of structuralism.
