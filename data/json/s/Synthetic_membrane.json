{"cursor":"13885","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nAn 'artificial membrane', or 'synthetic membrane', is a synthetically created\nmembrane which is usually intended for separation purposes in laboratory or in\nindustry. Synthetic membranes have been successfully used for small and large-\nscale industrial processes since the middle of twentieth century. Pinnau, I., Freeman, B.D., Membrane Formation and Modification, ACS,\n1999. A wide variety of synthetic membranes is known. Osada,\nY., Nakagawa, T., Membrane Science and Technology, New York: Marcel Dekker,\nInc,1992. They can be produced from organic materials such as polymers and\nliquids, as well as inorganic materials. The most of commercially utilized\nsynthetic membranes in separation industry are made of polymeric structures.\nThey can be classified based on their surface chemistry, bulk structure,\nmorphology, and production method. The chemical and physical properties of\nsynthetic membranes and separated particles as well as a choice of driving force\ndefine a particular membrane separation process. The most commonly used driving\nforces of a membrane process in industry are pressure and concentration\ngradients. The respective membrane process is therefore known as filtration.\nSynthetic membranes utilized in a separation process can be of different\ngeometry and the respective flow configuration. They can be also categorized\nbased on their application and separation regime. The best known\nsynthetic membrane separation processes include water purification, reverse\nosmosis, dehydrogenation of natural gas, removal of cell particles by\nmicrofiltration and ultrafiltration, removal of microorganisms from dairy\nproducts, and dialysis.\n","linknr":247,"url":"Synthetic_membrane","recorded":1362371635,"links":24,"instances":["liquid_drop","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Chemical engineering|Artificial, Syntetic Membrane|date=December 2008","Filtration","Membrane technology"],"headings":["Membrane types and structure","Surface chemistry","Membrane morphology","See also","Notes","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/Polysulfone.svg/120px-Polysulfone.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c5/Polyethylene-repeat-2D.png/120px-Polyethylene-repeat-2D.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/17/Teflon_structure.PNG/120px-Teflon_structure.PNG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/Polypropylen.svg/120px-Polypropylen.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/Ceramic_membrane_%28crossflow_filtration%29.jpg/220px-Ceramic_membrane_%28crossflow_filtration%29.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e4/Contact_angle.svg/300px-Contact_angle.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/57/Wet_Leaf.jpg/220px-Wet_Leaf.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["morphology","biology"],["spray","liquid_drop"]],"members":["spray","morphology"],"related":["Organic_compound","Inorganic","Polymeric","Surface_chemistry","Morphology_(biology)","Pressure","Concentration_gradient","Filtration","Water_purification","Reverse_osmosis","Dehydrogenation","Microfiltration","Ultrafiltration","Dialysis","Metal","Ceramic","Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity","Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity","Aluminium","Silicon_carbide","Zirconium","Inert","Capillaries","Molten","Polymeric_membrane","Chemical_affinity","Stereoregularity","Chemical_polarity","Amorphous","Semicrystalline","Glass_transition","Copolymers","Cellulose_acetate","Nitrocellulose","Cellulose","Esters","Polysulfone","Polyether","Sulfone","Polyacrilonitrile","Polyamide","Polyimide","Polyethylene","Polypropylene","Polytetrafluoroethylene","Polyvinylidene_fluoride","Polyvinylchloride","Ceramic_membrane","Inorganic","Alumina","Titanium_dioxide","Zirconium_dioxide","Membrane_technology","Partitioning","Hydrophilicity","Hydrophobicity","Ionic_charge","Chemical_affinity","Biocompatibility","Contact_angle","Hydrophilic","Hydrophobic","Wetting","Capillary","Surface_tension","Surfactant","Thermodynamic_free_energy","Adsorption","Fouling","Irreversibility","Electrochemical_potential","Amorphous","Heterogeneous","Polytetrafluoroethylene","Cellulose","Esters","Compression_molding","Solvent_casting_and_particulate_leaching","Spray_(liquid_drop)","Glass_transition_temperature","Proteins","DNA","RNA","Microfiltration","Ultrafiltration","Dialysis","Solvent","Crystalline","Molecular_weight","Lamination","Membrane_technology"]}
