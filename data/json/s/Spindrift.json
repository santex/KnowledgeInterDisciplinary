This spray, which \"drifts\" in the direction of\nthe gale, is one of the characteristics of a wind speed of 8 Beaufort and\nhigher at sea.\n\nIn Great Britain \"spindrift\" is the telltale sign used by mariners to define a\nForce 8 (Beaufort Scale) wind (not higher) when observed at sea. See this\nexample of information provided by Lymington Harbour authority, Hampshire,\nEngland, UK, explaining the whole scale, the associated wind speeds, and its\ntelltale signs. Text from the site http://www.lymingtonharbour.co.uk/tide%2-\n0weather/tide%20weather.htm states: Force 8, defined as\n\"Gale\". Wind speed 39-46Â mph, equal to 34-40 knots. Inland, twigs break off\ntrees; progress generally impeded. At sea, moderately high waves of greater\nlength; edges of crests begin to break into spindrift; foam is blown in well-\nmarked streaks along the direction of the wind.\n\nRelatedly, spindrift can also be used to describe fine sand or snow that is\nblown off by the wind.
