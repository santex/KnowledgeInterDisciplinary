The\nband has been credited as one of \"the fathers of crossover thrash\".\nTo date, Suicidal Tendencies have released eight studio albums, one EP, four\nsplit albums including the rare \"Welcome to Venice\", six compilation albums (one\nof which is a \"double-EP\", while the other is a re-recording of their debut\nalbum), and two long-form videos. Other than a small selection of new and\npreviously unreleased songs on the split/compilation albums [[Friends & Family,\nVol. 2]] (2001), [[Year of the Cycos]] (2008), [[No Mercy Fool!/The Suicidal\nFamily]] (2010) and The Mad Mad Muir Musical Tour (2011), Suicidal Tendencies\nhave released no new material in the way of albums or singles since their last\nalbum, [[Free Your Soul and Save My Mind]], came out in 2000.\n\nSuicidal Tendencies rose to fame with their 1983 self-titled debut album, which\nspawned the single \"Institutionalized\". That single was one of the first\ncrossover metal videos to receive substantial airplay on MTV. Suicidal\nTendencies next release was on their own label \"Suicidal Records\" where they\ncontributed one song \"Look Up...(The Boys Are Back) on the 1985 split \"Welcome\nto Venice.\" However they did not release a follow-up full length record until\n1987, with [[Join the Army]]. The album attracted the attention of Epic Records,\nwho signed the band in 1988 and issued their third album, [[How Will I Laugh\nTomorrow When I Can't Even Smile Today]], later that year. This was followed by\ntheir next two albums, [[Controlled by Hatred/Feel Like Shit...DÃ©jÃ  Vu]] and\n[[Lights...Camera...Revolution!]], which were also highly successful and both\ncertified Gold by the RIAA. After releasing two more studio albums\n([[The Art of Rebellion]] and [[Suicidal for Life]]), the band broke up and\nsevered ties from Sony and Epic in 1995. However, they reunited in 1997 and have\ncontinued to perform and record since then. After over a decade of work and many\nlineup changes, the band intends to release their ninth studio album with all-\nnew material, entitled [[13 (Suicidal Tendencies album)|13]], in 2013.\n","linknr":625,"url":"Suicidal_Tendencies","recorded":1362675119,"links":37,"instances":["american_band","fanzine","band","band","metal_band","band","band","band","band","band","band","band","guitarist","band","song","band","guitarist","band","musician","album"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Suicidal
