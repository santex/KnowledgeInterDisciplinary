{"cursor":"7670","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\n\n'Sharing' is the joint use of a resource or space. In its narrow sense, it\nrefers to joint or alternating use of an inherently finite good, such as a\ncommon pasture or a shared residence. It is also the process of dividing and\ndistributing. Apart from obvious instances, which we can observe in human\nactivity, we can also find many examples of this happening in nature. When an\norganism takes in nutrition or oxygen for instance, its internal organs are\ndesigned to divide and distribute the energy taken in, to supply parts of its\nbody that need it. Flowers divide and distribute their seeds. In a broader\nsense, it can also include free granting of use rights to a good that can be\ntreated as a nonrival good, such as information. Still more loosely, âsharingâ\ncan actually mean giving something as an outright gift: for example, to âshareâ\none's food really means to give some of it as a gift. Sharing is a basic\ncomponent of human interaction, and is responsible for strengthening social ties\nand ensuring a personâs well-being.\n","linknr":189,"url":"Sharing","recorded":1362673553,"links":25,"instances":["computer_science","business","computer_science"],"pdf":["http://www.yalelawjournal.org/pdf/114-2/Benkler_114-2.pdf"],"categories":["Social economy","Production economics"],"headings":["In a market","In computer and internet culture","In computer science","In religions","See also","References","Footnotes","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/90/Viola_and_Mina_share_food.jpg/220px-Viola_and_Mina_share_food.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/Translation_to_english_arrow.svg/50px-Translation_to_english_arrow.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg/20px-Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Wikiquote-logo-en.svg/40px-Wikiquote-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["product","business"],["process","computer_science"],["thread","computer_science"]],"members":["thread","product","process"],"related":["Nonrival_good","Ownership","Product_(business)","Demand","Carpooling","Copyright","Gift_economy","Market_economy","Car_sharing","Share_housing","File_sharing","Removable_media","Computer_network","World_Wide_Web","Hyperlink","Peer-to-peer_networking","Peer-to-peer_file_sharing","Free_software","Open_source_software","Licensing","Patents","Copyright","Controversy","Creative_Commons","GNU_General_Public_License","Computer_science","Shared_resource","Time-sharing","Interactive_computing","Computer","Process_(computer_science)","Thread_(computer_science)","Concurrent_programming","Functional_programming","Hash_consing","Missionary_Church_of_Kopimism","Dāna","Niyama","Indian_religions","Vidya","Vidya","Prophet_Muhammad","Pie_method","Generosity"]}
