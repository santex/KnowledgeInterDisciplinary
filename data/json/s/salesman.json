There follows the passing of title (property or ownership) in the\nitem, and the application and due settlement of a price, the obligation for\nwhich arises due to the seller's requirement to pass ownership. Ideally, a\nseller agrees upon a price at which he willingly parts with ownership of or any\nclaim upon the item. The purchaser, though a party to the sale, does not\nexecute the sale, only the seller does that. To be precise the sale completes\nprior to the payment and gives rise to the obligation of payment.
