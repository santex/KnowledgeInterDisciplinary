State IV is believed to date from\n 1660, and looks very different, as Rembrandt greatly reworked and darkened the\n composition. State III is easy to identify, as only it has a visible\n signature.

In the first state the background is plain; the landscape of\n state II was probably added some years later.]] A 'state', in printmaking, is a\n different form of a print, caused by a deliberate and permanent change to a\n matrix such as a copper plate (for engravings etc.) or woodblock (for woodcut).\n\nArtists often take prints from a plate (or block, etc.) and then do further work\non the plate before printing more impressions (copies). Sometimes two states may\nbe printed on the same day, sometimes several years may elapse between them.\n\nStates are usually numbered in Roman numerals: I, II, III..., and often as e.g.:\n\"I/III\", to indicate the first of three recorded states. Some recent scholars\nrefine the work of their predecessors, without wishing to create a confusing new\nnumbering, by identifying states like \"IIa\",\"IVb\" and so forth. A print with no\ndifferent states known is catalogued as \"only state\".\n\nMost authorities do not count accidental damage to a plate – usually\nscratches on a metal plate or cracks in a woodcut block – as\nconstituting different states, partly because scratches can disappear again\nafter being printed a number of times. Prints and\nPrintmaking, Antony Griffiths,p , British Museum Press (in UK),2nd edn, 1996\nISBN 0-7141-2608-X\n\nThe definition of states mostly goes back to Adam von Bartsch, the great\ncataloguer of old master prints. A great deal of work was done by art historians\nduring the 19th and early 20th centuries, and most non-contemporary printmakers\nnow have all the states of their prints catalogued. To discover a new or\nunrecorded state of an old master print is therefore now rare, although it was\nonly in 1967, after it was sold to Cleveland, that it was realised that what had\nlong been famous as the best impression of the highly important print, the\n[[Battle of the Nudes (engraving)|Battle of the Nudes]] by Antonio del\nPollaiuolo (1465-75) was the unique surviving impression of a previously\nunrecognised first state. This is especially surprising as the whole plate was\nextensively reworked between the two, apparently to renew it after it was worn\nfrom printing. Langdale, Shelley, Battle of the Nudes: Pollaiuolo's\nRenaissance Masterpiece, pp. 33-34, The Cleveland Museum of Art, 2002.\n\nIn modern prints, a distinction is made between proof states or working proofs,\nwhich are produced before the print is regarded as finished, and other states.\nThis is usually possible because modern prints are issued in editions, usually\nsigned and numbered. In the case of old master prints, before about 1830, this\nwas not usually the case, and proof state is only used when the print is clearly\nhalf-finished, as with two impressions of Albrecht DÃ¼rer's Adam and Eve in the\nBritish Museum and the Albertina in Vienna. However, most \"artist's proofs\" are\nimpressions of the main state which are not counted in the main limited edition\nnumbers, and are taken by the artist; they are therefore from the same state as\nthe main edition.\n\nFor example, unlike DÃ¼rer, for whom relatively few different states survive,\nRembrandt prints have often survived in multiple states (up to eleven). It is\nclear that many of the earlier states are working proofs, made to confirm how\nthe printed image was developing, but it is impossible to draw a confident line\nbetween these and other states that Rembrandt may well have regarded as finished\nat the point he printed them. Rembrandt is one of the most prolific creator of\nstates, and also reworked plates after leaving them for some years.\n\nNew states in old master prints are often caused by the adding of\ninscriptions (signatures, dedications, publishers details, even a price)\ninside or below the image. Except for signatures, these would often not be\nadded by the artist himself. A wholesale example is Daniel Hopfer, the\ninventor of etching as a printmaking technique (in c1500), and other members\nof his family. In the late 17th century, a distant relative of the Hopfers,\nDavid Funck, acquired 230 of the Hopfers' iron plates, and reprinted these\nunder the title Operae Hopferianae, adding a somewhat crudely scratched\nnumber, known as the Funck number, to each one, thus creating a second state\nof the hitherto unretouched plates.\n\nSometimes another artist may add to a plate, or a (usually) anonymous artist or\ncraftsman would rework a plate which has become worn out by printing. This has\nnow been done to most surviving plates by Rembrandt (often more than once) and\nmany by Goya, Martin Schongauer and others.\n\nWhen they develop a keen collector's market, artists have often exploited this\nby creating extra states. This trend can be seen in, among others, the English\nmezzotinters of the late 18th century (\"before lettering\" states were their\nspeciality) and Sir David Young Cameron in the early 20th century (his record\nwas a rather absurd twenty-eight states).\n","linknr":120,"url":"State_(printmaking)","recorded":1362477363,"links":16,"instances":["engraving"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Printmaking"],"headings":["Book Collecting","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/Rembrandt_The_Three_Crosses_1653.jpg/340px-Rembrandt_The_Three_Crosses_1653.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a7/Judith_with_the_Head_of_Holofernes_Mocetto_2nd_state.jpg/220px-Judith_with_the_Head_of_Holofernes_Mocetto_2nd_state.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["battle_of_the_nudes","engraving"]],"members":["battle_of_the_nudes"],"related":["Rembrandt","Andrea_Mantegna","Printmaking","Engraving","Woodcut","Roman_numeral","Adam_von_Bartsch","Old_master_print","Antonio_del_Pollaiuolo","Edition","Albrecht_Dürer","British_Museum","Albertina,_Vienna","Rembrandt","Daniel_Hopfer","Etching","Francisco_Goya","Martin_Schongauer","Mezzotint","David_Young_Cameron","Book_collecting","BnF","Cleveland_Museum_of_Art","Battle_of_the_Nudes_(engraving)","Antonio_del_Pollaiolo"]}
