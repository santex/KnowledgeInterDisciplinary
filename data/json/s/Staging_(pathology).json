{"cursor":"12387","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Cancer staging' is the process of determining the extent to which a cancer has\ndeveloped by spreading. Contemporary practice is to assign a number from I-IV to\na cancer, with I being an isolated cancer and IV being a cancer which has spread\nto the limit of what the assessment measures. The stage generally takes into\naccount the size of a tumor, how deeply it has penetrated within the wall of a\nhollow organ (intestine, urinary bladder), whether it has invaded adjacent\norgans, how many regional lymph nodes it has metastasized to (if any), and\nwhether it has spread to distant organs.\n","linknr":307,"url":"Staging_(pathology)","recorded":1362510678,"links":24,"instances":["medicine","biology","biology"],"pdf":["http://choosingwisely.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/5things_12_factsheet_Amer_Soc_Clin_Onc.pdf","http://choosingwisely.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/5things_12_factsheet_Amer_Soc_Clin_Onc.pdf"],"categories":["Anatomical pathology","Cancer staging"],"headings":["TNM staging system","Considerations in staging","Systems of staging","Overall stage grouping","Stage migration","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/Cancer_stages.png/500px-Cancer_stages.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["specialty","medicine"],["tissue","biology"],["cell","biology"]],"members":["specialty","tissue","cell"],"related":["Cancer","Tumor","Organs","Lymph_nodes","Metastasis","TNM_staging_system","Surgery","Physical_examination","Radiology","Endoscopy","Microscopically","Pathologist","Chemotherapy","Radiation_therapy","Brain_tumor","Hematological_malignancies","Specialty_(medicine)","Professional_organizations","Positron_emission_tomography","X-ray_computed_tomography","Bone_scintigraphy","Overutilization","Tissue_(biology)","Cell_(biology)","Lymph_node","MRNA","Guanylyl_cyclase_c","Intestinal_epithelium","RT-PCR","Colorectal_metaplasia","Prognosis","Proteins","Breast_cancer","Lung_cancer","International_Union_Against_Cancer","American_Joint_Committee_on_Cancer","Lymphoma","Ann_Arbor_staging","Breast_cancer","Breast_cancer_classification","TNM_staging_system","International_Federation_of_Gynecology_and_Obstetrics","Cervical_intraepithelial_neoplasia","Dukes_classification","Kidney_cancer","Cancer_of_the_larynx","Lung_cancer","Prostate_cancer_staging","Testicular_cancer","Blood_serum","Skin_cancer","Bladder_cancer","Roman_numerals","Carcinoma_in_situ","Hodgkin's_Disease","MRI","Will_Rogers_phenomenon"]}
