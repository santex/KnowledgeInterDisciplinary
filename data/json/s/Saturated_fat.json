{"cursor":"38176","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Saturated fat' is fat that consists of triglycerides containing only saturated\nfatty acids. Saturated fatty acids have no double bonds between the individual\ncarbon atoms of the fatty acid chain. That is, the chain of carbon atoms is\nfully \"saturated\" with hydrogen atoms. There are many kinds of naturally\noccurring saturated fatty acids, which differ mainly in number of carbon atoms,\nfrom 3 carbons (propionic acid) to 36 (hexatriacontanoic acid).\n\nVarious fats contain different proportions of saturated and unsaturated fat.\nExamples of foods containing a high proportion of saturated fat include animal\nfats such as cream, cheese, butter, and ghee; suet, tallow, lard, and fatty\nmeats; as well as certain vegetable products such as coconut oil, cottonseed\noil, palm kernel oil, chocolate, and many prepared foods.
