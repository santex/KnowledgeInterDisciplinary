Allen, D., Cooksey, C., & Tsai, B. (2010, October 5).\nSpectrophotometry. Retrieved from\nhttp://www.nist.gov/pml/div685/grp03/spectrophotometry.cfm It is more\nspecific than the general term electromagnetic spectroscopy in that\nspectrophotometry deals with visible light, near-ultraviolet, and near-infrared,\nbut does not cover time-resolved spectroscopic techniques.\n\nSpectrophotometry involves the use of a spectrophotometer. A spectrophotometer\nis a photometer that can measure intensity as a function of the light source\nwavelength. Important features of spectrophotometers are spectral bandwidth and\nlinear range of absorption or reflectance measurement.\n\nA spectrophotometer is commonly used for the measurement of transmittance or\nreflectance of solutions, transparent or opaque solids, such as polished glass,\nor gases. However they can also be designed to measure the diffusivity on any of\nthe listed light ranges that usually cover around 200nm - 2500nm using different\ncontrols and calibrations. Allen, D., Cooksey, C., & Tsai, B. (2010, October\n5). Spectrophotometry. Retrieved from\nhttp://www.nist.gov/pml/div685/grp03/spectrophotometry.cfm Within these\nranges of light, calibrations are needed on the machine using standards that\nvary in type depending on the wavelength of the photometric\ndetermination. Schwedt, Georg. (1997). The Essential Guide to Analytical\nChemistry. (Brooks Haderlie, trans.). Chichester, NY: Wiley. (Original Work\nPublished 1943). pp. 16-17\n\nAn example of an experiment in which spectrophotometry is used is the\ndetermination of the equilibrium constant of a solution. A certain chemical\nreaction within a solution may occur in a forward and reverse direction where\nreactants form products and products break down into reactants. At some point,\nthis chemical reaction will reach a point of balance called an equilibrium\npoint. In order to determine the respective concentrations of reactants and\nproducts at this point, the light transmittance of the solution can be tested\nusing spectrophotometry. The amount of light that passes through the solution is\nindicative of the concentration of certain chemicals that do not allow light to\npass through.\n\nThe use of spectrophotometers spans various scientific fields, such as physics,\nmaterials science, chemistry, biochemistry, and molecular biology.

B.\nSaunders Company: Philadelphia, PA. 1976. pp. 46-55 They are widely used\nin many industries including semiconductors, laser and optical manufacturing,\nprinting and forensic examination, as well in laboratories for the study of\nchemical substances. Ultimately, a spectrophotometer is able to determine,\ndepending on the control or calibration, what substances are present in a target\nand exactly how much through calculations of observed wavelengths.\n","linknr":367,"url":"Spectrophotometry","recorded":1362485417,"links":44,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Spectroscopy","Photochemistry"],"headings":["Design","UV-visible spectrophotometry","IR spectrophotometry","Spectroradiometers","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/10/Spektrofotometri.jpg/220px-Spektrofotometri.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/Spetrophotometer-en.svg/440px-Spetrophotometer-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Chemistry","Electromagnetic_spectroscopy","Visible_spectrum","Ultraviolet","Infrared","Time-resolved_spectroscopy","Photometer","Reflectivity","Calibrations","Wavelength","Physics","Materials_science","Chemistry","Biochemistry","Molecular_biology","Monochromator","Diffraction_grating","Photomultiplier_tube","Photodiode","Charge_coupled_devices","Photodiode_arrays","Fourier_transform","Fourier_transform_infrared_spectroscopy","Charge_coupled_device","Photodetector","Transmittance","Reflectance","UV","Visible_spectrum","Infrared","Colorimetry","Spectral_reflectance","Bi-spectral_fluorescent_spectrophotometer","Beer-Lambert_law","Cuvette","Glass","Plastic","Quartz_glass","Dissolved_organic_carbon","Specific_Ultraviolet_Absorption","Bial's_Test","Salts","Potassium_bromide","Silver_chloride","Spectroradiometer","Spectral_density","Atomic_Absorption_Spectrophotometry","Atomic_emission_spectroscopy","Inductively_coupled_plasma_atomic_emission_spectroscopy","Inductively_coupled_plasma_mass_spectrometry","Spectroradiometry","Slope_spectroscopy"]}
