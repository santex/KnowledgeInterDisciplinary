Slime molds were formerly classified as fungi or protists,\nbut are no longer considered part of these kingdoms.\n\nTheir common name refers to part of some of these organisms' life cycles where\nthey can appear as gelatinous \"slime\". This is mostly seen with the myxomycetes,\nwhich are the only macroscopic slime molds.\n\nFound in a wide variety of colours, more than 900 species of slime mold occur\nall over the world and feed on microorganisms that live in any type of dead\nplant material. They contribute to the decomposition of dead vegetation, and\nfeed on bacteria, yeasts, and fungi. For this reason, these organisms are\nusually found in soil, lawns, and on the forest floor, commonly on deciduous\nlogs. However, in tropical areas they are also common on inflorescences, fruits\nand in aerial situations (e.g., in the canopy of trees). In urban areas, they\nare found on mulch or even in the leaf mold in gutters, and also grow in air\nconditioners, especially when the drain is blocked. One of the most commonly\nencountered slime molds is the yellow [[Physarum polycephalum]], found both in\nnature in forests in temperate zones, as well as in classrooms and laboratories.\n\nMost slime molds are smaller than a few centimeters, but some species may reach\nsizes of up to several square meters and masses of up to\n30 grams.\n\nWhen food is abundant a slime mold exists as a single-celled organism, but when\nfood is in short supply, slime molds congregate and start moving as a single\nbody. In this state they are sensitive to airborne chemicals and can detect food\nsources. They can readily change the shape and function of parts and may form\nstalks that produce fruiting bodies, releasing countless spores, light enough to\nbe carried on the wind or hitch a ride on passing animals.
