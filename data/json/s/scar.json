A scar results from the biological process of wound repair in the skin\nand other tissues of the body. Thus, scarring is a natural part of the healing\nprocess. With the exception of very minor lesions, every wound (e.g. after\naccident, disease, or surgery) results in some degree of scarring. An exception\nto this is animals with regeneration, which do not form scars and the tissue\nwill grow back exactly as before.\n\nScar tissue is exactly the same protein (collagen)<ref name=collagenskinscar2010-08-\n20/> as the tissue that it replaces,<ref name=collagenskinscar2010-08-\n20>{{Cite web\n  | last = Sherratt first = Jonathan A. title = Mathematical Modelling of Scar\n  | Tissue Formation quote = This is composed of the same main protein\n  | (collagen) as normal skin, but with differences in details of composition.\n  | Most crucially, the protein fibres in normal tissue have a random\n  | (basketweave) appearance, while those in scar tissue have pronounced\n  | alignment in a single direction. publisher = Department of Mathematics, Heriot-\n  | Watt University year = 2010 url =\n  | http://www.ma.hw.ac.uk/~jas/researchinterests/scartissueformation.html\n  | accessdate = 2010-08-20}}</ref> but the fiber composition of the protein is\n  | different;<ref name=collagenskinscar2010-08-20/> instead of a random\n  | basketweave formation of the collagen fibers found in normal tissue,<ref name=collagenskinscar2010-08-\n  | 20/> in fibrosis the collagen cross-links and forms a pronounced alignment\n  | in a single direction.<ref name=collagenskinscar2010-08-20/> This collagen\n  | scar tissue alignment is usually of inferior functional quality to the\n  | normal collagen randomised alignment.
