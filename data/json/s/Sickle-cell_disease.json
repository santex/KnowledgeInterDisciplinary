Sickling decreases the cells' flexibility and results in a risk of\nvarious complications. The sickling occurs because of a mutation in the\nhemoglobin gene. Life expectancy is shortened. In 1994, in the US, the average\nlife expectancy of persons with this condition was estimated to be 42 years in\nmales and 48 years in females, but today, thanks to better management\nof the disease, patients can live into their 50s or\nbeyond. http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000527.htm\n\nSickle-cell disease occurs more commonly in people (or their descendants) from\nparts of tropical and sub-tropical sub-saharan regions where malaria is or was\ncommon. In areas where malaria is common, there is a fitness benefit in carrying\nonly a single sickle-cell gene (sickle cell trait). Those with only one of the\ntwo alleles of the sickle-cell disease, while not totally resistant, are more\ntolerant to the infection and thus show less severe symptoms when\ninfected.\n\nSickle-cell anaemia is the name of a specific form of sickle-cell disease in\nwhich there is homozygosity for the mutation that causes HbS. Sickle-cell\nanaemia is also referred to as \"HbSS\", \"SS disease\", \"haemoglobin S\" or\npermutations thereof. In heterozygous people, who have only one sickle gene and\none normal adult haemoglobin gene, it is referred to as \"HbAS\" or \"sickle cell\ntrait\". Other, rarer forms of sickle-cell disease include sickle-haemoglobin C\ndisease (HbSC), sickle beta-plus-thalassaemia (HbS/Î² +) and sickle beta-zero-\nthalassaemia (HbS/Î² 0). These other forms of sickle-cell disease are\ncompound heterozygous states in which the person has only one copy of the\nmutation that causes HbS and one copy of another abnormal haemoglobin allele.\n\nThe term disease is applied, because the inherited abnormality causes a\npathological condition that can lead to death and severe complications. Not all\ninherited variants of haemoglobin are detrimental, a concept known as genetic\npolymorphism.\n","linknr":1038,"url":"Sickle-cell_disease","recorded":1362484047,"links":62,"instances":["region","biology","medical","medicine"],"pdf":["http://apps.who.int/gb/ebwha/pdf_files/WHA59/A59_9-en.pdf","http://apps.who.int/gb/ebwha/pdf_files/WHA59/A59_9-en.pdf"],"categories":["Autosomal
