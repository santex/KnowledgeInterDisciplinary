Phylogenies have two components, branching\norder (showing group relationships) and branch length (showing amount of\nevolution). Phylogenetic trees of species and higher taxa are used to study the\nevolution of traits (e.g., anatomical or molecular characteristics) and the\ndistribution of organisms (biogeography). Systematics, in other words, is used\nto understand the evolutionary history of life on Earth.\n\n\"Systematic biology\" and \"taxonomy\" (terms that are often confused and used\ninterchangeably) were defined in relationship to one another as\nfollows: Michener, Charles D., John O. Corliss, Richard S. Cowan, Peter H.\nRaven, Curtis W. Sabrosky, Donald S. Squires, and G. W. Wharton (1970).\nSystematics In Support of Biological Research. Division of Biology and\nAgriculture, National Research Council. Washington, D.C. 25 pp.\n\n Systematic biology (hereafter called simply systematics) is the\nfield that (a) provides scientific names for organisms, (b) describes them, (c)\npreserves collections of them, (d) provides classifications for the organisms,\nkeys for their identification, and data on their distributions, (e) investigates\ntheir evolutionary histories, and (f) considers their environmental adaptations.\nThis is a field with a long history that in recent years has experienced a\nnotable renaissance, principally with respect to theoretical content. Part of\nthe theoretical material has to do with evolutionary areas (topics e and f\nabove), the rest relates especially to the problem of classification. Taxonomy\nis that part of Systematics concerned with topics (a) to (d) above.\n\n\nThe term \"systematics\" is sometimes used synonymously with \"taxonomy\", and may\nbe confused with \"scientific classification\". Europeans tend to use the terms\n\"systematics\" and \"biosystematics\" for the field of the study of biodiversity as\na whole, whereas North Americans tend to use \"taxonomy\" more frequently.\nBrusca, R. C., & Brusca, G. J. (2003). Invertebrates (2nd ed.). Sunderland,\nMass. : Sinauer Associates, p. 27 However, taxonomy, and in particular\nalpha taxonomy, is more specifically the identification, description, and naming\n(i.e. nomenclature) of organisms, while\n\"classification\" is focused on placing organisms within hierarchical groups that\nshow their relationships to other organisms. All of these biological disciplines\ncan be involved with extinct and extant organisms. However, systematics alone\ndeals specifically with relationships through time, and can be synonymous with\nphylogenetics, broadly dealing with the inferred hierarchy of organisms.\n\nSystematics uses taxonomy as a primary tool in understanding organisms, as\nnothing about an organism's relationships with other living things can be\nunderstood without it first being properly studied and described in sufficient\ndetail to identify and classify it correctly. Scientific classifications are\naids in recording and reporting information to other scientists and to laymen.\nThe 'systematist', a scientist who specializes in systematics, must, therefore,\nbe able to use existing classification systems, or at least know them well\nenough to skillfully justify not using them.\n\nPhenetic systematics was an attempt to determine the relationships of organisms\nthrough a measure of similarity, considering plesiomorphies (ancestral traits)\nand apomorphies (derived traits) to be equally informative. From the 20th\ncentury onwards, it was superseded by cladistics, which considers plesiomorphies\nto be uninformative for an attempt to resolve the phylogeny of Earth's various\norganisms through time. Today's systematists generally make extensive use of\nmolecular biology and computer programs to study organisms. An alternative to\nthese matrix methods in phylogenetics and systematics is cladoendesis.\n\nSystematics is fundamental to biology because it is the foundation for all\nstudies of organisms, by showing how any organism relates to other living things\n(ancestor-descendant relationships).\n\nSystematics is also of major importance in understanding conservation issues\nbecause it attempts to explain the Earth's biodiversity and could be used to\nassist in allocating limited means to preserve and protect endangered species,\nby looking at, for example, the genetic diversity among various taxa of plants\nor animals and deciding how much of that to preserve.\n","linknr":659,"url":"Systematics","recorded":1362483181,"links":63,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Evolutionary biology","Scientific classification"],"headings":["Taxonomic characters","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/69/Phylogenetics.svg/400px-Phylogenetics.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/CollapsedtreeLabels-simplified.svg/200px-CollapsedtreeLabels-simplified.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/Tree_of_life.svg/16px-Tree_of_life.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/Office-book.svg/16px-Office-book.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/Biology_organism_collage.png/100px-Biology_organism_collage.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Correlation_and_dependence","Cladograms","Phylogenetic_tree","Taxa","Biogeography","Taxonomy","Scientific_classification","Alpha_taxonomy","Extinct","Extant_taxon","Phenetic","Plesiomorph","Apomorph","Cladistics","Phylogeny","Molecular_biology","Computer_programs","Cladoendesis","Phylogeny","Cladistics","Methodology","Evolutionary_systematics","Phenetics","Phylogeny","16S_ribosomal_RNA","Phylogenetic_comparative_methods","Biodiversity","Scientific_classification","Taxonomy"]}
