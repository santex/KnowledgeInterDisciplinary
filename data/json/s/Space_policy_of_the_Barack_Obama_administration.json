He committed to increasing NASA funding by $6\nbillion over five years and completing the design of a new heavy-lift launch\nvehicle by 2015 and to begin construction thereafter. He also predicted a U.S.\ncrewed orbital Mars mission by the mid-2030s, preceded by an asteroid mission by\n2025. In response to concerns over job losses, Obama promised a $40 million\neffort to help Space Coast workers affected by the cancellation of the Space\nShuttle program and Constellation program.\n\nThe Obama administration's space policy was made subsequent to the final report\nof the Review of United States Human Space Flight Plans Committee, which it had\ninstituted to review the human spaceflight plans of the United States in the post-\nSpace Shuttle era. The NASA Authorization Act of 2010, passed on October 11,\n2010, enacted many of the Obama administration's space policy goals.\n","linknr":497,"url":"Space_policy_of_the_Barack_Obama_administration","recorded":1362268041,"links":35,"instances":["constellation_program","spacecraft"],"pdf":["http://web.archive.org/web/20080102204643/http://www.barackobama.com/issues/pdf/PreK-12EducationFactSheet.pdf","http://www.barackobama.com/issues/pdf/PreK-12EducationFactSheet.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20080102204643/http://www.barackobama.com/issues/pdf/PreK-12EducationFactSheet.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20081028022423/http://www.barackobama.com/pdf/policy/Space_Fact_Sheet_FINAL.pdf","http://www.barackobama.com/pdf/policy/Space_Fact_Sheet_FINAL.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20081028022423/http://www.barackobama.com/pdf/policy/Space_Fact_Sheet_FINAL.pdf","http://www.ostp.gov/galleries/press_release_files/NASA%20Review.pdf","http://www.ostp.gov/galleries/press_release_files/NASA%20Review.pdf","http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/396093main_HSF_Cmte_FinalReport.pdf","http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/396093main_HSF_Cmte_FinalReport.pdf","http://www.whitehouse.gov/files/documents/ostp/press_release_files/Buzz%20Aldrin%20Statement.pdf","http://www.whitehouse.gov/files/documents/ostp/press_release_files/Buzz%20Aldrin%20Statement.pdf"],"categories":["Speeches
