SCID is the most\nsevere form of primary immunodeficiencies , and there\nare now at least nine different known genes in which mutations lead to a form\nof SCID . It is also known as the 'bubble boy disease'\nbecause its victims are extremely vulnerable to infectious diseases and some of\nthem, such as David Vetter, become famous for living in a sterile environment.\nSCID is the result of an immune system so highly compromised that it is\nconsidered almost absent.\n\nSCID patients are usually affected by severe bacterial, viral, or fungal\ninfections early in life and often present with interstitial lung disease,\nchronic diarrhea, and failure to thrive . Ear infections,\nrecurrent ''Pneumocystis jirovecii(previously carinii) pneumonia, and profuse\noral candidiasis commonly occur. These babies, if untreated, usually die within\n1 year due to severe, recurrent infections unless they have undergone successful\nHematopoietic stem cell transplantation.\n","linknr":474,"url":"Severe_combined_immunodeficiency_disorder","recorded":1362503753,"links":25,"instances":["microbiology","genetics","molecular_biology"],"pdf":["http://www.esgct.org/downloads/ESGTStatement.pdf"],"categories":["Rare diseases","Genetic disorders by system","Combined T and B–cell immunodeﬁciencies","Noninfectious immunodeficiency-related cutaneous conditions","DNA replication and repair-deficiency disorders"],"headings":["Prevalence","Types","Detection","Treatment","SCID in animals","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["sterilization","microbiology"],["v(dj_recombination"],["v(dj_recombination"],["transduction","genetics"],["vector","molecular_biology"]],"members":["sterilization","transduction","vector"],"related":["Genetic_disorder","B_cell","T_cell","Adaptive_immune_system","Genes","Infectious_diseases","David_Vetter","Sterilization_(microbiology)","Ear_infection","Pneumocystis_pneumonia","Candidiasis","Hematopoietic_stem_cell_transplantation","Australia","Navajo_people","Navajo_people","Apache","X-SCID","Mutation","Common_gamma_chain","Interleukin","Interleukin_2","Interleukin_4","Interleukin_7","Interleukin_9","Interleukin_15","Interleukin_21","T_cells","NK_cells","B_cells","IL-2_receptor","X-linked_recessive","Adenosine_deaminase_deficiency","Adenosine_deaminase","Purine","Ribonucleotide_reductase","Purine_nucleoside_phosphorylase_deficiency","Purine_nucleoside_phosphorylase","Enzyme","DGTP","T-cell","Omenn_syndrome","Immunoglobulin","RAG-1","RAG-2","V(D)J_recombination","B_cell","T_cell","V(D)J_recombination","Bare_lymphocyte_syndrome","MHC_class_II","Antigen_presenting_cells","JAK3","Janus_kinase-3","DCLRE1C","DNA","Antibody","Bone_marrow_transplant","David_Vetter","Epstein-Barr","Gene_therapy","Transduction_(genetics)","Virus","Vector_(molecular_biology)","Leukemia","Oncogene","European_Society_of_Gene_Therapy","Retrovirus","Autosome","Recessive_gene","Arabian_horse","DNA","Foal","Basset_Hound","X-SCID","Jack_Russell_Terrier","List_of_cutaneous_conditions","List_of_radiographic_findings_associated_with_cutaneous_conditions"]}
