It is the\nfourth and final of the NASA Great Observatories program.\n\nThe planned mission period was to be 2.5 years with a pre-launch expectation\nthat the mission could extend to five or slightly more years until the onboard\nliquid helium supply was exhausted. This occurred on 15 May 2009. http://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/Media/releases/ssc2009-\n12/index.shtml Without liquid helium to cool the telescope to the very\ncold temperatures needed to operate, most instruments are no longer usable.\nHowever, the two shortest wavelength modules of the IRAC camera are still\noperable with the same sensitivity as before the cryogen was exhausted, and will\ncontinue to be used in the 'Spitzer Warm Mission'.\n\nIn keeping with NASA tradition, the telescope was renamed after successful\ndemonstration of operation, on December 18, 2003. Unlike most telescopes which\nare named after famous deceased astronomers by a board of scientists, the name\nfor SIRTF was obtained from a contest open to the general public.\n\nThe contest led to the telescope being named in honor of Lyman Spitzer, one of\nthe 20th century's great scientists. Though he was\nnot the first to propose the idea of the space telescope (Hermann Oberth being\nthe first, in Wege zur Raumschiffahrt, 1929, and also in Die Rakete\nzu den PlanetenrÃ¤umen, 1923), Please refer to Hubble Space Telescope.\nSpitzer wrote a 1946 report for RAND describing the advantages of an\nextraterrestrial observatory and how it could be realized with available (or\nupcoming) technology. He has been cited for his pioneering\ncontributions to rocketry and astronomy, as well as \"his vision and leadership\nin articulating the advantages and benefits to be realized from the Space\nTelescope Program.\"\n\nThe Spitzer was launched from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, on a Delta II\n7920H ELV rocket, Monday, 25 August 2003 at 13:35:39 UTC-5 (EDT).\n\nIt follows a rather unusual orbit, heliocentric instead of geocentric, trailing\nand drifting away from Earth's orbit at approximately 0.1 astronomical unit per\nyear (a so-called \"earth-trailing\" orbit). The primary mirror is in diameter,\n''f''/12 and made of beryllium and was cooled to . The satellite contains three\ninstruments that allowed it to perform astronomical imaging and photometry from\n3 to 180 micrometers, spectroscopy from 5 to 40 micrometers, and\nspectrophotometry from 5 to 100 micrometers.\n","linknr":711,"url":"Spitzer_Space_Telescope","recorded":1362268022,"links":68,"instances":["rocket_stage","spacecraft","astronomy","constellation"],"pdf":["http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/pdf/nature08515.pdf","http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/pdf/nature08515.pdf"],"categories":["2003
