Southern Adventist University occupies a campus\n  | in a rural setting in the Tennessee River Valley.\n\nIt was founded in 1892 in Graysville, Tennessee, as Graysville Academy and was\nthe first Adventist school in the southern U.S. Due to the need for additional\nspace for expansion the school relocated in 1916 and was renamed Southern Junior\nCollege. In 1944 Southern began awarding baccalaureate degrees and was renamed\nSouthern Missionary College. In 1996 the institution started conferring Masters\ndegrees and adopted its current name.\n\nSouthern offers baccalaureate, associate and master's degrees. It is accredited by multiple organizations including the\nCommission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. Its\nInstitute of Archaeology offers an undergraduate degree in biblical archaeology;\nSouthern is one of only two schools which offer the degree.
