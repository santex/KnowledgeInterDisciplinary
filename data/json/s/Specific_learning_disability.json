While learning disability and learning disorder\nare often used interchangeably, the two differ. Learning disability refers to\nsignificant learning problems in an academic area. These problems, however, are\nnot enough to warrant an official diagnosis. Learning disorder, on the other\nhand, is an official clinical diagnosis, whereby the individual meets certain\ncriteria, as determined by a professional (psychologist, pediatrician, etc.) The\ndifference is in degree, frequency, and intensity of reported symptoms and\nproblems, and thus the two should not be confused. When the term \"learning\ndisabilities\" is used, it describes a group of disorders characterized by\ninadequate development of specific academic, language, and speech skills. Childhood Voyages in Development\nThird Edition, Thomson Wadsworth. (2008), p. 387. Retrieved 2012-12-19.\nTypes of learning disabilities include reading disability (dyslexia),\nmathematics disability (dyscalculia) and writing disability (dysgraphia).\n\nThe unknown factor is the disorder that affects the brain's ability to receive\nand process information. This disorder can make it problematic for a person to\nlearn as quickly or in the same way as someone who is not affected by a learning\ndisability. People with a learning disability have trouble performing specific\ntypes of skills or completing tasks if left to figure things out by themselves\nor if taught in conventional ways.\n\nLearning disabilities are life long. However, with appropriate\ncognitive/academic interventions and technology assistance many can overcome the\neffects of their disability. Individuals with learning disabilities can face\nunique challenges that are often pervasive throughout the lifespan. Depending on\nthe type and severity of the disability, interventions and current technologies\nmay be used to help the individual learn strategies that will foster future\nsuccess. Some interventions can be quite simplistic, while others are intricate\nand complex. Current technologies may require student training to be effective\nclassroom supports. Teachers, parents and schools can create plans together that\ntailor intervention and accommodations to aid the individual in successfully\nbecoming independent learners. School psychologists and other qualified\nprofessionals quite often help design the intervention and coordinate the\nexecution of the intervention with teachers and parents. Social support may\nimprove the learning for students with learning disabilities.\n","linknr":576,"url":"Specific_learning_disability","recorded":1362375068,"links":49,"instances":["sense","process"],"pdf":["http://ldq.sagepub.com/content/34/3/167.full.pdf","http://www.prc.utexas.edu/etag/23rd%20Floor%20Publications/Shifrer,%20Dara/Shifrer%20et%20al.%202010-Disproportionality.pdf","http://www.prc.utexas.edu/etag/23rd%20Floor%20Publications/Shifrer,%20Dara/Shifrer%20et%20al.%202010-Disproportionality.pdf","http://www.prc.utexas.edu/etag/23rd%20Floor%20Publications/Shifrer,%20Dara/Shifrer%20et%20al.%202010-Disproportionality&Disability.pdf","http://www.prc.utexas.edu/etag/23rd%20Floor%20Publications/Shifrer,%20Dara/Shifrer%20et%20al.%202010-Disproportionality&Disability.pdf"],"categories":["Childhood psychiatric disorders","Learning disabilities|","Educational psychology","Special education","Dyslexia","Childhood","Parenting"],"headings":["Definitions","Types","Diagnosis","Treatment and intervention","Causes and risk factors","Impact on affected individuals","Social correlates","Contrast with other conditions","United States and Canada","United Kingdom","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Ambox_globe_content.svg/48px-Ambox_globe_content.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/eb/Handicapped_Accessible_sign.svg/16px-Handicapped_Accessible_sign.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg/20px-Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg/20px-Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["hearing","sense"],["reading","process"]],"members":["hearing","reading"],"related":["Dyslexia","Dyscalculia","Dysgraphia","Human_brain","Psychogenic","DSM-IV","DSM-5","Disorder_of_written_expression","Sequence_learning","Dyslexia","Dysphasia","Aphasia","Developmental_Dyspraxia","Dysgraphia","Dyscalculia","Nonverbal_learning_disability","Executive_functions","Psychiatrist","School_psychologist","Clinical_psychologist","Counseling_psychologist","Neuropsychologist","Intelligence_test","Response_to_intervention","Direct_Instruction","Spell_checkers","Text-to-speech","Speech-to-text","Resource_room","Resource_room","Individualized_education_program","Educational_Therapy","Socioeconomic_status","IQ","Mentally_retarded","Mentally_deficient","Attention-deficit_hyperactivity_disorder","Anxiety","United_States","Canada","Speech","Hearing_(sense)","Reading_(process)","Writing","Spelling","Reason","Information","Math","IQ","Average","Section_504_of_the_Rehabilitation_Act","Education_for_All_Handicapped_Children_Act","United_States_federal_law","Special_education","UK","Specific_learning_difficulty","Dyslexia","Dyspraxia","Dyscalculia","Mental_retardation","Language-based_learning_disability","Learning_Disability_Coalition","Rundle_Academy","Bridges_Academy","Secondary_handicap","Functional_disconnection","Winterbourne_View_hospital_abuse"]}
