Later\nproduction used an IS tank chassis and was re-designated ISU-152. Because of its\nadopted role as an impromptu heavy tank destroyer, capable of knocking out the\nheaviest German armoured vehiclesâTiger and Panther tanks, and Elefant tank\ndestroyersâit was nicknamed Zveroboy which roughly translates to \"one who fights\nbeasts/animals\". {{Citation\n | last =Green first =Michael author-link = last2 =Brown first2 =James D. author2-\n | link = title =Tiger Tanks at War place =St. Paul publisher =Zenith Press\n | series = volume = origyear = year =2008 month= edition = chapter =Red Army\n | Solutions for the Tiger E Tank chapterurl =http://books.google.fr/books?id=K-\n | LIH9ZKEsXAC&pg=PA104&dq=Zveroboy&hl=en&sa=X&ei=maJfUd7yFZSXhQffgoDQAg&ved=0C-\n | DkQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=Zveroboy&f=false page =104 pages = language = url =\n | archiveurl = archivedate = doi = id = isbn =978-0-7603-3112-5 mr = zbl = jfm\n | = }} This name was ideal for Soviet propaganda.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"SU-152","recorded":1371249397,"links":[],"instances":["energy","russia"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Assault guns","World War II tank destroyers","World War II self-propelled artillery","Self-propelled artillery of the Soviet Union","152 mm artillery"],"headings":["Development","Construction and design","Combat history","Organisation","Notes","See also","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["152-mm_gun-howitzer_m1937","ml-20"],["152_mm_howitzer-gun_m1937","ml-20"],["152-mm_gun-howitzer_m1937","ml-20"],["152-mm_howitzer_m1938","m-10"],["accumulator","energy"],["f1_grenade","russia"]],"members":["accumulator","f1_grenade"],"related":["Artillery","Torsion_beam_suspension","152-mm_gun-howitzer_M1937_(ML-20)","DShK","Diesel_engine","Soviet_Union","Self-propelled_gun","World_War_II","152_mm_howitzer-gun_M1937_(ML-20)","Kliment_Voroshilov_tank","Iosif_Stalin_tank","ISU-152","Tank_destroyer","Tiger_I","Panther_tank","Elefant","Battle_of_Stalingrad","Operation_Uranus","Red_Army","152-mm_gun-howitzer_M1937_(ML-20)","Kliment_Voroshilov_tank","152-mm_howitzer_M1938_(M-10)","Casemate","Chelyabinsk","Tank_destroyer","DShK","ISU-152","Motovilikha_Plants","Perm","SU-76","Torsion_bar","Accumulator_(energy)","PPSh-41","F1_grenade_(Russia)","SU-100","Battle_of_Kursk","T-34","88mm","KwK_40","Panzer_IV","StuG","Battle_of_Kursk","Hero_of_the_Soviet_Union","Spalling","Operation_Bagration","Finland","Crimea","ISU-152","List_of_Soviet_tanks"]}
