{"cursor":"44469","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nA 'social network' is a social structure made up of a set of actors (such as\nindividuals or organizations) and the dyadic ties between these actors. The\nsocial network perspective provides a clear way of analyzing the structure of\nwhole social entities. The study of these structures\nuses social network analysis to identify local and global patterns, locate\ninfluential entities, and examine network dynamics.\n\nSocial networks and the analysis of them is an inherently interdisciplinary\nacademic field which emerged from social psychology, sociology, statistics, and\ngraph theory. Georg Simmel authored early structural theories in sociology\nemphasizing the dynamics of triads and \"web of group affiliations.\"\nJacob Moreno is credited with developing the first sociograms in the 1930s to\nstudy interpersonal relationships. These approaches were mathematically\nformalized in the 1950s and theories and methods of social networks became\npervasive in the social and behavioral sciences by the 1980s. Social network analysis is\nnow one of the major paradigms in contemporary sociology, and is also employed\nin a number of other social and formal sciences. Together with other complex\nnetworks, it forms part of the nascent field of network science.\n","linknr":934,"url":"Social_network","recorded":1362509353,"links":73,"instances":["sociology","graph_theory","sociology","interpersonal","linguistics","social_and_political_philosophy","social_policy","philosophy_of_science","anthropology","sociology","sociology","philosophy","graph_theory"],"pdf":["http://www.nuffield.ox.ac.uk/users/hedstrom/ajs3.pdf"],"categories":["Communication
