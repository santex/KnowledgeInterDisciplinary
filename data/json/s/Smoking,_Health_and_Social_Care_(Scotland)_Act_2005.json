{"cursor":"3287","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The 'Smoking, Health and Social Care (Scotland) Act 2005' (asp 13) is an Act\npassed by the Scottish Parliament in 2005, after being introduced by Scottish\nExecutive Health minister Andy Kerr.\n\nThe Act established that, from 26 March 2006, it would be an offence to smoke in\nany wholly or substantially enclosed public space in Scotland, with a small\nnumber of exceptions, such as prisons, care homes and police interview rooms.\nPrivate member clubs weere not exempted. Hotel rooms could be designated by the\nproprietors as smoking rooms, but they were under no obligation to do so, and if\nthey did not, the Act applied to them as any other space.\n\nIt passed on 30 June 2005 with an 83 to 15 vote, with only the Scottish\nConservative and Unionist Party opposing, and received Royal Assent on 5\nAugust 2005.\n\nSince the ban came into force on 26 March 2006, it has been largely accepted by\nthe vast majority of the Scottish public.\n[http://www.clearingtheairscotland.com/latest/index.html/ Compliance rates] have\nbeen high, and as of 14 June 2006, only one premises has been fined for\npermitting smoking, and that happened on the day the Act came into being.\nAdditionally, the Swallow Group of hotels, who had launched a legal challenge to\nthe legislation, formally abandoned their attempt on the 13 June 2006, after\nbeing advised that it would not succeed.\n\nCigarette litter continues to be a problem outside premises, especially bars and\nrestaurants, and Environmental Health Officers have become more proactive in\nfining people dropping cigarette ends. Phone calls to Smokeline (a smoking\nsupport line run by NHS Health Scotland) increased before and after the ban and\nsmoking cessation services have reported that their number of clients has\nincreased since the ban.\n\n[http://www.ashscotland.org.uk/ ASH Scotland] was one of the main campaigners\nfor smoke-free legislation, and recognition of their role was confirmed when\nMaureen Moore (Chief Executive of ASH Scotland) received an OBE in June 2006 for\nservices to health care.\n\nSmoking in enclosed public spaces was later banned in England and Wales by the\nHealth Act 2006, and in Northern Ireland by the Smoking (Northern Ireland)\nOrder 2006.\n","linknr":172,"url":"Smoking,_Health_and_Social_Care_(Scotland)_Act_2005","recorded":1375055885,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Smoking,_Health_and_Social_Care_(Scotland)_Act_2005&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Smoking,_Health_and_Social_Care_(Scotland)_Act_2005&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Act_of_the_Scottish_Parliament","/wiki/Scottish_Parliament","/wiki/Scottish_Executive","/wiki/Andy_Kerr_(Scottish_politician)","/wiki/Tobacco_smoking","/wiki/Scotland","/wiki/Prison","/wiki/Club","/wiki/Hotel","/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)","/wiki/Royal_Assent","http://www.clearingtheairscotland.com/latest/index.html/","/wiki/NHS_Health_Scotland","http://www.ashscotland.org.uk/","/wiki/Health_Act_2006","/w/index.php?title=Smoking_(Northern_Ireland)_Order_2006&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Smoking,_Health_and_Social_Care_(Scotland)_Act_2005&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Smoking_ban","/wiki/Tobacco_Control","/w/index.php?title=Smoking,_Health_and_Social_Care_(Scotland)_Act_2005&action=edit&section=2","http://www.clearingtheairscotland.com/","http://www.tobaccoinscotland.org.uk/","http://www.ashscotland.org.uk/","http://www.legislation.gov.uk//asp/2005/13","/wiki/UK_Statute_Law_Database","/wiki/Template:UK_legislation","/wiki/Template_talk:UK_legislation","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:UK_legislation&action=edit","/wiki/United_Kingdom_legislation","/wiki/List_of_English_statutes","/wiki/Act_of_Parliament","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_England_to_1483","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_England,_1485%E2%80%931601","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_England,_1603%E2%80%931641","/wiki/List_of_Ordinances_and_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_England,_1642%E2%80%931660","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_England,_1660%E2%80%931699","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_England,_1700%E2%80%931706","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_Scotland_to_1707","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_Ireland_to_1700","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_Ireland,_1701%E2%80%931800","/wiki/Kingdom_of_Great_Britain","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_Great_Britain,_1707%E2%80%931719","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_Great_Britain,_1720%E2%80%931739","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_Great_Britain,_1740%E2%80%931759","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_Great_Britain,_1760%E2%80%931779","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_Great_Britain,_1780%E2%80%931800","/wiki/United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland","/wiki/United_Kingdom","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom,_1801%E2%80%931819","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom,_1820%E2%80%931839","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom,_1840%E2%80%931859","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom,_1860%E2%80%931879","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom,_1880%E2%80%931899","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom,_1900%E2%80%931919","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom,_1920%E2%80%931939","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom,_1940%E2%80%931959","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom,_1960%E2%80%931979","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom,_1980%E2%80%931999","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom,_2000%E2%80%93present","/wiki/Church_of_England","/wiki/List_of_Church_of_England_Measures","/wiki/Church_of_England_Assembly_(Powers)_Act_1919","/wiki/Devolution","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Scottish_Parliament_from_1999","/wiki/List_of_Acts_and_Measures_of_the_National_Assembly_for_Wales","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Northern_Ireland_Assembly","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_Northern_Ireland","/wiki/List_of_Orders_in_Council_for_Northern_Ireland","/wiki/Delegated_legislation_in_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Statutory_Instrument_(UK)","/wiki/Scottish_Statutory_Instrument","/wiki/Act_of_Sederunt","/wiki/File:Flag_of_Scotland.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/10/Flag_of_Scotland.svg/30px-Flag_of_Scotland.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/Scale_of
