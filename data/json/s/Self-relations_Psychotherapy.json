{"cursor":"7636","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Self-relationship' is an aspect of psychotherapy which describes and focusses\non the crucial relationship between a person and their own self. Formally\ndescribed in Stephen Gilligan's article: The relational self: the expanding of\nlove beyond desire (1996), and expanded on in his book: The Courage to Love\n(1997), it has become a major new approach in psychotherapy and healing. It\nrefers to a form of support, help, and assistance, usually found in\npsychotherapy and other therapeutic contexts, but also found in executive\ncoaching, community building, and other forms of healing.\n\nIt takes as its starting point, that 'symptoms' are most often the sign of\nsomething trying to \"wake up\" within a person, causing both visible and hidden\nconflict. It views symptoms such as violence and withdrawal, as born of a \"skill-\nless\" attempt to awaken oneself. Self-relationship asserts that therapeutic work\nshould always be centered on supporting this awakening process, allowing and\nhelping it to grow, rather than immediately practicing specific 'techniques' to\n'fix' or eradicate symptoms.\n\nAccordingly, although self-relationship draws upon many distinct schools and\ntraditions of therapy and healing, it works primarily with the flow of life, to\nawaken 'soul' and love in a person's experience of themselves and others. It\ndraws upon other traditions of guidance and awakening so that powerful human\nexperiences can be used to guide someone's process of self-awakening, which can\noften feel painful and confused.\n","linknr":101,"url":"Self-relations_Psychotherapy","recorded":1363501264,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Self-relations_Psychotherapy&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Self-relations_Psychotherapy&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/Psychotherapy","/wiki/Stephen_Gilligan","/wiki/Psychotherapy","/wiki/Psychotherapy","/wiki/Healing","/wiki/Symptom","/wiki/Soul","/wiki/Love","#Introduction","#Perspectives_on_self-relationship_and_sponsorship","#Stephen_Gilligan.27s_description_of_self-relationship","#Self_relationship_vs_support","#Working_with_third_parties","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Self-relations_Psychotherapy&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Stephen_Gilligan","/wiki/Milton_H._Erickson","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/Hypnotherapy","/wiki/Hypnotherapy","/wiki/Consciousness","/wiki/Sponsor_(commercial)","/wiki/Psychotherapy","/w/index.php?title=Self-relations_Psychotherapy&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=Self-relations_Psychotherapy&action=edit&section=3","http://www.erickson-foundation.org/Newsletter-old/top_gillig.htm","/w/index.php?title=Self-relations_Psychotherapy&action=edit&section=4","/w/index.php?title=Self-relations_Psychotherapy&action=edit&section=5","/w/index.php?title=Self-relations_Psychotherapy&action=edit&section=6","/w/index.php?title=Self-relations_Psychotherapy&action=edit&section=7","http://www.stephengilligan.com","http://www.seishindo.org/articles/st_gilligan1.htm","http://www.erickson-foundation.org/Newsletter-old/top_gillig.htm","http://www.hal-pc.org/~boha/sr.html","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Self-relations_Psychotherapy&oldid=401362590","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Psychotherapy","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Self-relations+Psychotherapy&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Self-relations+Psychotherapy","/wiki/Self-relations_Psychotherapy","/wiki/Talk:Self-relations_Psychotherapy","#","/wiki/Self-relations_Psychotherapy","/w/index.php?title=Self-relations_Psychotherapy&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Self-relations_Psychotherapy&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Self-relations_Psychotherapy","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Self-relations_Psychotherapy","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Self-relations_Psychotherapy&oldid=401362590","/w/index.php?title=Self-relations_Psychotherapy&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Self-relations_Psychotherapy&id=401362590","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Self-relations+Psychotherapy","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Self-relations+Psychotherapy&oldid=401362590&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Self-relations_Psychotherapy&printable=yes","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-relations_Psychotherapy","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=skins.vector&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","/w/index.php?title=MediaWiki:Gadget-ReferenceTooltips.js&action=raw&ctype=text/javascript&508635914","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wik
