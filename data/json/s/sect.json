Although in past it was mostly\nused to refer to religious groups, it has since expanded and in modern culture\ncan refer to any organization that breaks away from a larger one to follow a\ndifferent set of rules and principles. The term is occasionally used in a\nmalicious way to suggest the broken-off group follows a more negative path than\nthe original. The historical usage of the term sect in Christendom has had\npejorative connotations, referring to a group or movement with heretical beliefs\nor practices that deviate from those of groups considered orthodox.<ref>Wilson,\nBryan Religion in Sociological Perspective 1982, ISBN 0-19-826664-2 Oxford\nUniversity Press page 89<br>\"In English, it is a term that designates a\nreligiously separated group, but in its historical usage in Christendom it\ncarried a distinctly pejorative connotation.
