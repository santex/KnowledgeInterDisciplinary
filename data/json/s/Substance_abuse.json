Substance\nabuse/drug abuse is not limited to mood-altering or psycho-active drugs. If an\nactivity is performed using the objects against the rules and policies of the\nmatter (as in steroids for performance enhancement in sports), it is also called\nsubstance abuse. Therefore, mood-altering and psychoactive substances are not\nthe only types of drugs abused. Using illicit drugs â narcotics, stimulants,\ndepressants (sedatives), hallucinogens, cannabis, even glues and paints, are\nalso considered to be classified as drug/substance abuse.\nSubstance abuse often includes problems with impulse control and impulsive\nbehaviour.\n\nThe term \"drug abuse\" does not exclude dependency, but is otherwise used in a\nsimilar manner in nonmedical contexts. The terms have a huge range of\ndefinitions related to taking a psychoactive drug or performance enhancing drug\nfor a non-therapeutic or non-medical effect. All of these definitions imply a\nnegative judgment of the drug use in question (compare with the term responsible\ndrug use for alternative views). Some of the drugs most often associated with\nthis term include alcohol, amphetamines, barbiturates, benzodiazepines\n(particularly temazepam, nimetazepam, and flunitrazepam), cocaine, methaqualone,\nand opioids. Use of these drugs may lead to criminal penalty in addition to\npossible physical, social, and psychological harm, both strongly depending on\nlocal jurisdiction. (2002). Mosby's Medical, Nursing, & Allied\nHealth Dictionary. Sixth Edition. Drug abuse definition, p. 552. Nursing\ndiagnoses, p. 2109. ISBN 0-323-01430-5. There are many cases in which\ncriminal or antisocial behavior occur when the person is under the influence of\na drug. Long term personality changes in individuals may occur as well. Other definitions of drug abuse fall into four main categories:\npublic health definitions, mass communication and vernacular usage, medical\ndefinitions, and political and criminal justice definitions. Substance abuse is\nprevalent with an estimated 120 million users of hard drugs such as cocaine,\nheroin and other synthetic drugs.\n\nSubstance abuse is a form of substance-related disorder.\n","linknr":1112,"url":"Substance_abuse","recorded":1362689043,"links":60,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.cfdp.ca/bchoc.pdf","http://www.cfdp.ca/bchoc.pdf","http://www.ncjrs.gov/ondcppubs/publications/pdf/economic_costs.pdf","http://www.bentham.org/cdar/openaccsesarticle/cdar%201-3/0002CDAR.pdf","http://www.bentham.org/cdar/openaccsesarticle/cdar%201-3/0002CDAR.pdf","http://monitoringthefuture.org/pubs/monographs/mtf-overview2010.pdf","http://www.who.int/entity/substance_abuse/publications/global_status_report_2004_overview.pdf","http://www.apa.org/divisions/div12/est/newrpt.pdf","http://www.apa.org/divisions/div12/est/newrpt.pdf","http://baojournal.com/Health%20Journal/JBAHSFM-2-1.pdf","http://cac.hhd.org/pdf/edc_final_report_11_27_06.pdf","http://tx.technion.ac.il/~yeldad/forgone_ppr_revised2.pdf"],"categories":["Public
