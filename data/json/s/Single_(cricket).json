{"cursor":"1523","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nIn the sport of cricket, a 'single' is scored when the batsman take one run,\neither following a successful shot (with the run attributed to the on-strike\nbatsman) or when running for a bye or leg bye (counted as an extra).\n\nUnlike when a boundary is hit (and the run are scored even if the batsmen don't\nleave their creases), scoring a single requires the batsmen to physically run\nbetween the wickets. This introduces the risk of being run out, so effective\ncommunication between the batsmen is vital. If one batsman attempts to run and\nthe other stays put, then a humiliating run out is likely, but quick and well\nattuned batsmen may be able to run \"quick singles\" when other batsmen wouldn't.\nIn general, singles are much easier to score when the field is set further out,\nbut bringing more fielders in makes it easier for the on-strike batsman to hit\nboundaries.\n\nSingles usually rotate the strike in a partnership, but because the bowling end\nchanges at the end of an over, singles deliberately only taken at the end of an\nover are used by quality batsmen to keep the strike when they are batting with\nthe tail-enders, who are unlikely to survive for long against quality bowling\nand whom an experienced batsman will normally try to protect.\n","linknr":89,"url":"Single_(cricket)","recorded":1362478792,"links":12,"instances":["cricket","cricket","cricket","cricket","cricket","cricket","cricket","cricket"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Cricket terminology"],"headings":[],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["run","cricket"],["batting","cricket"],["bye","cricket"],["extra","cricket"],["boundary","cricket"],["crease","cricket"],["fielding","cricket"],["partnership","cricket"]],"members":["batting","run","partnership","boundary","bye","extra","fielding","crease"],"related":["Sport","Cricket","Batsmen","Run_(cricket)","Batting_(cricket)","Bye_(cricket)","Leg_bye","Extra_(cricket)","Boundary_(cricket)","Crease_(cricket)","Wicket","Run_out","Fielding_(cricket)","Partnership_(cricket)"]}
