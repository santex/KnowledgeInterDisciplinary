One who sings is called a\n'singer' or 'vocalist'. Singers perform music (Arias, Recitatives, Songs, etc.)\nthat can be sung either with or without accompaniment by musical instruments.\nSinging is often done in a group of other musicians, such as in a choir of\nsingers with different voice ranges, or in an ensemble with instrumentalists,\nsuch as a rock group or baroque ensemble.\n\nIn many respects human song is a form of sustained speech, nearly anyone able to\nspeak can also sing. Singing can be formal or informal, arranged or improvised.\nIt may be done for pleasure, comfort, ritual, education, or profit. Excellence\nin singing may require time, dedication, instruction, and regular practice. If\npractice is done on a regular basis then the sounds are said to be more clear\nand strong.<ref name=\"Musicguides\"> {{cite book |pages=26 |series=Yehudi Menuhin\nmusic guides |title=Voice |editor-last=Falkner |editor-first=Keith\n|location=London |publisher=MacDonald Young |year=1983 |isbn=0-356-09099-X\n|oclc=10418423 }}</ref> Professional singers usually build their careers around\none specific musical genre, such as classical or rock.
