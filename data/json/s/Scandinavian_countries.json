{"cursor":"59514","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Scandinavia', Sami: Skadesi-suolu / SkaÄsuÃ¢l.}} is a historical cultural-\nlinguistic region in Northern Europe characterized by a common ethno-cultural\nGermanic heritage and related languages that includes the three kingdoms of\nDenmark, Norway, and Sweden. Modern Norway and Sweden proper are situated on the\nScandinavian Peninsula, whereas modern Denmark is situated on the Danish islands\nand Jutland. The term Scandinavia is usually used as a cultural term, but in\nEnglish usage, it is occasionally confused with the purely geographical term\n[[Scandinavian Peninsula]], which took its name from the cultural-linguistic\nconcept. The name Scandinavia historically referred\nvaguely to Scania. The terms Scandinavia and Scandinavian entered usage in the\n18th century as terms for the three Scandinavian countries, their peoples and\nassociated language and culture, being introduced by the early linguistic and\ncultural Scandinavist movement. Sometimes the term Scandinavia is also taken to\ninclude Iceland, the Faroe Islands, and Finland, on account of their historical\nassociation with the Scandinavian countries. Such usage,\nhowever, may be considered inaccurate in the area itself, where the term Nordic\ncountries instead refers to this broader group.\n\nThe southern and by far most populous regions of Scandinavia have a temperate\nclimate. Scandinavia extends to the north of the Arctic Circle, but has\nrelatively mild weather for its latitude due to the Gulf Stream. Much of the\nScandinavian mountains have an alpine tundra climate. There are many lakes\nand moraines, legacies of the last glacial period, which ended about ten\nmillennia ago.\n\nThe Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish languages form a dialect continuum and are\nknown as the Scandinavian languagesâall of which are considered mutually\nintelligible with one another. Faroese and Icelandic, sometimes referred to as\ninsular Scandinavian languages, are only intelligible with continental\nScandinavian languages to a very limited extent. Finnish and Sami languages are\nrelated to each other, as well as to Hungarian, Estonian and several minority\nlanguages spoken in Western Russia, but are entirely unrelated to Swedish,\nNorwegian and Danish. They do, however, include several words that have been\nadopted during the history from the neighboring languages, just as Swedish,\nspoken in Finland today, has borrowed from Finnish.\n\nThe vast majority of the human population of Scandinavia are Scandinavians,\ndescended from several (North) Germanic tribes who originally inhabited the\nsouthern part of Scandinavia and what is now northern Germany, who spoke a\nGermanic language that evolved into Old Norse and who were known as Norsemen in\nthe Early Middle Ages. The Vikings are popularly associated with Norse culture.\nThe Icelanders and the Faroese are to a significant extent, but not exclusively,\ndescended from peoples retroactively known as Scandinavians. The extreme north\nof Norway, Sweden and Finland, as well as the most North-Western part of Russia,\nis home to a minority of Sami.\n","linknr":962,"url":"Scandinavian_countries","recorded":1362374989,"links":240,"instances":["1660","meteorology","disambiguation","denmark","international","mythology","1645","historian"],"pdf":["http://www.carlaz.com/phd/cea_phd_abstract.pdf","http://www2.hu-berlin.de/ostseekolleg/virtual/online_pdf/paper3.pdf","http://www.arts.usyd.edu.au/departs/medieval/saga/pdf/346-mundal.pdf","http://www.stm.unipi.it/Clioh/tabs/libri/3/01-Halfdanarson_1-14.pdf"],"categories":["Scandinavia|"],"headings":["Terminology
