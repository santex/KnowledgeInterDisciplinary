{"cursor":"65087","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Self-organization' is a process where some form of global order or coordination\narises out of the local interactions between the components of an initially\ndisordered system. This process is spontaneous: it is not directed or controlled\nby any agent or subsystem inside or outside of the system; however, the laws\nfollowed by the process and its initial conditions may have been chosen or\ncaused by an agent. It is often triggered by random fluctuations that are\namplified by positive feedback. The resulting organization is wholly\ndecentralized or over all the components of the system. As such it is typically\nvery robust and able to survive and self-repair substantial damage or\nperturbations.\n\nSelf-organization occurs in a variety of physical, chemical, biological, social\nand cognitive systems. Common examples are crystallization, the emergence of\nconvection patterns in a liquid heated from below, chemical oscillators, the\ninvisible hand of the market, swarming in groups of animals, and the way neural\nnetworks learn to recognize complex patterns.\n","linknr":774,"url":"Self-organizing_systems","recorded":1362476967,"links":51,"instances":["topology","cellular_automaton","physics","behavior","biology","haken","biology","mechanics","cybernetics","sociodynamics","anonymity_network","physics","physics","chemistry","disambiguation","thermodynamics"],"pdf":["http://csis.pace.edu/~marchese/CS396x/Computing/Ashby.pdf","http://e1020.pbworks.com/f/fulltext.pdf","http://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1203/1203.6681.pdf","http://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1004/1004.3518.pdf","http://www.mindspring.com/~noetic.advanced.studies/Amoroso1.pdf","http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/papers/EOLSS-Self-Organiz.pdf","http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/papers/EOLSS-Self-Organiz.pdf","http://www.ai.rug.nl/%7Ebart/deBoerThesis.pdf"],"categories":["Cybernetics","Self-organization|","Sociocultural
