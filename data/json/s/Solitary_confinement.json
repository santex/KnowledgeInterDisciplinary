{"cursor":"22328","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\n'Solitary confinement' is a special form of imprisonment in which a prisoner is\nisolated from any human contact, though often with the exception of members of\nprison staff. It is sometimes employed as a form of punishment beyond\nincarceration for a prisoner and has been cited as an additional measure of\nprotection from the inmate or is given for violations of prison regulations. It\nis also used as a form of protective custody and to implement a suicide watch.\n\nSolitary confinement is colloquially referred to in American English as \"the\nhotbox\", \"the hole\", \"lockdown\", \"SCU\" (Solitary Confinement Unit), \"AdSeg\"\n(Administrative Segregation), the \"SHU\" (pronounced 'shoe')âan acronym for\nsecurity housing unit, or \"the pound\"; and in British English as \"the block\" or\n\"the cooler\". In Canada they are known as a Special\nHandling Unit.\n","linknr":428,"url":"Solitary_confinement","recorded":1362584972,"links":37,"instances":["torture"],"pdf":["http://www.bop.gov/locations/institutions/mcr/MCR_visit_hours.pdf","http://law.wustl.edu/Journal/22/p325Grassian.pdf","http://www.thecrimereport.org/system/storage/2/ba/7/757/232973.pdf","http://www.prisoncommission.org/pdfs/Confronting_Confinement.pdf","http://www.prisoncommission.org/pdfs/Confronting_Confinement.pdf","http://www.auilr.org/pdf/21/21-1-5.pdf","http://www.auilr.org/pdf/21/21-1-5.pdf","http://solitarywatch.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/fact-sheet-psychological-effects-of-solitary-confinement2.pdf","http://solitarywatch.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/fact-sheet-psychological-effects-of-solitary-confinement2.pdf","http://www.prisoncommission.org/statements/grassian_stuart_long.pdf"],"categories":["Forensic psychology","Penal imprisonment","Torture","Human rights by issue"],"headings":["History","Use","Solitary confinement in the United States","Solitary confinement in the UK","Effects","Criticism","Actions","Alternatives","Proponents","References","External links","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Ambox_globe_content.svg/48px-Ambox_globe_content.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/12px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/Scale_of_justice_2.svg/16px-Scale_of_justice_2.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["the_box","torture"]],"members":["the_box"],"related":["Prisoner","Protective_custody","Suicide_watch","American_English","British_English","Special_Handling_Unit","Quakers","Calvinists","Hanging","Pedophilia","Witnesses","Supermax","Federal_Bureau_of_Prisons","California_Department_of_Corrections_and_Rehabilitation","Center_for_Constitutional_Rights","England_and_Wales","Massachusetts_Correctional_Institution_–_Cedar_Junction","Colorado_Department_of_Corrections","United_States_Department_of_Justice","John_Joseph_Gibbons","Nicholas_Katzenbach","Psychological_torture","Thomas_Silverstein","Marion,_Illinois","Prison-industrial_complex","Cruel_and_unusual_punishment","Torture","Sensory_deprivation","Mental_illness","Existential_crisis","Crime_Delinquency","American_Civil_Liberties_Union","Human_Rights_Watch","United_Nations","Cultural_competence","History_of_United_States_Prison_Systems","Angola_Three","The_Box_(torture)","Prison_abolition_movement","Single-celling","United_States_Supreme_Court_cases_involving_mental_health"]}
