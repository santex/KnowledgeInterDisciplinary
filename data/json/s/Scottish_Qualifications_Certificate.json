The SQC is awarded by the Scottish Qualifications\nAuthority. It forms part of the wider array of qualifications available in the\nScottish education system, including Scottish Vocational Qualifications, Higher\nNational Certificates and Higher National Diplomas. Each level is fully\nintegrated with the Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework and the three\nupper levels are awarded UCAS Tariff Points.\n\nThe SQC recognises performance in National Qualifications, Higher National\nQualifications, Scottish Vocational Qualifications and other awards. As it is\nnot part of the National Qualifications Framework of England, Wales and Northern\nIreland, it is not available to state schools there, but students from other\nnations do study for the qualification.\n","linknr":97,"url":"Scottish_Qualifications_Certificate","recorded":1362583772,"links":10,"instances":["uk","scottish","education","scottish"],"pdf":[],"categories":["School qualifications","Educational qualifications in Scotland","Vocational education in Scotland"],"headings":["National Qualifications Levels and grades","See also","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["grade","education"],["advanced_level","uk"],["advanced_higher","scottish"],["higher","scottish"]],"members":["advanced_level","advanced_higher","grade","higher"],"related":["Scottish_Certificate_of_Education","Record_of_Education_and_Training","Scottish_Qualifications_Authority","Education_in_Scotland","Scottish_Vocational_Qualification","Higher_National_Certificate","Higher_National_Diploma","Scottish_Credit_and_Qualifications_Framework","UCAS","National_Qualifications_Framework","England","Wales","Northern_Ireland","State_school","Grade_(education)","General_Certificate_of_Secondary_Education","Advanced_Level_(UK)","Advanced_Higher_(Scottish)","Higher_(Scottish)","Intermediate_2","Intermediate_1","Education_in_Scotland","Learning_and_Teaching_Scotland","Scottish_Government"]}
