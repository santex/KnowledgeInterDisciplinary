{"cursor":"8466","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nA 'struct' in C programming language is a structured (record) type\nthat aggregates a fixed set of labelled objects, possibly of different types,\ninto a single object.\n\nA struct declaration consists of a list of fields, each of\nwhich can have any type. The total storage required for a struct\nobject is the sum of the storage requirements of all the fields, plus any\ninternal padding.\n\nFor example:  struct account { int account_number; char\n*first_name; char *last_name; float balance; }; \n\ndefines a type, referred to as struct account . To create a new variable\nof this type, we can write  struct account s;  which\nhas an integer component, accessed by s.account_number , and a floating-\npoint component, accessed by s.balance , as well as the\nfirst_name and last_name components. The structure s\ncontains all four values, and all four fields may be changed independently.\n\nThe primary use of a struct is for the construction of complex\ndatatypes, but in practice they are sometimes used to circumvent standard C\nconventions to create a kind of primitive subtyping. For example, common\nInternet protocols rely on the fact that C compilers insert padding between\nstruct fields in predictable ways; thus the code  struct\nifoo_version_42 { long x, y, z; char *name; long a, b, c; }; struct\nifoo_old_stub { long x, y; }; void operate_on_ifoo(struct ifoo_version_42 *);\nstruct ifoo_old_stub s;\n. . . operate_on_ifoo(&s); \n\nis often assumed to work as expected, if the operate_on_ifoo function\nonly accesses fields x and y of its argument.\n","linknr":123,"url":"Struct_(C_programming_language)","recorded":1362672755,"links":16,"instances":["computer_science"],"pdf":[],"categories":["C programming language"],"headings":["Struct initialization","Assignment","Pointers to struct","typedef","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["record","computer_science"]],"members":["record"],"related":["C_programming_language","Record_(computer_science)","Subtype","Typedef","Bit_field","Composite_data_type","Union_type"]}
