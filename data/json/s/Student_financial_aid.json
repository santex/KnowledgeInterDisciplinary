{"cursor":"39177","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Student financial aid in the United States' is funding that is intended to help\nstudents pay education-related expenses including tuition, fees, room and board,\nbooks, and supplies for education at a college, university, or private school.\nGeneral governmental funding in the form of subsidies for public education is\nnot called financial aid. Financial aid refers to awards to specific individual\nstudents. Certain governments, e.g. Nordic countries, provide student benefit. A\nscholarship is sometimes used as a synonym for a financial aid award, although\ngrants and student loans are also major components of financial aid packages\nfrom students' intended colleges.\n\nThe United States government and all U.S. state governments provide merit- and\nneed-based student aid including grants, work-study, and loans. As of 2010 there\nare nine federal and 605 state student aid programs and many of the nearly 7,000\npost-secondary institutions provide merit aid. Major federal grants include the\nPell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants, Federal Work-\nStudy Program, federal Stafford Loans (in subsidized and unsubsidized forms),\nstate student incentive grants and Federal PLUS Loans. Federal Perkins Loans are\nmade by participating schools per annual appropriations from the U.S. Department\nof Education. Federal Stafford Loans and Federal PLUS Loans are made by the U.S.\nDepartment of Education. As of April 2010, Congress voted to eliminate the\nFederal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP) which had allowed private lenders\nto make student loans guaranteed by the federal government.\n\nState governments also typically provide some types of need- and non-need-based\naid, consisting of grants, work-study programs, tuition waivers, and\nscholarships. Individual colleges and universities may provide grants and need-\nand merit-based scholarships. Students requiring financial aid beyond what is\noffered by their institutions may consider a private (alternative) education\nloan, available from most large lending institutions. Typically, education loans\nobtained through the federal government have lower interest rates than private\neducation loans. Institutions may also offer their own student financial\nassistance, in the form of need- or merit-based aid, as well as endowed\nscholarships (with varying need and/or merit-based criteria). Some institutions\nmay only require the FAFSA; some may also require a need-based analysis\ndocument, such as the CSS/Profile, to apply for such funds to apply a more\nstringent need analysis for the rationalization of institutional funds.\n","linknr":399,"url":"Student_financial_aid","recorded":1374539730,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Student_financial_aid_in_the_United_States&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Student_financial_aid_in_the_United_States&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","/wiki/Student_financial_aid_in_the_United_States","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","/w/index.php?title=Student_financial_aid&redirect=no","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Tuition","/wiki/Room_and_board","/wiki/College","/wiki/University","/wiki/Private_school","/wiki/Public_education","/wiki/Student_benefit","/wiki/Scholarship","/wiki/United_States_government","/wiki/Pell_Grant","/wiki/Federal_Supplemental_Educational_Opportunity_Grant","/wiki/Federal_Work-Study_Program","/wiki/Stafford_Loan","/wiki/PLUS_Loan","#Types_of_financial_aid_and_application_process","#Merit-based_aid","#Need-based_aid","#Merit-based_aid_versus_need-based_aid","#Common_financial_aid_misconceptions","#International_Students","#College_cost_calculators","#Debt_vs._grants","#No-loan_financial_aid","#Loan_cap","#Effect_of_Financial_Aid_on_Enrollment","#Need-blind_Admissions","#Outside_the_United_States","#See_also","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Student_financial_aid_in_the_United_States&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Free_Application_for_Federal_Student_Aid","/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Education","#cite_note-1","#cite_note-2","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Expected_Family_Contribution","/wiki/Pell_Grant","/w/index.php?title=TEACH_Grant&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Federal_Direct_Subsidized_Loan&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Federal_Direct_Unsubsidized_Loan&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Perkins_Loan","/w/index.php?title=Parent_PLUS_Loan&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/American_Opportunity_Tax_Credit","/wiki/Lifetime_Learning_Tax_Credit","/wiki/Expected_family_contribution","/w/index.php?title=Student_financial_aid_in_the_United_States&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Arizona_Legislature","/wiki/Arizona","#cite_note-4","/w/index.php?title=Student_financial_aid_in_the_United_States&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/FAFSA","#cite_note-5","#cite_note-6","#cite_note-7","/wiki/Asymmetric_information","#cite_note-8","/wiki/Arizona_Legislature","/wiki/Arizona_State_University","/wiki/University_of_Arizona","/wiki/Northern_Arizona_University","/wiki/Arizona_State","#cite_note-tucsonweekly.com-9","#cite_note-tucsonweekly.com-9","/w/index.php?title=Student_financial_aid_in_the_United_States&action=edit&section=4","#cite_note-Clemmitt-10","#cite_note-Clemmitt-10","#cite_note-11","/w/index.php?title=Student_financial_aid_in_the_United_States&action=edit&section=5","#cite_note-12","#cite_note-13","/w/index.php?title=Student_financial_aid_in_the_United_States&action=edit&section=6","/wiki/Uni_in_the_USA","#cite_note-uniintheusa.com-14","/wiki/Amherst_College","/wiki/Yale_University","/wiki/Dartmouth_College","/wiki/Princeton_University","/wiki/MIT","/wiki/Harvard_University","#cite_note-uniintheusa.com-14","/w/index.php?title=Student_financial_aid_in_the_United_States&action=edit&section=7","/wiki/College_cost_calculator","#cite_note-15","#cite_note-16","#cite_note-17","#cite_note-18","#cite_note-ticas.org-19","#cite_note-ticas.org-19","http://College%20Abacus","#cite_note-20","#cite_note-21","/w/index.php?title=Student_financial_aid_in_the_United_States&action=edit&section=8","/w/index.php?title=Student_financial_aid_in_the_United_States&action=edit&section=9","/wiki/Princeton_University","/wiki/Amherst_College","/wiki/Arizona_State_University","/wiki/Arizona","#cite_note-22","/wiki/Bowdoin_College","#cite_note-23","/wiki/Brown_University","#cite_note-24","/wiki/Caltech","#cite_note-25","/wiki/Claremont_McKenna_College","#cite_note-26","/wiki/Colby_College","#cite_note-27","/wiki/Columbia_University","#cite_note-28","/wiki/Cornell_University","/wiki/Dartmouth_College","#cite_note-29","/wiki/Davidson_College","/wiki/Duke_University","#cite_note-autogenerated3-30","/wiki/Emory_University","/wiki/Haverford_College","#cite_note-31","/wiki/Harvard_University","/wiki/Lafayette_College","#cite_note-32","/wiki/Lehigh_University","#cite_note-33","/wiki/MIT","#cite_note-34","/wiki/University_of_Maryland,_College_Park","#cite_note-autogenerated2-35","/wiki/Mic
