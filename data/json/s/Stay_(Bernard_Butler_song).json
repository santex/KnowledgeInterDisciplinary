It\nwas taken from the album [[People Move On]] and charted at number 12 on the UK\nSingles Chart.\n\nThe song begins with a gentle acoustic guitar, which leads into Butler's vocals.\nDrums, electric guitar, keyboards and backing vocals all get introduced\ngradually, before coming together in one last climax and quiet coda. Raggett, Ned. [ \"Stay single review\"]. Allmusic. Butler has\nsaid that \"Stay\" is not a love song but a song about change. \"The process of\nchange is hard but you've got to do it. It's about when you know you've got to\ndo something but there's an element of risk. It's about when I first went to\nFrance to record. A lot of the lyrics come from a conversation with Elisa, my\nwife. I wrote them on the train over to France.\" Author unknown. [http://www.nme.com/news/bernard-\nbutler/133 \"Butler's done it!\"]. NME.com 28 February 1998\n\nReception to Butler's dÃ©but single was very positive. Ned Raggett of Allmusic\nwrote: \"The long-awaited introduction of Butler to the music world as a\nsinger/songwriter is at once slightly tentative and quite promising. The title\ntrack is one of the more self-consciously grandiose things out there, but its\nbig advantage is that it builds rather than overwhelms.\"\nScottish Newspaper [[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]] declared it \"Single\nof the Week\" writing: \"Bernard is having to play catch up again after Suede got\ntheir act together with the classic 1996 LP [[Coming Up (album)|Coming Up]]. Now\nsigned to Oasis label Creation, his first solo single - on which he plays all\nthe instruments bar drums - sounds fabulous. Let's hope it's the first of\nmany.\n\nThe music video for the title song was directed by David Mould, whose directing\ncredits include Suede's \"Trash\", the first single released after Butler's\ndeparture.\n\nB-side \"Hotel Splendide\" features backing vocals from Edwyn Collins.\n","linknr":132,"url":"Stay_(Bernard_Butler_song)","recorded":1374862798,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Stay_(Bernard_Butler_song)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Stay_(Bernard_Butler_song)&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:BernardButlerStay.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/47/BernardButlerStay.jpg/220px-BernardButlerStay.jpg","/wiki/Single_(music)","/wiki/Bernard_Butler","/wiki/People_Move_On","/wiki/CD","/wiki/1998","/wiki/Music_genre","/wiki/Britpop","/wiki/Record_label","/wiki/Creation_Records","/wiki/Record_producer","/wiki/Bernard_Butler","/wiki/Not_Alone_(song)","/wiki/Bernard_Butler","/wiki/People_Move_On","/wiki/UK_Singles_Chart","#cite_note-1","#cite_note-AMG-2","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Allmusic","#cite_note-AMG-2","/wiki/Daily_Record_(Scotland)","/wiki/Suede_(band)","/wiki/Coming_Up_(album)","/wiki/Oasis_(band)","#cite_note-4","/wiki/Trash_(Suede_song)","/wiki/Edwyn_Collins","#cite_note-AMG-2","/w/index.php?title=Stay_(Bernard_Butler_song)&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Stay_(Bernard_Butler_song)&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-1","http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/_/bernard%20butler/","/wiki/Official_Charts_Company","#cite_ref-AMG_2-0","#cite_ref-AMG_2-1","#cite_ref-AMG_2-2","http://www.allmusic.com/album/r382291","/wiki/Allmusic","#cite_ref-3","http://www.nme.com/news/bernard-butler/133","/wiki/NME.com","#cite_ref-4","http://www.thefreelibrary.com/CHART+SLOT.-a061460492","/wiki/Daily_Record_(Scotland)","/wiki/The_Free_Library","/w/index.php?title=Stay_(Bernard_Butler_song)&action=edit&section=3","http://www.metrolyrics.com/stay-lyrics-bernard-butler.html","/wiki/MetroLyrics","/wiki/Template:Bernard_Butler","/wiki/Template_talk:Bernard_Butler","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Bernard_Butler&action=edit","/wiki/Bernard_Butler","/wiki/People_Move_On","/wiki/Friends_and_Lovers_(album)","/wiki/Not_Alone_(song)","/wiki/A_Change_of_Heart_(song)","/wiki/Suede_(band)","/wiki/The_Tears","/wiki/McAlmont_and_Butler","/wiki/Duffy_(singer)","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Stay_(Bernard_Butler_song)&oldid=561297146","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1998_singles","/wiki/Category:Songs_written_by_Bernard_Butler","/wiki/Category:Creation_Records_singles","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Stay+%28Bernard+Butler+song%29&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Stay+%28Bernard+Butler+song%29","/wiki/Stay_(Bernard_Butler_song)","/wiki/Talk:Stay_(Bernard_Butler_song)","#","/wiki/Stay_(Bernard_Butler_song)","/w/index.php?title=Stay_(Bernard_Butler_song)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Stay_(Bernard_Butler_song)&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Stay_(Bernard_Butler_song)","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Stay_(Bernard_Butler_song)","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Stay_(Bernard_Butler_song)&oldid=561297146","/w/index.php?title=Stay_(Bernard_Butler_song)&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7604988","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Stay_%28Bernard_Butler_song%29&id=561297146","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Stay+%28Bernard+Butler+song%29","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Stay+%28Bernard+Butler+song%29&oldid=561297146&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Stay_(Bernard_Butler_song)&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7604988#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses
