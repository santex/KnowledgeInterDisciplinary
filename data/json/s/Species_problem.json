{"cursor":"31308","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"{{Rquote|right| ... I was much struck how entirely vague and arbitrary is the\ndistinction between species and varieties| Charles Darwin|[[On the Origin of\nSpecies]] (p.Â 48) }}\n\nThe 'species problem' is a mixture of difficult, related questions that often\ncome up when biologists define the word \"species\". Definitions are usually based\non how individual organisms reproduce, but biological reality means that a\ndefinition that works well for some organisms (e.g., birds) will be useless for\nothers (e.g., bacteria).\n\nOne common but sometimes difficult question is how best to decide which species\nan organism belongs to, because reproductively isolated groups may not be\nreadily recognizable. Thus, new data may indicate that one previously described\nspecies actually includes two or more separately evolving groups, each of which\ncould justifiably be recognized as a separate species.\n\nAnother common problem is how to define reproductive isolation, because some\nseparately evolving groups may continue to interbreed to some extent, and it can\nbe a difficult matter to discover whether this hybridization affects the long-\nterm genetic make-up of the groups.\n\nMany of the debates on species touch on philosophical issues, such as nominalism\nand realism, as well as on issues of language and cognition.\n\nThe current meaning of the phrase \"species problem\" is quite different from what\nwas meant by \"species problem\" during the 19th and early 20th centuries, as used\nby Charles Darwin and others. For Darwin the species problem was the\nquestion of how new species arose: speciation.\n","linknr":435,"url":"Species_problem","recorded":1362483534,"links":27,"instances":["biology"],"pdf":["https://webspace.utexas.edu/deverj/personal/test/species.pdf","https://webspace.utexas.edu/deverj/personal/test/species.pdf","http://www.ucl.ac.uk/taxome/jim/pap/malletjeb01.pdf","http://www.ucl.ac.uk/taxome/jim/pap/malletjeb01.pdf","http://www.phylosophy.org/Hull-Individuality-PoS1978.pdf","http://www.phylosophy.org/Hull-Individuality-PoS1978.pdf","http://stanford.edu/~joelv/teaching/167/ereshefsky%2092%20-%20eliminative%20pluralism.pdf","http://stanford.edu/~joelv/teaching/167/ereshefsky%2092%20-%20eliminative%20pluralism.pdf"],"categories":["Scientific classification","Species problem"],"headings":["Confusion on the meaning of \"''Species''\"","History","Philosophical aspects","Quotations on the species problem","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg/20px-Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Wikispecies-logo.svg/34px-Wikispecies-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["hybrid","biology"]],"members":["hybrid"],"related":["Charles_Darwin","Biologist","Species","Organism","Evolution","Hybrid_(biology)","Nominalism","Philosophical_realism","Language","Cognitive","Charles_Darwin","Speciation","Species","Scientific_classification","Baltimore_Oriole","Bullock's_Oriole","Ernst_Mayr","PDF","John_Ray","Linnaeus","Taxon","Binomial_nomenclature","Charles_Darwin","Evolution","Speciation","Gradualism","Gregor_Mendel","Natural_selection","Modern_evolutionary_synthesis","Edward_Bagnall_Poulton","Theodosius_Dobzhansky","Ernst_Mayr","Reproductive_isolation","Ernst_Mayr","Georges-Louis_Leclerc,_Comte_de_Buffon","Dobzhansky","Speciation","Systematics","Operational","Platonic_realism","Nominalism","Taxonomic","Mountain","Snowflake","Platonic_realism","Michael_Ghiselin","Entity","Wittgenstein","Family_resemblance","Jody_Hey","Jody_Hey","Monism","Scientific_pluralism","David_Hull","Pigliucci","Neontology","Palaeontology","Evolutionarily_Significant_Unit","Ring_species"]}
