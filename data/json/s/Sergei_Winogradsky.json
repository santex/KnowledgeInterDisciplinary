He reported that Beggiatoa oxidized hydrogen sulfide\n(H 2S) as an energy source and formed intracellular sulfur\ndroplets. This research provided the first example of lithotrophy,\nbut not autotrophy.\n\nHis research on nitrifying bacteria would report the first known form of\nchemoautotrophy, showing how a lithotroph fixes carbon dioxide (CO 2)\nto make organic compounds.\n","linknr":250,"url":"Sergei_Winogradsky","recorded":1362505889,"links":32,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["1856 births","1953 deaths","Environmental microbiology","Foreign Members of the Royal Society","Nitrogen metabolism","Russian biochemists","Russian microbiologists","Russian biologists","Russian ecologists","Ukrainian biochemists","Ukrainian microbiologists","Ukrainian biologists","Ukrainian ecologists","Soil scientists","Ukrainian soil scientists","Leeuwenhoek Medal winners"],"headings":["Biography","Discoveries","References","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b5/Sergei_Winogradsky.jpg/220px-Sergei_Winogradsky.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/Nitrogen_Cycle.svg/350px-Nitrogen_Cycle.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Kiev","Ukraine","Russian_Empire","Brie-Comte-Robert","Microbiology","Saint_Petersburg_Conservatory","University_of_Saint_Petersburg","University_of_Strasbourg","Pasteur_Institute","University_of_Saint_Petersburg","Nitrogen_cycle","Chemotroph","Beggiatoa","Anton_de_Bary","Nikolai_Menshutkin","Martinus_Beijerinck","Selman_Waksman","Martinus_Beijerinck","Leeuwenhoek_Medal","Fellow_of_the_Royal_Society","ForMemRS","Ukrainians","Microbiologist","Ecologist","Soil_science","Biogeochemical_cycle","Lithotrophy","Hydrogen_sulfide","Sulfur","Autotrophy","Nitrifying_bacteria","Chemotroph","Carbon_fixation","Organic_compound","Kiev","Russian_Empire","Saint_Petersburg_Conservatory","University_of_Saint_Petersburg","Menshutkin_reaction","Andrei_Famintsyn","St._Petersburg_University","University_of_Strasbourg","Anton_de_Bary","Zurich","Ammonium","Nitrite","Nitrate","Moscow_Society_of_Naturalists","French_Academy_of_Sciences","Pasteur_Institute","Brie-Comte-Robert","Nitrogen_fixation","Cellulose","Biogeochemical_cycle","Sulfur_cycle","Lithotrophy","Beggiatoa","Nitrogen_cycle","Obligate_anaerobe","Legume","Root_nodule","Chemosynthesis","Inorganic_compound","Carbon","Carbon_dioxide","Light","Phototroph","Microorganisms","Microbial_ecology","Environmental_microbiology","Winogradsky_column","Selman_Waksman","Microbiology","Kiev","Russian_Empire","Brie-Comte-Robert"]}
