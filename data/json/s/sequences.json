      "text" : "\n\n\nIn mathematics, informally speaking, a 'sequence' is an ordered list of objects\n(or events). Like a set, it contains members (also called elements, or terms).\nThe number of ordered elements (possibly infinite) is called the length of the\nsequence. Unlike a set, order matters, and exactly the same elements can appear\nmultiple times at different positions in the sequence. Most precisely, a\nsequence can be defined as a function whose domain is a countable totally\nordered set, such as the natural numbers.\n\nFor example, (M, A, R, Y) is a sequence of letters with the letter 'M' first and\n'Y' last. This sequence differs from (A, R, M, Y). Also, the sequence (1, 1, 2,\n3, 5, 8), which contains the number 1 at two different positions, is a valid\nsequence. Sequences can be [[finite set|finite]], as in this example, or\n[[Infinite set|infinite]], such as the sequence of all even positive integers\n(2, 4, 6,...). Finite sequences are sometimes known as strings or words and\ninfinite sequences as streams. The empty sequence&nbsp;(&nbsp;) is included in\nmost notions of sequence, but may be excluded depending on the context.\n. It is, however, bounded.]]\n",
