In the USA a sloop may have one, two\nor three head-sails forward of the mastâ€”the term cutter not generally being used\nfor sailboats. In the rest of the English speaking world, a sloop has only one\nhead-sail and if a vessel has two or more head-sails, she is termed a 'cutter'\nand her mast may be set further aft than on a sloop.\n\nThe commonest rig of modern sailboats is the Bermuda sloop. Typically, a modern\nsloop carries a mainsail on a boom aft of the mast, with a single loose-footed\nhead-sail (a jib or a genoa jib) forward of the mast.\n\nSloops are either masthead-rigged or fractional-rigged. On a masthead-rigged\nsloop, the forestay (on which the headsail is carried) attaches at the top of\nthe mast. The mainsail may be smaller than the headsail, which is then called a\ngenoa jib. On a fractional-rigged sloop, the forestay attaches to the mast at a\npoint below the top, typically 3/4 of the way to top, or perhaps 7/8 or some\nother fraction. The mast of a fractional-rigged sloop may be placed farther\nforward, and compared to a masthead-rigged sloop, this results in a rather\nsmaller jib relative to the size of the mainsail.\n","title":"Sloop","headings":["Rationale behind the sloop rig","Sails carried","See also","Notes","Bibliography","External links"]},"micro-relation":["7: Royal_Navy","4: Bermuda_rig","3: Bermuda","2: Jib","2: Ketch","2: Yawl","2: Spinnaker","2: Guglielmo_Marconi","2: Frigate","2: Corvette","2: Second_World_War","1: Dutch_language","1: French_language","1: Sail_boat","1: Fore-and-aft_rig","1: Aft","1: Mainsail","1: Loose-footed","1: Schooner","1: Length_Over_All","1: Winch","1: Sailcloth","1: Close_hauled","1: Foresail","1: Gennaker","1: Gaff_rig","1: Lateen_rig","1: Cedrus","1: Careening","1: Sloop-of-war","1: Bermuda_sloop","1: Privateer","1: Ship-of-the-line","1: Horatio_Nelson","1: Battle_of_Trafalgar","1: Hampton_Roads","1: War_of_1812","1: U.S._Navy","1: World_War_I","1: World_War_II","1: French_Navy","1: Blockade_runner","1: Blockade","1: Harbor","1: Wireless","1: International_Americas_Cup_Class","1: America's_Cup","1: Volvo_Ocean_Race","1: Carbon_fiber_reinforced_plastic","1: Joshua_Slocum","1: Sloop_John&nbsp;B","1: The_Beach_Boys","1: Barrett's_Privateers","1: Stan_Rogers","1: Mast_aft_rig"]}
