Sinks generally have taps (faucets) that supply\nhot and cold water and may include a spray feature to be used for faster\nrinsing. They also include a drain to remove used water; this drain may itself\ninclude a strainer and/or shut-off device and an overflow-prevention device.\nSinks may also have an integrated soap dispenser.\n\nWhen a sink becomes stopped-up or clogged, a person will often resort to use a\nchemical drain cleaner or a plunger, though most professional plumbers will\nattack the clog with a drain auger (often called a \"plumber's snake\").\n","linknr":238,"url":"Sink","recorded":1362372035,"links":54,"instances":["manufacturing","valve","power_tool","substance","plumbing","geology","manufacturing"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Plumbing","Bathrooms"],"headings":["Materials of the sink","Styles","Ceramic basin construction","Accessories","Gallery","See also","References","Bibliography"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/66/Sink.png/220px-Sink.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Belfast_sink.jpg/220px-Belfast_sink.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Stainless_Steel_Sink.jpg/220px-Stainless_Steel_Sink.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/24/Sink.jpg/220px-Sink.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/75/Sinks_in_a_public_toilet%2C_Edinburgh%2C_Scotland.JPG/120px-Sinks_in_a_public_toilet%2C_Edinburgh%2C_Scotland.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Bell-krater_louterion_Louvre_CA1341.jpg/120px-Bell-krater_louterion_Louvre_CA1341.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/White_glass_basins.jpg/120px-White_glass_basins.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/Multi_user_sink.jpg/120px-Multi_user_sink.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["tap","valve"],["rock","geology"],["drawing","manufacturing"],["die","manufacturing"],["caustic","substance"],["jigsaw","power_tool"],["tap","valve"],["tap","valve"],["trap","plumbing"]],"members":["drawing","tap","jigsaw","caustic","trap","rock","die"],"related":["Kitchen","Plumbing_fixture","Hands","Dishwashing","Tap_(valve)","Soap","Drain_cleaner","Plunger","Plumber's_snake","Stainless_steel","Vitreous_enamel_","Steel","Cast_iron","Ceramic","Marble","Plastic","Soapstone","Concrete","Terrazzo","Wood","Rock_(geology)","Copper","Glass","Granite","Trade-off","Drawing_(manufacturing)","Sheet_metal","Die_(manufacturing)","Welding","Noise","Spall","Thermoplastic","Acrylic_glass","Frying_pan","Countertop","Sandpaper","Caustic_(substance)","Teak","Terrazzo","Aesthetics","Flower","Wood","Jigsaw_(power_tool)","Silicone","Ergonomics","Welding","Grinding_machine","Weir","Tap_(valve)","Public_restroom","Drainboard","Public_toilet","Edinburgh","Ancient_Greece","Red-figure_pottery","Krater","Boeotia","Dipper_well","Domestic_water_system","Floor_plan","Garbage_disposal","Plumbing","Plumbing_fixture","Proverbial_kitchen_sink","Tap_(valve)","Trap_(plumbing)"]}
