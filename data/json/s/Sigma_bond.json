{"cursor":"5639","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nIn chemistry, 'sigma bonds' ('Ï bonds') are the strongest type of covalent\nchemical bond. They are formed by head-on overlapping between\natomic orbitals. Sigma bonding is most clearly defined for diatomic molecules\nusing the language and tools of symmetry groups. In this formal approach, a\nÏ-bond is symmetrical with respect to rotation about the bond axis. By this\ndefinition, common forms of sigma bonds are s+s, p z+p z,\ns+p z and d z2 +d z2 (where\nz is defined as the axis of the bond). Quantum theory also\nindicates that molecular orbitals (MO) of identical symmetry actually mix. As\na practical consequence of this mixing of diatomic molecules, the\nwavefunctions s+s and p z+p z molecular orbitals become\nblended. The extent of this mixing (or blending) depends on the relative\nenergies of the like-symmetry MO's.\n\nFor homodiatomics, bonding Ï orbitals have no nodal planes between the bonded\natoms. The corresponding ''anti''bonding, or Ï* orbital, is defined by the\npresence of a nodal plane between these two bonded atoms.\n\nSigma bonds are the strongest type of covalent bonds due to the direct overlap\nof orbitals, and the electrons in these bonds are sometimes referred to as sigma\nelectrons.\n\nThe symbol Ï is the Greek letter sigma (s). When viewed down the bond axis, a Ï\nMO resembles an s atomic orbital. ]]\n","linknr":213,"url":"Sigma_bond","recorded":1362665093,"links":36,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Chemical bonding"],"headings":["Sigma bonds in polyatomic compounds","Sigma bonds in multiple-bonded species","Sigma bonds in organic molecules","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/Sigma_bond.svg/250px-Sigma_bond.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/Electron_orbitals_crop.svg/250px-Electron_orbitals_crop.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["chromium(ii_acetate"]],"members":[],"related":["Chemistry","Covalent_bond","Chemical_bond","Diatomic_molecules","Symmetry_group","Molecular_orbital","Wavefunction","Molecular_orbital","Antibond","Covalent_bond","Electron","Electron_configuration","Atomic_orbital","Propane","Dihydrogen_complex","Chromium(II)_acetate","Cyclic_compound","Benzene","Hydrogen_gas","Ammonia","Pi_bond","Delta_bond","Molecular_geometry","Covalent_bond","Ionic_bond"]}
