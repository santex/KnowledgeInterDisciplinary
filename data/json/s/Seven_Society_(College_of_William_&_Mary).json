[http://www.fiskeguide.com Fiske Guide\nTo Colleges], Twenty-Sixth Edition, Sourcebooks, Inc., 2010. The clandestine, yet altruistic group is said to consist of\nseven senior individuals , selected in their junior year. While, historically, graduating members\nformally announced their identities each spring, today's membership is steeped\nin mystery and is only revealed upon a member's death.\n\nNow rumored to meet late at night in Colonial Williamsburg's\n[http://www.history.org/visit/diningExperience/shields/index.cfm Shields\nTavern], present-day Sevens are perhaps most noted for their\nefforts to honor and encourage those who help strengthen the university. Through\nits endowment association, the society pursues major philanthropic projects such\nas scholarships and anonymous donations to the College. Sevens have also been known to\nmysteriously leave small gifts and tokens of appreciation for unsuspecting\ngroups and individuals (e.g., in 2003, an Admissions Counselor discovered two\ndozen golf umbrellas â each adorned with the '7' symbol â after casually\nmentioning how helpful they'd be during rainy campus tours).\n","linknr":306,"url":"Seven_Society_(College_of_William_&_Mary)","recorded":1372153903,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Seven_Society_(College_of_William_%26_Mary)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Seven_Society_(College_of_William_%26_Mary)&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Seven_Society_(disambiguation)","/wiki/Secret_societies_at_the_College_of_William_%26_Mary","/wiki/College_of_William_%26_Mary","/wiki/Williamsburg,_Virginia","#cite_note-Fiske-1","#cite_note-fh7-2","#cite_note-fh3-3","#cite_note-fh4-4","#cite_note-fh5-5","#cite_note-secrets-6","/wiki/Colonial_Williamsburg","http://www.history.org/visit/diningExperience/shields/index.cfm","#cite_note-fh7-2","#cite_note-ur1-7","#cite_note-fh1-8","#cite_note-fh7-2","#cite_note-dsj1-9","#cite_note-dsj2-10","#History","#Motifs_and_symbols","#Tyler_and_The_Seven_Wise_Men","#Notable_20th_century_members","#See_also","#External_links","#References","/w/index.php?title=Seven_Society_(College_of_William_%26_Mary)&action=edit&section=1","#cite_note-fh4-4","#cite_note-ur1-7","/wiki/College_of_William_%26_Mary","/wiki/American_Civil_War","#cite_note-wise-11","#cite_note-fh1-8","#cite_note-fh2-12","/wiki/Flat_Hat_Club","/wiki/Honor_society","/wiki/Collegiate_secret_societies_in_North_America","/w/index.php?title=Seven_Society_(College_of_William_%26_Mary)&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/College_of_William_%26_Mary","/wiki/William_and_Mary","#cite_note-charter-13","#cite_note-law1-14","#cite_note-law2-15","#cite_note-quarterly-16","/wiki/Trustees","#cite_note-transfer1-17","#cite_note-transfer2-18","#cite_note-law1-14","#cite_note-law2-15","#cite_note-quarterly-16","#cite_note-19","#cite_note-20","/w/index.php?title=Seven_Society_(College_of_William_%26_Mary)&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/File:Lyon_Gardiner_Tyler_bust.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d3/Lyon_Gardiner_Tyler_bust.jpg/220px-Lyon_Gardiner_Tyler_bust.jpg","/wiki/File:Lyon_Gardiner_Tyler_bust.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf4/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Lyon_Gardiner_Tyler","http://web.wm.edu/news/archive/index.php?id=3603","/wiki/Lyon_Gardiner_Tyler","#cite_note-wise-11","/wiki/American_Civil_War","#cite_note-wise-11","#cite_note-wise-11","/w/index.php?title=Seven_Society_(College_of_William_%26_Mary)&action=edit&section=4","/wiki/Lawrence_W._I%27Anson","/wiki/Virginia_Supreme_Court","http://www.wm.edu/charlescenter","/wiki/Christopher_Newport_University","/wiki/Arthur_Matsu","/wiki/Earl_Gregg_Swem","http://www.swem.wm.edu/","/wiki/Walter_J._Zable","/wiki/Zable_Stadium","http://www.wm.edu/news/stories/2012/remembering-walter-j.-zable-1915-2012.php","http://www.tribeathletics.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=25100&ATCLID=205060945","/w/index.php?title=Seven_Society_(College_of_William_%26_Mary)&action=edit&section=5","/wiki/I_Am_the_College_of_William_and_Mary","/wiki/Secret_societies_at_the_College_of_William_%26_Mary","/wiki/Collegiate_secret_societies_in_North_America","/w/index.php?title=Seven_Society_(College_of_William_%26_Mary)&action=edit&section=6","http://www.wm.edu/as/history/","/w/index.php?title=Seven_Society_(College_of_William_%26_Mary)&action=edit&section=7","#cite_ref-Fiske_1-0","http://www.fiskeguide.com","#cite_ref-fh7_2-0","#cite_ref-fh7_2-1","#cite_ref-fh7_2-2","http://www.flathatnews.com/content/peeking-closed-societies","/wiki/The_Flat_Hat","#cite_ref-fh3_3-0","http://www.swem.wm.edu/beta/flathat/issues/fh19400319.pdf","/wiki/The_Flat_Hat","#cite_ref-fh4_4-0","#cite_ref-fh4_4-1","http://www.swem.wm.edu/beta/flathat/issues/fh19420318.pdf","/wiki/The_Flat_Hat","#cite_ref-fh5_5-0","http://www.swem.wm.edu/beta/flathat/issues/fh19430112.pdf","/wiki/The_Flat_Hat","#cite_ref-secrets_6-0","http://flathatnews.com/content/71145","/wiki/The_Flat_Hat","#cite_ref-ur1_7-0","#cite_ref-ur1_7-1","http://www.wm.edu/news/stories/2008/secret-society-donates-sadler-plaque-001.php","#cite_ref-fh1_8-0","#cite_ref-fh1_8-1","http://www.swem.wm.edu/beta/flathat/issues/fh19261008.pdf","/wiki/The_Flat_Hat","#cite_ref-dsj1_9-0","http://www.dogstreetjournal.com/story/2049","/wiki/The_DoG_Street_Journal","#cite_ref-dsj2_10-0","http://www.dogstreetjournal.com/story/4159","/wiki/The_DoG_Street_Journal","#ci
