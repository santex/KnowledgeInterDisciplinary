The Stoics taught that destructive emotions resulted from\nerrors in judgment, and that a sage, or person of \"moral and intellectual\nperfection\", would not suffer such emotions. [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/stoicism/ Stoicism], Stanford\nEncyclopedia of Philosophy.\n\nStoics were concerned with the active relationship between cosmic determinism\nand human freedom, and the belief that it is virtuous to maintain a will (called\n[[prohairesis]]) that is in accord with nature. Because of this, the Stoics\npresented their philosophy as a way of life, and they thought that the best\nindication of an individual's philosophy was not what a person said but how he\nbehaved. John Sellars. Stoicism, p. 32.\n\nLater Stoics, such as Seneca and Epictetus, emphasized that because \"virtue is\nsufficient for happiness\", a sage was immune to misfortune. This belief is\nsimilar to the meaning of the phrase \"stoic calm\", though the phrase does not\ninclude the \"radical ethical\" Stoic views that only a sage can be considered\ntruly free, and that all moral corruptions are equally vicious.\n\nFrom its founding, Stoic doctrine was popular with a following throughout Greece\nand the Roman Empire, including the Emperor Marcus Aurelius, until the closing\nof all philosophy schools in AD 529Â  by order of the Emperor Justinian I,\nwho perceived their pagan character as being at odds with the Christian\nfaith.
