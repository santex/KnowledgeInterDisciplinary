The main target was to improve the\nsharing of programs over GM-NAA I/O.\n\nSHARE Operating System provided new methods to manage buffers and input/output\ndevices, and, like GM-NAA I/O, allowed execution of programs written in\nassembly language.\n\nInitially it worked on IBM 709 computer and its transistorized compatible\nsuccessor the IBM 7090.\n\nA series of articles describing innovations in the system appears in the April,\n1959, ACM Journal.\n\nIn 1962 IBM discontinued support for SOS and announced an entirely new (and\nincompatible) operating system IBSYS. An amusing misprint in the caption of\nIBM's memo to the SHARE SOS Committee: It was intended to be \"Whither SOS?\" but\nthe distributed copies said \"Wither SOS\".\n","linknr":162,"url":"SHARE_Operating_System","recorded":1362673553,"links":15,"instances":["computing"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Free software operating systems","IBM operating systems","Discontinued operating systems"],"headings":["See also","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0a/Copland_organization.svg/50px-Copland_organization.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["share","computing"],["share","computing"]],"members":["share"],"related":["SHARE_(computing)","IBM_704","IBM_709","English_language","GM-NAA_I/O","SHARE_(computing)","Data_buffer","Input/output","Assembly_language","IBM_709","IBM_7090","IBM","IBSYS","GM-NAA_I/O","Timeline_of_operating_systems"]}
