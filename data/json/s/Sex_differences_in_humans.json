{"cursor":"68095","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n and that these models do not show the range of body types, skin pigmentation\n and varying degrees of intersexuality.]] A 'sex difference' is a distinction\n of biological and/or physiological characteristics associated with either\n males or females of a species. These can be of several types, including\n direct and indirect. Direct being the direct result of differences prescribed\n by the Y-chromosome, and indirect being a characteristic influenced\n indirectly (e.g. hormonally) by the Y-chromosome. '[[Sexual dimorphism]]' is\n a term for the phenotypic difference between males and females of the same\n species. Sex differences are also increased or decreased according to\n societal situations. Birke, Lydia. The Gender\n and Science Reader ed. Muriel Lederman and Ingrid Bartsch. New York,\n Routledge, 2001. 306-322\n\nDirect sex differences follow a bimodal distribution. Through the process of\nmeiosis and fertilization (with rare exceptions), each individual is created\nwith zero or one Y-chromosome. The complementary result for the X-chromosome\nfollows, either a double or a single X. Therefore, direct sex differences are\nusually binary in expression (although the deviations in complex biological\nprocesses produce a menagerie of exceptions). These include, most conspicuously,\nmale (vs female) gonads.\n\nIndirect sex differences are general differences as quantified by empirical data\nand statistical analysis. Most differing characteristics will conform to a bell-\ncurve (i.e. normal) distribution which can be broadly described by the mean\n(peak distribution) and standard deviation (indicator of size of range). Often\nonly the mean or mean difference between sexes is given. This may or may not\npreclude overlap in distributions. For example, most males are taller and\nstronger than females, but an individual female\ncould be taller and/or stronger than an individual male. These differences and\ntheir extent vary across societies.\n\nThe most obvious differences between males and females include all the features\nrelated to reproductive role, notably the endocrine (hormonal) systems and their\nphysiological and behavioural effects, including gonadal differentiation,\ninternal and external genital and breast differentiation, and differentiation of\nmuscle mass, height, and hair distribution.\n","linknr":1087,"url":"Sex_differences_in_humans","recorded":1362485003,"links":41,"instances":["biology"],"pdf":["http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/ad/ad347.pdf","http://www.asrm.org/Patients/patientbooklets/agefertility.pdf","http://www.ucihs.uci.edu/pediatrics/faculty/neurology/haier/pdf/82.pdf","http://www.ucihs.uci.edu/pediatrics/faculty/neurology/haier/pdf/82.pdf","http://web.missouri.edu/~gearyd/files/Geary%20%5B2006,%20Hormones%20&%20Beh%5D.pdf"],"categories":["Biology
