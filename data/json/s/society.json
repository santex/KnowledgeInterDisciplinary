social territory, subject to the same political authority and\ndominant cultural expectations. Human societies are characterized by patterns of\nrelationships (social relations) between individuals who share a distinctive\nculture and institutions; a given society may be described as the sum total of\nsuch relationships among its constituent members. In the social sciences, a\nlarger society often evinces stratification and/or dominance patterns in\nsubgroups.\n\nInsofar as it is collaborative, a society can enable its members to benefit in\nways that would not otherwise be possible on an individual basis; both\nindividual and social (common) benefits can thus be distinguished, or in many\ncases found to overlap.\n\nA society can also consist of like-minded people governed by their own norms and\nvalues within a dominant, larger society. This is sometimes referred to as a\nsubculture, a term used extensively within criminology.\n\nMore broadly, a society may be illustrated as an economic, social, or industrial\ninfrastructure, made up of a varied collection of individuals. Members of a\nsociety may be from different ethnic groups. A society can be a particular\nethnic group, such as the Saxons; a nation state, such as Bhutan; or a broader\ncultural group, such as a Western society. The word society may also refer to an\norganized voluntary association of people for religious, benevolent, cultural,\nscientific, political, patriotic, or other purposes. A \"society\" may even,\nthough more by means of metaphor, refer to a social organism such as an ant\ncolony or any cooperative aggregate such as, for example, in some formulations\nof artificial intelligence.\n","title":"society","headings":["Etymology and usage","Conceptions of society","Types of societies","Contemporary usage","See also","Notes","Further reading","External links"]},"micro-relation":["3: Culture","3: Voluntary_association","3: Tribe","2: Social_stratification","2: Industry","2: Western_culture","2: Organization","2: Social_solidarity","2: Hunter-gatherer","2: Pastoralism","2: Civilization","2: Cultural_evolution","2: Maurice_Godelier","2: Band_society","2: Tribal_chief","2: Government","1: Social_group","1: Interpersonal_relationship","1: Social_relation","1: Institutions","1: Social_science","1: Dominance_hierarchy","1: Collaborative","1: Subculture","1: Criminology","1: Economic","1: Social_support","1: Infrastructure","1: Ethnic_group","1: Saxons","1: Nation_state","1: Bhutan","1: Social_organism","1: Ant_colony","1: Cooperation","1: Society_of_mind","1: Artificial_intelligence","1: Latin","1: Comrade","1: Adam_Smith","1: Utility","1: Interdependence","1: National_identity","1: Cultural_identity","1: Language","1: Hierarchy","1: Autonomy","1: Great_apes","1: Social_animal","1: Robinson_Crusoe","1: Corner_case","1: Presocial","1: Eusociality","1: Primate#Social_systems","1: Subsistence","1: Horticulture","1: Agriculture","1: Post-industrial_society","1: Anthropology","1: Cultural_relativism","1: Political","1: Chiefdom","1: Political_power","1: Geography","1: History","1: Sociology","1: Gerhard_Lenski","1: Elman_Service","1: Social_inequality","1: Social_rank","1: All_humanity","1: Sociology_of_the_Internet","1: Information_age","1: Cultures","1: Neolithic_Revolution","1: City-state","1: Nation-state","1: Scapegoat","1: Joking_relationship","1: Scapegoating","1: Institution","1: Social_groups","1: List_of_subsistence_techniques","1: Pre-industrial","1: Industrial_society","1: Postindustrial","1: Manual_labour","1: Villages","1: Tlingit_people","1: Leadership","1: Social_unit","1: Production,_costs,_and_pricing","1: Education","1: Tools","1: Weapons","1: Jewelry","1: Wealth","1: Technology","1: Shamans","1: Technological","1: Trade","1: Feudalism","1: Estates_of_the_realm","1: Capitalism","1: Western_world","1: Judeo-Christian_values","1: Information_society","1: European_Union","1: Digital_economy","1: Information_and_communication_technologies","1: Social_inclusion","1: Public_services","1: Quality_of_life","1: International_Telecommunications_Union","1: World_Summit_on_the_Information_Society","1: Chania","1: Crete","1: Enterprise_software","1: Technology-Enhanced_Learning","1: Social_software","1: E-Government","1: E-democracy","1: Service_Science,_Management_and_Engineering","1: Human_capital","1: Green_economy","1: Creative_industries","1: Academic","1: Scientific_societies","1: American_Mathematical_Society","1: American_Society_of_Civil_Engineers","1: Royal_Society","1: Commerce","1: Investor","1: Business","1: United_Kingdom","1: Cooperative","1: Mutual_organization","1: Friendly_society","1: Building_society","1: Outline_of_society","1: Civil_society","1: Community","1: Outline_of_community","1: Outline_of_culture","1: Mass_society","1: Open_society","1: Professional_society","1: Religion","1: Outline_of_religion","1: Scientific_society","1: Secret_societies","1: Sociobiology","1: Social_actions","1: Social_capital","1: Social_cohesion","1: Societal_collapse","1: Social_contract","1: Social_order","1: Social_disintegration","1: Social_structure","1: Structure_and_agency","1: Oxford_English_Dictionary"]}
