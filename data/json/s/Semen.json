It is secreted by the gonads (sexual glands) and other sexual\norgans of male or hermaphroditic animals and can fertilize female ova. In\nhumans, seminal fluid contains several components besides spermatozoa:\nproteolytic and other enzymes as well as fructose are elements of seminal fluid\nwhich promote the survival of spermatozoa and provide a medium through which\nthey can move or \"swim\".\n\nSemen is produced and originates from the seminal vesicle, which is located in\nthe pelvis. The process that results in the discharge of semen is called\n[[ejaculation]].\n","linknr":863,"url":"Semen","recorded":1362581922,"links":99,"instances":["sex_act","sexual_act","sexual_practice","journal","biology"],"pdf":["http://rspas.anu.edu.au/grc/publications/pdfs/BellowsL_2003.pdf"],"categories":["Semen|"],"headings":["Physiological
