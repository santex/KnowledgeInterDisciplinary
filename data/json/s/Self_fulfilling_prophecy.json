Although examples of such prophecies can\nbe found in literature as far back as ancient Greece and ancient India, it is\n20th-century sociologist Robert K. Merton who is credited with coining the\nexpression \"self-fulfilling prophecy\" and formalizing its structure and\nconsequences. In his book [[Social Theory and Social Structure]], Merton defines\nself-fulfilling prophecy in the following terms: e.g. when Roxanna falsely\nbelieves her marriage will fail, her fears of such failure actually cause the\nmarriage to fail.\n\n}}\n\nIn other words, a positive or negative prophecy, strongly held belief, or\ndelusion - declared as truth when it is actually false - may sufficiently\ninfluence people so that their reactions ultimately fulfill the once-\nfalse prophecy.\n","recorded":1362124438,"portal":[],"list":[],"links":"430","instances":["lost","book","film","the_matrix","people","buffy_the_vampire_slayer","tv_series","2007_film","tv_series","lost","sociology","sociology","social_theory","epistemic","film","1959_tv_series","narrative","the_matrix","season_6","charmed","red_dwarf","sociology","song","sociology","psychology","economics","tv_series","publisher","psychology","film","the_matrix","mythology","mythology","tv_series","lost","lost"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Attitude
