Efforts to prevent suicide include limiting\naccess to firearms, treating mental illness and drug misuse, and improving\neconomic development.\n\n<!--Method and Epidemiology --> The most commonly used method of suicide varies\nby country and is partly related to availability. Common methods include:\nhanging, pesticide poisoning, and firearms. Around 800,000 to a million people\ndie by suicide every year, making it the 10th leading cause of death\nworldwide.<ref name=Hawton2009/><ref name=Var2012/> Rates are higher in men than\nin women, with males three to four times more likely to kill themselves than\nfemales.<ref></ref> There are an estimated 10 to 20&nbsp;million non-fatal\nattempted suicides every year.<ref></ref> Attempts are more common in young\npeople and females.\n\n<!--History, society and culture --> Views on suicide have been influenced by\nbroad existential themes such as religion, honor, and the meaning of life. The\nAbrahamic religions traditionally consider suicide an offense towards God due to\nthe belief in the sanctity of life. During the samurai era in Japan, seppuku was\nrespected as a means of atonement for failure or as a form of protest. Sati, a\nnow outlawed Hindu funeral practice, expected the widow to immolate herself on\nher husband's funeral pyre, either willingly or under pressure from the family\nand society.<ref></ref>\n\nSuicide and attempted suicide, while previously criminally punishable, is no\nlonger in most Western countries. It remains a criminal offense in most Islamic\ncountries. In the 20th and 21st centuries, suicide in the form of self-\nimmolation has been used as a medium of protest, and kamikaze and suicide\nbombings have been used as a military or terrorist tactic.<ref></ref>\n",
