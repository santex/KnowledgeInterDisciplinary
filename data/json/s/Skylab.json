Skylab orbited the\nEarth from 1973 to 1979, and included a workshop, a solar observatory, and other\nsystems. It was launched unmanned by a modified Saturn V rocket, with a mass of\n. Three manned missions to the station, conducted\nbetween 1973 and 1974 using the Apollo Command/Service Module (CSM) atop the\nsmaller Saturn IB, each delivered a three-astronaut crew. On the third mission,\nan additional Apollo / Saturn IB stood by, ready for launch if needed to rescue\nthe crew in orbit.\n\nSkylab included an Apollo Telescope Mount (a multi-spectral solar observatory),\nMultiple Docking Adapter with two docking ports, Airlock Module with EVA\nhatches, and the Orbital Workshop, the main habitable volume of the station.\nPower came from solar arrays, as well as fuel cells in the docked Apollo CSM.\nThe rear of the station included a large waste tank, propellant tanks for\nmaneuvering jets, and a heat radiator.\n\nThe station was damaged during launch when the micrometeoroid shield separated\nfrom the workshop and tore away, taking one of two main solar panel arrays with\nit and jamming the other one so that it could not deploy. This deprived Skylab\nof most of its electrical power, and also removed protection from intense solar\nheating, threatening to make it unusable. The first crew was able to save it in\nthe first ever in-space major repair, by deploying a replacement heat shade and\nfreeing the jammed solar panels.\n\nNumerous scientific experiments were conducted aboard Skylab during its\noperational life, and crews were able to confirm the existence of coronal holes\nin the Sun. The Earth Resources Experiment Package (EREP), was used to view the\nEarth with sensors that recorded data in the visible, infrared, and microwave\nspectral regions. Thousands of photographs of Earth were taken, and records for\nhuman time spent in orbit were extended.\n\nPlans were made to refurbish and reuse Skylab, using the Space Shuttle to boost\nits orbit and repair it. However, development of the Shuttle was delayed, and\nSkylab reentered Earth's atmosphere and disintegrated in 1979, with debris\nstriking portions of Western Australia.\n\nAfter Skylab's demise, the focus shifted to the reusable Spacelab module, an\norbital workshop that could be deployed from the Space Shuttle and returned to\nEarth. The next American space station project was Space Station Freedom, which\nwas never completed, although it eventually led to the construction of the US\nOrbital Segment of the International Space Station, starting in 1998. Shuttle-\nMir was another project, and led to the U.S. funding Spektr, Priroda, and the\nMir Docking Module in the 1990s.\n","linknr":975,"url":"Skylab","recorded":1362267772,"links":88,"instances":["columbia","target","rocket_engine","spacecraft_landing","space_station"],"pdf":["http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19790075817_1979075817.pdf","http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/oral_histories/LindDL/linddl.pdf","http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19740024203_1974024203.pdf","http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19800012907_1980012907.pdf"],"categories":["1973
