Other well-known ranks are life, domain, kingdom, phylum,\n  class, order, genus, and species, with family fitting between order and genus.\n  As for the other well-known ranks, there is the option of an immediately lower\n  rank, indicated by the prefix sub-: subfamily (Latin: {{lang|la|subfamilia}}).\n* a taxonomic unit, a taxon, in that rank. In that case the plural is families\n  (Latin {{lang|la|familiae}})\n::Example: Walnuts and hickories belong to Juglandaceae, the walnut family\n\nWhat does and does not belong to each family is determined by a taxonomist.\nSimilarly for the question if a particular family should be recognized at all.\nOften there is no exact agreement, with different taxonomists each taking a\ndifferent position. There are no hard rules that a taxonomist needs to follow in\ndescribing or recognizing a family. Some taxa are accepted almost universally,\nwhile others are recognised only rarely.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Subfamily_(biology)","recorded":1372152253,"links":[],"instances":["biology","biology","biology","biology","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Scientific classification","Botanical nomenclature|Family","Plant taxonomy|1rank13","Zoological nomenclature","Families (biology)|"],"headings":["History","Uses","See also","References"],"image":[],"tags":[["domain","biology"],["kingdom","biology"],["class","biology"],["order","biology"],["taxonomy","biology"]],"members":["domain","order","kingdom","taxonomy","class"],"related":["Biological_classification","Taxonomic_rank","Life","Domain_(biology)","Kingdom_(biology)","Phylum","Class_(biology)","Order_(biology)","Genus","Species","Taxon","Walnut","Hickory","Juglandaceae","Pierre_Magnol","Carl_Linnaeus","Tree","Herb","Fern","Palmae","Michel_Adanson","Augustin_Pyramus_de_Candolle","George_Bentham","Joseph_Dalton_Hooker","Pierre_Andr√©_Latreille","Arthropod","Systematics","Cladistics","Phylogenetics","Taxonomy_(biology)","Virus_classification","List_of_Anuran_families","List_of_Testudines_families","List_of_fish_families","List_of_families_of_spiders","Family","Protein_family","Gene_family"]}
