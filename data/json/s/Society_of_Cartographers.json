The majority of the membership is UK based, but with a\nsignificant world-wide membership.\n\nThe SoC is focused on the continual evolution of the mapping industry and how\nthis relates to overlapping disciplines (such as GIS; Graphic Design, Web\nmapping); how maps now manifest themselves in todayâs society and what this\nmeans to the mapmakers of today.\n\nPeople can join the SoC at: http://www.soc.org.uk/member.htm\n","linknr":94,"url":"Society_of_Cartographers","recorded":1362664885,"links":10,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Geographic societies"],"headings":["Networking","See also","Contacts","Legal","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Cartography","United_Kingdom","GIS","Graphic_Design","Web_mapping","Geographical_Association","Royal_Geographical_Society","International_Cartographic_Association","British_Cartographic_Society","Association_of_Geographic_Information_Laboratories_for_Europe"]}
