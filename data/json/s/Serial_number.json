Although usually called a number,\nit may include letters, though ending with digits. Typically serial numbers of a\nproduction run are incremented by one, or another fixed difference, from one\nunit to the next. Units may be marked with several alphanumeric codes, but only\none of these will be a serial number; others are sometimes called nominal\nnumbers, and may identify the part, specify installed options, and so on.\n","linknr":175,"url":"Serial_number","recorded":1362374548,"links":26,"instances":["information"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Serial numbers|"],"headings":["Applications of serial numbering","Other uses of the term","Serial number arithmetic","See also","Notes and references","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/84/Seriennummer.JPG/220px-Seriennummer.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/Short_SC.1.png/220px-Short_SC.1.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["identification","information"]],"members":["identification"],"related":["Identification_(information)","Alphanumeric","Nominal_number","Banknote","Counterfeit","Quality_control","Computer_software","Online_multiplayer_game","Reverse_engineering","Internet","WorldWide_Web","International_Standard_Serial_Number","International_Standard_Book_Number","Library_science","Certificate_Authority","Cryptography","Short_SC.1","Service_number","Air_force","Royal_Air_Force","Avro_Lancaster","English_Electric_Lightning","Binbrook","World_War_II","Secrecy","De_Havilland_Vampire","Jet_engine","Fighter_aircraft","De_Havilland_Mosquito","H2S_radar","Royal_Flying_Corps","Bristol_F.2_Fighter","Shuttleworth_Collection","Supermarine_Spitfire","U.S._Food_and_Drug_Administration","Pharmaceutical_industry","Traceability","Counterfeit_medications","Network_protocol","Arithmetic_overflow","Lollipop_sequence_numbering","Numbering_scheme","Names_of_numbers_in_English","Product_key","United_Kingdom_military_aircraft_serials","United_States_military_aircraft_serials"]}
