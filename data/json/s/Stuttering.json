[http://apps.who-\n.int/classifications/apps/icd/icd10online/?gf90.htm+f985 World Health\nOrganization ICD-10 F95.8 - Stuttering]. The term stuttering is most\ncommonly associated with involuntary sound repetition, but it also encompasses\nthe abnormal hesitation or pausing before speech, referred to by people who\nstutter as blocks, and the prolongation of certain sounds, usually vowels and\nsemivowels. For many people who stutter, repetition is the primary problem.\nBlocks and prolongations are learned mechanisms to mask repetition, as the fear\nof repetitive speaking in public is often the main cause of psychological\nunease. The term \"stuttering\" covers a wide range of severity, encompassing\nbarely perceptible impediments that are largely cosmetic to severe symptoms that\neffectively prevent oral communication.\n\nThe impact of stuttering on a person's functioning and emotional state can be\nsevere. This may include fears of having to enunciate specific vowels or\nconsonants, fears of being caught stuttering in social situations, self-imposed\nisolation, anxiety, stress, shame, or a feeling of \"loss of control\" during\nspeech. Stuttering is sometimes popularly associated with anxiety but there is\nactually no such correlation (though as mentioned social anxiety may actually\ndevelop in individuals as a result of their stuttering). Stuttering is not\nreflective of\nintelligence. [http://www.stutteringhelp.org/Default.aspx?tabid=539 Myths\nabout stuttering], on Stuttering Foundation's website.\n\nStuttering is generally not a problem with the physical production of speech\nsounds or putting thoughts into words. Acute nervousness and stress can trigger\nstuttering in persons predisposed to it, and living with a highly stigmatized\ndisability can result in anxiety and high allostatic stress load (i.e., chronic\nnervousness and stress) that reduce the amount of acute stress necessary to\ntrigger stuttering in any given person who stutters, exacerbating the problem in\nthe manner of a positive feedback system; the name 'Stuttered Speech Syndrome'\nhas been proposed for this\ncondition. http://www.stutteredspeechsyndrome.com Neither\nacute nor chronic stress, however, itself creates any predisposition to\nstuttering.\n\nThe disorder is also variable, which means that in certain situations, such as\ntalking on the telephone, the stuttering might be more severe or less, depending\non the anxiety level connected with that activity. Although the exact etiology\nor cause of stuttering is unknown, both genetics and neurophysiology are thought\nto contribute. There are many treatments and speech therapy techniques available\nthat may help increase fluency in some people who stutter to the point where an\nuntrained ear cannot identify a problem; however, there is essentially no cure\nfor the disorder at present, although many treatments are available.\n","linknr":916,"url":"Stuttering","recorded":1362511085,"links":75,"instances":["ambi","linguistics","emotion","ski_ba_bop_ba_dop_bop","psychology","love","open_all_hours","rank","philanthropist"],"pdf":["http://www.theoryofstuttering-stammering.co.uk/Sims.pdf","http://theses.lub.lu.se/scripta-archive/2005/02/02/med_1035/part2/Per_Alm_Paper_II.pdf","http://theses.lub.lu.se/scripta-archive/2005/02/02/med_1035/part2/Per_Alm_Paper_II.pdf"],"categories":["Speech
