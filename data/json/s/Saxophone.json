Saxophones are usually made of brass and\nplayed with a single-reed mouthpiece similar to that of the clarinet.\nThe saxophone was invented by the Belgian instrument maker Adolphe Sax in\n1846. He wanted to create an instrument that would be the most\npowerful and vocal of the woodwinds, and the most adaptive of the brassâthat\nwould fill the vacant middle ground between the two sections. He patented the\nsaxophone on June 24, 1846 in two groups of seven instruments each. Each series\nconsisted of instruments of various sizes in alternating transposition. The\nseries pitched in B and E, designed for military bands, has proved extremely\npopular and most saxophones encountered today are from this series. Instruments\nfrom the so-called \"orchestral\" series pitched in C and F never gained a\nfoothold, and the B and E instruments have now replaced the C and F instruments\nin classical music.\n\nWhile proving very popular in military band music, the saxophone is most\ncommonly associated with jazz and classical music. There is substantial\nrepertoire of concert music in the classical idiom for the members of the\nsaxophone family. Saxophone players are called\n[[wikt:saxophonist|saxophonists]].\n","linknr":885,"url":"Saxophone","recorded":1362477712,"links":114,"instances":["clarinet","music","walton","music","composer","ives","instrument","music","woodwind","geometry","music","wind","music","music","music","inventor"],"pdf":["http://music.indiana.edu/departments/academic/woodwinds/files/saxophone/alto-sax-level3-rep.pdf"],"categories":["Saxophones","Belgian
