Stokes' theorem says that the integral of a differential form Ï over\nthe boundary of some orientable manifold Î© is equal to the integral of its\nexterior derivative dÏ over the whole of Î©, i.e.\n\n: \\int_{\\partial \\Omega}\\omega=\\int_{\\Omega}\\mathrm {d}\\omega\n\nThis modern form of Stokes' theorem is a vast generalization of a classical\nresult first discovered by Lord Kelvin, who communicated it to George Stokes in\na letter dated July 2, 1850. See: *Victor J. Katz (May 1979) [http://www.ingelec.uns.edu.ar/asnl/Materiales/Cap03Extras/Stokes-\nKatz.pdf \"The history of Stokes' theorem,\"] Mathematics Magazine, '52' (3): 146-\n156. *The letter from Thomson to Stokes appears in: William Thomson and George\nGabriel Stokes with David B. Wilson, ed., The Correspondence between Sir George\nGabriel Stokes and Sir William Thomson, Baron Kelvin of Largs, Volume 1: 1846-\n1869 (Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press, 1990),\n[http://books.google.com/books?id=YrjkOEdC83gC&pg=PA97#v=onepage&q&f=false pages\n96-97.] *Neither Thomson nor Stokes published a proof of the theorem. The first\npublished proof appeared in 1861 in: Hermann Hankel, Zur allgemeinen Theorie der\nBewegung der FlÃ¼ssigkeiten [On the general theory of the movement of fluids]\n(GÃ¶ttingen, (Germany): Dieterische University Buchdruckerei, 1861); see\n[http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015035826760#page/34/mode/1up pages\n34-37]. Hankel doesn't mention the author of the theorem. *In a footnote, Larmor\nmentions earlier researchers who had integrated, over a surface, the curl of a\nvector field. See: George G. Stokes with Sir Joseph Larmor and John Wm. Strutt\n(Baron Rayleigh), ed.s, Mathematical and Physical Papers by the late Sir George\nGabriel Stokes, ...

Olivier Darrigol,Electrodynamics from Ampere to\nEinstein, p. 146,ISBN 0198505930 Oxford (2000) Spivak\n(1965), p. vii, Preface. Stokes set the theorem as a question on the 1854\nSmith's Prize exam, which led to the result bearing his name. See: *The 1854\nSmith's Prize Examination is available on-line at:\n[http://www.clerkmaxwellfoundation.org/SmithsPrizeExam_Stokes.pdf Clerk Maxwell\nFoundation]. Maxwell took this examination and tied for first place with Edward\nJohn Routh in the Smith's Prize examination of 1854. See footnote 2 on page 237\nof: James Clerk Maxwell with P. M. Harman, ed., The Scientific Letters and\nPapers of James Clerk Maxwell, Volume I: 1846-1862 (Cambridge, England:\nCambridge University Press, 1990),\n[http://books.google.com/books?id=zfM8AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA237#v=onepage&q&f=false page\n237]; see also Wikipedia's article \"Smith's prize\" or the\n[http://www.clerkmaxwellfoundation.org/SmithsPrizeSolutions2008_2_14.pdf Clerk\nMaxwell Foundation]. *James Clerk Maxwell, A Treatise on Electricity and\nMagnetism (Oxford, England: Clarendon Press,1873), volume 1,\n[http://books.google.com/books?id=92QSAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA27#v=onepage&q&f=false pages\n25-27.] In a footnote on page 27, Maxwell mentions that Stokes used the theorem\nas question 8 in the Smith's Prize Examination of 1854. This footnote appears to\nhave been the cause of the theorem's being known as \"Stokes' theorem\". This classical KelvinâStokes theorem relates the surface\nintegral of the curl of a vector field F over a surface Î£ in Euclidean three-\nspace to the line integral of the vector field over its boundary âÎ£:\n\n: \\iint_{\\Sigma} \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{F} \\cdot d\\mathbf{\\Sigma} =\n:\\oint_{\\partial\\Sigma} \\mathbf{F} \\cdot d \\mathbf{r}, \n\nThis classical statement, as well as the classical Divergence theorem,\nfundamental theorem of calculus, and Green's Theorem are simply special cases of\nthe general formulation stated above.\n","linknr":368,"url":"Stokes'_theorem","recorded":1362560160,"links":45,"instances":["mathematics","topology","algebraic_topology","topology","mathematics","differential_geometry"],"pdf":["http://www.ingelec.uns.edu.ar/asnl/Materiales/Cap03Extras/Stokes-Katz.pdf","http://www.clerkmaxwellfoundation.org/SmithsPrizeExam_Stokes.pdf","http://www.clerkmaxwellfoundation.org/SmithsPrizeSolutions2008_2_14.pdf","http://higheredbcs.wiley.com/legacy/college/hugheshallett/0471484822/theory/hh_focusontheory_sectionm.pdf","https://www.cds.caltech.edu/help/uploads/wiki/files/177/Diff_Forms_pauses.pdf"],"categories":["Differential
