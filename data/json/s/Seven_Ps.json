The marketing mix is often crucial when determining a product or\nbrand's offering, and is often synonymous with the 'four Ps': price, product,\npromotion, and place; in service marketing, however, the four Ps have been\nexpanded to the '[[Seven Ps|sevenPs]]' or 'eight Ps' to address the different\nnature of services.\n\nIn recent times, the concept of 'four Cs' has been introduced as a more customer-\ndriven replacement of 'four Ps'.\nAnd there are two 'four Cs' theories today.
