{"cursor":"6426","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nIn medicine, a 'side effect' is an effect, whether therapeutic or adverse, that\nis secondary to the one intended; although the term is predominantly employed to\ndescribe adverse effects, it can also apply to beneficial, but unintended,\nconsequences of the use of a drug.\n\nOccasionally, drugs are prescribed or procedures performed specifically for\ntheir side effects; in that case, said side effect ceases to be a side effect,\nand is now an intended effect. For instance, X-rays were historically (and are\ncurrently) used as an imaging technique; the discovery of their oncolytic\ncapability led to their employ in radiotherapy (ablation of malignant tumours).\n\nUse of drugs for unapproved indicationsâthat is, for their side effectsâis\ntermed off-label use. For instance, opioids, which are approved as palliative\ntreatment for pain, may also be used for their euphoriant properties as\nanxiolytics or antidepressants, whether medically or recreationally.\n\nOff-label use of drugs, although similar in meaning to side effects, is not to\nbe confused with them; side effects describe the mechanism of action that a drug\nused off-label takes, whereas off-label use implies the desired consequences of\nusing a drug for its side-effects.\n\nOff-label use of drugs is legal; the manner in which prescription medication is\nto be used is solely at the discretion of the prescriber. However, the marketing\nof drugs towards unapproved indications is illegal; in fact, several\npharmaceutical development firms have been fined for unapproved promotion of\ntheir products.\n","linknr":175,"url":"Side_effect","recorded":1362582369,"links":14,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.naabt.org/documents/The_Buprenorphine_effect_on_Depression.pdf","http://idahodur.isu.edu/leaflets/2004/GABAPENTIN%20EDU%20LEAFLET%202004.pdf"],"categories":["Pharmacology"],"headings":["Examples of therapeutic side-effects","External links","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Medicine","Adverse_effect","Drug","X-ray","Radiotherapy","Malignancy","Tumour","Off-label_use","Palliative_care","Pain","Euphoriant","Anxiolytics","Antidepressants","Recreational_drug_use","Mechanism_of_action","Physician","Bevacizumab","Avastin","Macular_degeneration","Macular_edema","Diabetic_retinopathy","Central_retinal_vein_occlusion","Bupropion","Anti-depressant","Sildenafil","Pulmonary_hypertension","Erection","Carbamazepine","Manic_depression","Convulsions","Attention-deficit_hyperactivity_disorder","Schizophrenia","Phantom_limb","Paroxysmal_extreme_pain_disorder","Neuromyotonia","Post-traumatic_stress_disorder","Dexamethasone","Betamethasone","Premature_labor","Doxepin","Angiodema","Antihistamine","Gabapentin","Seizures","Postherpetic_neuralgia","Bipolar_disorder","Essential_tremor","Hot_flashes","Migraine","Neuropathic_pain","Phantom_limb","Restless_leg_syndrome","Magnesium_sulfate","Premature_labor","Preeclampsia","Methotrexate","Choriocarcinoma","Ectopic_pregnancy","SSRI","Sertraline","Anti-depressant","Ejaculation","Premature_ejaculation","Human_chorionic_gonadotropin"]}
