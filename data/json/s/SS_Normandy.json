She entered service in\n1935 as the largest and fastest passenger ship afloat; she is still the most\npowerful steam turbo-electric-propelled passenger ship ever built. {{cite\nnews |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,930557-2,00.html\n|title=Colossus into Clyde |date=1934-10-01 |publisher=TIME |accessdate=2008-11-\n19}} Ardman, Harvey. \"Normandie, Her Life and Times,\"\nNew York, Franklin Watts, 1985. p. 46-47\n\nHer novel design and lavish interiors led many to consider her the greatest of\nocean liners. Ardman 1985, p. 2 Floating Palaces.\n(1996) A&E. TV Documentary. Narrated by Fritz Weaver Despite this, she\nwas not a commercial success and relied partly on government subsidy to\noperate. During service as the flagship of the CGT, she made\n139 westbound transatlantic crossings from her home port of Le Havre to New\nYork. Normandie held the Blue Riband for the fastest transatlantic crossing at\nseveral points during her service career, during which the RMS ''Queen Mary''\nwas her main rival.\n\nDuring World War II, Normandie was seized by US authorities at New York and\nrenamed USS Lafayette. In 1942, the liner caught fire while being converted to a\ntroopship, capsized onto her port side and came to rest on the mud of the Hudson\nRiver at Pier 88, the site of the current New York Passenger Ship Terminal.\nAlthough salvaged at great expense, restoration was deemed too costly and she\nwas scrapped in October 1946.
