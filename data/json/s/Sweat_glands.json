Humans utilize eccrine sweat glands as\n  primary form of cooling.\n* Apocrine sweat glands are larger, have a different secretion mechanism, and\n  are mostly limited to the axilla (armpits) and perianal areas in humans. Although apocrine glands contribute little to cooling in\n  humans, they are the only effective sweat glands in hoofed animals such as the\n  camel, donkey, horse, and cattle.\n\nDomestic animals have apocrine glands at the base of each hair follicle but\neccrine glands only in foot pads and snout. Their apocrine glands, like those in\nhumans, produce an odorless oily milky secretion evolved not to evaporate and\ncool but rather coat and stick to hair so odor-causing bacteria can grow on\nit. Eccrine glands on their foot pads, like those on palms and\nsoles of humans, didn't evolve to cool either but rather increase friction and\nenhance grip.\n\nBoth apocrine and eccrine sweat glands contain myoepithelial cells (from Greek\nmyoâ \"muscle\"), specialized epithelial cells located between the gland cells and\nthe underlying basal lamina. Myoepithelial cell contractions squeeze the gland\nand discharge the accumulated secretions. The secretory activities of the gland\ncells and the contractions of myoepithelial cells are controlled by both the\nautonomic nervous system and by the circulating hormones.\n\nCeruminous glands, which produce ear wax, and mammary glands, which produce\nmilk, and ciliary glands in the eyelids are considered to be modified sweat\nglands.\n","linknr":552,"url":"Sweat_glands","recorded":1362373458,"links":50,"instances":["medical","biology","cell_biology"],"pdf":["http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-2494.2007.00387.x/pdf","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-2494.2007.00387.x/pdf"],"categories":["Glands","Exocrine system","Skin anatomy"],"headings":["Structure","Types","Pathology","Gallery","Notes","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/Skin.png/250px-Skin.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Gray946.png/220px-Gray946.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/Gray940_-_sweat_gland.png/170px-Gray940_-_sweat_gland.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/Gray893_-_sweat_glands.png/110px-Gray893_-_sweat_glands.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/da/Gray1172.png/220px-Gray1172.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["granule","cell_biology"],["self-limiting","biology"],["infiltration","medical"]],"members":["infiltration","granule"],"related":["Skin","Sweat","Eccrine_sweat_glands","Thermoregulation","Apocrine_sweat_glands","Axilla","Apocrine_glands","Eccrine_glands","Myoepithelial_cells","Ceruminous_glands","Mammary_glands","Hypodermis","Adipose_tissue","Micron","Cuboidal_cells","Nerve_fibers","Axons","Capillaries","Apocrine","Merocrine","Pheromones","McClintock_effect","Pheromones","Sweat","Blood_plasma","Sodium_chloride","Acid_mantle","Acrospiroma","Aggressive_digital_papillary_adenocarcinoma","Apocrine_gland_carcinoma","Ceruminoma","Myoepithelioma","Cylindroma","Eccrine_carcinoma","Hidradenoma_papilliferum","Hidrocystoma","Microcystic_adnexal_carcinoma","Mucinous_carcinoma","Papillary_eccrine_adenoma","Syringadenoma_papilliferum","Syringofibroadenoma","Syringoma","Lipomas","Acromegaly","Growth_hormone","Aquagenic_wrinkling_of_the_palms","Papules","Aquaporin_5","Cystic_fibrosis","Sweat_test","Ectodermal_dysplasia","Fabry_disease","Globotriaosylceramide","GM1_gangliosidoses","Vacuolization","Hunter_syndrome","Granule_(cell_biology)","Mucin","Cytoplasm","Hypothyroidism","Thyroid_hormone","Kearns–Sayre_syndrome","Mitochondrial_myopathy","Mitochondria","Lafora_disease","Polyglucosan","Lichen_striatus","Self-limiting_(biology)","Papule","Lymphoid","Infiltration_(medical)","Metachromatic_leukodystrophy","Neuronal_ceroid_lipofuscinosis","Neutral_lipid_storage_disease","Niemann–Pick_disease,_type_C","Lipid_storage_disease","Schindler_disease","Vacuole"]}
