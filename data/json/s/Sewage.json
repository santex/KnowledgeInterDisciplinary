Also known as wastewater, it is more than 99% water\n and is characterized by volume or rate of flow, physical condition, chemical\n constituents and the bacteriological organisms that it contains. In loose\n American English usage, the terms 'sewage' and 'sewerage' are sometimes\n interchanged. Funk & Wagnall's Standard Dictionary (International Edition)\n New York, 1960, p. 1152. Both words are descended from Old French\n assewer, derived from the Latin exaquare, \"to drain out (water)\"\n","linknr":266,"url":"Sewage","recorded":1362509556,"links":29,"instances":["waste","agriculture","geography","meteorology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Anaerobic digestion","Sewerage","Waste management"],"headings":["Categories","Sewage services","See also","References","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/Nygrand_2_mars_2007.JPG/220px-Nygrand_2_mars_2007.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["precipitation","meteorology"],["channel","geography"],["leaching","agriculture"],["blackwater","waste"]],"members":["blackwater","leaching","channel","precipitation"],"related":["Wastewater","Volume","Rate_of_flow","American_English","Sewerage","Surface_runoff","Wastewater","Washing","Sanitary","Surface_runoff","Precipitation_(meteorology)","Channel_(geography)","Atmosphere","Leaching_(agriculture)","Vegetation","Soil","Spill_containment","Waste_collection","Pathogen","Eutrophication","Ecotoxicity","Pollution","Agriculture","International_Water_Management_Institute","International_Water_Management_Institute","World_Health_Organization","Sanitary_sewer","London_sewerage_system","Septic_tank","Cesspit","Vehicle","Third_world_countries","Sewage_treatment","Sludge","Waste_management","Onsite_sewage_facility","Biofilters","Developed_countries","Sewage_-_regulation_and_administration","Sludge_processing_plant","Seawater_pollution","Composting_toilets","Blackwater_(waste)","Chopper_pumps","Cloaca_Maxima","Urban_Waste_Water_Treatment_Directive","Ecological_sanitation","Humanure","Sanitary_sewer_overflow","Sewage_pumping","Vacuum_sewerage","Water_quality"]}
