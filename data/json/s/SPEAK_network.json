{"cursor":"2841","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'SPEAK' is an evangelical Christian network which connects people to campaign\nand pray on issues of global justice. Through bringing change to situations of\ninjustice SPEAK aims to share their faith in God. The organisation's name comes\nfrom Proverbs 31:8-9: \"Speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves\".\n\nSPEAK combines campaigning and prayer because they believe that they make a\npowerful combination to bring social transformation. SPEAK believes in\nnetworking because they believe that only when acting and praying in unity can\npeople really make a difference.\n\nSPEAK connects both individuals and groups. Local groups are the main network\nparticipants, and there are now over thirty groups in the UK plus others in the\nUSA, France, Spain, various parts of Africa and whole other networks affiliated\nto SPEAK in Brazil, the Netherlands and Sweden.\n\nIn the local group context SPEAK aims to combine faith and action. SPEAK seeks\nto share their faith in God, as well as campaign for change in where they\nbelieve that currently there is injustice, such as world trade and third world\ndebt. SPEAK wants to be a movement that follows Jesus, as he is revealed in the\nBible, in a radical way in personal discipleship, as well as striving for social\ntransformation.\n\nInvolvement in the SPEAK network can range from using the \"Pray and Post\" cards\nto becoming a SPEAK link or running a SPEAK group in your university, college or\nlocal area.\n\nAs a Christian group, SPEAK aims to base its action on the Bible. Biblical\npassages such as Proverbs chapter 31 verses 8-9, and Micah chapter 6 verse 8\nhelp to define the purpose of the SPEAK network.\n\nThe SPEAK network organises an annual weekend conference known as Soundcheck,\nwhich is usually held in London during February. The SPEAK Network also\norganises regional forums. These events are opportunities for people in local\nSPEAK groups to meet up with other people involved in the SPEAK Network.\n","linknr":104,"url":"SPEAK_network","recorded":1364203609,"links":["/w/index.php?title=SPEAK_network&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=SPEAK_network&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/Evangelicalism","/wiki/Christian","/wiki/Prayer","/wiki/Justice","/wiki/Faith","/wiki/Political_campaign","/wiki/Social","/wiki/United_Kingdom","/wiki/USA","/wiki/France","/wiki/Spain","/wiki/Brazil","/wiki/Netherlands","/wiki/Sweden","/wiki/Faith","/wiki/International_trade","/wiki/Third_world_debt","/wiki/Jesus","/wiki/Bible","/wiki/Disciple_(Christianity)","/wiki/University","/wiki/College","/wiki/Christian","/wiki/Bible","/wiki/Book_of_Proverbs","/wiki/Book_of_Micah","/wiki/Meeting","/wiki/London","/w/index.php?title=SPEAK_network&action=edit&section=1","http://www.speak.org.uk/node/4?PHPSESSID=76c71e108410bd8a93cfb4dec83e3e29","http://www.speak.org.uk/node/4?PHPSESSID=76c71e108410bd8a93cfb4dec83e3e29","/w/index.php?title=SPEAK_network&action=edit&section=2","http://www.speak.org.uk","http://www.luucu.com/speak/","http://www.biblegateway.net/passage/?search=Proverbs%2031:8-9&version=31","http://www.biblegateway.net/passage/?search=Micah%206:8&version=31","/w/index.php?title=SPEAK_network&action=edit&section=3","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=SPEAK_network&oldid=489793345","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Christian_missions","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=SPEAK+network&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=SPEAK+network","/wiki/SPEAK_network","/wiki/Talk:SPEAK_network","#","/wiki/SPEAK_network","/w/index.php?title=SPEAK_network&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=SPEAK_network&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/SPEAK_network","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/SPEAK_network","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=SPEAK_network&oldid=489793345","/w/index.php?title=SPEAK_network&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=SPEAK_network&id=489793345","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=SPEAK+network","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=SPEAK+network&oldid=489793345&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=SPEAK_network&printable=yes","//sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%A4ttvisen%C3%A4tverket_SPEAK","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPEAK_network","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=skins.vector&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","/w/index.php?title=MediaWiki:Gadget-ReferenceTooltips.js&action=raw&ctype=text/javascript&508635914","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":["christianity"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Christian
