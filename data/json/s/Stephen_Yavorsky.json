{"cursor":"6788","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Stefan Yavorsky' (, ), born 'Simeon Ivanovich Yavorsky' () (1658â Most\nsources (including the [http://dic.academic.ru/dic.nsf/bse/155339/Ð¯Ð²Ð¾ÑÑÐºÐ¸Ð¹ Great\nSoviet Encyclopedia]) give a death date of , but the older\n[http://dic.academic.ru/dic.nsf/brokgauz_efron/97364/Ð¡ÑÐµÑÐ°Ð½ Brockhaus and Efron]\nhas ), was an archbishop and statesman in the Russian Empire and the first\npresident of the Most Holy Synod.\n\nYavorsky was born in Yavor (which was in right-bank Ukraine, but whose exact\nlocation is unknown Sergei Nikolaev, \"Stefan Iavorsky,\" in Marcus C. Levitt,\nEarly Modern Russian Writers: Late Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries (Gale\nResearch, 1995; ISBN 0810357119), p. 117. ), but after that territory\nbecame part of Poland in 1667, the family moved to Krasilovka, near Nezhin, on\nthe left bank. He enrolled in the Kyiv-Mohyla Academy around 1673 and completed\nits course of study; in 1684 he traveled to Poland to continue his education, at\nwhich point he was compelled to join the Uniate church, as was common for Kievan\nstudents who wanted to study in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth; he took the\nUniate name Stanislav ). He spent five years abroad, studying philosophy in Lvov\nand Lublin and theology in Poznan and Vilnius, where he completed his\neducation. Nikolaev, \"Stefan Iavorsky,\" p. 117. In 1689 he returned to\nKiev, broke from the Uniate church and returned to Eastern Orthodoxy. He took\nmonastic vows under the name Stefan and settled at the Kiev Academy as a\npreacher and professor, being appointed prefect of the institution and in 1697\nhegumen of the Nikolaevsky monastery (). He also began to preach, which soon\nmade him well known in Kiev. At the beginning of 1700 he visited Moscow on\nchurch business, and when the boyar Aleksei Shein died in February Patriarch\nAdrian commissioned him to give the eulogy, which attracted the attention of\nPeter I, who was so pleased he had Yavorsky remain in Moscow and ordered a\nposition to be found for him, as a result of which he was made archbishop of\nRyazan and Murom in April. When Adrian himself died in October, Yavorsky was\nappointed locum tenens of the patriarchal see. \"Thus in the course of seven\nmonths Iavorsky ascended from the humble position of father superior to the\nhighest office in the entire church. Iavorsky had never desired such an\nappointment and even attempted to avoid it, but Peter was unyielding [because]\nthe prelate was not a progressive or a reformer, but he was an authoritative\nfigure with a European education, of which there were still few in\nRussia.\" Nikolaev, \"Stefan Iavorsky,\" p. 118.\n\nYavorsky's life now changed dramatically. He lived in Moscow, Saint Petersburg,\nand Ryazan, returning to Ukraine only rarely and with the express permission of\nthe tsar. As the head of the church, he had to deal with the struggles between\nthe various factions in the church, and he was expected to uphold Peter's\nreforms. At first he did so, but eventually the reforms restricted the rights of\nthe church that he began to oppose them, and in 1712 a sermon of his, calling\nthe Tsarevich Alexei \"Russia's only hope\" and hinting at criticism of the tsar's\npersonal life, so angered Peter that he forbade Yavorsky to preach in public.\nYavorsky directed a commission on correcting the translation of the Bible and\nwrote The Rock of Faith (), a huge treatise on dogma that \"was sharply anti-\nProtestant in spirit\" and whose publication Peter forbade (it was published in\n1728 under Peter II). In 1721 he was made first president of the newly erected\nHoly Synod, but the real power was held by its vice president, Peter's close\ncollaborator Theophan Prokopovich. When Yavorsky died in the following year,\nProkopovich took his place as president; shortly before his death, suspected of\nbeing involved in a publication that accused Peter of being the Antichrist, he\nwas interrogated in his home by members of the Synod and Senate, and \"it is\npossible that only his death saved Iavorsky from punishment.\" Nikolaev,\n\"Stefan Iavorsky,\" p. 119.\n","linknr":166,"url":"Stephen_Yavorsky","recorded":1375077472,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Stefan_Yavorsky&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Stefan_Yavorsky&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","/wiki/Stefan_Yavorsky","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","/w/index.php?title=Stephen_Yavorsky&redirect=no","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Stephen_Yavorsky.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/Stephen_Yavorsky.jpg/220px-Stephen_Yavorsky.jpg","/wiki/File:Stephen_Yavorsky.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Russian_language","/wiki/Ukrainian_language","/wiki/Russian_language","/wiki/Old_Style_and_New_Style_dates","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Archbishop","/wiki/Russian_Empire","/wiki/Most_Holy_Synod","/wiki/Right-bank_Ukraine","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Nezhin","/wiki/Kyiv-Mohyla_Academy","/wiki/Uniate_church","/wiki/Polish-Lithuanian_Commonwealth","/wiki/Russian_language","/wiki/Lvov","/wiki/Lublin","/wiki/Poznan","/wiki/Vilnius","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Hegumen","/wiki/Russian_language","/wiki/Boyar","/wiki/Aleksei_Shein","/wiki/Patriarch_Adrian","/wiki/Archbishop","/wiki/Ryazan","/wiki/Murom","/wiki/Locum_tenens","#cite_note-4","/wiki/Alexei_Petrovich,_Tsarevich_of_Russia","/wiki/Russian_language","/wiki/Peter_II_of_Russia","/wiki/Most_Holy_Synod","/wiki/Theophan_Prokopovich","/wiki/Antichrist","#cite_note-5","#Literary_activity","#Notes","#See_also","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Stefan_Yavorsky&action=edit&section=1","#cite_note-6","/wiki/Kiev_Pechersk_Lavra","#cite_note-7","/w/index.php?title=Stefan_Yavorsky&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-1","http://dic.academic.ru/dic.nsf/bse/155339/Яворский","/wiki/Old_Style_and_New_Style_dates","http://dic.academic.ru/dic.nsf/brokgauz_efron/97364/Стефан","/wiki/Old_Style_and_New_Style_dates","#cite_ref-2","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0810357119","#cite_ref-3","#cite_ref-4","#cite_ref-5","#cite_ref-6","#cite_ref-7","/w/index.php?title=Stefan_Yavorsky&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/List_of_Metropolitans_and_Patriarchs_of_Moscow","/w/index.php?title=Stefan_Yavorsky&action=edit&section=4","/wiki/File:PD-icon.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/62/PD-icon.svg/12px-PD-icon.svg.png","/wiki/Public_domain","http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Stephen_Yavorsky","/wiki/Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica_Eleventh_Edition","/w/index.php?title=Stefan_Yavorsky&action=edit&section=5","http://worldcat.org/identities/lccn-n84-78788","/wiki/WorldCat","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/8200085","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Stefan_Yavorsky&oldid=542443638","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1658_births","/wiki/Category:1722_deaths","/wiki/Category:People_from_Yavoriv","/wiki/Category:Ukrainian_Orthodox_bishops","/wiki/Category:Eastern_Orthodox_archbishops","/wiki/Category:National_University_of_Kyiv-Mohyla_Academy_alumni","/wiki/Category:National_University_of_Kyiv-Mohyla_Academy_faculty","/wiki/Category:Articles_containing_Russian-language_text","/wiki/Category:Articles_containing_Ukrainian-language_text","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_incorporating_a_citation_from_the_1911_Encyclopaedia_Britannica_without_Wikisource_reference","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_incorporating_text_from_the_1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_incorporating_text_from_the_1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica_with_an_article_parameter","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Stefan+Yavorsky&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Stefan+Yavorsky","/wiki/Stefan_Yavorsky","/wiki/Talk:Stefan_Yavorsky","#","/wiki/Stefan_Yavorsky","/w/index.php?title=Stefan_Yavorsky&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Stefan_Yavorsky&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:Fun
