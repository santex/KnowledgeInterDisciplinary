In lands used for agriculture and other human activities, fertile soil\ntypically arises from the use of soil conservation practices. Basically the\nability of a soil to supply plant nutrients.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Soil_fertility","recorded":1372152596,"links":[],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Soil","Soil improvers","Fertilizers","Horticulture and gardening"],"headings":["Soil fertilization","Light and CO<sub>2</sub> limitations","Soil depletion","Global distribution","See also","References"],"image":[],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Nitrogen","Phosphorus","Potassium","Mineral_matter_in_plants","Boron","Chlorine","Cobalt","Copper","Iron","Manganese","Magnesium","Molybdenum","Sulfur","Zinc","Soil_organic_matter","Soil_structure","Soil_moisture","Soil_pH","Drainage","Rice","Agave","Soil_life","Topsoil","Bioavailability","Cation-exchange_capacity","Hubbert_peak_theory","Photosynthesis","Soil_depletion","Slash-and-burn","Great_Plains","Salinization","Mollisols","Prairie","Pampa","Gran_Chaco","Ukraine","Chernozem","Plaggen_soil","Shifting_cultivation","Soil_contamination","Soil_life","Terra_preta","Fertilizer","Arable_land"]}
