The wounded soldier in the\n lower left of the photo has a dazed thousand-yard stare, a frequent symptom\n of \"shell-shock\".]]\n\n'Shell shock' was the reaction of soldiers in World War I to the trauma of\nbattle. It has been described as a reaction to the intensity of the bombardment\nand fighting that produced a helplessness appearing variously as panic, or\nflight, an inability to reason, sleep, walk or talk. \"Simply put, after even the\nmost obedient soldier had enough shells rain down on him, without any means of\nfighting back, he often lost all self control.\"\n\nDuring the War, the concept of shell shock was ill-defined. Cases of \"shell\nshock\" could be interpreted as either a physical or psychological injury, or\nsimply as a lack of moral fibre. While the term shell shock is no longer used in\neither medical or military discourse, it has entered into popular imagination\nand memory, and is often identified as the signature injury of the War.\n\nIn World War II and thereafter, diagnosis of \"shell shock\" was replaced by that\nof combat stress reaction, a similar but not identical response to the trauma\nof warfare.\n","linknr":210,"url":"Shell_shock","recorded":1362899710,"links":15,"instances":["english_historian","world_war_i"],"pdf":["http://www.simonwessely.com/Downloads/Publications/Military/historical/Jones%202007%20-%20shell%20shock%20mtbi.pdf","http://www.simonwessely.com/Downloads/Publications/Military/unlisted/Wessely_2006_Harry%20Farr.pdf"],"categories":["World War I","Psychiatry","Neurology","History of medicine"],"headings":["Origin","Management of acute shell-shock","Treatment of chronic cases","Shell shock and cowardice","Commission of Enquiry","Impact on the development of psychiatry","Cultural references","See also","References","Sources","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cc/Shellshock2.jpg/300px-Shellshock2.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["british_expeditionary_force","world_war_i"],["ben_shephard","english_historian"]],"members":["ben_shephard","british_expeditionary_force"],"related":["Ypres","Thousand-yard_stare","World_War_I","Combat_stress_reaction","British_Expeditionary_Force_(World_War_I)","Tinnitus","Amnesia","Headache","Charles_Myers","Neurasthenia","Conversion_disorder","Mutism","Fugue_state","Lesion","Carbon_monoxide","British_Army","France","Battle_of_the_Somme","Battle_of_Passchendaele","Regimental_Medical_Officer","Black_Watch","John_Vereker,_6th_Viscount_Gort","Harry_Farr","Post-traumatic_stress_disorder","Effort_Syndrome","Clinical_depression","Siegfried_Sassoon","Craiglockhart_War_Hospital","Robert_Graves","Pat_Barker","Regeneration_Trilogy","W._H._R._Rivers","Combat_stress_reaction","Posttraumatic_stress_disorder","Post-concussion_syndrome","Adam_Hochschild","Ben_Shephard_(English_historian)","Simon_Wessely"]}
