Modern memory psychology\ndifferentiates the two distinct type of memory storage: short-term memory and\nlong-term memory. In addition, different memory models have suggested variations\nof existing short-term and long-term memory to account for different ways of\nstoring memory.\n","linknr":331,"url":"Storage_(memory)","recorded":1362670567,"links":16,"instances":["memory","memory"],"pdf":["http://www.garfield.library.upenn.edu/classics1990/A1990DB80900001.pdf","http://www.garfield.library.upenn.edu/classics1990/A1990DB80900001.pdf"],"categories":["Memory processes","Memory","Mental processes"],"headings":["Types of memory storage","Models of memory storage","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["recall","memory"],["encoding","memory"]],"members":["recall","encoding"],"related":["Memory","Recall_(memory)","Encoding_(memory)","Atkinsonâ€“Shiffrin_memory_model","Scalar_quantities","Neural_network","Neuron","Hebbian_theory","Serial_position_effect","Semantic_memory"]}
