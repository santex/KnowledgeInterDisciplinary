It can be accompanied by yawning.\nStretching often occurs instinctively after waking from sleep, after long\nperiods of inactivity, or after exiting confined spaces and areas.\n\nIncreasing flexibility through stretching is one of the basic tenets of physical\nfitness. It is common for athletes to stretch before and after exercise in order\nto reduce injury and increase performance.<ref name=b1/> Hatha yoga involves the\nstretching of major muscle groups, some of which require a high level of\nflexibility to perform, for example the lotus position. Stretching can\nstrengthen muscles, and in turn strong muscles are important to stretching\nsafely and effectively.<ref name=\"ris\"></ref>\n\nStretching can be dangerous when performed incorrectly. There are many\ntechniques for stretching in general, but depending on which muscle group is\nbeing stretched, some techniques may be ineffective or detrimental, even to the\npoint of causing permanent damage to the tendons, ligaments and muscle\nfiber.<ref name=\"ris\"/> The physiological nature of stretching and theories\nabout the effect of various techniques are therefore subject to heavy inquiry.\n","title":"stretching","headings":["Physiology","Types of stretches","Benefits","Research and controversy","References","Further reading"]},"micro-relation":["2: Synovial_fluid","1: Physical_exercise","1: Skeletal_muscle","1: Tendon","1: Muscle_tone","1: Physical_therapy","1: Cramps","1: Instinctive","1: Human","1: Animal","1: Yawn","1: Hatha_yoga","1: Lotus_position","1: Tendons","1: Ligaments","1: Muscle","1: Protein","1: Titin","1: Myofibrils","1: Proprioceptive_neuromuscular_facilitation","1: Range_of_motion","1: Sportsperson","1: Running","1: PNF_stretching","1: Arthritis","1: Active_stretching","1: Capsular_mobility","1: FlexiScore","1: Joint-muscle_compliance","1: Stretch-shortening_cycle"]}
