For instance, shooting a\nfreethrow, running a marathon, and performing a handstand all require dedicated\nwork on those skills. An SPP phase generally follows a phase of General Physical\nPreparedness, or GPP, which lays out an athletic base from which to build.\n\nRelated movements that mimic certain aspects of the movement which can be\nspecialized in and put together to form it are also part of specific training.\n","linknr":95,"url":"Specific_Physical_Preparedness","recorded":1362375139,"links":18,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Exercise physiology"],"headings":["External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e1/Ambox_wikify.svg/40px-Ambox_wikify.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["General_Physical_Preparedness"]}
