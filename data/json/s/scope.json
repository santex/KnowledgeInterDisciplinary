They are equipped with some form of\ngraphic image pattern (a reticle) mounted in an optically appropriate position\nin their optical system to give an accurate aiming point. Telescopic sights are\nused with all types of systems that require accurate aiming but are most\ncommonly found on firearms, particularly rifles. Other types of sights are iron\nsights, reflector (reflex) sights, and laser sights.\n","title":"Telescopic%20sight","headings":["History","Types","Reticles","Parallax compensation","Bullet Drop Compensation","Adjustment controls","Accessories","Optronic technologies","Mounting","Uses","See also","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["4: Night_vision_device","4: Carl_Zeiss_AG","3: Eyepiece","3: Advanced_Combat_Optical_Gunsight","3: Rimfire_ammunition","3: Steyr_AUG","3: Picatinny_rail","2: Reticle","2: Rifle","2: Eye_relief","2: Magnification","2: Scout_rifle","2: Stadiametric_rangefinding","2: SUSAT","2: Elcan","2: Trijicon","2: Parallax","2: PSO-1","2: Swarovski_Optik","2: Laser_rangefinder","2: Heckler_&_Koch_G36","2: STANAG","2: Schmidt_&_Bender","2: Reflex_sight","2: SA80","1: Refracting_telescope","1: Firearm","1: Iron_sight","1: Reflector_sight","1: Laser_sight","1: Improved_American_Rifle","1: John_Ratcliffe_Chapman","1: Chapman-James_sight","1: William_Malcolm","1: Davidson_telescopic_sight","1: Parker_Hale_telescopic_sight","1: Refractor_telescope","1: Stronsdorf","1: Zf-41","1: Karabiner_98k","1: Zielgerät_1229","1: Night_vision#Active_infrared","1: StG_44","1: Optical","1: Objective_lens","1: Diameter","1: Exit_pupil","1: Prime_lens","1: Zoom_lens","1: Field_of_view","1: Linear","1: Angle","1: Vignetting","1: Handgun","1: Recoil","1: Windage","1: Leupold","1: Minute_of_arc","1: Angular_mil","1: NATO","1: Whitetail_Buck","1: LED","1: Night_vision","1: Radioactive_isotopes","1: C79_Optical_Sight","1: Tritium","1: Radioactive_decay","1: Fiber_optics","1: Shotgun","1: Muzzleloader","1: Airgun","1: Focal_length","1: Gravity","1: Bullet","1: Bullet_drop","1: Muzzle_velocity","1: Air_density","1: External_ballistics","1: External_ballistics#Forces_acting_on_the_projectile","1: External_ballistics#External_factors","1: Laser_safety","1: Barrett_Firearms_Company","1: ELCAN_Optical_Technologies","1: Charge-coupled_device","1: Liquid_crystal_display","1: Infrared","1: SAR_21","1: Sturm,_Ruger_&_Co.","1: Super_Redhawk","1: Dovetail","1: Air_gun","1: Weaver_rail","1: MIL-STD-1913","1: Sako","1: Rail_Integration_System","1: Picatinny_Arsenal","1: New_Jersey","1: Weaver_rail_mount","1: NATO_Accessory_Rail","1: Tactical_light","1: Laser_aiming_module","1: Foregrip","1: Bipod","1: Bayonet","1: Small_arms","1: Thompson_Center_Arms","1: Accuracy_International_AS50","1: Lever_action","1: Presbyopia","1: Crosshair","1: Centerfire","1: Camp_Hansen","1: Military","1: Sniper","1: Finland","1: Simo_Häyhä","1: Iron_sights","1: Warsaw_Pact","1: Designated_marksmen","1: I.O.R.","1: Stadiametric_rangefinder","1: Russia","1: POSP","1: Al_Aqsa_Intifada","1: AK-47","1: Infantry","1: US_military","1: M16_rifle","1: M4_carbine","1: Diemaco_C7","1: C79_optical_sight","1: Red_dot_sight"]}
