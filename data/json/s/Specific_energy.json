{"cursor":"6614","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Specific energy' is defined as energy per unit mass. It is used to quantify,\nfor example, stored heat or other thermodynamic properties of substances such as\nspecific internal energy, specific enthalpy, specific Gibbs free energy, and\nspecific Helmholtz free energy. It may also be used for the kinetic energy or\npotential energy of a body. Specific energy is an intensive property, whereas\nenergy and mass are extensive property.\n\nThe SI unit for specific energy is the joule per kilogram (J/kg). Other units\nstill in use in some contexts are the calorie and kilocalorie per kilogram\n(Cal/kg or kcal/kg), mostly in food-related topics; and the Imperial unit BTU\nper pound (BTU/lb), in some engineering and applied technical fields.

ISBN 0881734357  The gray and\nsievert are specialized measures for specific energy absorbed by body tissues in\nthe form of radiation.\n\nThe concept of specific energy is related but distinct from the chemical notion\nof molar energy, that is energy per mole of a substance. Although one mole of a\nsubstance has a definite molar mass, the mole is tecnically an adimensional\nunit, a pure number (the number of atoms or molecules divided by Avogadro's\nconstant). Therefore, for molar quantities like molar enthalpy one uses units of\nenergy per mole, such as J/mol, kJ/mol, or the older (but still widely used)\nkcal/mol.

ISBN 940070710X \n\nBy dividing by 3.6 the figures for megajoules per kilogram can be converted to\nkilowatt-hours per kilogram. However, the useful energy available by extraction\nfrom an energy store is always less than the energy put into the energy store,\nas explained by the laws of thermodynamics.\n","linknr":172,"url":"Specific_energy","recorded":1362375086,"links":18,"instances":["unit","disambiguation","unit"],"pdf":["http://www.okinawaprogram.com/pdf/caloric_density_pyramid.pdf","http://www.okinawaprogram.com/pdf/caloric_density_pyramid.pdf"],"categories":["Energy (physics)","Thermodynamics"],"headings":["Energy density of food","Astrodynamics","Miscellaneous","See also","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["gray","unit"],["mole","unit"],["mole","unit"],["specific_power","disambiguation"]],"members":["gray","specific_power","mole"],"related":["Energy","Mass","Heat","Thermodynamic_properties","Specific_internal_energy","Specific_enthalpy","Gibbs_free_energy","Helmholtz_free_energy","Kinetic_energy","Potential_energy","Intensive_property","Extensive_property","International_System_of_Units","Joule","Kilogram","Calorie","Kilocalorie","Imperial_System","BTU","Pound","Engineering","Gray_(unit)","Sievert","Radiation","Chemistry","Mole_(unit)","Molar_mass","Adimensional","Avogadro's_constant","Molar_enthalpy","Mole_(unit)","Kilocalorie","Laws_of_thermodynamics","Kilojoule","Calorie","Metabolized","Food_energy","Carbon_dioxide","Ethanol","Carbohydrate","Fat","Protein","Water","Fiber","Sugar_alcohol","Astrodynamics","Conservation_of_energy","Newton's_law_of_universal_gravitation","Kinetic_energy","Potential_energy","Standard_gravity","Heat","Specific_heat_capacity","Temperature","Latent_heat","Standard_enthalpy_change_of_vaporization","Energy_density","Specific_power_(disambiguation)","Heating_value","Specific_orbital_energy"]}
