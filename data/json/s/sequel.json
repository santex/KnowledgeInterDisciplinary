In the common context of a narrative work of fiction, a\nsequel portrays events set in the same fictional universe as an earlier work,\nusually chronologically following the events of that work.<ref></ref>\n\nIn many cases, the sequel continues elements of the original story, often with\nthe same characters and settings. A sequel can lead to a series, in which key\nelements appear in a number of stories. Although the difference between more\nthan one sequel and a series is somewhat arbitrary, it is clear that some media\nfranchises have enough sequels to become a series, whether originally planned as\nsuch or not.\n\nSequels are attractive to creators and to publishers because there is less risk\ninvolved in returning to a story with known popularity rather than developing\nnew and untested characters and settings. Audiences are sometimes eager for more\nstories about popular characters or settings, making the production of sequels\nfinancially appealing.<ref></ref>\n\nIn movies, sequels are common. There are many name formats for sequels. Usually,\nthey either have unrelated titles, such as [[The Jewel of the Nile]], the sequel\nto [[Romancing the Stone]], or the same title as the original, but with a number\nadded, as in [[Lethal Weapon 2]], sequel to [[Lethal Weapon]]. Sometimes such\ntitles have subtitles as well (e.g. [[Home Alone 2: Lost in New York]]). It is\nalso common for a sequel to have a variation of the original title (such as\n[[Men of Boys Town]], sequel to [[Boys Town (film)|Boys Town]]). In the 1930s,\nmany musical sequels had the year included in the title ([[Gold Diggers of\n1933]]), in the style of Broadway revues such as the [[Ziegfeld Follies]].\n","title":"sequel","headings":["Chronologies","History","Media franchises","Unofficial sequels","Titles","See also","References","Further reading","External links"]},"micro-relation":["2: Narrative","2: Fictional_universe","2: Film_series","2: Media_franchise","2: Star_Wars_Expanded_Universe","2: Prequel","1: Document","1: Literature","1: Film","1: Theatre","1: Music","1: Fiction","1: Chronological","1: Chronology","1: Neologism","1: Star_Wars#Prequel_trilogy","1: The_Chronicles_of_Narnia","1: David_Peoples","1: Clint_Eastwood","1: Bruce_Almighty","1: Storytelling","1: Western_literature","1: Bible","1: Apocrypha","1: Novella","1: Novel","1: Print_culture","1: Samuel_Richardson","1: Henry_Fielding","1: Sarah_Fielding","1: Software_development","1: Video_game_industry","1: Merchandising","1: Giant_panda","1: Goose","1: Comic_book","1: Greg_Weisman","1: Graphic_novel","1: Bungie_Studios","1: Lucasfilm","1: Public_domain","1: Jean_Rhys","1: Copyright","1: Margaret_Mitchell","1: Alice_Randall","1: Parody","1: Laura_Kalpakian","1: Victor_Hugo","1: Donald_Kingsbury","1: Isaac_Asimov","1: Antoine_de_Saint-Exupéry","1: John_Cusack","1: 20th_Century_Fox","1: Jacqueline_Susann","1: William_Powell","1: Myrna_Loy","1: Mickey_Rooney","1: Andy_Hardy","1: World_cinema","1: Satyajit_Ray","1: Akira_Kurosawa","1: Sergio_Leone","1: James_Bond","1: Ian_Fleming","1: Roman_numeral","1: Homophone","1: Home_video","1: Germany","1: German_language","1: Macaulay_Culkin","1: Id_Software","1: Plural","1: Led_Zeppelin","1: Weezer","1: Peter_Gabriel","1: Cliffhanger","1: List_of_video_game_franchises","1: List_of_film_sequels_by_box-office_improvement","1: List_of_the_longest_gaps_between_film_sequels","1: Spiritual_successor","1: Tetralogy","1: Trilogy"]}
