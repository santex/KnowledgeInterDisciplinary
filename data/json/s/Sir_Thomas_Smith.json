{"cursor":"8781","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n'Sir Thomas Smith' (23 December 1513 â 12 August 1577) was an English scholar\nand diplomat.\n\nHe was born at Saffron Walden in Essex. He was educated at Queens' College,\nCambridge, where he became a fellow in 1530, and in 1533 was\nappointed a public reader or professor. He lectured in the schools on natural\nphilosophy, and on Greek in his own rooms. In 1540 Smith went abroad, and, after\nstudying in France and Italy and taking a degree of law at the University of\nPadua, returned to Cambridge in 1542.\n\nHe now took the lead in the reform of the pronunciation of Greek, his views\nafter considerable controversy being universally adopted. He and his friend, Sir\nJohn Cheke, were the great classical scholars of the time in England. In January\n1543/4 he was appointed first Regius Professor of Civil Law. He was vice-\nchancellor of the university the same year. In 1547 he became provost of Eton\nCollege and dean of Carlisle Cathedral.\n\nHe was an early convert to Protestant views, which brought him into prominence\nwhen Edward VI came to the throne. During Somerset's protectorate he entered\npublic life and was made a secretary of state, being sent on an important\ndiplomatic mission to Brussels. In 1548 he was knighted. On the accession of\nQueen Mary I he lost all his offices, but in the reign of her sister, Elizabeth,\nwas prominently employed in public affairs. He became a member of parliament,\nand was sent in 1562 as ambassador to France, where he remained till 1566; and\nin 1572 he again went to France in the same capacity for a short time. He\nremained one of Elizabeth's most trusted Protestant counsellors, being appointed\nin 1572 chancellor of the Order of the Garter and a secretary of state.\n\nSir Thomas Smithâs failed colony in Ireland:\n\n\"In 1571, Elizabeth, a great believer in colonization, granted her Secretary-of-\nState Sir Thomas Smith a huge 360,000 acres of East Ulster to plant English\nsettlers in an effort to seize control of the Clandeboye OâNeill territory and\ncontrol the native Irish. The grant included all of the area we know of today as\nNorth Down and the Ards, apart from the southern tip of the Peninsula, which was\ncontrolled by the Anglo-Norman Savage family.\n","linknr":215,"url":"Sir_Thomas_Smith","recorded":1375082813,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Thomas_Smith_(diplomat)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Thomas_Smith_(diplomat)&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","/wiki/Thomas_Smith_(diplomat)","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","/w/index.php?title=Sir_Thomas_Smith&redirect=no","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Thomas_Smith_(disambiguation)","/wiki/File:SirThomasSmithD1577.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c1/SirThomasSmithD1577.jpg/200px-SirThomasSmithD1577.jpg","/wiki/File:SirThomasSmithD1577.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Kingdom_of_England","/wiki/Diplomat","/wiki/Saffron_Walden","/wiki/Essex,_England","/wiki/Queens%27_College,_Cambridge","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Natural_philosophy","/wiki/Greek_language","/wiki/France","/wiki/Italy","/wiki/Law","/wiki/University_of_Padua","/wiki/John_Cheke","/wiki/Regius_Professor_of_Civil_Law_(Cambridge)","/wiki/Eton_College","/wiki/Carlisle_Cathedral","/wiki/Protestant","/wiki/Edward_VI_of_England","/wiki/Edward_Seymour,_1st_Duke_of_Somerset","/wiki/Secretary_of_State_(England)","/wiki/Brussels","/wiki/Knight","/wiki/Mary_I_of_England","/wiki/Elizabeth_I_of_England","/wiki/Order_of_the_Garter","/wiki/Elizabeth_I_of_England","/wiki/Colonialism","/wiki/Secretary_of_State_(United_Kingdom)","/wiki/Ulster","/wiki/Clandeboye","/wiki/O%27Neill_dynasty","/wiki/Old_English_(Ireland)","/wiki/Savage_family_(Ireland)","#Destroying_the_land","#Marriages_and_heir","#Life.27s_work","#Footnotes","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Thomas_Smith_(diplomat)&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Clandeboye","/wiki/O%27Neill_dynasty","/wiki/Brian_O%27Neill_(1574)","/wiki/Elizabeth_I_of_England","/wiki/O%27Neill_dynasty","/wiki/O%27Neill_dynasty","/wiki/Scorched_earth","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Member_of_Parliament","/wiki/Parliament_of_England","/wiki/Marlborough_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Grampound_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Liverpool_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Essex_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","#cite_note-3","/w/index.php?title=Thomas_Smith_(diplomat)&action=edit&section=2","#cite_note-4","#cite_note-5","/wiki/Great_Hampden","/wiki/Buckinghamshire","#cite_note-6","#cite_note-7","/wiki/Theydon_Mount","/wiki/Essex","#cite_note-8","/wiki/Matthew_Brend","/wiki/Globe_Theatre","#cite_note-9","/w/index.php?title=Thomas_Smith_(diplomat)&action=edit&section=3","http://www.constitution.org/eng/repang.htm","/w/index.php?title=Thomas_Smith_(diplomat)&action=edit&section=4","#cite_ref-1","http://venn.lib.cam.ac.uk/cgi-bin/search.pl?sur=&suro=c&fir=&firo=c&cit=&cito=c&c=all&tex=SMT526T&sye=&eye=&col=all&maxcount=50","/wiki/Alumni_Cantabrigienses","#cite_ref-2","http://www.ulsterscotstrail.com/taxonomy/term/1","#cite_ref-3","#CITEREFRichardson_II2011","#cite_ref-4","#CITEREFDewar1964","#cite_ref-5","#CITEREFRichardson_II2011","#cite_ref-6","#CITEREFDewar1964","#cite_ref-7","#CITEREFRichardson_II2011","#cite_ref-8","#CITEREFDewar1964","#cite_ref-9","#CITEREFCollins1741","#CITEREFBerry1987","/w/index.php?title=Thomas_Smith_(diplomat)&action=edit&section=5","/wiki/Help:CS1_errors#accessdate_missing_url","http://books.google.ca/books?id=2GQUAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA345","/wiki/Help:CS1_errors#accessdate_missing_url","/wiki/Special:BookSources/1449966381","/wiki/File:PD-icon.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/62/PD-icon.svg/12px-PD-icon.svg.png","/wiki/Public_domain","/wiki/Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica_Eleventh_Edition","/w/index.php?title=Thomas_Smith_(diplomat)&action=edit&section=6","http://worldcat.org/identities/lccn-n79-21971","/wiki/WorldCat","http://www.archive.org/details/lifelearnedsirt01strygoog","/wiki/John_Strype","http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1509-1558/member/smith-thomas-i-1513-77","/wiki/William_Howard,_1st_Baron_Howard_of_Effingham","/wiki/Lord_Privy_Seal","/wiki/Francis_Walsingham","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/89477220","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Thomas_Smith_(diplomat)&oldid=564129857","/wiki/Help
