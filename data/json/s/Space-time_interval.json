{"cursor":"42552","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nIn physics, 'spacetime' (also 'spaceâtime', 'space time' or 'spaceâtime\ncontinuum') is any mathematical model that combines space and time into a single\ncontinuum. Spacetime is usually interpreted with space as existing in three\ndimensions and time playing the role of a fourth dimension that is of a\ndifferent sort from the spatial dimensions. From a Euclidean space perspective,\nthe universe has three dimensions of space and one of time. By combining space\nand time into a single manifold, physicists have significantly simplified a\nlarge number of physical theories, as well as described in a more uniform way\nthe workings of the universe at both the supergalactic and subatomic levels.\n\nIn non-relativistic classical mechanics, the use of Euclidean space instead of\nspacetime is appropriate, as time is treated as universal and constant, being\nindependent of the state of motion of an observer. In relativistic contexts,\ntime cannot be separated from the three dimensions of space, because the\nobserved rate at which time passes for an object depends on the object's\nvelocity relative to the observer and also on the strength of gravitational\nfields, which can slow the passage of time.\n\nIn cosmology, the concept of spacetime combines space and time to a single\nabstract universe. Mathematically it is a manifold consisting of \"events\" which\nare described by some type of coordinate system. Typically three spatial\ndimensions (length, width, height), and one temporal dimension (time) are\nrequired. Dimensions are independent components of a coordinate grid needed to\nlocate a point in a certain defined \"space\". For example, on the globe the\nlatitude and longitude are two independent coordinates which together uniquely\ndetermine a location. In spacetime, a coordinate grid that spans the 3+1\ndimensions locates events (rather than just points in space), i.e. time is\nadded as another dimension to the coordinate grid. This way the coordinates\nspecify where and when events occur. However, the unified nature of spacetime\nand the freedom of coordinate choice it allows imply that to express the\ntemporal coordinate in one coordinate system requires both temporal and spatial\ncoordinates in another coordinate system. Unlike in normal spatial coordinates,\nthere are still restrictions for how measurements can be made spatially and\ntemporally (see Spacetime intervals). These restrictions correspond roughly to\na particular mathematical model which differs from Euclidean space in its\nmanifest symmetry.\n\nUntil the beginning of the 20th century, time was believed to be independent of\nmotion, progressing at a fixed rate in all reference frames; however, later\nexperiments revealed that time slows at higher speeds of the reference frame\nrelative to another reference frame. Such slowing, called time dilation, is\nexplained in special relativity theory. Many experiments have confirmed time\ndilation, such as the relativistic decay of muons from cosmic ray showers and\nthe slowing of atomic clocks aboard a Space Shuttle relative to synchronized Earth-\nbound inertial clocks. The duration of time can therefore vary according to\nevents and reference frames.\n\nWhen dimensions are understood as mere components of the grid system, rather\nthan physical attributes of space, it is easier to understand the alternate\ndimensional views as being simply the result of coordinate transformations.\n\nThe term spacetime has taken on a generalized meaning beyond treating spacetime\nevents with the normal 3+1 dimensions. It is really the combination of space and\ntime. Other proposed spacetime theories include additional\ndimensions—normally spatial but there exist some speculative theories that\ninclude additional temporal dimensions and even some that include dimensions\nthat are neither temporal nor spatial (e.g. superspace). How many dimensions are\nneeded to describe the universe is still an open question. Speculative theories\nsuch as string theory predict 10 or 26 dimensions (with M-theory predicting 11\ndimensions: 10 spatial and 1 temporal), but the existence of more than four\ndimensions would only appear to make a difference at the subatomic level. ,\n[http://books.google.com/books?id=uN5_DQWSR14C&pg=PT157 Extract of
