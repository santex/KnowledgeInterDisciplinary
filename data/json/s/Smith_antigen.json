LSm is a contraction of 'like Sm', because\nthe first identified members of the LSm protein family were the 'Sm proteins'.\nLSm proteins are defined by a characteristic three dimensional structure and\ntheir assembly into rings of six or seven individual LSm protein molecules.\n\nThe Sm proteins were first discovered as antigens targeted by so called 'Anti-Sm\nantibodies' in a patient with a form of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), a\ndebilitating autoimmune disease. They were named Sm proteins in honor of this\npatient, Stephanie Smith. Other proteins with very similar structures were\nsubsequently discovered and named LSm proteins. New members of the LSm protein\nfamily continue to be identified and reported.\n\nProteins with similar structures are grouped into a hierarchy of protein\nfamilies, superfamilies, and folds. The LSm protein structure is an example of a\nsmall beta sheet folded into a short barrel. Individual LSm proteins assemble\ninto a six or seven member doughnut ring (more properly termed a torus), which\nusually binds to a small RNA molecule to form a ribonucleoprotein complex. The\nLSm torus assists the RNA molecule to assume and maintain its proper three\ndimensional structure. Depending on which LSm proteins and RNA molecule are\ninvolved, this ribonucleoprotein complex facilitates a wide variety of RNA\nprocessing including degradation, editing, splicing, and regulation.\n\nAlternate terms for 'LSm family' are 'LSm fold' and 'Sm-like fold', and\nalternate capitalization styles such as 'lsm', 'LSM', and 'Lsm' are common and\nequally acceptable.\n","linknr":489,"url":"Smith_antigen","recorded":1362480250,"links":14,"instances":["biology","biology","protein","biology","genetics","protein","protein"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Proteins","Spliceosome"],"headings":["History","Characteristics","Functions","Evolution
