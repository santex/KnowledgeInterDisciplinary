{"cursor":"3140","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nIn mathematics, a 'shear matrix' or 'transvection' is an elementary matrix that\nrepresents the addition of a multiple of one row or column to another. Such a\nmatrix may be derived by taking the identity matrix and replacing one of the\nzero elements with a non-zero value.\n\nA typical shear matrix is shown below:\n\n: S=\n\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & \\lambda & 0 \\\\ & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n& 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}. \n\nThe name shear reflects the fact that the matrix represents a shear\ntransformation. Geometrically, such a transformation takes pairs of points in a\nlinear space, that are purely axially separated along the axis whose row in the\nmatrix contains the shear element, and effectively replaces those pairs by pairs\nwhose separation is no longer purely axial but has two vector components. Thus,\nthe shear axis is always an eigenvector of S.\n\nA shear parallel to the x axis results in x' = x + \\lambda y and y' =\ny. In matrix form:\n\n::\n\\begin{pmatrix} x' \\\\ y' \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & \\lambda \\\\ & 1\n\\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix}. \n\nSimilarly, a shear parallel to the y axis has x' = x and y' = y\n+ \\lambda x. In matrix form:\n\n::\n\\begin{pmatrix}x' \\\\ y' \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ \\lambda & 1\n\\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix}. \n\nClearly the determinant will always be 1, as no matter where the shear element\nis placed, it will be a member of a skew-diagonal that also contains zero\nelements (as all skew-diagonals have length at least two) hence its product will\nremain zero and won't contribute to the determinant. Thus every shear matrix has\nan inverse, and the inverse is simply a shear matrix with the shear element\nnegated, representing a shear transformation in the opposite direction. In fact,\nthis is part of an easily derived more general result: if S is a shear matrix\nwith shear element \\lambda , then S n is a shear matrix\nwhose shear element is simply n \\lambda . Hence, raising a shear\nmatrix to a power n multiplies its shear factor by n.\n","linknr":110,"url":"Shear_matrix","recorded":1362891792,"links":16,"instances":["geometry","geometry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Matrices","Linear algebra","Sparse matrices"],"headings":["Properties","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/1/7/5179dfb4f045e59df8d6807c42dfc8f5.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/0/5/e05a30d96800384dd38b22851322a6b5.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/e/d/5ed45b17139b82b7d2c20f06b595e793.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/0/5/e05a30d96800384dd38b22851322a6b5.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/a/7/d/a7d9087968f04f584c5e16809cbca16b.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/0/5/e05a30d96800384dd38b22851322a6b5.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/0/5/e05a30d96800384dd38b22851322a6b5.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/Rubik%27s_cube_v3.svg/40px-Rubik%27s_cube_v3.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["area","geometry"],["volume","geometry"]],"members":["volume","area"],"related":["Mathematics","Elementary_matrix","Identity_matrix","Shear_mapping","Eigenvector","Shear_factor","Eigenvalue","Eigenspace","Block_matrix","Area_(geometry)","Volume_(geometry)","Polytope","Transformation_matrix"]}
