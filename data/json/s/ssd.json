SSD technology uses electronic interfaces compatible with\ntraditional block input/output (I/O) hard disk drives.\n\nSSDs have no moving mechanical components, which distinguish them from\ntraditional electromechanical magnetic disks such as hard disk drives (HDDs) or\nfloppy disks, which contain spinning disks and movable read/write heads.<ref name=\"STEC\">STEC.\"[http://www.stec-\ninc.com/downloads/whitepapers/Performance_Power_Advantages.pdf SSD Power Savings\nRender Significant Reduction to TCO].\" Retrieved October 25, 2010.</ref>\nCompared with electromechanical disks, SSDs are typically less susceptible to\nphysical shock, run more quietly, have lower access time, and less latency.<ref\nname=\"dell-study\"></ref> However, while the price of SSDs has continued to\ndecline in 2012,<ref name=\"SSD prices in steady, substantial decline\"></ref>\nSSDs are still about 7 to 8 times more expensive per unit of storage than HDDs.\n\nMany SSDs use I/O interfaces developed for hard disk drives, thus permitting\nsimple replacement in common applications.<ref name=\"SNIA-101\"></ref>\n\n, most SSDs use NAND-based flash memory, which retains data without power. For\napplications requiring fast access, but not necessarily data persistence after\npower loss, SSDs may be constructed from random-access memory (RAM). Such\ndevices may employ separate power sources, such as batteries, to maintain data\nafter power loss.<ref name=\"SNIA-101\"/>\n\nHybrid drives or solid state hybrid drives (SSHD)<ref name=\"Solid State Hybrid\nTechnology: Seagate\"></ref><ref name=\"WD Black SSHD -
