      "text" : "\n\n (202 BC - 220 AD) Chinese ceramic figurine of a lady servant in a standard\n formal pose with hands covered by long sleeve cuffs in the traditional\n fashions]] A 'domestic worker', is a person who works within the employer's\n household. Domestic workers perform a variety of household services for an\n individual or a family, from providing care for children and elderly\n dependents to cleaning and household maintenance, known as housekeeping.\n Responsibilities may also include cooking, doing laundry and ironing, food\n shopping and other household errands. Some domestic workers live within the\n household where they work.\n\nThe conditions faced by domestic workers have varied considerably throughout\nhistory and in the contemporary world. In the course of twentieth-century\nmovements for labour rights, women's rights and immigrant rights, the conditions\nfaced by domestic workers and the problems specific to their class of employment\nhave come to the fore. In 2011, the International Labour Organization adopted\nthe Convention Concerning Decent Work for Domestic Workers which covers decent\nwork conditions for domestic workers. Recent ILO estimates based on national\nsurveys and/or censuses of 117 countries, place the number of domestic workers\nat around 53 million. But the ILO itself states that \"experts say that due to\nthe fact that this kind of work is often hidden and unregistered, the total\nnumber of domestic workers could be as high as 100 million\". The ILO also states\nthat 83% of domestic workers are women and many are migrant workers.\n\nServant is an older English term for \"domestic worker\", though not all servants\nworked inside the home.\n",
