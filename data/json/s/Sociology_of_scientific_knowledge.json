The sociology of knowledge, by contrast, focuses on the production of\nnon-scientific ideas and social constructions.\n\nSociologists of scientific knowledge study the development of a scientific field\nand attempt to identify points of contingency or interpretative flexibility\nwhere ambiguities are present. Such variations may be linked to a variety of\npolitical, historical, cultural or economic factors. Crucially, the field does\nnot set out to promote relativism or to attack the scientific project; the aim\nof the researcher is to explain why one interpretation rather than another\nsucceeds due to external social and historical circumstances.\n\nThe field emerged in the late 1960s and early 1970s and at first was an almost\nexclusively British practice. Other early centers for the development of the\nfield were in France, Germany, and the United States (notably at Cornell Univer-\nsity). http://www.questia.com/googleScholar.qst;jsessionid=Lk9T2HDmM1t6PHgg-\nWkXy9Ny7Cv75T9TskJwwvw8PyFgdmccphCr7!601689703!-129296667?docId=5000344671\nMajor theorists include Barry Barnes, David Bloor, Sal Restivo, Randall Collins,\nGaston Bachelard, Harry Collins, Paul Feyerabend, Steve Fuller, Thomas Kuhn,\nMartin Kusch, Bruno Latour, Mike Mulkay, Derek J. de Solla Price, Lucy Suchman\nand Anselm Strauss.\n","recorded":1362124698,"portal":[],"list":[],"links":"359","instances":["philosophy_of_science","sociologist","philosophy","philosophy","philosophy","magazine","sociology","philosophy_of_science","sociology","sociology","sociology"],"pdf":["http://www-staff.lboro.ac.uk/~ssde/Death%20and%20furniture.pdf","http://www.comunicazione.uniroma1.it/materiali/16.47.15_WilliamsEdge_1996_TheSocialShapingOfTechnology.pdf"],"categories":["Science and technology studies","Sociology of scientific knowledge|*","Philosophy of science","Historiography of science","Subfields of sociology|Scientific knowledge, sociology of","Science studies","Social constructionism","Sociology index","Sociology of knowledge"],"headings":["Programmes and schools","The sociology of mathematical knowledge","Criticism","See also","References","Other relevant materials","External links"],"tags":[["steve_fuller","sociologist"],["steve_fuller","sociologist"],["middle_range_theory","sociology"],["deviance","sociology"],["rationalization","sociology"],["social_psychology","sociology"],["steve_fuller","sociologist"],["lingua_franca","magazine"],["steve_fuller","sociologist"],["lingua_franca","magazine"],["lingua_franca","magazine"],["commensurability","philosophy_of_science"],["construct","philosophy_of_science"],["nature","philosophy"],["objectivity","philosophy"],["naturalism","philosophy"]],"image":["http://en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:SNA_segment.png","http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c7/SNA_segment.png/180px-SNA_segment.png","http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","http://bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","http://bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"related":["Science","Sociology_of_knowledge","Social_construction","Political","Historical","Cultural","Economic","S._Barry_Barnes","David_Bloor","Sal_Restivo","Randall_Collins","Gaston_Bachelard","Harry_Collins","Paul_Feyerabend","Steve_Fuller_(sociologist)","Thomas_Kuhn","Martin_Kusch","Bruno_Latour","Mike_Mulkay","Derek_J._de_Solla_Price","Lucy_Suchman","Anselm_Strauss","Sociology_of_science","Robert_K._Merton","David_Bloor","Strong_program","Sociological","Imre_Lakatos","Thomas_Kuhn","David_Bloor","University_of_Edinburgh","Harry_Collins","University_of_Bath","Michael_Mulkay","Mathematical_practice","Quasi-empiricism_in_mathematics","Mathematics","Eugene_Wigner","Hilary_Putnam","Physics","Mathematics","Calculus","Sal_Restivo","David_Bloor","Oswald_Spengler","David_Bloor","Ludwig_Wittgenstein","Paul_Ernest","Science_and_technology_studies","Actor-network_theory","Reductionism","Anthropocentrism","Alan_Sokal","Physics","Postmodern","Cultural_studies","Intellectual_rigor","Hermeneutics","Quantum_Gravity","Science_Wars","Quantum_gravity","Peer_review","Scholarly_method","Postmodernism","Ethics","Intellectual_rigor","Publishing","Sokal_affair","Science_and_technology_studies","Social_constructionism","Sociology_of_knowledge","Historiography_of_science","Scientific_Community_Metaphor","Paradigm_shift","Philosophy_of_social_science","Economics_of_scientific_knowledge","S._Barry_Barnes","David_Bloor","Sal_Restivo","Randall_Collins","Gaston_Bachelard","Paul_Feyerabend","Thomas_Kuhn","Martin_Kusch","Anselm_Strauss","Lucy_Suchman","Harry_Collins","Mike_Mulkay","Steve_Fuller_(sociologist)","Sheila_Jasanoff"],"members":["commensurability","steve_fuller","objectivity","naturalism","nature","lingua_franca","social_psychology","construct","middle_range_theory","rationalization","deviance"],"book":[]}
