{"cursor":"1379","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nThe 'Southern Hemisphere Auroral Radar Experiment (SHARE)', started 1988, is an\nAntarctic research project designed to observe velocities and irregularities of\nelectrical fields in the ionosphere and magnetosphere. SHARE is operated jointly\nby the University of Natal, Potchefstroom University, the British Antarctic\nSurvey and Johns Hopkins University and operates out of British Halley Station,\nSouth African SANAE IV Station and Japanese Showa Station.\n\nUsing a total of 16 antennas, each mounted on a 12 m tower and radiating on\nfixed frequencies in the 8â20 MHz range, SHARE transmits an RF pulse into the\nupper atmosphere every two minutes. The three stations' ranges overlap to cover\nmost of the Antarctic continent.\n\nSHARE is part of the international Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN).\nIt supplies valuable data to track space weather.\n","linknr":156,"url":"Southern_Hemisphere_Auroral_Radar_Experiment","recorded":1362673553,"links":16,"instances":["antarctica"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Meteorology research and field projects","Radio frequency propagation","Plasma physics","Ground radars","Science and technology in Antarctica","Astronomy in the Antarctic"],"headings":[],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/86/SHARE_Antenna_Array.jpg/200px-SHARE_Antenna_Array.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf8/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/54/Science.jpg/30px-Science.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["showa_station","antarctica"]],"members":["showa_station"],"related":["Antarctica","Ionosphere","Magnetosphere","University_of_Natal","Potchefstroom_University","British_Antarctic_Survey","Johns_Hopkins_University","Halley_Research_Station","SANAE_IV","Showa_Station_(Antarctica)","MHz","Super_Dual_Auroral_Radar_Network","Space_weather"]}
