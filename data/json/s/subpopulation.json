Since in this case and many\nothers it is impossible to observe the entire statistical population, due to\ntime constraints, constraints of geographical accessibility, and constraints on\nthe researcher's resources, a researcher would instead observe a statistical\nsample from the population in order to attempt to learn something about the\npopulation as a whole.\n","title":"Statistical%20population%23Subpopulation","headings":["Subpopulation","See also","External links"]},"micro-relation":["1: Statistical_inference","1: Random_sample","1: Geography","1: Statistical_sample","1: Subset","1: Heterogeneous","1: Mixture_model","1: Kurtosis","1: Bimodal_distribution","1: Overdispersion"]}
