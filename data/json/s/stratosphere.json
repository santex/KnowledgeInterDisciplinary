It is stratified in temperature,\nwith warmer layers higher up and cooler layers farther down. This is in\ncontrast to the troposphere near the Earth's surface, which is cooler higher up\nand warmer farther down. The border of the troposphere and stratosphere, the\ntropopause, is marked by where this inversion begins, which in terms of\natmospheric thermodynamics is the equilibrium level. At moderate latitudes the\nstratosphere is situated between about and altitude above the surface, while at\nthe poles it starts at about altitude, and near the equator it may start at\naltitudes as high as .\n","title":"stratosphere","headings":["Ozone and temperature","Aircraft flight","Circulation and mixing","Life","See also","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["3: Troposphere","2: Mesosphere","2: Atmospheric_stratification","2: Ozone","2: Turbulence","1: Earth's_atmosphere","1: Tropopause","1: Atmospheric_thermodynamics","1: Equilibrium_level","1: Altitude","1: Geographical_pole","1: Equator","1: Temperature_inversion","1: Kelvin","1: °C","1: °F","1: Sun","1: Dynamically_stable","1: Convection","1: Stratopause","1: Methane","1: Chlorofluorocarbons","1: Airliner","1: Parasitic_drag","1: Concorde","1: SR-71","1: Jet_stream","1: Thunderstorm","1: Convective_overshoot","1: Glider_aircraft","1: Thermal","1: Lee_waves","1: FAI_Gliding_Commission#Gliding_records","1: Felix_Baumgartner","1: Dynamical","1: Quasi-biennial_oscillation","1: Gravity_wave","1: Secondary_circulation","1: Water_vapor","1: Sudden_stratospheric_warmings","1: Rossby_wave","1: Bacteria","1: Biosphere","1: Rüppell's_Vulture","1: Ivory_Coast","1: Bar-headed_Goose","1: Mount_Everest","1: Le_Grand_Saut","1: Léon_Teisserenc_de_Bort","1: Richard_Assmann","1: Lockheed_U-2","1: Paris_Gun","1: Red_Bull_Stratos","1: RQ-4_Global_Hawk","1: Service_ceiling"]}
