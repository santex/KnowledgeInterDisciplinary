Similar in\nstructure to a large lymph node, the spleen acts primarily as a blood filter. As\nsuch, it is a non-vital organ, with life possible after removal. The spleen\nplays important roles in regard to red blood cells (also referred to as\nerythrocytes) and the immune system. [http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/S/spleen.html Spleen], Internet\nEncyclopedia of Science In humans, it is located in the left upper\nquadrant of the abdomen. It removes old red blood cells and holds a reserve of\nblood in case of hemorrhagic shock while also recycling iron. As a part of the\nmononuclear phagocyte system, it metabolizes hemoglobin removed from senescent\nerythrocytes. The globin portion of hemoglobin is degraded to its constitutive\namino acids, and the heme portion is metabolized to bilirubin, which is\nsubsequently shuttled to the liver for removal. Mebius RE,\nKraal G. (2005). Structure and function of the spleen. Nat Rev Immunol.\n5(8):606â16. PMID 16056254 It synthesizes antibodies in its white pulp and\nremoves antibody-coated bacteria along with antibody-coated blood cells by way\nof blood and lymph node circulation. The spleen is brownish in color. A study published in 2009 using mice showed it has\nbeen found to contain in its reserve half of the body's monocytes within the red\npulp.
