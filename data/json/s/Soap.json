Accessed 2010-08-09 Soaps are mainly\nused as surfactants for washing, bathing, and cleaning, but they are also used\nin textile spinning and are important components of lubricants. Soaps for\ncleansing are obtained by treating vegetable or animal oils and fats with a\nstrongly alkaline solution. Fats and oils are composed of triglycerides; three\nmolecules of fatty acids are attached to a single molecule of glycerol. Cavitch, Susan Miller. The Natural Soap Book.\nStorey Publishing, 1994 ISBN 0-88266-888-9. The alkaline solution, which\nis often called lye (although the term \"lye soap\" refers almost exclusively to\nsoaps made with sodium hydroxide), brings about a chemical reaction known as\nsaponification. In saponification, the fats are first hydrolyzed into free fatty\nacids, which then combine with the alkali to form crude soap. Glycerol\n(glycerine) is liberated and is either left in or washed out and recovered as a\nuseful byproduct, depending on the process employed.\n\nSoaps are key components of most lubricating greases, which are usually\nemulsions of calcium soap or lithium soaps and mineral oil. These calcium- and\nlithium-based greases are widely used. Many other metallic soaps are also\nuseful, including those of aluminium, sodium, and mixtures of them. Such soaps\nare also used as thickeners to increase the viscosity of oils. In ancient times,\nlubricating greases were made by the addition of lime to olive oil.
