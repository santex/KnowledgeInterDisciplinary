The technique relies on\nthe removal of dsDNA formed by hybridization between a control and test sample,\nthus eliminating cDNAs or gDNAs of similar abundance, and retaining\ndifferentially expressed, or variable in sequence, transcripts or genomic\nsequences.\n\nSuppression subtractive hybridization has also been successfully used to\nidentify strain- or species-specific DNA sequences in a variety of bacteria\nincluding Vibrio species.\n","linknr":107,"url":"Suppression_subtractive_hybridization","recorded":1362903052,"links":15,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Biotechnology"],"headings":["See also","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/AlphaHelixSection.svg/40px-AlphaHelixSection.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Polymerase_chain_reaction","Complementary_DNA","Transcriptome","GDNA","Representational_Difference_Analysis"]}
