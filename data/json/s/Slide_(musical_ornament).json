It instructs the performer to begin two or three scale steps below the marked\nnote and \"slide\" upwardâthat is, move stepwise diatonically between the initial\nand final notes. Neumann 1993, p. 352. Though less\nfrequently found, the slide can also be performed in a descending fashion.\n\nIn The Interpretation of Early Music, Robert Donington surveys many treatises to\nascertain the history of the slide. Writing in 1654, John\nPlayford noted that the slide can be used in ascending (he called it\n\"elevation\") or in descending (he called it \"double backfall\") forms. Christopher Simpson described the figure in his Division Violist:\n\"Sometimes a note is graced by sliding to it from the third below, called an\n'elevation', now something obsolete. Sometimes from the third above; which we\ncall a double-backfall. This sliding a third, up, or down, is always done upon\none string.\" Christopher Simpson, The Division Violist, or An Introduction\nto the Playing upon A Ground (London: William Godbid, 1659), p. 9. The example\nis taken from the second edition, 1665. Thomas Mace (1676) notes that the\n+ sign above a note indicates its use.\n\nHenry Purcell (1696), Jacques Champion de ChambonniÃ¨res (1670) and Jean-Henri\nd'Anglebert (1689) use the French word coulÃ©. D'Anglebert in particular shows\nhow the slide can fill in the intervals of a major third and a perfect fourth.\nJean Rousseau (1687) called the figure a plainte. John Spitzer, \"Grammar of\nImprovised Ornamentation: Jean Rousseau's Viol Treatise of 1687,\" Journal of\nMusic Theory 33, No. 2 (Autumn, 1989), p. 301. (1665)]] PiÃ¨ces de\nClavessin (1659)]]\n\nWhereas the majority of treatises indicate the slide is to begin on the beat,\nDonington notes that Johann Gottfried Walther (1708) believed the slide should\noccur prior to the beat. Frederick Neumann (in 1973) indicates\nthat any of the 3 notes of a 3-note slide could occur on the beat, but did not\ncite any sources to support this. Neumann 1973, p. 204. By 1993, he\nstated that that the slide could occur only before or on the beat (i.e. the last\nnote of the slide on the beat, or the first note of the slide on the beat).\n\nCarl Philipp Emanuel Bach, in his Versuch Ã¼ber die wahre Art das Clavier zu\nspielen (1753), described the slide in two ways: 1) a two-note ascending prefix\nto a note; and 2) a three-note prefix similar to a turn. Carl\nPhilipp Emanuel Bach, Essay on the True Art of Playing Keyboard Instruments,\ntrans and ed. by William J. Mitchell (New York: W.W. Norton & Co., 1949), pp.\n136â39. Although he suggested a symbol for the slide (of a side-ways turn\nsymbol), this suggestion was not generally adopted, and usually the ornament is\nwritten out. Bach felt that the use of the slide was determined\nby the character of the music, favoring \"highly expressive movements.\" Regarding the three-note slide, he described it as being appropriate\nto works which describe \"sadness in languide, adagio movements. Halting and\nsubdued in nature, its performance should be highly expressive, and freed from\nslavish dependence on note values.\" He also noted that the\nornament is more effective when it some of its notes are dissonant against the\nbass below it.\n\nBach concludes his discussion of the slide by noting two important points: #the\nperformer should aim for an unaffected and subdued expression, rather than\ntrying to fill out notes; #the lack of multiple notes should not be seen has\nhaving more expressiveness.\n\nBach also suggested the slide could have a dotted rhythm, enhancing its\nexpressiveness. As quoted by Donington, Johann Joachim Quantz\n(1752) indicated that undotted slides belong to the French style, whereas dotted\nslides are appropriate to Italian style.\n\nThough Leopold Mozart did not use the term Schleifer in his GrÃ¼ndliche\nViolinschule (1756), his description and musical examples indicated that the\nslide could be used as an elaboration of and ascending or descending\nappoggiaturas: \"It is frequently the custom to make the ascending appoggiatura\nfrom the third below, even if it should appear to flow from the neighbouring\nnote. But in such cases one makes it mostly with two notes. Mozart, p.\n173. ... To the passing appoggiature belong also those improvised\nornamentations which I will call and [rising and falling intermediate\ngracenotes]. They occur between the appoggiatura and the principal note,\ndescending quite smoothly from the appoggiatura to the principal\nnote.\" Mozart, p. 179.\n\nIn his Clavierschule (1789, revised 1802), Johann Gottlob TÃ¼rk understood two\nkinds of characters appropriate to slides: 1) those that are short, without\ndotted rhythm, and 2) those that are long and with dotted rhythm. TÃ¼rk, p. 239. The short slide, he said, consisted of two notes\nand is to be used to \"increase the liveliness of a composition\" and therefore\nneeds to be played fast. It is often used when the melodic\nline ascends a fourth, although it could be also be appended to notes moving in\nstepwise ascending motion. TÃ¼rk indicated a preference for slides on the strong\nbeat, citing the examples of C.P.E. Bach, but quotes Agricola (in Tosi's\nAnleitung zur Singkunst, p. 88) that a slide could fill out a melodic gap\nwhose final note occurs on a weak beat. TÃ¼rk, p. 240.\n\nIn discussing three-note slides, TÃ¼rk states that the character of the slide is\nwholly dependent on the mood of the music: a lively work will suggest a fast\nslide, and a \"sorrowful\" work will be the appropriate place for a slower\ndecoration. TÃ¼rk, p. 241. He states that the three-note\nslide is used primarily on the strong beat. He explains that the dotted slide is\nused only in music with an \"agreeable or tender character.\" He\nrecommends playing the first note of the slide with emphasis and the following\nnotes \"softly and caressingly.\" As the first note of the slide is akin to an\nappogiatura (whose length always varies according to circumstances), so too\nshould the slide be seen whose duration is variable and dependent on\ncontext. TÃ¼rk, p. 242. He also warned against novice\nkeyboard players who insert too many slides into their playing. After a discussion on the contextual mutability of slides, TÃ¼rk concludes the\nsection on slides with the wish that composers would notate slides in regular\nrhythms so as to remove doubt as to their correct execution.\n","linknr":173,"url":"Slide_(musical_ornament)","recorded":1374861647,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Slide_(musical_ornament)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Slide_(musical_ornament)&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Medieval_dance#Germany","/wiki/File:Schleifer.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7d/Schleifer.jpg","/wiki/File:Schleifer.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","#cite_note-don-1","/wiki/Ornament_(music)","/wiki/Baroque","#cite_note-don-1","#cite_note-N352-2","#cite_note-N352-2","/wiki/Robert_Donington","#cite_note-don-1","/wiki/John_Playford","#cite_note-don-1","/wiki/Christopher_Simpson","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Thomas_Mace","/wiki/Henry_Purcell","/wiki/Jacques_Champion_de_Chambonni%C3%A8res","/wiki/Jean-Henri_d%27Anglebert","/wiki/Major_third","/wiki/Perfect_fourth","/wiki/Jean_Rousseau_(violist)","#cite_note-4","/wiki/File:Chelys_or_Division_Violist_by_Christopher_Simpson.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/69/Chelys_or_Division_Violist_by_Christopher_Simpson.jpg/220px-Chelys_or_Division_Violist_by_Christopher_Simpson.jpg","/wiki/File:Chelys_or_Division_Violist_by_Christopher_Simpson.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Christopher_Simpson","/wiki/File:D%27Anglebert_1659.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b4/D%27Anglebert_1659.jpg/220px-D%27Anglebert_1659.jpg","/wiki/File:D%27Anglebert_1659.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Jean-Henri_d%27Anglebert","/wiki/Johann_Gottfried_Walther","#cite_note-don-1","#cite_note-5","#cite_note-N352-2","/wiki/Carl_Philipp_Emanuel_Bach","/wiki/Turn_(music)","#cite_note-cpe-6","#cite_note-cpe-6","#cite_note-cpe-6","#cite_note-cpe-6","#cite_note-cpe-6","#cite_note-cpe-6","/wiki/Johann_Joachim_Quantz","#cite_note-don-1","/wiki/Leopold_Mozart","/wiki/Appoggiatura","#cite_note-7","#cite_note-8","#cite_note-turk1-9","#cite_note-turk1-9","#cite_note-turk2-10","#cite_note-turk3-11","#cite_note-turk3-11","#cite_note-turk4-12","#cite_note-turk2-10","#cite_note-turk4-12","/w/index.php?title=Slide_(musical_ornament)&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Bent_note","/wiki/Glissando","/w/index.php?title=Slide_(musical_ornament)&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-don_1-0","#cite_ref-don_1-1","#cite_ref-don_1-2","#cite_ref-don_1-3","#cite_ref-don_1-4","#cite_ref-don_1-5","#cite_ref-N352_2-0","#cite_ref-N352_2-1","#cite_ref-N352_2-2","#cite_ref-3","#cite_ref-4","#cite_ref-5","#cite_ref-cpe_6-0","#cite_ref-cpe_6-1","#cite_ref-cpe_6-2","#cite_ref-cpe_6-3","#cite_ref-cpe_6-4","#cite_ref-cpe_6-5","#cite_ref-7","#cite_ref-8","#cite_ref-turk1_9-0","#cite_ref-turk1_9-1","#cite_ref-turk2_10-0","#cite_ref-turk2_10-1","#cite_ref-turk3_11-0","#cite_ref-turk3_11-1","#cite_ref-turk4_12-0","#cite_ref-turk4_12-1","/w/index.php?title=Slide_(musical_ornament)&action=edit&section=3","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Slide_(musical_ornament)&oldid=545128636","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Ornamentation","/wiki/Category:Musical_notation","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Slide+%28musical+ornament%29&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Slide+%28musical+ornament%29","/wiki/Slide_(musical_ornament)","/wiki/Talk:Slide_(musical_ornament)","#","/wiki/Slide_(musical_ornament)","/w/index.php?title=Slide_(musical_ornament)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Slide_(musical_ornament)&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Slide_(musical_ornament)","/wi
