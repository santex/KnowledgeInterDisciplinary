{"cursor":"1511","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nA 'strong [[inflection]]' is a system of verb conjugation or noun/adjective\ndeclension which can be contrasted with an alternative system in the same\nlanguage, which is then known as a weak inflection. The term strong was coined\nwith reference to the Germanic verb, but has since been used of other phenomena\nin these and other languages, which may or may not be analogous. Note that there\nis nothing objectively \"strong\" about a strong form; the term is only meaningful\nin opposition to \"weak\" as a means of distinguishing paradigms within a single\nlanguage. Nor is there any distinguishing feature common to all strong forms,\nexcept that they are always counterpoints to \"weak\" ones.\n\nThe Germanic strong verb, occurring in Germanic languages including German and\nEnglish, is characterised by a vowel shift called ablaut. Examples in English\ninclude give/gave, come/came, fall/fell. There is nothing comparable in the\nGerman strong adjective inflections. For a full discussion of this distinction\nsee weak inflection.\n","linknr":85,"url":"Strong_inflection","recorded":1362583671,"links":12,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Verb types","Germanic languages"],"headings":["External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Verb_conjugation","Declension","Weak_inflection","Germanic_verb","Germanic_strong_verb","Indo-European_ablaut","Weak_inflection"]}
