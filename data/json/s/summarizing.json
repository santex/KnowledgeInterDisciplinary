The term itself is derived via Latin {{lang|la|paraphrasis}} from Greek ,\nmeaning \"additional manner of expression\". The act of paraphrasing is also\ncalled \"paraphrasis\".\n\nA paraphrase typically explains or clarifies the text that is being\nparaphrased. For example, \"The signal was red\" might be paraphrased as \"The\ntrain was not allowed to pass because the signal was red\". A paraphrase is\nusually introduced with a [[verbum dicendi]]&#8203;—&#8203;a declaratory\nexpression to signal the transition to the paraphrase. For example, in \"The\nsignal was red, that is, the train was not allowed to proceed,\" the that is\nsignals the paraphrase that follows.\n\nA paraphrase does not need to accompany a direct quotation, but when this is so,\nthe paraphrase typically serves to put the source's statement into perspective\nor to clarify the context in which it appeared. A paraphrase is typically more\ndetailed than a . One should add the source at the end of the sentence, for\nexample: When the light was red trains could not go (Wikipedia).\n\nParaphrase may attempt to preserve the essential meaning of the material being\nparaphrased. Thus, the (intentional or otherwise) reinterpretation of a source\nto infer a meaning that is not explicitly evident in the source itself qualifies\nas \"original research,\" and not as paraphrase.\n\nUnlike a ''meta''phrase, which represents a \"formal equivalent\" of the source, a\nparaphrase represents a \"dynamic equivalent\" thereof. While a metaphrase\nattempts to translate a text literally, a paraphrase conveys the essential\nthought expressed in a source text&#8203;—&#8203;if necessary, at the expense of\nliterality. For details, see dynamic and formal equivalence.\n\nThe term is applied to the genre of Biblical paraphrases, which were the most\nwidely circulated versions of the Bible available in medieval Europe.<ref\nname=\"jh\"></ref> Here, the purpose was not to render an exact rendition of the\nmeaning or the complete text, but to present material from the Bible in a\nversion that was theologically orthodox and not subject to heretical\ninterpretation, or, in most cases, to take from the Bible and present to a wide\npublic material that was interesting, entertaining and spiritually meaningful,\nor, simply to abridge the text.<ref name=\"jh\"/>\n\nThe phrase \"in your own words\" is often used within this context to imply that\nthe writer has rewritten the text in their own writing style - how they would\nhave written it if they had created the idea.<ref></ref>\n","title":"paraphrase","headings":["Notes"]},"micro-relation":["1: Latin","1: Ancient_Greek_language","1: Quotation","1: Original_research","1: Metaphrase","1: Literal_and_figurative_language","1: Dynamic_and_formal_equivalence","1: Biblical_paraphrase"]}
