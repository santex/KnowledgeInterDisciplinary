They\nwere responsible for initiating the punk movement in the United Kingdom and\ninspiring many later punk and alternative rock musicians. Although their initial\ncareer lasted just two-and-a-half years and produced only four singles and one\nstudio album, [[Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols]], they are\nregarded as one of the most influential acts in the history of popular\nmusic.\n\nThe Sex Pistols originally comprised vocalist Johnny Rotten, guitarist Steve\nJones, drummer Paul Cook and bassist Glen Matlock. Matlock was replaced by Sid\nVicious in early 1977. Under the management of impresario Malcolm McLaren, the\nband provoked controversies that took Britain by storm. Their concerts\nrepeatedly faced difficulties with organisers and local authorities, and public\nappearances often ended in mayhem. Their 1977 single \"God Save the Queen\",\nattacking social conformity and deference to the Crown, precipitated the \"last\nand greatest outbreak of pop-based moral pandemonium\".\n\nIn January 1978, at the end of a turbulent tour of the United States, Rotten\nleft the band and announced its break-up. Over the next several months, the\nthree other band members recorded songs for McLaren's film version of the Sex\nPistols' story, [[The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle]]. Vicious died of a heroin\noverdose in February 1979. In 1996, Rotten, Jones, Cook and Matlock reunited for\nthe Filthy Lucre Tour; since 2002, they have staged further reunion shows and\ntours. On 24 February 2006, the Sex Pistolsâthe four original members plus\nViciousâwere inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, but they refused to\nattend the ceremony, calling the museum \"a piss stain\".\n","linknr":1499,"url":"Sex_Pistols","recorded":1362566221,"links":101,"instances":["record_producer","pamela_rooke","band","the_who_song","band","band","comics","musician","band","band","band","band","british_author","subculture","sex_pistols_song","uk","band","eddie_cochran_song","musician","musician","band","band","dance","song","musician","band","sex_pistols_song","stereotype","record_producer","british_journalist","boutique","band","album","band"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Sex Pistols|","1975 establishments in England","Musical groups established in 1975","Musical groups disestablished in 1978","Musical groups reestablished in 2007","Musical groups from London","Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductees","Anti-fascists","English punk rock groups","Musical quartets","Virgin Records artists","Obscenity controversies","EMI Records artists","A&M Records artists","Warner Bros.
