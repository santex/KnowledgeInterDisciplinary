While seabirds vary greatly in lifestyle,\nbehaviour and physiology, they often exhibit striking convergent evolution, as\nthe same environmental problems and feeding niches have resulted in similar\nadaptations. The first seabirds evolved in the Cretaceous period, and modern\nseabird families emerged in the Paleogene.\n\nIn general, seabirds live longer, breed later and have fewer young than other\nbirds do, but they invest a great deal of time in their young. Most species\nnest in colonies, which can vary in size from a few dozen birds to millions.\nMany species are famous for undertaking long annual migrations, crossing the\nequator or circumnavigating the Earth in some cases. They feed both at the\nocean's surface and below it, and even feed on each other. Seabirds can be\nhighly pelagic, coastal, or in some cases spend a part of the year away from\nthe sea entirely.\n\nSeabirds and humans have a long history together: they have provided food to\nhunters, guided fishermen to fishing stocks and led sailors to land. Many\nspecies are currently threatened by human activities, and conservation efforts\nare under way.\n","linknr":1104,"url":"Seabird","recorded":1362511285,"links":82,"instances":["bird","luring_substance","topography","ecology","zoology","nutrition","eggs","ocean","biology","biology"],"pdf":["http://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/condor/v054n02/p0073-p0088.pdf","http://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/condor/v054n02/p0073-p0088.pdf","http://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/condor/v091n03/p0732-p0735.pdf","http://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/condor/v091n03/p0732-p0735.pdf","http://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/condor/v088n03/p0304-p0317.pdf","http://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/condor/v088n03/p0304-p0317.pdf","http://www.marineornithology.org/PDF/23_2/23_2_9.pdf","http://www.marineornithology.org/PDF/23_2/23_2_9.pdf","http://www.marineornithology.org/PDF/29_1/29_1_6.pdf","http://www.marineornithology.org/PDF/29_1/29_1_6.pdf","http://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/auk/v115n02/p0483-p0486.pdf","http://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/auk/v115n02/p0483-p0486.pdf","http://www.marineornithology.org/PDF/32_2/32_2_173-178.pdf","http://www.marineornithology.org/PDF/32_2/32_2_173-178.pdf","http://www.marineornithology.org/PDF/23_2/23_2_1.pdf","http://www.marineornithology.org/PDF/23_2/23_2_1.pdf","http://www.govdocs.aquake.org/cgi/reprint/2004/915/9150520.pdf","http://www.abdn.ac.uk/lighthouse/documents/Thompson_fulmars.pdf","http://www.birdlife.org/news/news/2006/01/birdlife_in_uummannaq.pdf","http://www.birdlife.org/news/news/2006/01/birdlife_in_uummannaq.pdf","http://marineornithology.org/PDF/31_2/31_2_185-192.pdf","http://marineornithology.org/PDF/31_2/31_2_185-192.pdf","http://www.marineornithology.org/PDF/31_2/31_2_175-180.pdf","http://www.marineornithology.org/PDF/31_2/31_2_175-180.pdf"],"categories":["Seabirds|"],"headings":["Classification
