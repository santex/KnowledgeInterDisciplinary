      "text" : "\n\n\n'Snuff' is a product made from a variety of ground or pulverised tobacco\nleaves.<ref name=\"OSHFT\">The Old Snuff House of Fribourg & Treyer at the Sign of\nthe Rasp & Crown, No.34 St. James's Haymarket, London, S.W., 1720, 1920. Author:\nGeorge Evens and Fribourg & Treyer. Publisher: Nabu Press, London, England.\nReproduced 5 August 2010, ISBN 978-1176904705</ref> It is an example of\nsmokeless tobacco. It originated in the Americas and was in common use in Europe\nby the 17th century.\n\nIt is insufflated (inhaled) or \"snuffed\" into the nasal cavity (into each\nnostril), delivering a swift 'hit' of nicotine and a lasting flavoured scent\n(especially if flavouring has been blended with the tobacco).<ref name=\"OSHFT\"\n/> Traditionally it is sniffed or inhaled lightly after a pinch of snuff is\nplaced onto the back surface of the hand or held pinched between thumb and index\nfinger, as well as using specially made \"snuffing\" devices. There is a general\nmisconception associated with \"the snuff sniff\". The nicotine in snuff is\nabsorbed through the mucus membrane, so a pinch of snuff only needs to get into\nthe nose. Most snuffers agree that if the snuff gets into the sinuses, one is\ninhaling too strongly.\n\nTraditional snuff production consists of a lengthy, multi-step process, in\ntobacco snuff mills.<ref name=\"OSHFT\" /> The selected tobacco leaves are first\nsubject to special tobacco curing or fermentation processes, where they will\nlater provide the individual characteristics and flavour for each type of snuff\nblend.<ref name=\"OSHFT\" /> Snuff is usually scented or flavoured, with many\nblends of snuff requiring months to years of special storage to reach the\nrequired maturity.<ref name=\"OSHFT\" /> Typical traditional flavours are\nvarieties of carefully blended tobacco leaves considered original \"fine snuff\"\nwithout any addition of scents or essences,<ref name=\"OSHFT\" /> varieties of\nspice, piquant, fruit, floral, and mentholated (also called \"medicated\") soon\nfollowed, either pure or in blends.<ref name=\"OSHFT\" /> Each snuff manufacturer\nusually has a variety of unique recipes and blends, as well as special recipes\nfor individual customers.<ref name=\"OSHFT\" /> Common flavours also include\ncoffee, chocolate, bordeaux, honey, vanilla, cherry, orange, apricot, plum,\ncamphor, cinnamon, rose and spearmint. Modern flavours include Bourbon, Cola\nand whisky. Traditional classic German snuff blends are the piquant Schmalzler\nand Brasil.\n\nSnuff comes in a range of texture and moistness, from very fine to coarse, and\nfrom toast (very dry) to very moist.<ref name=\"OSHFT\" /> Often drier snuffs are\nground finer. There are also a range of tobacco-free snuffs, such as Pöschl's\nWeiss (White), made from glucose powder or herbs. Whilst strictly speaking these\nare not snuffs because they contain no tobacco, they are an alternative for\nthose who wish to avoid nicotine, or for \"cutting\" a strong snuff to an\nacceptable strength.\n",
