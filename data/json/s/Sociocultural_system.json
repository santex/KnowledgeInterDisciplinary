If a\nsociocultural system functions in a way that constantly degrades the carrying\ncapacity of the ecosystem, that degradation will eventually lead to the collapse\nof the sociocultural system.

ISBN 0-14-303655-6\n\nThe term \"sociocultural system\" embraces three concepts: society, culture, and\nsystem. A society is a number of interdependent organisms of the same species. A\nculture is the learned behaviors that are shared by the members of a society,\ntogether with the material products of such behaviors. The words \"society\" and\n\"culture\" are fused together to form the word \"sociocultural\". A system is \"a\ncollection of parts which interact with each other to function as a\nwhole\".
