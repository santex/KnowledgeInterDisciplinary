The term can also describe a similar action of taking residence in\nan inanimate object, possibly giving it animation.\n\nThe concept of spiritual possession exists in many religions, including\nChristianity, Buddhism, Haitian Vodou, Wicca, and Southeast Asian and African\ntraditions. Mark 5:9, Luke 8:30 Depending on the cultural\ncontext in which it is found, possession may be considered voluntary or\ninvoluntary and may be considered to have beneficial or detrimental effects.\n\nSpirit possession is cross-culturally more common among women than men. 1981 Kehoe, Alice B., and Giletti, Dody H., Women's\nPreponderance in Possession Cults: The Calcium Deficiency Hypothesis Extended,\nAmerican Anthropologist New Series,. 83(3):549-561 Lewis, I.M. 1966 Spirit Possession and Deprivation Cults.
