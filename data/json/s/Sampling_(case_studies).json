The case study is common in social sciences\nand life sciences. Case studies may be descriptive or explanatory. The latter\ntype is used to explore causation in order to find underlying\nprinciples. {{cite book\n  | last = Shepard first = Jon authorlink = Jon M.

Thomas (2011) A typology for the case study in\nsocial science following a review of definition, discourse and structure.\nQualitative Inquiry, 17, 6, 511-521 offers the following definition of\ncase study: \"Case studies are analyses of persons, events, decisions, periods,\nprojects, policies, institutions, or other systems that are studied holistically\nby one or more methods. The case that is the subject of the inquiry will be an\ninstance of a class of phenomena that provides an analytical frame â an object â\nwithin which the study is conducted and which the case illuminates and\nexplicates.\"\n\nAnother suggestion is that 'case study' should be defined as a 'research\nstrategy', an empirical inquiry that investigates a phenomenon within its real-\nlife context. Case study research can mean single and multiple case studies, can\ninclude quantitative evidence, relies on multiple sources of evidence, and\nbenefits from the prior development of theoretical propositions. Case studies\nshould not be confused with qualitative research and they can be based on any\nmix of quantitative and qualitative evidence. Single-subject research provides\nthe statistical framework for making inferences from quantitative case-study\ndata. Siegfried Lamnek. Qualitative Sozialforschung.\nLehrbuch. 4. Auflage.
