{"cursor":"4042","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'serial dilution' is the stepwise of a substance in solution. Usually the\ndilution factor at each step is constant, resulting in a geometric progression\nof the concentration in a logarithmic fashion. A ten-fold serial dilution could\nbe 1 M, 0.1 M, 0.01 M, 0.001 M... Serial dilutions are used to accurately create\nhighly diluted solutions as well as solutions for experiments resulting in\nconcentration curves with a logarithmic scale. A tenfold dilution for each step\nis called a 'logarithmic dilution' or 'log-dilution', a 3.16-fold (10 0.5 -\nfold) dilution is called a 'half-logarithmic dilution' or 'half-log dilution',\nand a 1.78-fold (10 0.25 -fold) dilution is called a 'quarter-\nlogarithmic dilution' or 'quarter-log dilution'. Serial dilutions are widely\nused in experimental sciences, including biochemistry, pharmacology,\nmicrobiology, and physics.\n","linknr":131,"url":"Serial_dilution","recorded":1362374813,"links":13,"instances":["concentration","chemistry","equation"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Laboratory techniques","Homeopathy"],"headings":["In biology and medicine","In homeopathy","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf8/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf8/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["concentration","chemistry"],["molar","concentration"],["dilution","equation"]],"members":["molar","concentration","dilution"],"related":["Chemical_substance","Solution","Geometric_progression","Concentration_(chemistry)","Logarithm","Molar_(concentration)","Experiment","Concentration_curve","Logarithmic_scale","Biochemistry","Pharmacology","Microbiology","Physics","Biology","Medicine","Bacterial_colony","Agar","Axenic","Optical_tweezers","Micromanipulator","Homeopathy","Dilution_(equation)"]}
