SQL injection is a code injection technique that\nexploits a security vulnerability in an application's software. The\nvulnerability happens when user input is either incorrectly filtered for string\nliteral escape characters embedded in SQL statements or user input is not\nstrongly typed and unexpectedly executed. SQL injection is mostly known as an\nattack vector for websites but can be used to attack any type of SQL database.\n\nIn operational environments, it has been noted that applications experience an\naverage of 71 attempts an hour. http://blog.imperva.com/2011/09/sql-injection-by-the-\nnumbers.html\n","linknr":468,"url":"SQL_injection","recorded":1362891908,"links":41,"instances":["computing","computing","computing","database","computer_science","computer_security","computing","malware"],"pdf":["http://www.par-anoia.net/We_Are_Anonymous_Inside_the_Hacker_World_of_LulzSe.pdf","http://www.par-anoia.net/We_Are_Anonymous_Inside_the_Hacker_World_of_LulzSe.pdf","http://www.ihteam.net/papers/blind-sqli-regexp-attack.pdf"],"categories":["Data management","Injection exploits","SQL","Articles with example SQL code","Computer security exploits"],"headings":["Forms and validity","Technical implementation","Mitigation","Examples","In popular culture","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a3/KD_SQLIA_Classification_2010.png/220px-KD_SQLIA_Classification_2010.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg/32px-Portal-puzzle.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["attack","computing"],["vector","malware"],["string","computer_science"],["table","database"],["hacker","computer_security"],["scalar","computing"],["table","database"],["blacklist","computing"],["user","computing"],["set_operations","sql#union_operator"]],"members":["scalar","attack","blacklist","table","string","hacker","set_operations","user","vector"],"related":["Attack_(computing)","Code_injection","Security_vulnerability","String_literal","Escape_sequences","SQL","Strongly-typed_programming_language","Vector_(malware)","OWASP","Database_management_system","DDoS","DNS_hijacking","Cross-site_scripting","Storm_Worm","Escape_character","API","PHP","Strongly_typed","Data_type","String_(computer_science)","End-user","Query_string","URL","Identifier","Table_(database)","Hacker_(computer_security)","MySQL","Scalar_(computing)","Table_(database)","Object-relational_mapping","Blacklist_(computing)","PHP","MySQL","PostgreSQL","Taiwan","Russia","Government_of_Rhode_Island","Government_of_India","Tourism_in_India","Microsoft","Spokesperson","Microsoft_SQL_Server","Kaspersky_Lab","Malaysia","Turkey","Anti-U.S._Hackers_Infiltrate_Army_Servers","Sex_offender_registration","Oklahoma","Routine_maintenance","Social_Security_number","Sex_offender","Server_farm","China","Google_Search","Microsoft_SQL_Server","Internet_Information_Services","Microsoft_SQL_Server","Malware","JavaScript","United_States_Department_of_Justice","Albert_Gonzalez","Identity_theft","Payment_processor","Heartland_Payment_Systems","7-Eleven","Hannaford_Brothers","RockYou","Encryption","User_(computing)","BitTorrent","The_Pirate_Bay","IP_address","MD5","Cryptographic_hash_function","Japan","China","Osaka","Swedish_general_election,_2010","Write-in_candidate","Royal_Navy","HBGary","LulzSec","MySQL","Barracuda_Networks","Broadband_Reports","Hacktivist","LulzSec","Coupon","Sony","PBS","Massively_multiplayer_online_game","2012_Yahoo!_Voices_hack","Yahoo!","Plain_text","Subdomain","Yahoo!_Voices","Harvard","Princeton_University","Stanford","Cornell","Johns_Hopkins","University_of_Zurich","Pastebin","College_tuition_in_the_United_States","J.K._Rowling","The_Casual_Vacancy","Code_injection","Cross-site_scripting","Web_application_security","Metasploit_Project","OWASP","W3af"]}
