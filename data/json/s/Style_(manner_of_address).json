{"cursor":"58172","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nA 'style of office', or 'honorific', is a legal, official, or recognized\ntitle. A style, by tradition or law, precedes a reference\nto a person who holds a post or political office, and is sometimes used to refer\nto the office itself. An honorific can also be awarded to an individual in a\npersonal capacity. Such styles are particularly associated with monarchies,\nwhere they may be used by a wife of an office holder or of a prince of the\nblood, for the duration of their marriage. They are also almost universally used\nfor presidents in republics and in many countries for members of legislative\nbodies, higher-ranking judges and senior constitutional office holders. Leading\nreligious figures also have styles.\n","linknr":774,"url":"Style_(manner_of_address)","recorded":1362566036,"links":28,"instances":["united_states","style","australia","united_kingdom","name","commonwealth_countries","commonwealth","ecclesiastical","catholicism","canada","canada","canada","christianity"],"pdf":["http://govdocs.evergreen.edu/usgovt-forms-address.pdf","http://govdocs.evergreen.edu/usgovt-forms-address.pdf"],"categories":["Honorifics","Styles
