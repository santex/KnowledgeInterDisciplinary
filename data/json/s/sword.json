      "text" : "\n\n\n, 15th- or 16th-century]] A 'sword' is a bladed weapon (edged weapon) used\nprimarily for cutting or thrusting. The precise definition of the term varies\nwith the historical epoch or the geographical region under consideration. A\nsword in the most narrow sense consists of a straight blade with two edges and a\nhilt. However, in nearly every case, the term may also be used to refer to\nweapons with a single edge (backsword).\n\nThe word [[:wikt:sword|sword]] comes from the Old English\n[[wikt:sweord|sweord]], cognate to swert, Old Norse sver, from a Proto-Indo-\nEuropean root *swer- \"to wound, to cut\". Non-European weapons called \"sword\"\ninclude single-edged weapons such as the Middle Eastern saif, the Chinese dao\nand the related Japanese katana. The Chinese jian is an example of a non-\nEuropean double-edged sword, like the European models derived from the double-\nedged Iron Age sword.\n\nHistorically, the sword developed in the Bronze Age, evolving from the dagger;\nthe earliest specimens date to ca. 1600 BC. The Iron Age sword remained fairly\nshort and without a crossguard. The spatha as it developed in the Late Roman\narmy became the predecessor of the European sword of the Middle Ages, at first\nadopted as the Migration period sword, and only in the High Middle Ages\ndeveloped into the classical arming sword with crossguard.\n\nThe use of a sword is known as swordsmanship or (in an early modern or modern\ncontext) as . In the Early Modern period, the sword developed into the rapier\nand eventually the smallsword, surviving into the 18th century only in the role\nof duelling weapon. By the 19th century, swords were reduced to the status of\neither ceremonial weapon or sport equipment in modern fencing.\n\nThe sword is said to be the emblem of military honour and should incite the\nbearer to a just and generous pursuit of honor and virtue. It is symbolic of\nliberty and strength. In the Middle Ages, the sword was often used as a symbol\nof the word of God. The names given to many swords in mythology, literature, and\nhistory reflect the high prestige of the weapon and the wealth of the\nowner.<ref></ref>\n",
