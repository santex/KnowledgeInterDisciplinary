For example adult water scorpions have the caudal\nprocess which consists of a pair of half-tubes capable of being locked together\nto form a siphon by means of which air is conducted to the tracheae at the apex\nof the abdomen when the tip of the tube is thrust above the surface of the\nwater. In immature forms the siphon is undeveloped and breathing takes place\nthrough six pairs of abdominal sperms.
