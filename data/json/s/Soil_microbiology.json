{"cursor":"11451","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Soil microbiology' is the study of organisms in soil, their functions, and how\nthey affect soil properties. It is believed that between two and four billion\nyears ago, the first ancient bacteria and microorganisms came about in Earth's\nprimitive seas. These bacteria could fix nitrogen, in time multiplied and as a\nresult released oxygen into the atmosphere. This release of oxygen led to more\nadvanced microorganisms. Microorganisms in soil are important because they\naffect the structure and fertility of different soils. Soil microorganisms can\nbe classified as bacteria, actinomycetes, fungi, algae, and protozoa. Each of\nthese groups has different characteristics that define the organisms and\ndifferent functions in the soil it lives in. Rao,\nSubba. Soil Microbiology. Fourth ed.
