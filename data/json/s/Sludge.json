It can also refer to the settled\nsuspension obtained from conventional drinking water\ntreatment, [http://repository.unimelb.edu.au Drinking water treatment sludge\nproduction and dewaterability] and numerous other industrial processes.\nThe term is also sometimes used as a generic term for solids separated from\nsuspension in a liquid; this 'soupy' material usually contains significant\nquantities of 'interstitial' water (between the solid particles).\n\nWhen fresh sewage or wastewater is added to a settling tank, approximately 50%\nof the suspended solid matter will settle out in an hour and a half. This\ncollection of solids is known as raw sludge or primary solids and is said to be\n\"fresh\" before anaerobic processes become active. The sludge will become\nputrescent in a short time once anaerobic bacteria take over, and must be\nremoved from the sedimentation tank before this happens.\n\nThis is accomplished in one of two ways. In an Imhoff tank, fresh sludge is\npassed through a slot to the lower story or digestion chamber where it is\ndecomposed by anaerobic bacteria, resulting in liquefaction and reduced volume\nof the sludge. After digesting for an extended period, the result is called\n\"digested\" sludge and may be disposed of by drying and then landfilling. More\ncommonly with domestic  sewage, the fresh sludge\nis continuously extracted from the tank mechanically and passed to separate\nsludge digestion tanks that operate at higher temperatures than the lower story\nof the Imhoff tank and, as a result, digest much more rapidly and efficiently.\n\nExcess solids from biological processes such as activated sludge may still be\nreferred to as \"sludge\", but \"biosolids\" or \"compost\" are public relations terms\nsometimes used to refer to treated human waste.\nIndustrial wastewater solids are also referred to as sludge, whether generated\nfrom biological or physical-chemical processes. Surface water plants also\ngenerate sludge made up of solids removed from the raw water.\n","linknr":675,"url":"Sludge","recorded":1362509545,"links":74,"instances":["chemistry","element","chemistry","epidemiology"],"pdf":["http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2010-title40-vol29/pdf/CFR-2010-title40-vol29-sec503-9.pdf","http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2010-title40-vol29/pdf/CFR-2010-title40-vol29-sec503-9.pdf","http://fri.wisc.edu/docs/pdf/FRI_Brief_NonO157STEC_4_10.pdf","http://fri.wisc.edu/docs/pdf/FRI_Brief_NonO157STEC_4_10.pdf","http://etd.lib.clemson.edu/documents/1306874761/Miller_clemson_0050M_11217.pdf","http://etd.lib.clemson.edu/documents/1306874761/Miller_clemson_0050M_11217.pdf","http://www.bvsde.paho.org/bvsaar/cdlodos/pdf/latestdevelopments209.pdf","http://www.bvsde.paho.org/bvsaar/cdlodos/pdf/latestdevelopments209.pdf","http://water.epa.gov/scitech/wastetech/biosolids/upload/2002_06_28_mtb_biosolids_503rule_503g_ch6.pdf","http://www.epa.gov/osw/hazard/generation/sqg/handbook/k01005.pdf","http://www.epa.gov/osw/hazard/generation/sqg/handbook/k01005.pdf","http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/terror/RL32189.pdf","http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/terror/RL32189.pdf","http://www.rowenvironmental.com/uploads/Chemicals_of_Concern_in_Wastewater_Treatment_-_Rowe_-_USPE_ENV_Conf_-_March_2011.pdf","http://www.rowenvironmental.com/uploads/Chemicals_of_Concern_in_Wastewater_Treatment_-_Rowe_-_USPE_ENV_Conf_-_March_2011.pdf","http://faculty.washington.edu/clh/understandingbiosolids/Ch7organics.pdf","http://cals.arizona.edu/pubs/consumer/az1426.pdf","http://soilandwater.bee.cornell.edu/publications/McBrideJEQ00.pdf","http://soilandwater.bee.cornell.edu/publications/McBrideJEQ00.pdf","http://www.sourcewatch.org/images/2/22/McBride_-_Toxic_Metals_in_Sludge.pdf","http://www.epa.gov/waterscience/biosolids/tnsss-stat.pdf","http://www.epa.gov/waterscience/biosolids/tnsss-stat.pdf","http://www.internationalpbi.it/docs/Documenti/BioaerosolsandHealth-Douwes2003AnnoccupHygeine47187-200.pdf","http://www.internationalpbi.it/docs/Documenti/BioaerosolsandHealth-Douwes2003AnnoccupHygeine47187-200.pdf","http://www.epa.gov/nrmrl/pubs/625r92013/625R92013chap7.pdf","http://www.epa.gov/owmitnet/mtb/combioman.pdf","http://sludgenews.org/resources/documents/Harrison_NS.pdf","http://cwmi.css.cornell.edu/PDFS/LandApp.pdf","http://cwmi.css.cornell.edu/PDFS/LandApp.pdf","http://www.fcapeninsula.org/Resomation.for.newsletter.pdf","http://www.fcapeninsula.org/Resomation.for.newsletter.pdf","http://www.hallmanwingate.com/fullpanel/uploads/files/the-gatekeepers-official-copy--sept-28-2011.pdf","http://www.hallmanwingate.com/fullpanel/uploads/files/the-gatekeepers-official-copy--sept-28-2011.pdf","http://www.usludgefree.org/AlternativesChart.pdf","http://www.usludgefree.org/AlternativesChart.pdf","http://www.prwatch.org/files/tsigfy_chap8.pdf","http://www.prwatch.org/files/tsigfy_chap8.pdf","http://www.epa.gov/waterscience/biosolids/nas/complete.pdf","http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2002-149/pdfs/2002-149.pdf","http://www.loudounnats.org/pdf/Human_Health_Risk_Sludge_NC1.pdf","http://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/members/2003/6207/6207.pdf","http://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/members/2003/6207/6207.pdf","http://www.sludgefacts.org/IJOEH_1104_Snyder.pdf","http://www.sludgefacts.org/IJOEH_1104_Snyder.pdf"],"categories":["Sewerage"],"headings":["Pollutant","Dangers","Lawsuits","Background
