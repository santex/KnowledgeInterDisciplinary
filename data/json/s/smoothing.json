In\nsmoothing, the data points of a signal are modified so individual points\n(presumably because of noise) are reduced, and points that are lower than the\nadjacent points are increased leading to a smoother signal. Smoothing may be\nused in two important ways that can aid in data analysis (1) by being able to\nextract more information from the data as long as the assumption of smoothing is\nreasonable and (2) by being able to provide analyses that are both flexible and\nrobust.<ref>Simonoff, Jeffrey S. (1998) Smoothing Methods in Statistics, 2nd\nedition. Springer ISBN 978-0387947167 </ref> Many different algorithms are used\nin smoothing. Data smoothing is typically done through the simplest of all\ndensity estimators, the histogram.\n\nSmoothing may be distinguished from the related and partially overlapping\nconcept of curve fitting in the following ways:\n* curve fitting often involves the use of an explicit function form for the\n  result, whereas the immediate results from smoothing are the \"smoothed\" values\n  with no later use made of a functional form if there is one;\n* the aim of smoothing is to give a general idea of relatively slow changes of\n  value with little attention paid to the close matching of data values, while\n  curve fitting concentrates on achieving as close a match as possible.\n* smoothing methods often have an associated tuning parameter which is used to\n  control the extent of smoothing. However, the terminology used across\n  applications is mixed. For example, use of an interpolating spline fits a\n  smooth curve exactly through the given data points and is sometimes called\n  \"smoothing\".\n","title":"smoothing","headings":["Linear smoothers","Smoothing Algorithms","See also","References","Further reading"]},"micro-relation":["2: Image_processing","2: Curve_fitting","2: Scale_space","1: Statistics","1: Data_set","1: Pattern","1: Noise","1: Algorithm","1: Histogram","1: Linear_transformation","1: Hat_matrix","1: Statistical_survey","1: Computer_vision","1: Additive_smoothing","1: Butterworth_filter","1: Digital_filter","1: Kalman_filter","1: Kernel_smoother","1: Laplacian_smoothing","1: Stretched_grid_method","1: Low-pass_filter","1: Recursive_filter","1: Savitzky–Golay_smoothing_filter","1: Local_regression","1: Smoothing_spline","1: Ramer–Douglas–Peucker_algorithm","1: Moving_average","1: Exponential_smoothing","1: Kolmogorov–Zurbenko_filter","1: Convolution","1: Edge_preserving_smoothing","1: Graph_cuts_in_computer_vision","1: Numerical_smoothing_and_differentiation","1: Statistical_signal_processing","1: Window_function","1: Subdivision_surface"]}
