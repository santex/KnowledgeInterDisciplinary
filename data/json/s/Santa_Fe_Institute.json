The Institute is advised by a group of eminent\nscholars, including several Nobel Prize winning scientists. Although theoretical\nscientific research is the Institute's primary focus, it also runs several\npopular summer schools on complex systems, along with other educational and\noutreach programs aimed at students ranging from middle school up through\ngraduate school.\n\nThe Institute's annual funding comes from a combination of private donors, grant-\nmaking foundations, government science agencies, and companies affiliated with\nits business network. The 2011 budget was nearly $10 million.
