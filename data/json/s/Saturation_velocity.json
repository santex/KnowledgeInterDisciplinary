Fundamentals of Semiconductors: Physics and Materials\nProperties, Peter Y. Yu, Manuel Cardona, pp.227-228, Springer, New York 2005,\nISBN 3-540-25470-6 Charge carriers normally move at an average drift speed\nproportional to the electric field strength they experience temporally. The\nproportionality constant is known as mobility of the carrier, which is a\nmaterial property. A good conductor would have a high mobility value for its\ncharge carrier, which means higher velocity, and consequently higher current\nvalues for a given electric field strength. There is a limit though to this\nprocess and at some high field value, a charge carrier can not move any faster,\nhaving reached its saturation velocity, due to mechanisms that eventually limit\nthe movement of the carriers in the material. GaAs Devices and Circuits,\nMichael Shur, pp.310-324, Plenum Press, NY 1987, ISBN 0-306-42192-5\n\nSaturation velocity is a very important parameter in the design of semiconductor\ndevices, especially field effect transistors, which are basic building blocks of\nalmost all modern integrated circuits. Typical values of saturation velocity may\nvary greatly for different materials, for example for Si it is in the order of\n1Ã10 7 cm/s, for GaAs 1.2Ã10 7 cm/s, while for 6H-SiC, it is\nnear 2Ã10 7 cm/s. Typical electric field strengths at which\ncarrier velocity saturates is usually on the order of 10-100 kV/cm. Both\nsaturation field and the saturation velocity of a semiconductor material are\ntypically strong function of impurities, crystal defects and temperature.\n\nFor extremely small scale devices, where the high-field regions may be\ncomparable or smaller than the average mean free path of the charge carrier,\none can observe velocity overshoot, or hot electron effects which has become\nmore important as the transistor geometries continually decrease to enable\ndesign of faster, larger and more dense integrated circuits. High Field\nHole Velocity and Velocity Overshoot in Silicon Inversion Layers, D. Sinitsky,\nF. Assaderaghi, C. Hu, and J. Bokor, IEEE Electron Device Letters, Vol. 18, NO.\n2, Feb. 1997 The regime where the two terminals between which the\nelectron moves is much smaller than the mean free path, is sometimes referred\nas ballistic transport. There has been numerous attempts in the past to build\ntransistors based on this principle without much success. Nevertheless,\ndeveloping field of nanotechnology, and new materials such as Carbon nanotubes\nand graphene, offers new hope.\n\nThough in a semiconductor such as Si saturation velocity of a carrier is same as\nthe peak velocity of the carrier, for some other materials with more complex\nenergy band structures, this is not true. In GaAs or InP for example the carrier\ndrift velocity reaches to a maximum as a function of field and then it begins to\nactually decrease as the electric field applied is increased further. Carriers\nwhich have gained enough energy are kicked up to a different conduction band\nwhich presents a lower drift velocity and eventually a lower saturation velocity\nin these materials. This results in an overall decrease of current for higher\nvoltage until all electrons are in the \"slow\" band and this is the principle\nbehind operation of a Gunn diode, which can display negative differential\nresistivity. Due to the transfer of electrons to a different conduction band\ninvolved, such devices, usually single terminal, are referred to as Transferred\nelectron devices, or TEDs.\n","linknr":106,"url":"Saturation_velocity","recorded":1362480479,"links":10,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Transistors|Transistors","Charge carriers","Concepts in physics"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Semiconductor","Electron","Electric_field","Charge_carrier","Drift_speed","Field_strength","Electrical_mobility","Electrical_conductor","Field_effect_transistors","Integrated_circuits","Silicon","GaAs","SiC","Crystal_defect","Mean_free_path","Velocity_overshoot","Hot_electron","Ballistic_transport","Transistors","Nanotechnology","Carbon","Carbon_nanotube","Graphene","Energy_band","GaAs","InP","Conduction_band","Gunn_diode","Transferred_electron_device"]}
