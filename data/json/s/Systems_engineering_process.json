{"cursor":"40828","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":", requirements analysis and scheduling to manage complexity.]]\n\n'Systems engineering' is an interdisciplinary field of engineering that focuses\non how to design and manage complex engineering projects over their life cycles.\nIssues such as reliability, logistics, coordination of different teams\n(requirement management), evaluation measurements, and other disciplines become\nmore difficult when dealing with large, complex projects. Systems engineering\ndeals with work-processes, optimization methods, and risk management tools in\nsuch projects. It overlaps with technical and human-centered disciplines such as\ncontrol engineering, industrial engineering, organizational studies, and project\nmanagement. Systems Engineering ensures that all likely aspects of a project or\nsystem are considered, and integrated into a whole.\n","linknr":1000,"url":"Systems_engineering_process","recorded":1362665500,"links":89,"instances":["business","term"],"pdf":["http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.86.7496&rep=rep1&type=pdf","http://www.incose.org/ProductsPubs/DOC/SystemsApproach.pdf","http://www.incose.org/ProductsPubs/DOC/SystemsApproach.pdf","http://www.dau.mil/pubscats/PubsCats/SEFGuide%2001-01.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20070615160805/http://incose.org.uk/Downloads/AA01.1.4_Principles+&+practices+of+SE.pdf","http://incose.org.uk/Downloads/AA01.1.4_Principles%20&%20practices%20of%20SE.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20070615160805/http://incose.org.uk/Downloads/AA01.1.4_Principles+&+practices+of+SE.pdf","http://www.incose.org/secoe/0103/ValueSE-INCOSE04.pdf","http://www.incose.org/secoe/0103/ValueSE-INCOSE04.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20070615160805/http://www.splc.net/programs/acquisition-support/presentations/surveying.pdf","http://www.splc.net/programs/acquisition-support/presentations/surveying.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20070615160805/http://www.splc.net/programs/acquisition-support/presentations/surveying.pdf","http://www.research.ibm.com/journal/sj/011/ibmsj0101D.pdf","http://www.research.ibm.com/journal/sj/011/ibmsj0101D.pdf","http://www.gaudisite.nl/DidacticRecommendationsSESlides.pdf","http://www.gaudisite.nl/DidacticRecommendationsSESlides.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20070615160805/http://sistemas.unmsm.edu.pe/occa/material/INCOSE-ABET-SE-SF-21Mar06.pdf","http://sistemas.unmsm.edu.pe/occa/material/INCOSE-ABET-SE-SF-21Mar06.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20070615160805/http://sistemas.unmsm.edu.pe/occa/material/INCOSE-ABET-SE-SF-21Mar06.pdf","http://www.marc.gatech.edu/events/pde2005/presentations/0.2-jenkins.pdf","http://www.marc.gatech.edu/events/pde2005/presentations/0.2-jenkins.pdf","http://education.ksc.nasa.gov/esmdspacegrant/Documents/NASA%20SP-2007-6105%20Rev%201%20Final%2031Dec2007.pdf","http://human.space.edu/old/docs/Systems_Eng_Handbook.pdf","http://www.vitechcorp.com/whitepapers/files/200701031634430.CommonGraphicalRepresentations_2002.pdf","http://www.vitechcorp.com/whitepapers/files/200701031634430.CommonGraphicalRepresentations_2002.pdf","http://www.sysml.org/docs/specs/OMGSysML-FAS-06-05-04.pdf","http://www.sysml.org/docs/specs/OMGSysML-FAS-06-05-04.pdf","http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19960002194_1996102194.pdf","http://education.ksc.nasa.gov/esmdspacegrant/Documents/NASA%20SP-2007-6105%20Rev%201%20Final%2031Dec2007.pdf"],"categories":["Systems
