Such a mixture is considered a solution rather than a compound when the\ncrystal structure of the solvent remains unchanged by addition of the solutes,\nand when the mixture remains in a single homogeneous phase. This often happens\nwhen the two elements (generally metals) involved are close together on the\nperiodic table; conversely, a chemical compound is generally a result of the non-\nproximity of the two metals involved on the periodic table.<ref></ref>\n",
