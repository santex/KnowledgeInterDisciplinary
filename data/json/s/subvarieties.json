Classically, an algebraic variety was defined to be the set of\n solutions of a system of polynomial equations, over the real or complex\n numbers. Modern definitions of an algebraic variety generalize this notion in\n several different ways, while attempting to preserve the geometric intuition\n behind the original definition.\n\nConventions regarding the definition of an algebraic variety differ slightly.\nFor example, some authors require that an \"algebraic variety\" is, by definition,\nirreducible (which means that it is not the union of two smaller sets that are\nclosed in the Zariski topology), while others do not. When the former convention\nis used, non-irreducible algebraic varieties are called 'algebraic sets'.\n\nThe notion of variety is similar to that of manifold, the difference being that\na variety may have singular points, while a manifold may not. In many languages,\nboth varieties and manifolds are named by the same word.<!-- Sorry for ambiguous\nword \"many\"; The languages that distinguish variety and manifold include:\nGerman, English, Iranian, Finn, Swedish and Chinese. The languages that use the\nsame word include: Bulgarian, Catalan, Czech, Spanish, French, Korean, Italian,\nHebrew, Dutch, Japanese, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Slovenian, Ukranian, and\nVietnamese. (This list is original research.)\n\nI'm not sure if it's worth recording for English wikipedia. -->\n\nProven around the year 1800, the fundamental theorem of algebra establishes a\nlink between algebra and geometry by showing that a monic polynomial in one\nvariable with complex coefficients (an algebraic object) is determined by the\nset of its roots (a geometric object). Generalizing this result, Hilbert's\nNullstellensatz provides a fundamental correspondence between ideals of\npolynomial rings and algebraic sets. Using the Nullstellensatz and related\nresults, mathematicians have established a strong correspondence between\nquestions on algebraic sets and questions of ring theory. This correspondence is\nthe specifity of algebraic geometry among the other subareas of geometry.\n","title":"Algebraic%20variety","headings":["Introduction and definitions","Examples","Basic results","Isomorphism of algebraic varieties","Discussion and generalizations","Algebraic manifolds","See also","Footnotes","References"]},"micro-relation":["4: Zariski_topology","4: Algebraically_closed_field","3: Algebraic_geometry","3: Singular_point_of_an_algebraic_variety","3: Integral_domain","3: Springer_Science+Business_Media","2: Real_number","2: Manifold","2: Geometry","2: Affine_space","2: Projective_space","2: Regular_function","2: Alexander_Grothendieck","2: Complete_variety","2: Gröbner_basis","2: Dimension_of_an_algebraic_variety","2: Prime_ideal","1: Mathematics","1: Solution_set","1: System_of_polynomial_equations","1: Complex_number","1: Fundamental_theorem_of_algebra","1: Algebra","1: Monic_polynomial","1: Complex_numbers","1: Root_of_a_function","1: Hilbert's_Nullstellensatz","1: Polynomial_ring","1: Ring_theory","1: Subset","1: Natural_topology","1: Closed_set","1: Quotient_ring","1: Algebraic_geometry_of_projective_spaces","1: Homogeneous_polynomial","1: Homogeneous_coordinates","1: Quasiprojective_variety","1: Subvariety","1: Quasi-projective_variety","1: Segre_embedding","1: Veronese_embedding","1: André_Weil","1: Claude_Chevalley","1: Glossary_of_scheme_theory#integral","1: Glossary_of_scheme_theory#Separated_and_proper_morphisms","1: Glossary_of_scheme_theory#Finite,_quasi-finite,_and_finite_type_morphisms","1: Masayoshi_Nagata","1: Algebraic_surface","1: Algebraic_variety#Affine_varieties","1: Absolutely_irreducible","1: Unit_circle","1: Hypersurface","1: Vector_space","1: Twisted_cubic","1: Injective_function","1: Monomial_order","1: Polynomial_factorization","1: If_and_only_if","1: Transcendence_degree","1: Field_of_fractions","1: Graph_isomorphism","1: Identity_function","1: Locally_ringed_space","1: Spectrum_of_a_ring","1: Structure_sheaf","1: Polynomial_algebra","1: Nilradical_of_a_ring","1: Algebraic_curve","1: Jean-Pierre_Serre","1: Sheaf_cohomology","1: Nilpotent","1: Category_theory","1: Fiber_product","1: Algebraic_space","1: Algebraic_stack","1: Smooth_function","1: Nash_manifold","1: Projective_algebraic_manifold","1: Riemann_sphere","1: Function_field_of_an_algebraic_variety","1: Birational_geometry","1: Abelian_variety","1: Analytic_variety","1: Zariski–Riemann_space","1: Semi-algebraic_set"]}
