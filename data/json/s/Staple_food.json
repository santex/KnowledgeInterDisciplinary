{"cursor":"11278","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"s]] es]]\n\nA 'staple [[food]]', sometimes simply referred to as a 'staple', is a food that\nis eaten routinely and in such quantities that it constitutes a dominant portion\nof a standard diet in a given population, supplying a large fraction of the\nneeds for energy-rich materials and generally a significant proportion of the\nintake of other nutrients as well. Most people live on a diet based on just a\nsmall number of staples.\n\nStaple foods vary from place to place, but typically they are inexpensive or\nreadily available foods that supply one or more of the three organic\nmacronutrients needed for survival and health: carbohydrates, proteins, and\nfats. Typical examples of staples include tuber- or root-crops, grains, legumes,\nand other seeds. The staple food of a specific society may be eaten as often as\nevery day, or every meal. Early civilizations valued the foods that they\nestablished as staples because, in addition to providing necessary nutrition,\nthey generally are suitable for storage over long periods of time without decay.\nSuch storable foods are the only possible staples during seasons of shortage,\nsuch as dry seasons or cold-temperate winters, against which times harvests have\nbeen stored; during seasons of plenty wider choices of foods may be available.\n\nMost staple foods are derived either from cereals such as wheat, barley, rye,\nmaize, or rice, or starchy tubers or root vegetables such as potatoes, yams,\ntaro, and cassava.
