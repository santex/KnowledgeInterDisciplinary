{"cursor":"5370","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The '[[Speaker (politics)|Speaker]] of the [[Legislative Assembly of New\nBrunswick]]' is the presiding officer of the provincial legislature. Since\n1994 the position has been elected by MLAs using a secret ballot. Previously,\nthe Speaker had been appointed by motion of the house, in practice moved by\nthe Premier of New Brunswick usually after consultation with the Leader of\nthe Opposition. Shirley Dysart was the first Speaker to be elected by his or\nher peers.\n\nThe Speaker is usually a member of the governing party. The only recent\nexceptions have been Robert McCready and Michael Malley. McCready was appointed\nby motion of Premier Richard Hatfield following the close election of 1978.\nHatfield's Progressive Conservative Party had won only 30 seats compared to the\n28 seats won by the opposition Liberal Party. McCready was a member of the\nLiberal caucus and was appointed over the objection of the Liberal Party. The\nLiberal opposition argued on a point of order before the clerk of the assembly\nthat precedent required that the opposition support the motion appointing\nspeaker, but the clerk allowed the motion to be put and carried by the\ngovernment. Malley was elected in 2006 while sitting as an independent. Malley\nhad left the government caucus following a cabinet shuffle that had seen the\nincumbent speaker, Bev Harrison, join the cabinet leaving the post vacant.\nMalley argued that he should have been included in the cabinet for regional\nreasons and left the government caucus in protest; to prevent losing control of\nthe legislature in a tenuous minority government situation, the Progressive\nConservative caucus supported Malley as speaker. Malley later changed his party\naffiliation, amid some controversy, back to that of the governing Progressive\nConservatives while occupying the speakership.\n\n\n","linknr":179,"url":"Speaker_of_the_Legislative_Assembly_of_New_Brunswick","recorded":1375081144,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Speaker_of_the_Legislative_Assembly_of_New_Brunswick&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Speaker_of_the_Legislative_Assembly_of_New_Brunswick&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Speaker_(politics)","/wiki/Legislative_Assembly_of_New_Brunswick","/wiki/Member_of_the_Legislative_Assembly","/wiki/Premier_of_New_Brunswick","/wiki/Leader_of_the_Opposition","/wiki/Shirley_Dysart","/wiki/Robert_McCready","/wiki/Michael_Malley","/wiki/Richard_Hatfield","/wiki/New_Brunswick_general_election,_1978","/wiki/Progressive_Conservative_Party_of_New_Brunswick","/wiki/Parliamentary_opposition","/wiki/New_Brunswick_Liberal_Association","/wiki/Caucus","/wiki/Point_of_order","/wiki/Clerk_(position)","/wiki/Independent_(politician)","/wiki/Cabinet_shuffle","/wiki/Bev_Harrison","/wiki/Executive_Council_of_New_Brunswick","/wiki/Minority_government","/w/index.php?title=Speaker_of_the_Legislative_Assembly_of_New_Brunswick&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Dale_Graham","/wiki/Roy_Boudreau","/wiki/Eugene_McGinley","/wiki/Michael_Malley","/wiki/Bev_Harrison","/wiki/John_McKay_(New_Brunswick_politician)","/wiki/Danny_Gay_(politician)","/wiki/Shirley_Dysart","/wiki/Gerald_Clavette","/wiki/Shirley_Dysart","/wiki/Frank_Branch","/wiki/Charles_Gallagher","/wiki/James_Tucker_(New_Brunswick_politician)","/wiki/Bill_Woodroffe","/wiki/Lawrence_Garvie","/wiki/Robert_McCready","/wiki/H._H._Williamson","/wiki/Bernard_A._Jean","/wiki/Ernest_Richard","/wiki/J._Arthur_Moore","/wiki/Walter_Powers_(politician)","/wiki/E.T._Kennedy","/wiki/Harry_O._Downey","/wiki/Frederic_McGrand","/wiki/Hedley_Francis_Gregory_Bridges","/wiki/Frederick_C._Squires","/wiki/Joseph_Leonard_O%27Brien","/wiki/Allison_Dysart","/wiki/Judson_Hetherington","/wiki/William_Currie_(Canadian_politician)","/wiki/Olivier-Maximin_Melanson","/w/index.php?title=Walter_B._Dickson&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/George_Johnson_Clarke","/wiki/Donald_Morrison_(politician)","/wiki/Charles_J._Osman","/wiki/Clifford_William_Robinson","/wiki/John_Percival_Burchill","/wiki/Albert_Scott_White","/wiki/William_Pugsley","/wiki/James_E._Lynott","/wiki/Benjamin_Robert_Stephenson","/wiki/William_Wedderburn_(Canadian_politician)","/wiki/Bliss_Botsford","/wiki/John_Hamilton_Gray_(New_Brunswick_politician)","/wiki/Edwin_Arnold_Vail","/wiki/John_Campbell_Allen","/wiki/John_Mercer_Johnson","/w/index.php?title=James_A._Harding_(politician)&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Daniel_Hanington","/wiki/John_Wesley_Weldon","/wiki/William_Crane_(politician)","/wiki/Charles_Simonds","/wiki/Richard_Simonds","/wiki/Harry_Peters","/wiki/Ward_Chipman,_Jr.","/wiki/William_Botsford","/wiki/John_Robinson_(Businessman)","/wiki/Amos_Botsford","/w/index.php?title=Speaker_of_the_Legislative_Assembly_of_New_Brunswick&action=edit&section=2","http://www2.parl.gc.ca/Sites/LOP/Infoparl/english/issue.asp?param=67&art=97","/wiki/Template:Canada_topic","/wiki/Template_talk:Canada_topic","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Canada_topic&action=edit","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/Maple_Leaf_%28from_roundel%29.svg/18px-Maple_Leaf_%28from_roundel%29.svg.png","/wiki/Speaker_of_the_Legislative_Assembly","/wiki/Provinces_and_territories_of_Canada","/wiki/Speaker_of_the_Legislative_Assembly_of_Alberta","/wiki/Speaker_of_the_Legislative_Assembly_of_British_Columbia","/wiki/Speaker_of_the_Legislative_Assembly_of_Manitoba","/wiki/Speaker_of_the_Legislative_Assembly_of_Newfoundland_and_Labrador","/wiki/Speaker_of_the_Legislative_Assembly_of_Nova_Scotia","/wiki/Speaker_of_the_Legislative_Assembly_of_Ontario","/wiki/Speaker_of_the_Legislative_Assembly_of_Prince_Edward_Island","/wiki/Speaker_of_the_Legislative_Assembly_of_Quebec","/wiki/Speaker_of_the_Legislative_Assembly_of_Saskatchewan","/wiki/Speaker_of_the_Legislative_Assembly_of_the_Northwest_Territories","/wiki/Speaker_of_the_Legislative_Assembly_of_Nunavut","/wiki/Speaker_of_the_Legislative_Assembly_of_Yukon","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Symbol_book_class2.svg/16px-Symbol_book_class2.svg.png","/wiki/Book:Canada","//upload.wikimedia.org/
