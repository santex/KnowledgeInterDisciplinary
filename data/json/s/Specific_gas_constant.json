It is equivalent to the Boltzmann constant, but expressed\nin units of energy (i.e. the pressure-volume product) per temperature increment\nper [[mole (unit)|mole]] (rather than energy per temperature increment per\nparticle). The constant is also a combination of the constants from Boyle's Law,\nCharles's Law, Avogadro's Law, and Gay-Lussac's Law.\n\nPhysically, the gas constant is the constant of proportionality that happens to\nrelate the energy scale in physics to the temperature scale, when a mole of\nparticles at the stated temperature is being considered. Thus, the value of the\ngas constant ultimately derives from historical decisions and accidents in the\nsetting of the energy and temperature scales, plus similar historical setting of\nthe value of the molar scale used for the counting of particles. The last factor\nis not a consideration in the value of the Boltzmann constant, which does a\nsimilar job of equating linear energy and temperature scales.\n\nThe gas constant value is\n: R=8.314\\,4621(75)~\\frac{\\mathrm{J}}{\\mathrm{mol~K}}\nThe two digits in parentheses are the uncertainty (standard deviation) in the\nlast two digits of the value. The relative uncertainty is 9.1. Some have\nsuggested that it might be appropriate to name the symbol R the 'Regnault\nconstant' in honor of the French chemist Henri Victor Regnault, whose accurate\nexperimental data was used to calculate the early value of the constant;\nhowever, the exact reason for the original representation of the constant by the\nletter R is elusive. {{cite journal |url=\nhttp://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ed080p731 |title=The Universal Gas Constant\nR |last=Jensen |first=William B. |journal= J.
