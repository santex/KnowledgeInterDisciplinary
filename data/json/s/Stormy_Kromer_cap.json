The hat is popular in the Midwest region of the\nUnited States and with hunters and outdoorsmen. It is named for George \"Stormy\" Kromer, a semi-professional\nbaseball player who later worked as a railroad engineer. Kromer lost many hats\nto the wind while working on trains, and in 1903 he asked his wife Ida to make\nhim a warm hat that would stay on more securely. She modified a baseball cap\ninto what became the Stormy Kromer cap.\n\n]] Due to popularity with other employees of the railroad, the Kromers formed\nthe Kromer Cap Company in 1903 to produce the caps. In 1919, due to ever increasing demand, the Kromers opened\na factory in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. George Kromer\nsold the company in 1965 to Richard Grossman. In 2001, the Kromer Cap Company\nplanned to cease production of Stormy Kromer caps. The rights to the caps were purchased by Bob Jacquart, owner\nof Jacquart Fabric Products, and production moved to Ironwood, Michigan. Stormy Kromer Mercantile was formed, increasing production\nto over 50,000 caps annually from the previous 3000-6000 caps.\n\nPresident Barack Obama was presented with several Stormy Kromer caps when he\nvisited Marquette, Michigan, on February 10, 2011 to speak about wireless\ncommunication technologies. topnews|text|FRONTPAGE|accessdate=1\nNovember 2011|newspaper=Detroit Free Press|date=21 October 2011}} It has\nbecome a traditional garb in the Upper\nPeninsula.\n\nA version that is a 'tip of the hat' to the chapeau's Wisconsin roots is\navailable in Green Bay Packers green with the team logo and sold through Lambeau\nField.\n\nThe hats are unusual in that they carry a lifetime warranty against defects, and\na three year \"insurance policy\" for events such as loss, once the product is\nregistered.
