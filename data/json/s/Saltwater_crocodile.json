As its name\nimplies, this crocodile can live in salt water, but usually resides in mangrove\nswamps, estuaries, deltas, lagoons, and lower stretches of rivers. They have the\nbroadest distribution of any modern crocodile, ranging from the eastern coast of\nIndia, throughout most of Southeast Asia, stretching south to northern\nAustralia, and historically ranging as far west as off the eastern coast of\nAfrica and as far east as waters off of Japan.\n\nThe saltwater crocodile is a formidable, opportunistic, and adaptable predator\ncapable of taking almost any animal that enters its territory. It is an apex\npredator which preys on a variety of fish, crustaceans, reptiles, birds and\nmammals, including other predators. It is an ambush predator, waiting for a\nsuitable moment to attack. It has the strongest bite of any animal today, but\nits teeth are not designed to rip flesh, but to hold onto the prey item, which\nis an advantage that reduces the animal's chance of escape. These two properties allow the crocodile to\ncatch and drag the animal into the water with the minimal possibility of losing\nits prey. Then, the prey item is swallowed whole or torn into pieces either by\ndeath roll or by sudden jerks of the head. Saltwater crocodiles are considered\nas the most dangerous species of crocodiles to humans, although attacks and\nkilling are rare.\n\nSaltwater crocodiles are more territorial than other crocodilians, and are less\ntolerant of their own kind. Most crocodiles are social animals, sharing basking\nspots and food. Saltwater crocodiles do not fall into this category however,\nespecially in the case of adult males of the species. They are extremely\nterritorial and will fight off any intruders. The adult male will share his\nterritory with a female. Saltwater crocodiles mate in the wet season, laying\neggs in a nest made into a mound of mud and vegetation. The female guards the\nnest and hatchlings from predators. Conservation efforts were successful in this\nspecies, and it has recovered since the 1970s. Today, they aren't endangered in\nmany countries. However, some populations are still at risk.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Saltwater_crocodile","recorded":1372152440,"links":[],"instances":["animal","genus","biology","island","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Crocodylidae","Animals described in 1801","Marine reptiles","Reptiles of Australia","Reptiles of Western Australia","Reptiles of Bangladesh","Reptiles of Brunei","Reptiles of Cambodia","Reptiles of India","Reptiles of Indonesia","Reptiles of Malaysia","Reptiles of Burma","Reptiles of Papua New Guinea","Reptiles of the Philippines","Reptiles of Sri Lanka","Reptiles of Thailand","Reptiles of Vietnam","Megafauna of Australia","Megafauna of Eurasia","Fauna of the Solomon Islands","Fauna of Palau"],"headings":["Characteristics","Distribution and habitat","Biology and behaviour","Conservation status","Relationship with humans","See also","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["range","biology"],["territory","animal"],["egg","biology"],["territory","animal"],["komodo","island"],["python","genus"]],"members":["territory","python","range","komodo","egg"],"related":["Animal","Chordate","Reptilia","Crocodylia","Crocodylidae","Johann_Gottlob_Schneider","Reptile","Terrestrial","Riparian","Predator","Mangrove_swamp","Estuaries","River_delta","Lagoon","River","Range_(biology)","India","Southeast_Asia","Australia","Africa","Japan","Predator","Apex_predator","Fish","Crustacean","Reptile","Bird","Mammal","Predator","Ambush_predator","Bite","Territory_(animal)","Social","Egg_(biology)","Nest","Hatchling","Russia","Snout","Mugger_crocodile","Alligator","Poaching","Gene","Gene_pool","Trophy_hunting","Poaching","Odisha","India","Guinness_World_Book_of_Records","Bhitarkanika_National_Park","Territory_(animal)","Prey","Sexual_dimorphism","Crocodilian","India","Mugger_crocodile","Gharial","Bhitarkanika_Wildlife_Sanctuary","Sundarbans","Northern_Australia","Northern_Territory","Western_Australia","Queensland","Darwin,_Northern_Territory","Billabong","Estuaries","Freshwater_crocodile","Broome,_Western_Australia","Rockhampton,_Queensland","Alligator_Rivers","Arnhem_Land","Alligator","Freshwater_crocodile","New_Guinea","New_Guinea_crocodile","Bismarck_Archipelago","Kai_Islands","Aru_Islands","Maluku_Islands","Timor","Torres_Strait","Indochina","Thailand","Laos","Vietnam","Cambodia","Myanmar","Irrawaddy_Delta","Mekong_Delta","Indochina","Northern_Australia","New_Guinea","Indonesia","Malaysia","Borneo","Sumatra","Peninsular_Malaysia","Bali","Lombok","Komodo_(island)","Java","Ujung_Kulon_National_Park","Solomon_Islands","Vanuatu","Palau","Africa","Seychelles_Islands","Nile_crocodile","Australia","New_Caledonia","Iwo_Jima","Fiji","Sea_of_Japan","Fraser_Island","Wet_season","Fraser_Island","Crocodile","Salt_gland","Alligator","American_crocodile","Migratory_bird","Thermal_column","Ocean_current","Animal_migration_tracking","Open_ocean","Energy","River_system","Lethargy","Terrestrial_animal","Thermoregulation","Barnacle","Apex_predator","Prey","Fish","Frog","Insect","Invertebrate","Fish","Amphibian","Crustacean","Mollusc","Gastropod","Cephalopod","Bird","Mammal","Reptile","Snake","Lizard","Prey","Scylla_serrata","Bird","Emu","Water_bird","Bird","Bat","Wading_bird","Ungulate","Greater_mouse-deer","Hog_deer","Mammalian","Crab-eating_macaque","Gibbon","Porcupine","Wallaby","Mongoose","Civet","Flying_fox","Hare","Rodent","Badger","Otter","Fishing_cat","Chevrotain","Mammal","Deer","Sambar_deer","Muntjac","Chital","Wild_boar","Malayan_tapir","Monkey","Kangaroo","Dingo","Dhole","Jackal","Orangutan","Turtle","Python_(genus)","Monitor_lizard","Asia","Antelope","Serow","Nilgai","Banteng","Water_buffalo","Gaur","Bony_fish","Marine_animal","Sea_snake","Sea_turtle","Sea_bird","Dugong","Batoidea","Shark","Reef_shark","Nurse_shark","Bull_shark","Livestock","Chicken","Sheep","Pig","Horse","Cattle","Pet","Freshwater_crocodile","Sun_bear","Leopard","Tiger","Water_buffalo","Gaur","Asian_elephant","Suffolk_Punch","Death_roll","Extant","Teeth","Bite","Extant","Crocodile","Bovid","Bite","American_alligator","Gregory_M._Erickson","Extinct","Crocodilian","Anatomy","Anatomy","Skull","Muscle","Duct_tape","Goanna","Maximum_life_span","Monitor_lizard","Fish","Tiger","Leopard","Andaman_Islands","Indigenous_Australians","Arnhem_Land","Borneo","Sumatra","Eastern_India","Andaman_Islands","Burma","Nile_crocodile","Africa","Battle_of_Ramree_Island","Val_Plumwood","Lower_Kinabatangan_Segama_Wetlands","Borneo","Bay_of_Bengal","Jalajala,_Rizal","Luzon","Philippines","Odisha","Hooghly_River","Calcutta","Papua_New_Guinea","Philippines","Lolong","McArthur_River","Cattle","Crocodile_attack","Dromaeosaurid"]}
