It is usually done under local anesthetic in a physician's office,\nand results are often available in 4 to 10 days. It is commonly performed by\ndermatologists. Skin biopsies are also done by family physicians, internists,\nsurgeons, and other specialties. However, performed incorrectly, and without\nappropriate clinical information, a pathologist's interpretation of a skin\nbiopsy can be severely limited, and therefore doctors and patients may forego\ntraditional biopsy techniques and instead choose Mohs surgery. There are four\nmain types of skin biopsies: shave biopsy, punch biopsy, excisional biopsy, and\nincisional biopsy. The choice of the different skin biopsies is dependent on the\nsuspected diagnosis of the skin lesion. Like most biopsies, patient consent and\nanesthesia (usually lidocaine injected into the skin) are prerequisites.\n","linknr":258,"url":"Skin_biopsy","recorded":1362510879,"links":13,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Biopsy","Dermatologic surgery"],"headings":["Types","Pathology report","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Biopsy","Skin_lesion","Pathologist","Diagnosis","Mohs_surgery","Anesthesia","Scalpel","Hemostasis","Cauterization","Ferric_subsulfate_solution","Aluminum_chloride","Basal_cell_cancer","Squamous_cell_carcinoma","Actinic_keratosis","Keratinous","Astringent","Anticoagulant","Subcutaneous_fat","Dermis","Wide_local_excision","Surgical_margin","Melanoma","False_positive","Topical_anesthetic","Curette","Liquid_nitrogen","Cryotherapy","Needle_aspiration_biopsy","Lymph_node","Lipoma","Pseudomelanoma","Dysplasia","Hernia","Iatrogenic","Anetoderma","Hypertrophy","Pathology","Squamous_cell_carcinoma","Keratoacanthoma"]}
