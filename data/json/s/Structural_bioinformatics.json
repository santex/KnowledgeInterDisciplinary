{"cursor":"5405","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"__NOTOC__ 'Structural bioinformatics' is the branch of bioinformatics which is\nrelated to the analysis and prediction of the three-dimensional structure of\nbiological macromolecules such as proteins, RNA, and DNA. It deals with\ngeneralizations about macromolecular 3D structure such as comparisons of overall\nfolds and local motifs, principles of molecular folding, evolution, and binding\ninteractions, and structure/function relationships, working both from\nexperimentally solved structures and from computational models. The term\nstructural has the same meaning as in structural biology, and structural\nbioinformatics can be seen as a part of computational structural biology.\n","linknr":193,"url":"Structural_bioinformatics","recorded":1362505186,"links":18,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Structural bioinformatics|"],"headings":["See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Blue_morpho_butterfly.jpg/25px-Blue_morpho_butterfly.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8c/Integrated_circuit_icon.svg/25px-Integrated_circuit_icon.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Bioinformatics","Macromolecules","Proteins","RNA","DNA","Structural_biology","MMDB","Protein_Data_Bank","Structural_Classification_of_Proteins","STING","Molecular_modelling","List_of_software_for_molecular_mechanics_modeling","Molecular_Conceptor","CASP","ProtCID","Open-source","Kinemage","Web_service","CheShift","Biskit","UGENE","Opensource","Multiplatform","Protein_Data_Bank","MMDB"]}
