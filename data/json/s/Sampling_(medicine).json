{"cursor":"4813","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"Sampling}} In medicine, 'sampling' is gathering of matter from the body to aid\nin the process of a medical diagnosis and/or evaluation of an indication for\ntreatment, further medical tests or other procedures. In this sense, the\n'sample' is the gathered matter, and the 'sampling tool' or 'sampler' is the\nperson or material to collect the sample.\n\nSampling is a prerequisite for many medical tests, but generally not for medical\nhistory, physical examination and radiologic tests.\n","linknr":160,"url":"Sampling_(medicine)","recorded":1362510641,"links":11,"instances":["medicine","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Scientific terminology","Biological techniques and tools","Biological specimens"],"headings":["By sampling technique","By sampled matter","By component of interest","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["indication","medicine"],["cell","biology"]],"members":["indication","cell"],"related":["Medicine","Matter","Medical_diagnosis","Indication_(medicine)","Medical_test","Medical_test","Medical_history","Physical_examination","Radiologic_test","Urine","Feces","Sputum","Vomitus","Saliva","Cutting","Thoracocentesis","Pleural_fluid","Amniocentesis","Amniotic_fluid","Fine_needle_aspiration","Bone_marrow_aspiration","Capillary_blood_sampling","Pap_test","Spatula","Transvaginal","Epithelial_cell","DNA","Biopsy","Cytopathology","Bone_marrow_biopsy","Brain_biopsy","Skin_biopsy","Liver_biopsy","Bone_marrow_biopsy","Muscle_biopsy","Blood_test","Artery","Radial_artery_puncture","Arterial_blood_gas","Capillary_blood_sampling","Blood_lancet","Capillary_action","Diabetic","Glucose","Venous","Venipuncture","Blood_test","Phlebotomist","Test_tube","Cerebrospinal_fluid","Lumbar_puncture","Pleural_fluid","Thoracocentesis","Amniotic_fluid","Amniocentesis","Peritoneal_fluid","Peritoneocentesis","Cytopathology","Gynecologic_cancer","Electrolytes","Protein","Cell_(biology)","White_blood_cell","Blood_culture","Throat_culture","Cotton_swab","Throat","Sputum","Lungs","Sputum_culture"]}
