The investigation of a large population is related;\nthe members of a population are filtered by a metaphorical, rather than\nphysical, screen. If only part of a population is screened, screening is\nequivalent to sampling in statistics.

way of preventing cervical cancer from developing, and diagnosing\n  the disease at an early pre-cancerous stage *** Prostate cancer screening, an\n  attempt to identify individuals with prostate

screening, a program designed to screen infants shortly after birth\n  for a list of conditions that are treatable\n* Genetic screen, an experimental technique used to identify and select for\n  individuals who possess a phenotype of interest in a mutagenized population\n* Two-hybrid screening, a molecular biology technique used to discover\n  proteinâprotein interactions and proteinâDNA interactions\n* High-throughput screening, a method for scientific experimentation especially\n  used in drug discovery\n* High-content screening, a method that is used in biological research and drug\n  discovery to identify substances that alter the phenotype of a cell\n* Screening cultures, a type a medical test that is done to find an infection\n* Virtual screening, a computational technique used in drug discovery research\n\nSecurity\n* Terrorist Screening Database, the central terrorist watchlist consolidated by\n  the FBI's Terrorist Screening Center\n* Secondary Security Screening Selection, an airport security measure in the\n  United States and Canada which selects passengers for additional inspection\n* Call screening, the process of evaluating the characteristics of a telephone\n  call before deciding how or whether to answer it\n\nOther investigative uses\n* Screening (economics), a strategy of combating adverse selection\n* Mechanical screening, the practice of taking granulated ore material and\n  separating it into multiple grades by particle size\n* Screening of articles, selection of articles for a systematic review\n* Screening (tactical), one military unit providing cover for another in terms\n  of both physical presence and firepower\n\nBarriers 'Screening' can also mean preventing access of something by some sort\nof barrier:\n* Electric-field screening, the damping of electric fields caused by the\n  presence of mobile charge carriers\n* Electromagnetic shielding, the exclusion of electric, magnetic, or\n  electromagnetic fields by a metallic screen or shield\n* Screening effect or atomic shielding, the reduction of effective nuclear\n  charge by intervening electron shells\n* Screening (printing), a process that represents lighter shades as tiny dots,\n  rather than solid areas, of ink by passing ink through a perforated screen\n* Screening is a process stage when cleaning paper pulp\n* Screening resumes, the

commercially made film to a group of\n  people somewhere other than one of their homes\n\nSee also\n* Stochastic screening, a halftone process based on pseudo-random distribution\n  of halftone dots, using frequency modulation (FM) to change the density of\n  dots according to the gray level desired\n* Screen
