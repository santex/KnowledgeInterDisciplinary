They differ greatly from true toads (those of the\nfamily Bufonidae) by having eyes with vertical pupils, no parotoid glands, and\nrelatively smooth skin. Their most distinctive feature is a spade-like\nprojection on their hind feet, from which their common name is derived. This\nprojection enables spadefoot toads to dig in loose soils with ease.\n","title":"spea","headings":["Species","Related species","References"]},"micro-relation":["2: Scaphiopodidae","2: Edward_Drinker_Cope","1: Animal","1: Chordate","1: Amphibia","1: Frog","1: Mesobatrachia","1: Genus","1: North_America","1: Amphibian","1: Toad","1: Bufonidae","1: Eye","1: Pupil","1: Parotoid_gland","1: Skin","1: Europe","1: Pelobatidae","1: Species","1: Plains_spadefoot_toad","1: Spencer_Fullerton_Baird","1: Great_Basin_spadefoot","1: New_Mexico_spadefoot_toad","1: Couch's_spadefoot_toad","1: Richard_Harlan","1: Hurter's_spadefoot_toad","1: Strecker"]}
