Similar to carnelian is 'sard', which\nis generally harder and darker (the difference is not rigidly defined, and the\ntwo names are often used interchangeably). Both carnelian and sard are varieties\nof the silica mineral chalcedony colored by impurities of iron oxide. The color\ncan vary greatly, ranging from pale orange to an intense almost-black\ncoloration. It is most commonly found in Brazil, India, Siberia, and Germany.\n","title":"Carnelian","headings":["History","Etymology","Distinction between carnelian and sard","See also","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["2: Chalcedony","2: Silica","1: Mineral","1: Gemstone","1: Engraved_gem","1: Ptolemaic_dynasty","1: Cabinet_des_Médailles","1: Signet_ring","1: Korwin_coat_of_arms","1: Bow_drill","1: Mehrgarh","1: Bronze_Age","1: Minoan_civilization","1: Knossos","1: Crete","1: Before_the_Common_Era","1: Engraved_gems","1: Seal_ring","1: Assyria","1: Cylinder_seal","1: Ancient_Egypt","1: Phoenicia","1: Ancient_Greece","1: Hebrew_language","1: Hoshen","1: Jasper","1: Mycenaean_Greece","1: Enkomi","1: British_Museum","1: Romance_languages","1: Mediaeval_Latin","1: Latin","1: European_Cornel","1: Oxford_English_Dictionary","1: Pliny_the_Elder","1: Sardis","1: Lydia","1: Persian_language","1: List_of_minerals","1: Sardonyx"]}
