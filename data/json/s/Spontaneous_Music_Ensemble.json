SME performances and recordings could range from Stevens-Watts\nduos to gatherings of more than a dozen players.\n\nAs critic Brian Olewnick writes, the SME emphasised an \"extremely open,\nleaderless aspect where a premium was placed on careful and considered listening\non the part of the musicians. Saxophonist Evan Parker observed that Stevens had\ntwo basic rules: (1) If you can't hear another musician, you're playing too\nloud, and (2) if the music you're producing doesn't regularly relate to what\nyou're hearing others create, why be in the group? This led to the development\nof what would jocularly become known as 'insect improv' -- music that tended to\nbe very quiet, very intense, arrhythmic, and by and large atonal.\"\n|accessdate =2010-12-28}}\n","linknr":142,"url":"Spontaneous_Music_Ensemble","recorded":1362675940,"links":14,"instances":["guitarist","musician","guitarist","group","trombone_player","drummer"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Free jazz ensembles","Free improvisation ensembles","Nessa Records artists","Musical groups disestablished in 1994","Emanem Records artists","Avant-garde jazz ensembles"],"headings":["History","Discography","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c5/Sme1.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["john_stevens","drummer"],["roger_smith","guitarist"],["derek_bailey","guitarist"],["paul_rutherford","trombone_player"],["john_butcher","musician"],["amm","group"]],"members":["roger_smith","john_butcher","derek_bailey","amm","paul_rutherford","john_stevens"],"related":["Free_improvising","London","Jazz","Drummer","Trumpeter","John_Stevens_(drummer)","Trevor_Watts","Evan_Parker","Evan_Parker","Kenny_Wheeler","Roger_Smith_(guitarist)","Nigel_Coombes","Derek_Bailey_(guitarist)","Paul_Rutherford_(trombone_player)","Maggie_Nicols","Dave_Holland","Barry_Guy","Peter_Kowald","Kent_Carter","John_Butcher_(musician)","AMM_(group)","Anton_Webern","Samuel_Beckett","Jazz","Kenny_Wheeler","Trevor_Watts","Jeff_Clyne","Evan_Parker","Island_Records","Emanem_Records","Norma_Winstone","Peter_Lemer","Johnny_Dyani","Nessa_Records","Julie_Driscoll","Emanem_Records","Emanem_Records","Incus_Records","Psi_Records","Emanem_Records","Emanem_Records"]}
