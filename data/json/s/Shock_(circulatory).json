In the early stages this is generally an\ninadequate tissue level of oxygen.\n\nThe typical signs of shock are low blood pressure, a rapid heartbeat and signs\nof poor end-organ perfusion or \"decompensation/peripheral shut down\" (such as\nlow urine output, confusion or loss of consciousness). There are times that a\nperson's blood pressure may remain stable, but may still be in circulatory\nshock, so it is not always a sign.\n\nCirculatory shock should not be confused with the emotional state of shock, as\nthe two are not related. Circulatory shock is a life-threatening medical\nemergency and one of the most common causes of death for critically ill people.\nShock can have a variety of effects, all with similar outcomes, but all relate\nto a problem with the body's circulatory system. For example, shock may lead to\nhypoxemia (a lack of oxygen in arterial blood) or cardiac arrest.\n\nOne of the key dangers of shock is that it progresses by a positive feedback\nmechanism. Once shock begins, it tends to make itself worse. This is why\nimmediate treatment of shock is critical.\n","linknr":741,"url":"Shock_(circulatory)","recorded":1362899704,"links":58,"instances":["biochemistry","medical","medical","psychological"],"pdf":["http://www.chestjournal.org/content/101/6/1644.full.pdf","http://www.chestjournal.org/content/101/6/1644.full.pdf"],"categories":["Intensive care medicine","Medical emergencies","Causes of death"],"headings":["Signs and symptoms","Pathophysiology","Diagnosis","Differential diagnosis","Management","Epidemiology","Prognosis","History","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/Shock-cell2.svg/500px-Shock-cell2.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["substrate","biochemistry"],["shock","psychological"],["hypoxia","medical"],["trauma","medical"]],"members":["substrate","hypoxia","trauma","shock"],"related":["Medical","Substrate_(biochemistry)","Oxygen","Hypotension","Tachycardia","Perfusion","Shock_(psychological)","Medical_emergency","Hypoxemia","Cardiac_arrest","Positive_feedback","Hypotension","Beta_blocker","Vasoconstriction","Hypothermia","Livedo_reticularis","Jugular_vein","Jugular_venous_pressure","Arrhythmia","Pulsus_paradoxus","Cardiac_tamponade","Sepsis","Anaphalaxis","Endocrine","Neurogenic_shock","Hives","Edema","Bronchospasm","Oedema","Hypoxia_(medical)","Lactic_acid_fermentation","Pyruvate","Citric_acid_cycle","Lactic_acidosis","Acidosis","Hyperventilate","Baroreceptors","Artery","Hypotension","Epinephrine","Norepinephrine","Vasoconstriction","Heart_rate","Epinephrine","Heart_rate","Blood_vessel","Blood_pressure","Renin","Angiotensin","Arginine_vasopressin","Anti-diuretic_hormone","Kidneys","Gastrointestinal_tract","Lungs","Brain","Renal","Urine","Renin","Angiotensin","Homeostatic","Sodium","Potassium","Sphincters","Capillaries","Histamine","Protein","Viscosity","Ischemic","Septic_shock","Brain_damage","Adenosine_triphosphate","Adenosine","Vasodilation","Uric_acid","Phosphorylate","Leukocyte","Disseminated_intravascular_coagulation","Neutrophils","Cardiac_output","Mixed_venous_oxygen_saturation","Pulmonary_artery","Pulmonary_artery_catheter","Central_venous_oxygen_saturation","Anaerobic_metabolism","Lactic_acid","Chest_X-ray","Blood_volume","Circulatory_system","Vomiting","Diarrhea","Diabetic_ketoacidosis","Diabetes_insipidus","Myocardial_infarction","Cardiac_dysrhythmia","Cardiomyopathy","Myocarditis","Congestive_heart_failure","Myocardial_contusion","Cardiac_valve","Cardiac_tamponade","Constrictive_pericarditis","Pericardium","Tension_pneumothorax","Pulmonary_embolism","Lung","Aortic_stenosis","Ventricular_outflow_tract","Septic_shock","Vasodilation","Gram_negative","Endotoxin","Gram-positive","Pneumococci","Streptococci","Anaphylactic_shock","Anaphylaxis","Allergen","Antigen","Drug","Histamine","Neurogenic_shock","Bradycardia","Sympathetic_nervous_system","Spinal_shock","Spinal_cord","Endocrine","Hypothyroidism","Cardiogenic_shock","Cardiac_output","Hypotension","Hyperthyroidism","Cardiogenic_shock","Adrenal_insufficiency","Distributive_shock","Corticosteroid","Distributive_shock","Cortisol","Septic_shock","Intubation","Passive_leg_raise","Trendelenburg_position","Normal_saline","Colloids","Crystalloid_fluid","Packed_red_blood_cells","Hemoglobin","Hypotension","Permissive_hypotension","Mean_arterial_pressure","Systolic_blood_pressure","Vasopressors","Hemorrhagic_shock","Trauma_(medical)","Neurogenic_shock","Activated_protein_C","Septic_shock","Sodium_bicarbonate","Central_venous_pressure","Mean_arterial_pressure"]}
