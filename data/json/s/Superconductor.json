It was discovered by Dutch physicist Heike\nKamerlingh Onnes on April 8, 1911 in Leiden. Like ferromagnetism and atomic\nspectral lines, superconductivity is a quantum mechanical phenomenon. It is\ncharacterized by the Meissner effect, the complete ejection of magnetic field\nlines from the interior of the superconductor as it transitions into the\nsuperconducting state. The occurrence of the Meissner effect indicates that\nsuperconductivity cannot be understood simply as the idealization of [[perfect\nconductor|perfect conductivity]] in classical physics.\n","recorded":1362124209,"portal":[],"list":[],"links":"637","instances":["phase_transition","chemistry","phase_transition","publisher","quantum_mechanics","journal","thermodynamics","physics","element","journal","thermodynamics","matter","science","structure","superconductivity"],"pdf":["http://www.physik.fu-berlin.de/~kleinert/97/97.pdf","http://www.physik.fu-berlin.de/~kleinert/97/97.pdf","http://www.physik.fu-berlin.de/~kleinert/papers/sudbotre064524.pdf","http://www.physik.fu-berlin.de/~kleinert/papers/sudbotre064524.pdf","http://ilorentz.org/history/cold/DelftKes_HKO_PT.pdf","http://dome.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.3/40618/MC665_r15_M-3843.pdf"],"categories":["Phases
