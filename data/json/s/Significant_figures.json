{"cursor":"14692","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The 'significant figures' (also known as 'significant digits' in American\nEnglish, and often shortened to 'sig figs' or 'sig digs') of a number are those\ndigits that carry meaning contributing to its precision. This includes all\ndigits except:\n* Certain leading and trailing zeros which are merely placeholders to indicate\n  the scale of the number. (Exact rules are explained in the section\n  \"Identifying significant figures\".)\n* Spurious digits introduced, for example, by calculations carried out to\n  greater precision than that of the original data, or measurements reported to\n  a greater precision than the equipment supports.\n\nSignificance arithmetic are approximate rules for roughly maintaining\nsignificance throughout a computation. The more sophisticated scientific rules\nare known as propagation of uncertainty.\n\nNumbers are often rounded to avoid reporting insignificant figures. For\ninstance, if a device measures to the nearest gram and gives a reading of\n12.345 kg, it would create false precision to express this measurement as\n12.34500 kg. Numbers can also be rounded merely for simplicity rather than\nto indicate a given precision of measurement, for example to make them faster to\npronounce in news broadcasts.\n\n'Arthithmetic precision' can also be defined with reference to a fixed number of\n'decimal places' (the number of digits following the point). This second\ndefinition is useful in financial and engineering applications where the number\nof digits in the fractional part has particular importance, but it does not\nfollow the rules of significance arithmetic.\n","linknr":172,"url":"Significant_figures","recorded":1362480334,"links":28,"instances":["computer_science","symbol"],"pdf":["http://www.ligo.caltech.edu/~vsanni/ph3/SignificantFiguresAndMeasurements/SignificantFiguresAndMeasurements.pdf"],"categories":["Arithmetic","Numerical analysis"],"headings":["Identifying significant figures","Rounding and decimal places","Arithmetic","Estimation","Relationship to accuracy and precision in measurement","In computing","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["vinculum","symbol"],["precision","computer_science"]],"members":["precision","vinculum"],"related":["American_English","Numerical_digit","Accuracy_and_precision","Leading_zeros","Trailing_zeros","Significance_arithmetic","Propagation_of_uncertainty","Rounding","False_precision","Radix_point","Vinculum_(symbol)","Unit_of_measurement","Unit_prefix","Hecto-","Plus-minus_sign","Scientific_notation","Significand","Rounding","Arithmetic_precision","Decimal_separator","Decimal","Rounding","Rounding","Floor_and_ceiling_functions","Absolute_value","Order_of_magnitude","Binomial_proportion_confidence_interval","Floating_point_numbers","Binary_number","Approximation_error","Engineering_notation","Interval_arithmetic","Kahan_summation_algorithm","False_precision","Precision_(computer_science)","Round-off_error","IEEE754"]}
