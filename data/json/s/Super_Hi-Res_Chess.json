{"cursor":"3021","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Super Hi-Res Chess' was a novelty computer program for the Apple II written by\n(then) Apple Computer applications programmer Bruce Tognazzini in 1978, early in\nthe history of Apple computer. It was a practical joke program purporting to be\na chess game in high-resolution (hi-res) graphics, but which actually contained\nno chess or graphics. When the unsuspecting user tried to run the program, it\npromptly crashed with a syntax error, appearing to return the user to the\nApplesoft BASIC command line input mode. However, when the user attempted to use\nany BASIC or Apple DOS commands, there would be humorous results, since the\nprogram was actually still running and only pretending to be the Apple's command\nline processor. Many different commands were \"parodied\", with silly error\nmessages resulting.\n\n\"Tog\" later expanded the program to include both the LISP and UCSD Pascal\nlanguage syntax, redistributing it under the name \"Cattlecar Galactica.\"\n\nThe program's name appeared in the directory of the floppy disk, but opening and\nlisting this file revealed no useful contents. Instead, the user found only\nhundreds of page-feed commands and a small amount of seemingly random code.\nThat's because that's all there was. The actual program on the disk was hidden\nin plain sight. It was called \"Applesoft,\" for Applesoft BASIC, the name of\nMicrosoft's floating point BASIC licensed by Apple in the early years. Because\nprogrammers expected to see a copy of Applesoft on every disk, they would never\neven suspect they should look there for the program. Naive users, on the other\nhand, were just as likely to look there as anywhere else, giving them the upper\nhand in discovering the actual program.\n\nThe way out of the programâthe goal of the gameâwas equally stacked against\nprogrammers. The magic word for escaping the program and gaining access to the\ncode was \"egress,\" with sufficient clues that English majors could easily\nescape, but programmers unfamiliar with the word could not. (English majors\noften found their way out within about 30 minutes; some programmers took a week\nor more, working their way through the disk by track and sector, looking for\nclues in the underlying code.)\n\nTog had barely started on the program when a group of other Apple programmers\ngathered around to play with it. Steve Jobs happened upon them, yelled that it\nwas a complete waste of time, and sent everyone back to work, forbidding Tog to\nwork on it any more. Based on this admonishment, Tog did little else but work on\nit for the next seven weeks, releasing it free to the Apple II user groups,\nwhich rapidly spread it around the world. The story of Steve's intervention\nappeared in the movie, \"Pirates of Silicon Valley,\" where the program was\nreferred to as \"a parody of BASIC.\"\n","linknr":83,"url":"Super_Hi-Res_Chess","recorded":1375058308,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Super_Hi-Res_Chess&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Super_Hi-Res_Chess&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Computer_program","/wiki/Apple_II","/wiki/Apple_Computer","/wiki/Bruce_Tognazzini","/wiki/Practical_joke","/wiki/Chess","/wiki/Applesoft_BASIC","/wiki/LISP","/wiki/UCSD_Pascal","/wiki/Applesoft_BASIC","/wiki/Microsoft","/wiki/Egress_filtering","/wiki/Steve_Jobs","/wiki/Pirates_of_Silicon_Valley","/w/index.php?title=Super_Hi-Res_Chess&action=edit&section=1","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Super_Hi-Res_Chess&oldid=514714985","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Apple_II_software","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Super+Hi-Res+Chess&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Super+Hi-Res+Chess","/wiki/Super_Hi-Res_Chess","/wiki/Talk:Super_Hi-Res_Chess","#","/wiki/Super_Hi-Res_Chess","/w/index.php?title=Super_Hi-Res_Chess&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Super_Hi-Res_Chess&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Super_Hi-Res_Chess","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Super_Hi-Res_Chess","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Super_Hi-Res_Chess&oldid=514714985","/w/index.php?title=Super_Hi-Res_Chess&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7642404","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Super_Hi-Res_Chess&id=514714985","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Super+Hi-Res+Chess","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Super+Hi-Res+Chess&oldid=514714985&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Super_Hi-Res_Chess&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7642404#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Hi-Res_Chess","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Apple II software"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Computer_program","Apple_II","Apple_Computer","Bruce_Tognazzini","Practical_joke","Chess","Applesoft_BASIC","LISP","UCSD_Pascal","Applesoft_BASIC","Microsoft","Egress_filtering","Steve_Jobs","Pirates_of_Silicon_Valley"]}
