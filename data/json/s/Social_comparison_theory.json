Social comparison theory is centered on the belief that there\nis a drive within individuals to gain accurate self-evaluations. The theory\nexplains how individuals evaluate their own opinions and abilities by comparing\nthemselves to others in order to reduce uncertainty in these domains, and learn\nhow to define the self.\n\nFollowing the initial theory, research began to focus on social comparison as a\nway of self-enhancement (Gruder, 1971; Wills, 1981), introducing the concepts of\ndownward and upward comparisons and expanding the motivations of social\ncomparisons (e.g. Schachter, 1959).\n","linknr":162,"url":"Social_comparison_theory","recorded":1362671215,"links":20,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Sociological theories","Communication","Communication theory","Attitude change"],"headings":["Initial framework","Main criticisms and further development","History","References","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Psi2.svg/40px-Psi2.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Psi2.svg/16px-Psi2.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Social_psychologist","Leon_Festinger","Upward_social_comparison","Downward_social_comparison","Communication","Social_psychology","Proxy_Model","Triadic_Model","Three-Selves_Model","Social_Cognitive_Theory","Assimilation_effect","Self-concept","Ford_Foundation","Socio-psychological_processes","Social_communication","Group_dynamics","Autokinetic_effect","Compliant_behavior","Social_groups","Level_of_aspiration","Attribution_Theory","Aristotle","Plato","Kant","Marx","Rousseau"]}
