It consists of a molecule of D-galactose and a\n molecule of D-glucose bonded by beta-1-4 glycosidic linkage. It has a formula\n of C 12 H22 O11 .]]\n\nA 'carbohydrate' is an organic compound that consists only of carbon, hydrogen,\nand oxygen, usually with a hydrogen:oxygen atom ratio of 2:1 (as in water); in\nother words, with the empirical formula . (Some exceptions exist; for example,\ndeoxyribose, a component of DNA, has the empirical formula\nC 5H 10 O4 .) Carbohydrates are not technically\nhydrates of carbon. Structurally it is more accurate to view them as polyhydroxy\naldehydes and ketones.\n\nThe term is most common in biochemistry, where it is a synonym of 'saccharide'.\nThe carbohydrates (saccharides) are divided into four chemical groupings:\nmonosaccharides, disaccharides, oligosaccharides, and polysaccharides. In\ngeneral, the monosaccharides and disaccharides, which are smaller (lower\nmolecular weight) carbohydrates, are commonly referred to as sugars.\nThe word saccharide comes from the Greek word ÏÎ¬ÎºÏÎ±ÏÎ¿Î½ (sÃ¡kkharon), meaning\n\"sugar.\" While the scientific nomenclature of carbohydrates is complex, the\nnames of the monosaccharides and disaccharides very often end in the suffix -\nose. For example, blood sugar is the monosaccharide glucose, table sugar is the\ndisaccharide sucrose, and milk sugar is the disaccharide lactose (see\nillustration).\n\nCarbohydrates perform numerous roles in living organisms. Polysaccharides serve\nfor the storage of energy (e.g., starch and glycogen), and as structural\ncomponents (e.g., cellulose in plants and chitin in arthropods). The 5-carbon\nmonosaccharide ribose is an important component of coenzymes (e.g., ATP, FAD,\nand NAD) and the backbone of the genetic molecule known as RNA. The related\ndeoxyribose is a component of DNA. Saccharides and their derivatives include\nmany other important biomolecules that play key roles in the immune system,\nfertilization, preventing pathogenesis, blood clotting, and\ndevelopment.\n\nIn food science and in many informal contexts, the term carbohydrate often means\nany food that is particularly rich in the complex carbohydrate starch (such as\ncereals, bread, and pasta) or simple carbohydrates, such as sugar (found in\ncandy, jams, and desserts).\n\nCarbohydrates are often found in many energy bars and isotonics due to the\nenergy that is contained.\n","linknr":815,"url":"Saccharide","recorded":1362507817,"links":120,"instances":["waves","letter","biochemistry","chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Carbohydrates|Carbohydrates","Nutrition"],"headings":["Structure","Monosaccharides","Disaccharides","Nutrition","Metabolism","Carbohydrate
