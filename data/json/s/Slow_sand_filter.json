They are typically 1 to 2 metres deep, can be\nrectangular or cylindrical in cross section and are used primarily to treat\nsurface water. The length and breadth of the tanks are determined by the flow\nrate desired by the filters, which typically have a loading rate of 0.1 to 0.2\nmetres per hour (or cubic metres per square metre per hour).\n\nSlow sand filters differs from all other filters used to treat drinking water in\nthat they work by using a complex biological film the grows naturally on the\nsurface of the sand. The sand itself does not perform any filtration function\nbut simply acts as a substrate.\n\nAlthough they are often the preferred technology in many developing countries\nbecause of their low energy requirements and robust performance. They are also\nused to treat water in some of the most developed countries such as the UK where\nthey are used to treat water supplied to London. Slow sand filters now are also\nbeing tested for pathogen control of nutrient solutions in hydroponic systems.\n","linknr":188,"url":"Slow_sand_filter","recorded":1362511490,"links":25,"instances":["engineering"],"pdf":["http://www.the-ecentre.net/resources/e_library/doc/11-WATER.pdf","http://www.epa.gov/safewater/regs/swtrsms.pdf","http://www.nesc.wvu.edu/pdf/DW/publications/ontap/tech_brief/TB15_SlowSand.pdf","http://www.the-ecentre.net/resources/e_library/doc/11-WATER.pdf","http://www.epa.gov/safewater/regs/swtrsms.pdf"],"categories":["Water filters","Appropriate technology","Environmental soil science","DIY culture"],"headings":["Method of operation","Features","Advantages","Disadvantages","See also","Notes","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/34/Lindley-filtr-powolny.jpg/220px-Lindley-filtr-powolny.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Slow_sand_filter_EPA.jpg/220px-Slow_sand_filter_EPA.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/Vsakovac%C3%AD_n%C3%A1dr%C5%BEe_um%C4%9Bl%C3%A9_infiltrace_v_%C3%9AV_K%C3%A1ran%C3%BD.jpg/220px-Vsakovac%C3%AD_n%C3%A1dr%C5%BEe_um%C4%9Bl%C3%A9_infiltrace_v_%C3%9AV_K%C3%A1ran%C3%BD.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/12px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["redundancy","engineering"]],"members":["redundancy"],"related":["Water_purification","Raw_water","UK","London","Biofilm","Hypogeal","Bacterium","Fungi","Protozoa","Rotifera","Bryozoa","Mollusca","Annelid","Adsorbed","Sand_filter","Redundancy_(engineering)","Turbidity","Raw_water","Water_treatment","Supernatant","Appropriate_technology","Diy","World_Health_Organization","Oxfam","United_Nations","United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency","Rapid_sand_filter","Bank_filtration","BioSand_Filter"]}
