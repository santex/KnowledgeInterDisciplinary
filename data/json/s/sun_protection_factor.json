      "text" : "\n\n'Sunscreen' (also commonly known as sunblock, sun screen, sunburn cream, sun\ncream or block out and sometimes erroneously called suntan lotion)<ref></ref> is\na lotion, spray, gel or other topical product that absorbs or reflects some of\nthe sun's ultraviolet (UV) radiation on the skin exposed to sunlight and thus\nhelps protect against sunburn. Skin-lightening products have sunscreen to\nprotect lightened skin because light skin is more susceptible to sun damage than\ndarker skin. A number of sunscreens have tanning powder to help the skin to\ndarken or tan; however, tanning powder does not provide protection from UV rays.\n\nDepending on the mode of action sunscreens can be classified into physical\nsunscreens (i.e., those that reflect the sunlight) or chemical sunscreens (i.e.,\nthose that absorb the UV light).<ref name =\"pharmax\">[http://pharmaxchange.info/press/2011/03/the-ageing-skin-part-4a-\nsunscreens/ Sunscreens | The Ageing Skin]</ref> Although sunscreen is sometimes\ncalled \"indoor tanning lotion\", the latter is different in that it is used to\nintensify UV rays whereas the former is used to block UV rays.\n\nMedical organizations such as the American Cancer Society recommend the use of\nsunscreen because it aids in the prevention of developing squamous cell\ncarcinomas and basal-cell carcinomas.<ref>[http://www.cancer.org/docroot/PED/co-\nntent/ped_7_1_What_You_Need_To_Know_About_Skin_Cancer.asp What You Need To Know\nAbout Skin Cancer]</ref> Many sunscreens do not block UVA radiation, which does\nnot cause sunburn but can increase the rate of melanoma, another kind of skin\ncancer, and photodermatitis, so people using sunscreens may be exposed to high\nUVA levels without realizing it.<ref></ref> The use of broad-spectrum (UVA/UVB)\nsunscreens can address this concern. Diligent use of sunscreen can also slow or\ntemporarily prevent the development of wrinkles and sagging skin.<ref\nname=wrinkles></ref>\n",
