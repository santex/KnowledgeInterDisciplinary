To\nbe termed scientific, a method of inquiry must be based on empirical and\nmeasurable evidence subject to specific principles of reasoning. \"[4] Rules\nfor the study of natural philosophy\", , from Book '3', The System of the World.\n The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] defines the scientific method as: \"a\nmethod or procedure that has characterized natural science since the 17th\ncentury, consisting in systematic observation, measurement, and experiment, and\nthe formulation, testing, and modification of hypotheses.\" Oxford English\nDictionary - entry for scientific.\n\nThe chief characteristic which distinguishes the scientific method from other\nmethods of acquiring knowledge is that scientists seek to let reality speak for\nitself, supporting a theory when a theory's predictions are confirmed and\nchallenging a theory when its predictions prove false. Although procedures vary\nfrom one field of inquiry to another, identifiable features distinguish\nscientific inquiry from other methods of obtaining knowledge. Scientific\nresearchers propose hypotheses as explanations of phenomena, and design\nexperimental studies to test these hypotheses via predictions which can be\nderived from them. These steps must be repeatable, to guard against mistake or\nconfusion in any particular experimenter. Theories that encompass wider domains\nof inquiry may bind many independently derived hypotheses together in a\ncoherent, supportive structure. Theories, in turn, may help form new hypotheses\nor place groups of hypotheses into context.\n\nScientific inquiry is generally intended to be as objective as possible in order\nto reduce biased interpretations of results. Another basic expectation is to\ndocument, archive and share all data and methodology so they are available for\ncareful scrutiny by other scientists, giving them the opportunity to verify\nresults by attempting to reproduce them. This practice, called full disclosure,\nalso allows statistical measures of the reliability of these data to be\nestablished (when data is sampled or compared to chance).\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Scientific_analysis","recorded":1362479232,"links":0,"instances":["statistics","taleb_book","abstract","geologist_and_historian","book_publisher","science","archaeology","mathematics","mathematics","science","philosophy","logic","astronomer","journal","planet","philosopher","mathematics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Scientific
