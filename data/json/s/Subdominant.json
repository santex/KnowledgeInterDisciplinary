[http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=subdominant\n\"Subdominant\"], Dictionary.com. In the C major scale (white keys on a\npiano, starting on C), the subdominant is the note F; and the subdominant chord\nuses the notes F, A, and C. In music theory, Roman numerals are used to\nsymbolize the subdominant chord as 'IV' if it is within the major mode (because\nit is a major triad, for example F-A-C in C major) or 'iv' if it is within the\nminor mode (because it is a minor triad, for example F-A-C in C minor).\n\n\n\nBecause ii 6, ii, and neapolitan sixth chords contain the fourth\nscale degree in the bass, they are also considered subdominant harmonies\nbecause they substitute for the same harmonic purpose as chords built on the\nfourth scale degree.\n\n\nA cadential subdominant chord followed by a tonic chord (the chord of the key of\nthe piece) produces the so-called \"plagal\" (or \"Amen\") cadence.\n\n\"Subdominant\" also refers to a relationship of musical keys. For example,\nrelative to the key of C major, the key of F major is the subdominant. Music\nwhich modulates (changes key) often modulates into the subdominant when the\nleading tone is lowered by a half step to the subtonic (B to B in the key of C).\nModulation into the subdominant key often creates a sense of musical relaxation;\nas opposed to modulation into dominant (fifth note of the scale), which\nincreases tension.\n\nIn sonata form, the subdominant key plays a subordinate though still crucial\nrole: typically, in the recapitulation, there is a section written in the\nsubdominant key, occurring at the point corresponding to the location in the\nexposition where the music modulated into the dominant key. The use of the\nsubdominant in this location often serves as a way of keeping the rest of\nrecapitulation in the tonic.\n\n dodecagram. McCartin, Brian J. (1998). \"Prelude to Musical Geometry\".

In C,\n the tonic would be on the top with subdominant and dominant at the bottom both\n equidistant to the tonic.]] As with other chords which may or tend to precede\n the dominant the 'subdominant' diatonic function acts as a dominant\n preparation or predominant. In theories after Hugo Riemann it is considered to\n balance the dominant around the tonic (being as far below the tonic as the\n dominant is above).\n","linknr":292,"url":"Subdominant","recorded":1362582303,"links":47,"instances":["music","music","music","music","music","music","music","music"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Diatonic functions","Scale degrees"],"headings":["Sources"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/Subdominant_and_tonic_in_C.png/220px-Subdominant_and_tonic_in_C.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/Loudspeaker.svg/11px-Loudspeaker.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/de/IV-V-I_in_C.png/220px-IV-V-I_in_C.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/Loudspeaker.svg/11px-Loudspeaker.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/Major_seventh_chord_on_F.png/220px-Major_seventh_chord_on_F.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/Loudspeaker.svg/11px-Loudspeaker.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a4/I-IV-I_in_C.png/220px-I-IV-I_in_C.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/Loudspeaker.svg/11px-Loudspeaker.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/Pitch_class_space_star.svg/220px-Pitch_class_space_star.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/4/1/741dfb4739b843fe5a5e2070fc2b2874.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/c/6/f/c6ff2e8ba24662fac31e344516a3adc0.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/1/0/b/10b760f83286d29b6d2d770e4442b224.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/3/e/f3eb278ecaa657a099535fe7026beb66.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/a/d/9/ad9dc2a09c116ca6d0d1ef6a9e58d55b.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/0/e/f0ecef7ce2286fbeb294880fc12cc218.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/3/6/9/3694e17fa5acccf595c9a60d505aec12.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/3/6/9/3694e17fa5acccf595c9a60d505aec12.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["degree","music"],["tonic","music"],["dominant","music"],["note","music"],["note","music"],["chord","music"],["triad","music"],["cadence","music"],["dominant","music"],["recapitulation","music"]],"members":["degree","recapitulation","triad","chord","note","cadence","dominant","tonic"],"related":["Music","Degree_(music)","Diatonic_scale","Tonic_(music)","Dominant_(music)","Oswald_Jonas","Note_(music)","Major_scale","Note_(music)","Chord_(music)","Music_theory","Roman_numeral_analysis","Triad_(music)","Neapolitan_sixth","Cadence_(music)","Leading_tone","Subtonic","Dominant_(music)","Sonata_form","Recapitulation_(music)","Dodecagram","Diatonic_function","Predominant","Hugo_Riemann"]}
