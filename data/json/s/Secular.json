{"cursor":"7677","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Secularity' (adjective form 'secular', The American Heritage Dictionary of\nthe English Language, Fourth Edition. \"Secularity\". (\"1. The condition or\nquality of being secular. 2. Something secular.\") from Latin saecularis\nmeaning \"worldly\" or \"temporal\") is the state of being separate from religion,\nor not being exclusively allied or against any particular religion.\n\nFor instance, eating and bathing may be regarded as examples of secular\nactivities, because there may not be anything inherently religious about them.\nNevertheless, both eating and bathing are regarded as sacraments in some\nreligious traditions, and therefore would be religious activities in those world\nviews. Saying a prayer derived from religious text or doctrine, worshipping\nthrough the context of a religion, and attending a religious school are examples\nof religious (non-secular) activities. Prayer and meditation are not necessarily\nnon-secular, since the concepts of spirituality and higher consciousness are not\nmarried solely to any religion but are practiced and arose independently across\na continuum of cultures.\n\nA related term, secularism, is the principle that government institutions and\ntheir representatives should remain separate from religious institutions, their\nbeliefs, and their dignitaries. Most businesses and corporations, and some\ngovernments, are secular organizations. All of the state universities in the\nUnited States are secular organizations (especially because of the combined\neffect of the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution)\nwhile some private universities are connected with the Christian or Jewish\nreligions. Among many of these, some prominent examples are Baylor University,\nBrigham Young University, Boston College, Emory University, the University of\nNotre Dame, Duquesne University, Texas Christian University, Southern Methodist\nUniversity, and Yeshiva College.\n\nThe public university systems of the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand,\nCanada, and Japan are also secular, although some government-funded primary and\nsecondary schools may be religiously aligned in some countries.\n","linknr":265,"url":"Secular","recorded":1362477185,"links":23,"instances":["common_law","yeshiva_university","catholic_church"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Religion and society","Secularism"],"headings":["Etymology and definitions","Modern usage","Related concepts","See also","Notes","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/ba/Ephesians_2%2C12_-_Greek_atheos.jpg/160px-Ephesians_2%2C12_-_Greek_atheos.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d0/Atheism_template.svg/16px-Atheism_template.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/Beirut_protest.jpg/220px-Beirut_protest.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["yeshiva_college","yeshiva_university"],["civil_law","common_law"],["canon_law","catholic_church"]],"members":["civil_law","yeshiva_college","canon_law"],"related":["Latin","Religion","Sacraments","World_view","Prayer","Worship","Religious_school","Spirituality","Cultures","Secularism","Corporations","Governments","State_university_system","United_States","Christian_Church","Jewish","Baylor_University","Brigham_Young_University","Boston_College","Emory_University","University_of_Notre_Dame","Duquesne_University","Texas_Christian_University","Southern_Methodist_University","Yeshiva_College_(Yeshiva_University)","United_Kingdom","Australia","New_Zealand","Canada","Japan","Latin","Christianity","Eternity","Middle_Ages","Western_culture","Law","Police","Military","Roman_Catholic_Church","Monasticism","Regular_clergy","Secular_institute","Local_church","Synagogue","Religion","Civil_law_(common_law)","Islamic","Sharia","Catholicism","Canon_law_(Catholic_Church)","Judaism","Halakha","Sacred_music","Alcoholics_Anonymous","Religious","Nondenominational","Society","Mosque","Christian_Church","Synagogue","Temple","Religious","Beirut_Central_District","Lebanon","Secularism","Politics","Ideology","Secularism","Laïcité","Secularism","Anti-clericalism","Islam_and_secularism","Secular_state","Irreligion","Secularism","Separation_of_church_and_state","State_religion","Iain_Benson"]}
