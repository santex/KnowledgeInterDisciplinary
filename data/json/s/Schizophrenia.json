Oxford University Press, 2010. Oxford Reference Online.\n[http://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/web/Library/AboutTheLibrary.htm Maastricht\nUniversity Library]. 29 June 2010\n[http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&entry=t60.e9060\nprepaid subscription only] Common symptoms include auditory\nhallucinations, paranoid or bizarre delusions, or disorganized speech and\nthinking, and it is accompanied by significant social or occupational\ndysfunction. The onset of symptoms typically occurs in young adulthood, with a\nglobal lifetime prevalence of about 0.3â0.7%. Diagnosis is\nbased on observed behavior and the patient's reported experiences.\n\n Genetics, early environment, neurobiology, and psychological\nand social processes appear to be important contributory factors; some\nrecreational and prescription drugs appear to cause or worsen symptoms. Current\nresearch is focused on the role of neurobiology, although no single isolated\norganic cause has been found. The many possible combinations of symptoms have\ntriggered debate about whether the diagnosis represents a single disorder or a\nnumber of discrete syndromes. Despite the etymology of the term from the Greek\nroots skhizein (ÏÏÎ¯Î¶ÎµÎ¹Î½, \"to split\") and phrÄn, phren- (ÏÏÎ®Î½, ÏÏÎµÎ½-; \"mind\"),\nschizophrenia does not imply a \"split personality\", or \"multiple personality\ndisorder\" (which is known these days as dissociative identity disorder)âa\ncondition with which it is often confused in public perception.\nRather, the term means a \"splitting of mental functions\", because of the\nsymptomatic presentation of the illness.\n\n The mainstay of treatment is antipsychotic medication,\nwhich primarily suppresses dopamine (and sometimes serotonin) receptor activity.\nPsychotherapy and vocational and social rehabilitation are also important in\ntreatment. In more serious casesâwhere there is risk to self and\nothersâinvoluntary hospitalization may be necessary, although hospital stays are\nnow shorter and less frequent than they once were.\n\n The disorder is thought\nmainly to affect cognition, but it also usually contributes to chronic problems\nwith behavior and emotion. People with schizophrenia are likely to have\nadditional (comorbid) conditions, including major depression and anxiety\ndisorders; the lifetime occurrence of substance use disorder is almost 50%. Social problems, such as long-term unemployment,\npoverty, and homelessness are common. The average life expectancy of people with\nthe disorder is 12 to 15 years less than those without, the result of\nincreased physical health problems and a higher suicide rate (about 5%).
