{"cursor":"9293","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nd quartz vein(with strain fringe) showing '[[Fault (geology)|sinistral]] shear\nsense', Starlight Pit, Fortnum Gold Mine, Western Australia]] 'Shear' is the\nresponse of a rock to deformation usually by compressive stress and forms\nparticular textures. Shear can be homogeneous or non-homogeneous, and may be\npure shear or simple shear. Study of geological shear is related to the study of\nstructural geology, rock microstructure or rock texture and fault mechanics.\n\nThe process of shearing occurs within brittle, brittle-ductile, and ductile\nrocks. Within purely brittle rocks, compressive stress results in fracturing and\nsimple faulting.\n","linknr":203,"url":"Shear_(geology)","recorded":1362891792,"links":21,"instances":["geology","geology","geology","geology","geology","geology","engineering"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Structural geology","Geological processes","Geology terminology"],"headings":["Rocks","Shear zone","Mechanisms of shearing","Microstructures of shear zones","Ductile shear microstructures","Transpression","Transtension","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b1/Boudin_vein.jpg/220px-Boudin_vein.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b1/Asymmetric_shear.jpg/220px-Asymmetric_shear.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3d/PySlick.JPG/220px-PySlick.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/29/Geological_shear_r.jpg/220px-Geological_shear_r.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5a/Stretch_Conglomerate.jpg/220px-Stretch_Conglomerate.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e5/Thin_section_of_garnet-mica-schist.jpg/220px-Thin_section_of_garnet-mica-schist.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["deformation","engineering"],["foliation","geology"],["deformation","engineering"],["fold","geology"],["foliation","geology"],["fabric","geology"],["vein","geology"],["fold","geology"],["lineation","geology"],["fault","geology"],["lineation","geology"],["fault","geology"],["foliation","geology"],["fault","geology"],["fault","geology"]],"members":["lineation","vein","fold","foliation","fabric","fault","deformation"],"related":["Quartz","Western_Australia","Deformation_(engineering)","Compressive_stress","Pure_shear","Simple_shear","Structural_geology","Rock_microstructure","List_of_rock_textures","Geological_fault","Ductile","Brittle","Geological_fault","Mylonite","Cataclasite","Tectonite","Tectonite","Pseudotachylite","Breccia","Geologic_fault","Foliation_(geology)","Deformation_(engineering)","Fold_(geology)","En_echelon_veins","Ore","Orogeny","Metasomatism","American_Geological_Institute","Slickenside","Pyrite","Compressive_stress","Mylonite","Foliation_(geology)","Mica","Schist","Porphyroblast","Garnet","Garnet","Fabric_(geology)","Mica","Mylonite","Vein_(geology)","Mica_fish","Porphyroclast","Boudinage","Fold_(geology)","Subduction","Thrust_fault","Lineation_(geology)","Mylonite","Gneiss","New_Zealand","Pacific_Plate","Indo-Australian_Plate","Orogeny","Splay_fault","Nappe","Crenulation","Phyllite","Earthquake","Fault_(geology)","Lineation_(geology)","Porphyroblast","Convergent_boundary","Crenulation","Fault_(geology)","Foliation_(geology)","Rock_microstructure","Fault_(geology)","Fault_(geology)","Wayback_Machine","University_of_the_West_of_England"]}
