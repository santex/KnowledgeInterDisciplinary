{"cursor":"1496","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Sterility' is the physiological inability to effect sexual reproduction in a\nliving thing, members of whose kind have been produced sexually. The term may be\nused in reference to\n\n* types of organism, such as the mule, a sterile hybrid;\n* individual organisms; sterility indicates an absolute and permanent inability\n  to produce offspring, unlike infertility, which may be temporary or indicate\n  only a reduced level of fertility.\n* specific sexual organs; for example in some flowering plants, one or more\n  stamens may be reduced to sterile staminodes.\n\nSterility has a wide range of causes. It may be an inherited trait, as in the\nmule; or it may be acquired from the environment, for example through physical\ninjury or disease, or by exposure to radiation.\n\nEconomic uses of sterility include\n* the production of certain kinds of seedless fruit, such as seedless watermelon\n  (though sterility is not the only available route to fruit seedlessness);\n* so-called terminator technology, methods for restricting the use of\n  genetically modified plants by causing second generation seeds to be sterile;\n* the sterile insect technique, a method of biological control in which large\n  numbers of sterile insects are released, which compete with fertile insects\n  for food and mates, thus reducing the population size of subsequent\n  generations.\n","linknr":114,"url":"Sterility_(physiology)","recorded":1362674753,"links":26,"instances":["biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Infertility"],"headings":[],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/Rod_of_Asclepius2.svg/9px-Rod_of_Asclepius2.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8d/Fern.jpg/35px-Fern.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["hybrid","biology"]],"members":["hybrid"],"related":["Sexual_reproduction","Mule","Hybrid_(biology)","Infertility","Stamen","Staminode","Radiation","Seedless_fruit","Terminator_technology","Genetically_modified_plants","Sterile_insect_technique","Biological_control"]}
