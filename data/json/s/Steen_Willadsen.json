In 1984, at the\nBritish Agricultural Research Council's Institute of Animal Physiology,\nCambridge, he successfully used cells from early embryos to clone sheep by\nnuclear transfer.

The\nprocedure he developed was essentially the one used a decade later by Wilmut et\nal. to produce Dolly, the sheep, although in the latter case, nuclei from a\nmature sheep, i.e. not from sheep embryos, were used.
