It is computed from the prices of selected stocks\n(sometimes a weighted average). It is a tool used by investors and financial\nmanagers to describe the market, and to compare the return on specific\ninvestments.\n\nAn index is a mathematical construct, so it may not be invested in directly. But\nmany mutual funds and exchange-traded funds attempt to \"track\" an index (see\nindex fund), and those funds that do may not be judged against those that do.\n","linknr":395,"url":"Stock_market_index","recorded":1362551772,"links":49,"instances":["finance","economics"],"pdf":["http://www.northernfunds.com/about/news/schoenfeld_review.pdf","http://faculty.chicagogsb.edu/eugene.fama/vita/VITA.pdf"],"categories":["Stock market","Stock market indices|"],"headings":["Types of indexes","Index versions","Weighting","Criticism of capitalization-weighting","Indices and passive investment management","Ethical stock market indices","Innovations Awards to Stock Indices","Lists","See also","Notes","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/67/Comparison_of_three_stock_indices_after_1975.svg/300px-Comparison_of_three_stock_indices_after_1975.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/14/20090109_stock_index-01.jpg/220px-20090109_stock_index-01.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/12px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["portfolio","finance"],["index","economics"]],"members":["portfolio","index"],"related":["Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average","S&P_500","Dot-com_bubble","Stock_market","Stock","Weighted_average","Investor","Portfolio_(finance)","Mutual_fund","Exchange-traded_fund","Index_fund","MSCI_World","S&P_Global_100","S&P_500","Nikkei_225","Ibovespa","SENSEX","FTSE_100","Wilshire_5000","United_States","New_York_Stock_Exchange","American_Depositary_Receipt","Limited_partnership","NASDAQ","American_Stock_Exchange","Russell_Investment_Group","Wilshire_US_REIT","United_States","Real_estate_investment_trust","Morgan_Stanley_Biotech_Index","United_States","Biotechnology","Linux_Weekly_News","Linux","S&P_500","Weight_function","Dividend","S&P_500","Wilshire_4500","Wilshire_5000","Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average","Amex_Major_Market_Index","NYSE_ARCA_Tech_100_Index","Hang_Seng_Index","Index_fund","Attribute-weighted","Modern_portfolio_theory","Trend-following","Fundamentally_based_indexes","Robert_D._Arnott","Passive_management","Mutual_fund","Index_fund","Active_management","S&P_500","Churn_rate","Exchange-traded_fund","Ethical_investing","Calvert_Social_Index","Domini_400_Social_Index","FTSE4Good_Index","Dow_Jones_Sustainability_Index","Wilderhill_Clean_Energy_Index","Organisation_of_Islamic_Cooperation","Sharia","Dow_Jones_Islamic_Market_World_Index","Nortel","TSE_300_index","Mark-to-future_methods","Enron","Market_transparency","CBOE_S&P_500_BuyWrite_Index","FTSE_Group","CBOE_S&P_500_PutWrite_Index","IShares","MSCI_EAFE","CBOE","CBOE","Chicago_Board_Options_Exchange","VIX","Thomson_Reuters_Realized_Volatility_Index","Index_of_accounting_articles","Index_of_economics_articles","Index_of_management_articles","List_of_stock_exchanges","List_of_stock_market_indices","Outline_of_finance","Outline_of_marketing","Exchange-traded_fund","Index_(economics)","Index_fund","Passive_management"]}
