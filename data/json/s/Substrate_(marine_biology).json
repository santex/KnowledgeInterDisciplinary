One is:\n\n*Mud â silt and clay. *Sand â Particles between 0.06 and 2 mm in diameter.\n*Granule â Between 2 and 4 mm in diameter. *Pebble â Between 4 â 64 mm\nin diameter. *Cobble â between 6.4 and 25.6 cm in diameter *Boulder â more\nthan 25.6 cm in diameter.\n\nStream substrate can affect the life found within the stream habitat. Muddy\nstreams generally have more sediment in the water, reducing clarity. Clarity is\none guide to stream health.\n\nMarine substrate can be classified geologically as well. See Green et al., 1999\nfor a reference.\n","linknr":250,"url":"Substrate_(marine_biology)","recorded":1362477044,"links":14,"instances":["grain_size","geology","biology","geology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Aquatic ecology","Marine biology"],"headings":["See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/Estuary-mouth.jpg/140px-Estuary-mouth.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/Maldivesfish2.jpg/140px-Maldivesfish2.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["granule","geology"],["cobble","geology"],["substrate","biology"],["particle_size","grain_size"]],"members":["particle_size","cobble","substrate","granule"],"related":["Sediment","Stream","Mud","Sand","Granule_(geology)","Pebble","Cobble_(geology)","Boulder","Substrate_(biology)","Particle_size_(grain_size)"]}
