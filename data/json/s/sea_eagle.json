The two variant Greek forms lie behind the\nequally correct Latinizations haliaetus (as in Pandion haliaetus) and\nhaliaeetus.</ref> in the bird of prey family Accipitridae.\n\nSea eagles vary in size, from Sanford's Fish Eagle averaging 2–2.7&nbsp;kg to\nthe huge Steller's Sea Eagle weighing up to 9&nbsp;kg. At up to 6.9&nbsp;kg, the\nWhite-tailed Eagle is the largest eagle in Europe. Bald Eagles can weigh up to\n6.3&nbsp;kg, making them the largest eagle native to North America. The White-\nbellied Sea Eagle can weigh up to 3.4&nbsp;kg. Their diets consist mainly of\nfish and small mammals.\n\nThere are eight living species:\n* White-bellied Sea Eagle (H. leucogaster)\n* Sanford's Sea Eagle (H. sanfordi)\n* African Fish Eagle (H. vocifer)\n* Madagascar Fish Eagle (H. vociferoides)\n* Pallas's Fish Eagle(H. leucoryphus)\n* White-tailed Eagle (H. albicilla)\n* Bald Eagle (H. leucocephalus)\n* Steller's Sea Eagle (H. pelagicus)\n\nThe tails are entirely white in all adult Haliaeetus except Sanford's, white-\nbellied, and Pallas's. Three species pairs exist: white-tailed and bald eagles,\nSanford's and white-bellied sea eagles, and the African and Madagascar fish\neagles, each of these consists of a white- and a tan-headed species.\n\nHaliaeetus is possibly one of the oldest genera of living birds. A distal left\ntarsometatarsus (DPC 1652) recovered from early Oligocene deposits of Fayyum,\nEgypt (Jebel Qatrani Formation, c.33 mya) is similar in general pattern and some\ndetails to that of a modern sea eagle.<ref name=\"Rasmussen1987\">Rasmussen, D.,\nTab, O., Storrs, L., & Simons, E. L. (1987). Fossil Birds from the Oligocene\nJebel Qatrani Formation, Fayum Province, Egypt. Smithsonian Contributions to\nPaleobiology 62: 1-20. [http://www.sil.si.edu/smithsoniancontributions/Paleobiology/pdf_hi/SCtP-\n0062.pdf PDF Fulltext] (file size 8.1 MB)</ref> The genus was present in the\nmiddle Miocene (12-16 mya) with certainty.<ref name=\"Lambrecht1933\">Lambrecht,\nK. (1933). Handbuch der Palaeornithologie. Gebrüder Bornträger, Berlin.</ref>\n\nTheir closest relatives are the fishing eagles in the genus [[Ichthyophaga]],\nvery similar to the tropical Haliaeetus species. The relationships to other\ngenera in the family are less clear; they have long been considered closer to\nthe genus [[Milvus]] (kites) than to the true eagles in the genus [[Aquila\n(genus)|Aquila]] on the basis of their morphology and display behaviour,<ref\nname=\"Brown1968\">Brown, L. H, & Amadon, D. (1968). Eagles, Hawks and Falcons of\nthe World. Country Life Books, Feltham.</ref> more recent genetic evidence\nagrees with this, but points to them being related to the genus [[Buteo]]\n(buzzards) as well, a relationship not previously thought close.\n\nThe origin of the sea eagles and fishing eagles is probably in the general area\nof the Bay of Bengal. During the Eocene/Oligocene, as the Indian subcontinent\nslowly collided with Eurasia, this was a vast expanse of fairly shallow ocean;\nthe initial sea eagle divergence seems to have resulted in the four tropical\n(and Southern Hemisphere subtropical) species found around the Indian Ocean\ntoday. The Central Asian Pallas's Sea eagle's relationships to the other taxa is\nmore obscure; it seems closer to the three Holarctic species which evolved later\nand may be an early offshoot of this northward expansion; it does not have the\nhefty yellow bill of the northern forms, retaining a smaller darker beak like\nthe tropical species.\n\nThe rate of molecular evolution in Haliaeetus is fairly slow, as is to be\nexpected in long-lived birds which take years to successfully reproduce. In the\nmtDNA cytochrome ''b'' gene, a mutation rate of 0.5–0.7% per million years (if\nassuming an Early Miocene divergence) or maybe as little as 0.25–0.3% per\nmillion years (for a Late Eocene divergence) has been shown.\n\nA 2005 molecular study found that the genus is paraphyletic and subsumes\n[[Ichthyophaga]], the species diverging into a temperate and tropical group.<ref>[http://www-\npersonal.umich.edu/~hlerner/LM2005.pdf LM2005.pdf]</ref>\n",
