{"cursor":"42614","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nA 'stock market' or 'equity market' is a public entity (a loose network of\neconomic transactions, not a physical facility or discrete entity) for the\ntrading of company stock (shares) and derivatives at an agreed price; these are\nsecurities listed on a stock exchange as well as those only traded privately.\n\nThe size of the world stock market was estimated at about $36.6 trillion at\nthe beginning of October 2008. The total world derivatives market has\nbeen estimated at about $791 trillion face or nominal value, 11\ntimes the size of the entire world economy. The value of the\nderivatives market, because it is stated in terms of [[notional amount|notional\nvalues]], cannot be directly compared to a stock or a fixed income security,\nwhich traditionally refers to an actual value. Moreover, the vast majority of\nderivatives 'cancel' each other out (i.e., a derivative 'bet' on an event\noccurring is offset by a comparable derivative 'bet' on the event not\noccurring). Many such relatively illiquid securities are valued as marked to\nmodel, rather than an actual market price.\n\nThe stocks are listed and traded on stock exchanges which are entities of a\ncorporation or mutual organization specialized in the business of bringing\nbuyers and sellers of the organizations to a listing of stocks and securities\ntogether. The largest stock market in the United States, by market\ncapitalization, is the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). In Canada, the largest\nstock market is the Toronto Stock Exchange. Major European examples of stock\nexchanges include the Amsterdam Stock Exchange, London Stock Exchange, Paris\nBourse, and the Deutsche BÃ¶rse (Frankfurt Stock Exchange). In Africa, examples\ninclude Nigerian Stock Exchange, JSE Limited, etc. Asian examples include the\nSingapore Exchange, the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, the\nShanghai Stock Exchange, and the Bombay Stock Exchange. In Latin America, there\nare such exchanges as the BM&F Bovespa and the BMV. Australia has a national\nstock exchange, the Australian Securities Exchange, due to the size of its\npopulation.\n\nMarket participants include individual retail investors, institutional investors\nsuch as mutual funds, banks, insurance companies and hedge funds, and also\npublicly traded corporations trading in their own shares. Some studies have\nsuggested that institutional investors and corporations trading in their own\nshares generally receive higher risk-adjusted returns than retail investors.
