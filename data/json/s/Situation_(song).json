The song was\noriginally released in the UK as the B-side to Yazoo's debut single, \"Only You\",\nwhich went to number 2 on the UK Singles Chart. Released as a single in North\nAmerica, the song peaked at number 73 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 chart in the\nUS, and hit the top 40 in Canada, peaking at number 31. In late summer 1982 it\nbecame Yazoo's first song to top the [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] Hot\nDance Club Play chart, remaining at number one on this chart for four weeks. It\nalso crossed over to the R&B chart, peaking at number 31.\n\nThe song features a memorable synthesizer hook by Vince Clarke (similar to the\nwork he had done with his previous band, Depeche Mode), combined with the vocals\nby Alison Moyet (including her laughter, which has since been sampled in\ncountless other songs, including the international novelty dance hit\n\"Macarena\"). The song has been featured on various 1980s compilation albums as\nwell as appearing in a commercial for Classic NES Series.\n\nIts most famous version is the American 12-inch remix by FranÃ§ois Kevorkian.\nThis version was included on the U.S. version of Yazoo's album [[Upstairs at\nEric's]] and is the version of the song which receives the most radio airplay in\nthe United States (where the song, despite its modest showing on the Hot 100, is\nstill played on alternative, variety-hits and dance-oriented radio stations).\n\nIt was covered by Welsh singer Tom Jones in 1994 on his album, The Lead and How\nTo Swing It.\n\nThe song was featured in the 2002 film [[The Rules of Attraction (film)|The\nRules of Attraction]].\n\nIn 1990, and again in 1999, the song was remixed by various noted DJs, including\nPeter Rauhofer and Richard \"Humpty\" Vission. The 1999 remixes were released to\ndance clubs. In October of that same year, this renewed interest in the song\nsent \"Situation\" to number 1 on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play chart for a\nsecond time.\n\nThe song is sometimes titled \"Situation (Move Out)\" due to the words \"move out\"\nbeing repeated several times in the chorus.\n","linknr":294,"url":"Situation_(song)","recorded":1374861555,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Situation_(song)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Situation_(song)&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:YazooSituation.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/41/YazooSituation.jpg/220px-YazooSituation.jpg","/wiki/Single_(music)","/wiki/Yazoo_(band)","/wiki/Upstairs_at_Eric%27s","/wiki/A-side_and_B-side","/wiki/12%22","/wiki/7%22_single","/wiki/CD_maxi","/wiki/Music_genre","/wiki/Synthpop","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Record_label","/wiki/Mute_Records","/wiki/Sire_Records","/wiki/Songwriter","/wiki/Alison_Moyet","/wiki/Vince_Clarke","/wiki/Record_producer","/wiki/Eric_Radcliffe","/wiki/Daniel_Miller_(music_producer)","/wiki/Yazoo_(band)","/wiki/Don%27t_Go_(Yazoo_song)","/wiki/The_Other_Side_of_Love","/wiki/United_Kingdom","/wiki/Synthpop","/wiki/Yazoo_(band)","/wiki/Only_You_(Yazoo_song)","/wiki/UK_Singles_Chart","/wiki/Billboard_Hot_100","/wiki/Billboard_(magazine)","/wiki/Hot_Dance_Club_Songs","/wiki/Hot_R%26B/Hip-Hop_Songs","/wiki/Synthesizer","/wiki/Hook_(music)","/wiki/Vince_Clarke","/wiki/Depeche_Mode","/wiki/Alison_Moyet","/wiki/Sampling_(music)","/wiki/Macarena_(song)","/wiki/Classic_NES_Series","/wiki/Remix","/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Kevorkian","/wiki/Upstairs_at_Eric%27s","/wiki/Tom_Jones_(singer)","/wiki/The_Rules_of_Attraction_(film)","/wiki/Disc_jockey","/wiki/Peter_Rauhofer","/wiki/Richard_Vission","#Versions","#Sampling","#Track_listings","#1982_release","#1990_remixes","#1999_Remixes","#Charts","#Original_version","#Situation_.2791","#1999_Mixes","#External_links","#See_also","#References","/w/index.php?title=Situation_(song)&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Situation_(song)&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/The_Saturdays","/wiki/If_This_Is_Love","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Heidi_Montag","/wiki/Body_Language_(Heidi_Montag_song)","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Flying_Steps","#cite_note-4","/wiki/Charli_Baltimore","#cite_note-5","/wiki/Snoop_Dogg","/wiki/Boom_(Snoop_Dogg_song)","#cite_note-6","/w/index.php?title=Situation_(song)&action=edit&section=3","/w/index.php?title=Situation_(song)&action=edit&section=4","/w/index.php?title=Situation_(song)&action=edit&section=5","/w/index.php?title=Situation_(song)&action=edit&section=6","/w/index.php?title=Situation_(song)&action=edit&section=7","/w/index.php?title=Situation_(song)&action=edit&section=8","/wiki/Ultratop_50","#cite_note-sc_Flanders_Yazoo-7","/wiki/VRT_Top_30","#cite_note-8","/wiki/RPM_(magazine)","#cite_note-9","/wiki/Dutch_Top_40","#cite_note-sc_Dutch40_Yazoo_-_Situation-10","/wiki/Single_Top_100","#cite_note-sc_Dutch100_Yazoo-11","/wiki/Billboard_Hot_100","#cite_note-awards-12","/wiki/Hot_Dance_Club_Songs","#cite_note-awards-12","/wiki/Hot_R%26B/Hip-Hop_Songs","#cite_note-awards-12","/w/index.php?title=Situation_(song)&action=edit&section=9","/wiki/Ultratop_50","#cite_note-13","/wiki/Syndicat_National_de_l%27%C3%89dition_Phonographique","#cite_note-sc_France_Yazoo-14","/wiki/Media_Control_Charts","#cite_note-ac_Germany2_Yazoo-15","/wiki/UK_Singles_Chart","#cite_note-sc_UK_-16","/wiki/Hot_Dance_Club_Songs","#cite_note-awards-12","/wiki/Dance/Electronic_Singles_Sales","#cite_note-awards-12","/w/index.php?title=Situation_(song)&action=edit&section=10","/wiki/Hot_Dance_Club_Songs","#cite_note-awards-12","/wiki/Dance/Electronic_Singles_Sales","#cite_note-awards-12","/wiki/So_Fine_(Howard_Johnson_song)","/wiki/Howard_Johnson_(singer)","/wiki/Hot_Dance_Club_Songs","/wiki/Number-one_dance_hits_of_1982_(USA)","/wiki/Walking_on_Sunshine_(Rockers_Revenge_song)","/wiki/Rockers_Revenge","/wiki/Donnie_Calvin","/wiki/All_or_Nothing_(Cher_song)","/wiki/Cher","/wiki/Hot_Dance_Club_Songs","/wiki/Number-one_dance_hits_of_1999_(USA)","/wiki/Waiting_for_Tonight","/wiki/Jennifer_Lopez","/w/index.php?title=Situation_(song)&action=edit&section=11","http://www.discogs.com/Yazoo-Only-You/master/71383","http://www.discogs.com/Yazoo-Situation/master/71388","/w/index.php?title=Situation_(song)&action=edit&section=12","/wiki/List_of_number-one_dance_hits_(United_States)","/w/index.php?title=Situation_(song)&action=edit&section=13","#cite_ref-1","/wiki/International_Standard_Serial_Number","//www.wo
