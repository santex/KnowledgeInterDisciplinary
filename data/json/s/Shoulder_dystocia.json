It is diagnosed when the shoulders fail to deliver shortly after the\nfetal head. In shoulder dystocia, it is the chin that presses against the walls\nof the perineum. Shoulder dystocia is an obstetric emergency, and fetal demise\ncan occur if the infant is not delivered, due to compression of the umbilical\ncord within the birth canal.\n","linknr":315,"url":"Shoulder_dystocia","recorded":1362482057,"links":23,"instances":["bone","medicine"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Complications of labour and delivery"],"headings":["Signs","Procedures","Management","Risk factors","Complications","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["pubis","bone"],["etiology","medicine"]],"members":["pubis","etiology"],"related":["Dystocia","Shoulder","Infant","Pubic_symphysis","Pubic_symphysis","Perineum","Umbilical_cord","Erythematous","Pelvis","McRoberts_maneuver","Anterior_shoulder","Woods'_screw_maneuver","Jacquemier's_maneuver","Posterior_shoulder","Midwife","Ina_May_Gaskin","Zavanelli's_maneuver","Cesarean_section","Cesarean_section","Clavicular_fracture","Symphysiotomy","Pubis_(bone)","Hysterotomy","Symphysiotomy","Diabetes","Fetal_macrosomia","Maternal_obesity","Brachial_plexus_injury","Brachial_plexus","Etiology_(medicine)","Klumpke_paralysis","Erb's_Palsy","Intrauterine_hypoxia","Perinatal_mortality","Cerebral_palsy","Obstetrical_hemorrhage"]}
