The great majority of silicates are oxides, but\nhexafluorosilicate ([SiF 6] 2â ) and other anions are also\nincluded. This article focuses mainly on the Si-O anions. Silicates comprise the\nmajority of the earth's crust, as well as the other terrestrial planets, rocky\nmoons, and asteroids. Sand, Portland cement, and thousands of minerals are\nexamples of silicates.\n\nSilicate compounds, including the minerals, consist of silicate anions\nwhose charge is balanced by various cations. Myriad silicate anions can\nexist, and each can form compounds with many different cations. Hence this\nclass of compounds is very large. Both minerals and synthetic materials fit\nin this class.\n","linknr":224,"url":"Silicates","recorded":1362508719,"links":58,"instances":["materials_science","geology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Oxoanions","Silicates|"],"headings":["Structural principles","Occurrence in solution","Silicate rock and minerals","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Diatomaceous_Earth_BrightField.jpg/300px-Diatomaceous_Earth_BrightField.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["rock","geology"],["polymorphism","materials_science"]],"members":["polymorphism","rock"],"related":["Chemical_compound","Silicon","Anion","Oxide","Hexafluorosilicate","Earth's_crust","Terrestrial_planets","Moons","Asteroids","Portland_cement","Minerals","Cation","Silicate_minerals","Tetrahedron","Octet_rule","Biomineralization","Catalyst","Zeolite","Hexafluorosilicate","Octahedron","Stishovite","Silica","Lower_mantle","Meteorite","Thaumasite","Calcium_silicate_hydrate","Cement","Concrete","Sulfate_attack","Siliceous","Sedimentary_rock","Frustule","Diatoms","Silica","Polymerisation","Silicic_acid","Water","Μm","Geology","Astronomy","Rock_(geology)","Silicate_minerals","Melting","Crystallization","Fractionation","Metamorphism","Weathering","Diagenesis","Plankton","Diatom","Exoskeleton","Deep_ocean","Sediment","Silicon_dioxide","Mineral","Quartz","Polymorphism_(materials_science)","Mineralogy","Silicate_minerals","Olivine","Epidote","Melilite","Tourmaline","Pyroxene","Amphibole","Phyllosilicates","Mica","Clay","Quartz","Feldspar","Zeolite","Aluminium"]}
