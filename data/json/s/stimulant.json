Examples of these kinds of effects may include enhanced alertness,\nwakefulness, and locomotion, among others. Due to their effects typically having\nan \"up\" quality to them, stimulants are also occasionally referred to as\n\"'uppers'\". Depressants or \"downers\", which decrease mental and/or physical\nfunction, are in stark contrast to stimulants and are considered to be their\nfunctional opposites. Stimulants are widely used throughout the world as\nprescription medicines and as illicit substances of recreational use or abuse.\n",
