{"cursor":"7816","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Stock dilution' is a general term that results from the issue of additional\ncommon shares by a company. This increase in the number of shares outstanding\ncan result from a primary market offering (including an initial public\noffering), employees exercising stock options, or by conversion of convertible\nbonds, preferred shares or warrants into stock. This dilution can shift\nfundamental positions of the stock such as ownership percentage, voting control,\nearnings per share, or the value of individual shares. A broader definition\nspecifies dilution as any event that reduces an investor's stock price below the\ninitial purchase price.\n","linknr":229,"url":"Stock_dilution","recorded":1362569066,"links":20,"instances":["finance"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Stock market"],"headings":["Control dilution","Earnings dilution","Value dilution","Impact of options and warrants dilution","Share dilution scams","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["warrant","finance"]],"members":["warrant"],"related":["Shares","Shares_outstanding","Initial_public_offering","Employee_stock_options","Convertible_bond","Preferred_shares","Warrant_(finance)","Earnings_per_share","Investor","Venture_capital","Net_Income","Return_on_equity","Book_value","Death_spiral_financing","Price-to-earnings_ratio","OTC_Bulletin_Board","Pink_Sheets","Follow-on_offering","Reverse_split","Diluted_earnings_per_share","Employee_stock_options","Accretion/dilution_analysis","Share_capital"]}
