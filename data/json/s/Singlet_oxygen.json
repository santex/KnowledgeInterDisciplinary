Because of its unusual properties,\nsinglet oxygen can persist for over an hour at room temperature, depending on\nthe environment. Because of differences in their electron shells, singlet and\ntriplet oxygen differ in their chemical properties. Singlet oxygen is in the\nsame quantum state as most molecules and thus reacts readily with them, thus\nmaking singlet oxygen highly reactive.\n\nSinglet oxygen is usually generated with a photosensitizer pigment. The damaging\neffects of sunlight on many organic materials (polymers, etc.) are often\nattributed to the effects of singlet oxygen. In photodynamic therapy, singlet\noxygen is produced to kill cancer cells.\n\nThe blue color of liquid and solid O 2 is actually due to the\nsimultaneous excitation by a single photon of two O 2 molecules from\ntheir ground states to their excited states, in which the associated energy\nabsorbed corresponds to absorption of light in the red to green region of the\nvisible part of the spectrum, thus the reflected color of liquid and solid\nO 2 appears blue.\n","linknr":243,"url":"Singlet_oxygen","recorded":1362477531,"links":21,"instances":["journal"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Oxidizing agents","Physical chemistry","Oxygen"],"headings":["Production","Organic chemistry","Biochemistry","Orbital states","Chemistry","External links","Notes","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Scheme_for_preparing_singlet_oxygen_via_phosphite_ozonides.png/800px-Scheme_for_preparing_singlet_oxygen_via_phosphite_ozonides.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bb/Singlet_Oxygenation_Citronellol.svg/533px-Singlet_Oxygenation_Citronellol.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c7/Molek%C3%BClorbital-Sauerstoff.png/600px-Molek%C3%BClorbital-Sauerstoff.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["nature","journal"]],"members":["nature"],"related":["Oxygen","Triplet_oxygen","Photodynamic_therapy","Rose_bengal","Methylene_blue","Porphyrins","Chemical_Reviews","Trioxidane","Hydrogen_peroxide","Sodium_hypochlorite","Pyridine","Diels-Alder","Cycloaddition","Ene_reaction","Heteroatom","Organometallic","Allylic","Ene_reaction","Hydroperoxide","Alkyl","Allyl_alcohol","Ene_reaction","Citronellol","Hydrogen_peroxide","Sodium_molybdate","Sodium_sulfite","1,2-dioxetane","1,3-Cyclohexadiene","Cycloaddition","Trioxidane","Photosynthesis","Chlorophyll","Carotenoid","Light","Chlorophyll","Mammal","Biology","Reactive_oxygen_species","LDL","Cholesterol","Cardiovascular","Polyphenol_antioxidant","Photosensitivity","Photosensitivity_in_animals","Photodynamic_therapy","Molecular_orbital_theory","Singlet_state","Molecular_term_symbol","Antibonding","Degenerate_energy_level","Excited_state","Oxygen","Antibonding","Infrared","Selection_rules","Phosphorescence","Fluorescence","Robert_S._Mulliken","Nature_(journal)"]}
