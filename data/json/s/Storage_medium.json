The magnetic tape is a data storage medium. The\nrecorder is data storage equipment using a portable medium (tape reel) to store\nthe data.]]\n\n might be the oldest data storage medium. ]] A 'data storage device'\n is a device for recording (storing) information (data). Recording can be done\n using virtually any form of energy, spanning from manual muscle power in\n handwriting, to acoustic vibrations in phonographic recording, to\n electromagnetic energy modulating magnetic tape and optical discs.\n\nA storage device may hold information, process information, or both. A device\nthat only holds information is a recording medium. Devices that process\ninformation (data storage equipment) may either access a separate portable\n(removable) recording medium or a permanent component to store and retrieve\ninformation.\n\nElectronic data storage requires electrical power to store and retrieve that\ndata. Most storage devices that do not require vision and a brain to read data\nfall into this category. Electromagnetic data may be stored in either an analog\nor digital format on a variety of media. This type of data is considered to be\nelectronically encoded data, whether or not it is electronically stored in a\nsemiconductor device, for it is certain that a semiconductor device was used to\nrecord it on its medium. Most electronically processed data storage media\n(including some forms of computer data storage) are considered permanent (non-\nvolatile) storage, that is, the data will remain stored when power is removed\nfrom the device. In contrast, most electronically stored information within most\ntypes of semiconductor (computer chips) microcircuits are volatile memory, for\nit vanishes if power is removed.\n\nWith the exception of barcodes and OCR data, electronic data storage is easier\nto revise and may be more cost effective than alternative methods due to smaller\nphysical space requirements and the ease of replacing (rewriting) data on the\nsame medium. However, the durability of methods such as printed data is still\nsuperior to that of most electronic storage media. The durability limitations\nmay be overcome with the ease of duplicating (backing-up) electronic data.\n","linknr":538,"url":"Storage_medium","recorded":1362580054,"links":60,"instances":["projection","tape","metal","film","process","electronics","geometry","journal","arts","communication","geology"],"pdf":["http://www.emc.com/collateral/analyst-reports/diverse-exploding-digital-universe.pdf","http://www.emc.com/collateral/analyst-reports/diverse-exploding-digital-universe.pdf"],"categories":["Communication","Data
