Academic publishing\nis the process of placing the results of one's research into the literature.\nOriginal scientific research published for the first time in scientific journals\nis called the primary literature. Patents and technical reports, for minor\nresearch results and engineering and design work (including computer software),\ncan also be considered primary literature. Secondary sources include review\narticles (which summarize the findings of published studies to highlight\nadvances and new lines of research) and books (for large projects or broad\narguments, including compilations of articles). Tertiary sources might include\nencyclopedias and similar works intended for broad public consumption.\n","recorded":1362124341,"portal":[],"list":[],"links":"210","instances":["academic_document","books","summary","publishing"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Academic literature|","Technical communication","Information science","Scientific works| Literature"],"headings":["Types of scientific publications","Preparation of an article","Clear communication and impact factor","Structure of a scientific paper","Peer review","Controversies","Footnotes","See also"],"tags":[["chapter","books"],["abstract","summary"],["open_access","publishing"],["chapter","books"],["abstract","summary"],["open_access","publishing"],["thesis","academic_document"],["chapter","books"],["abstract","summary"]],"image":["http://en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b1/Ambox_outdated_content.svg/42px-Ambox_outdated_content.svg.png","http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","http://bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","http://bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"related":["Publication","Empirical_evidence","Theoretical","Natural_science","Social_science","Academic_publishing","Research","Science","Research","Scientific_journal","Primary_literature","Technical_report","Secondary_source","Book","Tertiary_source","Encyclopedia","Scientific_journal","Patent","Biological_patent","Chemical_patent","Book","Author","Edited_volume","Chapter_(books)","Editing","Academic_conference","Learned_society","Government","Forensic_investigation","NTSB","World_Wide_Web","Technical_report","Pamphlet","Working_paper","Blogs","Research_monograph","Conference_proceeding","Applied_sciences","Preprint","Mathematics","High_energy_physics","Preprint","Scientific_writing","Scientific_misconduct","Abstract_(summary)","Subject_metadata","Image","Chart","Schematic","Diagram","Drawing","Appeal_to_authority","Rhetoric","Faith","Peer_review","Quality_control","Technical_report","Abstracting_service","Chemical_Abstracts_Service","Institute_for_Scientific_Information","Printing","Paper","Forensic_science","Copyright","Facsimile","Reproduction","Academic_publishing","Acknowledgment_index","Citation_index","IMRAD","Open_access_(publishing)","Grey_literature","UKSG_E-Resources_Management_Handbook"],"members":["thesis","chapter","abstract","open_access"],"book":[]}
