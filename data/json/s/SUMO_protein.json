{"cursor":"15965","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'S'mall 'U'biquitin-like 'Mo'difier (or 'SUMO') proteins are a family of small\nproteins that are covalently attached to and detached from other proteins in\ncells to modify their function. SUMOylation is a post-translational modification\ninvolved in various cellular processes, such as nuclear-cytosolic transport,\ntranscriptional regulation, apoptosis, protein stability, response to stress,\nand progression through the cell cycle.\n\nSUMO proteins are similar to ubiquitin, and SUMOylation is directed by an\nenzymatic cascade analogous to that involved in ubiquitination. In contrast to\nubiquitin, SUMO is not used to tag proteins for degradation. Mature SUMO is\nproduced when the last four amino acids of the C-terminus have been cleaved off\nto allow formation of an isopeptide bond between the C-terminal glycine residue\nof SUMO and an acceptor lysine on the target protein.\n\nSUMO family members often have dissimilar names; the SUMO homologue in yeast,\nfor example, is called SMT3 (suppressor of mif two 3). Several pseudogenes have\nbeen reported for this gene.\n","linknr":570,"url":"SUMO_protein","recorded":1362481123,"links":27,"instances":["biochemistry","genetics","biology"],"pdf":["http://www.lifesensors.com/pdf/2011_PeroutkaRJ_MethMolBiol_SUMO_fusion_technology_for_enhanced_protein_expression_and_purification_in_prokaryotes_and_eukaryotes.pdf","http://www.lifesensors.com/pdf/SUMOs_Table.pdf"],"categories":["Posttranslational modification","Proteins"],"headings":["Function","Structure","Prediction of SUMO attachment","SUMO Attachment","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/79/HSUMO1_1A5R_nmr_ribbons.png/300px-HSUMO1_1A5R_nmr_ribbons.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/HSUMO1_1A5R_nmr_spheres.png/300px-HSUMO1_1A5R_nmr_spheres.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cell","biology"],["transcription","genetics"],["transcription","genetics"],["substrate","biochemistry"]],"members":["substrate","transcription","cell"],"related":["Proteins","Covalent_bond","Cell_(biology)","Post-translational_modification","Cell_nucleus","Cytosol","Transcription_(genetics)","Apoptosis","Cell_cycle","Ubiquitin","Proteolysis","Yeast","Pseudogenes","Cell_nucleus","Cytosol","Transcription_(genetics)","RANGAP1","Centrosome","Cell_nucleus","Isoform","SUMO1","SUMO2","SUMO3","Pseudogene","Amino_acids","KDa","Mass","Organism","Alpha_helix","Beta_sheet","NMR","Short_linear_motif","Hydrophobic","Lysine","Substrate_(biochemistry)","Hydrophobicity","Random_forest","Support_vector_machine","Position-specific_scoring_matrix","HECT_domain","Ubiquitin","Prokaryotic_ubiquitin-like_protein"]}
