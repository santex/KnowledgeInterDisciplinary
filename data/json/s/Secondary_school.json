{"cursor":"18212","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n Secondary School in Kecskemet, Hungary]] 'Secondary school' is an\neducational institution where the second stage of the three schooling periods,\nknown as secondary education and usually compulsory up to a specified age takes\nplace. It follows elementary or primary education, and is sometimes followed by\nuniversity (tertiary) education. The term high school is used particularly in\nNorth America and North Western England though the two types of school are far\nfrom synonymous.\n\nThere are very many different types of secondary school, and the language used\nvaries around the world. Children usually go to secondary school between the\nages of 11 and 16 years, and end between the ages of 16 and 18 years, although\nthere is considerable variation from country to country.\n\nThe following descriptions and definitions pertain to state-funded education\nunless otherwise stated.\n","linknr":477,"url":"Secondary_school","recorded":1362478018,"links":45,"instances":["ireland","scotland_act_1980","disambiguation","school","school","english_school"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Secondary
