Status attainment\nis affected by both achieved factors, such as educational attainment, and\nascribed factors, such as family income. It is achieved by a combination of\nparent's status, one's own efforts and abilities. The idea behind status\nattainment is that one can be mobile, either upwardly or downwardly, in the\nform of a class system.\n\nIn education context, status attainment assumes that social status of parent\naffects educational level achieved by children, which in turn affects\noccupational level and social status. Thus, level of schooling would affect\n(moderate) the degree of intergenerational transmission of social\nstatus.
