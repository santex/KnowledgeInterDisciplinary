Deterrence is often contrasted with retributivism, which holds that\npunishment is a necessary consequence of a crime and should be calculated based\non the gravity of the wrong done.\n\nThe concept of deterrence has two key assumptions: the first is that specific\npunishments imposed on offenders will \"deter\" or prevent them from committing\nfurther crimes; the second is that fear of punishment will prevent others from\ncommitting similar crimes. The notion of deterrence underlines the\ncriminal justice systems in most democratic societies, although punishment and\nincarceration traditionally have a variety of goals â including incapacitation,\npunishment, deterrence and rehabilitation. In the United States in particular\n(but also in other Western democracies), sentencing policy initiatives have\noften been enacted with the goal of enhancing the deterrent effect. Under the\nrubric of \"getting tough on crime\", policies such as \"mandatory minimums\",\n\"truth in sentencing\", and \"three strikes and youâre out\" have been designed to\ndeter offending with the threat of substantial terms of imprisonment.\n","linknr":178,"url":"Specific_deterrence","recorded":1362375060,"links":22,"instances":["law","criminology","penology","legal"],"pdf":["http://www.sentencingproject.org/doc/Deterrence%20Briefing%20.pdf","http://www.sentencingproject.org/doc/Deterrence%20Briefing%20.pdf","http://law.harvard.edu/faculty/shavell/pdf/12_Inter_Rev_Law_Econ_345.pdf","http://www.prisonpolicy.org/scans/gendreau.pdf"],"categories":["Criminology","Penology","Criminal law"],"headings":["Categories","Effectiveness","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6e/Pentonvilleiso19.jpg/180px-Pentonvilleiso19.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["sentence","law"],["rational_choice_theory","criminology"],["rehabilitation","penology"],["deterrence","legal"]],"members":["sentence","rational_choice_theory","rehabilitation","deterrence"],"related":["Punishment","Retributivism","Sentence_(law)","Rational_choice_theory_(criminology)","Cesare,_Marquis_of_Beccaria","Dei_delitti_e_delle_pene","Torture","Death_penalty","Jeremy_Bentham","Capital_punishment","Rehabilitation_(penology)","Theory_of_criminal_justice","Crime","Punishment","Deterrence_(legal)","Rational_choice"]}
