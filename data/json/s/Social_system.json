The term draws\na line to ecosystem, biological organisms, psychical systems and technical\nsystems. They all form the environment of social systems. Minimum requirements\nfor a social system is interaction of at least two personal systems or two\npersons acting in their roles. The first who formulated a systematic theory of\nsocial systems was Talcott Parsons where it was a part of his AGIL paradigm yet\nthe social system is only a segment (or a \"subsystem\") of what Parsons calls\naction theory; however, Vilfredo Pareto had used the term, \"social system,\"\nearlier but only as a sketch and not as an overall analytical scheme in the\nsense of Parsons.\n\nJay Wright Forrester describes three counterintuitive behaviours as important:\ncauses from symptoms are often far removed in time and space, identifying\nleverage points, conflicting short + long-term consequences.
