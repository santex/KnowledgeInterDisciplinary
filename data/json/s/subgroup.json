The 'trivial subgroup' of any group is the subgroup {e} consisting\nof just the identity element. If H is a subgroup of G, then G is sometimes\ncalled an overgroup of H.\n\nThe same definitions apply more generally when G is an arbitrary semigroup, but\nthis article will only deal with subgroups of groups. The group G is sometimes\ndenoted by the ordered pair (G,*), usually to emphasize the operation * when G\ncarries multiple algebraic or other structures.\n\nThis article will write ab for a*b, as is usual.\n","title":"subgroup","headings":["Basic properties of subgroups","Cosets and Lagrange's theorem","Example: Subgroups of Z<sub>8</sub>","Example: Subgroups of S<sub>4</sub>","See also","Notes","References"]},"micro-relation":["2: Subset","2: If_and_only_if","2: Lattice_of_subgroups","2: Partial_order","2: Cyclic_group","1: Binary_operation","1: Semigroup","1: Homomorphism","1: Identity_element","1: Inverse_element","1: Generating_set_of_a_group","1: Group_isomorphism","1: Complete_lattice","1: Infimum","1: Supremum","1: Additive_group","1: Bijection","1: Equivalence_relation","1: Index_of_a_subgroup","1: Divisor","1: Normal_subgroup","1: List_of_small_groups","1: Modular_arithmetic","1: Cayley_table","1: Permutation","1: Dihedral_group_of_order_8","1: Cartan_subgroup","1: Fitting_subgroup","1: Stable_subgroup"]}
