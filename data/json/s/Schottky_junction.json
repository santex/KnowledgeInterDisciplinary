{"cursor":"4552","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'Schottky barrier', named after Walter H. Schottky, is a potential barrier\nformed at a metalâsemiconductor junction which has rectifying characteristics,\nsuitable for use as a diode. The largest differences between a Schottky barrier\nand a pân junction are its typically lower junction voltage, and decreased\n(almost nonexistent) depletion width in the metal.\n\nNot all metalâsemiconductor junctions form Schottky barriers. A\nmetalâsemiconductor junction that does not rectify current is called an ohmic\ncontact. Rectifying properties depend on the metal's work function, the band gap\nof the intrinsic semiconductor, the type and concentration of dopants in the\nsemiconductor, and other factors. Design of semiconductor devices requires\nfamiliarity with the Schottky effect to ensure Schottky barriers are not created\naccidentally where an ohmic connection is desired.\n","linknr":132,"url":"Schottky_junction","recorded":1362538822,"links":17,"instances":["semiconductor"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Semiconductor structures"],"headings":["Advantages","Devices","See also","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/45/Schottky-Transistor-Symbol.svg/220px-Schottky-Transistor-Symbol.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/99/Schottky-Transistor-ersatz.svg/220px-Schottky-Transistor-ersatz.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["fabrication","semiconductor"]],"members":["fabrication"],"related":["Walter_H._Schottky","Metal–semiconductor_junction","Diode","P–n_junction","Junction_voltage","Depletion_width","Ohmic_contact","Work_function","Band_gap","Concentration","Dopant","Schottky_effect","Transistor","Fabrication_(semiconductor)","Schottky_diode","Bipolar_junction_transistor","Schottky_transistor","Transistor-transistor_logic","Electric_power","MESFET","Field_effect_transistor","JFET","HEMT","Heterojunction","Depletion_region","Depletion_region","Capacitance","Depletion_region","Dielectric","Depletion_width","Reverse_bias","Crystallographic_defects","Dislocations","DLTS","CV_profiling","CNTFET","Ohmic_contact","Schottky_diode","Diode","Metal-induced_gap_states","Memristor"]}
