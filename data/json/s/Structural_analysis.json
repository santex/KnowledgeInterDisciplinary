Structures subject to this type of analysis\ninclude all that must withstand loads, such as buildings, bridges, vehicles,\nmachinery, furniture, attire, soil strata, prostheses and biological tissue.\nStructural analysis incorporates the fields of applied mechanics, materials\nscience and applied mathematics to compute a structure's deformations, internal\nforces, stresses, support reactions, accelerations, and stability. The results\nof the analysis are used to verify a structure's fitness for use, often saving\nphysical tests. Structural analysis is thus a key part of the engineering design\nof structures.\n","linknr":222,"url":"Structural_analysis","recorded":1362371500,"links":34,"instances":["physics","structure","mechanics","mathematics","vector","engineering"],"pdf":["http://www.colorado.edu/engineering/CAS/Felippa.d/FelippaHome.d/Publications.d/Report.CU-CAS-00-13.pdf"],"categories":["Structural analysis|*"],"headings":["Structures and Loads","Analytical methods","Limitations","Strength of materials methods (classical methods)","Elasticity methods","Methods using numerical approximation","Timeline","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3c/Truss_Structure_Analysis%2C_Full_Figure2.jpg/638px-Truss_Structure_Analysis%2C_Full_Figure2.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/12/Truss_Structure_Analysis%2C_FBD2.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7c/Truss_Structure_Analysis%2C_Equation_Set_1.tiff/lossless-page1-600px-Truss_Structure_Analysis%2C_Equation_Set_1.tiff.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/Truss_Structure_Analysis%2C_Method_of_Joints2.png/350px-Truss_Structure_Analysis%2C_Method_of_Joints2.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cc/Truss_Structure_Analysis%2C_Equation_Set_2.tiff/lossless-page1-450px-Truss_Structure_Analysis%2C_Equation_Set_2.tiff.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7c/Truss_Structure_Analysis%2C_Equation_Set_3.tiff/lossless-page1-600px-Truss_Structure_Analysis%2C_Equation_Set_3.tiff.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/62/Truss_Structure_Analysis%2C_Method_of_Sections_Left2.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/84/Truss_Structure_Analysis%2C_Equation_Set_4.tiff/lossless-page1-400px-Truss_Structure_Analysis%2C_Equation_Set_4.tiff.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6c/Truss_Structure_Analysis%2C_Method_of_Sections_Right2.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e1/Truss_Structure_Analysis%2C_Equation_Set_5.tiff/lossless-page1-450px-Truss_Structure_Analysis%2C_Equation_Set_5.tiff.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Wikibooks-logo-en-noslogan.svg/40px-Wikibooks-logo-en-noslogan.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/Wikiversity-logo.svg/40px-Wikiversity-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["deformation","engineering"],["stress","physics"],["displacement","vector"],["compatibility","mechanics"],["beam","structure"],["deformation","engineering"],["matrix","mathematics"]],"members":["stress","beam","compatibility","matrix","displacement","deformation"],"related":["Structural_load","Structure","Applied_mechanics","Materials_science","Applied_mathematics","Deformation_(engineering)","Force","Stress_analysis","Structural_stability","Physical_test","Structural_engineering","Structure","Civil_Engineering","Engineering","Nonbuilding_structure","Building_codes","Structural_load","List_of_structural_elements","Stress_(physics)","Displacement_(vector)","Dynamic_response","Buckling","Non-linear","Strength_of_materials","3-D_elasticity","Continuum_mechanics","Finite_element","Mechanical_equilibrium","Constitutive_equation","Compatibility_(mechanics)","Beam_(structure)","Pure_bending","Superposition_principle","Truss","Moment_distribution_method","Deformation_(engineering)","Linear_elasticity","Finite_Element_Method","Matrix_(mathematics)","Partial_differential_equation","Finite_element_method_in_structural_mechanics","Pressure_vessel","Stiffness_method","Flexibility_method","Leonardo_da_Vinci","Galileo_Galilei","Two_New_Sciences","Hooke's_law","Robert_Hooke","Isaac_Newton","Philosophiae_Naturalis_Principia_Mathematica","Newton's_laws_of_motion","Eulerâ€“Bernoulli_beam_equation","Daniel_Bernoulli","Virtual_work","Leonhard_Euler","Buckling","Claude-Louis_Navier","Carlo_Alberto_Castigliano","Castigliano's_method","Hardy_Cross","Alexander_Hrennikoff","Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology","Richard_Courant","Ray_W._Clough"]}
