As occurs in other autoimmune diseases, the immune\nsystem attacks the body's cells and tissue, resulting in inflammation and tissue\ndamage. James, William; Berger, Timothy; Elston, Dirk (2005).\nAndrews' Diseases of the Skin: Clinical Dermatology. (10th ed.). Saunders. ISBN\n0-7216-2921-0. It is a Type III hypersensitivity reaction in which antibody-\nimmune complexes precipitate and cause a further immune response.\n\nSLE most often harms the heart, joints, skin, lungs, blood vessels, liver,\nkidneys, and nervous system. The course of the disease is unpredictable, with\nperiods of illness (called flares) alternating with remissions. The disease\noccurs nine times more often in women than in men, especially in women in child-\nbearing years ages 15 to 35, and is also more common in those of non-European\ndescent.\n\nThere is no cure for SLE. It is treated with immunosuppression, mainly with\ncyclophosphamide, corticosteroids and other immunosuppressants. SLE can be\nfatal. Survival for people with SLE in the United States, Canada, and Europe has\nrisen to approximately 95% at five years, 90% at 10 years, and 78% at 20\nyears, and now approaches that of matched\ncontrols without lupus.\n\nChildhood systemic lupus erythematosus generally presents between the ages of 3\nand 15, with girls outnumbering boys 4:1, and typical skin manifestations being\nbutterfly eruption on the face and photosensitivity.\n\nLupus is Latin for wolf. In the 18th century, when lupus was just starting to be\nrecognized as a disease, it was thought that it was caused by the bite of a\nwolf. This may have been because of the\ndistinctive rash characteristic of lupus. (Once full-blown, the round, disk-\nshaped rashes heal from the inside out, leaving a bite-like imprint.)\n","linknr":1770,"url":"Systemic_lupus_erythematosus","recorded":1362503090,"links":70,"instances":["disease","mood","epidemiology","medicine","medicine","tests","medicine","genetics","element","human","physician","tests","medical","skin"],"pdf":["http://content.karger.com/produktedb/produkte.asp?doi=10.1159/000090781&typ=pdf","http://content.karger.com/produktedb/produkte.asp?doi=10.1159/000090781&typ=pdf"],"categories":["Autoimmune
