The filly was born in 1952 at Claiborne Farm\nnear Paris, Kentucky where the Wheatley Stable (founded in 1926 by Gladys Mills\nPhipps and her brother, Ogden L. Mills) bred and raised its horses. After the\nSecond World War, Gladys's son Ogden Phipps purchased a number of horses from\nthe estate of Colonel Edward R. Bradley and his Idle Hour Stock Farm. Among them\nwas the good racing mare Big Hurry.\n\nPhipps bred Big Hurry (the racing daughter of Bradleyâs favorite stallion, Black\nToney, out of Bradleyâs legendary broodmare La Troienne), to the fourth winner\nof the U.S. Triple Crown Champion, War Admiral. From this match came a bay filly\nhe named Searching. But after she raced poorly in her first 20 starts under Hall\nof Fame trainer Sunny Jim Fitzsimmons, Phipps sold her to Ethel Jacobs, the wife\nof another Hall of Fame trainer, Hirsch Jacobs. Under Hirsch, Searching improved\nimmensely. In her next 69 starts, many of them important stakes, she was in the\nmoney most of the time.\n\nAs a broodmare, Searching produced eight foals, seven of them winners, and three\nstakes winners, including Admiring and Priceless Gem. But the filly she is\nremembered for is Affectionately, #81 - Top 100 U.S. Racehorses of the 20th\nCentury. Affectionately produced Personality.\n\nSearching was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1978, five years after\nher death.\n","linknr":131,"url":"Searching_(horse)","recorded":1362554238,"links":12,"instances":["horse"],"pdf":[],"categories":["1952 racehorse births","1973 racehorse deaths","Thoroughbred racehorses","American racehorses","Racehorses bred in Kentucky","Individual mares","United States Thoroughbred Racing Hall of Fame inductees"],"headings":["External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["bay","horse"]],"members":["bay"],"related":["War_Admiral","Man_o'_War","Big_Hurry","Black_Toney","Filly","United_States","Bay_(horse)","Ogden_Phipps","Ethel_D._Jacobs","James_E._Fitzsimmons","Hirsch_Jacobs","Vagrancy_Handicap","Gallorette_Handicap","Diana_Handicap","Go_For_Wand_Handicap","Top_Flight_Handicap","Correction_Handicap","Distaff_Breeders'_Cup_Handicap","Molly_Pitcher_Stakes","Matriarch_Stakes","National_Museum_of_Racing_and_Hall_of_Fame","Racehorse","Filly","Claiborne_Farm","Paris,_Kentucky","Wheatley_Stable","Gladys_Mills_Phipps","Ogden_L._Mills","Second_World_War","Ogden_Phipps","Edward_R._Bradley","Idle_Hour_Stock_Farm","Black_Toney","Broodmare","La_Troienne","War_Admiral","Sunny_Jim_Fitzsimmons","Ethel_D._Jacobs","Hirsch_Jacobs","Graded_stakes_race","Broodmare","Affectionately","Blood-Horse_magazine_List_of_the_Top_100_U.S._Racehorses_of_the_20th_Century","National_Museum_of_Racing_and_Hall_of_Fame"]}
