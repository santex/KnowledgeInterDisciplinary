{"cursor":"7885","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nA 'selective school' is a school that admits students on the basis of some sort\nof selection criteria, usually academic. The term may have different\nconnotations in different systems. The opposite is a comprehensive school, which\naccepts all students, regardless of aptitude. The split between selective and\ncomprehensive education is mainly seen at secondary level; primary education is\nrarely selective. At the university level, selection is almost universal, though\nsome institutions practice open admissions or open-door enrollment allowing\nstudents to attend regardless of prior qualification.\n","linknr":174,"url":"Selective_school","recorded":1363129507,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Selective_school&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Selective_school&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Selective_school&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Template:Citation_needed","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/Comprehensive_school","/wiki/Secondary_education","/wiki/Primary_education","/wiki/Open_admissions","/wiki/Open-door_enrollment","#Australia","#New_South_Wales","#Victoria","#Queensland","#Western_Australia","#United_Kingdom","#United_States","#Germany","#See_also","#References","/w/index.php?title=Selective_school&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Selective_school&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Selective_school_(New_South_Wales)","/wiki/New_South_Wales","/wiki/Selective_school_(New_South_Wales)","/wiki/Selective_High_Schools_Test","#cite_note-1","/w/index.php?title=Selective_school&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/Victoria_(Australia)","/wiki/Australia","/wiki/Melbourne_High_School_(Victoria)","/wiki/Mac.Robertson_Girls%27_High_School","/wiki/Victorian_College_of_the_Arts_Secondary_School","/wiki/John_Monash_Science_School","/wiki/Nossal_High_School","/wiki/Suzanne_Cory_High_School","#cite_note-2","/w/index.php?title=Selective_school&action=edit&section=4","/wiki/Queensland","/wiki/Premier_of_Queensland","/wiki/Peter_Beattie","#cite_note-3","/wiki/International_Baccalaureate_Diploma_Program","/wiki/Queensland_Academy_for_Science,_Mathematics_and_Technology","/wiki/University_of_Queensland","/wiki/Queensland_Academy_for_Creative_Industries","/wiki/Queensland_University_of_Technology","/wiki/Queensland_Academy_for_Health_Sciences","/w/index.php?title=Selective_school&action=edit&section=5","/wiki/Perth_Modern_School","/wiki/Perth_Modern_School","/wiki/Perth_Modern_School","/wiki/Shenton_College","/w/index.php?title=Selective_school&action=edit&section=6","/wiki/Comprehensive_school","/wiki/Grammar_schools_in_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/England","/wiki/Eleven_plus_exam","/wiki/Grant_Maintained","/wiki/The_John_Fisher_School","/wiki/The_London_Oratory_School","/wiki/Bexley","/wiki/Bournemouth","/wiki/Buckinghamshire","/wiki/Kent","/wiki/Royal_Borough_of_Kingston_upon_Thames","/wiki/Lincolnshire","/wiki/Medway","/wiki/Poole","/wiki/Reading,_Berkshire","/wiki/Slough","/wiki/Southend","/wiki/London_Borough_of_Sutton","/wiki/Torbay","/wiki/Trafford","/wiki/Metropolitan_Borough_of_Wirral","/wiki/Partially_selective_school_(England)","/wiki/Northern_Ireland","/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom","/w/index.php?title=Selective_school&action=edit&section=7","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/High_school","/wiki/Specialized_school","/wiki/New_York","/wiki/Specialized_High_Schools_Admissions_Test","/wiki/High_school","/wiki/Logan_School_for_Creative_Learning","/wiki/Colorado","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/w/index.php?title=Selective_school&action=edit&section=8","/wiki/Education_in_Germany","/wiki/Gymnasium_(Germany)","/wiki/Realschule","/wiki/Realschule#The_.22Advanced_Realschule.22_and_.22Realschule_Plus.22","/w/index.php?title=Selective_school&action=edit&section=9","/wiki/Magnet_school","/w/index.php?title=Selective_school&action=edit&section=10","#cite_ref-1","http://www.schools.nsw.edu.au/learning/k-6assessments/shsplacement/index.php","#cite_ref-2","http://www.education.vic.gov.au/aboutschool/enrolling/selectentry/default.htm","#cite_ref-3","http://www.qldacademies.eq.edu.au/history/index.html","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Selective_school&oldid=527070154","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:University_and_college_admissions","/wiki/Category:School_types","/wiki/Category:Articles_needing_additional_references_from_December_2009","/wiki/Category:All_articles_needing_additional_references","/wiki/Category:All_articles_with_unsourced_statements","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_unsourced_statements_from_July_2012","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Selective+school&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Spe
