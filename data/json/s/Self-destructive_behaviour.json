{"cursor":"4220","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nIn human context, 'self-destructive behaviour' is a widely used phrase that\nconceptualises certain kinds of destructive acts as belonging to the self. It\nalso has the property that it characterises certain kinds of self-inflicted acts\nas . The term comes from objective psychology, wherein all apparent self-\ninflicted harm or abuse toward oneself is treated as a collection of actions,\nand therefore as a pattern of behaviour.\n\nActs of \"self-destruction\" may be merely metaphorical (\"social suicide\") or\nliteral (suicide).  Generally speaking, self-destructive actions\nmay be deliberate, born of impulse, or developed as a habit. The term however\ntends to be applied toward self-destructions that are potentially habit-forming\nor addictive, and are thus potentially fatal.\n* Suicide\n* Self-harm\n* Eating disorders\n* Substance abuse\n","linknr":121,"url":"Self-destructive_behaviour","recorded":1362674992,"links":33,"instances":["psychology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Abnormal psychology","Abuse"],"headings":["Forms","Causes","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["habit","psychology"]],"members":["habit"],"related":["Human","Self","Psychology","Harm","Abuse","Self","Behaviour","Social_suicide","Suicide","Habit_(psychology)","Behavioral_addiction","Death","Suicide","Self-harm","Eating_disorder","Substance_abuse","Coping_mechanism","Self-punishment","Self-hatred","Attention_seeking","Clinical_depression","Attention_seeking","Emotional_self-regulation","Self-defeating_personality_disorder"]}
