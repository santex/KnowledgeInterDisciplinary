{"cursor":"82742","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n, a distributed computing project in which volunteers donate idle computer power\nto analyze radio signals for signs of extraterrestrial intelligence]]\n\nThe 'search for extraterrestrial intelligence' ('SETI') is the collective name\nfor a number of activities undertaken to search for intelligent extraterrestrial\nlife. SETI projects use scientific methods in this search. For example,\nelectromagnetic radiation is monitored for signs of transmissions from\ncivilizations on other worlds. Some\nof the most well known projects are run by Harvard University, the University of\nCalifornia, Berkeley, and the SETI Institute. Since the United States government\nwithdrew funding for SETI projects in 1995, projects have been primarily funded\nby private sources.\n\nThere are great challenges in searching the cosmos for signs of intelligent\nlife, including their identification and interpretation. SETI projects\nnecessarily make assumptions to narrow the search, the foremost being that\nelectromagnetic radiation would be a medium of communication for advanced\nextraterrestrial life.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"SETI","recorded":1372155189,"links":[],"instances":["radio","professor","antenna","planets","astrophysicist","seti","citizen_science_project","science_fiction","paleontologist","signal_processing","computing","astronomy"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Extraterrestrial
