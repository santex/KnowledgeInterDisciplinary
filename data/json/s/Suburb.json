Some suburbs have a\ndegree of administrative autonomy, and most have lower population densities than\ninner city neighborhoods. Suburbs first emerged on a large scale in the 19th and\n20th centuries as a result of improved rail and road transport, which led to an\nincrease in commuting. Suburbs tend to proliferate around cities that have an\nabundance of adjacent flat\nland.

Any particular suburban\narea is referred to as a suburb, while suburban areas on the whole are referred\nto as the suburbs or suburbia, with the demonym for a suburb-dweller being\nsuburbanite.
