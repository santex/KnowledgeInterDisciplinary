It was founded in 2002 by former\nPayPal entrepreneur Elon Musk. It has developed the Falcon 1 and Falcon 9 launch\nvehicles, both of which were designed from conception to eventually become\nreusable. SpaceX also developed the Dragon spacecraft to be flown into orbit by\nthe Falcon 9 launch vehicle, initially transporting cargo and later planned to\ncarry humans. On 25 May 2012, SpaceX made history as the world's first privately\nheld company to send a cargo payload, carried on the Dragon spacecraft, to the\nInternational Space Station.\n\nIn order to control quality and costs, SpaceX designs, tests and fabricates the\nmajority of its components in-house, including the Merlin, Kestrel, and Draco\nrocket engines used on the Falcon launch vehicles and the Dragon spacecraft. In\n2006, NASA awarded the company a Commercial Orbital Transportation Services\n(COTS) contract to design and demonstrate a launch system to resupply cargo to\nthe International Space Station (ISS). On 9 December 2010, the launch of the\nCOTS Demo Flight 1 mission, SpaceX became the first privately funded company to\nsuccessfully launch, orbit and recover a spacecraft. On 22 May 2012, SpaceX's\nFalcon 9 rocket carried the unmanned Dragon capsule into space, marking the\nfirst time a private company has sent a spacecraft to the space station. The\nunmanned, cone-shaped capsule became the first privately built and operated\nvehicle to ever dock with the orbiting outpost.\n\nNASA has also awarded SpaceX a contract to develop and demonstrate a human-rated\nDragon as part of its Commercial Crew Development (CCDev) program to transport\ncrew to the ISS. SpaceX is planning its first crewed Dragon/Falcon9 flight in\n2015, when it expects to have a fully certified, human-rated launch escape\nsystem incorporated into the spacecraft.\n\nBesides NASA contracts, SpaceX has signed contracts with private sector\ncompanies, non-American government agencies and the American military for its\nlaunch services. It has already launched, for a paying customer, a low earth\norbiting satellite with its Falcon 1 booster in 2009. The\ncompany plans to launch its first commercial geostationary satellite in 2013\nfrom a Falcon 9.\n\nFuture projects that are in the planning stages or in development include the\nFalcon Heavy launch system, as well as a NASA robotic mission to Mars in 2018.\nThe Heavy is based on Falcon 9 technology, and if construction goes as planned,\nit will be the most powerful rocket in the American inventory since the Apollo-\nera Saturn V. Falcon Heavy can be used to send a crewed Dragon spacecraft on\nlunar orbiting missions â such as the Apollo 8 mission; or be used to send a\nmodified unpiloted Dragon on a Mars landing mission. Musk has stated that his\nintention for the company is to help in the creation of a permanent human\npresence on Mars.\n","linknr":1006,"url":"SpaceX","recorded":1362267906,"links":88,"instances":["rocket","rocket_engine","rocket_engine","spacecraft_landing","spacecraft","rocket_engine","rocket_engine","air_and_space_craft","rocket_engine_family","spaceflight"],"pdf":["http://www.spacex.com/downloads/crs2-press-kit.pdf","http://www.spacex.com/downloads/crs2-press-kit.pdf","https://s3.amazonaws.com/public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2012-08556.pdf","http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/453605main_Commercial_Space_Minutes_4_26_2010.pdf","http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/453605main_Commercial_Space_Minutes_4_26_2010.pdf","http://www.nasa.gov/centers/johnson/pdf/189228main_setc_nnj06ta26a.pdf","http://www.nasa.gov/centers/johnson/pdf/189228main_setc_nnj06ta26a.pdf","http://procurement.ksc.nasa.gov/documents/NNK11MS04S_SAA-SpaceX.pdf","http://procurement.ksc.nasa.gov/documents/NNK11MS04S_SAA-SpaceX.pdf","http://www.spacex.com/downloads/cots1-20101206.pdf","http://www.spacex.com/downloads/cots1-20101206.pdf","http://www.spacex.com/MAIDENFLIGHTB27.pdf"],"categories":["SpaceX|","Aerospace
