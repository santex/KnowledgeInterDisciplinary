They believed his son, Muħammad ibn Ismā'īl al-Maktum, would return and\nbring about an age of justice as al-Mahdi. Their most famous and active branch\nwere the Qarmatians.\n\nSometimes \"sevener\" is used to refer to Ismailis overall, though several\nbranches, such as the Nizari Ismailis, have far more than seven imams.\n",
