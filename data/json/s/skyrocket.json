At the apex of its ascent, it is usual for a variety of\neffects (stars, bangs, crackles, etc.) to be emitted. Sky rockets use various\nstabilisation techniques to ensure the flight follows a predictable course,\noften a long stick attached to the side of the motor, but also including spin-\nstabilisation or fins.\n",
