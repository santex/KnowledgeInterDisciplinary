In\nthis article, \"particle\" is used to mean \"ionizing radiation\" and can refer\neither to charged particulate radiation, such as electrons and heavy charged\nparticles, or to uncharged radiation, such as photons and neutrons, provided\nthat they have enough energy to induce ionization. Sometimes, the excited\nstate is metastable, so the relaxation back out of the excited state is delayed\n(necessitating anywhere from a few microseconds to hours depending on the\nmaterial): the process then corresponds to either one of two phenomena,\ndepending on the type of transition and hence the wavelength of the emitted\noptical photon: delayed fluorescence or phosphorescence, also called after-glow.\n","linknr":449,"url":"Scintillator","recorded":1362555073,"links":31,"instances":["physics","phosphor","particle_radiation","fluorescence","physics"],"pdf":["http://www.detectors.saint-gobain.com/uploadedFiles/SGdetectors/Documents/Product_Data_Sheets/BaF2-Data-Sheet.pdf","http://www.detectors.saint-gobain.com/uploadedFiles/SGdetectors/Documents/Product_Data_Sheets/BaF2-Data-Sheet.pdf"],"categories":["Photochemistry","Particle
