This is a major component of the water cycle, and the primary agent in\nwater erosion. Robert E. Horton, The Horton Papers (1933) Keith\nBeven, [[Robert E. Horton]]'s perceptual model of infiltration processes,\nHydrological Processes, Wiley Intersciences DOI 10:1002 hyp 5740 (2004)\n\nRunoff that occurs on surfaces before reaching a channel is also called a\nnonpoint source. If a nonpoint source contains man-made contaminants, the runoff\nis called nonpoint source pollution. A land area which produces runoff that\ndrains to a common point is called a drainage basin. When runoff flows along the\nground, it can pick up soil contaminants including, but not limited to\npetroleum, pesticides, or fertilizers that become discharge or nonpoint source\npollution. L.
