Waves suitable for surfing are found primarily in the\nocean, but can be found in some lakes, in rivers in the form of a standing wave\nor tidal bore. Surfing can also be done in manmade sources such as wave pools\nand boat wakes. The term \"surfing\" refers to the act of riding a wave and not\nthe form (with or without a board) in which the wave is ridden. For instance,\nthe native peoples of the Pacific surfed waves on alaia, paipo, and other such\ncrafts on their belly, knees, and feet. Not to mention, [[Bodysurfing]], the act\nof surfing a wave without a board, is considered by some to be the purest form\nof surfing. That much said, the more modern day definition of surfing tends to\nrefer to when a surfer rides a wave standing up on a surfboard, which is\nreferred to as stand-up surfing or paddleboarding. Although, another prominent\nform of surfing in the ocean today includes bodyboarding, which refers to when a\nsurfer rides a wave either on the belly, dropknee, or stand-up on a bodyboard.\nNot to mention, knee boarding, surfmatting (riding inflatable mats), foils,\nbodysurfing, and so forth.\n\nThree major subdivisions within sitting -up surfing are longboarding,\nshortboarding, and stand up paddle surfing (SUP), reflecting differences in\nboard design, including surfboard length, riding style, and the kind of wave\nthat is ridden. In tow-in surfing (most often, but not exclusively, associated\nwith big wave surfing), a motorized water vehicle, such as a personal\nwatercraft, tows the surfer into the wave front, helping the surfer match a\nlarge wave's higher speed, which is generally a higher speed than a self-\npropelled surfer can obtain. Surfing-related sports such as paddleboarding and\nsea kayaking do not require waves, and other derivative sports such as\nkitesurfing and windsurfing rely primarily on wind for power, yet all of these\nplatforms may also be used to ride waves. Recently with the use of V-drive\nboats, wakesurfing, in which one surfs on the wake of a boat, has emerged. The\nGuinness Book of World Records recognized a wave ride by Garrett McNamara at\nNazarÃ©, Portugal as the largest wave ever surfed.\n","linknr":823,"url":"Surfing","recorded":1362372114,"links":94,"instances":["portugal","clothing","1751","surfing","meteorology","activewear","ocean","wct_surfing","geography"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Surfing|"],"headings":["History
