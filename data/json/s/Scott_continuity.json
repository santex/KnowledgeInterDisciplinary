The Scott-open subsets of\na partially ordered set P form a topology on P, the 'Scott topology'. A function\nbetween partially ordered sets is Scott-continuous if and only if it is\ncontinuous with respect to the Scott topology.\n\nThe Scott topology was first defined by Dana Scott for complete lattices and\nlater defined for arbitrary partially ordered sets.\n\nScott-continuous functions show up in the study of models for lambda calculi and the denotational semantics of computer programs.\n","linknr":163,"url":"Scott_continuity","recorded":1362676843,"links":15,"instances":["topology","mathematics_","order","set_theory","set_theory","order_theory","mathematics"],"pdf":["http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~axj/pub/papers/handy1.pdf","http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~axj/pub/papers/handy1.pdf"],"categories":["Order theory","General topology"],"headings":["Properties","Examples","See also","Footnotes","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/math/6/5/6/656b59f89122f1392436eec7e5b5feea.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["function","mathematics_"],["limit_preserving_function","order_theory"],["image","mathematics"],["intersection","set_theory"],["continuous_function","topology"],["inclusion","set_theory"],["inclusion","set_theory"],["lattice","order"]],"members":["continuous_function","function","lattice","intersection","inclusion","limit_preserving_function","image"],"related":["Mathematics","Partially_ordered_set","Function_(mathematics)_","Dana_Scott","Limit_preserving_function_(order_theory)","Directed_set","Supremum","Image_(mathematics)","Upper_set","Intersection_(set_theory)","Topological_space","Continuous_function_(topology)","Complete_lattice","Lambda_calculi","Denotational_semantics","Monotone_function","Closed_set","Lower_set","Directed_complete_partial_order","Kolmogorov_space","T0_separation_axiom","Hausdorff_space","Complete_lattice","Inclusion_(set_theory)","Specialization_order","Open_neighbourhood","Sober_space","Inclusion_(set_theory)","Lattice_(order)","Compact_space","Open_cover","Finite_subcover","Open_neighbourhood","Cartesian_closed_category","Complete_partial_order","Currying","Apply","Alexandrov_topology","Upper_topology"]}
