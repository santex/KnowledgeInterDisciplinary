The goals of right standardization can be to\nhelp with independence of single suppliers (commoditization), ,\ninteroperability, safety, repeatability, or quality.\n\nIn social sciences, including economics, the idea of standardization is close to\nthe solution for a coordination problem, a situation in which all parties can\nrealize mutual gains, but only by making mutually consistent decisions.\nStandardization is defined as best technical application consentual wisdom\ninclusive of processes for selection in making appropriate choices for\nratification coupled with consistent decisions for maintaining obtained\nstandards. This view includes the case of \"spontaneous standardization\nprocesses\", to produce de facto standards.\n","title":"Standardization","headings":["Usage","Techniques","Historically important standards","Other uses","Types","See also","References","Further reading"]},"micro-relation":["3: De_facto_standard","3: American_National_Standards_Institute","2: Interoperability","2: Social_sciences","2: W3C","2: The_International_Customer_Service_Institute","2: Standards_Council_of_Canada","2: Standards_organization","1: Technical_standard","1: Wholesaler","1: Commoditization","1: Safety","1: Repeatability","1: Economics","1: Coordination_problem","1: Ratification","1: Validation_and_verification","1: USB","1: Ethernet","1: Lean_manufacturing","1: UN/CEFACT","1: Customer_service","1: British_Standards_Institution","1: De_jure","1: ABNT","1: Asociación_Española_de_Normalización_y_Certificación","1: Association_française_de_Normalisation","1: BSI_Group","1: DGN","1: DIN","1: Instituto_Argentino_de_Normalización_y_Certificación","1: Japanese_Industrial_Standards_Committee","1: Korean_Agency_for_Technology_and_Standards","1: South_African_Bureau_of_Standards","1: Standardization_Administration_of_China","1: Swedish_Standards_Institute","1: SNZ","1: International_Organization_for_Standardisation","1: Crown_Corporation","1: Specification","1: Internet","1: IETF","1: Request_for_Comments","1: Interchangeability","1: Commonality","1: Reference","1: Value_engineering","1: Statistical_process_control","1: Interchangeable_parts","1: Joseph_Whitworth","1: British_Standard_Whitworth","1: Track_gauge","1: Thomas_Blanchard#Machine_tools_for_gun_making","1: Statistics","1: Standard_score","1: Test_theory","1: Supply_chain_management","1: Procurement","1: Manufacturing","1: New_institutional_economics","1: Coordination_game","1: International_marketing","1: Mass_production","1: Tradition","1: 7.62×51_NATO","1: ASTM","1: Commodity","1: Conformity_assessment","1: Embrace,_extend_and_extinguish","1: Environmental_standard","1: International_Classification_for_Standards","1: International_standard","1: Network_effect","1: Open_format","1: Open_standard","1: OpenDocument","1: Quality_infrastructure","1: Standard_gauge","1: Transport_standards_organisations","1: United_Nations_Group_of_Experts_on_Geographical_Names","1: Vendor_lock-in","1: Java_Community_Process"]}
