{"cursor":"12073","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n]] In geology, 'petrifaction' or 'petrification' is the process by which organic\nmaterial is converted into stone through the replacement of the original\nmaterial and the filling of the original pore spaces with minerals. Petrified\nwood is a common result of this process, but all organisms, from bacteria to\nvertebrates, can be petrified. Petrification takes place through a combination\nof two similar processes-permineralization and replacement. These processes\ncreate replicas of the original specimen that are similar down to the\nmicroscopic level.\n","linknr":238,"url":"Silicified","recorded":1362372880,"links":23,"instances":["geology"],"pdf":["http://www.freepatentsonline.com/4612050.pdf","http://petrifiedwoodmuseum.org/PDF/Permineralization.pdf"],"categories":["Botany","Fossils","Sedimentary rocks"],"headings":["Processes","Uses","Artificial petrification","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/03/Grand_Canyon_NP-Arizona-USA.jpg/230px-Grand_Canyon_NP-Arizona-USA.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/24/Petrified_wood_closeup_2.jpg/250px-Petrified_wood_closeup_2.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["rock","geology"]],"members":["rock"],"related":["Geology","Taphonomy","Organic_material","Rock_(geology)","Petrified_wood","Quartz","Calcite","Pyrite","Siderite","Apatite","Pyrite","Lamar,_Colorado","Glen_Rose,_Texas","Somervell_County,_Texas","Glen_Rose,_Texas","Dinosaur_Valley_State_Park","Glen_Rose_Formation","Agate_House_Pueblo","Petrified_Forest_National_Park","Pueblo","Pacific_Northwest_National_Laboratory","Titanium","Carbon","Titanium_carbide","Silicon_carbide","Girolamo_Segato","Florence","Greenwich,_Connecticut","Petrifaction_in_mythology_and_fiction","Petrifying_well","Rhynie_chert","Taphonomy"]}
