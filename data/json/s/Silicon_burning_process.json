{"cursor":"8156","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In astrophysics, 'silicon burning' is a very brief sequence of nuclear fusion reactions that occur in\nmassive stars with a minimum of about 8â11 solar masses. Silicon burning is the\nfinal stage of fusion for massive stars that have run out of the fuels that\npower them for their long lives in the [[main sequence]] on the Hertzsprung-\nRussell diagram. It follows the previous stages of hydrogen, helium, carbon,\nneon and oxygen burning processes.\n\nSilicon burning begins when gravitational contraction raises the starâs core\ntemperature to 2.7â3.5 billion kelvins (GK). The exact temperature depends on\nmass. When a star has completed the silicon-burning phase, no further fusion is\npossible. The star catastrophically collapses and may explode in what is known\nas a Type II supernova.\n","linknr":218,"url":"Silicon_burning_process","recorded":1362512955,"links":26,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Nucleosynthesis"],"headings":["Nuclear fusion sequence and the alpha process","Binding energy","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/53/Binding_energy_curve_-_common_isotopes.svg/500px-Binding_energy_curve_-_common_isotopes.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Astrophysics","Nuclear_fusion","Star","Silicon","Hertzsprung-Russell_diagram","Hydrogen_burning_process","Triple_alpha_process","Carbon_burning_process","Neon_burning_process","Oxygen_burning_process","Type_II_supernova","Supernova","Oxygen_burning_process","KeV","Photodisintegration","Nucleon","Zinc","Half-life","Beta_particle","Cobalt","Iron-56","Neutron_star","Black_hole","Type_II_supernova","Supernova","Nuclear_fission","Stellar_evolution","Supernova_nucleosynthesis","P-process","R-process","S-process"]}
