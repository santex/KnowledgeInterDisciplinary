{"cursor":"16249","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Structural failure' refers to loss of the load-carrying capacity of a component\nor member within a structure or of the structure itself. Structural failure is\ninitiated when the material is stressed to its strength limit, thus causing\nfracture or excessive deformations. In a well-designed system, a localized\nfailure should not cause immediate or even progressive collapse of the entire\nstructure. Ultimate failure strength is one of the limit states that must be\naccounted for in structural engineering and structural design.\n","linknr":301,"url":"Structural_failure","recorded":1362485868,"links":33,"instances":["deformation","minnesota","engineering"],"pdf":["http://www.ketchum.org/billah/Billah-Scanlan.pdf","http://www.dot.state.mn.us/traffic/data/maps/indexmaps/2006/metroindex.pdf","http://www.dot.state.mn.us/traffic/data/maps/indexmaps/2006/metroindex.pdf","http://www.dot.state.mn.us/traffic/data/maps/indexmaps/2006/mplsin.pdf","http://www.dot.state.mn.us/traffic/data/maps/indexmaps/2006/mplsin.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20070809232458/http://www.civil.northwestern.edu/people/bazant/PDFs/Papers/00+WTC+Collapse+-+What+did+&+Did+Not+Cause+It+-+Revised+6-22-07.pdf","http://www.civil.northwestern.edu/people/bazant/PDFs/Papers/00%20WTC%20Collapse%20-%20What%20did%20%26%20Did%20Not%20Cause%20It%20-%20Revised%206-22-07.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20070809232458/http://www.civil.northwestern.edu/people/bazant/PDFs/Papers/00+WTC+Collapse+-+What+did+&+Did+Not+Cause+It+-+Revised+6-22-07.pdf","http://www.civil.northwestern.edu/people/bazant/PDFs/Papers/405.pdf","http://www.civil.northwestern.edu/people/bazant/PDFs/Papers/405.pdf"],"categories":["Building defects","Mechanical failure modes","Structural engineering","Engineering failures"],"headings":["Notable failures","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d8/Dee_bridge_disaster.jpg/220px-Dee_bridge_disaster.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9d/35wBridgecollapse.gif/200px-35wBridgecollapse.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8d/Boeing_B-52_with_no_vertical_stabilizer.jpg/220px-Boeing_B-52_with_no_vertical_stabilizer.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/29/HRWalkway.svg/220px-HRWalkway.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["deformation","engineering"],["interstate_35w","minnesota"],["creep","deformation"]],"members":["creep","interstate_35w","deformation"],"related":["Structural_load","Architectural_structure","List_of_building_materials","Strength_of_materials","Deformation_(engineering)","Limit_state_design","Structural_engineering","Structural_design","Robert_Stephenson","Cast_iron","Wrought_iron","Cast_iron","Tay_Rail_Bridge","Thomas_Bouch","Forth_Railway_Bridge","Aeroelastic_flutter","Robert_H._Scanlan","American_Journal_of_Physics","Truss_arch_bridge","Interstate_35W_(Minnesota)","Mississippi_River","Minneapolis,_Minnesota","Minnesota","Minnesota_Department_of_Transportation","Catastrophic_failure","Rush_hour","Federal_Highway_Administration","Gusset_plate","Girder","Ronan_Point","London_Borough_of_Newham","Precast","Disproportionate_collapse","Alfred_P._Murrah_Federal_Building","Oklahoma","Reinforced_concrete_column","Brisance","Talpiot","Jerusalem","Israel","September_11_attacks","World_Trade_Center","Creep_(deformation)","1963_Elephant_Mountain_B-52_crash","1964_Savage_Mountain_B-52_crash","Metal_fatigue","Vertical_stabilizer","Burj_Khalifa","WLBT_Tower","Hyatt_Regency","Kansas_City,_Missouri","Catastrophic_failure","Earthquake_engineering","Porch_collapse","Forensic_engineering","Progressive_collapse","Seismic_performance","Structural_Fracture_Mechanics","Collapse_zone","Sampoong_Department_Store_collapse","1995"]}
