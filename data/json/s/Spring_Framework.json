[http://www.springsource.org/features SpringSource Feature\nTour]\n\nThe first version was written by Rod Johnson, who released the framework with\nthe publication of his book Expert One-on-One J2EE Design and Development in\nOctober 2002. The framework was first released under the Apache 2.0 license in\nJune 2003. The first milestone release, 1.0, was released in March 2004, with\nfurther milestone releases in September 2004 and March 2005. The Spring 1.2.6\nframework won a Jolt productivity award and a JAX Innovation Award in\n2006.

The current version is 3.2.1,\nwhich was released in January 2013. [http://www.springsource.org/node/3791 |\nSpringSource.org] Spring Framework 4.0 is expected by the end of 2013, [http://blog.springsource.org/2013/01/16/next-stop-spring-framework-\n4-0/ | SpringSource.org] with plans to support Java SE 8, Groovy 2, some\naspects of Java EE7, and WebSockets.\n\nThe core features of the Spring Framework can be used by any Java application,\nbut there are extensions for building web applications on top of the Java EE\nplatform. Although the Spring Framework does not impose any specific programming\nmodel, it has become popular in the Java community as an alternative to,\nreplacement for, or even addition to the Enterprise JavaBean (EJB) model.\n","linknr":420,"url":"Spring_Framework","recorded":1362575371,"links":39,"instances":["programming_language_","computer_science","java","protocol","computer_programming","programming_language","computer_science","computer_science","database","web_service_protocol","program_lifecycle_phase","computer_science","programmer","computing","programming"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Java
