{"cursor":"19327","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nA 'single-nucleotide polymorphism' ('SNP', pronounced snip; plural snips) is a\nDNA sequence variation occurring when a single nucleotide — A, T, C or G\n— in the genome (or other shared sequence) differs between members of a\nbiological species or paired chromosomes in a human. For example, two sequenced\nDNA fragments from different individuals, AAGC CTA to AAGC TTA,\ncontain a difference in a single nucleotide. In this case we say that there are\ntwo [[allele]]s. Almost all common SNPs have only two alleles. The genomic\ndistribution of SNPs is not homogenous; SNPs usually occur in non-coding regions\nmore frequently than in coding regions or, in general, where natural selection\nis acting and fixating the allele of the SNP that constitutes the most favorable\ngenetic adaptation. Other factors, like genetic\nrecombination and mutation rate, can also determine SNP density.\n\nSNP density can be predicted by the presence of microsatellites: AT\nmicrosatellites in particular are potent predictors of SNP density, with long\n(AT)(n) repeat tracts tending to be found in regions of significantly reduced\nSNP density and low GC content.\n\nWithin a population, SNPs can be assigned a minor allele frequency — the\nlowest allele frequency at a locus that is observed in a particular population.\nThis is simply the lesser of the two allele frequencies for single-nucleotide\npolymorphisms. There are variations between human populations, so a SNP allele\nthat is common in one geographical or ethnic group may be much rarer in another.\n\nThese genetic variations between individuals (particularly in non-coding parts\nof the genome) are exploited in DNA fingerprinting, which is used in forensic\nscience . Also, these genetic variations underlie differences in our\nsusceptibility to disease. The severity of illness and the way our body responds\nto treatments are also manifestations of genetic variations. For example, a\nsingle base mutation in the Apolipoprotein E gene is associated with a higher\nrisk for Alzheimer's disease.\n","linknr":475,"url":"Single_nucleotide_polymorphism","recorded":1362373515,"links":53,"instances":["biology","statistics","genetics","genetics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Molecular biology","Population genetics","DNA","Genetic genealogy","Single nucleotide polymorphisms|*"],"headings":["Types","Use and importance","Examples","Databases","Nomenclature","SNP analysis","SNPs simulation","See also","Notes","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2e/Dna-SNP.svg/220px-Dna-SNP.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["microsatellite","genetics"],["locus","genetics"],["polymorphism","biology"],["cohort","statistics"]],"members":["polymorphism","cohort","microsatellite","locus"],"related":["DNA_sequence","Nucleotide","Adenine","Thymine","Cytosine","Guanine","Genome","Biological_species","Chromosome","Allele","Genetic_recombination","Microsatellite_(genetics)","GC_content","Minor_allele_frequency","Locus_(genetics)","DNA_profiling","Apolipoprotein_E","Polymorphism_(biology)","Gene","Intron","Intergenic_region","Amino_acid","Protein","Missense_mutation","Nonsense_mutations","Gene_splicing","Transcription_factor","Messenger_RNA","Non-coding_RNA","Disease","Pathogen","Chemical","Medication","Vaccine","Personalized_medicine","Cohort_(statistics)","Genome-wide_association_study","Livestock","SNP_genotyping","Genetic_disorder","Genetic_disorder","Osteoporosis","Genome-wide_association_studies","Gene_mapping","Pharmacokinetics","Pharmacodynamics","Human_diseases","Cancer","Infectious_diseases","Autoimmune_disease","Rs6311","Rs6313","HTR2A","Factor_V_Leiden","Rs3091244","C-reactive_protein","TAS2R38","Phenylthiocarbamide","Bioinformatics","National_Center_for_Biotechnology_Information","GWAS_Central","Genome-wide_association_studies","International_HapMap_Project","Tag_SNP","Human_Genome_Variation_Society","DNA_sequencing","Capillary_electrophoresis","Mass_spectrometry","Single-strand_conformation_polymorphism","Electrochemical_analysis","Denaturating_HPLC","Gel_electrophoresis","Restriction_fragment_length_polymorphism","Hybridization_analysis","Single-base_extension","SNP_array","Variome","TaqMan","Affymetrix","International_HapMap_Project","Tag_SNP","Short_tandem_repeat","Snpstr"]}
