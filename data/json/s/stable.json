It\nmost commonly means a building that is divided into separate stalls for\nindividual animals. There are many different types of stables in use today such\nas the American barn which is a large barn with a door each end and individual\nstalls inside or free standing stables with the classic top and bottom opening\ndoors. The term \"stable\" is also used to describe a group of animals kept by one\nowner, regardless of housing or location.\n\nThe exterior design of a stable can vary widely, based on climate, building\nmaterials, historical period, and cultural styles of architecture. A wide range\nof building materials can be used, including masonry (bricks or stone), wood,\nand steel. Stables can range widely in size, from a small building to house only\none or two animals, to facilities used at agricultural shows or at race tracks,\nwhich can house hundreds of animals.\n","title":"stable","headings":["History","Horses","Other uses","See also","References"]},"micro-relation":["2: Horse","2: Barn","1: Building","1: Livestock","1: Masonry","1: Agricultural_show","1: Horse_racing","1: Draught_animal","1: English_Heritage","1: Great_Britain","1: Hayloft","1: Foaling","1: Mare","1: Cavalry","1: Professional_wrestling","1: Sumo","1: Horse_care#Barns_and_stables","1: Glossary_of_equestrian_terms","1: Horse_care","1: Nativity_of_Jesus"]}
