Motte-Picquet'') are fitted with VDS (Variable Depth Sonar) type\n DUBV43 or DUBV43C towed sonars]]\n\n'Sonar' (originally an acronym for 'SO'und 'N'avigation 'A'nd 'R'anging) is a\ntechnique that uses sound propagation (usually underwater, as in submarine\nnavigation) to navigate, communicate with or detect objects on or under the\nsurface of the water, such as other vessels. Two types of technology share the\nname \"sonar\": passive sonar is essentially listening for the sound made by\nvessels; active sonar is emitting pulses of sounds and listening for echoes.\nSonar may be used as a means of acoustic location and of measurement of the echo\ncharacteristics of \"targets\" in the water. Acoustic location in air was used\nbefore the introduction of radar. Sonar may also be used in air for robot\nnavigation, and SODAR (an upward looking in-air sonar) is used for atmospheric\ninvestigations. The term sonar is also used for the equipment used to generate\nand receive the sound. The acoustic frequencies used in sonar systems vary from\nvery low (infrasonic) to extremely high (ultrasonic). The study of underwater\nsound is known as underwater acoustics or hydroacoustics.\n","title":"sonar","headings":["History","Performance factors","Active sonar","Passive sonar","Military applications","Civilian applications","Scientific applications","See also","References","Bibliography","Further reading","External links"]},"micro-relation":["4: Radar","4: Thermocline","3: World_War_II","3: Sonobuoy","3: Frogmen","2: Submarine_navigation","2: Underwater_acoustics","2: Hydroacoustics","2: Reginald_Fessenden","2: Submarine","2: Pressure","2: SOFAR_channel","2: Target_strength","2: Tonpilz","2: Hydrophone","2: Pulse_compression","2: Echo_sounding","2: Underwater_acoustics#Propagation_loss","2: Remotely_operated_underwater_vehicle","2: Visibility","2: Side-scan_sonar","2: Synthetic_aperture_sonar","1: FS_La_Motte-Picquet","1: Acronym","1: Sound","1: Navigation","1: Acoustic_location","1: SODAR","1: Infrasonic","1: Ultrasound","1: Leonardo_Da_Vinci","1: Lighthouses","1: Bat","1: RMS_Titanic","1: Patent","1: UK_Intellectual_Property_Office","1: Lewis_Richardson","1: Alexander_Behm","1: Grand_Banks","1: Morse_Code","1: U.S._Coast_and_Geodetic_Survey","1: Oscillator","1: Montreal","1: British_H_class_submarine","1: Fessenden_oscillator","1: World_War_I","1: Paul_Langevin","1: Constantin_Chilowski","1: Piezoelectricity","1: Electrostatics","1: Hydrophones","1: Terfenol-D","1: Robert_William_Boyle","1: Albert_Beaumont_Wood","1: Oxford_English_Dictionary","1: France","1: United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland","1: Flotilla","1: Isle_of_Portland","1: Royal_Navy","1: Depth_charge","1: Tizard_Mission","1: Codename","1: Mine_detection","1: Nuclear_submarine","1: Sound_speed","1: Fresh_water","1: Sea_water","1: Bulk_modulus","1: Mass","1: Density","1: Salinity","1: Speed_of_sound","1: Empirical","1: Refraction","1: Snell's_law","1: Waves","1: Shipping","1: Scattering","1: Frequency_spectrum","1: Continuous_spectrum","1: Anechoic_tiles","1: Pulse","1: Beamforming","1: Multibeam_echosounder","1: Signal_processing","1: Frequency","1: Chirp","1: Digital_processing","1: Doppler_effect","1: Fishfinder","1: Shoaling_and_schooling","1: Project_ARTEMIS","1: Sphere","1: Orders_of_magnitude","1: Inverse-square_law","1: Underwater_acoustics#Source_level","1: Noise_level","1: Directivity_index","1: Array_gain","1: Detection_threshold","1: Reverberation_level","1: Marine_animals","1: Whale","1: Dolphin","1: Animal_echolocation","1: Clearance_Diver","1: Limpet_mine","1: International_Society_for_Optical_Engineering","1: SPIE","1: Space_Shuttle_Columbia","1: Fish_passage","1: Hydropower","1: Passive_acoustics","1: Passive_radar","1: Hertz","1: Alternating_current","1: Transformer","1: Electrical_generator","1: Vibration","1: Wrench","1: Databases","1: Computer_system","1: Office_of_Naval_Intelligence","1: Nuclear_reactor","1: Convection","1: Fuel_cell","1: Propeller","1: Cavitation","1: Spectrogram","1: Plan_position_indicator","1: Figure_of_merit","1: Naval_warfare","1: Japan","1: Toshiba","1: Soviet_Union","1: Radiated_noise_level","1: Fourier_transform","1: Trajectory","1: Target_Motion_Analysis","1: High-tech","1: Submarines","1: SQS-56","1: Sonar_2087","1: Thales_Underwater_Systems","1: Mark_37_torpedo","1: AN/SLQ-25_Nixie","1: Mobile_submarine_simulator","1: SSTD","1: Acoustic_mine","1: CAPTOR_mine","1: Type_2193","1: SQQ-32_Mine-hunting_sonar","1: Type_2093","1: Oyashio_class_submarine","1: Swiftsure_class","1: AQS-13","1: AQS-20A","1: Underwater_acoustics#Underwater_communication","1: United_States","1: SOSUS","1: Integrated_Undersea_Surveillance_System_Badge","1: Scuba_diver","1: Anti-frogman_techniques#Cerberus","1: Underwater_Port_Security_System","1: Anti-frogman_techniques#Ultrasound_detection","1: Clearance_diver","1: Naval_mine","1: Vanguard_class_submarine","1: Fishing","1: Sustainability","1: Swim_bladder","1: Deep_sea","1: Analog_signal","1: Graphical_display","1: Ship","1: Boat","1: Transducer","1: Long-Term_Mine_Reconnaissance_System","1: Long_base_line_sonar","1: Echoview","1: Fisheries_Acoustics","1: Acoustic_Seabed_Classification","1: GLORIA_sidescan_sonar","1: Parametric_array","1: Acoustic_Doppler_Current_Profiler","1: Acoustic_tag","1: Beached_whale","1: Bistatic_sonar","1: Diver_Detection_Sonar","1: Fish_finder","1: Ocean_acoustic_tomography","1: Passive_Radar","1: Lead_zirconate_titanate","1: Scientific_Echosounder","1: Towed_array_sonar","1: Upward_looking_sonar","1: Time_Magazine","1: Casa_Loma","1: Toronto"]}
