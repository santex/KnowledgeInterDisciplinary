The charity's sole collection period lasts only ten days, which has\nmade it a recognisable part of the Cork Christmas season. It has received\nrecognition from the media, important Irish political figures, and the people of\nCork; but it is the involvement of students from all of Cork city's secondary\nschools has made SHARE \"a truly unique and effective organisation\" in Ireland\ntoday.
