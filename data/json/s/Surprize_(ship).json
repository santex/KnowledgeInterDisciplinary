{"cursor":"1640","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"Surprise#Ships}} 'Surprize' was one of the notorious Second Fleet ships to Port\nJackson. At 400 tons burthen (bm), she was the smallest ship of the fleet, and\nwas an unsuitable vessel for so long a voyage, proving to be a wet ship even in\nmoderate weather. In rough seas and heavy gales the convicts âwere considerably\nabove their waists in waterâ, according to the commander of the guards. She had\nbeen chartered by the British East India Company to load tea at Canton for the\nreturn journey. In company with ''Neptune'' and ''Scarborough'' she sailed from\nEngland with 254 male convicts on 19 January 1790. Her master was Nicholas\nAnstis, formerly chief mate on the ''Lady Penrhyn'' in the First Fleet, and\nsurgeon was William Waters. She arrived at the Cape of Good Hope on 13 April\n1790, and spent sixteen days there, taking on provisions. She was parted from\nher consorts in heavy weather and came in sight of Port Jackson on 23 June.\nContrary winds blew here out to sea again and she did not make port until 26\nJune 158 days out from England. During the voyage thirty-six convicts died\n(14%), and 121 (48%) were sick when landed.\n\nIt is not known if this is the same Surprise that made another voyage in 1794.\n","linknr":85,"url":"Surprize_(ship)","recorded":1374863737,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Surprize_(ship)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Surprize_(ship)&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Surprise_(disambiguation)#Ships","/wiki/Second_Fleet_(Australia)","/wiki/Port_Jackson","/wiki/Builder%27s_Old_Measurement","/wiki/British_East_India_Company","/wiki/Guangzhou","/wiki/Neptune_(ship)","/wiki/Scarborough_(ship)","/wiki/England","/w/index.php?title=Nicholas_Anstis&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Lady_Penrhyn_(ship)","/wiki/First_Fleet","/w/index.php?title=William_Waters_(surgeon)&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Cape_of_Good_Hope","/w/index.php?title=Surprize_(ship)&action=edit&section=1","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Surprize_(ship)&oldid=543992387","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Ships_of_the_Second_Fleet","/wiki/Category:Convict_ships_to_Australia","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Surprize+%28ship%29&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Surprize+%28ship%29","/wiki/Surprize_(ship)","/wiki/Talk:Surprize_(ship)","#","/wiki/Surprize_(ship)","/w/index.php?title=Surprize_(ship)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Surprize_(ship)&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Surprize_(ship)","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Surprize_(ship)","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Surprize_(ship)&oldid=543992387","/w/index.php?title=Surprize_(ship)&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1457405","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Surprize_%28ship%29&id=543992387","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Surprize+%28ship%29","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Surprize+%28ship%29&oldid=543992387&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Surprize_(ship)&printable=yes","//de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surprize","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1457405#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surprize_(ship)","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":["ship","ship","ship","surgeon","australia"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Ships
