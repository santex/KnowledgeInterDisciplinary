{"cursor":"17929","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nIn the social sciences there is a standing debate over the primacy of 'structure\nor agency' in shaping human behavior. '[[agency (sociology)|Agency]]' is the\ncapacity of individuals to act independently and to make their own free\nchoices. Barker, Chris. 2005. Cultural\nStudies: Theory and Practice. London: Sage. ISBN 0-7619-4156-8 p448\n'[[Social structure|Structure]]' is the recurrent patterned arrangements which\ninfluence or limit the choices and opportunities available. The debate can be contrasted with the \"nature verses\nnurture\" debate, which questions whether a person's physiology (\"nature\") or\nsocialization (\"nurture\") predominates in the formation of an individual's\nidentity. In contrast, the structure versus agency debate may be understood as\nan issue of socialization against autonomy in determining whether an individual\nacts as a free agent or in a manner dictated by social structure.\n","linknr":296,"url":"Structure_and_agency","recorded":1362371491,"links":18,"instances":["sociology","sociology","sociology","sociology","social_theory","bourdieu","norm"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Sociological terminology","Sociological theories","Sociology index","Philosophy of social science"],"headings":["Structure, socialisation and autonomy","Major theorists","Recent developments","A European problem?","See also","Notes","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c7/SNA_segment.png/180px-SNA_segment.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg/20px-Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg/20px-Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["norm","sociology"],["convention","norm"],["action_theory","sociology"],["habitus","sociology"],["field","bourdieu"],["reflexivity","social_theory"],["agency","sociology"],["agency","sociology"],["action_theory","sociology"]],"members":["habitus","action_theory","norm","agency","reflexivity","field","convention"],"related":["Social_science","Physiology","Socialization","Socialization","Autonomy","Social_ontology","Structural_functionalist","Émile_Durkheim","Karl_Marx","Economic_materialism","Economic","Cultural","Norm_(sociology)","Convention_(norm)","Tradition","Ideologies","Social_structure","Structuralism","Structural_functionalism","Marxism","Holism","Methodological_individualism","Structural_functionalism","Interactionism","Ethnomethodology","Structuration","Émile_Durkheim","Emergence","Holism","Socialization","Epiphenomenon","Georg_Simmel","Nonpositivist","Norbert_Elias","Figurational_Sociology","Talcott_Parsons","Action_theory_(sociology)","United_States","Institutionalisation","Cybernetic","High_and_low_level","Pierre_Bourdieu","Habitus_(sociology)","International_Sociological_Association","Field_(Bourdieu)","Socialization","Social_relation","Peter_L._Berger","Thomas_Luckmann","The_Social_Construction_of_Reality","Dialectic","James_Samuel_Coleman","Anthony_Giddens","Structuration","Dualism","Social_action","Structuration","Reflexivity_(social_theory)","Globalization","Emancipation","David_Gauntlett","Roberto_Mangabeira_Unger","Negative_capability","Agency_(sociology)","Social_structure","False_necessity","Economics","Tony_Lawson","Sociology","Margaret_Archer","Kenneth_Wilkinson","Critical_Psychology","Nicos_Mouzelis","Macrosociology","Microsociology","George_Ritzer","Social_structure","Social_relation","Agency_(sociology)","Structural-functionalism","Structuration","Action_theory_(sociology)","Base_and_superstructure","Nature_vs._nurture","Actor-Network_Theory","Principal–agent_problem","Negative_capability","Harper_Collins"]}
