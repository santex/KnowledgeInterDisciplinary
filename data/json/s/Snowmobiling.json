Designed to be\noperated on snow and ice, they do not require a specific road or trail. Design\nvariations enable some machines to operate in deep snow or forests; most are\nused on open terrain, including frozen lakes, or driven on paths or trails.\nUsually designed to accommodate two people, their use is very similar to a\nmotorcycle and an all-terrain vehicle (ATVs) designated for winter use on snowy\nground and frozen ponds and waterways. They do not have any enclosures except\nfor a windshield and their engine normally drives a continuous track or tracks\nat the rear; skis at the front provide directional control.\n\nEarly snowmobiles used rubber tracks, but modern snowmobiles typically have\ntracks made of a Kevlar composite. Originally snowmobiles were typically powered\nby two-stroke gasoline/petrol internal combustion engines. Four-stroke engines\nare becoming more and more common in snowmobiles, primarily to address\nenvironmental complaints.\n\nOriginally intended as a winter utility vehicle to be used where motor vehicles\ncannot go, they appealed to hunters and workers transporting personnel and\nmaterial across snow-covered land, frozen lakes and rivers. In the latter part\nof the 20th century, they have been put to use for recreational purposes as\nwell. People who ride them commonly are known as snowmobilers. The contemporary\ntypes of recreational riding forms are known as snowcross/racing, trail riding,\nfreestyle, mountain climbing, boondocking, carving, ditchbanging and grass\ndrags. Summertime activities for snowmobile enthusiasts include drag racing on\ngrass, asphalt strips, or even across water.\n","linknr":552,"url":"Snowmobiling","recorded":1362372123,"links":63,"instances":["city","motorcycle"],"pdf":["http://web.archive.org/web/20080710214959/http://deq.mt.gov/CleanSnowmobile/news/115-Certified+Snowmobiles.pdf","http://www.deq.mt.gov/CleanSnowmobile/news/115-Certified%20Snowmobiles.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20080710214959/http://deq.mt.gov/CleanSnowmobile/news/115-Certified+Snowmobiles.pdf","http://www.cma.ca/multimedia/staticContent/HTML/N0/l2/cjs/vol-47/issue-2/pdf/pg90.pdf","http://www.cma.ca/multimedia/staticContent/HTML/N0/l2/cjs/vol-47/issue-2/pdf/pg90.pdf","http://snowmobile.org/yellowstone-graphs.pdf"],"categories":["Snowmobiles","Tracked
