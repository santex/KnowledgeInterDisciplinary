This\nprocess is usually applied to protein tertiary structures but can also be used\nfor large RNA molecules. In contrast to simple structural superposition, where\nat least some equivalent residues of the two structures are known, structural\nalignment requires no a priori knowledge of equivalent positions. Structural\nalignment is a valuable tool for the comparison of proteins with low sequence\nsimilarity, where evolutionary relationships between proteins cannot be easily\ndetected by standard sequence alignment techniques. Structural alignment can\ntherefore be used to imply evolutionary relationships between proteins that\nshare very little common sequence. However, caution should be used in using the\nresults as evidence for shared evolutionary ancestry because of the possible\nconfounding effects of convergent evolution by which multiple unrelated amino\nacid sequences converge on a common tertiary structure.\n\nStructural alignments can compare two sequences or multiple sequences. Because\nthese alignments rely on information about all the query sequences' three-\ndimensional conformations, the method can only be used on sequences where these\nstructures are known. These are usually found by X-ray crystallography or NMR\nspectroscopy. It is possible to perform a structural alignment on structures\nproduced by structure prediction methods. Indeed, evaluating such predictions\noften requires a structural alignment between the model and the true known\nstructure to assess the model's quality. Structural alignments are especially\nuseful in analyzing data from structural genomics and proteomics efforts, and\nthey can be used as comparison points to evaluate alignments produced by purely\nsequence-based bioinformatics methods.\n\nThe outputs of a structural alignment are a superposition of the atomic\ncoordinate sets and a minimal root mean square deviation (RMSD) between the\nstructures. The RMSD of two aligned structures indicates their divergence from\none another. Structural alignment can be complicated by the existence of\nmultiple protein domains within one or more of the input structures, because\nchanges in relative orientation of the domains between two structures to be\naligned can artificially inflate the RMSD.\n","linknr":622,"url":"Structural_alignment","recorded":1362509770,"links":19,"instances":["geometry","mathematics","bioinformatics","geometric"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Protein methods"],"headings":["Data produced by structural alignment","Types of comparisons","Algorithmic complexity","Representation of structures","Methods","Recent developments","RNA structural alignment","Software","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/Alignment_of_thioredoxins2.png/300px-Alignment_of_thioredoxins2.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b1/Ssap-vectors.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg/20px-Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/94/Symbol_support_vote.svg/15px-Symbol_support_vote.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["root_mean_square_deviation","bioinformatics"],["plane","geometry"],["matrix","mathematics"],["vector","geometric"]],"members":["plane","matrix","root_mean_square_deviation","vector"],"related":["Drosophila_melanogaster","Polymer","Tertiary_structure","Protein","Tertiary_structure","RNA","Sequence_alignment","Evolution","Convergent_evolution","Amino_acid","Tertiary_structure","Multiple_sequence_alignment","X-ray_crystallography","NMR_spectroscopy","Protein_structure_prediction","Structural_genomics","Proteomics","Bioinformatics","Coordinates","Root_mean_square","Root_mean_square_deviation_(bioinformatics)","Protein_domain","Global_distance_test","CASP","Sequence_alignment","Amino_acid","Side_chain","Peptide_bond","Alpha_carbon","Plane_(geometry)","Rotamer","Secondary_structure","Native_contact","Hydrogen_bond","Quaternion","Helix_bundle","Protein_threading","NP-complete","Polynomial-time","Distance_matrix","Matrix_(mathematics)","Alpha_carbon","Secondary_structure","Signal_noise","Protein_Data_Bank","Tertiary_structure","Secondary_structure","Main_diagonal","Monte_Carlo_method","Families_of_structurally_similar_proteins","Dihedral_angle","Protein_Data_Bank","Circular_Permutation_Proteins","CASP","Dynamic_programming","Hidden_Markov_model","Protein_structure_prediction","Longest_path","Directed_acyclic_graph","Dynamic_programming","Vector_(geometric)","Beta_carbon","CATH","Dynamic_programming","Rosetta@home","World_Community_Grid","Families_of_structurally_similar_proteins","European_Bioinformatics_Institute","Macromolecule","RNA","RNA_structure","Hydrogen_bond","Base_pair","Base_stacking","Noncoding_RNA","Genomics","Information_content","Nucleotide","Protein_folding","Pseudoknot","Thermodynamic_free_energy","Structural_alignment_software","Multiple_sequence_alignment","List_of_sequence_alignment_software","Sequence_alignment","Structural_Classification_of_Proteins"]}
