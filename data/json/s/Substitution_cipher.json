{"cursor":"25967","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nIn cryptography, a 'substitution cipher' is a method of encryption by which\nunits of plaintext are replaced with ciphertext, according to a regular system;\nthe \"units\" may be single letters (the most common), pairs of letters, triplets\nof letters, mixtures of the above, and so forth. The receiver deciphers the text\nby performing an inverse substitution.\n\nSubstitution ciphers can be compared with transposition ciphers. In a\ntransposition cipher, the units of the plaintext are rearranged in a different\nand usually quite complex order, but the units themselves are left unchanged. By\ncontrast, in a substitution cipher, the units of the plaintext are retained in\nthe same sequence in the ciphertext, but the units themselves are altered.\n\nThere are a number of different types of substitution cipher. If the cipher\noperates on single letters, it is termed a 'simple substitution cipher'; a\ncipher that operates on larger groups of letters is termed 'polygraphic'. A\n'monoalphabetic cipher' uses fixed substitution over the entire message, whereas\na 'polyalphabetic cipher' uses a number of substitutions at different positions\nin the message, where a unit from the plaintext is mapped to one of several\npossibilities in the ciphertext and vice versa.\n\n__TOC__\n","linknr":378,"url":"Substitution_cipher","recorded":1362688561,"links":45,"instances":["political","information","linear_algebra","information","mathematics","cryptography","cryptography"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Classical ciphers","Fictional languages|"],"headings":["Simple substitution","Homophonic substitution","Polyalphabetic substitution","Polygraphic substitution","Mechanical substitution ciphers","The one-time pad","Substitution in modern cryptography","Substitution ciphers in popular culture","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2a/ROT13.png/300px-ROT13.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/ba/A-pigpen-message.svg/320px-A-pigpen-message.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e0/Babington_postscript.jpg/220px-Babington_postscript.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/1/c/81c59cac8bf1fd34f33c2fd8af01ea42.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/d/0/fd05f21f01b97f2f1e9850afc6cadd37.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["key","cryptography"],["code","cryptography"],["conspiracy","political"],["table","information"],["basis","linear_algebra"],["matrix","mathematics"],["ban","information"]],"members":["conspiracy","ban","basis","table","matrix","code","key"],"related":["Cryptography","Encryption","Ciphertext","Transposition_cipher","Caesar_cipher","Caesar_cipher","Atbash","Plaintext","Telegraphy","Null_character","Pigpen_cipher","The_Wall_Street_Journal","Key_(cryptography)","Key_size","Cryptanalysis","Frequency_distribution","Frequency_analysis","English_language","Cryptogram","Unicity_distance","English_language","Homophonic_substitution_cipher","Codebook","Code_(cryptography)","Cipher","Rossignols","Great_Cipher","Louis_XIV_of_France","Archive","Diplomacy","Espionage","Conspiracy_(political)","Government","Intelligence_agency","Cryptanalyst","Cryptanalysis","History","Beale_Ciphers","Book_cipher","Straddling_checkerboard","Leone_Battista_Alberti","Johannes_Trithemius","Ancient_Greek","Giovanni_Battista_della_Porta","Latin","Table_(information)","Blaise_de_Vigenère","French_language","Vigenère_cipher","Modular_arithmetic","Friedrich_Kasiski","Crimean_War","Charles_Babbage","Beaufort_cipher","Autokey_cipher","Periodic_function","Running_key_cipher","Stream_cipher","Keystream","Glyph","Playfair_cipher","Charles_Wheatstone","Playfair_cipher","Second_Boer_War","World_War_II","Felix_Delastelle","Bifid_cipher","Four-square_cipher","Trifid_cipher","Hill_cipher","Lester_S._Hill","Linear_algebra","Numeral_system","Basis_(linear_algebra)","Prime_number","Vector_space","Dimension","Matrix_(mathematics)","Modular_arithmetic","Random","Known-plaintext_attack","Linear","Non-linear","Confusion_and_diffusion","Substitution-permutation_network","Feistel_cipher","Block_cipher","World_War_I","Computer","Rotor_machine","Enigma_machine","Wehrmacht","Allies","SIGABA","Typex","Electric","William_F._Friedman","Signals_Intelligence_Service","Hebern_Rotor_Machine","GC&CS","Dillwyn_Knox","World_War_II","Bletchley_Park","Marian_Rejewski","Poland","SIGABA","Typex","One-time_pad","Gilbert_Vernam","Joseph_Mauborgne","Claude_Shannon","XOR","Random","Soviet_Union","VENONA","ROCKEX","Moscow","Washington,_D.C.","Moscow–Washington_hotline","Cuban_missile_crisis","Block_cipher","Data_Encryption_Standard","Advanced_Encryption_Standard","Binary_numeral_system","S-box","Substitution-permutation_network","Sherlock_Holmes","The_Adventure_of_the_Dancing_Men","Al_Bhed","French_Language","Minbari","English_alphabet","Gravity_Falls","Caesar_cipher","Artemis_Fowl","Eoin_Colfer","Kristin_Cashore","Ban_(information)","Copiale_cipher","Dvorak_encoding","Leet","Vigenère_cipher","Topics_in_cryptography"]}
