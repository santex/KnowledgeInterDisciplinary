It was put together by Alan Niven, Great White's former manager, as a\ncontractual release for Zoo Entertainment.  The first six tracks of\nthe CD come from a 1994 House of Blues benefit concert (Stage One) and the other\nsongs from a 1993 Anaheim show (Stage Two), several tracks of which were\npreviously featured as a bonus on the studio album [[Sail Away (Great White\nalbum)|Sail Away]]. The initial Japanese pressing was a two-disc set, and\nfeatured one bonus track for each show.\n\nThe songs of this album, with the exception of \"Maybe Someday\" and \"Congo\nSquare\", were re-issued in 2004 by BMG Special Products, with the title\n'Extended Versions'.\n","linknr":200,"url":"Stage_(Great_White_album)","recorded":1362583476,"links":18,"instances":["great_white_song","musician","record_label","band","guitarist"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Great White live albums","1995 live albums","2004 live albums"],"headings":["Track listing","Personnel","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/ac/StageGW.JPG/220px-StageGW.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/71/ExtendedGW.jpg/220px-ExtendedGW.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Star_full.svg/11px-Star_full.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Star_full.svg/11px-Star_full.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Star_empty.svg/11px-Star_empty.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Star_empty.svg/11px-Star_empty.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Star_empty.svg/11px-Star_empty.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["great_white","band"],["zoo_entertainment","record_label"],["great_white","band"],["zoo_entertainment","record_label"],["rock_me","great_white_song"],["jack_russell","musician"],["mark_kendall","guitarist"]],"members":["rock_me","jack_russell","zoo_entertainment","great_white","mark_kendall"],"related":["Great_White_(band)","House_of_Blues","Anaheim,_California","Hard_rock","Zoo_Entertainment_(record_label)","Michael_Lardie","Allmusic","United_States","Hard_rock","Great_White_(band)","Zoo_Entertainment_(record_label)","House_of_Blues","Sony_BMG","Afterglow_of_Your_Love","Babe_I'm_Gonna_Leave_You","Rock_Me_(Great_White_song)","Once_Bitten,_Twice_Shy","Jack_Russell_(musician)","Mark_Kendall_(guitarist)","Michael_Lardie","Audie_Desbrow"]}
