{"cursor":"8450","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'supernetwork', or 'supernet', is an Internet Protocol (IP) network that is\nformed from the combination of two or more networks (or subnets) with a common\nClassless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) prefix. The new routing prefix for the\ncombined network aggregates the prefixes of the constituent networks. It must\nnot contain other prefixes of networks that do not lie in the same routing path.\nThe process of forming a supernet is often called 'supernetting', 'prefix\naggregation', 'route aggregation', or 'route summarization'.\n\nSupernetting within the Internet serves as a preventive strategy to avoid\ntopological fragmentation of the IP address space by using a hierarchical\nallocation system that delegates control of segments of address space to\nregional network service providers. RFC 1338, Supernetting: an Address\nAssignment and Aggregation Strategy, V. Fuller, T. Li, J. Yu, K. Varadhan (June\n1992) This method facilitates regional route aggregation.\n\nThe benefits of supernetting are conservation of address space and efficiencies\ngained in routers in terms of memory storage of route information and processing\noverhead when matching routes. Supernetting, however, is not without risks.\n","linknr":130,"url":"Supernet","recorded":1362482979,"links":19,"instances":["routing","computing"],"pdf":["http://faculty.nps.edu/xie/papers/ra-conext11.pdf","http://faculty.nps.edu/xie/papers/ra-conext11.pdf"],"categories":["Network performance","Internet terminology","Routing","Internet architecture"],"headings":["Overview","Protocol requirements","Examples","Risks","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["router","computing"],["convergence","routing"]],"members":["convergence","router"],"related":["Internet_Protocol","Subnetwork","Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing","Internet","IP_address","Router_(computing)","Internet","Subnetwork","Routing_table","Convergence_(routing)","Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing","Interior_Gateway_Routing_Protocol","Exterior_Gateway_Protocol","Routing_Information_Protocol","Enhanced_Interior_Gateway_Routing_Protocol","Open_Shortest_Path_First","Border_Gateway_Protocol","IP_address","Subnetwork","Routing_table","Routing_loop_problem","Provider-aggregatable_address_space","Provider-independent_address_space"]}
