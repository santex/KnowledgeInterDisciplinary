It usually relates to the\nburden which a thing puts on someone trying to explain or understand it.\nSomething which is easy to understand or explain is simple, in contrast to\nsomething complicated. Alternatively, as Herbert A. Simon suggested, something\nis simple or complex depending on the way we choose to describe it...<ref>Simon\n1962, p. 481</ref>\n\nIn some uses, simplicity can be used to imply beauty, purity, or clarity.\nSimplicity may also be used in a negative connotation to denote a deficit or\ninsufficiency of nuance or complexity of a thing, relative to what is supposed\nto be required.\n\nThe concept of simplicity has been related to truth in the field of\nepistemology. According to Occam's razor, all other things being equal, the\nsimplest theory is the most likely to be true. In the context of human\nlifestyle, simplicity can denote freedom from hardship, effort or confusion.\nSpecifically, it can refer to a simple living lifestyle.\n\nSimplicity is a theme in the Christian religion. According to St. Thomas\nAquinas, God is infinitely simple. The Roman Catholic and Anglican religious\norders of Franciscans also strive after simplicity. Members of the Religious\nSociety of Friends (Quakers) practice the Testimony of Simplicity, which is the\nsimplifying of one's life in order to focus on things that are most important\nand disregard or avoid things that are least important.\n\nIn the philosophy of science, simplicity is a meta-scientific criterion by which\nto evaluate competing theories. In this field, a distinction is often made\nbetween two senses of simplicity: syntactic simplicity (the number and\ncomplexity of hypotheses), and ontological simplicity (the number and complexity\nof things postulated). These two aspects of simplicity are often referred to as\nelegance and parsimony\nrespectively.<ref>[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/simplicity/ Stanford\nEncyclopedia of Philosophy entry]</ref>\n","title":"simplicity","headings":["Quotes about Simplicity","Notes","See also","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["2: Herbert_A._Simon","2: Complexity","2: Occam's_razor","2: Simple_living","2: Testimony_of_Simplicity","2: Elegance","2: John_Maeda","1: Beauty","1: Truth","1: Epistemology","1: Christian","1: St._Thomas_Aquinas","1: Divine_simplicity","1: Franciscan","1: Religious_Society_of_Friends","1: Syntactic_simplicity","1: Ontological_simplicity","1: Parsimony","1: Albert_Einstein","1: Leonardo_Da_Vinci","1: William_Golding","1: KISS_principle","1: Minimalism","1: Simplicity_theory","1: Worse_is_better","1: Minimum_message_length","1: Akaike_information_criterion","1: William_Newton-Smith"]}
