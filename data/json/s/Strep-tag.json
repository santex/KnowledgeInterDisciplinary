{"cursor":"8117","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nThe 'Strep-tag'Â® system is a method which allows the purification and detection\nof proteins by affinity chromatography. The Strep-tag is a synthetic peptide\nconsisting of eight amino acids (Trp-Ser-His-Pro-Gln-Phe-Glu-Lys). This peptide\nsequence exhibits intrinsic affinity towards Strep-Tactin, a specifically\nengineered streptavidin and can be N- or C- terminally fused to recombinant\nproteins. By exploiting the highly specific interaction, Strep-tagged proteins\ncan be isolated in one step from crude cell lysates. Because the Strep-tag\nelutes under gentle, physiological conditions it is especially suited for\ngeneration of functional proteins.\n","linknr":163,"url":"Strep-tag","recorded":1362503137,"links":15,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Protein methods","Biotechnology","Molecular biology techniques","Biochemistry","Laboratory techniques"],"headings":["Development and biochemistry of the ''Strep''-tag","The ''Strep''-tag principle","''Strep''-tag applications","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1d/Strep_tag_struktur.jpg/70px-Strep_tag_struktur.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Protein","Affinity_chromatography","Peptide","Amino_acids","Tryptophan","Serine","Histidine","Proline","Gln","Phe","Glutamic_acid","Lysine","Streptavidin","Streptavidin","Biotin","Molecular_biology","Biotechnology","Proteome","His-tag","FLAG-tag","Recombinant_DNA","CDNA","Gene","Yeast","Insect","Mammalian","Inert","Cell_lysate","Buffer_solution","Desthiobiotin","Horseradish_peroxidase","Alkaline_phosphatase","Green_fluorescent_protein","Colony_blot","Dot_blot","Western_blot","ELISA","Expression_clones","Immunocytochemistry","Immunohistochemistry"]}
