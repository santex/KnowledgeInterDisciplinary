{"cursor":"99918","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Sustainability' is the capacity to endure. In ecology the word describes how\nbiological systems remain diverse and productive over time. Long-lived and\nhealthy wetlands and forests are examples of sustainable biological systems. For\nhumans, sustainability is the potential for long-term maintenance of well being,\nwhich has environmental, economic, and social dimensions.\n\nHealthy ecosystems and environments provide vital goods and services to humans\nand other organisms. There are two major ways of reducing negative human impact\nand enhancing ecosystem services and the first of these is environmental\nmanagement. This approach is based largely on information gained from earth\nscience, environmental science and conservation biology. The second approach is\nmanagement of human consumption of resources, which is based largely on\ninformation gained from economics.\n\nSustainability interfaces with economics through the social and ecological\nconsequences of economic activity. Sustainability economics involves ecological\neconomics where social, cultural, health-related and monetary/financial aspects\nare integrated. Moving towards sustainability is also a social challenge that\nentails international and national law, urban planning and transport, local and\nindividual lifestyles and ethical consumerism. Ways of living more sustainably\ncan take many forms from reorganising living conditions (e.g., ecovillages, eco-\nmunicipalities and sustainable cities), reappraising economic sectors\n(permaculture, green building, sustainable agriculture), or work practices\n(sustainable architecture), using science to develop new technologies (green\ntechnologies, renewable energy), to adjustments in individual lifestyles that\nconserve natural resources.\n","linknr":1694,"url":"Sustainable","recorded":1362507904,"links":120,"instances":["conservation","sociology","ecology","economics","ecology"],"pdf":["http://cmsdata.iucn.org/downloads/iucn_future_of_sustanability.pdf","http://data.unaids.org/Topics/UniversalAccess/worldsummitoutcome_resolution_24oct2005_en.pdf","http://www.hks.harvard.edu/sustsci/ists/docs/whatisSD_env_kates_0504.pdf","http://dlc.dlib.indiana.edu/archive/00003398/01/csholling.pdf","http://www.uvm.edu/giee/publications/Beddoe%20et%20al%202009pnas.pdf","http://assets.panda.org/downloads/living_planet_report_2008.pdf","http://www.millenniumassessment.org/documents/document.354.aspx.pdf","http://www.csiro.au/files/files/plje.pdf","http://www.hks.harvard.edu/var/ezp_site/storage/fckeditor/file/pdfs/centers-programs/centers/cid/publications/faculty/wp/213.pdf","http://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/wpp2008/wpp2008_highlights.pdf","http://cc2011.earthsystemgovernance.org/pdf/2011Colora_0110.pdf","http://www.csiro.au/files/files/plje.pdf","http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg1/ar4-wg1-chapter9.pdf","http://www.waterfootprint.org/Reports/Report_20_Global_Water_Governance.pdf","http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/documents/pdf/world.pdf","http://www2.mst.dk/udgiv/publications/2004/87-7614-193-4/pdf/87-7614-194-2.pdf","http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0011/001126/112671Eo.pdf","http://www.eatright.org/ada/files/Conservenp.pdf","http://www.eatright.org/ada/files/Conservenp.pdf","http://www.eurekalert.org/images/release_graphics/pdf/EH5.pdf","http://www.eurekalert.org/images/release_graphics/pdf/EH5.pdf","http://www-personal.umich.edu/~choucc/environmental_impact_of_various_dietary_patterns.pdf","http://www-personal.umich.edu/~choucc/environmental_impact_of_various_dietary_patterns.pdf","http://www.who.int/gb/ebwha/pdf_files/WHA57/A57_R17-en.pdf","http://www.elecan.net/docs/moned/ccto.pdf","http://www.uea.ac.uk/env/cserge/events/grassroots/boyle.pdf","http://www.mtnforum.org/oldocs/407.pdf","http://www.natcapsolutions.org/publications_files/PayingForGrowth_ChronPilot_Sep1997.pdf","http://www.esm.ucsb.edu/academics/courses/289/Readings/Jackson-Clift-1998.pdf","http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/pdf/MDG_Report_2009_ENG.pdf","http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/pdf/MDG_Report_2009_ENG.pdf","http://www.povertyandconservation.info/docs/20080524-UNDP-UNEP_Poverty_Environment_Initiative.pdf","http://www.povertyandconservation.info/docs/20080524-UNDP-UNEP_Poverty_Environment_Initiative.pdf","http://www.gtinitiative.org/documents/Great_Transitions.pdf","http://assets.wwf.org.uk/downloads/weathercocks_report2.pdf","http://cmsdata.iucn.org/downloads/transition_to_sustainability__en__pdf_1.pdf"],"categories":["Sustainability|","Environmental
