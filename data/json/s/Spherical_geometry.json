Two practical\napplications of the principles of spherical geometry are to navigation and\nastronomy.\n\nIn plane geometry the basic concepts are points and (straight) lines. On the\nsphere, points are defined in the usual sense. The equivalents of lines are not\ndefined in the usual sense of \"straight line\" in Euclidean geometry but in the\nsense of \"the shortest paths between points,\" which are called geodesics. On the\nsphere the geodesics are the great circles; other geometric concepts are defined\nas in plane geometry but with straight lines replaced by great circles. Thus, in\nspherical geometry angles are defined between great circles, resulting in a\nspherical trigonometry that differs from ordinary trigonometry in many respects;\nfor example, the sum of the interior angles of a triangle exceeds 180 degrees.\n\nSpherical geometry is not elliptic geometry but shares with that geometry the\nproperty that a line has no parallels through a given point. Contrast this with\nEuclidean geometry, in which a line has one parallel through a given point, and\nhyperbolic geometry, in which a line has two parallels and an infinite number of\nultraparallels through a given point.\n\nAn important geometry related to that of the sphere is that of the real\nprojective plane; it is obtained by identifying antipodal points (pairs of\nopposite points) on the sphere. (This is elliptic geometry.) Locally, the\nprojective plane has all the properties of spherical geometry, but it has\ndifferent global properties. In particular, it is non-orientable, or one-sided.\n\nConcepts of spherical geometry may also be applied to the oblong sphere, though\nminor modifications must be implemented on certain formulas.\n\nHigher-dimensional spherical geometries exist; see elliptic geometry.\n","linknr":182,"url":"Spherical_geometry","recorded":1362672667,"links":42,"instances":["geometry","mathematics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Classical geometry","Spherical geometry|","Spherical trigonometry","Spherical astronomy"],"headings":["History","Relation to Euclid's postulates","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/97/Triangles_%28spherical_geometry%29.jpg/350px-Triangles_%28spherical_geometry%29.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["point","geometry"],["line","mathematics"]],"members":["point","line"],"related":["Geometry","Dimension","Sphere","Geometry","Navigation","Astronomy","Plane_geometry","Point_(geometry)","Line_(mathematics)","Geodesic","Great_circle","Angle","Spherical_trigonometry","Trigonometry","Triangle","Elliptic_geometry","Euclidean_geometry","Hyperbolic_geometry","Real_projective_plane","Antipodal_point","Orientability","Elliptic_geometry","Greek_mathematics","Menelaus_of_Alexandria","Menelaus'_theorem","Al-Jayyani","Regiomontanus","Gerolamo_Cardano","Jabir_ibn_Aflah","Euclid's_postulates","Antipodal_point","Parallel_postulate","Timothy_Gowers","Great-circle_distance","Spherical_polyhedron","Half-side_formula","Lenart_Sphere","Rice_University"]}
