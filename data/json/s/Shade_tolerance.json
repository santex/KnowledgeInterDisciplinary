{"cursor":"6051","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nIn ecology, 'shade tolerance' is a plant's abilities to tolerate low light\nlevels. The term is also used in horticulture and landscaping, although in this\ncontext its use is sometimes sloppy, especially with respect to labeling of\nplants for sale in nurseries.\n\nShade tolerance is a relative term, and its use and meaning depends on context.\nOne can compare large trees to each other, but when comparing understory trees\nand shrubs, or non-woody plants, the term takes on a different meaning. Even in\na specific context, shade tolerance is not a single variable or simple\ncontinuum, but rather a complex, multi-faceted property of plants, since\ndifferent plants exhibit different adaptations to shade. In fact, the same plant\ncan exhibit varying degrees of shade tolerance or even of requirement for light,\ndepending on its history or stage of development.\n","linknr":124,"url":"Shade_tolerance","recorded":1362538120,"links":13,"instances":["ecology","horticulture"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Plant physiology","Forest ecology"],"headings":["Basic concepts","Herbaceous plants","Trees","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/44/Tsuga_canadensis2.jpg/220px-Tsuga_canadensis2.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf8/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["nursery","horticulture"],["disturbance","ecology"]],"members":["disturbance","nursery"],"related":["Ecology","Plant","Light","Horticulture","Landscaping","Nursery_(horticulture)","Trees","Understory","Shrub","Adaptation","Shade","Parasitic_plants","Desiccation","UV_ray","Pigment","Energy","Limiting_factor","Soil","Nutrient","Leaves","Frost","Winter_annuals","Flower","Vine","Araceae","Rainfall","Eastern_Hemlock","Germinate","Root","Sugar_Maple","Willow","Aspen","Wetland","Disturbance_(ecology)","List_of_shade-tolerant_species"]}
