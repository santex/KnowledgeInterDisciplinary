{"cursor":"8341","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" script]]\n\nIn Unicode, a 'script' is a collection of letters and other written signs used\nto represent textual information in one or more writing\nsystems. [http://unicode.org/glossary/ Glossary of Unicode Terms] Some\nscripts support one and only one writing system and language, for example,\nArmenian. Other scripts support many different writing systems; for example, the\nLatin script supports English, French, German, Italian, Vietnamese, Latin\nitself, and several other languages. Some languages make use of multiple\nalternate writing systems, thus also use several scripts. In Turkish, the Arabic\nscript was used before the 20th century, but transitioned to Latin in the early\npart of the 20th century. For a list of languages supported by each script see\nthe list of languages by writing system.\n\nComplementary are the '[[Unicode symbols]]': scripts and symbols cover all\nUnicode characters. The unified diacritical characters and unified punctuation\ncharacters frequently have the \"common\" or \"inherited\" script property. However,\nthe individual scripts often have their own punctuation and diacritics. So many\nscripts include not only letters, but also diacritic and other marks,\npunctuation, numerals and even their own idiosyncratic symbols and space\ncharacters.\n\nUnicode 6.1 includes 28 ancient and historic scripts and 72 modern scripts. More\nscripts are in the process for encoding, called roadmap.\n","linknr":541,"url":"Script_(Unicode)","recorded":1362482550,"links":20,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode5.2.0/ch14.pdf"],"categories":["Unicode|Scripts"],"headings":["Definition and classification","Character categories within scripts","Table of scripts in Unicode","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ce/Armenian_language_in_the_Armenian_alphabet.svg/220px-Armenian_language_in_the_Armenian_alphabet.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Unicode","Armenian_language","Latin_characters_in_Unicode","English_alphabet","French_alphabet","German_alphabet","Italian_alphabet","Vietnamese_language","Latin_alphabet","Turkish_language","Ottoman_Turkish_alphabet","List_of_languages_by_writing_system","Swedish_alphabet","Universal_Character_Set","ISO_15924","Writing_system","Kanji","Hiragana","Katakana","Complex_system","Precomposed_character","Mapping_of_Unicode_characters","Unicode_Symbols"]}
