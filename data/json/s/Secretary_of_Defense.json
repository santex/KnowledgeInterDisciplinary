This position corresponds to what is generally known as a\nDefense Minister in many other countries.

The\nSecretary of Defense is appointed by the President with the advice and consent\nof the Senate, and is by custom a member of the Cabinet and by law a member of\nthe National Security Council. .\n\nSecretary of Defense is a statutory office, and the general provision in\nprovides that the Secretary of Defense has \"authority, direction and control\nover the Department of Defense\", and is further designated by the same statute\nas \"the principal assistant to the President in all matters relating to the\nDepartment of Defense.\" Ensuring civilian control of the military, an\nindividual may not be appointed as Secretary of Defense within seven years after\nrelief from active duty as a commissioned officer of a regular (i.e., non-\nreserve) component of an armed force. The National Security Act of 1947\noriginally required an interval of ten years after relief from active duty,\nwhich was reduced to seven years by Sec. 903(a) of the 2008 National Defense\nAuthorization Act. In 1950 Congress passed special legislation (Pub. Law 81-788)\nto allow George C. Marshall to serve as Secretary of Defense while remaining a\ncommissioned officer on the active list of the Army (Army regulations kept all\nfive-star generals on active duty for life), but warned:\n\nIt is hereby expressed as the intent of the Congress that the\nauthority granted by this Act is not to be construed as approval by the Congress\nof continuing appointments of military men to the office of Secretary of Defense\nin the future. It is hereby expressed as the sense of the Congress that after\nGeneral Marshall leaves the office of Secretary of Defense, no additional\nappointments of military men to that office shall be approved.\n\nSee [http://www.defenselink.mil/specials/secdef_histories/bios/marshall.htm\nDefenselink bio], retrieved 8/2/2010; and\n[http://www.marshallfoundation.org/about/chronology.html Marshall Foundation\nbio], retrieved 8/2/2010.\n\nThe Secretary of Defense is in the chain of command and exercises command and\ncontrol, subject only to the orders of the President, over all Department of\nDefense forces (the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps) for both\noperational and administrative purposes. Joint Publication 1:\nII-9, II-10 & II-11. Only the Secretary\nof Defense (or the President) can authorize the transfer of operational control\nof forces between the three Military Departments (the departments of the Army,\nNavy, and Air Force) and the nine Combatant Commands (Africa Command, Central\nCommand, European Command, Northern Command, Pacific Command, Southern Command,\nSpecial Operations Command, Strategic Command, Transportation Command). Because the Office of Secretary of Defense is\nvested with legal powers which exceeds those of any commissioned officer, and is\nsecond only to the President in the military hierarchy, it has sometimes\nunofficially been referred to as a [[de facto]] \"deputy commander-in-chief\".
