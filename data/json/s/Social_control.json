Sociologists identify two basic forms of social control:\n# 'Informal means of control' - Internalisation of norms and values by a process\n# known as socialization, which is defined as \"the process by which an\n# individual, born with behavioral potentialities of enormously wide range, is\n# led to develop actual behavior which is confined to the narrower range of what\n# is acceptable for him by the group standards.\" Lindzey, Gardner (Ed),\n# (1954). Handbook of social psychology. I. Theory and method. II. Special\n# fields and applications. (2 vols)., (pp. II, 655-692). Oxford, England: Addison-\n# Wesley Publishing Co., xx, 1226 pp. 'Formal means of social control' -\n# External sanctions enforced by government to prevent the establishment of\n# chaos or anomie in society. Some theorists, such as Ãmile Durkheim, refer to\n# this form of control as regulation.\n\nWhile the concept of social control has been around since the formation of\norganized sociology, the meaning has been altered over time. Originally, the\nconcept simply referred to society's ability to regulate itself.
