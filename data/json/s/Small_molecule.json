{"cursor":"8379","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In the fields of pharmacology and biochemistry, a 'small molecule' is a low\nmolecular weight (\n\nThe upper molecular weight limit for a small molecule is approximately 800\nDaltons which allows for the possibility to rapidly diffuse across cell\nmembranes so that they can reach intracellular sites of action. In addition, this molecular weight cutoff is a\nnecessary but insufficient condition for oral bioavailability. Finally, a lower\nmaximum molecular weight of 500 Daltons (as part of the \"rule of five\") has been\nrecommended for small molecule drug development candidates based on the\nobservation that clinical attrition rates are signficantly reduced if the\nmolecular weight is kept below this 500 Dalton limit.\n\nSmall molecules can have a variety of biological functions, serving as cell\nsignaling molecules, as tools in molecular biology, as drugs in medicine, as\npesticides in farming, and in many other roles. These compounds can be natural\n(such as secondary metabolites) or artificial (such as antiviral drugs); they\nmay have a beneficial effect against a disease (such as drugs) or may be\ndetrimental (such as teratogens and carcinogens).\n\nBiopolymers such as nucleic acids, proteins, and polysaccharides (such as starch\nor cellulose) are not small molecules, although their constituent monomers â ribo-\nor deoxyribonucleotides, amino acids, and monosaccharides, respectively â are\noften considered to be. Very small oligomers are also usually considered small\nmolecules, such as dinucleotides, peptides such as the antioxidant glutathione,\nand disaccharides such as sucrose.\n","linknr":224,"url":"Small_molecule","recorded":1362508037,"links":17,"instances":["biology","biochemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Plant physiology","Drugs"],"headings":["Drugs","Primary and secondary metabolites","Research tools","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/Regen2.svg/200px-Regen2.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["effector","biology"],["ligand","biochemistry"],["ligand","biochemistry"]],"members":["effector","ligand"],"related":["Pharmacology","Biochemistry","Atomic_mass_unit","Organic_compound","Enzyme","Biopolymer","Protein","Nucleic_acid","Polysaccharide","Effector_(biology)","Intracellular","Bioavailability","Rule_of_five","Cell_signaling","Molecular_biology","Drug","Medicine","Pesticide","Farming","Secondary_metabolites","Antiviral_drug","Pharmaceuticals","Teratogen","Carcinogen","Nucleic_acid","Protein","Polysaccharides","Starch","Cellulose","Amino_acid","Oligomer","Peptides","Glutathione","Sucrose","Pharmaceuticals","Insulin","Cell_membrane","Prodrug","Biologic_medical_product","Dietary_supplement","Ginkgo_biloba","Nearly_neutral_theory_of_molecular_evolution","Streptomyces","Antibiotics","Secondary_metabolite","Alkaloids","Glycosides","Lipids","Nonribosomal_peptide","Actinomycin-D","Phenazines","Natural_phenol","Flavonoid","Polyketide","Terpenes","Steroid","Tetrapyrroles","Islets_of_Langerhans","Mesoderm","Stem_cells","Retinoic_acid","Sonic_hedgehog","Growth_medium","Antibodies","HHIP","Cyclopamine","Ligand_(biochemistry)","Enzyme_inhibitor","Enzyme_inhibitor","Active_site","Allosteric_regulation","Phorbol_12-myristate_13-acetate","Protein_kinase_C","Artificial_transcription_factors","Gene_expression","Ligand_(biochemistry)","Surface_plasmon_resonance","Microscale_thermophoresis","Dual_polarisation_interferometry","Conformational_change","Metabolite","Chemogenomics","Neurotransmitter","Peptidomimetic"]}
