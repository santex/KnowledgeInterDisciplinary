{"cursor":"27361","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Special Operations Capable' refers to special tasks that the tangible Marine\nAir-Ground Task Force units are capable in providing to the Fleet Marine Force\n(FMF), or foreign uniformed services of maritime regions worldwide. These task\nare similar to the roles that the United States Special Operations Forces are\noperationally responsible in providing the United States Special Operations\nCommand (USSOCOM).\n\nTraditionally, the United States Marine Corps has been at the forefront of the\nUnited States's exceptional elite warriors. Major\nW. J. Morrissey, United States Army Reserve;\n[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/1992/MWJ.htm \"The USMC\nSpecial Operations Capable (SOC) Concept: An Alternative Approach,\"] (CSC\n1992) The special operations-type units within the Marine Corps eschewed\nthe idea of being referred or compared to the traditional special operations\nforces (SOF) of the United States Special Operations Command due to the ''ad\nhoc'' idealism the Marines are traditionally known to carryâbeing special\noperations capable is temporary to their protocol.\n\nThe Marine Corps's specialized units have always yielded performance and mission\nplans that distinguish them from the United States Special Operations Forces.\nOne significant detail is that the Marine Corps solely manages their battlespace\nshaping methods mainly in the aspect of conventional warfare. Most of the SOFs\ninvolved in USSOCOM however are more directed in unconventional warfare. Every\nSOC [special operations capable] unit that existed in the Marine Corps are\nversatile enough to be capable in conducting special operations under\n'unconventional' methods while engaging on a 'conventional' battlefield. While\nnot specifically a Secretary of Defense-designated U.S. Special Operations\nForce, when directed by the National Command Authority and/or the force\ncommander, the Fleet Marine Force may conduct special operations under\ncircumstances where designated special operations forces are not available.\n\nIn February 2006, the Marine Corps made its first commitment to the USSOCOM\ncommunity in cause of the establishment of the Marine Special Operations\nCommand, or MARSOC. This new commitment allowed MARSOC to form the Marine\nSpecial Operation Teams (MSOT), assigned under the Marine Special Operation\nBattalions, or MSOBs. The MSOTs are the Marine Corps's first SOF unit to be\ntrained and reserved for missions specifically regarding unconventional methods,\nwhich consequently disbanded the FMF's Force Reconnaissance companies to make\nway for the MSOTs' fully committed direct action capabilities. Many force\nreconnaissance operators were used to form the MSOTs, the rest were folded into\nthe division-level recon units. The Deep Recon Platoons (DRP) were created to\nmaintain the deep reconnaissance capabilities for the Marine Air-Ground Task\nForce (MAGTF) commanders.\n\nTherefore, the joint-Navy/Marine Corps's Fleet Marine Force is the proponent\nservice for all special operations missions involving maneuverability from the\nsea. Historians can trace the evolution of the Corpsâs specialized amphibious\nwarfare since its formation, traditionally being tasked in conducting\nspecialized missions conformed to maritime environments. The U.S. Marines and\nsailors are already equipped and well-prepared because of their expeditionary\ncapabilities that are well-known to the community.\n","linknr":351,"url":"Special_Operations_Capable","recorded":1362664963,"links":15,"instances":["united_states_marine_corps","north_carolina","military","military"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Special forces","United States Marine Corps organization"],"headings":["Concept","Special Operations Capable (SOC)","Pre-deployment Training Program (PTP)","Special-operations-capable forces","See also","Notes"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/Marine_corps_flag.svg/22px-Marine_corps_flag.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/USMC_logo.svg/80px-USMC_logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg/16px-Portal-puzzle.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["direct_action","military"],["command_and_control","military"],["direct_action","military"],["command_element","united_states_marine_corps"],["fort_bragg","north_carolina"]],"members":["command_element","fort_bragg","command_and_control","direct_action"],"related":["Special_operations","Marine_Air-Ground_Task_Force","Fleet_Marine_Force","Uniformed_services","Ocean","United_States_Special_Operations_Forces","United_States_Special_Operations_Command","United_States_Marine_Corps","United_States","Special_forces","United_States_Special_Operations_Command","Culture_of_the_United_States_Marine_Corps","United_States_Special_Operations_Forces","Battlespace","Conventional_warfare","Unconventional_warfare","Secretary_of_Defense","National_Command_Authority","Force_commander","Fleet_Marine_Force","Special_operations","United_States_Marine_Corps_Forces_Special_Operations_Command","United_States_Marine_Corps_Force_Reconnaissance","United_States_Marine_Corps_Reconnaissance_Battalions","Deep_reconnaissance","Marine_Air-Ground_Task_Force","Amphibious_warfare","Expeditionary_maneuver_warfare","United_States_Department_of_the_Navy","United_States_Department_of_Defense","Marine_Raiders","World_War_II","Direct_action_(military)","Paramarines","Terrorism","Amphibious_warfare","Expeditionary_warfare","Modern_warfare","Deputy_Secretary_of_Defense","William_Howard_Taft_IV","Cold_War","Mid_Intensity_Conflict","Low_intensity_conflict","Humanitarianism","Emergency_management","United_States_Army","United_States_Navy","Maneuver_warfare","United_States_Armed_Forces","President_of_the_United_States","Advanced_Base_Force","P._X._Kelley","Marine_Air-Ground_Task_Force","National_Command_Authority","Joint_Special_Operations_Command","Marine_Expeditionary_Force","Land_warfare","Aerial_warfare","Conventional_warfare","C4ISTAR","Command_and_control_(military)","Non-combatant_evacuation_operation","Show_of_force","Maritime_Security_Operations","Mobile_Security_Deployment","Civil-military_operations","Humanitarianism","Civil_Assistance","Emergency_management","Military_deception","Fire_support","Counter-intelligence","Electronic_warfare","Signals_intelligence","Communications_security","Military_Operations_in_Urban_Terrain","Special_Operations_Forces","Special_operations","Close_Quarters_Battle","Direct_action_(military)","Precision-guided_munition","Personnel_recovery","Oil_platform","Maritime_Interdiction_Operations","Visit,_board,_search,_and_seizure","Reconnaissance","Surveillance","Marine_Air-Ground_Task_Force","Command_element_(United_States_Marine_Corps)","Maritime_Special_Purpose_Force","Expeditionary_Strike_Group","Special_Operations_Training_Group","PHIBRON","United_States_Naval_Special_Warfare_Command","Headquarters_Marine_Corps","United_States_Marine_Corps_Forces_Command","Maritime_Special_Purpose_Force","Command_and_Control","Amphibious_Squadron","Urban_warfare","Special_Operations_Training_Group","Municipal","U.S._state","Federal_government_of_the_United_States","List_of_United_States_state_and_local_law_enforcement_agencies","Fire_departments","Federal_Aviation_Administration","Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation","Humanitarian_intervention","Close_quarters_combat","Special_operations","Amphibious_Squadron","Fort_Bragg_(North_Carolina)","Joint_Special_Operations_Command","United_States_Department_of_State","Joint_Chiefs_of_Staff","Headquarters_Marine_Corps","Central_Intelligence_Agency","Washington_D.C.","Unified_Combatant_Command","Marine_Expeditionary_Unit","Special_Operations_Forces","United_States_Special_Operations_Command","United_States_Special_Operations_Forces","United_States_Marine_Corps_Forces_Special_Operations_Command"]}
