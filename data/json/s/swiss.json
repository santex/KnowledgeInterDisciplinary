See Geography of\nSwitzerland#Western or Central Europe?.</ref> where it is bordered by Germany to\nthe north, France to the west, Italy to the south, and Austria and Liechtenstein\nto the east.\n\nSwitzerland is a landlocked country geographically divided between the Alps, the\nSwiss Plateau and the Jura, spanning an area of . While the Alps occupy the\ngreater part of the territory, the Swiss population of approximately 8 million\npeople is concentrated mostly on the Plateau, where the largest cities are to be\nfound. Among them are the two global cities and economic centres - Zurich and\nGeneva. The Swiss Confederation has a long history of armed neutrality—it has\nnot been in a state of war internationally since 1815—and did not join the\nUnited Nations until 2002. It pursues, however, an active foreign policy and is\nfrequently involved in peace-building processes around the world.<ref>Thomas\nFleiner, Alexander Misic, Nicole Töpperwien, Swiss Constitutional Law, p. 28,\nKluwer Law International</ref> Switzerland is also the birthplace of the Red\nCross and home to a large number of international organizations, including the\nsecond largest UN office. On the European level, it is a founding member of the\nEuropean Free Trade Association and is part of the Schengen Area – although it\nis notably not a member of the European Union, nor the European Economic Area.\n\nSwitzerland is one of the richest countries in the world by per capita gross\ndomestic product, and has the highest wealth per adult (financial and non-\nfinancial assets) of any country in the world.<ref name=\"Digitaljournal.com\"></-\nref><ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2011/oct/19/currency-appreciation-\nmakes-swiss-wealthiest Franc's rise puts Swiss top of rich list] Simon Bowers,\nguardian.co.uk, Wednesday 19 October 2011</ref> Zurich and Geneva have\nrespectively been ranked as the cities with the second and eighth highest\nquality of life in the world.<ref></ref> It has the world's nineteenth largest\neconomy by nominal GDP and the thirty-sixth largest by purchasing power parity.\nIt is the twentieth largest exporter and eighteenth largest importer of goods.\n\nSwitzerland comprises four main linguistic and cultural regions: German, French,\nItalian, to which the Romansh-speaking valleys are added.
