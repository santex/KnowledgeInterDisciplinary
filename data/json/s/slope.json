A higher slope value indicates a steeper incline. Slope is\nnormally described by the ratio of the \"rise\" divided by the \"run\" between two\npoints on a line. The line may be practical - as set by a road surveyor : or in\na diagram that models a road or a roof either as a description or as a plan.\n\nThe rise of a road between two points is the difference between the altitude of\nthe road at those two points, say y<sub>1</sub> and y<sub>2</sub>, or in other\nwords, the rise is (y<sub>2</sub> − y<sub>1</sub>) = Δy. For relatively short\ndistances - where the earth's curvature may be neglected, the run is the\ndifference in distance from a fixed point measured along a level, horizontal\nline, or in other words, the run is (x<sub>2</sub> − x<sub>1</sub>) = Δx. Here\nthe slope of the road between the two points is simply described as the ratio of\nthe altitude change to the horizontal distance between any two points on the\nline. In mathematical language, the slope m of the line is\n:<math>m=\\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}.</math>\n\nThe concept of slope applies directly to grades or gradients in geography and\ncivil engineering. Through trigonometry, the grade m of a road is related to its\nangle of incline θ by\n:<math>m = \\tan \\theta\\!</math> (from the definition of tangent).\n\nAs a generalization of this practical description, the mathematics of\ndifferential calculus defines the slope of a curve at a point as the slope of\nthe tangent line at that point. When the curve given by a series of points in a\ndiagram or in a list of the coordinates of points, the slope may be calculated\nnot at a point but between any two given points. When the curve is given as a\ncontinuous function, perhaps as an algebraic formula, then the differential\ncalculus provides rules giving a formula for the slope of the curve at any point\nin the middle of the curve.\n\nThis generalization of the concept of slope allows very complex constructions to\nbe planned and built that go well beyond static structures that are either\nhorizontals or verticals, but can change in time, move in curves, and change\ndepending on the rate of change of other factors. Thereby, the simple idea of\nslope becomes one of the main basis of the modern world in terms of both\ntechnology and the built environment.\n","title":"slope","headings":["Definition","Geometry","Slope of a road or railway","Algebra","Calculus","See also","The [[gradient]] is a generalization of the concept of slope for functions of more than one variable.","External links"]},"micro-relation":["3: Differential_calculus","3: Tangent","2: Trigonometry","2: Curve","2: Per_mil","1: Mathematics","1: Gradient","1: Geography","1: Civil_engineering","1: Trigonometric_functions#Sine,_cosine_and_tangent","1: Division_by_zero","1: Infinity","1: Perpendicular","1: Road","1: Rail_tracks","1: Steep_grade_railway","1: Rack_railway","1: Percent_sign","1: Netherlands","1: Poland","1: Czech_Republic","1: Meols_railway_station","1: United_Kingdom","1: Linear_function","1: Y-intercept","1: Linear_equation#Pointâslope_form","1: Linear_equation","1: Positive_number","1: Negative_number","1: Derivative","1: Secant_line","1: Mean_value_theorem","1: Limit_of_a_function","1: Zero","1: Euclidean_distance","1: Inclined_plane","1: Trigonometric_function#Slope_definitions","1: TheilâSen_estimator","1: Median"]}
