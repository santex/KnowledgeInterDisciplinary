{"cursor":"15452","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'scrub', also called \"scrub tech,\" \"surgical technician,\" or \"operating room\ntechnician\", is an allied health professional working as a part of the team\ndelivering surgical care. They possess knowledge and skills in sterile and\naseptic techniques. There are few mandatory professional requirements for\nsurgical technologists, and the scope of practice varies widely across countries\nand jurisdictions. Surgical technologists attend junior colleges and technical\nschools, and many are trained in military training schools. In the military they\nperform the duties of both the circulator and the scrub. The bulk of training is\ndone in the operating room, and they are trained by giving them progressively\nmore difficult surgical cases to scrub, until they are able to scrub all types\nof surgical procedures, this can take a few years. The goal is for surgical\ntechnologists to be able to anticipate the next move the surgeon is going to\nmake in order to make the procedure as smooth and efficient as possible.\n\nIn the United States, surgical technologists are unlicensed assistive personnel\nwho work under the supervision of a surgeon, registered nurse (RN), or other\nsurgical personnel (such as a more senior Technologists), to help ensure that\nthe operating room or environment is safe, that equipment functions properly,\nand that the operative procedure is conducted under conditions that maximize\npatient safety. They handle the instruments, scrubs, medications, and other\nsupplies and equipment necessary during the surgical procedure. They perform\nbasic tasks such as checking patients' medical charts and consent forms,\npreparing sterile dressings, and closing incisions. Surgical Technologists also\ntrain other OR personnel such as new technologists and new circulating RNs.

professions with similar titles include 'Clinical officers',\n'Clinical associates', or 'Assistant Medical Officers', but which can mean\ndifferent things subject to local
