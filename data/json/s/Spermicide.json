As a contraceptive,\nspermicide may be used alone. However, the pregnancy rate experienced by couples\nusing only spermicide is higher than that of couples using other methods.\nUsually, spermicides are combined with contraceptive barrier methods such as\ndiaphragms, condoms, cervical caps, and sponges. Combined methods are believed\nto result in lower pregnancy rates than either method alone.\n\nSpermicides are unscented, clear, unflavored, non-staining, and lubricative.\n","linknr":353,"url":"Spermicide","recorded":1362512395,"links":31,"instances":["greek_physician","contraceptive"],"pdf":["http://www.aids.net.au/aids-lemons.pdf","http://www.aids.net.au/aids-lemons.pdf"],"categories":["Spermicide|","Personal lubricants","Drugs acting on the genito-urinary system","Biocides"],"headings":["Types and effectiveness","Use with condoms","Side effects","History","See also","Footnotes"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/Mergefrom.svg/50px-Mergefrom.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["diaphragm","contraceptive"],["soranus","greek_physician"]],"members":["soranus","diaphragm"],"related":["Spermatozoon","Barrier_method","Diaphragm_(contraceptive)","Condom","Cervical_cap","Contraceptive_sponge","Nonoxynol-9","Centers_for_Disease_Control","Octoxynol-9","Benzalkonium_chloride","Contraceptive_sponge","Ig_Nobel_Prize","Parody","Nobel_Prize","Spermicide","New_England_Journal_of_Medicine","Massachusetts_Medical_Society","Macmillan_Publishers","Snopes","Krest","Lactic_acid","Neem","Neem_oil","Neem","World_Health_Organization","Nonoxynol-9","Urinary_tract_infection","Candidiasis","Bacterial_vaginosis","Kahun_Papyrus","Pessary","PH","Ebers_Papyrus","Lactic_acid","Soranus_(Greek_physician)","Comstock_laws","Lysol","Douche","Personal_lubricant"]}
