{"cursor":"3161","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"Single}}\n\nIn baseball, a 'single' is the most common type of base hit, accomplished\nthrough the act of a batter safely reaching first base by hitting a fair ball\n(thus becoming a runner) and getting to first base before a fielder puts him\nout. As an exception, a batter-runner reaching first base safely is not\ncredited with a single when an infielder attempts to put out another runner on\nthe first play; this is one type of a fielder's choice. Also, a batter-runner\nreaching first base on a play due to a fielder's error trying to put him out\nat first base or another runner out (as a fielder's choice) is not credited\nwith a single.\n\nOn a single hit to the outfield, any runners on second base or third base\nnormally score, and sometimes the runner from first base is able to advance to\nthird base. Depending on the location of the hit, a quick recovery by the\noutfielder can prevent such an advance or create a play on the advancing runner.\n\nHitters who focus on hitting singles rather than doubles or home runs are often\ncalled \"contact hitters\". Contact hitters who rely on positioning their hits\nwell and having fast running speed to achieve singles are often called \"slap\nhitters\". Ty Cobb, Pete Rose, Tony Gwynn, and Ichiro Suzuki are examples of\ncontact hitters; of these, Rose and Suzuki might be called slap hitters. \n","linknr":336,"url":"Single_(baseball)","recorded":1362478804,"links":19,"instances":["baseball","baseball","baseball"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Baseball terminology","Batting statistics"],"headings":["Symbol","Singles leaders, Major League Baseball","See also"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["hit","baseball"],["batting","baseball"],["strike","baseball"]],"members":["batting","strike","hit"],"related":["Baseball","Hit_(baseball)","Batting_(baseball)","First_base","Fair_ball","Becoming_a_runner","Fielder's_choice","Outfield","Second_base","Third_base","Tag_play","Ty_Cobb","Pete_Rose","Tony_Gwynn","Ichiro_Suzuki","First_baseman","First_base","Strike_(baseball)","Pete_Rose","Ty_Cobb","Eddie_Collins","Cap_Anson","Willie_Keeler","Derek_Jeter","Honus_Wagner","Rod_Carew","Tris_Speaker","Tony_Gwynn","Ichiro_Suzuki","Willie_Keeler","1898_in_baseball","Ichiro_Suzuki","Lloyd_Waner","Willie_Keeler","1897_in_baseball","Infield_hit"]}
