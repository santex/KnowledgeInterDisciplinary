Central to this belief system is the idea that certain foods have a\n\"hot\" or heat-inducing quality while others have a \"cold\" or chilling effect on\nthe body and its organs and fluids. An imbalance of this \"heat\" and \"cold\" is\nsaid to increase susceptibility to sickness or to directly cause disease itself.\nSuch an imbalance is not necessarily related to the subjective feeling of being\nhot (tending toward sweating) or cold (tending toward shivering).\n\nAs an example, if one had a cold, or felt he was about to get a cold, he would\nnot want to eat any \"cold\" foods such as a lemon, melon or cucumber. If one had\na so-called \"hot\" disease, like Eczema, then he would not want to eat \"hot\"\nfoods such as garlic, onions, or chocolate lest the \"hot\" disease is worsened.\nIndeed, it is thought by some that these \"hot\" or \"cold\" properties of foods are\nso intense that merely the eating of too many of one or another can actually\ncause diseases. For example, the eating of too many \"hot\" foods like chili\npeppers or lobster could cause a rash, or the eating of too many \"cold\" foods\nsuch as watermelon, or seaweed could cause one to develop stomach pain or\ndiarrhea. In this way, this health system is in direct opposition to evidence-\nbased medicine and the germ theory of disease (where microbes are described as\nthe cause of many disease states). It is related to the concept of 內外\"邪\" nèi-\nwàixié in Chinese medicine, being more aligned with Claude Bernard, and Antoine\nBechamp's biological terrain theory of disease.\n\nThis belief in foods having inherent \"hot\" or \"cold\" properties is prevalent\nthroughout greater China and significant in Cantonese culture. [[Congee]] or\njook (Mandarin \"zhou\") is commonly used as a panacea and recipes vary, depending\nupon the desired health benefits.\n\nChinese food therapy is said to date back as early as 2000 BC, though\ndocumentary evidence goes only to about 500 BC. The Yellow Emperor's Classic of\nInternal Medicine, also known as the [[Huangdi Neijing]], which was written\naround 300 BC, was most important in forming the basis of Chinese food therapy.\nIt classified food by four food groups, five tastes and by their natures and\ncharacteristics.\n","title":"Chinese food therapy%23Cantonese classification of food","headings":["Philosophy about food","Cantonese classification of food","Some common food therapy items and recipes","See also","External links"]},"micro-relation":["3: Ginseng","2: Yin_and_yang","2: Double_steaming","1: Nutrition","1: Traditional_Chinese_medicine","1: Eczema","1: Evidence-based_medicine","1: Germ_theory_of_disease","1: Cantonese_cuisine","1: Food_energy","1: Lychee","1: Crataegus_pinnatifida","1: Winter_melon","1: Longan","1: Dioscorea_opposita","1: Qi","1: Bird_nest_soup","1: Swiftlet","1: Yin_Yang","1: Samgyetang","1: Wisconsin","1: Watercress","1: Almond","1: Chinese_cuisine","1: Chinese_herbology","1: List_of_food_origins","1: Taoist_diet","1: Traditional_Chinese_Medicine","1: Macrobiotic_diet"]}
