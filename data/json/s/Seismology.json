{"cursor":"20163","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Seismology' () is the scientific study of earthquakes and the propagation of\nelastic waves through the Earth or through other planet-like bodies. The field\nalso includes studies of earthquake effects, such as tsunamis as well as diverse\nseismic sources such as volcanic, tectonic, oceanic, atmospheric, and artificial\nprocesses (such as explosions). A related field that uses geology to infer\ninformation regarding past earthquakes is paleoseismology. A recording of earth\nmotion as a function of time is called a seismogram. A seismologist is a\nscientist who does research in seismology.\n","linknr":476,"url":"Seismology","recorded":1362267850,"links":83,"instances":["geology","educator","geology","physics"],"pdf":["https://engineering.purdue.edu/~ce597m/Handouts/ConciseHistory_BenMenahem.pdf","https://engineering.purdue.edu/~ce597m/Handouts/ConciseHistory_BenMenahem.pdf","http://www.gps.caltech.edu/uploads/File/People/kanamori/HKees03.pdf","http://www.gps.caltech.edu/uploads/File/People/kanamori/HKees03.pdf","http://www.iris.edu/hq/lrsps/seis_plan_final.pdf","http://www.iris.edu/hq/lrsps/seis_plan_final.pdf","http://geophysics.geo.sunysb.edu/wen/Reprints/WenHelmberger98Science.pdf","http://geophysics.geo.sunysb.edu/wen/Reprints/WenHelmberger98Science.pdf"],"categories":["Seismology|","Earthquake engineering|"],"headings":["Highlights of the history of seismology","Types of seismic wave","Earthquakes","Controlled seismic sources","Detection of seismic waves","Mapping the earth's interior","Seismology and society","Tools","Notable seismologists","See also","Notes","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a6/Seismogram.gif/220px-Seismogram.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c8/Earthquake_wave_paths.svg/220px-Earthquake_wave_paths.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["compression","geology"],["shearing","physics"],["rock","geology"],["john_winthrop","educator"]],"members":["compression","john_winthrop","rock","shearing"],"related":["Earthquake","Earth","Tsunamis","Seismic_source","Geology","Paleoseismology","Seismogram","Thales","Anaximenes_of_Miletus","Aristotle","Zhang_Heng","Zhang_Heng","Han_dynasty","Athanasius_Kircher","Martin_Lister","Nicolas_Lemery","1755_Lisbon_earthquake","John_Bevis","John_Michell","Robert_Mallet","Emil_Wiechert","Structure_of_the_Earth","Richard_Dixon_Oldham","Harry_Fielding_Reid","Elastic-rebound_theory","Harold_Jeffreys","Inge_Lehmann","Plate_tectonics","Elastic_waves","P-wave","S-wave","P-wave","Longitudinal_wave","Compression_(geology)","Rarefaction","Seismogram","S-waves","Transverse_wave","Shearing_(physics)","Rayleigh_wave","Love_wave","Normal_modes","Great_Chilean_Earthquake","Good_Friday_Earthquake","1755_Lisbon_earthquake","1857_Basilicata_earthquake","1906_San_Francisco_earthquake","1964_Alaska_earthquake","Sumatra-Andaman_earthquake","Tohoku_earthquake","List_of_earthquake","Explosion","Exploration_geophysics","Electromagnetic_radiation","Induced_polarization","Magnetotellurics","Salt_dome","Petroleum","Rock_(geology)","Geological_fault","Meteor","Impact_crater","Chicxulub_Crater","Cretaceous–Paleogene_extinction_event","Dinosaur","Cretaceous–Paleogene_boundary","Oil_exploration","Seismometer","Ocean-bottom_seismometer","Seismograph","Tsunami","Microseism","Cryosphere","Joule","Forensic_seismology","Nuclear_testing","Richard_Dixon_Oldham","Harold_Jeffreys","Outer_core","Seismic_tomography","Convection_cell","Core–mantle_boundary","Earthquake_prediction","VAN_method","Seismic_hazard","Earthquake_engineering","Indicted","Manslaughter","2009_L'Aquila_earthquake","American_Association_for_the_Advancement_of_Science","American_Geophysical_Union","RadExPro_seismic_software","Keiiti_Aki","Don_L._Anderson","Bruce_Bolt","Jon_Claerbout","Adam_Dziewonski","Maurice_Ewing","Boris_Borisovich_Galitzine","Grigoriy_A._Gamburtsev","Beno_Gutenberg","Susan_Hough","Harold_Jeffreys","Lucy_Jones","Hiroo_Kanamori","Vladimir_Keilis-Borok","Leon_Knopoff","Inge_Lehmann","Robert_Mallet","Giuseppe_Mercalli","John_Milne","Andrija_Mohorovičić","Richard_Dixon_Oldham","Fusakichi_Omori","Sebastião_José_de_Carvalho_e_Melo","Frank_Press","Paul_G._Richards","Charles_Francis_Richter","Seikei_Sekiya","Kerry_Sieh","Paul_Silver","Brian_Tucker","John_Vidale","Lianxing_Wen","John_Winthrop_(educator)","Zhang_Heng","Ambient_Vibrations","Asteroseismology","Cryoseism","Engineering_geology","Forensic_seismology","List_of_free_geophysics_software","Geophysical_migration","Helioseismology","Incorporated_Research_Institutions_for_Seismology","Isoseismal_map","Seismic_interferometry","Seismic_loading","Seismic_performance_analysis","Seismite","Seismo-electromagnetics","Seismotectonics"]}
