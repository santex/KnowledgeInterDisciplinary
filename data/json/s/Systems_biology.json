Systems biology is a biology-based inter-disciplinary field\nof study that focuses on complex interactions within biological systems, using a\nmore holistic perspective (holism instead of the more traditional reductionism)\napproach to biological and biomedical research. Particularly from year 2000\nonwards, the concept has been used widely in the biosciences in a variety of\ncontexts. One of the outreaching aims of systems biology is to model and\ndiscover emergent properties, properties of cells, tissues and organisms\nfunctioning as a system whose theoretical description is only possible using\ntechniques which fall under the remit of systems biology. These typically\ninvolve metabolic networks or cell signaling networks.\n","linknr":488,"url":"Systems_biology","recorded":1362510108,"links":40,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Bioinformatics","Systems biology|"],"headings":["Overview","History","Associated disciplines","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/01/Genomics_GTL_Pictorial_Program.jpg/320px-Genomics_GTL_Pictorial_Program.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/Signal_transduction_pathways.svg/280px-Signal_transduction_pathways.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/Complex-adaptive-system.jpg/32px-Complex-adaptive-system.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Biological_system","Holism","Reductionist","Biosciences","Emergent_property","Metabolic_networks","Cell_signaling","Enzymes","Metabolites","Metabolic_pathway","Paradigm","Reductionist","Biological_organisation","Scientific_method","Denis_Noble","Transcriptomics","Metabolomics","Proteomics","Dynamical_systems_theory","Molecular_biology","Enzyme_kinetics","Control_theory","Cybernetics","Ludwig_von_Bertalanffy","General_systems_theory","Alan_Lloyd_Hodgkin","Andrew_Fielding_Huxley","Denis_Noble","Mihajlo_Mesarovic","Case_Western_Reserve_University","Metabolic_control_analysis","Biochemical_systems_theory","Molecular_biology","Theoretical_biology","Functional_genomics","Masaru_Tomita","Genome_projects","Omics","Genomics","Proteomics","Bioinformatics","NIGMS","NIH","National_Science_Foundation","Phenomics","Genomics","Epigenomics","Epigenetics","Transcriptomics","DNA_microarray","Serial_analysis_of_gene_expression","Interferomics","RNA_interference","Translatomics","Proteomics","Two-dimensional_gel_electrophoresis","Mass_spectrometry","High-performance_liquid_chromatography","Mass_spectrometry","Phosphoproteomics","Glycoproteomics","Metabolomics","Metabolites","Glycomics","Lipidomics","Lipids","Interactomics","NeuroElectroDynamics","Fluxomics","Biomics","Biome","Systems_Biology_of_Cancer","Tumorigenesis","Cancer_treatment","Cancer_genome_sequencing","Cell_lines","Animal_testing_on_rodents","Xenograft","High-throughput_screening","Mutations","Genome_instability","Virtual_Physiological_Human","RNAi","Mechanistic_models","Flux_balance_analysis","Process_calculi","Î -calculus","Constraint_programming","Information_extraction","Text_mining","Loose_coupling","Computational_biology","Network_Biology","Synthetic_biology","List_of_omics_topics_in_biology","List_of_systems_biology_research_groups","Systems_microbiology","Systems_biomedicine","Flux_balance_analysis","Metabolic_network_modelling"]}
