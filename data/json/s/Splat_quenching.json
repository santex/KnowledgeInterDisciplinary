{"cursor":"6684","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Splat quenching' is a metallurgical, metal morphing, technique used for forming\nmetals with a particular crystal structure by means of extremely rapid\nquenching, or cooling.\n\nA typical technique for splat quenching involves casting molten metal by pouring\nit between two massive, cooled copper rollers that are constantly chilled by the\ncirculation of water. These provide a near-instant quench because of the large\nsurface area in close contact with the melt. The thin sheet formed has a low\nratio of volume relative to the area used for cooling.\n\nProducts that are formed through this process have a crystal structure that is\nnear-amorphous, or non-crystalline. They are commonly used for their valuable\nmagnetic properties, specifically high magnetic permeability. This makes them\nuseful for magnetic shielding and for low-loss transformer cores in power lines.\n","linknr":139,"url":"Splat_quenching","recorded":1362481728,"links":10,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Metallurgy","Amorphous metals","Alloys","Magnetism"],"headings":["Procedure","Varying Factors","Product","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Metallurgical","Quenching","Casting","Amorphous","Magnetic_permeability","Magnetic_shielding","Transformer","Chemical_vapor_deposition","Oxides","Quenching","Amorphous","Viscosity","Superparamagnetic","Superparamagnetic"]}
