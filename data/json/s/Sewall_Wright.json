With R. A. Fisher and J.B.S. Haldane, he was a founder of theoretical\npopulation genetics. He is the discoverer of the inbreeding coefficient and of\nmethods of computing it in pedigrees. He extended this work to populations,\ncomputing the amount of inbreeding of members of populations as a result of\nrandom genetic drift, and he and Fisher pioneered methods for computing the\ndistribution of gene frequencies among populations as a result of the\ninteraction of natural selection, mutation, migration and genetic drift. The\nwork of Fisher, Wright, and Haldane on theoretical population genetics was a\nmajor step in the development of the modern evolutionary synthesis of genetics\nwith evolution. Wright also made major contributions to mammalian genetics and\nbiochemical genetics. \n","linknr":799,"url":"Sewall_Wright","recorded":1362483392,"links":41,"instances":["biology","statistics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["1889 births","1988 deaths","Population geneticists","Evolutionary biologists","American biologists","National Medal of Science laureates","Foreign Members of the Royal Society","American statisticians","National Academy of Sciences laureates","Lombard College alumni"],"headings":["Biography","Scientific achievements and credits","Legacy","References","Further reading","Bibliography","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/81/Sewall_Wright.jpg/150px-Sewall_Wright.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["path_analysis","statistics"],["fitness","biology"],["path_analysis","statistics"]],"members":["fitness","path_analysis"],"related":["Melrose,_Massachusetts","Massachusetts","Madison,_Wisconsin","United_States","Genetics","Population_genetics","Daniel_Giraud_Elliot_Medal","National_Medal_of_Science","Darwin_Medal","Balzan_Prize","Fellow_of_the_Royal_Society","Unitarian","Geneticist","Evolutionary_theory","Path_analysis_(statistics)","R._A._Fisher","J.B.S._Haldane","Inbreeding_coefficient","Genetic_drift","Gene_frequencies","Natural_selection","Mutation","Modern_evolutionary_synthesis","Melrose,_Massachusetts","Massachusetts","Philip_Green_Wright","Inbreeding","Lombard_College","Universalist","Carl_Sandburg","Aeronautical_engineer","Theodore_Paul_Wright","Political_scientist","Quincy_Wright","Mathematics","Biology","Galesburg_High_School","Lombard_College","Mathematics","Doctorate","Biology","Harvard_University","Bussey_Institute","William_Ernest_Castle","Mammals","U.S._Department_of_Agriculture","University_of_Chicago","University_of_Wisconsinâ€“Madison","National_Medal_of_Science","Balzan_Prize","Darwin_Medal","Royal_Society","United_States_National_Academy_of_Sciences","Foreign_Member_of_the_Royal_Society","Daniel_Giraud_Elliot_Medal","Inbreeding","Mating_system","Genetic_drift","Population_genetics","R._A._Fisher","J._B._S._Haldane","Modern_evolutionary_synthesis","Inbreeding_coefficient","F-statistics","Genetic_drift","Gene_frequency","Effective_population_size","Genetic_drift","Fitness_(biology)","Fitness_surface","Allele_frequency","Natural_selection","Genetic_drift","Punctuated_equilibrium","Adaptive_peak","Genetic_drift","Gene_flow","Shifting_balance_theory","R._A._Fisher","Path_analysis_(statistics)","Graphical_model","Jay_Lush","Quantitative_genetics","Animal_breeding","Plant_breeding","Guinea_pigs","Enzyme","Philosophy","Charles_Hartshorne","Modern_synthesis","Theodosius_Dobzhansky","Ernst_Mayr","George_Gaylord_Simpson","Julian_Huxley","G._Ledyard_Stebbins","Charles_Darwin","Barbara_McClintock","OpenMx","Guinea_Pig","Michael_Ghiselin","American_Philosophical_Society","Melrose,_Massachusetts","Massachusetts","Madison,_Wisconsin"]}
