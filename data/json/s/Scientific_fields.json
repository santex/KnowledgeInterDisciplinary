{"cursor":"21617","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nThe 'branches of science' (which are also referred to as \"sciences\", \"scientific\nfields\", or \"scientific disciplines\") are commonly divided into two major\ngroups: natural sciences, which study natural phenomena (including biological\nlife), and social sciences, which study human behavior and societies. These\ngroupings are empirical sciences, which means the knowledge must be based on\nobservable phenomena and capable of being tested for its validity by other\nresearchers working under the same conditions. There are also related\ndisciplines that are grouped into interdisciplinary and applied sciences, such\nas engineering and medicine. Within these categories are specialized scientific\nfields that can include parts of other scientific disciplines but often possess\ntheir own terminology and expertise.
