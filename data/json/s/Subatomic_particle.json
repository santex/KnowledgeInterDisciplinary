There are two types of subatomic particles: elementary\nparticles, which are not made of other particles, and composite\nparticles. Particle physics and nuclear physics study these particles\nand how they interact. {{Cite book\n | last = Fritzsch | first = Harald year = 2005 title = Elementary Particles url\n | = http://books.google.com/?id=KFodZ8oHz2sC&printsec=frontcover&dq=elementary-\n | +particles+subject:%22Science+/+Nuclear+Physics%22 pages = 11â20 publisher =\n | World Scientific isbn = 978-981-256-141-1\n}}\n\nThe elementary particles of the Standard Model include:\n{{Cite book\n | last = Cottingham | first = W.

Various extensions of the Standard\nModel predict the existence of an elementary graviton particle and many other\nelementary particles.\n\nComposite subatomic particles (such as protons or atomic nuclei) are bound\nstates of two or more elementary particles. For example, a proton is made of two\nup quarks and one down quark, while the atomic nucleus of helium-4 is composed\nof two protons and two neutrons. Composite particles include all hadrons, a\ngroup composed of baryons (e.g., protons and neutrons) and mesons (e.g., pions\nand kaons).\n","linknr":437,"url":"Subatomic_particle","recorded":1362485470,"links":68,"instances":["particle_physics","publisher","particle","journal"],"pdf":["http://jgalvez.home.cern.ch/jgalvez/School/pdf/LM-WeakIteractions.pdf"],"categories":["Subatomic particles|","Quantum mechanics"],"headings":["Particles","Energy","Dividing an atom","History","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/CERN_LHC_Tunnel1.jpg/250px-CERN_LHC_Tunnel1.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["flavour","particle_physics"],["tau","particle"],["nature","journal"],["springer","publisher"]],"members":["flavour","springer","tau","nature"],"related":["Physics","Chemistry","Atom","Elementary_particle","Composite_particle","Particle_physics","Nuclear_physics","Fundamental_interaction","World_Scientific","Standard_Model","Cambridge_University_Press","Flavour_(particle_physics)","Quark","Up_quark","Down_quark","Bottom_quark","Top_quark","Strange_quark","Charm_quark","Lepton","Electron","Electron_neutrino","Muon","Muon_neutrino","Tau_(particle)","Tau_neutrino","Gauge_boson","Photon","Electromagnetism","W_and_Z_bosons","Weak_interaction","Gluon","Strong_force","Higgs_boson","Physics_beyond_the_Standard_Model","Graviton","Proton","Atomic_nucleus","Bound_state","Elementary_particle","Up_quark","Down_quark","Helium-4","Neutron","Hadron","Baryon","Meson","Pion","Kaon","Particle_physics","Classical_physics","Matter","Energy","Quantum_mechanics","Wave-particle_duality","Uncertainty_principle","Statistics","Nature_(journal)","Einstein","Energy","Analogous","Waves","Waves","Paradox","Wave_particle_duality","Henry_Holt_and_Company","Albert_Einstein","Louis_de_Broglie","Springer_(publisher)","Special_relativity","John_Wiley_&_Sons","Conservation_of_energy","Quark","Isaac_Newton","Newton's_Laws_of_Motion","Newtonian_mechanics","Hydrogen","Proton","Atomic_number","Isotope","Mass_number","Nucleon","Chemistry","Molecule","Nuclear_physics","Quantum_mechanics","Quantum_field_theory","Particle_physics","Cosmic_ray","Particle_accelerator","High-energy_physics","Albert_Einstein","Photon","Max_Planck","Black_body_radiation","Thermodynamics","G._Johnstone_Stoney","Electron","Academic_Press","J._J._Thomson","Ernest_Rutherford","Geiger-Marsden_experiment","Atomic_nucleus","Bohr_model","Chemistry","Hydrogen","Proton","Neutron","James_Chadwick","Nucleon","Neutrino","Wolfgang_Pauli","Enrico_Fermi","Beta_decay","Pion","Hideki_Yukawa","Residual_strong_force","Muon","Carl_D._Anderson","Pion","Kaon","Cosmic_ray","Particle_accelerator","Particle_detector","Hadron","Wolfgang_Pauli","Quark_model","Standard_model","Standard_Model","Higgs_boson","CERN","Large_Hadron_Collider","Boson","CPT_invariance","Dark_Matter","Electron","Elementary_particle","Fermion","Hot_spot_effect_in_subatomic_physics","List_of_fictional_elements,_materials,_isotopes_and_atomic_particles","List_of_particles","Neutron","Particle_physics","Poincare_symmetry","Proton","Quark_model","Spin_statistics_theorem","Standard_model","Ylem","Richard_Feynman","Steven_Weinberg"]}
