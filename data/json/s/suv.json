      "text" : "\n\n built on a light-truck chassis]] A 'sport utility vehicle' ('SUV') is a vehicle\n similar to a station wagon or estate car, usually equipped with four-wheel\n drive for on- or off-road ability. Some SUVs include the towing capacity of a\n pickup truck with the passenger-carrying space of a minivan or large sedan.\n\nSince SUVs are considered light trucks in North America, and often share the\nsame platform with pick-up trucks, at one time, they were regulated less\nstrictly than passenger cars under the two laws in the United States, the Energy\nPolicy and Conservation Act for fuel economy, and the Clean Air Act for\nemissions.<ref></ref> Starting in 2004, the United States Environmental\nProtection Agency (EPA) began to hold sport utility vehicles to the same\ntailpipe emissions standards as cars.<ref></ref>\n\nThe term is not used in all countries, and outside North America the terms \"off-\nroad vehicle\", \"four-wheel drive\" or \"four-by-four\" (abbreviated to \"4WD\" or\n\"4×4\") or simply use of the brand name to describe the vehicle like \"Jeep\" or\n\"Land Rover\" are more common. In Europe the term SUV has a similar meaning, but\nbeing newer than in the US it only applies to the newer street oriented one, where-\nas \"Jeep\", \"Land Rover\" or 4x4 are used for the off-roader oriented ones. Not\nall SUVs have four-wheel drive capabilities, and not all four-wheel-drive\npassenger vehicles are SUVs. Although some SUVs have off-road capabilities, they\noften play only a secondary role, and SUVs often do not have the ability to\nswitch among two-wheel and four-wheel-drive high gearing and four-wheel-drive\nlow gearing. While automakers tout an SUV's off-road prowess with advertising\nand naming, the daily use of SUVs is largely on paved roads.\n\nPopular in the late-1990s and early–mid-2000s, SUVs sales temporarily declined\ndue to high oil prices and a declining economy. The traditional truck-based SUV\nis gradually being supplanted by the crossover SUV, which uses an automobile\nplatform for lighter weight and better fuel efficiency, as a response to much of\nthe criticism of sport utility vehicles. But by 2010, SUV sales around the world\nrecovered, in spite of high gas prices.\n",
