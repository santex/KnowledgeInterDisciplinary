When picked up for series production, the title had to be\nchanged because Probe was the name of an existing PBS series. In the UK the\nseries aired on BBC 1 under the title 'Search Control'.\n\nThe show was created by Leslie Stevens ([[The Name of the Game (TV series)|The\nName of the Game]], [[The Outer Limits (1963 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]), and\nproduced by Leslie Stevens, Robert Justman ([[Star Trek]]), John Strong and Tony\nSpinner. The high concept was described as \"science fiction in today's world\"\nand the episodes featured many high-tech elements which are considered common in\ncurrent science fiction shows.\n\n__TOC__\n","linknr":160,"url":"Search_(TV_series)","recorded":1362554274,"links":13,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["1970s American television series","1972 American television series debuts","1973 American television series endings","NBC network shows","American science fiction television series","Television series by Warner Bros.
