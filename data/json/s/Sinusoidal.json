It is named after the function sine, of which it is the graph.\n It occurs often in pure and applied mathematics, as well as physics,\n engineering, signal processing and many other fields. Its most basic form\n as a function of time (t) is':'\n\n: y(t) = A \\cdot \\sin(2 \\pi f t + \\phi) = A \\cdot \\sin(\\omega t +\n:\\phi)\n\nwhere:\n* A, the [[amplitude]], is the peak deviation of the function from zero.\n* f, the [[frequency|ordinary frequency]], is the [[Real number|number]] of\n  oscillations (cycles) that occur each second of time.\n* Ï = 2Ïf, the [[angular frequency]], is the rate of change of the function\n  argument in units of radians per second\n* Ï, the [[Phase (waves)|phase]], specifies (in radians) where in its cycle the\n  oscillation is at t = 0. ** When Ï is non-zero, the entire waveform appears to\n  be shifted in time by the amount Ï/Ï seconds. A negative value represents a\n  delay, and a positive value represents an advance.\n\n\n\n\nThe sine wave is important in physics because it retains its waveshape when\nadded to another sine wave of the same frequency and arbitrary phase and\nmagnitude. It is the only periodic waveform that has this property. This\nproperty leads to its importance in Fourier analysis and makes it\nacoustically unique.\n","linknr":212,"url":"Sinusoidal","recorded":1362485924,"links":49,"instances":["physics","positioning","music","physics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Trigonometry","Wave mechanics","Waves","Waveforms"],"headings":["General form","Occurrences","Fourier series","Traveling and standing waves","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/Sine_and_Cosine.svg/400px-Sine_and_Cosine.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/c/6/5c6f2c4463feb5d9e20ddb438af87e83.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/87/Gnome-mime-sound-openclipart.svg/50px-Gnome-mime-sound-openclipart.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9d/Simple_harmonic_oscillator.gif","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/b/6/5b62b6687359126a07d54817a07a843d.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/c/d/f/cdf14a9d7efc7085dc1dd9b6d833e809.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/ComplexSinInATimeAxe.gif/400px-ComplexSinInATimeAxe.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/1/a/7/1a7aba6bc5d9217bef28f76ba9919e36.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/Waveforms.svg/400px-Waveforms.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/1/3/013bbb5d95073c1cecf6a870bcb1c28e.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/0/3/7032893782a00ac7ecba1b3d97b5e6f6.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["head_start","positioning"],["wave","physics"],["crest","physics"],["harmonic_series","mathematics"],["harmonic_series","music"]],"members":["crest","head_start","harmonic_series","wave"],"related":["Curve","Oscillation","Sine","Graph_of_a_function","Mathematics","Physics","Engineering","Signal_processing","Radian","Fourier_analysis","Wavenumber","Wavelength","Frequency","Phase_velocity","Plane_wave","Dot_product","Wave","Ocean_surface_wave","Sound","Light","Cosine","Head_start_(positioning)","Ear","Frequency","Harmonics","Whistling","Crystal_glass","Tuning_fork","Harmonics","Timbre","Triangle_wave","Sawtooth_wave","Joseph_Fourier","Square_wave","Signal_processing","Time_series","Wave","Standing_wave","Wave_(physics)","Crest_(physics)","Fourier_transform","Harmonic_series_(mathematics)","Harmonic_series_(music)","Helmholtz_equation","Instantaneous_phase","Pure_tone","Sawtooth_wave","Sinusoidal_model","Simple_harmonic_motion","Square_wave","Triangle_wave","Wave_equation"]}
