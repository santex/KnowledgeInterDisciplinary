{"cursor":"57751","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Sumer' (from Akkadian {{lang|akk-Latn|Å umeru}}; Sumerian {{lang|sux-Latn|[[Ki\n(earth)|ki]]-[[EN (cuneiform)|en]]-Äir 15 }}, approximately \"land of\nthe civilized kings\" or \"native land\" means \"native, local\", in\nsome contexts is \"noble\"([http://psd.museum.upenn.edu/epsd/epsd/e2182.html Äir\nNATIVE (7x: Old Babylonian)] from The Pennsylvania Sumerian Dictionary).\nLiterally, \"land of the native (local, noble) lords\". Stiebing (1994) has \"Land\nof the Lords of Brightness\" (William Stiebing, Ancient Near Eastern History and\nCulture). Postgate (1994) takesenas substitutingeme'' \"language\", translating\n\"land of the Sumerian tongue\" (. Postgate believes it likely that eme, 'tongue',\nbecame en, 'lord', through consonantal assimilation.) ) was an ancient civilization and historical region in\nsouthern Mesopotamia, modern Iraq, during the Chalcolithic and Early Bronze Age.\nAlthough the earliest historical records in the region do not go back much\nfurther than ca. 2900 BC, modern historians have asserted that Sumer was first\nsettled between ca. 4500 and 4000 BC by a non-Semitic people who may or may not\nhave spoken the Sumerian language (pointing to the names of cities, rivers,\nbasic occupations, etc. as evidence). These conjectured, prehistoric\npeople are now called \"proto-Euphrateans\" or \"Ubaidians\", and are theorized to have evolved from the Samarra\nculture of northern Mesopotamia\n(Assyria). The Ubaidians were the\nfirst civilizing force in Sumer, draining the marshes for agriculture,\ndeveloping trade, and establishing industries, including weaving, leatherwork,\nmetalwork, masonry, and pottery. However, some scholars\nsuch as Piotr Michalowski and Gerd Steiner, contest the idea of a Proto-\nEuphratean language or one substrate language.\n\nSumerian civilization took form in the Uruk period (4th millennium BC),\ncontinuing into the Jemdat Nasr and Early Dynastic periods. During the third\nmillennium BC, a close cultural symbiosis developed between the Sumerians (who\nspoke a Language Isolate) and the Semitic Akkadian speakers, which included\nwidespread . The influence of Sumerian on Akkadian\n(and vice versa) is evident in all areas, from lexical borrowing on a massive\nscale, to syntactic, morphological, and phonological convergence. This has prompted scholars to refer to Sumerian and Akkadian\nin the third millennium as a [[sprachbund]]. Sumer was\nconquered by the Semitic-speaking kings of the Akkadian Empire around 2270 BC\n(short chronology), but Sumerian continued as a sacred language. Native Sumerian\nrule re-emerged for about a century in the Third Dynasty of Ur (Sumerian\nRenaissance) of the 21st to 20th centuries BC, but Akkadian also remained in\nuse. The Sumerian city of Eridu, on the coast of the Persian Gulf, was the\nworld's first city, where three separate cultures fused - that of peasant\nUbaidian farmers, living in mud-brick huts and practicing irrigation; that of\nmobile nomadic Semitic pastoralists living in black tents and following herds of\nsheep and goats; and that of fisher folk, living in reed huts in the marshlands,\nwho may have been the ancestors of the Sumerians. Leick, Gwendolyn (2003), \"Mesopotamia, the Invention of the City\"\n(Penguin)\n\nThe surplus of storable food created by this economy allowed the population\nof this region to settle in one place, instead of migrating as hunter\ngatherers. It also allowed for a much greater population density, and in turn\nrequired an extensive labour force and division of labour with many\nspecialised arts and crafts.\n\nSumer was also the site of early development of writing, progressing from a\nstage of proto-writing in the mid 4th millennium BC to writing proper in the\nthird millennium (see Jemdet Nasr period).\n","linknr":1289,"url":"Sumerians","recorded":1362504720,"links":121,"instances":["sumer","goddess","engineering","tool","city","horse","mathematics","fruit","script","geography","city","gods","linguistics","season","botany","vegetable","weapon","device","carrying","sumer","construction","footwear","mythology","tool","tool","sumer","tool","mythology","masonry","sumer"],"pdf":["http://jwsr.ucr.edu/archive/vol10/number3/pdf/jwsr-v10n3-thompson.pdf","http://jwsr.ucr.edu/archive/vol10/number3/pdf/jwsr-v10n3-thompson.pdf","http://oi.uchicago.edu/pdf/OIS2.pdf","http://cniss.wustl.edu/workshoppapers/gatpres2a.pdf"],"categories":["Sumer|","Fertile
