The players\nin the starting lineup are commonly referred to as starters, whereas the others\nare substitutes or bench players.\n\nThe starters are commonly the best players on the team at their respective\npositions. Consequently, there is often a bit of prestige that is associated\nwith being a starter. In both baseball and basketball, it is common for players'\npositions to be denoted by a number as well as by a name. In that instance, the\nassociated number is used as well. If a common abbreviation is known, the\nabbreviation is listed after the associated number.\n","linknr":279,"url":"Starting_lineup","recorded":1374862711,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Starting_lineup&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Starting_lineup&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Starting_Lineup_(toy_line)","/wiki/Sports","/wiki/Game#Field_games_.28sports.29","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Baseball","/wiki/Basketball","#Starting_lineup_in_specific_sports","#American_football","#Association_football","#Australian_rules_football","#Baseball","#Basketball","#Canadian_football","#Gaelic_football_.26_hurling","#Hurling_.26_camogie","#Ice_hockey","#Lacrosse","#Netball","#Rugby_League","#Rugby_Union","#Volleyball","#See_also","#References","/w/index.php?title=Starting_lineup&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Starting_lineup&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/American_football","/wiki/Special_teams","/wiki/Devin_Hester","/wiki/Chicago_Bears","/wiki/Kick_returner","/wiki/Wide_receiver","/wiki/Quarterback","/wiki/Running_back","/wiki/Center_(American_football)","/wiki/Guard_(American_football)","/wiki/Offensive_tackle","/wiki/Offensive_line","/wiki/Tight_end","/wiki/Wide_receiver","/wiki/NCAA_Division_I","/wiki/Linebackers","/wiki/Strong_safety","/wiki/Free_safety","/wiki/Cornerback","/wiki/Placekicker","/wiki/Punter_(football_position)","/wiki/Punt_returner","/wiki/Kick_returner","/wiki/Long_snapper","/wiki/National_Football_League","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/wiki/Troy_Brown","/wiki/New_England_Patriots","/wiki/Wide_receiver","/wiki/Defensive_back","/w/index.php?title=Starting_lineup&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/Association_football","/wiki/Goalkeeper_(football)","/wiki/Defender_(football)","/wiki/Defender_(football)","/wiki/Defender_(football)","/wiki/Midfielder","/wiki/Midfielder_(football)","/wiki/Midfielder_(football)","/wiki/Striker","/w/index.php?title=Starting_lineup&action=edit&section=4","/wiki/Australian_rules_football","/wiki/Glossary_of_Australian_rules_football#C","/wiki/Full-forward","/wiki/Forward_pocket","/wiki/Centre_half-forward","/wiki/Australian_rules_football_positions#Half-forward_flank","/wiki/Centre_line_(football)","/wiki/Centre_line_(football)","/wiki/Centre_half-back","/wiki/Australian_rules_football_positions#Half-Back_Flank","/wiki/Fullback_(Australian_rules_football)","/wiki/Back_pocket","/wiki/Ruckman_(Australian_rules_football_position)","/wiki/Follower_(Australian_rules_football)","/wiki/Follower_(Australian_rules_football)","/w/index.php?title=Starting_lineup&action=edit&section=5","/wiki/Baseball","/wiki/National_League","/wiki/Major_League_Baseball","/wiki/Central_League","/wiki/Nippon_Professional_Baseball","/wiki/Batter_(baseball)","/wiki/American_League","/wiki/Pacific_League","/wiki/Designated_hitter","/wiki/Pitcher","/wiki/Batting_order_(baseball)","/wiki/Pitcher","/wiki/Catcher","/wiki/First_baseman","/wiki/Second_baseman","/wiki/Third_baseman","/wiki/Shortstop","/wiki/Left_fielder","/wiki/Center_fielder","/wiki/Right_Fielder","/wiki/Designated_hitter","/w/index.php?title=Starting_lineup&action=edit&section=6","/wiki/National_Basketball_Association","/wiki/Technical_foul","/wiki/Free_throw","http://www.nba.com/analysis/rules_3.html?nav=ArticleList","/wiki/Basketball","/wiki/Point_guard","/wiki/Shooting_guard","/wiki/Small_forward","/wiki/Power_forward_(basketball)","/wiki/Center_(basketball)","/wiki/College_basketball","/wiki/Center_(basketball)","/wiki/Forward_(basketball)","/wiki/Guard_(basketball)","/w/index.php?title=Starting_lineup&action=edit&section=7","/wiki/Canadian_football","/wiki/Comparison_of_American_and_Canadian_football","/wiki/Tight_end","/wiki/Quarterback","/wiki/Running_back","/wiki/Fullback_(American_football)","/wiki/Center_(American_football)","/wiki/Guard_(American_football)","/wiki/Offensive_tackle","/wiki/Offensive_line","/wiki/Slotback","/wiki/Wide_receiver","/wiki/Safety_(American_football_position)","/w/index.php?title=Starting_lineup&action=edit&section=8","/wiki/Gaelic_football","/wiki/Hurling","/wiki/Ladies%27_Gaelic_football","/wiki/Camogie","#cite_note-2","/w/index.php?title=Starting_lineup&action=edit&section=9","/wiki/Hurling","/wiki/Camogie","#GAA","/w/index.php?title=Starting_lineup&action=edit&section=10","/wiki/Ice_hockey","/wiki/Defenc
