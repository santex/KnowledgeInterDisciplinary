At atomic scale, it is about 100 times stronger than\nelectromagnetism, which in turn is orders of magnitude stronger than the weak\nforce interaction and gravitation.\n\nThe strong interaction is observable in two areas: on a larger scale (about 1 to\n3 femtometers (fm)), it is the force that binds protons and neutrons (nucleons)\ntogether to form the nucleus of an atom. On the smaller scale (less than about\n0.8 fm, the radius of a nucleon), it is the force (carried by gluons) that holds\nquarks together to form protons, neutrons and other hadron particles.\n\nIn the context of binding protons and neutrons together to form atoms, the\nstrong interaction is called the nuclear force (or residual strong force). In\nthis case, it is the residuum of the strong interaction between the quarks that\nmake up the protons and neutrons. As such, the residual strong interaction obeys\na quite different distance-dependent behavior between nucleons, from when it is\nacting to bind quarks within nucleons. The binding energy related to the\nresidual strong force is used in nuclear power and nuclear weapons. on\nBinding energy: see [http://www.furryelephant.com/content/radioactivity/binding-energy-mass-\ndefect/ Binding Energy, Mass Defect], Furry Elephant physics educational site,\nretr 2012 7 1 on Binding energy: see [https://netfiles.uiuc.edu/mragh-\neb/www/NPRE%20402%20ME%20405%20Nuclear%20Power%20Engineering/Nuclear%20Processe-\ns%20The%20Strong%20Force.pdf Chapter 4 NUCLEAR PROCESSES, THE STRONG FORCE], M.\nRagheb 1/27/2012, University of Illinois\n\nThe strong interaction is thought to be mediated by gluons, acting upon quarks,\nantiquarks, and other gluons. Gluons, in turn, are thought to interact with\nquarks and gluons because all carry a type of charge called \"color charge.\"\nColor charge is analogous to electromagnetic charge, but it comes in three types\nrather than one, and it results in a different type of force, with different\nrules of behavior. These rules are detailed in the theory of quantum\nchromodynamics (QCD), which is the theory of quark-gluon interactions.\n","linknr":345,"url":"Strong_interaction","recorded":1362583671,"links":93,"instances":["unit","mathematical_formulation"],"pdf":["https://netfiles.uiuc.edu/mragheb/www/NPRE%20402%20ME%20405%20Nuclear%20Power%20Engineering/Nuclear%20Processes%20The%20Strong%20Force.pdf","http://35.9.69.219/home/modules/pdf_modules/m280.pdf","http://35.9.69.219/home/modules/pdf_modules/m280.pdf"],"categories":["Concepts in physics","Quantum chromodynamics","Particle physics","Nuclear physics"],"headings":["History","Details","See also","References","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/CERN_LHC_Tunnel1.jpg/250px-CERN_LHC_Tunnel1.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/35/Nuclear_Force_anim_smaller.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["su(3"],["newton","unit"],["standard_model","mathematical_formulation"]],"members":["newton","standard_model"],"related":["Particle_physics","Fundamental_interaction","Electromagnetism","Weak_interaction","Gravitation","Order_of_magnitude","Femtometer","Proton","Neutron","Atomic_nucleus","Atom","Gluon","Quark","Hadron","Nuclear_force","Binding_energy","Nuclear_power","Nuclear_weapons","Antiparticle","Quantum_chromodynamics","Proton","Neutron","Electric_charge","Nucleon","Quark","Quantum_chromodynamics","Color_charge","Princeton_University_Press","Gluon","Electromagnetic_force","Weak_force","Gravitation","Quantum_chromodynamics","Standard_model","Non-abelian_gauge_theory","Gauge_theory","Symmetry_group","SU(3)","Coupling_constant","Group_theory","Hadron","Newton_(unit)","Color_confinement","Free_quark","Particle_accelerator","Quark-gluon_plasma","Hadron","Pion","Nuclear_force","Hadron","Meson","Nucleon","Pion","Rho_meson","Meson","Van_der_Waals_force","Basic_Books","Nuclear_force","Yukawa_potential","Atomic_number","Lead","Nuclear_binding_energy","Color_charge","Coupling_constant","Nuclear_physics","QCD_matter","Quantum_field_theory","Gauge_theory","Standard_model","Standard_Model_(mathematical_formulation)","Weak_interaction","Electromagnetism","Gravity","Intermolecular_force","Vortex","John_Wiley_&_Sons","John_Wiley_&_Sons","Perseus_Books","Joseph_Henry_Press"]}
