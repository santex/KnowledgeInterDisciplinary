      "text" : "\n\n Remington 870, two semi-automatic Remington 1100 shotguns, 20 boxes of shotgun\n shells, a clay trap, and three boxes of clay pigeons]]\n\nA 'shotgun' (also known as a 'scattergun' and 'peppergun',<ref></ref> or\nhistorically as a 'fowling piece') is a firearm that is usually designed to be\nfired from the shoulder, which uses the energy of a fixed shell to fire a\nnumber of small spherical pellets called shot, or a solid projectile called a\nslug. Shotguns come in a wide variety of sizes, ranging from 5.5&nbsp;mm\n(.22&nbsp;inch) bore up to bore, and in a range of firearm operating\nmechanisms, including breech loading, single-barreled, double or combination\ngun, pump-action, bolt-, and lever-action, semi-automatic, and even fully\nautomatic variants.\n\nA shotgun is generally a smoothbore firearm, which means that the inside of the\nbarrel is not rifled. Preceding smoothbore firearms, such as the musket, were\nwidely used by armies in the 18th century. The direct ancestor to the shotgun,\nthe blunderbuss, was also used in a similar variety of roles from self defence\nto riot control. It was often used by cavalry troops due to its generally\nshorter length and ease of use, as well as by coachmen for its substantial\npower. However, in the 19th century, these weapons were largely replaced on the\nbattlefield with breechloading rifled firearms, which were more accurate over\nlonger ranges. The military value of shotguns was rediscovered in the First\nWorld War, when American forces used 12-gauge pump action shotguns in close-\nquarters trench fighting to great effect. Since then, it has been used in a\nvariety of roles in civilian, law enforcement, and military applications.\n\nThe shot pellets from a shotgun spread upon leaving the barrel, and the power\nof the burning charge is divided among the pellets, which means that the energy\nof any one ball of shot is fairly low. In a hunting context, this makes\nshotguns useful primarily for hunting birds and other small game. However, in a\nmilitary or law enforcement context, the large number of projectiles makes the\nshotgun useful as a close quarters combat weapon or a defensive weapon.\nShotguns are also used for target shooting sports such as skeet, trap, and\nsporting clays. These involve shooting clay disks, known as clay pigeons,\nthrown in various ways.\n",
