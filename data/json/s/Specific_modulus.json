{"cursor":"31959","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Specific modulus' is a materials property consisting of the elastic modulus per\nmass density of a material. It is also known as the 'stiffness to weight ratio'\nor 'specific stiffness'. High specific modulus materials find wide application\nin aerospace applications where minimum structural weight is required. The\ndimensional analysis yields units of distance squared per time squared.\n\nThe utility of specific modulus is to find materials which will produce\nstructures with minimum weight, when the primary design limitation is deflection\nor physical deformation, rather than load at breakingâthis is also known as a\n\"stiffness-driven\" structure. Many common structures are stiffness-driven over\nmuch of their use, such as airplane wings, bridges, masts, and bicycle frames.\n\nTo emphasize the point, consider the issue of choosing a material for building\nan airplane. Aluminum seems obvious because it is \"lighter\" than steel, but\nsteel is stronger than aluminum, so one could imagine using thinner steel\ncomponents to save weight without sacrificing (tensile) strength. The problem\nwith this idea is that there would be a significant sacrifice of stiffness,\nallowing, e.g., wings to flex unacceptably. Because it is stiffness, not tensile\nstrength, that drives this kind of decision for airplanes, we say that they are\nstiffness-driven.\n\nThe connection details of such structures may be more sensitive to strength\n(rather than stiffness) issues due to effects of stress risers.\n\n \n\nSpecific modulus is not to be confused with specific strength, a term that\ncompares strength to density.\n","linknr":342,"url":"Specific_modulus","recorded":1362375117,"links":24,"instances":["geometry","engineering","structure","material","unit"],"pdf":["http://nptel.iitm.ac.in/courses/IIT-MADRAS/Design_Steel_Structures_II/5_cold_form_steel/3_local_buckling.pdf","http://www.isowave.com/pdf/materials/Yttrium_Iron_Garnet.pdf","http://www.compositesinnovation.ca/biofibre_workshop/Natural_Fibre_Composites_Development_and_Testing_-_Chad_Ulven.pdf","http://www.agrofibrecomposites.com/thesisBos.pdf","http://www.sailing.man.ac.uk/temp/jute.pdf","http://www2.dupont.com/Kevlar/en_US/assets/downloads/KEVLAR_Technical_Guide.pdf","http://www.dyneema.com/en_US/public/dyneema/downloads/Comprehensive_factsheet_UHMWPE.pdf","http://www2.dupont.com/Kevlar/en_US/assets/downloads/KEVLAR_Technical_Guide.pdf","http://www.dyneema.com/en_US/public/dyneema/downloads/Comprehensive_factsheet_UHMWPE.pdf","http://www51.honeywell.com/sm/afc/common/documents/PP_AFC_Honeywell_spectra_fiber_2000_Product_information_sheet.pdf","http://www.springerlink.com/content/vj8k40l122405223/fulltext.pdf"],"categories":["Materials science"],"headings":["Applications","Approximate specific stiffness for various materials","See also","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["fatigue","material"],["cross_section","geometry"],["beam","structure"],["deflection","engineering"],["deflection","engineering"],["pascal","unit"],["pascal","unit"]],"members":["cross_section","deflection","beam","fatigue","pascal"],"related":["Materials_property","Elastic_modulus","Density","Aerospace","Weight","Dimensional_analysis","Stress_risers","Fatigue_(material)","Heat_affected_zone","Specific_strength","Tension","Stiffness","Tension","Mass","Cross_section_(geometry)","Beam_(structure)","Bending","Buckling","Density","Buckling","Deflection_(engineering)","Young's_modulus","Density","Mass","Stiffness","Buckling","Deflection_(engineering)","Bending_moment","Second_moment_of_area","List_of_area_moments_of_inertia","Area","Area","Density","List_of_area_moments_of_inertia","Area","Density","List_of_area_moments_of_inertia","Flange","Section_modulus","Young's_modulus","Pascal_(unit)","Density","Rubber","Low_density_polyethylene","PTFE","HDPE","Polypropylene","Polyethylene_terephthalate","Nylon","Polystyrene","Polypropylene","Medium-density_fibreboard","Copper","Brass","Bronze","Wood","Properties_of_concrete","Ochroma_pyramidale","Ochroma_pyramidale","Tungsten","Osmium","Wrought_iron","Glass-reinforced_plastic","Wood","Picea_sitchensis","Steel","Magnesium","Metal","Aluminium","Titanium_alloy","Picea_sitchensis","Tooth_enamel","Calcium_phosphate","Molybdenum","Basalt_fiber","Glass","Yttrium_iron_garnet","Tungsten_carbide","Flax","Jute","Kevlar","Ultra-high-molecular-weight_polyethylene","Kevlar","Silicon","Aluminum_oxide","Carbon_fiber_reinforced_plastic","Ultra-high-molecular-weight_polyethylene","Silicon_carbide","Beryllium","Diamond","Young's_modulus","Pascal_(unit)","Density","Specific_strength"]}
