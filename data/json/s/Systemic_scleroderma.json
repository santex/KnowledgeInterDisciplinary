It is characterized by thickening of\nthe skin caused by accumulation of collagen, and by injuries to the smallest\narteries. There are two overlapping forms. Limited cutaneous scleroderma is\nlimited to the skin on the face, hands and feet. Diffuse cutaneous scleroderma\ncovers more of the skin, and is at risk of progressing to the visceral organs,\nincluding the kidneys, heart, lungs and gastrointestinal tract are affected.\n\nSurvival is determined by the severity of visceral disease. Prognosis is\ndifficult to predict until the disease differentiates into recognizable subsets.\nPatients with limited cutaneous scleroderma have a good prognosis, with 10-year\nsurvival of 75%, although  \n","linknr":642,"url":"Systemic_scleroderma","recorded":1362559387,"links":23,"instances":["anatomy","genetics"],"pdf":["http://www.hellenicjcardiol.org/archive/full_text/2010/1/2010_1_64.pdf","http://www.hellenicjcardiol.org/archive/full_text/2010/1/2010_1_64.pdf"],"categories":["Mucinoses","Connective tissue diseases","Autoimmune diseases","Diseases involving the fasciae","Systemic connective tissue disorders"],"headings":["Signs and symptoms","Diagnosis","Causes","Pathophysiology","Therapy","Epidemiology","Advocacy","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c7/Systemic_sclerosis_finger.jpg/230px-Systemic_sclerosis_finger.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/16/Peptic_stricture.png/200px-Peptic_stricture.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/78/Thrombotic_microangiopathy_-_very_high_mag.jpg/220px-Thrombotic_microangiopathy_-_very_high_mag.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Ambox_globe_content.svg/48px-Ambox_globe_content.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["colon","anatomy"],["transcription","genetics"]],"members":["colon","transcription"],"related":["Necrosis","Systemic_autoimmune_disease","Connective_tissue_disease","Human_skin","Itch","Musculoskeletal_system","Lung","Gastrointestinal_tract","Kidney","Raynaud's_phenomenon","Finger","Calcinosis","Joints","Arthralgia","Arthritis","Tenosynovitis","Myalgia","Calcinosis","Myopathy","Pulmonary_function_test","Pulmonary_hypertension","Pulmonary_arteries","Heart_failure","Diffusion_capacity","Aspiration_pneumonia","Pulmonary_hemorrhage","Pneumothorax","Esophagus","Stomach","Gastroesophageal_reflux","Dysphagia","Esophagus","Esophagitis","Peptic_stricture","Proton_pump_inhibitor","Esophageal_dilatation","Motility","Dysphagia","Esophagitis","Gastroesophageal_reflux_disease","Barrett's_esophagus","Small_intestine","Bacterial_overgrowth","Malabsorption","Bile_salts","Fat","Carbohydrates","Proteins","Vitamins","Colon_(anatomy)","Ogilvie's_syndrome","Ischemic_colitis","Pneumatosis_cystoides_intestinalis","Diverticulosis","Esophagus","Cirrhosis","Malnutrition","Gastric_antral_vascular_ectasia","Pylorus","Upper_gastrointestinal_bleeding","Iron_deficiency_anemia","Thrombotic_microangiopathy","Histomorphology","Kidney_biopsy","PAS_stain","Malignant_hypertension","Renin","Azotemia","Microangiopathic_hemolytic_anemia","Hematuria","Proteinuria","ACE_inhibitors","Renal_failure","RNA_polymerase","ACE_inhibitors","Prophylaxis","Renal_transplantation","Anti-centromere_antibodies","Anti-topoisomerase_antibodies","Anti-nuclear_antibody","African-American","American_College_of_Rheumatology","Raynaud's_phenomenon","Cytomegalovirus","Organic_solvent","Microchimerism","Chronic_renal_failure","Nephrogenic_fibrosing_dermopathy","Gadolinium","Radiocontrast","Bleomycin","Taxane","Solvent","Autoimmune_disorder","Kinetochore","T_cell","Cytokine","Fibroblast","Transforming_growth_factor","Transcription_(genetics)","Transcription_factor","Connective_tissue_growth_factor","Endothelium","Platelet","Endothelin","Vasodilation","NSAID","Naproxen","Glucocorticoid","Nifedipine","Prostacyclin","Iloprost","Bosentan","Methotrexate","Ciclosporin","Acute_renal_failure","Malignant_hypertension","ACE_inhibitor","Hemodialysis","Cyclophosphamide","Epoprostenol","Bosentan","Evidence_based_medicine","Antithymocyte_globulin","Mycophenolate_mofetil","Hematopoietic_stem_cell_transplantation","Rare_disease","Scleroderma_Research_Foundation","Bob_Saget","For_Hope","Dana_Delany"]}
