{"cursor":"60596","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'Sugar' is the generalised name for a class of chemically-related sweet-flavored\nsubstances, most of which are used as food. They are carbohydrates, composed of\ncarbon, hydrogen and oxygen. There are various types of sugar derived from\ndifferent sources. Simple sugars are called monosaccharides and include glucose\n(also known as dextrose), fructose and galactose. The table or granulated sugar\nmost customarily used as food is sucrose, a disaccharide (in the body, sucrose\nhydrolyses into fructose and glucose). Other disaccharides include maltose and\nlactose. Chemically-different substances may also have a sweet taste, but are\nnot classified as sugars. Some are used as lower-calorie food substitutes for\nsugar described as artificial sweeteners.\n\nSugars are found in the tissues of most plants but are only present in\nsufficient concentrations for efficient extraction in sugarcane and sugar beet.\nSugarcane is a giant grass and has been cultivated in tropical climates in the\nFar East since ancient times. A great expansion in its production took place in\nthe 18th century with the setting up of sugar plantations in the West Indies and\nAmericas. This was the first time that sugar became available to the common\npeople who had previously had to rely on honey to sweeten foods. Sugar beet is a\nroot crop and is cultivated in cooler climates and became a major source of\nsugar in the 19th century when methods for extracting the sugar became\navailable. Sugar production and trade has changed the course of human history in\nmany ways. It influenced the formation of colonies, the perpetuation of slavery,\nthe transition to indentured labour, the migration of peoples, wars between 19th\ncentury sugar trade controlling nations and the ethnic composition and political\nstructure of the new world.\n\nThe world produced about 168 million tonnes of sugar in 2011. The average person\nconsumes about 24 kilograms of sugar each year (33.1 kg in industrialised\ncountries), equivalent to over 260 food calories per person, per day. Sugar\nprovides energy but no nutrientsâempty calories.\n\nSince the latter part of the twentieth century, it has been questioned whether a\ndiet high in sugars, especially refined sugars, is bad for health. Sugar has\nbeen linked to obesity and suspected of being implicated in diabetes,\ncardiovascular disease, dementia, macular degeneration and tooth decay. Numerous\nstudies have been undertaken to try to clarify the position but the results\nremain largely unclear, mainly because of the difficulty of finding populations\nfor use as controls that do not consume sugars.\n","linknr":1257,"url":"Sugars","recorded":1362482640,"links":153,"instances":["cooking","region","wine","biology","biology"],"pdf":["http://www.usaid.gov/locations/latin_america_caribbean/environment/docs/ag&environ/Sugarcane.pdf","http://www.usaid.gov/locations/latin_america_caribbean/environment/docs/ag&environ/Sugarcane.pdf","http://www.fas.usda.gov/htp/sugar/2011/Nov2011sugar.pdf","http://www.fas.usda.gov/htp/sugar/2011/Nov2011sugar.pdf","http://www.fas.usda.gov/psdonline/circulars/sugar.pdf","http://www.fas.usda.gov/psdonline/circulars/sugar.pdf","http://www.who.int/nutrition/publications/public_health_nut7.pdf","http://www.who.int/nutrition/publications/public_health_nut7.pdf","http://ndep.nih.gov/media/Youth_Tips_Diabetes.pdf","http://www.ctahr.hawaii.edu/oc/freepubs/pdf/FST-16.pdf","http://www.ctahr.hawaii.edu/oc/freepubs/pdf/FST-16.pdf"],"categories":["Sugar|","Carbohydrates","Excipients","Granular
