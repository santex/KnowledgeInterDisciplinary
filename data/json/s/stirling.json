The city is clustered around a large\nfortress and medieval old-town beside the River Forth. Historically it was\nstrategically important as the \"Gateway to the Highlands\", with its position\nnear the boundary between the Scottish Lowlands and Highlands, indeed, it has\nbeen described as the brooch which clasps the Highlands and the Lowlands\ntogether.<ref></ref> Its historical position as the nearest crossing of the\nForth to the river mouth meant that many of its visitors were in fact invaders.\nThe beast of Stirling is the wolf, which it shares with Rome. According to\nlegend, when Stirling was under attack from Viking invaders, a wolf howled,\nalerting the townspeople in time to save the town.<ref></ref>\n\nOnce the capital of Scotland, Stirling contains the Great Hall (restored 1999)\nand the Renaissance Palace (restoration completed 2011) within the Castle that\nrivalled any building in Europe at the time. Stirling also has its medieval\nparish church, The Church of the Holy Rude, where King James VI was crowned King\nof Scots on 29 July 1567. The Holy Rude still functions as a living church with\na service every Sunday.\n\nStirling is a centre for local government, higher education, retail, and light\nindustry. Its population in 2008 was 33,710,<ref name=\"GRO Scotland\"></ref> for\nStirling itself, the wider urban area including Bridge of Allan and Bannockburn\nhas a population of 45,750.<ref name=\"gro-scotland.gov.uk\"></ref> This makes it\nthe smallest city in Scotland: indeed it is smaller than many of Scotland's\nlarger towns.\n\nOne of the principal royal strongholds of the Kingdom of Scotland, Stirling was\ncreated a Royal burgh by King David I in 1130, which it remained until 1975,\nwhen the county of Stirlingshire was absorbed into Central Region. In 2002, as\npart of Queen Elizabeth II's Golden Jubilee, Stirling was granted city status.\n","title":"stirling","headings":["History","Geography","Governance","Geography","Demography","Culture","Economy","Sports and recreation","Education","Twinned cities","See also","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["3: Scottish_Highlands","2: City_status_in_the_United_Kingdom","2: Bridge_of_Allan","2: Bannockburn","2: David_I_of_Scotland","2: Crag_and_tail","2: Ochil_Hills","2: Mary,_Queen_of_Scots","2: Cambuskenneth_Abbey","2: Billy_Bremner","2: Scotland_national_football_team","2: Frank_Barnwell","2: Alloa","2: Scottish_National_Party","2: Member_of_the_Scottish_Parliament","2: Carse","2: Raploch","2: Stirling_Council","2: Stirling_railway_station,_Scotland","2: Research_and_development","1: Stirling_and_Falkirk","1: Burgh","1: Scotland","1: Stirling_Castle","1: Medieval","1: River_Forth","1: Scottish_Lowlands","1: Church_of_the_Holy_Rude","1: List_of_towns_and_cities_in_Scotland_by_population","1: Kingdom_of_Scotland","1: Royal_burgh","1: Stirlingshire","1: Central_Region,_Scotland","1: Elizabeth_II_of_the_United_Kingdom","1: Golden_Jubilee_of_Elizabeth_II","1: Stone_Age","1: Roman_Britain","1: Kincardine_Bridge","1: Oswiu_of_Northumbria","1: Penda_of_Mercia","1: Bede","1: Stirling_Bridge","1: Wars_of_Scottish_Independence","1: Battle_of_Stirling_Bridge","1: Battle_of_Bannockburn","1: William_Wallace","1: Robert_the_Bruce","1: Sieges_of_Stirling_Castle","1: Scarborough_Castle","1: Brythonic_languages","1: Latin","1: The_Church_of_the_Holy_Rude,_Stirling","1: Westminster_Abbey","1: James_I_of_England","1: Oliver_Cromwell","1: Scotland_in_the_Wars_of_the_Three_Kingdoms","1: James_III_of_Scotland","1: Margaret_of_Denmark,_Queen_of_Scotland","1: King_of_Scots","1: Jacobite_Rising","1: Duke_of_Mar","1: Bonnie_Prince_Charlie","1: King_James_VI_of_Scotland","1: Henry_Campbell-Bannerman","1: John_Grierson","1: Muir_Mathieson","1: Norman_McLaren","1: Kirsty_Young","1: Leeds_United_A.F.C.","1: Frank_Beattie","1: Kilmarnock_F.C.","1: Harold_Barnwell","1: Bristol_Blenheim","1: Callander","1: Crieff","1: Loch_Lomond","1: Kirkintilloch","1: Cumbernauld","1: Denny,_Falkirk","1: Local_government","1: United_Kingdom_constituencies","1: Member_of_Parliament","1: House_of_Commons_of_the_United_Kingdom","1: Anne_McGuire","1: Scottish_Parliament","1: Bruce_Crawford","1: Member_of_the_European_Parliament","1: D'Hondt_method","1: Proportional_representation","1: Highland_Boundary_Fault","1: Ben_Ledi","1: Glacial","1: Quartz-dolerite","1: Tidal","1: Ben_Cleuch","1: Dumyat","1: Floodplain","1: Abbey_Craig","1: Wallace_Monument","1: Gulf_Stream","1: Dunblane","1: Microclimate","1: Mar's_Wark","1: Argyll's_Lodging","1: Broomridge","1: Cambusbarron","1: Cambuskenneth","1: Cornton","1: Median","1: Royal_National_Mod","1: Sabhal_Mòr_Ostaig","1: Market_town","1: Mercat_cross","1: Retail","1: Thistles_Centre","1: Shopping_mall","1: Sainsbury's","1: Urban_renewal","1: Financial_services","1: Tourism","1: Prudential_plc","1: National_Wallace_Monument","1: Blair_Drummond_Safari_Park","1: History_of_Scotland","1: University_of_Stirling","1: Life_sciences","1: Central_Scotland_Police","1: NHS_Forth_Valley","1: Scottish_Environment_Protection_Agency","1: Bank_of_Scotland","1: Stirling_railway_station","1: FirstGroup_plc","1: Bridge_of_Allan_railway_station","1: Dunblane_railway_station","1: Central_Belt","1: Glasgow","1: M80_motorway","1: Edinburgh","1: Inter-city_rail","1: Upper_Forth_Crossing","1: Stirling-Alloa-Kincardine_rail_link","1: Trunk_road","1: Motorway","1: Commuting","1: Stirling_Albion_F.C.","1: Scottish_Football_League_Third_Division","1: Manchester_United","1: Liverpool","1: Rangers_F.C.","1: Stirling_County_RFC","1: Scottish_Premiership_Division_One","1: Gary_Caldwell","1: Steven_Caldwell","1: Kenny_Logan","1: Allister_Hogg","1: Jockey","1: Willie_Carson","1: Cricket","1: Dougie_Brown","1: Scottish_Institute_of_Sport","1: Stirling_University","1: Gannochy","1: Golf_course","1: Undergraduate","1: Postgraduate","1: Science_park","1: Singapore","1: Nanyang_Polytechnic","1: Forth_Valley_College","1: Falkirk","1: Clackmannan","1: Stirling_High_School","1: Wallace_High_School,_Stirling","1: St_Modan's_High_School","1: Public-private_partnership","1: Scottish_Gaelic","1: Villeneuve_d'Ascq","1: Dunedin,_Florida","1: Óbuda","1: Summerside,_Prince_Edward_Island","1: Kecioren","1: Black_Bond","1: Lecropt","1: List_of_places_in_Scotland","1: Historic_Scotland","1: Julian_Richards","1: BBC_Radio_4","1: RealAudio"]}
