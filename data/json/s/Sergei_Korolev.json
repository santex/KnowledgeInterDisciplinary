Korolev's last name is pronounced . , Serhiy Pavlovych\nKorolov, also transliterated as 'Sergey Pavlovich Korolyov'; in Zhytomyr,\nRussian Empire â 14 January 1966 in Moscow, USSR) was the lead Soviet rocket\nengineer and spacecraft designer in the Space Race between the United States and\nthe Soviet Union during the 1950s and 1960s. He is considered by many as the\nfather of practical astronautics. [http://energia-zem.ru/204.php energia-\nzem.ru]\n\nAlthough Korolev was trained as an aircraft designer, his greatest strengths\nproved to be in design integration, organization and strategic planning.\nArrested for alleged mismanagement of funds (he spent the money on unsuccessful\nexperiments with rocket devices), he was imprisoned in 1938 for almost six\nyears, including some months in a Kolyma labour camp. Following his release, he\nbecame a recognized rocket designer and a key figure in the development of the\nSoviet ICBM program. He was then appointed to lead the Soviet space program,\nmade Member of Soviet Academy of Sciences, overseeing the early successes of the\nSputnik and Vostok projects. By the time he died unexpectedly in 1966, his plans\nto compete with the United States to be the first nation to land a man on the\nMoon had begun to be implemented.\n\nBefore his death he was often referred to only as \"Chief Designer\", because his\nname and his pivotal role in the Soviet space program had been held to be a\nstate secret by the Politburo. Scott and\nLeonov, p. 53. Harford, p. 135. \"Chief Designer\" is a translation of Glavny\nKonstruktor (Russian: ÐÐ»Ð°Ð²Ð½ÑÐ¹ ÐÐ¾Ð½ÑÑÑÑÐºÑÐ¾Ñ). Only many years later was he\npublicly acknowledged as the lead man behind Soviet success in
