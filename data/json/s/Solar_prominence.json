Prominences are anchored to the Sun's\nsurface in the photosphere, and extend outwards into the Sun's corona. While the\ncorona consists of extremely hot ionized gases, known as plasma, which do not\nemit much visible light, prominences contain much cooler plasma, similar in\ncomposition to that of the chromosphere. A prominence forms over timescales of\nabout a day, and prominences may persist in the corona anywhere from one hour to\nnearly a year. Most last for several weeks or months. Some prominences break\napart and give rise to coronal mass ejections. Scientists are currently\nresearching how and why prominences are formed.\n\nA typical prominence extends over many thousands of kilometers; the largest on\nrecord was estimated at over long  â roughly the\nradius of the Sun.\n\nWhen a prominence is viewed from a different perspective so that it is against\nthe sun instead of against space, it appears darker than the surrounding\nbackground. This formation is instead called a solar filament. It is possible for a projection to be both a filament and a\nprominence. Some prominences are so powerful that they throw out matter from the\nSun into space at speeds ranging from 600 km/s to more than 1000 km/s.\nOther prominences form huge loops or arching columns of glowing gases over\nsunspots that can reach heights of hundreds of thousands of kilometres.\nProminences may last for a few days or even for a few months.\nFlocculi (plural of flocculus) is another term for these filaments, and dark\nflocculi typically describes the appearance of solar prominences when viewed\nagainst the solar disk in certain wavelengths.\n","linknr":228,"url":"Solar_prominence","recorded":1362575634,"links":58,"instances":["physics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Solar phenomena"],"headings":["Videos","Images","See also","References","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/39/Sun_earth_jupiter_whole_600.jpg/220px-Sun_earth_jupiter_whole_600.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/Solar_prominence_1.jpg/120px-Solar_prominence_1.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/82/Detached_sola_prominence.jpg/120px-Detached_sola_prominence.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/Flare_and_after-flare_prominence.jpg/120px-Flare_and_after-flare_prominence.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bb/Sunflare_skylab4_big.jpg/120px-Sunflare_skylab4_big.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/Solar_Prominence_STEREO_Behind.jpg/120px-Solar_Prominence_STEREO_Behind.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/Solar_Prominence_STEREO_Ahead.jpg/120px-Solar_Prominence_STEREO_Ahead.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d9/Yohkohimage.gif/155px-Yohkohimage.gif","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/The_Sun_with_Prominence.jpg/40px-The_Sun_with_Prominence.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["plasma","physics"]],"members":["plasma"],"related":["Sun","Coronal_loops","Photosphere","Corona","Ionized","Gas","Plasma_(physics)","Visible_light","Chromosphere","Coronal_mass_ejection","Skylab","Coronal_mass_ejection","Solar_flare","Corona"]}
