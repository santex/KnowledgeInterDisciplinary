In the shortlex ordering, sequences are primarily sorted by\ncardinality (length) with the shortest sequences first, and sequences of the\nsame length are sorted into lexicographical order. Shortlex ordering is also\ncalled 'radix', or 'length-plus-lexicographic' ordering.\n","linknr":90,"url":"Shortlex_order","recorded":1362372645,"links":14,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Order theory"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/Rubik%27s_cube_v3.svg/40px-Rubik%27s_cube_v3.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Mathematics","Automatic_group","Total_ordering","Finite_sequence","Cardinality","Lexicographical_order"]}
