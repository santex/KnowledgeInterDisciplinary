{"cursor":"23232","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" and partial melting of hydrated asthenosphere]]\n\nIn geology, 'subduction' is the process that takes place at convergent\nboundaries by which one tectonic plate moves under another tectonic plate and\nsinks into the mantle as the plates converge. Regions where this process occurs\nare known as subduction zones. Rates of subduction are typically measured in\ncentimeters per year, with the average rate of convergence being approximately 2\nto 8 cm per year.\n\nPlates include both oceanic crust and continental crust. Stable subduction zones\ninvolve the oceanic crust of one plate sliding beneath the continental crust or\noceanic crust of another plate. That is, the subducted crust is always oceanic\nwhile the overriding crust may or may not be oceanic. Subduction zones are often\nnoted for their high rates of volcanism, earthquakes, and mountain building.\n\nOrogenesis, or mountain-building, occurs when large pieces of material on the\nsubducting plate (such as island arcs) are pressed into the overriding plate.\nThese areas are subject to many earthquakes, which are caused by the\ninteractions between the subducting slab and the mantle, the volcanoes, and\n(when applicable) the mountain-building related to island arc collisions.\n","linknr":561,"url":"Subduction_zone","recorded":1362371936,"links":65,"instances":["geology","geology","geology","geology","journal","geology","earth","geology"],"pdf":["http://perso-sdt.univ-brest.fr/~jacdev/pdf/1.pdf","http://perso-sdt.univ-brest.fr/~jacdev/pdf/1.pdf"],"categories":["Plate tectonics","Geological processes"],"headings":["General description","Theory on origin","Effects","Subduction angle","Importance","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/Subduction.png/300px-Subduction.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a4/SubZone.jpg/300px-SubZone.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/ConMarRJS.jpg/300px-ConMarRJS.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/Oceanic_spreading.svg/300px-Oceanic_spreading.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg/20px-Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Upwelling.svg/140px-Upwelling.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/Antarctic_bottom_water_hg.png/140px-Antarctic_bottom_water_hg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["mantle","geology"],["slab","geology"],["crust","geology"],["slab","geology"],["transition_zone","earth"],["fractional_crystallization","geology"],["geology","journal"],["fracture","geology"],["basement","geology"],["mantle","geology"],["mantle","geology"]],"members":["basement","mantle","fracture","fractional_crystallization","geology","slab","transition_zone","crust"],"related":["Asthenosphere","Geology","Convergent_boundary","Plate_tectonics","Mantle_(geology)","Oceanic_crust","Continental_crust","Volcanism","Earthquakes","Orogeny","Orogenesis","Island_arc","Earthquake","Slab_(geology)","Downwelling","Lithosphere","Crust_(geology)","Lithosphere","Slab_(geology)","Basalt","Eclogite","Earth's_mantle","Oceanic_crust","Sedimentary_rocks","Plate_tectonics","Geophysics","Geochemistry","Oceanic_trench","Earthquake","Transition_zone_(Earth)","Earth","Hydrous","Supercritical_fluid","Fractional_crystallization_(geology)","Volcanic_arc","Geology_(journal)","Serpentinite","Geophysicist","Don_L._Anderson","Calcium_carbonate","Oceanic_trench","Volcano","Mount_St._Helens","Mount_Fuji","Volcanic_arc","Island_arcs","Mariana_Islands","Tonga","Continental_arc","Cascade_Volcanic_Arc","Magma","Continental_crust","Particulate","Climate","Earthquakes","Wadati-Benioff_zone","1960_Valdivia_earthquake","2004_Indian_Ocean_earthquake_and_tsunami","2011_Tōhoku_earthquake_and_tsunami","Geothermal_gradient","Tsunamis","Indo-Australian_Plate","Eurasian_Plate","2004_Indian_Ocean_Earthquake","Outer_trench_swell","Samoa_earthquake","Earthquake","Benioff_zone","Seismic_tomography","Fracture_(geology)","Core-mantle_boundary","Exotic_terrane","Flux_melting","Mantle_wedge","Volcanic_gap","Andes","Andean_Volcanic_Belt","Norte_Chico,_Chile","Nazca_Ridge","Juan_Fernández_Ridge","Taitao_Peninsula","Chile_Rise","Mid-ocean_ridge","Laramide_Orogeny","Rocky_Mountains","United_States","Basement_(geology)","Oceanic_crust","Mariana_Trench","Jurassic","Ophiolite","Back-arc","Marginal_sea","Lithosphere","Density","Mantle_convection","Aqueous","Fluids","Fractionation","Continental_crust","Mantle_(geology)","Calc-alkaline","Mantle_(geology)","Megathrust_earthquake","List_of_tectonic_plate_interactions","Back-arc_basin","Oceanic_trench","Obduction","Slab_window"]}
