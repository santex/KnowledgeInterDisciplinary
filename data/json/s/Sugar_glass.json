It is much less likely to cause injuries than real glass,\nand it easily breaks convincingly, making it an excellent choice for stunts.\nSugar glass is also used in sugar sculpture.\nBecause sugar glass is hygroscopic, it must be used soon after preparation, or\nit will soften, and lose its brittle quality.\n\nSugar glass is made by dissolving sugar in water and heating it to at least the\n\"hard crack\" stage (approx. 150 Â°C) in the candy making process. Glucose or corn\nsyrup is used to prevent the sugar from recrystallizing, by getting in the way\nof the sugar molecules forming crystals. Cream of tartar, which is an acid, also\nhelps by turning the sugar into glucose and\nfructose.
