The device is meant to rest at a\ncomfortable level on a flat surfaceâsuch as a tabletop or the floorâwhile the\nplayer sits behind it, but it can also used while resting on a players lap. The\ncontroller was designed to be used like an arcade game joystick and featured\nlarger action buttons than the standard SNES controller. It is used with both\nhands, one for the joystick and the other to manipulate the buttons.\n","linknr":217,"url":"Super_Advantage","recorded":1362666575,"links":22,"instances":["fourth_generation"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Super Nintendo Entertainment System","Super Nintendo Entertainment System accessories"],"headings":["Design","In Popular Culture"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/Super-Advantage-Controller.jpg/250px-Super-Advantage-Controller.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/30/Nes_controller.svg/45px-Nes_controller.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/Gameboy_Icon.PNG/18px-Gameboy_Icon.PNG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["history_of_video_game_consoles","fourth_generation"]],"members":["history_of_video_game_consoles"],"related":["Asciiware","Video_game_controller","History_of_video_game_consoles_(fourth_generation)","SNES","NES_Advantage","Joystick","Asciiware","Super_Nintendo_Entertainment_System","Arcade_game","NES_Advantage","Turbo_button"]}
