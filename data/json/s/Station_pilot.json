They\ndo this in classification yards (Great Britain: marshalling yards). Switchers\nmay also make short transfer runs and even be the only motive power on branch\nlines and switching and terminal railroads. The term can also be used to\ndescribe the workers operating these engines or engaged in directing shunting\noperations.\n\nThe typical switcher is optimised for its job, being relatively low-powered but\nwith a high starting tractive effort for getting heavy cars rolling quickly.\nSwitchers are geared to produce high torque but are restricted to low top speeds\nand have small diameter driving wheels. Switchers are rail analogs to tugboats.\n\nUS switchers tend to be larger, with bogies to allow them to be used on tight\nradiuses. European switchers tend to be smaller, with fixed rod-coupled wheels,\nalthough bogie types are sometimes used where very heavy loads are involved,\nsuch as at steelworks.\n\nSwitching is hard work, and heavily used switch engines wear out quickly\nfrom the abuse of constant hard contacts with cars and frequent starting\nand stopping.\n","linknr":252,"url":"Station_pilot","recorded":1362576211,"links":33,"instances":["rail","diesel","vehicle","fuel","railroad","uk","railway_operations","locomotive"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Locomotives"],"headings":["Power types","Non-US shunters","Station pilot","Shed/works pilot","Gallery","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b5/MP15DC.jpg/220px-MP15DC.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf8/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/08168_at_Shackerstone_Station.jpg/220px-08168_at_Shackerstone_Station.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf8/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/Tem_346.jpg/220px-Tem_346.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf8/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/TCDD_DH33121.jpg/220px-TCDD_DH33121.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf8/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/AW_No._2.jpg/220px-AW_No._2.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf8/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/ChME3ME-6750_Vilnius.JPG/180px-ChME3ME-6750_Vilnius.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/UNION_PACIFIC_Y2513_20070228.jpg/180px-UNION_PACIFIC_Y2513_20070228.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/99/Blue_Engines%2C_Market_Street%2C_Houston%2C_Texas_0403091059.jpg/180px-Blue_Engines%2C_Market_Street%2C_Houston%2C_Texas_0403091059.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/82/19870823-LiverpoolStreet-08833.jpg/180px-19870823-LiverpoolStreet-08833.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/14/Class_y.jpg/180px-Class_y.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["shunt","railway_operations"],["hood","vehicle"],["slug","railroad"],["north_eastern_railway","uk"],["coke","fuel"],["pantograph","rail"],["tender","locomotive"],["victorian_railways_f_class","diesel"]],"members":["pantograph","victorian_railways_f_class","hood","coke","slug","north_eastern_railway","shunt","tender"],"related":["Great_Britain","Australia","USA","Pennsylvania_Railroad","Rail_transport","Locomotive","Train","Railroad_car","Shunt_(railway_operations)","Classification_yard","Great_Britain","Branch_line","Switching_and_terminal_railroad","Tractive_effort","Torque","Driving_wheel","Tugboat","Diesel_locomotive","Hood_(vehicle)","Slug_(railroad)","Cow-calf","Electrification","Switzerland","Electric_locomotive","Newcastle_upon_Tyne","North_Eastern_Railway_(UK)","ES1","Shildon_Locomotion_Museum","Shildon","South_Shields","Germany","Coke_(fuel)","Third_rail","Pantograph_(rail)","Greenwood_and_Batley","Armley","Leeds","Middleton_Railway","Tyne_and_Wear_Metro","Hunslet_Engine_Company","Flywheel_energy_storage","GE_three-power_boxcab","Electro-diesel_locomotive","Steam_locomotive","Tank_locomotive","Tender_(locomotive)","Coal_bunker","Heritage_railway","Fireless_locomotive","Germany","Power_station","Turkey","Europe","British_Rail_Class_08","British_Rail_Class_09","English_Electric","Big_Four_British_railway_companies","LMS_diesel_shunters","Netherlands","NS_Class_600","Australia","Victorian_Railways_F_class_(diesel)","British_Rail_Class_14","DB_Class_V_60","Turkish_State_Railways","TCDD_DH33100","TCDD_DH7000","Tanfield_Railway","Sri_Lanka_Railways","Sri_Lanka","Sri_Lanka_Railways","Driving_Van_Trailer","BR_Class_03","Traction_Maintenance_Depot","National_Railway_Museum","York","Heaton_TMD","Newcastle_upon_Tyne","Tanfield_Railway","Gateshead","Armstrong_Whitworth","Vilnius","Lithuania","Railpower_GG20B","Wabtec","EMD_GP20D","Hunslet","Sri_Lanka_Railways","Hydrail_switcher","Road_switcher","Rail_car_mover","Road-rail_vehicle","Tugboat","Unimog"]}
