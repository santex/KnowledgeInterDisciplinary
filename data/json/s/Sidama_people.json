They number 2,966,474 (4.01% of the\npopulation) of whom 149,480 are urban inhabitants, the fifth most populous\nethnic group in Ethiopia. [http://www.csa.gov.et/pdf/Cen2007_firstdraft.pdf \"Census 2007\"], first\ndraft, Table 5 Their language is called Sidaamu-afoo, which according to\nthe 1994 national census was the mother language of 99.5% of this ethnic group.-\n[http://www.csa.gov.et/surveys/Population%20and%20Housing%20Census%201994/-\nsurvey0/data/docs%5Creport%5CAnalytical_Report%5CK07_ana.pdf 1994 Population and\nHousing Census of Ethiopia: Results for Southern Nations, Nationalities and\nPeoples' Region, Vol. 2], Table 2.16 (accessed 30 December 2008) According\nto one authority, the majority of the Sidama practice their traditional beliefs,\nand only in the 1960s that European missionaries came to their region did any\nleave that faith. S. Y. Hameso, Trevor Trueman, Temesgen M.\nErena 1997 However, according to the 1994 national census, only 14.9%\npractice traditional beliefs while the majority (66.8%) are Protestant, 7.7%\nMuslim, 4.6% Catholic, and 2.3% practice Ethiopian Orthodox\nChristianity. 1994 Population and Housing Census of Ethiopia: Results for\nSouthern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples' Region, Vol. 2, Table 2.20\n\nThe Sidama preserved their cultural heritage, including their traditional\nreligion and language until the late 1880s during the conquest by Emperor\nMenelik II. Before this, the Sidama had their own well-\nestablished administrative systems that dated at least to the 9th century,\nthough it was made up of a loose coalition of Sidama kingdoms. These kingdoms\nextended into the Gibe region. As a result of marginalization and since the\nlanguage does not have its own alphabet, very little has been written on\nSidama issues. Many were not able to attend school until after the Derg came\nto power in 1975.\n\nToday, the Sidama area has only a small number of schools, and inadequate health\nservices, though primary education has increased\nrecently. [http://jimmatimes.com/article.cfm?articleID=17040 \"Primary\neducation in Ethiopia\"], Jimma Times The people have repeatedly complained\nthat Sidama doesn't have regional autonomy in the country and asked for the\ngovernment to give the Sidama people their own region. There are several\njustifications for this argument. First, Sidama constitutes about 20% of the\ntotal population in the Southern region  with a\nsignificant economic contribution to the central government. Second, the 40\nsmaller ethnic groups in the region belong to the three main socio-cultural and\nlinguistic groups namely, Kushitic groups: Sidama, Alaba, Tambaro, Qewenna,\nDanta (Dubamo), Maraqo, Konso, Hadiya, Kambata; Omotic groups: Wolayta, Gamo,\nGofa, Dawuro, Konta, etc., and Semitic group: Gurage. After the downfall of the\nMilitary regime in 1991, the Transitional Government endorsed five separate\nregions within the current SNNPR region. These regions were established based on\nsocio-cultural, linguistic and economic similarities. They followed similar\nadministrative arrangement made by the previous regime shortly before its\ndownfall. Sidama, Gedeo and Burji belonged to one of the five independent\nregions within the current SNNPR. However, those five regions were dissolved\nwithout consultation with the peoples of the region. Third, proper\nadministrative arrangement is essential for administrative efficacy, effective\ndelivery of social and economic services and broader economic development.\n\nThose against autonomy argue that with the SNNPR being a condensed region with\nthe most ethnic groups concentrated in a small territory, carving out boundaries\nthat historically never existed and are often violently disputed between\nethnicities in order to give autonomy to the more than 40 ethnic groups is\nvirtually impossible.\n\nNearly 95% of the Sidama live a life centered around agriculture. An important\nstaple food is the wesse plant, or Ensete. Other crops are also grown and they\nbreed cattle. Perhaps the most important source of income is coffee, and the\narea is a major contributor to coffee production, producing a high percentage of\nexport coffee for the central government, second only to the Oromia region. The\nSidama farmers have been affected by hunger caused by declining world market\nprices for coffee, despite supplying the popular coffee chain Starbucks with the\nmajority of their coffee products from the region.\n\nSpirit possession occurs among the Sidama. The anthropologists Irene and John\nHamer postulated that spirit possession is a form of compensation for being\ndeprived within Sidama society. The majority of the possessed are women whose\nspirits demand luxury goods to alleviate their condition, but men can be\npossessed as well. Possessed individuals of both sexes can become healers due to\ntheir condition. Hamer and Hamer suggest that this is a form of compensation\namong deprived men in the deeply competitive society of the Sidama, for if a man\ncannot gain prestige as an orator, warrior, or farmer, he may still gain\nprestige as a spirit healer. Women are sometimes accused of faking possession,\nbut men never are.
