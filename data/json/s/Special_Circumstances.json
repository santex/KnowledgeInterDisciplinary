{"cursor":"8067","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Special Circumstances', abbreviated 'SC', is a 'secret service'-type\norganisation that exists within the fictional anarchist utopian science fiction\ncivilisation known as the Culture. It forms a background and plot device in\nseveral novels and shorter works of Iain M. Banks.\n\nSpecial Circumstances is part of a larger fictional Culture organisation called\nContact, which coordinates Culture interactions with (and in) other\ncivilisations. SC exists to fulfil this role when circumstances exceed the moral\ncapacity of Contact, or where the situation is highly complex and requires\nhighly specialized skills, such as in [[The Player of Games]]. Special\nCircumstances also does the 'dirty work' of the Culture, a function made\nespecially complicated by the normally very high ethical standards the Culture\nsets itself. SC acts in a way that has been compared with the democratising\nintentions of real-world liberal intent on overcoming the world's (and\nespecially other nation's) evils by benign interference.\n\nIn the novels, Special Circumstances often provides the main plot device linking\nthe Culture and other civilisations being intervened in. The 'Good Works' (for\nwhich Special Circumstances does the dirty work) are the wider plot device for\nallowing interaction between the advanced Culture and the 'barbaric' societies\nit tries to improve. In the same vein, Banks has noted that the perfect society\nof the Culture creates well-adjusted, content people - who are (for story\npurposes) rather boring. Interview with Iain M. Banks,\n[[Matter (novel)|Matter]], Orbit, 2008 Therefore, many of the Culture\nnovels deal with outside agents or mercenaries in the employ of Special\nCircumstances.\n","linknr":178,"url":"Special_Circumstances","recorded":1362574283,"links":13,"instances":["the_culture","the_culture"],"pdf":["http://mil.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/30/3/625.pdf"],"categories":["The Culture","Fictional organizations","Fictional military organizations","Fictional intelligence agencies"],"headings":["Interventions","Place in society","Related concepts","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3f/Book_collection.jpg/32px-Book_collection.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["contact","the_culture"],["mind","the_culture"],["contact","the_culture"]],"members":["contact","mind"],"related":["Anarchist","Utopian","The_Culture","Culture_series","Iain_M._Banks","Contact_(The_Culture)","Plot_device","Iain_M._Banks","Mercenary","Covert_operation","Assassination","Clich√©","Iain_M._Banks","Military_intelligence","Special_forces","Mind_(The_Culture)","Bora_Horza_Gobuchul","Diziet_Sma","Progressors","Noon_Universe","Boris_and_Arkady_Strugatsky","Doris_Lessing","Prime_Directive","Star_Trek","Starfleet","Altruism","Enlightened_self-interest","Section_31","Contact_(The_Culture)","Military_Intelligence","The_Culture","Secret_service","Bureau_of_Sabotage"]}
