Instances of single combat are known from\nClassical Antiquity and the Middle Ages.\n\nTypically, it takes place in the no-man's-land between the opposing armies, with\nother warriors watching and themselves refraining from fighting until one of the\ntwo single combatants has won.\n\nBut single combat could also take place within a larger battle. Both ancient and\nmedieval warfare did not always rely on the line or phalanx formation. The Iliad\nnotably describes the battles of the Trojan war as a series of single encounters\non the field, and the medieval code of chivalry, partly inspired by this,\nencouraged the single combat between individual knights on the battlefield, in\nwhich the loser was not usually killed but taken captive for ransom. This\ntradition ended in the 14th century due to the use of the longbow and the pike\nsquare against mounted knights (Battle of CrÃ©cy, Battle of Laupen), and the\ntradition of single combat was continued away from the battlefield, with the\n[[pas d'armes]] and the early modern duel.\n","linknr":244,"url":"Single_combat","recorded":1362484550,"links":19,"instances":["branch","heroic_literature","consul_30_bc","mythology","northern_kerala","formation"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Interpersonal conflict","Combat"],"headings":["Antiquity","Middle Ages","Modern examples","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Ambox_globe_content.svg/48px-Ambox_globe_content.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f0/Naresuanbattlelephnt.jpg/350px-Naresuanbattlelephnt.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8e/Peresv_b.jpg/240px-Peresv_b.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["line","formation"],["paris","mythology"],["marcus_licinius_crassus","consul_30_bc"],["math_fab_mathonwy","branch"],["romance","heroic_literature"],["malabar","northern_kerala"]],"members":["math_fab_mathonwy","romance","marcus_licinius_crassus","paris","malabar","line"],"related":["Siam","Naresuan","Samut_Prakan","Thailand","Battle","Champion","Classical_Antiquity","Middle_Ages","No-man's-land","Battle","Ancient_warfare","Medieval_warfare","Line_(formation)","Phalanx_formation","Iliad","Chivalry","Knight","Ransom","English_longbow","Pike_square","Battle_of_Crécy","Battle_of_Laupen","Duel","The_Tale_of_Sinuhe","Ancient_Egyptian_literature","Retjenu","Canaan","Iliad","Menelaus","Paris_(mythology)","Achilles","Hector","Hebrew_Bible","David","Goliath","Ancient_Rome","Horatii","Alba_Longa","Livy","Marcus_Claudius_Marcellus","Viridomarus","Gaesatae","Battle_of_Clastidium","Marcus_Licinius_Crassus_(consul_30_BC)","Bastarnae","Mahābhārata","Ramayana","Romance_of_the_Three_Kingdoms","The_Cattle_Raid_of_Cooley","Irish_Mythology","Ulster","Cúchulainn","Welsh_Mythology","Math_fab_Mathonwy_(Branch)","Four_Branches_of_the_Mabinogi","Kingdom_of_Dyfed","Pryderi","Kingdom_of_Gwynedd","Chanson_de_Roland","Arabian_Nights","Guy_of_Warwick","Romance_(heroic_literature)","Viking","Athelstan_of_England","Geoffrey_of_Monmouth","Nennius_of_Britain","Julius_Caesar","Pre-Islamic","Arabia","Islamic","Battle_of_Badr","Early_history_of_Islam","Mecca","Muhammad","Battle_of_Uhud","Battle_of_the_Trench","Battle_of_Khaybar","Samurai","Nestor_the_Chronicler","Kievan_Rus'","Mstislav_of_Chernigov","Tmutarakan","Circassians","Rededia","Russian_nobility","Alexander_Peresvet","Golden_Horde","Battle_of_Kulikovo","Legend","Saddle","Kerala","British_Raj","Nair","Ezhava","Chekavar","Malayalam","Thacholi_Othenan","Unniarcha","Aromal_Chekavar","Mamankam","Zamorin","Kozhikode","Malabar_(Northern_Kerala)","War_elephants","Burma","Siam","Naresuan","John_Smith_of_Jamestown","Knight","Transylvania","Sigismund_Báthory","Coat_of_Arms","Ben_Jonson","William_Drummond_of_Hawthornden","Low_Countries","Francis_Vere","Dogfight","World_War_I","Manfred_von_Richthofen","History_of_fencing","Wager_of_battle","Duel","Hand-to-hand_combat"]}
