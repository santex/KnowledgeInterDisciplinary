{"cursor":"3075","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Symphony No. 1' in B flat major, Op. 38 (\"Spring\") was the first symphonic work\ncomposed by Robert Schumann. Although Schumann made some \"symphonic attempts\" in\nthe autumn of 1840 soon after he married his beloved Clara Wieck, he did not\ncompose his First Symphony until early 1841. Schumann sketched the symphony in\nfour days from 23 January to 26 January and completed the orchestration within a\nmonth by 20 February. The premiere took place under the baton of Felix\nMendelssohn on 31 March 1841 in Leipzig. The symphony was warmly received. Until\nSchumann composed this symphony, he was largely known for his works for the\npiano and for voice. Clara encouraged him to write symphonic music. The title of\n\"Spring Symphony\" was bestowed upon it, according to Clara's diary, because of\nthe Spring poems of Adolph Boettger. However, Schumann himself said he was\nmerely inspired by his LiebesfrÃ¼hling (spring of love). The last movement of the\nsymphony also uses the final theme of [[Kreisleriana]], and therefore recalls\nthe romantic and fantastic inspiration of this piano composition.\n\nThe symphony has four movements. They are marked:\n\n# Andante un poco maestoso â Allegro molto vivace (B flat major) Larghetto (E\n# flat major) Scherzo: Molto vivace â Trio I: Molto piu vivace â Trio II (G\n# minor) Allegro animato e grazioso (B flat major)\n\nThe orchestration is for 2 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets, 2 bassoons, 4 horns, 2\ntrumpets, 3 trombones, timpani, triangle and strings. Schumann especially\nexpanded the use of timpani in this revolutionary piece. Bowles, \"Timpani''.\npp.55–57 Schumann made some revisions until the definitive full-\nscore of the symphony was published in 1853. The playing time of the symphony is\nabout 29-31 minutes, depending upon the interpretation.\n","linknr":128,"url":"Symphony_No._1_(Schumann)","recorded":1362575284,"links":20,"instances":["instrument"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Symphonies by Robert Schumann|1","1841 compositions","Compositions in B-flat major"],"headings":["Selected discography","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["triangle","instrument"]],"members":["triangle"],"related":["Symphonic","Robert_Schumann","Clara_Schumann","Orchestration","Felix_Mendelssohn","Leipzig","Piano","Voice","Flute","Oboe","Clarinet","Bassoon","French_horn","Trumpet","Trombone","Timpani","Triangle_(instrument)","String_section","Evolution_of_Timpani_in_the_18th_and_19th_centuries","Berliner_Philharmoniker","Rafael_Kubelík","Deutsche_Grammophon","Berliner_Philharmoniker","Herbert_von_Karajan","Deutsche_Grammophon","Cleveland_Orchestra","George_Szell","Vienna_Philharmonic","Leonard_Bernstein","Orchestre_Révolutionnaire_et_Romantique","Sir_John_Eliot_Gardiner","Staatskapelle_Dresden","Wolfgang_Sawallisch"]}
