The\noriginal item of value being offered may be either tangible or intangible. The\nsecond item, usually money, is most often seen by the seller as being of equal\nor greater value than that being offered for sale.\n\nA person or organization expressing an interest in acquiring the offered item of\nvalue is referred to as a potential buyer, prospective customer or prospect.\nBuying and selling are understood to be two sides of the same \"coin\" or\ntransaction. Both seller and buyer engage in a process of negotiation to\nconsummate the exchange of values. The exchange, or selling, process has implied\nrules and identifiable stages. It is implied that the selling process will\nproceed fairly and ethically so that the parties end up nearly equally rewarded.\nThe stages of selling, and buying, involve getting acquainted, assessing each\npartyâs need for the otherâs item of value, and determining if the values to be\nexchanged are equivalent or nearly so, or, in buyer's terms, \"worth the price.â\n\nFrom a management viewpoint it is thought of as a part of marketing, Philip\nKotler, Principles of Marketing, Prentice -Hall, 1980 although the skills\nrequired are different. Sales often forms a separate grouping in a corporate\nstructure, employing separate specialist operatives known as salespersons\n(singular: salesperson). Selling is considered by many to be a sort of\npersuading \"art\". Contrary to popular belief, the methodological approach of\nselling refers to a systematic process of repetitive and measurable milestones,\nby which a salesman relates his or her offering of a product or service in\nreturn enabling the buyer to achieve their goal in an economic way.
