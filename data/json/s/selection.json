Under selection, individuals\nwith advantages or \"adaptive\" traits tend to be more successful than their peers\nreproductivelyâ€”meaning they contribute more offspring to the succeeding\ngeneration than others do. When these traits have a genetic basis, selection can\nincrease the prevalence of those traits, because offspring will inherit those\ntraits from their parents. When selection is intense and persistent, adaptive\ntraits become universal to the population or species, which may then be said to\nhave evolved.\n","title":"selection","headings":["Overview","Types and subtypes","See also","Further reading"]},"micro-relation":["3: Artificial_selection","3: Sexual_selection","3: Balancing_selection","2: Evolution","2: Natural_selection","2: Ecological_selection","2: Stabilizing_selection","2: Disruptive_selection","2: Directional_selection","1: Allele","1: Genes","1: Genetics","1: Embryo","1: Ovum","1: Sperm","1: Genetic_drift","1: Small_population_size","1: Purifying_selection","1: Diversifying_selection","1: Disassortative_sexual_selection","1: Frequency-dependent_selection","1: Overdominance"]}
