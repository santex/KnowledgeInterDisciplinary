{"cursor":"5255","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n on a clay tablet, Neo-Assyrian period. Ref:.]] 'Synonyms' are words with the\n same or similar meanings. Words that are synonyms are said to be 'synonymous',\n and the state of being a synonym is called 'synonymy'. The word comes from\n Ancient Greek syn () (\"with\") and onoma () (\"name\"). An example of synonyms are\n the words begin and commence. Likewise, if we talk about a long time or an\n extended time, long and extended become synonyms. In the figurative sense, two\n words are often said to be synonymous if they have the same connotation:\n\n:\"a widespread impression that... Hollywood was synonymous with immorality\"\n:(Doris Kearns Goodwin)\n\nSynonyms can be any part of speech (such as nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs or\nprepositions), as long as both words are the same part of speech. Here are more\nexamples of English synonyms:\n\n*verb **\"buy\" and \"purchase\" *adjective **\"big\" and \"large\" *adverb **\"quickly\"\nand \"speedily\" *preposition **\"on\" and \"upon\"\n\nNote that synonyms are defined with respect to certain senses of words; for\ninstance, pupil as the \"aperture in the iris of the eye\" is not synonymous with\nstudent. Likewise, he expired means the same as he died, yet my passport has\nexpired cannot be replaced by my passport has died.\n\nIn English, many synonyms emerged in the Middle Ages, after the Norman conquest\nof England. While England's new ruling class spoke Norman French, the lower\nclasses continued to speak Old English (Anglo-Saxon). Thus, today we have\nsynonyms like the Norman-derived \"people\", \"liberty\" and \"archer\", and the Saxon-\nderived \"folk\", \"freedom\" and \"bowman\". For more examples, see the list of\nGermanic and Latinate equivalents in English.\n\nSome lexicographers claim that no synonyms have exactly the same meaning (in all\ncontexts or social levels of language) because etymology, orthography, phonic\nqualities, ambiguous meanings, usage, etc. make them unique. Different words\nthat are similar in meaning usually differ for a reason: feline is more formal\nthan cat; long and extended are only synonyms in one usage and not in others\n(for example, a long arm is not the same as an extended arm). Synonyms are also\na source of euphemisms.\n\nThe purpose of a thesaurus is to offer the user a listing of similar or related\nwords; these are often, but not always, synonyms.\n","linknr":239,"url":"Synonymous","recorded":1362480293,"links":85,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Lexical semantics","Types of words"],"headings":["Related terms","See also","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/64/Library_of_Ashurbanipal_synonym_list_tablet.jpg/220px-Library_of_Ashurbanipal_synonym_list_tablet.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Neo-Assyrian","Ancient_Greek_language","Doris_Kearns_Goodwin","Part_of_speech","Noun","Verbs","Adjective","Adverb","Preposition","Middle_Ages","Norman_conquest_of_England","England","Norman_French","Old_English","List_of_Germanic_and_Latinate_equivalents_in_English","Lexicographer","Etymology","Orthography","Euphemism","Thesaurus","-onym","Synonym_ring","Cognitive_synonymy"]}
