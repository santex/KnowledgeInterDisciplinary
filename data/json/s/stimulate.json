For example, an interesting or fun\nactivity can be described as \"stimulating\", regardless of its physical effects\non nerves.\n\nStimulation is used in the petroleum industry to describe activities that\nimprove the production of wells. This often includes the pumping of reactive\nfluids such as hydrochloric acid to remove or bypass damaged rock. Hydraulic\nfracturing is an extreme example of well stimulation.\n\nIt is also used in simulation technology to describe a synthetically produced\nsignal that triggers (stimulates) real equipment, see below.\n\n(Note)Stimulate means act as stimulus to, stimulus means things that rouses to\nactivity, now rouses means exciting, stirring.\n","linknr":121,"url":"stimulate","recorded":1362672345,"links":18,"instances":["medicine","psychology","physiology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Perception","Behavioral concepts"],"headings":["Overview","Use in Simulators and Simulation Technology","Over-stimulation","Well Stimulation","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["stimulus","physiology"],["stress","medicine"],["burnout","psychology"],["stimulus","physiology"],["stress","medicine"]],"members":["stress","burnout","stimulus"],"related":["Stimulus_(physiology)","Nerve","Muscle","Action_potential","Stimulus-response_model","Stress_(medicine)","Coping_mechanism","R&D","Simulate","Habituation","Television","Withdrawal","ADHD","Hypoadrenia","Sensory_overload","Burnout_(psychology)","Psychomotor_agitation","Stimulus_(physiology)","Stimming","Irritation","Hypoadrenia","Stress_(medicine)","Stress_management","Sexual_stimulation"]}
