The Senate is modelled after the House of Lords and consists of 105\nmembers appointed by the governor general on the advice of the prime\nminister. Franco, 2006, pg. 3â42. Seats are assigned on a\nregional basis, with each of the four major regions receiving 24 seats, and the\nremainder of the available seats being assigned to smaller regions. The four\nmajor regions are Ontario, Quebec, the Maritime provinces, and the Western\nprovinces. The seats for Newfoundland and Labrador, the Northwest Territories,\nYukon, and Nunavut are assigned apart from these regional divisions. Senators\nmay serve until they reach the age of 75.\n\nThe Senate is the upper house of Parliament, and the House of Commons is the\nlower house. This does not, however, imply that the Senate is more powerful than\nthe House of Commons, merely that its members and officers outrank the members\nand officers of the House of Commons in the order of precedence for the purposes\nof protocol. Indeed, as a matter of practice and custom, the Commons is by far\nthe dominant chamber. Although the approval of both houses is necessary for\nlegislation, the Senate rarely rejects bills passed by the directly elected\nCommons. Moreover, the government is responsible solely to the House of Commons;\nthe Prime Minister of Canada and Cabinet stay in office only while they retain\nthe confidence of the Commons. The Senate does not exercise any such control.\nAlthough legislation can normally be introduced in either house, the majority of\ngovernment bills originate in the House of Commons. Under the Constitution,\nmoney bills must always originate in the House of Commons.\n","linknr":1162,"url":"Senate_of_Canada","recorded":1362559999,"links":61,"instances":["heraldry","canadian_politician","domicile","vote","canada","canada","canada","canada","canada","canada","canada","canada","constitutional","proposed_law"],"pdf":["http://www.parl.gc.ca/information/library/PRBpubs/bp316-e.pdf","http://www.parl.gc.ca/information/library/PRBpubs/bp316-e.pdf"],"categories":["Government
