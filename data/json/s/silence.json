      "text" : "\n'Silence' is the lack of audible sound or presence of sounds of very low\nintensity. By analogy, the word silence can also refer to any absence of\ncommunication, including in media other than\nspeech.<ref>http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/silence</ref> Silence is\nalso used as total communication, in reference to non verbal communication and\nspiritual connection. Silence also refers to no sounds uttered by anybody in a\nroom or area. Silence is an important factor in many cultural spectacles, as\nin rituals.\n\nIn discourse analysis, speakers use brief absences of speech to mark the\nboundaries of prosodic units. Silence in speech can be hesitation, stutters, self-\ncorrection—or deliberate slowing of speech to clarify or aid processing of\nideas. These are short silences. Longer pauses in language occur in interactive\nroles, reactive tokens, or turn-taking.\n\nAccording to cultural norms, silence can be positive or negative. For example,\nin a Christian Methodist faith organization silence and reflection during the\nsermons might be appreciated by the congregation, while in a Southern Baptist\nchurch, silence might mean disagreement with what is being said, or perhaps\ndisconnectedness from the congregated community.\n",
