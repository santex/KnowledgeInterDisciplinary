In the [[Commedia dell'arte]] it was an outline of entrances, exits, and\naction describing the plot of a play that was literally pinned to the back of\nthe scenery. It is also known as [[canovaccio]] or \"that which is pinned to the\ncanvas\" of which the scenery was constructed.\n\nSurviving scenarios from the Renaissance contain little other than character\nnames, brief descriptions of action, and references to specific lazzi with no\nfurther explanation. It is believed that a scenario forms the basis of a fully\nimprovisational performance though it is also likely that they were simple\nreminders of the plot for those members of the cast who were literate. Modern\ncommedia troupes most often make use of a script with varying degrees of\nadditional improvisation.\n\nIn the creation of an opera or ballet, a scenario is often developed initially\nto indicate how the original source, if any, is to be adapted and to summarize\nthe aspects of character, staging, plot, etc. that can be expanded later in a\nfully developed libretto, or script. This sketch can be helpful in \"pitching\"\nthe idea to a prospective producer, director or composer.\n","title":"scenario","headings":["Other uses","References"]},"micro-relation":["1: Italian_language","1: Greek_language","1: Renaissance","1: Lazzi","1: Improvisational_theatre","1: Opera","1: Ballet","1: Libretto","1: Theatrical_producer","1: Theatre_director","1: Composer","1: Organization_development","1: Scenario_planning","1: Scenario_analysis","1: Futures_studies"]}
