{"cursor":"35964","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nIn finance, an 'option' is a contract which gives the owner the right, but not\nthe obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset or instrument at a specified\nstrike price on or before a specified date. The seller incurs a corresponding\nobligation to fulfill the transaction, that is to sell or buy, if the long\nholder elects to \"exercise\" the option prior to expiration. The buyer pays a\npremium to the seller for this right. An option which conveys the right to buy\nsomething at a specific price is called a '[[call option|call]]'; an option\nwhich conveys the right to sell something at a specific price is called a '[[put\noption|put]]'. Both are commonly traded, though in basic finance for clarity the\ncall option is more frequently discussed, as it moves in the same direction as\nthe underlying asset, rather than opposite, as does the put.\n\nOptions valuation is a topic of ongoing research in academic and practical\nfinance. For simplicity of discussion, the value of an option is commonly\ndecomposed into two parts: The first of these is the \"intrinsic value,\" which is\ndefined as the difference between the market value of the underlying and the\nstrike price of the given option. The second part depends on a set of other\nfactors which, through a multi-variable, non-linear interrelationship, reflect\nthe discounted expected value of that difference at expiration. Although options\nvaluation has been studied at least since the nineteenth century, the\ncontemporary approach is based on the BlackâScholes model which was first\npublished in 1973. Eric Benhamou, Options pre-Black Scholes http://www.ericbenhamou.net/documents/Encyclo/Pre%20Black-\nScholes.pdf Black, Fischer; Myron Scholes (1973). \"The Pricing of\nOptions and Corporate Liabilities\". Journal of Political Economy 81 (3):\n637â654\n\nOptions contracts have been known for many centuries, however both trading\nactivity and academic interest increased when, starting in 1973, options were\nissued with standardized terms and traded through a guaranteed clearinghouse at\nthe Chicago Board Options Exchange. Today many options are created in a\nstandardized form and traded through clearinghouses on regulated options\nexchanges, while other over-the-counter options are written as bilateral,\ncustomized contracts between a single buyer and seller, one or both of which may\nbe a dealer or market-maker. Options are part of a larger class of financial\ninstruments known as derivative products, or simply, derivatives.\n{{Citation |last=Brealey |first=Richard A. |author-link=Richard A.
