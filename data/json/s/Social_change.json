{"cursor":"7388","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n'Social change' refers to an alteration in the social order of a society. The\nbase of social change is change in the thought process in humans. It may refer\nto the notion of social progress or sociocultural evolution, the philosophical\nidea that society moves forward by dialectical or evolutionary means. It may\nrefer to a paradigmatic change in the socio-economic structure, for instance a\nshift away from feudalism and towards capitalism. Accordingly it may also refer\nto social revolution, such as the Socialist revolution presented in Marxism, or\nto other social movements, such as Women's suffrage or the Civil rights\nmovement. Social change may be driven by cultural, religious, economic,\nscientific or technological forces.\n\nMore generally, social change may include changes in nature, social\ninstitutions, social behaviours, or social relations.\n","linknr":225,"url":"Social_change","recorded":1362685198,"links":26,"instances":["disambiguation","society"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Social change|","Social movements","Social issues","Sociology index"],"headings":["Prominent theories of social change","Some major current social changes","See also","Notes","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c7/SNA_segment.png/180px-SNA_segment.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["nature","society"],["rationalization","disambiguation"]],"members":["rationalization","nature"],"related":["Social_order","Society","Social_progress","Sociocultural_evolution","Dialectical","Evolutionary","Feudalism","Capitalism","Social_revolution","Socialist","Marxism","Social_movements","Women's_suffrage","Civil_rights_movement","Nature_(society)","Social_institution","Social_behaviour","Social_relations","Hegelian","Marxism","Social_class","Philosopher_of_science","Thomas_Kuhn","Copernicus","Heraclitus","SEED-SCALE","Complexity_Theory","Emergence","Dao_De_Jing","Jacque_Fresco","The_Venus_Project","The_Venus_Project","Constitutional_economics","Globalization","History","Idea_of_Progress","Industrialisation","Modernisation","Rationalization_(disambiguation)","Revolution","Secularisation","Social_decline","Social_development_theory","Social_disintegration","Social_movement","Social_progress","Social_relations","Societal_collapse","Sociocultural_evolution","Harper_Collins"]}
