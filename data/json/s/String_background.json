{"cursor":"857","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nIn theoretical physics, a 'string background' refers to the set of classical\nvalues of quantum fields in spacetime that correspond to classical solutions of\nstring theory. Such a background is associated with geometry that solves\nEinstein's equations (with higher order corrections) or their generalizations\nand with the values of other fields. These fields may encode the information\nabout the shape of the hidden dimensions; the size of various electromagnetic\nfields and their generalizations; the values of fluxes; and the presence of\nadditional objects such as D-branes and orientifold planes. The full physics of\nstring theory can always be thought of as a system of infinitely many quantum\nfields expanded around a given string background.\n","linknr":91,"url":"String_background","recorded":1362898520,"links":15,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["String theory"],"headings":[],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/54/Science.jpg/30px-Science.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Theoretical_physics","Quantum_field","Spacetime","String_theory","Einstein's_equations","D-brane","Orientifold"]}
