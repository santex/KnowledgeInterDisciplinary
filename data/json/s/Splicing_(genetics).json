{"cursor":"15510","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In molecular biology and genetics, 'splicing' is a modification of the nascent\npre-mRNA taking place after or concurrently with its transcription, in which\nintrons are removed and exons are joined. This is needed for the typical\neukaryotic messenger RNA before it can be used to produce a correct protein\nthrough translation. For many eukaryotic introns, splicing is done in a series\nof reactions which are catalyzed by the spliceosome, a complex of small nuclear\nribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), but there are also self-splicing introns.\n","linknr":424,"url":"Splicing_(genetics)","recorded":1362374368,"links":46,"instances":["biology","biology","gene","biology","genetics"],"pdf":["http://www.springerlink.com/content/tu4144hm703k5713/fulltext.pdf","http://www.springerlink.com/content/tu4144hm703k5713/fulltext.pdf"],"categories":["Gene expression","Spliceosome","RNA splicing|"],"headings":["Splicing pathways","Evolution","Biochemical mechanism","Alternative splicing","Experimental manipulation of splicing","Splicing errors","Protein splicing","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Pre-mRNA_to_mRNA.svg/350px-Pre-mRNA_to_mRNA.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/Intron_miguelferig.jpg/450px-Intron_miguelferig.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/Two-step_Splicing_Reaction.png/400px-Two-step_Splicing_Reaction.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["transcription","genetics"],["translation","biology"],["sf1","gene"],["kingdom","biology"],["domain","biology"]],"members":["domain","kingdom","sf1","translation","transcription"],"related":["Molecular_biology","Genetics","Pre-mRNA","Transcription_(genetics)","Introns","Exons","Eukaryotic","Messenger_RNA","Translation_(biology)","Catalysis","Spliceosome","SnRNP","Catalyst","Eucaryote","Pyrimidine","Polypyrimidine_tract","Nucleic_acid_notation","Mature_messenger_RNA","Point_mutation","Indel","Spliceosome","SnRNP","SnRNP","U1_spliceosomal_RNA","U2_spliceosomal_RNA","U4_spliceosomal_RNA","U5_spliceosomal_RNA","U6_spliceosomal_RNA","SnRNP","U2AF2","SF1_(gene)","Minor_spliceosome","SnRNP","U11_spliceosomal_RNA","U12_minor_spliceosomal_RNA","Trans-splicing","Intron","Ribozyme","RNA_world","TRNA","Ribonuclease","Ligases","Kingdom_(biology)","Domain_(biology)","Eukaryote","MRNA","Non-coding_RNA","Prokaryote","Transesterification","Nucleophilic_attack","Alternative_splicing","Morpholino","Peptide_nucleic_acid","Stop_codon","Reading_frame","Nonsense-mediated_mRNA_decay","Intein","Exteins","Archaea","CDNA","Exon","Intron","Primary_transcript","Spliceosome","Minor_spliceosome","Exon_Junction_Complex","SWAP_protein_domain"]}
