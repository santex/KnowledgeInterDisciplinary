These are alternately described as the world's leading journals\nof science and technology, because of a rigorous selection process.\n\nThe index is made available online through the Web of Science database, a part\nof the Web of Knowledge collection of databases. (There are also CD and printed\neditions, covering a smaller number of journals). This database allows a\nresearcher to identify which later articles have cited any particular earlier\narticle, or cited the articles of any particular author, or determine which\narticles have been cited most frequently. Thomson Reuters also markets several\nsubsets of this database, termed \"Specialty Citation Indexes\", such as the 'Neuroscience Citation Index'\nand the 'Chemistry Citation Index'.\n","linknr":187,"url":"Science_Citation_Index","recorded":1362506134,"links":26,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Bibliographic databases","Online databases","Citation indices","Thomson Reuters"],"headings":["See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/75/Science-symbol-2.svg/30px-Science-symbol-2.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Citation_index","Institute_for_Scientific_Information","Eugene_Garfield","Thomson_Reuters","Scientific_journal","Science","Technology","Web_of_Science","Web_of_Knowledge","Arts_and_Humanities_Citation_Index","Impact_factor","List_of_academic_databases_and_search_engines","Social_Sciences_Citation_Index"]}
