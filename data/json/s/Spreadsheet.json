{"cursor":"58577","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'spreadsheet' is an interactive computer application program for organization\nand analysis of data in tabular form. Spreadsheets developed as computerized\nsimulations of paper accounting worksheets. The program operates on data\nrepresented as cells of an array, organized in rows and columns. Each cell of\nthe array is a modelâviewâcontroller element that can contain either numeric or\ntext data, or the results of formulas that automatically calculate and display a\nvalue based on the contents of other cells.\n\nThe user of the spreadsheet can make changes in any stored value and observe the\neffects on calculated values. This makes the spreadsheet useful for \"what-if\"\nanalysis since many cases can be rapidly investigated without tedious manual\nrecalculation. Modern spreadsheet software can have multiple interacting sheets,\nand can display data either as text and numerals, or in graphical form.\n\nIn addition to the fundamental operations of arithmetic and mathematical\nfunctions, modern spreadsheets provide built-in functions for common financial\nand statistical operations. Such calculations as net present value or standard\ndeviation can be applied to tabular data with a pre-programmed function in a\nformula. Spreadsheet programs also provide conditional expressions, functions to\nconvert between text and numbers, and functions that operate on strings of text.\n\nSpreadsheets have now replaced paper-based systems throughout the business\nworld. Although they were first developed for accounting or bookkeeping tasks,\nthey now are used extensively in any context where tabular lists are built,\nsorted, and shared.\n\nVisicalc was the first electronic spreadsheet on a microcomputer, and it helped\nturn the Apple II computer into a popular and widely used system. Lotus 1-2-3\nwas the leading spreadsheet when DOS was the dominant operating system. Excel\nnow has the largest market share on the Windows and Macintosh\nplatforms. A spreadsheet program is a standard\nfeature of an office productivity suite; since the advent of web apps, office\nsuites now also exist in web app form.\n","linknr":665,"url":"Spreadsheet","recorded":1362505118,"links":69,"instances":["mathematics","programming","software","software","information","computer_science","graph_theory","mathematics","programming","computing","computer_science","programming","office_suite","programming_language","computer_science","computer_science","knowledge","programming","data_structure","magazine"],"pdf":["http://lumina.com/dlana/papers/Whats%20wrong%20with%20spreadsheets.pdf","http://lumina.com/dlana/papers/Whats%20wrong%20with%20spreadsheets.pdf","http://www.cs.uiowa.edu/~jcryer/JSMTalk2001.pdf","http://download.microsoft.com/download/4/6/1/461062F0-2D3E-4620-890E-826CE55D27B9/SpreadsheetsandCapitalMarkets.pdf","http://download.microsoft.com/download/4/6/1/461062F0-2D3E-4620-890E-826CE55D27B9/SpreadsheetsandCapitalMarkets.pdf"],"categories":["Spreadsheet
