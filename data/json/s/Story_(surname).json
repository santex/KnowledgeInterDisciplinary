{"cursor":"6861","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nThe distinguished surname 'Story' (and its variant spelling Storey) originates\nfrom the Old Norse personal epithet âStÃ³riâ, a derivative of âStorrâ which means\nâlargeâ or âbigâ. Even though it has been established that the root of the name\nis âStorrâ, R.E.K. Rigbeye, in his book The Storeyâs of Old claims that the\nsuffix âey[e]â, in the variant of Storey, is equivalent to the Icelandic âigâ\nand signifies âwaterâ. According to him, âStorrâ also denotes large in the sense\nof vast and rough. Rigbeyeâs assumption therefore, is that âStoreyâ means\n\"dweller by large and rough water\". This may be explained by the Norse affility\nto sea exploration, or the fact that the first Storys settled near the Lake\nDistrict, and so the name might refer to the habitation which they chose. The\nearliest Norse settlement of which the first Storys would have been a part, took\nplace in the 9th century north of Carlisle near the Solway Firth. This area then\nknown as Strathclyde, was situated in the northwestern part of England, along\nthe Scottish border. The earliest Storys would have settled on the English side\nof the border, most likely in the plains along the river Eden. The English or\nAnglo-Saxon population, among whom the Norse settled, spoke a similar language\nbut pronounced many words in a different way. So, âStorrâ among the Norse would\nhave been enunciated as âStyrâ in English.\n\nOne of the earliest mentions of the name is âStyr (Saxon for Stor) who gave the\nmanor of Durham with other places to the Abbot of Lindisfarne in the year 999\nA.D.â (Symeonis Dunelmensis, vol I, pp. 150â154.) The forenames Stori and Estori\n(without surname) are recorded in the Domesday Book of 1066 (Derbyshire), a\nsurvey of England conducted for William the Conqueror. Those who bore such names\nwere of Norse blood. (The Scandinavian \"Stor\", \"Stori\" and \"Storius\" occur prior\nto Domesday Survey.) Afterwards, the name can be traced down in the Northern\nEnglish counties, particularly Yorkshire. The surname Story is first found in\nthe 1248 Feet of Fines or Fine Court Rolls of Essex, and shows to be that of a\ncertain Alexander (Essex Arch. Soc. 4 Vols, 1899 - 1964). A âReginaldus filius\n[son of] Storyâ is mentioned in the Assize Court Rolls of Yorkshire (1219) (York\nArch. Soc. 44, 100, 1911, 1939; Seldon Soc. 56, 1937). The surname from this\nsource is first recorded circa 1250. Other spellings of the name are Stori\n(William, 1281), with Storre and Staury, the 1379 Poll Tax Returns Records of\nYorkshire. More examples of various spellings include: Alan le Storeys 1272,\nRicus Stury or Storey 1350, Johannes Storey, Rector of Richmondshire 1429, Dr\nEdward Storey or Story 1464, John Story 1476, Nicholas Storie of Liddesdale\n1590, Thomas Story of Wall 1666.\n\nDuring the reign of Edward I (1272 to 1307), the kingdoms of England and\nScotland went to war, and for the next 300 years, the Storys found themselves\nentangled in the Border wars between the two kingdoms. A coat of arms was\nbestowed on the family by (or during the reign of) Richard II of England\n(reigned 1377-1399). It shows a shield with a blazon of argent (silver)\nthereupon a lion rampant double queued (two-tailed) purple charged on its\nshoulder with a so-called âcross pattÃ©eâ in argent (silver), the crest\nconsisting of the face of a leopard out of a ducal crown (coronet). A bloody\nfeud between the Stor(e)ys and Grahams in the 16th century, forced many family\nmembers to migrate eastward from the region surrounding the City of Carlisle, to\nNorthumberland in the east.\n\nThe name may refer to many people:\n\n* Alfred Thomas Story (1842â1934), English journalist, poet and author of\n  numerous books\n* Bonnie Story, American Emmy Award-winning choreographer\n* Carl Story (1916â1995), influential bluegrass musician and leader of the\n  \"Rambling Mountaineers\"\n* Christopher Story (1938â2010), a British writer, publisher and\n  government adviser\n* Edward Story (15th-centuryâ1503), English Bishop\n* George Warter Story (1664â1721), English clergyman\n* Henri Story (1897â1944), Belgian businessman and liberal politician in Ghent\n* Jack Trevor Story (1917â1991), British novelist\n* Jamie Story\n* Jeff Story born 1962, Shelton, Wa, Website http://www.jeffstory.org\n* John Story (1504â1571), English martyr\n* John Douglas Story (1869â1966), Australian public servant\n* Joseph Story (1779â1845), American jurist\n* Karl Story (born 1967), American comic book artist\n* Laura Story, singer-songwriter from Spartanburg, South Carolina\n* Liz Story (born 1956), American pianist\n* Luther H.
