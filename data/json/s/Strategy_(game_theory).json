Ben Polak Game Theory: Lecture 1 Transcript ECON 159,\n5 September 2007, Open Yale Courses. A player's strategy will determine\nthe action the player will take at any stage of the game.\n\nThe 'strategy' concept is sometimes (wrongly) confused with that of a 'move'. A\n'move' is an action taken by a player at some point during the play of a game\n(e.g., in chess, moving white's Bishop a2 to b3). A 'strategy' on the other hand\nis a complete algorithm for playing the game, telling a player what to do for\nevery possible situation throughout the game.\n\nA 'strategy profile' (sometimes called a 'strategy combination') is a set of\nstrategies for all players which fully specifies all actions in a game. A\nstrategy profile must include one and only one strategy for every player.\n","linknr":290,"url":"Strategy_(game_theory)","recorded":1362675939,"links":25,"instances":["graph_theory","game"],"pdf":["http://www.ma.huji.ac.il/raumann/pdf/what%20is%20game%20theory.pdf","http://www.ma.huji.ac.il/raumann/pdf/what%20is%20game%20theory.pdf"],"categories":["Game theory"],"headings":["Strategy set","Pure and mixed strategies","Mixed strategy","See also","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["player","game"],["haven","graph_theory"]],"members":["haven","player"],"related":["Player_(game)","Game_theory","Ben_Polak","Open_Yale_Courses","Algorithm","Rock-paper-scissors","Auction","Fair_division","Dynamic_game","Robot","Software_agent","Ultimatum_game","Bayesian_game","Probability","Equilibrium_refinement","Trembling_hand_perfect_equilibrium","Coordination_game","Payoff_matrix","Coordination_game","John_Forbes_Nash","Nash_equilibrium","Matching_pennies","Coordination_game","Prisoner's_dilemma","Stag_hunt","Random_number_generator","Ariel_Rubinstein","Rock-paper-scissors","Kuhn's_Theorem","Nash_equilibrium","Haven_(graph_theory)","Evolutionarily_stable_strategy"]}
