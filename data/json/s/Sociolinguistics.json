Sociolinguistics\ndiffers from sociology of language in that the focus of sociolinguistics is the\neffect of the society on the language, while the sociology of language focuses\non language's effect on the society. Sociolinguistics overlaps to a considerable\ndegree with pragmatics. It is historically closely related to linguistic\nanthropology and the distinction between the two fields has even been questioned\nrecently.

As the usage of a\nlanguage varies from place to place, language usage also varies among social\nclasses, and it is these [[sociolect]]s that sociolinguistics studies.\n\nThe social aspects of language were in the modern sense first studied by Indian\nand Japanese linguists in the 1930s, and also by Louis Gauchat in Switzerland in\nthe early 1900s, but none received much attention in the West until much later.\nThe study of the social motivation of language change, on the other hand, has\nits foundation in the wave model of the late 19th century. The first attested\nuse of the term sociolinguistics was by Thomas Callan Hodson in the title of a\n1939 paper. [http://www.ncl.ac.uk/ss15/papers/paper_details.php?id=304 T.
