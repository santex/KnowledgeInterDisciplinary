For\na mathematical description, see the article [[Standard Model (mathematical\nformulation)]]. s, with gauge bosons in the fourth column.]]\n\n\nThe 'Standard Model' of particle physics is a theory concerning the\nelectromagnetic, weak, and strong nuclear interactions, which mediate the\ndynamics of the known subatomic particles. Developed throughout the mid to late\n20th century, the Standard Model is truly âa tapestry woven by many handsâ,\nsometimes driven forward by new experimental discoveries, sometimes by\ntheoretical advances. It was a collaborative effort in the largest sense,\nspanning continents and decades. Oerter, Robert (2006-09-26). The Theory of\nAlmost Everything: The Standard Model, the Unsung Triumph of Modern Physics (p.\n2). Penguin Group. Kindle Edition. The current formulation was finalized\nin the mid-1970s upon experimental confirmation of the existence of quarks.\nSince then, discoveries of the bottom quark (1977), the top quark (1995), and\nthe tau neutrino (2000) have given further credence to the Standard Model. More\nrecently, (2011â2012) the apparent detection of the Higgs boson completes the\nset of predicted particles. Because of its success in explaining a wide variety\nof experimental results, the Standard Model is sometimes regarded as a \"theory\nof almost everything\".\n\nThe Standard Model falls short of being a complete theory of fundamental\ninteractions because it does not incorporate the full theory of gravitation as\ndescribed by general relativity, or predict the accelerating expansion of the\nuniverse (as possibly described by dark energy). The theory does not contain any\nviable dark matter particle that possesses all of the required properties\ndeduced from observational cosmology. It also does not correctly account for\nneutrino oscillations (and their non-zero masses). Although the Standard Model\nis believed to be theoretically self-consistent, it has several apparently\nunnatural properties giving rise to puzzles like the strong CP problem and the\nhierarchy problem.\n\nNevertheless, the Standard Model is important to theoretical and experimental\nparticle physicists alike. For theorists, the Standard Model is a paradigm of a\nquantum field theory, which exhibits a wide range of physics including\nspontaneous symmetry breaking, anomalies, non-perturbative behavior, etc. It is\nused as a basis for building more exotic models that incorporate hypothetical\nparticles, extra dimensions, and elaborate symmetries (such as supersymmetry) in\nan attempt to explain experimental results at variance with the Standard Model,\nsuch as the existence of dark matter and neutrino oscillations. In turn,\nexperimenters have incorporated the Standard Model into simulators to help\nsearch for new physics beyond the Standard Model.\n","linknr":1010,"url":"Standard_Model","recorded":1362374875,"links":83,"instances":["publisher","publisher","mathematical_formulation","cosmology","physics","particle","quantum_mechanics","journal","physics","particle_physics","physics","physics","disambiguation","particle_physics","physics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Standard
