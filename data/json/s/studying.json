They\nare generally critical to success in school,<ref name=\"eric1\"></ref>\nconsidered essential for acquiring good grades, and useful for learning\nthroughout one's life.\n\nThere are an array of study skills, which may tackle the process of organizing\nand taking in new information, retaining information, or dealing with\nassessments. They include mnemonics, which aid the retention of lists of\ninformation, effective reading, and concentration techniques,<ref>Bremer, Rod.\nThe Manual - A guide to the Ultimate Study Method (USM). (Amazon Digital\nServices)</ref> as well as efficient notetaking.<ref>http://weblearn.ox.ac.uk/s-\nite/colleges/seh/freshinfo/vs/StudySkills2008b.pdf</ref>\n\nWhile often left up to the student and their support network, study skills are\nincreasingly taught in High School and at the University level. A number of\nbooks and websites are available, from works on specific techniques such as Tony\nBuzan's books on mind-mapping, to general guides to successful study such as\nthose by Stella Cottrell.\n\nMore broadly, any skill which boosts a person's ability to study and pass exams\ncan be termed a study skill, and this could include time management and\nmotivational techniques.\n\nStudy Skills are discrete techniques that can be learned, usually in a short\ntime, and applied to all or most fields of study. They must therefore be\ndistinguished from strategies that are specific to a particular field of study\ne.g. music or technology, and from abilities inherent in the student, such as\naspects of intelligence or learning styles.\n","title":"study%20skills","headings":["Historical context","Types","See also","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["2: Mind_map","1: Exam","1: Mnemonic","1: Notetaking","1: High_School","1: University","1: Tony_Buzan","1: Stella_Cottrell","1: Time_management","1: Learning_styles","1: John_Dewey","1: Critical_thinking","1: Mnemonics","1: Tree_structure","1: Spider_diagram","1: Learning_style","1: Method_of_loci","1: Flashcard","1: Compass","1: Motivation","1: Procrastination","1: Sleep","1: ABC_analysis","1: FlashNotes","1: Homework","1: Learning","1: Reading_day","1: Study_guide","1: Study_software","1: SQ3R","1: Super_Camp","1: Video_study_guide"]}
