A professor of biochemistry and microbiology at Rutgers University\nfor four decades, he discovered over twenty antibiotics (a word which he coined)\nand introduced procedures that have led to the development of many others. The\nproceeds earned from the licensing of his patents funded a foundation for\nmicrobiological research, which established the Waksman Institute of\nMicrobiology located on Rutgers University's Busch Campus in Piscataway, New\nJersey (USA). In 1952 he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine\nin recognition \"for his discovery of \"streptomycin,\" the first antibiotic active\nagainst tuberculosis.\" Waksman was later accused of fraud by one of his lab\nworkers Albert Schatz.\n\nIn 2005 Selman Waksman was designated an ACS National Historical Chemical\nLandmark in recognition of the significant work of his lab in isolating more\nthan fifteen antibiotics, including streptomycin, which was the first effective\ntreatment for tuberculosis.\n","linknr":408,"url":"Selman_Waksman","recorded":1362500872,"links":47,"instances":["rutgers_university","rutgers_university","scientist"],"pdf":[],"categories":["1888 births","1973 deaths","American autobiographers","American biochemists","American biologists","American inventors","American Nobel laureates","American people of Russian-Jewish descent","American people of Ukrainian-Jewish descent","American science writers","Imperial Russian emigrants to the United States","Imperial Russian Jews","Jewish American scientists","Jewish American writers","Jewish inventors","Leeuwenhoek Medal winners","National Inventors Hall of Fame inductees","Naturalized citizens of the United States","Nobel laureates in Physiology or Medicine","Phthisiatrists","Recipients of the Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research","Rutgers University alumni","Rutgers University faculty","Soil scientists","People from Barnstable County, Massachusetts","People from Lypovets Raion","University of California, Berkeley alumni","Ukrainian emigrants to the United States","Ukrainian Jews"],"headings":["Biography","Streptomycin","Neomycin","Nobel Prize","Publications","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/33/Selman_Waksman_NYWTS.jpg/220px-Selman_Waksman_NYWTS.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["albert_schatz","scientist"],["school_of_environmental_and_biological_sciences","rutgers_university"],["albert_schatz","scientist"],["busch_campus","rutgers_university"]],"members":["busch_campus","school_of_environmental_and_biological_sciences","albert_schatz"],"related":["Nova_Pryluka","Kiev","Ukraine","Russian_Empire","Woods_Hole,_Massachusetts","Barnstable_County,_Massachusetts","Massachusetts","United_States","Rutgers_University","University_of_California,_Berkeley","Woods_Hole,_Massachusetts","Barnstable_County,_Massachusetts","Massachusetts","United_States","Ashkenazi_Jewish","Biochemistry","Microbiology","Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_or_Medicine","Leeuwenhoek_Medal","Organic_substance","Organism","Soil","Decomposition","Streptomycin","Antibiotic","Professor","Rutgers_University","Antibiotic","Patent","Waksman_Institute_of_Microbiology","Busch_Campus","Piscataway,_New_Jersey","New_Jersey","Albert_Schatz_(scientist)","ACS_National_Historical_Chemical_Landmarks","Jewish","Nova_Pryluka","Podolia_Governorate","Russian_Empire","Vinnytsia_Oblast","Ukraine","Odessa","Naturalization","Rutgers_University","Bachelor_of_Science","Agriculture","Master_of_Science","J._G._Lipman","School_of_Environmental_and_Biological_Sciences_(Rutgers_University)","Soil_bacteriology","University_of_California,_Berkeley","Doctor_of_Philosophy","Rutgers_University","Actinomycin","Clavacin","Streptothricin","Streptomycin","Grisein","Neomycin","Fradicin","Candicidin","Candidin","Streptomycin","Neomycin","Streptomycin","Antibiotic","Tuberculosis","Antibiotics","Légion_d'honneur","Woods_Hole,_Massachusetts","Barnstable_County,_Massachusetts","Massachusetts","Hebrew","King_James_Version","Multiple_sclerosis","Streptomyces","Tuberculosis","Albert_Schatz_(scientist)","Actinomycetes","Nobel_Prize","Patent","Royalties","Waksman_Institute_of_Microbiology","Busch_Campus_(Rutgers_University)","Rutgers_University","Piscataway,_New_Jersey","Selman_A._Waksman_Award_in_Microbiology","United_States_National_Academy_of_Sciences","Author","Co-author","List_of_Jewish_Nobel_laureates","List_of_antibiotics","Scientific_American","Pryluky","Kiev","Ukraine","Woods_Hole,_Massachusetts","Barnstable_County,_Massachusetts","Massachusetts","United_States_of_America"]}
