{"cursor":"18809","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nA 'stone tool' is, in the most general sense, any tool made either partially or\nentirely out of stone. Although stone tool-dependent societies and cultures\nstill exist today, most stone tools are associated with prehistoric,\nparticularly Stone Age cultures that have become extinct. Archaeologists often\nstudy such prehistoric societies, and refer to the study of stone tools as\nlithic analysis. Stone has been used to make a wide variety of different tools\nthroughout history, including arrow heads, spearpoints and querns. Stone tools\nmay be made of either ground stone or chipped stone, and a person who creates\ntools out of the latter is known as a flintknapper.\n\nChipped stone tools are made from cryptocrystalline materials such as chert or\nflint, radiolarite, chalcedony, basalt, quartzite and obsidian via a process\nknown as lithic reduction. One simple form of reduction is to strike stone\nflakes from a nucleus (core) of material using a hammerstone or similar hard\nhammer fabricator. If the goal of the reduction strategy is to produce flakes,\nthe remnant lithic core may be discarded once it has become too small to use. In\nsome strategies, however, a flintknapper reduces the core to a rough unifacial\nor bifacial preform, which is further reduced using soft hammer flaking\ntechniques or by pressure flaking the edges. More complex forms of reduction\ninclude the production of highly standardized blades, which can then be\nfashioned into a variety of tools such as scrapers, knives, sickles and\nmicroliths. In general terms, chipped stone tools are nearly ubiquitous in all\npre-metal-using societies because they are easily manufactured, the tool stone\nis usually plentiful, and they are easy to transport and sharpen.\n","linknr":496,"url":"Stone_tool","recorded":1362552157,"links":42,"instances":["tool","amiens","stone","archaeology","archaeology","geology","archaeology","geology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Lithics|","Archaeological artefact types","Tools","Primitive technology"],"headings":["Evolutionary development of technocomplexes","Modern uses","Stone Tools","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fb/National_park_stone_tools.jpg/240px-National_park_stone_tools.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/Chopping_tool.gif/240px-Chopping_tool.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Hand_axe_spanish.gif/240px-Hand_axe_spanish.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6d/Nucl%C3%A9us_Levallois_La-Parrilla.png/240px-Nucl%C3%A9us_Levallois_La-Parrilla.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/N%C3%A9olithique_0001.jpg/240px-N%C3%A9olithique_0001.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/Stone_tools_Equador_5_types.png/200px-Stone_tools_Equador_5_types.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d7/HMB_Steinaxtmanufaktur_Vinelz_Jungsteinzeit_2700_BC.jpg/200px-HMB_Steinaxtmanufaktur_Vinelz_Jungsteinzeit_2700_BC.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["rock","geology"],["scraper","archaeology"],["saint-acheul","amiens"],["greenstone","archaeology"],["celt","tool"],["mano","stone"],["nodule","geology"],["greenstone","archaeology"],["eccentric_flint","archaeology"]],"members":["celt","mano","greenstone","scraper","nodule","eccentric_flint","rock"],"related":["Rock_(geology)","Prehistory","Stone_Age","Archaeology","Lithic_analysis","Arrow_heads","Querns","Ground_stone","Chipped_stone","Flintknapper","Cryptocrystal","Chert","Flint","Radiolarite","Chalcedony","Basalt","Quartzite","Obsidian","Lithic_reduction","Lithic_flake","Hammerstone","Lithic_core","Flintknapper","Uniface","Biface","Soft_hammer","Pressure_flaking","Scraper_(archaeology)","Knife","Sickle","Microliths","Tool_stone","Grahame_Clark","Palaeolithic","Chronological","Mode_1","Oldowan_Industry","Olduvai_Gorge","Tanzania","Lithic_core","Hammerstone","Conchoidal_fracture","Lower_Palaeolithic","Gona","Ethiopia","Hominan","Homo_erectus","Eurasia","Java","Acheulean_Industry","Saint-Acheul_(Amiens)","Biface","Hand_axe","Turkana_District","Kenya","Mousterian_Industry","Le_Moustier","Levallois_technique","Neanderthals","Lithic_blade","Upper_Palaeolithic","Upper_Palaeolithic","Aurignacian","Microlith","Magdalenian","Neolithic","Basalt","Greenstone_(archaeology)","Rhyolite","English_Lake_District","Langdale_axe_industry","Adze","Celt_(tool)","Axe","Mano_(stone)","Metate","Mechanical_strength","Neolithic","Nodule_(geology)","Grimes_Graves","Suffolk","Cissbury","Sussex","Spiennes","Mons","Belgium","Great_Britain","Downland","Langdale_axe_industry","Penmaenmawr","Tievebulliagh","Co_Antrim","Ulster","Outcrop","Greenstone_(archaeology)","Mechanical_strength","Flintlock","Brandon,_Suffolk","Glass_knife","Thin_section","Electron_microscopy","Microtomy","Glass","Obsidian","Chaîne_opératoire","Eccentric_flint_(archaeology)","Flint","Knapping","Langdale_axe_industry","Lithic_technology","Manuport","Prismatic_blade"]}
