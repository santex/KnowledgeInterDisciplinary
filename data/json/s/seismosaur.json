W. Williston. The generic name,\ncoined by Othniel Charles Marsh in 1878, is a Neo-Latin term derived from Greek\n(diplos) \"double\" and (dokos) \"beam\",<ref name=\"oed\"/><ref\nname=OnlineEtDict></ref> in reference to its double-beamed chevron bones located\nin the underside of the tail. These bones were initially believed to be unique\nto Diplodocus; however, they have since then been discovered in other members of\nthe diplodocid family and in non-diplodocid sauropods such as\n[[Mamenchisaurus]].\n\nIt lived in what is now western North America at the end of the Jurassic Period.\nDiplodocus is one of the more common dinosaur fossils found in the Upper\nMorrison Formation, a sequence of shallow marine and alluvial sediments\ndeposited about 155 to 148 million years ago, in what is now termed the\nKimmeridgian and Tithonian stages (Diplodocus itself ranged from about 154 to\n150 million years ago<ref name=turner1999>Turner, C.E. and Peterson, F., (1999).\n\"Biostratigraphy of dinosaurs in the Upper Jurassic Morrison Formation of the\nWestern Interior, U.S.A.\" Pp. 77–114 in Gillette, D.D.

The Morrison Formation records an environment and time dominated by\ngigantic sauropod dinosaurs such as [[Camarasaurus]], [[Barosaurus]],\n[[Apatosaurus]] and [[Brachiosaurus]].<ref name=turner2004></ref>\n\nDiplodocus is among the most easily identifiable dinosaurs, with its classic\ndinosaur shape, long neck and tail and four sturdy legs. For many years, it was\nthe longest dinosaur known. Its great size may have been a deterrent to the\npredators [[Allosaurus]] and [[Ceratosaurus]]: their remains have been found in\nthe same strata, which suggests they coexisted with Diplodocus.\n",
