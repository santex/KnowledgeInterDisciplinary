{"cursor":"22251","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":".]] The 'effects of high altitude on humans' are considerable. The percentage\nsaturation of hemoglobin with oxygen determines the content of oxygen in our\nblood. After the human body reaches around 2,100 m (7,000 feet) above sea level,\nthe saturation of oxyhemoglobin begins to plummet.\nHowever, the human body has both short-term and long-term adaptations to\naltitude that allow it to partially compensate for the lack of oxygen. Athletes\nuse these adaptations to help their performance. There is a limit to the level\nof adaptation; mountaineers refer to the altitudes above as the \"death zone\",\nwhere no human body can acclimatize.\n","linknr":562,"url":"Effects_of_high_altitude_on_humans","recorded":1362373608,"links":36,"instances":["unit","medical","unit","unit"],"pdf":["http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.175.3270&rep=rep1&type=pdf","http://www.usariem.army.mil/Pages/download/harshenvironmentsvol2.pdf","http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.175.3270&rep=rep1&type=pdf","http://www.cns.nyu.edu/events/spf/SPF_papers/fayed2006evidence.pdf","http://www.cns.nyu.edu/events/spf/SPF_papers/fayed2006evidence.pdf","http://zuniv.net/pub/Everest2.pdf"],"categories":["Mountaineering and health","Respiratory physiology"],"headings":["Effects as a function of altitude","Acclimatization to altitude","Altitude and athletic performance","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/M_Rainier.jpg/170px-M_Rainier.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4b/Everest_kalapatthar_crop.jpg/220px-Everest_kalapatthar_crop.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/K2_2006b.jpg/220px-K2_2006b.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["pascal","unit"],["bar","unit"],["atmosphere","unit"],["hypoxia","medical"]],"members":["bar","hypoxia","atmosphere","pascal"],"related":["Hemoglobin","Human_body","Oxyhemoglobin","Sea_level","Atmospheric_pressure","Pascal_(unit)","Bar_(unit)","Atmosphere_(unit)","Atmospheric_chemistry","Partial_pressure","Red_blood_cells","Everest_Base_Camp","Mount_Everest","Acute_mountain_sickness","High_altitude_pulmonary_edema","HAPE","High_altitude_cerebral_edema","HACE","Dexamethazone","Mountaineering","Altitude","Oxygen","Human","Edouard_Wyss-Dunant","Chronic_mountain_sickness","Andes","Himalaya","Chronic_mountain_sickness","Mortality_rate","Obesity","Suicide","Firearm","Mood_disturbance","Sleep_apnea","Carotid_bodies","Hyperventilation","Respiratory_alkalosis","Respiratory_center","Increase_in_heart_rate","Stroke_volume","Digestive_system","Acetazolamide","Lactic_acid","Blood_plasma","Hematocrit","Polycythemia","Red_blood_cell","Capillaries","Skeletal_muscle","Myoglobin","Mitochondria","Aerobic_respiration","2,3-Bisphosphoglycerate","Hypoxic_pulmonary_vasoconstriction","Right_ventricular_hypertrophy","IAAF","1996_Mount_Everest_disaster","2008_K2_disaster","Altitude_sickness","Altitude_tent","Armstrong's_limit","Aviation_medicine","Gamow_bag","Hypoxemia","Hypoxia_(medical)","Organisms_at_high_altitude"]}
