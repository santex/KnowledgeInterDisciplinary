{"cursor":"9854","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Title' is a legal term for a bundle of rights in a piece of property in which a\nparty may own either a legal interest or an equitable interest. In the\nUnited States, legal titles are those that were recognized by the law courts in\nEngland. Equitable titles were those recognized by the English chancery courts.\nBoth concepts were adopted by the various states upon their creation except,\npossibly, those based upon European Civil Law, such as Louisiana. Most, if not\nall of the states have merged the law and equity courts into a single court\nsystem, though there may still be law and chancery divisions in some of the\nsystems. The rights in the bundle may be separated and held by different\nparties. It may also refer to a formal document that serves as evidence of\nownership. Conveyance of the document may be required in order to transfer\nownership in the property to another person. Title is distinct from possession,\na right that often accompanies ownership but is not necessarily sufficient to\nprove it. In many cases, both possession and title may be transferred\nindependently of each other.\n","linknr":269,"url":"Title_(property)","recorded":1362570330,"links":25,"instances":["law","law","law","trust","law","legal_system","law"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Property law","Legal terms"],"headings":["Elements","Applications","Political issues","Aboriginal title","See also","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["possession","law"],["civil_law","legal_system"],["possession","law"],["use","law"],["partition","law"],["trust","law"],["beneficiary","trust"],["remainder","law"]],"members":["use","possession","remainder","beneficiary","trust","civil_law","partition"],"related":["Law","Bundle_of_rights","Possession_(law)","Equitable_interest","Civil_law_(legal_system)","Document","Ownership","Possession_(law)","Right","Use_(law)","Enclosure","Takeover","Conveyancing","Bequest","Easement","Hypothecation","Partition_(law)","Real_property","Water_rights","Riparian_water_rights","Runoff_right","Prior_appropriation_water_rights","Mineral_rights","Easement","Tenancy","Land_tenure","Timber_right","Farming_right","Grazing_rights","Hunting_right","Air_rights","Statute_of_limitations","Property","Trust_(law)","Trustees","Beneficiary_(trust)","Private_property","Real_estate","Motor_vehicle","Junk_title","Salvage_title","Real_estate","Deed","Title_search","Title_insurance_in_the_United_States","Fee_simple","Real_property","Quiet_title","Missing_heirs","Tenants","Reverter","Remainder_(law)","Lien","United_States","California","Personal_property","Good_faith","California","Asian_people","Real_property","Constitutionality","George_III_of_the_United_Kingdom","Native_Americans_in_the_United_States","Chain_of_title","Fee","Feu","Land_ownership_and_tenure","Land_tenure","Phase_I_Environmental_Site_Assessment","Manufacturer_statement_of_origin","Vehicle_title"]}
