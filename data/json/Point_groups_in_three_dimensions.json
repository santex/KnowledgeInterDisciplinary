{"cursor":"44110","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In geometry, a '[[point group]] in three dimensions' is an isometry group in\nthree dimensions that leaves the origin fixed, or correspondingly, an isometry\ngroup of a sphere. It is a subgroup of the orthogonal group O(3), the group of\nall isometries that leave the origin fixed, or correspondingly, the group of\northogonal matrices. O(3) itself is a subgroup of the Euclidean group E(3) of\nall isometries.\n\nSymmetry groups of objects are isometry groups. Accordingly, analysis of\nisometry groups is analysis of possible symmetries. All isometries of a\nbounded 3D object have one or more common fixed points. We choose the origin\nas one of them.\n\nThe symmetry group of an object is sometimes also called 'full symmetry group',\nas opposed to its 'rotation group' or 'proper symmetry group', the intersection\nof its full symmetry group and the rotation group SO(3) of the 3D space itself.\nThe rotation group of an object is equal to its full symmetry group if and only\nif the object is chiral.\n\nThe point groups in three dimensions are heavily used in chemistry, especially\nto describe the symmetries of a molecule and of molecular orbitals forming\ncovalent bonds, and in this context they are also called '[[List of character\ntables for chemically important 3D point groups|molecular point groups]]'.\n\nFinite Coxeter groups are a special set of point groups generated purely by a\nset of reflectional mirrors passing through the same point. A rank n Coxeter\ngroup has n mirrors and is represented by a Coxeter-Dynkin diagram. Coxeter\nnotation offers a bracketed notation equivalent to the Coxeter diagram, with\nmarkup symbols for rotational and other subsymmetry point groups.\n","linknr":341,"url":"Point_groups_in_three_dimensions","recorded":1362481109,"links":23,"instances":["geometry","topology","mathematics","geometry","mathematics","geometry","geometry","mathematics"],"pdf":["http://myweb.lmu.edu/bmellor/beadedbeads.pdf","http://myweb.lmu.edu/bmellor/beadedbeads.pdf","http://enriques.mathematik.uni-mainz.de/burban/singul.pdf","http://www.stanford.edu/~yishuwei/crystal.pdf"],"categories":["Euclidean
