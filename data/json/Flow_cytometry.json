It allows simultaneous multiparametric analysis of the physical\nand/or chemical characteristics of up to thousands of particles per second.\n\nFlow cytometry is routinely used in the diagnosis of health disorders,\nespecially blood cancers, but has many other applications in basic research,\nclinical practice and clinical trials. A common variation is to physically sort\nparticles based on their properties, so as to purify populations of interest.\n","linknr":473,"url":"Flow_cytometry","recorded":1362481351,"links":40,"instances":["electromagnetic_radiation","biology","electromagnetic_radiation","biology","element","physics","fluorescence_spectroscopy","physics","biology"],"pdf":["http://www.bdbiosciences.com/pdfs/brochures/23-3428-02.pdf","http://www.bdbiosciences.com/pdfs/brochures/23-3428-02.pdf"],"categories":["Blood
