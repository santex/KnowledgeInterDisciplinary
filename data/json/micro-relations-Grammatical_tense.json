{"cursor":"14462","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\nIn grammar, 'tense' is a category that locates a situation in time, to indicate\nwhen the situation takes place. Fabricius-Hansen, \"Tense\", in the\n[[Encyclopedia of Language and Linguistics]], 2nd ed., 2006 Bernard Comrie, Aspect, 1976:6: the semantic concept of time\nreference (absolute or relative), ... may be grammaticalised in a language, i.e.\na language may have a grammatical category that expresses time reference, in\nwhich case we say that the language has tenses. Some languages lack tense, i.e.\ndo not have grammatical time reference, though probably all languages can\nlexicalise time reference, i.e. have temporal adverbials that locate situations\nin time Tense is the grammaticalisation of time reference, often using\nthree basic categories of \"before now\", i.e. the past; \"now\", i.e. the present;\nand \"after now\", i.e. the future. The \"unmarked\" reference for tense is the\ntemporal distance from the time of utterance, the \"here-and-now\", this being absolute-\ntense. Relative-tense indicates temporal distance from a point of time\nestablished in the discourse that is not the present, i.e. reference to a point\nin the past or future, such as the future-in-future, or the future of the future\n(at some time in the future after the reference point, which is in the future)\nand future-in-past or future of the past (at some time after a point in the\npast, with the reference point being a point in the past).\n\nNot all languages grammaticalise tense, and those that do differ in their\ngrammaticalisation thereof. Languages without tense are called tenseless\nlanguages and include Burmese, Dyirbal and Chinese. Not all grammaticalise the\nthree-way system of pastâpresentâfuture. For example, some two-tense languages\nsuch as English and Japanese express past and non-past, this latter covering\nboth present and future in one verb form, whereas others such as Greenlandic\nhave future and non-future. Four-tense languages make finer distinctions either\nin the past (e.g. remote vs recent past), or the future (e.g. near vs remote\nfuture). The six-tense language Kalaw Lagaw Ya of Australia has the remote past,\nthe recent past, the today past, the present, the today/near future and the\nremote future. The differences between such finer distinctions are the distance\non the timeline between the temporal reference points from the present.\n","linknr":280,"url":"Grammatical_tense","recorded":1362892427,"links":59,"instances":["linguistics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Grammatical tenses|","English grammar"],"headings":["Etymology","Tense marking","Other uses of the term \"Tense\" : Tense, aspect, and mood","Tense in languages of the world","Grammaticalisation of tenses","See also","Notes","References","Bibliography","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["tutt","linguistics"]],"members":["tutt"],"related":["Grammar","Grammatical_category","Past_tense","Present_tense","Future_tense","TUTT_(linguistics)","Absolute_tense","Relative_tense","Tenseless_language","Burmese_language","Dyirbal_language","Chinese_language","Greenlandic_language","Kalaw_Lagaw_Ya","Latin","Chinese_language","Grammatical_mood","Linguistic_modality","Evidentiality","Grammatical_aspect","Grammatical_aspect","Grammatical_mood","Tense–aspect–mood","Latin","Aorist_tense","History_of_English_grammars","Past_tense","Non-past","Ablaut","Suffix","Indo-European_languages","Grammaticalisation","Nonpast_tense","Nonfuture_tense","Future_tense","Hodiernal_tense","Crastinal_tense","Posterior_tense","Nonfuture_tense","Present_tense","Nonpast_tense","Past_tense","Hodiernal_tense","Hesternal_tense","Anterior_tense","Sequence_of_tenses","Grammatical_conjugation","Grammatical_mood","Grammatical_aspect","Nominal_TAM","Tense–aspect–mood","Verb","Spatial_tense"]}
