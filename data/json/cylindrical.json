The solid enclosed by this surface and by\ntwo planes perpendicular to the axis is also called a cylinder. The surface area\nand the volume of a cylinder have been known since deep antiquity.\n\nIn differential geometry, a cylinder is defined more broadly as any ruled\nsurface spanned by a one-parameter family of parallel lines. A cylinder whose\ncross section is an ellipse, parabola, or hyperbola is called an 'elliptic\ncylinder', 'parabolic cylinder', or 'hyperbolic cylinder' respectively.\n\nThe open cylinder is topologically equivalent to both the open annulus and the\npunctured plane.\n","title":"Cylinder%20%28geometry%29","headings":["Common use","Volume","Surface Area","Cylindric section","Other types of cylinders","About an arbitrary axis","Projective geometry","See also","Related polyhedra","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["2: Surface_area","2: Volume","1: Greek_language","1: Surface","1: Line_segment","1: Differential_geometry","1: Ruled_surface","1: Ellipse","1: Parabola","1: Hyperbola","1: Homeomorphism","1: Punctured_plane","1: Radius","1: Riemann_sums","1: Formula","1: Semi-major_axis","1: Cylindroid","1: Quadric_surface","1: Cartesian_coordinates","1: Spherical_coordinate_system","1: Rotation_matrix","1: Projective_geometry","1: Degenerate_conic","1: Cylindrical_conic","1: Steinmetz_solid","1: Polyhedron","1: Regular_polygon","1: Infinity","1: Dual_polyhedron","1: Bicone","1: Bipyramid"]}
