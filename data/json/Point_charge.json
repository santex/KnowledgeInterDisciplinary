{"cursor":"10424","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nA 'point particle' ('ideal particle' H.C. Ohanian, J.T. Markert (2007), p.\n3 or 'point-like particle', often spelled 'pointlike particle') is an\nidealization of particles heavily used in physics. Its defining feature is that\nit lacks spatial extension: being zero-dimensional, it does not take up\nspace. F.E. Udwadia, R.E. Kalaba (2007), p. 1 A point particle is an\nappropriate representation of any object whose size, shape, and structure is\nirrelevant in a given context. For example, from far enough away, an object of\nany shape will look and behave as a point-like object.\n\nIn the theory of gravity, physicists often discuss a 'point mass', meaning a\npoint particle with a nonzero mass and no other properties or structure.\nLikewise, in electromagnetism, physicists discuss a 'point charge', a point\nparticle with a nonzero charge. R. Snieder (2001), pp. 196â198\n\nSometimes due to specific combinations of properties extended objects behave as\npoint-like even in their immediate vicinity. For example, spherical objects\ninteracting in 3-dimensional space whose interactions are described by the\ninverse square law behave in such a way as if all their matter were concentrated\nin their centers of mass. In Newtonian gravitation and classical\nelectromagnetism, for example, the respective fields outside of a spherical\nobject are identical to those of a point particle of equal charge/mass located\nat the center of the sphere. I. Newton, I.B Cohen, A. Whitmann (1999), p.\n956 (Proposition 75, Theorem 35) I. Newton, A.\nMotte, J. Machin (1729), p. 270â271\n\nIn quantum mechanics, the concept of a point particle is complicated by the\nHeisenberg uncertainty principle: Even an elementary particle, with no internal\nstructure, occupies a nonzero volume. For example, a 1s electron in a hydrogen\natom occupies a volume of ~10 -30 m 3. There is nevertheless\na distinction between elementary particles such as electrons or quarks, which\nhave no internal structure, versus composite particles such as protons, which do\nhave internal structure: A proton is made of three quarks. Elementary particles\nare sometimes called \"point particles\", but this is in a different sense than\ndiscussed above.
