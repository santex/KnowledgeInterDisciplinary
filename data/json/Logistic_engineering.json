{"cursor":"5462","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Logistics engineering' is a branch of systems engineering dedicated to the\nscientific organization of the purchase, transport, storage, distribution, and\nwarehousing of materials and finished goods.\n\nLogistics is generally a cost centre service activity, but provides value via\nimproved efficiency and customer satisfaction. It can quickly lose that value if\nthe customer becomes dissatisfied. The end customer can include another process\nor work center inside of the manufacturing facility, a warehouse where items are\nstocked or the final customer who will use the product.\n\nAnother much more popular derivative and a complete usage of the logistic term\nwhich has appeared in recent years is the supply chain. The supply chain also\nlooks at an efficient chaining of the supply / purchase and distribution sides\nof an organisation. While Logistics looks at single echelons with the immediate\nsupply and distribution linked up, supply chain looks at multiple\nechelons/stages, right from procurement of the raw materials to the final\ndistribution of finished goods up to the customer. It is based on the basic\npremise that the supply and distribution activities if integrated with the\nmanufacturing / logistic activities, can result in better profitability for the\norganisation. The local minimum of total cost of the manufacturing operation is\ngetting replaced by the global minima of total cost of the whole chain,\nresulting in better profitability for the chain members and hence lower costs\nfor the products.\n\nLogistics engineering as a discipline is also a very important aspect of systems\nengineering that includes reliability engineering. It is the science and process\nwhereby reliability, maintainability, and availability are designed into\nproducts or systems. It includes the supply and physical distribution\nconsiderations above as well as more fundamental engineering considerations. For\nexample, if we want to produce a system that is 95% reliable (or improve a\nsystem to achieve 95% reliability), a logistics engineer understands that total\nsystem reliability can be no greater than the least reliable subsystem or\ncomponent. Therefore our logistics engineer must consider the reliability of all\nsubcomponents or subsystems and modify system design accordingly. If a subsystem\nis only 50% reliable, one can concentrate on improving the reliability of that\nsubsystem, design in multiple subsystems in parallel (5 in this case would\nachieve approximately 97% reliability of that subsystem), purchase and store\nspare subsystems for rapid change out, establish repair capability that would\nget a failed subsystem back in operation in the required amount of time, and/or\nchoose any combination of those approaches to achieve the optimal cost vs.\nreliability solution. Then the engineer moves onto the next subsystem.\n\nLogistics engineers work with complex mathematical models that consider elements\nsuch as mean time between failures (MTBF), mean time to failure (MTTF), mean\ntime to repair (MTTR), failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA), statistical\ndistributions, queueing theory, and a host of other considerations. Obviously,\nlogistics engineering is a complex science that considers tradeoffs in\ncomponent/system design, repair capability, training, spares inventory, demand\nhistory, storage and distribution points, transportation methods, etc., to\nensure the \"thing\" is where it's needed, when it's needed, and operating the way\nit's needed all at an acceptable cost.\n","linknr":133,"url":"Logistic_engineering","recorded":1374768763,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Logistic_engineering&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Logistic_engineering&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Logistic_engineering&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Cleanup","/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style","/wiki/Template:Cleanup/doc","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Logistic_engineering&action=edit","/wiki/Systems_engineering","/wiki/Purchase","/wiki/Transport","/wiki/Distribution_(business)","/wiki/Warehousing","/wiki/Cost_centre_(business)","/wiki/Supply_chain","/wiki/Systems_engineering","/wiki/Reliability_engineering","/wiki/Mean_time_between_failures","/wiki/Mean_time_to_repair","/wiki/Failure_mode_and_effects_analysis","/wiki/Statistical_distribution","/wiki/Queueing_theory","/wiki/Spare_parts_management","/w/index.php?title=Logistic_engineering&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Performance_metric","/wiki/Performance_metric","/wiki/Service_level#.CE.B2_service_level_.28type_2.2C_also_known_as_.22fill_rate.22.29","/wiki/Availability","/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Defense","/wiki/Performance-based_logistics","/wiki/Weapon_system","/w/index.php?title=Logistic_engineering&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Distribution_(business)","/wiki/Statistical_distribution","/wiki/Document_automation","/wiki/Industrial_engineering","/wiki/Logistics","/wiki/Liquid_logistics","/wiki/Logistics_support_analysis","/wiki/Operations_research","/wiki/Supply_chain_management","/wiki/Transportation_management_system","/wiki/Warehouse_management_system","/wiki/Fleet_management_software","/w/index.php?title=Logistic_engineering&action=edit&section=3","http://www.logisticsengineers.org/","http://www.sole.org/","/wiki/International_Society_of_Logistics","http://www.3ceonline.com/landed-cost.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Logistic_engineering&oldid=548477668","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Supply_chain_management","/wiki/Category:Production_and_manufacturing","/wiki/Category:Management","/wiki/Category:Engineering_disciplines","/wiki/Category:Articles_lacking_sources_from_June_2008","/wiki/Category:All_articles_lacking_sources","/wiki/Category:Articles_needing_cleanup_from_December_2008","/wiki/Category:All_articles_needing_cleanup","/wiki/Category:Cleanup_tagged_articles_without_a_reason_field_from_December_2008","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_pages_needing_cleanup_from_December_2008","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Logistic+engineering&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Logistic+engineering","/wiki/Logistic_engineering","/wiki/Talk:Logistic_engineering","#","/wiki/Logistic_engineering","/w/index.php?title=Logistic_engineering&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Logistic_engineering&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Logistic_engineering","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Logistic_engineering","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Logistic_engineering&oldid=548477668","/w/index.php?title=Logistic_engineering&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4895244","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Logistic_engineer
