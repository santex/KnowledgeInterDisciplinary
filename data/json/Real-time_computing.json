{"cursor":"16515","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nIn computer science, 'real-time computing' ('RTC'), or 'reactive computing', is\nthe study of hardware and software systems that are subject to a \"real-time\nconstraint\"â e.g. operational deadlines from event to system response. Real-time\nprograms must guarantee response within strict time constraints. Ben-\nAri, M., \"Principles of Concurrent and Distributed Programming\", Prentice Hall,\n1990. ISBN 0-13-711821-X. Ch16, Page 164. Often real-time response times\nare understood to be in the order of milliseconds and sometimes microseconds. In\ncontrast, a non-real-time system is one that cannot guarantee a response time in\nany situation, even if a fast response is the usual result.\n\nThe use of this word should not be confused with the two other legitimate uses\nof 'real-time'. In the domain of simulations, the term means that the\nsimulation's clock runs as fast as a real clock would; and in the domain of data\ntransfer, media processing and enterprise systems, the term is used to mean\n'without perceivable delay'.\n\nReal-time software may use one or more of the following: synchronous programming\nlanguages, real-time operating systems, and real-time networks, each of which\nprovide essential frameworks on which to build a real-time software application.\n\nA real-time system may be one where its application can be considered (within\ncontext) to be mission critical. The anti-lock brakes on a car are a simple\nexample of a real-time computing system — the real-time constraint in this\nsystem is the time in which the brakes must be released to prevent the wheel\nfrom locking. Real-time computations can be said to have failed if they are not\ncompleted before their deadline, where their deadline is relative to an event. A\nreal-time deadline must be met, regardless of system load.\n","linknr":224,"url":"Real-time_computing","recorded":1362890647,"links":35,"instances":["computing","computing","computer_science"],"pdf":["http://media.wiley.com/product_data/excerpt/54/04700149/0470014954.pdf"],"categories":["Real-time computing|","Real-time technology|"],"headings":["History","Criteria for real-time computing","Real-time and high-performance","Design methods","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/Mergefrom.svg/50px-Mergefrom.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["load","computing"],["scheduling","computing"],["concurrency","computer_science"]],"members":["scheduling","load","concurrency"],"related":["Computer_science","Computer_hardware","Computer_software","Synchronous_programming_language","Real-time_operating_system","Mission_critical","Anti-lock_brakes","Load_(computing)","Simulation","Real-time_Simulation","Analog_computer","MOS_Technology_6502","Commodore_64","Apple_II","Motorola_68000","Macintosh","Atari_ST","Commodore_Amiga","Interrupt_latency","Programmable_Interrupt_Controller","Scheduling_(computing)","Real_time_Java","Motorola_68000","Automobile","Internal_combustion_engine","Artificial_pacemaker","Embedded_system","Atari_2600","Cinematronics","Computer_multitasking","Preemptive_multitasking","Earliest_deadline_first_scheduling","Context_switch","Adaptive_Partition_Scheduler","Airline","Digital_signal_processing","Sampling_rate","Data_buffer","Audio_signal_processing","Audio_analysis","Sound_synthesis","Queue_area","High-performance_computing","Supercomputer","Network_traffic","FTSE_100_Index","Computer_chess","Modular_Approach_to_Software_Construction_Operation_and_Test","Concurrency_(computer_science)","HOOD_method","AADL","Ravenscar_profile","Real_time_Java","Synchronous_programming_language","Ptolemy_Project","DSOS","Worst-case_execution_time"]}
