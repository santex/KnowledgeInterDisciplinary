Some species of bacteria secrete it to\nform biofilms. Cellulose is the most common organic compound on Earth. About 33%\nof all plant matter is cellulose (the cellulose content of cotton fiber is 90%,\nthat of wood is 40â50% and that of dried hemp is approximately\n45%). Cellulose. (2008).

Cellulose is mainly used to produce paperboard and paper; to a smaller\nextent it is converted into a wide variety of derivative products such as\ncellophane and rayon. Converting cellulose from energy crops into biofuels such\nas cellulosic ethanol is under investigation as an alternative fuel source.\n\nSome animals, particularly ruminants and termites, can digest cellulose with the\nhelp of symbiotic micro-organisms that live in their guts. Humans can digest\ncellulose to some extent, however it mainly acts as a\nhydrophilic bulking agent for feces and is often referred to as \"dietary fiber\".\n","linknr":743,"url":"Cellulose","recorded":1362512491,"links":94,"instances":["chemistry","material","biology","unit","chemistry"],"pdf":["http://www.ipst.gatech.edu/faculty/ragauskas_art/technical_reviews/Chemical%20Overview%20of%20Wood.pdf","http://www.biocore-europe.org/file/BIOCORE%20Multi-criteria%20evaluation%20of%20niche%20crops.pdf","http://www.arboranano.ca/pdfs/Chemistry%20and%20applications%20of%20nanocrystalline%20cellulose%20and%20its%20derivatives%20A%20nanotechnology%20perspective-2011.pdf","http://www.arboranano.ca/pdfs/Chemistry%20and%20applications%20of%20nanocrystalline%20cellulose%20and%20its%20derivatives%20A%20nanotechnology%20perspective-2011.pdf","http://jcs.biologists.org/content/s3-102/57/107.full.pdf"],"categories":["Cellulose|","Excipients","Papermaking","Polysaccharides","Chemical
