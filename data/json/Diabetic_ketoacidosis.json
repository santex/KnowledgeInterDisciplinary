It happens predominantly in\nthose with type 1 diabetes, but it can occur in those with type 2 diabetes under\ncertain circumstances. DKA results from a shortage of insulin; in response the\nbody switches to burning fatty acids and producing acidic ketone bodies that\ncause most of the symptoms and complications.\n\nDKA may be the first symptom of previously undiagnosed diabetes, but it may also\noccur in people known to have diabetes as a result of a variety of causes, such\nas intercurrent illness or poor compliance with insulin therapy. Vomiting,\ndehydration, deep gasping breathing, confusion and occasionally coma are typical\nsymptoms. DKA is diagnosed with blood and urine tests; it is distinguished from\nother, rarer forms of ketoacidosis by the presence of high blood sugar levels.\nTreatment involves intravenous fluids to correct dehydration, insulin to\nsuppress the production of ketone bodies, treatment for any underlying causes\nsuch as infections, and close observation to prevent and identify\ncomplications.\n\nDKA is a medical emergency, and without treatment it can lead to death. DKA was\nfirst described in 1886; until the introduction of insulin therapy in the 1920s\nit was almost universally fatal. It now carries a mortality\nof less than 1% with adequate and timely treatment.\n","linknr":849,"url":"Diabetic_ketoacidosis","recorded":1362482079,"links":38,"instances":["circulatory","biology","medicine"],"pdf":["http://www.annals.org/cgi/reprint/144/5/350.pdf","http://www.annals.org/cgi/reprint/144/5/350.pdf","https://www.bsped.org.uk/professional/guidelines/docs/DKAGuideline.pdf","https://www.bsped.org.uk/professional/guidelines/docs/DKAGuideline.pdf"],"categories":["Diabetes","Medical emergencies"],"headings":["Signs and symptoms","Cause","Mechanism","Diagnosis","Prevention","Management","Epidemiology","History","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f4/Infuuszakjes.jpg/150px-Infuuszakjes.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0a/Beta-Hydroxybutyric_acid-2D-skeletal.svg/220px-Beta-Hydroxybutyric_acid-2D-skeletal.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/94/Symbol_support_vote.svg/15px-Symbol_support_vote.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["shock","circulatory"],["saline","medicine"],["cell","biology"]],"members":["shock","cell","saline"],"related":["Diabetes_mellitus","Diabetes_mellitus_type_1","Diabetes_mellitus_type_2","Insulin","Fatty_acid","Ketone_bodies","Insulin_therapy","Vomiting","Dehydration","Kussmaul_breathing","Mental_confusion","Coma","Blood_test","Urinalysis","Ketoacidosis","Blood_sugar","Intravenous_fluid","Medical_emergency","Nausea","Polyuria","Abdominal_pain","Hyperglycemia","Kussmaul_respiration","Acute_abdomen","Acute_pancreatitis","Appendicitis","Gastrointestinal_perforation","Coffee_ground_vomiting","Esophagus","Level_of_consciousness","Physical_examination","Skin_turgor","Tachycardia","Hypotension","Respiratory_rate","Cerebral_edema","Pupillary_light_reflex","Pneumonia","Influenza","Gastroenteritis","Urinary_tract_infection","Pregnancy","Myocardial_infarction","Stroke","Cocaine","Eating_disorder","Obesity","Obesity","Family_history","Glucagon","Liver","Glycogen","Gluconeogenesis","Sodium","Potassium","Osmotic_diuresis","Fatty_acid","Adipose_tissue","Lipolysis","Acetoacetate","Beta-Hydroxybutyric_acid","Acid_dissociation_constant","Metabolic_acidosis","Buffer_solution","Bicarbonate_buffering_system","Hyperventilation","Carbon_dioxide","Respiratory_alkalosis","Kussmaul_respiration","Insulin_resistance","Virtuous_circle_and_vicious_circle","Potassium","Chloride","Phosphate","Magnesium","Calcium","Islets_of_Langerhans","Counterregulatory_hormone","Glucagon","Adrenaline","Cytokine","Inflammation","Infection","Coagulation","Intracranial_pressure","Hyperglycemia","Urinalysis","Arterial_blood_gas","Artery","Vein","Urea","Creatinine","Renal_function","Complete_blood_count","C-reactive_protein","Acute_pancreatitis","Amylase","Lipase","Chest_X-ray","Computed_tomography","Stroke","Nonketotic_hyperosmolar_coma","Plasma_osmolarity","Ketoacidosis","Alcoholic_beverage","Starvation","Metabolic_acidosis","Poison","Ethylene_glycol","Paraldehyde","American_Diabetes_Association","Intensive_care_unit","Shock_(circulatory)","Blood_pressure","Saline_(medicine)","Cardiogenic_shock","Central_venous_pressure","Central_venous_catheter","Inotrope","Cell_(biology)","Hypokalemia","Cardiac_arrhythmia","Sodium_bicarbonate","Artificial_ventilation","Mannitol","Glutamic_acid_decarboxylase","Islets_of_Langerhans","Julius_Dreschfeld","Manchester","Royal_College_of_Physicians","Adolph_Kussmaul","University_of_Tennessee_Health_Science_Center","Emory_University_School_of_Medicine","George_Alberti","Maturity_onset_diabetes_of_the_young"]}
