Polls about public opinion, such as\npolitical beliefs, are reported in the news media in democracies. Other types of\nsurvey are used for scientific purposes. Surveys provide important information\nfor all kinds of research fields, e.g., marketing research, psychology, health\nprofessionals and sociology. http://whatisasurvey.info/ A survey may\nfocus on different topics such as preferences (e.g., for a presidential\ncandidate), behavior (smoking and drinking behavior), or factual information\n(e.g., income), depending on its purpose. Since survey research is always based\non a sample of the population, the success of the research is dependent on the\nrepresentativeness of the population of concern (see also sampling (statistics)\nand survey sampling).\n\nSurvey methodology seeks to identify principles about the design, collection,\nprocessing, and analysis of surveys in connection to the cost and quality of\nsurvey estimates. It focuses on improving quality within cost constraints, or\nalternatively, reducing costs for a fixed level of quality. Survey methodology\nis both a scientific field and a profession. Part of the task of a survey\nmethodologist is making a large set of decisions about thousands of individual\nfeatures of a survey in order to improve it. {{cite book\n|last1=Groves|first1=R.M. |last2=Fowler|first2=F.
