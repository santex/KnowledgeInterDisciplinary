Metabolic Engineering specifically seeks to\nmathematically model these networks, calculate a yield of useful products, and\npin point parts of the network that constrain the production of these\nproducts. Yang, Y.T., Bennet, G. N., San, K.Y., (1998) Genetic and Metabolic\nEngineering, Electronic Journal of Biotechnology, ISSN 07117-3458 Genetic\nengineering techniques can then be used to modify the network in order to\nrelieve these constraints. Once again this modified network can be modeled to\ncalculate the new product yield.\n\nThe ultimate goal of metabolic engineering is to be able to use these organisms\nto produce valuable substances on an industrial scale in a cost effective\nmanner. Current examples include producing beer, wine, cheese, pharmaceuticals,\nand other biotechnology products.\n\nSince cells use these metabolic networks for their survival, changes can have\ndrastic effects on the cells' ability to survive. Therefore, trade-offs in\nmetabolic engineering arise between the cells ability to produce the desired\nsubstance and its natural survival needs. Therefore, instead of directly\ndeleting and/or overexpressing the genes that encode for metabolic enzymes, the\ncurrent focus is to target the regulatory networks in a cell to efficiently\nengineer the metabolism.
