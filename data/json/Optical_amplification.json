{"cursor":"23105","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"An 'optical amplifier' is a device that amplifies an optical signal directly,\nwithout the need to first convert it to an electrical signal. An optical\namplifier may be thought of as a laser without an optical cavity, or one in\nwhich feedback from the cavity is suppressed. Optical amplifiers are important\nin optical communication and laser physics.\n\nThere are several different physical mechanisms that can be used to amplify a\nlight signal, which correspond to the major types of optical amplifiers. In\ndoped fiber amplifiers and bulk lasers, stimulated emission in the amplifier's\ngain medium causes amplification of incoming light. In semiconductor optical\namplifiers (SOAs), electron-hole recombination occurs. In Raman amplifiers,\nRaman scattering of incoming light with phonons in the lattice of the gain\nmedium produces photons coherent with the incoming photons. Parametric\namplifiers use parametric amplification.\n","linknr":300,"url":"Optical_amplification","recorded":1362897430,"links":29,"instances":["information_theory","physics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Optical devices","Amplifiers","Laser science","Fiber optics|Amplifier, optical","Fiber-optic communications"],"headings":["Laser amplifiers","Semiconductor optical amplifier","Raman amplifier","Optical parametric amplifier","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6d/Doped_fibre_amplifier.svg/300px-Doped_fibre_amplifier.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["signal","information_theory"],["homogeneity","physics"]],"members":["signal","homogeneity"],"related":["Optical","Signal_(information_theory)","Laser","Optical_cavity","Feedback","Optical_communication","Laser_physics","Stimulated_emission","Gain_medium","Electron","Electron_hole","Carrier_generation_and_recombination","Raman_amplifier","Raman_scattering","Phonon","Photon","Parametric_amplifier","Active_gain_medium","Laser_pumping","Gain","Regenerative_amplifier","Chirped-pulse_amplification","Ultrashort_pulse","Dopant","Optical_fiber","Fiber_laser","Multiplexing","Ions","Erbium","Nanometre","Waveguide","Phonon","Homogeneity_(physics)","Phonon","Stark_effect","Wavelength-division_multiplexing","Amplified_Spontaneous_Emission","Noise_figure","Numerical_aperture","Population_inversion","FWHM","Birefringence","Polarization_mode_dispersion","David_N._Payne","University_of_Southampton","Thulium","S-band","Praseodymium","Ytterbium","Fabry–Pérot","Laser_diodes","Waveguide","GaAs","Indium_phosphide","InGaAs","Indium_phosphide","Indium_phosphide","Nonlinear_optics","Four_wave_mixing","VCSEL","Free_spectral_range","Resonant_cavity","Microelectromechanical_systems","Raman_amplification","Signal_regeneration","Optical_parametric_amplifier","Centrosymmetry","Beta_barium_borate","Solid-state_laser","Collinear","Regenerative_amplification"]}
