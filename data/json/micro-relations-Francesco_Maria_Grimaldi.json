He was born in Bologna to Paride Grimaldi and Anna Cattani.\n\nBetween 1640 and 1650, working with Riccioli, he investigated the free fall of\nobjects, confirming that the distance of fall was proportional to the square of\nthe time taken. Grimaldi and Riccioli also made a calculation of the\ngravitational constant by recording the oscillations of an accurate\npendulum. J.L. Heilbron, Electricity in the 17th and 18th Centuries: A Study\nof Early Modern Physics (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1979),\n180.\n\nIn astronomy, he built and used instruments to measure lunar mountains as well\nas the height of clouds, and drew an accurate map or, selenograph, which was\npublished by Riccioli and now adorns the entrance to the National Air and Space\nMuseum in Washington D.C.\n\nHe was the first to make accurate observations on the diffraction of\nlight Francesco Maria Grimaldi,\n[http://books.google.com/books?id=FzYVAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA1#v=onepage&q&f=false\nPhysico mathesis de lumine, coloribus, et iride, aliisque annexis libri duo]\n(Bologna (\"Bonomia\"), Italy: Vittorio Bonati, 1665), pp. 1â11 (in\nLatin). (although by some accounts Leonardo da Vinci had\nearlier noted it Guglielmo Libri,\n[http://www.mmi.unimaas.nl/people/Veltman/books/contin/title.html Histoire des\nsciences mathematiques en Italie] (1840) ), and coined the word\n'diffraction'. Through experimentation he was able to demonstrate that the\nobserved passage of light could not be reconciled with the idea that it moved in\na rectilinear path. Rather, the light that passed through the hole took on the\nshape of a cone. Later physicists used his work as evidence that light was a\nwave, and Isaac Newton used it to arrive at his more comprehensive theory of\nlight. He also discovered what are known as diffraction bands.\n\nThe crater Grimaldi on the Moon is named after him.\n","linknr":168,"url":"Francesco_Maria_Grimaldi","recorded":1362579970,"links":34,"instances":["crater"],"pdf":[],"categories":["1618 births","1663 deaths","Italian Jesuits","17th-century Italian mathematicians","Italian physicists","Italian Roman Catholics","Selenographers","Roman Catholic cleric–scientists"],"headings":["Publications","References","External links","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/Francesco_Maria_Grimaldi.jpg/220px-Francesco_Maria_Grimaldi.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Wikiquote-logo-en.svg/40px-Wikiquote-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["grimaldi","crater"]],"members":["grimaldi"],"related":["Bologna","Bologna","Italy","Mathematics","Physics","Free_fall","Diffraction","Italians","Jesuit","Mathematician","Physicist","Jesuit","Bologna","Bologna","Giovanni_Riccioli","Free_fall","Astronomy","Diffraction","Light","Leonardo_da_Vinci","Guglielmo_Libri","Isaac_Newton","Grimaldi_(crater)","Moon","List_of_Jesuit_scientists","List_of_Roman_Catholic_scientist-clerics","Bologna","Bologna"]}
