The\nAct consolidated previous electoral law, but also made some changes to\nadministration.\n\nThe principal change was to provide for the conduct of future reviews of\nParliamentary boundaries by the permanent Parliamentary Boundary Commissions.\nThe Act also abolished the terms 'Parliamentary Borough' and 'Parliamentary\nCounty', renaming them 'Borough constituency' and 'County constituency',\nabolished the university constituencies, and removed a requirement that the City\nof London form its own constituency. The Boundary Commissions were instructed to\nreview all boundaries within 3-7 years from the Act coming into force, and\nthereafter to review the boundaries periodically.\n\nIn addition the Act made some changes to the franchise, removing the remaining\nprovisions allowing plural voting by people who owned business premises. From\nthis point forward, there was a single electoral register for both local\ngovernment and Parliamentary elections and each voter was only allowed to vote\nonce in any general election even if they happened to be registered in more than\none address for local elections.\n","linknr":171,"url":"Representation_of_the_People_Act_1949","recorded":1375055838,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Representation_of_the_People_Act_1949&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Representation_of_the_People_Act_1949&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a9/Coat_of_Arms_of_the_United_Kingdom_%281837-1952%29.svg/140px-Coat_of_Arms_of_the_United_Kingdom_%281837-1952%29.svg.png","/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Citation_of_United_Kingdom_legislation","/wiki/Royal_Assent","/wiki/House_of_Commons_(Redistribution_of_Seats)_Act_1949","/wiki/Representation_of_the_People_Act_1983","/wiki/Act_of_Parliament","/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Boundary_Commissions_(United_Kingdom)","/wiki/University_constituency","/wiki/City_of_London_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Plural_voting","/wiki/Electoral_register","/w/index.php?title=Representation_of_the_People_Act_1949&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Template:UK_legislation","/wiki/Template_talk:UK_legislation","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:UK_legislation&action=edit","/wiki/United_Kingdom_legislation","/wiki/List_of_English_statutes","/wiki/Act_of_Parliament","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_England_to_1483","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_England,_1485%E2%80%931601","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_England,_1603%E2%80%931641","/wiki/List_of_Ordinances_and_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_England,_1642%E2%80%931660","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_England,_1660%E2%80%931699","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_England,_1700%E2%80%931706","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_Scotland_to_1707","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_Ireland_to_1700","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_Ireland,_1701%E2%80%931800","/wiki/Kingdom_of_Great_Britain","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_Great_Britain,_1707%E2%80%931719","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_Great_Britain,_1720%E2%80%931739","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_Great_Britain,_1740%E2%80%931759","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_Great_Britain,_1760%E2%80%931779","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_Great_Britain,_1780%E2%80%931800","/wiki/United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland","/wiki/United_Kingdom","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom,_1801%E2%80%931819","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom,_1820%E2%80%931839","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom,_1840%E2%80%931859","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom,_1860%E2%80%931879","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom,_1880%E2%80%931899","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom,_1900%E2%80%931919","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom,_1920%E2%80%931939","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom,_1940%E2%80%931959","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom,_1960%E2%80%931979","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom,_1980%E2%80%931999","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom,_2000%E2%80%93present","/wiki/Church_of_England","/wiki/List_of_Church_of_England_Measures","/wiki/Church_of_England_Assembly_(Powers)_Act_1919","/wiki/Devolution","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Scottish_Parliament_from_1999","/wiki/List_of_Acts_and_Measures_of_the_National_Assembly_for_Wales","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Northern_Ireland_Assembly","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_Northern_Ireland","/wiki/List_of_Orders_in_Council_for_Northern_Ireland","/wiki/Delegated_legislation_in_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Statutory_Instrument_(UK)","/wiki/Scottish_Statutory_Instrument","/wiki/Act_of_Sederunt","/wiki/Template:UK_electoral_reform","/wiki/Template_talk:UK_electoral_reform","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:UK_electoral_reform&action=edit","/wiki/Reform_Act_1832","/wiki/Scottish_Reform_Act_1832","/wiki/Irish_Reform_Act_1832","/wiki/Reform_Act_1867","/wiki/Representation_of_the_People_(Scotland)_Act_1868","/wiki/Representation_of_the_People_(Ireland)_Act_1868","/wiki/Police_burgh","/wiki/Municipal_Corporations_Act_18
