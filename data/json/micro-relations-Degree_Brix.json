One\ndegree Brix is 1 gram of sucrose in 100 grams of solution and represents the\nstrength of the solution as percentage by weight (% w/w). If the solution\ncontains dissolved solids other than pure sucrose, then the Â°Bx only\napproximates the dissolved solid content. The Â°Bx is traditionally used in the\nwine, sugar, fruit juice, and honey industries.\n\nComparable scales for indicating sucrose content are the degree Plato (Â°P),\nwhich is widely used by the brewing industry, and the degree Balling, which is\nthe oldest of the three systems and therefore mostly found in older textbooks,\nbut also still in use in some parts of the world.

Because\nthe differences between the systems are of little practical significance (the\ndifferences are less than the precision of the instruments) and wide historical\nuse of the Brix unit, modern instruments calculate mass fraction using ICUMSA\nofficial formulas but report the result as Â°Bx.\n","linknr":255,"url":"Degree_Brix","recorded":1362565400,"links":33,"instances":["waves","beer","chemistry"],"pdf":["http://vitalsensorstech.com/PDF%27s/VS-1000B%20Brix%20Sensor%20Data%20Sheet.pdf","http://vitalsensorstech.com/PDF%27s/VS-1000B%20Brix%20Sensor%20Data%20Sheet.pdf"],"categories":["Food science","Oenology","Units of density"],"headings":["Background","Measurement","Tables","Usage","Brix and Actual Dissolved Solids Content","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["mass_fraction","chemistry"],["polarization","waves"],["gravity","beer"]],"members":["polarization","gravity","mass_fraction"],"related":["Sugar","Sucrose","Weight_percent","Wine","Sugar","Fruit_juice","Honey","Plato_scale","Brewing_industry","Relative_density","International_Commission_for_Uniform_Methods_of_Sugar_Analysis","Mass_fraction_(chemistry)","Adolf_Ferdinand_Wenceslaus_Brix","Wort","Vintner","Must","Hops","Acid","Tannins","Hydrometer","Pycnometer","Oscillating_U-tube","American_Society_of_Brewing_Chemists","Refractive_index","Polarization_(waves)","Refractometer","Infrared","Specific_gravity","Plato_scale","Wine_making","Carbonated_beverage","Starch","Sugar","Brewing","South_Africa","Fruits","Vegetables","Wine","Gravity_(beer)","Plato_scale","Baumé_scale","Charge-coupled_device","Refractometer","Must","Baumé_scale","Oechsle_scale","Polarimetry","Sweetness_of_wine"]}
