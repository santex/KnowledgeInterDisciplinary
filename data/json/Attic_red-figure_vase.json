Paris: Louvre]] 'Red-\nfigure vase painting' is one of the most important styles of figural Greek vase\npainting. It developed in Athens around 520 B.C. and remained in use until the\nlate 3rd century B.C. It replaced the previously dominant style of black-figure\nvase painting within a few decades. Its modern name is based on the figural\ndepictions in red colour on a black background, in contrast to the preceding black-\nfigure style with black figures on a red background. The most important areas of\nproduction, apart from Attica, were in Southern Italy. The style was also\nadopted in other parts of Greece. Etruria became an important centre of\nproduction outside the Greek World.\n\nAttic red-figure vases were exported throughout Greece and beyond. For a long\ntime, they dominated the market for fine ceramics. Only few centres of pottery\nproduction could compete with Athens in terms of innovativeness, quality and\nproduction capacity. Of the red figure vases produced in Athens alone, more than\n40,000 specimens and fragments survive today. From the second most important\nproduction centre, Southern Italy, more than 20,000 vases and fragments are\npreserved. Starting with the studies by John D. Beazley and Arthur Dale\nTrendall, the study of this style of art has made enormous progress. Some vases\ncan be ascribed to individual artists or schools. The images provide evidence\nfor the exploration of Greek cultural history, everyday life, iconography, and\nmythology.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Attic_red-figure_vase","recorded":1372152505,"links":[],"instances":["art_historian","diplomat","munich_2301","painter","vase_painter","vase_painter","painter","ceramics","vase_painter","botany","vase_painter","archaeology","vase_painter","greek_vase_painting","potter"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Archaic
