{"cursor":"13743","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Mel Chin' (born 1951 in Houston, Texas, USA) is a conceptual visual artist.\nMotivated largely by political, cultural, and social circumstances, Chin works\nin a variety of art media to calculate meaning in modern life. Chin places art\nin landscapes, in public spaces, and in gallery and museum exhibitions, but his\nwork is not limited to specific venues. Chin once stated: âMaking objects and\nmarks is also about making possibilities, making choicesâand that is one of the\nlast freedoms we have. To provide that is one of the functions of art.â Ned Rifkin. Directions: Mel Chin, February 1- April 23, 1989. Hishorn\nMuseum and Sculpture Garden Brochure, 1989.\n\n\nIn 1975, Chin graduated from Peabody College in Nashville, Tennessee. Shortly\nafter, in 1976, Chin created See/Saw: The Earthworks for Hermann Park in\nHouston, Texas, where the artist manipulated two sections of the parkâs surface\nto create a kinetic, minimalist earthwork. In this mimic of a childhood pastime,\nChin altered the landscape with an underground hydraulic device that allowed the\nparticipant to shift large sections of earth with their body weight. The title\nalso questions psychological perception of what is above and below an objects\nsurface. This piece addressed three of the major art trends of the time:\nminimalism, conceptualism, and earthworks.\n\n, 1978]] In 1983, Chin moved to New York City. He created MYRRHA P.I.A. (Post\nIndustrial Age) (1984), site specific to Bryant Park. Commissioned by\nthe Public Art Fund, the work was based on a Gustave DorÃ© engraving depicting\nMyrrha in the 30th canto of Hell from Danteâs Inferno. Chin created a three-\ndimensional figurative sculpture employing 19th century fabrication techniques,\nconjoined with space-age materials.\n\nIn 1989, Chin had a one-person exhibition at the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington,\nD.C. In The Operation of the Sun through the Cult of the Hand (1987), Chin\naddressed ancient Greek philosophy and Chinese philosophy. He investigated\nmythological constructions, and scientific information to contradict personal\ninterpretations in the formulations of these works. Chin used nine planets of\nthe solar system to launch this elaborate construction. The installation\ncomments on the origins of word material and form from East and West by drawing\nupon mythology, alchemy, and science in each culture.\n\nAlso in this exhibition were three major pieces with political content; The\nExtraction of Plenty from What Remains: 1823- (1989) is composed of two\nreplicated White House columns that squeeze a cornucopia hand-crafted of\nmahogany, banana, mud, coffee, and goatsâ blood. In this artwork Chin reacted to\nthe long history of American foreign policy that has fractured the ability of\nLatin American countries to prosper on their own. The date in the title 1823-\n(ongoing) is in reference to the Monroe Doctrine. The Sigh of the True Cross\n(1988) is based on a single string Ethiopian masinqo, or spike fiddle. Chin\ncompounds the iconography of the musical instrument and the hammer and sickle to\ncomment on famine, drought, failed politics, and foreign aid in the history of\nEthiopia. The Opera of Silence (1988) is also complex and layered with meaning.\nAn oversized Beijing opera drum rests on a staff made of human thigh bone, and\nthe drum skins are woven into the emblem of the C.I.A. commenting on the\ninterrelations of China, Tibet, and the C.I.A..\n\nChin conceptually developed the GALA Committee for the project called In the\nName of the Place. In the Name of the Place covertly inserted art objects on the\nset of the prime-time television series [[Melrose Place]]. Chin claimed, âI\nrealized that somewhere in those industries was where I wanted to develop this\nconceptual public art project. At the same time I was thinking of the virus as a\nparadigm for this art project. Viruses are self-replicating, but they mutate,\nand to me, thatâs like an art idea. I was wondering, how do you get an idea into\na system, and let it replicate within that system? Using the virus as a model,\nhow could I interact with television?â Tom\nFinkelpearl.Interview: Mel Chin on Revival Field, in Dialogues in Public Art,\nCambridge: The MIT Press, 2000. âSyndicated television as a host can serve\nas a place for the generational transfer of an idea.â Interview with artist, 2006. The idea to make an\nimpression upon prime time television workedâand the project successfully placed\nfine art into popular culture. Sotheby's in Los Angeles auctioned the objects\nwith proceeds going to two educational charities.\n\n\nIn 1992, Chin created Degrees of Paradise to be shown at the Storefront for Art\nand Architecture in New York City. Chin commissioned Kurdish weavers to create a\n9 foot by 23 foot carpet with patterns based on satellite telemetry. This was\ninstalled in the ceiling of one triangular room. In a second similar-shaped\nroom, overhead monitors projected active 3-D mathematically-derived cloud\npatterns. The hand woven Turkish carpet juxtaposed with video monitors continued\nChinâs commentary of new and old digital traditions by paying homage to both.\nThis project was a precursor to The State of Heaven (not realized). Chin\nenvisioned a massive carpet 66 feet by 66 feet that would represent the entire\natmospheric envelope with each knot equating . The carpet was to be destroyed\nand rewoven in a constant process according to the depletion or accretion of the\nozone hole. This was an attempt to make visible a phenomenon that we normally\ncannot see.\n\nAfter a series of successful gallery and museum exhibits, Chin abandoned object\nmaking to pursue an activist, ecological artwork. He began Revival Field in\n1990. As a conceptual and scientifically grounded work Revival Field was\ndeveloped with the intention of green remediation and ecological consciousness.\nIn this landscape art project, Chin, with scientist, Dr Rufus Chaney, used\nplants called hyperaccumulators that are known for their ability to draw heavy\nmetals from soil. Chinâs project was located in the Pigâs Eye Landfill in St.\nPaul, Minnesota for three years. The project was not about the formal\nconfiguration but the conceptual realization of scientific process brought forth\nthrough art. Other Revival Field sites have been located in Palmerton,\nPennsylvania and Stuttgart, Germany. This project materialized science,\ntechnology and art, while not adhering to the traditional object making of art.\n\nChin was featured on the PBS series Art21 (Art in the Twenty First Century)\nwhere his pieces S.P.A.W.N. and KNOWMAD and Revival Field were highlighted. In\nS.P.A.W.N. Chin planned to reclaim abandoned buildings in the city of Detroit,\nMichigan. He looked at neglected homes that once thrived as a starting point for\ncommunity development. KNOWMAD explored persecuted cultures and used traditional\ntribal woven rugs in an interactive computer video game. He developed this\nproject collaboratively with computer software engineers, with the hope of\nshedding light upon forgotten cultures and forgotten people.\n\nIn 2004, Mel Chin was invited as a visiting artist at East Tennessee State\nUniversity. While there, he completed the W.M.D. (\"Warehouse of Mass\nDistribution\"), which was driven to Houston, Texas in May, 2005, to participate\nin the Houston Art Car Parade.\n\n\nThe Station Museum of Contemporary Art held a major exhibition in Houston,\nTexas (2006) entitled Do Not Ask Me. Prevailing themes that run through the\nwork selected in this exhibition include war, social injustice, modern media,\nand individuality. Solo exhibitions of Chinâs art have appeared the Walker\nArt Center, Minneapolis, MN, The Menil Collection, Houston, TX, Storefront\nfor Art and Architecture, New York, and The Fabric Workshop and Museum,\nPhiladelphia, PA.\n\nIn 2006 the Frederieke Taylor Gallery in New York City featured a selection of\npieces from the \"Do Not Ask Me\" exhibit, originally shown at the Station Museum,\nas well as new drawings. Chin exhibited \"KNOWMAD\" as well as \"Render\" at\nFrederieke Taylor Gallery in 2000 and 2003.\n\n9/11-9/11 (2006) is Chinâs first animated film. Based on a graphic novella of\n  the same name, which he wrote in 2002, it is a fictional love story set in\n  Santiago, Chile, 1973 and New York City, 2001. Chinâs film deals with the\n  human impact of trauma and tragedy brought forth not by fate but by covert\n  political machinations. Chin is the creator/director working with a 2-D,\n  Chilean animation team.\n\nChin is compelled to make art in spite of his dark world view which is in\nkeeping with his philosophy of âtaking action as resistance to insignificance.\"\n\n\nMel Chin is the recipient of multiple awards including the US National Endowment\nfor the Arts, New York State Council for the Arts, Art Matters, Creative\nCapital, and the Penny McCall, Pollock/Krasner, Joan Mitchell, Rockefeller and\nLouis Comfort Tiffany Foundations and Nancy Graves Foundation Award. In 2010 he\nwon a Fellow award granted by United States Artist.  United States Artists\nOfficial Website\n[http://www.unitedstatesartists.org/Public2/Home/index.cfm]\n\nMel Chin has also exhibited in numerous group shows including the Fifth\nBiennial of Havana, Cuba; Seventh Architectural Biennial in Venice, Italy;\nKwangju Biennale, Korea; Hirshhorn Museum, Washington D.C.; Museum of\nContemporary Art, Los Angeles; the Whitney Museum of American Art; P.S.1\nContemporary Art Center; Museum of Modern Art; and the Asian American Arts\nCentre, New York City among others.\n\nIn 2006 Mel Chin visited New Orleans after hurricane Katrina to evaluate with\nfellow artists creative solutions to cure the aftermath of destruction as result\nof the storm. Chin began Operation Paydirt to find a solution for the high lead\ncontimination in the soil of New Orleans, a problem that existed before Katrina.\nTo assist the funding of Operation Paydirt, the Fundred Dollar Bill Project was\nimplemented in schools across the United States to symbolically raise\n300,000,000 dollars to propose to Congress for an exchange of real dollars in\nthe Summer of 2010.\n\nIn 2010 Chin received the biennial Fritschy Culture Award from the museum Het\nDomein, Sittard the Netherlands. \"The jury praises the unique way in which Chin,\nin many of his projects, creates a form of art in which participation and other\nforms of engagement are key. In awarding the Fritschy Culture Award 2010 to Mel\nChin, the jury members emphasize the critical engaged nature of this prize and\nthe expression of contemporary global issues.\" Museum Het Domein, Sittard,\nOfficial Website [http://www.hetdomein.nl/index.php?t=content&p=447]  As\npart of the Frtitschy Culture Award, Mel Chin exhibited a solo show at the\nmuseum Het Domein, titled \"Disputed Territories\".\n\nChin has been included in the Asian American Arts Centre's art Asia America\ndigital archive.\n","linknr":217,"url":"Mel_Chin","recorded":1375066079,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Mel_Chin&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Mel_Chin&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Houston,_Texas","/wiki/Conceptual_art","#cite_note-art-1","/wiki/File:Seesaw.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/5a/Seesaw.jpg/300px-Seesaw.jpg","/wiki/File:Seesaw.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Peabody_College","/wiki/Nashville,_Tennessee","/wiki/Hermann_Park","/wiki/Houston,_Texas","/wiki/Earthworks_(art)","/wiki/Minimalism","/wiki/Conceptualism","/wiki/Earthworks_(art)","/wiki/File:%27The_Manila_Palm%27,_sculpture_by_Mel_Chin,_Contemporary_Arts_Museum_Houston,_1978.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/89/%27The_Manila_Palm%27%2C_sculpture_by_Mel_Chin%2C_Contemporary_Arts_Museum_Houston%2C_1978.JPG","/wiki/File:%27The_Manila_Palm%27,_sculpture_by_Mel_Chin,_Contemporary_Arts_Museum_Houston,_1978.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Contemporary_Arts_Museum_Houston","/wiki/Bryant_Park","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Public_Art_Fund","/wiki/Gustave_Dor%C3%A9","/wiki/Myrrha","/wiki/Dante","/wiki/Inferno_(Dante)","/wiki/Hirshhorn_Museum","/wiki/Washington,_D.C.","/wiki/Greek_philosophy","/wiki/Chinese_philosophy","/wiki/White_House","/wiki/Latin_America","/wiki/Monroe_Doctrine","/wiki/Spike_fiddle","/wiki/Hammer_and_sickle","/wiki/Ethiopia","/w/index.php?title=Beijing_opera_drum&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/C.I.A.","/wiki/Tibet","/w/index.php?title=GALA_Committee&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Prime-time","/wiki/Melrose_Place","#cite_note-television-3","#cite_note-insignificance-4","/wiki/Sotheby%27s","/wiki/File:Dopwiki.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/30/Dopwiki.jpg/300px-Dopwiki.jpg","/wiki/File:Dopwiki.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Storefront_for_Art_and_Architecture","/wiki/Kurd","/w/index.php?title=Satellite_telemetry&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/3D_computer_graphics","/wiki/Turkish_carpet","/w/index.php?title=Rufus_Chaney&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Hyperaccumulators","/wiki/St._Paul,_Minnesota","/wiki/Palmerton,_Pennsylvania","/wiki/Stuttgart","/wiki/Public_Broadcasting_Service","/wiki/Art21","/wiki/East_Tennessee_State_University","/wiki/Houston_Art_Car_Parade","/wiki/File:24.OSFlower.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e9/24.OSFlower.jpg/200px-24.OSFlower.jpg","/wiki/File:24.OSFlower.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Station_Museum_of_Contemporary_Art","/wiki/Walker_Art_Center","/wiki/Minneapolis","/wiki/The_Menil_Collection","/wiki/Houston","/wiki/Storefront_for_Art_and_Architecture","/wiki/The_Fabric_Workshop_and_Museum","/wiki/Philadelphia","/w/index.php?title=Frederieke_Taylor_Gallery&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Santiago,_Chile","#cite_note-insignificance-4","/wiki/National_Endowment_for_the_Arts","/wiki/New_York_State_Council_for_the_Arts","/w/index.php?title=Art_Matters&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Creative_Capital","/w/index.php?title=Penny_McCall&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Joan_Mitchell","/wiki/Rockefeller","/wiki/Louis_Comfort_Tiffany","/wiki/Nancy_Graves","/w/index.php?title=United_States_Artist&action=edit&redlink=1","#cite_note-5","/wiki/Havana","/wiki/Cuba","/wiki/Venice","/wiki/Kwangju_Biennale","/wiki/Hirshhorn_Museum","/wiki/Washington_D.C.","/wiki/Museum_of_Contemporary_Art,_Los_Angeles","/wiki/Whitney_Museum_of_American_Art","/wiki/P.S.1_Contemporary_Art_Center","/wiki/Museum_of_Modern_Art","/wiki/Asian_American_Arts_Centre","/wiki/Hurricane_Katrina","/w/index.php?title=Operation_Paydirt&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Operation_Paydirt&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Fundred_Dollar_Bill_Project","/w/index.php?title=Fritschy_Culture_Award&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Sittard","#cite_note-6","/w/index.php?title=Frtitschy_Culture_Award&action=edit&redlink=1","#cite_note-7","/w/index.php?title=Mel_Chin&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-art_1-0","#cite_ref-2","http://www.nytimes.com/1984/08/14/nyregion/new-york-day-by-day-the-see-through-woman-of-bryant-p
