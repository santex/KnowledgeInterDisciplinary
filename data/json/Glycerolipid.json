Mashaghi, S.;\nJadidi, T.; Koenderink, G.; Mashaghi, A. Lipid Nanotechnology. Int. J. Mol. Sci.\n2013, 14, 4242-4282.[http://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/14/2/4242]\n\nLipids may be broadly defined as hydrophobic or amphiphilic small molecules; the\namphiphilic nature of some lipids allows them to form structures such as\nvesicles, liposomes, or membranes in an aqueous environment. Biological lipids\noriginate entirely or in part from two distinct types of biochemical subunits or\n\"building-blocks\": ketoacyl and isoprene groups. Using\nthis approach, lipids may be divided into eight categories: fatty acids,\nglycerolipids, glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids, saccharolipids, and\npolyketides (derived from condensation of ketoacyl subunits); and sterol lipids\nand prenol lipids (derived from condensation of isoprene subunits).\n\nAlthough the term lipid is sometimes used as a synonym for fats, fats are a\nsubgroup of lipids called triglycerides. Lipids also encompass molecules such as\nfatty acids and their derivatives (including tri-, di-, monoglycerides, and\nphospholipids), as well as other sterol-containing metabolites such as\ncholesterol. Although humans and other mammals use various\nbiosynthetic pathways to both break down and synthesize lipids, some essential\nlipids cannot be made this way and must be obtained from the diet.\n","linknr":1797,"url":"Glycerolipid","recorded":1362508056,"links":106,"instances":["biology","medical"],"pdf":["http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v341/n6239/pdf/341197a0.pdf","http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v341/n6239/pdf/341197a0.pdf"],"categories":["Lipids|*","Underwater
