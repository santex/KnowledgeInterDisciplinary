(Author: David Bjorgen)]]\n\n'Respect' gives a positive feeling of esteem or deference for a person or other\nentity (such as a nation or a religion), and also specific actions and conduct\nrepresentative of that esteem. Respect can be a specific feeling of regard for\nthe actual qualities of the one respected (e.g., \"I have great respect for her\njudgement\"). It can also be conduct in accord with a specific ethic of respect.\nRude conduct is usually considered to indicate a lack of respect, 'disrespect',\nwhere as actions that honor somebody or something indicate respect. Specific\nethics of respect are of fundamental importance to various cultures. Respect for\ntradition and legitimate authority is identified by Jonathan Haidt as one of\nfive fundamental moral values shared to a greater or lesser degree by different\nsocieties and individuals. {{cite journal|title=When\nMorality Opposes Justice: Conservatives Have Moral Intuitions That Liberals May\nNot Recognize|journal=Social Justice Research|year=2007\n|first=Jonathan|last=Haidt|coauthors=Jesse\nGraham|volume=20|issue=1|pages=98â116|doi= 10.1007/s11211-007-0034-\nz|url=http://faculty.virginia.edu/haidtlab/articles/haidt.graham.2007.when-\nmorality-opposes-justice.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2008-12-14 }} \n\nRespect should not be confused with tolerance, since tolerance doesn't\nnecessarily imply subordination to one's qualities but means treating as equal.\n\nThe antonym and opposite of respect is disrespect.\n","linknr":158,"url":"respect","recorded":1362665880,"links":38,"instances":["manner_of_address"],"pdf":["http://www.phil.cam.ac.uk/~swb24/PAPERS/religion%20and%20respect.pdf"],"categories":["Interpersonal relationships","Virtue","Positive psychology","Cultural conventions","Human behavior","Anti-social behaviour"],"headings":["Signs of respect","Hand gesture","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/65/Silence_and_Respect.jpg/180px-Silence_and_Respect.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Wikiquote-logo-en.svg/40px-Wikiquote-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["style","manner_of_address"]],"members":["style"],"related":["Arlington_County,_Virginia","Esteem","Deference","Person","Entity","Conduct","Ethic","Rudeness","Jonathan_Haidt","Moral_value","Social_Justice_Research","Toleration","Disrespect","Honorific","Pronoun","Style_(manner_of_address)","India","Saraswati","Pranāma","Lakshmi"]}
