(Author: David Bjorgen)]] 'Respect' is a positive\nfeeling of esteem or deference for a person or other entity (such as a nation or\na religion), and also specific actions and conduct representative of that\nesteem. Respect can be a specific feeling of regard for the actual qualities of\nthe one respected (e.g., \"I have great respect for her judgment\"). It can also\nbe conduct in accord with a specific ethic of respect. Rude conduct is usually\nconsidered to indicate a lack of respect, 'disrespect', where as actions that\nhonor somebody or something indicate respect. Specific ethics of respect are of\nfundamental importance to various cultures. Respect for tradition and legitimate\nauthority is identified by Jonathan Haidt, a professor at the New York\nUniversity Stern School of Business, as one of five fundamental moral values\nshared to a greater or lesser degree by different societies and individuals.<ref\nname='Morality'>{{cite journal|title=When Morality Opposes Justice:\nConservatives Have Moral Intuitions That Liberals May Not\nRecognize|journal=Social Justice Research|year=2007\n|first=Jonathan|last=Haidt|coauthors=Jesse\nGraham|volume=20|issue=1|pages=98–116|doi= 10.1007/s11211-007-0034-\nz|url=http://faculty.virginia.edu/haidtlab/articles/haidt.graham.2007.when-\nmorality-opposes-justice.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2008-12-14 }} </ref>\n\nRespect is both given and received. We expect other people to respect us in\nreturn for the respect we show them. Respect is also something that is earned by\nthe standards of the particular society in which one lives. Respect cannot be\nmeasured as a quantity, cannot be bought or traded, it is one of those things\nthat is earned and built over time, but that can be lost with one stupid or\ninconsiderate act. One can ask or beg for respect, but only others can bestow us\nwith respect as a result of their perceived treatment by us. Continued caring\ninteractions are then required to maintain or increase that original earned\nrespect. Respect cannot always be seen or observed by actions, but for those who\npractice chivalry, the outward display of respect is refreshing. Some women view\nthis as patronizing and demeaning, but in its pure form chivalry is about nearly\nabsolute respect.\n\nRespect should not be confused with tolerance, since tolerance doesn't\nnecessarily imply subordination to one's qualities but means treating as equal.\n\nThe antonym and opposite of respect is disrespect.\n","title":"respect","headings":["Self Respect","Respect For Others In Society","Signs of respect","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["1: Arlington_County,_Virginia","1: Esteem","1: Deference","1: Person","1: Entity","1: Conduct","1: Ethic","1: Rudeness","1: Jonathan_Haidt","1: Moral_value","1: Social_Justice_Research","1: Chivalry","1: Toleration","1: Disrespect","1: Honorific","1: Pronoun","1: India","1: Saraswati","1: PranÄma","1: Lakshmi","1: Affection","1: Friendships","1: Kowtowing"]}
