It was the home of the Rev. James Caldwell, a\nPresbyterian minister and active supporter of the Patriot cause during the\nRevolutionary War.\n\nThe war is intertwined with the early history of the building. An original\nparsonage dating to 1730 was burned in 1780 by a Loyalist mob, and later that year Caldwell's wife Hannah was killed by British\nsoldiers in the house during the Battle of Connecticut Farms. , retrieved March 4, 2008. \"As British troops returned to\nConnecticut Farms, Abigail looked out a rear bedroom window and seeing a soldier\nwalking to the house said: \"A soldier is near the house.\" Young Elias said, \"Let\nme see!\" Hannah pushed Elias away and looked out the window. She was shot by a\nBritish soldier who fired his musket. She fell back and died.\" Caldwell\nhimself was shot by an American sentry a year later.\n\nIn 1782, with the war over, what is now Connecticut Farms Presbyterian Church\nbuilt the present building. It continued to serve as a home for its pastors\nuntil the 20th century, when the church built one closer to the building. In 1982 it was added to the National Register of\nHistoric Places, as a well-preserved 18th-century farmhouse with a historical\nconnection.\n\nIt currently serves as a historical museum, owned and operated by the Union\nTownship Historical Society. It is open to the public on weekday mornings and\nafternoons. Several state grants have been made for renovations and upkeep of\nthe aging structure.\n","linknr":194,"url":"Caldwell_Parsonage","recorded":1374540097,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Caldwell_Parsonage&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Caldwell_Parsonage&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/National_Register_of_Historic_Places","/wiki/File:Caldwell_Parsonage.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2e/Caldwell_Parsonage.jpg/250px-Caldwell_Parsonage.jpg","/wiki/File:Location_map_of_Union_County,_New_Jersey.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/Location_map_of_Union_County%2C_New_Jersey.svg/240px-Location_map_of_Union_County%2C_New_Jersey.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/0c/Red_pog.svg/7px-Red_pog.svg.png","/wiki/Union_Township,_Union_County,_New_Jersey","/wiki/New_Jersey","/wiki/Newark,_New_Jersey","//tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Caldwell_Parsonage&params=40_41_43_N_74_17_00_W_region:US_type:landmark","/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system","//tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Caldwell_Parsonage&params=40_41_43_N_74_17_00_W_region:US_type:landmark","/wiki/Parsonage","/wiki/Union_Township,_Union_County,_New_Jersey","/wiki/New_Jersey","/wiki/James_Caldwell_(clergyman)","/wiki/Presbyterian","/wiki/Patriot_(American_Revolution)","/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War","/wiki/Loyalist_(American_Revolution)","#cite_note-State_grant1-1","/wiki/Battle_of_Connecticut_Farms","#cite_note-CPbrochure-2","/wiki/Connecticut_Farms_Presbyterian_Church","#cite_note-CT_farms_history-3","/wiki/National_Register_of_Historic_Places","#cite_note-State_grant1-1","#cite_note-State_grant2-4","/w/index.php?title=Caldwell_Parsonage&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/National_Register_of_Historic_Places_listings_in_Union_County,_New_Jersey","/w/index.php?title=Caldwell_Parsonage&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-State_grant1_1-0","#cite_ref-State_grant1_1-1","http://www.nj.gov/dca/njht/funded/sitedetails/caldwellparsonage.html","#cite_ref-CPbrochure_2-0","http://www.ctfarms.org/download/CPBrochure.pdf","/wiki/Musket","#cite_ref-CT_farms_history_3-0","http://www.ctfarms.org/history.html","#cite_ref-State_grant2_4-0","http://www.state.nj.us/dca/njht/funded/sitedetails/ct-caldwell_parsonage.html","/wiki/Template:National_Register_of_Historic_Places","/wiki/Template_talk:National_Register_of_Historic_Places","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:National_Register_of_Historic_Places&action=edit","/wiki/National_Register_of_Historic_Places","/wiki/National_Register_of_Historic_Places_architectural_style_categories","/wiki/Contributing_property","/wiki/Historic_districts_in_the_United_States","/wiki/History_of_the_National_Register_of_Historic_Places","/wiki/Keeper_of_the_Register","/wiki/National_Park_Service","/wiki/National_Register_of_Historic_Places_property_types","/wiki/National_Register_of_Historic_Places_listings_in_Alabama","/wiki/National_Register_of_Historic_Places_listings_in_Alaska","/wiki/National_Register_of_Historic_Places_listings_in_Arizona","/wiki/National_Register_of_Historic_Places_listings_in_Arkansas","/wiki/National_Register_of_Historic_Places_listings_in_California","/wiki/National_Register_of_Historic_Places_listings_in_Colorado","/wiki/National_Register_of_Historic_Places_listings_in_Connecticut","/wiki/National_Register_of_Historic_Places_listings_in_Delaware","/wiki/National_Register_of_Historic_Places_listings_in_Florida","/wiki/National_Register_of_Historic_Places_listings_in_Georgia","/wiki/National_Register_of_Historic_Places_listings_in_Hawaii","/wiki/National_Register_of_Historic_Places_listings_in_Idaho","/wiki/National_Register_of_Historic_Places_listings_in_Illinois","/wiki/National_Register_of_Historic_Places_listings_in_Indiana","/wiki/National_Register_of_Historic_Places_listings_in_Iowa","/wiki/National_Register_of_Historic_Places_listings_in_Kansas","/wiki/National_Register_of_Historic_Places_listings_in_Kentucky","/wiki/National_Register_of_Historic_Places_listings_in_Louisiana","/wiki/National_Register_of_Historic_Places_listings_in_Maine","/wiki/National_Register_of_Historic_Places_listings_in_Maryland","/wiki/National_Register_of_Historic_Places_listings_in_Massachusetts","/wiki/National_Register_o
