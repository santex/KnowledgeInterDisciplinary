It has sections across 27 countries; however, its\nstrongest presence is in Europe, especially in Britain.\n\nThe politics of the IST are similar to the politics of many Trotskyist\nInternationals. Where it differs with many is on the question of the Soviet\nUnion, the IST adopting the position that it was a \"state capitalist\" economy,\nrather than a \"degenerated workers' state\" {{cite web\n

Revolution publisher=Marxists Internet Archive\n | date=1963 accessdate=25 September 2010\n}} The IST sees the often referred to \"socialist\" countries, such as the\nformer Eastern Bloc states, China, Vietnam, North Korea and Cuba as an inverse\nof classical Marxism, arguing they are \"Stalinist\" in nature. {{cite web\n | url=http://www.marxisme.dk/arkiv/molyneux/realmarx/index.htm

organisational\nstructures and has only ever made one publicly known decision, which was to\nexpel the US International Socialist Organization (ISO) from its ranks. {{cite web\n |

Fourth International. {{cite web\n | url=http://www.bolshevik.org/Pamphlets/CWI/CWI_history.html title=A Brief\n | Sketch of the Militant Tendencyâs History publisher=Committee for a Workers'\n |
