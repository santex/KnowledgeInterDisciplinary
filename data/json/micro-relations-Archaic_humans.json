This category typically includes [[Homo\nheidelbergensis]], [[Homo rhodesiensis]], [[Homo neanderthalensis]], and may\nalso include [[Homo antecessor]].\n\nModern humans are theorized to have evolved from archaic humans, who in turn\nevolved from [[Homo erectus]]. Varieties of archaic humans are sometimes\nincluded under the binomial name \"Homo sapiens\" because their brain size is very\nsimilar to that of modern humans. Archaic humans had a brain size averaging 1200\nto 1400 cubic centimeters, which overlaps with the range of modern humans.\nArchaics are distinguished from anatomically modern humans by having a thick\nskull, prominent brow ridges and the lack of a prominent chin.

Non-modern varieties of Homo are certain to have survived until after\n30,000 years ago, and perhaps until as recent as 10,000 years ago. Which of\nthese, if any, are included under the term \"archaic human\" is a matter of\ndefinition and varies among authors. Nonetheless, according to recent genetic\nstudies, modern humans seem to have bred with \"at least two groups\" of ancient\nhumans: Neanderthals and Denisovans. New evidence\nsuggests another group may also have been extant as recently as 11,500 years\nago, the [[Red Deer Cave people]] of China.\n","linknr":398,"url":"Archaic_humans","recorded":1362373290,"links":34,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.anthropology.hawaii.edu/People/Faculty/Pietrusewsky/anth310/labs/Lab05.pdf"],"categories":["Recent single origin hypothesis","Human evolution","Humans","Middle Stone Age","Paleoanthropology","Early species of Homo|Homo sapiens"],"headings":["Terminology and definition","Brain size expansion","Origin of language","Fossils","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/63/Broken_Hill_Skull_%28Replica01%29.jpg/200px-Broken_Hill_Skull_%28Replica01%29.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f2/Sapiens_neanderthal_comparison.jpg/460px-Sapiens_neanderthal_comparison.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/Tree_of_life.svg/16px-Tree_of_life.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Human","Anatomically_modern_humans","Brow_ridge","Chin","Toba_catastrophe_theory","Genetics","Modern_humans","Neanderthals","Denisovans","Omo_remains","Qafzeh","Punctuated_equilibrium","Robin_Dunbar","Atapuerca_Mountains","Saldanha_Man","Altamura_Man","Kabwe_Skull","Steinheim_Skull","Early_human_migrations","Evolution_of_human_intelligence","Human_evolution","Middle_Paleolithic","Neanderthal_extinction_hypotheses","Recent_African_origin_of_modern_humans"]}
