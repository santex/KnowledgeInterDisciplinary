Art-directed by Dutch-born Rudy VanderLans using fonts designed\nby his wife, Czechoslovakian-born Zuzana Licko, Emigre was one of the first\npublications to use Macintosh computers and had a large influence on graphic\ndesigners moving into desktop publishing (DTP). Its variety of layouts, use of\nguest designers, and opinionated articles also had an effect on other design\npublications.\n\nThe focus of Emigre was both redundant and wandering â both positive qualities\nas a journal produced by a tight and evolving group of designers and writers\nwith Vanderlans at the center. Vanderlans was typically editor, though guest-\neditors also appeared (Gail Swanlund, Anne Burdick, Andrew Blauvelt) and the\nwork/writing of Zuzana Licko and Jeffery Keedy reappeared throughout the\nmagazine's history.\n\nThe magazine began in 1984 with a focus on the Ã©migrÃ©. The first eight issues\nwere concerned with boundaries, international culture, travel accounts and\nalienation (as the issues' titles suggest). The first eight issues also\nincorporated a dynamic aesthetic that caught the attention of designers and led\nto the next stage in the magazine's evolution.\n\nBeginning with Issue 9 â devoted to the art of Vaughan Oliver at 4AD â the\nmagazine explored design in itself, devoting issues to Cranbrook, the Macintosh,\ntype design and individual graphic designers. In two issues in 1992 and 1993,\nthe magazine chronicled the work of David Carson and Raygun.\n\nIncreasingly, Emigre became a platform for essays and writings on design. This\naspect of Emigre came to the forefront with issues in 1994 and the magazine\nchanged its format in 1995 from its oversized layout to a text-friendlier format\nthat debuted with Issue 33. The magazine retained this character through Issue\n59 in 2001.\n\nEmigre then took a sharp turn with four re-formatted issues in 2001 and 2002\nthat included one DVD and three compact discs (featuring the music of Honey\nBarbara, The Grassy Knoll and Scenic).\n\nIn its fifth and final incarnation, the last six issues of Emigre were co-\npublished by Princeton Architectural Press as small softcover books. The last\nissue, The End, was published in 2005.\n\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 1.5em;\"\n|+ Emigre issues in book format - Issue 64: || ISBN 1-56898-409-X - Issue 65:
