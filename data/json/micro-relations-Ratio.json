{"cursor":"18987","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n.]]\n\nIn mathematics, a 'ratio' is a relationship between two numbers of the same\nkind Wentworth, p. 55 (e.g., objects, persons, students, spoonfuls,\nunits of whatever identical dimension), usually expressed as \"a to b\" or a:b,\nsometimes expressed arithmetically as a dimensionless quotient of the\ntwo New International Encyclopedia that explicitly indicates how many\ntimes the first number contains the second (not necessarily an\ninteger). Penny Cyclopedia, p. 307\n\nIn layman's terms a ratio represents, simply, for every amount of one thing, how\nmuch there is of another thing. For example, supposing one has 8 oranges and 6\nlemons in a bowl of fruit, the ratio of oranges to lemons would be 4:3 (which is\nequivalent to 8:6) and the ratio of lemons to oranges would be 3:4.\nAdditionally, the ratio of oranges to the total amount of fruit is 4:7\n(equivalent to 8:14). The 4:7 ratio can be further converted to a fraction of\n4/7 to represent how much of the fruit is oranges.\n","linknr":228,"url":"Ratio","recorded":1362374895,"links":41,"instances":["mathematics","mathematics","music","chemistry","mathematics","mathematics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Elementary mathematics","Algebra","Ratios"],"headings":["Notation and terminology","History and etymology","Examples","Number of terms","Proportions","Reduction","Odds","Different units","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/de/Aspect-ratio-4x3.svg/220px-Aspect-ratio-4x3.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/9/3/2/932b56658ad91138de37bd70e2265709.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/b/8/8b883c896019dad7a0b493cf42e21c6b.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/4/5/e4565ad81b2d311d2b2bf06ca9a3407a.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/1/e/e/1eee97e5307523e2a06b1801be83d66b.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["fraction","mathematics"],["fraction","mathematics"],["reduction","mathematics"],["mass_concentration","chemistry"],["fraction","mathematics"],["interval","music"],["proportionality","mathematics"],["rule_of_three","mathematics"]],"members":["rule_of_three","proportionality","interval","mass_concentration","reduction","fraction"],"related":["Mathematics","Objects","Quotient","Integer","Fraction_(mathematics)","Fraction_(mathematics)","Rational_number","Ancient_Greek","Logos","Latin","Pythagoreanism","Eudoxus","Euclid's_Elements","Aliquot_part","Archimedean_property","Dedekind_cut","Geometric_progression","Geometric_mean","Water-cement_ratio","Television","Lowest_common_denominator","Percent","Percentages","Reduction_(mathematics)","Irreducible_fraction","Divisor","Multiplier","Dimensionless_quantity","Dimensional_analysis","Mass_concentration_(chemistry)","Solvent","Aspect_ratio","Fraction_(mathematics)","Golden_ratio","Interval_(music)","Price/performance_ratio","Proportionality_(mathematics)","Ratio_estimator","Rule_of_three_(mathematics)","Slope"]}
