{"cursor":"51422","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" ZX Spectrum computer board; a populated PCB, showing the conductive traces,\n vias (the through-hole paths to the other surface), and some mounted electrical\n components]] A 'printed circuit board', or 'PCB', is used to mechanically\n support and electrically connect electronic components using conductive\n pathways, tracks or signal traces etched from copper sheets laminated onto a\n non-conductive substrate. When the board has only copper tracks and features,\n and no circuit elements such as capacitors, resistors or active devices have\n been manufactured into the actual substrate of the board, it is more correctly\n referred to as 'printed wiring board' ('PWB') or 'etched wiring board'. Use of\n the term 'PWB' or 'printed wiring board' although more accurate and distinct\n from what would be known as a true 'printed circuit board', has generally\n fallen by the wayside for many people as the distinction between 'circuit' and\n 'wiring' has become blurred. Today printed wiring (circuit) boards are used in\n virtually all but the simplest commercially produced electronic devices, and\n allow fully automated assembly processes that were not possible or practical in\n earlier era tag type circuit assembly processes.\n\nA PCB populated with electronic components is called a 'printed circuit\nassembly' ('PCA'), 'printed circuit board assembly' or 'PCB Assembly' ('PCBA').\nIn informal use the term \"PCB\" is used both for bare and assembled boards, the\ncontext clarifying the meaning.\n\nAlternatives to PCBs include wire wrap and point-to-point construction. PCBs\nmust initially be designed and laid out, but become cheaper, faster to make, and\npotentially more reliable for high-volume production since production and\nsoldering of PCBs can be automated. Much of the electronics industry's PCB\ndesign, assembly, and quality control needs are set by standards published by\nthe IPC organization.\n","linknr":559,"url":"Printed_circuit_board","recorded":1362477058,"links":89,"instances":["electricity","electronics","electronics","electronics","electronics","pcb","woodworking"],"pdf":["http://www.ieee.org/documents/brunetti_rl.pdf","http://renovare.com/Application%20_brief_2.pdf","http://www.coates.de/ccp/connections/liquid.pdf","http://www.coates.de/ccp/connections/liquid.pdf","http://www.smta.org/files/smta_techscan_0201_overview.pdf","http://www.smta.org/files/smta_techscan_0201_overview.pdf","http://www.lg-advice.ro/pdf/IPC-2251-cuprins.pdf","http://www.quick-teck.co.uk/TechArticleDoc/19196513481352925083.pdf","http://www.ieee.li/pdf/viewgraphs_pwb_design.pdf","http://www.analog.com/library/analogDialogue/archives/39-05/Web_Ch7_final_J.pdf"],"categories":["Electrical
