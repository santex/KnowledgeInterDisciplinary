{"cursor":"26883","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n manned spacecraft (TMA version shown) have flown since 1967, originally for a\n Soviet manned lunar program, but currently supporting the International Space\n Station.]] flew 135 times from 1981 to 2011, supporting Spacelab, Mir, and ISS.\n (Columbia's first launch shown)]]\n\nA 'spacecraft' (or 'spaceship') is a vehicle, vessel or machine designed to fly\nin outer space. Spacecraft are used for a variety of purposes, including\ncommunications, earth observation, meteorology, navigation, planetary\nexploration and transportation of humans and cargo.\n\nOn a sub-orbital spaceflight, a spacecraft enters space and then returns to the\nsurface, without having gone into an orbit. For orbital spaceflights, spacecraft\nenter closed orbits around the Earth or around other celestial bodies.\nSpacecraft used for human spaceflight carry people on board as crew or\npassengers from start or on orbit (space stations) only, while those used for\nrobotic space missions operate either autonomously or telerobotically. Robotic\nspacecraft used to support scientific research are space probes. Robotic\nspacecraft that remain in orbit around a planetary body are artificial\nsatellites. Only a handful of interstellar probes, such as Pioneer 10 and 11,\nVoyager 1 and 2, and New Horizons, are currently on trajectories that leave our\nSolar System.\n\nOrbital spacecraft may be recoverable or not. By method of reentry to Earth they\nmay be divided in non-winged space capsules and winged spaceplanes.\n\nCurrently, only twenty-four nations have spaceflight technology: Russia (Russian\nFederal Space Agency), the United States (NASA, the US Air Force, SpaceX (a U.S\nprivate aerospace company)), the member states of the European Space Agency, the\nPeople's Republic of China (China National Space Administration), Japan (Japan\nAerospace Exploration Agency), and India (Indian Space Research Organisation).\n\nSpacecraft and space travel are common themes in works of science fiction.\n","linknr":705,"url":"Spacecraft","recorded":1362268737,"links":108,"instances":["satellite","spacecraft","spacecraft","spacecraft","spacecraft","spacecraft","selene","spacecraft","spacecraft","moon","esa","spacecraft","shuttle","planet","probe","spacecraft","spacecraft","spacecraft"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Astronautics","Spacecraft|","Pressure
