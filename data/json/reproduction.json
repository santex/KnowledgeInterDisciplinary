The small plant in front is about 1&nbsp;cm (0.4&nbsp;in) tall. The concept\nof \"individual\" is obviously stretched by this asexual reproductive process.]]\n'Reproduction' (or 'procreation') is the biological process by which new\n\"offspring\" individual organisms are produced from their \"parents\". Reproduction\nis a fundamental feature of all known life; each individual organism exists as\nthe result of reproduction. The known methods of reproduction are broadly\ngrouped into two main types: sexual and asexual.\n\nIn asexual reproduction, an individual can reproduce without involvement with\nanother individual of that species. The division of a bacterial cell into two\ndaughter cells is an example of asexual reproduction. Asexual reproduction is\nnot, however, limited to single-celled organisms. Most plants have the ability\nto reproduce asexually and the ant species Mycocepurus smithii is thought to\nreproduce entirely by asexual means.\n\nSexual reproduction typically requires the involvement of two individuals or\ngametes, one each from opposite type of sex. The propagation of organisms can\nalso occur through cloning.\n","title":"reproduction","headings":["Asexual reproduction","Sexual reproduction","Same-sex reproduction","Reproductive strategies","Asexual vs. sexual reproduction","Life without reproduction","Lottery principle","See also","Notes","References","Further reading","External links"]},"micro-relation":["3: Haploid","3: Gametes","2: Biological_process","2: Organism","2: Bacteria","2: Plant","2: Gamete","2: Virus","2: Invertebrate","2: Yeast","2: Parthenogenesis","2: Mitosis","2: Fertilization","2: Male","2: Aphid","2: Ovum","2: Diploid","2: Meiosis","2: Chromosomes","2: R/K_selection_theory","2: George_C._Williams","1: Life","1: Sexual_reproduction","1: Asexual_reproduction","1: Unicellular_organism","1: Mycocepurus_smithii","1: Sex","1: Cloning","1: Binary_fission","1: Budding","1: Mating_of_yeast","1: Jellyfish","1: Vegetative_reproduction","1: Bacterial_conjugation","1: Spore_formation","1: Embryo","1: Seed","1: Apomixis","1: Water_flea","1: Bee","1: Parasitic_wasp","1: Vertebrate","1: Reptile","1: Fish","1: Bird","1: Shark","1: Genetics","1: Sperm","1: Female","1: Isogamete","1: Isogamy","1: Ciliates","1: Syngen","1: Animal","1: Plants","1: Alleles","1: Bryophyte","1: Zygotes","1: Sporangium","1: Genetic_recombination","1: Spermatozoa","1: Hermaphrodite","1: Cell_division","1: Somatic_cells","1: Tetraploid","1: Female_sperm","1: Male_egg","1: Human","1: Northern_Gannet","1: Sexual_maturity","1: Adult","1: Rabbit","1: Drosophila_melanogster","1: K-selection","1: R-selection","1: Evolution","1: Female_sperm_storage","1: Annual_plant","1: Perennial_plant","1: Slime_mold","1: Sea_anemone","1: Starfish","1: Origin_of_life","1: Abiogenesis","1: Last_universal_ancestor","1: Timeline_of_evolution","1: Metabolism","1: Self-replication","1: Synthetic_Genomics","1: M._mycoides","1: Lottery","1: Analogy","1: Allogamy","1: Breeding_season","1: Digital_reproduction","1: Masting","1: Mating_system","1: Plant_reproduction","1: Reproductive_system","1: Carl_Zimmer"]}
