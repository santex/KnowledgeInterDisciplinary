A hare\nless than one year old is called a 'leveret'. Four species commonly known as\ntypes of hare are classified outside of Lepus: the hispid hare ([[Caprolagus\nhispidus]]), and three species known as red rock hares (Pronolagus spp.).\n\nHares are very fast-moving animals; the European brown hare (Lepus europaeus) is\nable to run at speeds of up to . The five species of\njackrabbit found in central and western North America are able to run at , and\ncan leap up to 3m (ten feet) at a time. They live or in pairs, while\na \"drove\" is the collective noun for a group of hares.\n\nA common type of hare in Arctic North America is the snowshoe hare, replaced\nfarther south by the black-tailed jackrabbit, white-tailed jackrabbit, and\nother species.\n\nNormally a shy animal, the European brown hare changes its behavior in spring,\nwhen hares can be seen in broad daylight chasing one another around meadows;\nthis appears to be competition between males to attain dominance (and hence more\naccess to breeding females). During this spring frenzy, hares can be seen\n\"boxing\"; one hare striking another with its paws (probably the origin of the\nterm \"mad as a March hare\"). For a long time, this had been thought to be\nintermale competition, but closer observation has revealed it is usually a\nfemale hitting a male to prevent copulation.
