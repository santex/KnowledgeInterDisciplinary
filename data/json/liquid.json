      "text" : "\n\n of liquid water minimizes the surface area, which is the natural result of\n surface tension in liquids.]]\n\n\n'Liquid' is one of the four fundamental states of matter (the others being\nsolid, gas, and plasma), and is the only state with a definite volume but no\nfixed shape. A liquid is made up of tiny vibrating particles of matter, such as\natoms and molecules, held together by intermolecular bonds. Water is, by far,\nthe most common liquid on Earth. Like a gas, a liquid is able to flow and take\nthe shape of a container. Some liquids resist compression, while others can be\ncompressed. Unlike a gas, a liquid does not disperse to fill every space of a\ncontainer, and maintains a fairly constant density. A distinctive property of\nthe liquid state is surface tension, leading to wetting phenomena.\n\nThe density of a liquid is usually close to that of a solid, and much higher\nthan in a gas. Therefore, liquid and solid are both termed condensed matter. On\nthe other hand, as liquids and gases share the ability to flow, they are both\ncalled fluids. Although liquid water is abundant on Earth, this state of matter\nis actually the least common in the known universe, because liquids require a\nrelatively narrow temperature/pressure range to exist. Most known matter in the\nuniverse is in gaseous form (with traces of detectable solid matter) as\ninterstellar clouds or in plasma form within stars.\n",
