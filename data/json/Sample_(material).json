The things could\nbe countable objects such as individual items available as units for sale, or a\nmaterial not countable as individual items. Even though the word sample implies\na smaller quantity taken from a larger amount, sometimes full specimens are\ncalled samples if they are taken for analysis, testing, or investigation like\nother samples. An act of obtaining a sample is called 'sampling', which can be\ndone by a person or automatically. Samples of material can be taken or provided\nfor testing, analysis, inspection, investigation, demonstration, or trial use.\nSometimes, sampling may be continuously ongoing.\n","linknr":113,"url":"Sample_(material)","recorded":1362481244,"links":24,"instances":["disambiguation","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Analytical chemistry"],"headings":["Sample characteristics","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/19/Gamme_vin_ros%C3%A9_Provence.JPG/230px-Gamme_vin_ros%C3%A9_Provence.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/62/00_BMA_Automation_Sampling_cock.JPG/230px-00_BMA_Automation_Sampling_cock.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["tissue","biology"],["specimen","disambiguation"]],"members":["specimen","tissue"],"related":["Material","Solid","Liquid","Gas","Gel","Sputum","Tissue_(biology)","Organism","Volume","Mass","Science","Core_sample","Ice_core","Specimen_(disambiguation)"]}
