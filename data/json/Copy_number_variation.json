{"cursor":"16695","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" has created a copy-number variation. The chromosome now has two copies of this\n section of DNA, rather than one.]]\n\n'Copy-number variations' ('CNV's)âa form of structural variationâare alterations\nof the DNA of a genome that results in the cell having an abnormal number of\ncopies of one or more sections of the DNA. CNVs correspond to relatively large\nregions of the genome that have been deleted (fewer than the normal number) or\nduplicated (more than the normal number) on certain chromosomes. For example,\nthe chromosome that normally has sections in order as A-B-C-D might\ninstead have sections A-B-C-C-D (a duplication of \"C\") or A-B-\nD (a deletion of \"C\").\n\nThis variation accounts for roughly 12% of human genomic DNA and each variation\nmay range from about one kilobase (1,000 nucleotide bases) to several megabases\nin size. CNVs contrast with single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs),\nwhich affect only one single nucleotide base.\n","linknr":408,"url":"Copy_number_variation","recorded":1362374192,"links":24,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v39/n7s/pdf/ng0707s-S1.pdf","http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v39/n7s/pdf/ng0707s-S1.pdf","http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v28/n1/pdf/nbt.1600.pdf","http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v28/n1/pdf/nbt.1600.pdf"],"categories":["Genetics","Molecular biology"],"headings":["Sources","Identification","Prevalence in humans","Role in disease","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/72/Gene-duplication.png/170px-Gene-duplication.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Structural_variation","Genome","Kilobase","Nucleotide_base","Single-nucleotide_polymorphism","Nucleotide_base","Replication_fork","Low_copy_repeats","Segmental_duplication","Duplication_shadowing","Cytogenetics","Fluorescent_in_situ_hybridization","Comparative_genomic_hybridization","Array_comparative_genomic_hybridization","Virtual_Karyotype","SNP_array","Next_generation_sequencing","Escherichia_coli","DNA_replication","DNA_replication","Gene","Protein","Human_genome_project","Cancer","Epidermal_growth_factor_receptor","Lung_cancer","CCL3L1","FCGR3B","Autism","Schizophrenia","Rheumatoid_arthritis","Amylase","Diploid","Chimpanzee","Starch","Comparative_genomics","Copy_number_analysis","Human_genome","Inparanoid","Molecular_evolution","Pseudogenes","Segmental_duplication","Tandem_exon_duplication","Virtual_Karyotype","National_Human_Genome_Research_Institute","Sanger_Institute"]}
