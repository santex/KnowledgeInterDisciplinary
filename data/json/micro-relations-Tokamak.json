{"cursor":"24559","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" Project Tokamak reactor.]] A 'tokamak' is a device using a magnetic field to\n confine a plasma in the shape of a torus. Achieving a stable plasma equilibrium\n requires magnetic field lines that move around the torus in a helical shape.\n Such a helical field can be generated by adding a toroidal field (traveling\n around the torus in circles) and a poloidal field (traveling in circles\n orthogonal to the toroidal field). In a tokamak, the toroidal field is produced\n by electromagnets that surround the torus, and the poloidal field is the result\n of a toroidal electric current that flows inside the plasma. This current is\n induced inside the plasma with a second set of electromagnets.\n\nThe tokamak is one of several types of magnetic confinement devices, and is one\nof the most-researched candidates for producing controlled thermonuclear fusion\npower. Magnetic fields are used for confinement since no solid material could\nwithstand the extremely high temperature of the plasma. An alternative to the\ntokamak is the stellarator.\n\nTokamaks were invented in the 1950s by Soviet physicists Igor Tamm and Andrei\nSakharov, inspired by an original idea of Oleg Lavrentiev.
