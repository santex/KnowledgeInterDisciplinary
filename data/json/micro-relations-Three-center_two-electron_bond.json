{"cursor":"3571","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'three-center two-electron bond' is an electron-deficient chemical bond where\nthree atoms share two electrons. The combination of three atomic orbitals form\nthree molecular orbitals: one bonding, one non-bonding, and one anti-bonding.\nThe two electrons go into the bonding orbital, resulting in a net bonding effect\nand constituting a chemical bond among all three atoms. In many common bonds of\nthis type, the bonding orbital is shifted towards two of the three atoms instead\nof being spread equally among all three. The simplest example of a 3c-2e bond is\nin the trihydrogen cation, .
