      "text" : "\n\ns with the changeling they have raised, John Bauer, 1913.]]\n\nA 'changeling' is a creature found in European folklore and folk religion. It is\ntypically described as being the offspring of a fairy, troll, elf or other\nlegendary creature that has been secretly left in the place of a human child.\nSometimes the term is also used to refer to the child who was taken. The\napparent changeling could also be a 'stock' or 'fetch', an enchanted piece of\nwood that would soon appear to grow sick and die. The theme of the swapped child\nis common among medieval literature and reflects concern over infants afflicted\nby unexplained diseases, disorders, or developmental disabilities.\n\nA human child might be taken due to many factors: to act as a servant, the love\nof a human child, or malice.<ref name=\"briggs71\">Katharine Briggs, An\nEncyclopedia of Fairies, Hobgoblins, Brownies, Boogies, and Other Supernatural\nCreatures \"Changelings\" (Pantheon Books, 1976) p. 71. ISBN 0-394-73467-X</ref>\nMost often it was thought that fairies exchanged the children. Some Norwegian\ntales tell that the change was made to prevent inbreeding: to give trolls and\nhumans new blood, humans were given children with enormous strength as a reward.\nIn some rare cases, the very elderly of the Fairy people would be exchanged in\nthe place of a human baby, and then the old fairy could live in comfort, being\ncoddled by its human parents.<ref name=\"Briggs 1979\">Briggs (1979)</ref> Simple\ncharms, such as an inverted coat or open iron scissors left where the child\nsleeps, were thought to ward them off; other measures included a constant watch\nover the child.<ref>[http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/changeling.html#protective\nPITT.edu]</ref>\n\n]]\n",
