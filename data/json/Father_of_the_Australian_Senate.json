It is held by the senator who has served longer, continuously,\nthan any other currently serving senator. Where two or more senators have equal\nlengths of continuous service, more than any other currently serving senators,\nthey are known as the joint Fathers of the Senate. Joint Fathers are shown in\nsmall type in the following list.\n\nThe only Father of the Senate with broken service but whose latter period of\ncontinuous service was sufficiently long to qualify was Sir Walter Cooper.\n\nThe first Senate was elected on 29 and 30 March 1901. Despite the different\nelection dates, all the members elected to that First Parliament were considered\nto have had equal seniority. It follows that there could not be a \"longest-\nserving Senator\" until only one Senator from the First Parliament was still\nserving. That occurred on 14 September 1923 with the death of Hon Edward Millen,\nleaving Sir George Pearce as the sole longest-serving Senator, and thus the\ninaugural Father of the Senate.\n\nSince that date the Fathers and joint Fathers of the Senate have been:\n\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n!From !To !Senator !Continuous term started !Status\n|- nowrap|15 September 1923 30 June 1938 Sir George Pearce 29 March 1901 Father\n|- 1 July 1938 30 June 1947 Thomas Crawford  Harry Foll 1\n|July 1917 Joint Fathers - 1 July 1947 30 June 1950 Joe\n|Collings  Gordon Brown 1 July 1932 Joint Fathers - 1\n|July 1950 30 June 1965\n|Gordon Brown\n| 1 July 1932 Father - 1 July 1965 30 June 1968 Sir Walter Cooper 1 July\n| 1935 Walter Cooper had also served between 17 November 1928 and 30 June\n| 1932.
