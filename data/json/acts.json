Apostólōn; ), often referred to simply\nas 'Acts', is the fifth book of the New Testament; Acts outlines the history of\nthe Apostolic Age.\n\nActs tells the story of the Early Christian church, with particular emphasis on\nthe ministry of the apostles Simon Peter and Paul of Tarsus, who are the central\nfigures of the middle and later chapters of the book. The early chapters, set in\nJerusalem, discuss Jesus' Resurrection, his Ascension, the Day of Pentecost, and\nthe start of the apostles' ministry. The later chapters discuss Paul's\nconversion, his ministry, and finally his arrest, imprisonment, and trip to\nRome. A major theme of the book is the expansion of the Holy Spirit's work from\nthe Jews, centering in Jerusalem, to the Gentiles throughout the Roman Empire.\n\nIt is almost universally agreed that the author of Acts also wrote the Gospel of\nLuke. The author is traditionally identified as Luke the Evangelist; see\nAuthorship of Luke–Acts for details.\n","title":"Acts%20of%20the%20Apostles","headings":["Composition","General
