In most societies it is the principal\ninstitution for the socialization of children. Anthropologists most generally\nclassify family organization as matrilocal (a mother and her children); conjugal\n(a husband, his wife, and children; also called nuclear family); and\nconsanguineal (also called an extended family) in which parents and children co-\nreside with other members of one parent's family.\n\nThere are also concepts of family that break with tradition within particular\nsocieties, or those that are transplanted via migration to flourish or else\ncease within their new societies. As a unit of socialization the family is the\nobject of analysis for sociologists of the family. Genealogy is a field which\naims to trace family lineages through history. In science, the term \"family\" has\ncome to be used as a means to classify groups of objects as being closely and\nexclusively related. In the study of animals it has been found that many species\nform groups that have similarities to human \"family\"âoften called \"packs.\"\nSexual relations among family members are regulated by rules concerning incest\nsuch as the incest taboo.\n\nExtended from the human \"family unit\" by affinity and consanguinity are concepts\nof family that are physical and metaphorical, or that grow increasingly\ninclusive extending to community, village, city, region, nationhood, global\nvillage and humanism.\n\nFamily is also an important economic unit.
