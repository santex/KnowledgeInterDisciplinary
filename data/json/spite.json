'spite' is a phenomenon that occurs when a player's\nvalue of an allocation decreases when one or more other players' valuation\nincreases. Thus, other things being equal, a player exhibiting spite will prefer\nan allocation in which other players receive less than more (if more of the good\nis desirable).\n\nIn this language, spite is difficult to analyze because one has to assess two\nsets of preferences. For example, in the divide and choose method, a spiteful\nplayer would have to make a trade-off between depriving his opponent of cake,\nand getting more himself.\n\nWithin the field of social evolution, spite is used to describe those social\nbehaviors that have a negative impact on both the actor and recipient(s). Spite\ncan be favored by kin selection when: (a) it leads to an indirect benefit to\nsome third party that is sufficiently related to the actor (Wilsonian spite);\nor (b) when it is directed primarily at negatively related individuals\n(Hamiltonian spite). Negative relatedness occurs when two individuals are less\nrelated than average.\n","title":"spite","headings":["In game theory","In industrial relations","See also","References"]},"micro-relation":["1: Fair_division","1: Divide_and_choose","1: Social_evolution","1: Kin_selection","1: Hamiltonian_spite","1: Iterated_prisoner's_dilemma","1: Tit_for_tat","1: Trade_union","1: Strike_action","1: Economy","1: Termination_of_employment","1: Union_organizer","1: Appeal_to_spite","1: Hamilton's_rule"]}
