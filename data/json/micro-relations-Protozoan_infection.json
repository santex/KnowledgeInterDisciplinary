They include organisms classified in Amoebozoa, Excavata,\nand Chromalveolata.\n\nExamples include [[Entamoeba histolytica]], [[Plasmodium]] (some of which cause\nmalaria), and [[Giardia lamblia]]. [[Trypanosoma brucei]], transmitted by the tsetse fly and the\ncause of African sleeping sickness, is another example.\n\nThe species traditionally collectively termed \"protozoa\" are not closely related\nto each other, and have only superficial similarities (eukaryotic, unicellular,\nmotile, though with exceptions.) The terms \"protozoa\" (and protist) are usually\ndiscouraged in the modern biosciences. However, this terminology is still\nencountered in medicine. This is partially because of the conservative character\nof medical classification, and partially due to the necessity of making\nidentifications of organisms based upon appearances and not upon DNA.\n\nProtozoan infections in animals may be caused by organisms in the sub-class\nCoccidia (disease: Coccidiosis) and species in the genus Besnoitia (disease:\nBesnoitiosis)\n","linknr":414,"url":"Protozoan_infection","recorded":1362500905,"links":23,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Protozoal diseases"],"headings":["Treatment","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c7/Amoebic_Ulcer_Intestine.jpg/230px-Amoebic_Ulcer_Intestine.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/Rod_of_Asclepius2.svg/9px-Rod_of_Asclepius2.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Parasitic_disease","Protozoa","Amoebozoa","Excavata","Chromalveolata","Malaria","Tsetse_fly","African_trypanosomiasis","Eukaryotic","Protist","Coccidia","Besnoitia","Besnoitiosis","Antiprotozoal_agent"]}
