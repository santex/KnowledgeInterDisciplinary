{"cursor":"4012","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The 'Archdiocese of America,' better known as the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of\nAmerica, is a jurisdiction of the Eastern Orthodox Church under the Ecumenical\nPatriarchate of Constantinople. It was formally constituted in 1922 and has had\nseven incumbents. The Archdiocese currently covers the United States and one\nparish in the Bahamas, and is mostly Greek-American in composition and culture.\n\nThe following individuals have held the office of 'Archbishop of America':\n\n* Alexander (Demoglou), Archbishop of America (1922–1930)\n* Athenagoras, Archbishop of America (1931–1948)\n* Timotheos, Archbishop of America (Elected in 1949)\n* Michael, Archbishop of America (1949–1958)\n* Iakovos, Archbishop of America (1959–1996)\n* Spyridon, Archbishop of America (1996–1999)\n* Demetrios, Archbishop of America (1999 to present)\n\n----\n\nThe 'Diocese of the Aleutians and North America' was a pan-ethnic and missionary\njurisdiction of the Eastern Orthodox Church under the Russian Orthodox Church\nfrom 1900 to 1922. (Before this period it was known as the \"Diocese of the\nAleutians and Alaska\" from 1870 to 1900; before that, it was part of the Diocese\nof Kamchatka, Russia, from 1840 to 1870, and before that, of the Diocese of\nIrkutsk, Russia. From the 1920s until 1970 it was the \"Metropolia of All America\nand Canada\" [a/k/a the \"Russian Orthodox Greek Catholic Church in America\"], and\nsince 1970 it has also been known as \"The Orthodox Church in America,\" covering\nthe United States, Canada, Mexico, and two parishes in Australia.) From 1905 to\n1922, its [http://oca.org/HSprimates.asp?SID=7 incumbents] held the title of\n'Archbishop':\n\n* Saint Tikhon, Bishop of the Aleutians and Alaska, 1898-1900, Bishop of the\n  Aleutians and North America, 1900-1905, Archbishop of the Aleutians and North\n  America, 1905-1907.\n* Platon, Archbishop of the Aleutians and North America, 1907-1914.\n* Evdokim, Archbishop of the Aleutians and North America, 1914-1918.\n* Alexander (Nemolovsky), Archbishop of the Aleutians and North America,\n  1919-1922.\n\nSince 1922 its incumbents and primates have held the title of Metropolitan of\nAll America and Canada. Today it is majority-Russian in ecclesiastical heritage,\nbut with significant Romanian, Albanian, Bulgarian, and Mexican (in Mexico)\njurisdictions and at least one Arab parish - all largely English- (or Spanish-\n)speaking - as well as increasing numbers of transfers from other Orthodox\njurisdictions, and converts to Orthodoxy.\n\n----\n\nThe '[http://orthodoxwiki.org/Russian_Exarchate_of_North_America Russian\nExarchate of North America]' was another jurisdiction of the Russian Orthodox\nChurch under its Patriarchate of Moscow from 1933 to 1970. While most of its\nbishops were titled Metropolitans of varying Sees, the final one was\n\n* Jonathan, Archbishop of New York and the Aleutians, 1967-1970.\n\nMoscow was permitted to replace this Exarchate, and a diocese in Canada, with a\nnon-diocesan patriarchal vicariate in each country, the United States and\nCanada, when it and the Metropolia were reconciled, and Moscow recognized the\nMetropolia's autocephaly, in 1970. These vicariates, the\n\"[http://orthodoxwiki.org/Russian_Orthodox_Church_in_the_USA Russian Orthodox\nChurch in the USA]\" and in [http://www.orthodoxcanada.net Canada], are commonly\nreferred to as the \"Patriarchal
