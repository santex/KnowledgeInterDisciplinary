Retrieved 2010-7-\n15. is a transitional stage of physical and psychological human\ndevelopment generally occurring during the period from puberty to legal\nadulthood (age of majority). The period of adolescence is most closely associated\nwith the teenage years, although its\nphysical, psychological and cultural expressions can begin earlier and end\nlater. For example, although puberty has been historically associated with the\nonset of adolescent development, it now typically begins prior to the teenage\nyears and there has been a normative shift of it occurring in preadolescence,\nparticularly in females (see early and precocious puberty). Physical growth, as distinct from puberty (particularly in\nmales), and cognitive development generally seen in adolescence, can also extend\ninto the early twenties. Thus chronological age provides only a rough marker of\nadolescence, and scholars have found it difficult to agree upon a precise\ndefinition of adolescence. {{cite\nweb|first=Elizabeth|last=Cooney |title=Puberty gap: Obesity splits boys, girls.\nAdolescent males at top of the BMI chart may be delayed |publisher=MSNBC|date=2010-02-11|accessdate=2010-05-\n22|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/35332881/ns/health-\nkids_and_parenting/}} A thorough understanding of adolescence in society\ndepends on information from various perspectives, most importantly from the\nareas of psychology, biology, history, sociology, education, and anthropology.\nWithin all of these perspectives, adolescence is viewed as a transitional period\nbetween childhood and adulthood whose cultural purpose is the preparation of\nchildren for adult roles. Larson, R., & Wilson, S. (2004). Adolescence\nacross place and time: Globalization and the changing pathways to adulthood. In\nR. Lerner and L. Steinberg Handbook of adolescent psychology. New York:\nWiley\n\nThe end of adolescence and the beginning of adulthood varies by country and by\nfunction, and furthermore even within a single nation state or culture there can\nbe different ages at which an individual is considered to be (chronologically\nand legally) mature enough to be entrusted by society with certain\nresponsibilities. Such s include, but are not limited to, driving a vehicle,\nhaving legal sexual relations, serving in the armed forces or on a jury,\npurchasing and drinking alcohol, voting, entering into contracts, finishing\ncertain levels of education, and marriage. Adolescence is usually accompanied by\nan increased independence allowed by the parents or legal guardians and less\nsupervision as compared to preadolescence.\n\nIn popular culture, many adolescent characteristics are attributed to physical\nchanges and what is called raging hormones. There is little evidence\nthat this is the case, however. In studying adolescent development,\nadolescence can be defined biologically, as the physical transition marked by\nthe onset of puberty and the termination of physical growth; cognitively, as\nchanges in the ability to think abstractly and multi-dimensionally; or socially,\nas a period of preparation for adult roles. Major pubertal and biological\nchanges include changes to the sex organs, height, weight, and muscle mass, as\nwell as major changes in brain structure and organization. Cognitive advances\nencompass both increases in knowledge and in the ability to think abstractly and\nto reason more effectively. The study of adolescent development often involves\ninterdisciplinary collaborations. For example, researchers in neuroscience or\nbio-behavioral health might focus on pubertal changes in brain structure and its\neffects on cognition or social relations. Sociologists interested in adolescence\nmight focus on the acquisition of social roles (e.g., worker or romantic\npartner) and how this varies across cultures or social conditions. CÃ´tÃ©, J.\nE.
