It is developed\nby the Xiph.Org Foundation and distributed without licensing fees alongside\ntheir other free and open media projects, including the Vorbis audio format and\nthe Ogg container.\n\n'libtheora' is a reference implementation of the Theora video compression format\nbeing developed by the Xiph.Org Foundation.\n\nTheora is derived from the proprietary VP3 codec, released into the public\ndomain by On2 Technologies. It is broadly comparable in design and bitrate\nefficiency to MPEG-4 Part 2, early versions of Windows Media Video, and\nRealVideo while lacking some of the features present in some of these other\ncodecs. It is comparable in open standards philosophy to the BBC's Dirac codec.\n\nTheora is named after Theora Jones, Edison Carter's Controller on the [[Max\nHeadroom (TV series)|Max Headroom]] television program. {{cite web\n  | publisher = Xiph.Org Foundation | title = Theora FAQ url =\n  | http://theora.org/faq/#15 | accessdate =6 August 2009\n}}\n","linknr":861,"url":"Theora","recorded":1362579175,"links":63,"instances":["software_engineering","digital","computing","codec","media_player","programming_language","software","web_browser","web_browser","software","web_browser","programming_language","kde","data_storage","web_browser"],"pdf":["http://www.theora.org/doc/Theora.pdf","http://theora.org/doc/Theora.pdf","http://theora.org/doc/Theora.pdf","http://theora.org/doc/Theora.pdf","http://theora.org/doc/Theora.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20040928224506/http://www.theora.org/doc/Theora_I_spec.pdf","http://www.theora.org/doc/Theora_I_spec.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20040928224506/http://www.theora.org/doc/Theora_I_spec.pdf"],"categories":["Video codecs","Xiph.Org projects","Free codecs"],"headings":["Technical details","History","Performance","Playback","Encoding","Editing","Streaming","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/5c/Theorafish.svg/200px-Theorafish.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c1/Computer-aj_aj_ashton_01.svg/28px-Computer-aj_aj_ashton_01.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["c","programming_language"],["reference_implementation","computing"],["reference_implementation","computing"],["dirac","codec"],["block","data_storage"],["container_format","digital"],["freeze","software_engineering"],["chromium","web_browser"],["opera","web_browser"],["web","web_browser"],["midori","web_browser"],["cortado","software"],["java","programming_language"],["totem","media_player"],["songbird","software"],["phonon","kde"],["songbird","software"],["totem","media_player"],["java","programming_language"],["dirac","codec"]],"members":["freeze","container_format","reference_implementation","dirac","totem","java","cortado","midori","opera","songbird","web","c","phonon","block","chromium"],"related":["Xiph.org","Ogg","Matroska","VP3","Xiph.org","C_(programming_language)","Unix-like","GNU/Linux","Mac_OS_X","Microsoft_Windows","Video_codec","Reference_implementation_(computing)","BSD_licenses","Free_file_format","Lossy_compression","Video_compression_format","Xiph.Org_Foundation","Vorbis","Ogg","Reference_implementation_(computing)","Proprietary_software","VP3","Public_domain","On2_Technologies","MPEG-4_Part_2","Windows_Media_Video","RealVideo","BBC","Dirac_(codec)","Theora_Jones","Edison_Carter","Variable_bitrate","Discrete_cosine_transform","Chroma_subsampling","Block_(data_storage)","Macroblocks","B-frame","H.264","VC-1","Interlacing","Container_format_(digital)","Ogg","Vorbis","FLAC","Matroska","Proprietary_software","Video_codec","On2_Technologies","Source_code","GNU_Lesser_General_Public_License","Royalty-free","Bitstream_format","Polikarpov_I-15","Freeze_(software_engineering)","Two-pass_encoding","Open_source","Wikipedia","Use_of_Ogg_formats_in_HTML5","Doom9","Doom9","OSNews","YouTube","H.263+","Chris_DiBona","Google","PSNR","Discrete_cosine_transform","FFmpeg","H.264/MPEG-4_AVC","Open_source","VHDL","Google","Summer_of_Code","Nios_II","LEON","Portable_media_player","Smartphones","HTML_5","Mozilla_Firefox_3.5","Firefox_for_mobile","Google_Chrome","Chromium_(web_browser)","SeaMonkey","Konqueror","Opera_(web_browser)","Web_(web_browser)","GStreamer","Midori_(web_browser)","Annodex","Cortado_(software)","Java_(programming_language)","Applet","Itheora","VLC_media_player","DirectShow","GStreamer","Totem_(media_player)","Songbird_(software)","Phonon_(KDE)","QuickTime","Silverlight","Silverlight","FFmpeg","Helix_project","Miro_Media_Player","Democracy_Player","MPlayer","Songbird_(software)","Totem_(media_player)","Moovida","GStreamer","VLC_media_player","Xine","Kaffeine","Dragon_player","Firefox","FFmpeg","VLC_media_player","OggConvert","FreeJ","Kdenlive","KDE","PiTiVi","GNOME","LiVES","Thoggen","GStreamer","HandBrake","Matroska","Recordmydesktop","Xiph.Org_Foundation","BSD_licenses","Ffdshow","Video_for_Windows","GStreamer","LiVES","Kdenlive","KDE","OpenShot_Video_Editor","PiTiVi","GNOME","Cinelerra","Concurrent_Versions_System","Cinelerra","Non-linear_editing_system","AVS_Video_Editor","VLC_media_player","Icecast","FreeCast","Java_(programming_language)","LiVES","Flumotion","Icecast","Dirac_(codec)","Video_editing_software","Comparison_of_video_codecs","Comparison_of_video_encoders"]}
