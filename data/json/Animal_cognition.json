{"cursor":"58712","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"''', a female chimpanzee who was the first non-human to learn to communicate\nusing American Sign Language, as part of a research experiment on animal\nlanguage acquisition.]]\n\n'ANIMAL COGNITION' is the study of the mental capacities of non-human animals.\nIt has developed out of comparative psychology, including the study of animal\nconditioning and learning, but has also been strongly influenced by research in\nethology, behavioral ecology, and evolutionary psychology. The alternative name\ncognitive ethology is therefore sometimes used; much of what used to be\nconsidered under the title of animal intelligence is now thought of under this\nheading. Shettleworth, S. J. (2010) Cognition, Evolution and\nBehavior (2nd ed) New York: Oxford.\n\nResearch in animal cognition mostly concerns mammals, especially primates,\ncetaceans, and elephants, as well as dogs, cats, raccoons and rodents. However,\nresearch also extends to non-mammalian vertebrates such as birds including\nparrots, corvids, and pigeons, as well as to reptiles such as lizards and\nsnakes, and to fish, even to invertebrates such as cephalopods, spiders, and\ninsects.\n","linknr":907,"url":"Animal_cognition","recorded":1362373698,"links":58,"instances":["journal","parrot","chimpanzee","bird","journal"],"pdf":["http://www.sciencemag.org/content/298/5598/1610.full.pdf","http://www.sciencemag.org/content/298/5598/1610.full.pdf","http://biology.plosjournals.org/archive/1545-7885/6/8/pdf/10.1371_journal.pbio.0060202-L.pdf","http://biology.plosjournals.org/archive/1545-7885/6/8/pdf/10.1371_journal.pbio.0060202-L.pdf","http://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/features/com-124-4-356.pdf","http://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/features/com-124-4-356.pdf","http://fcmconference.org/img/CambridgeDeclarationOnConsciousness.pdf","http://fcmconference.org/img/CambridgeDeclarationOnConsciousness.pdf","http://www.columbia.edu/cu/psychology/primatecognitionlab/References/BrannonTerrace2000.pdf"],"categories":["Zoology","Animal
