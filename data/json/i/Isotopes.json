The fact that each isotope has one proton makes them all variants of hydrogen:\n  the identity of the isotope is given by the number of neutrons. From left to\n  right, the isotopes are protium ( 1H) with zero neutrons, deuterium\n  ( 2H) with one neutron, and tritium ( 3H) with two\n  neutrons.]]\n\n'Isotopes' are variants of a particular chemical element: while all isotopes of\na given element share the same number of protons, each isotope differs from the\nothers in its number of neutrons. The term isotope is formed from the Greek\nroots isos (á¼´ÏÎ¿Ï \"equal\") and topos (ÏÏÏÎ¿Ï \"place\"). Hence: \"the same place,\"\nmeaning that different isotopes of a single element occupy the same position on\nthe periodic table. The number of protons within the atom's nucleus uniquely\nidentifies an element, but a given element may in principle have any number of\nneutrons. The number of nucleons (protons and neutrons) in the nucleus is the\nmass number, and each isotope of a given element has a different mass number.\n\nFor example, carbon-12, carbon-13 and carbon-14 are three isotopes of the\nelement carbon with mass numbers 12, 13 and 14 respectively. The atomic number\nof carbon is 6 which means that every carbon atom has 6 protons, so that the\nneutron numbers of these isotopes are 6, 7 and 8 respectively.\n","linknr":791,"url":"Isotopes","recorded":1362375182,"links":105,"instances":["physics","complete","mathematics","nuclide","doctor","mass_spectrometry","atomic_structure"],"pdf":["http://old.iupac.org/publications/books/rbook/Red_Book_2005.pdf","http://pac.iupac.org/publications/pac/pdf/1971/pdf/2801x0001.pdf"],"categories":["Isotopes|","Nuclear
