This definition requires a notion\nof \"proof\". Gödel in his 1931 defines the notion this way: \"The class of\nprovable formulas is defined to be the smallest class of formulas that contains\nthe axioms and is closed under the relation \"immediate consequence\", i.e.\nformula c of a and b is defined as an immediate consequence in terms of modus\nponens or substitution; cf Gödel 1931 van Heijenoort 1967:601. Tarski defines\n\"proof\" informally as \"statements follow one another in a definite order\naccording to certain principles . . . and accompanied by considerations intended\nto establish their validity[true conclusion for all true premises -- Reichenbach\n1947:68]\" cf Tarski 1946:3. Kleene 1952 defines the notion with respect to\neither an induction or as to paraphrase) a finite sequence of formulas such that\neach formula in the sequence is either an axiom or an \"immediate consequence\" of\nthe preceding formulas; \"A proof is said to be a proofofits last formula, and\nthis formula is said to be(formally) provableor be a(formal) theorem\" cf Kleene\n1952:83.</ref> The lack of contradiction can be defined in either semantic or\nsyntactic terms. The semantic definition states that a theory is consistent if\nand only if it has a model, i.e. there exists an interpretation under which all\nformulas in the theory are true. This is the sense used in traditional\nAristotelian logic, although in contemporary mathematical logic the term\n'satisfiable' is used instead. The syntactic definition states that a theory is\nconsistent if and only if there is no formula P such that both P and its\nnegation are provable from the axioms of the theory under its associated\ndeductive system.\n\nIf these semantic and syntactic definitions are equivalent for a particular\nlogic, the logic is '[[Completeness#Logical completeness|complete]]'. The\ncompleteness of sentential calculus was proved by Paul Bernays in 1918<ref>van\nHeijenoort 1967:265 states that Bernays determined the independence of the\naxioms of Principia Mathematica, a result not published until 1926, but he says\nnothing about Bernays proving their consistency.</ref> and Emil Post in\n1921,<ref>Post proves both consistency and completeness of the propositional\ncalculus of PM, cf van Heijenoort's commentary and Post's 1931 Introduction to a\ngeneral theory of elementary propositons in van Heijenoort 1967:264ff. Also\nTarski 1946:134ff.</ref> while the completeness of predicate calculus was proved\nby Kurt Gödel in 1930,<ref>cf van Heijenoort's commentary and Gödel's 1930 The\ncompleteness of the axioms of the functional calculus of logic in van Heijenoort\n1967:582ff</ref> and consistency proofs for arithmetics restricted with respect\nto the induction axiom schema were proved by Ackermann (1924), von Neumann\n(1927) and Herbrand (1931).<ref>cf van Heijenoort's commentary and Herbrand's\n1930 On the consistency of arithmetic in van Heijenoort 1967:618ff.</ref>\nStronger logics, such as second-order logic, are not complete.\n\nA 'consistency proof' is a mathematical proof that a particular theory is\nconsistent. The early development of mathematical proof theory was driven by the\ndesire to provide finitary consistency proofs for all of mathematics as part of\nHilbert's program. Hilbert's program was strongly impacted by incompleteness\ntheorems, which showed that sufficiently strong proof theories cannot prove\ntheir own consistency (provided that they are in fact consistent).\n\nAlthough consistency can be proved by means of model theory, it is often done in\na purely syntactical way, without any need to reference some model of the logic.\nThe cut-elimination (or equivalently the normalization of the underlying\ncalculus if there is one) implies the consistency of the calculus: since there\nis obviously no cut-free proof of falsity, there is no contradiction in general.\n","title":"Consistency","headings":["Consistency and completeness in arithmetic and set theory","First-order logic","See also","Footnotes","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["3: If_and_only_if","2: GÃ¶del's_incompleteness_theorems","2: Peano_arithmetic","2: Presburger_arithmetic","1: Logic","1: Contradiction","1: Model_theory#First-order_logic","1: Well-formed_formula","1: Term_logic","1: Sentential_calculus","1: Paul_Bernays","1: Emil_Post","1: Predicate_calculus","1: Kurt_GÃ¶del","1: Mathematical_induction","1: Second-order_logic","1: Mathematical_proof","1: Proof_theory","1: Hilbert's_program","1: Cut-elimination","1: Normalization_property","1: Curry-Howard","1: Completeness","1: Primitive_recursive_arithmetic","1: ZermeloâFraenkel_set_theory","1: Axiom","1: Formulas","1: Negation","1: First-order_logic","1: Equivalence_relation","1: Equiconsistency","1: Hilbert's_problems","1: Hilbert's_second_problem","1: Jan_Åukasiewicz","1: Paraconsistent_logic","1: Î©-consistency","1: Stephen_Kleene","1: Hans_Reichenbach","1: Alfred_Tarski","1: Jean_van_Heijenoort","1: The_Cambridge_Dictionary_of_Philosophy","1: Stanford_Encyclopedia_of_Philosophy"]}
