It\nis a member of the Committee for a Workers' International (CWI).\n\nThe party was founded in by 1972 as a tendency within the Labour Party, grouped\naround the newsletter Militant Irish Monthly, http://www.irishleftreview.org/2009/11/07/john-throne-irish-\nmilitant and duly became known as the Militant tendency, the name by which\nits co-thinkers in the British Labour Party were also known. Militant organised\nwithin the Labour Party throughout the 1970s and 1980s as an entryist group\nattempting to win the party to socialism. The group briefly controlled Labour\nYouth from 1983 to 1986. People associated with Militant included John Throne,\nClare Daly, Dermot Connolly, Joe Higgins and Finn Geaney.\n\nIn the late 1980s, a number of known members of the Militant tendency were\nexpelled from Labour. Considering work in the party to no longer be viable, in\n1989 the organisation took an \"Open Turn\" and established an independent party,\nadopting the name Militant Labour, also used by other sections of the Committee\nfor a Workers' International at the time. In 1996 the party merged fully with\nthe Labour and Trade Union Group of Northern Ireland and changed its name to the\nSocialist Party.\n\nThe party is currently represented by 1 TD, 1 MEP and 6 councillors.\n","linknr":443,"url":"Irish_Militant_Tendency","recorded":1362675199,"links":31,"instances":["european_parliament_constituency","ireland","england_and_wales","politics","ireland","ireland","ireland","dáil_éireann_constituency","ireland","uk","irish_socialist_party","city","magazine","irish_politician"],"pdf":["http://www.thephoenix.ie/phoenix/subscriber/library/volume-29/issue-21/contents.pdf","http://www.thephoenix.ie/phoenix/subscriber/library/volume-29/issue-21/contents.pdf"],"categories":["All-Ireland
