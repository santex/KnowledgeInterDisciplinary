Harmonisation\nwould lead to a more economical use of human, animal and material resources, and\nthe elimination of unnecessary delay in the global development and availability\nof new medicines while maintaining safeguards on quality, safety, and efficacy,\nand regulatory obligations to protect public health.\n\nICH guidelines have been adopted as law in several countries, but are only used\nas guidance for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\n","linknr":159,"url":"International_Conference_on_Harmonisation_of_Technical_Requirements_for_Registration_of_Pharmaceuticals_for_Human_Use","recorded":1362505326,"links":17,"instances":["japan"],"pdf":["http://www.ikev.org/haber/stabilite/kitap/41%201.13%20%20Stability%20Workshop%20ICH%20M4,%20ICH%20M4Q%20C%20.pdf","http://apps.who.int/medicinedocs/pdf/s2292e/s2292e.pdf"],"categories":["Clinical research","Pharmaceuticals policy","Drug safety"],"headings":["History","Structure","Process","See also","Notes","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["ministry_of_health,_labour_and_welfare","japan"]],"members":[],"related":["Europe","Japan","United_States","Pharmaceutical_industry","U.S._Food_and_Drug_Administration","European_Union","Brussels","European_Commission","European_Federation_of_Pharmaceutical_Industries_and_Associations","Ministry_of_Health,_Labour_and_Welfare_(Japan)","Japan_Pharmaceutical_Manufacturers_Association","Food_and_Drug_Administration","Pharmaceutical_Research_and_Manufacturers_of_America","Steering_committee","Rapporteur","Expert_Working_Group","Guideline","Committee_for_Medicinal_Products_for_Human_Use","Committee_for_Medicinal_Products_for_Veterinary_Use","MHLW","Federal_Register","IFPMA","WHO","Step_4_Experts_Document","ICH_Harmonised_Tripartite_Guideline","European_Union","Australia_New_Zealand_Therapeutic_Products_Authority","India","CIOMS_Guidelines","Clinical_trial","Common_Technical_Document","Council_for_International_Organizations_of_Medical_Sciences","World_Health_Organization","Health_Canada","Health_Sciences_Authority","IFPMA","International_Pharmaceutical_Federation","Good_clinical_practice","Malaysia","National_pharmaceuticals_policy","Pharmaceutical_policy","Pharmacopoeia","Regulation_of_therapeutic_goods","State_Food_and_Drug_Administration","Uppsala_Monitoring_Centre"]}
