The term was coined by the German psychologist and theoretical\nlinguist Karl Bühler. It is also known as an epiphany.\n","title":"insight","headings":["Psychology","Psychiatry","Religion","Marketing","See also","References","Further reading"]},"micro-relation":["2: Causality","2: Introspection","1: Noesis","1: Deductive_reasoning","1: Discernment","1: Perception","1: Artificial_intelligence","1: German_language","1: Karl_Bühler","1: Gestalt_psychology","1: Associationism","1: Functional_fixedness","1: Remote_Associates_Test","1: Fluency","1: Fluid_and_crystallized_intelligence","1: Sleep","1: Rebus","1: Metacognition","1: Primate_cognition","1: Wolfgang_Köhler","1: Tenerife","1: Psychology","1: Psychiatry","1: Mental_illness","1: Anosognosia","1: Obsessive_compulsive_disorder","1: Phobias","1: Alzheimer's_disease","1: Schizophrenia","1: Psychotic","1: Problem_solving","1: Insight_phenomenology","1: Cause","1: Mind","1: Scientific_method","1: List_of_fallacies","1: Pali","1: Mindfulness","1: Consumer","1: Consumer_behavior","1: Brand","1: Marketing","1: Human_self-reflection","1: Psychological_mindedness","1: Self_awareness","1: Bernard_Longergan","1: Oxford_University_Press"]}
