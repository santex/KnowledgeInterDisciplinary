An IDE normally consists of a source code editor, build automation\ntools and a debugger.\n\nSome IDEs contain a compiler, interpreter, or both, such as Microsoft Visual\nStudio and Eclipse; others do not, such as SharpDevelop and Lazarus. The\nboundary between an integrated development environment and other parts of the\nbroader software development environment is not well-defined. Sometimes a\nversion control system and various tools are integrated to simplify the\nconstruction of a GUI. Many modern IDEs also have a class browser, an object\ninspector, and a class hierarchy diagram, for use with object-oriented software\ndevelopment.\n","linknr":400,"url":"Integrated_development_environment","recorded":1362477422,"links":57,"instances":["programming_language","software","text_editor","computing","computing","programming_language","software","programming_language","software","programming_language","computing","programming_language","programming_language","ide"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Integrated development environments|*"],"headings":["Overview","History","Topics","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e6/Anjuta-2.0.0-2.png/300px-Anjuta-2.0.0-2.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5a/Emacs-screenshot.png/220px-Emacs-screenshot.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1d/8bit-dynamiclist.gif/28px-8bit-dynamiclist.gif","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["interpreter","computing"],["eclipse","software"],["lazarus","ide"],["make","software"],["eclipse","software"],["max","software"],["eclipse","software"],["java","programming_language"],["c_sharp","programming_language"],["plug-in","computing"],["eclipse","software"],["c","programming_language"],["ada","programming_language"],["python","programming_language"],["ruby","programming_language"],["vim","text_editor"],["make","software"],["eclipse","software"],["linker","computing"]],"members":["python","make","vim","interpreter","java","max","ruby","eclipse","c","linker","ada","c_sharp","lazarus"],"related":["Software_application","Computer_programmer","Software_development","Source_code_editor","Build_automation","Debugger","Compiler","Interpreter_(computing)","Microsoft_Visual_Studio","Eclipse_(software)","SharpDevelop","Lazarus_(IDE)","Version_control_system","GUI","Class_browser","Object_inspector","Class_hierarchy","Diagram","Object-oriented_programming","User_interface","Vi","GNU_Compiler_Collection","Make_(software)","Programming_language","Programming_paradigm","Eclipse_(software)","ActiveState_Komodo","IntelliJ_IDEA","Oracle_JDeveloper","NetBeans","Microsoft_Visual_Studio","Genuitec","MyEclipse","WinDev","Xcode","Turbo_Pascal","Microsoft_Windows","X_Window_System","Keyboard_shortcut","Unix-like","System_console","Computer_terminal","Punched_card","Compiler","Dartmouth_BASIC","Dartmouth_Time_Sharing_System","Maestro_I","German_language","Maestro_I","West_Germany","Softbench","Visual_programming","Unified_Modeling_Language","Lego_Mindstorms","Mozilla","KTechlab","Distributed_programming","LabVIEW","EICASLAB","Max_(software)","Synthesizer","Prograph","Dataflow_programming","Macintosh","Qfix_robot_kits","Openlab","Eclipse_(software)","IntelliJ_IDEA","MyEclipse","NetBeans","Java_(programming_language)","MonoDevelop","C_Sharp_(programming_language)","Plug-in_(computing)","Eclipse_(software)","Netbeans","C_(programming_language)","C++","Ada_(programming_language)","GNAT","AdaGIDE","Perl","Python_(programming_language)","Ruby_(programming_language)","PHP","Unix","Command-line","POSIX","Linux","GNU","GNU_Compiler_Collection","GNU_Debugger","GNU_make","Command-line","Emacs","Vim_(text_editor)","Data_Display_Debugger","Debugger","Makefile","PostgreSQL","Makefile","GNU_Debugger","Microsoft_Windows","Visual_C++","Perl","Makefile","Microsoft_Windows","Microsoft","Visual_C++","Platform_SDK",".NET_Framework","Nmake","Embarcadero_Technologies","Bcc32","Make_(software)","Mac_OS","Macintosh_Programmer's_Workshop","Turbo_Pascal","THINK_C","Xcode","CodeWarrior","MyEclipse","Eclipse_(software)","Netbeans","ActiveState_Komodo","Cloud_computing","Cloud9_IDE","WIDE","Comparison_of_integrated_development_environments","Computer-aided_software_engineering","List_of_software_engineering_topics","Rapid_application_development","Read–eval–print_loop","Software_development_kit","Software_engineering","Utility_program","GNAVI","Compiler","Linker_(computing)","Build_automation","Revision_control","Bug_tracking_system"]}
