The purple\n spheres are sodium cations, Na +, and the green spheres are chloride\n anions, Cl â .]] In chemistry, an 'ionic compound' is a chemical\n compound in which ions are held together in a lattice structure by ionic bonds.\n Usually, the positively charged portion consists of metal cations and the\n negatively charged portion is an anion or polyatomic ion. Ions in ionic\n compounds are held together by the electrostatic forces between oppositely\n charged bodies. Ionic compounds have high melting and boiling points, and they\n are hard and very brittle.\n\nIons can be single atoms, as the sodium and chlorine in common table salt sodium\nchloride, or more complex groups such as the carbonate in calcium carbonate. But\nto be considered an ion, they must carry a positive or negative charge. Thus, in\nan ionic bond, one 'bonder' must have a positive charge and the other a negative\none. By sticking to each other, they resolve, or partially resolve, their\nseparate charge imbalances. Positive to positive and negative to negative ionic\nbonds do not occur. (For an easily visible analogy, experiment with a pair of\nbar magnets.)NaCl=salt\n\nChemical compounds are never strictly ionic. Even the most\nelectronegative/electropositive pairs such as caesium fluoride exhibit a degree\nof covalency. Similarly, covalent compounds often exhibit charge separations.\nSee also HSAB theory.\n\nhamalwa\n","linknr":162,"url":"Ionic_compound","recorded":1362482294,"links":26,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://web.gccaz.edu/~jserin/chm230ll/public.www/Organic-Inorganic.pdf","http://web.gccaz.edu/~jserin/chm230ll/public.www/Organic-Inorganic.pdf"],"categories":["Chemical compounds","Ions"],"headings":["Characteristics","Solubility","Electrical conductivity","Name","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e9/Sodium-chloride-3D-ionic.png/200px-Sodium-chloride-3D-ionic.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Sodium_chloride","Sodium","Cation","Chloride","Anion","Chemistry","Chemical_compound","Ion","Ionic_bond","Cation","Anion","Electrostatic_force","Sodium","Chlorine","Sodium_chloride","Carbonate","Calcium_carbonate","Magnet","Electronegative","Electropositive","Caesium_fluoride","Covalent_bond","HSAB_theory","Electrostatic_bond","Aqueous_solution","Inorganic_compound","Organic_compounds","Organic_compounds","Polar_solvent","Ionic_liquid","Alcohol","Acetone","Dimethyl_sulfoxide","Nonpolar_solvent","Diethyl_ether","Petrol","Gasoline","IUPAC","Stock_nomenclature","Oxidation_number","IUPAC_nomenclature","Bonding_in_solids","Solubility"]}
