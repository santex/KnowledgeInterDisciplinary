Prior to the 1890s, the Bill of Rights was held only to\napply to the federal government. Under the 'incorporation doctrine', most\nprovisions of the Bill of Rights now also apply to the state and local\ngovernments, by virtue of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of\nthe Constitution.\n\nPrior to the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment and the development of the\nincorporation doctrine, the Supreme Court in 1833 held in [[Barron v.\nBaltimore]] that the Bill of Rights applied only to the federal, but not any\nstate governments. Even years after the ratification of the Fourteenth\nAmendment, the Supreme Court in [[United States v. Cruikshank]] still held that\nthe First and Second Amendment did not apply to state governments. However,\nbeginning in the 1920s, a series of United States Supreme Court decisions\ninterpreted the Fourteenth Amendment to \"incorporate\" most portions of the Bill\nof Rights, making these portions, for the first time, enforceable against the\nstate governments.\n","linknr":539,"url":"Incorporation_of_the_Bill_of_Rights","recorded":1362674967,"links":18,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://law.unl.edu/sites/unl.edu.college-of-law.law/files/facstaff/faculty/resident/docs/Thomas_ArticleDuncan2010.pdf"],"categories":["United States constitutional law","Legal history of the United States","Incorporation case law|*"],"headings":["History","Specific amendments","Reverse incorporation","References","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/Great_Seal_of_the_United_States_%28obverse%29.svg/125px-Great_Seal_of_the_United_States_%28obverse%29.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["United_States_Bill_of_Rights","U.S._state","Federal_government_of_the_United_States","Due_Process_Clause","Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution","First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution","Second_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution","Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States","Chicago,_B._&_Q._R._Co._v._Chicago","Fifth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution","Fifth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution","Grand_jury","Seventh_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution","Jury_trial","Engblom_v._Carey","John_Bingham","U.S._Supreme_Court","Hugo_Black","Civil_rights","Associate_Justice_of_the_Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States","Hugo_Black","Unenumerated_rights","Ninth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution","Felix_Frankfurter","William_Henry_Moody","Due_process","Benjamin_Cardozo","Double_jeopardy","Privileges_or_Immunities_Clause","Adamson_v._California","Hugo_Black","Obiter_dictum","Second_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution","Clarence_Thomas","Earl_Warren","Ninth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution","Tenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution","Clarence_Thomas","Elk_Grove_Unified_School_District_v._Newdow","United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Second_Circuit","United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Second_Circuit","Connecticut","New_York","Vermont","United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Tenth_Circuit","Exclusionary_rule","Chicago,_B._&_Q._R._Co._v._Chicago","Equal_Protection_Clause"]}
