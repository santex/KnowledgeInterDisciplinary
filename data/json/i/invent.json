It\nmay be an improvement upon a machine or product, or a new process for creating\nan object or a result. An invention that achieves a completely unique function\nor result may be a radical breakthrough. Such works are novel and not obvious to\nothers skilled in the same field.\n\nSome inventions can be patented. A Patent legally protects the intellectual\nproperty rights of the inventor and legally recognizes that a claimed invention\nis actually an invention. The rules and requirements for patenting an invention\nvary from country to country, and the process of obtaining a patent is often\nexpensive.\n\nAnother meaning of invention is '[[cultural invention]]', which is an innovative\nset of useful social behaviours adopted by people and passed on to\nothers.<ref>Artificial Mythologies: A Guide to Cultural Invention by Craig J.\nSaper (1997); Review of Artificial Mythologies. A Guide to cultural Invention,\nKirsten Ostherr (1998)\nhttp://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3709/is_199810/ai_n8821092</ref> The\nInstitute for Social Inventions collected many such ideas in magazines and\nbooks.<ref>Nicholas Albery, Matthew Mezey, Mary McHugh and Marie Papworth\n(editors). \"Best Ideas: A Compendium of Socioal Inventions\". The Institute for\nSocial Inventions, London, 1995.</ref> Invention is also an important component\nof artistic and design creativity. Inventions often extend the boundaries of\nhuman knowledge, experience or capability.\n","title":"Invention","headings":["The Process of Invention","Invention as defined by patent law","Invention in the Arts","See also","References","Further reading","External links"]},"micro-relation":["3: Patent","2: Inventive_step_and_non-obviousness","2: Inventor's_notebook","2: Creative_process","2: Externality","2: Cubism","1: Machine","1: Person_skilled_in_the_art","1: Innovative","1: Social_behaviour","1: Institute_for_Social_Inventions","1: Trial_and_error","1: Experiment","1: Brainstorming","1: Leonardo_da_Vinci","1: Thomas_Jefferson","1: Albert_Einstein","1: Parachute","1: Flight","1: Phonograph","1: List_of_Edison_patents","1: Carl_Jung","1: Thomas_Edison","1: Daydreaming","1: Harry_Potter","1: Meccano","1: Train","1: Eureka_effect","1: Polytetrafluoroethylene","1: Conductive_polymer","1: Organic_light-emitting_diode","1: OLED","1: Ecological","1: Aesthetic","1: Ergonomic","1: Business_incubator","1: Entrepreneurship","1: Economic_theory","1: Bratislava","1: Slovakia","1: Everett_Rogers","1: Gabriel_Tarde","1: The_arts","1: Patentable","1: Michelangelo","1: Art","1: Picasso","1: Braque","1: Computer_art","1: Photography","1: Architecture","1: Design","1: Collage","1: Readymade","1: Marcel_Duchamp","1: Alexander_Calder","1: Robert_Rauschenberg","1: Frank_Stella","1: Eadweard_Muybridge","1: Jackson_Pollock","1: Impressionist","1: Frederic_Auguste_Bartholdi","1: Design_patent","1: Statue_of_Liberty","1: Filippo_Brunelleschi","1: Le_Corbusier","1: Naum_Gabo","1: Charles_Eames","1: Louis_Comfort_Tiffany","1: John_La_Farge","1: Buckminster_Fuller","1: Walt_Disney","1: Man_Ray","1: Yves_Klein","1: Henry_N._Cobb","1: I._M._Pei","1: Kenneth_Snelson","1: John_Lennon","1: Chuck_Hoberman","1: Ingo_Maurer","1: Bayh-Dole_Act","1: Chindōgu","1: Creativity","1: Creativity_techniques","1: Diffusion_of_innovations","1: Edisonian_approach","1: Directive_on_the_patentability_of_biotechnological_inventions","1: Directive_on_the_patentability_of_computer-implemented_inventions","1: German_inventors_and_discoverers","1: Independent_inventor","1: Ingenuity","1: International_Innovation_Index","1: Invention_promotion_firm","1: Inventors'_Day","1: Kranzberg's_laws_of_technology","1: Lemelson-MIT_Prize","1: List_of_inventions_named_after_people","1: List_of_inventors","1: List_of_prolific_inventors","1: Mad_scientist","1: Mind's_eye","1: Multiple_discovery","1: National_Inventors_Hall_of_Fame","1: Patent_model","1: Proof_of_concept","1: The_heroic_theory_of_invention_and_scientific_development","1: Timeline_for_Invention_in_the_Arts","1: Timeline_of_historic_inventions","1: TRIZ","1: Isaac_Asimov","1: Edward_de_Bono","1: WIPO"]}
