Ion channels are present in the membranes of all cells.\nIon channels are considered to be one of the two traditional classes of\nionophoric proteins, with the other class known as ion transporters (including\nthe sodium-potassium pump, sodium-calcium exchanger, and sodium-glucose\ntransport proteins, amongst others).\n\nIon channels are often studied in the disciplines of biophysics and\nelectrophysiology, utilizing techniques including voltage clamp, patch clamp,\nimmunohistochemistry, and
