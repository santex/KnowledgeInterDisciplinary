{"cursor":"3264","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"An 'interference engine' is a type of 4-stroke internal combustion piston\nengine. Depending on the design of an engine, piston and valve paths may\n\"interfere\" with one another as a result of incorrect timing in their movements.\n(Such designs are also called \"interference head\" or \"non-freewheeling\", and\ninclude virtually all diesel engines. Conversely, non-interfering engines, such\nas the Mazda B engine or Fiat F.I.R.E. engine, are called \"free-wheeling\" or \"non-\ninterference\" engines.)\n\nIn many piston engines using poppet valves, the valves descend into the\ncombustion area at the top of the cylinder, while the pistons rise into this\narea from below. If the lowest point of a valve's descent is lower than the\nhighest point that the piston reaches, the engine is considered an interference\nengine. In normal operation, the relative timing of the valve and piston's\nmotion prevents them from colliding, but if the valve timing is altered through\nwear or improper adjustment, or if a timing belt breaks or one of the pulleys\nthe timing belt rides on fails, one or more valves may be placed in the path of\na piston.
