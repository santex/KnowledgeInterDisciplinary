{"cursor":"3667","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Ideal final result' (IFR) is a description of the best possible solution for\nthe problem situation (or contradiction), regardless of the resources or\nconstraints of the original problem. IFR is one of the basics terms in TRIZ, a\nproblem solving methodology.\n\nA well-defined IFR helps a problem solver to overcome psychological inertia and\nreach breakthrough solutions by thinking about the solution in terms of\nfunctions, not the intervening problems or needed resources. It focuses on\nfunctions needed, not the current process or equipment. It is therefore the\nantithesis to the more commonly used continuous improvement method which often\nleads to progressively diminishing returns (the classic s-curve). IFR represents\na significant shift in the thinking approach to solving problems.\n\nThe idea of formulating the IFR is to clearly define the goal of improvement and\nto work back from that point, thus eliminating rework by solving the right\nproblem initially.\n\nA basic concept of TRIZ is that systems evolve towards increased ideality\n(functionality), where the extreme result of this evolution is the 'ideal final\nresult' with\n* all the benefits,\n* none of the harm, and\n* none of the costs of the original problem.\n\nThe '[[ideal system]] [http://www.triz-journal.com/archives/2006/02/01.pdf]' is\nacting as pure [[function (mathematics)|function]], because it:\n* occupies no space,\n* has no weight,\n* requires no labor,\n* requires no maintenance,\n* delivers benefit without harm.\n\nGiven the IFR criteria above, it is likely that the IFR will be unrealisable.\nHowever it provides the starting point in a recursive process of taking very\nsmall steps back away from the ideal (IFR) until a realisable solution, at least\nin concept, can be described.\n\nThe ideal final result also is a step in ARIZ.\n","linknr":94,"url":"Ideal_Final_Result","recorded":1362567818,"links":12,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.triz-journal.com/archives/2006/02/01.pdf","http://www.triz-journal.com/archives/2005/11/09.pdf"],"categories":["Engineering","TRIZ"],"headings":["Applications","References","Further reading"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Contradiction","TRIZ","TRIZ","System","Space","Weight","Manual_labour","Maintenance,_repair_and_operations","Harm","ARIZ","Genrich_Altshuller","TRIZ","Creative_Pedagogy"]}
