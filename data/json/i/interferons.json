They allow for communication between cells to trigger the protective\ndefenses of the immune system that eradicate pathogens or tumors.\n\nIFNs belong to the large class of glycoproteins known as cytokines. Interferons\nare named after their ability to \"interfere\" with viral replication within host\ncells. IFNs have other functions: they activate immune cells, such as natural\nkiller cells and macrophages; they increase recognition of infection or tumor\ncells by up-regulating antigen presentation to T lymphocytes; and they increase\nthe ability of uninfected host cells to resist new infection by virus. Certain\nsymptoms, such as aching muscles and fever, are related to the production of\nIFNs during infection.\n\nAbout ten distinct IFNs have been identified in mammals; seven of these have\nbeen described for humans. They are typically divided among three IFN classes:\nType I IFN, Type II IFN, and Type III IFN. IFNs belonging to all IFN classes are\nvery important for fighting viral infections.\n","linknr":1079,"url":"interferons","recorded":1362574347,"links":71,"instances":["biology","united_states","biology"],"pdf":["http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v424/n6948/pdf/nature01850.pdf","http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v424/n6948/pdf/nature01850.pdf"],"categories":["Cytokines","Antivirals"],"headings":["Types of interferon","Function","Induction of interferons","Downstream signaling","Virus resistance to interferons","Interferon therapy","History","Human interferons","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/97/1RH2_Recombinant_Human_Interferon-Alpha_2b-01.png/220px-1RH2_Recombinant_Human_Interferon-Alpha_2b-01.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a9/Vials_of_Interferon_Image_3549-PH.jpg/200px-Vials_of_Interferon_Image_3549-PH.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["promoter","biology"],["food_and_drug_administration","united_states"],["homogenization","biology"]],"members":["homogenization","food_and_drug_administration","promoter"],"related":["Protein","Host_cells","Pathogen","Virus","Bacteria","Parasite","Tumor","Immune_system","Glycoproteins","Cytokine","Viral_replication","Natural_killer_cell","Macrophage","Antigen_presentation","T_lymphocyte","Interferon_type_I","IFN-α","Interferon-alpha/beta_receptor","IFNAR1","IFNAR2","IFN-α","IFN-β","Interferon_type_II","IFNGR","IFNGR1","IFNGR2","IFN-γ","Interferon_type_III","IFNLR1","Medical_Subject_Headings","Antiviral_protein","Tumor","Cytolysis","Enzyme","Protein_kinase_R","Phosphorylation","EIF-2","EIF2B","RNAse_L","P53","Apoptosis","MHC_I","MHC_II","Immunoproteasome","Cytotoxic_T_cell","Natural_killer_cells","Helper_T_cell","Interleukins","Interferon_gamma","Macrophage","Natural_killer_cell","Glycoprotein","RNA","Endotoxin","Flagella","CpG_ODN","Pattern_recognition_receptor","Toll_like_receptor","DDX58","IFIH1","TLR_3","Double-stranded_RNA_viruses","Ligand","DsRNA","IRF3","NF-κB","RNA_interference","Mitogen","Interleukin_1","Interleukin_2","Interleukin-12","Tumor_necrosis_factor-alpha","Colony-stimulating_factor","STAT_protein","Transcription_factor","Janus_kinase","JAK-STAT","Phosphorylation","STAT1","STAT2","ISGF3G","Cell_nucleus","Nucleotide","Promoter_(biology)","Gene","ISGs","Interferome","Protein_dimer","Adaptor_protein","CRKL","STAT5","RAPGEF1","Rap1","P70-S6_Kinase_1","Ribosomal_protein_s6","EIF4EBP1","Japanese_Encephalitis","Dengue_virus","Cytomegalovirus","Kaposi's_sarcoma-associated_herpesvirus","EBV_nuclear_antigen_1","EBV_nuclear_antigen_2","Epstein-Barr_virus","Large_T_antigen","Polyomavirus","Human_papillomavirus","Vaccinia_virus","STAT1","STAT2","ISGF3G","JAK-STAT","Poxvirus","Double-stranded_RNA","Protein_kinase","Reovirus","Protein_kinase_R","Flavivirus","H5N1","Influenza","Amino_acid","Imidazoquinoline","TLR7","Food_and_Drug_Administration_(United_States)","Actinic_keratosis","Basal_cell_carcinoma","Papilloma","Genital_warts","Antiseptic","Anticarcinogen","Opioid_growth_factor_receptor","SiRNA","Interferon_beta-1a","Interferon_beta-1b","Multiple_sclerosis","Autoimmune_disorder","Hematological_malignancy","Hairy_cell_leukemia","Chronic_myeloid_leukemia","Cutaneous_T-cell_lymphoma","Hepatitis_B","Hepatitis_C","Biopsies","Cirrhosis","Chronic_hepatitis","Hepatocellular_carcinoma","Common_cold","Flu","Immunologic_adjuvant","Adverse_effects","Erythema","Immunosuppression","Neutropenia","Roferon_A","Interferon_alfa-2b","Intron_A","Multiferon","Interferon_beta-1a","Rebif","Interferon_beta-1a","Avonex","Interferon_beta-1a","Cinnovex","Interferon_beta-1b","Betaseron","Interferon_beta-1b","Peginterferon_alfa-2a","Peginterferon_alfa-2a","Peginterferon_alfa-2a","Peginterferon_alfa-2b","PegIntron","Peginterferon_alfa-2b","Ribavirin","Cutaneous","Melanoma","Dacarbazine","Food_and_Drug_Administration","PEGylated","Polyethylene_glycol","Peginterferon_alfa-2b","Peginterferon_alfa-2a","Antiviral_drug","Ribavirin","Hepatitis_C","Protease_Inhibitors","Boceprevir","Telaprevir","Vaccine","Smallpox","Virology","University_of_Tokyo","Inoculate","Homogenization_(biology)","Antibody","French_language","Alick_Isaacs","National_Institute_for_Medical_Research","Influenza_virus","Chorioallantoic_membrane","Sidney_Pestka","Gene","Bacterium","Recombinant_DNA_technology","Yeast","IFNA1","IFNA2","IFNA4","IFNA5","IFNA6","IFNA7","IFNA8","IFNA10","IFNA13","IFNA14","IFNA16","IFNA17","IFNA21","IFNB1","IFNK","Immunotherapy","Immunosuppression","Immunosuppressive_drug","Interferon_Consensus_Sequence-binding_protein"]}
