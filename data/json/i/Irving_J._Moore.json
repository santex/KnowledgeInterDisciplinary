He was known primarily\nfor work in two nighttime soap operas, [[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]] and\n[[Dynasty (TV series)|Dynasty]] as well as segments of such other series as\n[[Gunsmoke]] and [[Eight Is Enough]].\n\nMoore launched his Hollywood career as a messenger on the Columbia Studios lot\nand worked his way to assistant director and then to director. His first\ndirecting was done on the old western series [[Tales of the Texas Rangers]]. He also directed episodes during the late 1950s on the sets\nof two ABC/Warner Brothers westerns, [[Cheyenne (TV series)|Cheyenne]] and\n[[Sugarfoot]], starring Clint Walker and Will Hutchins, respectively. In 1960,\nhe directed six episodes of Mike Connors's CBS detective series [[Tightrope (TV\nseries)|Tightrope]]. He directed various episodes of ABC's [[Surfside 6]],\nincluding the 1960 premiere episode \"Country Gentleman\" and the second episode\nof the second season, \"The Wedding Guest.\" Similarly, he directed a few segments\nof another ABC/WB production, [[77 Sunset Strip]]. In 1961, Moore worked on\nthree episodes of ABC's [[The Roaring Twenties (TV series)|The Roaring\nTwenties]], starring Dorothy Provine and Mike Road. In 1966-1967, he directed\nthree segments of NBC's western [[Laredo (TV series)|Laredo]], a spin-off from\n[[The Virginian (TV series)|The Virginian]] and starring William Smith and Peter\nBrown. From 1965-1969, Moore directed twenty-six episodes of Robert Conrad's\nunconventional drama with a western setting, [[The Wild Wild West]]. From 1966-\n1974, he directed fourteen Gunsmoke episodes, his last having been the segment\nnamed, prophetically, \"Like Old Times\". He also directed episodes of the short-\nlived 1974 Gunsmoke spin-off [[Dirty Sally]], starring Jeanette Nolan. From 1974-\n1975, Moore directed ten episodes of NBC's [[Petrocelli]], with Barry Newman in\nthe title role. In the late 1970s, he directed NBC's [[The\nLife and Times of Grizzly Adams]].\n\nFrom 1977-1981, Moore directed fifteen segments of Dick Van Patten's hour-long\nfamily drama/comedy, Eight Is Enough, the last having been \"The Last Little\nTelethon in Sacramento\". From 1978-1991, he directed fifty-two segments of\nDallas, his last having been \"Designing Women.\" His best known directing on\nDallas was the 1980 episode, \"A House Divided\", better known for the advertising\ncampaign, \"Who shot J. R.?\", a cliffhanger segment which caused viewers through\nthe summer to guess at the culprit who attacked the detested J. R. Ewing, the\nLarry Hagman character.\n\nFrom 1981-1988, Moore directed fifty-eight episodes of Dynasty, the last having\nbeen \"A Touch of Sable\". He also handled duties of one or a few episodes of such\nprograms as James Arness's other western, [[How the West Was Won (TV series)|How\nthe West Was Won]] and Walter Brennan's [[The Guns of Will Sonnett]], both on\nABC, and CBS's [[The Doris Day Show]] and [[Lou Grant]].\n\nIn 1983, Moore directed the television movie, [[Making of a Male Model]],\nstarring Jon Erik Hexum and Joan Collins, who played Alexis Carrington on\nDynasty.\n\nIn 1991, Moore's final directing credit was the four-hour ABC miniseries revival\nof the Carrington clan of \"Dynasty.\"\n\nMoore died of a heart attack at the age of seventy-four in Sherman Oaks,\nCalifornia.\n","linknr":169,"url":"Irving_J._Moore","recorded":1375068253,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Irving_J._Moore&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Irving_J._Moore&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Chicago,_Illinois","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/Sherman_Oaks","/wiki/California","/wiki/Television_director","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/Television_director","/wiki/Chicago,_Illinois","/wiki/Soap_opera","/wiki/Dallas_(1978_TV_series)","/wiki/Dynasty_(TV_series)","/wiki/Gunsmoke","/wiki/Eight_Is_Enough","#cite_note-nyt-1","/wiki/Hollywood,_California","/wiki/Columbia_Studios","/wiki/Western_(genre)","/wiki/Tales_of_the_Texas_Rangers","#cite_note-variety-2","/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company","/wiki/Warner_Brothers","/wiki/Western_(genre)","/wiki/Cheyenne_(TV_series)","/wiki/Sugarfoot","/wiki/Clint_Walker","/wiki/Will_Hutchins","/wiki/Mike_Connors","/wiki/CBS","/wiki/Tightrope_(TV_series)","/wiki/Surfside_6","/wiki/77_Sunset_Strip","/wiki/The_Roaring_Twenties_(TV_series)","/wiki/Dorothy_Provine","/wiki/Mike_Road","/wiki/Laredo_(TV_series)","/wiki/Spin-off_(media)","/wiki/The_Virginian_(TV_series)","/wiki/William_Smith_(actor)","/wiki/Peter_Brown_(actor)","/wiki/Robert_Conrad","/wiki/The_Wild_Wild_West","/wiki/Spin-off_(media)","/wiki/Dirty_Sally","/wiki/Jeanette_Nolan","/wiki/Petrocelli","/wiki/Barry_Newman","#cite_note-imdb-3","/wiki/The_Life_and_Times_of_Grizzly_Adams","#cite_note-nyt-1","/wiki/Dick_Van_Patten","/wiki/Who_shot_J._R.%3F","/wiki/Cliffhanger","/wiki/J._R._Ewing","/wiki/Larry_Hagman","#cite_note-4","/wiki/James_Arness","/wiki/How_the_West_Was_Won_(TV_series)","/wiki/Walter_Brennan","/wiki/The_Guns_of_Will_Sonnett","/wiki/The_Doris_Day_Show","/wiki/Lou_Grant","#cite_note-imdb-3","/wiki/Television_movie","/wiki/Making_of_a_Male_Model","/wiki/Jon_Erik_Hexum","/wiki/Joan_Collins","#cite_note-nyt-1","/wiki/Miniseries","#cite_note-nyt-1","/wiki/Myocardial_infarction","/wiki/Sherman_Oaks,_California","#cite_note-variety-2","/w/index.php?title=Irving_J._Moore&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-nyt_1-0","#cite_ref-nyt_1-1","#cite_ref-nyt_1-2","#cite_ref-nyt_1-3","http://movies.nytimes.com/person/1030283/Irving-J-Moore","#cite_ref-variety_2-0","#cite_ref-variety_2-1","http://www.variety.com/article/VR108703.html?categoryid=25&cs=1","#cite_ref-imdb_3-0","#cite_ref-imdb_3-1","http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0601293/filmoseries#tt0047736","/wiki/Internet_Movie_Data_Base","#cite_ref-4","http://articles.latimes.com/1993-07-03/local/me-9552_1_moore-director-television","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/42047814","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","/wiki/Chicago,_Illinois","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/Sherman_Oaks,_California","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Irving_J._Moore&oldid=551556322","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1919_births","/wiki/Category:1993_deaths","/wiki/Category:People_from_Chicago,_Illinois","/wiki/Category:People_from_Los_Angeles,_California","/wiki/Category:American_television_directors","/wiki/Category:Deaths_from_myocardial_infarction","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_hCards","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Irving+J.+Moore&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Irving+J.+Moore","/wiki/Irving_J._Moore","/wiki/Talk:Irving_J._Moore","#","/wiki/Irving_J._Moore","/w/index.php?title=Irving_J._Moore&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Irving_J._Moore&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Irving_J._Moore","/wiki/Special:RecentChange
