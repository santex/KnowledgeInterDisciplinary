{"cursor":"20097","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Identity politics' are political arguments that focus upon the self-interest\nand perspectives of self-identified social interest groups and ways in which\npeople's politics may be shaped by aspects of their identity through race,\nclass, religion, gender, sexual orientation or traditional dominance. Not all\nmembers of any given group are necessarily involved in identity politics. The\npractice has probably a long existence; but the explicit term and movements\nlinked to it really came into being during the latter part of the 20th century.\nIt can most notably be found in class movements, feminist movements, gay and\nlesbian movements, disability movements, ethnic movements and post colonial\nmovements. But wherever it is found it is also open to wide debate and\ncritique. Minority influence is a central component of identity\npolitics. Minority influence is a form of social influence which takes place\nwhen a majority is being influenced to accept the beliefs or behavior of a\nminority. Unlike other forms of influence this usually involves a personal shift\nin private opinion. This personal shift in opinion is called conversion.\n","linknr":401,"url":"Identity_politics","recorded":1362891049,"links":22,"instances":["social_science","malaysia"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Identity politics|*","Human rights","Political terminology","Majority–minority relations"],"headings":["Use of the term","Debates and criticism","In art and culture","Examples of identity politics","See also","Notes","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg/20px-Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["bumiputera","malaysia"],["dalit_nationalism(india"],["identity","social_science"]],"members":["identity","bumiputera"],"related":["Political","Psychological_egoism","Special_Interest_Group","Minority_influence","Social_influence","Beliefs","Behavior","Opinion","Consciousness-raising","Liberal_democratic","Student_Nonviolent_Coordinating_Committee","Black_feminism","Combahee_River_Collective_Statement","Barbara_Smith","Combahee_River_Collective","NYU_Press","Marxist","Social_class","Class_consciousness","Black_Panther_Party","MOVE","Black_nationalism","Anarcho-primitivism","Green_politics","Hunter_gatherer","Neo-luddism","Arthur_Schlesinger,_Jr.","Civil_rights","Liberal_democracy","Culture","Society","LGBT_rights","Activist","Gay_rights","Queer_theory","Queer_theory","Judith_Butler","Gayatri_Chakravorty_Spivak","Strategic_essentialism","Hegemony","Queer","Multiculturalism","Urvashi_Vaid","Essentialism","Freudian","Capitalism","Gay_rights","Racism","Freedom_of_religion","Eric_Hobsbawm","Todd_Gitlin","Michael_Tomasky","Richard_Rorty","Sean_Wilentz","Robert_W._McChesney","Jim_Sleeper","World_War_I","Queer_nationalism","Islamism","Cornish_nationalism","Ulster_Loyalism","Bourgeois_nationalism","Hip_hop","Skinhead","Punk_subculture","Hip_hop_music","Punk_rock","Reggae","Soul_music","Film","Fanzine","Anarcho-punk","Queercore","Riot_grrrl","Gender","Sexual_orientation","Oi!","Working_class","East_End_of_London","2_Tone","Hardcore_punk","Black_nationalism","Rastafari_movement","White_power_skinhead","White_pride","Zines","Rock_Against_Communism","White_separatism","Black_people","Chicano_nationalism","Homo_hop","Environmentalism","Lowrider","Royal_Chicano_Air_Force","Mexican_American","Murals","Disco","Gay_rights","Right-wing","European_Parliament_election,_2009","Adultism","African_nationalism","Pan-Africanism","American_Indian_Movement","Pan-Indianism","Arabism","Arab_nationalism","Pan-Arabism","Anarcho-punk","Apple_fanboy","Autism_rights_movement","Basque_nationalism","Black_nationalism","Black_power","Bumiputera_(Malaysia)","Castilian_nationalism","Catalan_nationalism","Celtic_nationalism","Pan-Celticism","Chicano_nationalism","Christianism","Christian_Identity_movement","Christian_right","Cornish_nationalism","Dalit_Nationalism(India)","Deaf_culture","Disability_rights_movement","Ethnicity","Polyethnicity","Ethnocentrism","Equal_Rights_Amendment","Fat_acceptance","Father's_Rights","Feminism","Flemish_nationalism","Gay_Rights","Galician_nationalism","German_nationalism","Pan-Germanism","Hindu_nationalism","Hip_Hop_activism","Homo_hop","Irish_nationalism","Iranian_nationalism","Pan-Iranism","Islamism","Pan-Islamism","Jeunism","Juche","Mad_pride","Men's_rights","Multiculturalism","Cultural_pluralism","National_Council_of_La_Raza","Pan-Americanism","Pan-Asianism","Pan-Europeanism","Pan-Slavism","Pan-Somalism","Political_correctness","Puerto_Rican_nationalism","Quebec_nationalism","Queercore","Queer_nationalism","Racial_politics","Riot_Grrl","Scottish_national_identity","Separatism","Spanish_nationalism","Pan-Hispanism","Turkish_nationalism","Pan-Turkism","Turanism","Ulster_loyalism","Walloon_nationalism","Welsh_nationalism","White_nationalism","Women's_rights","Zionism","Adversarial_process","Auto-segregation","Client_politics","Conflict_theory","Conviction_politics","Cultural_marxism","Endogamy","Ethnic_interest_group","Group_rights","Group_polarization","Identity_(social_science)","Interest_group_liberalism","Minority_influence","Political_consciousness","Queer_Theory","Separatism","Social_conflict_theory","Standpoint_theory","Voting_bloc","Gary_Younge","Gad_Barzilai","Kimberlé_Williams_Crenshaw","W.E.B._Du_Bois","University_of_Minnesota_Press","Gad_Barzilai","University_of_Michigan_Press","Toni_Morrison","Tzvetan_Todorov","University_of_Maryland,_Baltimore_County","Hasan_Bülent_Paksoy"]}
