In a traditional back-of-the-book index the\nheadings will include names of people, places and events, and concepts selected\nby a person as being relevant and of interest to a possible reader of the book.\nThe pointers are typically page numbers, paragraph numbers or section numbers.\nIn a library catalog the words are authors, titles, subject headings, etc., and\nthe pointers are call numbers. Internet search engines, such as Google, and full\ntext searching help provide access to information but are not as selective as an\nindex, as they provide non-relevant links, and may miss relevant information if\nit is not phrased in exactly the way they\nexpect.
