[http://www.iau.org/about About the IAU] It acts as the\ninternationally recognized authority for assigning designations to celestial\nbodies (stars, planets, asteroids, etc.) and any surface features on them.\n\nThe IAU is a member of the International Council for Science (ICSU). Its main\nobjective is to promote and safeguard the science of astronomy in all its\naspects through international cooperation. The IAU maintains friendly relations\nwith organizations that include amateur astronomers in their membership. The IAU\nhas its head office on the second floor of the Institut d'Astrophysique de Paris\nin the 14th arrondissement of Paris. \"[http://web.archive.org/web/201004071-\n50225/http://www.iau.org/administration/secretariat/ IAU Secretariat].\"\nInternational Astronomical Union.

The IAU is also responsible for the\nsystem of astronomical telegrams which are produced and distributed on its\nbehalf by the Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams. The Minor Planet Center\n(MPC), a clearinghouse for all non-planetary or non-moon bodies in the solar\nsystem, also operates under the IAU.\n","linknr":477,"url":"International_Astronomical_Union","recorded":1362506472,"links":89,"instances":["dwarf_planet","moon","dwarf_planet"],"pdf":["http://www.iau.org/static/publications/IB100-v1.pdf","http://www.iau.org/static/publications/IB100-v1.pdf"],"categories":["Organizations established in 1919","Standards organizations","Astronomy organizations","Organizations based in Paris"],"headings":["History","Composition","General Assemblies","The XXVIth General Assembly and the definition of a planet","The Commission 46: Education in astronomy","See also","Notes","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/43/IAU_logo.svg/150px-IAU_logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/96/International_Astronomical_Union.png/334px-International_Astronomical_Union.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/Crab_Nebula.jpg/28px-Crab_Nebula.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["ceres","dwarf_planet"],["charon","moon"],["eris","dwarf_planet"],["eris","dwarf_planet"],["eris","dwarf_planet"]],"members":["ceres","charon","eris"],"related":["President","French_language","Ph.D.","Astronomy","Celestial_bodies","Star","Planet","Asteroid","International_Council_for_Science","Amateur_astronomers","14th_arrondissement_of_Paris","Astronomical_naming_conventions","Planetary_nomenclature","Central_Bureau_for_Astronomical_Telegrams","Minor_Planet_Center","Solar_system","Solar_Union","International_Time_Bureau","Benjamin_Baillaud","Pieter_Johannes_van_Rhijn","Nicolaus_Copernicus","PhD","Catherine_J._Cesarsky","Supermajority","World_War_II","Warsaw","Nicolaus_Copernicus","Cambridge","Leiden","Cambridge,_Massachusetts","Massachusetts","Stockholm","Zürich","Dublin","Republic_of_Ireland","Soviet_Union","Berkeley,_California","California","Hamburg","Prague","Czechoslovakia","Brighton","New_South_Wales","Grenoble","Montreal","Quebec","Patras","Baltimore","Maryland","Buenos_Aires","Argentina","The_Hague","Kyoto","Kansai_region","Manchester","New_South_Wales","Prague","Rio_de_Janeiro","Brazil","Prague","2006_definition_of_planet","Planets","Solar_system","Ceres_(dwarf_planet)","Pluto","Charon_(moon)","Eris_(dwarf_planet)","2006_definition_of_planet","Eris_(dwarf_planet)","Dwarf_planet","Eris_(dwarf_planet)","Michael_E._Brown","Hands-on_universe","Global_Hands-On_Universe","Hands-on_universe","Astronomical_naming_conventions","Planetary_nomenclature"]}
