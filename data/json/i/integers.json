For example, 21, 4, and −2048 are integers; 9.75, 5½, and are not\nintegers. The set of integers is a subset of the real numbers, and consists of\nthe natural numbers (, , , , ...) and the negatives of the non-zero natural\nnumbers (, −2, −3, ...).\n\nThe name derives from the Latin integer (meaning literally \"untouched,\" hence\n\"whole\": the word entire comes from the same origin, but via French<ref></ref>).\nThe set of all integers is often denoted by a boldface 'Z' (or blackboard bold\n<math>\\mathbb{Z}</math>, Unicode U+2124 ), which stands for\n[[wiktionary:Zahlen|Zahlen]] (German for numbers, pronounced ).<ref></ref>\n\nThe integers (with addition as operation) form the smallest group containing the\nadditive monoid of the natural numbers. Like the natural numbers, the integers\nform a countably infinite set. In algebraic number theory, these commonly\nunderstood integers, embedded in the field of rational numbers, are referred to\nas 'rational integers' to distinguish them from the more broadly defined\nalgebraic integers.\n\n.
