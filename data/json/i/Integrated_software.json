{"cursor":"3131","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Integrated software' is software for personal computers that combines the most\ncommonly used functions of many productivity software programs into one\napplication.\n\nThe integrated software genre has been largely overshadowed by fully functional\noffice suites, most notably Microsoft Office, but at one time was considered the\n\"killer application\" type responsible for the rise and dominance of the IBM PC\nin the desktop business computing world. {{cite web |url =\nhttp://www.crn.com/crn/special/supplement/816/816p71_hof.jhtml |title = Lotus\n1-2-3 |accessdate = 2007-12-21 |author = Lee Pender |date = November 1998 |work\n= Ten Revolutionaries of Computing |publisher = Computer Reseller News }}\n\nIn the early days of the PC before GUIs became common, user interfaces were text-\nonly and were operated mostly by function key and modifier key sequences. Every\nprogram used a different set of keystrokes, making it difficult for a user to\nmaster more than one or two programs. Programs were loaded from floppy disk,\nmaking it very slow and inconvenient to switch between programs and difficult or\nimpossible to exchange data between them (to transfer the results from a\nspreadsheet to a word processor document for example). In response to these\nlimitations, vendors created multifunction \"integrated\" packages, eliminating\nthe need to switch between programs and presenting the user with a more\nconsistent interface.\n\nThe potential for greater ease-of-use made integrated software attractive to\nhome markets as well as business, and packages such as the original AppleWorks\nfor the Apple II and Jane for the Commodore 128 were developed in the 1980s to\nrun on most popular home computers of the day. Commodore even produced the\nPlus/4 computer with a simple integrated suite built into ROM.\n\nContext MBA was an early example of the genre, and featured spreadsheet,\ndatabase, chart-making, word processing and terminal emulation functions.\nHowever, because it was written in Pascal for portability, it ran slowly on the\nrelatively underpowered systems of the day. Lotus 1-2-3, which followed it, had\nfewer functions but was written in x86 assembler, providing it with a speed\nadvantage that allowed it to become the predominant business application for\npersonal computers in the 1980s. {{cite web |url =\nhttp://www.dvorak.org/blog/?page_id=8250 |title = Whatever Happened to Context\nMBA? |accessdate = 2007-12-21 |authorlink = John C Dvorak |publisher = Dvorak\nUncensored }}\n\nThe integrated software market of today is exemplified by entry-level programs\nsuch as Microsoft Works (obsolescent) which are often bundled with PCs as\n\"starter\" productivity suites, as well as by web apps such as Google Docs.\n","linknr":104,"url":"Integrated_software","recorded":1374522525,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Integrated_software&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Integrated_software&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Personal_computer","/wiki/Office_suite","/wiki/Microsoft_Office","/wiki/Killer_application","/wiki/IBM_PC","#cite_note-1","/wiki/GUI","/wiki/Function_key","/wiki/Modifier_key","/wiki/Floppy_disk","/wiki/AppleWorks#AppleWorks","/wiki/Apple_II","/wiki/Jane_(software)","/wiki/Commodore_128","/wiki/Home_computer","/wiki/Plus/4","/wiki/Read-only_memory","/wiki/Context_MBA","/wiki/Spreadsheet","/wiki/Database","/wiki/Chart","/wiki/Word_processing","/wiki/Terminal_emulation","/wiki/Pascal_(programming_language)","/wiki/Lotus_1-2-3","/wiki/X86","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Microsoft_Works","/wiki/Web_apps","/wiki/Google_Docs","/w/index.php?title=Integrated_software&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Comparison_of_office_suites","/w/index.php?title=Integrated_software&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-1","http://www.crn.com/crn/special/supplement/816/816p71_hof.jhtml","#cite_ref-2","http://www.dvorak.org/blog/?page_id=8250","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Integrated_software&oldid=562500898","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Enterprise_application_integration","/wiki/Category:DOS_software","/wiki/Category:Office_suites","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Integrated+software&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Integrated+software","/wiki/Integrated_software","/w/index.php?title=Talk:Integrated_software&action=edit&redlink=1","#","/wiki/Integrated_software","/w/index.php?title=Integrated_software&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Integrated_software&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf8/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Integrated_software","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Integrated_software","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Integrated_software&oldid=562500898","/w/index.php?title=Integrated_software&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Integrated_software&id=562500898","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Integrated+software","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Integrated+software&oldid=562500898&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Integrated_software&printable=yes","#","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_software","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf8/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":["software","programming_language"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Enterprise
