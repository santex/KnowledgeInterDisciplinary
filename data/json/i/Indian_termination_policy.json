{"cursor":"53831","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" 'Indian termination' was the policy\nof the United States from the mid-1940s to the mid-1960s. The belief\nwas that Native Americans would be better off if assimilated as individuals\ninto mainstream American society. To that end, Congress proposed to end the\nspecial relationship between tribes and the federal government. The intention\nwas to grant Native Americans all the rights and privileges of citizenship, and\nto reduce their dependence on a bureaucracy whose mismanagement had been\ndocumented. In practical terms, the policy terminated the U.S. government's\nrecognition of sovereignty of tribes, trusteeship of Indian reservations, and\nexclusion of Indians from state laws. Native Americans were to become subject\nto state and federal taxes as well as laws, from which they had previously been\nexempt. {{cite web\n|url=http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/native_voices/voices_display.cfm?id=96\n|title=U.S. House of Representatives Resolution 108, 83rd Congress, 1953.
