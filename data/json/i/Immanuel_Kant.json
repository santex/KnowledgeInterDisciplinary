Crane Brinton. \"Enlightenment\". Encyclopedia of\nPhilosophy. Vol. 2, p. 519. Macmillan, 1967.\n\nKant's major work, the [[Critique of Pure Reason]] (Kritik der reinen\nVernunft, 1781), aimed to unite reason with experience to move\nbeyond what he took to be failures of traditional philosophy and metaphysics.\nHe hoped to end an age of speculation where objects outside experience were\nused to support what he saw as futile theories, while opposing the skepticism\nof thinkers such as Hume.\n\nHe stated: }} Kant proposed a \"Copernican Revolution-in-reverse\",\nsaying that:\n\nIn simple terms, Kant pointed out that we all shape our experience of things\nthrough the filter of our mind. The mind shapes that experience, and among other\nthings, Kant believed the concepts of space and time were programmed into the\nhuman brain, as was the notion of cause and effect.\n\n We never have direct experience of things, the noumenal world, and what\nwe do experience is the phenomenal world as conveyed by our senses. These\nobservations summarize Kant's views upon the subjectâobject problem.\n\nKant published other important works on ethics, religion, law, aesthetics,\nastronomy, and history. These included the [[Critique of Practical Reason]]\n(Kritik der praktischen Vernunft, 1788), the [[Metaphysics of Morals]] (Die\nMetaphysik der Sitten, 1797), which dealt with ethics, and the [[Critique of\nJudgment]] (Kritik der Urteilskraft, 1790), which looks at aesthetics and\nteleology. He aimed to resolve disputes between empirical and rationalist\napproaches. The former asserted that all knowledge comes through experience; the\nlatter maintained that reason and innate ideas were prior. Kant argued that\nexperience is purely subjective without first being processed by pure reason. He\nalso said that using reason without applying it to experience only leads to\ntheoretical illusions. The free and proper exercise of reason by the individual\nwas a theme both of the Enlightenment, and of Kant's approaches to the various\nproblems of philosophy.\n\nHis ideas influenced many thinkers in Germany during his lifetime. He settled\nand moved philosophy beyond the debate between the rationalists and empiricists.\nThe philosophers Fichte, Schelling, Hegel and Schopenhauer amended and developed\nthe Kantian system, thus bringing about various forms of German idealism. He is\nseen as a major figure in the history and development of philosophy. German and\nEuropean thinking progressed after his time, and his influence still inspires\nphilosophical work today.\n","linknr":2670,"url":"Immanuel_Kant","recorded":1362485292,"links":189,"instances":["philosophy","mathematics","philosopher","philosophy_of_mind","philosopher","philosopher","grammar","philosophy","philosophy","metaphor","philosophy"],"pdf":["http://hardproblem.ru/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Vasilyev-The-Origin.pdf","http://www.facso.uchile.cl/publicaciones/moebio/28/perez.pdf","http://www.konvergencias.net/danieloperez132.pdf","http://www.scielo.br/pdf/trans/v32n1/07.pdf"],"categories":["Immanuel
