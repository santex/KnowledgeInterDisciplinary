It is the 5th most\npopulous and 25th most extensive state, and is often noted as a microcosm of the\nentire country.<ref name=\"so\"></ref> With Chicago in the northeast, small\nindustrial cities and great agricultural productivity in central and northern\nIllinois, and natural resources like coal, timber, and petroleum in the south,\nIllinois has a diverse economic base and is a major transportation hub. The Port\nof Chicago connects the state to other global ports from the Great Lakes, via\nthe Saint Lawrence Seaway, to the Atlantic Ocean; as well as the Great Lakes to\nthe Mississippi River, via the Illinois River. For decades, O'Hare International\nAirport has been ranked as one of the world's busiest airports. Illinois has\nlong had a reputation as a bellwether both in social and cultural terms<ref\nname=\"so\" /> and politics.\n\nAlthough today the state's largest population center is around Chicago (in the\nnorthern part of the state) originally the state's European population grew\nfirst in the west, with French Canadians who settled along the Mississippi\nRiver. After the American Revolutionary War established the United States,\nAmerican settlers began arriving from Kentucky in the 1810s via the Ohio River,\nand the population grew from south to north. In 1818, Illinois achieved\nstatehood. After construction of the Erie Canal increased traffic and trade\nthrough the Great Lakes, Chicago was founded in the 1830s on the banks of the\nChicago River, at one of the few natural harbors on southern Lake\nMichigan.<ref>\"Chicago's Front Door: Chicago Harbor.\" A digital exhibit\npublished online by the Chicago Public Library.\n[http://www.chipublib.org/digital/lake/CFDHarbor.html]. Retrieved October 20,\n2007.</ref> John Deere's invention of the self-scouring steel plow turned\nIllinois' rich prairie into some of the world's most productive and valuable\nfarmlands, attracting immigrant farmers from Germany and Sweden. Railroads\ncarried immigrants to new homes, as well as being used to ship their commodity\ncrops out to markets.\n\nBy 1900, the growth of industrial jobs in the northern cities and coal mining in\nthe central and southern areas attracted immigrants from Eastern and Southern\nEurope. Illinois was an important manufacturing center during both world wars.\nThe Great Migration from the South established a large community of African\nAmericans in Chicago, who created the city's famous jazz and blues\ncultures.<ref></ref><ref></ref>\n\nThree U.S. presidents have been elected while living in Illinois: Abraham\nLincoln, Ulysses S. Grant, and Barack Obama. Additionally, Ronald Reagan, whose\npolitical career was based in California, was the only US President born and\nraised in Illinois. Today, Illinois honors Lincoln with its official state\nslogan, Land of Lincoln, which has been displayed on its license plates since\n1954.<ref></ref><ref></ref> The Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum\nis located in Springfield.\n","title":"illinois","headings":["Name","History","Geography","Demographics","Economy","Arts and culture","Sports","Parks and
