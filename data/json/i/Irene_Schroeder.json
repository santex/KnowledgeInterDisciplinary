{"cursor":"4257","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Irene Schroeder' (February 17, 1909 - February 23, 1931) was an\nAmerican criminal who became the first woman to be electrocuted in Pennsylvania,\nand the fourth woman to be executed by electrocution in the whole of the United\nStates. She was given several\nnicknames by the press, including 'Trigger Woman', 'Iron Irene', 'Irene of the\nsix-shooters', 'animal woman', 'the blonde tiger' and 'the blonde bandit'.\n\nIrene Schroeder (nÃ©e Crawford) was born in 1909 in Benwood, West Virginia. At the age of 15, she married Homer Shrader, and they had a son\nDonnie a year later. She soon left Homer, becoming a waitress\nin Wheeling, West Virginia. Here, she met Walter Glenn Dague,\nwho became her lover.\n\nOn 27 December 1929, Irene, Walter Glenn Dague and Irene's older brother Tom\nCrawford were involved in a grocery store robbery in Butler, Pennsylvania. While escaping from the scene of the crime,\nthey were stopped by two police officers, Brady Paul and Ernest Moore. A shoot-out ensued: Paul was fatally shot and Moore was\nwounded. Shrader, Crawford and Dague all\nescaped and went into hiding, leaving Irene's four-year-old son (who had been in\nthe car at the time) with a family member. Irene changed the\nspelling of her name to Schroeder in order to muddy the trail the police were\nfollowing.\n\nDonnie was soon interviewed by the police, and his testimony was later used to\nhelp convict his mother. He stated:  \"I saw my mama shoot a cop\".\nUncle Tom shot another one in the head. He shot right through the\nwindshield. \n\nTom Crawford was never arrested; police believe he was killed in a shoot-out\nfollowing a robbery in Texas. After a long manhunt, Dague\nand Schroeder were both apprehended following a shoot-out in Arizona. They were tried in Pennsylvania and sentenced to death by\nelectrocution - Schroeder was the first female to be executed in this way in\nPennsylvania.\n\nSchroeder was electrocuted on February 23, 1931 at 7:05 a.m., wearing \"a gray\ndress of imitation silk with white collars and cuffs, beige silk stockings and\nblack satin slippers\" to her death. Her executioner\nremarked that she seemed particularly \"composed and fearless\". Her parting words to her then-seven-year-old son Donnie were,\n\"I am going to die, my boy, but I am not afraid. Be a good boy and don't be\nafraid.\" Donnie was heard to remark, \"I'll bet my mom would\nmake an awful nice angel.\"\n","linknr":134,"url":"Irene_Schroeder","recorded":1364031559,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Irene_Schroeder&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Irene_Schroeder&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Pennsylvania","#cite_note-Gillespie-2","#cite_note-Shipman-3","#cite_note-Gillespie-2","#cite_note-Shipman-3","/wiki/Benwood,_West_Virginia","#cite_note-Shipman-3","#cite_note-Shipman-3","/wiki/Wheeling,_West_Virginia","#cite_note-Shipman-3","#cite_note-Shipman-3","/wiki/Grocery_store","/wiki/Robbery","/wiki/Butler,_Pennsylvania","#cite_note-Gillespie-2","#cite_note-Shipman-3","#cite_note-Shipman-3","#cite_note-Gillespie-2","#cite_note-Shipman-3","#cite_note-Shipman-3","#cite_note-Gillespie-2","/wiki/Texas","#cite_note-Gillespie-2","/wiki/Arizona","#cite_note-Gillespie-2","/wiki/Pennsylvania","#cite_note-Gillespie-2","#cite_note-Gillespie-2","#cite_note-Gillespie-2","#cite_note-Gillespie-2","#cite_note-Shipman-3","/w/index.php?title=Irene_Schroeder&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","http://www.timesonline.com/news/article_d678f464-3d6a-11e0-9514-00127992bc8b.html","http://www.timesonline.com/news/article_d678f464-3d6a-11e0-9514-00127992bc8b.html","#cite_ref-Gillespie_2-0","#cite_ref-Gillespie_2-1","#cite_ref-Gillespie_2-2","#cite_ref-Gillespie_2-3","#cite_ref-Gillespie_2-4","#cite_ref-Gillespie_2-5","#cite_ref-Gillespie_2-6","#cite_ref-Gillespie_2-7","#cite_ref-Gillespie_2-8","#cite_ref-Gillespie_2-9","#cite_ref-Gillespie_2-10","#cite_ref-Shipman_3-0","#cite_ref-Shipman_3-1","#cite_ref-Shipman_3-2","#cite_ref-Shipman_3-3","#cite_ref-Shipman_3-4","#cite_ref-Shipman_3-5","#cite_ref-Shipman_3-6","#cite_ref-Shipman_3-7","#cite_ref-Shipman_3-8","#cite_ref-Shipman_3-9","#cite_ref-Shipman_3-10","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Irene_Schroeder&oldid=542400653","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:American_robbers","/wiki/Category:Executed_American_women","/wiki/Category:1909_births","/wiki/Category:1931_deaths","/wiki/Category:People_executed_by_electric_chair","/wiki/Category:People_executed_by_Pennsylvania","/wiki/Category:People_executed_for_murdering_police_officers","/wiki/Category:20th-century_executions_by_the_United_States","/wiki/Category:People_convicted_of_murder_by_Pennsylvania","/wiki/Category:American_people_convicted_of_murdering_police_officers","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Irene+Schroeder&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Irene+Schroeder","/wiki/Irene_Schroeder","/wiki/Talk:Irene_Schroeder","#","/wiki/Irene_Schroeder","/w/index.php?title=Irene_Schroeder&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Irene_Schroeder&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Irene_Schroeder","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Irene_Schroeder","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Irene_Schroeder&oldid=542400653","/w/index.php?title=Irene_Schroeder&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Irene_Schroeder&id=542400653","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Irene+Schroeder","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Irene+Schroeder&oldid=542400653&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Irene_Schroeder&printable=yes","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irene_Schroe
