At the\ntop, the exosphere shows only stars.]]\n\n'Outer space', or simply 'space', is the void that exists between celestial\nbodies, including the Earth. It is not completely empty, but consists of a hard\nvacuum containing a low density of particles: predominantly a plasma of hydrogen\nand helium, as well as electromagnetic radiation, magnetic fields, and\nneutrinos. The baseline temperature, as set by the background radiation from the\nBig Bang, is 2.7&nbsp;kelvin (K).<ref name=\"CBE2008\"/> Plasma with a density of\nless than one hydrogen atom per cubic meter and a temperature of millions of\nkelvin in the space between galaxies accounts for most of the baryonic\n(ordinary) matter in outer space; local concentrations have condensed into stars\nand galaxies. In most galaxies, observations provide evidence that 90% of the\nmass is in an unknown form, called dark matter, which interacts with other\nmatter through gravitational but not electromagnetic forces.<ref name=\"Trimble\n1987\" /> Data indicates that the majority of the mass-energy in the observable\nUniverse is a poorly-understood vacuum energy of space which astronomers label\ndark energy.<ref name=\"nasa_darkenergy\" /> Intergalactic space takes up most of\nthe volume of the Universe, but even galaxies and star systems consist almost\nentirely of empty space.\n\nThere is no firm boundary where space begins. However the K·rm·n line, at an\naltitude of above sea level, is conventionally used as the start of outer space\nin space treaties and for aerospace records keeping. The framework for\ninternational space law was established by the Outer Space Treaty, which was\npassed by the United Nations in 1967. This treaty precludes any claims of\nnational sovereignty and permits all states to freely explore outer space. In\n1979, the Moon Treaty made the surfaces of objects such as planets, as well as\nthe orbital space around these bodies, the jurisdiction of the international\ncommunity. Despite the drafting of UN resolutions for the peaceful uses of outer\nspace, anti-satellite weapons have been tested in Earth orbit.\n\nHumans began the physical exploration of space during the 20th century with the\nadvent of high-altitude balloon flights, followed by manned rocket launches.\nEarth orbit was first achieved by Yuri Gagarin of the Soviet Union in 1961 and\nunmanned spacecraft have since reached all of the known planets in the Solar\nSystem. Achieving low Earth orbit requires a minimum velocity of , much faster\nthan any conventional aircraft. Outer space represents a challenging environment\nfor human exploration because of the dual hazards of vacuum and radiation.\nMicrogravity has a negative effect on human physiology, causing muscle atrophy\nand bone loss. Space travel has been limited to low Earth orbit and the Moon for\nmanned flight, and the vicinity of the Solar System for unmanned vehicles.\n",
