Its risk increases with age, smoking,\nhypercholesterolaemia (high cholesterol levels), diabetes, and hypertension\n(high blood pressure), and is more common in men and those who have close\nrelatives with ischaemic heart disease.\n\nSymptoms of stable ischaemic heart disease include angina (characteristic chest\npain on exertion) and decreased exercise tolerance. Unstable IHD presents itself\nas chest pain or other symptoms at rest, or rapidly worsening angina. Diagnosis\nof IHD is with an electrocardiogram, blood tests (cardiac markers), cardiac\nstress testing or a coronary angiogram. Depending on the symptoms and risk,\ntreatment may be with medication, percutaneous coronary intervention\n(angioplasty) or coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG).\n\nIt is the most common cause of death in most Western countries, and a major\ncause of hospital admissions. There is limited evidence for\npopulation screening, but prevention (with a healthy diet and sometimes\nmedication for diabetes, cholesterol and high blood pressure) is used both to\nprevent IHD and to decrease the risk of complications.\n\nThe medical history distinguishes between various alternative causes for chest\npain (such as dyspepsia, musculoskeletal pain, pulmonary embolism). As part of\nan assessment of the three main presentations of IHD, risk factors are\naddressed. These are the main causes of atherosclerosis (the disease process\nunderlying IHD): age, male sex, hyperlipidaemia (high cholesterol and high fats\nin the blood), smoking, hypertension (high blood pressure), diabetes, and the\nfamily history.\n","linknr":434,"url":"Ischemic_heart_disease","recorded":1362482090,"links":32,"instances":["medical","medicine"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Ischemic heart diseases"],"headings":["Signs and symptoms","Diagnosis","Pathogenesis","Prevention","Management","Epidemiology","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/Ischaemic_heart_disease_world_map_-_DALY_-_WHO2004.svg/220px-Ischaemic_heart_disease_world_map_-_DALY_-_WHO2004.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["prevention","medical"],["family_history","medicine"]],"members":["prevention","family_history"],"related":["Ischemia","Myocardium","Coronary_artery_disease","Atherosclerosis","Coronary_artery","Tobacco_smoking","Hypercholesterolaemia","Cholesterol","Diabetes_mellitus","Hypertension","Angina_pectoris","Chest_pain","Electrocardiogram","Blood_test","Cardiac_marker","Cardiac_stress_test","Coronary_catheterization","Percutaneous_coronary_intervention","Coronary_artery_bypass_surgery","Prevention_(medical)","Medical_history","Dyspepsia","Pulmonary_embolism","Risk_factor","Atherosclerosis","Hyperlipidaemia","Cholesterol","Tobacco_smoking","Hypertension","Diabetes_mellitus","Family_history_(medicine)","Angina_pectoris","Chest_pain","Acute_coronary_syndrome","Unstable_angina","Myocardial_infarction","Heart_failure","Heartburn","Electrocardiogram","Chest_X-ray","Blood_test","Myeloperoxidase","Biomarker","Cardiac_stress_test","Echocardiography","Medical_ultrasonography","Scintigraphy","Radionuclide","Coronary_catheterization","Stenosis","Angioplasty","Coronary_artery_bypass_surgery","Acute_coronary_syndrome","Emergency_department","Myocardial_infarction","Coronary_catheterization","Percutaneous_coronary_intervention","Stent","Thrombolysis","Cardiac_marker","Infarction","Coronary_care_unit","Cardiac_arrhythmia","Atherosclerosis","Coronary_artery","Myocardium","Thrombus","Smoking_cessation","Antianginal","Statin","Blood_pressure","Blood_sugar","Infarct_Combat_Project"]}
