According to the Oxford\nDictionary of Philosophy, the chronology of the subject and science of\nphilosophy starts with the Indo-Iranians, dating this event to 1500 BC. The\nOxford dictionary also states, \"Zarathushtra's philosophy entered to influence\nWestern tradition through Judaism, and therefore on Middle Platonism.\"\n\nThroughout Iranian history and due to remarkable political and social changes\nsuch as the Arab and Mongol invasions of Persia, a wide spectrum of schools of\nthoughts showed a variety of views on philosophical questions extending from Old\nIranian and mainly Zoroastrianism-related traditions, to schools appearing in\nthe late pre-Islamic era such as Manicheism and Mazdakism as well as various post-\nIslamic schools. Iranian philosophy after Arab invasion of Persia, is\ncharacterized by different interactions with the Old Iranian philosophy, the\nGreek philosophy and with the development of Islamic philosophy. The\nIllumination School and the Transcendent Philosophy are regarded as two of the\nmain philosophical traditions of that era in Persia.\n","linknr":638,"url":"Iranian_philosophy","recorded":1362485252,"links":21,"instances":["zoroaster","prophet"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Philosophy by region","Persian philosophy","History of ideas"],"headings":["Ancient Iranian Philosophy","Classical Islamic period","Contemporary Iranian philosophy","List of schools and philosophers","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/46/Persian_art_collage.jpg/220px-Persian_art_collage.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["on_nature","zoroaster"],["mani","prophet"],["mani","prophet"]],"members":["on_nature","mani"],"related":["Iranian_languages","Indo-Iranians","Zarathustra","Oxford_Dictionary_of_Philosophy","Judaism","Middle_Platonism","History_of_Iran","Rashidun_conquest_of_the_Sassanian_Empire","Mongol_invasion_of_Central_Asia","Zoroastrianism","Manicheism","Mazdakism","Persia","Greek_philosophy","Islamic_philosophy","Illumination_School","Transcendent_Philosophy","Parsi_people","Zoroaster","Persia","Zoroastrianism","Iranian_peoples","Indo-Iranians","Monotheism","Greek_philosophy","History_of_Western_philosophy","Ancient_Greek","Eudoxus_of_Cnidus","Latin","Pliny_the_Elder","Plato","Platonic_realism","Colotes","On_Nature_(Zoroaster)","Myth_of_Er","Freemasons","The_Magic_Flute","Age_of_Enlightenment","Voltaire","Deism","Christianity","Avestan","Osthanes","Zarathustra","Democritus","Mystery_religions","Stoicism","Socrates","Manichaeism","Mani_(prophet)","North_Africa","China","Augustine_of_Hippo","Theology","Dualism","Cosmology","Theology","Mazdak","Mazdak","Socialism","Sassanid_dynasty","Kavadh_I_of_Persia","Prophet","Revolution","Communism","Zurvanism","Ahura_Mazda","Middle_Persian","Menog-i_Khrad","Ahura_Mazda","Persia","Islamic_Golden_Age","Avicenna","Aristotelianism","Neoplatonism","Kalam","Islamic_philosophy","University_of_Notre_Dame","Medieval_Europe","Soul","Existence","Essence","Scholasticism","Paris","Proscribed","Psychology","William_of_Auvergne","Albertus_Magnus","Metaphysics","Thomas_Aquinas","Illuminationist_philosophy","Shahab_al-Din_Suhrawardi","Avicenna","Neoplatonism","Transcendent_Theosophy","Mulla_Sadra","Reality","Essentialism","Existentialism","Sufism","Zoroastrianism","Zarathustra","Jamasp","Middle_Persian","Ostanes","Letter_of_Tansar","Mobad","Sassanids","Shikand-gumanic_Vichar","Azar_Kayvan","Anacharsis","Scythians","Mazdakism","Sassanid_Empire","Mazdak","Manichaeism","Mani_(prophet)","Zurvanism","University_of_Gundishapur","Burzoe","Sassanid_Empire","Backgammon","Middle_Persian","Ibn_al-Muqaffa","Bukhtishu","Khosrau_I","Paul_the_Persian","Al-Farabi","Abu_Bakr_Razi","Miskawayh","Avicenna","Al-Ghazali","Abd_al-Qahir_al-Jurjani","Iranshahri","Kateb_Qazwini","Rhazes","Qutb-al-din_Razi","Baba_Afdal","Fakhr_al-Din_Razi","Nasir_al-Din_Tusi","Zakariya_Qazwini","Farid_al-Din_Attar","Umar_Suhrawardi","Umar_Khayyam","Semnani","Hamedani","Rumi","Shabestari","Lahiji","Shah_Nimatullah","Jami","Noor_Ali_Shah","Shahab_al-Din_Suhrawardi","Illumination_School","Sadr_al-Din","Shiraz_School","Mir_Damad","Isfahan_School","Mulla_Sadra","Transcendent_Philosophy","Jabir_ibn_hayyan","Rajab_Ali_Tabrizi","Qazi_Sa’id_Qumi","Tehran_School","Qom_School","Khorasan_School","Mulla_Hadi_Sabzevari","Neyshabor_School","Allama_mohammad_Iqbal","Avicenna","Al-Farabi","Shahab_al-Din_Suhrawardi","Mulla_Sadra","`Abdu'l-Bahá","Intellectual_movements_in_Iran","Eastern_philosophy","Ancient_philosophy","Iranian_traditional_humanism","Religious_intellectualism_in_Iran","International_rankings_of_Iran"]}
