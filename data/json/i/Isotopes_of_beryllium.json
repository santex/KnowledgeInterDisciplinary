As such, beryllium is\nconsidered a monoisotopic element. It is also a mononuclidic element, because\nits other isotopes have such short half-lives that none are primordial and\ntheir abundance is very low. Beryllium is unique as being the only monoisotopic\nelement with both an even number of protons and an odd number of neutrons.\nThere are 25 other monoisotopic elements but all have odd atomic numbers, and\neven numbers of neutrons.\n\nOf the 11 radioisotopes of beryllium, the most stable are with a half-life of\n1.39 million years and with a half-life of 53.22 days. All other radioisotopes\nhave half-lives under 13.85 seconds, most under 20 milliseconds. The least\nstable isotope is , with a half-life measured as 5.03 zeptoseconds.\n\nThe natural light-element ratio of equal protons and neutron numbers is\nprevented in beryllium by the extreme instability of toward alpha decay, which\nis favored due to the extremely tight binding of {{SimpleNuclide nuclei. The half-\nlife for the decay of is only 6.7(17) seconds.\n\nBeryllium is prevented from having a stable isotope with 4 protons and 6\nneutrons by the very large mismatch in proton/neutron ratio for such a light\nelement. Nevertheless, this isotope, {{SimpleNuclide, has a half-life of 1.39\nmillion years, which indicates unusual stability for a light isotope with such\na large neutron/proton imbalance. Still other possible beryllium isotopes have\neven more severe mismatches in neutron and proton number, and thus are even\nless stable.\n\nMost in the universe is thought to be formed by cosmic ray nucleosynthesis from\ncosmic ray spallation in the period between the Big Bang and the formation of\nthe solar system. The isotopes , with a half-life of 53 days, and are both\ncosmogenic nuclides because they are made on a recent timescale in the solar\nsystem by spallation, like {{SimpleNuclide. These two radioisotopes of beryllium\nin the atmosphere track the sun spot cycle and solar activity, since this\naffects the magnetic field that shields the Earth from cosmic rays. The rate at\nwhich the short-lived is transferred from the air to the ground is controlled in\npart by the weather. decay in the sun is one of the sources of solar neutrinos,\nand the first type ever detected using the Homestake experiment. Presence of in\nsediments is often used to establish that they are fresh, i.e. less than about\n3â4 months in age, or about two half-lives of\n","linknr":305,"url":"Isotopes_of_beryllium","recorded":1362375519,"links":30,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.nndc.bnl.gov/amdc/nubase/Nubase2003.pdf","http://www.nndc.bnl.gov/amdc/nubase/Nubase2003.pdf","http://www.nndc.bnl.gov/amdc/nubase/Nubase2003.pdf","http://www.nndc.bnl.gov/amdc/nubase/Nubase2003.pdf","http://fl.water.usgs.gov/PDF_files/fs73_98_holmes.pdf"],"categories":["Beryllium","Isotopes of beryllium|","Lists of isotopes by element|Beryllium"],"headings":["Table","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/Be7fromcosmicrays.png/500px-Be7fromcosmicrays.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/Office-book.svg/30px-Office-book.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Primordial_nuclide","Monoisotopic_element","Mononuclidic_element","Radioisotope","Zeptosecond","Alpha_decay","Beryllium-10","Cosmic_ray_spallation","Big_Bang","Cosmogenic_nuclides","Carbon-14","Sun_spot","Solar_neutrino","Homestake_experiment","Proton","Neutron","Electron_capture","Proton_emission","Big_Bang_nucleosynthesis","Electron_capture","Cosmogenic","Triple_alpha_process","Stellar_nucleosynthesis","Beryllium-10","Beta_decay","Halo_nucleus","Alpha_decay","Neutron_emission","National_Nuclear_Data_Center"]}
