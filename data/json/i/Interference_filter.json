An interference filter may be high-pass, low-pass, bandpass, or band-\nrejection.\n\nAn interference filter consists of multiple thin layers of dielectric material\nhaving different refractive indices. There also may be metallic layers. In its\nbroadest meaning, interference filters comprise also etalons that could be\nimplemented as tunable interference filters. Interference filters are wavelength-\nselective by virtue of the interference effects that take place between the\nincident and reflected waves at the thin-film boundaries. The important\ncharacteristic of the filter is the form of the leaving signal. It is considered\nthat the best form is a rectangle.\n\nBandpass filters are normally designed for normal incidence. However, when the\nangle of incidence of the incoming light is increased from zero, the central\nwavelength of the filter decreases, resulting in partial tunability. The\ntransmission band widens and the maximum transmission decreases. P. H.\nLissberger and W. L. Wilcock, J. Opt. Soc. Am., '49' p. 126-130, (February\n1959). If Î» c is the central wavelength, Î» 0 is the\ncentral wavelength at normal incidence, and n * is the filter\neffective index of refraction, then: X. Baillard, A. Gauguet, S. Bize, P.\nLemonde, Ph.

This\ncorresponds to C-band or L-band in 1550 nm fiber-optic communications\nwindow. Equipped with a stepper motor and electronics, a tunable optical filter\nthat tunes center transmission wavelength over C-band or L-band by remote\ncontrol can be achieved.
