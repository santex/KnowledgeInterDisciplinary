It marked the end,\nafter Joseph Stalin's death, of a long period during the Cold War when\nscientific interchange between East and West was seriously interrupted. 67\ncountries participated, although one notable exception was mainland China, which\nwas protesting against the participation of the Republic of China (Taiwan). East\nand West agreed to nominate the Belgian Marcel Nicolet as secretary general of\nthe associated international organization.\n\nThe IGY encompassed eleven Earth sciences: aurora and airglow, cosmic rays,\ngeomagnetism, gravity, ionospheric physics, longitude and latitude\ndeterminations (precision mapping), meteorology, oceanography, seismology and\nsolar activity.\n\nBoth the Soviet Union and the U.S. launched artificial satellites for this\nevent; the Soviet Union's [[Sputnik 1]], launched on October 4, 1957, was the\nfirst successful artificial satellite. Other significant achievements of the IGY\nincluded the discovery of the Van Allen radiation belts and the discovery of mid-\nocean submarine ridges, an important confirmation of plate\ntectonics.
