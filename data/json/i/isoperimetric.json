Specifically, the isoperimetric inequality states, for the length L\nof a closed curve and the area A of the planar region that it encloses, that\n\n:<math>4\\pi A \\le L^2,</math>\n\nand that equality holds if and only if the curve is a circle.\n\nThe 'isoperimetric problem' is to determine a plane figure of the largest\npossible area whose boundary has a specified length. The closely related Dido's\nproblem asks for a region of the maximal area bounded by a straight line and a\ncurvilinear arc whose endpoints belong to that line. It is named after Dido, the\nlegendary founder and first queen of Carthage. The solution to the isoperimetric\nproblem is given by a circle and was known already in Ancient Greece. However,\nthe first mathematically rigorous proof of this fact was obtained only in the\n19th century. Since then, many other proofs have been found, some of them\nstunningly simple. The isoperimetric problem has been extended in multiple ways,\nfor example, to curves on surfaces and to regions in higher-dimensional spaces.\n\nPerhaps the most familiar physical manifestation of the 3-dimensional\nisoperimetric inequality is the shape of a drop of water. Namely, a drop will\ntypically assume a symmetric round shape. Since the amount of water in a drop is\nfixed, surface tension forces the drop into a shape which minimizes the surface\narea of the drop, namely a round sphere.\n","title":"Isoperimetric%20inequality","headings":["The isoperimetric problem in the plane","The isoperimetric inequality","The isoperimetric inequality on the sphere","Isoperimetric inequality in higher dimensions","Isoperimetric inequalities in a metric measure space","Isoperimetric inequalities for Graphs","See also","Notes","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["4: Werner_Fenchel","2: Circle","2: Rectifiable_curve","2: Sphere","2: Euclidean_space","2: Lebesgue_measure","2: Minkowski_content","2: Springer-Verlag","1: Geometry","1: Circumference","1: Closed_curve","1: Area","1: Perimeter","1: Plane_figure","1: Length","1: Carthage","1: Ancient_Greece","1: Differential_geometry_of_surfaces","1: Surface_tension","1: Curve","1: Principle_of_least_action","1: Physics","1: Nicholas_of_Cusa","1: Rotation","1: Johannes_Kepler","1: Jakob_Steiner","1: Mathematician","1: Convex_set","1: Area_of_a_disk","1: Adolf_Hurwitz","1: Fourier_series","1: Arc_length","1: Green's_theorem","1: Cauchy–Schwarz_inequality","1: Surface_area","1: Volume","1: Closure_of_a_set","1: Unit_ball","1: Hausdorff_measure","1: Brunn-Minkowski_inequality","1: Sobolev_inequality","1: Riemannian_manifold","1: Metric_space","1: Borel_measure","1: Measurable","1: Lim_inf","1: Distance","1: Cayley_graph","1: Discrete_group","1: Graph_theory","1: Expander_graphs","1: Sparse_graph","1: Computational_complexity_theory","1: Computer_network","1: Error-correcting_code","1: Hypercube","1: Hamming_distance","1: Hamming_weight","1: Isoperimetric_dimension","1: Chaplygin_problem","1: Gaussian_isoperimetric_inequality","1: Expander_graph","1: Planar_separator_theorem","1: Isoperimetric_point","1: Blaschke–Lebesgue_theorem","1: Wilhelm_Blaschke","1: Birkhäuser_Verlag","1: Cut-the-knot"]}
