{"cursor":"20001","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In biology, 'immunity' is the state of having sufficient biological defences to\navoid infection, disease, or other unwanted biological invasion. It is the\ncapability of the body to resist harmful microbes from entering it. Immunity\ninvolves both specific and non-specific components. The non-specific components\nact either as barriers or as eliminators of wide range of pathogens\nirrespective of antigenic specificity. Other components of the immune system\nadapt themselves to each new disease encountered and are able to generate pathogen-\nspecific immunity.\n\n'[[Innate immunity]]', or nonspecific immunity is the natural resistances with\nwhich a person is born. It provides resistances through several physical,\nchemical and cellular approaches. Microbes first encounter the epithelial\nlayers, physical barriers that line our skin and mucous membranes. Subsequent\ngeneral defences include secreted chemical signals (cytokines), antimicrobial\nsubstances, fever, and phagocytic activity associated with the inflammatory\nresponses. The phagocytes express cell surface receptors that can bind and\nrespond to common molecular patterns expressed on the surface of invading\nmicrobes. Through these approaches, innate immunity can prevent the\ncolonization, entry and spread of microbes.\n\n'[[Adaptive immunity]]' is often sub-divided into two major types depending on\nhow the immunity was introduced. 'Naturally acquired immunity' occurs through\ncontact with a disease causing agent, when the contact was not deliberate,\nwhereas 'artificially acquired immunity' develops only through deliberate\nactions such as vaccination. Both naturally and artificially acquired immunity\ncan be further subdivided depending on whether immunity is induced in the host\nor passively transferred from an immune host. 'Passive immunity' is acquired\nthrough transfer of antibodies or activated T-cells from an immune host, and is\nshort livedâusually lasting only a few monthsâwhereas 'active immunity' is\ninduced in the host itself by antigen and lasts much longer, sometimes lifelong.\nThe diagram below summarizes these divisions of immunity.\n\n\nA further subdivision of adaptive immunity is characterized by the cells\ninvolved; humoral immunity is the aspect of immunity that is mediated by\nsecreted antibodies, whereas the protection provided by cell mediated immunity\ninvolves T-lymphocytes alone. Humoral immunity is active when the organism\ngenerates its own antibodies, and passive when antibodies are transferred\nbetween individuals. Similarly, cell mediated immunity is active when the\norganismsâ own T-cells are stimulated and passive when T cells come from another\norganism. \n","linknr":475,"url":"Immune","recorded":1362506201,"links":60,"instances":["medicine","immunology","genetics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Immune system","Immunology"],"headings":["History of theories of immunity","Passive immunity","Active immunity","See also","External links","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d1/Immunity.png/600px-Immunity.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/92/Cholera_art.jpg/250px-Cholera_art.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/Tableau_Louis_Pasteur.jpg/200px-Tableau_Louis_Pasteur.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b4/Antitoxin_diphtheria.jpg/120px-Antitoxin_diphtheria.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/be/Immune_response.jpg/350px-Immune_response.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/80/Poster_for_vaccination_against_smallpox.jpg/200px-Poster_for_vaccination_against_smallpox.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/62/PD-icon.svg/12px-PD-icon.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["isotype","immunology"],["sulfonamide","medicine"],["attenuator","genetics"]],"members":["sulfonamide","isotype","attenuator"],"related":["Infection","Disease","Microbes","Immune_system","Artificial_induction_of_immunity","Humoral_immunity","Cell_mediated_immunity","Epidemic","Theurgy","Hippocrates","Four_humors","Miasma_theory_of_disease","Cholera","Black_Plague","Latin","Thucydides","Athens","Pharsalia","Marcus_Annaeus_Lucanus","Snake_venom","Islamic","Al-Razi","Phagocytosis","Louis_Pasteur","Germ_theory_of_disease","Immunology","Mithridates_VI_of_Pontus","Toxoid","Proximate_causation","Mithridate","Renaissance","Theriacum_Andromachi","Emile_Roux","Alexandre_Yersin","Diphtheria_toxin","Emil_Adolf_von_Behring","Shibasaburo_Kitasato","Diphtheria","Tetanus","Antitoxin","Europe","Smallpox","Chinese_people","India","Ottoman_Empire","East_Africa","Variolation","Lady_Mary_Wortley_Montagu","Edward_Jenner","Inoculation","Cowpox","Vaccination","Human","Horse","Antibodies","Pathogen","Toxin","Immune_system","Immunosuppression","Antibody","Fetus","Placenta","FcRn","Gestation","Isotype_(immunology)","IgA","Breast_milk","IVIG","Monoclonal_antibodies","Prophylactic","Immunodeficiency","Hypogammaglobulinemia","Poison","Hypersensitivity","Serum_sickness","Gamma_globulin","Antibiotics","Respiratory_disease","Sulfonamide_(medicine)","Adoptive_immunity","Histocompatibility","Graft_versus_host_disease","Cancer","Immunodeficiency","Bone_marrow_transplant","Hematopoietic_stem_cell","B_cells","T_cells","Innate_immune_system","Adaptive_immunity","Immune_response","Immunodeficiency","Immunosuppression","Vaccine","Edward_Jenner","Louis_Pasteur","Bavarians","National_Institutes_of_Health","Vaccine","Influenza_vaccine","Cholera","Plague_immunization","Hepatitis_A","Attenuator_(genetics)","Yellow_fever","Measles","Rubella","Mumps","Toxoid","Tetanus","Diphtheria","Subunit","Hepatitis_B_virus","Hypodermic","Polio","Typhoid","Cholera","Mouth","Bowel","Antiserum","Antivenin","Hoskins_effect","Immunology","Inoculation"]}
