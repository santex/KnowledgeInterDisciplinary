He coined\nthe term ethology.\n\nHe was born in Paris, the son of Ãtienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire. In his earlier\nyears he showed an aptitude for mathematics, but eventually he devoted himself\nto the study of natural history and of medicine, and in 1824 he was appointed\nassistant naturalist to his father. In 1832-1837 he published his great\nteratological work, Histoire gÃ©nÃ©rale et particuliÃ¨re des anomalies de\nlâorganisation chez lâhomme et les animaux.\n\nIn 1829 he delivered for his father the second part of a course of lectures on\nornithology, and during the three following years he taught zoology at the\nAthÃ©nÃ©e, and teratology at the Ãcole pratique. He was elected a member of the\nFrench Academy of Sciences in 1833, was in 1837 appointed to act as deputy for\nhis father at the faculty of sciences in Paris, and in the following year was\nsent to Bordeaux to organize a similar faculty there. He became successively\ninspector of the academy of Paris (1840), professor of the museum on the\nretirement of his father (1841), inspector-general of the university (1844), a\nmember of the royal council for public instruction (1845), and on the death of\nHenri Marie Ducrotay de Blainville, professor of zoology at the faculty of\nsciences (1850). In 1854 he founded the Acclimatization Society of Paris, of\nwhich he was president.\n\nBesides the above-mentioned works, he wrote: Essais de zoologie gÃ©nÃ©rale (1841);\nVie Ãtienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire (1847); Acclimatation et domestication des\nanimaux utiles (1849); Lettres sur les substances alimentaires et\nparticuliÃ¨rement sur la viande de cheval (1856); and Histoire naturelle gÃ©nÃ©rale\ndes rÃ¨gnes organiques (3 vols., 1854-1862), which was not quite completed. He\nwas the author also of various papers on zoology, comparative anatomy and\npalaeontology.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Isidore_Geoffroy_Saint-Hilaire","recorded":1372152259,"links":[],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["1805 births","1861 deaths","French ornithologists","French zoologists","Zookeepers","Members of the French Academy of Sciences","Scientists from Paris"],"headings":["Works","External links","References"],"image":[],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Paris","France","Zoology","Ethology","Étienne_Geoffroy_Saint-Hilaire","France","Zoology","Ethology","Paris","Étienne_Geoffroy_Saint-Hilaire","Mathematics","Natural_history","Medicine","Teratogenesis","Ornithology","French_Academy_of_Sciences","Bordeaux","Henri_Marie_Ducrotay_de_Blainville","Acclimatisation_society","Comparative_anatomy","Palaeontology","Gallica","Paris"]}
