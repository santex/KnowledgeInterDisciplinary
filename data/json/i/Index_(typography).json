Though\n rare today, this symbol was in common use between the 12th and 18th centuries\n in the margins of books, and was formerly included in lists of standard\n punctuation marks. Its typical use is as a bullet-like symbol to direct the\n readerâs attention to important text, having roughly the same meaning as the\n word âattentionâ or ânoteâ. Some encyclopedias use it in articles to cross-\n reference, as in  other articles .\n It occasionally sees use in magazines and comic books to indicate to the reader\n that a story on the right-hand page continues onto the next.\n\nIt primarily fell out of favor because its complex design made it unfit for\nhandwriting, and its wide size made it difficult to fit on a typewriter or on\nearly, low-resolution, monospaced computer fonts. It was therefore not included\nin ASCII. It was, however, added to Unicode.\n\nOther names for the symbol include 'printer's fist', 'bishop's fist', 'digit',\n'mutton-fist' and 'pointing hand' (see Sherman, p. 10).\n","linknr":237,"url":"Index_(typography)","recorded":1362551772,"links":20,"instances":["computers","linguistics","narrative_mode"],"pdf":["http://www.livesandletters.ac.uk/papers/FOR_2005_04_001.pdf"],"categories":["Palaeography","Typographical symbols"],"headings":["In literature","Other uses","Unicode","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Symbol_book_class2.svg/16px-Symbol_book_class2.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg/16px-Portal-puzzle.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5a/John_Wilkes_Booth_wanted_poster_new.jpg/133px-John_Wilkes_Booth_wanted_poster_new.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["stream_of_consciousness","narrative_mode"],["tableau","linguistics"],["cursor","computers"]],"members":["cursor","tableau","stream_of_consciousness"],"related":["Punctuation","Nota_bene","Monospaced_font","ASCII","Unicode","Kurt_Vonnegut","Stream_of_consciousness_(narrative_mode)","Thomas_Pynchon","Middle_finger","Optimality_Theory","Tableau_(linguistics)","Web_design","Hyper_link","Video_games","Adventure_games","Cursor_(computers)","Unicode","Dingbat","Wingdings_2","Microsoft_Windows","Windows_95","Wingdings"]}
