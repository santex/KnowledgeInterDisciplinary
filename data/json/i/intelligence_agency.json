      "text" : ", headquarters of the British Secret Intelligence Service (MI6)]]\n\nAn 'intelligence agency' is a government agency responsible for the collection,\nanalysis or exploitation of information and intelligence in support of law\nenforcement, national security, defence and foreign policy objectives. Means of\ninformation gathering are both overt and covert and may include espionage,\ncommunication interception, cryptanalysis, cooperation with other institutions,\nand evaluation of public sources. The assembly and propagation of this\ninformation is known as intelligence analysis or intelligence assessment.\n\nIntelligence agencies can provide the following services for their national\ngovernments.\n\n* Provision of analysis in areas relevant to national security;\n* give early warning of impending crises;\n* serve national and international crisis management by helping to discern the\n  intentions of current or potential opponents;\n* inform national defence planning and military operations;\n* protect sensitive information secrets, both of their own sources and\n  activities, and those of other state agencies;\n* may act covertly to influence the outcome of events in favour of national\n  interests, or influence international security; and\n* Defence against the efforts of other national intelligence agencies (counter-\n  intelligence).\n\nThere is a distinction between \"security intelligence\" and \"foreign\nintelligence\". Security intelligence pertains to domestic threats (e.g.\nterrorism, espionage). Foreign intelligence involves information collection\nrelating to the political, or economic activities of foreign states.\n\nSome agencies have been involved in assassination, arms trafficking, coups\nd'état, and the placement of misinformation (propaganda) as well as other covert\noperations, in order to support their own or their governments' interests.\n",
