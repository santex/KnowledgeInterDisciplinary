Epistemologically, idealism manifests as a\nskepticism about the possibility of knowing any mind-independent thing. In a\nsociological sense, idealism emphasizes how human ideas â especially beliefs and\nvalues â shape society. As an ontological doctrine, idealism goes\nfurther, asserting that all entities are composed of mind or spirit. Idealism thus rejects physicalist and dualist theories that\nfail to ascribe priority to the mind.\n\nThe earliest extant arguments that the world of experience is grounded in the\nmental derive from India and Greece. The Hindu idealists in India and the Greek\nNeoplatonists gave pantheistic arguments for an all-pervading consciousness as\nthe ground or true nature of reality. In contrast, the\nYogÄcÄra school, which arose within Mahayana Buddhism in India in the 4th\ncentury CE, Zim, Robert (1995). Basic ideas ofYogÄcÄraBuddhism. San\nFrancisco State University.

This turn toward the\nsubjective anticipated empiricists such as George Berkeley, who revived idealism\nin 18th-century Europe by employing skeptical arguments against materialism.\n\nBeginning with Immanuel Kant, German idealists such as G. W. F. Hegel, Johann\nGottlieb Fichte, Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling, and Arthur Schopenhauer\ndominated 19th-century philosophy. This tradition, which emphasized the mental\nor \"ideal\" character of all phenomena, birthed idealistic and subjectivist\nschools ranging from British idealism to phenomenalism to existentialism. The\nhistorical influence of this branch of idealism remains central even to the\nschools that rejected its metaphysical assumptions, such as Marxism, pragmatism,\nand positivism.\n","linknr":970,"url":"Idealism","recorded":1362483083,"links":85,"instances":["philosophy","psychology","philosophy_of_mind","physicist","philosopher","logic","philosophy","psychologist","philosopher","philosopher","philosophy","international_relations","ethics","philosophy"],"pdf":["http://www.stillnessspeaks.com/images/uploaded/file/Paul%20Brunton.pdf","http://individual.utoronto.ca/lpgerson/The_Unity_Of_Intellect_In_Aristotles_De_Anima.pdf","http://individual.utoronto.ca/lpgerson/The_Unity_Of_Intellect_In_Aristotles_De_Anima.pdf","http://www.scientificamerican.com/media/pdf/197911_0158.pdf"],"categories":["Idealism|","Theories
