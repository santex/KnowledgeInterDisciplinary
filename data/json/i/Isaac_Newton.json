Newton\n) was an English physicist and mathematician who\nis widely regarded as one of the most influential scientists of all time and as\na key figure in the scientific revolution. His book [[PhilosophiÃ¦ Naturalis\nPrincipia Mathematica]] (\"Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy\"), first\npublished in 1687, laid the foundations for most of classical mechanics. Newton\nalso made seminal contributions to optics and, as mathematician, he shares\ncredit with Gottfried Leibniz for the invention of the infinitesimal calculus.\n\nNewton's Principia formulated the laws of motion and universal gravitation that\ndominated scientists' view of the physical universe for the next three\ncenturies. It also demonstrated that the motion of objects on the Earth and that\nof celestial bodies could be described by the same principles. By deriving\nKepler's laws of planetary motion from his mathematical description of gravity,\nNewton removed the last doubts about the validity of the heliocentric model of\nthe cosmos.\n\nNewton built the first practical reflecting telescope and developed a theory of\ncolour based on the observation that a prism decomposes white light into the\nmany colours of the visible spectrum. He also formulated an empirical law of\ncooling and studied the speed of sound. In addition to his work on the calculus,\nas a mathematician Newton contributed to the study of power series, generalised\nthe binomial theorem to non-integer exponents, and developed Newton's method for\napproximating the roots of a function.\n\nNewton was a fellow of Trinity College and the second Lucasian Professor of\nMathematics at the University of Cambridge. He was a devout but unorthodox\nChristian and, unusually for a member of the Cambridge faculty, he refused to\ntake holy orders in the Church of England, perhaps because he privately rejected\nthe doctrine of trinitarianism. In addition to his work on the mathematical\nsciences, Newton also dedicated much of his time to the study of alchemy and\nbiblical chronology, but most of his work in those areas remained unpublished\nuntil long after his death. In his later life, Newton became president of the\nRoyal Society. He also served the British government as Warden and Master of the\nRoyal Mint.\n","linknr":1592,"url":"Isaac_Newton","recorded":1362480430,"links":247,"instances":["mathematics","wave_propagation","bloomington","optics","optics","optics","unit","mathematician","philosophy","optics","tv_series","history","mathematics","place","element","mathematician","physics"],"pdf":["http://www.isaac-newton.org/heretic.pdf","http://www.isaac-newton.org/heretic.pdf","http://webapp1.dlib.indiana.edu/newton/html/Newton_optics-alchemy_Jacquart_paper.pdf","http://www.opticsjournal.com/F.J.DuarteOPN%282000%29.pdf","http://www.opticsjournal.com/F.J.DuarteOPN%282000%29.pdf","http://www.isaac-newton.org/heretic.pdf","http://www.isaac-newton.org/heretic.pdf"],"categories":["1642
