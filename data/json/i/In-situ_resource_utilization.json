found or manufactured on other astronomical objects\n(the Moon, Mars, Asteroids, etc.) to further the goals of a space mission.\n\nAccording to NASA, \"In-situ resource utilization will enable the affordable\nestablishment of extraterrestrial exploration and operations by minimizing the\nmaterials carried from Earth.\" {{cite web\n  | title = In-Situ Resource Utilization publisher = NASA Ames

support, propellants, construction\nmaterials, and energy to a science payload or a crew deployed on a planet, moon,\nor asteroid.\n\nIt is now very common for spacecraft to harness the solar radiation found in-\nsitu, and it is likely missions to planetary surfaces will also use solar power.\nBeyond that, ISRU has not yet received any practical application, but it is seen\nby exploration proponents as a way to drastically reduce the amount of payload\nthat must be launched from Earth in order to explore a given planetary body.\n\nProposals have been made for \"mining\" atmospheric gases for rocket propulsion,\nusing what is called a Propulsive Fluid Accumulator.\n","linknr":332,"url":"In-situ_resource_utilization","recorded":1362267966,"links":36,"instances":["nasa","nasa","dwarf_planet","moon","moon"],"pdf":["http://www.moonbase-italia.org/PAPERS/D1S2-MB%20Assessment/D2S2-06EnergySupport/D2S2-06EnergySupport.Criswell.pdf","http://www.moonbase-italia.org/PAPERS/D1S2-MB%20Assessment/D2S2-06EnergySupport/D2S2-06EnergySupport.Criswell.pdf","http://gltrs.grc.nasa.gov/reports/2005/TM-2005-214014.pdf","http://gltrs.grc.nasa.gov/reports/2005/TM-2005-214014.pdf","http://history.nasa.gov/monograph21/Chapter%206.pdf","http://history.nasa.gov/monograph21/Chapter%206.pdf","http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/marsmiss99/pdf/2503.pdf","http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/robomars/pdf/6136.pdf","http://www.conforms.com/pdf/ultratech/UTD101.pdf","http://www.conforms.com/pdf/ultratech/UTD101.pdf","http://science.nasa.gov/media/medialibrary/1998/05/11/msad28apr98_1a_resources/fiber.pdf","http://science.nasa.gov/media/medialibrary/1998/05/11/msad28apr98_1a_resources/fiber.pdf","http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20050204002_2005206725.pdf","http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20050204002_2005206725.pdf","http://www.lpi.usra.edu/lunar_knowledge/LTaylor.pdf","http://www.transterrestrial.com/papers/Bienhoff_AIAASpace2011.pdf"],"categories":["Missions
