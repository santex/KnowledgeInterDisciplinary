In the computer age, this type of cataloging is now mostly obsolete.]]\n\n\n\n__NOTOC__\n\nAn 'index card' (or 'system card' in Australian English) consists of heavy paper\nstock cut to a standard size, used for recording and storing small amounts of\ndiscrete data. It was invented by Carl\nLinnaeus, [http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/06/090616080137.htm\nCarl Linnaeus Invented The Index Card] ScienceDaily, June 16 2009 around\n1760. Staffan MÃ¼ller-Wille, Sara Scharf\n[http://www2.lse.ac.uk/economicHistory/pdf/FACTSPDF/3909MuellerWilleScharf.pdf\nIndexing Nature: Carl Linnaeus (1707-1778) and his Fact-Gathering Strategies]\nUniversity of Exeter & University of Toronto, 2009, p. 4\n\nThe most common size for index cards in North America and UK is , hence the\ncommon name '3-by-5 card'. Other sizes widely available include , and ISO-size\nA7 (). Cards are available in blank, ruled and grid styles in a variety of\ncolors. Special divider cards with protruding tabs and a variety of cases and\ntrays to hold the cards are also sold by stationers and office product\ncompanies. They are part of standard stationery and office supplies in the\nUnited States, but in other countries, such as China, are not. They are\nvirtually unknown in Russia and other former Soviet Union countries.\n\nIndex cards are used for a wide range of applications and environments: in the\nhome to record and store recipes, shopping lists, contact information and other\norganizational data; in business to record presentation notes, project research\nand notes and contact information; in schools as flash cards or other visual\naids; and in academic research to hold data such as bibliographical citations or\nnotes. An often-suggested organization method is to use the smaller 3-inch by\n5-inch cards to record the title and citation information of works cited, while\nusing larger cards for recording quotes or other data. Index cards are used for\nmany events and are very helpful for planning.\n\nUntil the conversion of library catalogs beginning in the 1980s, the primary\ntool used to locate books was the card catalog in which every book was filed\nwith three cards, filed alphabetically under its title, author and subject (if\nnon-fiction). Similar catalogs were used by law firms and other organizations to\norganize large quantities of stored documents. However, the adoption of standard\ncataloging protocols throughout nations with international agreements, along\nwith the rise of the Internet and the conversion of cataloging systems to\ndigital storage and retrieval, have made widespread use of index cards for\ncataloging purposes obsolete.\n","linknr":139,"url":"Index_card","recorded":1362551772,"links":30,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www2.lse.ac.uk/economicHistory/pdf/FACTSPDF/3909MuellerWilleScharf.pdf"],"categories":["Library science","Indexing","Stationery"],"headings":["History","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4d/LA2-katalogkort.jpg/220px-LA2-katalogkort.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6e/Lhfhospitalsstatehospital001.jpg/220px-Lhfhospitalsstatehospital001.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2e/Notecard.jpg/200px-Notecard.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Australian_English","Paper","Carl_Linnaeus","Paper_size","North_America","UK","United_States","China","Card_catalog","Non-fiction","Carl_Linnaeus","Melvil_Dewey","Edge-notched_card","Hipster_PDA","Needle_card","Paper_size","Punched_card","Rolodex"]}
