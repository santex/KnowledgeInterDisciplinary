{"cursor":"7290","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" of Antarctica]] An 'ice sheet' is a mass of glacier ice that covers surrounding\n terrain and is greater than , thus also known as 'continental glacier'. [http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=ice-\n sheet1 American Meteorological Society, Glossary of Meteorology] The only\n current ice sheets are in Antarctica and Greenland; during the last glacial\n period at Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) the Laurentide ice sheet covered much of\n North America, the Weichselian ice sheet covered northern Europe and the\n Patagonian Ice Sheet covered southern South America.\n\nIce sheets are bigger than ice shelves or alpine glaciers. Masses of ice\ncovering less than 50,000 km 2 are termed an ice cap. An ice cap\nwill typically feed a series of glaciers around its periphery.\n\nAlthough the surface is cold, the base of an ice sheet is generally warmer due\nto geothermal heat. In places, melting occurs and the melt-water lubricates the\nice sheet so that it flows more rapidly. This process produces fast-flowing\nchannels in the ice sheet â these are ice streams.\n\nThe present-day polar ice sheets are relatively young in geological terms. The\nAntarctic Ice Sheet first formed as a small ice cap (maybe several) in the early\nOligocene, but retreating and advancing many times until the Pliocene, when it\ncame to occupy almost all of Antarctica. The Greenland ice sheet did not develop\nat all until the late Pliocene, but apparently developed very rapidly with the\nfirst continental glaciation. This had the unusual effect of allowing fossils of\nplants that once grew on present-day Greenland to be much better preserved than\nwith the slowly forming Antarctic ice sheet.\n","linknr":363,"url":"Ice_sheet","recorded":1362371889,"links":44,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg1/ar4-wg1-spm.pdf"],"categories":["Bodies of ice","Ice sheets|"],"headings":["Antarctic ice sheet","Greenland ice sheet","Ice sheet dynamics","Predicted effects of global warming","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e0/Antarctica_6400px_from_Blue_Marble.jpg/220px-Antarctica_6400px_from_Blue_Marble.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/31/Greenland_map.svg/220px-Greenland_map.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Antarctica","Glacier","Ice","Antarctica","Greenland","Last_glacial_period","Last_Glacial_Maximum","Laurentide_ice_sheet","North_America","Weichselian","Northern_Europe","Patagonian_Ice_Sheet","South_America","Ice_shelf","Glacier","Ice_cap","Geothermal","Ice_stream","Oligocene","Pliocene","Glaciation","Fossil","Plant","Antarctic_ice_sheet","Earth","Transantarctic_Mountains","East_Antarctic_ice_sheet","West_Antarctic_Ice_Sheet","Sea_level","Seabed","Ross_Ice_Shelf","Ronne_Ice_Shelf","Amundsen_Sea","Greenland_ice_sheet","Greenland","NASA","Gravity_Recovery_and_Climate_Experiment","Glaciers","Intergovernmental_Panel_on_Climate_Change","Sea_level_rise","Ice-albedo_feedback","Ta.பனிவிரிப்பு"]}
