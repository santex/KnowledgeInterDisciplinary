{"cursor":"3697","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nOrganized in 1951 as the 'Interstate and Foreign Missionary Baptist\nAssociational Assembly of America', this group is now known as the 'Interstate\nand Foreign Landmark Missionary Baptist Association of America'. Their purpose\nis to encourage fellowship among Missionary Baptist churches that practice\nministerial support by freewill offerings. Since they do not believe in\nstipulated salaries for pastors and missionaries, they are also known as\n\"Faithway Baptists\".\n\nChurches of this association originally fellowshipped with the American Baptist\nAssociation. A split in the American Baptist Association (organized 1924)\nresulted in the formation of two new national associations - the Baptist\nMissionary Association of America (then called North American Baptist\nAssociation) and the Interstate and Foreign Landmark Missionary Baptist\nAssociation. All three of these associations adhere to the Landmark principle of\na succession of Baptist churches from the time of Christ to the present.\n\nDoctrinally, the churches of the Interstate and Foreign Landmark Missionary\nBaptist Association hold that Christ died for all men; salvation is by grace\nthrough faith; the saved are eternally secure; the church is local only and was\norganized by Christ while He was on earth; baptism by immersion and the Lord's\nsupper are church ordinances; feet washing is to be performed in church\ncapacity; ministerial support must be by freewill offerings; and the Great\nCommission is given to local churches only.\n\nThe association work consists of local churches recommending their missionaries\nto other churches. All decisions to support missionaries are made by the\nchurches in their own business meetings. Local churches sponsor and directly\nsupport all missionary, benevolent, and educational work.\n\nIn 1951, forty churches were represented at the organization. In 2000, there\nwere 135 churches in the association, with a membership of 14,945. Some\nfellowshipping churches represent in local and state associations but not in the\ngeneral association. The total number of Faithway Baptist churches meeting in\nassociations is 168 with over 30,000 members. Most of the churches are\nconcentrated in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas;\nbut there are even churches in Mexico, Nicaragua, the Philippines, Quebec,\nCanada, and South Korea. Twelve foreign, six interstate, and two radio\nmissionaries were recommended by their churches (2000). A paper, \"The Voice of\nFaith\", is published by the Pine Missionary Baptist Church, Franklinton,\nLouisiana. Faith Way Sunday School Literature is printed by Palestine Missionary\nBaptist Church of Wilmer, Alabama.\n\nThe following are local and state associations in the Faithway Landmark\nBaptist work:\n\nMississippi: Red Creek, Black Creek, Landmark, and Mississippi State\nAssociations\n\nLouisiana: LA State/Stateline Association\n\nAlabama: Macedonia Local and State Association\n","linknr":130,"url":"Interstate_&_Foreign_Landmark_Missionary_Baptist_Association","recorded":1375059307,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Interstate_%26_Foreign_Landmark_Missionary_Baptist_Association&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Interstate_%26_Foreign_Landmark_Missionary_Baptist_Association&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Category:Baptist","/wiki/Baptists","/wiki/File:Baptism_logo.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/3a/Baptism_logo.jpg/100px-Baptism_logo.jpg","/wiki/Christianity","/wiki/Protestantism","/wiki/Puritan","/wiki/Anabaptist","/wiki/Baptist_beliefs","/wiki/Priesthood_of_all_believers","/wiki/Soul_competency","/wiki/Baptists_in_the_history_of_separation_of_church_and_state","/wiki/Sola_scriptura","/wiki/Congregationalist_polity","/wiki/Baptist_ordinance","/wiki/Baptist_offices","/wiki/List_of_Baptist_confessions","/wiki/List_of_Baptists","/wiki/John_Smyth_(Baptist_minister)","/wiki/Thomas_Helwys","/wiki/Roger_Williams_(theologian)","/wiki/John_Clarke_(Baptist_minister)","/wiki/John_Bunyan","/wiki/Shubal_Stearns","/wiki/Andrew_Fuller","/wiki/Charles_Spurgeon","/wiki/D._N._Jackson","/wiki/James_Robinson_Graves","/wiki/William_Bullein_Johnson","/wiki/William_Carey_(missionary)","/wiki/Luther_Rice","/wiki/Martin_Luther_King,_Jr.","/wiki/Billy_Graham","/wiki/List_of_Baptist_denominations","/wiki/List_of_Baptist_colleges_and_universities","/wiki/Portal:Baptist","/wiki/Template:Baptist","/wiki/Template_talk:Baptist","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Baptist&action=edit","/wiki/American_Baptist_Association","/wiki/Baptist_Missionary_Association_of_America","/wiki/Baptism","/wiki/The_Lord%27s_Supper","/wiki/Feet_washing","/wiki/Alabama","/wiki/Arkansas","/wiki/Florida","/wiki/Louisiana","/wiki/Mississippi","/wiki/Texas","/wiki/Mexico","/wiki/Nicaragua","/wiki/Philippines","/wiki/Quebec,_Canada","/wiki/South_Korea","/wiki/Franklinton,_Louisiana","/wiki/Wilmer,_Alabama","/w/index.php?title=Interstate_%26_Foreign_Landmark_Missionary_Baptist_Association&action=edit&section=1","http://www.adherents.com/Na/Na_319.html#2048","/w/index.php?title=Interstate_%26_Foreign_Landmark_Missionary_Baptist_Association&action=edit&section=2","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Interstate_%26_Foreign_Landmark_Missionary_Baptist_Association&oldid=564934229","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Baptist_organizations","/wiki/Category:Religious_organizations_established_in_1951","/wiki/Category:Baptist_denominations_established_in_the_20th_century","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Interstate+%26+Foreign+Landmark+Missionary+Baptist+Association&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Interstate+%26+Foreign+Landmark+Missionary+Baptist+Association","/wiki/Interstate_%26_Foreign_Landmark_Missionary_Baptist_Association","/wiki/Talk:Interstate_%26_Foreign_Landmark_Missionary_Baptist_Association","#","/wiki/Interstate_%26_Foreign_Landmark_Missionary_Baptist_Association","/w/index.php?title=Interstate_%26_Foreign_Landmark_Missionary_Baptist_Association&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Interstate_%26_Foreign_Landmark_Missionary_Baptist_Association&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Interstate_%26_Foreign_Landmark_Missionary_Baptist_Association","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Interstate_%26_Foreign_Landmark_Missionary_Baptist_Association","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Interstate_%26_Foreign_Landmark_Missionary_Baptist_Association&oldid=564934229","/w/index.php?title=Interstate_%26_Foreign
