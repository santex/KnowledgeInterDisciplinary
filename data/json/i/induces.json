generally credited with the discovery of induction in 1831\nthough it may have been anticipated by the work of Francesco Zantedeschi in\n1829.<ref></ref> Around 1830<ref></ref> to 1832,<ref></ref> Joseph Henry made a\nsimilar discovery, but did not publish his findings until later.\n\n'Faraday's law of induction' is a basic law of electromagnetism predicting how a\nmagnetic field will interact with an electric circuit to produce an\nelectromotive force (EMF). It is the fundamental operating principle of\ntransformers, inductors, and many types of electrical motors, generators and\nsolenoids.<ref name=\"Sadiku386\"></ref><ref></ref>\n\nThe 'Maxwell–Faraday equation' is a generalisation of Faraday's law, and forms\none of Maxwell's equations.\n","title":"Electromagnetic%20induction","headings":["History","Faraday's Law","Maxwell–Faraday equation","Proof of Faraday's law","\"Counterexamples\" to Faraday's law","Applications","Eddy currents","Faraday's law and relativity","See also","References","Further reading","External links"]},"micro-relation":["5: Magnetic_field","5: Maxwell's_equations","4: Magnetic_flux","4: Lorentz_force_law","3: Electromotive_force","3: Inductor","3: Electrical_generator","2: Michael_Faraday","2: Joseph_Henry","2: Electric_circuit","2: Transformer","2: James_Clerk_Maxwell","2: Surface_integral","2: Volt","2: SI_units","2: Electric_field","2: Line_integral","2: Lenz's_law","2: Classical_electromagnetism","2: Kelvin-Stokes_theorem","2: Homopolar_generator","2: Hawkins_Electrical_Guide","1: Potential_difference","1: Electrical_conductor","1: Francesco_Zantedeschi","1: Electromagnetism","1: Electricity","1: Electric_motor","1: Solenoid","1: Torus","1: Toroidal_transformer","1: Galvanometer","1: Direct_current","1: Lines_of_force","1: Oliver_Heaviside","1: Heinrich_Lenz","1: Dot_product","1: Field_line","1: Voltmeter","1: Arc_length","1: Time_derivative","1: Conservative_vector_field","1: Linear_operator","1: Infinitesimal","1: Orthogonal","1: Right-hand_rule","1: Scalar_field","1: Poisson's_equation","1: Gradient_theorem","1: Gauss's_law_for_magnetism","1: Scattering","1: Work_function","1: Lorentz_force","1: MaxwellâFaraday_equation","1: Current_clamp","1: Electromagnetic_forming","1: Graphics_tablet","1: Hall_effect","1: Induction_cooker","1: Induction_motor","1: Induction_sealing","1: Induction_welding","1: Inductive_charging","1: Magnetic_flow_meter","1: Mechanically_powered_flashlight","1: Rowland_ring","1: Transcranial_magnetic_stimulation","1: Wireless_energy_transfer","1: Magnet","1: Electrical_load","1: Electrical_energy","1: AmpÃ¨re's_circuital_law","1: Electromagnet","1: Friction","1: Joule_heating","1: Mechanical_energy","1: Magnetic_core","1: Switch_mode_power_supply","1: Intermediate_frequency","1: Lorentz_force#Force_on_a_current-carrying_wire","1: Einstein","1: Special_relativity","1: Eddy_current","1: Inductance","1: Moving_magnet_and_conductor_problem","1: Alternator","1: Crosstalk","1: Faraday_paradox","1: Vector_calculus"]}
