{"cursor":"1136","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nAn 'Induction' in a play is an explanatory scene or other intrusion that stands\noutside and apart from the main action with the intent to comment on it,\nmoralize about it or in the case of dumb show to summarize the plot or\nunderscore what is afoot. Inductions are a common feature of plays written and\nperformed in the Renaissance period, including those of Shakespeare. Example of\ninductions in Shakespeare are the dumb show in [[Hamlet]] and the address to the\naudience by Puck in [[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]. Another example, in [[The\nSpanish Tragedy]] by Thomas Kyd, is the introduction to that play by the ghost\nof Andrea who preps the audience by laying out the story to come. Likewise,\nShakespeare's [[The Taming of the Shrew]] opens with induction scenes which\ninvolve characters watching the play proper.\n","linknr":100,"url":"Induction_(play)","recorded":1362559765,"links":16,"instances":["theatre"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Drama"],"headings":["See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/P_culture.svg/35px-P_culture.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["play","theatre"]],"members":["play"],"related":["Play_(theatre)","Dumb_show","Renaissance","William_Shakespeare","Thomas_Kyd"]}
