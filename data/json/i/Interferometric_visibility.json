{"cursor":"3894","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The 'interferometric visibility' (also known as \"interference visibility\" or\n\"fringe visibility\" or just \"visibility\") quantifies the contrast of\ninterference in any system which has wave-like properties, such as optics,\nquantum mechanics, water waves, or electrical signals. Generally, two or more\nwaves are combined and as the phase between them is changed (e.g. in an\ninterferometer) the power or intensity (probability or population in quantum\nmechanics) of the resulting wave oscillates (forming an interference pattern).\nThe ratio of the size or amplitude of these oscillations to the sum of the\npowers of the individual waves is defined as the visibility.\n","linknr":129,"url":"Interferometric_visibility","recorded":1362553499,"links":16,"instances":["physics","wave_propagation","physics","physics"],"pdf":["http://www.physics.berkeley.edu/research/packard/Competition/Gyros/LaserRingGyro/Steadman/StedmanReview1997.pdf"],"categories":["Interferometers","Interferometry","Optics"],"headings":["Visibility in optics","Visibility in quantum mechanics","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/d/5/fd5c498b64ac14d23c114d468a41b898.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/a/5/c/a5ce7f9c9c3eaabf61c5769e68d307ad.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/6/c/56c86758791b80343ffc96e1aeba6abf.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/7/c/e7c712ba0cb3b59ee092e895ec6f9c72.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/5/c/45cb36e6621049516b88dd1b7a21f551.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/ef/Visibility.png/220px-Visibility.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf8/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/11/Double_slit_visibility.png/220px-Double_slit_visibility.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf8/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/67/HOM_visibility.png/220px-HOM_visibility.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf8/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["interference","wave_propagation"],["power","physics"],["intensity","physics"],["coherence","physics"]],"members":["coherence","interference","power","intensity"],"related":["Interference_(wave_propagation)","Optics","Quantum_mechanics","Interferometer","Power_(physics)","Intensity_(physics)","Quantum_mechanics","Amplitude","Interferometer","Mach-Zehnder_interferometer","Michelson_interferometer","Sagnac_interferometer","Monochromatic","Coherence_(physics)","Degree_of_coherence","Schrödinger_equation","Wave_equation","Quantum_mechanics","Bose-Einstein_condensate","Ramsey_interferometer","Double-slit_interferometer","Degree_of_coherence","Interferometry","Optical_interferometry","List_of_types_of_interferometers","Hong–Ou–Mandel_effect"]}
