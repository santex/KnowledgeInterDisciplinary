The idea of a two-way effect is essential in the\nconcept of interaction, as opposed to a one-way causal effect. A closely related\nterm is interconnectivity, which deals with the interactions of interactions\nwithin systems: combinations of many simple interactions can lead to surprising\nemergent phenomena. Interaction has different tailored meanings in various\nsciences. Changes also involve interaction.\n\nCasual examples of interaction outside of science include:\n\n* Communication of any sort, for example two or more people talking to each\n  other, or communication among groups, organizations, nations or states: trade,\n  migration, foreign relations, transportation,\n* The feedback during the operation of machines such as a computer or tool, for\n  example the interaction between a driver and the position of his or her car on\n  the road: by steering the driver influences this position, by observation this\n  information returns to the driver.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Interacting","recorded":1363137754,"links":[],"instances":["sociology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Communication","Interaction|","Pharmacology","Sociological terminology"],"headings":["Biology and genetics","Chemistry","Biochemistry","Medicine and pharmacology","Communications","Computers","Media art","Physics","Sociology","Statistics","See also","References"],"image":[],"tags":[["group","sociology"]],"members":["group"],"related":["Causality","Interconnectivity","Emergence","Science","Communication","Group_(sociology)","Organization","International_relations","Feedback","Machine","Geneticist","Mutation","Phenotype","Genome_Biology","Biosemiotic","Epistasis","Molecular_biology","Gene","Protein","Metabolite","Molecular_pathway","Medicine","Medication","Medicine","Combination","Pharmacist","Drug_interaction","Pharmacodynamic","Pharmacokinetic","Electronic_learning","Mass_media","Interactivity","Physics","Elementary_particle","Quantum_field_theory","Gauge_boson","Electric_charge","Electromagnetic_field","Beta_decay","Weak_interaction","Quantum_electrodynamics","Quantum_chromodynamics","General_relativity","Electroweak_interaction","Standard_Model","Sociology","Social_interaction","Social_action","Social_relation","Statistics","Statistical_model","Premature_birth","Main_effect","Main_effect","Drug_interaction","Game_semantics","Gordon_Pask","63rd_World_Science_Fiction_Convention","Glasgow","Scotland","Interactive_computation","Interaction_design","Interaction_design_pattern","Interaction_frequency","Interconnectivity","Financial_transaction"]}
