{"cursor":"2183","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nAn 'indirect branch' (also known as a 'computed jump', 'indirect jump' and 'register-\nindirect' jump) is a type of program control instruction present in some machine\nlanguage instruction sets. Rather than specifying the address of the next\ninstruction to execute, as in a direct branch, the argument specifies where the\naddress is located. Thus an example could be to 'jump indirect on the r1\nregister', which would mean that the next instruction to be executed would be at\nthe address whose value is in register r1. The address to be jumped to is not\nknown until the instruction is executed. Indirect branches can also depend on\nthe value of a memory location.\n\nAn indirect branch can be useful to make a conditional branch, especially a\nmultiway branch. For instance, based on program input, a value could be looked\nup in a jump table of pointers to code for handling the various cases implied by\nthe data value. The data value could be added to the address of the table, with\nthe result stored in a register. An indirect jump could then be made based on\nthe value of that register, efficiently dispatching program control to the code\nappropriate to the input.\n\nIn a similar manner, subroutine call instructions can be indirect, with the\naddress of the subroutine to be called specified in memory:\n\n SPARC:  jmpl %o7 MIPS:   jal $ra\nX86:    jmp *%eax ARM:    mov pc,\nr2 IA64:   br.ret.sptk.few rp\n6502:   jmp ($0DEA) 65C02:  jmp ($0DEA,X)\n65C816: jsr ($0DEA,X) \n","linknr":113,"url":"Indirect_branch","recorded":1362559790,"links":16,"instances":["computer_science","computers","computers","computer_science","computer_science"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Control flow","Machine code"],"headings":[],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/82/Software_spanner.png/40px-Software_spanner.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["instruction","computer_science"],["execution","computers"],["branch","computer_science"],["parameter","computer_science"],["memory","computers"]],"members":["parameter","memory","execution","instruction","branch"],"related":["Control_flow","Machine_language","Instruction_set","Memory_address","Instruction_(computer_science)","Execution_(computers)","Branch_(computer_science)","Parameter_(computer_science)","Processor_register","Memory_(computers)","Conditional_branch","Multiway_branch","Information","Jump_table","Machine_code","Subroutine","SPARC","MIPS_architecture","X86","ARM_architecture","IA64","6502","65C02","65C816"]}
