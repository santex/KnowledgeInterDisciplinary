The idea of a two-way effect is essential in the\nconcept of interaction, as opposed to a one-way causal effect. A closely related\nterm is interconnectivity, which deals with the interactions of interactions\nwithin systems: combinations of many simple interactions can lead to surprising\nemergent phenomena. Interaction has different tailored meanings in various\nsciences. Changes can also involve interaction.\n\nCasual examples of interaction outside of science include:\n\n* Communication of any sort, for example two or more people talking to each\n  other, or communication among groups, organizations, nations or states: trade,\n  migration, foreign relations, transportation,\n* The feedback during the operation of machines such as a computer or tool, for\n  example the interaction between a driver and the position of his or her car on\n  the road: by steering the driver influences this position, by observation this\n  information returns to the driver.\n","title":"interaction","headings":["Biology and genetics","Chemistry","Biochemistry","Medicine and pharmacology","Communications","Computers","Media art","Physics","Sociology","Statistics","See also","References"]},"micro-relation":["2: Interconnectivity","2: Drug_interaction","1: Causality","1: Emergence","1: Science","1: International_relations","1: Feedback","1: Geneticist","1: Mutation","1: Phenotype","1: Genome_Biology","1: Biosemiotic","1: Epistasis","1: Molecular_biology","1: Gene","1: Protein","1: Metabolite","1: Molecular_pathway","1: Medicine","1: Medication","1: Pharmacodynamic","1: Pharmacokinetic","1: Electronic_learning","1: Mass_media","1: Interactivity","1: Physics","1: Elementary_particle","1: Quantum_field_theory","1: Gauge_boson","1: Electric_charge","1: Electromagnetic_field","1: Beta_decay","1: Weak_interaction","1: Quantum_electrodynamics","1: Quantum_chromodynamics","1: General_relativity","1: Electroweak_interaction","1: Standard_model","1: Sociology","1: Social_interaction","1: Social_action","1: Social_relation","1: Statistics","1: Statistical_model","1: Premature_birth","1: Main_effect","1: Game_semantics","1: Gordon_Pask","1: 63rd_World_Science_Fiction_Convention","1: Glasgow","1: Scotland","1: Interactive_computation","1: Interaction_design","1: Interaction_design_pattern","1: Interaction_frequency","1: Financial_transaction"]}
