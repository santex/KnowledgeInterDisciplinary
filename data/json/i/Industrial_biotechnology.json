{"cursor":"8154","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n'Industrial biotechnology' (known mainly in Europe as 'white biotechnology') is\nthe application of biotechnology for industrial purposes, including\nmanufacturing, alternative energy (or \"bioenergy\"), and biomaterials. It\nincludes the practice of using cells or components of cells like enzymes to\ngenerate industrially useful products. [[The Economist]] speculated (as cited in\nthe Economist article listed in the \"References\" section) industrial\nbiotechnology might significantly impact the chemical industry. The Economist\nalso suggested it can enable economies to become less dependent on fossil fuels.\n\nThe industrial biotechnology community generally accepts an informal divide\nbetween industrial and pharmaceutical biotechnology. An example would be that of\ncompanies growing fungus to produce antibiotics, e.g. penicillin from the\npenicillium fungi. One view holds that this is industrial production; the other\nviewpoint is that it would not strictly lie within the domain of pure industrial\nproduction, given its inclusion within medical biotechnology.\n\nThis may be better understood by calling to mind the classification by the U.S.\nbiotechnology lobby group, [http://www.bio.org Biotechnology Industry\nOrganization] (BIO) of three \"waves\" of biotechnology. The first wave, Green\nBiotechnology, refers to agricultural biotechnology. The second wave, Red\nBiotechnology, refers to pharmaceutical and medical biotechnology. The third\nwave, White Biotechnology, refers to industrial biotechnology. In actuality,\neach of the waves may overlap each of the others. Industrial biotechnology,\nparticularly the development of large-scale bioenergy refineries, will likely\ninvolve dedicated genetically modified crops as well as the large-scale\nbioprocessing and fermentation as is used in some pharmaceutical production.\n","linknr":490,"url":"Industrial_biotechnology","recorded":1362500518,"links":26,"instances":["law","biology"],"pdf":["http://www.unido.org/fileadmin/media/documents/pdf/Energy_Environment/Industrial_biotech_and_biomass_utilisation_EGM_report.pdf"],"categories":["Biotechnology","Bioenergy","Alternative energy","Enzymes","Sustainability","Pharmaceutical industry"],"headings":["Industrial biotechnology and [[climate change]]","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/Industrialbiotechnologyplant.jpg/220px-Industrialbiotechnologyplant.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Sugarcane_field.jpg/120px-Sugarcane_field.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Symbol_book_class2.svg/16px-Symbol_book_class2.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/12px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg/16px-Portal-puzzle.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg/16px-Wikiquote-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cell","biology"],["sequestration","law"]],"members":["sequestration","cell"],"related":["Biotechnology","Cell_(biology)","Industry","Chemical_industry","Fossil_fuel","Agriculture","Land_use","Biomass","Food_production","Sub-Saharan","Africa","Greenhouse_gas","Air_pollution","Cogeneration","Gasification","Industrial_processes","End-users","Dissemination","Sequestration_(law)","Emissions_Trading","Joint_Implementation","CDM","Enzymes","Micro-organisms","Renewable_resources","World_Wide_Fund_for_Nature","CO2_emissions"]}
