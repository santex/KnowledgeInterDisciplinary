{"cursor":"5413","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n basalt collected by Apollo 15.]] Having a mean density of\n 3,346.4 kg/mÂ³, Making it the second densest satellite in the Solar\n System after Io the Moon is a differentiated body, being composed of a\n geochemically distinct crust, mantle, and core. This structure is believed to\n have resulted from the fractional crystallization of a magma ocean shortly\n after its formation about 4.5 billion years ago. The energy required to melt\n the outer portion of the Moon is commonly attributed to a giant impact event\n that is postulated to have formed the Earth-Moon system, and the subsequent\n reaccretion of material in Earth orbit. Crystallization of this magma ocean\n would have given rise to a mafic mantle and a plagioclase-rich crust.\n\nGeochemical mapping from orbit implies that the crust of the Moon is largely\nanorthositic in composition, consistent with the magma\nocean hypothesis. In terms of elements, the lunar crust is composed primarily of\noxygen, silicon, magnesium, iron, calcium, and aluminium, but important minor\nand trace elements such as titanium, uranium, thorium, potassium, and hydrogen\nare present as well. Based on geophysical techniques, the crust is estimated to\nbe on average about 50 km thick.\n\nPartial melting within the mantle of the Moon gave rise to the eruption of mare\nbasalts on the lunar surface. Analyses of these basalts indicate that the mantle\nis composed predominantly of the minerals olivine, orthopyroxene and\nclinopyroxene, and that the lunar mantle is more iron rich than that of the\nEarth. Some lunar basalts contain high abundances of titanium (present in the\nmineral ilmenite), suggesting that the mantle is highly heterogeneous in\ncomposition. Moonquakes have been found to occur deep within the mantle of the\nMoon about 1,000 km below the surface. These occur with monthly\nperiodicities and are related to tidal stresses caused by the eccentric orbit of\nthe Moon about the Earth. A few shallow moonquakes with hypocenters located\nabout 100 km below the surface have also been detected, but these occur\nmore infrequently and appear to be unrelated to the lunar tides.\n","linknr":242,"url":"Internal_structure_of_the_Moon","recorded":1362268743,"links":29,"instances":["geology","geology","moon","geology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Lunar science"],"headings":["Core","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/eb/Moon_diagram.svg/350px-Moon_diagram.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/29/Lunar_Olivine_Basalt_15555_from_Apollo_15_in_National_Museum_of_Natural_History.jpg/350px-Lunar_Olivine_Basalt_15555_from_Apollo_15_in_National_Museum_of_Natural_History.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/02/Moon_Schematic_Cross_Section.svg/350px-Moon_Schematic_Cross_Section.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4d/Moon-Mdf-2005.jpg/28px-Moon-Mdf-2005.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e1/FullMoon2010.jpg/120px-FullMoon2010.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg/16px-Portal-puzzle.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg/16px-Portal-puzzle.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["io","moon"],["crust","geology"],["mantle","geology"],["fractional_crystallization","geology"]],"members":["mantle","fractional_crystallization","io","crust"],"related":["Basalt","Apollo_15","Arithmetic_mean","Kilogram_per_metre_cubed","Solar_System","Io_(moon)","Moon","Planetary_differentiation","Geochemistry","Crust_(geology)","Mantle_(geology)","Fractional_crystallization_(geology)","Lunar_magma_ocean","Giant_impact_hypothesis","Plagioclase","Anorthosite","Oxygen","Silicon","Magnesium","Iron","Calcium","Aluminium","Titanium","Uranium","Thorium","Potassium","Hydrogen","Olivine","Orthopyroxene","Clinopyroxene","Ilmenite","Moonquake","Sulfur","Nickel","Apollo_Lunar_Surface_Experiments_Package","Moonquake","Sulfur","Structure_of_the_Earth"]}
