Launched\nin 1955 under the auspices of the Independent Television Authority (ITA) to\nprovide competition to the BBC, it is\nalso the oldest commercial network in the UK. Since the passing of the\nBroadcasting Act 1990, its legal name has been 'Channel 3', the number 3 having\nno real meaning other than to distinguish it from the other analogue channels at\nthe time, namely BBC 1, BBC 2 and Channel 4. In part, the number 3 was assigned\nas televisions would usually be tuned so that the regional ITV station would be\non the third button, the other stations being allocated to the number within\ntheir name.\n\nITV is a network of television channels (ITV, STV, UTV and Channel Television)\noperating regional television services as well as sharing programmes between\neach other to be displayed on the entire network. In recent years, several of\nthese companies have merged so currently the fifteen franchises are in the hands\nof three companies.\n\nITV is to be distinguished from '[[ITV plc]]', the company that resulted from\nthe merger of Granada plc and Carlton Communications in 2004 and which holds the\nChannel 3 broadcasting licences in England, Wales, southern Scotland, the Isle\nof Man and the Channel Islands. Similarly '[[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]]' is the\nbrand used by ITV plc for the Channel 3 service in these areas. Of the companies\nexternal to ITV plc, STV and UTV use their own brands in their own respective\nareas (northern and central Scotland and Northern Ireland).\n","linknr":1160,"url":"ITV","recorded":1362565889,"links":61,"instances":["uk_and_ireland","tv_channel","teletext","scotland","tv_network","uk","news_format","united_kingdom","uk"],"pdf":["http://web.archive.org/web/20070925214001/http://www.ofcom.org.uk/tv/ifi/tvlicensing/pt/teletextdrl.pdf","http://www.ofcom.org.uk/tv/ifi/tvlicensing/pt/teletextdrl.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20070925214001/http://www.ofcom.org.uk/tv/ifi/tvlicensing/pt/teletextdrl.pdf","http://licensing.ofcom.org.uk/binaries/tv/teletext/revocation_notice.pdf","http://licensing.ofcom.org.uk/binaries/tv/teletext/revocation_notice.pdf"],"categories":["1955
