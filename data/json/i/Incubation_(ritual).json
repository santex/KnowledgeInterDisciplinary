{"cursor":"1176","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Incubation' is the religious practice of sleeping in a sacred area with the\nintention of experiencing a divinely inspired dream or cure. Incubation was\npractised by many ancient cultures. In perhaps the most well known instance\namong the Hebrews, found in 1 Kings 3, Solomon went to Gibeon \"because that\nwas the most renowned high place to offer sacrifices.\" There \"the LORD\nappeared to Solomon in a dream at night,\" and Solomon asked God for the gift\nof an understanding heart. Among the members of the cult of Asclepius, Votive\nofferings found at ritual centres at Epidaurus, Pergamum, and Rome detail the\nperceived effectiveness of the method. Incubation was adopted by certain\nChristian sects and is still used in a few Greek monasteries. Modern\npractices for influencing dream content by dream incubation utilise more research-\ndriven techniques, but they sometimes incorporate elements reflecting these\nancient beliefs.\n","linknr":103,"url":"Incubation_(ritual)","recorded":1362566933,"links":20,"instances":["ancient_city"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Dream","Rituals"],"headings":[],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/28/P_religion_world.svg/35px-P_religion_world.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["gibeon","ancient_city"]],"members":["gibeon"],"related":["Revelation","Dream","Cure","Hebrew_people","Books_of_Kings","Solomon","Gibeon_(ancient_city)","Asclepius","Epidaurus","Pergamum","Rome","Dream_incubation"]}
