Civilian defensive, hunting, and\npolice firearms usually feature open sights, while many military battle rifles\nemploy aperture sights. On many firearms the rear sight is adjustable for\nelevation or windage. Hawks, Chuck.\n[http://www.chuckhawks.com/choosing_sights.htm \"Choosing the Right Sight\"],\nChuck Hawks Web site. Retrieved July 24, 2008.\n\nThe earliest and simplest iron sights are fixed and cannot be easily adjusted.\nMany iron sights are designed to be adjustable, so that the sights can be\nadjusted for windage and elevation. For precision applications such as hunting\nor sniping the iron sights are usually replaced by a telescopic sight. Iron\nsights may still be fitted alongside a telescopic sight and are referred to as\nBack Up Iron Sights (Acronym B.U.I.S).\n","linknr":363,"url":"Iron_sight","recorded":1362574444,"links":47,"instances":["optics","firearms","device","handgun","ballistics","mathematics","material_appearance","firearm","vision","geometry","air_gun"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Firearm
