HapMap is a key resource for\nresearchers to find genetic variants affecting health, disease and responses to\ndrugs and environmental factors. The information produced by the project is made\nfreely available to researchers around the world.\n\nThe International HapMap Project is a collaboration among researchers at\nacademic centers, non-profit biomedical research groups and private companies\nin Canada, China, Japan, Nigeria, the United Kingdom, and the United States. It\nofficially started with a meeting on October 27 to 29, 2002, and was expected\nto take about three years. It comprises two phases; the complete data obtained\nin Phase I were published on 27 October 2005. The analysis of the Phase II\ndataset was published in October 2007. The Phase III dataset was released in\nspring 2009.\n","linknr":214,"url":"International_HapMap_Project","recorded":1362373504,"links":29,"instances":["company"],"pdf":["http://www.hapmap.org/downloads/nature02168.pdf","http://www.hapmap.org/downloads/HapMapEthics.pdf","http://www.hapmap.org/downloads/presentations/Nature_HapMap_phaseI.pdf","http://hapmap.org/downloads/presentations/nature_hapmap3.pdf","http://hapmap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/downloads/presentations/nature09298.pdf","http://www.hapmap.org/downloads/presentations/Genome_research_art10.pdf","http://linkage.cpmc.columbia.edu/2006/EJHG_Terwilliger_2006.pdf"],"categories":["Human genome projects","Genetic genealogy projects","Genealogy websites","Biological databases","Open science"],"headings":["Background","Samples used","Scientific strategy","Data access","Criticisms","Publications","See also","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/6c/Wiki_letter_w.svg/23px-Wiki_letter_w.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["illumina","company"],["polymorphism","biology#genetic_polymorphism"]],"members":["polymorphism","illumina"],"related":["Haplotype","Human_genome","Genetic_variability","Canada","China","Japan","Nigeria","United_Kingdom","United_States","Rare_disease","Mendelian","Genes","Diabetes","Cancer","Heart_disease","Stroke","Clinical_depression","Asthma","Pharmacological","Full_genome_sequencing","DNA","Single_nucleotide_polymorphism","Allele","Chromosomes","Sex_chromosomes","Genotype","Genotyping","Mutation","Genetic_recombination","Haplotype","Tag_SNP","Haplotypes","Ibadan","Nigeria","European_ethnic_groups","Tokyo","Japan","Han_Chinese","Beijing","China","Thomas_J._Hudson","McGill_University","Montreal","Huanming_Yang","Beijing","Shanghai","Hong_Kong","Yusuke_Nakamura","University_of_Tokyo","David_R._Bentley","Sanger_Institute","Mark_Chee","Arnold_Oliphant","Illumina_(company)","San_Diego","David_Altshuler","Broad_Institute","Cambridge,_Massachusetts","Mitochondrion","Richard_A._Gibbs","Baylor_College_of_Medicine","Houston","Pui-Yan_Kwok","University_of_California,_San_Francisco","DbSNP","Perlegen_Sciences","Affymetrix","Genotypes","Haplotypes","Haploview","Genealogical_DNA_test","The_1000_Genomes_Project","Population_groups_in_biomedicine","Human_Variome_Project","Human_genetic_variation"]}
