While most traditions\ndiscourage celibacy, all encourage strict chastity and modesty with regards to\nany relationships across gender lines, holding forth that intimacy as perceived\nwithin Islam â encompassing a swathe of life more broad than strictly sex â is\nlargely to be reserved for marriage. This sensitivity to gender difference and\nmodesty ([[hijab]]) outside of marriage can be seen in current prominent aspects\nof Islam â interpretations of Islamic dress and degrees of gender segregation,\nfor example.\n\nWhile prohibitions against extra-marital sexual relationships are strong, sex\nitself is not a taboo subject. Permissible sexual relationships are described in\nas great wells of love and closeness for the couple involved. Specific occasions\nâ most notably daytime fasting and menstruation â are times forbidden for\nintercourse, though not for other ways of touching and being close to one\nanother. Issues such as abortion (other than for medical risk to the pregnant\nwoman) and homosexuality are also strictly forbidden; contraceptive use is\npermitted for birth control.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Islamic_sexual_jurisprudence","recorded":1372152743,"links":[],"instances":["biblical"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Sexuality in Islam","Fiqh"],"headings":["Sex within marriage","Sexual techniques","Extramarital sexual intercourse (fornication and adultery and homosexuality)","Illegal sex (fornication)","Homosexuality","Concubines","Rape","Restrictions on sex","Sodomy","Times to avoid sexual intercourse","Purification and hygiene","Fasting and Ramadan","Menstruation","Masturbation","Contraception","Abortion","See also","Notes","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["lot","biblical"]],"members":["lot"],"related":["Islamic_marital_jurisprudence","Human_sexuality","Quran","Muhammad","Celibacy","Chastity","Islam","Sartorial_hijab","Sex_segregation_and_Islam","Birth_control","Homosexuality","Lot_(Biblical)","Book_of_Genesis","Sharia","Hirabah","Stoning","Hajj","Umrah","Yusuf_al-Qaradawi","Sunni","List_of_modern-day_Muslim_scholars","Sodomy","Haraam","Islamic_marriage_contract","Ghusl","Muhaddith","Condom","Sunnah","Sunan_Abu_Dawud","Mutah","Misyar","Wedad_Lootah","Marriage_in_Islam","BRILL"]}
