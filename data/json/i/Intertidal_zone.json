{"cursor":"9416","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\n\nThe 'intertidal zone', also known as the 'foreshore' and 'seashore' and\nsometimes referred to as the littoral zone, is the area that is above water at\nlow tide and under water at high tide (in other words, the area between tide\nmarks). This area can include many different types of habitats, with many types\nof animals like starfish, sea urchins, and some species of coral. The well known\narea also includes steep rocky cliffs, sandy beaches, or wetlands (e.g., vast\nmudflats). The area can be a narrow strip, as in Pacific islands that have only\na narrow tidal range, or can include many metres of shoreline where shallow\nbeach slopes interact with high tidal excursion.\n\nOrganisms in the intertidal zone are adapted to an environment of harsh\nextremes. Water is available regularly with the tides but varies from fresh with\nrain to highly saline and dry salt with drying between tidal inundations. The\naction of waves can dislodge residents in the littoral zone. With the intertidal\nzone's high exposure to the sun, the temperature range can be anything from very\nhot with full sun to near freezing in colder climates. Some microclimates in the\nlittoral zone are ameliorated by local features and larger plants such as\nmangroves. Adaptation in the littoral zone allows the use of nutrients supplied\nin high volume on a regular basis from the sea which is actively moved to the\nzone by tides. Edges of habitats, in this case land and sea, are themselves\noften significant ecologies, and the littoral zone is a prime example.\n\nA typical rocky shore can be divided into a spray zone or splash zone (also\nknown as the supratidal zone), which is above the spring high-tide line and is\ncovered by water only during storms, and an intertidal zone, which lies between\nthe high and low tidal extremes. Along most shores, the intertidal zone can be\nclearly separated into the following subzones: high tide zone, middle tide zone,\nand low tide zone. The intertidal zone is one of a number of marine biomes or\nhabitats, including estuaries, neritic, surface and deep zones.\n","linknr":406,"url":"Intertidal_zone","recorded":1362371976,"links":41,"instances":["character","body_plan"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Aquatic ecology","Marine biology","Fisheries","Coastal geography","Coastal and oceanic landforms","Tides","Physical oceanography"],"headings":["Zonation","Low tide zone (lower littoral)","Ecology","Legal issues","Other media","Gallery","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e6/Newport_beach.jpg/220px-Newport_beach.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c3/Bancao_Beach_at_Low_Tide_showing_Intertidal_Zone_from_about_200_meters_from_the_beach.jpg/220px-Bancao_Beach_at_Low_Tide_showing_Intertidal_Zone_from_about_200_meters_from_the_beach.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b5/Tide_pools_at_Pillar_Point_7.jpg/220px-Tide_pools_at_Pillar_Point_7.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c8/Intertide_zonation_at_Kalaloch.jpg/220px-Intertide_zonation_at_Kalaloch.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/Pteropurpura_trialata_is_laying_the_eggs_1.jpg/220px-Pteropurpura_trialata_is_laying_the_eggs_1.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/45/CornishMussels.JPG/120px-CornishMussels.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/24/CornishBarnacles.JPG/120px-CornishBarnacles.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Micro-climate_on_rock_at_Sunrise-on-_Sea.jpg/120px-Micro-climate_on_rock_at_Sunrise-on-_Sea.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3d/Life_around_stone_at_Sunrise-on-Sea.jpg/120px-Life_around_stone_at_Sunrise-on-Sea.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/48/Accreting_coast_Image6.svg/140px-Accreting_coast_Image6.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/58/Fernando_noronha.jpg/140px-Fernando_noronha.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["tube_worm","body_plan"],["spongebob_squarepants","character"]],"members":["spongebob_squarepants","tube_worm"],"related":["Littoral_zone","Water","Low_tide","High_tide","Cliff","Beach","Wetlands","Mudflat","Pacific_island","Organism","Water","Tide","Rain","Seawater","Salt","Ocean_surface_wave","Temperature","Sun","Microclimate","Mangrove","Adaptation","Nutrient","Sea","Ecosystem","Rocky_shore","Shore","Marine_biomes","Habitat","Estuaries","Neritic","Epipelagic_zone","Profundal_zone","USA","Splash_zone","Wave_action","Rocky_shore","Tide_pool","Morecambe_Bay","Quicksand","Seaweed","Abalone","Sea_anemone","Brown_seaweed","Chiton","Crab","Green_algae","Hydroid","Isopod","Limpet","Mussel","Nudibranch","Sculpin","Holothuroidea","Sea_lettuce","Sea_palm","Sea_star","Sea_urchin","Shrimp","Snail","Sponge","Phyllospadix_scouleri","Tube_worm_(body_plan)","Whelk","Energy","Sunlight","Photosynthesis","Salinity","Predator","Fish","Ecology","Urchin","Sea_anemone","Barnacle","Isopods","Sea_stars","Gastropod","Mollusc","New_Zealand_foreshore_and_seabed_controversy","United_States","Massachusetts","UK","The_Crown","John_of_England","Udal_Law","Orkney","Shetland","Stephen_Hillenburg","SpongeBob_SquarePants_(character)","Cornwall","Barnacles","Limpets","Tidal_pool","South_Africa","Ballantine_Scale","Ecological_forecasting","NaGISA"]}
