The concept behind\ninterventional radiology is to diagnose and treat patients using the least\ninvasive techniques currently available in order to minimize risk to the\npatient and improve health outcomes.\n\nAs the inventors of angioplasty and the catheter-delivered stent, interventional\nradiologists pioneered modern minimally-invasive medicine. Using X-rays, CT,\nultrasound, MRI, and other imaging modalities, interventional radiologists\nobtain images which are then used to direct interventional instruments\nthroughout the body. These procedures are usually performed using needles and\nnarrow tubes called catheters, rather than by making large incisions into the\nbody as in traditional surgery.\n\nMany conditions that once required surgery can now be treated non-surgically by\ninterventional radiologists. By minimizing the physical trauma to the patient,\nperipheral interventions can reduce infection rates and recovery time, as well\nas shorten hospital stays.
