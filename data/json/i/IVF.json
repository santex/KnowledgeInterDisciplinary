IVF is a major treatment for infertility\nwhen other methods of assisted reproductive technology have failed. The\nprocess involves monitoring a woman's ovulatory process, removing ovum or ova\n(egg or eggs) from the woman's ovaries and letting sperm fertilise them in a\nfluid medium in a laboratory. When a woman's natural cycle is monitored to\ncollect a naturally selected ovum (egg) for fertilisation, it is known as\nnatural cycle IVF. The fertilised egg (zygote) is then transferred to the\npatient's uterus with the intention of establishing a successful pregnancy.\nThe first successful birth of a \"test tube baby\", Louise Brown, occurred in\n1978. Louise Brown was born as a result of natural cycle IVF. Robert G.\nEdwards, the physiologist who developed the treatment, was awarded the Nobel\nPrize in Physiology or Medicine in 2010.\n\nThe term [[in vitro]], from the Latin meaning in glass, is used, because early\nbiological experiments involving cultivation of tissues outside the living\norganism from which they came, were carried out in glass containers such as\n[[beaker (glassware)|beakers]], [[test tube]]s, or [[petri dish]]es. Today, the\nterm in vitro is used to refer to any biological procedure that is performed\noutside the organism it would normally be occurring in, to distinguish it from\nan [[in vivo]] procedure, where the tissue remains inside the living organism\nwithin which it is normally found. A colloquial term for babies conceived as\nthe result of IVF, \"test tube babies\", refers to the tube-shaped containers of\nglass or plastic resin, called test tubes, that are commonly used in chemistry\nlabs and biology labs. However, in vitro fertilisation is usually performed in\nthe shallower containers called Petri dishes. One IVF method, Autologous\nEndometrial Coculture, is actually performed on organic material, but is still\nconsidered in vitro.\n","linknr":1223,"url":"IVF","recorded":1362480655,"links":71,"instances":["japan","australia","medicine","human","physician","human_embryo","genetics","united_states","american_scientist","disambiguation"],"pdf":["http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/pdf/CG011publicinfoenglish.pdf","http://berghahnbooksonline.com/journals/ame/pdfs/2006/1-1/AM010104.pdf","http://www.capitol.tn.gov/Bills/106/Fiscal/HB2159.pdf","http://www.capitol.tn.gov/Bills/106/Fiscal/HB2159.pdf","http://www.sma.org.sg/smj/4603/4603a4.pdf","http://www.sma.org.sg/smj/4603/4603a4.pdf"],"categories":["Fertility","In
