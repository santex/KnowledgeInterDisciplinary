{"cursor":"5778","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'IDLH' is an acronym for 'Immediately Dangerous to Life or Health', and is\ndefined by the US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)\nas exposure to airborne contaminants that is \"likely to cause death or immediate\nor delayed permanent adverse health effects or prevent escape from such an\nenvironment.\" Examples include smoke or other poisonous gases at sufficiently\nhigh concentrations.\n\nThe OSHA regulation (1910.134(b)) defines the term as \"an atmosphere that poses\nan immediate threat to life, would cause irreversible adverse health effects, or\nwould impair an individual's ability to escape from a dangerous\natmosphere.\"\n\nIDLH values are often used to guide the selection of breathing apparatus that\nare made available to workers or firefighters in specific situations.\n\nThe NIOSH definition does not include oxygen deficiency (below 19.5 percent)\nalthough atmosphere-supplying breathing apparatus is also required. Examples\ninclude high altitudes and unventilated, confined spaces.\n\nThe OSHA definition is arguably broad enough to include oxygen-deficient\ncircumstances in the absence of \"airborne contaminants,\" as well as many other\nchemical, thermal, or pneumatic hazards to life or health (e.g., pure helium,\nsuper-cooled or super-heated air, hyperbaric or hypo-baric or submerged\nchambers, etc.). It also uses the broader term \"impair\", rather than \"prevent\",\nwith respect to the ability to escape. For example, blinding but non-toxic smoke\ncould be considered IDLH under the OSHA definition if it would impair the\nability to escape a \"dangerous\" but not life-threatening atmosphere (such as\ntear gas).\n\nThe OSHA definition is part of a legal standard, which is the minimum legal\nrequirement. Users or employers are encouraged to apply proper judgment to avoid\ntaking unnecessary risks, even if the only immediate hazard is \"reversible\",\nsuch as temporary pain, disorientation, nausea, or non-toxic contamination.\n","linknr":164,"url":"Immediately_Dangerous_to_Life_and_Health","recorded":1362891375,"links":13,"instances":["nerve_agent","medical","nerve_agent"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Chemical safety","Firefighting","Occupational Safety and Health Administration","National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health","Health standards"],"headings":["Examples","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["hypoxia","medical"],["tabun","nerve_agent"],["vx","nerve_agent"]],"members":["tabun","hypoxia","vx"],"related":["National_Institute_for_Occupational_Safety_and_Health","Occupational_Safety_and_Health_Administration","Hypoxia_(medical)","Carbon_dioxide","Trifluorobromomethane","Methyl_alcohol","Ethanol","Acetone","Propane","Isopropyl_alcohol","Acetaldehyde","Carbon_monoxide","Octane","Turpentine","Styrene","Chloroform","Benzene","Toluene","Ammonia","Phenol","Carbon_tetrachloride","Sulfur_dioxide","Nitric_oxide","Hydrogen_Sulfide","Acetic_acid","Hydrogen_cyanide","Phosphine","Nickel_tetracarbonyl","Fluorine","Nitric_acid","Nitrogen_dioxide","Chlorine_trifluoride","Formaldehyde","Diborane","Chlorine","Benzyl_chloride","Dimethyl_sulfate","Ozone","Stibine","Tetramethylsuccinonitrile","Chlorine_dioxide","Tetranitromethane","Bromine","Methyl_isocyanate","Arsine","Toluene_diisocyanate","Iodine","Nickel_carbonyl","Diazomethane","Selenium_hexafluoride","Acrolein","Phosgene","Chloropicrin","Hydrogen_selenide","Tellurium_hexafluoride","Pentaborane","Disulfur_decafluoride","Sulfur_mustard","Tabun_(nerve_agent)","Sarin","Soman","Cyclosarin","VX_(nerve_agent)"]}
