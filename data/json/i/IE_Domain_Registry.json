{"cursor":"7100","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nThe 'IE Domain Registry' ('IEDR') is the domain name registry for the .ie\ncountry code top-level domain. Formally, the IE Domain Registry Limited is a\nprivate company, limited by guarantee, incorporated in Ireland having its\nregistered office and principal place of business in Sandycove, County Dublin.\nIt operates on a not-for-profit basis and is a member of the CENTR\nrepresentative body. IE Domain Registry Limited took over the administration of\n.ie in July 2000. Prior to that, the .ie ccTLD had been administered by\nUniversity College Dublin.\n\nThe IE Domain Registry (IEDR) operates a managed registry model for Irelandâs\nnational .ie domain. The managed registry model requires that all applicants\nprovide evidence authenticating their claim to their chosen .ie domain name at\nthe time of application. Applicants must show that the domain they are applying\nfor is related to their company, business, association or trademarked name.\nCompany names and trademarks are often self-evident. Sole Traders and small\nbusinesses and some companies use Registered Business Name (RBN) certificates\nthat are acquired by registering a business name through the Irish Companies\nRegistration Office [http://www.cro.ie].\n\nThe .ie ccTLD has a Registry - Resellers model. The .ie Resellers are the\nequivalent of Registrars in the standard Registry - Registrars model. However\nbecoming a .ie Reseller requires that the reseller has over 200 registered .ie\ndomains or is at least the billing contact on over 200 .ie domains, provides a\n2500 Euro bond, passes a credit check and has a demonstrable knowledge of IEDR\ndomain name policies and technical procedures.\n\nIn 2001, IEDR had a rule prohibiting the registration of generic .ie domain\nnames. In the first quarter of 2001, 73 domains were registered by a now\ndissolved company, On-Line Media Limited. Many of these domains were generic in\nnature despite IEDR's \"Generic Rule\" being in force at the time. In October that\nyear, approximately 322 domains based on generic medical terms were directly\nregistered by Medical Pages (Ireland) Limited in what was certainly Domain name\nwarehousing. The \"Generic Rule\" was changed immediately after this incident to\npermit the registration of generic domains in .ie ccTLD. IEDR had been\nconservative when it came to the issue of the registration of surnames as\ndomains though this has eased recently.\n\nInternal IEDR disputes and disagreements with the Irish internet industry had so\nbadly affected the credibility of .ie ccTLD that government intervention was\nnecessary. In 2004, the government announced that the state communications\nregulator, ComReg, would take control of the .ie domain. The legislation\ncovering this change was signed into law in 2007. In effect, the move has ComReg\ncontrolling policy while IEDR continues to run the .ie ccTLD.\n\nIEDR has improved registration services over the last few years. Registering a\n.ie domain is now more automated with .ie registrations typically going live\nwithin 12 hours during weekdays. Previously, it had been an intensively manual\nprocess based on e-mail submissions and faxed paperwork. A web interface for .ie\nResellers and an API which enables .ie Resellers to integrate .ie registration\nprocedures with their own systems are partially responsible for the more\nefficient registration process.\n\nThe wholesale price (the price charged to .ie Resellers) of .ie domains has\nfallen over the past few years as the .ie ccTLD has grown. It fell again by 14%\nin January 2007. This follows reductions of 20% in 2006, 12.5% in 2005 and 10%\nin 2004 in the wholesale price of .ie domains. However when compared with the\ncost of a .com, a .ie domain can be three to ten times more expensive.\n\nThe Irish domain hosting industry has some concerns about IEDR being both the\nRegistry and a Reseller. IEDR has maintained a more expensive price for direct\nregistrations so as not to compete directly with .ie Resellers. Most new .ie\nregistrations are now made via .ie Resellers.\n\nIn March 2006, The IE Domain Registry (IEDR), the company leading the IENUM\nconsortium, won the competition to provide a commercial registry for the supply\nof ENUM (Electronic Numbering) services in Ireland . The IEDR's partner in the\nIENUM consortium is Internet Privatstiftung Austria (IPA), the Austrian\norganisation which operates the .at domain name and provided the first ENUM\ncommercial registry service in the world.\n","linknr":105,"url":"IE_Domain_Registry","recorded":1375073753,"links":["/w/index.php?title=IE_Domain_Registry&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=IE_Domain_Registry&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:INCITE","/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Fact_and_Reference_Check","/wiki/Wikipedia:When_to_cite","/wiki/File:Iedr_logo_anim.gif","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/00/Iedr_logo_anim.gif","/wiki/Domain_name_registry","/wiki/.ie","/wiki/Country_code_top-level_domain","/wiki/Not-for-profit","/wiki/CENTR","/wiki/.ie","/wiki/University_College_Dublin","http://www.cro.ie","/wiki/Domain_name_warehousing","/wiki/Commission_for_Communications_Regulation","/wiki/API","/w/index.php?title=IE_Domain_Registry&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/.ie","http://www.oireachtas.ie/viewdoc.asp?fn=/documents/bills28/bills/2007/0807/b08d07d.pdf","http://www.dcmnr.gov.ie/NR/rdonlyres/1C5B4C34-BBEA-4D94-917E-03ED04D4C005/0/RIACommunicationsRegulationAmendmentBill2007.doc","/w/index.php?title=IE_Domain_Registry&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Communications_in_Ireland","/w/index.php?title=IE_Domain_Registry&action=edit&section=3","http://www.domainregistry.ie/","http://whoisireland.com/ienews-ministerregulatesiedr.html","http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/04/13/ireland_ie_control/","http://www.dcmnr.gov.ie/Press+Releases/Archive/Dermot+Ahern+Announces+Transfer+of++ie+to+Communications+Regulator.htm","http://www.oireachtas.ie/viewdoc.asp?DocID=6862","http://www.nic.at/en/index/","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=IE_Domain_Registry&oldid=552006214","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Internet_governance_organizations","/wiki/Category:Media_in_the_Republic_of_Ireland","/wiki/Category:Organisations_based_in_the_Republic_of_Ireland","/wiki/Category:Science_and_technology_in_the_Republic_of_Ireland","/wiki/Category:University_College_Dublin","/wiki/Category:Articles_lacking_in-text_citations_from_April_2011","/wiki/Category:All_articles_lacking_in-text_citations","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=IE+Domain+Registry&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=IE+Domain+Registry","/wiki/IE_Domain_Registry","/wiki/Talk:IE_Domain_Registry","#","/wiki/IE_Domain_Registry","/w/index.php?title=IE_Domain_Registry&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=IE_Domain_Registry&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/IE_Domain_Registry","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/IE_Domain_Registry","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=IE_Domain_Registry&oldid=552006214","/w/index.php?title=IE_Domain_Registry&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5970602","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=IE_Domain_Registry&id=552006214","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=IE+Domain+Registry","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=IE+Domain+Registry&oldid=552006214&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=IE_Domain_Registry&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5970602#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_discla
