Nixon Medical\n Historical Library of The University of Texas Health Science Center at San\n Antonio.]] In the history of medicine, 'Islamic medicine', 'Arabic medicine',\n 'Greco-Arabic' and 'Greco-Islamic' refer to medicine developed in the Islamic\n Golden Age, and written in Arabic, the [[lingua franca]] of Islamic\n civilization. The emergence of Islamic medicine came about through the\n interactions of the indigenous Arab tradition with foreign influences. Translation of earlier texts was a fundamental\n building block in the formation of Islamic medicine and the tradition that has\n been passed down.\n\nLatin translations of Arabic medical works had a significant influence on the\ndevelopment of medicine in the high Middle Ages and early Renaissance, as did\nArabic texts which translated the medical works of earlier cultures.\n\nIn the early Islamic and Mack's period (661â750 AD), Muslims believed that Allah\nprovided a treatment for every illness. Around the ninth\ncentury, the Islamic medical community began to develop and utilize a system of\nmedicine based on scientific analysis. The importance of the\nhealth sciences to society was emphasized, and the early Muslim medical\ncommunity strived to find ways to care for the health of the human body.\nMedieval Islam developed hospitals, expanded the practice of surgery, and\neventually integrated women. Important medical thinkers and physicians of Islam\nwere Al-Razi and Ibn Sina. Their knowledge on medicine was recorded in books\nthat were influential in medical schools throughout Muslim history, and Ibn Sina\nin particular (under his Latinized name Avicenna) was also influential on the\nphysicians of later medieval Europe. Throughout the medieval Islamic world,\nmedicine was included under the umbrella of natural philosophy, due to the\ncontinued influence of the Hippocratic Corpus and the ideas of Aristotle and\nGalen. The Hippocratic Corpus was a collection of medical treatises attributed\nto the famous Greek physician Hippocrates of Cos (although it was actually\ncomposed by different generations of authors). The Corpus included a number of\ntreatises which greatly influenced medieval Islamic medical literature.\n","linknr":993,"url":"Islamic_medicine","recorded":1362485532,"links":41,"instances":["ophthalmology"],"pdf":["http://www.ams.ac.ir/aim/0693/0026.pdf","http://www.ams.ac.ir/aim/0693/0026.pdf","http://dergi.samsunilahiyat.com/Makaleler/450713538_05_H%C3%BCseyinKaraman.pdf","http://dergi.samsunilahiyat.com/Makaleler/450713538_05_H%C3%BCseyinKaraman.pdf","http://tim.sums.ac.ir/icarusplus/export/sites/tim/journal-club/download/female_patients_and_practitioners_in_medieval_islam.pdf","http://tim.sums.ac.ir/icarusplus/export/sites/tim/journal-club/download/female_patients_and_practitioners_in_medieval_islam.pdf","http://scielo.isciii.es/pdf/neuro/v17n2/11.pdf","http://scielo.isciii.es/pdf/neuro/v17n2/11.pdf","http://www.ishim.net/ishimj/3/08.pdf"],"categories":["Islamic medicine|","Islamic Golden Age"],"headings":["Terminology","Overview","Medical ethics","Major contributors to Muslim Medicine","Medical Contributions from Medieval Islam","Hospitals","Pharmacy","Women and medicine","Role of Christians","Legacy","See also","Notes and references","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/Canons_of_medicine.JPG/220px-Canons_of_medicine.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg/20px-Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4e/Allah-green.svg/26px-Allah-green.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/Rod_of_Asclepius2.svg/8px-Rod_of_Asclepius2.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/The_Metropolitan_M_Stamp.PNG/28px-The_Metropolitan_M_Stamp.PNG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7f/Palm_Fruit_I_IMG_2100.jpg/90px-Palm_Fruit_I_IMG_2100.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["couching","ophthalmology"]],"members":["couching"],"related":["University_of_Texas_Health_Science_Center_at_San_Antonio","History_of_medicine","Islamic_Golden_Age","Arabic_language","Latin_translations_of_the_12th_century","Medieval_medicine","Medical_Renaissance","Allah","Women_in_medicine","Avicenna","Hippocratic_Corpus","Aristotle","Galen","Hippocrates_of_Cos","Science_in_medieval_Islam","National_Library_of_Medicine","Arabia","Muhammad","Hellenistic_medicine","Unani","History_of_India","Ayurveda","Ancient_Iranian_Medicine","Academy_of_Gundishapur","Ancient_Greece","Ancient_Rome","Hippocrates","Galen","Dioscorides","Medical_ethics","Ishaq_ibn_'Ali_al-Ruhawi","Deontology","Ali_ibn_Sahl_Rabban_al-Tabari","Child_development","Psychology","Psychotherapy","Counseling","Sushruta","Chanakya","'Ali_ibn_al-'Abbas_al-Majusi","Muhammad_ibn_Zakariya_al-Razi","Al-Razi","Small-pox","Measles","Ibn_Sina","Avicenna","Angelology","Ibn_al-Nafis","Galen","Pulmonary_circulation","William_Harvey","Ancient_Greeks","Ibn_al-Haytham","Latin","William_Beaumont","Galen","Al-Baghdadi","Egypt","Cairo","Mandible","Galen","Al-Baghdadi","Egypt","Poppy","Hemp","Poppy","Hemp","India","Dioscorides","Gallbladder_stones","Fevers","Indigestion","Pleurisy","Opium","Bloodletting","Cauterization","Phlebotomist","Cupping_therapy","Phlebotomy","Trachoma","Cataracts","Vascularization","Cornea","Peritomy","Pterygium","Conjunctiva","Couching_(ophthalmology)","Sclera","Anesthesia","Antisepsis","Mercuric_chloride","Bimaristan","Muhammad","Madinah","Battle_of_the_Trench","Al-Walid_ibn_Abd_al-Malik","Damascus","Leprosy","Harun_al-Rashid","Jabril_ibn_Bukhtishu","Waqf","Abbasid_Caliphate","Al-Muqtadir","Muhtasib","Sinan_ibn_Thabit","Pharmacy","Al-Biruni","Gynecology","Obstetrics","Womb","Schizophrenia","Ibn_Zuhr","Almohad","Abu_Yusuf_Ya'qub_al-Mansur","Surgeon","Şerafeddin_Sabuncuoğlu","Prophetic_medicine","Midwives","Wet_nurse","Jundishapur","Jundishapur","Shapur_I","Khuzestan","Iran","Syriac","Khusraw_I","Greece","Nestorian_Christian","Edessa,_Mesopotamia","Urfa","Athens","Christian","Baghdad","Daud_al-Antaki","Evidence_based_medicine","Anatomy_Charts_of_the_Arabs","Bimaristan","Ibn_Sina_Academy_of_Medieval_Medicine_and_Sciences","Inventions_in_the_Islamic_world","Islamic_Bioethics","Islamic_Golden_Age","Medieval_medicine","Science_in_the_medieval_Islamic_world","De_Gradibus","Unani","Encyclopedia_of_the_History_of_Arabic_Science","Routledge","National_Library_of_Medicine","UCL_Centre_for_the_History_of_Medicine","National_Library_of_Medicine"]}
