This concept differs from a dependence relationship, where some\nmembers are dependent and some are not.\n\nIn an interdependent relationship, participants may be emotionally,\neconomically, ecologically and/or morally reliant on and responsible to each\nother. An interdependent relationship can arise between two or more cooperative\nautonomous participants (e.g. - co-op). Some people advocate freedom or\nindependence as the ultimate good; others do the same with devotion to one's\nfamily, community, or society. Interdependence can be a common ground between\nthese aspirations.\n","title":"interdependence","headings":["History","Measuring international interdependence","Role of interdependence in feminist philosophy","Business and commerce","Quotes","See also","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["4: Stephen_Covey","2: Mahatma_Gandhi","2: Martin_Luther_King_Jr.","1: Co-op","1: Independence","1: Family","1: Community","1: Society","1: Karl_Marx","1: Franklin_Delano_Roosevelt","1: Communist_Manifesto","1: Self-sufficiency","1: Civilizations","1: Roman_Empire","1: International_trade","1: Protectionism","1: Devaluation","1: Deflation","1: Ethics_of_care","1: Nel_Noddings","1: Teacher's_College_Press","1: Carol_Gilligan","1: Technology","1: William_James","1: Young_India","1: Franklin_D._Roosevelt","1: John_Muir","1: I_have_a_dream","1: Letter_from_Birmingham_Jail","1: The_Seven_Habits_of_Highly_Effective_People","1: Federico_Mayor","1: First_Epistle_to_the_Corinthians","1: Declaration_of_Interdependence","1: Globalization","1: Interconnectivity","1: Interconnectedness","1: Integral_thought","1: Spirituality","1: Joint_decision_trap","1: Monism","1: Pratitya-samutpada","1: Social_cohesion"]}
