The\nDepartment of State Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (DDTC) interprets and\nenforces ITAR. Its goal is to safeguard U.S. national security and further U.S.\nforeign policy objectives. The related Export Administration\nRegulations (Code of Federal Regulations Title 15 chapter VII, subchapter C)\nare enforced and interpreted by the Bureau of Industry and Security in the\nCommerce Department. The Department of Defense is also involved in the review\nand approval process. Physical enforcement of import and export laws at border\ncrossings is performed by Customs and Border Protection, an agency of the\nDepartment of Homeland Security.\n\nFor practical purposes, ITAR regulations dictate that information and material\npertaining to defense and military related technologies (for items listed on the\nU.S. Munitions List) may only be shared with U.S. Persons unless authorization\nfrom the Department of State is received or a special exemption is used. U.S. Persons (including organizations) can face\nheavy fines if they have, without authorization or the use of an exemption,\nprovided foreign (non-US) persons with access to ITAR-protected defense\narticles, services or technical data.\n\nThe U.S. Munitions List changes over time. Until 1996â1997, ITAR classified\nstrong cryptography as arms and prohibited their export from the U.S.\nAnother change occurred as a result of Space Systems/Loral's conduct after the\nFebruary 1996 failed launch of the Intelsat 708 satellite. The Department of\nState charged Space Systems/Loral with violating the Arms Export Control Act and\nthe ITAR. As a result, technology pertaining to satellites\nand launch vehicles became more carefully protected.\n\nITAR does not apply to information related to general scientific, mathematical\nor engineering principles that is commonly taught in schools and colleges or\ninformation that is (legitimately) in the public domain. ITAR Â§ 120.10(5);\nITAR Â§ 120.11 http://pmddtc.state.gov/regulations_laws/documents/offi-\ncial_itar/ITAR_Part_120.pdf Nor does it apply to general marketing\ninformation or basic system descriptions. ITAR Â§ 120.10(5) http://pmddtc.st-\nate.gov/regulations_laws/documents/official_itar/ITAR_Part_120.pdf These\nexceptions must, however, be treated with extreme caution: college professors\nhave been prosecuted for breaches of the AECA as a result of access to USML\nitems by foreign graduate students and companies have been penalized\nfor alleged breaches of the AECA for failing to properly remove USML items from\nmaterial used to market defense articles. http://pmddtc.state.gov/complianc-\ne/consent_agreements/pdf/LockheedMartinCorp_DraftChargingLetter_08.pdf The\nU.S. Government has also taken action (albeit unsuccessfully) for the export of\ntechnical data that was (allegedly) already publicly available on the\ninternet.
