{"cursor":"8151","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In color management, an 'ICC profile' is a set of data that characterizes a\ncolor input or output device, or a color space, according to standards\npromulgated by the International Color Consortium (ICC). Profiles describe the\ncolor attributes of a particular device or viewing requirement by defining a\nmapping between the device source or target color space and a profile connection\nspace (PCS). This PCS is either CIELAB (L*a*b*) or CIEXYZ. Mappings may be\nspecified using tables, to which interpolation is applied, or through a series\nof parameters for transformations.\n\nEvery device that captures or displays color can be profiled. Some manufacturers\nprovide profiles for their products, and there are several products [http://www.icg-online.co.uk/rips-rip-solutions-\nc39.html List of rip's] that allow an end user to generate his or her own\ncolor profiles, typically through the use of a tristimulus colorimeter or\npreferably a spectrophotometer.\n\nThe ICC defines the format precisely but does not define algorithms or\nprocessing details. This means there is room for variation between different\napplications and systems that work with ICC profiles. , the current version of\nthe specification is 4.2 [http://www.color.org/v4spec.xalter Version 4 ICC\nSpecification] .\n","linknr":163,"url":"ICC_profile","recorded":1362675885,"links":26,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.color.org/ICC1V42.pdf"],"categories":["Color space"],"headings":["Details","References in standards","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Color_management","Color_space","International_Color_Consortium","Color_space","Lab_color_space","CIE_1931_color_space","Interpolation","Tristimulus_colorimeter","Spectrophotometer","RGB","CMYK","Color_space","Rendering_intent","Gamut","White_point","Chromatic_adaptation","Device_link_profile","De_facto_standard","JPEG","Exif","TIFF","Portable_Network_Graphics","JPEG2000","PDF","Digital_Imaging_and_Communications_in_Medicine","DICOM","PICT","PostScript","PDF","Job_Definition_Format","SVG","Specifications_for_Web_Offset_Publications","CMYK_color_model","United_States","Color_management","Digital_printing","International_Color_Consortium","International_Color_Consortium"]}
