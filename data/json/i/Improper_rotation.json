{"cursor":"2812","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nIn geometry, an 'improper rotation', also called 'rotoreflection' or 'rotary\nreflection' is, depending on context, a linear transformation or affine\ntransformation which is the combination of a rotation about an axis and a\nreflection in a plane perpendicular to the axis.\n\nIn 3D, equivalently it is the combination of a rotation and an inversion in a\npoint on the axis. Therefore it is also called a 'rotoinversion' or 'rotary\ninversion'.\n\nIn both cases the operations commute. Rotoreflection and rotoinversion are the\nsame if they differ in angle of rotation by 180Â°, and the point of inversion is\nin the plane of reflection.\n\nAn improper rotation of an object thus produces a rotation of its mirror image.\nThe axis is called the 'rotation-reflection axis'. This is called an 'n-fold\nimproper rotation' if the angle of rotation is 360Â°/n. The notation\n'S n' (S for Spiegel, German for mirror) denotes the symmetry group\ngenerated by an n-fold improper rotation (not to be confused with the same\nnotation for symmetric groups). The notation \\bar{n} is used for\n'n-fold rotoinversion', i.e. rotation by an angle of rotation of 360Â°/n with\ninversion.\n\nIn the wider sense, an improper rotation is an 'indirect [[isometry]]', i.e., an\nelement of E(3)\\E +(3) (see Euclidean group): it can also be a pure\nreflection in a plane, or have a glide plane. An indirect isometry is an affine\ntransformation with an orthogonal matrix that has a determinant of â1.\n\nA 'proper rotation' is an ordinary rotation. In the wider sense, a proper\nrotation is a 'direct isometry', i.e., an element of E +(3): it can\nalso be the identity, a rotation with a translation along the axis, or a pure\ntranslation. A direct isometry is an affine transformation with an orthogonal\nmatrix that has a determinant of 1.\n\nIn the wider senses, the composition of two improper rotations is a proper\nrotation, and the product of an improper and a proper rotation is an\nimproper rotation.\n\nWhen studying the symmetry of a physical system under an improper rotation\n(e.g., if a system has a mirror symmetry plane), it is important to distinguish\nbetween vectors and pseudovectors (as well as scalars and pseudoscalars, and in\ngeneral; between tensors and pseudotensors), since the latter transform\ndifferently under proper and improper rotations (pseudovectors are invariant\nunder inversion).\n","linknr":106,"url":"Improper_rotation","recorded":1362539299,"links":17,"instances":["mathematics","geometry","mathematics","geometry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Euclidean symmetries","Lie groups"],"headings":["See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/2/d/d/2dd06cdf856c29b21cc99bddf0bf3458.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["rotation","geometry"],["vector","geometry"],["scalar","mathematics"],["pseudoscalar","mathematics"]],"members":["scalar","rotation","pseudoscalar","vector"],"related":["Geometry","Linear_transformation","Affine_transformation","Rotation_(geometry)","Inversion_in_a_point","Angle_of_rotation","Mirror_image","Mirror","Symmetric_group","Euclidean_group","Glide_reflection","Affine_transformation","Orthogonal_matrix","Vector_(geometry)","Pseudovector","Scalar_(mathematics)","Pseudoscalar_(mathematics)","Tensor","Pseudotensor","Isometry","Orthogonal_group"]}
