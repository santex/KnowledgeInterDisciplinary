The idea of a two-way effect is essential in the\nconcept of interaction, as opposed to a one-way causal effect. A closely related\nterm is interconnectivity, which deals with the interactions of interactions\nwithin systems: combinations of many simple interactions can lead to surprising\nemergent phenomena. Interaction has different tailored meanings in various\nsciences. Changes can also involve interaction.\n\nCasual examples of interaction outside of science include:\n\n* Communication of any sort, for example two or more people talking to each\n  other, or communication among groups, organizations, nations or states: trade,\n  migration, foreign relations, transportation,\n* The feedback during the operation of machines such as a computer or tool, for\n  example the interaction between a driver and the position of his or her car on\n  the road: by steering the driver influences this position, by observation this\n  information returns to the driver.\n",
