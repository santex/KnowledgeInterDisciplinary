While illusions distort reality,\nthey are generally shared by most people. Solso, R. L. (2001). Cognitive\npsychology (6th ed.). Boston: Allyn and Bacon. ISBN 0-205-30937-2\nIllusions may occur with more of the human senses than vision, but visual\nillusions, optical illusions, are the most well known and understood. The\nemphasis on visual illusions occurs because vision often dominates the other\nsenses. For example, individuals watching a ventriloquist will perceive the\nvoice is coming from the dummy since they are able to see the dummy mouth the\nwords. McGurk,Hj. & MacDonald, J.(1976). \"Hearing lips and seeing voices\",\nNature 264, 746-748. Some illusions are based on general assumptions the\nbrain makes during perception. These assumptions are made using organizational\nprinciples, like Gestalt, an individual's ability of depth perception and motion\nperception, and perceptual constancy. Other illusions occur because of\nbiological sensory structures within the human body or conditions outside of the\nbody within oneâs physical environment.\n\nThe term illusion refers to a specific form of sensory distortion. Unlike a\nhallucination, which is a distortion in the absence of a stimulus, an illusion\ndescribes a misinterpretation of a true sensation. For example, hearing voices\nregardless of the environment would be a hallucination, whereas hearing voices\nin the sound of running water (or other auditory source) would be an illusion.\n\nMimes are known for a repertoire of illusions that are created by physical\nmeans. The mime artist creates an illusion of acting upon or being acted upon by\nan unseen object. These illusions exploit the audience's assumptions about the\nphysical world. Well known examples include \"walls\", \"climbing stairs\",\n\"leaning\", \"descending ladders\", \"pulling and pushing\" etc.\n","linknr":237,"url":"Illusion","recorded":1362544093,"links":55,"instances":["illusion","sense"],"pdf":["http://www.roblesdelatorre.com/gabriel/GR-VH-Nature2001.pdf"],"categories":["Illusions|","Reality","Perception","Sensory system"],"headings":["Optical illusions","Auditory illusions","Tactile illusions","Other senses","Disorders","Neuroscience","Philosophy and Illusion","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a1/Regional_Science_Centre%2C_Bhopal_-_Head_on_a_Platter.jpg/220px-Regional_Science_Centre%2C_Bhopal_-_Head_on_a_Platter.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/Grey_square_optical_illusion.PNG/250px-Grey_square_optical_illusion.PNG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/d1/Rabindranath_Tagore.jpg/170px-Rabindranath_Tagore.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["hearing","sense"],["maya","illusion"],["maya","illusion"]],"members":["maya","hearing"],"related":["Sense","Human_brain","Cognitive_psychology","Optical_illusion","Visual_perception","Ventriloquist","Perception","Gestalt_psychology","Depth_perception","Subjective_constancy","Human_body","Hallucination","Mime_artist","Optical_illusion","Visual_perception","Percept","Auditory_illusion","Hearing_(sense)","Sound","Shepard_tone","Phantom_limb","Thermal_grill_illusion","Cutaneous_rabbit_illusion","Technology_Review","Olfactory","Fortification_illusions","Spirituality","Maya_(illusion)","Argument_from_illusion","Augmented_reality","Delusion","Dream_argument","Holography","Illusion_costume","Simulated_reality","Maya_(illusion)","Illusion_of_control","Implicit_memory","Illusion_of_validity","Illusion_Mini_Keelboat","Subjective"]}
