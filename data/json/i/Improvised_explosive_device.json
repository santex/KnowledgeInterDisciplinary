It may be constructed of conventional military explosives, such\nas an artillery round, attached to a detonating mechanism.\n\nIEDs may be used in terrorist actions or in unconventional warfare by guerrillas\nor commando forces in a theater of operations. In the second Iraq War, IEDs were\nused extensively against US-led Coalition forces and by the end of 2007 they had\nbecome responsible for approximately 63% of Coalition deaths in Iraq. They are also used in Afghanistan by insurgent groups, and\nhave caused over 66% of the Coalition casualties in the 2001âpresent Afghanistan\nWar.\n\nIEDs were also used extensively by cadres of the rebel Tamil Tiger (LTTE)\norganization against military targets in Sri Lanka
