{"cursor":"23661","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nIn evolutionary biology and evolutionary psychology, the 'inclusive fitness' of\nan organism is the sum of its classical fitness (how many of its own offspring\nit produces and supports) and the number of equivalents of its own offspring it\ncan add to the population by supporting\nothers. [http://www.personalityresearch.org/evolutionary/inclusive.html\nDefinition and explanation of inclusive fitness from Personality\nResearch.org] Advocates of inclusive fitness theory say that an organism\ncan improve its overall genetic success by altruistic social behavior.\n\nFrom the gene's point of view, evolutionary success ultimately depends on\nleaving behind the maximum number of copies of itself in the population. Until\n1964, it was generally believed that genes only achieved this by causing the\nindividual to leave the maximum number of viable offspring. However, in 1964 W.\nD. Hamilton proved mathematically that, because close relatives of an organism\nshare some identical genes, a gene can also increase its evolutionary success by\npromoting the reproduction and survival of these related or otherwise similar\nindividuals.\n\nBelding's ground squirrel provides an example. The ground squirrel gives an\nalarm call to warn its local group of the presence of a predator. By emitting\nthe alarm, it gives its own location away, putting itself in more danger. In the\nprocess, however, the squirrel protects its relatives within the local group\n(along with the rest of the group). Therefore, if protecting the other squirrels\nin the immediate area will lead to the passing on of more of the squirrelâs own\ngenes than the squirrel could leave by reproducing on its own, then natural\nselection will favor giving the alarm call, provided that a sufficient fraction\nof the shared genes include the gene(s) predisposing to the alarm\ncall. Mateo JM, 1996. [http://mateolab.uchicago.edu/mateo_devt_antipred.pdf\nThe development of alarm-call response behavior in free-living juvenile\nBelding's ground squirrels]. Animal Behaviour '52':489-505. Further study\nhas shown that the self-reported likelihood of risking one's life to save\nother's life is directly a function of the degree of genetic relatedness to the\nhelper (Burnstein et al., 1994)\n\nSynalpheus regalis, a eusocial shrimp, also is an example of an organism that\nseeks to increase its inclusive fitness. The larger defenders protect the young\njuveniles in the colony from outsiders. By ensuring the young's survival, the\ngenes will continue to be passed onto future generations. \n\nInclusive fitness is more generalized than strict kin selection, which requires\nthat the shared genes are identical by descent. Inclusive fitness is not limited\nto cases where kin are involved.\n","linknr":267,"url":"Inclusive_fitness","recorded":1362483809,"links":22,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://mateolab.uchicago.edu/mateo_devt_antipred.pdf","http://www.vims.edu/research/units/labgroups/marine_biodiversity/publications/_pdf/Duffy_et_al_2002_BES.PDF","http://www.vims.edu/research/units/labgroups/marine_biodiversity/publications/_pdf/Duffy_et_al_2002_BES.PDF"],"categories":["Evolutionary biology"],"headings":["Hamilton's rule","Inclusive fitness and altruism","Green-Beard effects","Inclusive fitness and parental care","See also","Sources","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/CollapsedtreeLabels-simplified.svg/200px-CollapsedtreeLabels-simplified.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/Tree_of_life.svg/16px-Tree_of_life.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/Office-book.svg/16px-Office-book.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/d/6/1/d6120ee83dee01893c0dc4b24861fa27.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/3/1/e3159ed813ff9798e1547b8a94fa78b2.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/6/0/560775887485101d093e4f17bd400222.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/2/0/e20b66269882d781ddca343afdcb34e2.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/b/4/4b43b0aee35624cd95b910189b3dc231.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/b/4/4b43b0aee35624cd95b910189b3dc231.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/b/4/4b43b0aee35624cd95b910189b3dc231.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/b/4/4b43b0aee35624cd95b910189b3dc231.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Evolutionary_biology","Evolutionary_psychology","Population","W.D._Hamilton","Belding's_ground_squirrel","Natural_selection","Synalpheus_regalis","Eusocial","Shrimp","Kin_selection","Sociobiology","Martin_Nowak","Martin_Nowak","Corina_Tarnita","EO_Wilson","Ad_hoc","Altruism","Identical_by_descent","Green-beard_effect","Crocodile","Tangle_web_spider","Gene-centered_view_of_evolution","Evolutionary_psychology","Criticism_of_evolutionary_psychology","Kin_selection","Reproductive_success","R/K_selection_theory","Robin_Fox"]}
