The civilization was spread over some\n | 1,260,000 kmÂ², making it the largest known ancient civilization.\n\nThe Indus Valley is one of the world's earliest urban civilizations, along with\nits contemporaries, Mesopotamia and Ancient Egypt. At its peak, the Indus\nCivilization may have had a population of well over five million. Inhabitants of\nthe ancient Indus river valley developed new techniques in handicraft (carnelian\nproducts, seal carving) and metallurgy (copper, bronze, lead, and tin). The\ncivilization is noted for its cities built of brick, roadside drainage system,\nand multistoried houses.\n\nThe Indus Valley Civilization is also known as the 'Harappan Civilization', as\nthe first of its cities to be unearthed was located at Harappa, excavated in the\n1920s in what was at the time the Punjab province of British India (now in\nPakistan). Excavation of Harappan sites has been ongoing since 1920,\nwith important breakthroughs occurring as recently as 1999. There\nwere earlier and later cultures, often called Early Harappan and Late Harappan,\nin the same area of the Harappan Civilization. The Harappan civilisation is\nsometimes called the 'Mature Harappan culture' to distinguish it from these\ncultures. Up to 1999, over 1,056 cities and settlements have been found, out of\nwhich 96 have been excavated, mainly in the general region\nof the Indus and Ghaggar-Hakra river and its tributaries. Among the settlements\nwere the major urban centres of Harappa, Lothal, Mohenjo-daro (UNESCO World\nHeritage Site), Dholavira, Kalibanga, and Rakhigarhi.\n\nThe Harappan language is not directly attested and its affiliation is uncertain\nsince the Indus script is still undeciphered. A relationship with the Dravidian\nor Elamo-Dravidian language family is favored by a section of\nscholars.\n","linknr":979,"url":"Indus_Valley_Civilization","recorded":1362373344,"links":122,"instances":["device","archaeologist","unit","mythology","assaying_tool","fruit","archaeology","region","journal","process","british_india","jain_tirthankar"],"pdf":["http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v440/n7085/pdf/440755a.pdf","http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v440/n7085/pdf/440755a.pdf","http://www.safarmer.com/fsw2.pdf","http://www.safarmer.com/fsw2.pdf","http://www.safarmer.com/Refutation3.pdf","http://www.safarmer.com/more.on.Rao.pdf","http://www.ias.ac.in/currsci/oct252004/1141.pdf","http://www.ias.ac.in/currsci/oct252004/1141.pdf","http://www.pnas.org/content/suppl/2012/05/25/1112743109.DCSupplemental/pnas.1112743109_SI.pdf","http://www.pnas.org/content/suppl/2012/05/25/1112743109.DCSupplemental/pnas.1112743109_SI.pdf","http://www.ejvs.laurasianacademy.com/ejvs0501/ejvs0501article.pdf","http://www.ejvs.laurasianacademy.com/ejvs0501/ejvs0501article.pdf","http://www.harappa.com/script/indusscript.pdf","http://www.harappa.com/script/indusscript.pdf","http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~witzel/IndusLang.pdf","http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~witzel/IndusLang.pdf"],"categories":["Indus
