The process is described by both the words interpreting and\ninterpretation. Translation studies deal with the systematic study of the\ntheory, the description and the application of language interpretation and\ntranslation.<ref>S. Bassnett, Translation studies, p.13-37</ref>\n\nIn professional parlance, interpreting denotes the facilitating of communication\nfrom one language form into its equivalent, or approximate equivalent, in\nanother language form; while interpretation denotes the actual product of this\nwork, that is, the message thus rendered into speech, sign language, writing,\nnon-manual signals, or other language form. This important distinction is\nobserved in order to avoid confusion.\n\nAn interpreter is a person who converts a thought or expression in a source\nlanguage into an expression with a comparable meaning in a target language\neither simultaneously in \"real time\" or consecutively after one party has\nfinished speaking. The interpreter's function is to convey every semantic\nelement (tone and register) and every intention and feeling of the message that\nthe source-language speaker is directing to target-language recipients.\n","title":"Language%20interpretation","headings":["Comparison to translation","Modes","Types","Modalities","Venues","See also","Notes","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["3: Interpreting_notes","2: Translation_studies","2: Registry_of_Interpreters_for_the_Deaf","2: Telephone_interpreting","2: European_Union","1: Writing","1: Dictionary","1: Glossary","1: Nuremberg_Trials","1: Muammar_Gaddafi","1: Mireille_Mathieu","1: Translation","1: Interrogation","1: Part-time_job","1: Language_bank","1: Hospital","1: Clinic","1: Culture","1: Video_Remote_Interpreting","1: Video_Relay_Service","1: Deaf","1: Hard-of-hearing","1: Speech_disorder","1: French_Sign_Language","1: Spanish_Sign_Language","1: British_Sign_Language","1: American_Sign_Language","1: Multilingual","1: Interpreters#Sign_language_interpreting","1: Sign_language","1: Natural_language","1: Syntax","1: List_of_video_telecommunication_services_and_product_brands","1: United_Nations","1: African_Union","1: European_Commission","1: Languages_of_the_European_Union","1: European_Parliament","1: European_Court_of_Justice","1: Iraq","1: Afghanistan","1: Chartered_Institute_of_Linguists","1: Institute_of_Translation_&_Interpreting","1: Inttranet","1: Machine_translation","1: New_Zealand_Society_of_Translators_and_Interpreters","1: United_Nations_Interpretation_Service","1: List_of_language_interpreters_in_fiction","1: Danica_Seleskovitch"]}
