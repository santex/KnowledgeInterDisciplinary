At 23 or 24 (assuming the latter dates), she would have been\nconsidered old for a bride in Muscovy, where the common age for marriage was in\nthe mid-teens, and it is not certain why she married so relatively late in life.\nShe became Tsaritsa upon the coronation of her husband in 1584.\n\nThroughout her husband's reign (and, indeed, ever since her marriage), she was\nexpected to produce a male heir. Fedor was physically and mentally frail and,\nwere he to die without male issue, it was questionable whether his half-brother,\nDmitri, would be considered legitimate, as he was the result of Ivan the\nTerrible's seventh marriage and the Orthodox Church recognized only up to four\nmarriages as legitimate. Indeed, even with Dmitri as a possible successor, Irina\nwas under pressure to produce an heir and in 1585, she traveled to the Trinity-\nSt. Sergei Monastery north of Moscow in hopes of a miraculous cure for her\nalleged infertility, See Giles Fletcher, Of the Rus Commonwealth (Ithaca,\n1966) 120-121; Isolde Thyret, \"'Blessed is the Tsaritsa's Womb': The Myth of\nMiraculous Birth and Royal Motherhood in Muscovite Russia,\" Russian Review 53,\nNo. 4 (Oct. 1994): 494. but still she did not bear a child—a\ndaughter, Feodosia Fedorovna—until 1592, but the girl did not live long\nand died in January 1594. Thyret, \"'Blessed is the Tsaritsa's Womb',\"\n495. The couple's continued infertility led to court intrigue. Thus, in\n1585, Metropolitan Dionysius proposed that Fedor divorce Irina, blaming her for\nbeing infertile and arguing that, for the good of the state and the dynasty, the\nTsar ought to remarry and produce a male heir. The suggestion was seen as an\neffort on the part of the Shuiskies and other boyar clans to undercut the\nGodunovs. In response, Boris Godunov had the metropolitan deposed and confined\nto the Khutyn Monastery just outside Novgorod the Great.\n\nWith the death of Dmitry under strange circumstances in Uglich, north of Moscow,\non 15 May 1591, Irina was placed under increasing pressure to produce an heir as\nthe Rurikid dynasty that had ruled Rus and Muscovy since the ninth century would\nbe extinct if Fedor died without a son, and a bloody succession struggle might\nensue. The couple remained barren for more than a decade, although whether this\nwas due to Fedor's poor health or to infertility on Irina's part was uncertain.\n\nUpon her husband's death on 7 January 1598, it is possible that Irina herself\ncould have taken the throne as the reigning tsaritsa (rather than a mere\nconsort), since the Rurikids in the male line were extinct; that being said, no\nwoman had ever before reigned in her own right in Rus' or Russia. Thus she\nretired (some historians call it an abdication) A. M. Nikolaieff, \"Boris\nGodunov and the Ouglich Tragedy\" Russian Review 9, No. 4 (1950), pp. 275-\n85. to the Novodevichy Monastery (Convent) on the south side of Moscow,\nwhere she took monastic vows under the name Aleksandra. In fact, it was at the\nmonastery that Boris Godunov was asked by Patriarch Job of Moscow and the Zemsky\nSobor to become tsar. Thyret, \"'Blessed is the Tsaritsa's Womb',\" 479-96;\nIdem, Between God and Tsar. Religious Symbolism and the Royal Women of Muscovite\nRussia. DeKalb: Northern Illinois University Press, 2001.\n\nIrina died on 27 October 1603 (others sources give the date 26 September, still\nothers the year 1604) in the Novodevichy Monastery.\n\nSeveral embroideries created by Irina are in the collection of the State Russian\nMuseum on Red Square (along with similar work by Sophia Paleologus, the wife of\nIvan III, and Anastasia, the first wife of Ivan the Terrible.)\n","linknr":132,"url":"Irina_Godunova","recorded":1375084004,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Irina_Godunova&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Irina_Godunova&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Translation_to_english_arrow.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/Translation_to_english_arrow.svg/50px-Translation_to_english_arrow.svg.png","//ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%93%D0%BE%D0%B4%D1%83%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0,_%D0%98%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B0_%D0%A4%D1%91%D0%B4%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%BD%D0%B0","//ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/","http://translate.google.com/translate?&u=http%3A%2F%2Fru.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2F%D0%93%D0%BE%D0%B4%D1%83%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%2C+%D0%98%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B0+%D0%A4%D1%91%D0%B4%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%BD%D0%B0&sl=ru&tl=en","/wiki/Talk:Irina_Godunova","/wiki/Wikipedia:Copying_within_Wikipedia","/wiki/Wikipedia:Translation","/wiki/File:Irina_godunova01_reconstruction.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/Irina_godunova01_reconstruction.jpg/190px-Irina_godunova01_reconstruction.jpg","/wiki/List_of_Russian_consorts","/wiki/Feodor_I_of_Russia","/wiki/Tsarevna_Feodosia_Fedorovna","/wiki/Royal_house","/wiki/Rurik_Dynasty","/wiki/Novodevichy_Monastery","/wiki/Ascension_Convent","/wiki/Kolomenskoye","/wiki/Archangel_Cathedral","/wiki/Moscow_Kremlin","/wiki/Eastern_Orthodox_Church","/wiki/Feodor_I_of_Russia","/wiki/Boris_Godunov","/wiki/Ivan_the_Terrible","/wiki/Muscovy","/wiki/Tsarevich_Dmitry_Ivanovich_of_Russia_(born_1582)","/wiki/Troitse-Sergiyeva_Lavra","#cite_note-1","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Dionysius_II,_Metropolitan_of_Moscow","/wiki/Khutyn_Monastery","/wiki/Novgorod_the_Great","/wiki/Uglich","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Novodevichy_Monastery","/wiki/Patriarch_Job_of_Moscow","/wiki/Zemsky_Sobor","#cite_note-4","/wiki/State_Russian_Museum","/w/index.php?title=Irina_Godunova&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","#cite_ref-2","#cite_ref-3","#cite_ref-4","/wiki/List_of_Russian_rulers","/wiki/Maria_Nagaya","/wiki/List_of_Russian_consorts","/wiki/Maria_Grigorievna_Skuratova-Belskaya","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Irina_Godunova&oldid=563968773","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1557_births","/wiki/Category:1603_deaths","/wiki/Category:Russian_royalty","/wiki/Category:Russian_tsarinas","/wiki/Category:Use_dmy_dates_from_July_2013","/wiki/Category:Articles_to_be_expanded_from_June_2012","/wiki/Category:All_articles_to_be_expanded","/wiki/Category:Articles_needing_translation_from_Russian_Wikipedia","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Irina+Godunova&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Irina+Godunova","/wiki/Irina_Godunova","/wiki/Talk:Irina_Godunova","#","/wiki/Irina_Godunova","/w/index.php?title=Irina_Godunova&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Irina_Godunova&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Irina_Godunova","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Irina_Godunova","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Irina_Godunova&oldid=563968773","/w/index.php?title=Irina_Godunova&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q441555","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Irina_Godunova&id=563968773","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Irina+Godunova","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Irina+Godunova&oldid=563968773&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Irina_Godunova&printable=yes","//bg.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%98%D1%80%D0%B
