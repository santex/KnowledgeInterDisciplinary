{"cursor":"11529","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" image of WS 2 nanotube bundles.]] image of an individual\n WS 2 multi-wall nanotube.]] An 'inorganic nanotube' is a cylindrical\n molecule often composed of metal oxides, and morphologically similar to a\n carbon nanotube. Inorganic nanotubes have been observed to occur naturally in\n some mineral deposits.\n\nAlthough Linus Pauling mentioned the possibility of curved layers in minerals as\nearly as 1930, synthetic inorganic nanotubes did not appear until\nReshef Tenne et al. reported the synthesis of nanotubes composed of tungsten\ndisulfide (WS 2) in 1992.\n\nIn the intervening years, nanotubes have been synthesised of many other\ninorganic materials, such as vanadium oxide and manganese oxide, and are being\nresearched for such applications as redox catalysts and cathode materials for\nbatteries.\n","linknr":278,"url":"Inorganic_nanotube","recorded":1362538822,"links":17,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Nanomaterials"],"headings":["History and occurrence","Materials","Properties and potential applications","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/74/INT-WS2_SEM_image.JPG/220px-INT-WS2_SEM_image.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b2/INT-WS2_TEM.tif/lossy-page1-220px-INT-WS2_TEM.tif.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/ca/NanoToday_cover.jpg/220px-NanoToday_cover.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/91/Core-shell_nanotube.JPG/220px-Core-shell_nanotube.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["tungsten(iv_sulfide"],["tungsten(iv_sulfide"],["tin(iv_sulfide"],["tin(ii_sulfide"],["poly(methyl_methacrylate"]],"members":[],"related":["Nanotube","Nanotube","Cylindrical","Molecule","Metal","Oxide","Carbon_nanotube","Linus_Pauling","Mineral","Reshef_Tenne","Tungsten(IV)_sulfide","Vanadium","Oxide","Manganese","Oxide","Redox","Catalyst","Cathode","Reshef_Tenne","Tungsten(IV)_sulfide","Molybdenum_disulfide","Tin(IV)_sulfide","Tin(II)_sulfide","Titanium_dioxide","Zinc_oxide","Nanowire","Transition_metal","Chalcogen","Halogenides","Molybdenum","Tungsten","Tantalum","Niobium","Chalcogen","Sulfur","Selenium","Halogen","Iodine","Copper","Bismuth","Electrical_conductivity","Polymer","Composite_material","Wear","Photovoltaic","Tensile_stress","Bulletproof_vest","Cellulose","Electrical_conductivity","Polycaprolactone","Percolative","Percolation_threshold","Epoxy","Adhesion","Fracture_toughness","Poly(methyl_methacrylate)","Nanowire"]}
