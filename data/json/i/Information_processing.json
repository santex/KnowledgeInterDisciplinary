As such, it is a process that describes everything\nthat happens (changes) in the universe, from the falling of a rock (a change in\nposition) to the printing of a text file from a digital computer system. In the\nlatter case, an information processor is changing the form of presentation of\nthat text file. Information processing may more specifically be defined in terms\nused by Claude E. Shannon as the conversion of latent information into manifest\ninformation (McGonigle & Mastrian, 2011). Latent and manifest information is\ndefined through the terms of equivocation (remaining uncertainty, what value the\nsender has actually chosen), dissipation (uncertainty of the sender what the\nreceiver has actually received), and transformation (saved effort of questioning\n- equivocation minus dissipation) (Denning and Bell, 2012).\n","linknr":172,"url":"Information_processing","recorded":1362478022,"links":39,"instances":["psychology","philosophy_of_mind"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Information technology","Cognitive science"],"headings":["In cognitive psychology","Two types","Models and theories","See also","Bibliography"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cognitivism","psychology"],["functionalism","philosophy_of_mind"]],"members":["cognitivism","functionalism"],"related":["Information","Observation","Universe","Information_processor","Content_format","Claude_E._Shannon","Latent_information","Manifest_information","Cognitive_psychology","Cognition","Computing","Computational_theory_of_mind","Cognitivism_(psychology)","Functionalism_(philosophy_of_mind)","Decentralized","Parallel_distributed_processing","Connectionism","Friedrich_Hayek","Neurons","Friedrich_Hayek","Connectionism","Tip_of_the_tongue","Jean_Piaget","Metacognition","Information_processing_system","Computer_data_processing","Frieder_Nake"]}
