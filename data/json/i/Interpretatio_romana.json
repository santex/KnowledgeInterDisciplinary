{"cursor":"20181","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n (seated right) welcoming the Greek heroine Io into Egypt, as depicted in a\n Roman wall painting from Pompeii]] 'Interpretatio graeca' (Latin, \"Greek\n translation\" or \"interpretation by means of Greek [models]\") is a\n discourse Characterized as \"discourse\" by Mark S. Smith, God in\n Translation: Deities in Cross-Cultural Discourse in the Biblical World (Wm. B.\n Eerdmans, 2008, 2010), p. 246. in which ancient Greek religious concepts\n and practices, deities, and myths are used to interpret or attempt to\n understand the mythology and religion of other cultures. It is thus a\n comparative methodology that looks for equivalencies and shared\n characteristics. The phrase may describe Greek efforts to explain others'\n beliefs and myths, as when Herodotus describes Egyptian religion in terms of\n perceived Greek analogues, or when Dionysius of Halicarnassus and Plutarch\n document Roman cults, temples, and practices under the names of equivalent\n Greek deities. Interpretatio graeca may also describe non-Greeks'\n interpretation of their own belief systems by comparison or assimilation with\n Greek models, as when Romans adapt Greek myths and iconography under the names\n of their own gods.\n\n'Interpretatio romana' is comparative discourse in reference to ancient Roman\nreligion and myth, as in the formation of a distinctive Gallo-Roman religion.\nBoth the Romans and the Gauls reinterpreted Gallic religious traditions in\nrelation to Roman models, particularly Imperial cult.\n\nJan Assmann considers the polytheistic approach to internationalizing gods as a\nform of \"intercultural translation\": The great achievement of\npolytheism is the articulation of a common semantic universe. â¦The meaning of a\ndeity is his or her specific character as it unfolded in myths, hymns, rites,\nand so on. This character makes a deity comparable to other deities with similar\ntraits. The similarity of gods makes their names mutually translatable. â¦ The\npractice of translating the names of the gods created a concept of similarity\nand produced the idea or conviction that the gods are international. Moses\nthe Egyptian: The Memory of Egypt in Western Monotheism (Harvard University\nPress, 1997), pp. 44â54 (quotation p. 45), as cited by Smith, God in\nTranslation, p. 39.\n\nPliny the Elder expressed the \"translatability\" of deities as \"different names\nto different peoples\" (nomina alia aliis gentibus). Pliny, Natural History\n2.5.15. This capacity made possible the religious syncretism of the\nHellenistic era and the pre-Christian Roman Empire.\n","linknr":472,"url":"Interpretatio_romana","recorded":1362484556,"links":94,"instances":["mythology","mythology","mythology","mythology","mythology","mythology","god","mythology","mythology","mythology","goddess","mythology","mythology","mythology","mythology","mythology","mythology","mythology","deity","mythology","mythology","mythology","morning_star","mythology","mythology","mythology","mythology","mythology","roman_mythology","mythology","mythology","mythology","mythology","mythology","mythology","mythology","ancient_rome","mythology","mythology","mythology","mythology","mythology","mythology","mythology","mythology","mythology","mythology","mythology","mythology","deity","mythology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Foreign
