It was first\nprepared in 1960 from oripavine, which does not generally occur in opium poppy\nextract but rather in \"poppy straw\" and in the related plants [[oriental\npoppy|Papaver orientale]] and [[Papaver bracteatum]]. [http://opioids.com/narcotic-drugs/chapter-\n3.html Opium: the king of narcotics ] It was\nlater reproduced in 1963 by a research group at MacFarlan Smith in Gorgie,\nEdinburgh, led by Professor Kenneth Bentley. Bentley KW, Hardy DG. \"New\npotent analgesics in the morphine series.\" Proceedings of the Chemical Society.\n1963;220. It can also be produced from thebaine.\n\nEtorphine is often used to immobilize elephants and other large mammals.\nEtorphine is available legally only for veterinary use and is strictly governed\nby law. Diprenorphine (M5050), also known as Revivon, is an opioid receptor\nantagonist that can be administered in proportion to the amount of etorphine\nused (1.3 times) to reverse its effects. Veterinary-strength etorphine is fatal\nto humans. For this reason the package as supplied to vets always includes the\nhuman antidote as well as Etorphine.\n\nOne of its main advantages in general veterinary work is its speed of operation\nand, more importantly, the speed with which diprenorphine reverses the effects.\nFor example, operations on valuable animals such as racehorses, using\nalternative anaesthetics risks the animal injuring itself as the anesthetic\nwears off. The rapid action of etorphine and diprenorphine means the animal can\nbe back on its feet within a relatively short time and aware of its surroundings\nmore quickly, thus reducing any tendency to panic and move around rapidly while\nstill partially under the influence of the anesthetic. For this reason, its use\nis popular with many vets.\n\n'Large Animal Immobilon' is a combination of etorphine plus acepromazine\nmaleate. An etorphine antidote 'Large Animal Revivon' contains mainly\ndiprenorphine for animals and a human-specific naloxone-based antidote, which\nshould be prepared prior to the etorphine.\n\nA close relative, dihydroetorphine, has been used as an opioid painkiller for\nhuman usage in China. It is claimed to be less addictive than traditional\nopioids but this has yet to be confirmed.\n","linknr":199,"url":"Immobilon","recorded":1362673298,"links":31,"instances":["tv_network"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Semisynthetic opioids","Mu-opioid agonists","Morphinans","Phenols","Alcohols","Ethers"],"headings":["Pharmacology","Legal status","In media","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/64/Etorphine.png/220px-Etorphine.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/X_mark.svg/7px-X_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fb/Yes_check.svg/7px-Yes_check.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fb/Yes_check.svg/7px-Yes_check.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fb/Yes_check.svg/7px-Yes_check.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/X_mark.svg/7px-X_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fb/Yes_check.svg/7px-Yes_check.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fb/Yes_check.svg/7px-Yes_check.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fb/Yes_check.svg/14px-Yes_check.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["showtime","tv_network"]],"members":["showtime"],"related":["Netherlands","United_States","Opioid","Analgesic","Morphine","Oripavine","Opium_poppy","MacFarlan_Smith","Gorgie","Edinburgh","Thebaine","Elephant","Veterinary_medicine","Diprenorphine","Diprenorphine","Acepromazine","Naloxone","Dihydroetorphine","Mu_opioid_receptor","Delta_opioid_receptor","Kappa_opioid_receptor","Opioid_receptors","Nociceptin","Orphanin_FQ","Hong_Kong","Hong_Kong_dollar","Netherlands","Opium_Law","Hydrochloride","Showtime_(TV_network)","Dexter_Morgan"]}
