environment while ignoring other things. Attention has also been referred\nto as the allocation of processing resources. <ref></ref>\n\nAttention is one of the most intensely studied topics within psychology and\ncognitive neuroscience. Attention remains a major area of investigation within\neducation, psychology and neuroscience. Areas of active investigation involve\ndetermining the source of the signals that generate attention, the effects of\nthese signals on the tuning properties of sensory neurons, and the relationship\nbetween attention and other cognitive processes like working memory and\nvigilance. A relatively new body of research is investigating the phenomenon of\ntraumatic brain injuries and their effects on attention.\n\nAttention also has variations amongst cultures.<ref name=\"Chavajay 1999\n1079â€“1090\"></ref>\n","title":"Attention","headings":["History of the study of attention","Selective attention","Divided attention","Bottom-Up vs Top-Down","Overt and covert attention","Influence of processing load","Clinical model of attention","Neural correlates of attention","Cultural variation","Attention modelling","See also","References"]},"micro-relation":["4: Working_memory","3: Psychology","2: Neuroscience","2: Mental_chronometry","2: William_James","2: Donald_Broadbent","2: Broadbent's_Filter_Model_of_Attention","2: Anne_Treisman","2: Neural_correlate","2: Cognitive_psychology","2: EEG","2: Parietal_lobe","2: Executive_functions","2: Frontal_lobe","2: Saccade","1: Cognitive_process","1: Cognitive_neuroscience","1: Education","1: Neuronal_tuning","1: Neurons","1: Traumatic_brain_injuries","1: Philosophy","1: John_B._Watson","1: Juan_Luis_Vives","1: Nicolas_Malebranche","1: Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz","1: Apperception","1: Johann_Friedrich_Herbart","1: Sir_William_Hamilton,_9th_Baronet","1: William_Stanley_Jevons","1: Wilhelm_Wundt","1: Personal_equation","1: Franciscus_Donders","1: Sigmund_Freud","1: Hermann_von_Helmholtz","1: Walter_Benjamin","1: Distraction","1: Ulric_Neisser","1: Psychological_refractory_period","1: John_Ridley_Stroop","1: Stroop_Effect","1: Psychologist#Research_Psychologists","1: Behaviorism","1: Philosophical_realism","1: Cognitive_revolution","1: Colin_Cherry","1: Dichotic_listening","1: Headphones","1: Ears","1: Broadbent's_Filter_Model_of_Attention#Attenuation_model_of_attention","1: Diana_Deutsch","1: National_Institutes_of_Health","1: Macaque","1: Superior_colliculus","1: Workload#Workload_Theory_and_Workload_Modelling","1: Attentional_shift#The_Spotlight_Theory","1: Feature_integration_theory","1: Jeremy_Wolfe","1: Positron_emission_tomography","1: FMRI","1: Psychophysiology","1: Falsifiable","1: Zoom_lens","1: Visual_angle","1: Exogeny","1: Temporal_lobe","1: Brainstem","1: Endogeny","1: Attentional_Control","1: Basal_ganglia","1: Oxford_University_Press","1: Sense","1: Neural_circuitry","1: Cognitive_load#Cognitive_load_theory","1: Neurologic","1: Brain_damage","1: Coma","1: Auditory_spatial_attention","1: Conceptual_model","1: Frontal_eye_fields","1: Frontal_cortex","1: Microstimulation","1: Parietal_cortex","1: Superior_colliculi","1: Gamma_wave","1: Executive_system","1: Right_hemisphere","1: Norepinephrine","1: Baddeley's_model_of_working_memory#Central_executive","1: Baddeley's_model_of_working_memory","1: Eriksen_flanker_task","1: Anterior_cingulate_cortex","1: Jules_Henry","1: Mayans","1: San_Pedro_La_Laguna","1: Attention-deficit_hyperactivity_disorder","1: Attention_restoration_theory","1: Attention_seeking","1: Attention_span","1: Attentional_control","1: Attentional_shift","1: Binding_problem","1: Cognitive_inhibition","1: Deconcentration_of_attention","1: Focusing","1: Joint_attention","1: Split_attention_effect","1: Visual_search"]}
