{"cursor":"38320","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nAn 'investment bank' is a financial institution that assists individuals,\ncorporations, and governments in raising capital by underwriting and/or acting\nas the client's agent in the issuance of securities. An investment bank may also\nassist companies involved in mergers and acquisitions, and provide ancillary\nservices such as market making, trading of derivatives, fixed income\ninstruments, foreign exchange, commodities, and equity securities.\n\nUnlike commercial banks and retail banks, investment banks do not take deposits.\nFrom 1933 (GlassâSteagall Act) until 1999 (GrammâLeachâBliley Act), the United\nStates maintained a separation between investment banking and commercial banks.\nOther industrialized countries, including G8 countries, have historically not\nmaintained such a separation.\n\nThere are two main lines of business in investment banking. Trading securities\nfor cash or for other securities (i.e. facilitating transactions, market-\nmaking), or the promotion of securities (i.e. underwriting, research, etc.) is\nthe \"sell side\", while advising or managing assets (through mutual funds or\nhedge funds) on behalf of pension funds or the investing public (who consume the\nproducts and services of the sell-side in order to maximize their return on\ninvestment) constitutes the \"buy side\". Many firms have buy and sell side\ncomponents.\n\nAn investment bank can also be split into private and public functions with an\ninformation barrier which separates the two to prevent information from\ncrossing. The private areas of the bank deal with private insider information\nthat may not be publicly disclosed, while the public areas such as stock\nanalysis deal with public information.\n\nAn advisor who provides investment banking services in the United States must be\na licensed broker-dealer and subject to Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC)\nand Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)\nregulation.
