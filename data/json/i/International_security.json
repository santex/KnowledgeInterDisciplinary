These measures include military action and diplomatic\nagreements such as treaties and conventions. International and national security\nare invariably linked. International security is national security or state\nsecurity in the global arena.\n\nWith the end of World War II, a new subject of study focusing on international\nsecurity emerged. It began as an independent field of study, but was absorbed as\na sub-field of international relations. Buzan, B. and\nL. Hansen (2009). The Evolution of International Security Studies. Cambridge,\nCambridge University Press. Since it took hold in the 1950s, the study of\ninternational security has been at the heart of international relations\nstudies. Sheehan, M. (2005). International Security: An Analytical Survey.\nLondon, Lynne Rienner Publishers. It covers labels like âsecurity\nstudiesâ, âstrategic studiesâ, âpeace studiesâ, and others.\n\nThe meaning of \"security\" is often treated as a common sense term that can be\nunderstood by \"unacknowledged consensus\". Sheehan, M. (2005), International\nSecurity: and Analytical Survey, London, Lynne Rienner Publishers The\ncontent of international security has expanded over the years. Today it covers a\nvariety of interconnected issues in the world that have an impact on survival.\nIt ranges from the traditional or conventional modes of military power, the\ncauses and consequences of war between states, economic strength, to ethnic,\nreligious and ideological conflicts, trade and economic conflicts, energy\nsupplies, science and technology, food, as well as threats to human security and\nthe stability of states from environmental degradation, infectious diseases,\nclimate change and the activities of non-state actors.
