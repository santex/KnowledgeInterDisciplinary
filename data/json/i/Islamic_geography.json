Each man has an [[axe]], a [[sword]], and a [[knife]],\n and keeps each by him at all times. Each woman wears on either breast a box of\n [[iron]], [[silver]], [[copper]], or [[gold]]; the value of the box indicates\n the wealth of the husband.

Tibbetts, The Beginnings of a Cartographic Tradition,\nin: John Brian Harley, David Woodward: Cartography in the Traditional Islamic\nand South Asian Societies, Chicago, 1992, pp. 90â107 (97-100), ISBN 0-226-31635-\n1 Islamic geography was patronized by the Abbasid caliphs of Baghdad.\nVarious Islamic scholars contributed to its development, and the most notable\ninclude Al-KhwÄrizmÄ«, AbÅ« Zayd al-BalkhÄ« (founder of the 'BalkhÄ« school') and\nAbu Rayhan Biruni. Muslim geography reached its apex with Muhammad al-Idrisi\nin the 12th century. Later developments took place under Turks, particularly\nunder the Ottoman Empire, with notable scholars such as Mahmud al-Kashgari and\nPiri Reis.\n","linknr":223,"url":"Islamic_geography","recorded":1362485525,"links":23,"instances":["journal","journal","ptolemy"],"pdf":["http://nautarch.tamu.edu/pdf-files/Mott-MA1991.pdf"],"categories":["Islamic geography|Medieval Islam","Islamic Golden Age"],"headings":["Impetus","See also","Notes and references","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/47/1154_world_map_by_Moroccan_cartographer_al-Idrisi_for_king_Roger_of_Sicily.jpg/150px-1154_world_map_by_Moroccan_cartographer_al-Idrisi_for_king_Roger_of_Sicily.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c9/Al_Masudi%27s_Map_of_the_World.JPG/220px-Al_Masudi%27s_Map_of_the_World.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/da/Map_of_the_Indian_Ocean_and_the_China_Sea_was_engraved_in_1728_by_Ibrahim_M%C3%BCteferrika.jpg/220px-Map_of_the_Indian_Ocean_and_the_China_Sea_was_engraved_in_1728_by_Ibrahim_M%C3%BCteferrika.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["geographia","ptolemy"],["isis","journal"],["centaurus","journal"]],"members":["isis","centaurus","geographia"],"related":["China","Sea","Katip_Çelebi","Geography","Cartography","Earth_sciences","Muslim_world","Hellenistic_geography","Abbasid","Caliph","Baghdad","Al-Khwārizmī","Ahmed_ibn_Sahl_al-Balkhi","Abu_Rayhan_Biruni","Muhammad_al-Idrisi","Turkish_people","Ottoman_Empire","Mahmud_al-Kashgari","Piri_Reis","Geographia_(Ptolemy)","T-O_map","List_of_Muslim_geographers","History_of_geography","History_of_cartography","Aligarh","Isis_(journal)","Centaurus_(journal)","Brill_Publishers","Oxford_University_Press","Texas_A&M_University","Encyclopedia_of_the_History_of_Arabic_Science","Routledge"]}
