      "text" : "A 'regulatory agency' (also 'regulatory authority', 'regulatory body' or\n'regulator') is a public authority or government agency responsible for\nexercising autonomous authority over some area of human activity in a regulatory\nor supervisory capacity. An 'independent regulatory agency' is a regulatory\nagency that is independent from other branches or arms of the government.\n\nRegulatory agencies deal in the area of administrative law&mdash;regulation or\nrulemaking (codifying and enforcing rules and regulations and imposing\nsupervision or oversight for the benefit of the public at large). The existence\nof independent regulatory agencies is justified by the complexity of certain\nregulatory and supervisory tasks that require expertise, the need for rapid\nimplementation of public authority in certain sectors, and the drawbacks of\npolitical interference. Some independent regulatory agencies perform\ninvestigations or audits, and some are authorized to fine the relevant parties\nand order certain measures.\n\nRegulatory agencies are usually a part of the executive branch of the\ngovernment, or they have statutory authority to perform their functions with\noversight from the legislative branch. Their actions are generally open to legal\nreview. Regulatory authorities are commonly set up to enforce standards and\nsafety, or to oversee use of public goods and regulate commerce. Examples of\nregulatory agencies are the Interstate Commerce Commission and U.S. Food and\nDrug Administration in the United States, Ofcom in the United Kingdom, and the\nTRAI in India.\n",
