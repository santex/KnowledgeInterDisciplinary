{"cursor":"29888","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Industrial farming' is a form of modern farming that refers to the\nindustrialized production of livestock, poultry, fish, and crops. The methods of\nindustrial agriculture are technoscientific, economic, and political. They\ninclude innovation in agricultural machinery and farming methods, genetic\ntechnology, techniques for achieving economies of scale in production, the\ncreation of new markets for consumption, the application of patent protection to\ngenetic information, and global trade. These methods are widespread in developed\nnations and increasingly prevalent worldwide. Most of the meat, dairy, eggs,\nfruits, and vegetables available in supermarkets are produced using these\nmethods of industrial agriculture.\n","linknr":452,"url":"Industrial_agriculture","recorded":1362503564,"links":35,"instances":["agriculture","economics","food"],"pdf":["http://www.fao.org/docrep/014/i2454e/i2454e00.pdf","http://www.lpes.org/cafo/01FS_History.pdf"],"categories":["Industrial agriculture|"],"headings":["Historical development and future prospects","Challenges and issues","Animals","Crops","Sustainable agriculture","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/Maler_der_Grabkammer_des_Sennudem_001.jpg/220px-Maler_der_Grabkammer_des_Sennudem_001.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/Farmer_plowing_in_Fahrenwalde%2C_Mecklenburg-Vorpommern%2C_Germany.jpg/32px-Farmer_plowing_in_Fahrenwalde%2C_Mecklenburg-Vorpommern%2C_Germany.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b7/Population_curve.svg/350px-Population_curve.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["crop","agriculture"],["egg","food"],["profit","economics"]],"members":["crop","profit","egg"],"related":["Agriculture","Industry","Livestock","Poultry","Fish","Crop_(agriculture)","Technoscience","Innovation","Genetic_engineering","Economies_of_scale","Patent","Globalization","Developed_nation","Meat","Dairy","Egg_(food)","Fruits","Vegetables","Supermarket","Industrial_Revolution","Nitrogen","Potassium","Phosphorus","Fertilizer","Vitamin","Nutrition","Antibiotic","Vaccine","World_War_II","Pesticide","Vertical_integration","Worldwatch_Institute","Hudson_Institute","University_of_California,_Berkeley","Industrial_Revolution","Enclosure","Mechanization","Four-field_crop_rotation","Selective_breeding","Oxford_University_Press","Animal_rights","Hunter-gatherer","Primitive_agriculture","Intensive_agriculture","Africa","Asia","Europe","Central_America","South_America","North_America","Oceania","Common_Era","Common_Era","Fossil_fuel","International_Energy_Agency","Peak_phosphate","Water","World_energy_resources_and_consumption","Chemical_industry","Pollution","Land_pollution","Water_pollution","Air_pollution","Herbicide","Insecticide","Fertilizer","Animal_by-products","Groundwater","Surface_water","Colony_Collapse_Disorder","Pollination","Peak_oil","2007-2008_world_food_price_crisis","European_Union","United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency","Groundwater_contamination","Waste_disposal","Animal_waste","Manure_lagoon","Animal_rights","Animal_welfare","Air_pollution","Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention","Green_Revolution","Irrigation","Fertilizer","Maize","Wheat","Rice","High-yielding_variety","Norin_10_wheat","Orville_Vogel","International_Rice_Research_Institute","F1_hybrids","Seed_saving","Sustainable_agriculture","Natural_environment","Stewardship","Farm","Profit_(economics)","Farming","Community","List_of_academic_disciplines","Farmer","Consumer","Technology","Holism","Reductionism","Integrated_Multi-Trophic_Aquaculture","Fertilizer","Food","Aquaculture","Fish","Shrimp","Seaweed","Shellfish"]}
