{"cursor":"1983","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In Christian theology, 'interpretation of tongues' is one of the spiritual gifts\nlisted in 1 Corinthians 12. This gift is used in conjunction with that of the\ngift of tonguesâthe supernatural ability to speak in a language (tongue) unknown\nto the speaker. The gift of interpretation is the supernatural enablement to\nexpress in an intelligible language an utterance spoken in an unknown tongue.\nThis is not learned but imparted by the Holy Spirit; therefore, it should not be\nconfused with the acquired skill of language interpretation. While cessationist\nChristians believe this miraculous charism has ceased, Pentecostal and\ncharismatic Christians believe this gift continues to operate within the\nchurch. Guy P. Duffield and Nathaniel M. Van Cleave,\nFoundations of Pentecostal Theology, 1983, (Los Angeles: Foursquare Media,\n2008), pp. 342-343.\n","linknr":174,"url":"Interpretation_of_tongues","recorded":1362899422,"links":12,"instances":["christianity"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Charismatic and Pentecostal Christianity","Spiritual gifts","Christian terms"],"headings":["Biblical description","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/10/Tuam_Cathedral_of_the_Assumption_Sacred_Heart_Detail_2009_09_14.jpg/80px-Tuam_Cathedral_of_the_Assumption_Sacred_Heart_Detail_2009_09_14.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["holy_spirit","christianity"]],"members":["holy_spirit"],"related":["Christian_theology","Spiritual_gift","1_Corinthians","Glossolalia","Supernatural","Holy_Spirit_(Christianity)","Language_interpretation","Cessationism","Charism","Pentecostal","Charismatic_Movement","Christian_Church","St._Paul","Glossolalia"]}
