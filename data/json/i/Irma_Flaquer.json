Born to a Catalan theater producer father, Fernando Flaquer, and\nGuatemalan opera singer mother, Olga Azurdia, she spent her childhood travelling\nand living throughout Central and South America. In 1955, she married Fernando\nValle Avizpe and later divorced in 1958. That same year (1958) she started a\ncolumn in the Guatemalan newspaper [[La Hora]], entitled \"Lo que otros callan\"\nwhich she would later transfer over to [[La NaciÃ³n]] in the years 1971 to 1980.\nShe had two sons, Sergio Valle and Fernando Valle.\n\nIn 1970 she had a hand grenade thrown into her car, injuring only her hand. On\nOctober 16, 1980, Irma attended her grandson's 4th birthday party. It was also\nbelieved to be a last farewell to her son Fernando, his wife, Mayra Rosales, and\nher grandson, Fernando, before she left for Nicaragua the next day. While she\nand Fernando drove back to her apartment, they were stopped a block away from\nher apartment by two cars surrounding their car. Fernando was shot in the head\nand Irma cried out for a doctor for her son. She was grabbed and taken away. Her\nbody has not been recovered and it is believed she was executed. She had been\nthe first white, middle-class, professional woman to have been abducted and\npresumably murdered in Guatemala during that time. Her son, Sergio, who had been\nsent to live in a kibbutz in Israel in 1970 after the grenade incident, had\nreceived menacing, anonymous phone calls in Israel after his mother's\ndisappearance for two years, claiming that she had gone crazy and was living in\na basement.\n\nThe Inter American Press Association investigated the case of Irma Flaquer as\npart of its impunity project, and the case was the first that the IAPA brought\nto the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, which ruled that the\nGuatemalan government was responsible for her disappearance, at the very least\nby not protecting her as a public figure.\n\nThe investigation also led to a book Disappeared, A Journalist Silenced by June\nCarolyn Erlick (Seal Press, 2004).\n","linknr":109,"url":"Irma_Flaquer","recorded":1375071758,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Irma_Flaquer&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Irma_Flaquer&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Guatemala_City","/wiki/Forced_disappearance","/wiki/Guatemala","/wiki/Guatemala_City","/wiki/Guatemala","/wiki/Central_America","/wiki/South_America","/wiki/Guatemala","/wiki/La_Hora","/wiki/La_Naci%C3%B3n","/wiki/Forced_disappearance","/wiki/Kibbutz","/wiki/Israel","/wiki/Inter_American_Press_Association","/wiki/Inter-American_Commission_on_Human_Rights","/w/index.php?title=June_Carolyn_Erlick&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Irma_Flaquer&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/List_of_Guatemalans","/w/index.php?title=Irma_Flaquer&action=edit&section=2","http://shr.aaas.org/guatemala/ceh/mds/spanish/anexo1/vol1/no49.html","http://shr.aaas.org/guatemala/ceh/mds/spanish/toc.html","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Special:BookSources/99922-54-00-9","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Special:BookSources/978-1-58005-113-2","/w/index.php?title=Irma_Flaquer&action=edit&section=3","http://www.impunidad.com/index.php?procesos=57&idioma=us","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/9520132","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","/wiki/Guatemala_City","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Irma_Flaquer&oldid=524026986","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1938_births","/wiki/Category:1980_deaths","/wiki/Category:People_from_Guatemala_City","/wiki/Category:Guatemalan_journalists","/wiki/Category:Guatemalan_people_of_Spanish_descent","/wiki/Category:Human_rights_in_Guatemala","/wiki/Category:Forced_disappearances","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_hCards","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Irma+Flaquer&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Irma+Flaquer","/wiki/Irma_Flaquer","/wiki/Talk:Irma_Flaquer","#","/wiki/Irma_Flaquer","/w/index.php?title=Irma_Flaquer&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Irma_Flaquer&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Irma_Flaquer","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Irma_Flaquer","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Irma_Flaquer&oldid=524026986","/w/index.php?title=Irma_Flaquer&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6072030","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Irma_Flaquer&id=524026986","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Irma+Flaquer","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Irma+Flaquer&oldid=524026986&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Irma_Flaquer&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6072030#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irma_Flaquer","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=v
