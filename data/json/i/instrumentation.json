      "text" : "\n\n\n\n\n'Instrumentation' is defined as the art and science of measurement and control\nof process variables within a production or manufacturing area.<ref\nname=NAIT></ref>\n\nAn instrument is a device that measures a physical quantity such as flow,\ntemperature, level, distance, angle, or pressure. Instruments may be as simple\nas direct reading thermometers or may be complex multi-variable process\nanalyzers. Instruments are often part of a control system in refineries,\nfactories, and vehicles. The control of processes is one of the main branches of\napplied instrumentation. Instrumentation can also refer to handheld devices that\nmeasure some desired variable. Diverse handheld instrumentation is common in\nlaboratories, but can be found in the household as well. For example, a smoke\ndetector is a common instrument found in most western homes.\n\nInstruments attached to a control system may provide signals used to operate\nsolenoids, valves, regulators, circuit breakers, or relays. These devices\ncontrol a desired output variable, and provide either remote or automated\ncontrol capabilities. These are often referred to as final control elements when\ncontrolled remotely or by a control system.\n\nA Transmitter is a device that produces an output signal, often in the form of\na 4&ndash;20&nbsp;mA electrical current signal, although many other options\nusing voltage, frequency, pressure, or ethernet are possible. This signal can\nbe used for informational purposes, or it can be sent to a PLC, DCS, SCADA\nsystem, LabView or other type of computerized controller, where it can be\ninterpreted into readable values and used to control other devices and\nprocesses in the system.\n\nControl instrumentation plays a significant role in both gathering information\nfrom the field and changing the field parameters, and as such are a key part of\ncontrol loops.\n",
