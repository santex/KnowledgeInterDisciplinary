This\nsystem is designed to map health conditions to corresponding generic categories\ntogether with specific variations, assigning for these a designated code, up to\nsix characters long. Thus, major categories are designed to include a set of\nsimilar diseases.\n\nThe International Classification of Diseases is published by the World Health\nOrganization (WHO) and used worldwide for morbidity and mortality statistics,\nreimbursement systems, and automated decision support in health care. This\nsystem is designed to promote international comparability in the collection,\nprocessing, classification, and presentation of these statistics. As in the case\nof the analogous (but limited to mental and behavioral disorders) Diagnostic and\nStatistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM, currently in version IV-TR), the\nICD is a major project to statistically classify health disorders, and provide\ndiagnostic assistance. The ICD is a core statistically-based classificatory\ndiagnostic system for health care related issues of the WHO Family of\nInternational Classifications (WHO-FIC). World Health\nOrganization.
