Schermerhorn as the\n\"...degree to which the people affected by decision are treated by dignity and\nrespect.'' ( John R. Schermerhorn, Organizational behavior) The theory focuses\non the interpersonal treatment people receive when procedures are implemented.\n\nInteractional justice, a subcomponent of organizational justice, has come to be\nseen as consisting of two specific types of interpersonal treatment (e.g.\nGreenberg, 1990a, 1993b). The first labeled interpersonal justice, reflects the\ndegree to which people are treated with politeness, dignity, and respect by\nauthorities or third parties involved in executing procedures or determining\noutcomes. The second, labeled informational justice, focuses on the explanations\nprovided to people that convey information about why procedures were used in a\ncertain way or why outcomes were distributed in a certain fashion. Where more\nadequacy of explanation is prevalent, the perceived level of informational\njustice is higher.
