{"cursor":"1586","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Incorporation by reference' is the act of including a second document within\nanother document by only mentioning the second document. This act, if\nproperly done, makes the entire second document a part of the main document.\nIncorporation by reference is often done in creating laws as well as in contract\nlaw and trust and estate law.\n\nIn law regarding wills, it is a doctrine at common law which allows a testator,\nor a creator of a will, to dispose of assets in his estate in accordance with a\nseparate document. To be valid, such a document must comply with the following\nrequirements:\n# it must have existed at the time the will was executed; the will must describe\n# the document with particularity, so that it may be identified; and the will\n# must clearly manifest the intent that the document be incorporated.\nAn exception to the first requirement is made for small gifts of tangible\npersonal property, such as household furniture and items of sentimental value.\n\nOral instructions can not be subject to incorporation by reference. For example,\nif a testator states in the will that he has recited to a third party the\nintended disposition of testamentary assets, such attempt to circumvent the\nrequirements of a written will is void.\n","linknr":157,"url":"Incorporation_by_reference","recorded":1362674966,"links":15,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Wills and trusts","Statutory law"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/Scale_of_justice_2.svg/22px-Scale_of_justice_2.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf8/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf8/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Common_law","Personal_property"]}
