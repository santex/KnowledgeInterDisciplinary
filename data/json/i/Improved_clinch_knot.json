This is a common knot used by most beginner/amateur/expert\nfishers because of its simple tie and strong hold. When more pull is being\napplied, the harder the knot turns into itself, increasing the strength of the\nconnection. Can be used with many kinds of line including mono-filament,\nfluorocarbon, and braided fishing line.\n","linknr":264,"url":"Improved_clinch_knot","recorded":1362551660,"links":20,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Fishing knots"],"headings":["External links","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/12px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/People_icon.svg/16px-People_icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/Trefoil_knot_left.svg/50px-Trefoil_knot_left.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Knot","Fishing_line","Fishing_lure","Swivel","Clip","Artificial_fly","List_of_knots"]}
