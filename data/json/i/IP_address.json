RFC 760, DOD\nStandard Internet Protocol (January 1980) An IP address serves two\nprincipal functions: host or network interface identification and location\naddressing. Its role has been characterized as follows: \"A [[hostname|name]]\nindicates what we seek. An address indicates where it is. A route indicates how\nto get there.\" RFC 791, Internet Protocol â DARPA Internet\nProgram Protocol Specification (September 1981)\n\nThe designers of the Internet Protocol defined an IP address as a 32-bit\nnumber and this system, known as Internet Protocol Version 4\n(IPv4), is still in use today. However, due to the enormous growth of the\nInternet and the predicted depletion of available addresses, a new version of IP\n(IPv6), using 128 bits for the address, was developed in 1995. RFC 1883, Internet Protocol, Version 6 (IPv6) Specification, S.\nDeering, R. Hinden (December 1995) IPv6 was standardized as RFC 2460 in\n1998, RFC 2460, Internet Protocol, Version 6 (IPv6)\nSpecification, S. Deering, R. Hinden, The Internet Society (December 1998)\nand its deployment has been ongoing since the mid-2000s.\n\nIP addresses are binary numbers, but they are usually stored in text files and\ndisplayed in human-readable notations, such as 172.16.254.1 (for IPv4), and\n2001:db8:0:1234:0:567:8:1 (for IPv6).\n\nThe Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) manages the IP address space\nallocations globally and delegates five regional Internet registries (RIRs) to\nallocate IP address blocks to local Internet registries (Internet service\nproviders) and other entities.\n","linknr":425,"url":"IP_address","recorded":1362668985,"links":106,"instances":["computing","networking_utility","computer","computing","information"],"pdf":["http://web.archive.org/web/20100821112028/http://www.3com.com/other/pdfs/infra/corpinfo/en_US/501302.pdf","http://www.3com.com/other/pdfs/infra/corpinfo/en_US/501302.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20100821112028/http://www.3com.com/other/pdfs/infra/corpinfo/en_US/501302.pdf"],"categories":["Network addressing","Internet Protocol|Address"],"headings":["IP versions","IP subnetworks","IP address assignment {{anchor|Dynamic IP|Static IP}}","{{visible anchor|Public address}}es","Modifications to IP addressing","Diagnostic tools","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/Padlock-silver.svg/20px-Padlock-silver.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/Internet_map_1024.jpg/150px-Internet_map_1024.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/Crystal_Clear_app_browser.png/16px-Crystal_Clear_app_browser.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/74/Ipv4_address.svg/300px-Ipv4_address.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/15/Ipv6_address.svg/300px-Ipv6_address.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["identification","information"],["octet","computing"],["octet","computing"],["firewall","computer"],["blacklist","computing"],["ping","networking_utility"]],"members":["octet","ping","firewall","blacklist","identification"],"related":["Computer_network","Internet_Protocol","Identification_(information)","Logical_address","32-bit","IPv4","Internet","IPv4_address_exhaustion","IPv6","IPv6_deployment","Binary_number","Human-readable","Internet_Assigned_Numbers_Authority","Regional_Internet_registries","Local_Internet_registry","Internet_service_provider","IPv4","Internet_Stream_Protocol","Bit","Address_space","Private_network","Multicast_address","Dot-decimal_notation","Octet_(computing)","Hexadecimal","Octal","Binary_numeral_system","Classful_network","Subnetwork","Unicast","Scalability","Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing","Private_network","Network_address_translation","Subnetwork","Residential_gateway","IPv4_address_exhaustion","IPv4","Internet_Assigned_Numbers_Authority","Regional_Internet_registry","Local_Internet_registry","Internet_service_providers","Address_pool","Asia-Pacific_Network_Information_Centre","Internet_Engineering_Task_Force","Bit","Octet_(computing)","Voice_over_IP","Unique_local_address","Link-local_address","Neighbor_Discovery_Protocol","Subnetwork","IPv4_subnetting_reference_","IPv6_subnetting_reference_","CIDR_notation","Dynamic_IP","Static_IP","Zeroconf","Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Protocol","Zeroconf","Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Protocol","Point-to-Point_Protocol","Sticky_dynamic_IP_address","Sticky_IP","Link-local_address","IPv6","Microsoft","APIPA","De_facto","IETF","Domain_Name_System","Domain_names","Time_to_live","Private_network","Link-local_address","Firewall_(computer)","IP_blocking","Blacklist_(computing)","Whitelist","Proxy_server","Network_address_translation","Shared_hosting","Web_server","Network_address_translator","Proxy_server","Intermediary","Request","Private_network","Residential_gateway","MS_Windows","Command-line_interface","Ipconfig","Netsh","Unix-like","Ifconfig","IP_address_location","Hierarchical_name_space","Hostname","IP_address_spoofing","IP_aliasing","IP_blocking","IP_Multicast","IPv4_subnetting_reference","IPv6_subnetting_reference","List_of_assigned_/8_IPv4_address_blocks","MAC_address","Ping_(networking_utility)","Private_network","Regional_Internet_Registry","Subnet_address","Virtual_IP_address","WHOIS"]}
