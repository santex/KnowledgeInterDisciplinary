To function properly, an immune\n system must detect a wide variety of agents, from viruses to parasitic worms,\n and distinguish them from the organism's own healthy tissue.\n\nPathogens can rapidly evolve and adapt to avoid detection and neutralization by\nthe immune system. As a result, multiple defense mechanisms have also evolved to\nrecognize and neutralize pathogens. Even simple unicellular organisms such as\nbacteria possess a rudimentary immune system, in the form of enzymes that\nprotect against bacteriophage infections. Other basic immune mechanisms evolved\nin ancient eukaryotes and remain in their modern descendants, such as plants and\ninsects. These mechanisms include phagocytosis, antimicrobial peptides called\ndefensins, and the complement system. Jawed vertebrates, including humans, have\neven more sophisticated defense mechanisms, including the\nability to adapt over time to recognize specific pathogens more efficiently.\nAdaptive (or acquired) immunity creates immunological memory after an initial\nresponse to a specific pathogen, leading to an enhanced response to subsequent\nencounters with that same pathogen. This process of acquired immunity is the\nbasis of vaccination.\n\nDisorders of the immune system can result in autoimmune diseases, inflammatory\ndiseases and cancer.

In humans, immunodeficiency can either be the result of\na genetic disease such as severe combined immunodeficiency, acquired conditions\nsuch as HIV/AIDS, or the use of immunosuppressive medication. In contrast,\nautoimmunity results from a hyperactive immune system attacking normal tissues\nas if they were foreign organisms.
