Whittall, Arnold. 2008.\nThe Cambridge Introduction to Serialism, p.273-74. New York: Cambridge\nUniversity Press. ISBN 978-0-521-68200-8 (pbk). In other words a\ncollection of pitches by starting with a certain note and going up by a certain\ninterval until the original note is reached (e.g. starting from C, going up by 3\nsemitones repeatedly until eventually C is again reached - the cycle is the\ncollection of all the notes met on the way). In other words, interval cycles\n\"unfold a single recurrent interval in a series that closes with a return to the\ninitial pitch class\". See: .\n\nInterval cycles are notated by George Perle using the letter \"C\" (for cycle),\nwith an interval class integer to distinguish the interval. Thus the diminished\nseventh chord would be C3 and the augmented triad would be C4. A superscript\nmay be added to distinguish between transpositions, using 0–11 to\nindicate the lowest pitch class in the cycle. \"These interval cycles play a\nfundamental role in the harmonic organization of post-diatonic music and can\neasily be identified by naming the cycle.\". Perle, George\n(1990). The Listening Composer, p. 21. California: University of California\nPress. ISBN 0-520-06991-9.\n\nHere are interval cycles C1, C2, C3, C4 and C6:\n\n\n\n: C1 once (top) or C6 six times (bottom).]]\n\nInterval cycles assume the use of equal temperament and may not work in other\nsystems such as just intonation. For example, if the C4 interval cycle used justly-\ntuned major thirds it would fall flat of an octave return by an interval known\nas the diesis. Put another way, a major third above G is B, which is only\nenharmonically the same as C in systems such as equal temperament, in which the\ndiesis has been tempered out.\n\nInterval cycles are symmetrical and thus non-diatonic. However, a seven-pitch\nsegment of C7 will produce the diatonic major scale :\n\n\n\nThis is known also known as a generated collection. A minimum of three pitches\nare needed to represent an interval cycle.\n\nCyclic tonal progressions in the works of Romantic composers such as Gustav\nMahler and Richard Wagner form a link with the cyclic pitch successions in the\natonal music of Modernists such as BÃ©la BartÃ³k, Alexander Scriabin, Edgard\nVarÃ¨se, and the Second Viennese School (Arnold Schoenberg, Alban Berg, and Anton\nWebern). At the same time, these progressions signal the end of tonality.\n\nInterval cycles are also important in jazz, such as in Coltrane changes.\n\n\"Similarly,\" to any pair of transpositionally related sets being reducible to\ntwo transpositionally related representations of the chromatic scale, \"the pitch-\nclass relations between any pair of inversionally related sets is reducible to\nthe pitch-class relations between two inversionally related representations of\nthe semitonal scale.\" Perle, George (1996). Twelve-Tone Tonality, p.7. ISBN\n0-520-20142-6. Thus an interval cycle or pair of cycles may be reducible\nto a representation of the chromatic scale.\n\nAs such, interval cycles may be differentiated as ascending or descending, with,\n\"the ascending form of the semitonal scale [called] a P cycle and the descending\nform [called] an I cycle,\" while, \"inversionally related dyads [are called] P/I'\ndyads'''.\" Perle (1996), p.8-9. P/I dyads will always share a sum of\ncomplementation. Cyclic sets are those, \"sets whose alternate elements unfold\ncomplementary cycles of a single interval,\" Perle (1996), p.21. that\nis an ascending and descending cycle: [[Lyric Suite]]]]\n\nIn 1920 Berg discovered/created a \"master array\" of all twelve interval cycles:\n\n      Berg's Master Array of Interval Cycles 'Cycles P' 0 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2\n      1 0 'P I I' 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 0\n        _______________________________________\n    0 | 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 11 1 | 0 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 10 2 | 0 10\n    8 6 4 2 0 10 8 6 4 2 0 9 3 | 0 9 6 3 0 9 6 3 0 9 6 3 0 8 4 | 0 8 4 0 8 4 0 8\n    4 0 8 4 0 7 5 | 0 7 2 9 4 11 6 1 8 3 10 5 0 6 6 | 0 6 0 6 0 6 0 6 0 6 0 6 0\n    5 7 | 0 5 10 3 8 1 6 11 4 9 2 7 0 4 8 | 0 4 8 0 4 8 0 4 8 0 4 8 0 3 9 | 0 3\n    6 9 0 3 6 9 0 3 6 9 0 2 10 | 0 2 4 6 8 10 0 2 4 6 8 10 0 1 11 | 0 1 2 3 4 5\n    6 7 8 9 10 11 0 0 | 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Perle (1996), p.80.\n","linknr":158,"url":"Interval_cycle","recorded":1362477308,"links":17,"instances":["music","music","music","music","music","music"],"pdf":["http://danadler.com/misc/Cycles.pdf"],"categories":["Intervals"],"headings":["See also","External links","Sources"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6d/Interval_cycles_C1-C4_and_C6.PNG/400px-Interval_cycles_C1-C4_and_C6.PNG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/92/Twelve-tone_interval_cycles.png/220px-Twelve-tone_interval_cycles.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/31/7-note_segment_of_C5.svg/330px-7-note_segment_of_C5.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/d0/Berg%27s_Lyric_Suite_cyclic_set.png/400px-Berg%27s_Lyric_Suite_cyclic_set.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["set","music"],["pitch","music"],["interval","music"],["transposition","music"],["set","music"],["complement","music#rule_of_twelve"],["interval","music"],["array","music"],["identity","music"]],"members":["array","transposition","identity","pitch","complement","interval","set"],"related":["Music","Set_(music)","Pitch_class","Interval_class","Pitch_(music)","Note","Interval_(music)","George_Perle","Interval_class","Diminished_seventh_chord","Augmented_triad","Transposition_(music)","Harmonic","Post-diatonic_music","George_Perle","Equal_temperament","Just_intonation","Major_third","Diesis","Symmetrical","Diatonic","Diatonic_major_scale","Generated_collection","Chord_progression","Gustav_Mahler","Richard_Wagner","Béla_Bartók","Alexander_Scriabin","Edgard_Varèse","Second_Viennese_School","Arnold_Schoenberg","Alban_Berg","Anton_Webern","Simultaneity_succession","Tonality","Jazz","Coltrane_changes","Chromatic_scale","Sum_of_complementation","Cyclic_set","Set_(music)","Interval_(music)","Array_(music)","Equal-interval_chord","Identity_(music)"]}
