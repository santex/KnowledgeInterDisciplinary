Windowing data is frequently done: the VMR is frequently\ncomputed over various intervals in time or small regions in space, which may be\ncalled \"windows\", and the resulting statistic called the Fano factor.\n\nIt is only defined when the mean Î¼ is non-zero, and is generally only used for\npositive statistics, such as count data or time between events, or where the\nunderlying distribution is assumed to be the exponential distribution or Poisson\ndistribution.\n","linknr":148,"url":"Index_of_dispersion","recorded":1362553150,"links":11,"instances":["image_processing","mathematics","statistics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Statistical deviation and dispersion","Statistical ratios","Data analysis","Statistical randomness","Point processes","Statistical terminology"],"headings":["Terminology","Interpretation","Example","Statistics","See also","Notes","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/5/7/f57c2ff31af2308b767df16a82bd2d41.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/e/4/0e4155daab104c27977b13239f5b215d.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/3/2/e/32e12a698b1eef2be01f5e3073aed322.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/2/4/2/242269240a28068a8942613d8968afd7.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/3/d/9/3d9fb8b3f316906a94564fd644b3ab02.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["normalization","statistics"],["eccentricity","mathematics"],["signal_to_noise_ratio","image_processing"]],"members":["signal_to_noise_ratio","eccentricity","normalization"],"related":["Probability_theory","Statistics","Coefficient_of_variation","Normalization_(statistics)","Statistical_dispersion","Probability_distribution","Variance","Mean","Count_data","Exponential_distribution","Poisson_distribution","Coefficient_of_variation","Poisson_distribution","Geometric_distribution","Negative_binomial_distribution","Binomial_distribution","Constant_random_variable","Constant_random_variable","Binomial_distribution","Poisson_distribution","Negative_binomial_distribution","Conic_sections","Eccentricity_(mathematics)","Overdispersion","Poisson_distribution","Poisson_process","Statistical_hypothesis_testing","Brownian_motion","Lexis_ratio","Count_data","Harmonic_mean","Coefficient_of_variation","Standardized_moment","Fano_factor","Signal_to_noise_ratio","Signal_processing","Signal_to_noise_ratio_(image_processing)"]}
