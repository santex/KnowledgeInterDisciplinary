Students\ncreate games and various other simulated environments, to capture consumersâ\nsubconscious thoughts. This innovative method of market research removes the\nsensitization effect that might bias peoples answers to questions. This ensures\nthat the most truthful answers are captured to research questions. The games are\ndesigned in such a way that the observers can elicit all the required\ninformation just by observing and noting down the behaviour and the responses of\nthe participants.\n\nINDEX is primarily a fair conducted in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, which provides\nthe people of the city an opportunity to experience the elements of a mela.\nApart from the market research, the fair also attracts crowds through various\ninnovative and interactive entertainment forums such as song and dance events,\ngames, competitions and the many local vendors displaying their goods and\nservices at the ground. The carnival atmosphere generates enthusiasm among the\ncrowd, which leads to a more comprehensive research opportunity for the students\nto understand market insights in a live environment.\n","linknr":154,"url":"INDEX","recorded":1362551772,"links":16,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://upaidscontrol.up.nic.in/index%20UPSACS%20report%202010.pdf","http://upaidscontrol.up.nic.in/index%20UPSACS%20report%202010.pdf"],"categories":["Articles created via the Article Wizard","Market research","Indian Institute of Management Lucknow"],"headings":["History and Inception","Events","Initiatives","Associates and Sponsors","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/56/INDEX_logo.jpg/150px-INDEX_logo.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Fair","IIM_Lucknow","IIM_Lucknow","Lucknow","Uttar_Pradesh","Hariprasad_Chaurasia"]}
