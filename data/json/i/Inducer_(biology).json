{"cursor":"3641","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In molecular biology, an 'inducer' is a molecule that starts gene expression. An\ninducer can bind to repressors or activators.\n\nInducers function by disabling repressors. The gene is expressed because an\ninducer binds to the repressor. The binding of the inducer to the repressor\nprevents the repressor from binding to the operator. RNA polymerase can then\nbegin to transcribe operon genes.\n\nInducers also function by binding to activators. Activators generally bind\npoorly to activator DNA sequences unless an inducer is present. Activator binds\nto an inducer and the complex binds to the activation sequence and activates\ntarget gene. Removing the inducer stops transcription.\n\nBecause a small inducer molecule is required, the increased expression of the\ntarget gene is called 'induction'. The lactose operon is one\nexample of an inducible system.\n","linknr":214,"url":"Inducer_(biology)","recorded":1362538368,"links":13,"instances":["biology","genetics","genetics","genetics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Gene expression","Organic compounds"],"headings":["Function","Examples","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["operator","genetics"],["transcription","genetics"],["translation","genetics"],["operator","biology"],["activator","genetics"]],"members":["operator","activator","translation","transcription"],"related":["Molecular_biology","Molecule","Gene_expression","Repressor","Activator","Repressor","Operator_(genetics)","RNA_polymerase","Operon","Gene","Activator_DNA_sequences","Gene","DNA","Transcription_(genetics)","Messenger_RNA","Translation_(genetics)","Prokaryotes","Operator_(biology)","RNA_polymerase","Activator_(genetics)","Ligands","Lac_operon","Allolactose","Lactose","Î’-galactosidase","Glucose","Ara_operon","Arabinose"]}
