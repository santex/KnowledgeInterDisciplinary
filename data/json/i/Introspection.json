In psychology the process of introspection relies\nexclusively on observation of one's mental state, while in a spiritual context\nit may refer to the examination of one's soul. Introspection is closely related\nto human self-reflection and is contrasted with external observation.\n\nIntrospection generally provides a privileged access to our own mental\nstates, W. Seager,[http://www.sciencedirect.com.myaccess.library.utoronto.c-\na/science/article/pii/B9780123738738000712, Encyclopedia of Consciousness'\n'] not mediated by other sources of knowledge, so that individual\nexperience of the mind is unique. Introspection can determine any number of\nmental states including: sensory, bodily, cognitive, emotional and so\nforth. W. Seager,[http://www.sciencedirect.com.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca-\n/science/article/pii/B9780123738738000712, Encyclopedia ofConsciousness'']\n\nIntrospection has been a subject of philosophical discussion for thousands of\nyears. The philosopher Plato asked, \"â¦why should we not calmly and patiently\nreview our own thoughts, and thoroughly examine and see what these appearances\nin us really are?\" [[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]], 155 J\nPerner et al (2007). \"Introspection & remembering\". Synthese. Springer.\nWhile introspection is applicable to many facets of philosophical thought it is\nperhaps best known for its role in epistemology. In this context introspection\nis often compared with perception, reason, memory, and testimony as a source of\nknowledge. Epistemology. (2005).
