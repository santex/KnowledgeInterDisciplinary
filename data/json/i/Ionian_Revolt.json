At the heart of the rebellion was the\ndissatisfaction of the Greek cities of Asia Minor with the tyrants appointed by\nPersia to rule them, along with the individual actions of two Milesian tyrants,\nHistiaeus and Aristagoras. The cities of Ionia had been conquered by Persia\naround 540 BC, and thereafter were ruled by native tyrants, nominated by the\nPersian satrap in Sardis. In 499 BC, the then tyrant of Miletus, Aristagoras,\nlaunched a joint expedition with the Persian satrap Artaphernes to conquer\nNaxos, in an attempt to bolster his position. The mission was a debacle, and\nsensing his imminent removal as tyrant, Aristagoras chose to incite the whole of\nIonia into rebellion against the Persian king Darius the Great.\n\nIn 498 BC, supported by troops from Athens and Eretria, the Ionians marched on,\ncaptured, and burnt Sardis. However, on their return journey to Ionia, they were\nfollowed by Persian troops, and decisively beaten at the Battle of Ephesus. This\ncampaign was the only offensive action by the Ionians, who subsequently went on\nthe defensive. The Persians responded in 497 BC with a three pronged attack\naimed at recapturing the outlying areas of the rebellion, but the spread of the\nrevolt to Caria meant that the largest army, under Daurises, relocated there.\nWhile initially campaigning successfully in Caria, this army was annihilated in\nan ambush at the Battle of Pedasus. This resulted in a stalemate for the rest of\n496 BC and 495 BC.\n\nBy 494 BC the Persian army and navy had regrouped, and they made straight for\nthe epicentre of the rebellion at Miletus. The Ionian fleet sought to defend\nMiletus by sea, but were decisively beaten at the Battle of Lade, after the\ndefection of the Samians. Miletus was then besieged, captured, and its\npopulation was brought under Persian rule. This double defeat effectively ended\nthe revolt, and the Carians surrendered to the Persians as a result. The\nPersians spent 493 BC reducing the cities along the west coast that still held\nout against them, before finally imposing a peace settlement on Ionia which was\ngenerally considered to be both just and fair.\n\nThe Ionian Revolt constituted the first major conflict between Greece and the\nPersian Empire, and as such represents the first phase of the Greco-Persian\nWars. Although Asia Minor had been brought back into the Persian fold, Darius\nvowed to punish Athens and Eretria for their support of the revolt. Moreover,\nseeing that the myriad city states of Greece posed a continued threat to the\nstability of his Empire, according to Herodotus, Darius decided to conquer the\nwhole of Greece. In 492 BC, the first Persian invasion of Greece, the next\nphase of the Greco-Persian Wars, would begin as a direct consequence of the\nIonian Revolt.\n","linknr":833,"url":"Ionian_Revolt","recorded":1362537959,"links":52,"instances":["tyrant","aeolis","anatolia","city","asia_minor","son_of_artaphernes","general"],"pdf":[],"categories":["5th-century BC conflicts","Ionian Revolt|","Revolts in Greek Antiquity","Battles involving the Achaemenid Empire","Wars involving ancient Greece","Wars involving Athens","Wars involving Cyprus","Ionia|Revolt"],"headings":["Sources","Background","Naxos campaign (499 BC)","Start of the Ionian Revolt (499 BC)","Ionian offensive (498 BC)","Persian counter-offensive (497&ndash;495 BC)","End of the revolt (494&ndash;493 BC)","Aftermath","Significance","References","Bibliography"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/Anatolia_Ancient_Regions_base.svg/300px-Anatolia_Ancient_Regions_base.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/ba/Darius-Vase.jpg/200px-Darius-Vase.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9b/Ionian_Revolt_Campaign_Map-en.svg/300px-Ionian_Revolt_Campaign_Map-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9b/Ancient_kingdoms_of_Cyprus_en.svg/300px-Ancient_kingdoms_of_Cyprus_en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e0/Miletus_agora.jpg/240px-Miletus_agora.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/22/Greek-Persian_duel.jpg/200px-Greek-Persian_duel.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/94/Symbol_support_vote.svg/15px-Symbol_support_vote.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["doris","asia_minor"],["melanthius","general"],["doris","asia_minor"],["colophon","city"],["cyme","aeolis"],["hippias","tyrant"],["dardania","anatolia"],["artaphernes","son_of_artaphernes"]],"members":["hippias","cyme","dardania","colophon","doris","artaphernes","melanthius"],"related":["Greco-Persian_Wars","Asia_Minor","Cyprus","Achaemenid_Empire","Ionia","Aeolis","Doris_(Asia_Minor)","Caria","Athens","Eretria","Cyprus","Achaemenid_Empire","Aristagoras","Charopinos","Hermophantus","Eualcides","Killed_in_Action","Melanthius_(general)","Dionysius_of_Phocaea","Histiaeus","Megabates","Artaphernes","Daurises","Hyamees","Otanes","Datis","Aeolis","Doris_(Asia_Minor)","Cyprus","Caria","Asia_Minor","Achaemenid_Empire","Tyranny","Miletus","Histiaeus","Aristagoras","Ionia","Satrap","Sardis","Artaphernes","Naxos_Island","Darius_the_Great","History_of_Athens","Eretria","Battle_of_Lade","Samos","Greece","Achaemenid_Empire","Greco-Persian_Wars","First_Persian_invasion_of_Greece","Herodotus","Thucydides","Siege_of_Sestos","Plutarch","Mycenaean_Greece","Asia_Minor","Aeolians","Dorians","Ionians","Lydia","Caria","Ionia","Miletus","Myus","Priene","Ephesus","Colophon_(city)","Lebedos","Teos","Clazomenae","Phocaea","Erythrae","Samos","Chios","Panionion","Croesus","Achaemenid_Empire","Cyrus_the_Great","Medes","Harpagus","Tyrant","Darius_the_Great","Aristagoras","Histiaeus","Thrace","Susa","Naxos_Island","Satrap","Artaphernes","Megabates","Hecataeus_of_Miletus","Myus","Mytilene","Mylasa","Temera","Cyme_(Aeolis)","Sparta","Cleomenes_I","Hippias_(tyrant)","Miletus","Lelantine_War","Phrygia","Sardis","Hellespont","Propontis","Byzantium","Caria","Cyprus","Otanes","Amathus","Onesilus","Salamis,_Cyprus","Gorgus","Amathus","Artybius","Phonecia","Daurises","Hymaees","Otanes","Hellespont","Dardania_(Anatolia)","Abydos,_Hellespont","Percote","Propontis","Cius","Troad","Büyük_Menderes_River","Zeus","Labraunda","Pedasus","Amphipolis","Susa","Bosporus","Ancient_Egypt","Cilicia","Phoenicia","Medes","Datis","Pedasus","Tigris","Aeaces","Messina","Sicily","Thasos","Atarneus","Myus","Malene","Ancient_Tenedos_","Second_Persian_invasion_of_Greece","Mardonius","Earth_and_water","First_Persian_invasion_of_Greece","Datis","Artaphernes_(son_of_Artaphernes)","Cyclades","Euboea","Siege_of_Eretria","Attica","Marathon","Battle_of_Marathon","Greco-Persian_Wars","Battle_of_Marathon","Battle_of_Thermopylae","Battle_of_Salamis","Hoplite","Second_Persian_invasion_of_Greece","Herodotus","Thucydides","Diodorus_Siculus","Cicero"]}
