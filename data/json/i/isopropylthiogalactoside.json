Unlike allolactose, the\nsulfur (S) atom creates a chemical bond which is non-hydrolyzable by the cell,\npreventing the cell from metabolizing or degrading the inductant; therefore the\nIPTG concentration remains constant. For induction, a sterile 1 M solution of\nIPTG is typically added by 1:1000 dilution into a logarithmically growing\nbacterial culture. Different final concentration of IPTG may be used.\n\nIPTG binds to the lac repressor and releases the tetrameric repressor from the\nlac operator in an allosteric manner, thereby allowing the transcription of\ngenes in the lac operon, such as the gene coding for beta-galactosidase, a\nhydrolase enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of Î²-galactosides into\nmonosaccharides. One advantage of IPTG for [[in vivo]] studies is that since it\ncannot be metabolized by E. coli its concentration remains constant and the rate\nof expression of lac p/o-controlled genes, is not a variable in the experiment.\nIPTG intake is independent on the action of lactose permease, since other\ntransport pathways are also involved.\n\nIn cloning experiments, colonies that have been transformed with the recombinant\nplasmid rather than a non-recombinant need to be identified. X-gal is a\nsubstance that can be metabolised by beta-galactosidase to produce a blue\nproduct. Thus cells expressing beta-galactosidase grown in the presence of X-gal\nand IPTG (to induce the expression) will turn blue. Where a DNA fragment has\nbeen inserted into the LacZ (one of the genes for beta-galactosidase) there will\nbe no action upon X-gal and the cells will not turn blue, thus identifying the\ncells that carry recombinant plasmid rather than non-recombinant plasmid.\n\nMany regulatory elements of the lac operon are used in inducible recombinant\nprotein systems; IPTG is an effective inducer in the concentration range of 100\nto 1.5 . Concentration used depends on the strength of induction required, as\nwell as the genotype of cells or plasmid used - if lacI q, a mutant\nthat over-produces the lac repressor, is present, then a higher concentration of\nIPTG may be necessary.\n","linknr":143,"url":"isopropylthiogalactoside","recorded":1362512877,"links":20,"instances":["genetics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Carbohydrates","Molecular biology"],"headings":["Other Names","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/IPTG2.svg/200px-IPTG2.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/AlphaHelixSection.svg/40px-AlphaHelixSection.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["transcription","genetics"]],"members":["transcription"],"related":["Molecular_biology","Allolactose","Lactose","Metabolite","Transcription_(genetics)","Lac_operon","Sulfur","Lac_repressor","Allosteric","Beta-galactosidase","Lactose_permease","X-gal","Beta-galactosidase","Beta-galactosidase","X-gal","Beta-galactosidase","X-gal","Recombinant_protein","X-gal","Protein_Data_Bank"]}
