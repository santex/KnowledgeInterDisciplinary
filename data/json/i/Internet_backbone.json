{"cursor":"12900","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":". This is a small look at the backbone of the Internet.]] The 'Internet\n  backbone' refers to the principal data routes between large, strategically\n  interconnected networks and core routers on the Internet. These data routes\n  are hosted by commercial, government, academic and other high-capacity network\n  centers, the Internet exchange points and network access points, that\n  interchange Internet traffic between the countries, continents and across the\n  oceans of the world. Internet service providers (often Tier 1 networks)\n  participate in Internet backbone exchange traffic by privately negotiated\n  interconnection agreements, primarily governed by the principle of settlement-\n  free peering.\n","linknr":278,"url":"Internet_backbone","recorded":1362538750,"links":30,"instances":["signal_processing","country","engineering","internet_company","computing","computer_science","network"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Internet architecture|Backbone, Internet"],"headings":["History","Architectural principles","Infrastructure","Modern backbone","Economy of the backbone","Regional backbone","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/Internet_map_1024.jpg/200px-Internet_map_1024.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Ambox_globe_content.svg/48px-Ambox_globe_content.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/Crystal_Clear_app_browser.png/28px-Crystal_Clear_app_browser.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["resilience","network"],["state","computer_science"],["redundancy","engineering"],["bandwidth","signal_processing"],["router","computing"],["genuity","internet_company"],["georgia","country"]],"members":["bandwidth","georgia","redundancy","genuity","router","state","resilience"],"related":["Computer_network","Core_router","Internet","Internet_exchange_point","Network_access_point","Internet_service_provider","Tier_1_network","Interconnect_agreement","Peering","National_Science_Foundation","NSFNET","IBM","MCI_Communications","Merit_Network","Network_access_point","Resilience_(network)","State_(computer_science)","Redundancy_(engineering)","Routing","Fiber_optic","Data_rates","Fiber-optic_communication","Bandwidth_(signal_processing)","Attenuation","Crosstalk","Electromagnetic_interference","AT&T_Inc.","MCI_Communications","Sprint_Nextel","CenturyLink","Internet_service_provider","Internet_exchange_point","Router_(computing)","Tier_1_network","Internet_transit","Cable&nbsp;&&nbsp;Wireless_Worldwide","UUNet","Sprint_Nextel","AT&T_Corporation","Genuity_(Internet_company)","Internet_transit","Competition_law","Federal_Communications_Commission","Egypt","Border_gateway_protocol","Europe","Level&nbsp;3_Communications","Virtual_private_network","Georgia_(country)","Armenia","India","Tata_Communications","BSNL","MTNL","Reliance_Communications","Data_center","Pune","Japan","Fiber-optic_communication","Nippon_Telegraph_and_Telephone","Backbone_network","Collapsed_backbone","Default-free_zone","Distributed_backbone","Internet2","Mbone","Network_service_provider","Parallel_backbone","Routing","Serial_backbone","Packet_switching","Trunking"]}
