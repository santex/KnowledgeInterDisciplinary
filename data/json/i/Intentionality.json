{"cursor":"23388","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Intentionality' is a philosophical concept defined by the Stanford Encyclopedia\nof Philosophy as \"the power of minds to be about, to represent, or to stand for,\nthings, properties and states of affairs.\" The term refers to the\nability of the mind to form representations and has nothing to do with\nintention. The term dates from medieval Scholastic philosophy, but was\nresurrected by Franz Brentano and adopted by Edmund Husserl. The earliest theory\nof intentionality is associated with St. Anselm's ontological argument for the\nexistence of God and his tenets distinguishing between objects that exist in the\nunderstanding and objects that exist in reality.\n","linknr":425,"url":"Intentionality","recorded":1362373677,"links":42,"instances":["philosopher","philosopher","epistemology","philosopher"],"pdf":["http://files.lfranchi.com/papers/sartre.and.freedom.pdf","http://files.lfranchi.com/papers/sartre.and.freedom.pdf","http://www.tcnj.edu/~lemorvan/JPR_Proof.pdf","http://www.tcnj.edu/~lemorvan/JPR_Proof.pdf"],"categories":["Psycholinguistics","Philosophy of mind","Consciousness studies","Intention"],"headings":["Modern overview","Intentionality vs. intensionality","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/Socrates.png/18px-Socrates.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["normative_principle","epistemology"],["charles_taylor","philosopher"],["donald_davidson","philosopher"],["michael_tye","philosopher"]],"members":["michael_tye","donald_davidson","normative_principle","charles_taylor"],"related":["Mind","Intention","Scholastic_philosophy","Franz_Brentano","Edmund_Husserl","Anselm_of_Canterbury","Ontological_argument","Existence_of_God","Philosophy","Psycholinguistics","Franz_Brentano","1874_in_literature","Teleological","Edmund_Husserl","Continental_philosophy","Analytic_philosophy","Jean-Paul_Sartre","Consciousness","Martin_Heidegger","Sentience","Existentialism","Ontology","Ontic","Gilbert_Ryle","A.J._Ayer","Nothing","Platonist","Roderick_Chisholm","Existence_independence","Truth-value_indifference","Opaque_context","Artificial_intelligence","Philosophy_of_mind","John_Searle","Chinese_room","Syntactic","Semantic","Daniel_Dennett","Natural_science","Eliminative_Materialism","Epistemological_realism","Normative_Principle_(epistemology)","Assumption_of_Rationality","Principle_of_charity","Projective_Principle","Roderick_Chisholm","G.E.M._Anscombe","Peter_Geach","Charles_Taylor_(philosopher)","W.V._Quine","Jerry_Fodor","Hilary_Putnam","Indeterminacy_of_translation","Wilfrid_Sellars","Folk_psychology","Intentional_stance","Donald_Davidson_(philosopher)","Ned_Block","Qualia","Michael_Tye_(philosopher)","John_Searle","Robert_K.C._Forman","Mystical_experience","Intension","Semantics","Alexius_Meinong","Franz_Brentano","A.J._Ayer","Albert_Camus","Consciousness","Superintelligence","Daniel_Dennett","Georges_Dreyfus","Gilbert_Ryle","Intention","Jean-Paul_Sartre","Millan_Puelles","John_Searle","Edmund_Husserl","Martin_Heidegger","Mind-body_problem","Thomas_Nagel","Wilfrid_Sellars","Ruth_Millikan","Aboutness"]}
