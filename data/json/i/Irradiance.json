{"cursor":"4045","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Irradiance' is the power of electromagnetic radiation per unit area (radiative\nflux) incident on a surface. 'Radiant emittance' or 'radiant exitance' is the\npower per unit area radiated by a surface. The SI units for all of these\nquantities are watts per square meter (W/m 2), while the cgs units are\nergs per square centimeter per second (ergÂ·cm â2 Â·s â1 , often\nused in astronomy). These quantities are sometimes called intensity, but this\nusage leads to confusion with radiant intensity, which has different units.\n\nAll of these quantities characterize the total amount of radiation present, at\nall frequencies. It is also common to consider each frequency in the spectrum\nseparately. When this is done for radiation incident on a surface, it is called\n'spectral irradiance', and has SI units W/m 3, or commonly\nWÂ·m â2 Â·nm â1 .\n\nIf a point source radiates light uniformly in all directions through a non-\nabsorptive medium, then the irradiance decreases in proportion to the square of\nthe distance from the object.\n","linknr":230,"url":"Irradiance","recorded":1362897429,"links":28,"instances":["optics","physics","physics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Physical quantities","Radiometry"],"headings":["Technical details","Solar energy","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/math/6/a/2/6a22da7a88c5ed000c60d647d3c27f1f.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/a/8/4a8a08f09d37b73795649038408b5f33.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/1/7/2/17275b2a70ef04e27576d6abeb9c8d0d.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/6/6/1/661cb9a9fadf9b56a1d176ec19e7212d.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["power","physics"],["intensity","physics"],["photometry","optics"]],"members":["photometry","power","intensity"],"related":["Power_(physics)","Electromagnetic_radiation","Area","Radiative_flux","SI","Watt","Centimeter-gram-second","Erg","Square_centimeter","Second","Astronomy","Intensity_(physics)","Radiant_intensity","Electromagnetic_spectrum","Complex_number","Amplitude","Electric_field","Refractive_index","Speed_of_light","Vacuum","Vacuum_permittivity","Poynting_vector","Integral","Insolation","Radiometry","Spectral_flux_density","Photometry_(optics)","Albedo","Illuminance","Fluence","Insolation","Light_diffusion","PI_curve","Solar_azimuth_angle","Solar_irradiation","Solar_noon","Stefan–Boltzmann_law"]}
