{"cursor":"2401","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Ice crystals' are solid ice exhibiting atomic ordering on various length scales\nand include hexagonal columns, hexagonal plates, dendritic crystals, and diamond\ndust. The highly symmetric shapes are due to depositional growth, namely, direct\ndeposition of water vapour onto the ice crystal. Depending on environmental\ntemperature and humidity, ice crystals can develop from the initial hexagonal\nprism into numerous symmetric shapes. Possible shapes for ice crystals are\ncolumns, needles, plates and dendrites. If the crystal migrates into regions\nwith different environmental conditions, the growth pattern may change, and the\nfinal crystal may show mixed patterns. An example are capped columns. Ice\ncrystals tend to fall with their major axis aligned along the horizontal, and\nare thus visible in polarimetric weather radar signatures with enhanced\n(positive) differential reflectivity values. Electrification of ice crystals can\ninduce alignments different from the horizontal. Electrified ice crystals are\nalso well detectable by polarimetric weather radars.\n\nTemperature and water vapor humidity determine crystalline forms. Ice crystals\nare responsible for various atmospheric optics displays.\n\nIce clouds are composed of ice crystals, the most notable being cirrus clouds\nand ice fog. The slight whitening of a clear blue sky caused by ice crystals\nhigh in the troposphere can be a sign that a weather front (and rain) is\napproaching, as moist air is carried to high levels and freezes to ice crystals.\n\n.
