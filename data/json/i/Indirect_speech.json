{"cursor":"9149","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Indirect speech', also called 'reported speech' or 'indirect discourse', is\na means of expressing the content of statements, questions or other\nutterances, without quoting them explicitly as is done in direct speech. For\nexample, He said \"I'm coming\" is direct speech, whereas He said he was coming\nis indirect speech.\n\nIn terms of grammar, indirect speech often makes use of certain syntactic\nstructures such as content clauses (\"that\" clauses, such as (that) he was\ncoming), and sometimes infinitive phrases. References to questions in indirect\nspeech frequently take the form of interrogative content clauses, also called\nindirect questions (such as whether he was coming).\n\nIn indirect speech certain grammatical categories are changed relative to the\nwords of the original sentence. For example, person may change as a\nresult of a change of speaker or listener (as I changes to he in the example\nabove). In some languages, including English, the tense of verbs is often\nchanged â this is often called sequence of tenses. Some languages have a change\nof mood: Latin switches from indicative to the infinitive (for statements) or\nthe subjunctive (for questions). Allen, Joseph Henry; Greenough, James\nBradstreet; D'Ooge, Benjamin Leonard.\n[http://books.google.com/books?id=Q7cAAAAAYAAJ New Latin Grammar for schools and\ncolleges]. Ginn, 1916. :page 584, paragraph 580: declaratory sentences in\nindirect discourse; :p. 380, par. 586: questions in indirect discourse.\n\nWhen written, indirect speech is not normally enclosed in quotation marks or any\nsimilar typographical devices for indicating that a direct quotation is being\nmade. However such devices are sometimes used to indicate that the indirect\nspeech is a faithful quotation of someone's words (with additional devices such\nas square brackets and ellipses to indicate deviations or omissions from those\nwords), as in He informed us that \"after dinner [he] would like to make an\nannouncement\".\n","linknr":149,"url":"Indirect_speech","recorded":1363417896,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Indirect_speech&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Indirect_speech&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/Utterance","/wiki/Direct_speech","/wiki/Grammar","/wiki/Syntax","/wiki/Content_clause","/wiki/Infinitive_phrase","/wiki/Indirect_question","/wiki/Grammatical_category","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Grammatical_person","/wiki/English_language","/wiki/Grammatical_tense","/wiki/Sequence_of_tenses","/wiki/Grammatical_mood","/wiki/Latin","/wiki/Realis_mood#Indicative","/wiki/Infinitive","/wiki/Subjunctive_mood","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Quotation_mark","/wiki/Square_brackets","/wiki/Ellipsis","#Changes_in_form","#Examples","#English","#Latin","#Russian","#Free_indirect_speech","#References","/w/index.php?title=Indirect_speech&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Referent","/wiki/Origo","/wiki/Personal_pronoun","/wiki/Pro-drop","/wiki/Demonstrative","/wiki/Tense_(linguistics)","/wiki/Mood_(linguistics)","/w/index.php?title=Indirect_speech&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=Indirect_speech&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/English_language","/wiki/Sequence_of_tenses","/wiki/Uses_of_English_verb_forms#Indirect_speech","#cite_note-3","#cite_note-Downing-4","#cite_note-McArthur-5","#cite_note-Downing-4","#cite_note-McArthur-5","/w/index.php?title=Indirect_speech&action=edit&section=4","/wiki/Latin_grammar","/wiki/Law_of_excluded_middle","/wiki/Copula_(linguistics)","/w/index.php?title=Indirect_speech&action=edit&section=5","/wiki/Russian_language","/wiki/Slavic_language","/w/index.php?title=Indirect_speech&action=edit&section=6","/wiki/Free_indirect_speech","/wiki/Direct_speech","/wiki/Free_indirect_speech","/w/index.php?title=Indirect_speech&action=edit&section=7","#cite_ref-1","http://www.sil.org/linguistics/GlossaryOflinguisticTerms/WhatIsIndirectSpeech.htm","http://www.sil.org/linguistics/GlossaryOflinguisticTerms/WhatIsIndirectSpeech.htm","#cite_ref-2","http://books.google.com/books?id=Q7cAAAAAYAAJ","#cite_ref-3","#cite_ref-Downing_4-0","#cite_ref-Downing_4-1","#cite_ref-McArthur_5-0","#cite_ref-McArthur_5-1","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Indirect_speech&oldid=540935940","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Semantic_units","/wiki/Category:Syntactic_entities","/wiki/Category:Articles_containing_Latin_language_text","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Indirect+speech&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Indirect+speech","/wiki/Indirect_speech","/wiki/Talk:Indirect_speech","#","/wiki/Indirect_speech","/w/index.php?title=Indirect_speech&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Indirect_speech&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Indirect_speech","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Indirect_speech","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Indirect_speech&oldid=540935940","/w/index.php?title=Indirect_speech&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Indirect_speech&id=540935940","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Indirect+speech","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Indirect+speech&oldid=540935940&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Indirect_speech&printable=yes","//ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estil_indirecte","//de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indirekte_Rede","//es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estilo_indirecto","//fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discours_indirect","//gl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estilo_indirecto","//it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discorso_indiretto","//hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/F%C3%BCgg%C5%91_besz%C3%A9d","//nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indirecte_rede","//simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indirect_speech","//uk.wikipedia.org/
