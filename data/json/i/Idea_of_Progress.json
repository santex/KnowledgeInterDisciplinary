{"cursor":"32939","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nIn historiography, the 'Idea of Progress' is the theory that advances in\ntechnology, science, and social organization inevitably produce an improvement\nin the human condition. That is, people can become happier in terms of quality\nof life (social progress) through economic development (modernization), and the\napplication of science and technology (scientific progress). The assumption is\nthat the process will happen once people apply their reason and skills, for it\nis not divinely foreordained. The role of the expert is to identify hindrances\nthat slow or neutralize progress.\n\nHistorian J. B. Bury wrote in 1920: Bury, Idea of Progress p. 2\n\n\nSociologist Robert Nisbet finds that \"No single idea has been more important\nthan...the Idea of Progress in Western civilization for three thousand\nyears.\", Nisbet, History of the Idea of Progress (1980) p. 4 and\ndefines five \"crucial premises\" of Idea of Progress:\n# value of the past, nobility of Western civilization, worth of\n# economic/technological growth, faith in reason and scientific/scholarly\n# knowledge obtained through reason, intrinsic importance and worth of life\n# on earth.\n\nThe Idea of Progress emerged primarily in the Enlightenment in the 18th century.\nSignificant movements in this period were Diderot's\n[[EncyclopÃ©die|Encyclopedia]], which carried on the campaign against authority\nand superstition, and the French Revolution.\n\nSome scholars consider the idea of progress that was affirmed with the\nEnlightenment, as a secularization of ideas from early Christianity, and a\nrework of ideas from ancient\nGreece.

The idea\nwas challenged by many in the 20th century who argued that that destruction, as\nin the two world wars, could grow out of technical progress and belie the basic\npremise of the Idea of Progress. It remains a matter of debate among\nintellectuals.\n","linknr":311,"url":"Idea_of_Progress","recorded":1362890216,"links":14,"instances":["history","historian"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Theories of history","Metanarratives"],"headings":["History","Economic development","Status of women","Criticisms","See also","References","Bibliography"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/11/View_from_the_Botanical_Garden_Funchal.JPG/200px-View_from_the_Botanical_Garden_Funchal.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["william_robertson","historian"],["progress","history"]],"members":["progress","william_robertson"],"related":["Historiography","Social_progress","Modernization","Scientific_progress","J._B._Bury","Robert_Nisbet","Age_of_Enlightenment","Authority","Superstition","French_Revolution","Secularization","Ancient_Greece","J._B._Bury","Ancient_Greece","Original_sin","Golden_Age","Epicureanism","Atomism","Democritus","Robert_Nisbet","Gertrude_Himmelfarb","Xenophanes","Plato","Seneca_the_Younger","Millenarianism","Bernard_le_Bovier_de_Fontenelle","John_Locke","Diderot","Holbach","Condorcet","Founding_Fathers","Age_of_Enlightenment","Voltaire","Anne-Robert-Jacques_Turgot,_Baron_de_Laune","Condorcet","Immanuel_Kant","Adam_Ferguson","Benjamin_Franklin","Tom_Paine","Thomas_Jefferson","John_Adams","Empire_of_Liberty","Republicanism","French_Revolution","American_Dream","Classical_liberals","John_Stuart_Mill","Herbert_Spencer","Libertarians","Peter_the_Great","Juan_Bautista_Alberdi","Classical_liberalism","KMT","Mao_Zedong","Deng_Xiaoping","Alfred_Marshall","William_Robertson_(historian)","Edmund_Burke","Republicanism","Madeira_Island","Thomas_Malthus","Friedrich_Nietzsche","Oswald_Spengler","World_War_I","Arnold_J._Toynbee","Montague_David_Eder","Karl_Popper","Kirkpatrick_Sale","Neo-luddism","Bright_green_environmentalism","Climate_change","Peak_oil","Kirkpatrick_Sale","Deep_Ecology","Meliorism","Modernization_theory","Philosophical_progress","Progress_(history)","Scientific_progress","Social_progress","Georg_Henrik_von_Wright"]}
