      "text" : "\n\n\n'Investment' has different meanings in finance and economics.\n\nIn economics, investment is related to saving and deferring consumption.\nInvestment is involved in many areas of the economy, such as business management\nand finance whether for households, firms, or governments.\n\nIn finance, investment is putting money into an asset with the expectation of\ncapital appreciation, usually over the long-term future. This may or may not be\nbacked by research and analysis. Most or all forms of investment involve some\nform of risk, such as investment in equities, property, and even fixed interest\nsecurities which are subject, inter alia, to inflation risk.\n\nIn contrast putting money into something with a hope of short-term gain, with or\nwithout thorough analysis, is gambling or speculation. This category would\ninclude most forms of derivatives, which incorporate a risk element without\nbeing long-term homes for money, and betting on horses. It would also include\npurchase of e.g. a company share in the hope of a short-term gain without any\nintention of holding it for the long term. Under the efficient market\nhypothesis, all investments with equal risk should have the same expected rate\nof return: that is to say there is a trade-off between risk and expected return.\nBut that does not prevent one from investing in risky assets over the long term\nin the hope of benefiting from this trade-off. The common usage of investment to\ndescribe speculation has had an effect in real life as well: it reduced investor\ncapacity to discern investment from speculation, reduced investor awareness of\nrisk associated with speculation, increased capital available to speculation,\nand decreased capital available to investment.\n",
