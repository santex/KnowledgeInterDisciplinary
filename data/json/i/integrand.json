Given\na function f of a real variable x and an interval of the real line, the\n'definite integral'\n\n: <math>\\int_a^b \\! f(x)\\,dx \\,</math>\n\nis defined informally to be the signed area of the region in the xy-plane\nbounded by the graph of f, the x-axis, and the vertical lines a}} and b}}, such\nthat area above the x-axis adds to the total, and that below the x-axis\nsubtracts from the total.\n\nThe term integral may also refer to the notion of the antiderivative, a function\nF whose derivative is the given function f. In this case, it is called an\nindefinite integral and is written:\n:<math>F = \\int f(x)\\,dx.</math>\nThe integrals discussed in this article are termed definite integrals.\n\nThe principles of integration were formulated independently by Isaac Newton and\nGottfried Leibniz in the late 17th century. Through the fundamental theorem of\ncalculus, which they independently developed, integration is connected with\ndifferentiation: if f is a continuous real-valued function defined on a closed\ninterval , then, once an antiderivative F of f is known, the definite integral\nof f over that interval is given by\n\n:<math>\\int_a^b \\! f(x)\\,dx = F(b) - F(a)\\,</math>\n\nIntegrals and derivatives became the basic tools of calculus, with numerous\napplications in science and engineering. The founders of the calculus thought of\nthe integral as an infinite sum of rectangles of infinitesimal width. A rigorous\nmathematical definition of the integral was given by Bernhard Riemann. It is\nbased on a limiting procedure which approximates the area of a curvilinear\nregion by breaking the region into thin vertical slabs. Beginning in the\nnineteenth century, more sophisticated notions of integrals began to appear,\nwhere the type of the function as well as the domain over which the integration\nis performed has been generalised. A line integral is defined for functions of\ntwo or three variables, and the interval of integration is replaced by a certain\ncurve connecting two points on the plane or in the space. In a surface integral,\nthe curve is replaced by a piece of a surface in the three-dimensional space.\nIntegrals of differential forms play a fundamental role in modern differential\ngeometry. These generalizations of integrals first arose from the needs of\nphysics, and they play an important role in the formulation of many physical\nlaws, notably those of electrodynamics. There are many modern concepts of\nintegration, among these, the most common is based on the abstract mathematical\ntheory known as Lebesgue integration, developed by Henri Lebesgue.\n","title":"Integral","headings":["History","Terminology and notation","Introduction","Formal definitions","Properties","Fundamental theorem of calculus","Extensions","Methods for computing
