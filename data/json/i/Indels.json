Buettner VL, Hill KA, Halangoda A, Sommer\nSS. 1999. Tandem-based mutations occur in mouse liver and adipose tissue\npreferentially as G:C to T:A transversions and accumulate with age.

It has been shown that\ngenomic regions with multiple indels can also be used for species-identification\nprocedures.\n\nAn indel change of a single DNA base encoding part of an mRNA results in a\n\"frameshift\" when translating the mRNA and perhaps reading on to an\ninappropriate (premature) stop codon in a different frame. Indels that are not\nmultiples of 3 are particularly uncommon in coding regions but relatively common\nin non-coding regions. There are approximately 192-280 frameshifting indels in\neach person. Note, however, the absolute rate of indels in most known\ngenomes, including humans, tends to be markedly lower than base substitutions,\nexcept near highly repetitive regions, including homopolymers and\nmicrosatellites.\n\nThe term \"indel\" has been co-opted in recent years by genome scientists for use\nin the sense described above. This is a change from its original use and\nmeaning, which arose from systematics. In systematics, researchers could find\ndifferences between sequences, such as from two different species. But it was\nimpossible to infer if one species lost the sequence or the other species gained\nit. For example, species A has a run of 4 G nucleotides at a locus and species B\nhas 5 G's at the same locus. If the mode of selection is unknown, one can not\ntell if species A lost one G (a \"deletion\" event\") or species B gained one G (an\n\"insertion\" event). When one cannot infer the phylogenetic direction of the\nsequence change, the sequence change event is referred to as an \"indel\".\n","linknr":211,"url":"Indels","recorded":1362483987,"links":16,"instances":["genetics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Mutation","Genetics","Molecular biology"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["microsatellite","genetics"]],"members":["microsatellite"],"related":["Coding_region","Frameshift_mutation","Bloom_syndrome","Nucleotides","Phylogenetic","MRNA","Stop_codon","Microsatellite_(genetics)","Science","Systematics","Guanine","Phylogeny"]}
