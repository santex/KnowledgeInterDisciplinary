It was part of a popular genre\nof biblical work, written to satisfy a hunger among early Christians for more\nmiraculous and anecdotal stories of the childhood of Jesus than the Gospel of\nLuke provided. Later references by Hippolytus of Rome and Origen of Alexandria\nto a Gospel of Thomas are more likely to be referring to this Infancy Gospel\nthan to the wholly different [[Gospel of Thomas]] with which it is sometimes\nconfused. It would appear to be unrelated to the Canonical Gospels.\n","linknr":152,"url":"Infancy_Gospel_of_Thomas","recorded":1362570021,"links":27,"instances":["apostle"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Syriac literature|Thomas, Infancy Gospel of","Infancy Gospels|Thomas","Gnostic Gospels","2nd-century manuscripts","3rd-century manuscripts","Thomas the Apostle"],"headings":["Author","Dating","Manuscript tradition","Content","Syriac Infancy Gospel","Further reading","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/38px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["thomas","apostle"]],"members":["thomas"],"related":["Pseudepigraphical","Jesus","Jesus","Gospel_of_Luke","Hippolytus_of_Rome","Origen_of_Alexandria","Thomas_(apostle)","Gospel_of_Luke","Shabbat","Passover","Irenaeus","Montague_Rhodes_James","Palimpsest","Trickster","Greek_mythology","Blindness","James_the_Just","Syriac_Infancy_Gospel","Josephus"]}
