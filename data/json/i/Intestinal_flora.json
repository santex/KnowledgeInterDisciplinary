In this context, gut is synonymous with\nintestinal, and flora with microbiota and microflora, the word microbiome is\nalso in use.\n\nThe human body carries about 100 trillion microorganisms in its intestines, a\nnumber ten times greater than the total number of human cells in the body. The metabolic activities\nperformed by these bacteria resemble those of an organ, leading some to liken\ngut bacteria to a \"forgotten\" organ. It is estimated that\nthese gut flora have around a hundred times as many genes in aggregate as there\nare in the human genome.\n\nBacteria make up most of the flora in the colon University of Glasgow. 2005.

Accessed May 22,\n2008 and up to 60% of the dry mass of feces. Somewhere between 300\nand 1000 different species live in the gut, with most estimates\nat about 500.\nHowever, it is probable that 99% of the bacteria come from about 30 or 40\nspecies. Fungi and protozoa also make\nup a part of the gut flora, but little is known about their activities.\n\nResearch suggests that the relationship between gut flora and humans is not\nmerely commensal (a non-harmful coexistence), but rather a mutualistic\nrelationship. Though people can survive without gut flora, the microorganisms perform a host of useful functions, such as\nfermenting unused energy substrates, training the immune system, preventing\ngrowth of harmful, pathogenic bacteria, regulating the development of the gut, producing vitamins for the host\n(such as biotin and vitamin K), and producing hormones to direct the host to\nstore fats. However, in certain conditions, some species are thought to be\ncapable of causing disease by producing infection or increasing cancer risk for\nthe host.\n\nOver 99% of the bacteria in the gut are anaerobes, but in the cecum,\naerobic bacteria reach high densities.\n","linknr":962,"url":"Intestinal_flora","recorded":1362501002,"links":39,"instances":["food","microbiology","nutrition","food","anatomy","biology","food","anatomy","biochemistry"],"pdf":["http://www.dms.ufsc.br/mip7013/arquivos/2550_Gut%20flora%20in%20health%20and%20disease.pdf","http://www.dms.ufsc.br/mip7013/arquivos/2550_Gut%20flora%20in%20health%20and%20disease.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20040526195616/http://www.gla.ac.uk/departments/humannutrition/students/resources/meden/Infection.pdf","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mnfr.201000451/pdf"],"categories":["Gut
