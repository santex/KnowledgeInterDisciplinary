{"cursor":"21330","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Informal logic', intuitively, refers to the principles of logic and logical\nthought outside of a formal setting. However, perhaps because of the 'informal'\nin the title, the precise definition of 'informal logic' is a matter of some\ndispute. See Johnson 1999 for a survey of definitions. Ralph H.\nJohnson and J. Anthony Blair define informal logic as \"a branch of logic whose\ntask is to develop non-formal standards, criteria, procedures for the analysis,\ninterpretation, evaluation, criticism and construction of argumentation.\" Johnson, Ralph H., and Blair, J. Anthony (1987), \"The Current State\nof Informal Logic\", Informal Logic, 9(2â3), 147â151. Johnson & Blair added \"...\nin everyday discourse\" but in (2000), modified their definition, and broadened\nthe focus now to include the sorts of argument that occurs not just in everyday\ndiscourse but also disciplined inquiry—what Weinstein (1990) calls\n\"stylized discourse.\" This definition reflects what had been implicit in\ntheir practice and what others Scriven, 1976 Munson,\n1976 Fogelin, 1978 were doing in their informal logic texts.\n\nInformal logic is associated with (informal) fallacies, critical thinking, the\nThinking Skills Movement Resnick, 1989 and the interdisciplinary\ninquiry known as argumentation theory. Frans H. van Eemeren writes that the\nlabel \"informal logic\" covers a \"collection of normative approaches to the study\nof reasoning in ordinary language that remain closer to the practice of\nargumentation than formal logic.\"\n","linknr":557,"url":"Informal_logic","recorded":1362897115,"links":28,"instances":["philosopher","mathematical_logic","logic"],"pdf":["http://www.humanities.mcmaster.ca/~hitchckd/25.pdf","http://www.humanities.mcmaster.ca/~hitchckd/informal.pdf"],"categories":["Logic","Critical thinking"],"headings":["History","Proposed definitions","Criticisms","Relation to critical thinking","Relation to argumentation theory","See also","Footnotes","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/Logical_connectives_Hasse_diagram.svg/20px-Logical_connectives_Hasse_diagram.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["ralph_johnson","philosopher"],["ralph_johnson","philosopher"],["structure","mathematical_logic"],["lemma","logic"]],"members":["ralph_johnson","structure","lemma"],"related":["Logic","Formal_logic","Ralph_Johnson_(philosopher)","J._Anthony_Blair","Critical_thinking","Thinking_Skills_Movement","Argumentation_theory","Frans_H._van_Eemeren","Philosophy","Symbolic_logic","Logic","Pedagogical","Textbooks","Howard_Kahane","Michael_Scriven","Ralph_Johnson_(philosopher)","J._Anthony_Blair","Monroe_Beardsley","Stephen_Toulmin","Keynote_address","World_Congress_of_Philosophy","Frans_H._van_Eemeren","Argumentation","Stephen_Toulmin","Chaïm_Perelman","University_of_Windsor","American_Forensic_Association","Plato","Theory_of_forms","Metaphysics","Aristotelianism","Validity","Premise","Logical_form","Structure_(mathematical_logic)","Capital_punishment","Deduction","Conductive_argument","Dialectic","Discourse","Formal_language","Natural_language","Validity","Psychology","Critical_thinking","Logical_consequence","Argument_map","Informal_fallacy","Inference_objection","Lemma_(logic)","Philosophy_of_language","Semantics","Johnson,_R._H.","D._Gabbay","J._Woods","Doug_Walton","Woods,_J.","Open_access_journal"]}
