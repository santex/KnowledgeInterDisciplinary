In his comments to\nthe poem Asimov wrote that originally it was \"Why, stars above, it's Asimov\",\nand when someone suggested to use \"mazel tov\" instead, Asimov accepted this as a\nsignificant improvement. born 'Isaak Yudovich Ozimov'; ; c. January 2, 1920 â\nApril 6, 1992) was an  American author and\nprofessor of biochemistry at Boston University, best known for his works of\nscience fiction and for his popular science books. Asimov was one of the most\nprolific writers of all time, having written or edited more than 500 books and\nan estimated 90,000 letters and postcards. His works have been\npublished in nine out of ten major categories of the Dewey Decimal System His only works in the 100sâwhich covers\nphilosophy and psychologyâwere forewords for The Humanist Way (1988) and In\nPursuit of Truth (1982), a festschrift in honor of philosopher Sir Karl Popper's\n80th birthday.\n\nAsimov is widely considered a master of hard science fiction and, along with\nRobert A. Heinlein and Arthur C. Clarke, he was considered one of the \"Big\nThree\" science fiction writers during his lifetime. Asimov's most\nfamous work is the ''Foundation'' Series; his other major series are\nthe ''Galactic Empire'' series and the ''Robot'' series. The Galactic Empire\nnovels are explicitly set in earlier history of the same fictional universe as\nthe Foundation Series. Later, beginning with [[Foundation's Edge]], he linked\nthis distant future to the Robot and Spacer stories, creating a unified \"future\nhistory\" for his stories much like those pioneered by Robert A. Heinlein and\npreviously produced by Cordwainer Smith and Poul Anderson. He wrote\nmany short stories, among them \"Nightfall\", which in 1964 was voted by the\nScience Fiction Writers of America the best short science fiction story of all\ntime. Asimov wrote the ''Lucky Starr'' series of juvenile science-fiction novels\nusing the pen name Paul French. Asimov, Isaac (1969) (in English) Opus 100\n(Anthology) Houghton Mifflin Harcourt \"So [Walter Bradbury] said, 'Use a\npseudonum.' And I did. I choose Paul French and...\"\n\nThe prolific Asimov also wrote mysteries and fantasy, as well as much non-\nfiction. Most of his popular science books explain scientific concepts in a\nhistorical way, going as far back as possible to a time when the science in\nquestion was at its simplest stage. He often provides nationalities, birth\ndates, and death dates for the scientists he mentions, as well as etymologies\nand pronunciation guides for technical terms. Examples include [[The Intelligent\nMan's Guide to Science|Guide to Science]], the three volume set [[Understanding\nPhysics]], [[Asimov's Chronology of Science and Discovery]], as well as works on\nastronomy, mathematics, the Bible, William Shakespeare's writing and chemistry.\n\nAsimov was a long-time member and Vice President of Mensa International, albeit\nreluctantly; he described some members of that organization as \"brain-proud and\naggressive about their IQs.\" {{Cite document\n | last = Asimov first = Isaac title = I, Asimov: A Memoir publisher=Doubleday\n | location= New York year = 1994 pages = 380 postscript =  }}\n | He took more joy in being president of the American Humanist\n | Association. The asteroid 5020 Asimov, a crater on the planet\n | Mars, a Brooklyn, New York elementary school, and one\n | Isaac Asimov literary award are named in his honor.\n","linknr":1615,"url":"Isaac_Asimov","recorded":1362484774,"links":129,"instances":["1886","band","asimov","asimov_short_story","author","robot","publisher","ny","crater","poetry","united_states","tv_series","asimov","biophysical","arts","short_story","fictional","asimov_short_story"],"pdf":["http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterA.pdf","http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterA.pdf","http://www.pbs.org/moyers/faithandreason/print/pdfs/woi%20asimov1.pdf","http://www.pbs.org/moyers/faithandreason/print/pdfs/woi%20asimov1.pdf"],"categories":["1919
