It is typically used in cost-\neffectiveness analysis. ICER is the ratio of the change in costs to incremental\nbenefits of a therapeutic intervention or treatment. Folland S, Goodman AC,\nStano M. Chapter 4: Economic Effiencey and Cost-Benefit Analysis. In: The\nEconomics of Health and Health Care. 6th Edition. 2010. Prentice Hall: Boston,\nMA. The equation for ICER is:  'ICER = (C1 â C2) / (E1 â\nE2)'  where C1 and E1 are the cost and effect in the intervention or\ntreatment group and where C2 and E2 are the cost and effect in the control care\ngroup.

Costs are usually\ndescribed in monetary units while benefits/effect in health status is measured\nin terms of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained or lost.

Accessed 20 March 2012.\n\n'Benefits of Using ICER' ICER provides a means of comparing projects or\ninterventions across various disease states and treatments. As seen in the\nequation above, a ratio is created with the units of cost per benefits/effect\nunit. By using this ratio, comparisons can be made between treatment modalities\nto determine which provides a more cost-effective therapy. ICER studies thus\nprovide an opportunity to help contain health care costs without adverse health\nconsequences.

Accessed 20\nMarch 2012. As health care costs have continued to rise, many new clinical\ntrials are attempting to integrate ICER into results to provide more evidence of\npotential benefit.

Value in Health, 2005; 8(5):521-533.\n\n'Controversies of Using ICER' Many people feel that basing health care\ninterventions on cost-effectiveness is a type of health care rationing and have\nexpressed concern that using ICER will limit the amount or types of treatments\nand interventions available to patients. Currently, the\nNational Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) of Englandâs\nNational Health Service (NHS) uses cost-effectiveness studies to determine if\nnew treatments or therapies provide better value relative to the treatment that\nis currently in use. With the number of cost-effectiveness studies rising, it is\nexpected for a cost-effectiveness ratio threshold to be established for the\nacceptance of reimbursement or formulary listing. However, there is currently no\nevidence that health care systems have determined such a threshold; Eichler\nHG, Kong SX, Gerth WC, Mavros P, Jonsson B. [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1524-\n4733.2004.75003.x/full Use of cost-effectiveness analysis in health-care\nresource allocation decision-making: How are cost-effectiveness thresholds\nexpected to emerge]? Value in Health, 2004; 7(5):518-528. without such a\nstandard, the interpretation of ICER analyses may not be uniform.\n\nThe concern that ICER may lead to rationing has affected policy makers in the\nUnited States. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 provided\nfor the creation of the independent Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute\n(PCORI). As part of its creation however, PCORI was not authorized to develop or\nuse cost-effectiveness analysis studies. The Senate Finance Committee in writing\nPPACA forbade PCORI from using âdollars-per-quality adjusted life year (or\nsimilar measure that discounts the value of a life because of an individualâs\ndisability) as a threshold to establish what type of health care is cost\neffective or recommended.â Wilkerson J.
