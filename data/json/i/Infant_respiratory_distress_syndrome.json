It can also result from a genetic problem\nwith the production of surfactant associated proteins. IRDS affects about 1% of\nnewborn infants and is the leading cause of death in preterm\ninfants.

(2002):1001-1011. St.\nLouis: Mosby. The incidence decreases with advancing gestational age,\nfrom about 50% in babies born at 26â28 weeks, to about 25% at 30â31 weeks. The\nsyndrome is more frequent in infants of diabetic mothers and in the second born\nof premature twins.\n\nIRDS is distinct from pulmonary hypoplasia, another leading cause of neonatal\ndeath that involves respiratory distress.\n","linknr":311,"url":"Infant_respiratory_distress_syndrome","recorded":1362482049,"links":23,"instances":["medical"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Pediatrics","Respiratory diseases","Intensive care medicine","Respiratory and cardiovascular disorders specific to the perinatal period"],"headings":["Clinical course","Histopathology","Pathophysiology","Prevention","Treatment","Related disorders","Famous victims","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["hypoxia","medical"]],"members":["hypoxia"],"related":["Syndrome","Premature_birth","Infant","Pulmonary_surfactant","Lung","Premature_birth","Gestational_age","Pulmonary_hypoplasia","Tachypnea","Tachycardia","Cyanosis","Apnea","Blood_sugar","Patent_ductus_arteriosus","Blood_pressure","Intracranial_hemorrhage","Histopathology","Hyaline","Alveoli","Pulmonary_surfactant","Pulmonary_alveolus","Lipid","Protein","Glycoprotein","Type_II_pneumocyte","Lamellar_bodies","Hyaline","Fibrin","Red_blood_cell","Neutrophil","Macrophage","Hypoxia_(medical)","Lung_volumes","Glucocorticoids","American_College_of_Obstetricians_and_Gynecologists","Royal_College_of_Medicine","Weeks_of_gestation","Amniocentesis","Lecithin-sphingomyelin_ratio","L/S_ratio","Phosphatidylglycerol","Surfactant-albumin_ratio","L/S_ratio","Continuous_positive_airway_pressure","Endotracheal_tube","Surfactant","Cow","Birth_weight","Perfluorocarbon","Bronchopulmonary_dysplasia","Extracorporeal_membrane_oxygenation","Gas_exchange","Cannulation","Vascular_resistance","Weeks_of_gestation","Cerebral_vasculature","Germinal_matrix","PH","Intraventricular_hemorrhage","Premature_newborn","Acute_respiratory_distress_syndrome","Transient_hyperammonemia_of_the_newborn","Patrick_Bouvier_Kennedy","John_F._Kennedy","Jacqueline_Kennedy","Freddie_Highmore","Pulmonary_hypoplasia"]}
