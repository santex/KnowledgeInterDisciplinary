{"cursor":"9129","size":14,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nIn telecommunication, 'intersymbol interference' ('ISI') is a form of distortion\nof a signal in which one symbol interferes with subsequent symbols. This is an\nunwanted phenomenon as the previous symbols have similar effect as noise, thus\nmaking the communication less reliable. ISI is usually caused by multipath\npropagation or the inherent non-linear frequency response of a channel causing\nsuccessive symbols to \"blur\" together. The presence of ISI in the system\nintroduces errors in the decision device at the receiver output. Therefore, in\nthe design of the transmitting and receiving filters, the objective is to\nminimize the effects of ISI, and thereby deliver the digital data to its\ndestination with the smallest error rate possible. Ways to fight intersymbol\ninterference include adaptive equalization and error correcting\ncodes.
