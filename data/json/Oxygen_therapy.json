variety of purposes in both chronic and acute patient care.\nOxygen is essential for cell metabolism, and in turn, tissue oxygenation is\nessential for all normal physiological functions.\n\nHigh blood and tissue levels of oxygen can be helpful or damaging, depending on\ncircumstances and oxygen therapy should be used to benefit the patient by\nincreasing the supply of oxygen to the lungs and thereby increasing the\navailability of oxygen to the body tissues, especially when the patient is\nsuffering from hypoxia and/or hypoxaemia.\n","linknr":709,"url":"Oxygen_therapy","recorded":1362477497,"links":44,"instances":["medicine","medical","medical","medicine","biology","medicine"],"pdf":["http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/med/research/hsri/emergencycare/prehospitalcare/jrcalcstakeholderwebsite/clinicalpracticeupdates/oxygen_guideline_combined_final_published_version_22apr09sb.pdf","http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/med/research/hsri/emergencycare/prehospitalcare/jrcalcstakeholderwebsite/clinicalpracticeupdates/oxygen_guideline_combined_final_published_version_22apr09sb.pdf","http://www.brit-thoracic.org.uk/Portals/0/Clinical%20Information/Emergency%20Oxygen/Emergency%20oxygen%20guideline/THX-63-Suppl_6.pdf","http://www.brit-thoracic.org.uk/Portals/0/Clinical%20Information/Emergency%20Oxygen/Emergency%20oxygen%20guideline/THX-63-Suppl_6.pdf","http://www.inspiredrc.com/POC%20AARC%20Dec%202006.pdf","http://www.inspiredrc.com/POC%20AARC%20Dec%202006.pdf","http://www.sma.org.sg/smj/4712/4712a2.pdf","http://www.phecit.ie/Documents/Clinical%20Practice%20Guidelines/EMT%203rd%20Edition%20CPGs/EMT%20Appendix%201%20Medication%20Formulary.pdf","http://www.phecit.ie/Documents/Clinical%20Practice%20Guidelines/EMT%203rd%20Edition%20CPGs/EMT%20Appendix%201%20Medication%20Formulary.pdf"],"categories":["Diving
