{"cursor":"7012","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Roch Carrier', OC (born 13 May 1937) is a Canadian novelist and author of\n\"contes\" (a very brief form of the short story). He is among the best known\nQuebec writers in English Canada. Philip Stratford, ed. Stories from QuÃ©bec, Van Nostrand Reinhold Ltd, 1974.\n>ISBN 0-442-29910-9\n\nHe was born in Sainte-Justine, Quebec and studied at the CollÃ¨ge St-Louis in New\nBrunswick, the UniversitÃ© de MontrÃ©al in Quebec, and at the Sorbonne, in Paris,\nFrance, where he received a doctorate in literature.\n\nFrom 1994 to 1997, he served as head of the Canada Council. In 1998, he ran as\nan electoral candidate for the Quebec Liberal Party under Jean Charest, in the\nriding of CrÃ©mazie. He was defeated by 309 votes.\n\nIn 1991, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada. From 1999 to 2004,\nCarrier was National Librarian of Canada. With Ian E. Wilson, the then\nNational Archivist, he developed the process to unify the National Archive and\nNational Library.\n\nIn 1992, Carrier's Prayers of a Very Wise Child (PriÃ¨res d'un enfant trÃ¨s trÃ¨s\nsage) won the Stephen Leacock Memorial Medal for Humour.\n\nCarrier championed Jacques Poulin's novel [[Volkswagen Blues]] in [[Canada\nReads|Canada Reads 2005]].\n\nAlso involved in theatre (having served as playwright at the ThÃ©Ã¢tre du Nouveau-\nMonde), Carrier has adapted La guerre, yes sir! and Floralie, oÃ¹ es-tu? for the\nstage. La guerre, yes sir! was produced as a play in 1970, was performed in\nEnglish at the Stratford festival, and has been made into a film. Floralie, oÃ¹\nes-tu? was performed by ThÃ©Ã¢tre du Nouveau-Monde in 1974. The trilogy consisting\nof these two novels and Il est par lÃ , le soleil sold better in English than in\nFrench.\n\nA quote from \"Le chandail de hockey\" (\"The Hockey Sweater\"), one of Carrier's\ncontes, is reprinted on the back of the Canadian five-dollar bill. The story,\nabout when Carrier was a young boy who orders a Montreal Canadiens sweater from\nthe Eaton's catalogue, but receives a Toronto Maple Leafs jersey instead, is\nconsidered by many to be a literary allegory for the linguistic and cultural\ntensions between English and French Canadians, and is thus considered essential\nreading for anybody who seeks to understand the complex realities of linguistic\nand cultural identity in Canada. But it is also a much-beloved children's story\nin anglophone Canada without such complex overtones as it may have in a broader\ncontext. The National Film Board of Canada has made this story into an animated\nshort film, narrated by Carrier in both the French and English versions. [h-\nttp://www.nfb.ca/animation/objanim/en/films/film.php?sort=director&director=Coh-\nen%2C+Sheldon&id=13316 Play films - Focus on Animation - ONF]\n\nHeartbreaks Along The Road (De l'amour dans la ferraille) is a work of magical\nrealism - he pokes fun at political and religious figures, using ridiculous\nscenarios, and exaggerated personality characteristics, while telling the story\nfrom different characters' points of view. There are many levels to his satire\nand his writing is flowery and descriptive.\n\nSheila Fischman has won various awards for translation of his books into\nEnglish.\n\nRoch Carrier Elementary School in Kanata, Ontario is named after him.\n\nRoch Carrier is the current president on the Board of Directors for the Society\nfor Educational Visits and Exchanges in Canada, or SEVEC.\n","linknr":149,"url":"Roch_Carrier","recorded":1375083040,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Roch_Carrier&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Roch_Carrier&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Roch_Carrier,_recent.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/Roch_Carrier%2C_recent.jpg/220px-Roch_Carrier%2C_recent.jpg","/wiki/File:Roch_Carrier,_recent.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Order_of_Canada","/wiki/Canada","/wiki/Short_story","#cite_note-st-1","/wiki/Sainte-Justine,_Quebec","/w/index.php?title=Coll%C3%A8ge_St-Louis&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/New_Brunswick","/wiki/Universit%C3%A9_de_Montr%C3%A9al","/wiki/University_of_Paris","/wiki/Paris","/wiki/France","/wiki/Canada_Council","/wiki/Quebec_general_election,_1998","/wiki/Quebec_Liberal_Party","/wiki/Jean_Charest","/wiki/Cr%C3%A9mazie_(electoral_district)","/wiki/Order_of_Canada","/wiki/Library_and_Archives_Canada","/wiki/Ian_E._Wilson","/wiki/Stephen_Leacock_Memorial_Medal_for_Humour","/wiki/Jacques_Poulin","/wiki/Volkswagen_Blues","/wiki/Canada_Reads","/wiki/Theatre","/wiki/Playwright","/w/index.php?title=Theatre_du_Nouveau-Monde&action=edit&redlink=1","#cite_note-st-1","/wiki/The_Hockey_Sweater","/wiki/Canadian_five-dollar_bill","/wiki/Montreal_Canadiens","/wiki/Eaton%27s","/wiki/Toronto_Maple_Leafs","/wiki/Allegory","/wiki/National_Film_Board_of_Canada","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Magical_realism","/wiki/Sheila_Fischman","/wiki/Kanata,_Ontario","/w/index.php?title=Roch_Carrier&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/File:Rcarrier.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fa/Rcarrier.jpg/250px-Rcarrier.jpg","/wiki/File:Rcarrier.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0887846262","/wiki/Canadian_literature","/w/index.php?title=Roch_Carrier&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-st_1-0","#cite_ref-st_1-1","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0442299109","#cite_ref-2","http://www.nfb.ca/animation/objanim/en/films/film.php?sort=director&director=Cohen%2C+Sheldon&id=13316","/w/index.php?title=Roch_Carrier&action=edit&section=3","http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=A1ARTA0001431","/wiki/The_Canadian_Encyclopedia","http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0140410/","/wiki/Internet_Movie_Database","http://www.collectionscanada.ca/50th/012009-204-e.html","/wiki/Library_and_Archives_Canada","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/61543190","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Roch_Carrier&oldid=554990309","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1937_births","/wiki/Category:Living_people","/wiki/Category:Canadian_librarians","/wiki/Category:Canadian_novelists","/wiki/Category:Canadian_short_story_writers","/wiki/Category:Canadian_writers_in_French","/wiki/Category:French_Quebecers","/wiki/Category:University_of_Paris_alumni","/wiki/Category:Officers_of_the_Order_of_Canada","/wiki/Category:Writers_from_Quebec","/wiki/Category:Stephen_Leacock_Award_winners","/wiki/Category:Royal_Military_College_Saint-Jean_people","/wiki/Category:Quebec_Liberal_Party_candidates_in_Quebec_provincial_elections","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Roch+Carrier&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Roch+Carrier","/wiki/Roch_Carrier","/wiki/Talk:Roch_Carrier","#","/wiki/Roch_Carrier","/w/index.php?title=Roch_Carrier&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Roch_Carrier&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wi
