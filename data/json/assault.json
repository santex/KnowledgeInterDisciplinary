It is both a crime and a tort and, therefore,\nmay result in either criminal or civil liability. Generally, the common law\ndefinition is the same in criminal and Tort Law. There is, however, an\nadditional Criminal Law category of assault consisting of an attempted but\nunsuccessful Battery. The term is often confused with battery, which involves\nphysical contact. The specific meaning of assault varies between countries, but\ncan refer to an act that causes another to apprehend immediate and personal\nviolence, or in the more limited sense of a threat of violence caused by an\nimmediate show of force.<ref>Arkansas Code, Title 5, Chapter 13, Subchapter 2, §\n205–207</ref><ref>California Penal Code, Part 1, Chapter 9, § 240</ref> Assault\nin some US jurisdictions and Scotland is defined more broadly still as any\nintentional physical contact with another person without their consent; but in\nthe majority of the United States, and in England and Wales and all other common\nlaw jurisdictions in the world, this is defined instead as battery. Some\njurisdictions have incorporated the definition of civil assault into the\ndefinition of the crime making it a criminal assault to intentionally cause\nanother person to apprehend a harmful or offensive contact.\n",
