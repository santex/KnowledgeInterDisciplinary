It does not say that one is greater than the other, or even\nthat they can be compared in size.\n\nIf the values in question are elements of an ordered set, such as the\nintegers or the real numbers, they can be compared in size. *The notation a <\nb means that a is 'less than' b. *The notation a > b means that a is 'greater\nthan' b. In either case, a is not equal to b. These relations are known as\n'strict inequalities'. The notation a < b may also be read as \"a is strictly\nlesser than b\".\n\nIn contrast to strict inequalities, there are two types of inequality relations\nthat are not strict: *The notation a ≤ b means that a is 'less than or equal to'\nb (or, equivalently, 'not greater than' b, or 'at most' b). *The notation a ≥ b\nmeans that a is 'greater than or equal to' b (or, equivalently, 'not less than'\nb, or 'at least' b)\n\nAn additional use of the notation is to show that one quantity is much greater\nthan another, normally by several orders of magnitude.\n\n*The notation a b means that a is 'much less than' b. (In measure theory,\nhowever, this notation is used for absolute continuity, an unrelated concept.)\n*The notation a b means that a is 'much greater than' b.\n","title":"Inequality%20%28mathematics%29","headings":["Properties","Ordered fields","Chained notation","Representing inequalities on the real number line","Inequalities between means","Power inequalities","Well-known inequalities","Complex numbers and inequalities","Vector inequalities","See also","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["6: Ordered_field","4: Real_number","3: Total_order","2: Addition","2: Multiplication","2: Positive_number","2: Negative_number","2: Multiplicative_inverse","1: Linear_programming","1: Mathematics","1: Ordered_set","1: Integer","1: Orders_of_magnitude","1: Measure_theory","1: Absolute_continuity#Absolute_continuity_of_measures","1: Converse_relation","1: Subtraction","1: Ordered_group","1: Additive_inverse","1: Monotonic_function","1: Domain_of_a_function","1: Natural_logarithm","1: Total_order#Strict_total_order","1: Logical_conjunction","1: Programming_language","1: Number_line","1: Harmonic_mean","1: Geometric_mean","1: Arithmetic_mean","1: Root_mean_square","1: Mathematical_olympiads","1: Mathematician","1: Azuma's_inequality","1: Bernoulli's_inequality","1: Boole's_inequality","1: CauchyâSchwarz_inequality","1: Chebyshev's_inequality","1: Chernoff's_inequality","1: CramÃ©r&ndash;Rao_inequality","1: Hoeffding's_inequality","1: HÃ¶lder's_inequality","1: Inequality_of_arithmetic_and_geometric_means","1: Jensen's_inequality","1: Kolmogorov's_inequality","1: Markov's_inequality","1: Minkowski_inequality","1: Nesbitt's_inequality","1: Pedoe's_inequality","1: PoincarÃ©_inequality","1: Triangle_inequality","1: Complex_number","1: Lexicographical_order","1: Column_vector","1: Binary_relation","1: Bracket","1: Fourier-Motzkin_elimination","1: Inequation","1: List_of_inequalities","1: Partially_ordered_set","1: Relational_operator","1: Elsevier","1: Ed_Pegg,_Jr.","1: Wolfram_Demonstrations_Project"]}
