      "text" : "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'Genetic engineering', also called 'genetic modification', is the direct\nmanipulation of an organism's genome using biotechnology. (Indirect genetic\nmodification through artificial selection has been practiced for centuries.) New\nDNA may be inserted in the host genome by first isolating and copying the\ngenetic material of interest using molecular cloning methods to generate a DNA\nsequence, or by synthesizing the DNA, and then inserting this construct into the\nhost organism. Genes may be removed, or \"knocked out\", using a nuclease. Gene\ntargeting is a different technique that uses homologous recombination to change\nan endogenous gene, and can be used to delete a gene, remove exons, add a gene,\nor introduce point mutations.\n\nAn organism that is generated through genetic engineering is considered to be a\ngenetically modified organism (GMO). The first GMOs were bacteria in 1973; GM\nmice were generated in 1974. Insulin-producing bacteria were commercialized in\n1982 and genetically modified food has been sold since 1994. Glofish, the first\nGMO designed as a pet, was first sold in the United States December in\n2003.<ref></ref>\n\nGenetic engineering techniques have been applied in numerous fields including\nresearch, agriculture, industrial biotechnology, and medicine. Enzymes used in\nlaundry detergent and medicines such as insulin and human growth hormone are now\nmanufactured in GM cells, experimental GM cell lines and GM animals such as mice\nor zebrafish are being used for research purposes, and genetically modified\ncrops have been commercialized.\n",
