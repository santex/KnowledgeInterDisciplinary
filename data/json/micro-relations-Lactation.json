The process occurs in\nall female mammals, although it predates mammals. In\nhumans the process of feeding milk is called [[breastfeeding]] or nursing.\n\nIn most species milk comes out of the mother's nipples; however, the\nplatypus (a non-placental mammal) releases milk through ducts in its\nabdomen. In only one species of mammal, the Dayak fruit bat, is milk\nproduction a normal male function.\n\nGalactopoiesis is the maintenance of milk production. This stage requires\nprolactin (PRL) and oxytocin.\n\nNewborn infants often produce some witch's milk.\n\nGalactorrhea is milk production unrelated to nursing, it can occur in males and\nfemales of many mammal species as result of hormonal imbalances or unusual\nphysiological stimuli.\n","linknr":449,"url":"Lactation","recorded":1362503021,"links":43,"instances":["medicine"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Animal physiology","Breastfeeding","Exocrine system","Glands","Reproduction in mammals","Milk","Secondary sexual characteristics","Breast milk"],"headings":["Purpose","Human lactation","Lactation without pregnancy, induced lactation, relactation","Evolution","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/62/White_Cat_Nursing_Four_Kittens_HQ.jpg/220px-White_Cat_Nursing_Four_Kittens_HQ.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/db/Pig_lactation.jpg/220px-Pig_lactation.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/91/Breastfeeding%28milkfinal%29.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/Lactation.jpg/220px-Lactation.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["stress","medicine"]],"members":["stress"],"related":["Milk","Mammary_gland","Mother","Female_mammals","Nipples","Platypus","Species","Dayak_fruit_bat","Milk","Prolactin","Oxytocin","Witch's_milk","Galactorrhea","Nutrition","Infertility","Pregnancy","Hormone","Milk_duct","Breast","Progesterone","Alveolar_gland","Estrogen","Prolactin","Tight_junction","Growth_hormone","ACTH","Glucocorticoids","Thyroid-stimulating_hormone","Oxytocin","Smooth_muscle","Uterus","Human_placental_lactogen","Placenta","Follicle_stimulating_hormone","Luteinizing_hormone","Colostrum","Childbirth","Colostrum","Antibody","Immunoglobulin_A","Endocrine","Postpartum","Autocrine","Breast_pump","Stress_(medicine)","Oxytocin","Surgery","Breast_feeding","Erotic_lactation","Male_lactation","Galactorrhea","Synapsid","Discus_fish","Therapsida","Crop_milk","Adenotrophic_viviparity","Tsetse_flies","Cockroach","Lactation_room","Galactogogue","Milk_line","Udder","Breastfeeding"]}
