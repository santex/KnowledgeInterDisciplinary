surnames","Scottish given names"],"text":"\n'Stewart' is a popular Scottish given name and surname. The word Stewart is\nderived from an occupational surname. It originally belonged to a person who\nwas a steward by profession. It is derived from a combination of two Old\nEnglish words, the word stig, which means house, and the word weard, which\nmeans guard. The first name translation of the word is often Stuart hence the\ndifference in the two.\n","title":"stewart","headings":["People","Places","Other","See also"]},"micro-relation":["1: Scottish_people","1: Stewart,_British_Columbia","1: Nipissing_District","1: Stewart_Island_/_Rakiura","1: Portstewart","1: Stewartby","1: Newton_Stewart","1: Stewart,_Indiana","1: Stewart,_Minnesota","1: Stewart,_Mississippi","1: Stewart,_Ohio","1: Stewart,_Tennessee","1: Stewart,_Texas","1: Stewart,_West_Virginia","1: Stewartstown,_Pennsylvania","1: Fort_Stewart","1: Stewart_County,_Georgia","1: Stewart_County,_Tennessee","1: Stewart_Air_National_Guard_Base","1: Stewart_International_Airport","1: Stewart_Manor,_New_York","1: Clan_Stewart","1: Clan_Stewart_of_Appin","1: Stewart_Grand_Prix","1: Stewart–Tolman_effect","1: Stewart's_Shops","1: Stewart's_theorem"]}
