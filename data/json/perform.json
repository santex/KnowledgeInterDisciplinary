a\nperformer or group of performers behave in a particular way for another group of\npeople, the audience. Choral music and ballet are examples. Usually the\nperformers participate in rehearsals beforehand. Afterwards audience members\noften applaud.\n\nThe means of expressing appreciation can vary by culture. Chinese performers\nwill clap with audience at the end of a performance; the return applause signals\n\"thank you\" to the audience.<ref car=></ref> In Japan, folk performing arts\nperformances commonly attract individuals who take photographs, sometimes\ngetting up to the stage and within inches of performer's faces.<ref></ref>\n\nSometimes the dividing line between performer and the audience may become\nblurred, as in the example of \"participatory theatre\" where audience members get\ninvolved in the production.\n\nTheatrical performances can take place daily or at some other regular interval.\nPerformances can take place at designated performance spaces (such as a theatre\nor concert hall), or in a non-conventional space, such as a subway station, on\nthe street, or in someone's home.\n","title":"Performance","headings":["Performance genres","Live performance event support overview","See also","References","Bibliography"]},"micro-relation":["2: Audience","2: Ballet","2: Recital","2: Busking","1: Performing_arts","1: Choral_music","1: Rehearsal","1: Japan","1: Participatory_theatre","1: Theatre","1: Genre","1: Concert","1: Music_competition","1: Opera","1: Operetta","1: Performance_dance","1: Musical_theater","1: Performance_art","1: Live_art","1: Performance_poetry","1: Storytelling","1: Music","1: Concert_hall","1: Singing","1: Dance","1: Actor","1: Mime_artist","1: Comedian","1: Conjurer","1: Baseball","1: Audio_electronics","1: Liquid_light_shows","1: Live_sound_mixing","1: Rock_concert","1: Rock_festival","1: Sound_technology","1: Stadiums","1: Stagecraft","1: Theaters"]}
