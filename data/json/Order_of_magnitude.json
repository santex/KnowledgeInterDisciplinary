{"cursor":"11280","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nAn 'order of magnitude' is the class of scale or magnitude of any amount, where\neach class contains values of a fixed ratio to the class preceding it. In its\nmost common usage, the amount being scaled is 10 and the scale is the (base 10)\nexponent being applied to this amount (therefore, to be an order of magnitude\ngreater is to be 10 times as large). Such differences in order of magnitude can\nbe measured on the logarithmic scale in \"decades\" (i.e. factors of ten).\n\nThe order of magnitude of a physical quantity is its magnitude in powers of ten\nwhen that physical quantity is expressed in powers of ten with one digit to the\nleft of decimal.\n\n\"We say two numbers have the same order of magnitude of a number if the big one\ndivided by the little one is less than 10. For example, 23 and 82 have the same\norder of magnitude, but 23 and 820 do not.\" John C.
