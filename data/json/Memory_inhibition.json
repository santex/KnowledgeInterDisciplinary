The scientific concept of memory inhibition should not be confused\nwith everyday uses of the word \"inhibition.\" Scientifically speaking, memory\ninhibition is a type of cognitive inhibition, which is the stopping or\noverriding of a mental process, in whole or in part, with or without\nintention.\n\nMemory inhibition is a critical component of an effective memory system. While\nsome memories are retained for a lifetime, most memories are\nforgotten. Wade, C., Tavris, C. (2011). Psychology (10th ed.). Upper Saddle\nRiver, NJ: Prentice Hall. ISBN 78-0205711468 According to evolutionary\npsychologists, forgetting is adaptive because it facilitates selectivity of\nrapid, efficient recollection. For example,\na person trying to remember where he parked his car would not want to remember\nevery place he has ever parked. In order to remember something, therefore, it is\nessential not only to activate the relevant information, but also to inhibit\nirrelevant information. \n\nThere are many memory phenomena that seem to involve inhibition, although there\nis often debate about the distinction between interference and inhibition.\n","linknr":421,"url":"Memory_inhibition","recorded":1362668431,"links":15,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www1.psych.purdue.edu/~nairne/pdfs/44.pdf"],"categories":["Memory processes","Unsolved problems in neuroscience"],"headings":["History","Empirical research on inhibition","Amnesia for trauma or abuse","Evidence against inhibition in memory","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Psychology","Memory","Interference_theory","Walter_Bowers_Pillsbury_","Georg_Elias_MÃ¼ller_","Behaviorism","Interference_theory","Associationism","Attention","Perception","Learning","Psycholinguistics","Cognitive_development","Aging","Learning_disabilities","Neuropsychology","Hippocampus","Henry_L._Roediger_III","Recovered_memory","Amnesia","Psychogenic_amnesia","Child_sexual_abuse","Traumatic_amnesia","Psychological_repression_","Emotion_and_memory","Interference_theory"]}
