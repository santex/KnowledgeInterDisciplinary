Only four of these experimental aircraft were\nbuilt with three entering flight testing. Two of the CL-84s crashed due to\nmechanical failures, but no loss of life occurred as a result of these\naccidents. Despite the fact that the CL-84 was very successful in the\nexperimental and operational trials carried out between 1972 and 1974, no\nproduction contracts resulted.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Canadair_CL-84","recorded":1375087058,"links":[],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Canadair aircraft|CL-084","Canadian experimental aircraft 1960–1969","Tiltwing aircraft","Abandoned military aircraft projects of Canada","High-wing aircraft"],"headings":["Development","Design","Operational history","Aircraft on display","Specifications (CL-84-1)","See also","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["uss_guam","lph-9"],["uss_guadalcanal","lph-7"]],"members":["uss_guam","uss_guadalcanal"],"related":["Canada_Aviation_Museum","Canada","Canadair","Canadian_Forces","V/STOL","Tiltwing","Canadair","STOL","VTOL","General_Dynamics","Lycoming_T53","Washington_DC","Norfolk,_Virginia","Edwards_Air_Force_Base","USS_Guam_(LPH-9)","General_Electric","Royal_Air_Force","Flight_Lieutenant","F-4_Phantom","USS_Guadalcanal_(LPH-7)","Vietnam_War","De_Havilland_Canada_Beaver","De_Havilland_Canada_Otter","De_Havilland_Canada_DHC-4_Caribou","Germany","Netherlands","Italy","Scandinavia","United_Kingdom","Winnipeg","Canada_Aviation_Museum","Avro_Arrow","Western_Canada_Aviation_Museum","Lycoming_T53","Bell_XV-3","Bell_XV-15","Curtiss-Wright_X-19","Hiller_X-18","LTV_XC-142","Canadair_CL-41","Canadair_CL-44","Canadair_CL-66","Canadair_CL-89","Canadair_CF-104","Canadair_CL-215","List_of_VTOL_aircraft","List_of_experimental_aircraft","Larry_Milberry"]}
