{"cursor":"5169","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n, Germany.]] , Germany.]] 'Brine' is a solution of salt (usually sodium\nchloride) in water. In different contexts, brine may refer to salt solutions\nranging from about 3.5% (a typical concentration of seawater, or the lower end\nof solutions used for brining foods) up to about 26% (a typical saturated\nsolution, depending on temperature).\n\nBrine is used to preserve vegetables, fruit, fish and meat in a process known as\nbrining. Brine is also commonly used to age halloumi and feta cheeses, or for\npickling foodstuffs, as a means of preserving them (or increasing taste). Brine\nis a common fluid used in large refrigeration installations for the transport of\nthermal energy from place to place. It is used because the addition of salt to\nwater lowers the freezing temperature of the solution and the heat transport\nefficiency can be greatly enhanced for the comparatively low cost of the\nmaterial. The lowest freezing point obtainable for NaCl brine is\n−21.1 Â°C (−6.0 Â°F) at 23.3wt% NaCl. [http://webserver-\n.dmt.upm.es/~isidoro/bk3/c07sol/Solution%20properties.htm\nwebserver.dmt.upm.es] This is called the eutectic point. In colder\ntemperatures, brine can be used to de-ice or reduce freezing temperatures on\nroads. [http://www.usroads.com/journals/rmj/9702/rm970202.htm Iowa\nDepartment of Transportation]\n\nBrine also refers to naturally occurring salt water. The brine outcropping at\nthe surface as saltwater springs are known as \"licks\" or \"salines\".\nThe contents of dissolved solids in groundwater vary highly from one location to\nanother on earth, both in terms of specific constituents (e.g. halite,\nanhydrite, carbonates, gypsum, fluoride-salts, and sulfate-salts) and regarding\nthe concentration level. Using one of several classification of groundwater\nbased on Total Dissolved Solids, brine is water containing more than\n100,000 mg/L TDS. Brine is commonly produced during well\ncompletion operations, particularly after the hydraulic fracturing of a well.\n\n*0 Â°F was initially set as the zero point in the Fahrenheit temperature scale,\nas it was the coldest temperature that Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit could reliably\nreproduce â by freezing\nbrine.

At\n0 Â°C (273.15 K, 32 Â°F), brine can only hold about 26% salt.
