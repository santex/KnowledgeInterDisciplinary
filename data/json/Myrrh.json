Rice, Patty C.,\nAmber: Golden Gem of the Ages, Author House, Bloomington, 2006 p.321 An\noleoresin is a natural blend of an essential oil and a resin. Myrrh resin is a\nnatural gum. Myrrh can also be ingested by drinking it with wine.\n\nWhen a tree wound penetrates through the bark and into the sapwood, the tree\nbleeds a resin. Myrrh gum, like frankincense, is such a resin. When people\nharvest myrrh, they wound the trees repeatedly to bleed them of the gum. Myrrh\ngum is waxy, and coagulates quickly. After the harvest, the gum becomes hard and\nglossy. The gum is yellowish, and may be either clear or opaque. It darkens\ndeeply as it ages, and white streaks emerge. Caspar Neumann, William Lewis,\nThe chemical works of Caspar Neumann, M.D.,2nd Ed., Vol 3, London, 1773\np.55\n\nMyrrh gum is commonly harvested from the species [[Commiphora myrrha]], which is\nnative to Yemen, Somalia, Eritrea and eastern Ethiopia. Another farmed species\nis C. momol. Newnes, G., ed., Chambers's encyclopÃ¦dia, Volume 9, 1959\nThe related [[Commiphora gileadensis]], native to Eastern Mediterranean and\nparticularly the Arabian Peninsula, Anthony G. Miller, Thomas A. Cope, J. A.\nNyberg Flora of the Arabian Peninsula and Socotra, Volume 1, Edinburgh\nUniversity Press, 1996, p.20 is the biblically referenced Balm of\nGilead, Gibson (2011), p. 160. also known\nas Balsam of Mecca. Several other species yield bdellium and Indian myrrh.\n\nThe oleo gum resins of a number of other Commiphora and [[Balsamodendron]]\nspecies are also used as perfumes, medicines (such as aromatic wound dressings),\nand incense ingredients. A lesser quality myrrh is bled from the tree\n[[Commiphora erythraea]]. [[Balsam of Mecca|Commiphora gileadensis]] (syn C.\nopobalsamum) oleo gum resin is known as Opopinax, a name it shares with the gum\nresin bled from a species of parsnip, Pastincea opobalsamum.\n\nFragrant \"myrrh beads\" are made from the crushed seeds of [[Detarium]]\nmicrocarpum, an unrelated West African tree. These beads are traditionally worn\nby married women in Mali as multiple strands around the hips.\n\nThe name \"myrrh\" is also applied to the potherb Myrrhis odorata, otherwise known\nas \"cicely\" or \"sweet cicely\".\n","linknr":337,"url":"Myrrh","recorded":1362481514,"links":50,"instances":["wood"],"pdf":["http://www.swsbm.com/ManualsMM/HRBENRGT.pdf"],"categories":["Burseraceae","Essential oils","Incense material","Plants used in Ayurveda","Plants used in traditional Chinese medicine","Resins","Spices"],"headings":["Etymology","Attributed medicinal properties","Religious ritual","See also","Footnotes","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/86/Commiphora_myrrha_-_K%C3%B6hler%E2%80%93s_Medizinal-Pflanzen-019.jpg/220px-Commiphora_myrrha_-_K%C3%B6hler%E2%80%93s_Medizinal-Pflanzen-019.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/14/MyrrhEssentialOil.png/220px-MyrrhEssentialOil.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d5/Balsamodendron_ehrenbergianum00.jpg/220px-Balsamodendron_ehrenbergianum00.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/Commiphora-myrrha-resin-myrrh.jpg/220px-Commiphora-myrrha-resin-myrrh.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["sapwood","wood"]],"members":["sapwood"],"related":["Oleoresin","Essential_oil","Resin","Natural_gum","Wine","Sapwood_(wood)","Frankincense","Yemen","Somalia","Eritrea","Ethiopia","Eastern_Mediterranean","Arabian_Peninsula","Balsam_of_Mecca","Bdellium","Potherb","Cicely","Aramaic","English_language","Hebrew_Bible","Loanword","University_of_Haifa","Greek_myth","Myrrha","Septuagint","Greek_language","Perfume","Gold","Traditional_Chinese_medicine","Blood_stasis","Uterus","Rheumatism","Arthritis","Amenorrhea","Dysmenorrhea","Menopause","Uterus","Tumor","Decoction","Liniment","Incense","Rheumatoid_arthritis","Notoginseng","Safflower","Cinnamon","Ayurveda","Unani","Commiphora_wightii","Pharmacy","Analgesic","Blood_glucose","Aloe","Glucose","Diabetic","Analgesic","University_of_Florence","Egypt","Fascioliasis","Schistosomiasis","Cholesterol","Natron","Ketoret","Incense","Solomon's_Temple","Second_Temple","Hebrew_Bible","Talmud","Temple_in_Jerusalem","Nabataeans","Petra","Frankincense","Jesus","Biblical_Magi","New_Testament","Incense","Christian_liturgy","Thurible","Frankincense","Eastern_Orthodox","Oriental_Orthodox","Roman_Catholic","Anglican","Episcopal","Sacrament","Chrism","Eastern_Orthodox_Church","Sacrament","Holy_anointing_oil","Neo-paganism","Magick","Bdellium","Chrism","Frankincense","Naturalis_Historia","Pliny_the_Elder"]}
