{"cursor":"732","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'lateral canal' is a canal built along the same right-of-way as an existing\nstream. Water for the canal is usually provided by the original natural stream.\nMany French lateral canals have the word latÃ©ral as part of their name.\nExamples include Canal latÃ©ral Ã  l'Aisne, Canal latÃ©ral Ã  la Garonne, and Canal\nlatÃ©ral Ã  la Marne.\n\nThe normal aim of constructing such a canal was to provide a more consistent\ndepth of water for navigation particularly during dry summers and to make\nnavigation easier during periods of flood. Problems often remained where the\noriginal course of the river was still used.\n","linknr":73,"url":"Lateral_canal","recorded":1362579790,"links":10,"instances":["transportation"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Canals"],"headings":["See also"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["right-of-way","transportation"]],"members":[],"related":["Right-of-way_(transportation)","Canal_latéral_à_l'Aisne","Canal_latéral_à_la_Garonne","Canal_latéral_à_la_Marne","Canal","Summit_level_canal"]}
