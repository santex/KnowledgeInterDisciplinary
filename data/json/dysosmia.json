These subsets are called anosmia, parosmia, and\nphantosmia respectively. Anosmia and hyposmia (a less severe form of anosmia\nwith a decreased sensitivity to smell but not the complete lack of it) are more\nquantitative disabilities typified by degrees in which the odor is sensed.\nParosmia and phantosmia are more qualitative disabilities that are denoted by\nthe impromptu introduction of odors without the proper stimulus.<ref\nname=\"urlSmell and Taste Disorders: Ear, Nose, and Throat Disorders: Merck\nManual Home Health Handbook\"></ref><ref name=\"urlDorlands Medical\nDictionary:dysosmia\"></ref>\n",
