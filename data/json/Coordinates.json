{"cursor":"14902","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nIn geometry, a 'coordinate system' is a system which uses one or more numbers,\nor 'coordinates', to uniquely determine the position of a point or other\ngeometric element on a manifold such as Euclidean space. Woods p.\n1 The order of the coordinates is significant and they are\nsometimes identified by their position in an ordered tuple and sometimes by a\nletter, as in 'the x-coordinate'. The coordinates are taken to be real numbers\nin elementary mathematics, but may be complex numbers or elements of a more\nabstract system such as a commutative ring. The use of a coordinate system\nallows problems in geometry to be translated into problems about numbers and\nvice versa; this is the basis of analytic geometry.\n\n\n","linknr":323,"url":"Coordinates","recorded":1362675859,"links":85,"instances":["mathematics","geometry","geometry","geometry","topology","mathematics"],"pdf":["http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/CVonline/LOCAL_COPIES/AV0405/MARTIN/Hex.pdf"],"categories":["Coordinate systems|*","Analytic geometry"],"headings":["Number line","Cartesian coordinate system","Polar coordinate system","Cylindrical and spherical coordinate systems","Homogeneous coordinate system","Coordinates of other elements","Transformations between coordinate systems","{{anchor|Coordinate line}}{{anchor|Coordinate surface}}Coordinate curves and surfaces","Coordinate maps","Change of coordinates","Transformations","Systems commonly used","List of orthogonal coordinate systems","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/09/Number-line.gif","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/Cartesian-coordinate-system.svg/250px-Cartesian-coordinate-system.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/Rectangular_coordinates.svg/250px-Rectangular_coordinates.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ea/Spherical_coordinate_surfaces.gif/190px-Spherical_coordinate_surfaces.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["point","geometry"],["plane","geometry"],["atlas","topology"],["orientation","geometry"],["matrix","mathematics"],["barycentric_coordinates","mathematics"]],"members":["barycentric_coordinates","plane","point","orientation","atlas","matrix"],"related":["Geometry","Number","Point_(geometry)","Manifold","Euclidean_space","Tuple","Real_number","Complex_number","Commutative_ring","Analytic_geometry","Plane_(geometry)","Perpendicular","Euclidean_space","Projective_plane","Infinity","Plücker_coordinates","Curvilinear_coordinates","Spherical_coordinate_system","Homeomorphism","Atlas_(topology)","Differentiable_manifold","Geometry","Kinematics","Orientation_(geometry)","Rigid_bodies","Matrix_(mathematics)","Cartesian_coordinates","Unit_vectors","Coordinate_transformation","Bijection","Dimension","Cartesian_coordinate_system","Curvilinear_coordinates","Polar_coordinate_system","Log-polar_coordinates","Cylindrical_coordinate_system","Spherical_coordinate_system","Plücker_coordinates","Homogeneous_coordinates","Generalized_coordinates","Lagrangian","Canonical_coordinates","Hamiltonian_mechanics","Parallel_coordinates","N-dimensional_space","Barycentric_coordinates_(mathematics)","Ternary_plot","Intrinsic_equation","Curvature","Arc_length","Whewell_equation","Tangential_angle","Cesàro_equation","Orthogonal_coordinates","Coordinate_surfaces","Absolute_angular_momentum","Active_and_passive_transformation","Alpha-numeric_grid","Frame_of_reference","Galilean_transformation","Coordinate-free","Nomogram","Geographic_coordinate_system","Astronomical_coordinate_systems","Axes_conventions","Katsumi_Nomizu"]}
