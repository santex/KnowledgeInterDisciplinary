During and after World War II, similar restrictions were put in place\nin non-Soviet countries of the Eastern Bloc, which\nconsisted of the Communist states of Eastern Europe. Eastern bloc, The\nAmerican Heritage New Dictionary of Cultural Literacy, Third Edition. Houghton\nMifflin Company, 2005. Hirsch, Donald, Joseph F. Kett, James S.\nTrefil, ''The New Dictionary of Cultural Literacy',' Houghton Mifflin Harcourt,\n2002, ISBN 0-618-22647-8, page 230\n\nThough Albania was considered a minor member of the Eastern Bloc of Communist\nnations, there was one relatively important defector of a major intelligence\nofficer in 1949. Nesti Josifi Kopali was reputedly the press officer at the tiny\nAlbanian legation in Rome, but faced recall to Tirana due to his inauspicious\naccomplishments as chief of the Albanian security service (Sigurimi) in Italy,\nwhere there were a fairly large number of zealously anticommunist political\nexiles. Kopali offered himself to the U.S. Embassy in Rome in late 1949, but was\nrejected, so he turned to Italian intelligence. After a couple of months of\ninterrogation by the Italians, Kopali was turned over to the CIA, which flew him\nto the Washington area for debriefing. Kopali had, among his other anti-western\nassignments in 1946-47, tried and failed to set up a liaison with the editor of\nan ethnic newspaper in Boston. The Albanian's winter-spring 1950 provided some\nvaluable information about Albanian security/military matters to the Americans,\nbut not enough for the U.S. Government to offer him political asylum and\nresettlement in the United States. He was ultimately flown back to Germany,\nwhere he was put in a detention camp and caused U.S. Army Counterintelligence\nCorps officials fits with his efforts to refashion some kind of future, even a\nreturn to Albania. His ultimate fate has never been divulged by U.S. government\nofficials, though one person said Kopali may have ended up in a mental hospital\nin Greece. G.S. Trice, Specialist/4, Dossier Number H8047134, U.S. Army\nInvestigative Records Repository, 7 March 1974: contains such CIC records of\nNesti Josifi Kopali as IDENTIFICATION F-2542 (11 Jan 1952), D-296877 (1 Nov\n1951), File II-5092 (14 June 1951 - 18 Sept 1951). While these documents are the\nonly known paperwork available to the public, various government officials\nactive during the early 1950s acknowledged knowing about Kopali and some of his\nzany behavior.\n\nUp until 1952, however, the lines between East Germany and the western occupied\nzones could be easily crossed in most places.\nAccordingly, before 1961, most of that east-west flow took place between East\nand West Germany, with over 3.5 million East Germans emigrating to West Germany\nbefore 1961. Senate Chancellery, Governing Mayor\nof Berlin, [http://www.berlin.de/mauer/geschichte/index.en.html The construction\nof the Berlin Wall] states \"Between 1945 and 1961, around 3.6 million people\nleft the Soviet zone and East Berlin\" On August 13, 1961, a barbed-wire\nbarrier, which would become the Berlin Wall separating East and West Berlin, was\nerected by East Germany.\n\nAlthough international movement was, for the most part, strictly controlled,\nthere was a steady loss through escapees who were able to use ingenious methods\nto evade frontier security. Numerous notable Eastern\nBloc citizens defected to non-Eastern Bloc countries.\nAmong the notable defectors from East Germany, the Soviet Union, Poland,\nBulgaria, Romania, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Albania before those countries'\nconversions from Communist states in the early 1990s were the following 'List of\nEastern Bloc defectors'.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: left\"\n|+ 'Pre-1944 [[defection|Defect]]ions violating emigration restrictions\n|of [[Eastern Bloc]] countries'\n!style=\"text-align: left;background:#B0C4DE\"|Defector\n!style=\"background:#B0C4DE\"|Profession/Prominence\n!style=\"background:#B0C4DE\"|Birthplace !style=\"background:#B0C4DE\"|Defection\n!style=\"background:#B0C4DE\"|Notes\n|-\n|align=left|Victor Soultanbeieff || chess || Ukraine || 1921 || Escaped\nto Belgium\n|-\n|align=left|George Balanchine || choreographer || Russia || 1924 || Defected\nduring tour of Germany to Weimar Republic\n|-\n|align=left|Boris Bazhanov || Politburo Secretary || Russia || 1928 || Defected\nto France via Iran and India\n|-\n|align=left|Georges Agabekov || OGPU || Armenia || 1930 || Defected in France;\nled the manhunt for Bazhanov before defecting\n|-\n|align=left|Grigol Robakidze || author || Georgia || 1930 || Defected to\nGermany; primarily known for his exotic prose and anti-Soviet Ã©migrÃ© activities.\n|-\n|align=left|George Gamow || physicist || Ukraine || 1933 || first tried to kayak\nacross the Black Sea; defected in Brussels, Belgium; later discovered alpha\ndecay via quantum tunneling\n|-\n|align=left|Ignace Reiss || NKVD || Russia || 1937 || Former head of Soviet\nintelligence services; assassinated by NKVD\n|-\n|align=left|Walter Krivitsky || NKVD || Poland || 1937 || Defected in Paris,\nFrance after assassination of Reiss; Apparent 1941 suicide in the U.S. may have\nbeen an NKVD assassination\n|-\n|align=left|Genrikh Lyushkov || NKVD || Russia || 1938 || Crossed the border\ninto Manchukuo with secret documents; family arrested and sent to Gulag;\nseveral died\n|-\n|align=left|Alexander Orlov || NKVD || Belarus || 1938 || Fled while stationed\nin Spain to avoid execution in the Great Purge\n|-\n|align=left|Abdurakhman Avtorkhanov || author || Russia || 1942 || Sent to\ninfiltrate anti-Soviet Chechens, he joined them instead\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: left\"\n|+ 'Notable 1944â1991 [[Defection]]s from the [[Eastern Bloc]]'\n!style=\"text-align: left;background:#B0C4DE\"|Defector\n!style=\"background:#B0C4DE\"|Profession/Prominence\n!style=\"background:#B0C4DE\"|Birthplace !style=\"background:#B0C4DE\"|Defection\n!style=\"background:#B0C4DE\"|Notes\n|-\n|align=left|Svetlana Alliluyeva || Joseph Stalin's daughter || Russia || 1967 ||\nShe defected to the United States via New Delhi, India.
