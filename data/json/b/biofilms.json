{"cursor":"27657","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'' biofilm on an indwelling catheter]]\n\nA 'biofilm' is an aggregate of microorganisms in which cells adhere to each\nother on a surface. These adherent cells are frequently embedded within a self-\nproduced matrix of extracellular polymeric substance (EPS). Biofilm EPS, which\nis also referred to as 'slime' (although not everything described as slime is a\nbiofilm), is a polymeric conglomeration generally composed of extracellular DNA,\nproteins, and polysaccharides. Biofilms may form on living or non-living\nsurfaces and can be prevalent in natural, industrial and hospital\nsettings. The microbial cells growing\nin a biofilm are physiologically distinct from planktonic cells of the same\norganism, which, by contrast, are single-cells that may float or swim in a\nliquid medium.\n\nMicrobes form a biofilm in response to many factors, which may include cellular\nrecognition of specific or non-specific attachment sites on a surface,\nnutritional cues, or in some cases, by exposure of planktonic cells to sub-\ninhibitory concentrations of antibiotics. (primary source)\nWhen a cell switches to the biofilm mode of growth, it undergoes a phenotypic\nshift in behavior in which large suites of genes are differentially\nregulated.\n","linknr":507,"url":"biofilms","recorded":1362511335,"links":41,"instances":["disambiguation","material","water","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Microbiology terms","Bacteriology","Environmental soil science","Membrane biology","Biological matter","Environmental microbiology"],"headings":["Formation","Development","Dispersal","Properties","Examples","Biofilms and infectious diseases","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e4/Staphylococcus_aureus_biofilm_01.jpg/200px-Staphylococcus_aureus_biofilm_01.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/Biofilm.jpg/300px-Biofilm.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/Bacteria_mats_near_Grand_Prismatic_Spring_in_Yellowstone-750px.JPG/220px-Bacteria_mats_near_Grand_Prismatic_Spring_in_Yellowstone-750px.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/45/Thermophilic_bacteria.jpg/220px-Thermophilic_bacteria.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cell","biology"],["stagnant","water"],["pipe","material"],["gum_disease","disambiguation"]],"members":["gum_disease","pipe","stagnant","cell"],"related":["Catheter","Microorganism","Cell_(biology)","Extracellular_polymeric_substance","Gunge","Polymer","DNA","Protein","Polysaccharide","Physiology","Plankton","Phenotype","Gene_regulation","Van_der_Waals_force","Cell_adhesion","Pilus","Quorum_sensing","Dispersin_B","Deoxyribonuclease","Cis-2-decenoic_acid","Nitric_oxide","Aqueous","Solution","Bacteria","Archaea","Protozoa","Fungus","Algae","Metabolism","Polymer","Extracellular_polymeric_substance","Nutrient","Fossil","Stromatolites","Detergent","Antibiotic","Lateral_gene_transfer","Persister_cell","Oregon","River","Stagnant_(water)","Food_chains","Invertebrate","Hot_spring","Glacier","Shower","Pipe_(material)","Corrosion","Biofouling","Sewage_treatment","Biochemical_oxygen_demand","Protozoa","Rotifer","Slow_sand_filter","Petroleum","Microbial_biodegradation","Hydrocarbonoclastic_bacteria","Stromatolites","Cyanobacteria","Teeth","Dental_plaque","Tooth_decay","Gum_disease_(disambiguation)","Pierce's_Disease","Microbial_fuel_cells","Urinary_tract_infections","Urinary_catheterization","Otitis_media","Dental_plaque","Gingivitis","Contact_lenses","Endocarditis","Cystic_fibrosis","Prosthesis","Heart_valve_prosthesis","Sinusitis","Cilium","Goblet_cells","Dental_plaque","Teeth","Polymers","Metabolite","Disinfectants","Cooling_towers","Air_conditioners","Plumbing","Kombucha","Microbial_mat","Phototrophic_biofilms","Stromatolite","Chemistry_of_biofilm_prevention","Phage_therapy","Bacterial_nanowires"]}
