Without treatment, the bubonic plague\nkills about two thirds of infected humans within 4 days.\n\nThe term bubonic plague is derived from the Greek word , meaning \"groin.\"\nSwollen lymph nodes (buboes) especially occur in the armpit and groin in persons\nsuffering from bubonic plague. Bubonic plague was often used synonymously for\nplague, but it does in fact refer specifically to an infection that enters\nthrough the skin and travels through the lymphatics, as is often seen in flea-\nborne infections.\n\nBubonic plagueâalong with the septicemic plague and the pneumonic plague, which\nare the two other manifestations of [[Yersinia pestis|Y. pestis]]âis generally\nbelieved to be the cause of the Black Death that swept through Europe in the\n14th century and killed an estimated 25 million people, or 30â60% of the\nEuropean population. Because the plague killed so many of the working\npopulation, wages rose and some historians have seen this as a turning point in\nEuropean economic development.\n","linknr":673,"url":"Bubonic_plague","recorded":1362501549,"links":43,"instances":["digestion","disease","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Zoonotic bacterial diseases","Rodent-carried diseases","Rabbit diseases","Infectious diseases","History of medieval medicine","Plague (disease)"],"headings":["Signs and symptoms","Pathophysiology","Treatment","Laboratory testing","History","Biological warfare","See also","Footnotes","References","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/Plague_-buboes.jpg/230px-Plague_-buboes.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0a/Acral_necrosis_due_to_bubonic_plague.jpg/220px-Acral_necrosis_due_to_bubonic_plague.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c1/Flea_infected_with_yersinia_pestis.jpg/220px-Flea_infected_with_yersinia_pestis.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Bubonic_plague_victims-mass_grave_in_Martigues%2C_France_1720-1721.jpg/300px-Bubonic_plague_victims-mass_grave_in_Martigues%2C_France_1720-1721.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c8/A_Sydney_butchers%2C_1900_%283100789785%29.jpg/220px-A_Sydney_butchers%2C_1900_%283100789785%29.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/75/Directions_for_searchers%2C_Pune_plague_of_1897.jpg/170px-Directions_for_searchers%2C_Pune_plague_of_1897.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["host","biology"],["regurgitation","digestion"],["plague","disease"]],"members":["regurgitation","plague","host"],"related":["Lymph_glands","Zoonotic_disease","Flea","Enterobacteriaceae","Lymph_node","Lymphatics","Flea","Septicemic_plague","Pneumonic_plague","Black_Death","Black_Death_migration","Ecchymosis","Textbook_of_Military_Medicine","Lymphadenitis","Buboes","Lymph_node","Gangrene","Chills","Malaise","Seizures","Hematemesis","Coma","Pneumonic_plague","Bacteria","Biofilm","Host_(biology)","Regurgitation_(digestion)","Infection","Lymphatic_system","Septicemic_plague","Lymph_node","Bacilli","Phagocytes","Haemorrhage","Necrosis","Septicemic_plague","Pneumonic_plague","Antibiotics","Aminoglycoside","Streptomycin","Gentamicin","Tetracyclines","Doxycycline","Fluoroquinolone","Ciprofloxacin","Medical_diagnosis","Microbiological_culture","Blood_serum","Infection","Antigen","Dipstick","Byzantine_Empire","Plague_of_Justinian","Justinian_I","Procopius","Late_Middle_Ages","Silk_Road","Mongol","Caffa","Crimea","Siege","Pistoia","Great_Plague_of_Seville","Great_Plague_of_London","Great_Plague_of_Vienna","Great_Plague_of_Riga","Great_Plague_of_Marseilles","Third_plague_pandemic","Central_Asia","Poona","Pune","India","John_Ashburton_Thompson","Frank_Tidswell","1994_plague_in_India","Oregon","Colorado","Sichuan_province","Garzê_Tibetan_Autonomous_Prefecture","Marmot","Second_Sino-Japanese_War","Bacteriological_warfare","Imperial_Japanese_Army","Shirō_Ishii","Unit_731","Imperial_Japanese_Army_Air_Service","Ningbo","Tsuneyoshi_Takeda","Prince_Mikasa","Shirō_Ishii","Khabarovsk_War_Crime_Trials","Unit_731","Plague_(disease)","Changde","List_of_cutaneous_conditions","List_of_epidemics","Miasma_theory","Plague_doctor","Plague_doctor_costume"]}
