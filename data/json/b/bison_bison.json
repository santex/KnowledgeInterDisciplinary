Their historical range roughly\ncomprised a triangle between the Great Bear Lake in Canada's far northwest,\nsouth to the Mexican states of Durango and Nuevo León, and east to the Atlantic\nSeaboard of the United States (nearly to the Atlantic tidewater in some areas)\nfrom New York to Georgia and per some sources down to Florida.<ref></ref><ref>\nRetrieved on February 24, 2013.</ref>\n\nTwo subspecies or ecotypes have been described: the plains bison (Bison bison\nbison), smaller in size and with a more rounded hump, and the wood bison (Bison\nbison athabascae)—the larger of the two and having a taller, square\nhump.<ref></ref><ref></ref><ref name=RFLP></ref><ref name=Texas></ref><ref\nname=\"PMID10382295\"></ref><ref></ref> Furthermore, it has been suggested that\nthe plains bison consists of a northern (Bison bison montanae) and a southern\nsubspecies, bringing the total to three.<ref name=Texas/> However, this is\ngenerally not supported. The wood bison is one of the largest wild species of\nbovid in the world, surpassed by only the Asian gaur and wild Asian water\nbuffalo. It is the largest extant land animal in North America.\n",
