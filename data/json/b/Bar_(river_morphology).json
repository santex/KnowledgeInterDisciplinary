{"cursor":"2094","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":", Washington, USA.]]\n\nA 'bar' in a river is an elevated region of sediment (such as sand or gravel)\nthat has been deposited by the flow. Types of bars include mid-channel bars\n(also called braid bars, and common in braided rivers), point bars (common in\nmeandering rivers), and mouth bars (common in river deltas). Bars are typically\nfound in the slowest moving, shallowest parts of rivers and streams,\nand are often parallel to the shore and occupy the area farthest from the\nthalweg.\n\nThe locations of bars are determined by the geometry of the river and the flow\nthrough it. Point bars form on the inside of meander bends in meandering river\nbecause the shallow flow and low shear stresses there reduce the amount of\nmaterial that can be carried there. The excess material falls out of transport\nand forms the bar.\n","linknr":184,"url":"Bar_(river_morphology)","recorded":1362565060,"links":21,"instances":["geology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Fluvial landforms","Sedimentology","Geomorphology","Hydrology","River islands","Water streams"],"headings":["See also","References","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a9/American_River_16792.JPG/220px-American_River_16792.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/44/Alluvions.png/40px-Alluvions.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/82/Armillary_sphere.png/30px-Armillary_sphere.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/38px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["washington","u.s._state"],["deposition","geology"]],"members":["deposition","washington"],"related":["Washington_(U.S._state)","USA","River","Sediment","Sand","Gravel","Deposition_(geology)","Mid-channel_bar","Braid_bar","Braided_river","Point_bar","Meander","Mouth_bar","River_delta","Streams","Thalweg","River_island"]}
