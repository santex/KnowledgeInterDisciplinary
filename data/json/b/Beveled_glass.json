{"cursor":"3571","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Beveled glass' is usually made by taking thick glass and creating an angled\nsurface cut (bevel) around the entire periphery. Bevels act as prisms in the\nsunlight creating an interesting color diffraction which both highlights the\nglass work and provides a spectrum of colors which would ordinarily be absent in\nclear float glass.\n\n\"Beveled glass\" can be obtained as clusters which are arranged to create a\nspecific design. These can vary from simple three or four piece designs, often\nused in top lights (commonly known as transoms) of windows and conservatories,\nto more complex combinations of many pieces, suitable for larger panels such as\ndoors and side screens (known in the door industry as sidelites).\n\nBeveled glass has also been used with clear and colored textured glass to create\ndesigns. Textured glass is typically 1/8\" thick and has a distinct visible\ntexture. Beveled glass is typical made from 1/4\" float plate glass but\nthicknesses up to 1/2\" have been used for larger windows. The width of the bevel\nalso can vary depending on the desired effect. The combination of beveled glass\nis juxtaposed to the textured glass creating dramatic visual effects.\n\nModern beveled glass is machine made. The automation of this traditionally hand\nmade craft was facilitated by the development of plastic based metal deburring\nwheels which provided adequate smoothing of the ground glass face without the\ndifficulties involved with traditional aluminum oxide and natural sandstone\nsmoothing stones. The best natural smoothing stones came from a quarry in\nNewcastle, England and would be round wheels with a central hole several feet in\ndiameter and 8\" thick. The stone's quality was dictated by the consistency of\nthe sandstone, as any imperfection would scratch the glass being smoothed. These\nlarge stones would smooth the rough scratches created by the grinding process.\nThe type of grinding and smoothing equipment depended upon whether one was\ncreating straight line, outside or inside curved bevels. Outside curves and\nstraight lines are ground on a flat rotating platter covered in a thin slurry of\nsilicon carbide and water. Inside curves were ground on a silicon carbide\ngrinding wheel of appropriate grit with water running on the wheel. Smoothing\nthe ground face was done using the Newcastle stone for outside curves and\nstraight line bevels and a cone shaped polishing wheel of relatively fine grit\naluminum oxide. Despite the advantages of the plastic smoothing wheels, the\ncrispness of the bevel edge is superior on the stone smoothed traditionally\nbeveled pieces and can distinguish hand made beveled glass. The final step was\npolishing the beveled face using a felt covered wheel with a slurry of water and\noptical polishing powder. It was not uncommon to have pieces with a combination\nof outside and inside curve as well as straight line bevels. The objective was\nto have an even bevel width, even edge thickness with no facets in the bevel\nface and a crisp bevel edge. In the early 1900s in USA it was not uncommon to\nsee beveled oval door glass 5' in length with 2\" wide bevels on 3/8\" thick plate\nglass. Creating such bevels required two craftsmen working as a team.\n","linknr":87,"url":"Beveled_glass","recorded":1372154147,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Beveled_glass&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Beveled_glass&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Beveled_glass&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/Colors","/w/index.php?title=Beveled_glass&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Architectural_glass","/wiki/Came_glasswork","/wiki/Cathedral_glass","/wiki/Drapery_glass","/wiki/Fracture_glass","/wiki/Fracture-streamer_glass","/wiki/Ring_mottle_glass","/wiki/Rippled_glass","/wiki/Stained_glass","/wiki/Streamer_glass","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Beveled_glass&oldid=553635829","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Glass_types","/wiki/Category:Articles_lacking_sources_from_September_2009","/wiki/Category:All_articles_lacking_sources","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Beveled+glass&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Beveled+glass","/wiki/Beveled_glass","/wiki/Talk:Beveled_glass","#","/wiki/Beveled_glass","/w/index.php?title=Beveled_glass&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Beveled_glass&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf7/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Beveled_glass","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Beveled_glass","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Beveled_glass&oldid=553635829","/w/index.php?title=Beveled_glass&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Beveled_glass&id=553635829","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Beveled+glass","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Beveled+glass&oldid=553635829&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Beveled_glass&printable=yes","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4899357#sitelinks","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beveled_glass","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf7/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","/w/index.php?title=MediaWiki:Gadget-ReferenceTooltips.js&action=raw&ctype=text/javascript&508635914","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Glass types"],"headings":["See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf7/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf7/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Colors","Architectural_glass","Came_glasswork","Cathedral_glass","Drapery_glass","Fracture_glass","Fracture-streamer_glass","Ring_mottle_glass","Rippled_glass","Stained_glass","Streamer_glass"]}
