After the initial expansion, the\n| Universe cooled sufficiently to allow energy to be converted into various\n| subatomic particles, including protons, neutrons, and electrons. Though simple\n| atomic nuclei could have formed quickly, thousands of years were needed before\n| the appearance of the first electrically neutral atoms. The first element\n| produced was hydrogen, along with traces of helium and lithium. Giant clouds\n| of these primordial elements later coalesced through gravity to form stars and\n| galaxies, and the heavier elements were synthesized either within stars or\n| during supernovae.\n\nThe Big Bang is a well-tested scientific theory and is widely accepted within\nthe scientific community. It offers a comprehensive explanation for a broad\nrange of observed phenomena, including the abundance of light elements, the\ncosmic microwave background, large scale structure, and the Hubble diagram for\nType Ia supernovae. {{cite web |last=Wright |first=E.L. |date=9 May 2009\n|title=What is the evidence for the Big Bang?\n|url=http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/cosmology_faq.html#BBevidence\n|work=Frequently Asked Questions in Cosmology |publisher=UCLA, Division of\nAstronomy and Astrophysics |accessdate=16 October 2009 }} The core ideas\nof the Big Bangâthe expansion, the early hot state, the formation of helium, and\nthe formation of galaxiesâare derived from these and other observations that are\nindependent of any cosmological model. As the distance between galaxy clusters\nis increasing today, it is inferred that everything was closer together in the\npast. This idea has been considered in detail back in time to extreme densities\nand temperatures, {{cite web |last=Gibson |first=C.H. |date=21 January 2001\n|url=http://sdcc3.ucsd.edu/~ir118/GibsonAbstract.pdf |title=The First Turbulent\nMixing and Combustion |work=IUTAM Turbulent Mixing and Combustion }}\n{{cite arxiv |last=Gibson |first=C.H. |year=2001 |title=Turbulence And Mixing In\nThe Early Universe |class=astro-ph |eprint=astro-ph/0110012 }} {{cite\narxiv |last=Gibson |first=C.H. |year=2005 |title=The First Turbulent Combustion\n|class=astro-ph |eprint=astro-ph/0501416 }} and large particle\naccelerators have been built to experiment in such conditions, resulting in\nfurther development of the model. On the other hand, these accelerators have\nlimited capabilities to probe into such high energy regimes. There is little\nevidence regarding the absolute earliest instant of the expansion. Thus, the Big\nBang theory cannot and does not provide any explanation for such an initial\ncondition; rather, it describes and explains the general evolution of the\nuniverse going forward from that point on.\n\nGeorges LemaÃ®tre first proposed what became the Big Bang theory in what he\ncalled his \"hypothesis of the primeval atom.\" Over time, scientists built on his\ninitial ideas to form the modern synthesis. The framework for the Big Bang model\nrelies on Albert Einstein's general relativity and on simplifying assumptions\nsuch as homogeneity and isotropy of space. The governing equations had been\nformulated by Alexander Friedmann. In 1929, Edwin Hubble discovered that the\ndistances to far away galaxies were generally proportional to their redshiftsâan\nidea originally suggested by LemaÃ®tre in 1927. Hubble's observation was taken to\nindicate that all very distant galaxies and clusters have an apparent velocity\ndirectly away from our vantage point: the farther away, the higher the apparent\nvelocity. {{cite journal |last=Hubble |first=E. |year=1929\n|title=A Relation Between Distance and Radial Velocity Among Extra-Galactic\nNebulae

|doi=10.1073/pnas.15.3.168\n|pmc=522427 |pmid=16577160 |ref=harv }}\n\nWhile the scientific community was once divided between supporters of the Big\nBang and those of the Steady State theory, most scientists became\nconvinced that some version of the Big Bang scenario best fit observations after\nthe discovery of the cosmic microwave background radiation in 1964, and\nespecially when its spectrum (i.e., the amount of radiation measured at each\nwavelength) was found to match that of thermal radiation from a black body.\nSince then, astrophysicists have incorporated a wide range of observational and\ntheoretical additions into the Big Bang model, and its parametrization as the\nLambda-CDM model serves as the framework for current investigations of\ntheoretical cosmology.\n","linknr":1483,"url":"Big_Bang","recorded":1362375522,"links":162,"instances":["mathematics","us_magazine","cosmology","physics","journal","spacecraft","physics"],"pdf":["http://sdcc3.ucsd.edu/~ir118/GibsonAbstract.pdf","http://sdcc3.ucsd.edu/~ir118/GibsonAbstract.pdf","http://lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov/product/map/dr4/pub_papers/sevenyear/basic_results/wmap_7yr_basic_results.pdf","http://lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov/product/map/dr4/pub_papers/sevenyear/basic_results/wmap_7yr_basic_results.pdf","http://pdg.lbl.gov/2006/reviews/darkmatrpp.pdf","http://pdg.lbl.gov/2006/reviews/darkmatrpp.pdf","http://www.awesomeanimator.com/bigbangstatevector.pdf","http://www.awesomeanimator.com/bigbangstatevector.pdf"],"categories":["Physical
