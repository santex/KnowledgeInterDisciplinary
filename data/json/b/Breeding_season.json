{"cursor":"6655","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Seasonal breeders' are animal species that successfully mate only during\ncertain times of the year. These times of year allow for the births at a time\noptimal for the survival of the young in terms of factors such as ambient\ntemperature, food and water availability, and even changes in the predation\nbehaviors of other species. Related sexual\ninterest and behaviors are expressed and accepted only during this period.\nFemale seasonal breeders will have one or more estrus cycles only when she is\n\"in season\" or fertile and receptive to mating. At other times of the year, they\nwill be anestrus. Unlike reproductive cyclicity, seasonality is described in\nboth males and females. Male seasonal breeders may exhibit changes in\ntestosterone levels, testes weight, and fertility depending on the time of year.\n\nSeasonal breeders are distinct from opportunistic breeders, which mate whenever\nthe conditions of their environment become favorable, and continuous breeders\nlike humans that mate year-round.\n","linknr":167,"url":"Breeding_season","recorded":1362686380,"links":9,"instances":["mammalian_reproduction"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Animal breeding","Reproduction in animals|*","Fertility"],"headings":["Breeding Season","Physiology","Factors that determine time of fertility","Partial list of seasonal breeders","See also","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["rut","mammalian_reproduction"]],"members":["rut"],"related":["Animal","Species","Animal_sexual_behaviour_","Estrus_cycle","Receptive_to_mating","Testosterone","Testes","Opportunistic_breeders","Continuous_breeders","Breeding_in_the_wild","Species","Extinct","Extinction","Passenger_pigeon","American_continent","Hypothalamus","GnRH","Pituitary","Gonadotropins","Luteinizing_hormone","Follicle-stimulating_hormone","Hormones","Reproduction_","Photoperiod","Melatonin","Pineal_gland","Melatonin","Melatonin","Luteinizing_hormone","Follicle-stimulating_hormone","Spermatogenesis_","Birds","Fish","Ring-tailed_lemur","Horse","Hamster","Groundhog","Mink","Sheep","Goat","Fox","Deer","Red_Deer","Elk","Moose","Ruffed_lemur","Species","Hamster","Vole","Mouse","Rut_(mammalian_reproduction)"]}
