Beck-Mannagetta, G. (1930) Orobanchaceae. In\nEngler, A. (ed.) Das Pflanzenreich 4: 1-348. (Engelmann:Leipzig). Some\nspecies formerly included in this genus are now referred to the genus\n[[Conopholis]]. The broomrape plant is small, from 10â60 cm tall depending\non species. It is best recognized by its yellow- to straw-coloured stems\ncompletely lacking chlorophyll, bearing yellow, white or blue, snapdragon-like\nflowers. The flower shoots are scaly, with a dense terminal spike of 10-20\nflowers in most species, though single in O. uniflora. The leaves are merely\ntriangular scales. The seeds are minute, tan-to-brown, and blacken with age.\nThese plants generally flower from late winter to late spring. When they are not\nflowering, no part of these plants is visible above the surface of the soil.\n\nAs they have no chlorophyll, they are totally dependent on other plants for\nnutrients. Broomrape seeds remain dormant in the soil, often for many years,\nuntil stimulated to germinate by certain compounds produced by living plant\nroots. Yoder, J.I. (2001) Host-plant recognition by parasitic\nScrophulariaceae. Current Opinion in Plant Biology 4:359-365. Broomrape\nseedlings put out a root-like growth, which attaches to the roots of nearby\nhosts. Once attached to a host, the broomrape robs its host of water and\nnutrients.\n\nSome species are only able to parasitise a single plant species, such as ivy\nbroomrape Orobanche hederae, which is restricted to parasitising ivy; these\nspecies are often named after the plant they parasitise. Others can infect\nseveral genera, such as the lesser broomrape [[Orobanche minor|O. minor]], on\n[[Clover|Trifolium]] and other related Fabaceae.\n\nBranched broomrape Orobanche ramosa, native to central and southwestern Europe\nbut widely naturalised elsewhere, is considered a major threat to crops in some\nareas. Plants that are parasitized are tomato, eggplant, potato, cabbage,\ncoleus, bell pepper, sunflower, celery, and beans. In heavily infested areas,\nbranched broomrape can cause total crop failure.\n\nThe stems of a species parasitic on the fava bean are gathered and eaten in the\nregion of Puglia, Italy, where they are given the name spocchia. Luard, E. European peasant cookery, Grub Street, 2004, p.380\n\nBranched broomrape was found near Bowhill, South Australia in 1992, and some\nproperties have been quarantined for more than a decade. The weed could become a\nnational problem in Australia unless it can be contained.\n","linknr":435,"url":"Broomrape","recorded":1362372983,"links":45,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.dwlbc.sa.gov.au/assets/files/bb_review.pdf"],"categories":["Orobanchaceae","Orobanche|","Parasitic plants"],"headings":["Etymology","Selected species","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/da/Blauwe_bremraap_20-06-2005_18.59.22.JPG/220px-Blauwe_bremraap_20-06-2005_18.59.22.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1e/Broomrape2.jpg/87px-Broomrape2.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/82/Orobanche_uniflora_3303f.JPG/80px-Orobanche_uniflora_3303f.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8c/Broomrape_%28Cistanche_tubulosa%29_Negev.jpg/80px-Broomrape_%28Cistanche_tubulosa%29_Negev.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3f/Ivy_Broomrape%2C_Orobanche_hederae%2C_by_the_Loire_at_Treves.JPG/80px-Ivy_Broomrape%2C_Orobanche_hederae%2C_by_the_Loire_at_Treves.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Plantae","Angiosperms","Eudicots","Asterids","Lamiales","Orobanchaceae","Species","Parasite","Herbaceous_plant","Orobanchaceae","Northern_Hemisphere","Chlorophyll","Snapdragon","Flower","Leaf","Ivy","Fabaceae","Branched_broomrape","Europe","Tomato","Eggplant","Potato","Cabbage","Coleus","Bell_pepper","Sunflower","Celery","Bean","Fava_bean","Puglia","Italy","Vetch","Strangle","Taxonomy","Synonymy"]}
