{"cursor":"2078","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\n\nIn European and West Asian typography and penmanship, the 'baseline' is the line\nupon which most letters \"sit\" and below which descenders extend.\n\nIn the example to the right, the letter 'p' has a descender; the other letters\nsit on the (red) baseline.\n\nMost, though not all, typefaces are similar in the following ways as regards\nthe baseline:\n\n*capital letters sit on the baseline. The most common exceptions are the J and\nQ. *Lining figures (see Arabic numerals) sit on the baseline. *The following\ntext figures have descenders: 3 4 5 7 9. *The following lowercase letters have\ndescenders: g j p q y. *Glyphs with rounded lower and upper extents (0 3 6 8 c C\nG J o O Q) dip very slightly below the baseline (\"overshoot\") to create the\noptical illusion that they sit on the baseline, and rise above the x-height or\ncapital height to create the illusion that they have the same height as flat\nglyphs (such as those for H x X 1 5 7). Peter Karow's Digital Typefaces suggests\nthat typical overshoot is about 1.5%.\n\nThe vertical distance of the base lines of consecutive lines in a paragraph is\nalso known as line height or leading, although the latter can also refer to the\nbaseline distance minus the font size.\n\nNorth Indian scripts have a characteristic hanging baseline; the letters are\naligned to the top of the writing line, marked by an overbar, with diacritics\nextending above the baseline.\n\nEast Asian scripts have no baseline; each glyph sits in a square box, with\nneither ascenders nor descenders. When mixed with scripts with a low baseline,\nEast Asian characters should be set so that the bottom of the character is\nbetween the baseline and the descender height.\n","linknr":211,"url":"Baseline_(typography)","recorded":1362583999,"links":28,"instances":["typography"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Typography","Penmanship"],"headings":["See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/39/Typography_Line_Terms.svg/410px-Typography_Line_Terms.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Crystal_Clear_app_fonts.svg/30px-Crystal_Clear_app_fonts.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["overshoot","typography"]],"members":["overshoot"],"related":["Typography","Penmanship","Descender","Typeface","Majuscule","Arabic_numerals","Text_figures","Lower_case","Glyphs","Leading","Overshoot_(typography)"]}
