{"cursor":"3051","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In chemistry, 'bond energy' (E) is the measure of '[[bond strength]]' in a\nchemical bond. It is the heat required to break one Mole (unit) of molecules\ninto their individual atoms. For example, the carbon-hydrogen bond energy in\nmethane E(CâH) is the enthalpy change involved with breaking up one molecule of\nmethane into a carbon atom and 4 hydrogen radicals divided by 4. Bond\nenergy (E) should not be confused with bond-dissociation energy. It is a roughly\ntransferable property, and enthalpy of formation can typically be roughly\napproximated by simply adding tabulated values for bond energies for all bonds\nin a molecule, with an error of sometimes just a few percent. However, to get a\nbetter approximation is much more difficult.  \n","linknr":123,"url":"Bond_energy","recorded":1362580475,"links":19,"instances":["chemistry","unit","chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Chemical bond properties|Energy","Chemical bonding"],"headings":["Bond energy/distance correlation","Factors affecting ionic bond energy","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["mole","unit"],["radical","chemistry"],["transferability","chemistry"]],"members":["transferability","mole","radical"],"related":["Chemistry","Chemical_bond","Mole_(unit)","Carbon","Hydrogen","Methane","Enthalpy","Radical_(chemistry)","Bond-dissociation_energy","Transferability_(chemistry)","Standard_enthalpy_of_formation","Bond_length","Metallic_radius","Ionic_radius","Covalent_radius","Boron","Picometer","Rhenium","Quadruple_bond","Electronegativity","Binding_energy","Electron_binding_energy","Lattice_energy"]}
