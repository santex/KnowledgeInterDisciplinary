Although often conflated, biodegradable is distinct in meaning\nfrom compostable. While biodegradable simply means to be consumed by\nmicroorganisms and return to compounds found in nature, \"compostable\" makes the\nspecific demand that the object break down in a compost pile. The term is often\nused in relation to ecology, waste management, biomedicine, and the natural\nenvironment (bioremediation) and is now commonly associated with environmentally\nfriendly products that are capable of decomposing back into natural elements.\nOrganic material can be degraded aerobically with oxygen, or anaerobically,\nwithout oxygen. Biosurfactant, an extracellular surfactant secreted by\nmicroorganisms, enhances the biodegradation process.\n\nBiodegradable matter is generally organic material such as plant and animal\nmatter and other substances originating from living organisms, or artificial\nmaterials that are similar enough to plant and animal matter to be put to use by\nmicroorganisms. Some microorganisms have a naturally occurring, microbial\ncatabolic diversity to degrade, transform or accumulate a huge range of\ncompounds including hydrocarbons (e.g. oil), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs),\npolyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), pharmaceutical substances, radionuclides and\nmetals. Major methodological breakthroughs in microbial biodegradation have\nenabled detailed genomic, metagenomic, proteomic, bioinformatic and other high-\nthroughput analyses of environmentally relevant microorganisms providing\nunprecedented insights into key biodegradative pathways and the ability of\nmicroorganisms to adapt to changing environmental conditions. Products that contain biodegradable matter and non-\nbiodegradable matter are often marketed as biodegradable.\n\nMonona Rossol wrote that \"biodegradable substances break down into more than one\nset of chemicals, which are usually called primary and secondary degradation\nproducts. Any of these may be toxic.\"\n","linknr":216,"url":"biodegradable","recorded":1362900980,"links":42,"instances":["journal"],"pdf":["http://www.kyu.edu.tw/93/epaperv6/93-129.pdf","http://wmr.sagepub.com/content/23/2/95.full.pdf","http://web.mit.edu/course/10/10.569/www/ikadaPEreview.pdf","http://web.mit.edu/course/10/10.569/www/ikadaPEreview.pdf"],"categories":["Anaerobic digestion","Biodegradable waste management","Biodegradation|"],"headings":["Metrology","Plastics","Biodegradable technology","Etymology of \"biodegradable\"","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f1/Slime.mold.jpg/250px-Slime.mold.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/Sustainable_development.svg/32px-Sustainable_development.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Earth_flag_PD.jpg/32px-Earth_flag_PD.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/Aegopodium_podagraria1_ies.jpg/32px-Aegopodium_podagraria1_ies.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["biodegradation","journal"]],"members":["biodegradation"],"related":["Biodegradable","Compostable","Bioremediation","Aerobic_organism","Oxygen","Anaerobic_digestion","Biosurfactant","Organic_material","Microorganisms","Hydrocarbon","Polychlorinated_biphenyls","Polyaromatic_hydrocarbons","Radionuclide","Microbial_biodegradation","Microorganism","Polycaprolactone","Polyesters","Poly-3-hydroxybutyrate","Polylactic_acid","Polycaprolactone","Anaerobic_decomposition","Methane","Compost_heap","Compostable","Compostable","Compostable","Biodegradable","Bacteria","Polymers","Plant_genetics","Climate_change","Photosynthesis","Toxins","Biodegradable_plastics","Carbon","Hydrogen","Oxygen","Decomposing","Bio-medical","Carbon_dioxide","Microorganisms","Anaerobic_digestion","Biodegradability_prediction","Biodegradable_electronics","Biodegradable_polythene_film","Biodegradation_(journal)","Bioplastic","Bioremediation","Decomposition","Landfill_gas_monitoring","List_of_environment_topics","Microbial_biodegradation"]}
