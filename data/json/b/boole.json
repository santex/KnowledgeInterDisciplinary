He worked in the fields of differential\nequations and algebraic logic, and is now best known as the author of [[The Laws\nof Thought]]. As the inventor of the prototype of what is now called Boolean\nlogic, which became the basis of the modern digital computer, Boole is regarded\nin hindsight as a founder of the field of computer science. Boole said,\n<blockquote>... no general method for the solution of questions in the theory of\nprobabilities can be established which does not explicitly recognise ... those\nuniversal laws of thought which are the basis of all reasoning\n...<ref></ref></blockquote>\n","title":"George%20Boole","headings":["Early life","Professor at Cork","Death","Works","Legacy","Views","Family","References","Notes","External links"]},"micro-relation":["4: Augustus_De_Morgan","3: Lincoln,_Lincolnshire","3: Claude_Shannon","3: Royal_Society","2: Ballintemple","2: County_Cork","2: Computer_science","2: Unitarianism","2: William_Stanley_Jevons","2: John_Maynard_Keynes","2: Charles_Sanders_Peirce","2: William_Ernest_Johnson","2: Victor_Shestakov","2: Digital_computer","2: Isaac_Todhunter","2: Andrei_Nikolaevich_Kolmogorov","2: Adolf_Pavlovich_Yushkevich","2: Ivor_Grattan-Guinness","2: Mary_Everest_Boole","1: 19th-century_philosophy","1: Logic","1: Philosophy_of_mathematics","1: Aristotle","1: Baruch_Spinoza","1: Isaac_Newton","1: Bertrand_Russell","1: Logician","1: Differential_equation","1: Algebraic_logic","1: Boolean_logic","1: Doncaster","1: Rush_Rhees","1: Liverpool","1: Mechanics_Institute","1: Edward_Bromhead","1: Sylvestre_François_Lacroix","1: Waddington,_Lincolnshire","1: Early_closing","1: E._R._Larken","1: Building_society","1: Queen's_College,_Cork","1: Fellow_of_the_Royal_Society","1: Honorary_degrees","1: LL.D.","1: University_of_Dublin","1: Oxford_University","1: Pleural_effusion","1: Blackrock,_Cork","1: Cork_City","1: Duncan_Farquharson_Gregory","1: Royal_Society_of_Edinburgh","1: Royal_Irish_Academy","1: Invariant_theory","1: Linear_differential_equation","1: Commutative_law","1: Jeremy_Gray","1: Karen_Hunger_Parshall","1: British_Museum","1: Rational_function","1: Hilbert_transform","1: Quantification#Logic","1: Sir_William_Hamilton,_9th_Baronet","1: De_Morgan_duality","1: Logical_inference","1: Natural_language","1: Algebraic_structure","1: Abstract_algebra","1: Algebra_of_sets","1: Partial_operation","1: Set_theory","1: Disjoint_union","1: Exclusive_or","1: Symmetric_difference","1: Disjunction","1: Boolean_ring","1: Boolean_algebra","1: Boolean_datatype","1: University_College_Cork","1: Logic_of_relations","1: Gérard_Bornet","1: Platon_Sergeevich_Poretskii","1: Propositional_calculus","1: Hugh_MacColl","1: Ernst_Schröder","1: Louis_Couturat","1: Clarence_Irving_Lewis","1: Hasse_diagram","1: University_of_Michigan","1: Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology","1: Relays","1: Yanovskaya","1: Dobrushin","1: Digital_circuit","1: Digital_Age","1: Charles_Anderson-Pelham,_2nd_Baron_Yarborough","1: Branston_Hall","1: Judaism","1: Indian_logic","1: Monism","1: Benedict_Spinoza","1: Samuel_Clarke","1: Leslie_Ellis","1: Charles_Babbage","1: George_Everest","1: Charles_Howard_Hinton","1: Jungle_gym","1: William_H._Hinton","1: Joan_Hinton","1: Manhattan_Project","1: Sid_Engst","1: Edward_Ingram_Taylor","1: Geoffrey_Ingram_Taylor","1: Alicia_Boole_Stott","1: Lucy_Everest_Boole","1: Ethel_Lilian_Voynich","1: Wilfrid_Michael_Voynich","1: Francis_Hill","1: Des_MacHale","1: Stephen_Hawking","1: Internet_Archive"]}
