Located at the border between the Bruntsfield and\nTollcross areas of the city at the junction of Barclay Place and Wright's\nHouses, it was built by Frederick Thomas Pilkington (1832-98) – starting\nin 1862 and completed in 1864 – from a bequest left by Mary Barclay for\nthe building of a church for the Free Church of Scotland. The first minister of\nthe congregation was Rev. James Hood Wilson, DD, the first service of public\nworship being held on December 23, 1864.\n\nThe church remained part of the Free Church of Scotland until 1900 when the\nmajority of the Free Church and the United Presbyterian Church of Scotland\nunited to form the United Free Church of Scotland, and subsequently joined the\nChurch of Scotland in 1929 when the majority of the United Free Church joined\nthe Church of Scotland.\n\nBarclay Church united with Bruntsfield Church (Leamington Terrace) in 1965. The\nBruntsfield Church building is now used by an independent church and is known as\nBruntsfield Evangelical Church. The church was renamed as \"Barclay-Bruntsfield\nChurch\" until 1980 when it reverted back to its original name after united with\nChalmers-Lauriston Church (59-61 Lauriston Place). Chalmers-Lauriston Church was\npurchased by the City of Edinburgh Council and sold to the Arab Social League\nfor use as a cultural centre, but has remained derelict. Barclay united with\nViewforth Church in 2009. Other churches which have been subsumed into the\nparish of Barclay Viewforth through earlier unions include West Port Church. It\nis currently in a Parish Grouping with St Catherine's-Argyle Parish Church in\nMarchmont.\n\nThe Church, along with the Halls and Church Officer's House at the rear, are\ncategory A listed by Historic Scotland. The spire, which at high is a landmark\nin the city skyline, is one of the tallest church spires in Edinburgh.\nInternally, the church has seating on the ground floor with two tiers of\ngalleries in the heart shaped auditorium, which originally had seating for\n1,200. The organ was installed in the late nineteenth century. The marble pulpit\nretains its prominent location under the organ pipes with a central view over\nthe auditorium.\n","linknr":116,"url":"Barclay_Viewforth_Church","recorded":1375066455,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Barclay_Viewforth_Church&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Barclay_Viewforth_Church&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Barclay_Viewforth_Church&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/File:Barclaychurch.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/ec/Barclaychurch.jpg/250px-Barclaychurch.jpg","//tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Barclay_Viewforth_Church&params=55_56_26_N_3_12_12_W_","/wiki/Christian_denomination","/wiki/Church_of_Scotland","http://www.barclayviewforth.org.uk/","/wiki/Parish","/wiki/Presbyterian_polity","/wiki/Minister_(Christianity)","/wiki/Church_of_Scotland","/wiki/Presbyterian_polity","/wiki/Edinburgh","/wiki/Bruntsfield","/wiki/Tollcross,_Edinburgh","/wiki/Frederick_Thomas_Pilkington","/wiki/Mary_Barclay","/wiki/Free_Church_of_Scotland_(1843-1900)","/wiki/United_Presbyterian_Church_of_Scotland","/wiki/United_Free_Church_of_Scotland","/wiki/City_of_Edinburgh","/wiki/West_Port,_Edinburgh","/wiki/Marchmont","/wiki/Listed_building","/wiki/Historic_Scotland","/w/index.php?title=Barclay_Viewforth_Church&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/List_of_Church_of_Scotland_parishes","/w/index.php?title=Barclay_Viewforth_Church&action=edit&section=2","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Barclay_Church,_Edinburgh","http://www.barclayviewforth.org.uk/","http://www.edinburgh.gov.uk/Libraries/artsphere/architects/pilkington/barclaychurchbw.html","/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system","//tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Barclay_Viewforth_Church&params=55_56_25.71_N_3_12_12.51_W_","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Barclay_Viewforth_Church&oldid=532967411","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Church_of_Scotland_churches_in_Scotland","/wiki/Category:Churches_in_Edinburgh","/wiki/Category:Category_A_listed_buildings_in_Scotland","/wiki/Category:Listed_buildings_in_Edinburgh","/wiki/Category:Religious_buildings_completed_in_1864","/wiki/Category:1864_establishments_in_Scotland","/wiki/Category:Articles_lacking_sources_from_August_2011","/wiki/Category:All_articles_lacking_sources","/wiki/Category:Commons_category_with_local_link_same_as_on_Wikidata","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Barclay+Viewforth+Church&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Barclay+Viewforth+Church","/wiki/Barclay_Viewforth_Church","/wiki/Talk:Barclay_Viewforth_Church","#","/wiki/Barclay_Viewforth_Church","/w/index.php?title=Barclay_Viewforth_Church&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Barclay_Viewforth_Church&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Barclay_Viewforth_Church","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Barclay_Viewforth_Church","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Barclay_Viewforth_Church&oldid=532967411","/w/index.php?title=Barclay_Viewforth_Church&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4859957","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Barclay_Viewforth_Church&id=532967411","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Barclay+Viewforth+Church","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&a
