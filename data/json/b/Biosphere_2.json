Allen, inventor and Executive Director,\nand Margret Augustine, CEO. Constructed between 1987 and 1991, it was used to\nexplore the complex web of interactions within life systems in a structure that\nincluded five areas based on biomes and an agricultural area and human\nliving/working space to study the interactions between humans, farming and\ntechnology with the rest of nature. \"Using a closed ecological system to\nstudy Earth's biosphere: Initial results from Biosphere 2.\" Bioscience 43(4):\n225-236 It also explored the possible use of closed biospheres in space\ncolonization, and allowed the study and manipulation of a biosphere without\nharming Earth's. The name comes from Earth's biosphere, Biosphere 1.\nEarth's life system is the only biosphere currently known. Funding for the\nproject came primarily from the joint venture's financial partner, Ed Bass'\nDecisions Investment, and cost $200 million from 1985 to 2007, including land,\nsupport research greenhouses, test module and staff facilities.\n","linknr":570,"url":"Biosphere_2","recorded":1362505492,"links":43,"instances":["physiology","magazine"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Controlled Ecological Life Support Systems","Artificial ecosystems","Buildings and structures in Tucson, Arizona","Articles containing video clips","Santa Catalina Mountains","Human spaceflight analogs","Visitor attractions in Tucson, Arizona","Greenhouses","Ecological experiments"],"headings":["Biosphere 2","Engineering","Science","The ethnosphere: Psychology and conflict","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d3/Biosphere2_1.jpg/400px-Biosphere2_1.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/Wiki_bio2_sunset_001.jpg/220px-Wiki_bio2_sunset_001.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/Biosphere2_Inside_big.jpg/220px-Biosphere2_Inside_big.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a9/Tucson05_BiosphereFogDesert.jpg/220px-Tucson05_BiosphereFogDesert.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/63/Crew_Quarters_Biosphere_2.jpg/220px-Crew_Quarters_Biosphere_2.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9d/Flag_of_Arizona.svg/23px-Flag_of_Arizona.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["hypoxia","medical#symptoms"],["respiration","physiology"],["time","magazine"]],"members":["respiration","time","hypoxia"],"related":["University_of_Arizona","Lifelong_learning","Closed_ecological_system","Oracle,_Arizona","Arizona","United_States","John_P._Allen","Biome","Space_colonization","Earth","Biosphere","Ed_Bass","Greenhouse","Santa_Catalina_Mountains","Tucson","Biomes","Rainforest","Ocean","Coral_reef","Mangrove","Savannah","Fog_desert","Agricultural","Habitat","Passive_solar","Space_frame","Electrical_power","Columbia_University","Global_warming","Commuter_town","Tucson","University_of_Arizona","Vivarium","Roy_Walford","Jane_Poynter","Taber_MacCallum","Metabolism","Pygmy_goat","Silkie","Tilapia","Fog_desert","Chaparral","Pioneer_species","Etiolation","Reaction_wood","Corals","Protein_skimmer","Scrubber","Wetland","Vertebrata","Pollinators","Cockroach","Ant","Cecropia","Galagos","Oxygen","Sleep_apnea","Carbon_dioxide","Photosynthesis","Respiration_(physiology)","Microorganism","El_Niño-Southern_Oscillation","Wallace_Smith_Broecker","Lamont_Doherty_Earth_Observatory","Calcium_carbonate","United_States_Marshals_Service","Columbia_University","Associated_Press","University_of_Arizona","Ocean","Buckminster_Fuller","John_F._Kennedy","New_Age","Canadian_Broadcasting_Corporation","John_P._Allen","Synergia_Ranch","New_Mexico","Ghillean_Prance","Royal_Botanic_Gardens,_Kew","Kew","Biome","Antarctic","Confined_environment_psychology","Time_(magazine)","Public_relations","BIOS-3","Krasnoyarsk","Siberia","Soviet_Union","MARS-500","Mars","Eden_Project","John_P._Allen","Jane_Poynter","Taber_MacCallum","Roy_Walford","Integrated_biotectural_system"]}
