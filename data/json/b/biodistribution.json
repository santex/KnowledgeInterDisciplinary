{"cursor":"2975","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Biodistribution' is a method of tracking where compounds of interest travel in\nan experimental animal or human subject. For example, in the development of new\ncompounds for PET (positron emission tomography) scanning, a radioactive isotope\nis chemically joined with a peptide (subunit of a protein). This particular\nclass of isotopes emits positrons (which are antimatter particles, equal in mass\nto the electron, but with a positive charge). When ejected from the nucleus,\npositrons encounter an electron, and undergo annihilation which produces two\ngamma rays travelling in opposite directions. These gamma rays can be measured,\nand when compared to a standard, quantified.\n","linknr":107,"url":"biodistribution","recorded":1362507540,"links":13,"instances":["genetics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Applied genetics","Medical genetics","Medical research","Molecular biology"],"headings":["Biodistribution imaging after dissection","Non-invasive biodistribution imaging in gene therapy","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Blue_morpho_butterfly.jpg/30px-Blue_morpho_butterfly.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["transduction","genetics"]],"members":["transduction"],"related":["Positron_emission_tomography","Radioactive_isotope","Peptide","Protein","Positron","Antimatter","Annihilation","Gamma_rays","Medical_imaging","Gene_therapy","Transduction_(genetics)","MRI","SPECT","Positron_emission_tomography","Marker_gene","Optical_imaging","PCR","Avidin","Baculoviruses","Choroid_plexus"]}
