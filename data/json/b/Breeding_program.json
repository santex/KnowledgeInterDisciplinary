There are a couple of breeding methods, such as artificial (which\nis man made) and natural (it occurs on its own, which is very rare).\n\n\nBreeding programs are commonly employed in several fields where humans wish to\ncompletely obliterate the characteristics of their animals' offspring through\ncareful selection of breeding partners: *Dog and cat fanciers may coordinate a\nbreeding program to raise the probability of an animal's litter producing a\nchampionship-caliber animal. *Horse breeders try to produce fast racehorses\nthrough breeding programs. *Conservationists use breeding programs to try to\nhelp the recovery of endangered species by preserving the existing gene pool\nand preventing inbreeding. *There also can be breeding programs for plants.\nFor instance, a winery owner, seeking to find a better tasting wine, could\ndesign a breeding program so that only the vines whose grapes make the very\nbest wine are allowed to breed.\n","linknr":167,"url":"Breeding_program","recorded":1362686380,"links":17,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Plant reproduction","Livestock","Breeding"],"headings":["See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/Seal_sunbathing_in_Dingle.jpg/32px-Seal_sunbathing_in_Dingle.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Selective_breeding","Animal","Plant","Generation","Dog","Cat","Animal_fancy","Racehorse","Endangered_species","Gene_pool","Inbreeding","Animal_husbandry","Ex-situ_conservation","Selective_breeding","Captive_breeding"]}
