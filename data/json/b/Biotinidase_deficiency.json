This situation results in\nbiotin deficiency.\n\nBiotin, sometimes called vitamin B 7, is an important water-soluble\nnutrient that aids in the metabolism of fats, carbohydrates and proteins. Biotin\ndeficiency can result in behavioral disorders, lack of coordination, learning\ndisabilities and seizure. Biotin supplementation can alleviate and sometimes\ntotally arrest such symptoms.\n","linknr":249,"url":"Biotinidase_deficiency","recorded":1362503078,"links":16,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Autosomal recessive disorders","Vitamin, coenzyme, and cofactor metabolism disorders"],"headings":["Epidemiology","Symptoms","Dietary Concerns","Genetics","Diagnosis","Pathophysiology","Treatment","Disease Database","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/85/Biotin_structure.svg/230px-Biotin_structure.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/Autorecessive.svg/220px-Autorecessive.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/62/PD-icon.svg/12px-PD-icon.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Biotin","Autosomal_recessive","Metabolic_disorder","Biotin","Metabolism","Fat","Carbohydrate","Protein","Seizure","Hypotonia","Ataxia","Paresis","Hearing_loss","Optic_atrophy","Seborrheic_dermatitis","Psoriasis","Alopecia","Coma","Biotin","Leucine","Isoleucine","Biotin","Avidin","Mutation","Gene","Biotinidase","Enzyme","Amino_acids","Leucine","Isoleucine","Hydroxyisovalerate","Hydroxyisovaleric_acid","Autosomal_recessive","Autosome","Allele","Newborn_screening","Biotin","Biotin_deficiency","Multiple_carboxylase_deficiency","Holocarboxylase_synthetase_deficiency","3-Methylcrotonyl-CoA_carboxylase_deficiency"]}
