Beach houses are often designed to weather the type of climate they are\nbuilt in and the building materials and construction methods used in beach\nhousing vary widely around the world.<ref></ref>\n\nBeach houses are often associated with beach gardens with a special planting and\na particular type of leisure use. One of the most famous twentieth century beach\ngardens was constructed by Derek Jarman at Dungeness, England. It celebrated\nlocal materials, native plants and the openness of the site. Other beach gardens\nhave tried to create an isolated microclimate. Swimming pools are popular in\nbeach gardens. American architect Andrew Geller designed sculptural beach houses\nin the coastal regions of New England during the 1950s and 60s.<ref></ref>\n",
