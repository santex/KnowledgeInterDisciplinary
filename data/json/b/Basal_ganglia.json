They are\nsituated at the base of the forebrain and are strongly connected with the\ncerebral cortex, thalamus and other brain areas. The basal ganglia are\nassociated with a variety of functions, including voluntary motor control,\nprocedural learning relating to routine behaviors or \"habits\" such as bruxism,\neye movements, and cognitive, emotional functions. Currently popular theories implicate the basal ganglia\nprimarily in action selection, that is, the decision of which of several\npossible behaviors to execute at a given time.\nExperimental studies show that the basal ganglia exert an inhibitory influence\non a number of motor systems, and that a release of this inhibition permits a\nmotor system to become active. The \"behavior switching\" that takes place within\nthe basal ganglia is influenced by signals from many parts of the brain,\nincluding the prefrontal cortex, which plays a key role in executive\nfunctions.\n\nThe main components of the basal ganglia are the striatum (caudate nucleus and\nputamen), the globus pallidus, the substantia nigra, the nucleus accumbens, and\nthe subthalamic nucleus. The largest component, the\nstriatum, receives input from many brain areas but sends output only to other\ncomponents of the basal ganglia. The pallidum receives input from the striatum,\nand sends inhibitory output to a number of motor-related areas. The substantia\nnigra is the source of the striatal input of the neurotransmitter dopamine,\nwhich plays an important role in basal ganglia function. The subthalamic nucleus\nreceives input mainly from the striatum and cerebral cortex, and projects to the\nglobus pallidus. Each of these areas has a complex internal anatomical and\nneurochemical organization.\n\nThe basal ganglia play a central role in a number of neurological conditions,\nincluding several movement disorders. The most notable are Parkinson's disease,\nwhich involves degeneration of the dopamine-producing cells in the substantia\nnigra pars compacta, and Huntington's disease, which primarily involves damage\nto the striatum. Basal ganglia dysfunction is\nalso implicated in some other disorders of behavior control such as Tourette\nsyndrome, hemiballismus, obsessiveâcompulsive disorder, and Wilson's disease.\n\nThe basal ganglia have a limbic sector whose components are assigned distinct\nnames: the nucleus accumbens, ventral pallidum, and ventral tegmental area.\nThere is considerable evidence that this limbic part plays a central role in\nreward learning, particularly a pathway from the ventral tegmental area to the\nnucleus accumbens that uses the neurotransmitter dopamine. A number of highly\naddictive drugs, including cocaine, amphetamine, and nicotine, are thought to\nwork by increasing the efficacy of this dopamine signal. There is also evidence\nimplicating overactivity of the VTA dopaminergic projection in\nschizophrenia.\n","linknr":745,"url":"Basal_ganglia","recorded":1362544206,"links":50,"instances":["c","anatomy","neuroanatomy"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Basal ganglia|","Motor
