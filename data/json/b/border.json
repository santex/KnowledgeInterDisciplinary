define geographic boundaries of political entities or legal\njurisdictions, such as governments, sovereign states, federated states and other\nsubnational entities. Some borders—such as a state's internal administrative\nborders, or inter-state borders within the Schengen Area—are open and completely\nunguarded. Other borders are partially or fully controlled, and may be crossed\nlegally only at designated border checkpoints and border zones may be\ncontrolled.
