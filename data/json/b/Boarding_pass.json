{"cursor":"5936","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n boarding pass with 2D barcode from 2009|thumb]] boarding pass from 2000]] \n\n\nA 'boarding pass' is a document provided by an airline during check-in, giving a\npassenger permission to board the airplane for a particular flight. As a\nminimum, it identifies the passenger, the flight number, and the date and\nscheduled time for departure. In some cases, flyers can check in online and\nprint the boarding passes themselves.\n\nGenerally a passenger with an electronic ticket will only need a boarding pass.\nIf a passenger has a paper airline ticket, that ticket (or flight coupon) may be\nrequired to be attached to the boarding pass for him or her to board the\naircraft. The paper boarding pass (and ticket, if any), or portions, are\nsometimes collected and counted for cross-check of passenger counts by gate\nagents, but more frequently are scanned (via barcode or magnetic stripe). The\nstandards for bar codes and magnetic stripes on boarding passes are published by\nIATA. The bar code standard (BCBP) defines the 2D bar code printed on paper\nboarding passes or sent to mobile phones for electronic boarding passes. The\nmagnetic stripe standard (ATB2) expired in 2010. For \"connecting flights\" there\nwill be a boarding pass needed for each new flight (distinguished by a different\nflight number) regardless of whether a different aircraft is boarded.\n\nMost airports and airlines have automatic readers that will verify the validity\nof the boarding pass at the jetway door or boarding gate. This also\nautomatically updates the airline's database that shows the passenger has\nboarded and the seat is used, and that the checked baggage for that passenger\nmay stay aboard. This speeds up the paperwork process at the gate, but requires\npassengers with paper tickets to check in, surrender the ticket and receive the\ndigitized boarding pass.\n","linknr":304,"url":"Boarding_pass","recorded":1362670124,"links":40,"instances":["airline","transport"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Airline tickets"],"headings":["Mobile boarding passes","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Air_Koryo_boarding_card.JPG/220px-Air_Koryo_boarding_card.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/29/TS_boarding_pass_April_2000.jpg/220px-TS_boarding_pass_April_2000.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5f/Mobile_boarding_pass_KLM.JPG/220px-Mobile_boarding_pass_KLM.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["boarding","transport"],["iberia","airline"]],"members":["iberia","boarding"],"related":["Airport_check-in","Boarding_(transport)","Electronic_ticket","Airline_ticket","IATA","Bar_Coded_Boarding_Pass","ATB2","Jetway","E-mail","Text_message","Bar_code","Air_India","United_Airlines","AirAsia","Singapore_Airlines","Air_Canada","WestJet","Cathay_Pacific_Airways","Delta_Air_Lines","JetBlue_Airways","American_Airlines","Alaska_Airlines","Lufthansa","Scandinavian_Airlines","Jetstar_Airways","Iberia_(airline)","US_Airways","KLM","Aer_Lingus","Qantas","Transportation_Security_Administration","Alaska_Airlines","SSSS_rating"]}
