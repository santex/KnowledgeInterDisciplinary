Since they are\n polymers, biopolymers contain monomeric units that are covalently bonded to\n form larger structures. There are three main classes of biopolymers, classified\n according to the monomeric units used and the structure of the biopolymer\n formed: polynucleotides (RNA and DNA), which are long polymers composed of 13\n or more nucleotide monomers; polypeptides, which are short polymers of amino\n acids; and polysaccharides, which are often linear bonded polymeric\n carbohydrate structures.
