{"cursor":"48499","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n'Baby talk', also referred to as 'caretaker speech', 'infant-directed speech'\n('IDS') or 'child-directed speech'\n('CDS') and informally as\n\"'motherese'\", \"'parentese'\", \"'mommy talk'\", or \"'daddy talk'\" is a nonstandard\nform of speech used by adults in talking to toddlers and infants.\n\nIt is usually delivered with a \"cooing\" pattern of intonation different from\nthat of normal adult speech: high in pitch, with many glissando variations that\nare more pronounced than those of normal speech. It frequently displays\nhyperarticulation, a measure of clear speech defined by having large amounts of\nacoustic space between vowels as measured by formants. Baby talk is\nalso characterized by the shortening and simplifying of words. Baby talk is\nsimilar to what is used by people when talking to their pets (pet-directed\nspeech), and between adults as a form of affection, intimacy, bullying or\ncondescension.\n","linknr":355,"url":"Baby_talk","recorded":1362480902,"links":26,"instances":["sociolinguistics","linguistics","music","linguistics"],"pdf":["http://www.elsevier.com/authored_subject_sections/S06/S06_345/misc/language_sciences.pdf","http://www.elsevier.com/authored_subject_sections/S06/S06_345/misc/language_sciences.pdf","http://aune.lpl.univ-aix.fr/~labphon10/abstracts/92.pdf","http://aune.lpl.univ-aix.fr/~labphon10/abstracts/92.pdf","http://fds.oup.com/www.oup.com/pdf/13/9780199565962_prelim.pdf"],"categories":["Psycholinguistics","Language varieties and styles","Infancy"],"headings":["Terminology","Purpose and implications","Universality and differences by region","Vocabulary and structure","Characteristics","Examples in literature","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["intonation","linguistics"],["pitch","music"],["assimilation","linguistics"],["register","sociolinguistics"]],"members":["register","assimilation","pitch","intonation"],"related":["Intonation_(linguistics)","Pitch_(music)","Glissando","Acoustic_space","Formants","Developmental_psychology","Gender_role","Cognitive_development","Language_acquisition","Anne_Fernald","Anne_Fernald","Samoa","Bambi_Schieffelin","Assimilation_(linguistics)","Reduplication","Lexical_stress","Syllable","Pragmatics","Verbal_abuse","Bullying","Flirting","Sexual_roleplay","Falsetto","Glissando","Pet","Working_animals","Police_dog","Guard_dog","Dog_communication","Sign_language","American_Sign_Language","Register_(sociolinguistics)","Child-directed_speech","Grammatical_relations","Taboo","English_language","South_African_English","Pacifier","Huggies","Chamber_pot","Reduplication","Speech_impediment","Booth_Tarkington","George_Orwell","Dorothy_Parker","J._K._Rowling","Bellatrix_Lestrange","Harry_Potter","Babbling","Crib_talk","Developmental_psychology","Mama_and_papa","Girneys"]}
