Typically a few micrometres in length, bacteria have a wide\nrange of shapes, ranging from spheres to rods and spirals. Bacteria were among\nthe first life forms to appear on Earth, and are present in most habitats on the\nplanet. Bacteria inhabit soil, water, acidic hot springs, radioactive\nwaste,<ref></ref> and the deep portions of Earth's crust. Bacteria also live in\nplants, animals (see symbiosis), and have survived in space.<ref>http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-\nnasa/2007/11may_locad3/</ref>\n\nThere are typically 40 million bacterial cells in a gram of soil and a million\nbacterial cells in a millilitre of fresh water. There are approximately\n5×10<sup>30</sup> bacteria on Earth,<ref name=pmid9618454></ref> forming a\nbiomass that exceeds that of all plants and animals.<ref>C.Michael Hogan. 2010.\n[http://www.eoearth.org/article/Bacteria?topic=49480 Bacteria. Encyclopedia of\nEarth. eds. Sidney Draggan and C.J.Cleveland, National Council for Science and\nthe Environment, Washington DC]</ref> Bacteria are vital in recycling nutrients,\nwith many steps in nutrient cycles depending on these organisms, such as the\nfixation of nitrogen from the atmosphere and putrefaction. In the biological\ncommunities surrounding hydrothermal vents and cold seeps, bacteria provide the\nnutrients needed to sustain life by converting dissolved compounds such as\nhydrogen sulphide and methane to energy. On 17 March 2013, researchers reported\ndata that suggested bacterial life forms thrive in the Mariana Trench, the\ndeepest spot on the Earth.<ref name=\"LS-20130317\"></ref><ref name=\"NG-\n20130317\"></ref> Other researchers reported related studies that microbes thrive\ninside rocks up to 1900 feet below the sea floor under 8500 feet of ocean off\nthe coast of the northwestern United States.<ref name=\"LS-20130317\" /><ref name=\"LS-\n20130314\"></ref> According to one of the researchers,\"You can find microbes\neverywhere — they're extremely adaptable to conditions, and survive wherever\nthey are.\"<ref name=\"LS-20130317\" />\n\nMost bacteria have not been characterised, and only about half of the phyla of\nbacteria have species that can be grown in the laboratory.<ref name=Rappe></ref>\nThe study of bacteria is known as bacteriology, a branch of microbiology.\n\nThere are approximately ten times as many bacterial cells in the human flora as\nthere are human cells in the body, with large numbers of bacteria on the skin\nand as gut flora.<ref></ref> The vast majority of the bacteria in the body are\nrendered harmless by the protective effects of the immune system, and a few are\nbeneficial. However, a few species of bacteria are pathogenic and cause\ninfectious diseases, including cholera, syphilis, anthrax, leprosy, and bubonic\nplague. The most common fatal bacterial diseases are respiratory infections,\nwith tuberculosis alone killing about 2 million people a year, mostly in sub-\nSaharan Africa.<ref></ref> In developed countries, antibiotics are used to treat\nbacterial infections and in agriculture, so antibiotic resistance is becoming\ncommon. In industry, bacteria are important in sewage treatment and the\nbreakdown of oil spills, the production of cheese and yogurt through\nfermentation, the recovery of gold, palladium, copper and other metals in the\nmining sector,<ref></ref> as well as in biotechnology, and the manufacture of\nantibiotics and other chemicals.<ref></ref>\n\nOnce regarded as plants constituting the class 'Schizomycetes', bacteria are now\nclassified as prokaryotes. Unlike cells of animals and other eukaryotes,\nbacterial cells do not contain a nucleus and rarely harbour membrane-bound\norganelles. Although the term bacteria traditionally included all prokaryotes,\nthe scientific classification changed after the discovery in the 1990s that\nprokaryotes consist of two very different groups of organisms that evolved from\nan ancient common ancestor. These evolutionary domains are called Bacteria and\nArchaea.<ref name=autogenerated2></ref>\n",
