If two\nproducts are said to be bioequivalent it means that they would be expected to\nbe, for all intents and purposes, the same.\n\nBirkett (2003) defined bioequivalence by stating that, \"two pharmaceutical\nproducts are bioequivalent if they are pharmaceutically equivalent and their\nbioavailabilities (rate and extent of availability) after administration in the\nsame molar dose are similar to such a degree that their effects, with respect to\nboth efficacy and safety, can be expected to be essentially the same.\nPharmaceutical equivalence implies the same amount of the same active\nsubstance(s), in the same dosage form, for the same route of administration and\nmeeting the same or comparable standards.\"\n\nThe United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has defined bioequivalence\nas, \"the absence of a significant difference in the rate and extent to which the\nactive ingredient or active moiety in pharmaceutical equivalents or\npharmaceutical alternatives becomes available at the site of drug action when\nadministered at the same molar dose under similar conditions in an appropriately\ndesigned study.\"\n","linknr":189,"url":"Bioequivalence","recorded":1362504841,"links":24,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm070124.pdf","http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm070124.pdf","http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Scientific_guideline/2010/01/WC500070039.pdf","http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Scientific_guideline/2010/01/WC500070039.pdf"],"categories":["Pharmacokinetics","Clinical research"],"headings":["Bioequivalence","Regulatory definition","See also","References","Further reading"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Pharmacokinetics","In_vivo","Bioavailability","United_States","Food_and_Drug_Administration","Australia","Therapeutics_Goods_Administration","Confidence_interval","Therapeutic_index","Digoxin","Phenytoin","European_Economic_Area","Confidence_interval","Generic_drug","Pharmacokinetics","Clinical_trial"]}
