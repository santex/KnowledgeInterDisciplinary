It is\ninhabited almost entirely by employees of the Moroccan-controlled Bou Craa\nphosphate industry. During the Spanish colonization of the area (see Spanish\nSahara) time, many early recruits of the nationalist movements Harakat Tahrir\nand Front Polisario were Sahrawi workers in the phosphate mines.\n\nThe phosphates are transported to the coast by an automated conveyor belt, the\nlongest such belt in the world. This transportation system was vandalized and\ndisabled several times by the Front Polisario, during the war between the\nMoroccan Royal Army and the Polisario Front from 1976. These attacks gradually\nceased after the town was enclosed in the early 1980s by the Moroccan Wall, and\nthe town is presently under Moroccan control.\n","linknr":122,"url":"Bu_Craa","recorded":1362372478,"links":29,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Populated places in Western Sahara"],"headings":["Satellite images"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/10/Western_Sahara_location_map.svg/300px-Western_Sahara_location_map.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/0c/Red_pog.svg/6px-Red_pog.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/Flag_of_Morocco.svg/22px-Flag_of_Morocco.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/26/Flag_of_the_Sahrawi_Arab_Democratic_Republic.svg/22px-Flag_of_the_Sahrawi_Arab_Democratic_Republic.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cf/Western_Sahara_outline.svg/30px-Western_Sahara_outline.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Countries_of_the_world","Western_Sahara","Saguia_el-Hamra","Western_Sahara","El_Aaiún","Morocco","Phosphate","Spain","Colonialism","Spanish_Sahara","Nationalist","Harakat_Tahrir","Front_Polisario","Conveyor_belt","Polisario_Front","Moroccan_Wall","Google_maps"]}
