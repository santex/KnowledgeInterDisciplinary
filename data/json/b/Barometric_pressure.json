{"cursor":"18373","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n'Atmospheric pressure' is the force per unit area exerted on a surface by the\nweight of air above that surface in the atmosphere of Earth (or that of another\nplanet). In most circumstances atmospheric pressure is closely approximated by\nthe hydrostatic pressure caused by the mass of air above the measurement point.\nLow-pressure areas have less atmospheric mass above their location, whereas high-\npressure areas have more atmospheric mass above their location. Likewise, as\nelevation increases, there is less overlying atmospheric mass, so that\natmospheric pressure decreases with increasing elevation. On average, a column\nof air one square centimeter in cross-section, measured from sea level to the\ntop of the atmosphere, has a mass of about 1.03 kg and weight of about\n10.1 N (2.28 lb f) (A column one square inch in cross-\nsection would have a weight of about 14.7 lbs, or about 65.4 N). Over\nthe area of your body, there is about 1,000 kg of air; this is approximately the\nsame as having a small car press down on you.\n","linknr":604,"url":"Barometric_pressure","recorded":1362371846,"links":87,"instances":["element","unit","meteorology","unit","force","unit"],"pdf":["http://psas.pdx.edu/RocketScience/PressureAltitude_Derived.pdf"],"categories":["Atmosphere","Atmospheric thermodynamics","Pressure","Underwater diving physics"],"headings":["Standard atmospheric pressure","Mean sea level pressure","Altitude atmospheric pressure variation","Local atmospheric pressure variation","Atmospheric pressure records","Atmospheric pressure based on height of water","Boiling point of water","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/20/BernoullisLawDerivationDiagram.svg/220px-BernoullisLawDerivationDiagram.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/17/Mslp-jja-djf.png/220px-Mslp-jja-djf.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c6/Aircraft_altimeter.JPG/220px-Aircraft_altimeter.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c9/Storm_over_Sn%C3%A6fellsj%C3%B6kull.jpg/220px-Storm_over_Sn%C3%A6fellsj%C3%B6kull.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/Atmospheric_Pressure_vs._Altitude.png/300px-Atmospheric_Pressure_vs._Altitude.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e9/Plastic_bottle_at_14000_feet%2C_9000_feet_and_1000_feet%2C_sealed_at_14000_feet.png/220px-Plastic_bottle_at_14000_feet%2C_9000_feet_and_1000_feet%2C_sealed_at_14000_feet.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/b/5/5b5cdd7bddb7a752110211845dfe3cf9.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Wilma1315z-051019-1kg12.jpg/220px-Wilma1315z-051019-1kg12.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/Kochendes_wasser02.jpg/220px-Kochendes_wasser02.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/Helmet_logo_for_Underwater_Diving_portal.png/20px-Helmet_logo_for_Underwater_Diving_portal.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/SpongeDiver.jpg/100px-SpongeDiver.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["pound","force"],["atmosphere","unit"],["pascal","unit"],["bar","unit"],["pascal","unit"],["isobar","meteorology"],["mercury","element"],["atmosphere","unit"]],"members":["mercury","bar","isobar","atmosphere","pound","pascal"],"related":["Atmosphere_of_Earth","Fluid_pressure","Mass","Earth's_atmosphere","Elevation","Sea_level","Weight","Pound_(force)","Atmosphere_(unit)","Units_of_pressure","Pascal_(unit)","ICAO_Standard_Atmosphere","Bar_(unit)","Pascal_(unit)","MmHg","Torr","InHg","Pounds_per_square_inch","International_Union_of_Pure_and_Applied_Chemistry","Torr","InHg","Standard_temperature_and_pressure","Altitude","Sea_level","Lapse_rate","Internet","Barometer","Isobar_(meteorology)","QNH","Q_codes","Mnemonic","MmHg","METAR","United_States","Canada","Colombia","Mercury_(element)","Environment_Canada","Earth","Siberia","Siberian_High","Tropical_cyclone","Tornado","Mesosphere","Troposphere","Barometric_formula","Earth","Weather","Climate","Pressure_system","Atmospheric_tides","Tosontsengel,_Zavkhan","Typhoon_Tip","Barometer","Suction","Natural_gas","HPa","Barometer","Strain_gauge","Boiling","Vapor_pressure","Sea_level","Atmosphere_(unit)","Barometric_formula","Barotrauma","International_Standard_Atmosphere","NRLMSISE-00","Plenum","Subtropical_high_belts","Cabin_pressurization","NASA","Georgia_State_University","QuickTime"]}
