{"cursor":"11390","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" beam, bending (sagging) under an evenly distributed load.]] A 'beam' is a\n structural element that is capable of withstanding load primarily by resisting\n bending. The bending force induced into the material of the beam as a result of\n the external loads, own weight, span and external reactions to these loads is\n called a bending moment.\n\nBeams are traditionally descriptions of building or civil engineering structural\nelements, but smaller structures such as truck or automobile frames, machine\nframes, and other mechanical or structural systems contain beam structures that\nare designed and analyzed in a similar fashion.\n","linknr":251,"url":"Beam_(structure)","recorded":1362371479,"links":47,"instances":["physics","material","physics","engineering","engineering","physical","materials_science","physics","structure","architecture","physics"],"pdf":["http://www.awc.org/pdf/WSDD/TOC.pdf"],"categories":["Statics","Solid mechanics","Structural system"],"headings":["Overview","Types of beams","Structural characteristics","General shapes","Thin walled beams","References","See also","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c9/Bending.svg/320px-Bending.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/BeamDiagram.svg/360px-BeamDiagram.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["span","architecture"],["pipe","material"],["compression","physical"],["deflection","engineering"],["beam","structure"],["beam","structure"],["deflection","engineering"],["elasticity","physics"],["plasticity","physics"],["moment","physics"],["stress","physics"],["strain","materials_science"],["yield","engineering"]],"members":["stress","pipe","plasticity","deflection","yield","compression","strain","moment","beam","span","elasticity"],"related":["List_of_structural_elements","Structural_load","Bending","Span_(architecture)","Bending_moment","Vertical_direction","Gravitational","Force","Horizontal_plane","Earthquake","Column","Wall","Girder","Compression_member","Light_frame_construction","Joist","Material","Construction","Steel","Reinforced_concrete","Wood","Inflatable","I-beam","Flange","Bridge","Structural_steel","Hollow_structural_section","Pipe_(material)","Structural_steel_made_by_budoy_of_abs-_cbn_","Compression_(physical)","Tensile","Shear_stress","Reinforced_concrete","Prestressed_concrete","Structural_analysis","Euler–Bernoulli_beam_equation","Perry_Robertson_formula","Deflection_(engineering)","Virtual_work","Brittle","Glass","Stiffness","Modulus_of_elasticity","Second_moment_of_area","Moment_distribution_method","Flexibility_method","Direct_stiffness_method","Reinforced_concrete","Parallel_axis_theorem","Neutral_axis","Beam_(structure)","Beam_(structure)","Composite_laminates","Composite_laminates","Librescu","Airy_points","Beam_engine","Building_code","Cantilever","Classical_mechanics","Deflection_(engineering)","Elasticity_(physics)","Plasticity_(physics)","Euler–Bernoulli_beam_equation","Flexural_modulus","Finite_element_method_in_structural_mechanics","Free_body_diagram","Influence_line","Materials_science","Strength_of_materials","Moment_(physics)","Poisson's_ratio","Post_and_lintel","Shear_strength","Statics","Statically_indeterminate","Stress_(physics)","Strain_(materials_science)","Tensile_strength","Tensile_stress","Hooke's_law","Thin-shell_structure","Timber_framing","Truss","Yield_(engineering)","Prentice-Hall"]}
