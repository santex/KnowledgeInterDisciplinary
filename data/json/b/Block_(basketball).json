{"cursor":"5271","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" blocks DuÅ¡ko SavanoviÄ at the EuroBasket 2011]] In basketball, a 'block'\n (short for 'blocked shot'), not to be confused with blocking, occurs when a\n defensive player legally deflects a field goal attempt from an offensive\n player. The defender must not touch the offensive player's hands or otherwise\n a foul is called. In order to be legal, the block must occur while the shot is\n traveling upward or at its apex. A deflected field goal that is made does not\n count as a blocked shot and simply counts as a successful field goal attempt\n for shooter plus the points awarded to the shooting team. Every successful\n blocked shot is counted as a missed field goal attempt for the shooter. Also,\n on a shooting foul, a blocked shot cannot be awarded or counted, even if the\n player who deflected the field goal attempt is different from the player who\n committed the foul. If it is heading downward when the defender hits it, it is\n ruled as goaltending and counts as a made basket. Goaltending is also called\n if the block is made after the ball bounces on the backboard (NFHS excepted;\n the NCAA also used this rule until the 2009â10 season). Nicknames for blocked\n shots include \"rejections,\" \"stuffs,\" \"facials,\" \"swats,\" \"denials,\" and\n \"packs.\" Blocked shots were first officially recorded in the NBA during the\n 1973â74 season.\n\nLargely due to their height and position near the basket, centers and power\nforwards tend to record the most blocks, but shorter players with high leaps can\nalso be blockers, an example being Dwyane Wade, the shortest player, at 6'4\", to\nrecord 100 blocked shots in a single season. A player with the ability to block\nshots can be a positive asset to a team's defense, as they can make it difficult\nfor opposing players to shoot near the basket and by keeping the basketball in\nplay, as opposed to swatting it out of bounds, a blocked shot can lead to a fast\nbreak, a skill Bill Russell was notable for. To be a good shot-blocker, a player\nneeds great court sense and timing, and good height or jumping ability. One\ntactic is that a shot-blocker can intimidate opponents to alter their shots,\nresulting in a miss.\n","linknr":301,"url":"Block_(basketball)","recorded":1363121049,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Block_(basketball)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Block_(basketball)&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/File:Serbia_against_Slovenia_2.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c1/Serbia_against_Slovenia_2.jpg/220px-Serbia_against_Slovenia_2.jpg","/wiki/File:Serbia_against_Slovenia_2.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Mirza_Begi%C4%87","/wiki/Du%C5%A1ko_Savanovi%C4%87","/wiki/EuroBasket_2011","/wiki/Basketball","/wiki/Personal_foul_(basketball)#Charging_and_blocking","/wiki/Field_goal_(basketball)","/wiki/Goaltending","/wiki/National_Federation_of_State_High_School_Associations","/wiki/National_Basketball_Association","/wiki/Center_(basketball)","/wiki/Power_forward_(basketball)","/wiki/Dwyane_Wade","#Chase-down_block","#Shot_blocking_records_in_the_NBA","#Shot_blocking_records_in_the_NCAA","#See_also","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Block_(basketball)&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Fast_break","/wiki/Lay-up","/wiki/Tayshaun_Prince","/wiki/Reggie_Miller","/wiki/2004_NBA_Playoffs","#cite_note-chase-1","/w/index.php?title=Block_(basketball)&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Elmore_Smith","/wiki/Elmore_Smith","/wiki/George_T._Johnson_(basketball)","/wiki/Manute_Bol","/wiki/Mark_Eaton_(basketball)","/wiki/Hakeem_Olajuwon","/wiki/Mark_Eaton_(basketball)","/wiki/Dwight_Howard","/wiki/Andrew_Bynum","/wiki/Hakeem_Olajuwon","/wiki/Mark_Eaton_(basketball)","/w/index.php?title=Block_(basketball)&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/File:Shawn_James.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9b/Shawn_James.jpg/180px-Shawn_James.jpg","/wiki/File:Shawn_James.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Shawn_James","/wiki/Jarvis_Varnado","/wiki/Mississippi_State_Bulldogs_basketball","/wiki/David_Robinson_(basketball)","/wiki/Navy","/wiki/Shawn_James","/wiki/Northeastern_Huskies_men%27s_basketball","/wiki/Kentucky_Wildcats_basketball","/w/index.php?title=Block_(basketball)&action=edit&section=4","/wiki/List_of_National_Basketball_Association_career_blocks_leaders","/wiki/List_of_National_Basketball_Association_season_blocks_leaders","/wiki/List_of_National_Basketball_Association_players_with_most_blocks_in_a_game","/wiki/List_of_NCAA_Division_I_men%27s_basketball_career_blocks_leaders","/wiki/List_of_NCAA_Division_I_men%27s_basketball_season_blocks_leaders","/wiki/List_of_NCAA_Division_I_men%27s_basketball_players_with_13_or_more_blocks_in_a_game","/w/index.php?title=Block_(basketball)&action=edit&section=5","#cite_ref-chase_1-0","http://www.cleveland.com/cavs/plaindealer/index.ssf?/base/sports/123745144820540.xml&coll=2","/w/index.php?title=Block_(basketball)&action=edit&section=6","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Blocked_shot_(basketball)","http://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/BLK_career.html","http://youtube.com/watch?v=nWFsL4Y8RVA","/wiki/Template:Basketball","/wiki/Template_talk:Basketball","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Basketball&action=edit","/wiki/Basketball","/wiki/History_of_basketball","/wiki/James_Naismith","/wiki/Variations_of_basketball","/wiki/List_of_basketball_leagues","/wiki/Glossary_of_basketball_terms","/wiki/Outline_of_basketball","/wiki/Index_of_basketball-related_articles","/wiki/File:Basketball.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/Basketball.png/120px-Basketball.png","/wiki/Rules_of_basketball","/wiki/Three_seconds_rule","/wiki/Defensive_three-second_violation","/wiki/Five-second_rule_(basketball)","/wiki/Basket_interference","/wiki/Bonus_(basketball)","/wiki/Carrying_(basketball)","/wiki/Double_dribble","/wiki/Foul_(basketball)","/wiki/Flagrant_foul","/wiki/Personal_foul_(basketball)","/wiki/Technical_foul","/wiki/Goaltending","/wiki/Official_(basketball)","/wiki/Traveling_(basketball)","/wiki/Turnover_(basketball)","/wiki/Jump_ball","/wiki/Air_ball","/wiki/Alley-oop_(basketball)","/wiki/Assist_(basketball)","/wiki/Backboard_shattering","/wik
