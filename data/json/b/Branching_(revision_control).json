{"cursor":"4699","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Branching', in revision control and software configuration management, is\nthe duplication of an object under revision control (such as a source code\nfile, or a directory tree) so that modifications can happen in parallel along\nboth branches.\n\nBranches are also known as trees, streams or codelines. The originating branch\nis sometimes called the parent branch, the upstream branch (or simply upstream,\nespecially if the branches are maintained by different organizations or\nindividuals), or the backing stream. Child branches are branches that have a\nparent; a branch without a parent is referred to as the [[Trunk\n(software)|trunk]] or the mainline. {{cite book\n|url=http://www.scmpatterns.com/book|title=Software Configuration Management\nPatterns: Effective Teamwork, Practical Integration |first=Steve |last=Berczuk\n|coauthors=Brad Appleton |id=ISBN 0201741172|year=2003|publisher=Addison-Wesley|accessdate=2007-05-\n24}} \n\nIn some distributed revision control systems, such as Darcs, there is no\ndistinction made between repositories and branches; in these systems, fetching a\ncopy of a repository is equivalent to branching.\n\nBranching also generally implies the ability to later merge or integrate changes\nback onto the parent branch. Often the changes are merged back to the trunk,\neven if this is not the parent branch. A branch not intended to be merged (e.g.\nbecause it has been relicensed under an incompatible license by a third party,\nor it attempts to serve a different purpose) is usually called a [[Fork\n(software development)|fork]].\n","linknr":194,"url":"Branching_(revision_control)","recorded":1362559791,"links":25,"instances":["software_design","version_control","software","revision_control","computing"],"pdf":["http://www.hillside.net/plop/plop98/final_submissions/P37.pdf","http://www.hillside.net/plop/plop98/final_submissions/P37.pdf","http://www.hillside.net/plop/plop98/final_submissions/P37.pdf"],"categories":["Revision control"],"headings":["Motivations for branching","Development branch","Shadow or magic branches","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/Revision_controlled_project_visualization-2010-24-02.svg/60px-Revision_controlled_project_visualization-2010-24-02.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/82/Software_spanner.png/40px-Software_spanner.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["repository","version_control"],["merge","revision_control"],["patch","computing"],["feature","software_design"],["merge","revision_control"],["trunk","software"]],"members":["feature","repository","trunk","merge","patch"],"related":["Revision_control","Software_configuration_management","Source_code","Directory_tree","Addison-Wesley","Darcs","Repository_(version_control)","Merge_(revision_control)","Relicensing","Software_quality_assurance","Patch_(computing)","Feature_(software_design)","Software_versioning","System_integration","Merge_(revision_control)","Development","Software_development","Software_release","Open_source","Concurrent_Version_System","Cvc_system","CVSNT","RPath","Trunk_(software)","Revision_tag"]}
