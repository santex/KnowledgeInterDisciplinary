{"cursor":"11569","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\nThe 'Baghdad Battery', sometimes referred to as the 'Parthian Battery', is the\ncommon name for a number of artifacts created in Mesopotamia, during the\ndynasties of Parthian or Sassanid period (the early centuries AD), and probably\ndiscovered in 1936 in the village of Khuyut Rabbou'a, near Baghdad, Iraq. These\nartifacts came to wider attention in 1938 when Wilhelm KÃ¶nig, the German\ndirector of the National Museum of Iraq, found the objects in the museum's\ncollections. In 1940, KÃ¶nig published a paper speculating that they may have\nbeen galvanic cells, perhaps used for electroplating gold onto silver\nobjects.

Though far from settled, this interpretation\ncontinues to be considered as at least a hypothetical possibility. If correct, the artifacts would predate Alessandro Volta's\n1800 invention of the electrochemical cell by more than a millennium.\n","linknr":266,"url":"Baghdad_Battery","recorded":1362485551,"links":37,"instances":["element","electricity","geometry","archaeology","electricity"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Out-of-place artifacts","Pseudoarchaeology","Parthian Empire","Sassanid Empire"],"headings":["Description and dating","In the media","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/Ironie_pile_Bagdad.jpg/220px-Ironie_pile_Bagdad.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cylinder","geometry"],["typology","archaeology"],["battery","electricity"],["current","electricity"],["mercury","element"],["mythbusters","2005_season#baghdad_battery"]],"members":["mythbusters","mercury","battery","cylinder","typology","current"],"related":["Mesopotamia","Parthia","Sassanid","AD","Khujut_Rabu","Baghdad","Iraq","Wilhelm_König","National_Museum_of_Iraq","Galvanic_cell","Electroplating","Gold","Silver","Alessandro_Volta","Electrochemical_cell","Terracotta","Copper","Cylinder_(geometry)","Iron","Bitumen","Electrochemical_cell","Lemon_juice","Grape_juice","Vinegar","Acid","Electrolyte","Electric_current","Electrochemical_potential","Electrode","BBC","Parthian_Empire","Ancient_Near_East","British_Museum","Typology_(archaeology)","Sassanid_dynasty","Archaeological_science","Thermoluminescence_dating","Ion","Diffusion","Electrolyte","Electric_potential","Electrical_current","Wet_cell","Electroplating","Battery_(electricity)","Second_World_War","Willard_Gray","Current_(electricity)","Grape_juice","Benzoquinone","Beetle","Quinone","Mercury_(element)","Archaeologist","Experimental_archaeology","Thermoplastic","Hermetic_seal","Electrolyte","Scroll","Seleucia_on_the_Tigris","Papyrus","Parchment","Organic_matter","Egyptology","Grape_juice","Volt","Electroplating","Silver","Statuette","Gold","Cyanide","Discovery_Channel","Lemon_juice","Electrolyte","Volts","Electroplating","Acupuncture","Religious_experience","Ark_of_the_Covenant","Cherubim","Electric_fence","Divine_presence","Ken_Feder","Dendera_light","Galvanization","History_of_electromagnetism","History_of_the_battery","Leyden_jar"]}
