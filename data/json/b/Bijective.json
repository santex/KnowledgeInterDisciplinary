{"cursor":"14803","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nA 'bijection' (or 'bijective function' or 'one-to-one correspondence') is a\nfunction giving an exact pairing of the elements of two sets. Every element of\none set is paired with exactly one element of the other set, and every element\nof the other set is paired with exactly one element of the first set. There are\nno unpaired elements. In formal mathematical terms, a bijective function f: X â\nY is a one to one and onto mapping of a set X to a set Y.\n\nA bijection from the set X to the set Y has an inverse function from Y to X. If\nX and Y are finite sets, then the existence of a bijection means they have the\nsame number of elements. For infinite sets the picture is more complex, leading\nto the concept of cardinal number, a way to distinguish the various sizes of\ninfinite sets.\n\nA bijective function from a set to itself is also called a [[permutation]].\n\nBijective functions are essential to many areas of mathematics including the\ndefinitions of isomorphism, homeomorphism, diffeomorphism, permutation group,\nand projective map.\n","linknr":269,"url":"Bijective","recorded":1362543727,"links":56,"instances":["mathematics","baseball","mathematics","mathematics","mathematics","mathematics","mathematics","mathematics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Functions and mappings","Basic concepts in set theory","Mathematical relations","Types of functions"],"headings":["Definition","Examples","More mathematical examples and some non-examples","Inverses","Composition","Bijections and cardinality","Properties","Bijections and category theory","See also","Notes","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/Bijection.svg/200px-Bijection.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/6/c/0/6c0a58a4f578e6935da256ec3565e101.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/3/5/3/35316cec6b1d2a60462f00bf261801c1.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/6/4/5/645ffa935091ad6e63c76f274947522f.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/6/4/5/645ffa935091ad6e63c76f274947522f.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/2/6/826bde984f4c1661061e83d119a2e0cd.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/Bijective_composition.svg/300px-Bijective_composition.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/6/4/5/645ffa935091ad6e63c76f274947522f.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/Nuvola_apps_edu_mathematics_blue-p.svg/28px-Nuvola_apps_edu_mathematics_blue-p.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6d/Venn_A_intersect_B.svg/80px-Venn_A_intersect_B.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["function","mathematics"],["function","mathematics"],["onto","mathematics"],["batting_order","baseball"],["relation","mathematics"],["composition","mathematics"],["group","algebra"],["injection","mathematics"],["set","mathematics"],["group","mathematics"]],"members":["group","batting_order","onto","function","injection","composition","relation","set"],"related":["Function_(mathematics)","Inverse_function","Finite_set","Infinite_set","Cardinal_number","Isomorphism","Homeomorphism","Diffeomorphism","Permutation_group","Projective_map","Function_(mathematics)","Domain_of_a_function","Onto_(mathematics)","Surjective_function","One-to-one_function","Injective_function","Batting_order_(baseball)","Baseball","Social_security_number","National_identification_number","Unique_identifier","Identity_function","Linear_function","Codomain","Exponential_function","Natural_logarithm","Domain_of_a_function","Relation_(mathematics)","Inverse_relation","Inverse_function","Invertible_function","Composition_(mathematics)","Injective_function","Surjective_function","Finite_set","Iff","Axiomatic_set_theory","Equinumerosity","Infinite_set","Cardinal_number","Graph_of_a_function","Group_(algebra)","Symmetric_group","Factorial","Cardinalities","Finite_set","Surjection","Injection_(mathematics)","Total_ordering","Permutation","Isomorphism","Category_theory","Category_of_sets","Set_(mathematics)","Category_of_groups","Group_(mathematics)","Homomorphism","Injective_function","Surjective_function","Bijection,_injection_and_surjection","Symmetric_group","Bijective_numeration","Bijective_proof","Cardinality","Category_theory","Ax–Grothendieck_theorem"]}
