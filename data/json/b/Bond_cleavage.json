{"cursor":"1590","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Bond cleavage', or 'scission', is the splitting of chemical bonds.\n\nIf the two electrons in a cleaved covalent bond are divided between the\nproducts, the process is known as homolytic fission or homolysis and free\nradicals are generated by homolytic cleavage. Alternatively, the case where both\nelectrons are retained by one product and charged species that is nucleophile\nand electrophile are generated by the process is known as heterolytic fission\nand (heterolysis). The term \"bond dissociation energy\" refers to the energy\nrequired to cleave a bond (typically homolytically).\n\nIn biochemistry the process of breaking down large molecules (by splitting their\ninternal bonds) is catabolism. Enzymes which catalyse bond cleavage are known as\nlyases, unless they operate by hydrolysis or oxidation/reduction, in which case\nthey are known as hydrolases and oxidoreductases respectively.\n","linknr":100,"url":"Bond_cleavage","recorded":1362902297,"links":16,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Chemical bonding"],"headings":["Heterolytic cleavage"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/Chem_template.svg/32px-Chem_template.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Chemical_bond","Covalent_bond","Homolysis","Heterolysis","Bond_dissociation_energy","Catabolism","Enzymes","Lyase","Hydrolysis","Oxidation","Hydrolase","Oxidoreductase","Shared_pair"]}
