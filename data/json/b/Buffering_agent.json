{"cursor":"4819","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"Buffer}} A 'buffering agent' is a weak acid or base used to maintain the acidity\n(pH) of a solution near a chosen value after the addition of another acid or\nbase. That is, the function of a buffering agent is to prevent a rapid change in\npH when acids or bases are added to the solution. Buffering agents have variable\npropertiesâsome are more soluble than others; some are acidic while others are\nbasic. As pH managers, they are important in many chemical applications,\nincluding agriculture, food processing, biochemistry, medicine and photography.\n","linknr":130,"url":"Buffering_agent","recorded":1362372445,"links":13,"instances":["chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Acid-base chemistry","Buffers"],"headings":["What is a buffering agent?","How a buffering agent works","Examples","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/math/a/a/e/aae4404d9bb5bf2d037d6a1036cf6f8f.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/b/d/3/bd329c8e51e9d095c4ae52e913b64170.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/2/4/824bae0f6ce1dc2f7c741030e3cf7c51.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["basic","chemistry"]],"members":["basic"],"related":["PH","Solution","Acidic","Basic_(chemistry)","Chemical","Agriculture","Food_processing","Biochemistry","Medicine","Photography","Buffer_solution","Strong_acid","Strong_base","Covalent","Henderson-Hasselbalch_equation","Le_Chatelier's_principle","Monopotassium_phosphate","Urea","Diammonium_phosphate","PH","Nitrogen","Potassium","Acid_base_homeostasis","Bicarbonate","Ammonia","Protein","Phosphate","Monosodium_phosphate","Disodium_phosphate","Enema","Shampoos","Soap","Buffer_solution","Good's_buffers"]}
