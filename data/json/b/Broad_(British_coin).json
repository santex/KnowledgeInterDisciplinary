{"cursor":"1667","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nThe 'Broad' was a British coin worth 20 shillings (20/-) issued by the\nCommonwealth of England in 1656. It was a milled gold coin weighing 9.0â9.1\ngrams, with a diameter of 29 or 30 millimetres, designed by Thomas Simon (also\ncalled Symonds).\n\nThe obverse of the coin depicts the Lord Protector Oliver Cromwell as a\nlaureated Roman emperor, with the inscription OLIVAR D G R P ANG SCO HIB\n&c PRO -- Oliver, by the Grace of God, Protector of the Republic of\nEngland, Scotland, Ireland, etc., -- while the reverse shows a crowned shield\ndepicting the arms of the Commonwealth with the inscription PAX QVAERITVR\nBELLO 1656 -- Peace is sought through war.\n\nThe current value of the coin in \"very fine\" to \"extremely fine\" condition is\nÂ£3500 to Â£6000 as the pieces are very rare, but normally fairly unworn, although\na Mr Pinkerton, writing at the time that the coins circulated, noted that many\nof the coins in circulation were so worn as to be almost flat.\n\nA piedfort version of the coin with an edge inscription is known as a Fifty\nshilling piece. This is extremely rare, and there are very few examples as it is\nprobably a pattern.\n","linknr":145,"url":"Broad_(British_coin)","recorded":1362545107,"links":19,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["English gold coins","1656 in England","Oliver Cromwell","Interregnum (England)"],"headings":["External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/Edward_III_noble_%28obverse%29.png/120px-Edward_III_noble_%28obverse%29.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/Money_template.svg/35px-Money_template.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Great_Britain","Coin","Commonwealth_of_England","Gold_coin","Gram","Diameter","Thomas_Simon","Obverse","Oliver_Cromwell","Roman_emperor","Piedfort","British_Fifty_Shilling_coin"]}
