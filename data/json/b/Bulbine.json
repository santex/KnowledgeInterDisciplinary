(Formerly it was placed in the Liliaceae. )\nBulbine is found chiefly in Southern Africa, with few species extending into\ntropical Africa and a few species in Australia.\n\nBulbine is characterised by having flowers borne in lax or compound racemes, and\nby being succulent. The flowers are mostly yellow, with\nbearded stamens, although sometimes white, orange or pink.\nSeveral species are grown in gardens, although the most common species in the\nhorticultural trade is [[Bulbine frutescens|B. frutescens]].\nSpecies of Bulbine resemble [[Haworthia]] and [[Aloe]] in appearance, but with\nsoft fleshy leaves, many with tuberous roots or a caudex. The various species\ngrow as shrubs, rough tough weedy perennials, dwarf geophytes, and soft annuals.\nMany of the dwarf species have small, dome-shaped tubers.\n\nDormancy starts in late spring and lasts until mid autumn, but can vary between\nspecies and in different conditions. Leaves die and drop and the roots contract\ninto the caudex leaving no visible sign of life on the surface. Propagation is\nmostly by seed although cuttings are possible as some species will form multiple\nheads or offsets.\n","linknr":314,"url":"Bulbine","recorded":1362482624,"links":22,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Bulbine|","Xanthorrhoeaceae genera"],"headings":["Species","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/Bulbine_bulbosa_flower.jpg/220px-Bulbine_bulbosa_flower.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Nathanael_Matthaeus_von_Wolf","Plant","Xanthorrhoeaceae","Asphodeloideae","Tuber","Liliaceae","Southern_Africa","Tropical_Africa","Australia","Raceme","Succulent_plant","Stamen","Tuber","Root","Caudex","Shrub","Weed","Perennial","Geophyte","Annual_plant","Dormancy","Plant_Propagation","Cutting"]}
