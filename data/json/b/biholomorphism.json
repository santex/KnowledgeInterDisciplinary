More generally, U and V can be complex\nmanifolds. By applying the chain rule, one may prove that it is enough for\n<math>\\phi</math> to be holomorphic and one-to-one in order for it to be\nbiholomorphic onto its image.\n\nIf there exists a biholomorphism <math>\\phi \\colon U \\to V</math>, we say that U\nand V are 'biholomorphically equivalent' or that they are 'biholomorphic'.\n\nIf <math>n=1,</math> every simply connected open set other than the whole\ncomplex plane is biholomorphic to the unit disc (this is the Riemann mapping\ntheorem). The situation is very different in higher dimensions. For example,\nopen unit balls and open unit polydiscs are not biholomorphically equivalent for\n<math>n>1.</math> In fact, there does not exist even a proper holomorphic\nfunction from one to the other.\n\nIn the case of the complex plane 'C', some authors (e.g. Freitag 2009,\nDefinition IV.4.1) define conformal map as a synonym for biholomorphism. The\nusual conditions for a function <math>\\phi</math> to be conformal on 'C' -\nnamely, that <math>\\phi</math> is holomorphic and that its derivative is nowhere\nzero - are equivalent to biholomorphism.\n","title":"biholomorphism","headings":["References"]},"micro-relation":["4: Holomorphic_function","1: Mathematics","1: Complex_analysis","1: Several_complex_variables","1: Complex_algebraic_geometry","1: Bijective","1: Inverse_function","1: Open_subset","1: Injective_function","1: Complex_manifold","1: Simply_connected","1: Unit_disc","1: Riemann_mapping_theorem","1: Unit_ball","1: Polydisc","1: Proper_map","1: Conformal_map"]}
