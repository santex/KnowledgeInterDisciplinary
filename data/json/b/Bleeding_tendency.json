Several types are distinguished, ranging from mild to lethal.\nAlso, bleeding diathesis can be caused by thinning of the skin or impaired\nwound healing.\n","linknr":388,"url":"Bleeding_tendency","recorded":1362675118,"links":22,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.primaryimmune.org/publications/book_pats/e_ch07.pdf"],"categories":["Coagulopathies"],"headings":["Hypocoagulability","Causes other than coagulation","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/Rod_of_Asclepius2.svg/15px-Rod_of_Asclepius2.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Medicine","Hematology","Hemorrhage","Coagulopathy","Coagulation","Wound_healing","Coagulopathy","Anticoagulation","Warfarin","Liver_failure","Vitamin_K_deficiency","Disseminated_intravascular_coagulation","Hemotoxic","Snake","Bothrops","Rattlesnakes","Species","Viperidae","Viral_hemorrhagic_fever","Dengue_hemorrhagic_fever","Leukemia","Antiphospholipid_syndrome","Gene","Protein","Hemophilia","Von_Willebrand_disease","Bernard-Soulier_syndrome","Wiskott-Aldrich_syndrome","Glanzmann's_thrombasthenia","Petechiae","Wiskott-Aldrich_syndrome","Acute_leukemia","Chronic_leukemia","Vitamin_K_deficiency","Purpura","Ecchymoses","Blood_in_stool","Wiskott-Aldrich_syndrome","Gingiva","Nose_bleed","Hemophilia","Von_Willebrand_disease","Arthritis","Von_Willebrand_disease","Von_Willebrand_disease","Von_Willebrand_disease","Cerebral_hemorrhage","Wiskott-Aldrich_syndrome","Wound_healing","Scurvy","Cushing's_syndrome"]}
