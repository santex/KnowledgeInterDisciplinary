The somewhat\ncontroversial term was coined during racial segregation in 1960s America at the\ntime of the music genre's emergence in popular music\nculture. http://oldies.about.com/od/soulmotown/g/blueeyedsoul.htm\n\nThe term continued to be used in the 1970s and 1980s, particularly by the\nBritish music press, to describe a new generation of white singers who adopted\nelements of classic soul music. To a lesser extent, the term has been applied to\nsingers in other music genres that are influenced by soul music, such as urban\nmusic and hip-hop soul.\n","linknr":455,"url":"Blue-eyed_soul","recorded":1362669079,"links":39,"instances":["mina_album","song","singer","song","singer","singer","band","boz_scaggs_song","david_bowie_song","drummer","singer","singer","singer","singer","album","subculture"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Soul music genres"],"headings":["1960s and 1970s","1980s and later","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Steve_Winwood_with_Traffic.jpg/170px-Steve_Winwood_with_Traffic.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/Robert-Palmer-Sunset-Strip-%28edit%29.jpg/175px-Robert-Palmer-Sunset-Strip-%28edit%29.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ec/Duffy_%28singer%29.jpg/175px-Duffy_%28singer%29.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["traffic","band"],["tom_jones","singer"],["mod","subculture"],["chris_clark","singer"],["mina","singer"],["the_platinum_collection","mina_album"],["doris","singer"],["fame","david_bowie_song"],["pick_up_the_pieces","song"],["cut_the_cake","album"],["lowdown","boz_scaggs_song"],["tragedy","song"],["michael_mcdonald","singer"],["duffy","singer"],["adele","singer"],["steve_potts","drummer"]],"members":["the_platinum_collection","tragedy","tom_jones","pick_up_the_pieces","michael_mcdonald","mina","traffic","lowdown","fame","steve_potts","chris_clark","adele","doris","duffy","cut_the_cake","mod"],"related":["Soul_music","Pop_music","Rhythm_and_blues","List_of_blue-eyed_soul_artists","Rhythm_and_blues","Soul_music","White_people","Motown","Stax_Records","Record_label","Music_genre","Urban_music","Hip-hop_soul","Traffic_(band)","Cultural_appropriation","Music_genre","Beach_music","Carolina_shag","Fraternity","Bonnie_Bramlett","The_Allman_Brothers","Bill_Deal_and_the_Rhondels","The_Swinging_Medallions","Georgie_Woods","Rhythm_and_blues","Timi_Yuro","Dinah_Washington","The_Righteous_Brothers","The_Rascals","Felix_Cavaliere","Dusty_Springfield","Eric_Burdon","Tom_Jones_(singer)","The_Spencer_Davis_Group","Steve_Winwood","Mod_(subculture)","The_Small_Faces","Booker_T_&_the_MGs","Chris_Clark_(singer)","The_Beatles","The_Rolling_Stones","The_Kinks","The_Who","Jerry_Lee_Lewis","Sun_Records","Michael_Sembello","David_Sanborn","Bobby_Caldwell","Todd_Rundgren","Paul_Butterfield","Garage_rock","Nazz","Italian_popular_music","Mina_(singer)","Carmen_Villani","Italian_pop_music","The_Platinum_Collection_(Mina_album)","Carola_Standertskj√∂ld","Doris_(singer)","YLE","Tower_of_Power","David_Bowie","Fame_(David_Bowie_song)","Hall_&_Oates","Average_White_Band","Pick_Up_the_Pieces_(song)","Cut_the_Cake_(album)","Boz_Scaggs","Lowdown_(Boz_Scaggs_song)","The_Faragher_Brothers","Wild_Cherry","Billboard_Hot_100","Funk/rock","Play_That_Funky_Music","Hot_Soul_Singles","Bee_Gees","Stayin'_Alive","Night_Fever","You_Should_Be_Dancing","Too_Much_Heaven","Tragedy_(song)","Love_You_Inside_Out","George_Michael","Aretha_Franklin","Annie_Lennox","Teena_Marie","Michael_McDonald_(singer)","Hall_&_Oates","Urban_contemporary","Simply_Red","Phil_Collins","Cover_version","Culture_Club","Rick_Astley","The_Style_Council","Eurythmics","Steve_Winwood","Lisa_Stansfield","Christina_Aguilera","Jon_B.","Jamiroquai","98_Degrees","Amy_Winehouse","Joss_Stone","Duffy_(singer)","Adele_(singer)","N'Sync","Justin_Timberlake","R&B","Justified","Guy_Sebastian","Stax_Records","Steve_Cropper","Donald_\"Duck\"_Dunn","Steve_Potts_(drummer)","Mayer_Hawthorne","Remy_Shand","Jamie_Lidell","Robin_Thicke","R&B","1960s_in_music","British_soul","List_of_blue-eyed_soul_artists","Plastic_soul"]}
