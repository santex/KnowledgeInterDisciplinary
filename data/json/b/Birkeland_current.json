Lately, the term Birkeland currents has been expanded by some\nauthors to include magnetic field aligned currents in space plasmas in general.\nIn the Earthâs magnetosphere, the currents are driven by the solar wind and\ninterplanetary magnetic field and by bulk motions of plasma through the\nmagnetosphere (convection which is indirectly driven by the interplanetary\nenvironment). The strength of the Birkeland currents changes with activity in\nthe magnetosphere (e.g. during substorms). Small scale variations in the upward\ncurrent sheets (downward flowing electrons) accelerate magnetospheric electrons\nwhich, when they reach the upper atmosphere, create the Aurora Borealis and\nAustralis. In the high latitude ionosphere (or auroral zones), the Birkeland\ncurrents close through the region of the auroral electrojet, which flows\nperpendicular to the local magnetic field in the ionosphere. The Birkeland\ncurrents occur in two pairs of field-aligned current sheets. One pair extends\nfrom noon through the dusk sector to the midnight sector. The other pair\nextends from noon through the dawn sector to the midnight sector. The sheet on\nthe high latitude side of the auroral zone is referred to as the Region 1\ncurrent sheet and the sheet on the low latitude side is referred to as the\nRegion 2 current sheet.\n\nThe currents were predicted in 1908 by Norwegian explorer and physicist Kristian\nBirkeland, who undertook expeditions beyond the Arctic Circle to study the\naurora. He rediscovered, using simple magnetic field measurement instruments,\nthat when the aurora appeared the needles of magnetometers changed direction,\nconfirming the findings of Anders Celsius and assistant Olof Hjorter more than a\ncentury before. This could only imply that currents were flowing in the\natmosphere above. He theorized that somehow the Sun emitted a cathode\nray, out-of-print, full text online and\ncorpuscles from what is now known as a solar wind entered the Earthâs magnetic\nfield and created currents, thereby creating the aurora. This view was scorned\nby other researchers, but in 1967 a satellite, launched into the\nauroral region, showed that the currents posited by Birkeland existed. In honour\nof him and his theory these currents are named Birkeland currents. A good\ndescription of the discoveries by Birkeland is given in the book by Lucy\nJago.\n\nProfessor Emeritus of the AlfvÃ©n Laboratory in Sweden, Carl-Gunne FÃ¤lthammar\nwrote: \"A reason why Birkeland currents are particularly interesting\nis that, in the plasma forced to carry them, they cause a number of plasma\nphysical processes to occur (waves, instabilities, fine structure formation).\nThese in turn lead to consequences such as acceleration of charged particles,\nboth positive and negative, and element separation (such as preferential\nejection of oxygen ions). Both of these classes of phenomena should have a\ngeneral astrophysical interest far beyond that of understanding the space\nenvironment of our own Earth.\" in his terrella, featuring a magnetised anode\nglobe in an evacuated chamber.]]\n","linknr":380,"url":"Birkeland_current","recorded":1362674145,"links":26,"instances":["physics_articles","astronomer","plasma","astronomy"],"pdf":["http://www.terrapub.co.jp/journals/EPS/pdf/5001/50010043.pdf","http://www.terrapub.co.jp/journals/EPS/pdf/5001/50010043.pdf"],"categories":["Plasma physics","Space plasmas"],"headings":["Characteristics","History","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/24/Schematic-of-combined-FACs-and-ionospheric-current-systems.png/300px-Schematic-of-combined-FACs-and-ionospheric-current-systems.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/bd/Birkeland-anode-globe-fig259.jpg/300px-Birkeland-anode-globe-fig259.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/3c/Birkeland-currents.gif/300px-Birkeland-currents.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/79/Magnetic_rope.png/300px-Magnetic_rope.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["aurora","astronomy"],["double_layer","plasma"],["sydney_chapman","astronomer"],["list_of_plasma","physics_articles"]],"members":["list_of_plasma","sydney_chapman","double_layer","aurora"],"related":["Magnetosphere","Ionosphere","Solar_wind","Interplanetary_magnetic_field","Substorm","Aurora_(astronomy)","Electrojet","Kristian_Birkeland","Arctic_Circle","Anders_Celsius","Olof_Hjorter","Solar_wind","Carl-Gunne_Fälthammar","Waves_in_plasmas","Instability","Plasma_acceleration","Terrella","Ampere","Joule_heating","Terawatt","Pulsed_power","Vortices","Diocotron_instability","Kelvin-Helmholtz_instability","Z-pinch","Ampère's_force_law","Double_layer_(plasma)","Bennett_pinch","Synchrotron_radiation","Radio","Optical","X-rays","Gamma_rays","Sydney_Chapman_(astronomer)","Hannes_Alfvén","Magnetometer","Ionosphere","Electromagnetism","Magnetohydrodynamics","List_of_plasma_(physics)_articles","Springer_Science+Business_Media","Springer_Science+Business_Media"]}
