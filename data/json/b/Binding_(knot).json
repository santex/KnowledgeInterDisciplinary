'Knotted-ends\nknots' are held in place by the two ends of the line being knotted together.\n\nWhipping and seizing serve a similar function to binding knots, but are\nclassified differently since they contain many turns, like a lashing.\n\nThis is a list of binding knots. *Boa knot *Bottle sling *Constrictor knot\n*Corned beef knot *Granny knot *Ground-line hitch *Miller's knot *Packer's knot\n*Reef knot *Strangle knot *Surgeon's knot *Thief knot *Jamming knot *Sheet bend\n","linknr":275,"url":"Binding_(knot)","recorded":1362371623,"links":18,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Binding knots|","Scoutcraft"],"headings":["See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/12px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/People_icon.svg/16px-People_icon.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Knot","Friction","Whipping_knot","Seizing","Boa_knot","Bottle_sling","Constrictor_knot","Corned_beef_knot","Granny_knot","Ground-line_hitch","Miller's_knot","Packer's_knot","Reef_knot","Strangle_knot","Surgeon's_knot","Thief_knot","Jamming_knot","Sheet_bend","Knot","List_of_bend_knots","List_of_knots"]}
