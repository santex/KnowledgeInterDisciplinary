Before\nbecoming Secretary-General, Ban was a career diplomat in South Korea's Ministry\nof Foreign Affairs and in the United Nations. He entered diplomatic service the\nyear he graduated from university, accepting his first post in New Delhi, India.\nIn the foreign ministry, he established a reputation for modesty and competence.\n\nBan was the foreign minister of South Korea from January 2004 to November 2006.\nIn February 2006, he began to campaign for the office of Secretary-General. Ban\nwas initially considered to be a long shot for the office. As foreign minister\nof South Korea, however, he was able to travel to all of the countries that were\nmembers of the United Nations Security Council, a maneuver that turned him into\nthe front runner.\n\nOn 11 October 2006, he was elected to be the eighth Secretary-General by the\nUnited Nations General Assembly and officially succeeded Annan on 1 January\n2007. Ban has led several major reforms regarding peacekeeping and UN employment\npractices. Diplomatically, Ban has taken particularly strong views on Darfur,\nwhere he helped persuade Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir to allow peacekeeping\ntroops to enter Sudan; and on global warming, pressing the issue repeatedly with\nformer U.S. President George W. Bush. Ban has received strong criticism from\nOIOS, the UN internal audit unit, stating that the secretariat, under Ban's\nleadership, is \"drifting into irrelevance\".\n\nIn 2011, Ban ran unopposed for a second term as Secretary-General. On 21 June\n2011, he was unanimously re-elected by the General Assembly and therefore will\ncontinue to serve until 31 December 2016.\n","linknr":1152,"url":"Ban_Ki-moon","recorded":1362674552,"links":140,"instances":["british_diplomat","south_korea","algeria","kazakhstan","peru"],"pdf":["http://www.foreignpolicy.com/files/fp_uploaded_documents/100719_0_ahleniussummary.pdf","http://www.foreignpolicy.com/files/fp_uploaded_documents/100719_0_ahleniussummary.pdf","http://www.unsgselection.org/files/Economist_EnterMrBan_7Oct06.pdf","http://www.unsgselection.org/files/Economist_EnterMrBan_7Oct06.pdf","http://www.parlament.gv.at/PAKT/VHG/XXIV/AB/AB_10542/imfname_251156.pdf","http://www.parlament.gv.at/PAKT/VHG/XXIV/AB/AB_10542/imfname_251156.pdf"],"categories":["Ambassadors
