The amount and type of clothing worn depends on physical,\nsocial and geographic considerations. Some clothing types can be gender-\nspecific, although this does not apply to cross dressers.\n\nPhysically, clothing serves many purposes: it can serve as protection from the\nelements, and can enhance safety during hazardous activities such as hiking and\ncooking. It protects the wearer from rough surfaces, rash-causing plants, insect\nbites, splinters, thorns and prickles by providing a barrier between the skin\nand the environment. Clothes can insulate against cold or hot conditions.\nFurther, they can provide a hygienic barrier, keeping infectious and toxic\nmaterials away from the body. Clothing also provides protection from harmful UV\nradiation.\n",
