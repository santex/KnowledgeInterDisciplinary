By\ndefinition, when a medication is administered intravenously, its bioavailability\nis 100%. Griffin, J.P. The Textbook of Pharmaceutical Medicine (6th Ed.).\nNew Jersey: BMJ Books. ISBN 978-1-4051-8035-1 However, when a medication\nis administered via other routes (such as orally), its bioavailability generally\ndecreases (due to incomplete absorption and first-pass metabolism) or may vary\nfrom patient to patient. Bioavailability is one of the essential tools in\npharmacokinetics, as bioavailability must be considered when calculating dosages\nfor non-intravenous routes of administration.\n\nFor dietary supplements, herbs and other nutrients in which the route of\nadministration is nearly always oral, bioavailability generally designates\nsimply the quantity or fraction of the ingested dose that is\nabsorbed.\n\nBioavailability is defined slightly differently for drugs as opposed to dietary\nsupplements primarily due to the method of administration and Food and Drug\nAdministration regulations.\n\nBioaccessibility is a concept related to bioavailability in the context of\nbiodegradation and environmental pollution. A molecule (often a persistent\norganic pollutant) is said to be bioavailable when \"[it] is available to cross\nan organismâs [[cellular membrane]] from the environment, if the organism has\naccess to the chemical.\"\n","linknr":362,"url":"Bioavailability","recorded":1362503018,"links":41,"instances":["microbiology","medicine","biochemistry"],"pdf":["http://naturalmedicinejournal.net/pdf/NMJ_JAN10_NaPh.pdf","http://naturalmedicinejournal.net/pdf/NMJ_JAN10_NaPh.pdf"],"categories":["Pharmacokinetics","Medicinal chemistry"],"headings":["Definitions","Absolute bioavailability","Relative bioavailability and bioequivalence","Factors influencing bioavailability","Bioavailability of drugs versus dietary supplements","Nutritional science: reliable and universal bioavailability","Notes","See also","Footnotes","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/63/AUC_IVPO.svg/220px-AUC_IVPO.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/6/5/c/65cae8c6de6959917d6e7475814f6af2.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/6/b/f/6bfe23b14e4d7ca8e5775ee140b21b9b.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["dose","biochemistry"],["clearance","medicine"],["efflux","microbiology"]],"members":["efflux","clearance","dose"],"related":["Pharmacology","Dose_(biochemistry)","Systemic_circulation","Pharmacokinetics","Medication","Intravenous","Route_of_administration","First-pass_metabolism","Dietary_supplements","Dietary_supplements","Food_and_Drug_Administration","Biodegradation","Environmental_pollution","Molecule","Persistent_organic_pollutant","Area_under_curve","Intravenous","Route_of_administration","Per_os","Transdermal","Subcutaneous","Sublingual","Pharmacokinetic","Pharmacodynamics","Volume_of_distribution","Clearance_(medicine)","Bioequivalence","Confidence_interval","Hydrophobe","Acid_dissociation_constant","Solubility","Time_release_technology","Fasting","Circadian","Antacid","Grapefruit_juice","Pomello","Cranberry_juice","Brassica","Efflux_(microbiology)","P-glycoprotein","GI_tract","Enzyme","Phenytoin","CYP1A2","CYP2C9","CYP2C19","CYP3A4","Enzyme_inhibitor","Enterohepatic_circulation","Hepatic","Renal","Clinical_trial","Dose-response_relationship","Abbreviated_New_Drug_Application","Approved_Drug_Products_with_Therapeutic_Equivalence_Evaluations","ADME-Tox","Lipinski's_Rule_of_5","Biopharmaceutics_Classification_System","Caco-2"]}
