Invented in the 19th century, the process allowed rapid and\naccurate reproduction of documents used in construction and industry. The blue-\nprint process was characterized by light colored lines on a blue background,\na negative of the original. The process was unable to reproduce color or\nshades of grey.\n\nVarious base materials have been used for blueprints. Paper was a common choice;\nfor more durable prints linen was sometimes used, but with time, the linen\nprints would shrink slightly. To combat this problem, printing on imitation\nvellum and, later, polyester film (Mylar) was implemented.\n\nThe process has been largely displaced by the diazo whiteprint process and by\nlarge-format xerographic photocopiers, so reproduced drawings are usually called\n\"prints\" or just \"drawings\".\n",
