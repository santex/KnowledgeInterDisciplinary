{"cursor":"16013","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nIn biochemistry, 'biotinylation' is the process of covalently attaching biotin\nto a protein, nucleic acid or other molecule. Biotinylation is rapid, specific\nand is unlikely to perturb the natural function of the molecule due to the small\nsize of biotin (MW = 244.31 g/mol). Biotin binds to streptavidin and avidin with\nan extremely high affinity, fast on-rate, and high specificity, and these\ninteractions are exploited in many areas of biotechnology to isolate\nbiotinylated molecules of interest. Biotin-binding to streptavidin and avidin is\nresistant to extremes of heat, pH and proteolysis, making capture of\nbiotinylated molecules possible in a wide variety of environments. Also,\nmultiple biotin molecules can be conjugated to a protein of interest, which\nallows binding of multiple streptavidin, avidin or Neutravidin protein molecules\nand increases the sensitivity of detection of the protein of interest. There is\na large number of biotinylation reagents available that exploit the wide range\nof possible labelling methods.\n","linknr":264,"url":"Biotinylation","recorded":1362503128,"links":23,"instances":["chemistry","buffer","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Biological processes"],"headings":["Labeling methods","Purpose","Other uses","Determining the extent of biotinylation","Further reading","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/Biotin_NHS_lysine_Reaction.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/99/Biotin_Maleimide_Cysteine_Reaction.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["dissolution","chemistry"],["cell","biology"],["mes","buffer"]],"members":["dissolution","mes","cell"],"related":["Biochemistry","Biotin","Streptavidin","Avidin","Molecules","Cross-link","Streptavidin","Avidin","Neutravidin","Polyethylene_glycol","Streptavidin","MHC_multimers","Protein","Epsilon-amine","Solubility","N-hydroxysuccinimide","Aqueous","Solution","Dissolution_(chemistry)","Organic_compound","Solvent","Chemical_reaction","Dimethyl_sulfoxide","Dimethyl_formamide","Cell_membrane","Cell_(biology)","Sulfonate","N-hydroxysuccinimide","Cell_membrane","Hydrolysis","PH","Half-life","Tris","Glycine","Thiol","Maleimide","Thiol","Peptides","Cysteine","Nucleotides","Carboxylic_acid","Carbodiimide","EDC","Tris","Glycine","Acetate","Citrate","MES_(buffer)","Glycoproteins","Carbohydrate","Aldehydes","Hydrazine","Sodium_periodate","Sialic_acids","Polyclonal_antibodies","Oligonucleotide","Oligonucleotide_synthesis","Ultraviolet_light","UV_light","Affinity_chromatography","Avidin","Streptavidin","Neutravidin","Iminobiotin","Antibody","Horseradish_peroxidase","Alkaline_phosphatase","Fluorophore","ELISA","ELISPOT","Western_blot","Non-covalent_bond","Covalent_bond","Affinity_chromatography","Red_blood_cells","Major_histocompatibility_complex","MHC_multimer","T-cell"]}
