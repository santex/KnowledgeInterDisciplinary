B. thuringiensis also occurs naturally\nin the gut of caterpillars of various types of moths and butterflies, as well on\nleaf surfaces, aquatic environments, animal feces, insect rich environments,\nflour mills and grain storage facilities. }}\n\nDuring sporulation, many Bt strains produce crystal proteins (proteinaceous\ninclusions), called Î´-endotoxins, that have insecticidal action. This has led to\ntheir use as insecticides, and more recently to genetically modified crops using\nBt genes. Many crystal-producing Bt strains, though, do not have insecticidal\nproperties.\n","linknr":572,"url":"Bt_toxin","recorded":1362503833,"links":43,"instances":["biology"],"pdf":["http://bipublication.com/files/IJABR-V3I4-2012-4.pdf","http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/ncmh/BGER/pdf/Volume%202/BGER2-12.pdf","http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/ncmh/BGER/pdf/Volume%202/BGER2-12.pdf","http://npic.orst.edu/factsheets/BTgen.pdf","http://npic.orst.edu/factsheets/BTtech.pdf"],"categories":["Bacillus|thuringiensis","Biopesticides","Genetically modified organisms in agriculture"],"headings":["Discovery and mechanism of insecticidal action","Use of spores and proteins in pest control","Use of Bt genes in genetic engineering of plants for pest control","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/Bt-toxin-crystals.jpg/300px-Bt-toxin-crystals.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5a/Copyright-problem_paste.svg/38px-Copyright-problem_paste.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1d/Bt_plants.png/220px-Bt_plants.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/Btcornafrica.jpg/220px-Btcornafrica.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/6c/Wiki_letter_w.svg/44px-Wiki_letter_w.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["strain","biology"]],"members":["strain"],"related":["Bacteria","Firmicutes","Bacilli","Bacillales","Bacillaceae","Gram-positive","Bacterium","Biological_pesticide","Caterpillar","Moth","Butterfly","Sporulation","Δ-endotoxins","Insecticidal","Genetically_modified_crops","Strain_(biology)","Biologist","Anthrax_disease","Plasmid","Aerobe","Endospore","Proteinaceous","Δ-endotoxin","Plasmid","Lepidoptera","Diptera","Coleoptera","Hymenoptera","Wasp","Bee","Ant","Sawfly","Nematode","Genetically_modified_food","Proteases","Insecticide","Pesticide","Environmentally_friendly","Human","Wildlife","Pollinator","Beneficial_insect","Organic_farming","Bacillus_thuringiensis_israelensis","Larvicide","Mosquito","Larva","Mosquito_control","Belgium","Plant_Genetic_Systems","Bayer_CropScience","Tobacco","Lesser_Cornstalk_Borer","Larva","Environmental_Protection_Agency","Genetically_modified_crops","Monsanto","Pink_bollworm","Gujarat","Mirids","Mealy_bugs","Monarch_butterfly","Anther","Colony_collapse_disorder","Honey_bee","Mid-Atlantic_Apiculture_Research_and_Extension_Consortium","Biological_insecticides","Western_corn_rootworm","Genetically_modified_food","Natural_Resources_Canada"]}
