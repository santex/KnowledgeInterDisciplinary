{"cursor":"44232","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n, Spain. The furnace itself is inside the central girderwork.]]\n\nA 'blast furnace' is a type of metallurgical furnace used for smelting to\nproduce industrial metals, generally iron.\n\nIn a blast furnace, fuel, ore, and flux (limestone) are continuously supplied\nthrough the top of the furnace, while air (sometimes with oxygen enrichment) is\nblown into the lower section of the furnace, so that the chemical reactions take\nplace throughout the furnace as the material moves downward. The end products\nare usually molten metal and slag phases tapped from the bottom, and flue gases\nexiting from the top of the furnace. The downward flow of the ore and flux in\ncontact with an upflow of hot, carbon monoxide-rich combustion gases is a\ncountercurrent exchange process.\n\nIn contrast, air furnaces (such as reverberatory furnaces), are naturally\naspirated, usually by the convection of hot gases in a chimney flue. According\nto this broad definition, bloomeries for iron, blowing houses for tin, and smelt\nmills for lead would be classified as blast furnaces. However, the term has\nusually been limited to those used for smelting iron ore to produce pig iron, an\nintermediate material used in the production of commercial iron and steel.\n","linknr":680,"url":"Blast_furnace","recorded":1362672359,"links":74,"instances":["province","historiography","container","steelmaking_process","fuel","metallurgy","official","province"],"pdf":["http://web.archive.org/web/20090305185028/http://www2.sea.siemens.com/NR/rdonlyres/FFA8AF1C-1791-46E8-AA09-917BB28D8701/0/038.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20090305185028/http://www2.sea.siemens.com/NR/rdonlyres/FFA8AF1C-1791-46E8-AA09-917BB28D8701/0/038.pdf"],"categories":["Blast
