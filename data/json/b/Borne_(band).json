The band's debut onto the world digital stage was remarkable, soaring\ninto chart high-points globally and resting at No. 13 in the US Billboard\ndigital charts.  The band was last-minute inclusion at\nthe 2007 South by Southwest Festival, in Austin, Texas, an annual event where\nhundreds of musical acts from across the globe are showcased.\n\nIn 2006, one of the band's songs, Don't Go Now was featured during evictions on\nthe Australian version of Big Brother. In the United States, The Guide was\nfeatured in the hit television program, Friday Night Lights.\n\nThe band made 2007 its year of recognition in its own back yard, Australia.\nBorne raised eyebrows in the Australian music industry when it was promoted to\nthe high ground of international recognition at the UK's big festivals; Hyde\nPark Calling  and Glastonbury. It put the seal on 2007 when from 5000 entrants Borne\ntook out the four most coveted awards at the MusicOz Awards 2007, the annual\nshowcase event for independent Australian musicians. Borne won the Nova\nInitiative award, its lead singer Cameron Tapp also received the award for best\nsinger/songwriter. The band also won the Garth Porter Award and the major award,\nArtist Of The Year. Further international recognition of\nthe band and its lyrical appeal to network television audiences came with the\ninclusion of \"Don't Go Now\" in the US, ABC super-series 'October Road'.\n\nAs of 2007, the members of Borne are:\n* Cameron Tapp- lead vocals and guitar;\n* Steve Kucina- vocals and guitar\n* Pete McDonald- drums\n* Scott Thornburn- bass guitar\n\nIn 2009, \"The Guide\" (from the album Loss of Signal) was featured on an\nAustralian advertisement for Pedigree's Adoption Drive.\n","linknr":138,"url":"Borne_(band)","recorded":1374525254,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Borne_(band)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Borne_(band)&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Melbourne","/wiki/Australia","/wiki/Music_genre","/wiki/Rock_music","/wiki/Record_label","/w/index.php?title=Medici_Studios&action=edit&redlink=1","http://www.bornemusic.com/","/wiki/Australia","/wiki/Melbourne,_Australia","/wiki/ITunes_Store","#cite_note-Billboard-1","/wiki/South_by_Southwest","/wiki/Austin,_Texas","#cite_note-SXSW-2","/wiki/Friday_Night_Lights_(TV_series)","#cite_note-NBC-3","#cite_note-HydePark-4","#cite_note-Glastonbury-5","#cite_note-MusicOz-6","#cite_note-OctoberRoad-7","/wiki/Loss_of_Signal","/wiki/Pedigree_Petfoods","/w/index.php?title=Borne_(band)&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Fargo,_North_Dakota","/wiki/ITunes","#cite_note-ABCAu-8","/w/index.php?title=Borne_(band)&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-Billboard_1-0","http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/esearch/searchResult.jsp?configType=BBCOM_SIMPLEDEFAULT&pubList=Billboard&an=bbcom&action=Submit&kw=&exposeNavigation=true&keyword=Borne&submit.x=0&submit.y=0&submit=Submit&searchType=ARTICLE_SEARCH","/wiki/Billboard.com","/wiki/Wikipedia:Link_rot","#cite_ref-SXSW_2-0","http://2007.sxsw.com/music/showcases/alpha/0.html","/w/index.php?title=Sxsw.com&action=edit&redlink=1","#cite_ref-NBC_3-0","http://www.nbc.com/Featured_Music","/wiki/NBC","#cite_ref-HydePark_4-0","http://www.efestivals.co.uk/news/070417b.shtml","/w/index.php?title=Esfestivals.co.uk&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Wikipedia:Link_rot","#cite_ref-Glastonbury_5-0","http://www.glastonburyfestivals.co.uk/performance.aspx?id=196","/w/index.php?title=Glastonburyfestivals.co.uk&action=edit&redlink=1","#cite_ref-MusicOz_6-0","http://www.musicoz.org/about/2007_Musicoz_Winners/2007_Musicoz_Winners/","/w/index.php?title=Musicoz.org&action=edit&redlink=1","#cite_ref-OctoberRoad_7-0","http://www.tv.com/october-road/the-infidelity-tour/episode/1128749/summary.html","/wiki/Tv.com","#cite_ref-ABCAu_8-0","http://www.abc.net.au/rn/breakfast/stories/2008/2275415.htm","/wiki/Abc.net.au","/w/index.php?title=Borne_(band)&action=edit&section=3","http://www.bornemusic.com","http://myspace.com/borneaustralia","/wiki/Template:Borne","/w/index.php?title=Template_talk:Borne&action=edit&redlink=1","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Borne&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Cameron_Tapp&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Steve_Kucina&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Pete_McDonald&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Scott_Thornburn&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Loss_of_Signal","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Borne_(band)&oldid=548546118","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Australian_alternative_rock_groups","/wiki/Category:All_articles_with_dead_external_links","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_dead_external_links_from_October_2010","/wiki/Category:Use_dmy_dates_from_July_2011","/wiki/Category:Use_Australian_English_from_July_2011","/wiki/Category:All_Wikipedia_articles_written_in_Australian_English","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_hCards","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Borne+%28band%29&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Borne+%28band%29","/wiki/Borne_(band)","/wiki/Talk:Borne_(band)","#","/wiki/Borne_(band)","/w/index.php?title=Borne_(band)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Borne_(band)&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Borne_(band)","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Borne_(band)","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special
