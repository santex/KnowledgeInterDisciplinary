Scott SA, Davey MP,\n Dennis JS, Horst I, Howe CJ, Lea-Smith DJ, Smith AG. 2010. Biodiesel from\n algae: challenges and prospects. Current Opinion in Biotechnology. 21(3):277-\n 86 Several companies and government agencies are funding efforts to\n reduce capital and operating costs and make algae fuel production commercially\n viable. Harvested algae, like fossil fuel, release when burnt but\n unlike fossil fuel the is taken out of the atmosphere by the growing of algae\n and other biofuel sources, and the world food crisis, have ignited interest in\n algaculture (farming algae) for making vegetable oil, biodiesel, bioethanol,\n biogasoline, biomethanol, biobutanol and other biofuels, using land that is not\n suitable for agriculture. Among algal fuels' attractive characteristics: they\n can be grown with minimal impact on fresh water resources, can be produced using ocean and wastewater, and are\n biodegradable and relatively harmless to the environment if\n spilled. [http://www.friendsofethanol.com/facts.html Friends of\n Ethanol.com biodegradable ethanol] Algae cost more per unit\n mass (as of 2010, food grade algae costs ~$5000/tonne), due to high capital and\n operating costs, yet are claimed to yield between 10 and 100 times\n more fuel per unit area than other second-generation biofuel\n crops. Greenwell et al (2010)\n [http://rsif.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/7/46/703.full Placing\n microalgae on the biofuels priority list: a review of the technological\n challenges] J. R. Soc. Interface 6 May 2010 vol. 7 no. 46 703â726 The\n United States Department of Energy estimates that if algae fuel replaced all\n the petroleum fuel in the United States, it would require which is only 0.42%\n of the U.S. map, or about half of the land area of\n Maine. This is less than the area of corn harvested in the United States in\n 2000. However, these claims remain unrealized commercially.\n According to the head of the Algal Biomass Organization algae fuel can reach\n price parity with oil in 2018 if granted production tax credits.\n","linknr":996,"url":"Biofuel_from_algae","recorded":1362500511,"links":61,"instances":["renewable_and_sustainable_energy","sonora"],"pdf":["http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/pubfiles/adt-MU20050901.140745/02Whole.pdf","http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/pubfiles/adt-MU20050901.140745/02Whole.pdf","http://www.eere.energy.gov/biomass/pdfs/biodiesel_from_algae.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20060926045050/http://www1.eere.energy.gov/biomass/pdfs/biodiesel_from_algae.pdf","http://www.eere.energy.gov/biomass/pdfs/biodiesel_from_algae.pdf","http://www.pir.sa.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/77055/microalgal_prod.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20081217093711/http://www.pir.sa.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/77055/microalgal_prod.pdf","http://www.pir.sa.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/77055/microalgal_prod.pdf","http://www.epa.gov/air/caaac/mstrs/March2007/Wolf.pdf","http://www.ascension-publishing.com/BIZ/HD50.pdf","http://www.ascension-publishing.com/BIZ/HD50.pdf","http://www.greenfuelonline.com/gf_files/GreenFuel%20Growth%20Rates.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20080521161721/http://www.greenfuelonline.com/gf_files/GreenFuel%20Growth%20Rates.pdf","http://www.greenfuelonline.com/gf_files/GreenFuel%20Growth%20Rates.pdf","http://www.unapcaem.org/publication/bioenergy.pdf","http://www.netl.doe.gov/publications/proceedings/03/carbon-seq/PDFs/158.pdf","http://www.zeitmop.de/pdf/TOWARD_A_LIFE_SEA_NEAR_THE_DEAD_ONE.pdf","http://www.biodiesel.org/resources/sustainability/pdfs/Food%20and%20FuelApril162008.pdf","http://www.nanostring.net/Algae/CaseStudy.pdf","http://www.nanostring.net/Algae/CaseStudy.pdf","http://www.carbontrust.co.uk/NR/rdonlyres/62511FB9-A701-48F4-BDA2-5ADD41CEDC27/0/FAQs.pdf","http://www.carbontrust.co.uk/NR/rdonlyres/62511FB9-A701-48F4-BDA2-5ADD41CEDC27/0/FAQs.pdf","http://www1.eere.energy.gov/biomass/pdfs/ibr_arra_solazyme.pdf","http://www1.eere.energy.gov/biomass/pdfs/ibr_arra_solazyme.pdf","http://www.engr.psu.edu/ce/enve/logan/publications/2009-Cheng-etal-ES&T.pdf","http://openwetware.org/images/2/2e/09-Microalgal_Biomass_Production_Chinnasamy.pdf","http://www.nrel.gov/biomass/pdfs/benemann.pdf","http://www.oilgae.com/ref/report/Report_Sample.pdf"],"categories":["Algae
