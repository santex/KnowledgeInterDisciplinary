{"cursor":"3690","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The 'British Columbia Social Constructive Party' (also known as the 'Social\nConstructives' and the 'B.C. Reconstructive Party') was formed in 1936 by a\nbreakaway from the British Columbia Co-operative Commonwealth Federation after\nReverend Robert Connell was expelled from the party over doctrinal differences.\nConnell had been leader of the CCF until his expulsion. Three other MLAs of the\nseven person CCF caucus, Jack Price, R.B. Swailes and Ernest Bakewell, left the\nparty and joined Connell to form the Social Constructives. The four member\ncaucus, having one more MLA than the CCF, was large enough to allow Connell to\nremain Leader of the Opposition in the British Columbia Legislative Assembly.\nOther defectors included Victor Midgely, former leader of the One Big Union, and\nBill Pritchard, editor and owner of the BC CCF's newspaper, The\nCommonwealth. Price, Christine,\n[http://ir.lib.sfu.ca/retrieve/3732/etd2380.pdf \"A Very Conservative Radical\":\nReverend Robert Connell's encounter with Marxism in the BC CCF], Simon Fraser\nUniversity MA Thesis, 2006 The party worked closely with Rolf Wallgren\nBruhn an Independent MLA who had formerly been a Conservative. Bruhn helped\nwrite the new party's platform and conducted a speaking tour with Connell during\nthe 1937 general election but declined to join the party and stood for re-\nelection as an Independent [http://www.livinglandscapes.bc.ca/thomp-ok/rolf/rolf-\nwallgreen.html Rolf Wallgren Bruhn, Pioneer and Politician] though with\nthe Constructives' endorsement.

The new party lacked\nthe organizational strength of either the CCF or the Liberals and was unable to\nfield candidates in even one-third of the province's electoral districts. The\nparty also refused to hold nominating conventions for candidates in order to\nprevent groups from taking over the party. Instead, individuals were invited to\nstand as candidates and then appointed. In the context of the\nGreat Depression, the party's platform of moderate reformism proved unable to\ndistinguish itself from a Liberal Party that was leaning left and using the\nslogan of \"socialized capitalism\".\n\nThe \"Social Constructives\" stood 14 candidates (out of a possible 48) in the\n1937 general election but failed to win any seats. The party received 8,086\nvotes to the CCF's 119,400. Disappointed with the results,\nConnell came to the conclusion that change was not possible through a third\nparty but only through working within mainstream parties.\n","linknr":105,"url":"British_Columbia_Social_Constructive_Party","recorded":1375075448,"links":["/w/index.php?title=British_Columbia_Social_Constructive_Party&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=British_Columbia_Social_Constructive_Party&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/British_Columbia_New_Democratic_Party","/wiki/Robert_Connell","/wiki/Caucus","/wiki/Robert_Blatchford_Swailes","/wiki/Ernest_Bakewell","/wiki/Leader_of_the_Opposition_(British_Columbia)","/wiki/British_Columbia_Legislative_Assembly","/wiki/One_Big_Union_(Canada)","/wiki/William_Arthur_Pritchard","#cite_note-price-1","/wiki/Rolf_Wallgren_Bruhn","/wiki/British_Columbia_general_election,_1937","#cite_note-2","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Socialism","/wiki/Liberal_Party_of_British_Columbia","#cite_note-price-1","/wiki/Great_Depression","/wiki/Reformism","#cite_note-price-1","/wiki/British_Columbia_general_election,_1937","#cite_note-price-1","/wiki/Third_party_(politics)","/w/index.php?title=British_Columbia_Social_Constructive_Party&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-price_1-0","#cite_ref-price_1-1","#cite_ref-price_1-2","#cite_ref-price_1-3","http://ir.lib.sfu.ca/retrieve/3732/etd2380.pdf","#cite_ref-2","http://www.livinglandscapes.bc.ca/thomp-ok/rolf/rolf-wallgreen.html","#cite_ref-3","http://www.elections.bc.ca/elections/electoral_history/19ge1937-2.html#2","/w/index.php?title=British_Columbia_Social_Constructive_Party&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/League_for_Social_Reconstruction","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=British_Columbia_Social_Constructive_Party&oldid=559696054","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Political_parties_established_in_1935","/wiki/Category:Defunct_political_parties_in_Canada","/wiki/Category:Provincial_political_parties_in_British_Columbia","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=British+Columbia+Social+Constructive+Party&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=British+Columbia+Social+Constructive+Party","/wiki/British_Columbia_Social_Constructive_Party","/wiki/Talk:British_Columbia_Social_Constructive_Party","#","/wiki/British_Columbia_Social_Constructive_Party","/w/index.php?title=British_Columbia_Social_Constructive_Party&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=British_Columbia_Social_Constructive_Party&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/British_Columbia_Social_Constructive_Party","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/British_Columbia_Social_Constructive_Party","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=British_Columbia_Social_Constructive_Party&oldid=559696054","/w/index.php?title=British_Columbia_Social_Constructive_Party&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4969766","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=British_Columbia_Social_Constructive_Party&id=559696054","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=British+Columbia+Social+Constructive+Party","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=British+Columbia+Social+Constructive+Party&oldid=559696054&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=British_Columbia_Social_Constructive_Party&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4969766#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wi
