Every element of one set is paired with exactly one element of the\nother set, and every element of the other set is paired with exactly one\nelement of the first set. There are no unpaired elements. In formal\nmathematical terms, a bijective function f: X → Y is a one to one and onto\nmapping of a set X to a set Y.\n\nA bijection from the set X to the set Y has an inverse function from Y to X. If\nX and Y are finite sets, then the existence of a bijection means they have the\nsame number of elements. For infinite sets the picture is more complicated,\nleading to the concept of cardinal number, a way to distinguish the various\nsizes of infinite sets.\n\nA bijective function from a set to itself is also called a [[permutation]].\n\nBijective functions are essential to many areas of mathematics including the\ndefinitions of isomorphism, homeomorphism, diffeomorphism, permutation group,\nand projective map.\n","title":"bijection","headings":["Definition","Examples","More mathematical examples and some non-examples","Inverses","Composition","Bijections and cardinality","Properties","Bijections and category theory","Contrast with","See also","Notes","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["3: Finite_set","3: Surjective_function","3: Injective_function","2: Inverse_function","2: Infinite_set","2: Cardinal_number","2: Isomorphism","2: Domain_of_a_function","2: Symmetric_group","2: Category_theory","1: Homeomorphism","1: Diffeomorphism","1: Permutation_group","1: Projective_map","1: One-to-one_function","1: Baseball","1: Identity_function","1: Linear_function","1: Codomain","1: Exponential_function","1: Natural_logarithm","1: Inverse_relation","1: Invertible_function","1: Iff","1: Axiomatic_set_theory","1: Equinumerosity","1: Graph_of_a_function","1: Factorial","1: Cardinalities","1: Surjection","1: Total_ordering","1: Permutation","1: Homomorphism","1: Multivalued_function","1: Bijection,_injection_and_surjection","1: Bijective_numeration","1: Bijective_proof","1: Cardinality","1: AxâGrothendieck_theorem"]}
