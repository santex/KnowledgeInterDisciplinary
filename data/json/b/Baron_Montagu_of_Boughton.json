{"cursor":"4067","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The title of 'Baron Montagu of Boughton' was first created in 1621, in the\nPeerage of England, for Sir Edward Montagu, eldest son of Sir Edward Montagu of\nBoughton and grandson of another Sir Edward Montagu who had been Lord Chief\nJustice during the reign of Henry VIII. He was also the brother of Henry Montagu\n(later created Earl of Manchester).\n\nTheir ancestor was one Richard Ladde, grandfather of the Lord Chief Justice Sir\nEdward, who changed his name to Montagu in about 1447. His descendants claimed a\nconnection with the older house of Montagu or Montacute, Barons Montagu and\nEarls of Salisbury, but there is no sound evidence that the two families were\nrelated. A case has been made out for the possibility that the Ladde alias came\nfrom a division among coheirs about 1420 of the remaining small inheritance of a\nline of Montagus at Spratton and Little Creton, also in Northamptonshire\n(Sources:English Genealogy, Anthony Wagner).\n\nThe third Baron Montagu of Boughton was created Earl of Montagu and Viscount\nMonthermer in 1689 and Duke of Montagu and Marquess of Monthermer in 1705. He\nhad married in 1675 the Lady Elizabeth Wriothesley, daughter of the 4th Earl of\nSouthampton and a descendant of the original houses of Montagu and Monthermer.\nThe Dukedom, Earldom and Barony of Montagu all became extinct on the death of\ntheir son John, 2nd Duke of Montagu, in 1749. The next creation was in 1762, in\nthe Peerage of Great Britain. John Montagu, styled Lord Brudenell, son of the\n4th Earl of Cardigan and maternal grandson of the last Duke of Montagu, was\ncreated 'Baron Montagu of Boughton' in 1762. This title became extinct on his\ndeath without issue in 1770.\n\nThe next creation was for the late Baron's father, who had been created Duke of\nMontagu in 1766. He was created 'Baron Montagu of Boughton', again in the\nPeerage of Great Britain, in 1786. On his death in 1790, when the Dukedom became\nextinct, the Barony passed under a special remainder to his female-line grandson\nLord Henry Scott, second son of the 3rd Duke of Buccleuch. Lord Henry Scott also\ninherited the Lordship of Bowland from his mother, the Duchess, having the title\nentailed upon him by his nephew, the 5th Duke, in 1827. He died in 1845\nwhereupon the title of 'Montagu of Boughton' became extinct.\n\nHis great-nephew Lord Henry Douglas-Scott-Montagu, second son of the 5th Duke of\nBuccleuch, was created Baron Montagu of Beaulieu in 1885 (see that title).\n","linknr":115,"url":"Baron_Montagu_of_Boughton","recorded":1374781164,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Baron_Montagu_of_Boughton&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Baron_Montagu_of_Boughton&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Peerage_of_England","/wiki/Edward_Montagu,_1st_Baron_Montagu_of_Boughton","/wiki/Edward_Montagu_of_Boughton","/wiki/Edward_Montagu_(judge)","/wiki/Lord_Chief_Justice","/wiki/Henry_VIII_of_England","/wiki/Henry_Montagu,_1st_Earl_of_Manchester","/wiki/Earl_of_Manchester","/w/index.php?title=Richard_Ladde&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Lord_Chief_Justice","/wiki/Montagu","/wiki/Baron_Montagu","/wiki/Earl_of_Salisbury","/wiki/Earl_of_Montagu","/wiki/Viscount_Monthermer","/wiki/Duke_of_Montagu","/wiki/Marquess_of_Monthermer","/wiki/Elizabeth_Wriothesley","/wiki/Thomas_Wriothesley,_4th_Earl_of_Southampton","/wiki/Peerage_of_Great_Britain","/wiki/Earl_of_Cardigan","/wiki/Henry_Scott,_3rd_Duke_of_Buccleuch","/wiki/Lordship_of_Bowland","/wiki/Henry_John_Douglas-Scott-Montagu,_1st_Baron_Montagu_of_Beaulieu","/wiki/Walter_Francis_Montagu-Douglas-Scott,_5th_Duke_of_Buccleuch","/wiki/Baron_Montagu_of_Beaulieu","#Barons_Montagu_of_Boughton.2C_first_creation_.281621.29","#Barons_Montagu_of_Boughton.2C_second_creation_.281762.29","#Barons_Montagu_of_Boughton.2C_third_creation_.281786.29","#See_also","/w/index.php?title=Baron_Montagu_of_Boughton&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Edward_Montagu,_1st_Baron_Montagu_of_Boughton","/wiki/Edward_Montagu,_2nd_Baron_Montagu_of_Boughton","/wiki/Ralph_Montagu,_1st_Duke_of_Montagu","/wiki/John_Montagu,_2nd_Duke_of_Montagu","/w/index.php?title=Baron_Montagu_of_Boughton&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/John_Montagu,_1st_Baron_Montagu_of_Boughton","/w/index.php?title=Baron_Montagu_of_Boughton&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/George_Montagu,_1st_Duke_of_Montagu","/w/index.php?title=Henry_Montagu-Scott,_2nd_Baron_Montagu_of_Boughton&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Baron_Montagu_of_Boughton&action=edit&section=4","/wiki/Baron_Montagu","/wiki/Baron_Montagu_of_Beaulieu","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Baron_Montagu_of_Boughton&oldid=552015004","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Baronies_in_the_Peerage_of_Great_Britain","/wiki/Category:Extinct_baronies_in_the_Peerage_of_Great_Britain","/wiki/Category:1621_establishments","/wiki/Category:Montagu_family","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Baron+Montagu+of+Boughton&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Baron+Montagu+of+Boughton","/wiki/Baron_Montagu_of_Boughton","/wiki/Talk:Baron_Montagu_of_Boughton","#","/wiki/Baron_Montagu_of_Boughton","/w/index.php?title=Baron_Montagu_of_Boughton&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Baron_Montagu_of_Boughton&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Baron_Montagu_of_Boughton","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Baron_Montagu_of_Boughton","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Baron_Montagu_of_Boughton&oldid=552015004","/w/index.php?title=Baron_Montagu_of_Boughton&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4862637","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Baron_Montagu_of_Boughton&id=552015004","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Baron+Montagu+of+Boughton","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Baron+Montagu+of+Boughton&oldid=552015004&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Baron_Montagu_of_Boughton&printable=yes","//pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baron_Montagu_of_Boughton","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4862637#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Te
