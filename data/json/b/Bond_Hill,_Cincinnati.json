It is one of a number of\nneighborhoods lining the Mill Creek, an urban stream in southwestern Ohio. Bond\nHill began as a commuter suburb connected to Cincinnati via the Marietta-\nCincinnati Railroad. Bond Hill incorporated as the Village of Bond Hill in\n1886 and the small village of about 1000 persons was\nannexed into Cincinnati in 1903. Many new homes were added east of\nthe original settlement in the 1930s. Beginning in the 1960s, redlining by the\nFederal Housing Authority and blockbusting by Hamilton County realtors swiftly\nchanged the demographic makeup of the community. The first black family moved to\nBond Hill in 1964, but due to these practices, by 1978 nearly 70% of the\ncommunity was black. By 2000, less than 7% of Bond Hill residents were white.\n\nBond Hill was originally founded by a cooperative building association, the\nCooperative Land and Building Association No.1 of Hamilton County,\nOhio, the first post-Civil War housing cooperative in Cincinnati and\nthe first building association to be organized along idealistic and not ethnic\nlines. The cooperative was organized in 1870 by five men including several\nteetotallers from nearby Cumminsville. The cooperative initially planned on\nbuilding in Cumminsville but for unknown reasons, the young co-op changed the\nsite of their development to the area they renamed Bond Hill. The change was\nlikely stimulated by a founding member of the cooperative, Henry Watkin. Watkin\nhad been living in the area with his wife, Laura Ann Fry Watkin and their child,\nEffie Maud, since 1860. A utopian communalist and expatriat English printer,\nWatkin attained some renown as the adopted father and mentor of the once famous\nwriter, Lafcadio Hearn. Henry Watkin's wife, Laura Ann Fry Watkin, was the\ndaughter of the master artist, woodcarver, vegetarian, and religious communist\nHenry Fry. Early members of the cooperative included artist friends of Henry\nFry: Emma Bepler and her father August Bepler.\n\nFor at least 11 years after its founding in 1870, the sale of liquor was\nprohibited in Bond Hill according to the Constitution and By-Laws of the\nCooperative. In the early 1880s, a disagreement centered around Bond Hill's\nchurch, considered by some to be the cooperative's non-denominational church and\nby others to be Presbyterian, likely caused a schism within the early community\nand the cooperative. The role of Watkin and the early founders in the leadership\nof the community seems to have ebbed after this schism.\n\nThe origin of the name Bond Hill remains something of a mystery. Newspaper\narticles documenting the founding and naming of the railroad suburb by the\ncooperative indicate that Bond Hill was the name of the area in the 1830s: \"This\nwas the name of that particular locality forty years ago, and carries with it\nassociations not easily forgotten by the oldest inhabitants,\" (January 10, 1871,\n[[Cincinnati Daily Enquirer]]). An oral history transcribed in 1961 by George E.\nPatmor, one of the village's earliest residents, indicates that the name was\nfirst given by visitors to a sawmill operated by a man named Bond: \"In these\ndays the people of St. Bernard and Cincinnati would use a footpath through the\nwoods 'for a shortcut from St. Bernard to Bondâs sawmill to work or transact\nbusiness.' It got to be a common saying that they were going up on Bond Hill, so\nthis is how we got the name 'Bond Hill'.\" Local historian, Aharon Varady,\nspeculates that like other mills in upper Millcreek Township, Bond's Mill may\nhave been a gathering site for gambling and traveling teamstersâassociations\nwhich nearby residents may have wished to be forgotten.\n\nUntil the mid-1930s, Bond Hill was largely rural and surrounded by orchards and\ndairy farms. New parkways, such as Bloody Run (later Victory) Parkway offered\nCincinnatians a destination to picnic in Bond Hill meadows on weekends. Even\nearlier, while the Miami-Erie Canal still flowed to the west of the\nneighborhood, parties traveled up the canal towpath to recreation open spaces in\nan area called Ludlow Grove area between St. Bernard and Bond Hill. (Today,\nportions of Ludlow Grove exist as parks within developed portions of St.\nBernard.) Residential developments replaced the dairy farms in the east of Bond\nHill. Industrial facilities replaced the orchards in the south and the\nartificial lakes in the east. In the north, a regional high school and a large\n4,400 car parking lot and shopping complex were built in the 1950s. Community\nresidents opposed these intrusions but were largely ignored. Perhaps the most\nradical change in the neighborhood was the construction of the Interstate 75\nMillcreek Expressway over the length of the canal in western Bond Hill and the\nNorwood Lateral (State Route 562) extension in southern Bond Hill. By their\ncompletion in the early 1960s the rural character of the neighborhood had been\nfundamentally altered.\n\nThe environmental degradation and urbanization of the neighborhood presaged the\nexit of whites from Bond Hill in the 1960s and '70s. Realtors and local banks\nactively encouraged the demographic transition of the neighborhood through\nredlining, blockbusting, and racial steering. The Bond Hill-Roselawn Community\nCouncil was founded in 1965 to combat this change. Throughout the next twenty\nyears the Bond Hill Community Council struggled to develop a community plan and\nto stabilize white flight. Their achievements included the creation of a Bond\nHill Community Master Plan in 1977 and the recognition of the \"Old Bond Hill\nVillage\" Historic District in 1982. However, the demographic shift never abated,\nand today (2004) Bond Hill is nearly as segregated a black community as it once\nwas a white one a half-century earlier.\n","linknr":290,"url":"Bond_Hill,_Cincinnati","recorded":1375066546,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Bond_Hill,_Cincinnati&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Bond_Hill,_Cincinnati&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Cincinnati,_OH","/wiki/File:Bond-Hill-Cincinnati-map.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/Bond-Hill-Cincinnati-map.jpg/250px-Bond-Hill-Cincinnati-map.jpg","/wiki/Cincinnati,_OH","/wiki/Temperance_movement","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Millcreek_Township,_Hamilton_County,_Ohio","/wiki/Hamilton_County,_Ohio","/wiki/Neighborhood","/wiki/Cincinnati","/wiki/Mill_Creek_(Ohio)","/wiki/Urban_stream","/wiki/Ohio","#cite_note-2","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Redlining","/wiki/Blockbusting","/wiki/Cooperative","#cite_note-4","/wiki/Teetotalism","/wiki/Henry_Watkin","/wiki/Lafcadio_Hearn","/wiki/Religious_communism","/wiki/Henry_Fry","//toolserver.org/%7Edispenser/cgi-bin/dab_solver.py?page=Bond_Hill,_Cincinnati&editintro=Template:Disambiguation_needed/editintro&client=Template:Dn","/wiki/Presbyterian","/wiki/Cincinnati_Daily_Enquirer","/wiki/St._Bernard,_Ohio","/wiki/Miami_and_Erie_Canal","/wiki/Interstate_75_Millcreek_Expressway","/wiki/Ohio_State_Highway_562","/wiki/Demographic_transition","/wiki/Redlining","/wiki/Blockbusting","/wiki/Racial_steering","/wiki/Roselawn,_Cincinnati,_Ohio","/wiki/White_flight","/w/index.php?title=Bond_Hill,_Cincinnati&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","http://books.google.com/books?id=gEwRAQAAMAAJ&dq=steven%20rolfes&pg=PA17#v=onepage&q&f=false","#cite_ref-2","http://books.google.com/books?id=US8WAAAAYAAJ&lpg=PA23&ots=e7V6Cg-yFX&dq=Its%20cost%20exclusive%20of%20right%20of%20way%20was%20%24811%2C683.&pg=PA214#v=onepage&q=Its%20cost%20exclusive%20of%20right%20of%20way%20was%20$811,683.&f=false","#cite_ref-3","http://books.google.com/books?id=-hB6AAAAMAAJ&dq=cincinnati%20the%20queen%20city%20clarke&pg=PA528#v=onepage&q=cincinnati%20the%20queen%20city%20clarke&f=false","#cite_ref-4","http://books.google.com/books?id=-hB6AAAAMAAJ&dq=cincinnati%20the%20queen%20city%20clarke&pg=PA531#v=onepage&q=cincinnati%20the%20queen%20city%20clarke&f=false","/w/index.php?title=Bond_Hill,_Cincinnati&action=edit&section=2","http://books.google.com/books?id=fGjfLGwjTfcC&pg=PP1&dq=aharon+varady","http://phobos.simpletone.com/gallery/bond_hill","http://www.cincinnati-oh.gov/cdap/pages/-3716-/","/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system","//tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Bond_Hill,_Cincinnati&params=39_10_29_N_84_28_02_W_type:city_region:US-OH","/wiki/Template:Cincinnati","/wiki/Template_talk:Cincinnati","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Cincinnati&action=edit","/wiki/Cincinnati","/wiki/City_Council_of_Cincinnati,_Ohio_elections","/wiki/Crime_in_Cincinnati","/wiki/National_Register_of_Historic_Places_listings_in_Cincinnati,_Ohio","/wiki/Media_in_Cincinnati","/wiki/List_of_mayors_of_Cincinnati","/wiki/Cincinnati_%E2%80%93_Northern_Kentucky_metropolitan_area","/wiki/List_of_people_from_Cincinnati","/wiki/Cincinnati_Police_Department_(Ohio)","/wiki/List_of_tallest_buildings_in_Cincinnati","/wiki/Category:Neighborhoods_in_Cincinnati,_Ohio","/wiki/Avondale,_Cincinnati","/wiki/California,_Cincinnati","/wiki/Camp_Washington,_Cincinnati","/wiki/Carthage,_Cincinnati","/wiki/Clifton,_Cincinnati","/wiki/College_Hill,_Cincinnati","/wiki/Columbia-Tusculum,_Cincinnati","/wiki/Corryville,_Cincinnati","/wiki/CUF,_Cincinnati","/wiki/Downtown_Cincinnati","/wiki/East_End,_Cincinnati","/wiki/East_Walnut_Hills,_Cincinnati","/wiki/East_Westwood,_Cincinnati","/wiki/English_Woods,_Cincinnati","/wiki/Evanston,_Cincinnati","/wiki/Fay_Apartments,_Cincinnati","/wiki/Hartwell,_Cincinnati","/wiki/Hyde_Park,_Cincinnati","/wiki/Kennedy_Heights,_Cincinnati","/wiki/Linwood,_Cincinnati","/wiki/Madisonville,_Cincinnati","/wiki/Millvale,_Cincinnati","/wiki/Mount_Adams,_Cincinnati","/wiki/Mount_Airy,_Cincinnati","/wiki/Mount_Auburn_Historic_District","/wiki/Mount_Lookout,_Cincinnati","/wiki/Mount_Washington,_Cincinnati","/wiki/North_Avondale,_Cincinnati","/wiki/North_Fairmount,_Cincinnati","/wiki/Northside,_Cincinnati","/wiki/Oakley,_Cincinnati","/wiki/Over-the-Rhine","/wiki/Paddock_Hills,_Cincinnati","/wiki/Pendleton,_Cincinnati"
