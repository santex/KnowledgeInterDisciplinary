Not\nall films that fail to earn back their estimated costs during their theatrical\nruns are bombs, and the label is generally applied to\nfilms that miss earnings projections by a wide margin, particularly when they\nare very expensive to produce, and sometimes in conjunction with middling or\npoor reviews (though critical reception has nothing to do with box office performance). http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/as-battleship-flops-\nten-other-memorable-box-office-bombs-20120521\n","linknr":528,"url":"Box-office_bomb","recorded":1362485810,"links":22,"instances":["novel","film_series"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Film box office|Bomb","Film and video terminology"],"headings":["Possible success of flops","Studios pushed into financial ruin","Causes of a movie's failure","Examples","Independent films","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Ambox_globe_content.svg/48px-Ambox_globe_content.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["northern_lights","novel"],["ice_age","film_series"]],"members":["northern_lights","ice_age"],"related":["Film","Film_production","Film_distribution","Film_promotion","List_of_most_expensive_films","Television_syndication","Home_video","Pay-per-view","Revenue_stream","1968_in_film","The_Monkees","Columbia_Pictures","Cult_film","Rhino_Entertainment","DVD","Northern_Lights_(novel)","Philip_Pullman","Michael_Lynne","Action_movies","Romance_film","Blockbuster_motion_picture","Bankruptcy","RKO_Pictures","United_Artists","Carolco_Pictures","Fox_Animation_Studios","The_Ladd_Company","Fleischer_Studios","ITC_Entertainment","Warner_Bros.","New_Line_Cinema","Gold_Circle_Films","Walt_Disney_Pictures","Traditional_animation","Warner_Bros._Animation","The_Jim_Henson_Company","Jim_Henson","EM.TV","Square_Pictures","Word_of_mouth","Michael_Cimino","Cannes_Film_Festival","20th_Century_Fox","Warner_Bros.","Ice_Age_(film_series)","Turner_Entertainment","Time_Warner","Mike_Judge","Fox_News_Channel","World_War_I","D._W._Griffith","Metro-Goldwyn-Meyer","Walt_Disney","World_War_II","Disposable_income","Attack_on_Pearl_Harbor","September_11,_2001_attacks","Hurricanes","The_Walt_Disney_Company","Tom_Sizemore","Katherine_Heigl","Dallas,_Texas","Screen_Actors_Guild","The_Guardian","BBC","BBC","Total_Film","Genie_Award","Sarah_Polley","Brendan_Fletcher","Canadian_content","List_of_films_considered_the_worst"]}
