It is the medical removal of tissue from a living subject to\ndetermine the presence or extent of a disease. The tissue is generally\nexamined under a microscope by a pathologist, and can also be analyzed\nchemically. When an entire lump or suspicious area is removed, the procedure\nis called an excisional biopsy. When only a sample of tissue is removed with\npreservation of the histological architecture of the tissueâs cells, the\nprocedure is called an incisional biopsy or core biopsy. When a sample of\ntissue or fluid is removed with a needle in such a way that cells are removed\nwithout preserving the histological architecture of the tissue cells, the\nprocedure is called a needle aspiration biopsy.\n","linknr":277,"url":"biopsy","recorded":1362510636,"links":58,"instances":["anatomy","biology","biology","medicine","pathology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Biopsy","Pathology","Surgical procedures"],"headings":["Etymology","History","Conditions identified with biopsies","Biopsied sites","Analysis of biopsied material","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Brain_biopsy_under_stereotaxy.jpg/230px-Brain_biopsy_under_stereotaxy.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg/20px-Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/Biopsie_Lunge_Computertomographie_BC.png/220px-Biopsie_Lunge_Computertomographie_BC.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg/20px-Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["sampling","medicine"],["cell","biology"],["staging","pathology"],["colon","anatomy"],["tissue","biology"],["cell","biology"]],"members":["colon","tissue","cell","sampling","staging"],"related":["Medical_test","Surgeon","Interventional_radiologist","Sampling_(medicine)","Cell_(biology)","Biological_tissue","Microscope","Pathologist","Histological","Needle_aspiration_biopsy","Ernest_Besnier","Arab","Abu_al-Qasim_al-Zahrawi","Goiter","Needle_aspiration_biopsy","Pathology","Benign_tumor","Malignant_tumor","Mastectomy","Staging_(pathology)","X-ray","Computed_tomography","Magnetic_resonance_imaging","Ultrasound","Endoscopy","Temporal_artery","Vasculitis","Inflammatory_bowel_disease","Crohn's_disease","Ulcerative_colitis","Lesion","Vasculitis","Amyloidosis","Gingival","Organ_transplant","Transplant_rejection","Infertility","Sperm_quality","Bone_marrow","Blood","Bone_marrow","Bone_marrow_examination","Leukemia","Lymphoma","Trabecular_bone","Trephine","Gastrointestinal_tract","Endoscopy","Gastrointestinal_tract","Esophagus","Stomach","Duodenum","Rectum","Colon_(anatomy)","Ileum","Lung","Lung","Liver","Hepatitis","Fibrosis","Cirrhosis","Wilson's_disease","Quantitative_property","Copper","Prostate","Prostate_biopsy","Transrectal_biopsy","Transurethral_biopsy","Nervous_system","Brain_biopsy","Nerve_biopsy","Meningeal_biopsy","Urogenital_system","Renal_biopsy","Endometrial_biopsy","Cervical_conization","Breast_biopsy","Lymph_node_biopsy","Muscle_biopsy","Skin_biopsy","Pathology","Laboratory","Pathologist","Physician","Diseases","Cancer","Microscope","Histology","Tissue_(biology)","Cell_(biology)","Interventional_radiology"]}
