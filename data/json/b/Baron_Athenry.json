{"cursor":"3598","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Baron Athenry' is one of the oldest titles in the Peerage of Ireland, but\nthe date of its creation is thoroughly uncertain; each of the first four\nBerminghams listed below is claimed by some writers to be Lord Athenry, but\nthe evidence is disputed. http://books.googl-\ne.co.uk/books?id=wIsUAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA31&lpg=PA31&dq=peter+de+birmingham&sour-\nce=web&ots=ML0jmFqtlC&sig=FujkAHWpzWG-\ne7VOiuudEcNpn4Q&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=8&ct=result#PPA30,M1\nThe title appears to have been given to the de Birmingham family of\nBirmingham, Warks, England as a reward for their help in the Norman\ninvasion of Ireland in 1172. Both Sir William de Birmingham, and his son\nRobert de Birmingham, are variously claimed to have been involved in the\ninvasion, but it is probable that, after\nthe invasion, William returned to his home in England and left Robert their\nnew lands in Ireland.\n\n\n\nPeter Bermingham was fined for not attending Parliament in 1284, and is enrolled\nas Lord Athenry in the Parliament of 1295. The title Earl of Louth was created\nin 1319 as a reward to John de Bermingham for his victory over Edward de Bruce\nin the Battle of Faughart in 1318.\n\nThe last Baron was created 'Earl of Louth' in the Peerage of Ireland in 1749,\nbut died in 1799. Since he had three daughters, the Earldom of Louth became\nextinct at his death; the Barony of Athenry became dormant. Part of the problem\nhas been whether the Barony properly can descend through the female line, in\nwhich case it is in abeyance between the heirs of his daughters; or whether it\npasses through the male line. A descendant of the younger brother of the\nRichard, Lord Athenry, who died in 1645, claimed the Barony as heir male in\n1827, and Thomas Denman, the Attorney General for England and Wales, agreed that\nhe was heir male, but he was not recognized by the House of Lords.\n","linknr":124,"url":"Baron_Athenry","recorded":1374763080,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Baron_Athenry&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Baron_Athenry&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Peerage_of_Ireland","#cite_note-books.google.co.uk-1","/wiki/De_Birmingham_family","/wiki/Birmingham","/wiki/Norman_invasion_of_Ireland","/wiki/De_Birmingham_family","#cite_note-books.google.co.uk-1","/wiki/File:Louthcrest.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/Louthcrest.jpg/220px-Louthcrest.jpg","/wiki/File:Louthcrest.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf7/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Battle_of_Faughart","/wiki/Baron","/wiki/Abeyance","/wiki/Heir_male","/wiki/Thomas_Denman,_1st_Baron_Denman","/wiki/Attorney_General_for_England_and_Wales","#Barons_Athenry","#Earl_of_Louth.3B_First_creation_.281319.29","#Earl_of_Louth.3B_Second_creation_.281749.29","#See_also","#References","/w/index.php?title=Baron_Athenry&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Meyler_de_Bermingham","/wiki/Peter_de_Bermingham","/wiki/Rickard_de_Bermingham","/wiki/Thomas_de_Bermingham","/wiki/Walter_de_Bermingham","/wiki/Thomas_II_de_Bermingham","/wiki/Thomas_III_de_Bermingham","/wiki/Meiler_de_Bermingham","/wiki/John_de_Bermingham","/wiki/Richard_II_de_Bermingham","/wiki/Edmond_I_de_Bermingham","/wiki/Richard_III_de_Bermingham","/wiki/Edmond_II_de_Bermingham","/wiki/Francis_de_Bermingham","/wiki/Edward_de_Bermingham","/wiki/Francis_II_de_Bermingham","/wiki/Thomas_IV_de_Bermingham","/w/index.php?title=Baron_Athenry&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/John_de_Bermingham,_1st_Earl_of_Louth","/w/index.php?title=Baron_Athenry&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/Thomas_Bermingham,_1st_Earl_of_Louth","/w/index.php?title=Baron_Athenry&action=edit&section=4","/wiki/De_Birmingham_family","/wiki/Birmingham_(disambiguation)","/wiki/Bermingham_(surname)","/wiki/Birmingham","/w/index.php?title=Baron_Athenry&action=edit&section=5","/wiki/Complete_Peerage","#cite_ref-books.google.co.uk_1-0","#cite_ref-books.google.co.uk_1-1","http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=wIsUAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA31&lpg=PA31&dq=peter+de+birmingham&source=web&ots=ML0jmFqtlC&sig=FujkAHWpzWG-e7VOiuudEcNpn4Q&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=8&ct=result#PPA30,M1","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Baron_Athenry&oldid=561462971","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Baronies_in_the_Peerage_of_Ireland","/wiki/Category:Dormant_peerages","/wiki/Category:Use_dmy_dates_from_June_2013","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Baron+Athenry&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Baron+Athenry","/wiki/Baron_Athenry","/w/index.php?title=Talk:Baron_Athenry&action=edit&redlink=1","#","/wiki/Baron_Athenry","/w/index.php?title=Baron_Athenry&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Baron_Athenry&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Baron_Athenry","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Baron_Athenry","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Baron_Athenry&oldid=561462971","/w/index.php?title=Baron_Athenry&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4862123","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Baron_Athenry&id=561462971","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Baron+Athenry","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Baron+Athenry&oldid=561462971&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Baron_Athenry&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4862123#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/lic
