The starch and saccharification enzymes\nare often derived from malted cereal grains, most commonly malted barley and\nmalted wheat. Barth, Roger. The Chemistry of Beer, 3/e.\n2011: ISBN 978-0-9847950-3-1. Most beer is also flavoured with hops,\nwhich add bitterness and act as a natural preservative, though other\nflavourings such as herbs or fruit may occasionally be included. The\npreparation of beer is called brewing.\n\nBeer is the world's most widely consumed alcoholic beverage; it is\nthe third-most popular drink overall, after water and tea. It is thought by some to be the oldest fermented\nbeverage. Joshua J. Mark (2011).\n[http://www.ancient.eu.com/Beer/ Beer]. Ancient History\nEncyclopedia.\n\nSome of humanity's earliest known writings refer to the production and\ndistribution of beer: the Code of Hammurabi included laws regulating beer and\nbeer parlours, and \"The Hymn to Ninkasi\", a prayer to the\nMesopotamian goddess of beer, served as both a prayer and as a method of\nremembering the recipe for beer in a culture with few literate people. Today, the brewing industry is a global\nbusiness, consisting of several dominant multinational companies and many\nthousands of smaller producers ranging from brewpubs to regional breweries.\n\nThe strength of beer is usually around 4% to 6% alcohol by volume (abv) although\nit may vary between 0.5% (de-alcoholized) and 20%, with some breweries creating\nexamples of 40% abv and above in recent years.\n\nBeer forms part of the culture of beer-drinking nations and is associated with\nsocial traditions such as beer festivals, as well as a rich pub culture\ninvolving activities like pub crawling and pub games such as bar billiards.\n","linknr":1748,"url":"Beer","recorded":1362505736,"links":203,"instances":["carrier","beer","beer","writer","beer","beer","taste","establishment","fuel","beer","food"],"pdf":["http://www.food.gov.uk/multimedia/pdfs/consultationresponse/summrespvegi.pdf","http://www.ab-inbev.com/documents/press_release.pdf","http://www.ab-inbev.com/documents/press_release.pdf","http://www.brewersofeurope.org/docs/publications/beerfacts2003.pdf","http://www.brewersofeurope.org/docs/publications/beerfacts2003.pdf","http://www.newbelgium.com/files/shared/the-carbon-footprint-of-fat-tire-amber-ale-2008-public-dist-rfs_0.pdf","http://www.newbelgium.com/files/shared/the-carbon-footprint-of-fat-tire-amber-ale-2008-public-dist-rfs_0.pdf","http://epress.lib.uts.edu.au/dspace/bitstream/2100/268/5/05Section3toBib.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20081002104412/http://epress.lib.uts.edu.au/dspace/bitstream/2100/268/5/05Section3toBib.pdf","http://epress.lib.uts.edu.au/dspace/bitstream/2100/268/5/05Section3toBib.pdf"],"categories":["Beer|","Fermented
