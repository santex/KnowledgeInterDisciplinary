The main industries on the island include fishing,\narts and crafts such as glass making and pottery using locally worked clay, and\ndairy farming. Tourism is important during the summer. The topography of the\nisland consists of dramatic rock formations in the north (unlike the rest of\nDenmark which is very flat) sloping down towards pine and deciduous forests\n(greatly damaged by storms in the 1950s) and farmland in the middle and sandy\nbeaches in the south.\n\n'Bornholm Regional [[Municipality]]' covers the entire island. Bornholm was one\nof the three last Danish municipalities () not belonging to a countyâ the others\nwere Copenhagen and Frederiksberg. On 1 January 2007, the municipality lost its\nshort-lived (2003 to 2006) county status and became part of Region Hovedstaden\n(the Copenhagen Capital Region).\n\nThe small Ertholmene islands are located to the northeast of Bornholm. They\nbelong neither to a municipality nor to a region but are administered by the\nMinistry of Defence.\n\nStrategically located in the Baltic Sea, Bornholm has been fought over for\ncenturies. It has usually been ruled by Denmark, but also by LÃ¼beck and Sweden.\nThe Hammershus castle ruin, at the northwestern tip of the island, is the\nlargest medieval fortress in northern Europe, testament to the importance of\nits location.\n","linknr":913,"url":"Bornholm","recorded":1362557283,"links":89,"instances":["denmark","denmark","1660","language","country_subdivision","region","linguistics","world_war_ii","yatching"],"pdf":["http://www.dst.dk/pukora/epub/upload/14468/headword/dk/3.pdf","http://stage-wilson.p2technology.com/sites/default/files/ACFB01.pdf","http://www.skoletjenesten.dk/Grundskolen/~/media/EducationOffers/Designmuseum%20Danmark/Undervisningsmateriale/05_gertrud_vasegaard.pdf","http://www.maniskor.se/isbn9789197726528.pdf","http://www.maniskor.se/isbn9789197726528.pdf","http://www.maniskor.se/isbn9789197726511cropmarked.pdf","http://www.maniskor.se/isbn9789197726511cropmarked.pdf"],"categories":["Municipalities
