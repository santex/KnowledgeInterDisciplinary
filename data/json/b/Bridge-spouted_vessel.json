{"cursor":"1210","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'bridge spouted vessel' is a particular design of pitcher originating in\nantiquity; there is typically a connecting element between the spout and filling\naperture, and the spout is a completely independent aperture from the usually\nsmaller central fill opening. Early incidences of the bridge spouted vessel are\nfound in Persia in the early Iron Age [http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore-\n/highlights/highlight_objects/me/b/bridge-spouted_jug_on_tripod_s.aspx British\nMuseum: example of bridge spouted jug] and on Crete. This type of vessel\ntypically appears in the Bronze Age or early Iron Age. A very early example of a\nbridge spouted bowl has been recovered at the ancient palace of Phaistos on\nCrete, dating to the Bronze Age.
