When a bicycle has no suspension it is called 'rigid'. Bicycles with\nonly rear suspension are uncommon.\n\nBesides providing comfort to the rider, suspension systems improve traction and\nsafety by helping to keep one or both wheels in contact with the ground.\n","linknr":434,"url":"Bicycle_suspension","recorded":1362537873,"links":41,"instances":["company","engineering","bicycle_part","device","vehicle","mechanism","bicycles","vehicle"],"pdf":["http://downhill-rangers.com/frame/infos/mechanik_physik/path_analysis/Path%20Analysis.pdf","http://downhill-rangers.com/frame/infos/mechanik_physik/path_analysis/Path%20Analysis.pdf","http://www.google.com/patents/US5678837.pdf","http://www.google.com/patents/US5678837.pdf","http://www.google.com/patents/US5509679.pdf","http://www.google.com/patents/US5509679.pdf","http://www.google.com/patents/USRE39159.pdf","http://www.google.com/patents/USRE39159.pdf","http://www.google.com/patents/US7128329.pdf","http://www.google.com/patents/US7128329.pdf","http://www.feltbicycles.com/assest_img/technology_docs/suspension/suspension_12_v1.pdf","http://www.feltbicycles.com/assest_img/technology_docs/suspension/suspension_12_v1.pdf","http://www.google.com/patents/US6073950.pdf","http://www.google.com/patents/US6073950.pdf","http://www.google.com/patents/US6099010.pdf","http://www.google.com/patents/US6099010.pdf"],"categories":["Bicycle
