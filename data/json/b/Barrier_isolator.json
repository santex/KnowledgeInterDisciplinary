{"cursor":"2333","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'barrier isolator', or simply an 'isolator', is a device that provides a\nphysical barrier between a laboratory technician and a work process. Isolators\nare routinely found within the pharmaceutical industry, and with the recent\nimplementation of USP 797 (\"Pharmaceutical Compounding: Sterile Preparations\", a\nset of sterile compounding standards issued by the United States Pharmacopeia),\nare increasingly used in pharmacy applications. They are designed to provide an\nisolation of a process or the maintenance of an internal condition (e.g.,\nsterile or aseptic). Isolators may operate at positive, negative, or ambient\ndifferential pressure. Isolators may provide personnel, product, or\nenvironmental protection, or any combination thereof. They are used throughout\nindustry, from orange juice filling lines to cytotoxic drug compounding to\nelectronics manufacturing.\n\nRegarding pharmacy applications, because people are the greatest source of\ncontamination during aseptic manufacturing of drugs, reducing personnel\ninterventions into the process zone has significant impact on the efficacy of\nthe final drug product. In the mid-1980s, the industry began to employ barrier\nisolators, and later, in the 1990s, Restricted Access Barrier Systems, or RABS,\nto separate people from the process. The acronym RABS was coined by Stewart\nDavenport of Upjohn (now Pfizer). Since that time, the technology and\napplications of these systems has developed and broadened significantly.\n\nMajor manufacturers of barrier isolators include [http://www.powdersystems.com\nPowder Systems Limited], [http://www.getinge.com GETINGE],\n[http://www.envair.co.uk Envair Limited], [http://www.machaire.co.uk Mach-Aire\nLtd], [http://www.walkerbarrier.com Walker Barrier Systems],\n[http://www.howorthgroup.com Howorth Air Technology], [http://www.amercare.co.uk\nAmercare Ltd], [http://www.bakerco.com The Baker Company], Esco Global, and Thermo-\nElectron Corporation.\n","linknr":97,"url":"Barrier_isolator","recorded":1362890097,"links":13,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Pharmacy"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/Filled_Syringe_icon.svg/30px-Filled_Syringe_icon.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Laboratory","Technician","Pharmaceutical_industry","USP_797","Compounding","United_States_Pharmacopeia","Pharmacy","Asepsis","Atmospheric_pressure","Cytotoxicity","Restricted_Access_Barrier_System","Pfizer"]}
