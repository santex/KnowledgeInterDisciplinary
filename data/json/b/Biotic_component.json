A 'biotic\nfactor' is any living component that affects another organism, including animals\nthat consume the organism in question, and the living food that the organism\nconsumes. Each biotic factor needs energy to do work and food for proper growth.\nBiotic factors include human influence.\n\nBiotic components are contrasted to abiotic components, which are non-living\ncomponents of an organism's environment, such as temperature, light, moisture,\nair currents, etc. Remember the abiotic factors by SWATS. Soil, Water, Air,\nTemperature, and Sunlight.\n\nBiotic components usually include:\n* Producers, i.e. autotrophs: e.g. plants, they convert the energy [from\n  photosynthesis (the transfer of sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide into\n  energy), or other sources such as hydrothermal vents] into food.\n* Consumers, i.e. heterotrophs: e.g. animals, they depend upon producers\n  (occasionally other consumers) for food.\n* Decomposers, i.e. detritivores: e.g. fungi and bacteria, they break down\n  chemicals from producers and consumers (usually dead) into simpler form which\n  can be reused.\n","linknr":365,"url":"Biotic_component","recorded":1362483344,"links":36,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Ecology"],"headings":["See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Earth_flag_PD.jpg/32px-Earth_flag_PD.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b3/FoodWeb.jpg/140px-FoodWeb.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Genomics_GTL_Program_Payoffs.jpg/140px-Genomics_GTL_Program_Payoffs.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/Secondary_succesion_cm01.jpg/40px-Secondary_succesion_cm01.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Ecosystem","Organism","Animal","Food","Abiotic_component","Autotroph","Plants","Heterotroph","Animals","Detritivore","Fungi","Bacteria","Abiotic_component","Biotic_stress","Ecology"]}
