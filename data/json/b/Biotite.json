More generally, it refers to the dark mica\nseries, primarily a solid-solution series between the iron-endmember annite, and\nthe magnesium-endmember phlogopite; more aluminous endmembers include\nsiderophyllite. Biotite was named by J.F.L. Hausmann in 1847 in honour of the\nFrench physicist Jean-Baptiste Biot, who, in 1816, researched the optical\nproperties of mica, discovering many unique properties. \"Zur Bezeichnung\ndes sogenannten einachsigen Glimmers ist hier der Name Biotit gewÃ¤hlt worden, um\ndaran zu erinnern, daÃ Biot es war, der zuerst auf die optische Verschiedenheit\nder Glimmerarten aufmerksam machte.\" (For the designation of so-called uniaxial\nmica, the name \"biotite\" has been chosen in order to recall that it was Biot who\nfirst called attention to the optical differences between types of mica.)\n\nBiotite is a sheet silicate. Iron, magnesium, aluminium, silicon, oxygen, and\nhydrogen form sheets that are weakly bound together by potassium ions. It is\nsometimes called \"iron mica\" because it is more iron-rich than phlogopite. It is\nalso sometimes called \"black mica\" as opposed to \"white mica\" (muscovite) â both\nform in some rocks, in some instances side-by-side.\n","linknr":247,"url":"Biotite","recorded":1362579284,"links":51,"instances":["mineralogy","mineral_property","mineralogy","geometry","materials"],"pdf":["http://rruff.geo.arizona.edu/doclib/hom/biotite.pdf","http://www.minsocam.org/ammin/AM66/AM66_885.pdf","http://www.minsocam.org/ammin/AM66/AM66_885.pdf"],"categories":["Magnesium minerals","Iron minerals","Potassium minerals","Aluminium minerals","Phyllosilicates","Monoclinic minerals","Mica group"],"headings":["Properties","Occurrence","Uses","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c8/Biotite_aggregate_-_Ochtendung%2C_Eifel%2C_Germany.jpg/200px-Biotite_aggregate_-_Ochtendung%2C_Eifel%2C_Germany.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/MeroxeneSomma.png/220px-MeroxeneSomma.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["lamellae","materials"],["prism","geometry"],["lustre","mineralogy"],["streak","mineralogy"],["bird's_eye_maple","mineral_property"]],"members":["streak","lustre","prism","lamellae"],"related":["Mica","Monoclinic","Mineral","Mica","Solid_solution","Annite","Phlogopite","Siderophyllite","Johann_Friedrich_Ludwig_Hausmann","Physicist","Jean-Baptiste_Biot","Mica","Silicate","Iron","Magnesium","Aluminium","Silicon","Oxygen","Hydrogen","Potassium","Muscovite","Mica","Basal_cleavage","Lamellae_(materials)","Monoclinic_crystal_system","Tabular","Prism_(geometry)","Pinacoid","Termination","Pseudohexagonal","Weathering","Lustre_(mineralogy)","Streak_(mineralogy)","Polarized_light_microscopy","Bird's_eye_maple_(mineral_property)","Igneous_rock","Metamorphic_rocks","Lava","Mount_Vesuvius","Dolomites","Phenocryst","Lamprophyre","Pegmatite","New_England","Virginia","North_Carolina","Bancroft,_Ontario","Greater_Sudbury","Ontario","Schist","Pressure","Temperature","Iveland","Potassium-argon_dating","Argon-argon_dating","Argon","Iron","Magnesium","Garnet"]}
