In addition to these living and/or replicating pathogens,\nbiological toxins are also included among the bio-agents. More than 1,200\ndifferent kinds of potentially weaponizable bio-agents have been described and\nstudied to date.\n\nBiological agents have the ability to adversely affect human health in a variety\nof ways, ranging from relatively mild allergic reactions to serious medical\nconditions, including death. Many of these organisms are ubiquitous in the\nnatural environment where they are found in water, soil, plants, or\nanimals. Bio-agents may be amenable to \"weaponization\" to render them\neasier to deploy or disseminate. Genetic modification may enhance their\nincapacitating or lethal properties, or render them impervious to conventional\ntreatments or preventives. Since many bio-agents reproduce rapidly and require\nminimal resources for propagation, they are also a potential danger in a wide\nvariety of occupational settings.\n\nThe Biological Weapons Convention (1972) is an international treaty banning the\nuse or stockpiling of bio-agents; it currently has 165 state signatories. Bio-\nagents are, however, widely studied for defensive purposes under various\nbiosafety levels and within biocontainment facilities throughout the world. In\n2008, according to a U.S. Congressional Research Service report, China, Cuba,\nEgypt, Iran, Israel, North Korea, Russia, Syria and Taiwan were considered, with\nvarying degrees of certainty, to be maintaining bio-agents in an offensive BW\nprogram capacity.\n","linknr":325,"url":"Bio-agents","recorded":1362501502,"links":22,"instances":["disease"],"pdf":["http://www.cdc.gov/od/sap/docs/salist.pdf"],"categories":["Biological weapons|"],"headings":["Classifications","List of biological and toxin agents of military importance","See also","External links","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/1993_Kameido_site_fluid_petri.jpg/220px-1993_Kameido_site_fluid_petri.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["plague","disease"],["plague","disease"]],"members":["plague"],"related":["Anthrax","Bacterium","Virus","Protozoan","Parasites","Fungus","Bioterrorism","Biological_warfare","Pathogens","Toxin","Health","Allergy","Death","Natural_environment","Biological_Weapons_Convention","Biosafety_levels","Biocontainment","Congressional_Research_Service","China","Cuba","Egypt","Iran","Israel","North_Korea","Russia","Syria","Taiwan","US_biological_warfare_program","United_States","U.S._Department_of_Health_and_Human_Services","U.S._Department_of_Agriculture","Select_agents","Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention","Chemical_weapon_designation","Anthrax","Bacillus_anthracis","Brucellosis","Brucella_abortus","Brucellosis","Brucella_melitensis","Brucellosis","Brucella_suis","Cholera","Vibrio_cholerae","Diphtheria","Corynebacterium_diphtheriae","Dysentery","Shigella_dysenteriae","Escherichia_coli","Glanders","Burkholderia_mallei","Listeriosis","Listeria_monocytogenes","Melioidosis","Burkholderia_pseudomallei","Plague_(disease)","Yersinia_pestis","Tularemia","Francisella_tularensis","Chemical_weapon_designation","Psittacosis","Chlamydophila_psittaci","Chemical_weapon_designation","Q_fever","Coxiella_burnetii","Rocky_Mountain_spotted_fever","Rickettsia_rickettsii","Epidemic_typhus","Rickettsia_prowazekii","Murine_typhus","Rickettsia_typhi","Chemical_weapon_designation","Eastern_equine_encephalitis_virus","Eastern_equine_encephalitis_virus","Venezuelan_Equine_Encephalomyelitis_virus","Venezuelan_Equine_Encephalomyelitis_virus","Western_equine_encephalitis_virus","Western_equine_encephalitis_virus","Japanese_B_encephalitis","Japanese_encephalitis_virus","Rift_Valley_fever","Rift_Valley_fever","Smallpox","Variola_virus","Yellow_fever","Yellow_fever_virus","Chemical_weapon_designation","Coccidiomycosis","Coccidioides_immitis","Chemical_weapon_designation","Botulinum_toxin","Ricin","Castor_bean","Saxitoxin","Staphyloccocal_enterotoxin_B","Staphylococcus_aureus","Tetrodotoxin","Vibrio_alginolyticus","Pseudoalteromonas","Trichothecene","Mycotoxins","Fusarium","Trichoderma","Stachybotrys","Chemical_weapon_designation","Mosquito","Aedes_aegypti","Malaria","Dengue_fever","Yellow_fever","Arbovirus","Oriental_rat_flea","Xenopsylla_cheopis","Plague_(disease)","Murine_typhus","Toxin","Biological_hazard","Laboratory_Response_Network"]}
