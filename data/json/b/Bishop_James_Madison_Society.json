{"cursor":"3014","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The 'Bishop James Madison Society' is a secret society of the College of William\nand Mary in Virginia. Students founded the society in the year 1812 as a tribute\nto the life of the late Bishop James Madison, eighth president of William and\nMary and cousin to the U.S. president James Madison. Like other\nsecret societies at the college, the Bishop James Madison Society fell victim to\nthe hostilities of the American Civil War when William and Mary was occupied by\nUnion troops and was forced to close its doors.\n\nIn the twentieth century, William and Mary students along with Professor Holmes\nrevived the society and it has thrived since. The societyâs activities seek to\nfoster pride in the college community. The society attempts through various\nsmall and private means to recognize and thank the college's unsung heroes.\nRecent public activities include placing a welcome banner on Old Campus to\nwelcome new students during Convocation and families on parents' weekend, hiding\nplastic Easter eggs filled with candy and interesting facts about the college\nthroughout the campus, and sponsoring coffee dates designed to increase dialogue\namong students, administrators, and faculty members. The society's most\nprominent activity is its \"Last Lecture\" Series, which honors one retiring\nfaculty member each semester by inviting them to speak on issues of current\nsocial/academic importance. The lecture takes place in the historic Wren Chapel\nduring the last week of classes.\n\nThe Society is private in membership and public in its activities. During the\ncollege's annual commencement exercises, some graduating members identify their\ninvolvement by wearing medals featuring the society's symbol, an elongated\nquatrefoil.\n","linknr":193,"url":"Bishop_James_Madison_Society","recorded":1372153903,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Bishop_James_Madison_Society&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Bishop_James_Madison_Society&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Secret_society","/wiki/College_of_William_and_Mary","/wiki/Virginia","/wiki/James_Madison_(Episcopal_Bishop)","/wiki/James_Madison","#cite_note-1","/wiki/American_Civil_War","/wiki/Wren_Chapel","#cite_note-lastlecture-2","#cite_note-3","#cite_note-4","/wiki/Quatrefoil","/w/index.php?title=Bishop_James_Madison_Society&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Collegiate_secret_societies_in_North_America","/w/index.php?title=Bishop_James_Madison_Society&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-1","http://www.wm.edu/style/secret.php","/wiki/College_of_William_and_Mary","#cite_ref-lastlecture_2-0","http://flathat.wm.edu/2003-04-25/story.php?type=1&aid=10","/wiki/The_Flat_Hat","/wiki/College_of_William_and_Mary","#cite_ref-3","http://www.flathatnews.com/content/70836/last-lecture-almost","/wiki/The_Flat_Hat","/wiki/College_of_William_and_Mary","#cite_ref-4","http://www.flathatnews.com/content/70650/college-legend-talks-tradition","/wiki/The_Flat_Hat","/wiki/College_of_William_and_Mary","/wiki/Template:The_College_of_William_%26_Mary","/wiki/Template_talk:The_College_of_William_%26_Mary","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:The_College_of_William_%26_Mary&action=edit","/wiki/College_of_William_%26_Mary","/wiki/College_of_William_%26_Mary#Academics","/wiki/Richard_Bland_College","/wiki/Mason_School_of_Business","/wiki/College_of_William_%26_Mary_Graduate_School_of_Arts_and_Sciences","/wiki/College_of_William_%26_Mary_School_of_Education","/wiki/William_%26_Mary_School_of_Law","/wiki/Virginia_Institute_of_Marine_Science","/wiki/Center_for_Gifted_Education","/wiki/Omohundro_Institute_of_Early_American_History_and_Culture","/wiki/The_Thomas_Jefferson_Program_in_Public_Policy","/wiki/Brigham%E2%80%93Kanner_Property_Rights_Conference","/wiki/Brigham%E2%80%93Kanner_Property_Rights_Prize","/wiki/Honor_code","/wiki/Institute_of_Bill_of_Rights_Law","/wiki/Phi_Beta_Kappa_Society","/wiki/Public_Ivy","/wiki/William_%26_Mary_scandal_of_1951","/wiki/William_%26_Mary_Tribe","/wiki/William_%26_Mary_Tribe_football","/wiki/Capital_Cup","/wiki/William_%26_Mary_Tribe_men%27s_basketball","/wiki/William_%26_Mary_Tribe_men%27s_soccer","/wiki/William_%26_Mary_Tribe_women%27s_soccer","/wiki/William_%26_Mary_Tribe_baseball","/wiki/Albert-Daly_Field","/wiki/Blow_Gymnasium","/wiki/Busch_Field","/wiki/Jimmye_Laycock_Football_Center","/wiki/Millie_West_Tennis_Facility","/wiki/William_%26_Mary_Hall","/wiki/McCormack%E2%80%93Nagelsen_Tennis_Center","/wiki/Plumeri_Park","/wiki/Zable_Stadium","/wiki/Colonial_Athletic_Association","/wiki/Griffin_(mascot)","/wiki/William_%26_Mary_Pep_Band","/wiki/Tribe_Fight_Song","/wiki/William_%26_Mary_Tribe","/wiki/Alan_B._Miller_Hall","/wiki/Alumni_House_(College_of_William_%26_Mary)","/wiki/Brafferton_(building)","/wiki/Crim_Dell_bridge","/wiki/Earl_Gregg_Swem_Library","/wiki/Henry_C._Wolf_Law_Library","/wiki/Integrated_Science_Center","/wiki/Mason_School_of_Business_Library","/wiki/Muscarelle_Museum_of_Art","/wiki/Phi_Beta_Kappa_Memorial_Hall","/wiki/Sunken_Garden_(Virginia)","/wiki/William_J._Hargis,_Jr._Library","/wiki/Wren_Building","/wiki/History_of_The_College_of_William_%26_Mary","/wiki/History_of_The_College_of_William_%26_Mary","/wiki/History_of_The_College_of_William_%26_Mary#Firsts","/wiki/Colonial_Colleges","/wiki/Matthew_Whaley_School","/wiki/Christopher_Newport_University#History","/wiki/Old_Dominion_University#History","/wiki/The_Colleges_of_William_%26_Mary","/wiki/Wren_Building#Priorities_of_the_College","/wiki/List_of_College_of_William_%26_Mary_alumni","/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_College_of_William_%26_Mary","/wiki/Chancellor_of_the_College_of_William_%26_Mary","/wiki/W._Taylor_Reveley_III","/wiki/Robert_Gates","/wiki/William_and_Mary","/wiki/The_College_of_William_%26_Mary#Speakers","/wiki/College_of_William_%26_Mary#Student_life","/wiki/American_Parliamentary_Debate_Association","/wiki/Williamsburg_Area_Transport","/wiki/The_Gentlemen_of_the_College","/wiki/The_College_of_William_%26_M
