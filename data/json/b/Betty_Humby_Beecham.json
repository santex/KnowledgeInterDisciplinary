{"cursor":"3755","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Betty Humby Beecham, Lady Beecham' (1908 â 2 September 1958) was a British\npianist, who married the English conductor and impresario Sir Thomas Beecham in\nFebruary 1943. She was 29 years his junior.\n\nBetty Humby was the daughter of Daniel Morgan Humby, a dentist and member of the\nRoyal College of Surgeons. At the age of 10, she was the youngest\never person to win a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Music. When\nshe was 14, she taught 30 pupils of her own, and two years later she became a\npiano professor, under Myra Hess at Tobias Matthay's London music\nschool. Later she married an Anglican parson, Rev. H. Cashel Thomas,\nwho in the early 1940s was vicar of St. Philip's in London. They had a son, Sir\nJeremy Cashel Thomas, born June 1, 1931.\n\nWith the outbreak of World War II, Betty Humby Thomas organized concerts in\nBritish cathedrals. In 1940, she left Britain for the United States with her\nyoung son Jeremy. While in the U.S. she hoped to raise money for\nLondon's Great Ormond Street Hospital for Sick Children, where her brother was\nchief surgeon.\n\nHaving met in the 1930s in England, in the U.S., Betty Humby Thomas and Sir\nThomas Beecham were reintroduced by Andrew Schulhof, who managed each of them.\nHe later arranged for them to perform the Delius piano concerto together in June\n1941 at a studio concert for CBS.\n\nBetty Humby Thomas married Sir Thomas January 19, 1943, one month after his\ndivorce was granted from wife Utica Celestia Welles. According to John Lucas's\nbiography, Thomas Beecham: An Obsession with Music, they were married in secret\nbefore a police justice in Manhattan. They lived in New York City at 31 East\n79th Street.\n\nHer best-known recording is probably that of the Delius concerto, with her\nhusband conducting the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, in 1946, shortly after he\nhad founded it. This recording of October 1946 replaced an earlier version, made\nwith the London Philharmonic Orchestra on October 3, 1945, which was not\nreleased. T. Beecham, Frederick Delius (Severn House Edition 1975) (cf.\ndiscography by Malcolm Walker).\n\nAccording to the Lucas biography, her performance of the Delius concerto at\nLafayette, Indiana, on December 1, 1950, marked the end of Lady Betty's\nplaying career.\n","linknr":111,"url":"Betty_Humby_Beecham","recorded":1364053586,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Betty_Humby_Beecham&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Betty_Humby_Beecham&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/United_Kingdom","/wiki/Pianist","/wiki/Thomas_Beecham","#cite_note-1","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Myra_Hess","/wiki/Tobias_Matthay","#cite_note-3","#cite_note-4","/wiki/Great_Ormond_Street_Hospital","/wiki/CBS","/wiki/Frederick_Delius","/wiki/Royal_Philharmonic_Orchestra","/wiki/London_Philharmonic_Orchestra","#cite_note-5","/w/index.php?title=Betty_Humby_Beecham&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","http://thepeerage.com/p13720.htm#i137192","http://thepeerage.com/p13720.htm#i137192","#cite_ref-2","http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,851258,00.html","#cite_ref-3","http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,851258,00.html","#cite_ref-4","http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,851258,00.html","#cite_ref-5","/w/index.php?title=Betty_Humby_Beecham&action=edit&section=2","http://www.tutti.co.uk/CDs/beecham-conducts-handel-KHOKE-SOMB7-R34","http://www.thepeerage.com/p13720.htm","http://books.google.de/books?id=FUQyyHtsUigC&pg=PA92&dq=%22Betty+Humby%22&hl=de#v=onepage&q=%22Betty%20Humby%22&f=true","/wiki/Special:BookSources/9780754607212","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","/wiki/File:Nuvola_apps_kcmmidi.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/16/Nuvola_apps_kcmmidi.png/30px-Nuvola_apps_kcmmidi.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Betty_Humby_Beecham&action=edit","/wiki/Template:UK-keyboardist-stub","/w/index.php?title=Template_talk:UK-keyboardist-stub&action=edit&redlink=1","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:UK-keyboardist-stub&action=edit","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Betty_Humby_Beecham&oldid=544814599","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1958_deaths","/wiki/Category:1908_births","/wiki/Category:British_keyboardist_stubs","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/wiki/Category:Year_of_birth_uncertain","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Betty+Humby+Beecham&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Betty+Humby+Beecham","/wiki/Betty_Humby_Beecham","/wiki/Talk:Betty_Humby_Beecham","#","/wiki/Betty_Humby_Beecham","/w/index.php?title=Betty_Humby_Beecham&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Betty_Humby_Beecham&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Betty_Humby_Beecham","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Betty_Humby_Beecham","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Betty_Humby_Beecham&oldid=544814599","/w/index.php?title=Betty_Humby_Beecham&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Betty_Humby_Beecham&id=544814599","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Betty+Humby+Beecham","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Betty+Humby+Beecham&oldid=544814599&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Betty_Humby_Beecham&printable=yes","//de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betty_Humby_Beecham","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:ItemByTitle/enwiki/Betty
