It covers a wide range of subject\nmatter, but tending towards more 'highbrow' programmes than the more mainstream\nand popular BBC One. Like the BBC's other domestic TV and radio channels, it is\nfunded by the television licence, and is therefore commercial-free. It is a\ncomparatively well funded public service network, regularly attaining a much\nhigher audience share than most current public service networks worldwide.\n\nOriginally styled BBC2, it was the third British television station to be\nlaunched (starting on 20 April 1964), and from 1 July 1967, Europe's first\ntelevision channel to broadcast regularly in colour. It was envisaged as a home\nfor less mainstream and more ambitious programming, and while this tendency has\ncontinued to date, most special-interest programmes of a kind previously\nbroadcast on BBC Two, for example the BBC Proms, now tend to appear on BBC Four\ninstead.
