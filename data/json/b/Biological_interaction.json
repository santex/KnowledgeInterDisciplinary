These can be further classified by either the mechanism of the\ninteraction or the strength, duration and direction of their effects.\nSpecies may interact once in a generation (e.g. pollination) or live completely\nwithin another (e.g. endosymbiosis). Effects range from consumption of another\nindividual (predation, herbivory, or cannibalism), to mutual benefit\n(mutualism). Interactions need not be direct; individuals may affect each other\nindirectly through intermediaries such as shared resources or common enemies.\n","linknr":689,"url":"Biological_interaction","recorded":1362509041,"links":48,"instances":["animal","biology","ecology","biology","biology","ecology","evolution","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Biological interactions|"],"headings":["Interactions categorized by effect","Interactions classified by mechanism","See also","References","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/54/Black_Walnut_middle.JPG/220px-Black_Walnut_middle.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/26/Interaction_bird-giraffe.jpg/220px-Interaction_bird-giraffe.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a1/Hatti.jpg/220px-Hatti.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4b/Hummingbird_hawkmoth_a.jpg/220px-Hummingbird_hawkmoth_a.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b7/Common_clownfish.jpg/220px-Common_clownfish.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a1/Hirschkampf.jpg/220px-Hirschkampf.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/Biology_organism_collage.png/100px-Biology_organism_collage.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b3/FoodWeb.jpg/140px-FoodWeb.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Genomics_GTL_Program_Payoffs.jpg/140px-Genomics_GTL_Program_Payoffs.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["community","ecology"],["mutualism","biology"],["competition","biology"],["mutualism","biology"],["fitness","biology"],["biomass","ecology"],["co-operation","evolution"],["fitness","biology"],["territory","animal"],["community","ecology"],["cheating","biology"]],"members":["territory","competition","biomass","mutualism","fitness","community","cheating"],"related":["Organism","Community_(ecology)","Amensalism","Red-billed_Oxpecker","Giraffe","Ecology","Pollination","Endosymbiosis","Predation","Herbivore","Cannibalism","Mutualism_(biology)","Neutralism","Amensalism","Commensalism","Competition_(biology)","Mutualism_(biology)","Predation","Parasitism","Fitness_(biology)","Complex_system","Ecosystems","Organism","Penicillium","Bacteria","Juglone","Staphylococcus_epidermidis","Biofilms","Staphylococcus_aureus","Beta-defensin_2","Clade","Death","Parasitic","Biomass_(ecology)","Carnivore","Trophic_level","Parasitism","Parasitoid","Grazing","Batesian_mimicry","Intraguild_predation","Ecological_theory","Natural_selection","Niche_separation","Metapopulation","Remora","Carrying_capacity","Co-operation_(evolution)","Cleaner_fish","Pollination","Seed_dispersal","Gut_flora","Nitrogen_fixation","Fungi","Heteractis_magnifica","Oxford_University_Press","Herbivores","Gut_fauna","Coral","Carbon_fixation","Mycorrhyzal","Eukaryotes","Protist","Endosymbiotic_theory","Organism","Fitness_(biology)","Limiting_factor","Food","Water","Territory_(animal)","Abiotic","Community_(ecology)","Intraspecific_competition","Interspecific_competition","Predator","Community","Competitive_exclusion_principle","Adaptation","Extinction","Evolutionary_theory","Natural_selection","Altruism","Cheating_(biology)","Detritivory","Epibiont","Food_chain","Spite"]}
