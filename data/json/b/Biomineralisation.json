{"cursor":"17869","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" skeletal parts of belemnites (Jurassic of Wyoming)]] ), longitudinal section of\n the tube, aragonitic spherulitic prismatic structure]] 'Biomineralization' is\n the process by which living organisms produce minerals, often to harden or\n stiffen existing tissues. Such tissues are called mineralized tissues. It is an\n extremely widespread phenomenon; all six taxonomic kingdoms contain members\n that are able to form minerals, and over 60 different minerals have been\n identified in organisms. {{cite book |title=Biomineralization: From Nature\n to Application|editor=Astrid Sigel, Helmut Sigel and Roland K.O.\n Sigel|publisher=Wiley|year=2008|series=Metal Ions in Life Sciences|volume=4\n | isbn=978-0-470-03525-2}} {{cite book author=Weiner,\n | Stephen; Lowenstam, Heinz A. title=On biomineralization publisher=Oxford\n | University Press\n |location=Oxford [Oxfordshire] |year=1989 |pages= |isbn=0-19-504977-\n 2}} Examples include silicates in algae and diatoms,\n carbonates in invertebrates, and calcium phosphates and carbonates in\n vertebrates. These minerals often form structural features such as sea shells\n and the bone in mammals and birds. Organisms have been producing mineralised\n skeletons for the past 550 million years. Other examples include copper, iron\n and gold deposits involving bacteria. Biologically-formed minerals often have\n special uses such as magnetic sensors in magnetotactic bacteria\n (Fe 3O 4), gravity sensing devices (CaCO 3,\n CaSO 4, BaSO 4) and iron storage and mobilization\n (Fe 2O 3â¢H 2O in the protein ferritin).\n\nIn terms of taxonomic distribution, the most common biominerals are the\nphosphate and carbonate salts of calcium that are used in conjunction with\norganic polymers such as collagen and chitin to give structural support to bones\nand shells. The structures of these biocomposite materials are highly controlled\nfrom the nanometer to the macroscopic level, resulting in complex architectures\nthat provide multifunctional properties. Because this range of control over\nmineral growth is desirable for materials engineering applications, there is\nsignificant interest in understanding and elucidating the mechanisms of\nbiologically controlled biomineralization.\n","linknr":442,"url":"Biomineralisation","recorded":1362507987,"links":45,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://wzar.unizar.es/murero/activos/pdfs/2008_Zhuravlev&Wood_Geology.pdf","http://wzar.unizar.es/murero/activos/pdfs/2008_Zhuravlev&Wood_Geology.pdf","http://www.geochem.geos.vt.edu/bgep/pubs/Chapter_11_Knoll.pdf","http://www.geochem.geos.vt.edu/bgep/pubs/Chapter_11_Knoll.pdf"],"categories":["Pedology","Physiology"],"headings":["Biological roles","Biology","Chemistry","Evolution","Potential applications","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6e/BelemnitesJurassicWyoming.jpg/220px-BelemnitesJurassicWyoming.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/Glomerula_piloseta_tube_microstructure.jpg/220px-Glomerula_piloseta_tube_microstructure.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Belemnitida","Jurassic","Wyoming","Aragonite","Mineral","Mineralized_tissues","Silicates","Algae","Diatoms","Carbonate","Invertebrates","Calcium_phosphates","Calcium_carbonate","Vertebrates","Animal_shell","Bone","Mammals","Birds","Organism","Skeleton","Copper","Iron","Gold","Magnetotactic_bacteria","Ferritin","Phosphate","Carbonate","Calcium","Collagen","Chitin","Nanometer","Exaptation","Chiton","Calcite","Aragonite","Foraminifera","Coccolithophores","Calcareous_sponge","Corals","Archaeocyatha","Bryozoans","Brachiopod","Mollusc","Echinoderms","Serpulidae","Radiolarians","Diatoms","Sponge","Tooth_enamel","Vertebrate","Bone","Conodonts","Biomimetics","Apatite","Composite_material","Protein","Mars","Biosignature","Diatomaceous_earth","Magnetotactic_bacteria","Biocrystallization","Biointerface","Bone_mineral","Mineralized_tissues","Biomineralising_polychaetes"]}
