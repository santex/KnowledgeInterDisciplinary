Bioceramics are used in many types of\nmedical procedures. A primary medical procedures where they are used is\nimplants. This article is primarily concerned with rigid\nmaterials commonly used as surgical implants, though some bioceramics are\nflexible. The ceramic materials used are not the same as porcelain type ceramic\nmaterials. Rather bioceramics are closely related to either the body's own\nmaterials, or are extremely durable metal oxides.\n","linknr":195,"url":"Bioceramic","recorded":1362506215,"links":15,"instances":["medicine"],"pdf":["http://www.ualberta.ca/~hanifi/Bioceramics%20-%20Hench.pdf","http://www.ualberta.ca/~hanifi/Bioceramics%20-%20Hench.pdf"],"categories":["Inorganic chemistry","Physical chemistry","Ceramic engineering","Biomedical engineering","Implants","Prosthetics","Oral and maxillofacial surgery","Restorative dentistry","Oral surgery","Orthopedic surgery"],"headings":["History","Applications","Future trends","Bioceramic materials","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0a/Hip_prosthesis.jpg/220px-Hip_prosthesis.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["implant","medicine"],["implant","medicine"]],"members":["implant"],"related":["Bioglass","Ceramic","Biocompatibility","Biomaterials","Oxides","Implant_(medicine)","Implant_(medicine)","Porcelain","Mixed_metal_oxide","Vitallium","Bioglass","Cancer","Hyperthermia","Radiotherapy","Hyperthermia_treatment","Youngs_modulus","Diamond-like_carbon","Hydroxylapatite","Bioglass"]}
