Bees are a\nmonophyletic lineage within the superfamily Apoidea, presently classified by the\nunranked taxon name 'Anthophila'. There are nearly 20,000 known species of bees\nin seven to nine recognized families, though\nmany are undescribed and the actual number is probably higher. They are found on\nevery continent except Antarctica, in every habitat on the planet that contains\ninsect-pollinated flowering plants.\n\nBees are adapted for feeding on nectar and pollen, the former primarily as an\nenergy source and the latter primarily for protein and other nutrients. Most\npollen is used as food for larvae.\n\nBees have a long proboscis (a complex \"tongue\") that enables them to obtain the\nnectar from flowers. They have antennae almost universally made up of 13\nsegments in males and 12 in females, as is typical for the superfamily. Bees all\nhave two pairs of wings, the hind pair being the smaller of the two; in a very\nfew species, one sex or caste has relatively short wings that make flight\ndifficult or impossible, but none are wingless.\n\nThe smallest bee is Trigona minima, a stingless bee whose workers are about\n2.1 mm (5/64\") long. The largest bee in the world is [[Megachile pluto]],\na leafcutter bee whose females can attain a length of 39 mm (1.5\").\nMembers of the family Halictidae, or sweat bees, are the most common type of\nbee in the Northern Hemisphere, though they are small and often mistaken for\nwasps or flies.\n\nThe best-known bee species is the European honey bee, which, as its name\nsuggests, produces honey, as do a few other types of bee. Human management of\nthis species is known as beekeeping or apiculture.\n\nBees are the favorite meal of Merops apiaster, the bee-eater bird. Other common\npredators are kingbirds, mockingbirds, beewolves, and dragonflies.\n","linknr":891,"url":"Bee","recorded":1362483516,"links":128,"instances":["biology","genus","bee","biology","mythology","beekeeping","plant","state","animal","bee","bird","geometry","biology","biology"],"pdf":["http://fossilinsects.net/pdfs/Poinar_Danforth_2006_MelittosphexBurmese.pdf","http://fossilinsects.net/pdfs/Poinar_Danforth_2006_MelittosphexBurmese.pdf","http://cmsdata.iucn.org/downloads/bumblebee_sg_proofed.pdf","http://cmsdata.iucn.org/downloads/bumblebee_sg_proofed.pdf"],"categories":["Hymenoptera","Bees|","Pollinators"],"headings":["Pollination","Evolution","Eusocial
