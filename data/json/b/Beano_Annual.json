They are traditionally published in August, in time for\nChristmas, and since 1966 they have had the date of the following year on the\ncover. Before then, no date was given.\n\nFrom 1942 to 1949 the annuals were called \"The Magic-Beano Book\", which referred\nto the short-lived Magic Comic that had ceased publication due to World War II's\npaper rationing. The name reverted to the original title of \"The Beano Book\" in\nthe following year and continued, the year changing for each different annual,\nuntil the release of the 2003 book in 2002, when its current name was adopted,\nthough the following year still appears at the end. The 2011 Beano Annual is\ntaller and wider than previous editions.\n\nAfter paper rationing ended, the 'Magic' comic was never revived but some\ncharacters who had originally appeared in the pre-war Magic comic remained as\nregular strips in the post 1950 'Beano'. e.g. Koko the Pup.\n\nBecause of his popularity, Dennis the Menace has featured on the front cover of\nevery annual since the 1979 book.\n\nThe original Beano annuals were not dated.
