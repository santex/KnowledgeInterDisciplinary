{"cursor":"18714","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Business Process Modeling' (BPM) in systems engineering is the activity of\nrepresenting processes of an enterprise, so that the current process may be\nanalyzed and improved. BPM is typically performed by business analysts and\nmanagers who are seeking to improve process efficiency and quality. The process\nimprovements identified by BPM may or may not require Information Technology\ninvolvement, although that is a common driver for the need to model a business\nprocess, by creating a process master.\n\nChange management programs are typically involved to put the improved business\nprocesses into practice. With advances in technology from large platform\nvendors, the vision of BPM models becoming fully executable (and capable of\nsimulations and round-trip engineering) is coming closer to reality.\n","linknr":420,"url":"Business_process_modeling","recorded":1362477432,"links":39,"instances":["project_management"],"pdf":["http://www.archives.gov/records-mgmt/pdf/rm-profile.pdf","http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/assets/fea_docs/FEA_CRM_v23_Final_Oct_2007_Revised.pdf","http://www.gao.gov/special.pubs/bprag/bprag.pdf","http://www.idi.ntnu.no/grupper/su/publ/phd/Jorgensen-thesis.pdf","http://www.cit.gu.edu.au/~noran/Docs/UMLvsIDEF.pdf","http://www.bptrends.com/publicationfiles/05-06-ART-ProcessModeling21stCent-Recker1.pdf","http://ryanko.files.wordpress.com/2008/03/bpm-journal-koleelee-bpms-survey.pdf","https://lirias.kuleuven.be/bitstream/123456789/162944/1/KBI_0728.pdf"],"categories":["Business models","Design","Enterprise modelling","Process management","Systems engineering"],"headings":["History","BPM topics","Business process modeling tools","Related topics","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/Government_Business_Reference_Model.svg/360px-Government_Business_Reference_Model.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/01/Process_and_data_modeling.svg/320px-Process_and_data_modeling.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/Business_Process_Reengineering_Cycle.svg/220px-Business_Process_Reengineering_Cycle.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Emblem-money.svg/28px-Emblem-money.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/12px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/12px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["task","project_management"]],"members":["task"],"related":["Systems_engineering","Process_modeling","Information_Technology","Change_management","Flow_chart","Functional_flow_block_diagram","Control_flow_diagram","Gantt_chart","PERT","IDEF","Unified_Modeling_Language","Business_Process_Modeling_Notation","Systems_engineering","Business_process","Business_process","Business_process_redesign","Business_process_management","Integrated_business_planning","Software_engineering","Software_process","Software_development","Object_Oriented","Business_model","Value_chain","Business_process","Task_(project_management)","Corporate_governance","Strategic_management","Core_business","Purchasing","Manufacturing","Marketing","Sales","Accounting","Recruitment","Technical_support","Scientific_modelling","Workflow","Artifact-centric_business_process_model","Use_case_diagram","Ivar_Jacobson","Unified_Modeling_Language","Activity_diagram","Business_Process_Model_and_Notation","CogNIAM","Event-driven_process_chain","IDEF","IDEF0","Unified_Modeling_Language","Eriksson-Penker","Business_Process_Model_and_Notation","Business_Process_Execution_Language","BPEL","Web_Services_Choreography_Description_Language","WS-CDL","XML_Process_Definition_Language","XPDL","Architecture_of_Integrated_Information_Systems","Java_Process_Definition_Language","JBPM","Model-driven_architecture","Service-oriented_architecture","Business_reference_model","Business","Tertiary_sector_of_the_economy","Government_agency","Reference_model","Reference_model","Function_model","Organizational_chart","Business_model","Data_model","Software_code","Business_analysis","Business_process_reengineering","Business_efficiency","Business_process","Business_process_management","Management","Holism","Business_architecture","Business_Model_Canvas","Business_plan","Business_process_mapping","Business_Process_Model_and_Notation","Artifact-centric_business_process_model","Capability_Maturity_Model_Integration","Extended_Enterprise_Modeling_Language","Generalised_Enterprise_Reference_Architecture_and_Methodology","Model_Driven_Engineering","Value_Stream_Mapping","Jan_Vanthienen"]}
