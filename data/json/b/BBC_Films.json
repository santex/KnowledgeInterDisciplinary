It has produced or co-\nproduced some of the most successful British films of recent years, including\n[[An Education]], [[StreetDance 3D]], [[Fish Tank (film)|Fish Tank]], [[Stage\nBeauty]], [[A Cock and Bull Story]], [[Nativity! (film)|Nativity!]] and [[Match\nPoint (film)|Match Point]].\n\nBBC Films co-produces around eight films a year, working in partnership with\nmajor international and UK distributors. Christine Langan is Head of BBC Films,\nresponsible for the development and production slate, strategy and business\noperations.\n\nRecent titles include Nigel Cole's [[Made in Dagenham]], Stephen Frearsâ\n[[Tamara Drewe]], Debs Gardner-Patersonâs [[Africa United (2010 film)|Africa\nUnited]], Max and Daniaâs [[StreetDance]], which was Britainâs first-ever\n3-D movie.\n\nUntil 2007, BBC Films was based in Mortimer Street, near Broadcasting House in\nLondon, while still under the full control of the BBC. A re-structuring of the\ndivision integrated it into the main BBC Fiction department of BBC Vision. As a\nresult, it moved out of its independent offices into Television Centre, and its\nhead David M. Thompson left to start his own film production company.\n","linknr":507,"url":"BBC_Films","recorded":1362582076,"links":28,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["BBC Films films|","Film production companies of the United Kingdom"],"headings":["Productions","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4d/BBC_Films_logo.jpg/220px-BBC_Films_logo.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/eb/BBC.svg/32px-BBC.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/eb/BBC.svg/80px-BBC.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/12px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg/16px-Portal-puzzle.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/People_icon.svg/16px-People_icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/UKfilm.svg/100px-UKfilm.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/12px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["BBC","United_Kingdom","Christine_Langan","Broadcasting_House","Television_Centre","David_M._Thompson","Walt_Disney_Pictures","Warner_Bros.","Icon_Productions","StreetDance_3D","Columbia_Pictures","Film_Finance_Corporation_Australia","Pathé","Warner_Bros.","UK_Film_Council","Screen_Australia","Film_Finance_Corporation_Australia","Tiger_Aspect_Productions","Miramax_Films","Screen_Australia","DreamWorks_Pictures","Focus_Features","Company_Pictures","Qwerty_Films","Code_46","Miramax_Films","Intermedia_Films","Working_Title_Films","BBC"]}
