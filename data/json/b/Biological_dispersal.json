Through simply moving from one\nhabitat patch to another, the dispersal of an individual has consequences not\nonly for individual fitness, but also for population dynamics, population\ngenetics, and species distribution.

Understanding dispersal and the consequences both for\nevolutionary strategies at a species level, and for processes at an ecosystem\nlevel, requires understanding on the type of dispersal, the dispersal range of a\ngiven species, and the dispersal mechanisms involved.\n\n'Biological dispersal' may be contrasted with geodispersal, which is the mixing\nof previously isolated populations (or whole biotas) following the erosion of\ngeographic barriers to dispersal or gene flow (Lieberman, 2005; Lieberman,\n2005.
