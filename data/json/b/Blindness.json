Various scales have been developed to\ndescribe the extent of vision loss and define blindness. International Council of Ophthalmology.\n[http://www.icoph.org/pdf/visualstandardsreport.pdf \"International Standards:\nVisual Standards â Aspects and Ranges of Vision Loss with Emphasis on Population\nSurveys.\"] April 2002. Total blindness is the complete lack of form and\nvisual light perception and is clinically recorded as NLP, an abbreviation for\n\"no light perception.\" Blindness is frequently used to describe\nsevere visual impairment with vision. Those described as having only light\nperception have no more sight than the ability to tell light from dark and the\ngeneral direction of a light source.\n\nTo determine which people may need special assistance because of their visual\ndisabilities, various governmental jurisdictions have formulated more complex\ndefinitions referred to as legal blindness.

Retrieved 31 March 2006. In North\nAmerica and most of Europe, legal blindness is defined as visual acuity (vision)\nof 20/200 (6/60) or less in the better eye with best correction possible. This\nmeans that a legally blind individual would have to stand from an object to see\nitâwith corrective lensesâwith the same degree of clarity as a normally sighted\nperson could from . In many areas, people with average acuity who nonetheless\nhave a visual field of less than 20 degrees (the norm being 180 degrees) are\nalso classified as being legally blind. Approximately ten percent of those\ndeemed legally blind, by any measure, have no vision. The rest have some vision,\nfrom light perception alone to relatively good acuity. Low vision is sometimes\nused to describe visual acuities from 20/70 to 20/200.\n\nBy the 10th Revision of the WHO International Statistical Classification of\nDiseases, Injuries and Causes of Death, low vision is defined as visual acuity\nof less than 20/60 (6/18), but equal to or better than 20/200 (6/60), or\ncorresponding visual field loss to less than 20 degrees, in the better eye with\nbest possible correction. Blindness is defined as visual acuity of less than\n20/400 (6/120), or corresponding visual field loss to less than 10 degrees, in\nthe better eye with best possible correction. http://www3.who.int/icd/currentversion/fr-\nicd.htm\n\nBlind people with undamaged eyes may still register light non-visually for the\npurpose of circadian entrainment to the 24-hour light/dark cycle. Light signals\nfor this purpose travel through the retinohypothalamic tract and are not\naffected by optic nerve damage beyond where the retinohypothalamic tract exits.\n","linknr":837,"url":"Blindness","recorded":1362482109,"links":110,"instances":["right_of_way","sport","angle","archangel","author","marvel_comics","vision","play","chronobiology","sport"],"pdf":["http://www.icoph.org/pdf/visualstandardsreport.pdf","http://www.who.int/blindness/Change%20the%20Definition%20of%20Blindness.pdf","http://www.coe.ufl.edu/copsse/docs/IB-10/1/IB-10.pdf","http://www.ssa.gov/history/pdf/80chap12.pdf","http://www.dh.gov.uk/prod_consum_dh/groups/dh_digitalassets/documents/digitalasset/dh_078294.pdf"],"categories":["Blindness|","Visual
