Plant form: an illustrated guide to flowering plant\n morphology. Oxford University Press, Oxford, U.K.  The leaves often\n function as food storage organs during dormancy.\n\nA bulb's leaf bases, also known as scales, generally do not support leaves, but\ncontain food reserves to enable the plant to survive adverse conditions. At the\ncenter of the bulb is a vegetative growing point or an unexpanded flowering\nshoot. The base is formed by a stem, and plant growth occurs from this basal\nplate. Roots emerge from the underside of the base, and new stems and leaves\nfrom the upper side. 'Tunicate' bulbs have dry, membranous outer scales that\nprotect the continuous lamina of fleshy scales. Species\nin the genera [[Allium]], [[Hippeastrum]], [[Narcissus (plant)|Narcissus]], and\n[[Tulip]]a all have tunicate bulbs. Non-tunicate bulbs, such as [[Lilium]] and\n[[Fritillaria]] species, lack the protective tunic and have looser scales.\n\nOther types of storage organs (such as corms, rhizomes, and tubers) are\nsometimes erroneously referred to as bulbs. The technical term for plants that\nform underground storage organs, including bulbs as well as tubers and corms, is\n'[[geophyte]]'. Some epiphytic orchids (family Orchidaceae) form above-ground\nstorage organs called '[[pseudobulb]]s', that superficially resemble bulbs.\n\nNearly all plants that form true bulbs are monocotyledons, and include: *Onion,\ngarlic, and other ''Allia'', family Alliaceae. *Lily, tulip, and many other\nmembers of the lily family Liliaceae. *[[Amaryllis]], [[Hippeastrum]],\n[[Narcissus (genus)|Narcissus]], and several other members of the amaryllis\nfamily Amaryllidaceae. *Two groups of [[Iris (plant)|Iris]] species, family\nIridaceae: subgenus [[Iris xiphium|Xiphium]] (the \"Dutch\" irises) and subgenus\n[[Iris hermodactyloides|Hermodactyloides]] (the miniature \"rock garden\" irises).\n[[Oxalis]], in the family Oxalidaceae, is the only dicotyledon genus that\nproduces true bulbs.\n\nBulbous plant species cycle through vegetative and reproductive growth stages;\nthe bulb grows to flowering size during the vegetative stage and the plant\nflowers during the reproductive stage. Certain environmental conditions are\nneeded to trigger the transition from one stage to the next, such as the shift\nfrom a cold winter to spring.\n","linknr":193,"url":"Bulb","recorded":1362482836,"links":52,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Plant morphology","Plant reproduction"],"headings":["Bulbil","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/53/Shallots-Whole.jpg/250px-Shallots-Whole.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Amaryllisbulb.jpg/250px-Amaryllisbulb.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d1/Lilium_lancifolium_bulbils.jpg/90px-Lilium_lancifolium_bulbils.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/da/Alliumvineale1web.jpg/101px-Alliumvineale1web.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7c/Allium_fistulosum_bulbifera0.jpg/120px-Allium_fistulosum_bulbifera0.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Leaf","Food","Storage_organ","Dormancy","Plant_stem","Root","Corm","Rhizome","Tuber","Epiphyte","Orchid","Orchidaceae","Monocotyledon","Onion","Garlic","Allium","Alliaceae","Lily","Tulip","Liliaceae","Amaryllidaceae","Iridaceae","Oxalidaceae","Dicotyledon","Lilium","Axil","Garlic","Tree_onion","Pickling","Asplenium_bulbiferum","Tree_onion"]}
