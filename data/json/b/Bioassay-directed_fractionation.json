Fractions are\n  collected based on differences in a specific property of the individual\n  components. A common trait in fractionations is the need to find an optimum\n  between the amount of fractions collected and the desired purity in each\n  fraction. Fractionation makes it possible to isolate more than two components\n  in a mixture in a single run. This property sets it apart from other\n  separation techniques.\n\nFractionation is widely employed in many branches of science and technology.\nMixtures of liquids and gases are separated by fractional distillation by\ndifference in boiling point. Fractionation of components also takes place in\ncolumn chromatography by a difference in affinity between stationary phase and\nthe mobile phase. In fractional crystallization and fractional freezing,\nchemical substances are fractionated based on difference in solubility at a\ngiven temperature. In cell fractionation, cell components are separated by\ndifference in mass.\n","linknr":138,"url":"Bioassay-directed_fractionation","recorded":1362510387,"links":19,"instances":["chemistry","chemistry","biology","chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Chemical processes","Laboratory techniques","Unit operations"],"headings":["Fractionation of natural samples","Isotope fractionation","Dose fractionation","See also","References","Further readings"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/Fractional_distillation_lab_apparatus.svg/220px-Fractional_distillation_lab_apparatus.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d8/Differentielle_zentrifugation.gif/220px-Differentielle_zentrifugation.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["fraction","chemistry"],["stationary_phase","chemistry"],["fractional_crystallization","chemistry"],["cell","biology"]],"members":["stationary_phase","fractional_crystallization","cell","fraction"],"related":["Conical_flask","Fractionating_column","Separation_process","Mixture","Isotope","Fraction_(chemistry)","Gradient","Fractional_distillation","Column_chromatography","Stationary_phase_(chemistry)","Mobile_phase","Fractional_crystallization_(chemistry)","Fractional_freezing","Chemical_substance","Cell_fractionation","Cell_(biology)","Mass","Pharmacognosy","Bioassay","Palm_oil","Palm_kernel_oil","Mango_oil","Milk","Milk_protein_concentrate","Milk_basic_protein","List_of_purification_methods_in_chemistry","Copurification"]}
