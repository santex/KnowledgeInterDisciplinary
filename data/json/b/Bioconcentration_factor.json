{"cursor":"1680","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Bioconcentration factor' ('BCF') is the concentration of a particular chemical\nin a biological tissue per concentration of that chemical in water surrounding\nthat tissue. That is, a dimensionless number representing how much of a chemical\nis in a tissue relative to how much of that chemical exists in the environment.\n\nBCF = \\frac{Concentration_{Organism}}{Concentration_{Environment}}\n\nThis physical property characterizes the accumulation of chemicals, including\npollutants, through chemical partitioning from the aqueous phase into an organic\nphase. This may occur as in gills of a fish, or cell walls of aqueous plants.\n\nIn the context of setting exposure criteria it is generally understood that the\nterms \"BCF\" and \"steady-state BCF\"' are synonymous. A steady-state condition\noccurs when the organism is exposed for a sufficient length of time that the\nratio does not change substantially.\n\nTissues with BCF greater than 1,000 are considered high, and under 250 low, with\nthose between classified as moderate.
