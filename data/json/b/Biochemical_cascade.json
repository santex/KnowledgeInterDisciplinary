Nic, M.; Jirat, J.;\nKosata, B., eds. (2006) Chemical Reaction. IUPAC Compendium of Chemical\nTerminology (Online ed.). These cascades facilitate the transformation or\ngeneration of complex molecules in small steps. At each step, various\ncontrolling factors are involved to regulate cellular reactions, responding\neffectively to cues about their changing internal and external environments.\nChemical reactions are orchestrated by complex molecular networks, which consist\nof proteins/enzymes or RNAs (second messengers), connected by activation or\nsynthesis in biological processes.
