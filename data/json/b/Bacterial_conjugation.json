{"cursor":"12880","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"Bacterial conjugation is the transfer of genetic material between bacterial\ncells by direct cell-to-cell contact or by a bridge-like connection between two\ncells. Discovered in 1946 by Joshua Lederberg and Edward\nTatum, conjugation is a mechanism of horizontal gene transfer as are\ntransformation and transduction although these two other mechanisms do not\ninvolve cell-to-cell contact.\n\nBacterial conjugation is often regarded as the bacterial equivalent of sexual\nreproduction or mating since it involves the exchange of genetic material.\nDuring conjugation the donor cell provides a conjugative or mobilizable genetic\nelement that is most often a plasmid or transposon. Most conjugative plasmids have systems ensuring that the\nrecipient cell does not already contain a similar element.\n\nThe genetic information transferred is often beneficial to the recipient.\nBenefits may include antibiotic resistance, xenobiotic tolerance or the ability\nto use new metabolites. Such beneficial plasmids may be\nconsidered bacterial endosymbionts. Other elements, however, may be viewed as\nbacterial parasites and conjugation as a mechanism evolved by them to allow for\ntheir spread.\n","linknr":300,"url":"Bacterial_conjugation","recorded":1362486620,"links":42,"instances":["biology","dna","genetics","genetics","genetics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Molecular biology","Biotechnology","Antibiotic resistance"],"headings":["Mechanism","Inter-kingdom transfer","Genetic Engineering Applications","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/Conjugation.svg/350px-Conjugation.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["transformation","genetics"],["transduction","genetics"],["locus","genetics"],["nick","dna"],["kingdom","biology"],["transduction","genetics"],["transformation","genetics"]],"members":["kingdom","nick","transduction","locus","transformation"],"related":["Joshua_Lederberg","Edward_Tatum","Horizontal_gene_transfer","Transformation_(genetics)","Transduction_(genetics)","Bacteria","Sexual_reproduction","Mating","Plasmid","Transposon","Antibiotic_resistance","Xenobiotic","Metabolites","Endosymbionts","Parasitism","Pilus","Prototypical","Episome","Chromosome","Kilo-base_pair","Origin_of_replication","Locus_(genetics)","Gene","Pilus","Protein","Nick_(DNA)","Rolling_circle","Lambda_phage","Genome","Diazotroph","Kingdom_(biology)","Opines","Agrobacterium_tumefaciens","Agrobacterium_rhizogenes","Endosymbiont","Transfer_gene","Virulence","Genetic_engineering","Mitochondria","Cellular_membrane","Tobacco_mosaic_virus","Herbaceous_plant","Dicot","Monocot","Transduction_(genetics)","Transfection","Transformation_(genetics)","Triparental_mating"]}
