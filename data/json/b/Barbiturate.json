{"cursor":"24647","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":", the basic structure of all barbiturates]] 'Barbiturates' are drugs that act as\ncentral nervous system depressants, and can therefore produce a wide spectrum of\neffects, from mild sedation to total anesthesia. They are also effective as\nanxiolytics, hypnotics, and anticonvulsants. Barbiturates also have analgesic\neffects, however these effects are somewhat weak, preventing barbiturates from\nbeing used in surgery in the absence of other analgesics. They have addiction\npotential, both physical and psychological. Barbiturates have now largely been\nreplaced by benzodiazepines in routine medical practice - for example, in the\ntreatment of anxiety and insomnia â mainly because benzodiazepines are\nsignificantly less dangerous in overdose. However, barbiturates are still used\nin general anesthesia, for epilepsy, and assisted suicide.\nBarbiturates are derivatives of barbituric acid.\n","linknr":1147,"url":"Barbiturate","recorded":1362665665,"links":54,"instances":["chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Anticonvulsants","Anxiolytics","Barbiturates|","Depressogenics","Hypnotics","German inventions|Barbiturates","GABA agonists"],"headings":["History","Therapeutic uses","Mechanism of action","Tolerance, dependence, overdose, and adverse reaction","Recreational use","Legal status","Other uses in chemistry","Examples","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/Kwas_barbiturowy.svg/220px-Kwas_barbiturowy.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1f/Barbiturates_generic_numbered.svg/220px-Barbiturates_generic_numbered.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5f/Tabletten.JPG/32px-Tabletten.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["condensation","chemistry"]],"members":["condensation"],"related":["Pharmaceutical_drug","Central_nervous_system","Depressant","Sedation","Anesthesia","Anxiolytic","Hypnotic","Anticonvulsant","Analgesic","Surgery","Benzodiazepine","Drug_overdose","Barbituric_acid","Barbituric_acid","Germany","Adolf_von_Baeyer","Condensation_(chemistry)","Urea","Diethyl_malonate","Ester","Acid","Apple","Tavern","Artillery","Garrison","Saint_Barbara","Bayer","Franz_Joseph_Emil_Fischer","Joseph_von_Mering","Barbital","Trade_name","Veronal","Italy","Verona","Central_nervous_system","Anesthesia","Anxiety","Insomnia","Benzodiazepines","Anticonvulsants","Codeine","Ethylmorphine","Phenobarbital","Luminal","Phenobarbital","Anxiolytics","Hypnotics","Benzodiazepines","Drug_overdose","Physician-assisted_suicide","Muscle_relaxant","Euthanasia","Capital_punishment","Lethal_injection","Thiopental","GABAA","GABA","Mammal","Central_nervous_system","GABA","Benzodiazepine","AMPA_receptor","Glutamate_receptor","Ca2+","GABAA","Benzodiazepines","Drug_tolerance","Marilyn_Monroe","Dalida","Judy_Garland","Jean_Seberg","Jimi_Hendrix","Kenneth_Williams","Stevens–Johnson_syndrome","Ethanol","Euphoria","Drug_intoxication","Drowsiness","Vertical_direction","Pathologic_nystagmus","Slurred_speech","Ataxia","Amobarbital","Pentobarbital","Secobarbital","Tuinal","Animal_euthanasia","Drug_overdose","United_States","Controlled_Substances_Act","Pentobarbital","Secobarbital","Amobarbital","Butabarbital","Convention_on_Psychotropic_Substances","Vienna","Amphetamine","Treaty","Secobarbital","Amobarbital","Butalbital","Cyclobarbital","Pentobarbital","Allobarbital","Methylphenobarbital","Phenobarbital","Vinylbital","Convention_on_Psychotropic_Substances","Hydrogen_bonds","Cyanuric_acid","Supramolecular_chemistry","Allobarbital","Allyl","Allyl","Amobarbital","Ethyl_group","Isopentyl","Aprobarbital","Allyl","Isopropyl","Alphenal","Allyl","Phenyl","Barbital","Ethyl_group","Ethyl_group","Brallobarbital","Allyl","Allyl","Phenobarbital","Ethyl_group","Phenyl","Benzodiazepines","Dille–Koppanyi_reagent","Zwikker_reagent"]}
