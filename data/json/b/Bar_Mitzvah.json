Bar \"××¨\"\nis a Jewish Babylonian Aramaic word literally meaning son, in Hebrew it's Ben\n\"××\". Bat \"××ª\" is Hebrew for girl, and Mitzvah \"××¦××\" is a commandment and a\nlaw. While this literally translates to \"son of commandment\" or \"daughter of\ncommandment\", the rabbinical phrase \"bar\" means here \"under the category of\" or\n\"subject to\", making \"Bar Mitzvah\" translate to \"an [agent] who is subject to\nthe law\". According to Jewish law, when Jewish boys become 13, they become\naccountable for their actions and become a Bar Mitzvah (plural: B'nai Mitzvah).\nA Bat Mitzvah occurs when Jewish girls become 13 (in some places, 12), and it\nmeans the same as it does for boys- a rite of passage from being considered\nunable to properly understand the Torah to being considered old enough to begin\nto understand and thus for boys and girls alike to be treated more like adults.\nIn addition to being considered accountable for their actions from a religious\nperspective, B'nai mitzvah may be counted towards a minyan (prayer quorum) and\nmay lead prayer and other religious services in the family and the community.\nThe age of B'nai Mitzvah was selected because it roughly coincides with physical\npuberty. Niddah, 45b. Prior to a child reaching Bar or Bat Mitzvah,\nthe child's parents hold the responsibility for the child's actions. After this\nage, children bear their own responsibility for Jewish ritual law, tradition,\nand ethics and are able to participate in all areas of Jewish community\nlife. Traditionally, the father of the Bar Mitzvah boy gives thanks to [God]\nthat he is no longer punished for the child's sins.
