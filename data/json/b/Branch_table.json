{"cursor":"15060","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In computer programming, a 'branch table' (sometimes known as a 'jump table')\nis a type of efficient method of transferring program control (branching) to\nanother part of a program (or a different program that may have been\ndynamically loaded) using a table of branch instructions. It is a form of\nmultiway branch. The branch table construction is commonly used when\nprogramming in assembly language but may also be generated by a compiler,\nespecially when implementing an optimized switch statement (where known, small\nranges are involved with few gaps).\n","linknr":195,"url":"Branch_table","recorded":1362559791,"links":14,"instances":["computing","computer_science","computer_science","computer_science","programming_language","computers","computer_programming","mathematics","computer_science"],"pdf":["http://www.rmbconsulting.us/Publications/PointerToFunction.pdf"],"categories":["Computer performance","Conditional constructs","Articles with example C code"],"headings":["Typical implementation","Alternative implementation using addresses","History","Advantages","Disadvantages","Example","Jump table example in C","Jump table example in PL/I","Compiler generated branch tables","Creating the index for the branch table","Other uses of technique","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["branch","computer_science"],["instruction","computer_science"],["offset","computer_science"],["multiple","mathematics"],["instruction","computer_science"],["offset","computer_science"],["pointer","computer_programming"],["function","computing"],["memory","computers"],["library","computer_science"],["library","computer_science"],["c","programming_language"]],"members":["function","library","instruction","branch","c","memory","pointer","multiple","offset"],"related":["Computer_programming","Branch_(computer_science)","Instruction_(computer_science)","Multiway_branch","Assembly_language","Compiler","Switch_statement","Unconditional_branch","Offset_(computer_science)","Multiple_(mathematics)","Sequential","Machine_code","Instruction_(computer_science)","Raw_data","Sequential","Data_validation","Offset_(computer_science)","Shifting","Addition","Program_counter","Processor_register","Instruction_set","Array_data_structure","Pointer_(computer_programming)","Function_(computing)","Dispatch_table","Virtual_method_table","Threaded_code","Control_table","Late_binding","Raw_data","Memory_(computers)","CPU","Embedded_system","Operating_system","System_call","Library_(computer_science)","Integer","Computer_architecture","IBM/360","Interrupt","Call_site","Program_flow","Algorithmic_efficiency","Code","Data_compression","Library_(computer_science)","Integer","Entry_point","Indirection","PIC_microcontroller","PL/I","Binary_chop","Computer_data_storage","Computed_goto","Hash_table","Raw_data","Raw_data","ASCII","Optimizing_compiler","Just-in-time_compilation","Loop_unrolling","Dispatch_table","Late_binding","Function_pointer","Lookup_table","Switch_statement","Virtual_method_table","Wikibooks","IBM_S/360","C_(programming_language)","C++"]}
