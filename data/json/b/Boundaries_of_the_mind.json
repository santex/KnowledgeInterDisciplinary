{"cursor":"7588","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Boundaries of the mind' refers to a personality trait concerning the degree of\nseparateness (âthicknessâ) or connection (âthinnessâ) between mental functions\nand processes. Thin boundaries are associated with open-mindedness, sensitivity,\nvulnerability, creativity, and artistic ability. People with thin boundaries may\ntend to confuse fantasy and reality and tend to have a fluid sense of identity,\nso that they tend to merge or lose themselves in their relations with others.\nPeople with thick boundaries differentiate clearly between reality and fantasy\nand between self and other, and tend to prefer well-defined social\nstructures. The concept was developed by psychoanalyst\nErnest Hartmann from his observations of the personality characteristics of\nfrequent nightmare sufferers. The construct has been\nparticularly studied in relation to dream recall and\nlucid dreaming.\n","linknr":167,"url":"Boundaries_of_the_mind","recorded":1362889628,"links":10,"instances":["human","social_science","psychology","psychology","psychology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Personality traits"],"headings":["Thin versus thick boundaries","Measurement","Relationship to other personality traits","Psychopathology","Dreaming","New age beliefs","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["sensitivity","human"],["fantasy","psychology"],["identity","social_science"],["splitting","psychology"],["absorption","psychology"]],"members":["sensitivity","identity","splitting","absorption","fantasy"],"related":["Personality_trait","Sensitivity_(human)","Vulnerability","Creativity","Fantasy_(psychology)","Reality","Identity_(social_science)","Self","Other","Social_structures","Nightmare","Lucid_dreaming","Nightmares","William_James","Splitting_(psychology)","Five_Factor_Model","Openness_to_experience","Neuroticism","Extraversion","Conscientiousness","Absorption_(psychology)","Transliminality","Hypnotic_susceptibility","Suggestibility","Myers-Briggs_Type_Indicator","Schizotypal_personality_disorder","Borderline_personality_disorder","Obsessive-compulsive_disorder","Minnesota_Multiphasic_Personality_Inventory","Paranoia","Dream","New_age","Yoga","Reiki","Divination","Astrology","Schizotypy","Magical_thinking","Personal_boundaries"]}
