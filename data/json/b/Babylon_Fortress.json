{"cursor":"4156","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Babylon Fortress' was an ancient fortress city or castle in the Delta of Egypt,\nlocated at Babylon in the area today known as Coptic Cairo. It was situated in\nthe Heliopolite Nome, upon the right (eastern) bank of the Nile, at latitude\n30Â°N, near the commencement of the Pharaonic Canal (also called Ptolemy's Canal\nand Trajan's Canal), from the Nile to the Red Sea.\n\nIt was at the boundary between Lower and Middle Egypt, where the river craft\npaid tolls when ascending or descending the Nile. Diodorus ascribes the erection\nof the first fort to rebel Assyrian captives in the reign of Sesostris, and\nCtesias (Persica) dates it to the time of Semiramis; but Josephus (l. c.), with\ngreater probability, attributes its structure to some Babylonian followers of\nCambyses, in 525 BC. The Romans built a new fortress with typically Roman red\nand white banded masonry nearer to the river.\n\nWithin the fortress' enclosure are the Coptic Museum, a convent, and several\nchurches, including the Church of St. George and the Hanging Church.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Babylon_Fortress","recorded":1375087031,"links":[],"instances":["ancient","cairo","egypt"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Ancient Greek sites in Egypt","Roman legions' camps in Egypt","Roman sites in Egypt","Old Cairo","Coptic Cairo","Castles in Egypt"],"headings":["The name","Situation","Roman era and later","Photographs of Babylon fortress","See also","References"],"image":[],"tags":[["babylon","egypt"],["church_of_st._george","cairo"],["heliopolis","ancient"]],"members":["heliopolis","babylon"],"related":["Nile_Delta","Egypt","Babylon_(Egypt)","Coptic_Cairo","Heliopolite_Nome","Nile","30th_parallel_north","Trajan","Red_Sea","Lower_Egypt","Middle_Egypt","Assyria","Sesostris","Ctesias","Semiramis","Cambyses","Ancient_Rome","Coptic_Museum","Church_of_St._George_(Cairo)","Hanging_Church","Babylon","Mesopotamia","Heliopolis_(ancient)","Hapy","Nile","30th_parallel_north","Red_Sea","Lower_Egypt","Middle_Egypt","Persia","Roman_Empire","Trajan","Nile","Augustus","Legio_XIII_Gemina","Antonine_Itinerary","Fostat","Old_Cairo","Champollion","Arab","'Amr_ibn_al-'As","Coptic_Cairo","Richard_Talbert","Barrington_Atlas_of_the_Greek_and_Roman_World"]}
