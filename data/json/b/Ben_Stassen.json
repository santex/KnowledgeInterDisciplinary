He founded nWave\nPictures in 1994, producing highly successful CGI ride films including the\ngroundbreaking [[Devils Mine]]. Starting in 1997, Ben Stassen began focusing on\nlarge format films usually screened at IMAX theaters, and made some of the most\nsuccessful large format films to date, including [[Thrill Ride: The Science of\nFun]] and [[Alien Adventure]]. Contrary to most large format films, which mix\neducation with spectacular visuals, most of Stassen's films are aimed\nexclusively at the entertainment market. As IMAX theaters around the world\nincreasingly became capable of screening stereoscopic (3-D) films in the late\nnineties, Stassen quickly embraced this new technology, and directed a\nsuccession of popular 3-D large format films, such as [[Encounter in the Third\nDimension]] and [[Haunted Castle (2001 film)|Haunted Castle]]. Upon screening\n\"Haunted Castle\", Imax corporation sent a fax to all the exhibitors warning them\nabout the content of the film. Imax went as far as labeling \"Haunted Castle\" as\ndegrading to the brand. This triggered a strong reaction from both the\nexhibitors and the press. The film was marketed as \"The film Imax corporation\ndoes not want you to see\". It went on the become a huge success worldwide.\n\nIn 2004, Stassen produced and directed \"Wild Safari\", the first 3D wildlife film\nfor the giant screen (Imax).\n\nnWave is also the leading producer and distributor of 3D ride films and 4D\nattraction films with over 30 titles in their library. Over 200,000 people a day\nsee one of nWave's films in theme parks, science centers, zoo, aquaria and musea\naround the world.\n\nBen Stassen's first feature length animated film, ''Fly Me to the Moon'', was\nreleased in North America on 15 August 2008 on both regular size and IMAX\nscreens, exclusively in 3-D. According to nWave, Fly Me to the Moon was the\nfirst animated film to be designed, created, and released solely in 3-D. The\nfilm was originally announced for the spring or summer of 2007. The delay is\nbelieved to be the result of the slow roll-out of 3-D projection technology.\n\nOn 7 May 2008, nWave announced that its next feature length animated film would\nbe titled Around the World in 50 Years and that it too would be directed by Ben\nStassen. It was released in 2010 titled [[Sammy's Adventures: The Secret\nPassage]].\n\nStassen was also involved in the production of several movies directed by famed\nCroatian film director Krsto PapiÄ, most notably \"My Uncle's Legacy\" (Å½ivot sa\nstricem), the film was nominated for a Golden Globe (Best Foreign Film\ncategory) in 1990.\n\nStassen is widely quoted as a leading pioneer of 3D cinema, considering 3D as\nthe 2nd revolution in the history of cinema, second only to the transition from\nsilent film to the talkies. He mostly refers to American 3D film as 2.5 D\ncinema. In his opinion most filmmakers do not make any effort to use 3D as a new\nlanguage of cinema. They simply shoot their 2D films with two cameras creating a\nlittle depth behind the screen with the odd in-your-face effect. He is also\nquite outspoken about the inadequacies of the 3D digital theaters. The essence\nof 3D cinema is its ability to greatly enhance the sense of immersion in the\nstory being told. But there is no way to achieve real immersion unless you have\nfloor-to-ceiling and wall-to-wall screens. The image must fill you field of\nvision as much as possible. The long term viability of 3D cinema will depend on\nthe exhibitors willingness to build theaters designed specifically for 3D\nimmersion.\n\nnWave Pictures is currently producing two 3D features. The sequel to Sammy's\nAdventures (\"Escape From Paradise\") and African Safari 3D, a live action 3D\nadventure documentary taking the audience from the cost of Skeleton Coast in\nNamibia to the top of the Kilimanjaro.\n","linknr":117,"url":"Ben_Stassen","recorded":1375059557,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Ben_Stassen&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Ben_Stassen&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ben_Stassen&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Template:Citation_needed","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/Belgium","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/92/Flag_of_Belgium_%28civil%29.svg/23px-Flag_of_Belgium_%28civil%29.svg.png","/wiki/Belgium","/w/index.php?title=NWave_Pictures&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Devils_Mine&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Thrill_Ride:_The_Science_of_Fun&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Alien_Adventure","/wiki/Encounter_in_the_Third_Dimension","/wiki/Haunted_Castle_(2001_film)","/wiki/Fly_Me_to_the_Moon_(Film)","/wiki/Sammy%27s_Adventures:_The_Secret_Passage","/wiki/Krsto_Papi%C4%87","/wiki/%C5%BDivot_sa_stricem","/w/index.php?title=Ben_Stassen&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Thrill_Ride:_The_Science_of_Fun&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Alien_Adventure","/wiki/Encounter_in_the_Third_Dimension","/wiki/Haunted_Castle_(2001_film)","/w/index.php?title=SOS_Planet&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Misadventures_in_3D&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Haunted_House_(short_film)","/w/index.php?title=Wild_Safari_3D&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=African_Adventure:_Safari_in_the_Okavango&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Fly_Me_to_the_Moon_(film)","/wiki/Sammy%27s_Adventures:_The_Secret_Passage","/wiki/Sammy%27s_Adventures:_Escape_from_Paradise","/w/index.php?title=Ben_Stassen&action=edit&section=2","http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0823721/","/wiki/Internet_Movie_Database","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/100340320","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","/wiki/Belgium","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ben_Stassen&oldid=544793456","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Belgian_film_directors","/wiki/Category:Belgian_animators","/wiki/Category:Living_people","/wiki/Category:Articles_needing_additional_references_from_August_2010","/wiki/Category:All_articles_needing_additional_references","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_hCards","/wiki/Category:Use_dmy_dates_from_August_2010","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/wiki/Category:Year_of_birth_missing_(living_people)","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Ben+Stassen&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Ben+Stassen","/wiki/Ben_Stassen","/wiki/Talk:Ben_Stassen","#","/wiki/Ben_Stassen","/w/index.php?title=Ben_Stassen&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Ben_Stassen&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Ben_Stassen","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Ben_Stassen","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Ben_Stassen&oldid=544793456","/w/index.php?title=Ben_Stassen&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q26200","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Ben_Stassen&id=544793456","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Ben+Stassen","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Ben+Stassen&oldid=544793456&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Ben_Stassen&printable=yes","//fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Stassen","//nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Stassen","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q26200#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Cr
