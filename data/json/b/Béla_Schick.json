He is the founder of the Schick test. Bela Schick was\nborn in BalatonboglÃ¡r, Hungary, and brought up in Graz, Austria, where he\nattended medical school. In 1902 he joined the Medicine Faculty of the\nUniversity of Vienna where he remained until 1923. Studying problems of\nimmunity, he and Clemens von Pirquet first coined the term 'allergy' as a\nclinical entity. His discovery of a test for susceptibility to diphtheria (\"the\nSchick test\") made him world famous. From 1923 he directed the Pediatric\nDepartment of Mount Sinai Hospital, New York. From 1936 he was also professor at\nColumbia University. From 1950 to 1962 Schick headed the Pediatric Department of\nBeth-El Hospital, Brooklyn, NY. His later interests included the nutrition of\nthe newborn and feeding problems in children.\n\nYoung Bela Schick quoted the Talmud: \"The world\nis kept alive by the breath of children,\" to help persuade his father to allow\nhim to pursue continued education in pediatrics, rather than to join the family\ngrain merchant business in Graz, Austria. Schick became assistant at the\nChildren's Clinic in Vienna, and later associate professor of pediatrics at\nVienna University.\n\nHe emigrated to the United States, and in 1923 became pediatrician-in-chief at\nNew York's Mount Sinai Hospital. He later (1936) was appointed clinical\nprofessor of pediatrics at Columbia University. Schick made important studies on\nscarlet fever, tuberculosis, and the nutrition for infants...but gained\ninternational renown for the Schick Test. This test determined susceptibility to\ndiphtheria, and eventually led to the eradication of the childhood disease that\nattacked 100,000 Americans in 1927, leading to about 10,000 deaths.\n\nA massive five-year campaign, coordinated by Dr. Schick, virtually eliminated\nthe dreaded disease that had taken countless young lives since it was first\nmentioned in the sixth century writings of AÃ«tius Amidenus. As a part of the\ncampaign, 85 million pieces of literature were distributed by Metropolitan Life\nInsurance Company. with an appeal to parents to \"Save your child from\ndiphtheria.\" These illustrated brochures (reproduced here) were created by a\ntalented young artist who had recently emigrated from Germany - Gerta Ries.\nRemarkably, this same Gerta Ries (Wiener) was commissioned over 75 years later\nto create the sculptured tribute to Dr. BÃ©la Schick for the Jewish-American\nHall of Fame. A residential building is named after him on the Stony Brook\nUniversity campus.\n","linknr":123,"url":"Béla_Schick","recorded":1374860256,"links":["/w/index.php?title=B%C3%A9la_Schick&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=B%C3%A9la_Schick&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Balatonbogl%C3%A1r","/wiki/Hungary","/wiki/Pediatrics","/wiki/Mount_Sinai_Hospital,_New_York","/wiki/Columbia_University","/w/index.php?title=Beth-El_Hospital&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Schick_test","/wiki/Hungary","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/Pediatrician","/wiki/Schick_test","/wiki/Balatonbogl%C3%A1r","/wiki/Hungary","/wiki/Graz,_Austria","/wiki/University_of_Vienna","/wiki/Clemens_von_Pirquet","/wiki/Allergy","/wiki/Schick_test","/wiki/Mount_Sinai_Hospital,_New_York","/wiki/New_York","/wiki/Columbia_University","/w/index.php?title=Beth-El_Hospital&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Brooklyn","/wiki/Talmud","#cite_note-urlThe_Talmud-1","/wiki/Columbia_University","/wiki/Scarlet_fever","/wiki/Tuberculosis","/wiki/Diphtheria","/wiki/A%C3%ABtius_Amidenus","/wiki/Metropolitan_Life_Insurance_Company","/w/index.php?title=Jewish-American_Hall_of_Fame&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Stony_Brook_University","/w/index.php?title=B%C3%A9la_Schick&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Serum_sickness","/w/index.php?title=B%C3%A9la_Schick&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-urlThe_Talmud_1-0","http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/talmud.htm","/w/index.php?title=B%C3%A9la_Schick&action=edit&section=3","http://www.infoplease.com/ce6/people/A0843931.html","http://www.amuseum.org/jahf/virtour/page18.html","http://www.discoveriesinmedicine.com/Ra-Thy/Schick-Test.html","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/37952543","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","/wiki/Balatonbogl%C3%A1r","/wiki/Hungary","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Béla_Schick&oldid=564743118","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1877_births","/wiki/Category:1967_deaths","/wiki/Category:People_from_Balatonbogl%C3%A1r","/wiki/Category:Hungarian_Jews","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=B%C3%A9la+Schick&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=B%C3%A9la+Schick","/wiki/B%C3%A9la_Schick","/wiki/Talk:B%C3%A9la_Schick","#","/wiki/B%C3%A9la_Schick","/w/index.php?title=B%C3%A9la_Schick&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=B%C3%A9la_Schick&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/B%C3%A9la_Schick","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/B%C3%A9la_Schick","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=B%C3%A9la_Schick&oldid=564743118","/w/index.php?title=B%C3%A9la_Schick&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1627710","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=B%C3%A9la_Schick&id=564743118","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=B%C3%A9la+Schick","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=B%C3%A9la+Schick&oldid=564743118&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=B%C3%A9la_Schick&printable=yes","//it.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9la_Schick","//pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9la_Schick","//pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9la_Schick","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1627710#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Cont
