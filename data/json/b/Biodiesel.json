{"cursor":"78894","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\n\n'Biodiesel' refers to a vegetable oil- or animal fat-based diesel fuel\nconsisting of long-chain alkyl (methyl, propyl or ethyl) esters. Biodiesel is\ntypically made by chemically reacting lipids (e.g., vegetable oil, animal fat\n(tallow )) with an alcohol producing\nfatty acid esters.\n\nBiodiesel is meant to be used in standard diesel engines and is thus distinct\nfrom the vegetable and waste oils used to fuel converted diesel engines.\nBiodiesel can be used alone, or blended with petrodiesel. Biodiesel can also be\nused as a low carbon alternative to heating oil.\n\nThe National Biodiesel Board (USA) also has a technical definition of\n\"biodiesel\" as a mono-alkyl ester. {{cite web
