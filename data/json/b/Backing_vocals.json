{"cursor":"6975","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n]] A 'backing vocalist' or 'backing singer' (or, especially in the U.S., 'backup\nsinger' or sometimes 'background singer' or 'harmony vocalist') is a singer who\nprovides vocal harmony with the lead vocalist or other backing vocalists. In\nsome cases, a backing singer may sing alone as a lead-in to the main vocalist's\nentry or a counter-melody. While some bands use performers whose sole on-stage\nrole is performing backing vocals, it is common for backup singers to have other\nroles. In many rock and metal bands, the musicians doing backup vocals also play\ninstruments, such as guitar, electric bass, drums, or keyboards. In Latin or Afro-\nCuban groups, backup singers may play percussion instruments or shakers while\nsinging. In some pop and hip-hop groups and in musical theater, the backup\nsingers may be required to perform elaborately-choreographed dance routines\nwhile they sing through headset microphones.\n","linknr":251,"url":"Backing_vocals","recorded":1362477698,"links":41,"instances":["band","singer","band","song","music","american_band","band","the_beatles_song","song","musician"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Occupations in music","Singing"],"headings":["Band members who sing backup vocals","Lead singers who record backup vocals","Unusual backing vocal styles","Career paths","See also","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/Ebony_Bones_backup_performer.jpg/220px-Ebony_Bones_backup_performer.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["latin","music"],["surfer_girl","song"],["nowhere_man","song"],["because","the_beatles_song"],["boston","band"],["robert_smith","musician"],["as_i_lay_dying","band"],["silverstein","band"],["finch","american_band"],["pink","singer"]],"members":["boston","pink","silverstein","surfer_girl","latin","finch","as_i_lay_dying","because","nowhere_man","robert_smith"],"related":["Singer","Vocal_harmony","Lead_vocalist","Counter-melody","Rock_music","Heavy_metal_music","Latin_(music)","Afro-Cuban","Hip_hop_music","Musical_theater","The_Beach_Boys","The_Beatles","The_Beach_Boys","In_My_Room","Surfer_Girl_(song)","Brian_Wilson","Mike_Love","Carl_Wilson","Al_Jardine","Dennis_Wilson","John_Lennon","Paul_McCartney","George_Harrison","Ringo_Starr","Hello,_Goodbye","The_Continuing_Story_of_Bungalow_Bill","Nowhere_Man_(song)","Because_(The_Beatles_song)","Day_Tripper","This_Boy","Crosby,_Stills,_Nash_&_Young","Bee_Gees","Guitarist","John_Frusciante","Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers","Anthony_Kiedis","The_Corrs","Backing_vocalists","Sebastien_Lefebvre","Rhythm_guitarist","David_Desrosiers","Bass_guitarist","Pop_music","Punk_rock","Simple_Plan","Zacky_Vengeance","Johnny_Christ","Synyster_Gates","The_Rev","Heavy_metal_music","Hard_rock","Avenged_Sevenfold","Overdubbing","Patrick_Stump","Fall_Out_Boy","Wednesday_13","Murderdolls","Ian_Gillan","Deep_Purple","Brad_Delp","Boston_(band)","Dan_Fogelberg","Eddie_Rabbitt","David_Bowie","Richard_Marx","Robert_Smith_(musician)","The_Cure","Metalcore","Post-hardcore","As_I_Lay_Dying_(band)","Alexisonfire","Haste_the_Day","Silverstein_(band)","Harsh_vocals","Clean_vocals","Hawthorne_Heights","Finch_(American_band)","Pop_music","R&B","Mariah_Carey","Michael_Jackson","Janet_Jackson","Beyonc√©_Knowles","Brandy_Norwood","Faith_Evans","D'Angelo","Amerie","Brian_\"Head\"_Welch","Lead_guitarist","KoRn","Ball_Tongue","Jonathan_Davis","Scat_singing","Deathcore","Despised_Icon","Death_grunt","Rap_music","Hype_man","Ace_Frehley","Richard_Marx","Mariah_Carey","Cher","Gwen_Stefani","Pink_(singer)","Whitney_Houston","Phil_Collins","Sheryl_Crow","Dave_Grohl","Jerry_Only","Jerry_Cantrell","Elton_John","Nebenstimme","Vocaloid","Uncredited_background_singer"]}
