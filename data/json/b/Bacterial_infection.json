This article deals with human pathogenic bacteria.\n\nAlthough the vast majority of bacteria are harmless or beneficial, quite a few\nbacteria are pathogenic. One of the bacterial diseases with highest disease\nburden is tuberculosis, caused by the bacterium [[Mycobacterium\ntuberculosis]], which kills about 2 million people a year, mostly in sub-\nSaharan Africa. Pathogenic bacteria contribute to other globally important\ndiseases, such as pneumonia, which can be caused by bacteria such as\n[[Streptococcus]] and [[Pseudomonas]], and foodborne illnesses, which can be\ncaused by bacteria such as [[Shigella]], [[Campylobacter]], and\n[[Salmonella]]. Pathogenic bacteria also cause infections such as tetanus,\ntyphoid fever, diphtheria, syphilis, and leprosy.\n\nKoch's postulates are criteria designed to establish a causal relationship\nbetween a causative microbe and a disease.\n","linknr":1405,"url":"Bacterial_infection","recorded":1362500908,"links":37,"instances":["microbiology","circulatory","bacterium","biology","biology","microbiology","injury","disease","epidemiology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Bacterial
