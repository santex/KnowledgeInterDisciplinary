Though sharing some of the facilities of the domestic services,\nparticularly for news and current affairs output, the World Service has a\nseparate Managing Director, and its operating costs have historically been\nfunded mainly by direct grants from the British government. These grants were\ndetermined independently of the domestic licence fee and were usually awarded\nfrom the budget of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. As such, the BBC's\ninternational content has traditionally represented – at least in part – an\neffective foreign policy tool of the British Government. The recent BBC World\nService spending review has announced plans for the funding for the world\nservice to be drawn from the domestic licence fee.\n\nThe Corporation's guaranteed income from the licence fee and the World Service\ngrants are supplemented by profits from commercial operations through a wholly\nowned subsidiary, BBC Worldwide Ltd. The company's activities include programme-\nand format-sales. The BBC also earns additional income from selling certain programme-\nmaking services through BBC Studios and Post Production Ltd., formerly BBC\nResources Ltd, another wholly owned trading subsidiary of the corporation. Most\nof the BBC's magazine and book publishing activities were sold in 2011.<ref>Mark\nSweney.
