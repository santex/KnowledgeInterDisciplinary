{"cursor":"21610","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\n'Androgenic hair', colloquially 'body hair', is the terminal hair that develops\non the human body during and after puberty. It is differentiated from the head\nhair and less visible vellus hair, which are much finer and lighter in color.\nThe growth of androgenic hair is related to the level of androgens (male\nhormones) in the individual. Due to a normally higher level of androgen, men\ntend to have more androgenic hair than women.\n\nFrom childhood onward, regardless of gender, vellus hair covers almost the\nentire area of the human body. Exceptions include the lips, the backs of the\nears, the palms of hands, the soles of the feet, certain external genital areas,\nthe navel and scar tissue. The density of hair – the number of hair\nfollicles per area of skin – varies from person to person. In many cases,\nareas on the human body that contain vellus hair will begin to produce darker,\nthicker body hair. An example of this is the growth of an adolescent's beard on\na once smooth chin.\n\nAndrogenic hair follows the same growth pattern as the hair that grows on the\nscalp, only the anagen phase is shorter, and the telogen phase is longer. While\nthe anagen phase for the hair on one's head lasts for years, the androgenic hair\ngrowing phase lasts a few months. (Hair Growth:\nEMedicine Otolaryngology and Facial Plastic Surgery) The telogen phase for\nbody hair lasts close to a year. This shortened\ngrowing period and extended dormant period explains why the hair on the head\ntends to be much longer than other hair found on the body. Differences in length\nseen in comparing the hair on the back of the hand and pubic hair, for example,\ncan be explained by varied growth cycles in those two regions. The same goes for\ndifferences in body hair length seen in different people, especially when\ncomparing men and women.\n","linknr":567,"url":"Body_hair","recorded":1362373442,"links":35,"instances":["sport"],"pdf":["http://jap.physiology.org/cgi/reprint/36/2/256.pdf"],"categories":["Hair anatomy","Human development"],"headings":["Development and growth","Growth distribution","Function","Evolution","Across populations","See also","Notes"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6e/Androgenic_hair.svg/220px-Androgenic_hair.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/20/Adolescent_leg_hair.jpg/220px-Adolescent_leg_hair.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3c/Congo_warrior_Negroid_Negroe_Black_African_spear_couple.png/200px-Congo_warrior_Negroid_Negroe_Black_African_spear_couple.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/Hairy_Ainu_man_Mongoloid.png/200px-Hairy_Ainu_man_Mongoloid.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["swimming","sport"]],"members":["swimming"],"related":["Terminal_hair","Human","Body","Puberty","Hair","Vellus_hair","Androgen","Hormone","Childhood","Gender","Ear","Hand","Foot","Genitals","Navel","Scar","Hair_follicle","Area","Human_hair_growth","Testosterone","Pubic_hair","Sexual_differentiation","Facial_hair","Chest_hair","Abdominal_hair","Leg_hair","Arm_hair","Foot_hair","Forearms","Hand","Arm","Upper_arm","Toes","Leg_shaving","Swimming_(sport)","Track_and_field","Bicycling","Bodybuilding","Road_rash","Pubic_hair","Desmond_Morris","Genital","Puberty","Pituitary_gland","Gonadotropin","Muslim","Facial_hair","Face","Masculine","Moustache","Human_evolution","Keratin","Amino_acids","Goose_bumps","Arrector_pili_muscle","Pigmentation","University_of_Jyväskylä","Finland","Liverpool_Polytechnic","Quadrupedalism","Savannah","Mammal","Bipedalism","University_of_Jyväskylä","Finland","Stanley_Marion_Garn","Harvard_University","Beard","Abdomen","Chest","Gluteal_muscles","Sacrum","Lower_back","Back","Phalanges","Ainu_people","Ashley_Montagu","Mongoloid_race","Bushmen","Negroid_race","Caucasoid_race","Neoteny","Mediterranean_race","Arnold_Henry_Savage_Landor","Ainu_people","Mildred_Trotter","Washington_University","White_people","Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas","Chinese_people","Negroe","White_people","Ainu_people","University_of_Niš","Serbia","Peoples_of_the_Caucasus","Negroid_race","Hamburg","Germany","Kavango_people","!Kung","Black_Africans","Europeans","Androgen","Estradiol","Metabolism","Sex_hormone","University_of_Bradford","Vellus_hair","Terminal_hair","Androgen","Hair_follicle","5α-reductase","Stanford_University","Caucasoid_race","Negroid_race","Mongoloid_race","Phalanges","Andamanese","Eskimo","Ethiopian_people","Mexican_people","Yucatan","Penobscot_people","Shinnecook_people","Gurkha","Japanese_people","Hindu","Egyptian_people","Near_Eastern","Joseph_Deniker","Ainu_people","Iranian_people","Australian_aborigine","Toda_people","Dravidian_people","Melanesian_people","Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas","Bushmen","Black_people","Mongoloid_race","Malay_people","Alopecia","Hair_removal","Hirsutism","Human_hair_color","Trichotillomania"]}
