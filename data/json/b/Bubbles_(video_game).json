It is an action game that features two-dimensional (2D) graphics. The\nplayer uses a joystick to control a bubble in a kitchen sink. The object is to\nprogress through levels by cleaning the sink while avoiding enemies.\n\nDevelopment was handled by John Kotlarik and Python Anghelo. Kotlarik desired to\ncreate a non-violent game inspired by [[Pac-Man]]. Anghelo designed the game's\nartwork and scenario as well as a special plastic cabinet that saw limited use.\nThe game received a mixed reception from critics, who focused on the game's\nunusual premise. The game was later released as a web-based version and on home\nconsoles as part of arcade compilations.\n","linknr":217,"url":"Bubbles_(video_game)","recorded":1362480524,"links":14,"instances":["video_game"],"pdf":[],"categories":["1982 video games","Arcade games","Action video games","Williams video games"],"headings":["Gameplay","Development","Reception and legacy","See also","Notes","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c9/Bubbles-arcade.jpg/220px-Bubbles-arcade.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/6e/Bubbles_Game.png/220px-Bubbles_Game.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/94/Symbol_support_vote.svg/15px-Symbol_support_vote.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["level","video_game"]],"members":["level"],"related":["Williams_Electronics","Python_Anghelo","Platform_game","Raster_graphics","Arcade_game","Arcade_game","Video_game","WMS_Industries","Action_game","2D_computer_graphics","Python_Anghelo","Non-violent_game","Action_game","Puzzle_video_game","Top-down_perspective","Level_(video_game)","Monaural","Raster_graphics","Cathode_ray_tube","Python_Anghelo","Allgame","Adobe_Shockwave","Midway_Games","Midway_Games","Dreamcast","Katamari_Damacy","Gameplay"]}
