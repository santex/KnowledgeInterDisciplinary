{"cursor":"33328","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n'Railway signalling' is a system used to control railway traffic safely,\nessentially to prevent trains from colliding. Being guided by fixed rails,\ntrains are uniquely susceptible to collision; furthermore, trains cannot stop\nquickly, and frequently operate at speeds that do not enable them to stop within\nsighting distance of the driver. In the UK, the Regulation of Railways Act 1889\nintroduced a series of requirements on matters such as the implementation of\ninterlocked block signalling and other safety measures as a direct result of the\nArmagh rail disaster in that year.\n\nMost forms of train control involve movement authority being passed from\nthose responsible for each section of a rail network (e.g., a signalman or\nstationmaster) to the train crew. The set of rules and the physical equipment\nused to accomplish this determine what is known as the method of working\n(UK), method of operation (US) or safeworking (Aus.). Not all these methods\nrequire the use of physical signals and some systems are specific to single\ntrack railways.\n\nThe earliest rail cars were first hauled by horses or mules. A mounted flagman\non a horse preceded some early trains. Hand and arm signals were used to direct\nthe âtrain driversâ. Foggy and poor-visibility conditions gave rise to flags and\nlanterns. Wayside signalling dates back as far as 1832, and used elevated flags\nor balls that could be seen from afar.\n","linknr":842,"url":"Block_signal","recorded":1362553999,"links":36,"instances":["rail","vancouver","railway_signalling","rail","instrument"],"pdf":["http://site.rfi.it/quadronormativo/Ministeriale/RS-01-08-08.pdf"],"categories":["Rail transport operations|Signalling","Railway signalling|*"],"headings":["Timetable operation","Block signalling","Centralized traffic control","Train detection","Fixed signals","Safety systems","Cab signalling","Interlocking","Operating rules","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/SR_signals_from_cab_of_standard_five.jpg/220px-SR_signals_from_cab_of_standard_five.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7b/Rail-semaphore-signal-Dave-F.jpg/220px-Rail-semaphore-signal-Dave-F.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/72/Gantry_of_Sri_Lanka_semaphore_signals%2Cmain_line%2CSri_Lanka.JPG/200px-Gantry_of_Sri_Lanka_semaphore_signals%2Cmain_line%2CSri_Lanka.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/TTC_signal_blocks_captioned.JPG/220px-TTC_signal_blocks_captioned.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/14/Distant_signal_Hamamatsu.jpg/220px-Distant_signal_Hamamatsu.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/Metro_North_Cab_Sigal.jpg/200px-Metro_North_Cab_Sigal.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4e/Telecom-icon.svg/100px-Telecom-icon.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["signalman","rail"],["single_track","rail"],["token","railway_signalling"],["bell","instrument"],["signalman","rail"],["single_track","rail"],["token","railway_signalling"],["token","railway_signalling"],["skytrain","vancouver"]],"members":["single_track","skytrain","token","signalman","bell"],"related":["Railway","Trains","Collision","Rail_tracks","Regulation_of_Railways_Act_1889","Armagh_rail_disaster","Signalling_block_systems","Signalman_(rail)","Stationmaster","Railway_signal","Single_track_(rail)","Telegraph","Wabash_Railroad","New_York,_Chicago_&_St._Louis_Railroad","Thorpe_rail_accident","Token_(railway_signalling)","Stopwatch","Electrical_telegraph","Signal_box","Bell_(instrument)","Signalman_(rail)","Railway_semaphore_signal","Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom","Regulation_of_Railways_Act_1889","Armagh_rail_disaster","Interlocking","Single_track_(rail)","Token_(railway_signalling)","Toronto_subway_and_RT_signals","Token_(railway_signalling)","Kilometres","Docklands_Light_Railway","GPS","Skytrain_(Vancouver)","Docklands_Light_Railway","BMT_Canarsie_Line","Jubilee_Line","West_Coast_Main_Line","European_Rail_Traffic_Management_System","European_Train_Control_System","Track_circuit","Relay","Railway_signal","Semaphore_signal","Signal_passed_at_danger","Fog","Train_protection_system","Track_circuits","Transponders","Communication-based_train_control","Railroad_switch","Interlocking","Australia","North_America","United_States","Canadian_Rail_Operating_Rules","General_Code_of_Operating_Rules","Class_I_railroad","Class_II_railroad","Short-line_railroad","Northeast_Operating_Rules_Advisory_Committee","Norfolk_Southern","CSX_Transportation","United_Kingdom","Heritage_railway","British_Railways","History_of_railways_in_Italy","Institution_of_Railway_Signal_Engineers","Railroad_chronometer","Railroad_switch","Railway_slide_fence","Toronto_subway_and_RT_signals","Train_speed_optimization"]}
