{"cursor":"24032","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nIn mathematics, a 'binary relation on' a set A is a collection of ordered pairs\nof elements of A. In other words, it is a subset of the Cartesian product\nA 2 = . More generally, a 'binary relation between' two sets A and B\nis a subset of . The terms 'dyadic relation' and '2-place relation' are synonyms\nfor binary relations.\n\nAn example is the \"divides\" relation between the set of prime numbers 'P' and\nthe set of integers 'Z', in which every prime p is associated with every integer\nz that is a multiple of p (and not with any integer that is not a multiple of\np). In this relation, for instance, the prime 2 is associated with numbers that\ninclude â4, 0, 6, 10, but not 1 or 9; and the prime 3 is associated with numbers\nthat include 0, 6, and 9, but not 4 or 13.\n\nBinary relations are used in many branches of mathematics to model concepts like\n\"is greater than\", \"is equal to\", and \"divides\" in arithmetic, \"is congruent to\"\nin geometry, \"is adjacent to\" in graph theory, \"is orthogonal to\" in linear\nalgebra and many more. The concept of function is defined as a special kind of\nbinary relation. Binary relations are also heavily used in computer science.\n\nA binary relation is the special case of an ''n''-ary relation\nR â A 1 Ã â¦ Ã A n, that is, a\nset of ''n''-tuples where the jth component of each n-tuple is taken from the\njth domain A j of the relation.\n\nIn some systems of axiomatic set theory, relations are extended to classes,\nwhich are generalizations of sets. This extension is needed for, among other\nthings, modeling the concepts of \"is an element of\" or \"is a subset of\" in set\ntheory, without running into logical inconsistencies such as Russell's paradox.\n","linknr":349,"url":"Binary_relation","recorded":1362568027,"links":44,"instances":["geometry","mathematics","structure","mathematics","term_rewriting","graph_theory","geometry","mathematics","set_theory","mathematics","mathematics","mathematics","order_theory","order_theory","mathematics"],"pdf":["http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~yyao/PAPERS/relation.pdf","http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~yyao/PAPERS/relation.pdf"],"categories":["Mathematical
