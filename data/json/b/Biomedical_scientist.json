These scientists work to gain knowledge on the main\nprinciples of how the human body works and to find new ways to cure or treat\ndisease by developing advanced diagnostic tools or new therapeutic strategies.\nThe research of biomedical scientists is referred to as biomedical research.\n\nBiomedical scientists can have a particular focus on basic, pre-clinical, or\ntranslational research. While biomedical scientists specifically focus on\nunderstanding the human body and disease, scientists educated in other fields\nalso contribute greatly to advancements in medical knowledge, including\nbiologists, biomedical engineers, chemists, and physicists.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the term \"biomedical scientist\" as related to the health\nservice has a different meaning than in other parts of the world, specifically\nreferring to a class of healthcare professional that performs clinical\npathology services.\n","linknr":481,"url":"Biomedical_scientist","recorded":1362505366,"links":19,"instances":["medicine","anatomy","biology","university","observation","biophysical","biology","penalty","uk","genetics","logic","biology"],"pdf":["http://www.hypothesisjournal.com/pdfs/vol6num1/17.pdf","http://www.hypothesisjournal.com/pdfs/vol6num1/17.pdf"],"categories":["Healthcare
