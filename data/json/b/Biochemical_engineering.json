{"cursor":"1135","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" 'Biochemical engineering' is a branch of\nchemical engineering or biological engineering that mainly deals with the design\nand construction of unit processes that involve biological organisms or\nmolecules, such as bioreactors. Biochemical engineering is often taught as a\nsupplementary option to chemical engineering or biological engineering due to\nthe similarities in both the background subject curriculum and problem-solving\ntechniques used by both professions. Its applications are used in the food,\nfeed, pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and water treatment industries.\n","linknr":324,"url":"Biochemical_engineering","recorded":1362503929,"links":24,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Chemical engineering","Biotechnology","Biological engineering"],"headings":["See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Symbol_book_class2.svg/16px-Symbol_book_class2.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/12px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg/16px-Portal-puzzle.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg/16px-Wikiquote-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Chemical_engineering","Biological_engineering","Bioreactor","Bioreactor","Industrial_biotechnology","Biological_hydrogen_production","Photobioreactor","Electrochemical_energy_conversion","Biofuel_from_algae","Bioreactor_landfill","Moss_bioreactor"]}
