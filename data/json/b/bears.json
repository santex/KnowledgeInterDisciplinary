Bears are\n  classified as caniforms, or doglike carnivorans, with the pinnipeds being\n  their closest living relatives. Although only eight species of bears are\n  extant, they are widespread, appearing in a wide variety of habitats\n  throughout the Northern Hemisphere and partially in the Southern\n  Hemisphere. Bears are found on the continents of North America, South\n  America, Europe, and Asia.\n\nCommon characteristics of modern bears include large bodies with stocky legs,\nlong snouts, shaggy hair, plantigrade paws with five nonretractile claws, and\nshort tails. While the polar bear is mostly carnivorous and the giant panda\nfeeds almost entirely on bamboo, the remaining six species are omnivorous, with\nvaried diets.\n\nWith the exceptions of courting individuals and mothers with their young, bears\nare typically solitary animals. They are generally diurnal, but may be active\nduring the night (nocturnal) or twilight (crepuscular), particularly around\nhumans. Bears are aided by an excellent sense of smell, and despite their heavy\nbuild and awkward gait, they can run quickly and are adept climbers and\nswimmers. In autumn, some bear species forage large amounts of fermented fruits,\nwhich affects their behaviour.<ref></ref> Bears use shelters, such as caves and\nburrows, as their dens; most species occupy their dens during the winter for a\nlong period (up to 100 days) of sleep similar to hibernation.<ref name=\"bear_es-\nsentials_of_hibernation\">[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/nature/bear-essentials-\nof-hibernation.html Bear Essentials of Hibernation]</ref>\n\nBears have been hunted since prehistoric times for their meat and fur. With\ntheir tremendous physical presence and charisma, they play a prominent role in\nthe arts, mythology, and other cultural aspects of various human societies. In\nmodern times, the bears' existence has been pressured through the encroachment\non their habitats and the illegal trade of bears and bear parts, including the\nAsian bile bear market. The IUCN lists six bear species as vulnerable or\nendangered, and even least concern species, such as the brown bear, are at risk\nof extirpation in certain countries. The poaching and international trade of\nthese most threatened populations are prohibited, but still ongoing.\n","title":"Bear","headings":["Etymology","Evolutionary
