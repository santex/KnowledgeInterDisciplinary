{"cursor":"4259","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n'Blood proteins', also termed 'serum proteins' or 'plasma proteins', are\nproteins present in blood serum. They serve many different functions, including\ntransport of lipids, hormones, vitamins and metals in the circulatory system\nand the regulation of acellular activity and functioning and in the immune\nsystem. Other blood proteins act as enzymes, complement components, protease\ninhibitors or kinin precursors. Contrary to popular belief, hemoglobin is not a\nblood protein, as it is carried within red blood cells, rather than in the\nblood serum.\n\nSerum albumin accounts for 55% of blood proteins, and is a major contributor to\nmaintaining the osmotic pressure of plasma to assist in the transport of lipids\nand steroid hormones. Globulins make up 38% of blood proteins and transport\nions, hormones and lipids assisting in immune function. Fibrinogen comprise 7%\nof blood proteins; conversion of fibrinogen to insoluble fibrin is essential for\nblood clotting. The remainder of plasma proteins (1%) is made up of regulatory\nproteins such as enzymes, proenzymes and hormones. All blood proteins are\nsynthesized in liver except for the gamma globulins.\n\nSeparating serum proteins by electrophoresis is a valuable diagnostic tool as\nwell as a way to monitor clinical progress. Current research regarding blood\nplasma proteins is centered on performing proteomics analyses of serum/plasma in\nthe search for biomarkers. These efforts started with two-dimensional gel\nelectrophoresis efforts in the 1970s and in more\nrecent times this research has been performed using LC-tandem MS based proteomics. The normal\nlaboratory value of serum total protein is around 7 g/dL.\n","linknr":166,"url":"Blood_proteins","recorded":1362559286,"links":27,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Blood proteins","Proteins","Proteomics"],"headings":["Families of blood proteins","Examples of specific blood proteins","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Protein","Blood_serum","Non-cellular_life","Immune_system","Protease_inhibitors","Kinin_precursor","Hemoglobin","Red_blood_cell","Serum_albumin","Fibrinogen","Fibrin","Gamma_globulin","Blood_serum","Serum_protein_electrophoresis","Blood_plasma","Proteomics","Two-dimensional_gel_electrophoresis","Serum_total_protein","Serum_albumin","Oncotic_pressure","Globulin","Immune_system","Fibrinogen","Coagulation","Regulation_of_gene_expression","Thrombus","Alpha_1_antitrypsin","Trypsin","Digestive_system","Alpha2-macroglobulin","Gamma_globulin","Haptoglobin","Ceruloplasmin","Complement_component_3","Complement_component_4","Lipoprotein","C-reactive_protein","Lipoprotein","LDL","High_density_lipoprotein","Transferrin","Prothrombin","Mannan-binding_lectin"]}
