Backbone is\nknown for being lightweight, as its only dependency is on one JavaScript\nlibrary, Underscore.js. It is designed for developing single-page web\napplications, and for keeping various parts of web applications (e.g.\nmultiple clients and the server) synchronized. Backbone was created\nby Jeremy Ashkenas, who is also known for CoffeeScript.\n","linknr":159,"url":"Backbone.js","recorded":1362538750,"links":17,"instances":["company","software"],"pdf":[],"categories":["JavaScript libraries"],"headings":["Use","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/9d/BackboneJS.png/200px-BackboneJS.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/28/HelloWorld.svg/50px-HelloWorld.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["bittorrent","company"],["diaspora","software"]],"members":["bittorrent","diaspora"],"related":["Jeremy_Ashkenas","JavaScript","Cross-platform","JavaScript_library","MIT_License","JavaScript","REST","JSON","Model–view–presenter","JavaScript_library","Underscore.js","Single-page_application","Jeremy_Ashkenas","CoffeeScript","Airbnb","BitTorrent_(company)","Diaspora_(software)","DocumentCloud","Foursquare","Groupon","Hulu","LinkedIn","NewsBlur","Pandora_Radio","Soundcloud","Trello","USA_Today","WordPress.com","Ember.js","AngularJS","O'Reilly_Media"]}
