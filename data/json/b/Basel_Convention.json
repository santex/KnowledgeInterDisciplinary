It does not, however, address\nthe movement of radioactive waste. The Convention is also intended to minimize\nthe amount and toxicity of wastes generated, to ensure their environmentally\nsound management as closely as possible to the source of generation, and to\nassist LDCs in environmentally sound management of the hazardous and other\nwastes they generate.\n\nThe Convention was opened for signature on 22 March 1989, and entered into force\non 5 May 1992. As of January 2013, 178 countries, as well as the European Union\nare parties to the Convention, while Afghanistan, Haiti and the United States\nhave signed the Convention but not ratified it.\n","linknr":291,"url":"Basel_Convention","recorded":1362574238,"links":41,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.ucl.ac.uk/ippr/download/volume-3-2/Lloyd.pdf","http://www.basel.int/text/con-e-rev.pdf","http://www.basel.int/pub/simp-guide.pdf","http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/site/en/oj/2006/l_190/l_19020060712en00010098.pdf"],"categories":["Environment treaties","Waste treaties","Chemical safety","Treaties concluded in 1989","Treaties entered into force in 1992","1992 in the environment","Global natural environment","Hazardous waste"],"headings":["History","Definition of ''hazardous waste''","Obligations","Basel Ban Amendment","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4c/Basel_Convention_Secretariat.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/16px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Basel_Convention_signatories.PNG/400px-Basel_Convention_signatories.PNG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2e/Batteries_comparison_4%2C5_D_C_AA_AAA_AAAA_A23_9V_CR2032_LR44_matchstick-1.jpeg/220px-Batteries_comparison_4%2C5_D_C_AA_AAA_AAAA_A23_9V_CR2032_LR44_matchstick-1.jpeg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/Button_cells_and_9v_cells_%283%29.png/220px-Button_cells_and_9v_cells_%283%29.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Basel","Switzerland","Ratification","Secretary-General_of_the_United_Nations","Treaty","Hazardous_waste","Developed_countries","Less_Developed_Countries","Toxicity","Afghanistan","Haiti","United_States","Ratification","RCRA","Khian_Sea_waste_disposal_incident","Electronic_waste","Municipal_solid_waste","Asbestos","Ireland","Non-governmental_organization","Antarctica","Bamako_Convention","Greenpeace","Basel_Ban_Amendment","OECD","Recycling","Shipbreaking","Australia","Canada","European_Union","Waste_Shipment_Regulation","EWSR","Asbestos_and_the_law","Bamako_Convention","Rotterdam_Convention","Stockholm_Convention","Electronic_waste_by_country"]}
