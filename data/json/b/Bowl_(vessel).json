They are typically small and\nshallow, although some, such as punch bowls and salad bowls, are larger and\noften intended to serve many people.\n\nBowls have existed for thousands of years. Very early bowls have been found in\nChina, Ancient Greece, Crete and in certain Native American cultures. Modern bowls can be made of\nceramic, metal, wood, plastic, and other materials. Their appearance can range\nfrom very simple designs of a single color to sophisticated artwork.\n\nThe bowl has also been used as a recepticle for the apple dunking game played\ntraditionally in Britain on Halloween. It is a game unique to the British Isles\nand symbolises the traditional dunking of witches that was common for many\ncenturies as communities tried to find out who was a witch by dunking or\ndrowning them in the local river. It is said to originate in Queenstown Road,\nBattersea although its ultimate origins may come from Highgate, London or the\nEast of the City.\n","linknr":186,"url":"Bowl_(vessel)","recorded":1362553297,"links":51,"instances":["drinking_cup","libation_vessel","drink"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Containers","Kitchenware","Crockery","Glass containers"],"headings":["Ancient history","See also","Gallery","Notes","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/Simple-ceramic-bowl.jpg/220px-Simple-ceramic-bowl.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/95/Glasschale%2C_Villa_Boscoreale.jpg/158px-Glasschale%2C_Villa_Boscoreale.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/92/DD-Famverte-Tasse.JPG/180px-DD-Famverte-Tasse.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/36/MaryRose-wooden_bowls6.JPG/180px-MaryRose-wooden_bowls6.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/84/B%C3%A1t_chi%E1%BA%BFt_y%C3%AAu_%28A_Vietnamese_type_of_bowl%29.JPG/180px-B%C3%A1t_chi%E1%BA%BFt_y%C3%AAu_%28A_Vietnamese_type_of_bowl%29.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["punch","drink"],["phiale","libation_vessel"],["kylix","drinking_cup"]],"members":["kylix","phiale","punch"],"related":["Food","Drinking","Punch_(drink)","Salad","China","Ancient_Greece","Crete","Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas","Ceramic","Metal","Wood","Plastic","Art","Archaeology","North_America","Anthropology","Diameter","Classical_antiquity","Phiale_(libation_vessel)","Patera","Kylix_(drinking_cup)","Libation","Perfume","Wine","Mediterranean","Bronze_Age","Bridge_spouted_vessel","Minoan_civilization","Phaistos","China","Neolithic","Bridge_spouted_vessel","Buffet","Dishware","List_of_eating_utensils","Glass","Ancient_Rome","Villa_Boscoreale","Italy","Qing","Charles_Scribner's_Sons","Archeological_Institute_of_America"]}
