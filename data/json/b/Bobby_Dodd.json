He was elected to the College Football\nHall of Fame as a player and coach, something that only\nthree people have accomplished.\n\nAfter playing quarterback at the University of Tennessee, he served as an\nassistant coach under Bill Alexander at Georgia Tech beginning in December 1930.\nAlexander made the hire while Dodd was still a student at Tennessee. Dodd\nsucceeded Alexander in 1945 as the third head coach at the Institute. He retired\nfrom coaching after the 1966 season, compiling a 165–64–8 record. He\nalso served as Athletic Director from 1950 until 1976. All together, Dodd served\nGeorgia Tech 57 years in various capacities. Bobby Dodd died in June\n1988 at the age of 79 in Atlanta, Georgia.\n","linknr":629,"url":"Bobby_Dodd","recorded":1372153917,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Bobby_Dodd&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Bobby_Dodd&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Bobby_Dodd_1962.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4f/Bobby_Dodd_1962.png/220px-Bobby_Dodd_1962.png","/wiki/American_football","/wiki/Galax,_Virginia","/wiki/Atlanta,_Georgia","/wiki/University_of_Tennessee","/wiki/Quarterback","/wiki/Halfback_(American_football)","/wiki/Punter_(football)","#cite_note-gaenc-1","/wiki/Head_coach","/wiki/Georgia_Institute_of_Technology","/wiki/Georgia_Institute_of_Technology","/wiki/Athletic_director","/wiki/Georgia_Institute_of_Technology","http://www.cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/coaching/alltime_coach_year_by_year.php?coachid=602","/wiki/College_football_national_championships_in_NCAA_Division_I_FBS","/wiki/Southeastern_Conference","/wiki/Southeastern_Conference_football_individual_awards#Coach_of_the_Year","/wiki/Helms_Athletic_Foundation","#cite_note-doddfound-2","#cite_note-doddfound-2","/wiki/Georgia_Sports_Hall_of_Fame","#cite_note-doddfound-2","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Football_Writers_Association_of_America","#cite_note-doddfound-2","/wiki/College_Football_Hall_of_Fame","http://www.footballfoundation.org/Programs/CollegeFootballHallofFame/SearchDetail.aspx?id=50014","/wiki/College_football","/wiki/Coach_(sports)","/wiki/Georgia_Institute_of_Technology","/wiki/College_Football_Hall_of_Fame","#cite_note-HOF-4","#cite_note-doddfound-2","/wiki/Quarterback","/wiki/University_of_Tennessee","/wiki/William_Alexander_(football_coach)","/wiki/Georgia_Institute_of_Technology","/wiki/Athletic_Director","#cite_note-5","#cite_note-6","#cite_note-7","#Early_life","#Player","#Coach","#Integration","#Georgia_Tech.27s_withdrawal_from_SEC","#Feud_with_Bear_Bryant","#Over-recruitment","#Legacy","#Head_coaching_record","#Family_and_personal_life","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Bobby_Dodd&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Galax,_Virginia","/wiki/Kingsport,_Tennessee","/wiki/University_of_Tennessee","#cite_note-gaenc-1","#cite_note-ramblins-8","/w/index.php?title=Bobby_Dodd&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Tennessee_Volunteers_football","/wiki/Robert_Neyland","#cite_note-Bio-9","#cite_note-nyt-10","/wiki/The_Third_Saturday_in_October","/wiki/Alabama_Crimson_Tide_football","/wiki/Tuscaloosa,_AL","#cite_note-Bio-9","/wiki/Dobyns_Bennett_High_School","#cite_note-HOF-4","/wiki/Fumblerooski","/wiki/1983_Nebraska_Cornhuskers_football_team","/wiki/1984_Orange_Bowl","/wiki/1983_Miami_Hurricanes_football_team","#cite_note-11","#cite_note-12","#cite_note-HOF-4","/wiki/File:Bobby_Dodd_football_card.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6d/Bobby_Dodd_football_card.jpg/270px-Bobby_Dodd_football_card.jpg","/wiki/File:Bobby_Dodd_football_card.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf7/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","#cite_note-13","/wiki/Grantland_Rice","/wiki/All_American","/wiki/Gene_McEver","/wiki/University_of_Tennessee","#cite_note-HOF-4","#cite_note-14","#cite_note-15","/wiki/Herman_Hickman","#cite_note-16","/w/index.php?title=Bobby_Dodd&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/File:Bobby_Dodd_1943.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/49/Bobby_Dodd_1943.png/180px-Bobby_Dodd_1943.png","/wiki/File:Bobby_Dodd_1943.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf7/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Georgia_Tech_Yellow_Jackets_football","/wiki/William_Alexander_(coach)","#cite_note-17","#cite_note-hundred-18","#cite_note-gaenc-1","#cite_note-19","#cite_note-dodd-20","#cite_note-dodd-20","/wiki/Southeastern_Conference","/wiki/1953_Sugar_Bowl","/wiki/Ole_Miss_Rebels_football","#cite_note-dodd-20","#cite_note-nyt-10","#cite_note-usfl-21","#cite_note-22","#cite_note-hundred-18","#cite_note-23","#cite_note-24","#cite_note-25","#cite_note-26","#cite_note-27","#cite_note-28","/wiki/File:Plaque_for_1952_GT_Football_National_Championship.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/Plaque_for_1952_GT_Football_National_Championship.jpg/200px-Plaque_for_1952_GT_Football_National_Championship.jpg","/wiki/File:Plaque_for_1952_GT_Football_National_Championship.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf7/skin
