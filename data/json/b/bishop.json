Patriarchal basilica of Aquileia, Italy.]]\n\nA 'bishop' (English derivation<ref>Etymology from en.wiktionary.org: Bishop.\nFrom Proto-Germanic *biskopas, *biskupaz (“bishop”), from Vulgar Latin\n*biscopus, from Latin episcopus (“overseer, supervisor”), from Ancient Greek\nἐπίσκοπος (episkopos, “overseer”), from ἐπί (epi, “over”) + σκοπέω (skopeō, “I\nexamine”).</ref> from the New Testament Greek ἐπίσκοπος, epískopos, \"overseer\",\n\"guardian\") is an ordained or consecrated member of the Christian clergy who is\ngenerally entrusted with a position of authority and oversight. Within the Roman\nCatholic, Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, Anglican, Old Catholic and\nIndependent Catholic churches and in the Assyrian Church of the East, bishops\nclaim apostolic succession, a direct historical lineage dating back to the\noriginal Twelve Apostles. Within these churches, bishops are seen as those who\npossess the full priesthood and can ordain clergy – including other bishops.\nSome Protestant churches including the Lutheran and Methodist churches have\nbishops serving similar functions as well, though not always understood to be\nwithin apostolic succession in the same way. One who has been ordained deacon,\npriest, and then bishop is understood to hold the fullness of the (ministerial)\npriesthood, given responsibility by Christ to govern, teach and sanctify the\nBody of Christ, members of the Faithful. Priests, deacons and lay ministers\ncooperate and assist their bishop(s) in shepherding a flock.\n\nThe term epískopos was not from the earliest times clearly distinguished from\nthe term presbýteros (literally: \"elder\" or \"senior\", origin of the modern\nEnglish word priest), but the term was already clearly used in the sense of the\norder or office of bishop, distinct from that of presbyter in the writings of\nIgnatius of Antioch (died c. 108), and sources from the middle of the 2nd\ncentury undoubtedly set forth that all the chief centres of Christianity\nrecognized and had the office of bishop, using a form of organization that\nremained universal until the Protestant Reformation.\n","title":"bishop","headings":["History","Bishops and civil government","Churches","Dress and
