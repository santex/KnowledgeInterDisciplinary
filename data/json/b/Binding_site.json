When more than one type of ligand can bind to a\nbinding site, competition ensues.\n\nAn equilibrium exists between unbound ligands and bound ligands.\n\nBinding sites also exhibit chemical specificity, a measure of the types of\nligands that will bond, and affinity, which is a measure of the strength of the\nchemical bond.\n\nBinding sites are often an important component of the functional\ncharacterization of biomolecules. For example, the characterization the binding\nsite of a substrate to an enzyme is essential to model the reaction mechanism\nresponsible for the chemical change from substrate to product.\n\nA more specific type of binding site is the transcription factor binding site,\npresent on DNA.\n","linknr":204,"url":"Binding_site","recorded":1362371361,"links":21,"instances":["biochemistry","chemistry","biochemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Chemical bonding","Proteins","DNA","RNA","Transcription factors"],"headings":["See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/AlphaHelixSection.svg/40px-AlphaHelixSection.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["ligand","biochemistry"],["substrate","biochemistry"],["product","chemistry"]],"members":["substrate","product","ligand"],"related":["Biochemistry","Protein","DNA","RNA","Molecule","Ion","Ligand_(biochemistry)","Chemical_bond","Antibody","Antigen","Competition","Chemical_equilibrium","Chemical_specificity","Chemical_affinity","Biomolecule","Substrate_(biochemistry)","Enzyme","Reaction_mechanism","Product_(chemistry)","Transcription_factor","Active_site","NTP_binding_site","DNA_binding_site"]}
