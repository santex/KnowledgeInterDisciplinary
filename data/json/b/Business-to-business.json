{"cursor":"10666","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n, where numerous shops sell electronic components to other companies that would\nuse them to manufacture consumer goods.]] 'Business-to-business' ('B2B')\ndescribes commerce transactions between businesses, such as between a\nmanufacturer and a wholesaler, or between a wholesaler and a retailer.\nContrasting terms are business-to-consumer (B2C) and business-to-government\n(B2G). 'B2B (Business to Business) Branding' is a term used in marketing.\n\nThe volume of B2B (Business-to-Business) transactions is much higher than the\nvolume of B2C transactions.  The primary reason\nfor this is that in a typical supply chain there will be many B2B transactions\ninvolving sub components or raw materials, and only one B2C transaction,\nspecifically sale of the finished product to the end customer. For example, an\nautomobile manufacturer makes several B2B transactions such as buying tires,\nglass for windscreens, and rubber hoses for its vehicles. The final transaction,\na finished vehicle sold to the consumer, is a single (B2C) transaction.\n\nB2B is also used in the context of communication and collaboration. Many\nbusinesses are now using social media to connect with their consumers (B2C);\nhowever, they are now using similar tools within the business so employees can\nconnect with one another. When communication is taking place amongst employees,\nthis can be referred to as \"B2B\" communication.\n","linknr":178,"url":"Business-to-business","recorded":1362483673,"links":39,"instances":["economics","umm"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Marketing terminology","E-commerce","Information technology management"],"headings":["Etymology","Definition B2B vs. B2C","Differences between B2B and B2C","B2B brands need to be differentiated","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/41/Guangzhou-electronic-components-shop-0479.jpg/220px-Guangzhou-electronic-components-shop-0479.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["service","economics"],["un/cefact's_modeling_methodology","umm"]],"members":["service"],"related":["Manufacturer","Wholesaler","Business-to-consumer","Business-to-government","Marketing","Supply_chain","Raw_materials","Business-to-consumer","Electronic_communication","Business","Organization","Communication","Business-to-consumer","Marketing","Capital_goods","Service_(economics)","Professional","Trade_publication","Retail","Factory-to-consumer","Business-to-consumer","Business-to-employee","Center_for_E-Commerce_Infrastructure_Development","Consumer-to-consumer","E-business","E-Business_XML","Electronic_Commerce","Electronic_Data_Interchange","Empty_Vessel","Online_shopping","Private_Electronic_Market","UN/CEFACT's_Modeling_Methodology_(UMM)","B2B_e-Marketplace","Harper_Collins"]}
