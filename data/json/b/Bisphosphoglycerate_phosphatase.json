The systematic name of this enzyme class is '2,3-bisphospho-D-\nglycerate 2-phosphohydrolase'. Other names in common use include '2,3-\ndiphosphoglycerate phosphatase', 'diphosphoglycerate phosphatase', '2,3-\ndiphosphoglyceric acid phosphatase', '2,3-bisphosphoglycerate phosphatase', and\n'glycerate-2,3-diphosphate phosphatase'. This enzyme participates in\nglycolysis/gluconeogenesis.\n","linknr":139,"url":"Bisphosphoglycerate_phosphatase","recorded":1362569015,"links":14,"instances":["biochemistry","chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["EC 3.1.3","Enzymes of known structure"],"headings":["Structural studies","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/b/e/ebe1915c432cf9c372b4ecfe36ff1fa2.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/Acethylcholinesterase_TC_1EA5.png/40px-Acethylcholinesterase_TC_1EA5.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["substrate","biochemistry"],["product","chemistry"]],"members":["substrate","product"],"related":["Enzymology","Enzyme","Catalysis","Chemical_reaction","Substrate_(biochemistry)","2,3-bisphospho-D-glycerate","Water","Product_(chemistry)","3-phospho-D-glycerate","Phosphate","Hydrolase","Ester","Glycolysis","Gluconeogenesis","Tertiary_structure","Protein_Data_Bank"]}
