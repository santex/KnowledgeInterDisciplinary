{"cursor":"20036","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Biochemical oxygen demand' or 'B.O.D' is the amount of dissolved oxygen needed\nby aerobic biological organisms in a body of water to break down organic\nmaterial present in a given water sample at certain temperature over a specific\ntime period. The term also refers to a chemical procedure for determining this\namount. This is not a precise quantitative test, although it is widely used as\nan indication of the organic quality of water. The BOD\nvalue is most commonly expressed in milligrams of oxygen consumed per litre of\nsample during 5 days of incubation at 20 Â°C and is often used as a robust\nsurrogate of the degree of organic pollution of water.\n\nBOD can be used as a gauge of the effectiveness of wastewater treatment plants.\nIt is listed as a conventional pollutant in the U.S. Clean Water Act.\n","linknr":250,"url":"Biochemical_oxygen_demand","recorded":1362511473,"links":37,"instances":["environmental"],"pdf":["http://ia700404.us.archive.org/35/items/cu31924003641929/cu31924003641929.pdf"],"categories":["Anaerobic digestion","Environmental science","Water quality indicators"],"headings":["Background","The BOD<sub>5</sub> test","Dissolved Oxygen Probes: Membrane and Luminescence","Test Limitations","History of the use of BOD","Typical BOD values","BOD Biosensor","BOD Software sensor","See also","References","Notes","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/math/2/e/4/2e436b7a126f074bcd67ff487cf0ce26.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/d/7/9/d7985725adf6ea1f23747c754676d611.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/5/9/e59f4522f68ae0b68bfe1e1f43e621ef.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/2/b/7/2b70d9d6d02e7bc3b430d9f08214eab4.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/a/1/d/a1da4285b16a59836f4a1e61709aedfd.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["oxygenation","environmental"],["oxygenation","environmental"]],"members":["oxygenation"],"related":["Oxygenation_(environmental)","Water_pollution","Sewage_treatment","Conventional_pollutant","Clean_Water_Act","Organic_compound","Microorganisms","Food","Energy","Bacterial_growth","Reproduction","Metabolism","Nutrient","Enzyme","Food_web","Water_quality","Aerobic_respiration","Royal_Commission_on_Sewage_Disposal","United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland","North_America","Nitrifying_bacteria","Reproducibility","Fauna","Ecosystem","Trophic_level","Organisms","Buffered_dilution_water","Oxygenation_(environmental)","Photosynthesis","Oxidation","Chemical_oxygen_demand","Organic_compound","Ammonia","Pressure_sensor","Carbon_dioxide","Lithium_hydroxide","Henry's_law","Winkler_test_for_dissolved_oxygen","Antibiotic","Medical_waste","Chlorination","Sewage_treatment","Water_pollution","Estuary","U.K.","Nitrification","Effluent","United_States","Sewage_treatment","Pollution","Sewage","Sewage_treatment","Europe","U.S.","Groundwater","Surface_water","Infiltration/Inflow","Chemical_oxygen_demand","Theoretical_oxygen_demand","Carbonaceous_biochemical_oxygen_demand","Wastewater_quality_indicators","Chemical_oxygen_demand"]}
