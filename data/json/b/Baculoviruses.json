While GVs\ncontain only one nucleocapsid per envelope, NPVs contain either single (SNPV) or\nmultiple (MNPV) nucleocapsids per envelope. The enveloped virions are further\noccluded in granulin matrix in GVs and polyhedrin for NPVs. Moreover, GV have\nonly single virion per granulin occlusion body while polyhedra can contain\nmultiple embedded virions.\n\nBaculoviruses have very species-specific tropisms among the invertebrates with\nover 600 host species having been described. Immature (larval) forms of moth\nspecies are the most common hosts, but these viruses have also been found\ninfecting sawflies, mosquitoes, and shrimp. Although baculoviruses are capable\nof entering mammalian cells in culture they are not known to be\ncapable of replication in mammalian or other vertebrate animal cells.\nBaculoviruses contain circular double-stranded genome ranging from 80â180 kbp.\n","linknr":361,"url":"Baculoviruses","recorded":1362507568,"links":63,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Biopesticides","DNA viruses","Insect ecology"],"headings":["Historical influence","Baculovirus life cycle","Structure of the virion","Major envelope glycoprotein gp64","Applications","Biosafety","Taxonomy","Evolution","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/Baculovirus.jpg/200px-Baculovirus.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/28/Npv-life_cycle-en.jpg/288px-Npv-life_cycle-en.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c1/Nucleopolyhedrovirus.jpg/428px-Nucleopolyhedrovirus.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Virus","Nucleopolyhedrovirus","Granulovirus","Capsid","Viral_envelope","Polyhedrin","Invertebrate","Moth","Sawfly","Mosquito","Shrimp","Mammal","Vertebrate","Silk","Biopesticide","Protein","Cell_culture","Sf21","High_Five_cells","Recombinant_DNA","Vaccine","H5N1","Secondary_infection","Endosome","Actin","Cell_nucleus","Lepidoptera","Base_pair","Genome","Open_reading_frame","Amino_acid","Nudivirus","Cypovirus","BacMam"]}
