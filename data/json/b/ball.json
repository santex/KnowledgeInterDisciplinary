A 'ball' is a round, usually spherical but sometimes ovoid, object with\nvarious uses. It is used in ball games, where the play of the game follows the\nstate of the ball as it is hit, kicked or thrown by players. In the context of\nsports, \"ball\" need not refer to a spherical object, as is the case in American\nfootball. Balls can also be used for simpler activities, such as catch, marbles\nand juggling. Balls made from hard-wearing materials are used in engineering\napplications to provide very low friction bearings, known as ball bearings. Black-\npowder weapons use stone and metal balls as projectiles.\n\nAlthough many types of balls are today made from rubber, this form was unknown\noutside the Americas until after the voyages of Columbus. The Spanish were the\nfirst Europeans to see bouncing rubber balls (albeit solid and not inflated)\nwhich were employed most notably in the Mesoamerican ballgame. Balls used in\nvarious sports in other parts of the world prior to Columbus were made from\nother materials such as animal bladders or skins, stuffed with various\nmaterials.\n\nAs balls are one of the most familiar spherical objects to humans, the word\n\"ball\" is used to refer to, or to describe, anything spherical or near-\nspherical.\n","title":"ball","headings":["Etymology","History","Different types of balls","See also","References"]},"micro-relation":["2: Marbles","1: Sphere","1: Ovoid","1: Ball_game","1: American_football","1: Juggling","1: Engineering","1: Ball_bearings","1: Black_powder","1: Projectile","1: Rubber","1: Christopher_Columbus","1: Mesoamerican_ballgame","1: Middle_English","1: Old_Norse","1: Proto-Germanic","1: Cognate","1: Old_High_German","1: Ancient_Greek","1: Human_baby","1: Kitten","1: Puppy","1: Ancient_Egypt","1: Homer","1: Nausicaa","1: Odysseus","1: Phaeacia","1: Alcinous","1: Jew","1: Ancient_Greece","1: Julius_Pollux","1: Episkyros","1: Ancient_Rome","1: Harpastum","1: Polo","1: Cricket","1: Football","1: Baoding_balls","1: Billiard_ball","1: Bowling_ball","1: Bowling_pin","1: Lacrosse_ball","1: Cricket_ball","1: Golf_ball","1: Rugby_union_ball","1: Australian_rules_football","1: Tennis_ball","1: Water_polo_ball","1: Buckminster_Fullerene","1: Kickball","1: Penny_floater","1: Prisoner_Ball","1: Shuttlecock","1: Super_Ball"]}
