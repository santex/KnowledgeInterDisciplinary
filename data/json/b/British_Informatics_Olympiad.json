Any student under 19 who is\nin full-time pre-university education and resident in mainland Britain is\neligible to compete. The competition is composed of two rounds - a preliminary\n3-question, 3-hour exam paper sat at the participant's school and a final round.\nThe top-15 performing students each year are invited to the finals (currently\nhosted by Trinity College, Cambridge) where they attempt to solve several more\ndifficult problems, some written, some involving programming. Typically a score\nof 70 to 80 out of 100 is required on the first round of the competition to\nreach the final.\n\nOf these fifteen, four are chosen for the British team, and one or two are\nchosen as reserves. This team goes on to represent Britain in the International\nOlympiad in Informatics in the summer of that year.\n","linknr":87,"url":"British_Informatics_Olympiad","recorded":1362501717,"links":13,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Programming contests","Competitions in the United Kingdom"],"headings":["Sponsors","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/British_Informatics_Olympiad_2008.jpg/300px-British_Informatics_Olympiad_2008.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Trinity_College,_Cambridge","International_Olympiad_in_Informatics","Lionhead_Studios"]}
