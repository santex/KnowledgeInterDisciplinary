The animal was a frequent travel\ncompanion to the singer, whose attachment to the animal led to media mockery\nand, among other factors, to a public perception of Jackson as an eccentric.\nDuring the Bad World Tour, for example, Jackson brought Bubbles with him to\nJapan, where they both drank tea with the mayor of Osaka.\n\nBubbles was initially kept at the Jackson family's home in Encino, Los Angeles,\nbut was moved to Neverland Ranch in 1988. There, he slept in a crib in Jackson's\nbedroom, used the singer's toilet, and ate candy in the Neverland movie theater.\nIn 2003 the public learned that, like all captive chimpanzees, Bubbles had\nmatured into a large and aggressive adult chimp unsuitable as a companion\nanimal. Jackson had subsequently bought two more baby chimpanzees, Max and\nAction Jackson; the public believed these two chimpanzees were also Bubbles. He was sent to a California animal trainer, where he was\nreported to have attempted suicide. When the trainer shut down his operation in\n2004, Bubbles was moved to the Center for Great Apes, a sanctuary in Wauchula,\nFlorida, where he has lived since 2005.\n","linknr":701,"url":"Bubbles_(chimpanzee)","recorded":1362480525,"links":30,"instances":["michael_jackson_song","sculpture_series","journalist","dance","behavior","musician"],"pdf":[],"categories":["1983 animal births","Michael Jackson","Individual chimpanzees","Animal actors","Primatology"],"headings":["Bubbles's acquisition","Life at Neverland Ranch","Media mockery","Out and about","Bubbles's relocations","Death of Michael Jackson","Legacy","See also","Notes","References","Bibliography","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/5f/Bubbles_the_chimpanzee.jpg/135px-Bubbles_the_chimpanzee.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/71/Michael_1988_by_himself.jpg/170px-Michael_1988_by_himself.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4d/Aerial-NeverlandZoo.jpg/300px-Aerial-NeverlandZoo.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/75/Man_of_the_woods.JPG/28px-Man_of_the_woods.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/Michael-jackson-vector-2.jpg/26px-Michael-jackson-vector-2.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Symbol_book_class2.svg/16px-Symbol_book_class2.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg/16px-Portal-puzzle.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/People_icon.svg/16px-People_icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/94/Symbol_support_vote.svg/15px-Symbol_support_vote.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["eccentricity","behavior"],["prince","musician"],["moonwalk","dance"],["bad","michael_jackson_song"],["banality","sculpture_series"],["john_blake","journalist"]],"members":["bad","banality","john_blake","moonwalk","eccentricity","prince"],"related":["Common_Chimpanzee","Austin,_Texas","United_States","Pet","Actor","Michael_Jackson","Michael_Jackson","Common_chimpanzee","Michael_Jackson","Texas","Bad_World_Tour","Osaka","Jackson_family","Encino,_Los_Angeles","Neverland_Ranch","Suicide","Center_for_Great_Apes","Wauchula,_Florida","Austin,_Texas","Animal_testing","Jackson_family","Encino,_Los_Angeles,_California","Neverland_Ranch","Diaper","Feces","Ringbearer","Elizabeth_Taylor","Eccentricity_(behavior)","Syracuse_University","Lee_Solters","Prince_(musician)","Extrasensory_perception","Moonwalk_(dance)","Bad_(Michael_Jackson_song)","Liberian_Girl","Cameo_appearance","Bad_World_Tour","Tokyo","Osaka","Japanese_green_tea","Quarantine","Kenny_Rogers","Martin_Bashir","Cheeta","Benji","Lassie","Sylmar,_California","Suicide","Center_for_Great_Apes","Orangutans","Death_of_Michael_Jackson","Cardiac_arrest","Michael_Jackson_memorial_service","Fedora","Jeff_Koons","Banality_(sculpture_series)","John_Blake_(journalist)","List_of_famous_apes","Pet_monkey","Primatology","Austin,_Texas","United_States"]}
