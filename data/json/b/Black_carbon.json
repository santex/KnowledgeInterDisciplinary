It consists of pure carbon\nin several linked forms. Black carbon warms the Earth by absorbing heat in the\natmosphere and by reducing albedo, the ability to reflect sunlight, when\ndeposited on snow and ice. Black carbon stays in the atmosphere for only several\ndays to weeks, whereas carbon dioxide () has an atmospheric lifetime of more\nthan 100 years. V. Ramanathan and G. Carmichael, Global and regional climate\nchanges due to black carbon, 1 Nature Geoscience 221-22 (23 March 2008) (âThe BC\nforcing of 0.9 W mâ2 (with a range of 0.4 to 1.2 W mâ2) â¦ is as much as 55% of\nthe CO 2 forcing and is larger than the forcing due to the other GHGs\nsuch as CH 4, CFCs, N 2O or tropospheric ozone.â) The\nterm black carbon is also used in soil sciences and geology, referring either to\ndeposited atmospheric BC or to directly incorporated BC from vegetation\nfires.

Especially for the tropics, BC in soils significantly contributes to\nfertility as it is able to absorb important plant nutrients.
