Measurable attributes of life include its complex\nphysical and chemical structures and also its utilization of free energy and the\nproduction of biomass and wastes. Due to its unique characteristics, a\nbiosignature can be interpreted as having been produced by living organisms;\nhowever, it is important that they not be considered definitive because there is\nno way of knowing in advance which ones are universal to life and which ones are\nunique to the peculiar circumstances of life on Earth.\n","linknr":440,"url":"Biosignature","recorded":1362508983,"links":21,"instances":["biology","planet","biology"],"pdf":["http://mepag.jpl.nasa.gov/meeting/jun-11/13-EMTGO_MEPAG_June2011_presentation-rev2.pdf","http://mepag.jpl.nasa.gov/meeting/jun-11/13-EMTGO_MEPAG_June2011_presentation-rev2.pdf"],"categories":["Astrobiology","Bioindicators","Biology terminology","Astrochemistry"],"headings":["In geomicrobiology","In astrobiology","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b9/Calcidiscus_leptoporus_05.jpg/220px-Calcidiscus_leptoporus_05.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/ALH84001_structures.jpg/220px-ALH84001_structures.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/Sagan_Viking.jpg/220px-Sagan_Viking.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["morphology","biology"],["cell","biology"],["life_on_mars","planet"]],"members":["cell","life_on_mars","morphology"],"related":["Isotope","Molecule","Phenomenon","Scientific_evidence","Life","Thermodynamic_free_energy","Biomass","Cellular_waste_product","Organisms","Geochemistry","Geobiology","Geomicrobiology","Organism","Microfossils","Stromatolites","Biomarkers","Isotope","Organic_matter","Fatty_acids","Bacterium","Archaea","Fatty_alcohol","Plankton","Bacteria","Biomarker","Lipids","Alkanes","Alcohols","Fatty_acids","Carbon","Peat","Epicuticular_wax","Plant","Nucleic_acids","Lipid","Protein","Amino_acid","Kerogen","Microbes","Carbonate_rock","Abiotic_component","Astrobiology","Extraterrestrial_life","Biogenic_substance","Chirality","Biogenic_silica","Photosynthetic_pigment","Magnetic","Morphology_(biology)","Magnetite","Meteorite","ALH84001","Hypothesis","Biomineralisation","ALH84001","Fossils","Cell_(biology)","Electromagnetic_radiation","SETI","Oxygen","Methane","Mars","Gas","Mass_spectrometer","Carbon-12","Carbon-14","Hydrogen","Methane","Life_on_Mars_(planet)","Extraterrestrial_atmospheres","ExoMars_Trace_Gas_Orbiter","Atmosphere_of_Mars","Viking_Lander","Mars","Viking_landers","Viking_Biological_Experiments","Metabolism","Mars_Science_Laboratory","ExoMars","Bioindicator","Biomarker","Planetary_habitability"]}
