In some Asian countries they are referred to as 'fall teeth' as\nthey will eventually fall out (see deciduous), while in almost all European\nlanguages they are called 'milk teeth'. They develop during the embryonic stage\nof development and erupt—that is, they become visible in the mouth—during\ninfancy. They are usually lost and replaced by permanent teeth, but in the\nabsence of permanent replacements, they can remain functional for many years.\n",
