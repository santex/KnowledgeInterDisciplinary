A Dictionary of Linguistics and Phonetics, Sixth Edition, Blackwell\nPublishers, 2008.</ref> The resulting neologism is called a back-formation, a\nterm coined by James Murray<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=gLuThUMAc4IC\nThe Funny Side of English], by O.A. Booty,\n[http://books.google.com/books?id=gLuThUMAc4IC&pg=PA29 p. 29]</ref> in 1889.\n(OED online first definition of 'back formation' is from the definition of to\nburgle, which was first published in 1889.)\n\nBack-formation is different from clipping&nbsp;â€“ back-formation may change\nthe part of speech or the word's meaning, whereas clipping creates shortened\nwords from longer words, but does not change the part of speech or the\nmeaning of the word.\n\nFor example, the noun resurrection was borrowed from Latin, and the verb\nresurrect was then backformed hundreds of years later from it by removing the\nion suffix. This segmentation of resurrection into resurrect + ion was possible\nbecause English had examples of Latinate words in the form of verb and verb+-ion\npairs, such as opine/opinion. These became the pattern for many more such pairs,\nwhere a verb derived from a Latin supine stem and a noun ending in ion entered\nthe language together, such as insert/insertion, project/projection, etc.\n\nBack-formation may be similar to the reanalyses of folk etymologies when it\nrests on an erroneous understanding of the morphology of the longer word. For\nexample, the singular noun asset is a back-formation from the plural assets.\nHowever, assets is originally not a plural; it is a loan-word from Anglo-Norman\nasetz (modern French assez). The -s was reanalyzed as a plural suffix.\n",
