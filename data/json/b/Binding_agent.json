{"cursor":"3138","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'binder' is any material or substance that holds or draws other materials\ntogether to form a cohesive whole. Often materials labeled as binders in\ndifferent proportions or uses can have their roles reversed with what they are\nbinding. An example would be straw helping to bind clay together as in cob, and\nclay helping to bind straw together as in a natural insulation.\n\nLiquid binders are added to a dry substance in order to draw it together in such\na way that it maintains a uniform consistency. For example, in the\nClassical World painters used materials like egg, wax, honey, or bitumen as\nbinders to mix with pigment in order to hold the pigment particles together in\nthe formation of paint. Egg-based tempera was especially popular in\nEurope from the Middle Ages until the early 16th century. However,\nsince that time, the binder of choice for paint has been oil. Today\nin the artform of sculpture, organic binders are what is traditionally used. An\norganic binder is a glue made from an animal source or a gum made from a\nvegetative source. Glue is often made by the boiling of hoofs, bones, or skin of\nanimals and then mixing the hard gelatinous residue with water. Gum-based\nbinders are made from, alternatively, the boiling of plants.\n","linknr":116,"url":"Binding_agent","recorded":1362371624,"links":24,"instances":["material"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Art materials","Adhesives","Sculpture","Painting"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cob","material"]],"members":["cob"],"related":["Cob_(material)","Classical_World","Bitumen","Pigment","Tempera","Middle_Ages","Oil_painting","Sculpture","Glue","Natural_gum"]}
