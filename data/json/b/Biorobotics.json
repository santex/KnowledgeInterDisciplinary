{"cursor":"4744","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n'Biorobotics' is a term that loosely covers the fields of cybernetics, bionics\nand even genetic engineering as a collective study.\n\nBiorobotics is often used to refer to a real subfield of robotics: studying how\nto make robots that emulate or simulate living biological organisms mechanically\nor even chemically. The term is also used in a reverse definition: making\nbiological organisms as manipulatable and functional as robots, or making\nbiological organisms as components of robots.\n\nIn the latter sense, biorobotics can be referred to as a theoretical discipline\nof comprehensive genetic engineering in which organisms are created and designed\nby artificial means. The creation of life from non-living matter for example,\nwould be biorobotics. The field is in its infancy and is sometimes known as\nsynthetic biology or bionanotechnology.\n\nIn fiction, the robots featured in Rossum's Universal Robots, the play that\noriginally coined the term, are presented as artificial biological entities\ncloser to biorobotics than the mechanical objects that the term came to refer\nto. The replicants in the film [[Blade Runner]] would be considered biorobotic\nin nature: (synthetic) organisms of living tissue and cells yet created\nartificially. Instead of microchips, their brain is based on\nganglions/artificial neurons.\n","linknr":292,"url":"Biorobotics","recorded":1362503345,"links":22,"instances":["reimagining","robot"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Biotechnology","Cybernetics","Robotics","Fictional technology","Science fiction themes","Biocybernetics"],"headings":["Bioroid","Practical experimentation","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c5/Shadow_Hand_Bulb_large.jpg/100px-Shadow_Hand_Bulb_large.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/12px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg/16px-Portal-puzzle.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/People_icon.svg/16px-People_icon.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["android","robot"],["cylon","reimagining"]],"members":["cylon","android"],"related":["Cybernetics","Bionics","Genetic_engineering","Robotics","Theoretical","Synthetic_biology","Bionanotechnology","Robot","R.U.R.","Replicant","Ganglion","Neurons","Cyberpunk","Mecha","Anime","Manga","Role-playing_game","Slavery","Replicants","Arthur_C._Clarke","Kevin_Warwick","University_of_Reading","Android_(robot)","Biomechatronics","Cultured_neural_networks","Cyborg","Cylon_(reimagining)","Nanobot","Plantoid","Replicant","Roborat","EPFL"]}
