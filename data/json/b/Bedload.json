{"cursor":"2282","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" of Campbell creek in Alaska.]]\n\nThe term 'bed load' or 'bedload' describes particles in a flowing fluid (usually\nwater) that are transported along the bed. Bed load is complementary to\nsuspended load and wash load.\n\nBed load moves by rolling, sliding, and/or saltating (hopping).\n\nGenerally, bed load downstream will be smaller and more rounded than bed load\nupstream (a process known as downstream fining). This is due in part to\nattrition and abrasion which results from the stones colliding with each other\nand against the river channel, thus removing the rough texture (rounding) and\nreducing the size of the particles. However, selective transport of sediments\nalso plays a role in relation to downstream fining: smaller-than average\nparticles are more easily entrained than larger-than average particles, since\nthe shear stress required to entrain a grain is linearly proportional to the\ndiameter of the grain. However, the degree of size selectivity is restricted by\nthe 'hiding effect' described by Parker and Klingeman (1982), wherein larger\nparticles protrude from the bed whereas small particles are shielded and hidden\nby larger particles, with the result that nearly all grain sizes become\nentrained at nearly the same shear stress.\n","linknr":112,"url":"Bedload","recorded":1362570707,"links":20,"instances":["geology","sediment","geology","physical_geography"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Geomorphology","Sedimentology"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/Thalweg_sediment_campbell_creek.jpg/300px-Thalweg_sediment_campbell_creek.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/44/Alluvions.png/40px-Alluvions.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/82/Armillary_sphere.png/30px-Armillary_sphere.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["saltation","geology"],["abrasion","geology"],["rounding","sediment"],["entrainment","physical_geography"]],"members":["abrasion","rounding","saltation","entrainment"],"related":["Campbell_creek","Alaska","Stream_bed","Suspended_load","Wash_load","Saltation_(geology)","Downstream_fining","Wear","Abrasion_(geology)","Rounding_(sediment)","Selective_transport","Entrainment_(physical_geography)"]}
