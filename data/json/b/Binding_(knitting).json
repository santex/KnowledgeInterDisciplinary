{"cursor":"1699","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":".]] In knitting, a 'gather' is a generic term for the several methods that draw\nstitches closer together laterally, i.e., within a row of knitting. Common\nmethods include:\n\n* In 'binding', a yarn loop is passed over 2 or more stitches in the same row\n  (usually adjacent to the binding loop); also known as a pullover stitch.\n* In 'clustering', the yarn is wound laterally around a set of stitches in the\n  same row, possibly several times; also known as a wrap stitch.\n* '[[Smocking]]' is a sewing or embroidery technique in which the tiny pleats\n  are drawn together with thread or yarn. Before the development of elastic,\n  smocking was used to provide a stretchable, flexible panel of fabric.\n","linknr":199,"url":"Binding_(knitting)","recorded":1362371623,"links":19,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Knitting methods for shaping"],"headings":["Related techniques","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/Knit_gathers_pullover.jpg/220px-Knit_gathers_pullover.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/Gathering_ruche.jpg/220px-Gathering_ruche.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7e/Detailed_close_up_of_multi-coloured_knitting_stitches.jpg/100px-Detailed_close_up_of_multi-coloured_knitting_stitches.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8b/Sampler_by_Elizabeth_Laidman_1760_detail_small.jpg/35px-Sampler_by_Elizabeth_Laidman_1760_detail_small.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Knitting","Sewing","Embroidery"]}
