{"cursor":"1911","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nA 'biointerface' is the interface between a cell, a biological tissue or a\nbiomaterial with another material. The motivation for biointerface science stems\nfrom the urgent need to increase the understanding of interactions between\nbiomolecules and surfaces. The behavior of complex macromolecular systems at\nmaterials interfaces are important in the fields of biology, biotechnology,\ndiagnostics, and medicine. Biointerface science is a multidisciplinary field in\nwhich (bio)chemists who synthesize novel classes of biomolecules (PNA,\npeptidomimetics, aptamers, ribozymes, and engineered proteins) cooperate with\nscientists who have developed the tools to position biomolecules with molecular\nprecision (proximal probe methods, nano-and micro contact methods, e-beam and\nX-ray lithography, and bottom up self-assembly methods), scientists who have\ndeveloped new spectroscopic techniques to interrogate these molecules at the solid-\nliquid interface, and people who integrate these into functional devices\n(applied physicists, analytical chemists and bioengineers).\n\nTopics of interest include, but are not limited to:\n\n* Neural interfaces\n* Cells in engineered microenvironments and regenerative medicine\n* Computational and modeling approaches to biointerfaces\n* Membranes and membrane-based biosensing\n* Peptides, carbohydrates and DNA at biointerfaces\n* Pathogenesis and pathogen detection\n* Molecularly designed interfaces\n* Nanotube/nanoparticle interfaces\n\nRelated fields for biointerfaces are biomineralization, biosensors, medical\nimplants, and so forth.\n","linknr":109,"url":"Biointerface","recorded":1362510045,"links":16,"instances":["medicine","biology","selective_barrier","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Neurobiology"],"headings":[],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/85/Rotaxane.png/38px-Rotaxane.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cell","biology"],["tissue","biology"],["membrane","selective_barrier"],["implant","medicine"]],"members":["implant","tissue","membrane","cell"],"related":["Cell_(biology)","Tissue_(biology)","Biology","Biotechnology","Diagnostics","Medicine","Peptide_nucleic_acid","Peptide","Aptamers","Ribozymes","Proteins","Spectroscopy","Neuron","Membrane_(selective_barrier)","Biosensing","Peptides","Carbohydrates","DNA","Pathogenesis","Membrane_nanotube","Nanoparticle","Biomineralization","Biosensors","Implant_(medicine)"]}
