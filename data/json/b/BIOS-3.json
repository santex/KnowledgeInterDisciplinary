BIOS-3 consists of a\nhabitat suitable for up to three persons, and was initially used for developing\nclosed ecosystems capable of supporting humans. It was divided into 4\ncompartments — one of which is a crew area. Initially one other\ncompartment was an algal cultivator, and the other two 'phytrons' for growing\nwheat or vegetables. Later the algal cultivator was converted into a third\nphytron. A level of light comparable to sunlight was supplied in each of the by\nxenon lamps, cooled by water jackets. The facility used of electricity, supplied\nby a nearby hydroelectric power station.\n\nChlorella algae were used to recycle air breathed by humans, absorbing carbon\ndioxide and replenishing it with oxygen through photosynthesis. The algae were\ncultivated in stacked tanks under artificial light. To achieve a balance of\noxygen and carbon dioxide, one human needed of exposed Chlorella. Air was\npurified of more complex organic compounds by heating to in the presence of a\ncatalyst. Water and nutrients were stored in advance and were also recycled. By\n1968, system efficiency had reached 85% by recycling water. Dried meat was\nimported into the facility, and urine and feces were generally dried and stored,\nrather than being recycled.\n\nBIOS-3 facilities were used to conduct 10 manned closure experiments with a one\nto three man crew. The longest experiment with a three man crew lasted (in 1972-\n1973). The facilities were used for the tests at least until 1984.\n\nIn 1991, BIOS-3 became a part of the International Center for Closed\nEcosystems, which was formed as a subdivision of Institute of Biophysics,\nRussian Academy of Sciences, Siberian Branch. Closed ecosystems research\nfocusing on growing plants and recycling waste was resumed in 2005 in\ncooperation with European Space Agency.\n","linknr":143,"url":"BIOS-3","recorded":1362505497,"links":23,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Controlled Ecological Life Support Systems","Ecological experiments","Science and technology in the Soviet Union"],"headings":["See also","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/Aegopodium_podagraria1_ies.jpg/32px-Aegopodium_podagraria1_ies.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Earth_flag_PD.jpg/32px-Earth_flag_PD.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/72/DirkvdM_rocks.jpg/32px-DirkvdM_rocks.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/Sustainable_development.svg/32px-Sustainable_development.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/Secondary_succesion_cm01.jpg/40px-Secondary_succesion_cm01.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["revised_simple_biosphere_model","sib-2"]],"members":["revised_simple_biosphere_model"],"related":["Closed_ecological_system","Krasnoyarsk","Russia","Algaculture","Xenon_arc_lamp","Chlorella","Carbon_dioxide","Oxygen","Photosynthesis","Chlorella","International_Center_for_Closed_Ecosystems","Russian_Academy_of_Sciences","European_Space_Agency","Soil_biomantle","Biosphere_reserve","Shadow_biosphere","Simple_Biosphere_model","Revised_Simple_Biosphere_Model_(SIB-2)","Closed_ecological_system","Habitable_zone","Ecosystem","Cryosphere","Geosphere","Life_support_system","Noosphere","Wardian_case","Winogradsky_column","Homeostasis","Thomas_Gold","Montreal_Biosphère","Biosphere_2"]}
