{"cursor":"24729","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\nThe 'Bay of Fundy' () is a bay on the Atlantic coast of North America, on the\nnortheast end of the Gulf of Maine between the Canadian provinces of New\nBrunswick and Nova Scotia, with a small portion touching the U.S. state of\nMaine. Some sources believe the name \"Fundy\" is a corruption of the French word\n\"Fendu\", meaning \"split\", while others believe it comes from the\nPortuguese fondo, meaning \"funnel\". The bay was also named 'Baie\nFranÃ§aise' (French Bay) by explorer/cartographer Samuel de Champlain during a\n1604 expedition led by Pierre Dugua, Sieur de Monts which resulted in a failed\nsettlement attempt on St. Croix Island.\n\nThe Bay of Fundy is known for having the highest tidal range in the world.\nRivaled by Ungava Bay in northern Quebec, King Sound in Western Australia, Gulf\nof Khambhat in India, and the Severn Estuary in the UK, it has one of the\nhighest vertical tidal ranges in the world. The Guinness Book of World Records\n(1975) declared that Burntcoat Head, Nova Scotia has the highest tides in the\nworld:  âThe Natural World, Greatest Tides: The greatest tides in\nthe world occur in the Bay of Fundy.... Burntcoat Head in the Minas Basin, Nova\nScotia, has the greatest mean spring range with 14.5 metres (47.5 feet) and an\nextreme range of 16.3 metres (53.5 feet).â \n\nPortions of the Bay of Fundy, Shepody Bay and Minas Basin, form one of six\nCanadian sites in the Western Hemisphere Shorebird Reserve Network, and is\nclassified as a Hemispheric site. {{Cite web |url=http://www.whsrn.org/site-profile/bay-\nfundy |title=Description |publisher=Western Hemisphere Shorebird Reserve Network\n|accessdate=2008-02-18}} It is administered by the provinces of New\nBrunswick and Nova Scotia, and the Canadian Wildlife Service, and is managed in\nconjunction with Ducks Unlimited Canada and the Nature Conservancy of Canada.\n\nIn July 2009, the Bay of Fundy was named as a finalist for the New 7 Wonders of\nNature contest that ended in November 2011. It was not chosen as a\nwonder. {{cite news\n  | title = New 7 Wonders omit Bay of Fundy newspaper = CBC News language =\n  | English publisher = CBC date = Nov 11, 2011 url =
