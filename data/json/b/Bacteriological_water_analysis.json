{"cursor":"9974","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Bacteriological water analysis' is a method of analysing water to estimate the\nnumbers of bacteria present and, if needed, to find out what sort of bacteria\nthey are. It is a microbiological analytical procedure which uses samples of\nwater and from these samples determines the concentration of bacteria. It is\nthen possible to draw inferences about the suitability of the water for use from\nthese concentrations. This process is used, for example, to routinely confirm\nthat water is safe for human consumption or that bathing and recreational waters\nare safe to use.\n\nThe interpretation and the action trigger levels for different waters vary\ndepending on the use made of the water. Very stringent levels applying to\ndrinking water whilst more relaxed levels apply to marine bathing waters where\nmuch lower volumes of water are expected to be ingested by users.\n","linknr":139,"url":"Bacteriological_water_analysis","recorded":1362481335,"links":15,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://water.epa.gov/scitech/methods/cwa/bioindicators/upload/2008_11_25_methods_method_biological_1680-bio.pdf","http://water.epa.gov/scitech/methods/cwa/bioindicators/upload/method_1106_1.pdf"],"categories":["Aquatic ecology","Water","Microbiology techniques"],"headings":["Approach","Methodologies","Pathogen analysis","Types of nutrient media used in analysis","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/Drinking_water.jpg/18px-Drinking_water.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Microbiology","Analysis","Recreation","Coliform","Pathogen","Molecular_biology","Chemistry","ATP_test","Nutrient","Plate_count_agar","MacConkey_agar","Gram-negative_bacteria","Microscope","Total_Viable_Count","MacConkey_agar","Lactose","Peptone","United_Kingdom","Dipotassium_phosphate","Fuchsin","Rosolic_acid","Bile","Aniline_blue","Tryptone","Yeast_extract","L-arabinose"]}
