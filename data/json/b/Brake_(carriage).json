A shooting-brake, was a\nbrake pressed into service to carry beaters, gamekeepers and sportsmen with\ntheir dogs, guns and game.\n\nThere were purpose-built shooting-brakes designed to carry the driver and a\nfootman or gamekeeper at the front facing forward, and passengers on\nlongitudinal benches, with their dogs, guns and game borne along the sides in\nslatted racks.\n\nIn the 19th century, a brake was a large, four-wheeled carriage-frame with no\nbody, used for breaking in young horses, either singly or in teams of two or\nfour. It has no body parts except for a high seat upon which the driver sits and\na small platform for a helper immediately behind.\n\nIf the passenger seats were made permanent the vehicle might be described as a\nwaggonette.\n\nCurrently the term is sometimes used for an estate car (see also shooting-brake)\nor station wagon. In France, the term break is synonymous with a station wagon,\nhaving been called a break de chasse, literally translated: hunting break.\n","linknr":96,"url":"Brake_(carriage)","recorded":1362551869,"links":15,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Carriages"],"headings":["See also","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Citroen_Ami6_Break_hi.JPG/200px-Citroen_Ami6_Break_hi.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["CitroÃ«n_Ami","Carriage","Shooting-brake","Gamekeeper","Shooting-brake","Horse_breaking","Wagonette","Estate_car","Shooting-brake","Station_wagon","France","Weirsdale,_Florida","Stony_Brook,_New_York"]}
