{"cursor":"16278","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Groundwater remediation' is the process that is used to remove pollution from\ngroundwater. Groundwater is water present below the ground surface that\nsaturates the pore space in the subsurface. At least one half of the population\nof the United States depends upon groundwater as a source of drinking\nwater. Miller, W. D. (1980). Waste Disposal Effects on Groundwater: A\nComprehensive Survey of the Occurrence and Control of Ground-Water Contamination\nResulting from Waste Disposal Particles. Berkeley, California: Premier\nPress. Groundwater is also used by farmers to irrigate crops and by\nindustries to produce everyday goods. Most groundwater is clean, but groundwater\ncan become polluted, or contaminated as a result of human activities or as a\nresult of natural conditions. The many and diverse activities of man produce\ninnumerable waste materials and by-products; before the 1980s, the regulation of\nthese wastes was less stringent and waste materials were often disposed of or\nstored on land surfaces where they percolated into the underlying soil and\neventually were carried downward, contaminating the underlying groundwater and\ntherefore jeopardizing the natural quality of it. As a result, contaminated\ngroundwater became unsuitable for use. Current practices can still impact\ngroundwater, such as the over application of fertilizer or pesticides, spills\nfrom industrial operations, infiltration from urban runoff, and leaking from\nlandfills. Using contaminated ground water causes hazards to public health\nthrough poisoning or the spread of disease, and the practice of groundwater\nremediation has been developed to address these issues. Contaminants found in\nground water cover a broad range of physical, inorganic chemical, organic\nchemical, bacteriological, and radioactive parameters. Pollutants and\ncontaminants can be removed from ground water by applying various techniques\nthereby making it safe for use.\n","linknr":235,"url":"Bioventing","recorded":1362507178,"links":10,"instances":["element","hydrodynamics","chemistry"],"pdf":["http://www.mecx.net/papers/services/MecX-MGPRemediation.pdf"],"categories":["Aquifers","Environmental science","Ecological restoration","Environmental issues with water","Phytoremediation plants|-","Water chemistry","Water pollution"],"headings":["Techniques","See also","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["mercury","element"],["precipitation","chemistry"],["plume","hydrodynamics"]],"members":["mercury","plume","precipitation"],"related":["Pollution","Groundwater","Groundwater","Bioaugmentation","Bioventing","Biosparging","Bioslurping","Phytoremediation","Ozone_and_oxygen_gas_injection","Chemical_precipitation","Membrane_technology","Ion_exchange","Carbon_absorption","Aqueous_chemical_oxidation","Surfactant_enhanced_recovery","Pump_and_treat","Air_sparging","Dual_phase_extraction","In_situ","Microorganism","Organic_matter","Hydrocarbon","Oxygen","Volatile_organic_compounds","In_situ","Saturated_zone","Petroleum","Soil","Water_table","Capillary_fringe","Light_non-aqueous_phase_liquid","Phytoremediation","Chinese_Ladder_fern","Arsenic","Populus_sect._Aegiros","Mercury_(element)","Selenium","Permeable_reactive_barriers","Precipitation_(chemistry)","Wastewater_treatment","Water_hardness","Heavy_metals","Ion_exchange","Cations","Ions","Zeolite","Bituminous_coal","Activated_carbon","In_situ_oxidation","Oxidant","Ozone","Hydrogen_peroxide","Permanganate","Persulfate","Ozone_and_oxygen","Dense_non-aqueous_phase_liquid","Dense_non-aqueous_phase_liquid","Surfactant","Dense_non-aqueous_phase_liquids","Trichloroethylene","Contaminant_plume","Osorb","Iron","In_situ","Trichloroethylene","Soil_vapor_extraction","Capillary_fringe","Capillary_fringe","Hydrocarbon","DNAPL","Solar_panels","Wind_turbine","Toxic_torts","Brownfield","CERCLA","Water_pollution","Plume_(hydrodynamics)"]}
