The lyrics contain\nvery graphic imagery about a terminated foetus and feature a great deal of\nprofanity for the time: the third and final verse begins with a couplet in which\nthe word [[fuck]] is repeated five times in rapid succession. Along with the\nlater \"Belsen Was a Gas,\" it is probably the most graphic and intense Sex\nPistols song in both its subject matter and style. Musically, it is also the\nfastest and heaviest song in the Sex Pistols canon â characterized by ominously\nthudding drums, relentlessly droning buzzsaw guitar, and maniacal shouted\nvocals. As such, it can be considered a significant antecedent to the genres of\nhardcore, thrash, and speed metal that was to emerge in the mid-to-late-1980s.\n\n\"Bodies\" is one of two songs on [[Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex\nPistols]] which original Pistols bassist Glen Matlock did not co-write. It is\nalso the only song on the album on which Sid Vicious actually plays bass,\nalthough his part was later overdubbed.

It is mostly about a fan named Pauline, who was (as the\nsong states) from Birmingham. She had been in a mental institution, where she\napparently lived in a tree house, http://www.-\nsexpistolsofficial.com/index.php?module=features&features_item_id=93#bods\nin the garden of the institution. This was where the line 'Her name was Pauline,\nshe lived in a tree' comes from. The institution was also where she seems to\nhave been raped by one of the male nurses. When she was released, she travelled\nto London, where she became a punk rock fan. She had several abortions.\nAccording to legend, she showed up once at John Lydon's door wearing nothing but\na clear plastic bag and holding an aborted fetus in a clear plastic bag.\n\nAccording to Lydon's autobiography, she told Lydon about becoming pregnant and\nthen having abortions and she described them in detail to him. This affected\nLydon enough to write the song. Most of the band also had experiences with\nPauline, but have spoken less about it.\n\nWith its repeated mentions of \"I'm not an animal,\" of \"Mummy,\" and of a dying\nbaby, the song is widely interpreted as being anti-abortion. Lydon himself, in an interview with [[Spin Magazine]],\nsaid \"I don't think there's a clearer song about the pain of abortion. The\njuxtaposition of all those different psychic things in your head and all the\nconfusion, the anger, the frustration, you have to capture in those words.\" In 2006, [[National Review]] magazine put the song at #8 on its list\nof the \"50 Greatest Conservative Rock songs\", citing a pro-life\nmessage. Miller, John J. (2006-05-26) [http://article.nationalreview.com/?q-\n=NzZkNDU5MmViNzVjNzkzMDE3NzNlN2MyZjRjYTk4YjE= Rockin' the Right], [[National\nReview]] So too, music critic Robert Christgau called it \"effectively anti-\nabortion, anti-woman, and anti-sex.\" Yet in the BBC documentary series \"Classic\nAlbums\" (2007) about The Sex Pistols' \"Never Mind The Bollocks\" album Lydon\nsaid: \"That song was hated and loathed. It's not anti-abortion, it's not pro-\nabortion. It's: \"Think about it. Don't be callous about a human being, but don't\nbe limited about a thing as \"morals\" either. Because it's immoral to bring a kid\nin this world and not give a toss about it.\" Another interpretation is to say\nthe song is about the utter tragedy of the life Pauline was leading.\n\nThe Sex Pistols' album Filthy Lucre Live - recorded at Finsbury Park, London on\n23 June 1996, and released on 29 July that year - includes a performance of\n\"Bodies.\" This same performance is a B-side on the \"Pretty Vacant (live)\"\nsingle, under the title \"Buddies,\" and is a different mix from the track on the\nlive album (the audience noise is mixed much higher, with John Lydon's vocal\nbarely audible under the audience singing the first verse). \"Buddies\" is a bonus\ntrack on the Japanese edition of Filthy Lucre Live.\n\nIn 2005, a \"barnyard\" arrangement by Steve Jones and Scott Weiland was performed\non Jones' radio show, with the use of the word \"fuck\" changed to \"pluck\".\n\nThe song has been covered by grunge-rock band Veruca Salt, Velvet Revolver,\nManic Street Preachers, The Almighty, Killing Joke, Sepultura, Raimundos and\nPeppermint Creeps.\n","linknr":226,"url":"Bodies_(Sex_Pistols_song)","recorded":1374525089,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Bodies_(Sex_Pistols_song)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Bodies_(Sex_Pistols_song)&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bodies_(Sex_Pistols_song)&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Template:Citation_needed","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/Song","/wiki/Sex_Pistols","/wiki/Never_Mind_the_Bollocks,_Here%27s_the_Sex_Pistols","/wiki/Wessex_Studios","/wiki/London","/wiki/Music_genre","/wiki/Punk_rock","/wiki/Record_label","/wiki/Virgin_Records","/wiki/Warner_Bros._Records","/wiki/Songwriter","/wiki/John_Lydon","/wiki/Steve_Jones_(musician)","/wiki/Sid_Vicious","/wiki/Paul_Cook","/wiki/Record_producer","/wiki/Chris_Thomas_(record_producer)","/wiki/Bill_Price_(record_producer)","/wiki/Never_Mind_the_Bollocks,_Here%27s_the_Sex_Pistols","/wiki/Holidays_in_the_Sun","/w/index.php?title=No_Feelings&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Sex_Pistols","/wiki/Abortion","/wiki/Never_Mind_the_Bollocks,_Here%27s_the_Sex_Pistols","/wiki/Profanity","/wiki/Couplet","/wiki/Fuck","/wiki/Belsen_Was_a_Gas","/wiki/Hardcore_punk","/wiki/Thrash_metal","/wiki/Speed_metal","/wiki/Never_Mind_the_Bollocks,_Here%27s_the_Sex_Pistols","/wiki/Glen_Matlock","/wiki/Sid_Vicious","#cite_note-SPIN-1","/wiki/Hepatitis","/wiki/Birmingham","#cite_note-sexpistolsofficial.com-2","/wiki/John_Lydon","/wiki/Fetus","/wiki/Autobiography","#cite_note-sexpistolsofficial.com-2","#cite_note-Christgau-3","/wiki/Spin_Magazine","#cite_note-SPIN-1","/wiki/National_Review","/wiki/Pro-life","#cite_note-4","/wiki/Finsbury_Park","/wiki/Pretty_Vacant","/wiki/Steve_Jones_(musician)","/wiki/Scott_Weiland","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/wiki/Veruca_Salt_(band)","/wiki/Velvet_Revolver","/wiki/Manic_Street_Preachers","/wiki/The_Almighty_(band)","/wiki/Killing_Joke","/wiki/Sepultura","/wiki/Raimundos","/wiki/Peppermint_Creeps","/w/index.php?title=Bodies_(Sex_Pistols_song)&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-SPIN_1-0","#cite_ref-SPIN_1-1","http://books.google.com/books?id=VyT02nDttPYC&pg=PA63&lpg=PA63&dq=%22sid+vicious%22+bodies+%22played+bass%22&source=bl&ots=gW8mjM_o9Y&sig=HqYmiF1ov3i1ysxG5Zq4AfE4Fck&hl=en&ei=B_NiTdHcFMzpgQfT44m0Ag&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CDQQ6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&q=%22sid%20vicious%22%20bodies%20%22played%20bass%22&f=false","#cite_ref-sexpistolsofficial.com_2-0","#cite_ref-sexpistolsofficial.com_2-1","http://www.sexpistolsofficial.com/index.php?module=features&features_item_id=93#bods","#cite_ref-Christgau_3-0","http://www.robertchristgau.com/get_artist.php?name=sex+pistols","#cite_ref-4","http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=NzZkNDU5MmViNzVjNzkzMDE3NzNlN2MyZjRjYTk4YjE=","/wiki/National_Review","/w/index.php?title=Bodies_(Sex_Pistols_song)&action=edit&section=2","http://www.metrolyrics.com/bodies-lyrics-sex-pistols.html","/wiki/MetroLyrics","/wiki/Template:Sex_Pistols","/wiki/Template_talk:Sex_Pistols","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Sex_Pistols&action=edit","/wiki/Sex_Pistols","/wiki/John_Lydon","/wiki/Steve_Jones_(musician)","/wiki/Glen_Matlock","/wiki/Paul_Cook","/wiki/Sid_Vicious","/wiki/Never_Mind_the_Bollocks,_Here%27s_the_Sex_Pistols","/wiki/The_Original_Spunk_Bootleg","/wiki/Spunk/This_Is_Crap","/wiki/The_Great_Rock_%27n%27_Roll_Swindle_(album)","/wiki/Some_Product:_Carri_on_Sex_Pistols","/wiki/Flogging_a_Dead_Horse","/wiki/Sex_Pack","/wiki/Kiss_This","/wiki/The_Filth_and_the_Fury#Soundtrack","/wiki/Jubilee_(Sex_Pistols_album)","/wiki/Sex_Pistols_Boxed_Set","/wiki/Agents_of_Anarchy","/wiki/Anarchy_in_the_U.K:_Live_at_the_76_Club","/wiki/Filthy_Lucre_Live","/wiki/Live_at_Winterland_1978","/wiki/Raw_and_Live","/wiki/Live_%26_Filthy","/wiki/Anarchy_in_the_U.K.","/wiki/God_Save_the_Queen_(Sex_Pistols_song)","/wiki/Pretty_Vacant","/wiki/Holidays_in_the_Sun","/wiki/No_One_Is_Innocent","/wiki/My_Way#Sid_Vicious_version","/wiki/Somethin%27_Else_(Eddie_Cochran_song)","/wiki/Silly_Thing_(song)","/wiki/C%27mon_Everybody","/wiki/The_Great_Rock_%27n%27_Roll_Swindle_(song)
