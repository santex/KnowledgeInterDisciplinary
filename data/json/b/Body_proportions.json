As in other Mannerist works, the proportions of the body -\nhere the neck - are exaggerated for artistic effect.]] While there is\nsignificant variation in anatomical proportions between people, there are many\nreferences to 'body proportions' that are intended to be canonical, either in\nart, measurement, or medicine.\n\nIn measurement, body proportions are often used to relate two or more\nmeasurements based on the body. A cubit, for instance, is supposed to be six\npalms. While convenient, these ratios may not reflect the physiognomic variation\nof the individuals using them.\n\nSimilarly, in art, body proportions are the study of relation of human or\nanimal body parts to each other and to the whole. These ratios are used in\nveristic depictions of the figure, and also become part of an aesthetic canon\nwithin a culture.\n","linknr":198,"url":"Body_proportions","recorded":1362556018,"links":22,"instances":["unit","slang"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Anatomy","Artistic techniques"],"headings":["Basics of human proportions","Western ideal","Japanese ideal","Leonardo da Vinci","Bibliography","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Neoteny_body_proportion_heterochrony_human.png/300px-Neoteny_body_proportion_heterochrony_human.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/Parmigianino_004.jpg/220px-Parmigianino_004.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/04/Jessica_Alba_Face_Proportions.png/220px-Jessica_Alba_Face_Proportions.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/22/Da_Vinci_Vitruve_Luc_Viatour.jpg/220px-Da_Vinci_Vitruve_Luc_Viatour.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["palm","unit"],["moe","slang"]],"members":["palm","moe"],"related":["Parmigianino","Mannerist","Neck","Art","Measurement","Medicine","Measurement","Cubit","Palm_(unit)","Art","Human_body","Aesthetic_canon","Figure_drawing","Ancient_Egyptian_art","Narmer_Palette","Alexander_the_Great","Moe_(slang)","Neoteny","Manga","Leonardo_da_Vinci","Vitruvian_man","Gottfried_Bammes","Polykleitos","Vitruvian_Man","Body_shape","Female_body_shape","Physical_attractiveness","Golden_ratio"]}
