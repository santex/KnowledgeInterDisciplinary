{"cursor":"35766","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Coagulation' ('thrombogenesis') is the process by which blood forms clots. It\nis an important part of hemostasis, the cessation of blood loss from a damaged\nvessel, wherein a damaged blood vessel wall is covered by a platelet and fibrin-\ncontaining clot to stop bleeding and begin repair of the damaged vessel.\nDisorders of coagulation can lead to an increased risk of bleeding (hemorrhage)\nor obstructive clotting (thrombosis).\n\nCoagulation is highly conserved throughout biology; in all mammals, coagulation\ninvolves both a cellular (platelet) and a protein (coagulation factor)\ncomponent. The system in humans has been the\nmost extensively researched and is the best understood.\n\nCoagulation begins almost instantly after an injury to the blood vessel has\ndamaged the endothelium lining the vessel. Exposure of the blood to proteins\nsuch as tissue factor initiates changes to blood platelets and the plasma\nprotein fibrinogen, a clotting factor. Platelets immediately form a plug at the\nsite of injury; this is called primary hemostasis. Secondary hemostasis occurs\nsimultaneously: Proteins in the blood plasma, called coagulation factors or\nclotting factors, respond in a complex cascade to form fibrin strands, which\nstrengthen the platelet plug.\n","linknr":759,"url":"Blood_clotting_cascade","recorded":1362484363,"links":59,"instances":["genetics","physiologist"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Coagulation
