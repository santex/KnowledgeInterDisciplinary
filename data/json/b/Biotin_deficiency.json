It can occur in people of any age,\nancestry, or gender. Biotin is part of the B vitamin family. Biotin deficiency\nrarely occurs among healthy people because the daily requirement of biotin is\nlow, many foods provide adequate amounts of it, intestinal bacteria synthesize\nsmall amounts of it, and the body effectively scavenges and recycles it from\nbodily waste. However, deficiencies can be caused by consuming raw egg whites\nover a period of months to years. Egg whites contain high levels of avidin, a\nprotein that binds biotin strongly. When cooked, avidin is partially denatured\nand becomes somewhat non-toxic. A recent study found that activity in\nfried, poached and boiled (2 min) egg white was 33, 71 and 40% of the activity\nin raw egg white respectively.\n","linknr":339,"url":"Biotin_deficiency","recorded":1362503029,"links":14,"instances":["mood","symptom","biochemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Vitamin deficiencies"],"headings":["Symptoms","Causes","Diagnosis","Treatment","Epidemiology","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/85/Biotin_structure.svg/230px-Biotin_structure.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["denaturation","biochemistry"],["anorexia","symptom"],["depression","mood"]],"members":["depression","anorexia","denaturation"],"related":["Biotin","Biotin","Intestinal","Bacteria","Egg_white","Avidin","Denaturation_(biochemistry)","Catabolism","Biotin","Histones","Transposable_elements","Biotinidase","Rashes","Alopecia","Anemia","Seborrheic_dermatitis","Fungal_infection_in_animals","Hallucination","Lethargy","Anorexia_(symptom)","Depression_(mood)","Somnolence","Paresthesias","Biotinidase_deficiency","Biotinidase_deficiency","Homozygous","Heterozygous","Catabolism","Short_bowel_syndrome","Urine","Lymphocytes","Biotinidase_deficiency","Holocarboxylase_synthetase_deficiency","Multiple_carboxylase_deficiency"]}
