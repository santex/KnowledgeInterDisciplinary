It is now generally considered to be a\nclassic of sunshine pop.\n\nBegin has been reissued numerous times throughout the years, despite the\nextremely poor sales of the original release, and has been reissued in three\ndifferent configurations on CD. The 1990 reissue featured truncated cover art,\nbut included brief interviews with several band members in the liner notes and\nboth sides of a rare promotional single, \"Just About The Same\" b/w \"Blight\". A\nlater reissue featured the single versions of several tracks from the album. In\n2001 the album reissued as the third CD in the three-disc set [[Magic Time\n(compilation album)|Magic Time]], released by Sundazed Records in 2001. It\nfeatures all of the bonus tracks from the two previous versions, but \"Just About\nThe Same\" and \"Blight\" are presented in mono, whereas they were presented in\ntheir original stereo mixes on the 1990 release. In 2012, a Japan-exclusive box\nset was released with 8 discs, including Begin, using the latest DSD\nremastering. This release was overseen by an original Millennium member and is a\nlimited edition.\n\nTo date the Music On Vinyl and Sundazed labels have also reissued the album\nagain on vinyl.\n\nThe track listing below is for the original album.\n","linknr":123,"url":"Begin_(The_Millennium_album)","recorded":1363395235,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Begin_(The_Millennium_album)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Begin_(The_Millennium_album)&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/File:Begin_Millennium.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/90/Begin_Millennium.jpg","/wiki/Studio_album","/wiki/The_Millennium","/wiki/Music_genre","/wiki/Sunshine_pop","/wiki/Record_label","/wiki/Columbia_Records","/wiki/Record_producer","/wiki/Curt_Boettcher","/wiki/Keith_Olsen","/wiki/The_Millennium","/wiki/Magic_Time_(compilation_album)","/wiki/Allmusic","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Star_full.svg/11px-Star_full.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Star_full.svg/11px-Star_full.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Star_full.svg/11px-Star_full.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Star_full.svg/11px-Star_full.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/Star_half.svg/11px-Star_half.svg.png","#cite_note-1","/wiki/The_Millennium","/wiki/Columbia_Records","/wiki/Sunshine_pop","/wiki/Compact_disc","/wiki/Compact_disc","/wiki/Magic_Time_(compilation_album)","/wiki/Sundazed_Records","/w/index.php?title=Music_On_Vinyl&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Sundazed","#Track_listing","#Personnel","#Production_notes","#References","/w/index.php?title=Begin_(The_Millennium_album)&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Doug_Rhodes","/wiki/Michael_Fennelly_(musician)","/wiki/Joey_Stec","/wiki/Curt_Boettcher","/wiki/5_A.M._(The_Millennium_song)","/wiki/Graham_Salisbury","/wiki/Lee_Mallory","/w/index.php?title=It%27s_You_(The_Millennium_song)&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Begin_(The_Millennium_album)&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Curt_Boettcher","/wiki/Red_Rhodes","/wiki/The_Dillards","/w/index.php?title=Begin_(The_Millennium_album)&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/Gary_Usher","/w/index.php?title=Begin_(The_Millennium_album)&action=edit&section=4","#cite_ref-1","http://www.allmusic.com/album/r13061","/wiki/Allmusic","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Begin_(The_Millennium_album)&oldid=515230701","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:The_Millennium_albums","/wiki/Category:1968_debut_albums","/wiki/Category:Albums_produced_by_Curt_Boettcher","/wiki/Category:Columbia_Records_albums","/wiki/Category:English-language_albums","/wiki/Category:Albums_produced_by_Keith_Olsen","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_hAudio_microformats","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Begin+%28The+Millennium+album%29&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Begin+%28The+Millennium+album%29","/wiki/Begin_(The_Millennium_album)","/wiki/Talk:Begin_(The_Millennium_album)","#","/wiki/Begin_(The_Millennium_album)","/w/index.php?title=Begin_(The_Millennium_album)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Begin_(The_Millennium_album)&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Begin_(The_Millennium_album)","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Begin_(The_Millennium_album)","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Begin_(The_Millennium_album)&oldid=515230701","/w/index.php?title=Begin_(The_Millennium_album)&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Begin_%28The_Millennium_album%29&id=515230701","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Begin+%28The+Millennium+album%29","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Begin+%28The+Millennium+album%29&oldid=515230701&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Begin_(The_Millennium_album)&printable=yes","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_
