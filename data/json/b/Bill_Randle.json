{"cursor":"6698","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Bill Randle' (March 14, 1923 â July 9, 2004) was an American disc jockey,\nlawyer and university professor.\n\nHe was born 'William McKinley Randle Jr.' in Detroit, Michigan. In Detroit, he\nhosted a popular show on WJLB-AM radio (now WDTK) called The Interracial\nGoodwill Hour, featuring rhythm and blues music and hot jazz. As a pioneering\ndisc jockey at radio station WERE in Cleveland, Ohio he helped change the face\nof American music. In the 1950s, [[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine]] called Bill\nRandle the top DJ in America. His popularity and huge listening audience allowed\nhim to bolster the careers of a number of young musicians, including The Four\nLads, Bobby Darin, and Fats Domino. Nicknamed \"The Pied Piper of Cleveland\", a\n1955 musical documentary film was made about him titled [[The Pied Piper of\nCleveland|The Pied Piper of Cleveland: A Day in the Life of a Famous Disc\nJockey]]. The film includes a Cleveland concert at Brooklyn High School on\nOctober 20, 1955 featuring Pat Boone and Bill Haley & His Comets with Elvis\nPresley as the opening act. It is the first film footage of a Presley\nperformance.\n\nCuriously enough, Randle almost did not survive early radio. One Thanksgiving,\nhe played an unusual version of \"Silent Night\" sung by gospel and blues artist\nSister Rosetta Tharpe. Many persons called in to complain and the station\nmanager, longtime radio and television fixture Sidney Andorn fired Randle. The\nnext morning, WERE owner Ray T. Miller, the chairman of the Cuyahoga County\nDemocratic Party, rehired Randle after he learned he had so many listeners to\nRandle's program, and fired Andorn instead.\n\nWhile working in Cleveland, Randle would travel back to Detroit for some radio\nprograms. In the late 1950s, Randle would fly back and forth from Cleveland to\nNew York where he produced radio shows in both markets (at WERE and WCBS-AM,\nrespectively). He sat alongside other top DJs of the era including Carl Reese,\nPhil McLean and Howie Lund.\n\nMany songs that Randle championed on-air ended up as commercial hits, the most\nsuccessful of which was an edited 45 rpm single of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir's\n\"Battle Hymn of the Republic.\" That version, which Randle suggested to and\narranged with Columbia Records (then owned by CBS and a sister property to WCBS-\nAM) was an unlikely hit in 1959; it ended up on the Billboard charts for 11\nweeks and reached as high as #13 on Billboard's \"Hot 100\" that autumn. In\naddition, the album \"The Lord's Prayer\" hit No. 1 and stayed on the charts for\n80 weeks, and the choir won the 1960 Grammy Award for Best Performance by a\nVocal Group or Chorus.\n\nA wealthy Bill Randle left Cleveland radio in the 1960s to enhance his\neducation. During the 1960s, Randle appeared on the local CBS affiliates in New\nYork City interviewing celebrities. He obtained an undergraduate degree from\nWayne State University and a law degree from Oklahoma City University. He went\non to earn a doctorate in American studies, a master's degree in sociology from\nWestern Reserve University, a master's degree in journalism from Kent State\nUniversity and a master's degree in education from Cleveland State University.\nHe also has an honorary doctorate from Bowling Green State University. Randle\nalso studied history at Columbia University under Richard Hofstadter. While away\nfrom radio, Randle taught popular music at Case Western Reserve University\nassisted by Roger Lee Hall. Randle also taught communications at Kent State\nUniversity and the University of Cincinnati.\n\nAt age 64, he passed the Ohio State Bar exams and opened a law office in\nLakewood, Ohio where he practiced bankruptcy and estate planning law for sixteen\nyears. He also was knowledgeable in energy and zoning law. In addition, Randle\nbecame an educator, and taught sociology and mass communication classes at\nseveral universities.\n\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, Randle resurfaced on several different Cleveland\nradio stations, even hosting a talk show on WBBG 1260-AM back in 1977. In the\n1990s, Randle joined the airstaff of the now-defunct WRMR 850-AM, anchoring the\n\"Big Show\" on Sunday afternoons and an late-afternoon program. His success in\nafternoon drive prompted station management to move him to morning drive time in\nApril 1998. While the station's format was adult standards similar to the Music\nof Your Life satellite network, Randle's shows bucked the mold, featuring a\nunique combination of big band standards, early rock and roll, and new artists\nsuch as Norah Jones, Michael Buble, *N Sync, Jewel, Sarah Vaughn, Dido and the\nBackstreet Boys. Following an ownership, format and frequency swap in 2001,\nRandle retired from full-time on-air duties at WRMR. However, he would rejoin\nthe rechristened WCLV 1420-AM a year later with a Saturday night music show,\nwhich would ultimately move back to Sunday afternoons as the \"Big Show.\" (WCLV\nwould revert to the WRMR call letters in 2003.)\n\nDr. Randle died of cancer in Cleveland on July 9, 2004. In a sad irony, WRMR was\nsold off the day before, and signed off two days later with Randle's final\nbroadcast, which had been prerecorded via voice-tracking.\n\nHis wife of 51 years, Annalee, with whom he had a daughter, Patricia,\npredeceased him in 2000.\n","linknr":151,"url":"Bill_Randle","recorded":1374858092,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Bill_Randle&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Bill_Randle&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bill_Randle&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/Disc_jockey","/wiki/Lawyer","/wiki/University","/wiki/Professor","/wiki/Detroit,_Michigan","/wiki/WDTK","/wiki/Radio","/wiki/WERE","/wiki/Cleveland,_Ohio","/wiki/Time_(magazine)","/wiki/The_Four_Lads","/wiki/Bobby_Darin","/wiki/Fats_Domino","/wiki/Documentary_film","/wiki/The_Pied_Piper_of_Cleveland","/wiki/Pat_Boone","/wiki/Bill_Haley_%26_His_Comets","/wiki/Elvis_Presley","/wiki/Sister_Rosetta_Tharpe","/wiki/WCBS_(AM)","/wiki/Gramophone_record","/wiki/Mormon_Tabernacle_Choir","/wiki/Battle_Hymn_of_the_Republic","/wiki/Columbia_Records","/wiki/Wayne_State_University","/wiki/Law_degree","/wiki/Oklahoma_City_University","/wiki/Doctorate","/wiki/American_studies","/wiki/Master%27s_degree","/wiki/Sociology","/wiki/Western_Reserve_University","/wiki/Journalism","/wiki/Kent_State_University","/wiki/Cleveland_State_University","/wiki/Columbia_University","/wiki/Roger_Lee_Hall","/wiki/University_of_Cincinnati","/wiki/Ohio","/wiki/Bar_association","/wiki/Lakewood,_Ohio","/wiki/WWMK","/wiki/WKNR#WRMR_.28850_AM.29","/wiki/Music_of_Your_Life","/wiki/Cancer","/wiki/Voice-tracking","/w/index.php?title=Bill_Randle&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/File:P_vip.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/69/P_vip.svg/28px-P_vip.svg.png","/wiki/Portal:Biography","http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=9076850","/wiki/Find_a_Grave","http://www.americanmusicpreservation.com/earlyelviscleveland2.htm","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/66059240","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bill_Randle&oldid=565439459","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1923_births","/wiki/Category:2004_deaths","/wiki/Category:American_radio_personalities","/wiki/Category:American_academics","/wiki/Category:American_educators","/wiki/Category:Ohio_lawyers","/wiki/Category:People_from_Cleveland,_Ohio","/wiki/Category:Kent_State_University_alumni","/wiki/Category:Cleveland_State_University_alumni","/wiki/Category:Wayne_State_University_alumni","/wiki/Category:Kent_State_University_faculty","/wiki/Category:University_of_Cincinnati_faculty","/wiki/Category:Case_Western_Reserve_University_alumni","/wiki/Category:Columbia_University_alumni","/wiki/Category:Oklahoma_City_University_alumni","/wiki/Category:Cancer_deaths_in_Ohio","/wiki/Category:Articles_lacking_sources_from_May_2008","/wiki/Category:All_articles_lacking_sources","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Bill+Randle&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Bill+Randle","/wiki/Bill_Randle","/wiki/Talk:Bill_Randle","#","/wiki/Bill_Randle","/w/index.php?title=Bill_Randle&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Bill_Randle&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Bill_Randle","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Bill_Randle","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Bill_Randle&oldid=565439459","/w/index.php?title=Bi
