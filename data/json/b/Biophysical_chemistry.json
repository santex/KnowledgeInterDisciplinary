{"cursor":"2778","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Biophysical chemistry' is a relatively new branch of chemistry that covers a\nbroad spectrum of research activities involving biological systems. The most\ncommon feature of the research in this subject is to seek explanation of the\nvarious phenomena in biological systems in terms of either the molecules that\nmake up the system or the supra-molecular structure of these systems.\n\nBiophysical chemists employ various techniques used in physical chemistry to\nprobe the structure of biological systems. These techniques include\nspectroscopic methods like nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and X-ray\ndiffraction. For example, the work for which Nobel Prize was awarded in 2009 to\nthree chemists was based on x-ray diffraction studies of ribosomes. [http:/-\n/nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2009/press.html The Nobel Prize\nin Chemistry 2009 - Press Release ] Some of the\nareas in which biophysical chemists engage themselves are protein structure and\nthe functional structure of cell membranes. For example, enzyme action can be\nexplained in terms of the shape of a pocket in the protein molecule that matches\nthe shape of the substrate molecule or its modification due to binding of a\nmetal ion. Similarly the structure and function of the biomembranes may be\nunderstood through the study of model supramolecular structures as liposomes or\nphospholipid vesicles of different compositions and sizes.\n\nThe oldest reputed institute for biophysical chemistry is Max Planck Institute\nfor Biophysical Chemistry in GÃ¶ttingen.\n","linknr":164,"url":"Biophysical_chemistry","recorded":1362509814,"links":19,"instances":["biology","biochemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Chemistry","Biophysics"],"headings":["See also","References","Publications"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/Chem_template.svg/32px-Chem_template.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["substrate","biochemistry"],["vesicle","biology"]],"members":["vesicle","substrate"],"related":["Chemistry","Systems_biology","Supramolecular_chemistry","Physical_chemistry","Nuclear_magnetic_resonance","X-ray_diffraction","Ribosomes","Protein_structure","Cell_membranes","Enzyme","Substrate_(biochemistry)","Liposomes","Phospholipid","Vesicle_(biology)","Max_Planck_Institute_for_Biophysical_Chemistry","Göttingen","Biophysical_techniques","Biophysics","Biochemistry","Biophysical_Journal","Academic_Press","Academic_Press","Biochimica_et_Biophysica_Acta","Elsevier_Science","Elsevier_Science","Elsevier_Science"]}
