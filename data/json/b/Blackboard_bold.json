{"cursor":"13942","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\n'Blackboard bold' is a typeface style that is often used for certain symbols in\nmathematical texts, in which certain lines of the symbol (usually vertical or\nnear-vertical lines) are doubled. The symbols usually denote number sets.\nBlackboard bold symbols are also referred to as 'double struck', although they\ncannot actually be produced by double striking on a typewriter.\n\nThe Chicago Manual of Style in 1993 (14th edition) advises: \"blackboard bold\nshould be confined to the classroom\" (13.14) whereas in 2003 (15th edition) it\nstates that \"open-faced (blackboard) symbols are reserved for familiar systems\nof numbers\" (14.12).\n\nIn some texts these symbols are simply shown in bold type: blackboard bold in\nfact originated from the attempt to write bold letters on blackboards in a way\nthat clearly differentiated them from non-bold letters, and then made its way\nback in print form as a separate style from ordinary bold, [http://groups.google.com/group/comp.text.tex/browse_thread/thread/55bd-\n03b808263cee/6300d1a3a394ccb9 Google Groups] possibly starting with the\noriginal 1965 edition of Gunning and Rossi's textbook on complex\nanalysis. Some mathematicians, therefore, do not recognize blackboard\nbold as a separate style from bold: Jean-Pierre Serre, for example, has publicly\ninveighed against the use of \"blackboard bold\" anywhere other than on a\nblackboard, and uses double-struck letters when writing bold on the blackboard, [http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xf88g3_jean-pierre-serre-\nwriting-mathemati_tech \"Writing Mathematics Badly\" video talk (part 3/3)],\nstarting at 7′08″ whereas his published works consistently use\nordinary bold for the same symbols. E.g.,  Donald Knuth also advises\nagainst the use of blackboard bold in print. Krantz, S., Handbook of\nTypography for the Mathematical Sciences, Chapman & Hall/CRC, Boca Raton,\nFlorida, 2001, p. 35.\n\nIt is sometimes erroneously claimed that Bourbaki\nintroduced the blackboard bold notation, but whereas individual members of the\nBourbaki group may have popularized double-striking bold characters on the\nblackboard, their printed books use ordinary bold. E.g., \n\nThe symbols are nearly universal in their interpretation, unlike their normally-\ntypeset counterparts, which are used for many different purposes.\n\nTeX, the standard typesetting system for mathematical texts, does not contain\ndirect support for blackboard bold symbols, but the add-on AMS Fonts package\n( amsfonts ) by the American Mathematical Society provides this\nfacility; a blackboard bold 'R' is written as \\mathbb{R} .\n\nIn Unicode, a few of the more common blackboard bold characters ('C', 'H', 'N',\n'P', 'Q', 'R' and 'Z') are encoded in the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP) in the\nLetterlike Symbols (2100â214F) area, named DOUBLE-STRUCK CAPITAL C etc. The\nrest, however, are encoded outside the BMP, from U+1D538 to\nU+1D550 (uppercase, excluding those encoded in the BMP),\nU+1D552 to U+1D56B (lowercase) and\nU+1D7D8 to U+1D7E1 (digits). Being outside the BMP,\nthese are relatively new and not widely supported.\n","linknr":251,"url":"Blackboard_bold","recorded":1362374589,"links":20,"instances":["mathematics","mathematician","mathematics","mathematics","calculus","algebraic_geometry","mathematics","mathematics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Mathematical
