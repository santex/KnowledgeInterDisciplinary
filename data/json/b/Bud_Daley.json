The move impaired his effectiveness as a\npitcher. Frank Lane was responsible for trading Daley to the Athletics and then\nto the Yankees.\n\nIt is often rumoured that Daley was born naturally right-handed but developed\npolio as a child causing one arm to be shorter than the other. In fact Daley was\nborn left-handed and his right arm and side are healthy. He did suffer temporary\nparalysis to his right arm after birth due to forceps pinching a nerve. However,\nmassage and exercise restored the limb to health. Daley's mother, Mrs. E.G.\nPetzoldt, once said, No one wanted a baby more than I did. But Buddy was so\ncrippled I didn't want him to live.. His right arm remained so crippled as an\nadult that he could barely raise it high enough to comb his hair. Looking For A Sleeper, Pasadena Star-News, October 4, 1961, Page\n25. Despite a slightly withered right arm, Daley served as a fifth\ninfielder, was competitive as a batter, shot golf in the low 80s, and was a\nproficient fisherman.\n","linknr":256,"url":"Bud_Daley","recorded":1374545080,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Bud_Daley&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Bud_Daley&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Pitcher","/wiki/Orange,_California","/wiki/Win%E2%80%93loss_record_(pitching)","/wiki/Earned_run_average","/wiki/Strikeout","/wiki/Cleveland_Indians","/wiki/1955_in_baseball","/wiki/1957_in_baseball","/wiki/Oakland_Athletics","/wiki/1958_in_baseball","/wiki/1961_in_baseball","/wiki/New_York_Yankees","/wiki/1961_in_baseball","/wiki/1964_in_baseball","/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game","/wiki/1959_Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game_(disambiguation)","/wiki/1960_Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game_(disambiguation)","/wiki/World_Series","/wiki/1961_World_Series","/wiki/1962_World_Series","/wiki/Pope_Leo_IV","/wiki/Catholicism","/wiki/Long_Beach,_California","#cite_note-trade-1","/wiki/Knuckleball","#cite_note-bud-2","#cite_note-trade-1","/wiki/All-Star","/wiki/Kansas_City_Athletics","/wiki/American_League","/wiki/New_York_Yankees","/wiki/1961_World_Series","/wiki/Cincinnati_Reds","/wiki/Cleveland_Indians","/wiki/Sacramento_Solons","/wiki/Pacific_Coast_League","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Bob_Lemon","#cite_note-bud-2","/wiki/Briggs_Stadium","/wiki/Detroit_Tigers","/wiki/Harvey_Kuenn","#cite_note-4","/wiki/Indianapolis_Indians","#cite_note-5","/wiki/American_Association_(20th_century)","#cite_note-6","/wiki/Gene_Woodling","/wiki/Dick_Williams","/wiki/Baltimore_Orioles","/wiki/Larry_Doby","/wiki/Don_Ferrarese","#cite_note-7","/wiki/Arnie_Portocarrero","#cite_note-8","#cite_note-9","/wiki/Casey_Stengel","/wiki/American_League","#cite_note-10","/wiki/Walt_Dropo","#cite_note-11","#cite_note-12","/wiki/E.R.A.","#cite_note-trade-1","#cite_note-13","/wiki/Minnesota_Twins","/wiki/Tom_Sturdivant","#cite_note-14","#cite_note-15","/wiki/Bob_Cerv","/wiki/Detroit_Tigers","#cite_note-16","/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox","/wiki/Ted_Williams","#cite_note-17","#cite_note-18","/wiki/Frank_Lane","#cite_note-bud-2","/wiki/Polio","#cite_note-bud-2","#cite_note-trade-1","/w/index.php?title=Bud_Daley&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-trade_1-0","#cite_ref-trade_1-1","#cite_ref-trade_1-2","#cite_ref-trade_1-3","/wiki/Iowa_City","#cite_ref-bud_2-0","#cite_ref-bud_2-1","#cite_ref-bud_2-2","#cite_ref-bud_2-3","#cite_ref-3","/wiki/New_York_Times","#cite_ref-4","#cite_ref-5","#cite_ref-6","#cite_ref-7","#cite_ref-8","#cite_ref-9","#cite_ref-10","#cite_ref-11","#cite_ref-12","#cite_ref-13","#cite_ref-14","#cite_ref-15","#cite_ref-16","#cite_ref-17","#cite_ref-18","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0-7864-1828-1","/wiki/Help:CS1_errors#accessdate_missing_url","/w/index.php?title=Bud_Daley&action=edit&section=2","http://www.baseball-almanac.com/players/player.php?p=daleybu01","http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/d/daleybu01.shtml","/wiki/Template:1961_New_York_Yankees","/wiki/Template_talk:1961_New_York_Yankees","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:1961_New_York_Yankees&action=edit","/wiki/New_York_Yankees","/wiki/1961_World_Series","/wiki/Bobby_Richardson","/wiki/Clete_Boyer","/wiki/Mickey_Mantle","/wiki/Yogi_Berra","/wiki/Roger_Maris","/wiki/Tony_Kubek","/wiki/H%C3%A9ctor_L%C3%B3pez","/wiki/Billy_Gardner","/wiki/Bill_Skowron","/wiki/Jack_Reed_(baseball)","/wiki/Whitey_Ford","/wiki/World_Series_Most_Valuable_Player_Award","/wiki/Bill_Stafford","/wiki/Ralph_Terry","/wiki/Elston_Howard","/wiki/Johnny_Blanchard","/wiki/Jim_Coates","/wiki/Luis_Arroyo","/wiki/Ralph_Houk","/wiki/Frankie_Crosetti","/wiki/Earl_Torgeson","/wiki/Johnny_Sain","/wiki/Wally_Moses","/wiki/Jim_Hegan","/wiki/1961_New_York_Yankees_season","/wiki/Template:1962_New_York_Yankees","/wiki/Template_talk:1962_New_York_Yankees","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:1962_New_York_Yankees&action=edit","/wiki/New_York_Yankees","/wiki/1962_World_Series","/wiki/Bobby_Richardson","/wiki/Clete_Boyer","/wiki/Mickey_Mantle","/wiki/Yogi_Berra","/wiki/Roger_Maris","/wiki/Tony_Kubek","/wiki/H%C3%A9ctor_L%C3%B3pez","/wiki/Bill_Skowron","/wiki/Tom_Tresh","/wiki/Whitey_Ford","/wiki/Bill_Stafford","/wiki/Ralph_Terry","/wiki/World_Series_Most_Valuable_Player_Award","/wiki/Dale_Long","/wiki/Mars
