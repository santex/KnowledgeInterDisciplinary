The text of the Convention, as well as the\nkey documents from recent meetings can be found on the BWC Implementation\nSupport Unit [http://www.unog.ch/bwc/ website].\n\nThe Convention was the result of prolonged efforts by the international\ncommunity to establish a new instrument that would supplement the 1925 Geneva\nProtocol. The Geneva Protocol prohibited use but not possession or development\nof chemical and biological weapons.\n\nA draft of the BWC, submitted by the British http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/w-\norldwars/coldwar/pox_weapon_01.shtml was opened for signature on April 10,\n1972 and entered into force March 26, 1975 when twenty-two governments had\ndeposited their instruments of ratification. It currently commits the 170 states\nwhich are party to it to prohibit the development, production, and stockpiling\nof biological and toxin weapons. However, the absence of any formal verification\nregime to monitor compliance has limited the effectiveness of the Convention. As\nof April 2013, an additional 10 states have signed the BWC but have yet to\nratify the treaty.\n\nThe scope of the BWCâs prohibition is defined in Article 1 (the so-called\ngeneral purpose criterion). This includes all microbial and other biological\nagents or toxins and their means of delivery (with exceptions for medical and\ndefensive purposes in small quantities). Subsequent Review Conferences have\nreaffirmed that the general purpose criterion encompasses all future scientific\nand technological developments relevant to the Convention. It is not the objects\nthemselves (biological agents or toxins), but rather certain purposes for which\nthey may be employed which are prohibited; similar to Art.II, 1 in the Chemical\nWeapons Convention (CWC). Permitted purposes under the BWC are defined as\nprophylactic, protective and other peaceful purposes. The objects may not be\nretained in quantities that have no justification or which are inconsistent with\nthe permitted purposes.\n\nAs stated in Article 1 of the BWC:\n\n\"Each State Party to this Convention undertakes never in any circumstances to\ndevelop, produce, stockpile or otherwise acquire or retain:\n\n* (1) Microbial or other biological agents, or toxins whatever their origin or\n  method of production, of types and in quantities that have no justification\n  for prophylactic, protective or other peaceful purposes;\n\n* (2) Weapons, equipment or means of delivery designed to use such agents or\n  toxins for hostile purposes or in armed conflict.\"\n","linknr":420,"url":"Biological_Weapons_Convention","recorded":1372153325,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Biological_Weapons_Convention&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Biological_Weapons_Convention&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:INCITE","/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Fact_and_Reference_Check","/wiki/Wikipedia:When_to_cite","/wiki/London","/wiki/Moscow","/wiki/Washington,_D.C.","/wiki/List_of_parties_to_the_Biological_Weapons_Convention","/wiki/File:BWC_Participation.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e2/BWC_Participation.svg/300px-BWC_Participation.svg.png","/wiki/File:BWC_Participation.svg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf5/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Geneva_Protocol","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Biological_weapons","/wiki/Chemical_Weapons_Convention","#Summary","#Membership","#Verification_and_compliance_issues","#Review_conferences","#Fifth_Review_Conference","#Sixth_Review_Conference","#Seventh_Review_Conference","#See_also","#Notes","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Biological_Weapons_Convention&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Biological_weapons","/wiki/Biological_weapons","/wiki/Biological_weapons","/wiki/Security_Council","/wiki/Biology","/wiki/Technology","/w/index.php?title=Biological_Weapons_Convention&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/List_of_parties_to_the_Biological_Weapons_Convention","/wiki/Republic_of_China","/wiki/People%27s_Republic_of_China","/wiki/Reservation_(law)","/wiki/Prophylactic","/wiki/Israel","/w/index.php?title=Biological_Weapons_Convention&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/United_Nations","/wiki/George_W._Bush","/wiki/United_States","/w/index.php?title=Biological_Weapons_Convention&action=edit&section=4","/w/index.php?title=Biological_Weapons_Convention&action=edit&section=5","/wiki/9/11","/wiki/Anthrax","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Toxins","/wiki/Disease","/wiki/Code_of_conduct","/wiki/Scientists","/w/index.php?title=Biological_Weapons_Convention&action=edit&section=6","/w/index.php?title=Biological_Weapons_Convention&action=edit&section=7","/wiki/File:Gnome_globe_current_event.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Gnome_globe_current_event.svg/42px-Gnome_globe_current_event.svg.png","#cite_note-4","/w/index.php?title=Biological_Weapons_Convention&action=edit&section=8","/wiki/Statement_on_Chemical_and_Biological_Defense_Policies_and_Programs","/wiki/Weapons_of_mass_destruction","/wiki/Chemical_Weapons_Convention","/w/index.php?title=Biological_Weapons_Convention&action=edit&section=9","#cite_ref-1","http://www.unog.ch/bwc/","#cite_ref-2","http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/worldwars/coldwar/pox_weapon_01.shtml","#cite_ref-3","http://www.unog.ch/bwc/","http://documents.un.org/","#cite_ref-4","http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G12/600/60/PDF/G1260060.pdf","/w/index.php?title=Biological_Weapons_Convention&action=edit&section=10","http://www.unog.ch/bwc/","http://www.opbw.org/","http://www.bwc2011.info/","http://www.opbw.org/convention/conv.html","http://www.un.org/disarmament/WMD/Bio/BioSecondPageBWC.shtml","http://boudewijndejonge.googlepages.com/Institutional_governance_OPBW.pdf","http://russianbiochemicalweapons.blogspot.com/","http://www.iss.europa.eu/nc/actualites/actualite/select_category/21/article/enforcing-non-proliferation-the-european-union-and-the-2006-btwc-review-conference/","/wiki/European_Union_Institute_for_Security_Studies","/wiki/Template:Bioterrorism","/wiki/Template_talk:Bioterrorism","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Bioterrorism&action=edit","/wiki/Bioterrorism","/wiki/1984_Rajneeshee_bioterror_attack","/wiki/1989_California_medfly_attack","/wiki/2001_anthrax_attacks","/wiki/Wood_Green_ricin_plot","/wiki/2003_ricin_letters","/wiki/2013_ricin_letters","/wiki/Australia_Group","/wiki/Center_for_Biosecurity","/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention","/wiki/Council_of_Europe_Convention_on_the_Prevention_of_Terrorism","/wiki/DARPA","/wiki/Defense_Threat_Reduction_Agency","/wiki/European_Centre_for_Disease_Prevention_and_Co
