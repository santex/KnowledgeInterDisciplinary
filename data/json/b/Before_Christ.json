This\ncalendar era is based on the traditionally reckoned year of the conception or\nbirth of Jesus of Nazareth, with AD counting years from the start of this epoch,\nand BC denoting years before the start of the era. There is no year zero in this\nscheme, so the year AD 1 immediately follows the year 1 BC. This\ndating system was devised in 525, but was not widely used until after 800. \n\nAlternative names for this era include vulgaris aerae (found 1615 in Latin), {{cite book |url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/joannis-keppleri-eclogae-chronicae-ex-\nepistolis-doctissimorum-aliquot-virorum-suis-mutuis-quibus-examinantur-tempora-\nnobilissima-1-herodis-herodiadumque-2-baptismi-ministerii-christi-annorum-non-\nplus-2-14-3-passionis-mortis-et-resurrectionis-dn-n-iesu-christi-anno-aerae-\nnostrae-vulgaris-31-non-ut-vulgo-33-4-belli-iudaici-quo-funerata-fuit-cum-\nierosolymis-templo-synagoga-iudaica-sublatumque-vetus-testamentum-inter-alia-\ncommentarius-in-locum-epiphanii-obscurissimum-de-cyclo-veteri-\niudaeorum/oclc/62188677 |quote=anno aerae nostrae vulgaris |author=Johannes\nKepler |title=Joannis Keppleri Eclogae chronicae: ex epistolis doctissimorum\naliquot virorum & suis mutuis, quibus examinantur tempora nobilissima: 1.\nHerodis Herodiadumque, 2. baptismi & ministerii Christi annorum non plus 2 1/4,\n3. passionis, mortis et resurrectionis Dn.

Nowhere in the book is the abbreviation explained or\nexpanded directly.  the alternative abbreviations for the Common Era, CE\nand BCE, are sometimes used in place of AD and BC, which have historically been\nassociated with Christianity.\n\nThe Gregorian calendar is the most widely used calendar in the world today. For\ndecades, it has been the unofficial global standard, adopted for pragmatic\ninterests of international communication, transportation and commercial\nintegration and recognized by international institutions such as the United\nNations and the Universal Postal Union. \n\nThe term Anno Domini is Medieval Latin, translated as In the year of the\nLord,  and as in the year of our Lord.  \"since AD\nstands for anno Domini, 'in the year of (Our) Lord'.\"  It is sometimes\nspecified more fully as Anno Domini Nostri Iesu (Jesu) Christi (\"In the Year of\nOur Lord Jesus Christ\").\n\nTraditionally, English has copied Latin usage by placing the abbreviation before\nthe year number for AD. This convention comes from grammatical usage. Anno\n500 means \"in the year 500\"; anno domini 500 means \"in the year 500 of Our\nLord\". Just as \"500 in the year\" is not good English syntax, neither is 500 AD;\nwhereas \"AD 500\" preserves syntactic order when translated. Since BC is\nnot derived from Latin it is placed after the year number (for example:\nAD , but 68 BC). However, placing the AD after the year number (as in\n\" AD\") is also becoming common usage. The abbreviation is also widely used\nafter the number of a century or millennium, as in \"fourth century AD\" or\n\"second millennium AD\" (although conservative usage formerly rejected such\nexpressions). Chicago Manual of Style, 1993, p. 304.  Because BC is\nthe English abbreviation for Before Christ, it is sometimes incorrectly\nconcluded that AD means After Death, i.e., after the death of Jesus. However\nthis would mean that the ~33 years commonly associated with the life of Jesus\nwould not be present in either BC or AD time scales. Donald P. Ryan, (2000),\n15. \n\nSome archaeologists use the lowercase letters 'bc' and 'ad' and bp as\nterminology for uncalibrated radiocarbon dates for these eras. cathedral, Austria]]\n","linknr":635,"url":"Before_Christ","recorded":1362477602,"links":72,"instances":["eusebius","astronomy","reference_date","writer","christianity"],"pdf":["http://catdir.loc.gov/catdir/samples/cam032/99027383.pdf"],"categories":["6th-century Christianity","Calendar eras","Christian terms","Christianity-related controversies","Chronology","Latin religious phrases","Religion timelines","Time"],"headings":["History","Historical birth date of Jesus","Other eras","Common Era","No year zero","Proposed reforms","See also","Notes and references","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Scriptorium.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Austria_Klagenfurt_Dome_12.jpg/220px-Austria_Klagenfurt_Dome_12.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d0/Charlemagne_Agostino_Cornacchini_Vatican_2.jpg/220px-Charlemagne_Agostino_Cornacchini_Vatican_2.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg/16px-Portal-puzzle.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["epoch","reference_date"],["incarnation","christianity"],["conjunction","astronomy"],["chronicon","eusebius"],["hippolytus","writer"]],"members":["chronicon","conjunction","epoch","hippolytus","incarnation"],"related":["Before_Christ","Computus","Julian_calendar","Gregorian_calendar","Calendar_era","Annunciation","Nativity_of_Jesus","Jesus_of_Nazareth","Epoch_(reference_date)","Year_zero","Johannes_Kepler","Common_Era","Common_Era","United_Nations","Universal_Postal_Union","Medieval_Latin","English_language","Latin","Century","Millennium","Archaeologist","Before_Present","Radiocarbon_dating","Austria","Dionysius_Exiguus","Dionysius_Exiguus'_Easter_table","Era_of_Martyrs","Julian_calendar","Consul","Flavius_Anicius_Probus_Iunior","Nativity_of_Jesus","Incarnation_(Christianity)","Bede","Old_Testament","Great_Year","Precession_of_the_equinoxes","Astrological_age","Anglo-Saxons","Latin","Year_zero","Computus","Agostino_Cornacchini","St._Peter's_Basilica","Carolingian_Empire","Europe","Carolingian_Renaissance","Alcuin","Charlemagne","List_of_Frankish_Kings","Carolingian_Empire","Catholic_Encyclopedia","Pope","Regnal_years","Roman_Catholic","Portugal","Western_Europe","Spanish_era","Eastern_Orthodox","Byzantine_calendar","Russia","Werner_Rolevinck","Genesis_creation_narrative","Jesus","Greek_language","Recto","Pope_Sixtus_IV","Verso","Jesuit","Theologian","Denis_Pétau","Christmas","Annunciation","Easter","Ab_urbe_condita","1_BC","Arles","Pisa","Bede","Fleury_Abbey","Florence","Philip_II_of_France","Herod_the_Great","Chronology_of_Jesus","Massacre_of_the_Innocents","Passover","Biblical_Magi","Conjunction_(astronomy)","Comet_Halley","Gospel_of_Luke","Quirinius","Syria","Census_of_Quirinius","Josephus","List_of_Roman_consuls","Regnal_year","Anno_Mundi","Anicius_Faustus_Albinus_Basilius","Justinian_I","Constans_II","Leo_VI_the_Wise","Alexandria","Annianus_of_Alexandria","Byzantine_Empire","Ethiopia","Ethiopian_calendar","Maximus_the_Confessor","George_Syncellus","Theophanes_the_Confessor","Genesis_creation_narrative","Byzantine_calendar","Eusebius_of_Caesarea","Chronicon_(Eusebius)","Abraham","Era_of_the_Caesars","Spanish_Era","Portugal","Era_of_Martyrs","Diocletian","Persecution_of_Christians","Coptic_Orthodox_Church_of_Alexandria","Coptic_Christianity","Ethiopian_Orthodox_Tewahedo_Church","Crucifixion","Hippolytus_(writer)","Tertullian","Jesus_Christ","Interfaith_dialog","Republic_of_China","Minguo_Era","People's_Republic_of_China","Chinese_calendar","Julian_calendar","Gregorian_calendar","Astronomical_year_numbering","ISO_8601","Astronomical_year_numbering","Calendar_reform","Gregorian_calendar","Human_Era","International_Fixed_Calendar","World_Calendar","World_Season_Calendar","Leap_week_calendar","Pax_Calendar","Common-Civil-Calendar-and-Time","Symmetry454","Calendar","Bede"]}
