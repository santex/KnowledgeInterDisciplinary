This facilitates the characterization of a cell type,\ntheir identification, and eventually their isolation. Cell sorting techniques\nare based on cellular biomarkers (for example, Fluorescent-activated cell\nsorting). A biomarker can be used to identify a cell population, make a\ndiagnostic, measure the progress of disease or the effects of\ntreatment.
