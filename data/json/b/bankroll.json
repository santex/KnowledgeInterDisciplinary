In the United States, empty rolls are\navailable free at most banks in every denomination (though it is becoming\nincreasingly difficult for half dollar and dollar to be readily made available).\nThe rolls come flat and one side will have to be folded to allow for coins to be\nplaced inside. When the roll is full, the top side will need to be folded.\nTypically, the full rolls are brought back to the banks in exchange for currency\nor to be deposited.\n\nIn the Eurozone, you also find empty plastic rolls at the banks in every\ndenomination, with five-coin staggered rows. Their main advantages are:\n;Reliability: Their five-coin staggered rows and transparency make quick\nverification of contents possible. ;Certainty: They provide a high degree of\ncertainty (transparency, reliable and legible contents). ;Cost effective : The\nhigh certainty means less time spent processing coins, while the solidity and\ntwo-way closure system increase the number of times the coin roll can be used,\neffectively reducing its overall cost.\n",
