{"cursor":"5200","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nThe 'Baptist Union of New Zealand' is an association of Baptist churches in the\ncountry of New Zealand.\n\nSeveral Baptists settled in New Zealand in the 1840s, but the first Baptist\nminister, Decimus Dolamore from Yorkshire, England, did not arrive until May\n1851. Dolamore settled in Nelson and was involved in the formation of the first\nBaptist Church in New Zealand - Nelson Baptist Church - that same year. He was\ninstrumental in obtaining a change in the law to allow Baptist ministers to\nperform marriage ceremonies. Until 1854, only Catholic and Anglican priests were\nallowed to do so. Dolamore later went to Christchurch and was the first minister\nfor that congregation.\n\nThe Canterbury Baptist Association was formed in 1874. This association started\nthe New Zealand Baptist magazine, which has been published monthly since\nJanuary 1881. The 'Baptist Union of New Zealand' was formed at Wellington in\nOctober 1882. At the time the Union was formed, there were 22 Baptist churches,\nwith 1,890 members. The New Zealand Baptist Missionary Society was formed at\nthe 1885 conference of the Baptist Union. At the 1891 conference, the Union\nestablished a plan to divide the country into four districts -\n\"Otago/Southland\" (org. 1892), \"Auckland\" (org. 1892), \"Canterbury & Westland\"\n(org. 1892), and \"Central\" (org. 1896). Central District was later divided into\nthe Central District Association and the \"Wellington\" Association, and \"South\nAuckland\" was formed in 1939. South Auckland was later divided into the\n\"Waikato\" Association and the \"Bay of Plenty\" Association (now Bay of Plenty &\nEastland). The \"Top of the South\" Association was formed in 1990. Some groups\nwere called \"auxiliary\" and some \"association\", but in 1957, the term\n\"auxiliary\" was dropped in favor of the term \"association\". There are currently\n9 associations. The Baptist National Centre is the registered office of the\nBaptist Union of New Zealand, the New Zealand Baptist Missionary Society and\nBaptist Care Limited, and is located in Penrose.\n\nAccording to Union statements, they believe \"the true humanity and Deity of the\nLord Jesus Christ; the atonement made on the cross by our Lord for the sin of\nthe world; the person of the Holy Spirit as the one who sets apart, empowers,\nand imparts spiritual gifts to the church; the inspiration of the Bible and its\nauthority in all matters of faith and practice; salvation and membership in the\nChurch by faith in Christ alone; membership of the church for the regenerate;\n[and] the immersion of believers as the scriptural form of water baptism.\"\n\nTheologically, the Baptist Union member churches are deeply influenced by the\ncharismatic renewal movement even though there is no official position regarding\nthe charismatic movement. A study in 1989 indicates 69% of churches belonging to\nthe Baptist Union identified with the charismatic movement. A smaller\nportion of member churches are Reformed in doctrine.\n\nThe Union supports education through [[Carey Baptist College]] in Penrose, and\nTe Whare Amorangi, designed for Maori men and women, in Papatoetoe.\n\nIn 2006, Baptist Union membership included 23,118 baptized believers in 244\nchurches and fellowships.\n\nThe Oxford Terrace Baptist Church in Christchurch Central City was damaged in\nthe 2010 Canterbury earthquake and collapsed in the subsequent February 2011\nChristchurch earthquake.\n","linknr":151,"url":"Baptist_Union_of_New_Zealand","recorded":1375059293,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Baptist_Union_of_New_Zealand&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Baptist_Union_of_New_Zealand&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Category:Baptist","/wiki/Baptists","/wiki/File:Baptism_logo.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/3a/Baptism_logo.jpg/100px-Baptism_logo.jpg","/wiki/Christianity","/wiki/Protestantism","/wiki/Puritan","/wiki/Anabaptist","/wiki/Baptist_beliefs","/wiki/Priesthood_of_all_believers","/wiki/Soul_competency","/wiki/Baptists_in_the_history_of_separation_of_church_and_state","/wiki/Sola_scriptura","/wiki/Congregationalist_polity","/wiki/Baptist_ordinance","/wiki/Baptist_offices","/wiki/List_of_Baptist_confessions","/wiki/List_of_Baptists","/wiki/John_Smyth_(Baptist_minister)","/wiki/Thomas_Helwys","/wiki/Roger_Williams_(theologian)","/wiki/John_Clarke_(Baptist_minister)","/wiki/John_Bunyan","/wiki/Shubal_Stearns","/wiki/Andrew_Fuller","/wiki/Charles_Spurgeon","/wiki/D._N._Jackson","/wiki/James_Robinson_Graves","/wiki/William_Bullein_Johnson","/wiki/William_Carey_(missionary)","/wiki/Luther_Rice","/wiki/Martin_Luther_King,_Jr.","/wiki/Billy_Graham","/wiki/List_of_Baptist_denominations","/wiki/List_of_Baptist_colleges_and_universities","/wiki/Portal:Baptist","/wiki/Template:Baptist","/wiki/Template_talk:Baptist","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Baptist&action=edit","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:INCITE","/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Fact_and_Reference_Check","/wiki/Wikipedia:When_to_cite","/wiki/Baptist","/wiki/New_Zealand","/wiki/Yorkshire,_England","/wiki/Catholic","/wiki/Anglican","/wiki/Christchurch","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Canterbury_Region","/wiki/West_Coast_Region","/wiki/Wellington_Region","/wiki/Waikato","/wiki/Penrose,_New_Zealand","/wiki/Charismatic_renewal","/wiki/Charismatic_movement","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Calvinism","/wiki/Carey_Baptist_College","/wiki/Penrose,_New_Zealand","/wiki/Papatoetoe","/wiki/Oxford_Terrace_Baptist_Church","/wiki/Christchurch_Central_City","/wiki/2010_Canterbury_earthquake","/wiki/February_2011_Christchurch_earthquake","#cite_note-September_heritage_loss-3","/w/index.php?title=Baptist_Union_of_New_Zealand&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Charles_Haddon_Spurgeon","/w/index.php?title=Baptist_Union_of_New_Zealand&action=edit&section=2","http://www.baptist.org.nz","/w/index.php?title=Baptist_Union_of_New_Zealand&action=edit&section=3","#cite_ref-1","http://www.otbc.org.nz/about/","#cite_ref-2","http://baptistlife.org.nz/documents/0000/0000/0013/PJBR_3-2_Oct_07_Tucker_on_Tour.pdf","#cite_ref-September_heritage_loss_3-0","http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/4096832/Quake-devastates-Christchurchs-heritage","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Baptist_Union_of_New_Zealand&oldid=505946207","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Christianity_in_New_Zealand","/wiki/Category:Religious_organizations_established_in_1882","/wiki/Category:Baptist_denominations_in_Oceania","/wiki/Category:Articles_lacking_in-text_citations_from_May_2010","/wiki/Category:All_articles_lacking_in-text_citations","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Baptist+Union+of+New+Zealand&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Baptist+Union+of+New+Zealand","/wiki/Baptist_Union_of_New_Zealand","/wiki/Talk:Baptist_Union_of_New_Zealand","#","/wiki/Baptist_Union_of_New_Zealand","/w/index.php?title=Baptist_Union_of_New_Zealand&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Baptist_Union_of_New_Zealand&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipe
