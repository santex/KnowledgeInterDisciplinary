{"cursor":"1870","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The 'Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller Model' [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/arti-\ncles/PMC1207686/pdf/ge14441331.pdf Dobzhansky, Bateson, and the genetics of\nspeciation.] is a model of the evolution of genetic incompatibility. The\ntheory was first described by William Bateson in 1909, then\nindependently described by Theodosius Dobzhansky in 1934, and later\nelaborated by Herman Muller.\n\nThe model attempts to explain how incompatibilities between closely related\nspecies develop without either of them going through an adaptive valley. In\nits simplest form the model shows that changes in at least two loci are\nrequired to cause hybrid incompatibility, or at least a decrease in fitness\nbetween individuals from two ancestrally identical, but allopatric\npopulations. This is based on the idea that a new allele which has arisen at\none locus in one population should not cause decreased fitness when placed\ninto the identical (except for one allele) genetic background of the second\npopulation. Therefore another allele at a second locus which is incompatible\nwith the first must have arisen.\n","linknr":88,"url":"Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller_Model","recorded":1362483386,"links":14,"instances":["genetics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Evolutionary biology"],"headings":["See also","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["locus","genetics"]],"members":["locus"],"related":["William_Bateson","Theodosius_Dobzhansky","Hermann_Joseph_Muller","Fitness_landscape","Locus_(genetics)","Allopatry","Allele","Speciation"]}
