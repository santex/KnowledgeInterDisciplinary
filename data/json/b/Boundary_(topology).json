{"cursor":"6387","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":":For a different notion of boundary related to [[manifold]]s, see that article.\n\nIn topology and mathematics in general, the 'boundary' of a subset S of a\ntopological space X is the set of points which can be approached both from S and\nfrom the outside of S. More precisely, it is the set of points in the closure of\nS, not belonging to the interior of S. An element of the boundary of S is called\na 'boundary point' of S. Notations used for boundary of a set S include bd(S),\nfr(S), and âS. Some authors (for example Willard, in General Topology) use the\nterm 'frontier', instead of boundary in an attempt to avoid confusion with the\nconcept of boundary used in algebraic topology and manifold theory.\n\nA connected component of the boundary of S is called a 'boundary\ncomponent' of S.\n","linknr":146,"url":"Boundary_(topology)","recorded":1362476901,"links":32,"instances":["topology","topology","topology","topology","set_theory"],"pdf":[],"categories":["General topology"],"headings":["Common definitions","Examples","Properties","Boundary of a boundary","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e1/Runge_theorem.svg/220px-Runge_theorem.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/33/Mandelbrot_set_Components.jpg/220px-Mandelbrot_set_Components.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/6/a/f6a9f4d938cbc5cf7941fc3550cc6fde.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/85/AccumulationAndBoundaryPointsOfS.PNG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["closure","topology"],["interior","topology"],["complement","set_theory"],["neighborhood","topology"],["basis","topology"]],"members":["interior","basis","closure","neighborhood","complement"],"related":["Topology","Mathematics","Topological_space","Closure_(topology)","Interior_(topology)","Algebraic_topology","Manifold_theory","Complement_(set_theory)","Neighborhood_(topology)","Basis_(topology)","Open_interval","Dense_set","Subspace_topology","Topology","Closed_set","Open_set","Clopen_set","Idempotence","Manifold","Simplex","Simplicial_complex","Singular_homology","Topological_manifold","Lebesgue's_density_theorem","Bounding_point"]}
