{"cursor":"16613","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Legal personality' (also 'artificial personality', 'juridical personality',\n'legal entity' and 'juristic personality') is the characteristic of a non-living\nentity regarded by law to have the status of personhood.\n\nA 'legal person' () (also 'artificial person', 'juridical person', 'juristic\nperson', 'legal entity' and 'body corporate', also commonly called a 'vehicle')\nhas a legal name and has certain rights, protections, privileges,\nresponsibilities, and liabilities under law, similar to those of a natural\nperson. The concept of a legal person is a fundamental legal fiction. It is\npertinent to the philosophy of law, as it is essential to laws affecting a\ncorporation (corporations law) (the law of business associations).\n\nLegal personality allows one or more natural persons to act as a single entity\n(a composite person) for legal purposes. In many jurisdictions, legal\npersonality allows that composite to be considered under law separately from its\nindividual members or shareholders. They may sue and be sued, enter contracts,\nincur debt, and own property. Entities with legal personality may also be\nsubjected to certain legal obligations, such as the payment of taxes. An entity\nwith legal personality may shield its shareholders from personal liability.\n\nThe concept of legal personality is not absolute. \"Piercing the corporate veil\"\nrefers to looking at the individual natural persons acting as agents involved in\na corporate action or decision; this may result in a legal decision in which the\nrights or duties of a corporation are treated as the rights or liabilities of\nthat corporation's shareholders or directors. Generally, legal persons do not\nhave all of the same rights—such as the right to freedom of\nspeech—that natural persons have, although the Republic of Iran has become\nan exception in this regard.\n\nThe concept of a legal person is now central to Western law in both common-law\nand civil-law countries, but it is also found in virtually every legal\nsystem.
