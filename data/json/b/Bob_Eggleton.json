Eggleton has been honored with the Hugo Award for Best\nProfessional Artist eight times, first winning in 1994. He also won the Hugo\nAward for Best Related Book in 2001 for his art book \"Greetings From Earth\". He\nhas also won the Chesley Award for Artistic Achievement in 1999 and was the\nguest of honor at Chicon 2000.\n\nEggleton's drawing and paintings cover a wide range of science fiction, fantasy,\nand horror topics, depicting space ships, alien worlds and inhabitants, dragons,\nvampires, and other fantasy creatures. His view on space ships were that they\nshould look organic, and claimed that as a child, he was disappointed with the\nspace shuttles and rockets NASA produced; they were nothing like fantasy artists\nof the twenties and thirties had promised. His fascination with dragons\noriginated with his childhood interest of dinosaurs, which can be seen in the\nbook Greetings From Earth. His paintings are commissioned and bought at science\nfiction conventions, and used as book covers.\n\nEggleton has illustrated cards for the [[Magic: The Gathering]] collectible\ncard game.\n\nEggleton received massive encouragement from his father, in the form of books,\nsupplies, visits to museums of space and aeronautics and support during the\ncareer choices he made. Eggleton dropped out of his art college, because he felt\nit was not for him.\n\nEggleton is a fan of Godzilla and worked as a creative consultant on the\nAmerican remake. While in Japan he appeared as an extra in one of the more\nrecent films.\n\nAsteroid 13562 was named Bobeggleton in his honor.\n","linknr":120,"url":"Bob_Eggleton","recorded":1375088750,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Bob_Eggleton&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Bob_Eggleton&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Bob_Eggleton.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/19/Bob_Eggleton.jpg/150px-Bob_Eggleton.jpg","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/Science_fiction","/wiki/Fantasy","/wiki/Painting","/wiki/Science_fiction","/wiki/Fantasy","/wiki/Horror_fiction","/wiki/Artist","/wiki/Hugo_Award_for_Best_Professional_Artist","/wiki/Hugo_Award_for_Best_Related_Book","/wiki/Chesley_Award","/wiki/58th_World_Science_Fiction_Convention","#cite_note-proj960929-1","/wiki/Magic:_The_Gathering","/wiki/Godzilla","/wiki/Godzilla_(1998_film)","/wiki/Japan","#cite_note-loc041120-2","/wiki/13562_Bobeggleton","#cite_note-3","/w/index.php?title=Bob_Eggleton&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Bob_Eggleton&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-proj960929_1-0","http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/projo/access/31854740.html?dids=31854740:31854740&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT","/wiki/Providence_Journal","/wiki/Providence,_RI","#cite_ref-loc041120_2-0","http://www.locusmag.com/2004/Reviews/11_Eggleton_Godzilla.html","/wiki/Locus_(magazine)","#cite_ref-3","http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb.cgi?sstr=13562%20Bobeggleton","/w/index.php?title=Bob_Eggleton&action=edit&section=3","http://www.bobeggleton.com/","http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/ea.cgi?Bob_Eggleton","/wiki/Internet_Speculative_Fiction_Database","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/91657997","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bob_Eggleton&oldid=541707459","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1960_births","/wiki/Category:Living_people","/wiki/Category:Science_fiction_artists","/wiki/Category:Fantasy_artists","/wiki/Category:Hugo_Award_winning_artists","/wiki/Category:Worldcon_Guests_of_Honor","/wiki/Category:Horror_artists","/wiki/Category:Magic:_The_Gathering_artists","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Bob+Eggleton&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Bob+Eggleton","/wiki/Bob_Eggleton","/wiki/Talk:Bob_Eggleton","#","/wiki/Bob_Eggleton","/w/index.php?title=Bob_Eggleton&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Bob_Eggleton&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Bob_Eggleton","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Bob_Eggleton","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Bob_Eggleton&oldid=541707459","/w/index.php?title=Bob_Eggleton&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q750545","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Bob_Eggleton&id=541707459","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Bob+Eggleton","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Bob+Eggleton&oldid=541707459&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Bob_Eggleton&printable=yes","//fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Eggleton","//hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Eggleton","//pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Eggleton","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q750545#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Eggle
