{"cursor":"6594","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nA 'biotransducer' converts the biochemical signal to an electronic signal. It\ngives the biosensor selectivity and specificity. Typically biotransducers\nconsist of two main parts; a bio-recognition layer and a physico-transducer. The\nbio-recognition layer typically contain an enzyme or another binding protein\nsuch as antibody. By using oligonucleotide sequences, sub-cellular fragments\nsuch as organelles (e.g. mitochondria) and receptor carrying fragments (e.g.\ncell wall), single whole cells, small numbers of cells on synthetic scaffolds,\nor thin slices of animal or plant tissues, the bio-recognition layer can also be\ncreated. A physico-transducer typically contacts with the recognition layer. A\nphysic-chemical change that produced by the recognition layer due to the\nanalyte, is measured by the\ntransducer. http://www.clemson.edu/c3b/biosensorsPrimer.html\n\nBio transducers vary from electrochemical, optical, piezoelectric and FET based.\nBased on the type of biotransducer, biosensors can be classified as shown below.\n","linknr":131,"url":"Biotransducer","recorded":1362509953,"links":13,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Biotechnology","Molecular biology"],"headings":["Electrochemical biotransducers","Optical biotransducers","FET-based electronic biotransducers","Piezoelectric biotransducers","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/39/Biotransducer.jpg/220px-Biotransducer.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/7f/Biosensors_based_on_type_of_biotransducers.png/220px-Biosensors_based_on_type_of_biotransducers.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Biosensor","Enzyme","Antibody","Oligonucleotide","Mitochondria","Cell_wall","Piezoelectric","Piezen","Biosensor","DNA_field-effect_transistor","Biointerface","Electrochemiluminescence","Bioelectronics","Nanobiotechnology"]}
