It\nis usually made from a combination of two or more types of glass, one hard and\none soft. The softer layer makes the glass more elastic, so it can flex instead\nof shatter. The index of refraction for both of the glasses used in the\nbulletproof layers must be almost the same to keep the glass transparent and\nallow a clear, non-distorted view through the glass. Bulletproof glass varies\nin thickness from three-quarter inch to three inches (19mm to\n76mm). Bertino, AJ, Bertino PN, Forensic Science: Fundamentals and\nInvestigations, Cengage Learning, 2008, p. 407\n\nAnother construction method, which is becoming popular rapidly, is the use of\nsecurity laminates as a film on the inner surface of ordinary glass. This, when\nbonded with the application of a pressure sensitive adhesive and cured fully,\nalso provides a protection similar to the multi-layered bullet-resistant glass.\nThe optical clarity is much better and tint-free, thickness and weight are\nreduced as much as 50â70%, and the process can be done as a retrofit on\nexisting windows.\n","linknr":157,"url":"Bulletproof_glass","recorded":1362481700,"links":36,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.marsarmor.com/Technical%20Info/EN1063.pdf","http://www.armorcore.com/docs/UL_752_Specification.pdf","https://aais.ria.army.mil/AAIS/award_web_09/W52H0909A00030000/Award_attach/Attach1.pdf","http://www.justnet.org/Lists/JUSTNET%20Resources/Attachments/1281/0108.01.pdf"],"categories":["Glass coating and surface modification","Armour"],"headings":["Construction","Test standards","Environmental effects","Recent advances","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/Bulletproof_glass_window_after_a_burglary_attempt.jpg/165px-Bulletproof_glass_window_after_a_burglary_attempt.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/IDET2007_bulletproof_glass_armor.jpg/220px-IDET2007_bulletproof_glass_armor.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/5d/Rough_visualisation_of_bulletproof_glass.jpg/200px-Rough_visualisation_of_bulletproof_glass.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Index_of_refraction","Polycarbonate","Thermoplastic","Laminated_glass","Ultraviolet","Spall","Spinel","Transparent_Armor_Gun_Shield","Prince_Rupert's_Drop"]}
