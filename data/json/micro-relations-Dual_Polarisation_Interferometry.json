{"cursor":"7036","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Dual polarization interferometry' ('DPI') is an analytical technique that can\nprobe molecular scale layers adsorbed to the surface of a waveguide by using the\nevanescent wave of a laser beam confined to the waveguide. It is typically used\nto measure the conformational change in proteins, or other biomolecules, as they\nfunction (referred to as the conformation activity relationship).\n\nDPI {{cite journal |last1=Cross |first1=G |last2=Reeves |first2=AA\n|last3=Brand |first3=S |last4=Popplewell |first4=JF |last5=Peel |first5=LL\n|last6=Swann |first6=MJ |last7=Freeman |first7=NJ |year=2003 |title=A new\nquantitative optical biosensor for protein characterisation |journal=Biosensors\nand Bioelectronics |volume=19 |issue=4 |page=383 |pmid=14615097 |doi=10.1016/S0956-5663(03)00203-\n3 }} focuses laser light into two waveguides. One of these functions as\nthe \"sensing\" waveguide having an exposed surface while the second one functions\nto maintain a reference beam. A two-dimensional interference pattern is formed\nin the far field by combining the light passing through the two waveguides. The\nDPI technique rotates the polarization of the laser, to alternately excite two\npolarization modes of the waveguides. Measurement of the interferogram for both\npolarizations allows both the refractive index and the thickness of the adsorbed\nlayer to be calculated. The polarization can be switched rapidly, allowing real-\ntime measurements of chemical reactions taking place on a chip surface in a flow-\nthrough system. These measurements can be used to infer conformational\ninformation about the molecular interactions taking place, as the molecule size\n(from the layer thickness) and the fold density (from the RI) change. DPI is\ntypically used to characterise biochemical interactions by quantifying any\nconformational change at the same time as measuring reaction rates, affinities\nand thermodynamics.\n\nThe technique is quantitative and real-time (10 Hz) with a dimensional\nresolution of 0.01 nm. {{cite book |last=Swann |first=MJ\n|last2=Freeman |first2=NJ |last3=Cross |first3=GH |year=2007 |chapter=Dual\nPolarization Interferometry: A Real-Time Optical Technique for Measuring\n(Bio)Molecular Orientation, Structure and Function at the Solid/Liquid Interface\n|editor=Marks, R.S; Lowe, C.R.; Cullen, D.C.; Weetall, H.H.; Karube, I.\n|title=Handbook of Biosensors and Biochips |volume=Vol. 1 |issue=\n|at=Pt. 4, Ch. 33, pp. 549â568 |publisher=Wiley |isbn=978-0-470-01905-\n4 }}\n\nA novel application for Dual Polarization Interferometry emerged in 2008, where\nthe intensity of light passing through the waveguide is extinguished in the\npresence of crystal growth. This has allowed the very earliest stages in protein\ncrystal nucleation to be monitored. {{cite journal |last1=Boudjemline\n|first1=A |last2=Clarke |first2=DT |last3=Freeman |first3=NJ |last4=Nicholson\n|first4=JM |last5=Jones |first5=GR |year=2008 |title=Early stages of protein\ncrystallization as revealed by emerging optical waveguide technology\n|journal=Journal of Applied Crystallography |volume=41 |page=523\n|doi=10.1107/S0021889808005098 }} Later versions of Dual Polarization\nInterferometers also have the capability to quantify the order and disruption in\nbirefringent thin films. {{cite journal |last1=Mashaghi |first1=A\n|last2=Swann |first2=M |last3=Popplewell |first3=J |last4=Textor |first4=M\n|last5=Reimhult |first5=E |year=2008 |title=Optical Anisotropy of Supported\nLipid Structures Probed by Waveguide Spectroscopy and Its Application to Study\nof Supported Lipid Bilayer Formation Kinetics |journal=Analytical Chemistry\n|volume=80 |issue=10 |page=3666 |doi=10.1021/ac800027s |pmid=18422336 }}\nThis has been used, for example, to study the formation of lipid bilayers and\ntheir interaction with membrane proteins. {{cite journal |last1=Sanghera\n|first1=N |last2=Swann |first2=MJ |last3=Ronan |first3=G |last4=Pinheiro\n|first4=TJ |year=2009 |title=Insight into early events in the aggregation of the\nprion protein on lipid membranes |journal=Biochimica et Biophysica Acta\n|volume=1788 |issue=10 |pages=2245â51 |doi=10.1016/j.bbamem.2009.08.005\n|pmid=19703409 }} {{cite journal |last1=Lee |first1=TH |last2=Heng\n|first2=C |last3=Swann |first3=MJ |last4=Gehman |first4=JD |last5=Separovic\n|first5=F |last6=Aguilar |first6=MI |year=2010 |title=Real-time quantitative\nanalysis of lipid disordering by aurein 1.2 during membrane adsorption,\ndestabilisation and lysis |journal=Biochimica et Biophysica Acta |volume=1798\n|issue=10 |pages=1977â86 |doi=10.1016/j.bbamem.2010.06.023 |pmid=20599687\n}} In December 2011, the interferometer system was announced as a\ndiscontinued product line although existing users were to be supported until\nDecember 2016.
