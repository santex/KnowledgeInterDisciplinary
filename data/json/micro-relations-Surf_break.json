The topography of the seabed\n | determines the shape of the wave and type of break. Since shoals can change\n | size and location, affecting the break, it takes commitment and skill to find\n | good breaks. Some surf breaks are quite dangerous, since the surfer can\n | collide with a reef or rocks below the water. Surf breaks are often defended\n | vehemently by surfers. In 2008, surfers and environmentalists opposed a toll\n | road project in Orange County, California that would have changed sediment\n | patterns and affected the world-class Trestles surf break north of San Onofre\n | State Beach which attracted 400,000 surfers in 2007. {{cite\n | news last = Flaccus first = Gillian title = Officials Pick Surf Break Over\n | Toll Road - Local News url =\n | http://www.foxnews.com/wires/2008Feb07/0,4670,TollRoadTussle,00.html\n | accessdate = 2009-04-02 date = 2008-02-07 publisher = Fox News quote =\n | Surfers and environmentalists threw a roadblock in front of a proposed toll\n | road through one of the world's best surf breaks}}\n\nIn 2007, the NSW Geographical Names Register began formally recognizing names of\nsurf breaks in Australia, defining a surf break as a \"permanent obstruction such\nas a reef, headland, bombora, rock or sandbar, which causes waves to break\". {{cite news\n | last = Silmalis first = Linda title = Surf break names recognised url = http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,21520183-\n | 5006007,00.html accessdate = 2009-04-02 publisher = The Daily Telegraph date\n | = 2007-04-08 quote = THE tradition within the surfing community of naming the\n | local break is set to be recognised with the NSW Government to create a\n | formal register}}\n\nOne of the largest surf breaks in the world is the Jaws surf break in Maui,\nHawaii, with waves that reach a maximum height of . {{cite news\n | last = Hurley first = Timothy title = Maui's monster surf break getting\n | bigger by the day url =\n | http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2002/Nov/18/ln/ln04a.html\n | accessdate = 2009-04-02 date = 2002-11-18 quote = Jaws â or Pe'ahi, as many\n | locals call it â offers some of the largest surfable waves on earth.
