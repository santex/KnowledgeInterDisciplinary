In addition, the planet itself is an\n ellipsoid, flatter at the poles than the equator. Picture by ESO]] In\n mathematics, an 'ellipse' (from Greek ἔλλειψις elleipsis, a \"falling short\") is\n a plane curve that results from the intersection of a cone by a plane in a way\n that produces a closed curve. Circles are special cases of ellipses, obtained\n when the cutting plane is orthogonal to the cone's axis. Analytically, an\n ellipse is defined as the set of points such that the distance of each point\n from a given point (called a focus) bears a constant ratio (called the\n eccentricity) of less than 1 to its distance from a given straight line (the\n directrix). An ellipse is also the locus of all points in the plane whose\n distances to two fixed points (the foci) add to the same constant. The name\n ἔλλειψις was given by Apollonius of Perga in his Conics, emphasizing the\n connection of the curve with \"application of areas\".\n\nEllipses are closed curves and are the bounded case of the conic sections, the\ncurves that result from the intersection of a circular cone and a plane that\ndoes not pass through its apex; the other two (open and unbounded) cases are\nparabolas and hyperbolas. Ellipses arise from the intersection of a right\ncircular cylinder with a plane that is not parallel to the cylinder's main axis\nof symmetry. Ellipses also arise as images of a circle under parallel projection\nand the bounded cases of perspective projection, which are simply intersections\nof the projective cone with the plane of projection. It is also the simplest\nLissajous figure, formed when the horizontal and vertical motions are sinusoids\nwith the same frequency.\n","title":"Ellipse","headings":["Elements of an ellipse","Drawing ellipses","Mathematical definitions and properties","Ellipses in physics","Ellipses in statistics and finance","Ellipses in computer graphics","Line segment as a type of degenerate ellipse","Ellipses in optimization theory","See also","References","Notes","External links"]},"micro-relation":["4: Ellipsoid","4: Parabola","4: Hyperbola","3: Conic_section","2: Apollonius_of_Perga","2: Dandelin_spheres","2: Approximation","2: Perpendicular","2: Parametric_equation","2: Kepler's_laws_of_planetary_motion","2: Elliptical_distribution","1: European_Southern_Observatory","1: Mathematics","1: Greek_language","1: Plane_curve","1: Circle","1: Analytical_geometry","1: Distance","1: Ratio","1: Straight_line","1: Closed_curve","1: Bounded_set","1: Open_curve","1: Unbounded_set","1: Parallel_projection","1: Perspective_projection","1: Lissajous_figure","1: Sine_wave","1: Symmetry","1: Antipodal_point","1: The_Mathematical_Association_of_America","1: Limit_of_a_function","1: Drawing_pin","1: Triangle","1: Ruler","1: Set_square","1: Trammel_of_Archimedes","1: Parallelogram_method","1: Euclidean_geometry","1: Flattening","1: Conic_section#Eccentricity_in_terms_of_parameters_of_the_quadratic_form","1: Quadratic_form","1: Hypotrochoid","1: Jacobian_matrix_and_determinant","1: Circumference","1: Elliptic_integral#Complete_elliptic_integral_of_the_second_kind","1: Carlson_symmetric_form","1: Infinite_series","1: Double_factorial","1: Srinivasa_Ramanujan","1: Arc_length","1: Elliptic_integral","1: Inverse_function","1: Elliptic_functions","1: Latus_rectum","1: Projective_geometry","1: Projective_map","1: Projective_duality","1: Oblique_projection","1: Affine_map","1: Analytic_geometry","1: Cartesian_plane","1: Implicit_and_explicit_functions","1: Canonical_form","1: Unit_circle","1: Tangential_angle","1: Meridional","1: Latitude","1: Polar_coordinates","1: Gauss_map","1: Angular_eccentricity","1: Hausdorff_metric","1: Mirror","1: Prolate_spheroid","1: Fluorescent_lamp","1: Image_scanner","1: Cupola","1: National_Statuary_Hall","1: United_States_Capitol","1: John_Quincy_Adams","1: Mormon_Tabernacle","1: Temple_Square","1: Salt_Lake_City","1: Utah","1: Chicago","1: University_of_Illinois_at_Urbana-Champaign","1: Alhambra","1: Johannes_Kepler","1: Isaac_Newton","1: Newton's_law_of_universal_gravitation","1: Two-body_problem","1: Barycenter","1: Electromagnetic_radiation","1: Quantum_mechanics","1: Elliptical_orbit","1: Apoapsis","1: Periapsis","1: Semi-major_axis","1: Arithmetic_mean","1: Geometric_mean","1: Conic_section#Features","1: Harmonic_mean","1: Harmonic_oscillator","1: Dimension","1: Electronics","1: Oscilloscope","1: Non-circular_gear","1: Link_chain","1: Toothed_belt","1: Chainwheel#ovoid_chainwheels","1: Ovoid","1: Angular_speed","1: Torque","1: Mechanical_advantage","1: Bobbin","1: Anisotropic","1: Birefringent","1: Refractive_index","1: Index_ellipsoid","1: Isotropic","1: Laser_pumping","1: Extreme_ultraviolet","1: Extreme_ultraviolet_lithography","1: Statistics","1: Random_vector","1: Multivariate_normal_distribution","1: Finance","1: Graphics_primitive","1: QuickDraw","1: Direct2D","1: Jack_Bresenham","1: Bezier_splines","1: Affine_transformation","1: Bezier_curve","1: Radial_elliptic_trajectory","1: Ellipsoid_method","1: Cartesian_oval","1: Circumconic_and_inconic","1: Elliptic_coordinates","1: Elliptic_partial_differential_equation","1: Great_ellipse","1: Matrix_representation_of_conic_sections","1: N-ellipse","1: Oval","1: Proofs_involving_the_ellipse","1: Spheroid","1: Steiner_circumellipse","1: Steiner_inellipse","1: Superellipse","1: True_anomaly","1: Eccentric_anomaly","1: Mean_anomaly"]}
