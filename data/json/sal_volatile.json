Commercial samples labeled ammonium\ncarbonate no longer contain this compound, but a mixture that has similar\nammonia content. Since it readily degrades to gaseous ammonia and carbon dioxide\nupon heating, it is used as a leavening agent and also as smelling salt. It is\nalso known as 'baker's ammonia' and was a predecessor to the more modern\nleavening agents baking soda and baking powder. It is a component of what was\nformerly known as 'sal volatile' and 'salt of [[hartshorn]]'.<ref name=Ullmann/>\n",
