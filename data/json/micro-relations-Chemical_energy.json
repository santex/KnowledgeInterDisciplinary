Examples include batteries and light bulbs and cells etc. .\nBreaking or making of chemical bonds involves energy, which may be either\nabsorbed or evolved from a chemical system\n\nEnergy that can be released (or absorbed) because of a reaction between a set of\nchemical substances is equal to the difference between the energy content of the\nproducts and the reactants. This change in energy is change in internal energy\nof a chemical reaction. Where \\Delta {U_f^\\circ}_{\\mathrm\n{reactants}} is the internal energy of formation of the reactant\nmolecules that can be calculated from the bond energies of the various chemical\nbonds of the molecules under consideration and \\Delta {U_f^\\circ}_{\\mathrm\n{products}} is the internal energy of formation of the product molecules.\nThe internal energy change of a process is equal to the heat change if it is\nmeasured under conditions of constant volume, as in a closed rigid container\nsuch as a bomb calorimeter. However, under conditions of constant pressure, as\nin reactions in vessels open to the atmosphere, the measured heat change is not\nalways equal to the internal energy change, because pressure-volume work also\nreleases or absorbs energy. (The heat change at constant pressure is called the\nenthalpy change; in this case the enthalpy of formation).\n\nAnother useful term is the heat of combustion, which is the energy released due\nto a combustion reaction and often applied in the study of fuels. Food is\nsimilar to hydrocarbon fuel and carbohydrate fuels, and when it is oxidized, its\ncaloric content is similar (though not assessed in the same way as a hydrocarbon\nfuel â see food energy).\n\nIn chemical thermodynamics the term used for the chemical potential energy is\nchemical potential, and for chemical transformation an equation most often used\nis the Gibbs-Duhem equation.\n\nChemical potential energy is a form of potential energy related to the\nstructural arrangement of atoms or molecules. This arrangement may be the result\nof chemical bonds within a molecule or otherwise. Chemical energy of a chemical\nsubstance can be transformed to other forms of energy by a chemical reaction. As\nan example, when a fuel is burned the chemical energy is converted to heat, same\nis the case with digestion of food metabolized in a biological organism. Green\nplants transform solar energy to chemical energy through the process known as\nphotosynthesis, and electrical energy can be converted to chemical energy\nthrough electrochemical reactions...\n\nThe similar term chemical potential is used to indicate the potential of a\nsubstance to undergo a change of configuration, be it in the form of a chemical\nreaction, spatial transport, particle exchange with a reservoir. it is one of\nthe most important form of energy used for any living organism.\n","linknr":159,"url":"Chemical_energy","recorded":1362583561,"links":33,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Chemical energy","Chemistry"],"headings":[],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/a/0/5a0ce6526219a084063fba7ab7dc95d9.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/0/a/70adc76a51f05c19784fd1ded747da31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Chemistry","Internal_energy","Bond_energy","Calorimeter","Enthalpy","Standard_enthalpy_change_of_formation","Heat_of_combustion","Combustion","Fuels","Food_energy","Chemical_potential","Gibbs-Duhem_equation","Chemical_bond","Chemical_reaction","Solar_energy","Photosynthesis","Electrochemical","Chemical_potential"]}
