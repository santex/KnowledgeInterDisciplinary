{"cursor":"46520","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n and Divine Vengeance Pursuing Crime'', 1808 oil-on-canvas by Pierre-Paul\n Prud'hon]]\n\n\n'Crime' is the breaking of rules or laws for which some governing authority (via\nmechanisms such as legal systems) can ultimately prescribe a conviction. Crimes\nmay also result in cautions, rehabilitation or be unenforced. Individual human\nsocieties may each define crime and crimes differently, in different localities\n(state, local, international), at different time stages of the so-called\n\"crime\", from planning, disclosure, supposedly intended, supposedly prepared,\nincomplete, complete or future proclaimed after the \"crime\".\n\nWhile every crime violates the law, not every violation of the law counts as a\ncrime; for example: breaches of contract and of other civil law may rank as\n\"offences\" or as \"infractions\". Modern societies generally regard crimes as\noffences against the public or the state, as distinguished from [[tort]]s\n(wrongs against private parties that can give rise to a civil cause of action).\n\nCrime in the social and legal framework is the set of facts or assumptions\n(causes, consequences and objectives) that are part of a case in which they were\ncommitted acts punishable under criminal law, and the application of which\ndepends on the agent of a sentence or security measure criminal. Usually\nincludes a felony violation of a criminal rule or act against law, in particular\nat the expense of people or moral. A crime may be illegal (as is the cause of\nevil or injury) or perfectly legal (when the act done is not a necessary\nconsequence of the conduct of the agent but determined by others). Illegal and\npunishable crime is the violation of any rule of administrative, fiscal or\ncriminal liability on the part of agents of the state or practice of any\nwrongdoing and notoriously harmful to self or against third parties, provided\nfor in criminal law, since they practiced with guilt (the first act that causes\ninjury criminal actions or omissions to produce adequate evidence also illegal).\nLegal and not punishable crime are all acts in self-defense or otherwise\ndetermined by the illegal or criminal conduct of others that happened in the\nfirst place (or omission adequate to protect the staff member who is a victim of\nillegal crime).\n","linknr":1117,"url":"Crime","recorded":1362898385,"links":92,"instances":["law","law","law","polity","sociology","penalty","sociology","law","politics","psychology","law","private_law","mythology","consolidation_act_1992","legal_philosophy","penology","sociology","jurist","legal","political_science"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Crime|","Criminal
