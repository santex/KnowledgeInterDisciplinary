He was the son of an Australian father and a native PNG mother.\nThough his career was turbulent and often marked by setbacks, he served in the\nhighest posts in his country: Prime Minister, Speaker of the National\nParliament, and acting Governor-General.\n\nSkate became manager of the capital district commission in 1987. He was elected\nto Parliament in 1992 and served as Speaker from 1992 to 1994, supporting the\ngovernment of Paias Wingti.\n\nSkate served as governor of the National Capital District from 1995 to 1997. He\nwas Prime Minister from 1997 to 1999 and resigned after 18 months, fearing that\nhe would lose a challenge. In 2002, his political party the People's National\nCongress Party (PNC) became a coalition partner in the government of Michael\nSomare and Skate became Speaker of the National Parliament. He was appointed\nacting Governor-General in November 2003, a constitutional requirement when that\noffice falls vacant. Sir Pato Kakeraya was scheduled to take up the office on 20\nJanuary 2004, but Skate continued to act in the office because of court\nchallenges to Kakeraya's election. On 3 March 2004, Skate was suspended as\nacting governor-general because of allegations that he misappropriated funds\nduring the 1990s. He then advised the Prime Minister to appoint a cabinet\nminister as acting governor-general. The following day, however, he was cleared\nof the financial charges in court, and he became acting governor-general again.\nIn May 2004, his party left the coalition when he and other members refused to\nsupport a constitutional amendment supported by Somare which would have given\nthe government more time to be immune to no confidence votes. As a result, the\nPNC became the largest opposition party. On 28 May 2004, Skate ceased to be\nSpeaker when the parliament elected a pro-government candidate, Jeffrey Nape.\nThe office of governor-general was still vacant at that stage, so Nape\nautomatically succeeded Skate as acting governor-general.\n\nBill Skate was knighted in January 2005 for services to parliament, becoming Sir\nWilliam Skate.\n\nHe died in hospital on 3 January 2006, in Brisbane, Australia, where he had been\nairlifted after suffering a stroke in late December 2005. He was buried in Port\nMoresby. He was the first Papua New Guinea Prime Minister to die.\n","linknr":156,"url":"William_Skate","recorded":1375081094,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Bill_Skate&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Bill_Skate&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","/wiki/Bill_Skate","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","/w/index.php?title=William_Skate&redirect=no","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/The_Honourable","/wiki/Order_of_St_Michael_and_St_George","/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Papua_New_Guinea","/wiki/Elizabeth_II","/wiki/Sir_Julius_Chan","/wiki/Mekere_Morauta","/wiki/Papua_New_Guinea","/wiki/Brisbane","/wiki/Australia","/wiki/People%27s_National_Congress_Party","/wiki/Order_of_St_Michael_and_St_George","/wiki/Papua_New_Guinea","/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Papua_New_Guinea","/wiki/Speaker_(politics)","/wiki/National_Parliament_of_Papua_New_Guinea","/wiki/Governor-General_of_Papua_New_Guinea","/wiki/Paias_Wingti","/wiki/People%27s_National_Congress_Party","/wiki/Michael_Somare","/wiki/Pato_Kakeraya","/wiki/Jeffrey_Nape","/wiki/Brisbane","/wiki/Australia","/wiki/Port_Moresby","/w/index.php?title=Bill_Skate&action=edit&section=1","http://www.pacificmagazine.net/news/2006/01/04/png-former-prime-minister-sir-william-skate-dies-at-52","http://www.pacificmagazine.net/news/2006/01/13/png-former-pm-sir-bill-skate-laid-to-rest","http://www.pacificmagazine.net/news/2006/01/11/png-public-holiday-declared-for-sir-skates-funeral","http://www.pacificmagazine.net/news/2005/12/30/png-sir-bill-skate-ailing-medivacked-to-queensland-hospital","/wiki/List_of_national_leaders","/wiki/Julius_Chan","/wiki/List_of_Prime_Ministers_of_Papua_New_Guinea","/wiki/Mekere_Morauta","/wiki/Silas_Atopare","/wiki/Governor-General_of_Papua_New_Guinea","/wiki/Jeffrey_Nape","/wiki/Silas_Atopare","/wiki/Jeffrey_Nape","/wiki/Template:PNGPMs","/w/index.php?title=Template_talk:PNGPMs&action=edit&redlink=1","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:PNGPMs&action=edit","/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Papua_New_Guinea","/wiki/Michael_Somare","/wiki/Julius_Chan","/wiki/Michael_Somare","/wiki/Paias_Wingti","/wiki/Rabbie_Namaliu","/wiki/Paias_Wingti","/wiki/Julius_Chan","/wiki/John_Giheno","/wiki/Julius_Chan","/wiki/Mekere_Morauta","/wiki/Michael_Somare","/wiki/Sam_Abal","/wiki/Michael_Somare","/wiki/Sam_Abal","/wiki/Peter_O%27Neill","/wiki/File:Emblem_of_Papua_New_Guinea.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/Emblem_of_Papua_New_Guinea.svg/75px-Emblem_of_Papua_New_Guinea.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","/wiki/Papua_New_Guinea","/wiki/Brisbane","/wiki/Australia","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bill_Skate&oldid=561073630","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Papua_New_Guinean_people_of_English_descent","/wiki/Category:1953_births","/wiki/Category:2006_deaths","/wiki/Category:Deaths_from_stroke","/wiki/Category:Governors-General_of_Papua_New_Guinea","/wiki/Category:Members_of_the_National_Parliament_of_Papua_New_Guinea","/wiki/Category:Papua_New_Guinea_party_leaders","/wiki/Category:Prime_Ministers_of_Papua_New_Guinea","/wiki/Category:Speakers_of_the_National_Parliament_of_Papua_New_Guinea","/wiki/Category:Knights_Commander_of_the_Order_of_St_Michael_and_St_George","/wiki/Category:People%27s_National_Congress_Party_(Papua_New_Guinea)_politicians","/wiki/Category:Papua_New_Guinean_people_of_Australian_descent","/wiki/Category:Use_dmy_dates_from_October_2011","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Bill+Skate&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Bill+Skate","/wiki/Bill_Skate","/wiki/Talk:Bill_Skate","#","/wiki/Bill_Skate","/w/index.php?title=Bill_Skate&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Bill_Skate&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Bill_S
