The scientific name is from the Greek ophis meaning\n\"snake\", and refers to their eel-like appearance. However, they can be\ndistinguished from true eels of the order Anguilliformes by the ventral fins,\nwhich are developed into a forked barbel-like organ below the mouth in the cusk-\neels; in the true eels by contrast they are never well-developed and usually\nmissing entirely.<ref></ref>\n\nThey are found in temperate and tropical oceans throughout the world. They live\nclose to the sea bottom, at below depth. One species, [[Abyssobrotula\ngalatheae]], was recorded at the bottom of the Puerto Rico trench, making it the\ndeepest recorded fish at .<ref name=EoF></ref>\n\nThe largest species, [[Lamprogrammus shcherbachevi]], grows up to in length, but\nmost species are shorter than a metre. Unlike their close relatives, the\nviviparous brotulas of the Bythitidae, they are egg-laying, and the larvae live\namongst the plankton, relatively close to the surface.<ref name=EoF/>\n\nA few species are fished commercially, most notably the pink cusk-eel,\nGenypterus blacodes.\n",
