As such, planning is a\nfundamental property of intelligent behavior. This thought process is essential\nto the creation and refinement of a plan, or integration of it with other plans;\nthat is, it combines forecasting of developments with the preparation of\nscenarios of how to react to them.\n\nAn important, albeit often ignored aspect of planning, is the relationship\nit holds with forecasting. Forecasting can be described as predicting what\nthe future will look like, whereas planning predicts what the future should\nlook like.<ref>[http://www.forecastingprinciples.com/index.php?option=com_c-\nontent&task=view&id=3&Itemid=3#field_2 How does forecasting relate to\nplanning?] ForecastingPrinciples.com</ref> The counterpart to planning is\nspontaneous order.\n","title":"planning","headings":["Planning topics","Planning process","Types of planning","See also","References","Further reading"]},"micro-relation":["2: Plan","2: Basal_ganglia","2: Frontal_lobe","2: Business_plan","2: Marketing_plan","2: Environmental_planning","2: Regional_planning","2: Urban_planning","2: Spatial_planning","2: Automated_planning_and_scheduling","2: Strategic_planning","1: Thinking","1: Intelligence","1: Forecasting","1: Spontaneous_order","1: Executive_function","1: Neurological","1: Neuropsychological","1: Neuroimaging","1: Working_memory","1: Neural_pathway","1: Traumatic_brain_injury","1: Neurodegenerative_disease","1: Striatum","1: Tower_of_Hanoi","1: Tower_of_London_test","1: Cerebral_blood_flow","1: I.e.","1: Management","1: Land-use_planning","1: Urban_planner","1: Architectural_planning","1: Comprehensive_planning","1: Contingency_planning","1: Economic_planning","1: Enterprise_architecture_planning","1: Event_planning_and_production","1: Family_planning","1: Financial_planning","1: Land_use_planning","1: Landscape_planning","1: Life_planning","1: Network_resource_planning","1: Operational_planning","1: Site_planning","1: Succession_planning","1: Balanced_scorecard","1: Collaborative_Planning,_Forecasting,_and_Replenishment","1: Futures_Studies","1: Planning_fallacy","1: Project_management","1: Time_management"]}
