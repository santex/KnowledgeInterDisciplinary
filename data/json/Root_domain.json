{"cursor":"5662","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'DNS root zone' is the top-level DNS zone in a hierarchical namespace using\nthe Domain Name System (DNS) for computers. Most commonly it refers to the root\nzone of the largest global network, the Internet.\n\nThe US Department of Commerce NTIA exercises the ultimate authority over the DNS\nroot zone of the Internet. The zone is managed by the Internet\nAssigned Numbers Authority (IANA) as the operator while a third party is\ncontracted by the NTIA as the root zone maintainer. The IANA operator is ICANN\nand the root zone maintainer is Verisign, Inc.\n\nA combination of limits in the DNS definition and in certain protocols, namely\nthe practical size of unfragmented User Datagram Protocol (UDP) packets,\nresulted in a limited number of root server addresses that can be accommodated\nin DNS name query responses. This limit has determined the number of name server\ninstallations at (currently) 13 clusters, serving the needs of the entire public\nInternet worldwide.\n","linknr":134,"url":"Root_domain","recorded":1362551615,"links":15,"instances":["computing"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Domain name system|Root zone"],"headings":["Initialization of DNS service","Redundancy and diversity","Management","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["bootstrapping","computing"]],"members":["bootstrapping"],"related":["DNS_zone","Domain_Name_System","Internet","US_Department_of_Commerce","NTIA","Internet_Assigned_Numbers_Authority","ICANN","Verisign","User_Datagram_Protocol","Root_nameserver","Top-level_domain","Circular_dependency","Bootstrapping_(computing)","BIND","ICANN","InterNIC","EDNS","IPv6","Internet_Protocol","Anycast","VeriSign","ICANN","Internet_Assigned_Numbers_Authority","US_Department_of_Commerce","NTIA","VeriSign","Alternative_DNS_root","AS112","Internet_backbone"]}
