{"cursor":"2653","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Bond order' is the number of chemical bonds between a pair of atoms. For\nexample, in diatomic nitrogen Nâ¡N the bond order is 3, while in acetylene\nHâCâ¡CâH the bond order between the two carbon atoms is also 3, and the CâH bond\norder is 1. Bond order gives an indication to the stability of a bond.\n\nIn molecules that have resonance or nonclassical bonding, bond order does not\nneed to be an integer. In benzene, where the delocalized molecular orbitals\ncontain 6 pi electrons over six carbons essentially yielding half a pi bond\ntogether with the sigma bond for each pair of carbon atoms, giving a calculated\nbond order of 1.5. Furthermore, bond orders of 1.1, for example, can arise\nunder complex scenarios and essentially refer to bond strength relative to\nbonds with order 1.\n\nIn molecular orbital theory, bond order is also defined as the difference,\ndivided by two, between the number of bonding electrons and the number of\nantibonding electrons as per the equation below. This often but not always\nyields the same result. Bond order is also an index of bond strength and is also\nused extensively in valence bond theory.\n\n: \\text{B.O.} = \\frac{\\text{number of bonding electrons} - \\text{number of\n:antibonding electrons}}{2}\\ \n\nBond orders of one-half can be stable, as shown by the stability of (bond length\n106 pm, bond energy 269 kJ/mol) and (bond length 108 pm, bond energy 251\nkJ/mol). Bruce Averill and Patricia Eldredge, Chemistry: Principles,\nPatterns, and Applications (Pearson/Prentice Hall, 2007), 409.\n\nThe bond order concept is used in molecular dynamics and bond order potentials.\nThe magnitude of the bond order is associated with the bond length. According to\nLinus Pauling in 1947, the bond order is experimentally described by:\n\n: s_{ij} = \\exp{\\left[ \\frac{d_{1} - d_{ij}}{b} \\right]} \n\nwhere d_{1} is the single bond length, d_{ij} is the\nbond length experimentally measured, and b is a constant, depending on the\natoms. Pauling suggested a value of 0.353 Ã for b. The above definition of bond\norder is somewhat ad hoc and only easy to apply for diatomic molecules. A\nstandard quantum mechanical definition for bond order has been debated for a\nlong time.
