The\ndisease is also known by the Latin names 'Variola' or Variola vera, derived from\nvarius (\"spotted\") or varus (\"pimple\"). The disease was originally known in\nEnglish as the \"'pox'\" or \"'red plague'\"; La Belle\nCompagnie. \"[http://www.labelle.org/top_diseases.html Medieval Diseases]\".\nAccessed 28 Jan 2013. the term \"smallpox\" was first used in Britain in the\n15th century to distinguish variola from the \"great pox\" (syphilis). The last naturally occurring case of smallpox (Variola\nminor) was diagnosed on 26 October 1977.\n\nSmallpox localized in small blood vessels of the skin and in the mouth and\nthroat. In the skin it resulted in a characteristic maculopapular rash and,\nlater, raised fluid-filled blisters. V. major produces a more serious disease\nand has an overall mortality rate of 30â35%. V. minor causes a milder form of\ndisease (also known as '[[alastrim]]', 'cottonpox', 'milkpox', 'whitepox', and\n'Cuban itch') which kills about 1% of its victims. Long-term complications of V. major\ninfection include characteristic scars, commonly on the face, which occur in\n65â85% of survivors. Blindness resulting from corneal ulceration and\nscarring, and limb deformities due to arthritis and osteomyelitis are less\ncommon complications, seen in about 2â5% of cases.\n\nSmallpox is believed to have emerged in human populations about 10,000 BC. The earliest physical evidence of it is probably the pustular\nrash on the mummified body of Pharaoh Ramses V of Egypt.\nThe disease killed an estimated 400,000 Europeans annually during the closing\nyears of the 18th century (including five reigning monarchs), J.\nN. Hays (2005). \"[http://books.google.com/books?id=GyE8Qt-\nkS1kC&pg=PA151&dq=&lr=&hl=en&cd=23#v=onepage&q=false Epidemics and pandemics:\ntheir impacts on human history]\". ABC-CLIO. p.151. ISBN 1-85109-658-2 and\nwas responsible for a third of all blindness. \"[h-\nttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=vacc.chapter.3 Smallpox and\nVaccinia]\". National Center for Biotechnology Information. Of all those\ninfected, 20â60%âand over 80% of infected childrenâdied from the\ndisease. Smallpox was responsible for an estimated 300â500 million\ndeaths during the 20th century.

Organization (WHO) estimated that 15 million people contracted\nthe disease and that two million died in that year.\n\nAfter vaccination campaigns throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, the WHO\ncertified the eradication of smallpox in 1979.\nSmallpox is one of two infectious diseases to have been eradicated, the other\nbeing rinderpest, which was declared eradicated in\n2011.\n","linknr":1525,"url":"smallpox","recorded":1362581272,"links":151,"instances":["397_bc","circulatory","biology","optics","classical_greek_term","theologian","medical","epidemiology","linguistics"],"pdf":["http://whqlibdoc.who.int/smallpox/9241561106_chp5.pdf","http://whqlibdoc.who.int/smallpox/WH_5_1980_p22.pdf","http://whqlibdoc.who.int/smallpox/WH_5_1980_p22.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20100409144819/http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/smallpox.pdf","http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/smallpox.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20100409144819/http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/smallpox.pdf","http://emergency.cdc.gov/agent/smallpox/training/overview/pdf/diseasemgmt.pdf","http://emergency.cdc.gov/agent/smallpox/training/overview/pdf/diseasemgmt.pdf","http://whqlibdoc.who.int/smallpox/9241561106.pdf","http://whqlibdoc.who.int/smallpox/9241561106.pdf","http://www.bt.cdc.gov/agent/smallpox/vaccination/pdf/vaccine-overview.pdf","http://www.bt.cdc.gov/agent/smallpox/vaccination/pdf/vaccine-overview.pdf","http://whqlibdoc.who.int/smallpox/9241561106_chp9.pdf","http://whqlibdoc.who.int/smallpox/9241561106_chp9.pdf","http://whqlibdoc.who.int/smallpox/9241561106_chp9.pdf","http://whqlibdoc.who.int/smallpox/9241561106_chp9.pdf","http://whqlibdoc.who.int/smallpox/9241561106.pdf","http://whqlibdoc.who.int/smallpox/9241561106.pdf","http://www1.szu.cz/svi/cejph/archiv/2010-1-10-full.pdf","http://www1.szu.cz/svi/cejph/archiv/2010-1-10-full.pdf","http://www1.szu.cz/svi/cejph/archiv/2010-1-11-full.pdf","http://www1.szu.cz/svi/cejph/archiv/2010-1-11-full.pdf","http://usamriid.detrick.army.mil/education/bluebookpdf/USAMRIID%20Blue%20Book%205th%20Edition.pdf","http://usamriid.detrick.army.mil/education/bluebookpdf/USAMRIID%20Blue%20Book%205th%20Edition.pdf","http://www.bt.cdc.gov/agent/smallpox/training/overview/pdf/eradicationhistory.pdf","http://www.biosafety-info.net/file_dir/413148854af122567.pdf","http://www.smallpoxbiosafety.org/papers/WHAvariola2011.pdf","http://whqlibdoc.who.int/smallpox/9241561106.pdf","http://whqlibdoc.who.int/smallpox/9241561106.pdf"],"categories":["Eradicated
