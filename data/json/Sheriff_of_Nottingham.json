{"cursor":"7361","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n.]] The 'Sheriff of Nottingham' is an important figure in the legend of Robin\nHood. The holder of the office of Nottingham's Sheriff, it is his task to\ncapture outlaws such as Robin Hood, either to ensure the safety of trade routes\nthrough Sherwood Forest, or to keep them from poaching the King's deer. In some\nstories, the Sheriff of Nottingham is portrayed as having a lecherous desire for\nRobin Hood's lady, Maid Marian. He is widely considered to be the principal\nvillain of the Robin Hood stories, appearing frequently alongside such enemies\nof Robin Hood as Sir Guy of Gisbourne or Prince John (though rarely both).\n\nThe legends are generally set far from Nottingham, this fits the historical\nposition of High Sheriff of Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire and the Royal Forests\n(from 1068 until 1568). In the film [[Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves]], the\nSheriff's influence has grown so great he attempts to take control of the\nthrone, due to his power outside the region of Nottingham.\n\nIn some versions, the Sheriff is more a cowardly schemer while his\nassistant, Sir Guy of Gisbourne, is a more competent and determined physical\nthreat to Robin. In other versions, the Sheriff answers to Prince John, who\nis the main villain.\n\nThe historical sheriff upon which the stories are based may have been William de\nWendenal, Roger de Laci, or William Brewer.\n\n*In the 1938 film [[The Adventures of Robin Hood (film)|The Adventures of Robin\nHood]], starring Errol Flynn in the title role, the Sheriff is played by\nMelville Cooper. He is nominally characterized as a coward and a secondary to\nSir Guy of Gisbourne, but is actually quite intelligent. For instance, he is the\none who prudently advises Sir Guy to increase their caravan's security to ward\noff a possible ambush by Robin Hood, which Sir Guy disregards to his sorrow, and\nhe is the mastermind of the archery tournament trap that successfully captures\nRobin Hood.\n\n* In [[Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves]], in which he is the main antagonist\n  (Prince John is completely ommitted from this adaptation), he is played by\n  Alan Rickman. His given name is said to be George. More ambitious than most\n  depictions, the Sheriff's agenda is apparently to supplant Richard the\n  Lionhearted by marrying into royalty, eventually becoming king, or at least\n  ensuring his future descendants would assume the throne.\n\n* He was played by Keith Allen in the BBC series [[Robin Hood (2006 TV\n  series)|Robin Hood]], from 2006. Allen plays the Sheriff, named Vaisey, as a\n  psychopath with a manipulative, sarcastic nature. In the show's third\n  series, Vaisey is deposed by Prince John as a result of his failure to\n  assassinate King Richard, whereupon he fakes his own death. He is\n  temporarily replaced by his seeming killer, Guy of Gisborne, for one episode\n  before Gisborne is outlawed; Gisborne's sister Isabella becomes Sheriff for\n  several episodes before Vaisey returns, planning to regain Nottingham by\n  force, in the series finale.\n\n* In the Disney version of ''Robin Hood'', the Sheriff is a large\n  anthropomorphic gray wolf with a thick Southern United States dialect, voiced\n  by Alabama-born comedian Pat Buttram. He serves as Prince John's chief\n  enforcer, collecting unlimited taxes from the people of Nottingham and hunting\n  Robin Hood and Little John. This version is depicted as being far less smart\n  than he realises, claiming he can see through Robin Hood's disguises when he\n  fails to see through two of them. In the film's climax, he briefly battles\n  Robin inside Prince John's burning tower and is left trapped behind some\n  curtains, but the film's final scene makes it clear that he survived. He is\n  last seen breaking rocks down in the Royal Rock Pile, having been sentenced to\n  do so along with Prince John and Sir Hiss by King Richard. During story\n  development, the animators considered experimenting with a different animal\n  concept for the villain by making him a goat. However, they were overruled by\n  the director who wanted to keep to traditional animal stereotypes and ordered\n  the Sheriff be a wolf.\n\n* The Richard Kluger novel The Sheriff of Nottingham gives a positive portrayal\n  of the real-life 13th century sheriff Philip Mark as a good man doing a\n  thankless task. (The same sheriff appeared as a ruthless despot in an episode\n  of the [[Robin of Sherwood]] TV series.)\n\n* In Robin of Sherwood, the Sheriff is portrayed as a cynical opportunist given\n  to violent outbursts, played by Nickolas Grace. His name, Robert de Rainault,\n  comes from Evelyn Charles Vivian's retelling of the legend. He also bears the\n  dubious honour of being the first sheriff to kill Robin. Grace's portrayal of\n  a moody and obsessive individual, with a sardonic sense of black humour, was a\n  notable influence on future interpretations of the role.\n\n* The Sheriff of Nottingham is spoofed as Mervyn, \"The Sheriff of Rottingham\"\n  (Roger Rees), in Mel Brooks' 1993 movie [[Robin Hood: Men in Tights]]. This\n  depiction of the Sheriff appears to suffer from a form of aphasia, often\n  mixing up his words.\n\n* The Sheriff was parodied in the children's television series [[Maid Marian and\n  her Merry Men]] as a foolish schemer, played by Tony Robinson.\n\n* The Sheriff is more sympathetically portrayed by Robert Shaw in the 1976 film\n  [[Robin and Marian]]. He is also shown is this film to not only equal Robin\n  physically, but also be superior to him, as he dominates Robin in a one-on-one\n  sword-fight towards the end of the movie, almost killing Robin.\n\n* A cowardly, inept Sheriff of Nottingham is played by actor Matthew Macfadyen\n  in the Ridley Scott film [[Robin Hood (2010 film) |Robin Hood]].\n\n* In the [[Star Trek The Next Generation]] episode \"Qpid\", Q takes on the role\n  of the Sheriff of Nottingham\n","linknr":178,"url":"Sheriff_of_Nottingham","recorded":1374546269,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Sheriff_of_Nottingham&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Sheriff_of_Nottingham&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Sheriff_of_Nottingham_(position)","/wiki/File:Sheriff_of_Nottingham.PNG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/33/Sheriff_of_Nottingham.PNG","/wiki/File:Sheriff_of_Nottingham.PNG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf8/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/File:FileRobinhood140.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b9/FileRobinhood140.jpg/200px-FileRobinhood140.jpg","/wiki/File:FileRobinhood140.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf8/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Disney","/wiki/Robin_Hood","/wiki/Nottingham","/wiki/Sheriff","/wiki/Sherwood_Forest","/wiki/Poaching","/wiki/Deer","/wiki/Maid_Marian","/wiki/Guy_of_Gisbourne","/wiki/John_of_England","/wiki/High_Sheriff_of_Nottinghamshire,_Derbyshire_and_the_Royal_Forests","/wiki/Robin_Hood:_Prince_of_Thieves","/wiki/William_de_Wendenal","/wiki/De_Laci","/wiki/William_Brewer_(justice)","/wiki/The_Adventures_of_Robin_Hood_(film)","/wiki/Errol_Flynn","/wiki/Melville_Cooper","/wiki/Robin_Hood:_Prince_of_Thieves","/wiki/Alan_Rickman","/wiki/Richard_I_of_England","/wiki/Keith_Allen_(actor)","/wiki/BBC","/wiki/Robin_Hood_(2006_TV_series)","/wiki/Vaisey,_Sheriff_of_Nottingham","/wiki/Psychopathy","/wiki/John,_King_of_England","/wiki/Richard_I_of_England","/wiki/Guy_of_Gisborne","/wiki/Series_finale","/wiki/Robin_Hood_(1973_film)","/wiki/Gray_wolf","/wiki/Southern_United_States","/wiki/Alabama","/wiki/Pat_Buttram","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Richard_Kluger","/wiki/Philip_Marc","/wiki/Robin_of_Sherwood","/wiki/Nickolas_Grace","/wiki/Evelyn_Charles_Vivian","/wiki/Roger_Rees","/wiki/Mel_Brooks","/wiki/1993_in_film","/wiki/Robin_Hood:_Men_in_Tights","/wiki/Aphasia","/wiki/Maid_Marian_and_her_Merry_Men","/wiki/Tony_Robinson","/wiki/Robert_Shaw_(actor)","/wiki/Robin_and_Marian","/wiki/Matthew_Macfadyen","/wiki/Ridley_Scott","/wiki/Robin_Hood_(2010_film)","/wiki/Star_Trek_The_Next_Generation","/wiki/Qpid","/wiki/Q_(Star_Trek)","/w/index.php?title=Sheriff_of_Nottingham&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","/w/index.php?title=Sheriff_of_Nottingham&action=edit&section=2","http://www.robinhood.info/","http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0003910/","/wiki/Internet_Movie_Database","http://www.nottinghamcity.gov.uk/sitemap/council_government_and_democracy/cs_nottingham_s_council_house/sheriffofnottingham.htm","http://myweb.ecomplanet.com/kirk6479/mycustompage0035.htm","/wiki/Template:Robin_Hood","/wiki/Template_talk:Robin_Hood","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Robin_Hood&action=edit","/wiki/Robin_Hood","/wiki/Robin_Hood","/wiki/Maid_Marian","/wiki/Merry_Men","/wiki/Much_the_Miller%27s_Son","/wiki/Little_John","/wiki/Friar_Tuck","/wiki/Alan-a-Dale","/wiki/Will_Scarlet","/wiki/Will_Stutely","/wiki/Gilbert_Whitehand","/wiki/Arthur_a_Bland","/wiki/David_of_Doncaster","/wiki/Sir_Guy_of_Gisbourne","/wiki/John,_King_of_England","/wiki/Bishop_of_Hereford_(Robin_Hood)","/wiki/Richard_at_the_Lee","/wiki/Sherwood_Forest","/wiki/Nottingham","/wiki/Loxley,_South_Yorkshire","/wiki/Barnsdale","/wiki/Wentbridge","/wiki/Robin_Hood_in_popular_culture","/wiki/List_of_films_and_television_series_featuring_Robin_Hood","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sheriff_of_Nottingham&oldid=563050845","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Film_characters","/wiki/Category:History_of_Nottinghamshire","/wiki/Category:Local_government_in_Nottinghamshire","/wiki/Category:Nottingham","/wiki/Category:Fictional_police_officers","/wiki/Category:Robin_Hood_characters","/wiki/Category:Disney%27s_Robin_Hood_characters","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Sheriff+of+Nottingham&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Sheriff+of+Nottingham","/wiki/Sheriff_of_Nottingham","/wiki/Talk:Sheriff_of_Nottingham","#","/wiki/Sheriff_of_Nottingham","/w/index.php?title=Sheriff_of_Nottingham&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Sheriff_of_Nottingham&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf8/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Ma
