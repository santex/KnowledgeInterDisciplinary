{"cursor":"21155","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n (Buphagus africanus) on the back of a large mammal]]\n\n'Cleaning symbiosis' is a mutually beneficial association (symbiosis) between\ntwo species, where one (the cleaner) removes and eats parasites from the skin of\nthe other (the client). Cleaning symbiosis is well-known among marine fish,\nwhere some small species of cleaner fish, notably wrasses but also species in\nother genera, are specialised to feed almost exclusively by cleaning larger fish\nand other marine animals. Other cleaning symbioses exist between birds and\nmammals, and in other groups.\n\nCleaning behaviour was first described by the Greek historian Herodotus in\nabout 420 BC, though his example (birds serving crocodiles) appears to occur\nonly rarely.\n\nThe role of cleaning symbioses has been debated by biologists for over thirty\nyears. Some believe that cleaning represents selfless co-operation, essentially\npure mutualism. Others such as Robert Trivers hold that it illustrates mutual\nselfishness, reciprocal altruism. Others again believe that cleaning behaviour\nis simply one-sided exploitation, a form of parasitism.\n\nCheating, where either a cleaner sometimes harms its client, or a predatory\nspecies mimics a cleaner, also occurs. Predatory cheating is analogous to\nBatesian mimicry, as where a harmless hoverfly mimics a stinging wasp, though\nwith the tables turned. Some genuine cleaner fish, such as gobies and wrasse,\nhave the same colours and patterns, in an example of convergent evolution.\nMutual resemblance among cleaner fish is analogous to Mullerian mimicry, as\nwhere stinging bees and wasps mimic each other.\n","linknr":416,"url":"Cleaning_symbiosis","recorded":1362509391,"links":35,"instances":["biology","biology"],"pdf":["http://www.ufrgs.br/ni/vol1num2/1(2)scientificnotes_02.pdf","http://www.ufrgs.br/ni/vol1num2/1(2)scientificnotes_02.pdf","http://www.lexagrutter.com/Publications/paper%207.pdf","http://www.lexagrutter.com/Publications/paper%207.pdf","http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/441/1/curryphd.pdf","http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/441/1/curryphd.pdf","http://www.opwall.com/Library/Opwall%20library%20pdfs/Journal%20publications/stummer%20size%20and%20stripes.pdf","http://www.opwall.com/Library/Opwall%20library%20pdfs/Journal%20publications/stummer%20size%20and%20stripes.pdf"],"categories":["Evolutionary biology","Ethology","Mutualism (biology)"],"headings":["History","A disputed relationship","Mimicry among cleaner fish","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/94/Symbol_support_vote.svg/15px-Symbol_support_vote.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b7/Flickr_-_Rainbirder_-_Yellow-billed_Oxpecker_%28Buphagus_africanus%29.jpg/220px-Flickr_-_Rainbirder_-_Yellow-billed_Oxpecker_%28Buphagus_africanus%29.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/33/PloverCrocodileSymbiosis.jpg/220px-PloverCrocodileSymbiosis.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c2/Lysmata_amboinensis_cleans_mouth_of_a_Moray_eel.jpg/220px-Lysmata_amboinensis_cleans_mouth_of_a_Moray_eel.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/Impala_mutualim_with_birds_wide.jpg/220px-Impala_mutualim_with_birds_wide.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e5/Green_turtle_swimming_over_coral_reefs_in_Kona.jpg/220px-Green_turtle_swimming_over_coral_reefs_in_Kona.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f4/Stenopus_hispidus_%28Banded_cleaner_shrimp%29.jpg/220px-Stenopus_hispidus_%28Banded_cleaner_shrimp%29.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Kaldari_pseudoscorpion_01.jpg/220px-Kaldari_pseudoscorpion_01.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/55/Cleaner_station_komodo.jpg/220px-Cleaner_station_komodo.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/Elacatinus_evelynae.jpg/220px-Elacatinus_evelynae.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/02/Plagiotremus_rhinorhynchos.jpg/220px-Plagiotremus_rhinorhynchos.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/12px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["mutualism","biology"],["mutualism","biology"],["cheating","biology"]],"members":["mutualism","cheating"],"related":["Symbiosis","Cleaner_fish","Wrasse","Mutualism_(biology)","Reciprocal_altruism","Parasitism","Mimicry","Batesian_mimicry","Convergent_evolution","Mullerian_mimicry","Nile_crocodile","Henry_Scherren","Herodotus","Sandpiper","Gymnothorax","Impala","Packrats","Mutualism_(biology)","Marine_iguana","Marine_biology","Convergent_evolution","Striped_Raphael_catfish","Hoplias","Cleaner_shrimp","Loggerhead_sea_turtle","Decapoda","Hawksbill_sea_turtle","Savanna","Red-billed_Oxpecker","Tick","Mammal","Impala","Rhinoceros","Cattle","Tick","Capybara","Pseudoscorpion","Packrat","Yellow_tang","Green_sea_turtle","Ectoparasite","Robert_Trivers","Reciprocal_altruism","Goby","Wrasse","Convergent_evolution","Mullerian_mimicry","Aposematic","Sabre-toothed_blenny","Blenny","Aggressive_mimicry","Lepidophage","Batesian_mimicry","Cheating_(biology)","Animal_coloration","Cleaner_fish","Mimicry","Reciprocal_altruism"]}
