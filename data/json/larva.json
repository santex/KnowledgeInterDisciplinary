      "text" : "\n\n'', butterfly]] A 'larva' (plural larvae ) is a distinct juvenile form many\nanimals undergo before metamorphosis into adults. Animals with indirect\ndevelopment such as insects, amphibians, or cnidarians typically have a larval\nphase of their life cycle.\n\nThe larva's appearance is generally very different from the adult form (e.g.\ncaterpillars and butterflies). A larva often has unique structures and organs\nthat do not occur in the adult form, and may have a considerably different diet.\n\nLarvae are frequently adapted to environments separate from adults. For example,\nsome larvae such as tadpoles live exclusively in aquatic environments, but can\nlive outside water as adult frogs. By living in a distinct environment, larvae\nmay be given shelter from predators and reduce competition for resources with\nthe adult population.\n\nAnimals in the larval stage will consume food to fuel their transition into the\nadult form. Some species such as barnacles are immobile as adults, and use their\nmobile larval form to distribute themselves.\n\nThe larvae of some species (for example, some newts) can become pubescent and\nnot further develop into the adult form. This is a type of neoteny.\nsolidaginis'' Goldenrod Gall Fly larva]]\n\nIt is a misunderstanding that the larval form always reflects the group's\nevolutionary history. This could be the case, but often the larval stage has\nevolved secondarily, as in insects. In these cases the larval form may differ\nmore than the adult form from the group's common origin.\n",
