      "text" : "\n'': fresco by Vasari & Cristofano Gherardi (c. 1560, Sala di Cosimo I, Palazzo\nVecchio, Florence).]]\n\n'Castration' (also known as '[[neutering]]') is any action, surgical, chemical\nor otherwise, by which a biological male loses use of the testes (orchiectomy).\nThis causes sterilization, i.e. prevents them from reproducing; it also greatly\nreduces the production of certain hormones, such as testosterone.\n\nThe term \"castration\" is sometimes also used to refer to the removal of the\novaries in the female, otherwise known as an oophorectomy or, in animals,\nspaying. The estrogen that the females produce becomes obsolete with this\nsurgical procedure.\n\nThe procedure may be purposely performed on humans variously as a punishment, or\nto decrease the libido of sex offenders. In animals, castration is intended for\nfavouring a given desired development of the animal or of its habits, or\npreventing overpopulation.\n",
