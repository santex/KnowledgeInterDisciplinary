{"cursor":"42920","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Carbon sequestration' is the process of capture and long-term storage of\natmospheric carbon dioxide () and may refer specifically to:\n\n* \"The process of removing carbon from the atmosphere and depositing it in a\n  reservoir.\" When carried out deliberately, this may also be\n  referred to as carbon dioxide removal, which is a form of geoengineering.\n\n* The process of carbon capture and storage, where carbon dioxide is removed\n  from flue gases, such as on power stations, before being stored in underground\n  reservoirs.\n\n* Natural biogeochemical cycling of carbon between the atmosphere and\n  reservoirs, such as by chemical weathering of rocks.\n\nCarbon sequestration describes long-term storage of carbon dioxide or other\nforms of carbon to either mitigate or defer global warming and avoid dangerous\nclimate change. It has been proposed as a way to slow the atmospheric and marine\naccumulation of greenhouse gases, which are released by burning fossil\nfuels.\n\nCarbon dioxide is naturally captured from the atmosphere through biological,\nchemical or physical processes. Some anthropogenic sequestration techniques\nexploit these natural processes, while some use entirely artificial\nprocesses.\n\nCarbon dioxide may be captured as a pure by-product in processes related to\npetroleum refining or from flue gases from power generation.\n[http://www.pointcarbon.com/article.php?articleID=3774&categoryID=147 ]\nsequestration includes the storage part of carbon capture and storage, which\nrefers to large-scale, permanent artificial capture and sequestration of\nindustrially produced using subsurface saline aquifers, reservoirs, ocean water,\naging oil fields, or other carbon sinks.\n","linknr":699,"url":"Carbon_sequestration","recorded":1362500100,"links":36,"instances":["chemistry","geology","scientist","geology"],"pdf":["http://www.nationalaglawcenter.org/assets/crs/RL31432.pdf","http://www.cosis.net/abstracts/EGU2008/10885/EGU2008-A-10885.pdf","http://www.cosis.net/abstracts/EGU2008/10885/EGU2008-A-10885.pdf","http://www.johnduke.com/JDukeETCC09052007.pdf","http://www.johnduke.com/JDukeETCC09052007.pdf","http://www.biogeosciences-discuss.net/6/1/2009/bgd-6-1-2009-print.pdf","http://www.biogeosciences-discuss.net/6/1/2009/bgd-6-1-2009-print.pdf","http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg3/ar4-wg3-chapter3.pdf","http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg3/ar4-wg3-chapter3.pdf","http://sequestration.mit.edu/pdf/carbonates.pdf","http://sequestration.mit.edu/pdf/carbonates.pdf","http://www.netl.doe.gov/publications/proceedings/01/carbon_seq/6c1.pdf","http://www.netl.doe.gov/publications/proceedings/01/carbon_seq/6c1.pdf","https://bioenergykdf.net/sites/default/files/zpdfzholderz/NREL_Data/KC_091102094516.pdf","http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/10192734-xc1wDZ/webviewable/10192734.pdf","https://inlportal.inl.gov/portal/server.pt/gateway/PTARGS_0_2_816_259_0_43/http%3B/exps3.inl.gov%3B7087/publishedcontent/publish/communities/inl_gov/about_inl/home_page_fact_sheets/sheets/co2_sequestration_4.pdf"],"categories":["Carbon
