[http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/ngeo941.html\nBouvier, Audrey and Meenakshi Wadhwa, \"The age of the solar system redefined by\nthe oldest Pb-Pb age of a meteoritic inclusion\"]. Nature Geoscience, Nature\nPublishing Group, a division of Macmillan Publishers Limited. Published online\n2010-08-22, retrieved 2010-08-26, .  Date based on oldest inclusions\nfound to date in meteorites, thought to be among the first solid material to\nform in the collapsing solar nebula. Most of the collapsing mass\ncollected in the centre, forming the Sun, while the rest flattened into a\nprotoplanetary disk out of which the planets, moons, asteroids, and other small\nSolar System bodies formed.\n\nThis widely accepted model, known as the nebular hypothesis, was first developed\nin the 18th century by Emanuel Swedenborg, Immanuel Kant, and Pierre-Simon\nLaplace. Its subsequent development has interwoven a variety of scientific\ndisciplines including astronomy, physics, geology, and planetary science. Since\nthe dawn of the space age in the 1950s and the discovery of extrasolar planets\nin the 1990s, the model has been both challenged and refined to account for new\nobservations.\n\nThe Solar System has evolved considerably since its initial formation. Many\nmoons have formed from circling discs of gas and dust around their parent\nplanets, while other moons are thought to have formed independently and later\nbeen captured by their planets. Still others, as the Earth's Moon, may be the\nresult of giant collisions. Collisions between bodies have occurred continually\nup to the present day and have been central to the evolution of the Solar\nSystem. The positions of the planets often shifted, and planets have switched\nplaces. This planetary migration is now thought to have been\nresponsible for much of the Solar System's early evolution.\n\nIn roughly 5 billion years, the Sun will cool and expand outward many times\nits current diameter (becoming a red giant), before casting off its outer layers\nas a planetary nebula and leaving behind a stellar remnant known as a white\ndwarf. In the far distant future, the gravity of passing stars will gradually\nreduce the Sun's retinue of planets. Some planets will be destroyed, others\nejected into interstellar space. Ultimately, over the course of tens of billions\nof years, it is likely that the Sun will be left with none of the original\nbodies in orbit around it.\n","linknr":1578,"url":"Solar_nebula","recorded":1362371882,"links":105,"instances":["moon","moon","astrophysics","moon","moon","moon","astrophysics","number","moon","physics","moon","moon","moon","moon","moon","moon","mineral","planet"],"pdf":["http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v435/n7041/pdf/nature03676.pdf","http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v435/n7041/pdf/nature03676.pdf","http://www.springerlink.com/content/r5825j48k66n8284/fulltext.pdf","http://www.springerlink.com/content/r5825j48k66n8284/fulltext.pdf","http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/~kstanek/astro200/disk-protoplanet.pdf","http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/~kstanek/astro200/disk-protoplanet.pdf","http://www.gps.caltech.edu/classes/ge133/reading/asteroids.pdf","http://www.gps.caltech.edu/classes/ge133/reading/asteroids.pdf","http://www.boulder.swri.edu/~bottke/Reprints/Bottke_Icarus_2005_179_63-94_Linking_Collision_Dynamics_MB.pdf","http://www.boulder.swri.edu/~bottke/Reprints/Bottke_Icarus_2005_179_63-94_Linking_Collision_Dynamics_MB.pdf","http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~pawel/edgar+artymowicz.pdf","http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~pawel/edgar+artymowicz.pdf","http://www.boulder.swri.edu/~bottke/Reprints/OBrien_2007_Icarus_191_434_Primordial_Excitation_Clearing_Asteroid_Belt.pdf","http://www.boulder.swri.edu/~bottke/Reprints/OBrien_2007_Icarus_191_434_Primordial_Excitation_Clearing_Asteroid_Belt.pdf","http://www.geologie.ac.at/filestore/download/AB0053_051_A.pdf","http://www.geologie.ac.at/filestore/download/AB0053_051_A.pdf","http://www.es.ucsc.edu/~cagnor/papers_pdf/2006AgnorHamilton.pdf","http://www.es.ucsc.edu/~cagnor/papers_pdf/2006AgnorHamilton.pdf","http://www.boulder.swri.edu/~bottke/Reprints/Bottke_IAU197_Belgrade_Origin_Stony_Met.pdf","http://www.boulder.swri.edu/~bottke/Reprints/Bottke_IAU197_Belgrade_Origin_Stony_Met.pdf","http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/~jewitt/papers/JUPITER/JSP.2003.pdf","http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/~jewitt/papers/JUPITER/JSP.2003.pdf","http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/users/wisdom/pluto-chaos.pdf","http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/users/wisdom/pluto-chaos.pdf","http://www.astro.umd.edu/~hamilton/research/preprints/BurSimSho03.pdf","http://www.astro.umd.edu/~hamilton/research/preprints/BurSimSho03.pdf","http://www.lpl.arizona.edu/~rlorenz/redgiant.pdf","http://www.lpl.arizona.edu/~rlorenz/redgiant.pdf","http://www.geology.wisc.edu/%7Evalley/zircons/Wilde2001Nature.pdf","http://www.geology.wisc.edu/%7Evalley/zircons/Wilde2001Nature.pdf"],"categories":["Stellar
