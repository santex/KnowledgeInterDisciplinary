{"cursor":"60316","size":15,"audio":[],"cat":[],"tmpl":[],"currentlang":"en","linknr":848,"url":"Mathematical_logic","article":"'Mathematical logic' (also known as 'symbolic logic') is a subfield of\nmathematics with close connections to the foundations of mathematics,\ntheoretical computer science and philosophical logic. Undergraduate texts\ninclude Boolos, Burgess, and Jeffrey (2002), Enderton (2001), and Mendelson\n(1997). A classic graduate text by Shoenfield (2001) first appeared in\n1967. The field includes both the mathematical study of logic and the\napplications of formal logic to other areas of mathematics. The unifying themes\nin mathematical logic include the study of the expressive power of formal\nsystems and the deductive power of formal proof systems.\n\nMathematical logic is often divided into the fields of set theory, model theory,\nrecursion theory, and proof theory. These areas share basic results on logic,\nparticularly first-order logic, and definability. In computer science\n(particularly in the ACM Classification) mathematical logic encompasses\nadditional topics not detailed in this article; see logic in computer science\nfor those.\n\nSince its inception, mathematical logic has both contributed to, and has been\nmotivated by, the study of foundations of mathematics. This study began in the\nlate 19th century with the development of axiomatic frameworks for geometry,\narithmetic, and analysis. In the early 20th century it was shaped by David\nHilbert's program to prove the consistency of foundational theories. Results of\nKurt GÃ¶del, Gerhard Gentzen, and others provided partial resolution to the\nprogram, and clarified the issues involved in proving consistency. Work in set\ntheory showed that almost all ordinary mathematics can be formalized in terms of\nsets, although there are some theorems that cannot be proven in common axiom\nsystems for set theory. Contemporary work in the foundations of mathematics\noften focuses on establishing which parts of mathematics can be formalized in\nparticular formal systems (as in reverse mathematics) rather than trying to find\ntheories in which all of mathematics can be developed.\n","recorded":1362123892,"portal":[],"list":[],"links":"849","instances":["symbol","symbol","complexity","mathematics","structure","symbol","mathematics","linguistics","mathematics","mathematical_logic","logic","order","mathematical_logic","symbol","logic","logic","logic","mathematics","symbol","formal","mathematics","mathematics","logic","mathematician","computer_science","mathematics","logic","logic","mathematical_logic","mathematical_logic","set_theory"],"pdf":["http://www.mathematik.uni-muenchen.de/~schwicht/lectures/logic/ws03/ml.pdf","http://www.mathematik.uni-muenchen.de/~schwicht/lectures/logic/ws03/ml.pdf","http://www.ams.org/notices/200106/fea-woodin.pdf"],"categories":["Mathematical
