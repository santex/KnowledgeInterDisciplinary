If the solution was not deoxygenated and the iron reduced, the\nprecipitate can vary in color starting from green to reddish brown depending on\nthe iron(III) content. This precipitate is also known as \"green rust\" in the\ncrystal lattice of which iron(II) ions are easily substituted by iron(III) ions\nproduced by its progressive oxidation. In the presence of oxygen the color\nchanges quickly. Green rust is a powerful reducing agent and also a layer double\nhydroxide (LDH) capable to sorb anions because of the presence of positive\nelectrical charges borne on its surface. The mineralogical form of green rust is\na recently discovered fougerite. All forms of green rust (including fougerite)\nare more complex and variable than the ideal iron(II) hydroxide compound. The\nnatural analogue of iron(II) hydroxide compound is a very rare mineral\namakinite, (Fe,Mg)(OH) 2.\n\nIron(II) hydroxide is poorly soluble (1.43 × 10 −3 g/L).\nIt precipitates from the reaction of iron(II) sulfate and hydroxide ions (from a\nsoluble compound containing hydroxide ion):\n\n:FeSO 4 + 2 OH â â Fe(OH) 2 +\nSO 42â\n\nIt is also easily formed as an undesirable by-product of other reactions, a.o.,\nin the synthesis of siderite, an iron carbonate (FeCO 3), if the\ncrystal growth conditions are poorly controlled (reagent concentrations,\naddition rate, addition order, pH, pCO 2, T, aging time, ...).\n","linknr":216,"url":"Iron(II)_hydroxide","recorded":1362486038,"links":38,"instances":["chemistry","ion"],"pdf":["http://www.gfredlee.com/SurfaceWQ/StummOxygenFerrous.pdf"],"categories":["Iron compounds","Hydroxides","Materials"],"headings":["Aging and transformation into magnetite","Uses","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Hydroxid_%C5%BEeleznat%C3%BD.PNG/200px-Hydroxid_%C5%BEeleznat%C3%BD.PNG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fb/Yes_check.svg/7px-Yes_check.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fb/Yes_check.svg/7px-Yes_check.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fb/Yes_check.svg/7px-Yes_check.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fb/Yes_check.svg/7px-Yes_check.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fb/Yes_check.svg/7px-Yes_check.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fb/Yes_check.svg/14px-Yes_check.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fb/Yes_check.svg/10px-Yes_check.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/X_mark.svg/10px-X_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b1/DSC01968_-_Fe_%28II%29_Reactions.JPG/220px-DSC01968_-_Fe_%28II%29_Reactions.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/68/Ferrous_hydroxide.JPG/220px-Ferrous_hydroxide.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["iron(ii_oxide"],["iron(iii_hydroxide"],["iron(ii_sulfate"],["selenite","ion"],["precipitation","chemistry"]],"members":["precipitation","selenite"],"related":["Iron(II)_oxide","Iron(III)_hydroxide","Chemical_compound","Iron(II)_sulfate","Hydroxide","Deoxygenation","Layered_double_hydroxides","Fougerite","Amakinite","Gram","Liter","Siderite","Hydrogen","Schikorr_reaction","Selenite_(ion)","Selenate","Selenate","Selenous_acid","Wetland","Redox","Selenium","Precipitation_(chemistry)","Nickel-iron_battery","Rust","Layered_double_hydroxides","Periodic_table"]}
