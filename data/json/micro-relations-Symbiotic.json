In 1879, the German mycologist Heinrich Anton de Bary\n defined it as \"the living together of unlike organisms.\"\n\nThe definition of symbiosis is controversial among scientists. Some believe\nsymbiosis should only refer to persistent mutualisms, while others believe it\nshould apply to any types of persistent biological interactions (i.e.\nmutualistic, commensalistic, or parasitic).\n\nSome symbiotic relationships are obligate, meaning that both symbionts entirely\ndepend on each other for survival. For example, many lichens consist of fungal\nand photosynthetic symbionts that cannot live on their own. Others are facultative, meaning that\nthey can, but do not have to live with the other organism.\n\nSymbiotic relationships include those associations in which one organism lives\non another (ectosymbiosis, such as mistletoe), or where one partner lives inside\nthe other (endosymbiosis, such as lactobacilli and other bacteria in humans or\nSymbiodinium in corals). Symbiosis is also classified by physical attachment of\nthe organisms; symbiosis in which the organisms have bodily union is called\nconjunctive symbiosis, and symbiosis in which they are not in union is called\ndisjunctive symbiosis. \"symbiosis.\" Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary.
