Biochemical events\nlead to characteristic cell changes (morphology) and death. These changes\ninclude blebbing, cell shrinkage, nuclear fragmentation, chromatin condensation,\nand chromosomal DNA fragmentation. (See also apoptotic DNA fragmentation.)\n\nIn contrast to necrosis, which is a form of traumatic cell death that results\nfrom acute cellular injury, apoptosis, in general, confers advantages during an\norganism's life cycle. For example, the differentiation of fingers and toes in a\ndeveloping human embryo occurs because cells between the fingers apoptose; the\nresult is that the digits are separate. Unlike necrosis, apoptosis produces cell\nfragments called apoptotic bodies that phagocytic cells are able to engulf and\nquickly remove before the contents of the cell can spill out onto surrounding\ncells and cause damage.\n\nBetween 50 and 70 billion cells die each day due to apoptosis in the average\nhuman adult. For an average child between the ages of 8 and 14, approximately 20\nbillion to 30 billion cells die a day.\n\nResearch in and around apoptosis has increased substantially since the early\n1990s. In addition to its importance as a biological phenomenon, defective\napoptotic processes have been implicated in an extensive variety of diseases.\nExcessive apoptosis causes atrophy, whereas an insufficient amount results in\nuncontrolled cell proliferation, such as cancer.\n","linknr":1100,"url":"Apoptosis","recorded":1362484443,"links":75,"instances":["biology","biology","medical","cell_biology","number","biology"],"pdf":["http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/65/11/4909.full.pdf","http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/65/11/4909.full.pdf","http://elfosscientiae.cigb.edu.cu/PDFs/BA/2006/23/1/BA002301RV001-010.pdf","http://elfosscientiae.cigb.edu.cu/PDFs/BA/2006/23/1/BA002301RV001-010.pdf"],"categories":["Cell
