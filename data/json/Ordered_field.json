{"cursor":"9251","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In mathematics, an 'ordered field' is a field together with a total ordering of\nits elements that is compatible with the field operations. Historically, the\naxiomatization of an ordered field was abstracted gradually from the real\nnumbers, by mathematicians including David Hilbert, Otto HÃ¶lder and Hans Hahn.\nIn 1926, this grew eventually into the ArtinâSchreier theory of ordered fields\nand formally real fields.\n\nAn ordered field necessarily has characteristic 0, i.e., the elements 0, 1, , ,\nâ¦ are all different. This implies that an ordered field necessarily contains an\ninfinite number of elements. Finite fields cannot be ordered.\n\nEvery subfield of an ordered field is also an ordered field in the inherited\norder. Every ordered field contains an ordered subfield that is isomorphic to\nthe rational numbers. Any Dedekind-complete ordered field is isomorphic to the\nreal numbers. Squares are necessarily non-negative in an ordered field. This\nimplies that the complex numbers cannot be ordered since the square of the\nimaginary unit i is -1. Every ordered field is a formally real field.\n","linknr":196,"url":"Ordered_field","recorded":1362374650,"links":25,"instances":["mathematician","topology","set_theory","mathematics","algebra","mathematics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Ordered algebraic structures","Ordered groups","Real algebraic geometry"],"headings":["Definitions","Properties of ordered fields","Examples of ordered fields","Which fields can be ordered?","Topology induced by the order","Harrison topology","See also","Notes","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/math/3/1/0/310e75d3de583fd7ae3d41d68187cf04.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/c/e/2/ce20969e227be215f6f918f1ede1061e.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/1/b/a/1baa90195d306b84c8e69150ac783cfc.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/c/1/b/c1bebc961ee4b72899f406bbb699a07e.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/8/7/487cdc414e5fb27a83a1018b2b00b7a3.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/d/0/0/d00edbfeb1ba6b27cbcabf02f7311359.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["field","mathematics"],["hans_hahn","mathematician"],["characteristic","algebra"],["field","mathematics"],["characteristic","algebra"],["class","set_theory"],["set","mathematics"],["characteristic","algebra"],["continuous_function","topology"]],"members":["hans_hahn","continuous_function","class","set","characteristic","field"],"related":["Mathematics","Field_(mathematics)","Total_order","Axiomatization","Real_number","David_Hilbert","Otto_Hölder","Hans_Hahn_(mathematician)","Artin–Schreier_theory","Formally_real_field","Characteristic_(algebra)","Finite_field","Subfield","Isomorphism","Rational_number","Dedekind-complete","Complex_number","Imaginary_unit","Field_(mathematics)","Total_order","Subset","Transitive_property","Characteristic_(algebra)","Isomorphism","Rational_number","Non-Archimedean_ordered_field","Infinitesimal","Real_number","Hyperreal_numbers","Axiom_of_Archimedes","Cauchy_sequence","Rational_number","Algebraic_numbers","Computable_number","Real_number","Rational_functions","Polynomial","Formal_power_series","Real_closed_field","Superreal_number","Hyperreal_number","Surreal_numbers","Class_(set_theory)","Set_(mathematics)","Formally_real_field","Finite_field","Characteristic_(algebra)","Complex_number","P-adic_numbers","Order_topology","Continuous_function_(topology)","Topological_field","Discrete_topology","Product_topology","Subspace_topology","Boolean_space","Compact_space","Hausdorff_space","Totally_disconnected_space","Ordered_ring","Ordered_vector_space","Preorder_field"]}
