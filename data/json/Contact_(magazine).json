Chielens, Edward E., ed. \"Contact\".\nAmerican Literary Magazines: The Twentieth Century. Westport: Greenwood, 1992.\n74. Following their introduction in 1920 by Marsden Hartley at a party\nhosted by Lola Ridge, William Carlos Williams and Robert McAlmon endeavored to\ncreate an outlet for works showcasing Williams' theory of \"contact\", a theory\ncentered on the belief that art should derive from an artist's direct experience\nand sense of place and should reject traditional notions of value. Casella,\nDonna. \"William Carlos Williams's Contact Magazine: A Rebellion against the Arty\nArt Worshipers\". Ball State University Forum 28.3 (1987): 60-75. Williams\ndesired to create a distinctly American form of art free of the literary\ntradition running throughout the work of T. S. Eliot.\n\nUnder the co-editorship of Williams and McAlmon, four issues of Contact appeared\nbetween December 1920 and summer 1921, with a fifth issue appearing in June\n1923. These issues were cheaply made, contained no advertisements or tables of\ncontents, and suffered from multiple typographical errors. The first two issues\nwere printed using a mimeograph machine upon paper donated by Williams' father-in-\nlaw. Williams and McAlmon were able raise enough money to send the third issue,\ncontaining the only artwork to appear during the first run of Contact, to a\nprofessional printer, creating a noticeably superior production quality over the\nother issues in the first run. The fourth and fifth issues were printed on\nstandard white paper.\n\nAlthough it published early work from such luminaries as Hilda Doolittle,\nMarianne Moore, Wallace Stevens, Williams, McAlmon, and Mina Loy, the magazine\nwas never financially successful, and its circulation is estimated to have been\naround two hundred subscribers during the first run. Williams ended the first\nrun in 1923 with a very brief fifth issue that contained a mere five poems.\n\nWilliams revived Contact in 1932 under the name Contact: An American Quarterly\nReview. Although McAlmon was active in publishing works of Williams' circle\nthrough his own publishing company, Contact Publishing Company (a/k/a Contact\nEditions), he contributed some literary works to the revived magazine, and\nalthough he is listed as an associate editor on the masthead, McAlmon was no\nlonger involved in the production of Contact during its second run. Instead,\nWilliams chose Nathaniel West to be his partner in running the magazine. Each of\nthe three issues of Contact 's second run is approximately 130\npages in length. Advertising, mostly for books by Contact 's\ncontributors or otherwise published by Contact Editions, appear at the beginning\nof the magazine, and notably the magazine contains one of the first large\nbibliographies of contemporary little magazines. This bibliography, compiled by\nDavid Moss, was too large to publish in a single edition of Contact and\ntherefore ran over the course of all three of the 1932 issues. In addition, the\nsecond run of Contact contained chapters from West's novel Miss Lonelyhearts and\nfour poems by E. E. Cummings.\n","linknr":89,"url":"Contact_(magazine)","recorded":1363355031,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Contact_(magazine)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Contact_(magazine)&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/Magazine","#cite_note-Chielens-1","/wiki/Marsden_Hartley","/wiki/Lola_Ridge","/wiki/William_Carlos_Williams","/wiki/Robert_McAlmon","#cite_note-2","/wiki/T._S._Eliot","#cite_note-Chielens-1","/wiki/Hilda_Doolittle","/wiki/Marianne_Moore","/wiki/Wallace_Stevens","/wiki/Mina_Loy","/wiki/Nathaniel_West","/wiki/Miss_Lonelyhearts","/wiki/E._E._Cummings","/w/index.php?title=Contact_(magazine)&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Contact_(magazine)&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-Chielens_1-0","#cite_ref-Chielens_1-1","#cite_ref-2","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Contact_(magazine)&oldid=509417896","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Magazines_established_in_1920","/wiki/Category:Magazines_disestablished_in_1932","/wiki/Category:American_literary_magazines","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Contact+%28magazine%29&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Contact+%28magazine%29","/wiki/Contact_(magazine)","/wiki/Talk:Contact_(magazine)","#","/wiki/Contact_(magazine)","/w/index.php?title=Contact_(magazine)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Contact_(magazine)&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Contact_(magazine)","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Contact_(magazine)","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Contact_(magazine)&oldid=509417896","/w/index.php?title=Contact_(magazine)&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Contact_%28magazine%29&id=509417896","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Contact+%28magazine%29","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Contact+%28magazine%29&oldid=509417896&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Contact_(magazine)&printable=yes","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_(magazine)","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=skins.vector&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","/w/index.php?title=MediaWiki:Gadget-ReferenceTooltips.js&action=raw&ctype=text/javascript&508635914","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Magazines established in 1920","Magazines disestablished in 1932","American literary magazines"],"headings":["Further reading","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Magazine","Marsden_Hartley","Lola_Ridge","William_Carlos_Williams","Robert_McAlmon","T._S._Eliot","Hilda_Doolittle","Marianne_Moore","Wallace_Stevens","Mina_Loy","Nathaniel_West","Miss_Lonelyhearts","E._E._Cummings"]}
