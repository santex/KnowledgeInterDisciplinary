The Arctic consists of the Arctic Ocean and parts of Canada, Russia,\nDenmark (Greenland), Norway, the United States (Alaska), Sweden, Finland, and\nIceland. The Arctic region consists of a vast, ice-covered ocean, surrounded by\ntreeless permafrost. The area can be defined as north of the Arctic Circle (66°\n33'N), the approximate limit of the midnight sun and the polar night.\nAlternatively, it can be defined as the region where the average temperature for\nthe warmest month (July) is below ; the northernmost tree line roughly follows\nthe isotherm at the boundary of this\nregion.<ref>[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/arctic \"arctic.\"]\nDictionary.com Unabridged (v 1.1).

The Arctic region is a unique area among\nEarth's ecosystems. The cultures in the region and the Arctic indigenous peoples\nhave adapted to its cold and extreme conditions.
