George Santayana, \"The Life of Reason\", Volume\n One, p. 82, BiblioLife, ISBN 978-0-559-47806-2 |source = âGeorge\n Santayana }} 'History' (from Greek - historia, meaning \"inquiry, knowledge\n acquired by investigation\" ) is an umbrella term that\n relates to past events as well as the discovery, collection, organization, and\n presentation of information about these events. The term includes cosmic,\n geologic, and organic history, but is often generically implied to mean human\n history. Scholars who write about history are called historians.\n\nHistory can also refer to the academic discipline which uses a narrative to\nexamine and analyse a sequence of past events, and objectively determine the\npatterns of cause and effect that determine them.\n\nHistorians sometimes debate the nature of history and its usefulness by\ndiscussing the study of the discipline as an end in itself and as a way of\nproviding \"perspective\" on the problems of the present. p 52\n\nStories common to a particular culture, but not supported by external sources\n(such as the tales surrounding King Arthur) are usually classified as cultural\nheritage or legends, because they do not support the \"disinterested\ninvestigation\" required of the discipline of history. Events occurring prior to written record are considered\nprehistory.\n\nHerodotus, a 5th century B.C. Greek historian is considered to be the \"father of\nhistory\", and, along with his contemporary Thucydides, helped form the\nfoundations for the modern study of human history. Their influence has helped\nspawn variant interpretations of the nature of history which have evolved over\nthe centuries and continue to change today. The modern study of history is wide-\nranging, and includes the study of specific regions and the study of certain\ntopical or thematical elements of historical investigation. Often history is\ntaught as part of primary and secondary education, and the academic study of\nhistory is a major discipline in University studies.\n","linknr":1209,"url":"History","recorded":1362503326,"links":220,"instances":["reference_date","disambiguation","negationism","polity","disambiguation","discipline","historian","disambiguation"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Auxiliary
