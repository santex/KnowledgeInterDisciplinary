It also stands for the planet Mars and\n is the alchemical symbol for iron.]]\n\nA 'male' (♂) organism is the physiological sex which produces sperm. Each\nspermatozoon can fuse with a larger female gamete, or ovum, in the process of\nfertilization. A male cannot reproduce sexually without access to at least one\novum from a female, but some organisms can reproduce both sexually and\nasexually. Most male mammals, including male humans, have a Y chromosome, which\ncodes for the production of larger amounts of testosterone to develop male\nreproductive organs.\n\nNot all species share a common sex-determination system. In most animals,\nincluding humans, sex is determined genetically, but in some species it can be\ndetermined due to social, environmental or other factors.\n",
