{"cursor":"21242","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nIn computing, a 'hyperlink' (or 'link') is a reference to data that the reader\ncan directly follow, or that is followed automatically. A hyperlink\npoints to a whole document or to a specific element within a document. Hypertext\nis text with hyperlinks. A software system for viewing and creating hypertext is\na hypertext system, and to create a hyperlink is to hyperlink (or simply to\nlink). A user following hyperlinks is said to navigate or browse the hypertext.\n\nA hyperlink has an anchor, which is the location within a certain type of a\ndocument from which the hyperlink can be followed only from the homepage; the\ndocument containing a hyperlink is known as its 'source code' document. For\nexample, in an online reference work such as Wikipedia, many words and terms in\nthe text are hyperlinked to definitions of those terms. Hyperlinks are often\nused to implement reference mechanisms, such as tables of contents, footnotes,\nbibliographies, indexes, letters, and glossaries.\n\nIn some hypertext, hyperlinks can be bidirectional: they can be followed in two\ndirections, so both ends act as anchors and as targets. More complex\narrangements exist, such as many-to-many links.\n\nThe effect of following a hyperlink may vary with the hypertext system and may\nsometimes depend on the link itself; for instance, on the World Wide Web, most\nhyperlinks cause the target document to replace the document being displayed,\nbut some are marked to cause the target document to open in a new window.\nAnother possibility is transclusion, for which the link target is a document\nfragment that replaces the link anchor within the source document. Not only\npersons browsing the document follow hyperlinks; they may also be followed\nautomatically by programs. A program that traverses the hypertext, following\neach hyperlink and gathering all the retrieved documents is known as a Web\nspider or crawler.\n","linknr":430,"url":"Hyperlink","recorded":1362485362,"links":78,"instances":["computing","engineering","computing","computers","world_wide_web","web_browser","image","computer_science","web_browser","computing","computing","isp","mathematics","protocol","computer_system"],"pdf":["http://sex.ncu.edu.tw/animal-love/news/2004Jan-Jun/Wang.pdf","http://sex.ncu.edu.tw/animal-love/news/2004Jan-Jun/Wang.pdf","http://www.linksandlaw.com/decision-161-comcast-illinoi-hightech-elec.pdf","http://www.linksandlaw.com/decision-163-perfect-10-pictures-google.pdf"],"categories":["World Wide Web"],"headings":["Types of links","Hyperlinks in various technologies","How hyperlinks work in HTML","History of the hyperlink","Legal issues","Philosophical Implications","See also","References","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Wiki-linking.png/220px-Wiki-linking.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/SRI_ARC_Engelbart_Nov_1969.jpg/220px-SRI_ARC_Engelbart_Nov_1969.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["reference","computer_science"],["mechanism","engineering"],["preview","computing"],["cropping","image"],["skin","computing"],["graph","mathematics"],["gopher","protocol"],["cursor","computers"],["user","computing"],["plug-in","computing"],["opera","web_browser"],["framing","world_wide_web"],["nls","computer_system"],["gopher","protocol"],["mosaic","web_browser"],["prodigy","isp"]],"members":["skin","mechanism","cursor","framing","opera","cropping","reference","mosaic","preview","user","prodigy","graph","gopher","nls"],"related":["Computing","Reference_(computer_science)","Hypertext","Wikipedia","Mechanism_(engineering)","Transclusion","Web_crawler","Inline_linking","Thumbnail","Image_resolution","Preview_(computing)","Cropping_(image)","Magnification","Desktop_publishing","External_link","Page_layout","Image_map","Politics_of_Africa","Skin_(computing)","Tim_Berners-Lee","Internet","World_Wide_Web","HTML","HTML_anchor","Webgraph","Graph_(mathematics)","Web_page","W3C","Gopher_(protocol)","Wiki","E-mails","Text_editor","Portable_Document_Format","Windows_Help","Word_processing","Documents","Spreadsheets","Apple_Computer","HyperCard","Virtual_world","OpenSimulator","Open_Cobalt","Wiki","Lightweight_markup_language","Wiki_markup","Ward_Cunningham","Wiki_software","WikiWikiWeb","CamelCase","Wikipedia","TiddlyWiki","Trac","PMWiki","Wiki_software","Wiki_software","Interwiki_links","Like_this_one","Like_this_one","Inbound_link","Uniform_Resource_Locator","World_Wide_Web","Webpage","HTML_element","Fragment_identifier","Web_browser","Color","Font","Typeface","Cascading_Style_Sheets","Computer_mouse","Cursor_(computers)","Hand","User_(computing)","File_type","Plug-in_(computing)","HTML_anchor","Cascading_Style_Sheets","Web_browser","Window","Mouse_hover","Mozilla_Firefox","Internet_Explorer","Opera_(web_browser)","Status_bar","Framing_(World_Wide_Web)","Ted_Nelson","Project_Xanadu","As_We_May_Think","Vannevar_Bush","Memex","Autodesk","Douglas_Engelbart","Jeff_Rulifson","Programmer","NLS_(computer_system)","HyperCard","Gopher_(protocol)","Mosaic_(web_browser)","World_Wide_Web","Deep_linking","Home_page","Jurisdictions","Reference","Citations","Karin_Spaink","Publication","Josephine_Ho","Taiwan","British_Telecom","Prodigy_(ISP)","Litigation","Court","British_Telecom","CNET","United_States","Copyright_infringement","Dead_link","Internal_link","Methods_of_website_linking","Object_hyperlinking","PageRank","Xenu's_Link_Sleuth","Fragment_identifier"]}
