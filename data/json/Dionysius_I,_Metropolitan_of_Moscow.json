He is known to have spent a number of\nyears living in a cave that he dug out himself on the banks of the Volga River\nnot far from Nizhny Novgorod. Later, Dionysius founded the Pechersky Monastery\non that same spot, which was dedicated in honour of the Ascension of the Lord.\nIn 1374, he was consecrated the Bishop of Suzdal and won love and respect on the\npart of the locals.\n\nIn 1378, Dionysius was recommended as Metropolitan of Moscow by St. Sergius of\nRadonezh after the death of Metropolitan Alexius. However, Grand Prince Dmitri\nDonskoi had his own candidate - a priest by the name of Mikhail (Mityaya).\nDionysius was one of a number of bishops at the council who opposed Mikhail, who\nwas suspected of heresy (Strigolniki). If elected, Mikhail wanted to introduce a\nnew way of enthroning the Metropolitan at home, in Russia, rather than traveling\nto Constantinople to be installed by the Ecumenical Patriarch (at the time,\nRussia was not yet an autocephalous church). In 1379 Dionysius went to\nConstantinople carrying a protest against the choice of Mikhail addressed to the\nPatriarch. Mikhail was afraid that Dionysius would get the patriarch's blessing\nand followed him to Constantinople. However, Mikhail died on his way there and\none of his accompanying clergymen, Archmandrite Pimen, reached Constantinople\n(Slavonic: [[Tzargrad]]) before Dionysius and was named Metropolitan of Moscow\nand All Rus' in place of Mikhail.\n\nIn 1382 the Dionysius received the title of archbishop from the Patriarch, who\nwas impressed with his piety and humility. In 1383, Dionysius returned from this\nlong journey to his at Suzdal and continued his struggle against the\nStrigolniki. He also implored Dmitri Donskoi against Pimen, whom he viewed as a\nusurper, since no one in the Russian Church, not even the Great Prince himself,\nhad been consulted before Pimen was appointed Metropolitan. In 1384, Dionysius\nwas sent back to Constantinople to ask for Pimen's deposition and his own\nappointment as Metropolitan. Patriarch Neilus Kerameus was not sure whether he\ncould trust Dionysius and sent two metropolitans to Moscow, who were supposed to\ndepose Pimen and install the archbishop of Suzdal. On his way back to Moscow,\nDionysius stopped in Kiev, where he was detained by the Kievan prince Vladimir\nOlgerdovich at the insistence of Cyprian, Archbishop of Kiev, who was to have\nsucceeded as Metropolitan of Moscow in 1378 upon the death of Alexius, but who\nwas not finally welcomed into Moscow until 1390. Dionysius died in detention on\nOctober 15, 1385. He was buried in the Caves of St. Anthony at Kiev, in the\nmonastery in which he began his spiritual life.\n\nThe Russian Orthodox Church used to celebrate his feast day on July 19, but\nsubsequently this tradition died down. He is now commemorated on October 15 of\nthe traditional Julian Calendar (October 28 on the modern Gregorian Calendar),\nwhere he is listed as \"Metropolitan of Suzdal\", since he was never able to take\npossession of his Metropolitan
