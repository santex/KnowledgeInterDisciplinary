{"cursor":"2469","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Dead water' is the nautical term for a phenomenon which can occur when a layer\nof fresh or brackish water rests on top of denser salt water, without the two\nlayers mixing. A ship powered by direct thrust under the waterline (such as a\npropeller), traveling in such conditions may be hard to maneuver or can even\nslow down almost to a standstill. Much of the energy from the ship's propeller\nonly results in waves and turbulence between the two layers of water, leaving a\nship capable of traveling at perhaps as little as 20% of its normal speed.\n\nThe phenomenon was first described by Fridtjof Nansen, the Norwegian Arctic\nexplorer. Nansen wrote the following from his ship [[Fram]] in August 1893 in\nthe NordenskiÃ¶ld Archipelago near the Taymyr Peninsula:\n* \"When caught in dead water Fram appeared to be held back, as if by some\n  mysterious force, and she did not always answer the helm. In calm weather,\n  with a light cargo, Fram was capable of 6 to 7 knots. When in dead\n  water she was unable to make 1.5 knots. We made loops in our\n  course, turned sometimes right around, tried all sorts of antics to get clear\n  of it, but to very little purpose.\"\n\nThis phenomenon is observable where glacier runoff flows into salt water without\nmuch mixing, such as in fjords.\n","linknr":111,"url":"Dead_water","recorded":1362372245,"links":17,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Nautical terms","Waves"],"headings":["See also","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Freshwater","Brackish_water","Seawater","Fridtjof_Nansen","Nordenskiöld_Archipelago","Taymyr_Peninsula","Glacier","Fjord","Iceberg","Ice_drift","Internal_wave","Nansen's_Fram_expedition","Nordenskiöld_Archipelago","Polar_ice_cap","Polar_ice_packs","Polynya","Sea_ice","Shelf_ice","Vagn_Walfrid_Ekman"]}
