{"cursor":"6471","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" is valid and the associated boundary values]] In mathematics, in the field of\n differential equations, a 'boundary value problem' is a differential equation\n together with a set of additional restraints, called the 'boundary conditions'.\n A solution to a boundary value problem is a solution to the differential\n equation which also satisfies the boundary conditions.\n\nBoundary value problems arise in several branches of physics as any physical\ndifferential equation will have them. Problems involving the wave equation, such\nas the determination of normal modes, are often stated as boundary value\nproblems. A large class of important boundary value problems are the\nSturmâLiouville problems. The analysis of these problems involves the\neigenfunctions of a differential operator.\n\nTo be useful in applications, a boundary value problem should be well posed.\nThis means that given the input to the problem there exists a unique\nsolution, which depends continuously on the input. Much theoretical work in\nthe field of partial differential equations is devoted to proving that\nboundary value problems arising from scientific and engineering applications\nare in fact well-posed.\n\nAmong the earliest boundary value problems to be studied is the Dirichlet\nproblem, of finding the harmonic functions (solutions to Laplace's equation);\nthe solution was given by the Dirichlet's principle.\n","linknr":183,"url":"Boundary_value_problem","recorded":1362889628,"links":28,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Ordinary differential equations","Partial differential equations","Boundary conditions|","Mathematical problems"],"headings":["Explanation","Types of boundary value problems","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/Boundary_value_problem-en.svg/220px-Boundary_value_problem-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/7/0/0707669836d19443cf6c5cc89ca963e6.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/3/e/8/3e8f7b0adf6d7024b951f29a18225e4a.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/b/7/3/b73c3280b6f85a6ac520af103083f535.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/7/0/0707669836d19443cf6c5cc89ca963e6.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/2/a/6/2a6da40bebb98e0b96eeb9c760fef06c.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/3/e/8/3e8f7b0adf6d7024b951f29a18225e4a.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/d/8/2/d821fdbc0c42fb8575965249d786ee2b.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/b/c/0bcc6eb07326241ec09fb86e20e4f2b1.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/6/2/4624c9a3bff75f7d5aa900dbfedc3b64.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/a/4/6/a46c8fe5f5600ef3673a0d004e5a1895.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/a/8/a/a8a003502e12d9f8da7c69bf1ee0b808.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/6/3/4/6340244459d08657507d9dc503656361.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/d/0/7d03368a440dfc87daa07d1b8dd97bf8.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/c/d/0/cd0128ee00e4a5917f3e18aaacb207f6.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/6/8/768aaaaf5510814217b825ef51dc408a.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/c/3/8c37344dc11cbf1e4785be23244cbca7.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/a/3/9/a39084e15c4d7cfaace673ce4f13d3ec.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/94/Bounday_value_problem_for_a_rod.PNG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Mathematics","Differential_equation","Differential_equation","Wave_equation","Normal_mode","Sturm–Liouville_theory","Eigenfunction","Differential_operator","Well-posed_problem","Partial_differential_equation","Dirichlet_problem","Harmonic_function","Laplace's_equation","Dirichlet's_principle","Initial_value_problem","Absolute_zero","Normal_derivative","Neumann_boundary_condition","Dirichlet_boundary_condition","Cauchy_boundary_condition","Elliptic_operator","Elliptic_boundary_value_problem","Hyperbolic_operator","Hyperbolic_boundary_value_problems","Initial_value_problem","Differential_equation","Green's_function","Stochastic_processes_and_boundary_value_problems","Sturm&ndash;Liouville_theory","Dirichlet_boundary_condition","Neumann_boundary_condition","Robin_boundary_condition","Sommerfeld_radiation_condition","Cauchy_boundary_condition","Mixed_boundary_condition","Perfect_thermal_contact","Wave","Normal_mode","Electrostatics","Laplace's_equation","Potential_theory","Computation_of_radiowave_attenuation_in_the_atmosphere","Black_holes","Shooting_method","Direct_multiple_shooting_method"]}
