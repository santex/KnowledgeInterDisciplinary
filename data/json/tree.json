At its broadest, trees include the taller\npalms, the tree ferns, bananas and bamboo.\n\nA tree typically has many secondary branches supported clear of the ground by\nthe trunk. This trunk typically contains woody tissue for strength, and vascular\ntissue to carry materials from one part of the tree to another. For most trees\nit is surrounded by a layer of bark which serves as a protective barrier. Below\nthe ground, the roots branch and spread out widely; they serve to anchor the\ntree and extract moisture and nutrients from the soil. Above ground, the\nbranches divide into smaller branches and shoots. The shoots typically bear\nleaves, which capture light energy and convert it into chemical energy by\nphotosynthesis, providing the food needed by the tree for its growth and\ndevelopment.\n\nFlowers and fruit may also be present, but some trees such as conifers\ninstead have pollen cones and seed cones, and others such as tree ferns\nproduce spores instead.\n\nTrees tend to be long-lived,<ref></ref> some reaching several thousand years\nold. The tallest known specimen on Earth is 115.6&nbsp;m (379&nbsp;ft) and they\nhave a theoretical maximum height of 130&nbsp;m (426&nbsp;ft).<ref></ref> Trees\nhave been in existence on the Earth for 370 million years. Trees are not a\ntaxonomic group but are a number of plant species that have independently\nevolved a woody trunk and branches as a way to tower above other plants and make\nfull use of the sunlight.\n\nTrees play a significant role in reducing erosion and moderating the climate.\nThey remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and store large quantities of\ncarbon in their tissues. Trees and forests provide a habitat for many species of\nanimals and plants. Tropical rainforests are one of the most biodiverse habitats\nin the world. Trees provide shade and shelter, timber for construction, fuel for\ncooking and heating, and fruit for food as well as having many other uses. In\nparts of the world, forests are shrinking as trees are cleared to increase the\namount of land available for agriculture. Because of their longevity and\nusefulness, trees have always been revered and they play a role in many of the\nworld's mythologies.\n",
