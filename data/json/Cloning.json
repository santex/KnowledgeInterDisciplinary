{"cursor":"50210","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n ([[Anthopleura elegantissima]]) undergoing cloning|thumb]] In biology,\n 'cloning' is the process of producing similar populations of genetically\n identical individuals that occurs in nature when organisms such as bacteria,\n insects or plants reproduce asexually. Cloning in biotechnology refers to\n processes used to create copies of DNA fragments (molecular cloning), cells\n (cell cloning), or organisms. The term also refers to the production of\n multiple copies of a product such as digital media or software.\n\nThe term clone is derived from the Ancient Greek word [[wikt:ÎºÎ»ÏÎ½#Ancient\nGreek|ÎºÎ»ÏÎ½]] (klÅn, âtwigâ), referring to the process whereby a new plant can be\ncreated from a twig. In horticulture, the spelling clon was used until the\ntwentieth century; the final e came into use to indicate the vowel is a \"long o\"\ninstead of a \"short o\". {{Cite journal\n | title = Torrey Botanical Club: Volumes 42-45|publisher = Torrey Botanical\n | Club| year = 1942| journal = Torreya, Volumes 42-45| page = 133 postscript =\n | }} Since the term entered the popular lexicon in a\n | more general context, the spelling clone has been used exclusively.\n\nIn botany, the term 'lusus' was traditionally used.\n\nIn the United States, the human consumption of meat and other products from\ncloned animals was approved by the FDA on December 28, 2006, with no special\nlabeling required. Such practice has met strong resistance in other regions,\nsuch as Europe, particularly over the labeling issue.\n","linknr":697,"url":"Cloning","recorded":1362569905,"links":85,"instances":["cat","australia","biology","sheep","cell_biology","monkey","cat","united_states","cloned_rat","biology","botany","star_wars","biology","molecular_biology"],"pdf":["http://submit.biolcell.org/boc/097/0119/0970119.pdf","http://submit.biolcell.org/boc/097/0119/0970119.pdf","http://www.micatholicconference.org/pdf/focus/focus_200502-StemCells.pdf","http://www.centerforfoodsafety.org/pubs/FINAL_FORMATTEDprime%20time.pdf","http://www.centerforfoodsafety.org/pubs/FINAL_FORMATTEDprime%20time.pdf","http://www.consumersunion.org/pdf/FDA_clone_comments.pdf","http://www.consumersunion.org/pdf/FDA_clone_comments.pdf","http://www.csustan.edu/honors/documents/journals/thresholds/Delacruz.pdf","http://www.csustan.edu/honors/documents/journals/thresholds/Delacruz.pdf"],"categories":["Cloning|","Molecular
