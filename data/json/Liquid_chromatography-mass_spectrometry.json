LC-MS is a powerful technique used for many applications which has\nvery high sensitivity and selectivity. Generally its application is oriented\ntowards the general detection and potential identification of chemicals in the\npresence of other chemicals (in a complex mixture). Preparative LC-MS system can\nbe used for fast and mass directed purification of natural-products extracts and\nnew molecular entities important to food, pharmaceutical, agrochemical and other\nindustries. The limitations of LC-MS in urine analysis drug screening is that it\noften fails to distinguish between specific metabolites, in particular with\nhydrocodone and its metabolites. LC-MS urine analysis testing is used to detect\nspecific categories of drugs. However, gas chromatography (GC-MS) should be used\nwhen detection of a specific drug and its metabolites is required.\n","linknr":274,"url":"Liquid_chromatography-mass_spectrometry","recorded":1362484518,"links":18,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Chromatography","Mass spectrometry"],"headings":["Liquid chromatography","Mass spectrometry","Applications","See also","References","Bibliography"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Chromatography","Mass_spectrometry","Organic_molecule","Biomolecule","Agilent","Bruker","MDS_Inc.","PerkinElmer","Shimadzu_Scientific","Thermo_Fisher_Scientific","Varian,_Inc.","Waters_Corporation","Gas_chromatography–mass_spectrometry","High_performance_liquid_chromatography","HPLC","Mass_spectrometry","Gas_chromatography–mass_spectrometry","Quadrupole_mass_analyzer","Triple_quadrupole_mass_spectrometer","Ion_Trap","Time-of-flight_mass_spectrometry","Electrospray_ionization","Electrospray","Atmospheric_pressure_chemical_ionization","Matrix-assisted_laser_desorption/ionization","Direct-EI_LC-MS_interface","Pharmacokinetic","Bioanalysis","Tandem_mass_spectrometry","Proteomics","Bottom-up_proteomics","Trypsin","Peptide_mass_fingerprinting","Tandem_mass_spectrometry","Natural_phenol","Bioanalysis","Gas_chromatography–mass_spectrometry","Capillary_electrophoresis–mass_spectrometry","Ion-mobility_spectrometry–mass_spectrometry"]}
