The amide group\nof glutamate is a nitrogen source for the synthesis of glutamine pathway\nmetabolites.\n\nOther reactions may take place via GS. Competition between ammonium ion and\nwater, their binding affinities, and the concentration of ammonium ion,\ninfluences glutamine synthesis and glutamine hydrolysis. Glutamine is formed if\nan ammonium ion attacks the acyl-phosphate intermediate, while glutamate is\nremade if water attacks the intermediate. Ammonium ion binds more strongly than water to GS due\nto electrostatic forces between a cation and a negatively charged pocket. Another possible reaction is upon NH 2OH binding\nto GS, rather than NH 4+, yields Î³-glutamylhydroxamate.\n","linknr":873,"url":"Glutamine_synthetase","recorded":1362371345,"links":29,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["EC 6.3.1|2"],"headings":["Structure","Mechanism","Biological Function","Classes","Regulation & Inhibition","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/69/MN_MN_ADP_PPQ.png/220px-MN_MN_ADP_PPQ.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/30/PDB_2gls_EBI.jpg/220px-PDB_2gls_EBI.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/da/GS_reacction.PNG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c5/Gs1.png/220px-Gs1.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/Adenylylated_Unadenylylated_GS.PNG/220px-Adenylylated_Unadenylylated_GS.PNG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7f/Methionine_Sulfoximine.PNG/220px-Methionine_Sulfoximine.PNG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Adenosine_diphosphate","DL-Phosphinothricin","Enzyme","Metabolism","Nitrogen","Glutamate","Ammonia","Glutamine","Adenosine_triphosphate","Adenosine_diphosphate","Amino_acid","Photorespiration","Metabolites","Ammonium","Monomer","Nucleotide","Cations","Hydrogen_bonding","Hydrophobic","Neurotransmitters","Astrocytes","Prokaryote","Protein_subunit","Tyrosine","Eukaryotes","Rhizobiaceae","Frankiaceae","Streptomycetaceae","Decamer","Chloroplast","Tyrosine","Adenylylation","Phosphinothricin"]}
