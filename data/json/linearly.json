If f is assumed to be continuous as well then this can be extended to\nshow that homogeneity for α any real number, using the fact that rationals form\na dense subset of the reals.\n\nIn this definition, x is not necessarily a real number, but can in general be a\nmember of any vector space. A more specific definition of linear function, not\ncoinciding with the definition of linear map, is used in elementary mathematics.\n\nThe concept of linearity can be extended to linear operators. Important examples\nof linear operators include the derivative considered as a differential\noperator, and many constructed from it, such as del and the Laplacian. When a\ndifferential equation can be expressed in linear form, it is particularly easy\nto solve by breaking the equation up into smaller pieces, solving each of those\npieces, and summing the solutions.\n\nLinear algebra is the branch of mathematics concerned with the study of vectors,\nvector spaces (also called linear spaces), linear transformations (also called\nlinear maps), and systems of linear equations.\n\nThe word 'linear' comes from the Latin word linearis, which means pertaining to\nor resembling a line. For a description of linear and nonlinear equations, see\n[[linear equation]]. Nonlinear equations and functions are of interest to\nphysicists and mathematicians because they can be used to represent many natural\nphenomena, including chaos.\n","title":"Linearity","headings":["Integral linearity","Linear polynomials","Boolean functions","Physics","Electronics","Military tactical formations","Art","Music","Measurement","See also","References"]},"micro-relation":["2: Linear_map","2: Linear_function","2: Differential_equation","2: Latin","1: Mathematics","1: Additive_function","1: Superposition_principle","1: Homogeneous_function","1: Rational_number","1: Mathematical_induction","1: Real_number","1: Vector_space","1: Derivative","1: Differential_operator","1: Del","1: Laplacian","1: Linear_algebra","1: Nonlinear","1: Physicist","1: Mathematician","1: Chaos_theory","1: Full_scale","1: Multimeter","1: Analog-to-digital_converter","1: Potentiometer","1: Digital-to-analog_converter","1: Polynomial","1: Graph_of_a_function","1: Linear_equation","1: Slope","1: Gradient","1: Y-intercept","1: If_and_only_if","1: Affine_transformation","1: Truth_table","1: Truth_value","1: Truth-value","1: Negation","1: Logical_biconditional","1: Exclusive_or","1: Contradiction","1: Physics","1: Differential_equations","1: Maxwell_equations","1: Diffusion_equation","1: Linear_combination","1: Electronics","1: Transistor","1: Dependent_variable","1: Electric_current","1: Independent_variable","1: High_fidelity","1: Audio_amplifier","1: Linear_filter","1: Linear_regulator","1: Linear_amplifier","1: Science","1: Technology","1: Transfer_function","1: Heinrich_Wölfflin","1: Renaissance_art","1: Baroque","1: Leonardo_da_Vinci","1: Raphael","1: Albrecht_Dürer","1: Painterly","1: Peter_Paul_Rubens","1: Rembrandt","1: Diego_Velázquez","1: Shape","1: Digital_art","1: Hypertext_fiction","1: Nonlinear_narrative","1: Melodic","1: Linear_actuator","1: Linear_element","1: Linear_system","1: Linear_medium","1: Linear_programming","1: Linear_differential_equation","1: Bilinear","1: Multilinear","1: Linear_motor","1: Linear_A","1: Linear_B","1: Linear_interpolation"]}
