Myofibril\n]] A 'myocyte' (also known as a 'muscle cell' or 'muscle fiber') is\nthe type of cell found in muscle tissue. They are long, tubular cells that arise\ndevelopmentally from 'myoblasts' to form muscles. There are various\nspecialized forms of myocytes: cardiac, skeletal, and smooth muscle cells, with\nvarious properties. Cardiac myocytes are responsible for generating the\nelectrical impulses that control the heart rate, among other things.\n","linknr":451,"url":"Muscle_fiber","recorded":1362902562,"links":32,"instances":["biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Contractile cells","Animal cells","Non-terminally differentiated (blast) cells","Myoblasts|*"],"headings":["Terminology","Myofibrils","Functional control","Myoblasts","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/Synapse_diag3.png/220px-Synapse_diag3.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/Sarcomere.jpg/220px-Sarcomere.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cell","biology"]],"members":["cell"],"related":["Neuromuscular_junction","Myofibril","Cell_(biology)","Muscle_tissue","Muscle","Cardiac_muscle","Skeletal_muscle","Smooth_muscle","Heart","Cell_biology","Cytoplasm","Smooth_endoplasmic_reticulum","Mitochondrion","Cell_membrane","Plasma_membrane","Sarcomere","Myofibrils","Sarcomeres","Biceps_brachii_muscle","Smooth_muscle","Actin","Myosin","Endomysium","Perimysium","Muscle_fascicle","Muscle_tissue","Epimysium","Muscle_spindle","Central_nervous_system","Kindlin-2","GATA4","GATA6","Progenitor_cell","Cellular_differentiation","Skeletal_striated_muscle","Cardiac_muscle","Smooth_muscle","Cellular_differentiation","Satellite_cell","Endomysium","Sinoatrial_node"]}
