{"cursor":"1408","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In mycology 'trama' is a term for the inner, fleshy portion of a mushroom's\nbasidiocarp, or fruit body. It is distinct from the outer layer of tissue, known\nas the pileipellis or cuticle, and from the spore-bearing tissue layer known as\nthe hymenium.\n\nIn essence the trama is the tissue we call the \"flesh\" of mushrooms and similar\nfungi.

ISBN\n0-916422-09-7. pp. 60â70.\n\nLiterally \"trama\" is the Latin word for the \"weft\" or \"woof\" yarns in the\nweaving of cloth. This probably is related\nto the fact that in the basidiocarp trama is \"filler\" tissue and that\nanalogously the woof yarn in weaving is sometimes called \"fill\". What is more,\nthe trama tends to be soft tissue, and in weaving, the woof yarn is not tightly\nstretched; it therefore need not as a rule be as strong as the warp yarn.\n","linknr":109,"url":"Trama_(mycology)","recorded":1362553742,"links":25,"instances":["weaving"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Mycology","Fungal morphology and anatomy"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/InocybeAsterospora.JPG/16px-InocybeAsterospora.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["warp","weaving"]],"members":["warp"],"related":["Mycology","Mushroom","Basidiocarp","Pileipellis","Cuticle","Spore","Hymenium","Latin","Weft","Weft","Weft","Warp_(weaving)"]}
