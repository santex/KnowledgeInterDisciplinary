{"cursor":"3401","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n'Thomas Ford' (ca. 1580buried 17 November 1648) was an English composer,\nlutenist, viol player and poet.\n\nHe was attached to the court of Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales, son of James\nI, who died in 1612. He was musician to the household of Prince Henry from 1610\nto 1612, musician to the household of Prince Charles 1617 to 1625, and musician\nto Charles I from 1626 to 1642, the outbreak of the English Civil War. His will\nwas made on 12 November 1648 and he was buried in St. Margaret's, Westminster on\n17 November, but it is not known exactly when he died. Grove's\nDictionary of Music and Musicians, 5th ed (1954), Vol. III, p. 427\n\nFord wrote anthems, for three to six voices; four sacred canons; 35 partsongs;\nsix fantasias for five parts; and a few other pieces for viols.\n\nHis most important collection was probably the Musicke of Sundrie Kindes\n(London, 1607), which was in two parts. The first book included lute ayres,\ndescribed as \"Aries for 4 voices to the Lute, Orphorion, or Basse-viol, with a\nDialogue for two Voices...\"; the second part contained dances such as \"Pavens,\nGaliards, Almaines, Toies, Jigges, Thumpes, and such like...\" scored for\ncombinations of viols. Many of the ayres are given in two versions: one for\nvoice or voices and lute, and another for four equal voices. An unusual feature\nof his music for viol is the occasional use of a sound effect: a heavy pizzicato\n\"thump...with the first and second finger of the left hand according to the\ndirection of the pricks.\" One of the songs from this collection, \"Since first I\nsaw your face\", was set by Roger Quilter in 1942 for the [[Arnold Book of Old\nSongs]].\n\nSome of his sacred music, found in two collections from 1614 and 1620, is\nunusual in including a basso continuo, a plainly Baroque feature which, though\ncommon on the continent by then, only made a belated appearance in England.\n\nTogether with John Dowland, Ford is a chief representative of the school which\npreceded Henry Lawes.\n","linknr":132,"url":"Thomas_Ford_(composer)","recorded":1375059331,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Thomas_Ford_(composer)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Thomas_Ford_(composer)&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Thomas_Ford_(disambiguation)","/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Thomas_Ford_(composer)&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/Composer","/wiki/Lutenist","/wiki/Viol","/wiki/Henry_Frederick,_Prince_of_Wales","/wiki/James_I_of_England","/wiki/Charles_I_of_England","/wiki/English_Civil_War","/wiki/Westminster","#cite_note-grove-1","/wiki/Fantasia_(music)","/wiki/Air_(music)","/wiki/Pizzicato","/wiki/Roger_Quilter","/wiki/Arnold_Book_of_Old_Songs","#cite_note-grove-1","/wiki/Basso_continuo","/wiki/Baroque_music","/wiki/John_Dowland","/wiki/Henry_Lawes","/w/index.php?title=Thomas_Ford_(composer)&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-grove_1-0","#cite_ref-grove_1-1","/w/index.php?title=Thomas_Ford_(composer)&action=edit&section=2","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/38px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png","/wiki/Wikisource","/wiki/Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica_Eleventh_Edition","//en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Ford,_Thomas","http://www.cpdl.org/wiki/index.php/Thomas_Ford","/wiki/Choral_Public_Domain_Library","http://imslp.org/wiki/Category:Ford,_Thomas","/wiki/International_Music_Score_Library_Project","/wiki/Christchurch,_Oxford","/wiki/Majesty","/wiki/Authority_control","http://www.worldcat.org/identities/lccn-n86-862159","/wiki/Library_of_Congress_Control_Number","http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n86862159","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Thomas_Ford_(composer)&oldid=542490033","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1580s_births","/wiki/Category:1648_deaths","/wiki/Category:Renaissance_composers","/wiki/Category:English_composers","/wiki/Category:Baroque_composers","/wiki/Category:English_poets","/wiki/Category:English_viol_players","/wiki/Category:People_of_the_Tudor_period","/wiki/Category:16th-century_English_people","/wiki/Category:17th-century_English_people","/wiki/Category:17th-century_poets","/wiki/Category:17th-century_musicians","/wiki/Category:People_of_the_Stuart_period","/wiki/Category:Articles_lacking_sources_from_June_2010","/wiki/Category:All_articles_lacking_sources","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_LCCN_identifiers","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Thomas+Ford+%28composer%29&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Thomas+Ford+%28composer%29","/wiki/Thomas_Ford_(composer)","/wiki/Talk:Thomas_Ford_(composer)","#","/wiki/Thomas_Ford_(composer)","/w/index.php?title=Thomas_Ford_(composer)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Thomas_Ford_(composer)&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Thomas_Ford_(composer)","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Thomas_Ford_(composer)","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Thomas_Ford_(composer)&oldid=542490033","/w/index.php?title=Thomas_Ford_(composer)&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q354266","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Thomas_Ford_%28composer%29&id=542490033","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Thomas+Ford+%28composer%29","/w/index.php?title=Special:Boo
