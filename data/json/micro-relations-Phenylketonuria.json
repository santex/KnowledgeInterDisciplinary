This\nenzyme is necessary to metabolize the amino acid phenylalanine (Phe) to the\namino acid tyrosine. When PAH activity is reduced, phenylalanine accumulates and\nis converted into phenylpyruvate (also known as phenylketone), which is detected\nin the urine.\n\nUntreated PKU can lead to mental retardation, seizures, and other serious\nmedical problems. The mainstream treatment for classic PKU patients\nis a strict PHE-restricted diet supplemented by a medical formula containing\namino acids and other nutrients. In the United States, the current\nrecommendation is that the PKU diet should be maintained for life. [http://www.nichd.nih.gov/publications/pubs/pku/sub3.cfm\n] Patients who are diagnosed early and maintain a strict diet can have a\nnormal life span with normal mental development. However, recent research\nsuggests that neurocognitive, psychosocial, quality of life, growth, nutrition,\nbone pathology are slightly suboptimal if diet is not supplemented with amino\nacids.\n","linknr":609,"url":"Phenylketonuria","recorded":1362511153,"links":49,"instances":["biochemistry","genetics","food","fruit","epidemiology","human","food"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Mental retardation","Autosomal recessive disorders","Amino acid metabolism disorders","Skin conditions resulting from errors in metabolism","Health issues in pregnancy"],"headings":["History","Screening and presentation","Pathophysiology","Metabolic pathways","Treatment","Maternal phenylketonuria","Incidence","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/16/Phenylketonuria_testing.jpg/220px-Phenylketonuria_testing.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/Autorecessive.svg/250px-Autorecessive.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["dominance","genetics"],["chromosome_12","human"],["dominance","genetics"],["cofactor","biochemistry"],["chicken","food"],["egg","food"],["nut","fruit"],["incidence","epidemiology"]],"members":["cofactor","dominance","chicken","nut","incidence","chromosome_12","egg"],"related":["Phenylalanine","Dominance_(genetics)","Genetic_disorder","Phenylalanine_hydroxylase","Phenylalanine","Tyrosine","Phenylpyruvate","Urine","Mental_retardation","Seizure","Norwegian_people","Ivar_Asbjørn_Følling","Benzaldehyde","Benzoic_acid","Benzene","Melting_point","Phenylpyruvic_acid","Amyloid","Newborn_screening","Guthrie_test","Tandem_mass_spectrometry","Tyrosine","Neonatal_heel_prick","Seizure","Albinism","Phenylacetic_acid","Microcephaly","Hyperactivity","Electroencephalography","Learning_disability","Hypopigmentation","Eczema","Enzyme","Phenylalanine_hydroxylase","Genetic_heterogeneity","Chromosome_12_(human)","Dominance_(genetics)","Allele","Macaque","Cofactor_(biochemistry)","Tetrahydrobiopterin","Coenzyme","Biopterin","Dopamine","Tetrahydrobiopterin","Tyrosine","L-DOPA","Tyrosine_hydroxylase","Dopamine","Prolactin","Tetrahydrobiopterin_deficiency","Phenylalanine_hydroxylase","Amino_acid","Phenylalanine","Tyrosine","Transaminase","Glutamic_acid","Phenylacetic_acid","Phenylpyruvate","Phenethylamine","Blood–brain_barrier","CD98","Human_brain","Mental_retardation","Optimal_health_ranges","Molar_concentration","Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder","Meat","Chicken_(food)","Fish_as_food","Egg_(food)","Nut_(fruit)","Cheese","Legume","Milk","Potato","Bread","Pasta","Maize","Aspartame","Tetrahydrobiopterin","Oxidation","Blood","BioMarin_Pharmaceutical","Gene_therapy","Incidence_(epidemiology)","China","Finland","Ireland","Japan","Korea","Norway","Turkey","India","United_States","Hyperphenylalanemia","Lofenalac","Tetrahydrobiopterin_deficiency"]}
