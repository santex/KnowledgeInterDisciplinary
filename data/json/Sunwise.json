{"cursor":"4280","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In Scottish folklore, 'Sunwise' or 'Sunward' was considered the âprosperous\ncourseâ, turning from east to west in the direction of the sun. The opposite\ncourse was known in Scotland as [[widdershins]] (Lowland Scots), or tuathal\n(Scottish Gaelic, lit. northerly), and would have been counterclockwise. It is\nperhaps no coincidence that, in the Northern Hemisphere, \"sunwise\" and\n\"clockwise\" run in the same direction. This is probably because of the use of\nthe sun as a timekeeper on sundials etc., whose features were in turn\ntransferred to clock faces themselves. Another influence may also have been the\nright-handed bias in many human cultures.\n\nThis is descriptive of the ceremony observed by the druids, of walking round\ntheir temples by the south, in the course of their directions, always keeping\ntheir temples on their right. This course (deiseal) was deemed propitious, the\ncontrary course, tuathal, fatal, or at least, unpropitious. From this ancient\nsuperstition are derived several Gaelic customs which were still observed around\nthe turn of the twentieth century, such as drinking over the left thumb, as\nToland expresses it, or according to the course of the sun. Wicca uses the\nspelling deosil, which, however, violates a Gaelic orthography principle.\n\nMartin says:\n\n: âSome of the poorer sort of people in the Western Isles retain the custom of\n: performing these circles sunwise about the persons of their benefactors three\n: times, when they bless them, and wish good success to all their enterprises.\n: Some are very careful when they set out to sea, that the boat be first rowed\n: sunwise, and if this be neglected, they are afraid their voyage may prove\n: unfortunate. I had this ceremony paid me when in Islay by a poor woman, after\n: I had given her an alms. I desired her to let alone that compliment, for that\n: I did not care for it; but she insisted to make these three ordinary turns,\n: and then prayed that God and MacCharmaig, the patron saint of the island,\n: might bless and prosper me in all my affairs. When a Gael goes to drink out of\n: a consecrated fountain, he approaches it by going round the place from east to\n: west, and at funerals, the procession observes the same direction in drawing\n: near the grave. Hence also is derived the old custom of describing sunwise a\n: circle, with a burning brand, about houses, cattle, corn and corn-fields, to\n: prevent their being burnt or in any way injured by evil spirits, or by\n: witchcraft. The fiery circle was also made around women, as soon as possible\n: after parturition, and also around newly-born babes. These circles were, in\n: later times, described by midwives, and were described effectual against the\n: intrusion of âdaoine-sÃ¬thâ or âsÃ¬thicheanâ, who were particularly on the alert\n: in times of childhood, and not infrequently carried infants away, according to\n: vulgar legends, and restored them afterwards, but sadly altered in features\n: and personal appearance. Infants stolen by fairies are said to have voracious\n: appetites, constantly craving for food. In this case it was usual for those\n: who believed their children had been taken away, to dig a grave in the fields\n: on quarter-day and there to lay the fairy skeleton till next morning, at which\n: time the parents went to the place, where they doubted not to find their own\n: child in place of the skeleton.â\n\nThis distinction is also common in traditional Tibetan religion. Tibetan\nBuddhists go round their shrines sunwise, but followers of Bonpo go widdershins.\nThe former consider Bonpo to be merely a perversion of their practice, but as\nBonpo adherents claim that their religion as the indigenous one of Tibet was\ndoing this prior to the arrival of Buddhism in the country.\n\nThe Hindu pradakshina - the auspicious circumambulation of a temple, is also\nmade clockwise.\n\nA similar preference may inform the left-hand drive found in England, India, and\nJapan. Any temple or shrine in the middle of a road must be passed to its left.\n","linknr":96,"url":"Sunwise","recorded":1371235696,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Sunwise&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Sunwise&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Sun","/wiki/Scotland","/wiki/Widdershins","/wiki/Lowland_Scots","/wiki/Scottish_Gaelic","/wiki/Counterclockwise","/wiki/Sundial","/wiki/Druid","/wiki/Gaels","/wiki/Wicca","/wiki/Martin_Martin","/wiki/Western_Isles","/wiki/Islay","/wiki/Alms","/wiki/Wheat","/wiki/Tibet","/wiki/Tibetan_Buddhist","/wiki/Bonpo","/wiki/Tibet","/wiki/Buddhism","/wiki/Pradakshina","/w/index.php?title=Sunwise&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Edward_Dwelly","/w/index.php?title=Sunwise&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Circumambulation","/wiki/Clockwise_and_counterclockwise","/wiki/Widdershins","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sunwise&oldid=553056934","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Scottish_folklore","/wiki/Category:Tibet","/wiki/Category:Orientation","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_incorporating_text_from_Dwelly%27s_Gaelic_Dictionary","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Sunwise&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Sunwise","/wiki/Sunwise","/wiki/Talk:Sunwise","#","/wiki/Sunwise","/w/index.php?title=Sunwise&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Sunwise&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf5/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Sunwise","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Sunwise","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Sunwise&oldid=553056934","/w/index.php?title=Sunwise&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Sunwise&id=553056934","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Sunwise","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Sunwise&oldid=553056934&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Sunwise&printable=yes","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7641749#sitelinks","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunwise","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf5/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","/w/index.php?title=MediaWiki:Gadget-ReferenceTooltips.js&action=raw&ctype=text/javascript&508635914","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Scottish folklore","Tibet","Orientation"],"headings":["Sources","See also"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf5/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf5/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Sun","Scotland","Lowland_Scots","Scottish_Gaelic","Counterclockwise","Sundial","Druid","Gaels","Wicca","Martin_Martin","Western_Isles","Islay","Alms","Wheat","Tibet","Tibetan_Buddhist","Bonpo","Tibet","Buddhism","Pradakshina","Circumambulation","Clockwise_and_counterclockwise","Widdershins"]}
