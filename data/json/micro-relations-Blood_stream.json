Plasma, which constitutes 55% of blood fluid, is mostly water (92% by\nvolume), {{cite web\n| url = http://www.fi.edu/learn/heart/blood/blood.html title = Blood â The Human\n| Heart accessdate =19 March 2009 author = The Franklin Institute Inc.\n}}  and contains dissipated proteins, glucose, mineral ions, hormones,\ncarbon dioxide (plasma being the main medium for excretory product\ntransportation), and blood cells themselves. Albumin is the main protein in\nplasma, and it functions to regulate the colloidal osmotic pressure of blood.\nThe blood cells are mainly red blood cells (also called RBCs or erythrocytes)\nand white blood cells, including leukocytes and platelets. The most abundant\ncells in vertebrate blood are red blood cells. These contain hemoglobin, an iron-\ncontaining protein, which facilitates transportation of oxygen by reversibly\nbinding to this respiratory gas and greatly increasing its solubility in blood.\nIn contrast, carbon dioxide is almost entirely transported extracellularly\ndissolved in plasma as bicarbonate ion.\n\nVertebrate blood is bright red when its hemoglobin is oxygenated. Some animals,\nsuch as crustaceans and mollusks, use hemocyanin to carry oxygen, instead of\nhemoglobin. Insects and some mollusks use a fluid called hemolymph instead of\nblood, the difference being that hemolymph is not contained in a closed\ncirculatory system. In most insects, this \"blood\" does not contain oxygen-\ncarrying molecules such as hemoglobin because their bodies are small enough for\ntheir tracheal system to suffice for supplying oxygen.\n\nJawed vertebrates have an adaptive immune system, based largely on white blood\ncells. White blood cells help to resist infections and parasites. Platelets are\nimportant in the clotting of blood. Arthropods, using hemolymph, have hemocytes\nas part of their immune system.\n\nBlood is circulated around the body through blood vessels by the pumping action\nof the heart. In animals with lungs, arterial blood carries oxygen from inhaled\nair to the tissues of the body, and venous blood carries carbon dioxide, a\nwaste product of metabolism produced by cells, from the tissues to the lungs to\nbe exhaled.\n\nMedical terms related to blood often begin with 'hemo-' or 'hemato-' (also\nspelled 'haemo-' and 'haemato-') from the Greek word (haima) for \"blood\". In\nterms of anatomy and histology, blood is considered a specialized form of\nconnective tissue, given its origin in the bones and the presence of potential\nmolecular fibers in the form of fibrinogen.\n","linknr":1271,"url":"Blood_stream","recorded":1362552135,"links":175,"instances":["food","circulatory","biology","heart","medicine","food","nutrition","biology","heart"],"pdf":["http://www.edwards.com/SiteCollectionImages/edwards/products/presep/ar04313hemodynpocketcard.pdf","http://www.imt.liu.se/edu/courses/TBMT36/pdf/blue.pdf","http://www.imt.liu.se/edu/courses/TBMT36/pdf/blue.pdf"],"categories":["Blood|","Hematology","Tissues"],"headings":["Functions","Constituents
