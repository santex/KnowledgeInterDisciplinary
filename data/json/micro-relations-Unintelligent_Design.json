{"cursor":"25612","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nThe '[[Dysteleology|dysteleological]] argument' or 'argument from poor design'\nis an argument against the existence of God, specifically against the existence\nof a creator God (in the sense of a God that directly created all species of\nlife). It is based on the following chain of reasoning:\n\n# An omnipotent, omniscient, omnibenevolent creator God would create organisms\n# that have optimal design. Organisms have features that are sub-optimal.\n# Therefore, God either did not create these organisms or is not omnipotent,\n# omniscient, and omnibenevolent.\n\nThe argument is structured as a basic Modus tollens: if \"creation\" contains many\ndefects, then design is not a plausible theory for the origin of our existence.\nIt is most commonly used in a weaker way, however: not with the aim of\ndisproving the existence of God, but rather as a reductio ad absurdum of the well-\nknown argument from design, which runs as follows:\n\n# Living things are too well-designed to have originated by chance. Therefore,\n# life must have been created by an intelligent creator. This creator is God.\n\nThe complete phrase \"argument from poor design\" has rarely been used in the\nliterature, but arguments of this type have appeared many times, sometimes\nreferring to poor design, in other cases to suboptimal design, unintelligent\ndesign, or [[dysteleology]]; the last is a term applied by the nineteenth-\ncentury biologist Ernst Haeckel to the implications of organs so rudimentary as\nto be useless to the life of an organism (,\np. 331). Haeckel, in his book The History of Creation, devoted most of a\nchapter to the argument, and ended by proposing, perhaps with tongue slightly in\ncheek, to set up \"a theory of the unsuitability of parts in organisms, as a counter-\nhypothesis to the old popular doctrine of the suitability of parts\" (, p. 331). The term incompetent design has been coined by\nDonald Wise of the University of Massachusetts Amherst to describe aspects of\nnature that are currently flawed in design. The name stems from the acronym I.D.\nand is used to counterbalance arguments for intelligent design.\n","linknr":940,"url":"Unintelligent_Design","recorded":1362567414,"links":33,"instances":["physiology","vision","religion","genus"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Arguments against the existence of God|Poor design, argument from","Criticism of creationism","Criticism of intelligent design","Evolution and religion"],"headings":["Overview","Examples","Criticism","Responses to criticism","As an argument regarding God","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/Unbalanced_scales.svg/45px-Unbalanced_scales.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/ba/Ephesians_2%2C12_-_Greek_atheos.jpg/200px-Ephesians_2%2C12_-_Greek_atheos.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d0/Atheism_template.svg/16px-Atheism_template.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/67/Fitness-landscape-cartoon.png/220px-Fitness-landscape-cartoon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9f/Ectopic.png/250px-Ectopic.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["respiration","physiology"],["blind_spot","vision"],["hydra","genus"],["fall","religion"]],"members":["respiration","blind_spot","fall","hydra"],"related":["Argument_against_the_existence_of_God","Creator_God","Omnipotence","Omniscience","Omnibenevolence","God","Creation_myth","Organism","Design","Argument","Modus_tollens","Reductio_ad_absurdum","Teleological_argument","Ernst_Haeckel","Donald_Wise","University_of_Massachusetts_Amherst","Intelligent_design","Scientific_theory","Evolution","Natural_selection","Heredity","Fitness_landscape","Charles_Darwin","Charles_Darwin","Stephen_Jay_Gould","Richard_Dawkins","Theistic_evolutionists","Evolutionary_flaw","Reproductive_system","Ectopic_pregnancy","Watchmaker_analogy","Zygote","Fallopian_tube","Cervix","Ovary","Uterus","Ectopic_pregnancy","Vagina","Human_pelvis","Baby","Caesarean_section","Breech_birth","Testes","Abdomen","Scrotum","Hernia","Gangrene","Plantaris_muscle","Scoliosis","Sciatica","Vitamin_C","L-gulonolactone_oxidase","Scurvy","Primate","Guinea_pig","Africa","Locust","Nerve","Orchid","Panda","Thumb","Recurrent_laryngeal_nerve","Aortic_arch","Giraffe","Congenital_disease","Huntington's_Disease","Teeth","Paranasal_sinus","Primates","Wisdom_teeth","Pharynx","Ingestion","Respiration_(physiology)","Choking","Human_eye","Mammal","Retina","Invertebrate","Blind_spot_(vision)","Tetrachromacy","RuBisCO","Enzyme_inhibitor","Competitive_inhibition","Carbon_fixation","Nitrogenase","Acetylene","Bacteria","Archaea","Oxygen","Asphyxiation","Vestigial","Turritopsis_nutricula","Hydra_(genus)","Biological_immortality","Supernormal_stimuli","Moth","Orgasm","Clitoris","Sexual_intercourse","Book_of_Job","Trade-off","Intelligent_design","William_Dembski","Veriform_appendix","Plantaris","Pseudogenes","Photosynthetic_efficiency","C3_carbon_fixation","C4_carbon_fixation","Crassulacean_acid_metabolism","Reactive_Oxygen_Species","Light-harvesting_complex","Argument_against_the_existence_of_God","God","Engineer","Artist","Artistic_license","Vermiform_appendix","Coccyx","Cancer","Problem_of_Evil","Francis_Collins","False_dilemma","Unfalsifiability","Fall_(religion)","Book_of_Genesis","Eve","Atavism","Vestigiality","Maladaptation","Human_vestigiality","Richard_Dawkins","Stephen_Jay_Gould","Mark_Perakh","John_Woodmorappe"]}
