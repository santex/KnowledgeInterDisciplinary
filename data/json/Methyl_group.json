The group is often abbreviated\n'Me'. Such hydrocarbon groups occur in many organic compounds. While the methyl\ngroup is usually part of a larger molecule, it can be found on its own in either\nof three forms: anion, cation or radical. The anion has eight valence electrons,\nthe radical seven and the cation six. All three forms are highly reactive and\nrarely observed. March, J. Advanced Organic Chemistry. 4th Ed. J.
