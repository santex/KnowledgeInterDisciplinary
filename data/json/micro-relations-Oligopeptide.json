{"cursor":"3730","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nAn 'oligopeptide' (oligo-, \"few\") consists of between 2 and 20 amino acids and\nincludes dipeptides, tripeptides, tetrapeptides, pentapeptides, etc.\n\nExamples of oligopeptides include:\n\n* Amanitins - Cyclic peptides taken from carpophores of several different\n  mushroom species. They are potent inhibitors of RNA polymerases in most\n  eukaryotic species, the prevent the production of mRNA and protein synthesis.\n  These peptides are important in the study of transcription. Alpha-amanitin is\n  the main toxin from the species [[Amanita phalloides]], poisonous if ingested\n  by humans or animals.\n* Antipain - An oligopeptide produced by various bacteria which acts as a\n  protease inhibitor.\n* Ceruletide - A specific decapeptide found in the skin of Hyla caerulea, the\n  Australian green tree frog. Ceruletide has very much in common with regards to\n  action and composition to cholecystokinin. It stimulates gastric, biliary, and\n  pancreatic secretion; and certain smooth muscle. It is used to induce\n  pancreatitis in experimental animal models.\n* Glutathione - A tripeptide with many roles in cells. It conjugates to drugs to\n  make them more soluble for excretion, is a cofactor for some enzymes, is\n  involved in protein disulfide bond rearrangement and reduces peroxides.\n* Leupeptins - A group of acylated oligopeptides produced by Actinomycetes that\n  function as protease inhibitors. They have been known to inhibit to varying\n  degrees trypsin, plasmin, kallikreins, papain and the cathepsins. *Netropsin\n  - A basic polypeptide isolated from [[Streptomyces netropsis]]. It is\n  cytotoxic and its strong, specific binding to A-T areas of DNA is useful to\n  genetics research.\n* Pepstatins - N-acylated oligopeptides isolated from culture filtrates of\n  Actinomycetes, which act specifically to inhibit acid proteases such as pepsin\n  and renin.\n* Peptide T - N-(N-(N(2)-(N-(N-(N-(N- D-Alanyl L -seryl)- L-threonyl)- L-\n  threonyl) L -threonyl)- L-asparaginyl)- L-\n  tyrosyl) L -threonine. Octapeptide sharing sequence homology\n  with HIV envelope protein gp120. It may be useful as antiviral agent in AIDS\n  therapy. The core pentapeptide sequence, TTNYT, consisting of amino acids\n  4-8 in peptide T, is the HIV envelope sequence required for attachment to\n  the CD4 receptor.\n* Phalloidin - A very toxic polypeptide isolated mainly from [[Amanita\n  phalloides]] (Agaricaceae) or death cap; causes fatal liver, kidney and CNS\n  damage in mushroom poisoning; used in the study of liver damage.\n* Teprotide - A man made nonapeptide (Pyr-Trp-Pro-Arg-Pro-Gln-Ile-Pro-Pro) which\n  is exactly the same as the peptide from the venom of the snake, Bothrops\n  jararaca. It inhibits kininase II and ANGIOTENSIN I and has been proposed as\n  an antihypertensive agent.\n* Tuftsin - N(2)-((1-(N(2)- L-Threonyl)- L-lysyl)-\n  L -prolyl)- L-arginine. A tetrapeptide\n  manufactured in the spleen by enzymatic cleavage of a leukophilic gamma-\n  globulin. It stimulates the phagocytic activity of blood polymorphonuclear\n  leukocytes and neutrophils in particular. The peptide is located in the Fd\n  fragment of the gamma-globulin molecule.\n","linknr":108,"url":"Oligopeptide","recorded":1362508077,"links":15,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Peptides"],"headings":["See also","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Tetrapeptide_structural_formulae_v.1.png/350px-Tetrapeptide_structural_formulae_v.1.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Dipeptide","Tripeptide","Tetrapeptide","Pentapeptide","Amanitins","RNA_polymerase","Antipain","Ceruletide","Australian_Green_Tree_Frog","Cholecystokinin","Smooth_muscle","Pancreatitis","Glutathione","Leupeptin","Trypsin","Plasmin","Kallikrein","Papain","Cathepsin","Netropsin","Pepstatin","Peptide_T","Phalloidin","Teprotide","Tuftsin","Oligoester"]}
