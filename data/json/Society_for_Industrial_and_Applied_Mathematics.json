This\nmeeting led to the organization of the Society for Industrial and Applied\nMathematics. The membership of SIAM has grown from a few hundred in the early\n1950s to more than 12,000 . SIAM retains its North American influence, but it\nalso has East Asian, Argentinian, Bulgarian, and UK & Ireland sections.\n\nSIAM is one of the four parts of the Joint Policy Board for Mathematics.\n","recorded":1362123873,"portal":[],"list":[],"links":"101","instances":["mathematics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Mathematical societies","Organizations established in 1951","1951 establishments in the United States"],"headings":["Members","Focus","Activity groups (SIAGs)","Journals","Books","Conferences","SIAM News","Prizes and recognition","Moody's Mega Math (M<sup>3</sup>) Challenge","Students","See also","References","External links"],"tags":[["optimization","mathematics"],["optimization","mathematics"]],"image":["http://en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg","http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Siam-logo.png","http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/79/Siam-logo.png/200px-Siam-logo.png","http://bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","http://bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"related":["Philadelphia","Pennsylvania","Lloyd_N._Trefethen","Academia","Philadelphia","Mathematics","Joint_Policy_Board_for_Mathematics","Acronym","Engineers","Scientists","Mathematical_model","Applied_mathematics","Algebraic_geometry","Partial_differential_equation","Computational_engineering","Discrete_Mathematics","Dynamical_system","Imaging_Science","Linear_algebra","Optimization_(mathematics)","Orthogonal_polynomials","Special_functions","Supercomputing","Uncertainty_Quantification","Germund_Dahlquist","George_Pólya_Prize","Differential_equation","Theodore_von_Kármán_Prize","James_H._Wilkinson","Numerical_analysis","Moody's_Mega_Math_Challenge","American_Mathematical_Society"],"members":["optimization"],"book":[]}
