It is used as an emulsion\nstabilizer, opacifying agent, and foam boosting surfactant, as well as an\naqueous and nonaqueous viscosity-increasing agent. It imparts an emollient feel\nto the skin and can be used in water-in-oil emulsions, oil-in-water emulsions,\nand anhydrous formulations. It is commonly used in hair conditioners and other\nhair products.\n\nChemical Abstracts Service, CAS# 8005-44-5 and is available in NF grade.
