{"cursor":"79796","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n from Western District overlooking Kowloon, across Victoria Harbour.]]\n\n'Urban planning' (urban, city, and town planning) is a technical and political\nprocess concerned with the control of the use of land and design of the urban\nenvironment, including transportation networks, to guide and ensure the orderly\ndevelopment of settlements and communities. It concerns itself with research and\nanalysis, strategic thinking, architecture, urban design, public consultation,\npolicy recommendations, implementation and management. Taylor, Nigel (2007).\nUrban Planning Theory since 1945, London, Sage.\n\nA plan can take a variety of forms including strategic plans, comprehensive\nplans, neighborhood plans, regulatory and incentive strategies, or historic\npreservation plans. Planners are often also responsible for enforcing the\nchosen policies.\n\nThe modern origins of urban planning lie in the movement for urban reform that\narose as a reaction against the disorder of the industrial city in the mid-19th\ncentury. Urban planning can include urban renewal, by adapting urban planning\nmethods to existing cities suffering from decline. In the late-20th century, the\nterm sustainable development has come to represent an ideal outcome in the sum\nof all planning goals.
