Bush (president of United States)] EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica.\nRetrieved November 1, 2012 and the 46th Governor of Texas from 1995 to\n2000. The eldest son of Barbara and George H. W. Bush, he was born in New Haven,\nConnecticut. After graduating from Yale University in 1968 and Harvard Business\nSchool in 1975, Bush worked in oil businesses. He married Laura Welch in 1977\nand ran unsuccessfully for the House of Representatives shortly thereafter. He\nlater co-owned the Texas Rangers baseball team before defeating Ann Richards in\nthe 1994 Texas gubernatorial election. Bush was elected president in 2000 after\na close and controversial election, becoming the fourth president to be elected\nwhile receiving fewer popular votes nationwide than his opponent.\nBush is the second president to have been the son of a former president, the\nfirst being John Quincy Adams. He is also the brother of Jeb Bush,\nformer Governor of Florida.\n\nEight months into Bush's first term as president, the September 11, 2001\nterrorist attacks occurred. In response, Bush announced the War on Terror, an\ninternational military campaign which included the war in Afghanistan launched\nin 2001 and the war in Iraq launched in 2003. In addition to national security\nissues, Bush also promoted policies on the economy, health care, education, and\nsocial security reform. He signed into law broad tax cuts, the PATRIOT Act, the\nNo Child Left Behind Act, the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, and Medicare\nprescription drug benefits for seniors. His tenure saw national debates on\nimmigration, Social Security, electronic surveillance, and enhanced\ninterrogation techniques. He announced the U.S. would not implement the Kyoto\nProtocol on global warming, which had been signed by the previous administration\nbut never ratified by the Senate.\n\nBush successfully ran for re-election against Democratic Senator John Kerry in\n2004, in another relatively close election. After his re-election, Bush received\nincreasingly heated criticism from across the political\nspectrum Baker, Kevin, [http://www.americanheritage.com/content/second-term-\nblues \"Second-Term Blues: Why Have Our Presidents Almost Always Stumbled after\nTheir First Four Years?\"], American Heritage, Aug./Sept. 2006. for his\nhandling of the Iraq War, Hurricane Katrina,\nand numerous other controversies. As a result, the Democratic Party won control\nof Congress in the 2006 elections. In December 2007, the United States entered\nits longest postâWorld War II recession, prompting the Bush Administration to\nenact multiple economic programs intended to preserve the country's financial\nsystem. Nationally, Bush was both one of the most popular and unpopular\npresidents in history, having received the highest recorded presidential\napproval ratings in the wake of 9/11, as well as one of the lowest approval\nratings during the 2008 financial crisis.\nInternationally, he was a highly controversial figure, with public protests\noccurring even during visits to close allies, such as the United\nKingdom.\n\nBush left office in 2009, and was succeeded as president by Barack Obama, who\nran on a platform of change from Bush's policies. Since leaving office, Bush has\nreturned to Texas and purchased a home in a suburban area of Dallas. He is\ncurrently a public speaker and has written a book about his life entitled\n[[Decision Points]].
