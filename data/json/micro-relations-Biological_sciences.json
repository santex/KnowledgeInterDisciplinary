Based on definition from\n[http://www.bio.txstate.edu/~wetlands/Glossary/glossary.html Aquarena Wetlands\nProject glossary of terms.] Biology has many subdisciplines unified by\nfive so-called axioms of modern biology:\n\n# Cells are the basic unit of life Genes are the basic unit of heredity New\n# species and inherited traits are the product of evolution An organism\n# regulates its internal environment to maintain a stable and constant condition\n# Living organisms consume and transform energy\n\nSubdisciplines of biology are defined by the scale at which organisms are\nstudied and the methods used to study them: biochemistry examines the\nrudimentary chemistry of life; molecular biology studies the complex\ninteractions among biological molecules; cellular biology examines the basic\nbuilding block of all life, the cell; physiology examines the physical and\nchemical functions of tissues, organs, and organ systems of an organism;\nevolutionary biology examines the processes that produced the diversity of life;\nand ecology examines how organisms interact in their\nenvironment.
