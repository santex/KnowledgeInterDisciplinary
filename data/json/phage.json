Bacteriophages are composed of proteins that encapsulate a\nDNA or RNA genome, and may have relatively simple or elaborate structures. Their\ngenomes may encode as few as four genes, and as many as hundreds of genes. Phage\nreplicate within bacteria following the injection of their genome into the\ncytoplasm. Bacteriophage are among the most common and diverse entities in the\nbiosphere.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"></ref>\n\nPhages are widely distributed in locations populated by bacterial hosts, such as\nsoil or the intestines of animals. One of the densest natural sources for phages\nand other viruses is sea water, where up to 9×10<sup>8</sup> virions per\nmilliliter have been found in microbial mats at the surface,<ref></ref> and up\nto 70% of marine bacteria may be infected by phages.<ref\nname=\"Prescott\">Prescott, L. (1993). Microbiology, Wm. C. Brown Publishers, ISBN\n0-697-01372-3</ref> They have been used for over 90 years as an alternative to\nantibiotics in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, as well as in\nFrance.<ref name=\"horizon\">BBC Horizon (1997): The Virus that Cures –\nDocumentary about the history of phage medicine in Russia and the West</ref>\nThey are seen as a possible therapy against multi-drug-resistant strains of many\nbacteria.<ref></ref>\n",
