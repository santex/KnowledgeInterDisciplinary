{"cursor":"30868","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Advocacy groups' (also known as 'pressure groups', 'lobby groups', 'campaign\ngroups', 'interest groups', or 'special interest groups') use various forms of\nadvocacy to influence public opinion and/or policy; they have played and\ncontinue to play an important part in the development of political and social\nsystems. Groups vary considerably in size, influence, and motive; some have wide\nranging long term social purposes, others are focused and are a response to an\nimmediate issue or concern.\n\nMotives for action may be based on a shared political, faith, moral or\ncommercial position. Groups use varied methods to try to achieve their aims\nincluding lobbying, media campaigns, publicity stunts, polls, research, and\npolicy briefings. Some groups are supported by powerful business or political\ninterests and exert considerable influence on the political process, others have\nfew such resources.\n\nSome have developed into important social, political institutions or social\nmovements. Some powerful Lobby groups have been accused of manipulating the\ndemocratic system for narrow commercial gain and in some\ninstances have been found guilty of corruption, fraud, bribery, and other\nserious crimes; lobbying has become increasingly regulated as a\nresult. Some groups, generally ones with less financial resources, may use\ndirect action and civil disobedience and in some cases are accused of being a\nthreat to the social order or 'domestic extremists'. {{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/georgemonbiot/2009/feb/13/george-\nmonbiot-police-protestors |title=Meet the new Britain: just like the old one\nwhere green protesters are spied on |accessdate=2009-02-23\n | work=The Guardian | location=London | first=George | last=Monbiot | date=2009-02-\n | 16| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090219222920/http://www.guardia-\n | n.co.uk/environment/georgemonbiot/2009/feb/13/george-monbiot-police-\n | protestors| archivedate= 19 February 2009 | deadurl= no}}\n | Research is beginning to explore how advocacy groups use social media to\n | facilitate civic engagement and collective action.\n","linknr":393,"url":"Interest_group","recorded":1362477161,"links":39,"instances":["legal","academic","uk","british_political_party"],"pdf":["http://web.archive.org/web/20080625084126/http://www.naag.org/backpages/naag/tobacco/msa/msa-pdf/1109185724_1032468605_cigmsa.pdf","http://www.naag.org/backpages/naag/tobacco/msa/msa-pdf/1109185724_1032468605_cigmsa.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20080625084126/http://www.naag.org/backpages/naag/tobacco/msa/msa-pdf/1109185724_1032468605_cigmsa.pdf"],"categories":["Advocacy groups|","Political terminology","Lobbying","Identity politics","Public choice theory"],"headings":["Overview","Influence","Influential advocacy groups","Corruption and illegal activity","Adversarial groupings","Benefits and incentives","Theoretical perspectives","Social media use","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/Plato-raphael.jpg/26px-Plato-raphael.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["defense","legal"],["sierra_nevada","u.s."],["tory","british_political_party"],["conservative_party","uk"],["david_walls","academic"]],"members":["sierra_nevada","defense","david_walls","conservative_party","tory"],"related":["Advocacy","Public_opinion","Political","Faith","Morality","Commerce","Lobbying","Social_movements","Commerce","Political_corruption","Fraud","Bribery","Crimes","Direct_action","Civil_disobedience","Consumer_organization","Professional_association","Trade_association","Trade_union","Lobbying","Lobbying_in_the_United_States","Lobbying_in_the_United_Kingdom","Political_corruption","Internal_Revenue_Service","Defense_(legal)","Amicus_curiae","Employers'_organizations","Labour_movement","Tradesman","Profession","Trade_union","Consumer_organization","Social_movements","American_Israel_Public_Affairs_Committee","New_York_Times","Israel","British_Medical_Association","Medical_Act_1858","General_Medical_Council","Campaign_for_Nuclear_Disarmament","Nuclear_Non-Proliferation_Treaty","Nuclear_disarmament","Peace_symbols","Center_for_Auto_Safety","Drug_Policy_Alliance","United_States","War_on_Drugs","Electronic_Frontier_Foundation","Non-profit_organization","Digital_rights","Advocacy_organization","United_States","Energy_Lobby","Umbrella_term","Financial_Services_Roundtable","Banking_lobby","Greenpeace","Don't_Make_a_Wave_Committee","Nuclear_weapons_testing","National_Rifle_Association","Oxfam","Oxford","Famine_Relief","Pennsylvania_Abolition_Society","Philadelphia","Abolitionism","People_for_the_Ethical_Treatment_of_Animals","Royal_Society_for_the_Protection_of_Birds","Manchester","Sierra_Club","Sierra_Nevada_(U.S.)","Stop_the_War_Coalition","War_on_Terrorism","Suffragette","Direct_action","Hunger_strikes","Affiliated_Residential_Park_Residents_Association","Sunday_school","History_of_education_in_England","Tory_(British_political_party)","Exclusion_Bill","Political_party","Conservative_Party_(UK)","Jack_Abramoff_Indian_lobbying_scandal","Native_American_gambling_enterprises","Tobacco_Master_Settlement_Agreement","Attorneys_General","Pro-choice","Pro-life_movement","Abortion","SPEAK_campaign","Pro-Test","Animal_testing","The_Automobile_Association","Pedestrians'_Association","Tobacco_Institute","Action_on_Smoking_and_Health","Flying_Matters","Plane_Stupid","Free_rider_problem","Client_politics","Identity_politics","Lobbying_in_the_United_States","Non-governmental_organization","Pressure_groups_in_the_United_Kingdom","David_Walls_(academic)"]}
