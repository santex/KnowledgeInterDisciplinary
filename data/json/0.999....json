{"cursor":"80872","size":15,"audio":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e5/0.999....ogg"],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\nIn mathematics, the repeating decimal '0.999...' (sometimes written with more\nor fewer 9s before the final ellipsis, or as '0. 9', ,}} '0.(9)') denotes a real number that can be\nshown to be the number one. In other words, the symbols \"0.999...\" and \"1\"\nrepresent the same number. Proofs of this equality have been formulated with\nvarying degrees of mathematical rigor, taking into account preferred\ndevelopment of the real numbers, background assumptions, historical context,\nand target audience.\n\nEvery nonzero, terminating decimal has an equal twin representation with\ntrailing 9s, such as 8.32 and 8.31999... The terminating decimal representation\nis almost always preferred, contributing to the misconception that it is the\nonly representation. The same phenomenon occurs in all other bases or in any\nsimilar representation of the real numbers.\n\nThe equality of 0.999... and 1 is closely related to the absence of nonzero\ninfinitesimals in the real number system, the most commonly used system in\nmathematical analysis. Some alternative number systems, such as the hyperreals,\ndo contain nonzero infinitesimals. In most such number systems, the standard\ninterpretation of the expression 0.999... makes it equal to 1, but in some of\nthese number systems, the symbol \"0.999...\" admits other interpretations that\ncontain infinitely many 9s while falling infinitesimally short of 1.\n\nThe equality 0.999... = 1 has long been accepted by mathematicians and\nis part of general mathematical education. Nonetheless, some students find it\nsufficiently counterintuitive that they question or reject it, commonly enough\nthat the difficulty of convincing them of the validity of this identity has been\nthe subject of several studies in mathematics education.\n","linknr":808,"url":"0.999...","recorded":1362374602,"links":90,"instances":["exponentiation","mathematics","mathematics","computer_science","mathematics","mathematics","mathematics","mathematician","number","mathematics","topology","group_theory","set_theory","mathematics","algebra","computer_science"],"pdf":["http://web.archive.org/web/20110722153906/http://www.wou.edu/~wardm/FromMonthlyMay2004.pdf","http://www.wou.edu/~wardm/FromMonthlyMay2004.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20110722153906/http://www.wou.edu/~wardm/FromMonthlyMay2004.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20090530043127/http://www.warwick.ac.uk/staff/David.Tall/pdfs/dot2001j-pme25-pinto-tall.pdf","http://www.warwick.ac.uk/staff/David.Tall/pdfs/dot2001j-pme25-pinto-tall.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20090530043127/http://www.warwick.ac.uk/staff/David.Tall/pdfs/dot2001j-pme25-pinto-tall.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20090225124532/http://www.ams.org/notices/200501/fea-dundes.pdf","http://www.ams.org/notices/200501/fea-dundes.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20090225124532/http://www.ams.org/notices/200501/fea-dundes.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20090530043040/http://www.warwick.ac.uk/staff/David.Tall/pdfs/dot1978c-with-rolph.pdf","http://www.warwick.ac.uk/staff/David.Tall/pdfs/dot1978c-with-rolph.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20090530043040/http://www.warwick.ac.uk/staff/David.Tall/pdfs/dot1978c-with-rolph.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20090326052901/http://www.warwick.ac.uk/staff/David.Tall/pdfs/dot1976a-confl-catastrophy.pdf","http://www.warwick.ac.uk/staff/David.Tall/pdfs/dot1976a-confl-catastrophy.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20090326052901/http://www.warwick.ac.uk/staff/David.Tall/pdfs/dot1976a-confl-catastrophy.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20090530043111/http://www.warwick.ac.uk/staff/David.Tall/pdfs/dot2001b-merj-amt.pdf","http://www.warwick.ac.uk/staff/David.Tall/pdfs/dot2001b-merj-amt.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20090530043111/http://www.warwick.ac.uk/staff/David.Tall/pdfs/dot2001b-merj-amt.pdf","http://elib.mi.sanu.ac.rs/files/journals/tm/20/tm1114.pdf","http://elib.mi.sanu.ac.rs/files/journals/tm/20/tm1114.pdf","http://elib.mi.sanu.ac.rs/files/journals/tm/24/tm1312.pdf","http://elib.mi.sanu.ac.rs/files/journals/tm/24/tm1312.pdf"],"categories":["One","Mathematics
