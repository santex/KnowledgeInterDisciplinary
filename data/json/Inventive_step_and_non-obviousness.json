{"cursor":"16493","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nThe 'inventive step' and 'non-obviousness' reflect a same general patentability\nrequirement present in most patent laws, according to which an invention should\nbe sufficiently inventive — i.e., non-obvious — in order to be\npatented. In other words, \"[the] nonobviousness\nprinciple asks whether the invention is an adequate distance beyond or above the\nstate of the art.\" Barton, John H. (2003)\n\nThe expression \"inventive step\" is predominantly used in Europe, while the\nexpression \"non-obviousness\" is predominantly used in United States patent\nlaw. Although the basic principle is roughly the same, the\nassessment of the inventive step and non-obviousness varies from one country to\nanother. For instance, the practice of the European Patent Office (EPO) differs\nfrom the practice in the United Kingdom.\n","linknr":234,"url":"Inventive_step_and_non-obviousness","recorded":1362535291,"links":19,"instances":["canada","patent"],"pdf":["http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/06pdf/04-1350.pdf"],"categories":["Patent law"],"headings":["Rationale","Jurisdictions","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["claim","patent"],["patent_act","canada"]],"members":["patent_act","claim"],"related":["Patentability","Patent_law","Invention","United_States_patent_law","European_Patent_Office","Invention","State_of_the_art","Person_skilled_in_the_art","Grant_procedure_before_the_European_Patent_Office","Opposition_procedure_before_the_European_Patent_Office","Appeal_procedure_before_the_European_Patent_Office","Claim_(patent)","Prior_art","Priority_right","United_States","Title_35_of_the_United_States_Code","Person_having_ordinary_skill_in_the_art","Case_citation","Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Federal_Circuit","Hindsight_bias","U.S._Supreme_Court","Graham_v._John_Deere_Co.","Paul_Redmond_Michel","US_Supreme_Court","United_States_Patents_Quarterly","Patent_Act_of_1952","Flash_of_genius","Patent_Act_(Canada)","Supreme_Court_of_Canada","Flash_of_genius","Priority_right","Cripps_question","European_Patent_Institute"]}
