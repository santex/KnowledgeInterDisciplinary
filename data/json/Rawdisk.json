Virtualization software may typically function via the usage of a virtual\ndrive format like OVF, but some users may want the virtualization software to be\nable to run an operating system that has been installed on another disk or disk\npartition. In order to do this, the virtualization software must allow raw disk\naccess to that disk or disk partition, and then allow that entire operating\nsystem to boot within the virtualization window.\n","linknr":83,"url":"Rawdisk","recorded":1362538451,"links":13,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Hard disk drives","Virtualization software"],"headings":[],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d7/Computer.svg/30px-Computer.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Computing","Hard_disk","File_system","Disk_partitioning","Master_boot_record","Platform_virtualization","RAM_drive","Open_Virtualization_Format"]}
