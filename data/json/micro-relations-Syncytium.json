A classic example of a syncytium is the\nformation of skeletal muscle. The term may also refer to cells that are\ninterconnected by specialized membrane with gap junctions, as seen in the heart\nmuscle cells and certain smooth muscle cells, which are synchronized\nelectrically in an action potential.\n\nAnother (correct and well established) use of the word syncytium is found in\nanimal embryology to refer to the coenocytic blastoderm of\ninvertebrates.
