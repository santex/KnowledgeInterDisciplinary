It\nis a traditional main sector of craft, and applies to a wide range of creative\nand design activities that are related to making things with one's hands and\nskill, including work with textiles, moldable and rigid materials, paper, plant\nfibers, etc. Usually the term is applied to traditional techniques of creating\nitems (whether for personal use or as products) that are both practical and\naesthetic.\n\nCollective terms for handicrafts include 'artisanry', 'handicrafting',\n'crafting', and 'handicraftsmanship'. The term 'arts and crafts' is also\napplied, especially in the United States and mostly to hobbyists' and children's\noutput rather than items crafted for daily use, but this distinction is not\nformal, and the term is easily confused with the Arts and Crafts design\nmovement, which is in fact as practical as it is aesthetic.\n\nHandicrafting has its roots in the rural craftsâthe material-goods\nnecessitiesâof ancient civilizations, and many specific crafts have been\npracticed for centuries, while others are modern inventions, or popularizations\nof crafts which were originally practiced in a limited geographic area.\n\nMany handicrafters use natural, even entirely indigenous, materials while others\nmay prefer modern, non-traditional materials, and even upcycle industrial\nmaterials. The individual artisanship of a handicrafted item is the paramount\ncriterion; those made by mass production or machines are not handicraft goods.\n\nSeen as developing the skills and creative interests of students, generally and\nsometimes towards a particular craft or trade, handicrafts are often integrated\ninto educational systems, both informally and formally. Most crafts require the\ndevelopment of skill and the application of patience, but can be learned by\nvirtually anyone.\n\nLike folk art, handicraft output often has cultural and/or religious\nsignificance, and increasingly may have a political message as well, as in\ncraftivism. Many crafts become very popular for brief periods of time (a few\nmonths, or a few years), spreading rapidly among the crafting population as\neveryone emulates the first examples, then their popularity wanes until a later\nresurgence.\n","linknr":426,"url":"Handicraft","recorded":1362534894,"links":79,"instances":["art","textiles","paper"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Arts and crafts","Crafts","Decorative arts","Visual arts","Handicrafts|"],"headings":["History in the Indian subcontinent, 3000 BCE – 600s CE","The Arts and Crafts movement in the West","Handicrafts in modern education","List of common handicrafts","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Ambox_globe_content.svg/48px-Ambox_globe_content.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/55/Iranian_Handicraft.JPG/250px-Iranian_Handicraft.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/Handicrafts_idols.JPG/220px-Handicrafts_idols.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/WPA_Crafts_Class.gif/220px-WPA_Crafts_Class.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/64/Buell_Childrens_Museum_Art_Room_by_David_Shankbone.jpg/220px-Buell_Childrens_Museum_Art_Room_by_David_Shankbone.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e4/Marquetry_Mezuzah.jpg/120px-Marquetry_Mezuzah.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["embossing","leather"],["spinning","textiles"],["assemblage","art"],["embossing","paper"]],"members":["assemblage","spinning","embossing"],"related":["Iran","Craft","Arts_and_Crafts","Rural_crafts","Upcycling","Artisan","Mass_production","Folk_art","Craftivism","India","Pakistan","Indian_subcontinent","Indus_Valley_civilization","Common_era","Harappa","Mohen-jo-daro","Arts_and_Crafts","William_Morris","John_Ruskin","Middle_Ages","Catharsis","Guild","Industrial_Revolution","Tradesman","Hobby","Folk_art","Fine_art","Manual_labor","Blue-collar","Ceramic","Glass","Textiles","Metal","Wood","Community_of_practice","Scandinavia","Vocational_education","Fine_art","Studio_craft","Community_center","Banner-making","Calligraphy","Canvas_work","Cross-stitch","Crochet","Embroidery","Felting","Knitting","Lace-making","Embossing_(leather)","Luce","Macrame","Hat_making","Needlepoint","Needlework","Patchwork","Quilting","Ribbon_embroidery","Rug_making","Saddle","Sewing","Shoe_making","Silkscreen","Spinning_(textiles)","String_art","Tapestry","Tatting","T-shirt","Weaving","Bead_work","Bone_carving","Carpentry","Ceramic_art","Chip_carving","Dollhouse","Doll_making","Fretwork","Etching","Glassblowing","Jewelry_design","Lapidary","Lath_art","Marquetry","Metalwork","Mosaic","Pottery","Puppetry","Repoussé_and_chasing","Scale_model","Sculpture","Stained_glass","Toy_making","Wood_burning","Wood_carving","Wood_turning","Woodworking","Altered_book","Artist_trading_cards","Assemblage_(art)","Book_binding","Calligraphy","Card_making","Collage","De_collage","Decoupage","Embossing_(paper)","Iris_folding","Origami","Paper_craft","Paper_making","Paper_marbling","Paper_model","Papier-mâché","Parchment_craft","Pop-up_book","Quilling","Rubber_stamp","Scrap_booking","Basket","Weaving","Corn_dolly","Floral_design","Pressed_flower_craft","Straw_marquetry","Balloon_animal","Cake_decorating","Egg_decorating"]}
