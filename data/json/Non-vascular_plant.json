{"cursor":"2980","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Non-vascular plants' are plants without a vascular system (xylem and phloem).\nAlthough non-vascular plants lack these particular tissues, a number of non-\nvascular plants possess simpler tissues that are specialized for internal\ntransport of water.\n\nNon-vascular plants do not have a wide variety of specialized tissue types.\nLeafy liverworts have structures that look like leaves, but are not true leaves\nbecause they are single sheets of cells with no cuticle, stomata or internal air\nspaces have no xylem or phloem. Consequently they are unable to control water\nloss from their tissues and are said to be poikilohydric. Likewise, mosses and\nalgae have no such tissues.\n\nAll land plants have a life cycle with an alternation of generations between a\ndiploid sporophyte and a haploid gametophyte, but in all nonvascular land plants\nthe gametophyte generation is dominant. In these plants, the sporophytes grow\nfrom and are dependent on gametophytes for taking in water and mineral nutrients\nand for provision of photosynthate, the products of photosynthesis.\n","linknr":190,"url":"Non-vascular_plant","recorded":1362482652,"links":22,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Non-vascular plants|","Plants"],"headings":["Non-vascular groups","See also","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Vascular_tissue","Xylem","Phloem","Water","Marchantiophyta","Leaf","Plant_cuticle","Stomata","Xylem","Phloem","Poikilohydry","Alternation_of_generations","Sporophyte","Gametophyte","Photosynthesis","Bryophyte","Moss","Marchantiophyta","Hornwort","Haploid","Gametophyte","Diploid","Sporophyte","Sporangium","Vascular_plant","Alga","Green_algae","Photosynthesis","Archaeplastida","Evolution","Vascular_tissue","Fern","Fern_ally","Alga","Fungus_","Biology","Vascular_plant"]}
