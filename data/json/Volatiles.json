Examples include nitrogen, water, carbon\ndioxide, ammonia, hydrogen, methane and sulfur dioxide. In astrogeology, these\ncompounds, in their solid state, often comprise large proportions of the crusts\nof moons and dwarf planets. .]] In contrast with volatiles, those elements and\ncompounds with high boiling points are known as [[Refractory (planetary\nscience)|refractory]] substances.\n\nPlanetary scientists often class volatiles with exceptionally low melting\npoints, such as hydrogen and helium, as 'gases' (as in gas giant), while those\nvolatiles with melting points above about 100 K are referred to as 'ices'. The\nterms \"gas\" and \"ice\" in this context can apply to compounds that may be solids,\nliquids or gases. Thus, Jupiter and Saturn are referred to as \"gas giants\", and\nUranus and Neptune are referred to as \"ice giants\", even though the vast\nmajority of the \"gas\" and \"ice\" in their interiors is a hot, highly dense fluid\nthat gets denser as the center of the planet is approached.\n\nThe Earth's Moon is considered very low in volatiles: its crust contains oxygen\nchemically bound into the rocks (as e.g. silicates), but negligible amounts of\nhydrogen, nitrogen or carbon.\n","linknr":262,"url":"Volatiles","recorded":1362371905,"links":21,"instances":["chemistry","geology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Petrology","Volcanology","Planetary geology","Ice"],"headings":["Igneous petrology","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/Jupiter_interior.png/220px-Jupiter_interior.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/SandstoneUSGOV.jpg/38px-SandstoneUSGOV.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["volatility","chemistry"],["crust","geology"]],"members":["volatility","crust"],"related":["Planetary_science","Chemical_elements","Chemical_compounds","Volatility_(chemistry)","Planet","Moon","Crust_(geology)","Atmosphere","Nitrogen","Water","Carbon_dioxide","Ammonia","Hydrogen","Methane","Sulfur_dioxide","Astrogeology","Moons","Dwarf_planet","Hydrogen","Helium","Gas_giant","Jupiter","Saturn","Uranus","Neptune","Supercritical_fluid","Moon","Silicates","Igneous_petrology","Magma","Water_vapor","Volcanoes","Felsic","Mafic","Lava_fountain"]}
