Jerry March Advanced Organic Chemistry 3rd Ed. In an\nideal trigonal planar species, all three ligands are identical and all bond\nangles are 120Â°. Such species belong to the point group D 3h .\nMolecules where the three ligands are not identical, such as H 2CO,\ndeviate from this idealized geometry. Examples of molecules with trigonal planar\ngeometry include boron trifluoride (BF 3), formaldehyde\n(H 2CO), phosgene (COCl 2), and sulfur trioxide\n(SO 3). Some ions with trigonal planar geometry include nitrate\n(NO 3â ), carbonate ion (CO 32â ), and\nguanidinium C(NH 2) 3+ . In organic chemistry,\nplanar, three-connected carbon centers that are trigonal planar are often\ndescribed as having sp 2 hybridization. Holleman, A.

One way to observe this distortion is in pyramidal\nalkenes.\n","linknr":155,"url":"Trigonal_planar","recorded":1362482216,"links":18,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Stereochemistry","Molecular geometry"],"headings":["See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/AX3E0-3D-balls.png/200px-AX3E0-3D-balls.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bb/Boron-trifluoride-3D-vdW.png/200px-Boron-trifluoride-3D-vdW.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Chemistry","Molecular_geometry","Point_group","Formaldehyde","Molecule","Boron_trifluoride","Formaldehyde","Phosgene","Sulfur_trioxide","Nitrate","Carbonate","Guanidine","Orbital_hybridisation","Nitrogen_inversion","Amine","Tetrahedral_molecular_geometry","Pyramidal_alkene","AXE_method","Molecular_geometry","VSEPR_theory"]}
