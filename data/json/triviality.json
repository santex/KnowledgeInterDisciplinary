      "text" : "\n\n\nThe 'trivia' (singular '[[Trivium (education)|trivium]]') are three lower\n[[Artes Liberales]], i.e. grammar, logic and rhetoric. These were the topics of\nbasic education, foundational to the [[Quadrivium|quadrivia]] of higher\neducation, and hence the material of basic education and an important building\nblock for all undergraduates. The word trivia was also used to describe a place\nwhere three roads met in Ancient Rome.\n\nWhile the term is now obsolescent, in ancient times, it was appropriated to mean\nsomething very new.\n\nIn the 1960s, nostalgic college students and others began to informally trade\nquestions and answers about the popular culture of their youth. The first known\ndocumented labeling of this casual parlor game as \"Trivia\" was in a [[Columbia\nDaily Spectator]] column published on February&nbsp;5, 1965. The authors, Ed\nGoodgold and Dan Carlinsky, then started the first organized trivia contests,\ndescribed below. Since the 1960s, the plural trivia in particular has widened to\ninclude but not essential, specifically detailed knowledge on topics of popular\nculture. The expression has also come to suggest information of the kind useful\nalmost exclusively for answering quiz questions, hence the brand name [[Trivial\nPursuit]] (1982).\n",
