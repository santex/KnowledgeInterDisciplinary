Cook made detailed maps of Newfoundland prior to\nmaking three voyages to the Pacific Ocean, during which he achieved the first\nrecorded European contact with the eastern coastline of Australia and the\nHawaiian Islands, and the first recorded circumnavigation of New Zealand.\n\nCook joined the British merchant navy as a teenager and joined the Royal Navy in\n1755. He saw action in the Seven Years' War, and subsequently surveyed and\nmapped much of the entrance to the Saint Lawrence River during the siege of\nQuebec. This helped bring Cook to the attention of the Admiralty and Royal\nSociety. This notice came at a crucial moment in both Cook's career and the\ndirection of British overseas exploration, and led to his commission in 1766 as\ncommander of HM Bark ''Endeavour'' for the first of three Pacific voyages.\n\nIn three voyages Cook sailed thousands of miles across largely uncharted areas\nof the globe. He mapped lands from New Zealand to Hawaii in the Pacific Ocean in\ngreater detail and on a scale not previously achieved. As he progressed on his\nvoyages of discovery he surveyed and named features, and recorded islands and\ncoastlines on European maps for the first time. He displayed a combination of\nseamanship, superior surveying and cartographic skills, physical courage and an\nability to lead men in adverse conditions.\n\nCook was killed in Hawaii in a fight with Hawaiians during his third exploratory\nvoyage in the Pacific in 1779. He left a legacy of scientific and geographical\nknowledge which was to influence his successors well into the 20th century\nand numerous memorials worldwide have been dedicated to him.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Captain_James_Cook","recorded":1372152444,"links":[],"instances":["royal_navy_officer","navigation","united_states_coin","angle","navigator","1757","seaman","royal_navy_officer","ship_type","1774","1771","crater","instrument","royal_navy","naval","queensland","1745","navy","saint_elias_mountains","royal_navy","island","1771","1742","island","royal_navy_officer","astronomer","royal_navy_officer","1754"],"pdf":[],"categories":["1728
