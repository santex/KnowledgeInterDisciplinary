{"cursor":"2449","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The 'ristocetin-induced platelet aggregation' (RIPA) is an ex vivo assay for\nlive platelet function to aggregate with help of von Willebrand factor (vWF) and\nexogenous antibiotic ristocetin added in a graded fashion used to diagnose von Willebrand disease (vWD). It is\nsimilar to the ristocetin cofactor activity but has the added benefit in that it\ncan diagnose type 2B vWD and Bernard-Soulier syndrome because it uses patients\nlive endogenous platelets, whereas Ristocetin Cofactor Assay tests the function\nof only the VWF and not the platelets. Riscocetin cofactor assay uses platelet\npoor plasma (with VWF but no platelets) and adds ristocetin and exogenous\nformalin fixed platelets which can passively agglutinate (but not actively\n\"aggregate\", as they are dead).\n\nIn an unknown fashion, the antibiotic ristocetin causes von Willebrand factor to\nbind the platelet receptor glycoprotein Ib (GpIb), so when ristocetin is added\nto normal blood, it causes agglutination of fixed platelets or initiates the\ninitial agglutination phase of aggregation of live platelets. In von Willebrand\ndisease, where von Willebrand factor is absent or defective, abnormal\nagglutination occurs:\n\n* In type 1 vWD: hypoactive agglutination occurs\n* In type 2A vWD: hypoactive agglutination occurs\n* In type 2B vWD: 'hyperactive' agglutination occurs\n* In type 2M vWD: hypoactive agglutination occurs activity\n* In type 2N vWD: normal agglutination occurs\n* In type 3 vWD: no agglutination occurs\n","linknr":164,"url":"Ristocetin_Induced_Platelet_Aggregation","recorded":1362481280,"links":12,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Blood tests"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Von_Willebrand_factor","Ristocetin","Von_Willebrand_disease","Ristocetin_cofactor_activity","Bernard-Soulier_syndrome","Ristocetin_Cofactor_Assay","Ristocetin","Glycoprotein_Ib"]}
