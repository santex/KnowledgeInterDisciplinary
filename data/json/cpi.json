goods and services purchased by households. The CPI in the\nUnited States is defined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics as \"a measure of the\naverage change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market\nbasket of consumer goods and services.\"<ref></ref>\n\nThe CPI is a statistical estimate constructed using the prices of a sample of\nrepresentative items whose prices are collected periodically. Sub-indexes and\nsub-sub-indexes are computed for different categories and sub-categories of\ngoods and services, being combined to produce the overall index with weights\nreflecting their shares in the total of the consumer expenditures covered by the\nindex. It is one of several price indices calculated by most national\nstatistical agencies. The annual percentage change in a CPI is used as a measure\nof inflation. A CPI can be used to index (i.e., adjust for the effect of\ninflation) the real value of wages, salaries, pensions, for regulating prices\nand for deflating monetary magnitudes to show changes in real values. In most\ncountries, the CPI is, along with the population census and the USA National\nIncome and Product Accounts, one of the most closely watched national economic\nstatistics.\n","title":"Consumer%20price%20index","headings":["Introduction","Weighting","Owner-occupiers and the price index","Consumer Price Indices in the United States","See also","References","Further reading","External links"]},"micro-relation":["6: Bureau_of_Labor_Statistics","3: Market_basket","2: National_Income_and_Product_Accounts","2: Cost_of_living_index","1: Final_goods","1: Consumer_Services","1: Price_index","1: Inflation","1: Pension","1: Census","1: Arithmetic_mean","1: Geometric_mean","1: Barcode_reader","1: Laspeyres_index","1: List_of_price_index_formulas","1: Price_index_","1: Harmonised_Index_of_Consumer_Prices","1: Retail_Price_Index","1: Imputed_rent","1: United_States","1: Cost_of_living","1: Social_Security_Administration","1: Erskine_Bowles","1: Alan_K._Simpson","1: National_Commission_on_Fiscal_Responsibility_and_Reform","1: NARFE","1: Robert_Reich","1: United_States_Secretary_of_Labor","1: Bill_Clinton_","1: Cost_of_living_adjustment#Cost-of-living_Adjustment_.28COLA.29","1: American_Taxpayer_Relief_Act_of_2012","1: Budget_sequestration","1: United_States_fiscal_cliff","1: Consumer_price_index_by_country","1: Core_inflation","1: Harmonized_Index_of_Consumer_Prices","1: Hedonic_regression","1: Higher_Education_Price_Index","1: Household_final_consumption_expenditure","1: GDP_deflator","1: Inflation_adjustment","1: Inflation_rate","1: Inflationism","1: List_of_economics_topics","1: MIT_Billion_Prices_project","1: Personal_consumption_expenditures_price_index","1: Producer_Price_Index","1: Quality_bias","1: RPIX","1: World_inflation_crisis","1: INSEE","1: Istituto_Nazionale_di_Statistica","1: Statistics_New_Zealand","1: Office_for_National_Statistics","1: U.S._Department_of_Labor"]}
