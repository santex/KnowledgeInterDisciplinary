The Victoria Cross is a military decoration awarded for valour \"in\nthe face of the enemy\" to members of armed forces of some Commonwealth countries\nand previous British Empire territories. The VC was introduced in Great Britain\non 29 January 1856 by Queen Victoria to reward acts of valour during the Crimean\nWar. It takes precedence over all other Orders, decorations and medals; it may\nbe awarded to a person of any rank in any service and to civilians under\nmilitary command. The first ceremony was held on 26 June 1857 where Queen\nVictoria invested 62 of the 111 Crimean recipients in Hyde Park. Ashcroft,\nMichael; preface; XI–XIII\n\nIn 1854, the Crimean War broke out between the Russian Empire and an alliance of\nFrance, Great Britain, the Kingdom of Sardinia and the Ottoman Empire. One of\nthe first battles of the War was the Battle of the Alma where allied forces\nconvincingly defeated the Russian forces. The Siege of Sevastapol followed\nshortly after in September 1854; it was to last for a year at the cost of over\n128,000 lives, three quarters of which died from disease. After the siege at\nSevastapol, the fighting mainly ceased and on 30 March 1856, after two years of\naction, the Russians negotiated a Peace Treaty at the Congress of Paris. The\nTreaty set the Black Sea as neutral territory, closing it to all warships, and\nprohibiting fortifications and the presence of armaments on its shores. The\nCrimean War led to a number of large-scale changes in the British Army. The sale\nof commissions came under great scrutiny during the war, especially in\nconnection with the Battle of Balaclava, which saw the ill-fated Charge of the\nLight Brigade. This scrutiny eventually led to the abolition of the\nsale of commissions.\n\nThe dispatches of William Howard Russell during the war highlighted how many\nacts of bravery and valour by British servicemen went unrewarded. Ashcroft, Michael; Preface to Victoria Cross Heroes There\nwas a growing feeling amongst the public and in the Royal Court that a new award\nwas needed to recognise incidents of gallantry that were unconnected with a\nman's lengthy or meritorious service. Queen Victoria issued a warrant under the\nRoyal sign-manual on 29 January 1856 The Gazette publishing the original Royal\nWarrant (gazetted 5 February 1856) that\nofficially constituted the VC. The order was backdated to 1854 to recognise acts\nof valour during the Crimean War. Ashcroft, Michael; pp.7–10 The\nfirst awards ceremony was held on 26 June 1857 where Queen Victoria invested 62\nof the 111 Crimean recipients in a ceremony in Hyde Park.\n\nCitations for the Crimean War, particularly those in the first gazette of 24\nFebruary 1857, listed multiple actions for about a third of the recipients. The\nformat of each citation varied between recipients, some specify the actual date,\nsome the name of the battle and others have both sets of information.\n\nUntil 1907, it was policy not to award the VC posthumously. Between 1857 and\n1901, nine notices were published in the [[London Gazette]] for soldiers who\nwould have been awarded the VC had they survived. In a partial reversal of\npolicy in 1902, medals were sent to the next of kin of the three mentioned for\nthe Boer War and at the same time the first three official posthumous awards,\nagain for the Boer War, were gazetted. In 1907, the posthumous policy was\ncompletely reversed and medals were sent to the next of kin of the remaining six\nofficers and men. As a result of the change of policy, one quarter of\nall awards for the First World War were posthumous but it was only in the\ngeneral revison of the warrant issued in 1920 that a clause was inserted to\nexplicity allow posthumous awards.
