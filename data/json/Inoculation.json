{"cursor":"19856","size":15,"audio":[],"cat":[],"tmpl":[],"currentlang":"en","linknr":276,"url":"Inoculation","article":"\n\n'Inoculation' is the placement of something that will grow or reproduce, and is\nmost commonly used in respect of the introduction of a serum, vaccine, or\nantigenic substance into the body of a human or animal, especially to produce or\nboost immunity to a specific disease. It can also be used to refer to the\ncommunication of a disease to a living organism by transferring its causative\nagent into the organism, the implanting of microorganisms or infectious material\ninto a culture medium such as a brewers vat or a petri dish, or the placement of\nmicroorganisms or viruses at a site where infection is possible. The verb to\ninoculate is from Middle English inoculaten, which meant \"to graft a scion\" (a\nplant part to be grafted onto another plant); which in turn is from Latin\ninoculare, past participle inoculat-\n. http://www.yourdictionary.com/ahd/i/i0154600.html\n\nThis article covers 'variolation', inoculation as a method of purposefully\ninfecting a person with smallpox (Variola) in a controlled manner so as to\nminimise the severity of the infection and also to induce immunity against\nfurther infection. See vaccination for post-variolation methods of safeguarding\nas if by inoculation by administering weakened or dead pathogens to a healthy\nperson or animal with the intent of conferring immunity against a targeted form\nof a related disease agent.\n\nToday the terms inoculation, vaccination and [[immunization]] are used more or\nless interchangeably and popularly refer to the process of artificial induction\nof immunity against various infectious diseases. The microorganism used in an\ninoculation is called the 'inoculant' or 'inoculum'.\n","recorded":1362124660,"portal":[],"list":[],"links":"277","instances":["politician","medical","disambiguation"],"pdf":["http://www.bmj.com/content/325/7361/430.full.pdf","http://www.bmj.com/content/325/7361/430.full.pdf"],"categories":["Immunology"],"headings":["Origins","Importation to the West","Mechanism","Supplanted by vaccination","See also","Notes","References","External links"],"tags":[["immunity","medical"],["edward_wortley_montagu","politician"],["onesimus","disambiguation"],["immunity","medical"],["immunity","medical"],["edward_wortley_montagu","politician"],["onesimus","disambiguation"],["immunity","medical"]],"image":["http://en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Variolation_vial_India.jpg","http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/93/Variolation_vial_India.jpg/170px-Variolation_vial_India.jpg","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Variolation_vial_India.jpg","http://bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Mary_Wortley_Montagu_by_Charles_Jervas,_after_1716.jpg","http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/Mary_Wortley_Montagu_by_Charles_Jervas%2C_after_1716.jpg/220px-Mary_Wortley_Montagu_by_Charles_Jervas%2C_after_1716.jpg","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Mary_Wortley_Montagu_by_Charles_Jervas,_after_1716.jpg","http://bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Inoculation_day_16.png","http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7b/Inoculation_day_16.png/220px-Inoculation_day_16.png","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Inoculation_day_16.png","http://bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","http://bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","http://bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"related":["Blood_serum","Vaccine","Antigen","Grafting","Infection","Smallpox","Immunity_(medical)","Vaccination","Artificial_induction_of_immunity","Disease","Dhanvantari","Vedic","What_the_Ancients_Did_for_Us","Microbe","Joseph_Needham","Robert_K._G._Temple","Song_Dynasty","Chancellor_of_China","Kaifeng","Mount_Emei","Sichuan","Daoism","Joseph_Needham","Longqing_Emperor","Ming_Dynasty","Mung_bean","Germination","Qing_Dynasty","Central_Asia","Lady_Mary_Wortley_Montagu","Edward_Wortley_Montagu_(politician)","Great_Britain","Ambassador","Ottoman_Empire","Istanbul","Sir_Hans_Sloane","George_I_of_Great_Britain","Newgate_prison","George_II_of_Great_Britain","Zabdiel_Boylston","Cotton_Mather","Boston","Onesimus_(disambiguation)","France","Voltaire","Mortality_rate","United_Kingdom","Edward_Jenner","Cowpox","Immunity_(medical)","Stress_inoculation","University_of_Chicago_Press","Royal_College_of_Physicians"],"members":["edward_wortley_montagu","immunity","onesimus"],"book":[]}
