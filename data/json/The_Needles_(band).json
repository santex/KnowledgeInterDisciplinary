Influenced heavily by 1960s\ngarage punk and late 70s new wave/powerpop, their first single on newly formed\nindie label Lithium Records attracted a great deal of attention for such a young\nband, and the follow-up \"We Got the Soul\" continued the momentum, garnering\npositive notices in the Melody Maker and NME, not to mention Radio 1 airplay.\n\nVarious delays and false dawns followed, and although they continued to release\nrecords for a good few years afterwards, switching to the better-funded\nDangerous Records, {{citation\n  | title = Dangerous Records url = http://www.dangerousrecords.co.uk/\n  | accessdate = October 9, 2010 work = Dangerous Records}} in 2002, this\n  | early momentum was never truly regained, although their last three singles,\n  | \"Dianne, Summer Girls and Girl I used to Know\", received a degree of\n  | exposure on MTV2, Radio 1, and XFM.\n\nThe band finally split to pursue new projects in 2007, and some of them went on\nto form the Hidden Masters {{citation\n  | title = Hidden Masters url = http://www.myspace.com/hiddenmasters accessdate\n  | = October 9, 2010 work = Myspace}} with Nic Denholm (ex-Owsley\n  | Sunshine/Uncle John & Whitelock) and late-period Needles bassist Alpha\n  | Mitchell, also previously of the Owsley Sunshine. Original bassist Paul\n  | Curtiss and keyboard player Nic Denholm later moved to London and formed The\n  | Snap Elect, {{citation title = The Snap Elect url =\n  | http://www.myspace.com/thesnapelect accessdate = October 9, 2010 work =\n  | Myspace}} a psychedelic-power pop four-piece that released one album,\n  | Mangled Angle Land, {{citation title = The Snap Elect - Mangled Angle\n  | Land (Limited Vinyl Album) url = http://www.puregroove.co.uk/products/The-Snap-Elect-%252d-Mangled-Angle-\n  | Land-%28Limited-Vinyl-Album%29.html accessdate = October 9, 2010 work = Pure\n  | Groove}} in November 2010.\n\nThe Needles recorded several sessions for the BBC, most notably for the Mark\nLamarr show on Radio 2 in 2006, and played their last gig with the original line-\nup at the South by Southwest music festival in Texas in 2007, before finally\nending later that year. Probably their finest moments on disc came with their\nfirst release \"Teenage Bomb\", the 7\"-only single \"Let You Down\", and the\ncompilation track \"Any Other Girl\".\n","linknr":135,"url":"The_Needles_(band)","recorded":1364132897,"links":["/w/index.php?title=The_Needles_(band)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=The_Needles_(band)&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Needles_(band)&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Template:Citation_needed","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability_(music)","/wiki/Wikipedia:Identifying_reliable_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:Merge","/wiki/Wikipedia:Redirect","/wiki/Wikipedia:Deletion_policy","http://www.google.com/search?as_eq=wikipedia&q=%22The+Needles+%28band%29%22&num=50","http://www.google.com/search?q=%22The+Needles+%28band%29%22&tbm=nws&tbs=ar:1","http://www.google.com/search?tbs=bks:1&q=%22The+Needles+%28band%29%22","http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22The+Needles+%28band%29%22","http://www.jstor.org/action/doBasicSearch?Query=%22The+Needles+%28band%29%22&acc=on&wc=on","http://images.google.com/images?safe=off&as_rights=(cc_publicdomain%7ccc_attribute%7ccc_sharealike%7ccc_noncommercial%7ccc_nonderived)&q=%22The+Needles+%28band%29%22","/wiki/Aberdeen","/wiki/Scotland","/wiki/Music_genre","/wiki/Punk_rock","/wiki/Rock_music","/wiki/Record_label","/wiki/Dangerous_Records","/wiki/Aberdeen","/wiki/Glasgow","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","#cite_note-1","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Uncle_John_%26_Whitelock","#cite_note-3","#cite_note-4","/wiki/Wikipedia:Avoid_weasel_words","#Discography","#Albums","#EPs_and_Singles","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=The_Needles_(band)&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=The_Needles_(band)&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=The_Needles_(band)&action=edit&section=3","/w/index.php?title=The_Needles_(band)&action=edit&section=4","#cite_ref-1","http://www.dangerousrecords.co.uk/","http://www.dangerousrecords.co.uk/","#cite_ref-2","http://www.myspace.com/hiddenmasters","http://www.myspace.com/hiddenmasters","#cite_ref-3","http://www.myspace.com/thesnapelect","http://www.myspace.com/thesnapelect","#cite_ref-4","http://www.puregroove.co.uk/products/The-Snap-Elect-%252d-Mangled-Angle-Land-%28Limited-Vinyl-Album%29.html","http://www.puregroove.co.uk/products/The-Snap-Elect-%252d-Mangled-Angle-Land-%28Limited-Vinyl-Album%29.html","/w/index.php?title=The_Needles_(band)&action=edit&section=5","http://www.theneedles.net","http://www.myspace.com/needlesuk","http://www.dangerousrecords.co.uk","http://www.contactmusic.com/new/home.nsf/webpages/theneedlesx11x09x06","http://www.channel4.com/music/features/interview.jsp?featureId=174","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Needles_(band)&oldid=535960730","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:British_punk_rock_groups","/wiki/Category:Articles_needing_additional_references_from_August_2010","/wiki/Category:All_articles_needing_additional_references","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_topics_of_unclear_notability_from_August_2010","/wiki/Category:All_articles_with_topics_of_unclear_notability","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_hCards","/wiki/Category:All_articles_with_unsourced_statements","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_unsourced_statements_from_February_2013","/wiki/Category:All_articles_with_specifically_marked_weasel-worded_phrases","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_specifically_marked_weasel-worded_phrases_from_February_2013","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=The+Needles+%28band%29&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=The+Needles+%28band%29","/wiki/The_Needles_(band)","/w/index.php?title=Talk:The_Needles_(band)&action=edit&redlink=1","#","/wiki/The_Needles_(band)","/w/index.php?title=The_Needles_(band)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=The_Needles_(band)&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirecto
