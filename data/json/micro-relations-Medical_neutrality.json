{"cursor":"86399","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Medical Neutrality' refers to a principle of noninterference with medical\nservices in times of armed conflict and civil unrest: physicians must be allowed\nto care for the sick and wounded, and soldiers must receive care regardless of\ntheir political affiliations; all parties must refrain from attacking and\nmisusing medical facilities, transport, and personnel. Concepts comprising the\nprinciples of medical neutrality derive from international human rights law,\nmedical ethics and humanitarian law. Medical neutrality may be thought of as a\nkind of social contract that obligates societies to protect medical personnel in\nboth times of war and peace, and obligates medical personnel to treat all\nindividuals regardless of religion, race, ethnicity, or political affiliation.\nViolations of medical neutrality constitute crimes outlined in the Geneva\nConventions.\n","linknr":218,"url":"Medical_neutrality","recorded":1362543077,"links":17,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/Military_Law/pdf/GC_1949-I.pdf","https://s3.amazonaws.com/PHR_Reports/el-salvador-health-care-under-siege.pdf","https://s3.amazonaws.com/PHR_Reports/Libya-WitnesstoWarCrimes-Aug2011.pdf","https://s3.amazonaws.com/PHR_Reports/panama-1987-health-cons.pdf","https://s3.amazonaws.com/PHR_Reports/syria-attacks-on-drs-patients-hospitals-final-2011.pdf","https://s3.amazonaws.com/PHR_Reports/bloody-may-bangkok-1992.pdf","http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-112hr2643ih/pdf/BILLS-112hr2643ih.pdf"],"categories":["Human rights","Medical ethics"],"headings":["Historical Background","Violations of Medical Neutrality","Recorded Historical Violations of Medical Neutrality","Organizations with a specific focus on medical neutrality","Medical Neutrality Protection Act of 2011 (H.R. 2643)","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Physicians","International_human_rights_law","Medical_ethics","Humanitarian_law","Geneva_Conventions","Geneva_Conventions","International_Committee_of_the_Red_Cross","First_Geneva_Convention","Geneva_Conventions","Red_Cross","First_Geneva_Convention","Declaration_of_Geneva","First_Chechen_War","ICRC_Hospital_of_Novye_Atagi","Salvadoran_Civil_War","Kamiar_and_Arash_Alaei_incident","Evin_prison","Physicians_for_Human_Rights","Libyan_civil_war","Physicians_for_Human_Rights","Gaddafi","Red_Crescent","Mozambican_Civil_War","RENAMO","Physicians_for_Human_Rights","Sri_Lankan_civil_war","Syrian_civil_war","Physicians_for_Human_Rights","Physicians_for_Human_Rights","Physicians_for_Human_Rights-Israel","Jim_McDermott","Walter_B._Jones,_Jr.","United_Nations_Special_Rapporteur"]}
