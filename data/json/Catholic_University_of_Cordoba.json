RSU emphasizes not only\nhaving civic engagement and community outreach activities, but having social\nresponsibility permeate every aspect of the university, including its\nadministration, teaching, research, and outreach. Under the RSU program, UCC\nrequires that each faculty submit a plan and list of social responsibility\nprojects that they will undertake in the coming year, either independently or in\ncollaboration with other academic units. This way, the university ensures that\nfaculty and students from across the university are involved.\n\nThe university also strongly encourages students and staff to volunteer their\ntime for community service projects through the âVolunteers - Universidad\nCatÃ³lica de CÃ³rdobaâ program. Working under the motto of âWe enter to learn,\ndepart to serve,â the VUCC is composed of students, teachers and young\nprofessionals who work in solidarity, integrating knowledge in an\ninterdisciplinary way to address various social problems, promote social\nawareness and a sense of solidarity, and acknowledge responsibility for the most\nvulnerable.\n\nThe Catholic University of Cordoba is part of the worldwide network of Jesuit\nuniversities, in over 90 countries and is an active member of the network of\nJesuit Universities of Latin America (AUSJAL).

Therefore, in addition to a current\ndisciplinary training, the University offers a solid liberal education through\nthe philosophical content, anthropological, ethical and theological in each
