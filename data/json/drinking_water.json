      "text" : "]] 'Drinking water' or 'potable water' is water safe enough to be consumed by\nhumans or used with low risk of immediate or long term harm. In most developed\ncountries, the water supplied to households, commerce and industry meets\ndrinking water standards, even though only a very small proportion is actually\nconsumed or used in food preparation. Typical uses (for other than potable\npurposes) include toilet flushing, washing and landscape irrigation.\n\nOver large parts of the world, humans have inadequate access to potable water\nand use sources contaminated with disease vectors, pathogens or unacceptable\nlevels of toxins or suspended solids. Drinking or using such water in food\npreparation leads to widespread acute and chronic illnesses and is a major cause\nof death and misery in many countries. Reduction of waterborne diseases is a\nmajor public health goal in developing countries.\n\nWater has always been an important and life-sustaining drink to humans and is\nessential to the survival of all known organisms.<ref name=\"bbc\"></ref>\nExcluding fat, water composes approximately 70% of the human body by mass. It is\na crucial component of metabolic processes and serves as a solvent for many\nbodily solutes. The United States Environmental Protection Agency in risk\nassessment calculations previously assumed that the average American adult\ningests 2.0&nbsp;litres per day.<ref name=\"epa\">U.S. Environmental Protection\nAgency (EPA).
