{"cursor":"3354","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Community health', a field of public health, is a discipline which concerns\nitself with the study and improvement of the health characteristics of\nbiological communities. While the term community can be broadly defined,\ncommunity health tends to focus on geographical areas rather than people with\nshared characteristics. The health characteristics of a community are often\nexamined using geographic information system (GIS) software and public health\ndatasets. Some projects, such as InfoShare or GEOPROJ combine GIS with existing\ndatasets, allowing the general public to examine the characteristics of any\ngiven community in participating countries.\n\nBecause 'health III' (broadly defined as well-being) is influenced by a wide\narray of socio-demographic characteristics, relevant variables range from the\nproportion of residents of a given age group to the overall life expectancy of\nthe neighbourhood/community. Medical interventions aimed at improving the health\nof a community range from improving access to medical care to public health\ncommunications campaigns. Recent research efforts have focused on how the built\nenvironment and socio-economic status affect health.\n\nCommunity health may be studied within three broad categories: *Primary\nhealthcare which refers to interventions that focus on the individual or family\nsuch as hand-washing, immunisation, circumcision *Secondary healthcare refers to\nthose activities which focus on the environment such as draining puddles of\nwater near the house, clearing bushes and spraying insecticides to control\nvectors like mosquitoes. *Tertiary healthcare on the other hand refers to those\ninterventions that take place in a hospital setting such as intravenous\nrehydration or surgery.\n\nsuccess of community health programmes relies upon the transfer of information\nfrom health professionals to the general public using one-to-one or one to many\ncommunication (Mass communication). The latest shift is towards Health\nmarketing.\n","linknr":204,"url":"Community_health","recorded":1371245530,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Community_health&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Community_health&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Public_health","/wiki/Community","/wiki/Geographic_information_system","/wiki/Public_health","/wiki/Socioeconomics","/wiki/Primary_healthcare","/wiki/Immunisation","/wiki/Circumcision","/w/index.php?title=Secondary_healthcare&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Tertiary_healthcare","/wiki/Intravenous","/wiki/Rehydration","/wiki/Surgery","/wiki/Mass_communication","/wiki/Health_marketing","#Academic_resources","#Notes","#See_also","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Community_health&action=edit&section=1","#cite_note-juh-1","/w/index.php?title=Community_health&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-juh_1-0","/wiki/Springer_Science%2BBusiness_Media","http://www.springerlink.com/content/119977/","/w/index.php?title=Community_health&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/Population_health","/wiki/Community_mental_health_service","/wiki/Online_health_communities","/wiki/Prison_reform","/w/index.php?title=Community_health&action=edit&section=4","http://www.press.jhu.edu/journals/progress_in_community_health_partnerships/index.html","http://www.infoshare.org/","http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/thegeocodingproject/webpage/monograph/","http://www.hapindia.org","http://www.cdc.gov/healthmarketing/whatishm.htm","/wiki/Template:Public_health","/wiki/Template_talk:Public_health","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Public_health&action=edit","/wiki/Public_health","/wiki/Auxology","/wiki/Biological_hazard","/wiki/Chief_Medical_Officer_(United_Kingdom)","/wiki/Deviance_(sociology)","/wiki/Environmental_health","/wiki/Public_health_genomics","/wiki/Globalization_and_disease","/wiki/Health_economics","/wiki/Health_literacy","/wiki/Health_policy","/wiki/Health_system","/wiki/Health_care_reform","/wiki/Public_health_law","/wiki/Maternal_health","/wiki/Medical_anthropology","/wiki/Medical_sociology","/wiki/Mental_health","/wiki/Pharmaceutical_policy","/wiki/Public_health_laboratory","/wiki/Reproductive_health","/wiki/Social_psychology","/wiki/Sociology_of_health_and_illness","/wiki/Tropical_disease","/wiki/Preventive_medicine","/wiki/Family_planning","/wiki/Health_promotion","/wiki/Human_nutrition","/wiki/Hygiene","/wiki/Hand_washing","/wiki/Food_safety","/wiki/Infection_control","/wiki/Oral_hygiene","/wiki/Occupational_safety_and_health","/wiki/Ergonomics","/wiki/Occupational_hygiene","/wiki/Injury_prevention","/wiki/Occupational_medicine","/wiki/Occupational_health_nursing","/wiki/Patient_safety","/wiki/Patient_safety_organization","/wiki/Pharmacovigilance","/wiki/Safe_sex","/wiki/Sanitation","/wiki/Community-led_total_sanitation","/wiki/Sanitary_sewer","/wiki/Waterborne_diseases","/wiki/Water_management","/wiki/Smoking_cessation","/wiki/Vaccination","/wiki/Vector_control","/wiki/Population_health","/wiki/Biostatistics","/wiki/Epidemiology","/wiki/Global_health","/wiki/Health_impact_assessment","/wiki/Category:Health_software","/wiki/Health_system","/wiki/Public_health_informatics","/wiki/Social_determinants_of_health","/wiki/Health_equity","/wiki/Race_and_health","/wiki/Social_medicine","/wiki/World_Health_Organization","/wiki/European_Centre_for_Disease_Prevention_and_Control","/wiki/Committee_on_the_Environment,_Public_Health_and_Food_Safety","/wiki/Ministry_of_Health_and_Family_Welfare_(India)","/wiki/United_States_Public_Health_Service","/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention","/wiki/Council_on_Education_for_Public_Health","/wiki/Public_Health_%E2%80%93_Seattle_%26_King_County","/wiki/World_Toilet_Organization","/wiki/Globalization_and_Health","/wiki/Health_education","/wiki/Bachelor_of_Science_in_Public_Health","/wiki/Professional_degrees_of_public_health","/wiki/Professional_degrees_of_public_health","/wiki/European_Programme_for_Intervention_Epidemiology_Training","/wiki/Professional_Further_Education_in_Clinical_Pharmacy_and_Public_Health","/wiki/Sara_Josephine_Baker","/wiki/Samuel_Jay_Crumbine","/wiki/Carl_Rogers_Darnall","/wiki/Joseph_Lister,_1st_Baron_Lister","/wiki/Margaret_Sanger","/wiki/John_Snow_(physician)","/wiki/Typhoid_Mary","/wiki/Germ_t
