Under the inclusion model, students with special needs spend\nmost or all of their time with non-disabled students. Implementation of these\npractices varies. Schools most frequently use them for selected students with\nmild to severe special needs.\n\nInclusive education differs from previously held notions of\n[[:wikt:integration|integration]] and mainstreaming, which tended to be\nconcerned principally with disability and âspecial educational needsâ and\nimplied learners changing or becoming âready forâ or deserving of accommodation\nby the mainstream. By contrast, inclusion is about the childâs right to\nparticipate and the schoolâs duty to accept the child. Inclusion rejects the use\nof special schools or classrooms to separate students with disabilities from\nstudents without disabilities. A premium is placed upon full participation by\nstudents with disabilities and upon respect for their social, civil, and\neducational rights. Inclusion gives students with disabilities skill they can\nuse in and out of the classroom. âStudents learn the importance of\nindividual and group contributions and develop valuable life skills that are\noften unexplored in less inclusive settingsâ (Tapasak 216).
