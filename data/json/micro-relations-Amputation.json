As a surgical measure, it is used to control pain or a\ndisease process in the affected limb, such as malignancy or gangrene. In some\ncases, it is carried out on individuals as a preventative surgery for such\nproblems. A special case is that of congenital amputation, a congenital\ndisorder, where fetal limbs have been cut off by constrictive bands. In some\ncountries, amputation of the hands, feet or other body parts is or was used as a\nform of punishment for people who committed crimes. Amputation has also been\nused as a tactic in war and acts of terrorism; it may also occur as a war\ninjury. In some cultures and religions, minor amputations or mutilations are\nconsidered a ritual accomplishment. Unlike some non-mammalian animals (such as\nlizards that shed their tails, salamanders that can regrow many missing body\nparts, and hydras, flatworms, and starfish that can regrow entire bodies from\nsmall fragments), once removed, human extremities do not grow back, unlike\nportions of some organs, such as the liver. A transplant or a prosthesis are the\nonly options for recovering the loss.\n\nIn the US, the majority of new amputations occur due to complications of the\nvascular system (the blood vessels), especially from diabetes. Between 1988 and\n1996, there were an average of 133,735 hospital discharges for amputation per\nyear in the US.
