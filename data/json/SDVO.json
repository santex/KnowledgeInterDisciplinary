{"cursor":"8341","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Serial Digital Video Out' ('SDVO') is a proprietary Intel technology introduced\nwith their 9xx-series of motherboard chipsets.\n\nSDVO makes it possible to use a 16-lane PCI express slot to add additional video\nsignalling interfaces such as VGA and DVI monitor outputs, SDTV and HDTV\ntelevision outputs, or TV tuner inputs to a system board containing an\nintegrated Intel 9xx-series graphics processor.\n\nSDVO adaptor cards are variously designated as 'ADD2' (advanced digital display,\nsecond generation) or the more feature-rich 'MEC' (media expansion card). MEC is\nsometimes designated as 'ADD2+' in Intel documents.\n\nIntel often refers to SDVO as 'Serial DVO' to distinguish it from other forms of\ndigital video out associated with prior product generations, such as the AGP\nimplementation of DVO and older AGP-style ADD expansion cards which are not SDVO\ncompatible. \n","linknr":165,"url":"SDVO","recorded":1362688657,"links":14,"instances":["form_factor"],"pdf":["http://download.intel.com/design/chipsets/applnots/30762001.pdf"],"categories":["Intel products"],"headings":["Proprietary status","Applications","ADD and MEC form factors","Intel chipsets supporting SDVO","GMA X3000","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["btx","form_factor"]],"members":["btx"],"related":["Intel","List_of_Intel_chipsets","PCI_express","Video_Graphics_Array","Digital_Visual_Interface","Standard-definition_television","High-definition_television","Feature-rich","Digital_video_out","Accelerated_Graphics_Port","Integrated_Graphics_Processor","Open_source","PCI_express","TV-out","Low-voltage_differential_signaling","Accelerated_Graphics_Port","ATX","BTX_(form_factor)","Intel_GMA","Composite_video","Transition_Minimized_Differential_Signaling","Low-voltage_differential_signaling","Video_Graphics_Array","High-definition_television","High-Definition_Multimedia_Interface","Unified_Display_Interface"]}
