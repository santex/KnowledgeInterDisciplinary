{"cursor":"12908","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n]]\n\nA 'passing loop' (also called a 'passing siding', 'crossing loop', 'crossing\nplace' or, colloquially, a 'hole') is a place on a single line railway or\ntramway, often located at a station, where trains or trams travelling in\nopposite directions can pass each other. Trains/trams going in the\nsame direction can also overtake, providing that the signalling arrangement\nallows it. A passing loop is double ended and connected to the main track at\nboth ends, though a dead end siding known as a refuge siding, which is much less\nconvenient, can be used. A similar arrangement is used on the gauntlet track of\ncable railways and funiculars, and in passing places on single-track roads.\n\nIdeally, the loop should be longer than all trains needing to cross at that\npoint. If one train is too long for the loop it must wait for the opposing train\nto enter the loop before proceeding, taking a few minutes. Ideally, the shorter\ntrain should arrive first and leave second. If both trains are too long for the\nloop, time-consuming \"see-sawing\" (or \"double saw-by\") operations are required\nfor the trains to cross. [http://www.sdmrra.org/Odds-n-Ends/saw_bye.htm\n\"double saw-by\"]\n\nOn railway systems that use platforms for passengers to board and disembark\ntrains, especially high level platforms, platforms may be provided on both main\nand loop tracks or possibly only one of them.\n","linknr":331,"url":"Passing_loop","recorded":1362564917,"links":39,"instances":["rail","rail","railway","new_south_wales"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Railway track layouts"],"headings":["System of working","Simultaneous crosses and passing lanes","Overlaps and Catchpoints","Automatic operation","Gradients","Train length","Line capacity","Double lines","Accidents at crossing loops","Other names","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Ambox_globe_content.svg/48px-Ambox_globe_content.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8f/Penryn_trains_passing_2_%28cropped%29.jpg/300px-Penryn_trains_passing_2_%28cropped%29.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/80/Crossing_Loop_-_Main_and_Loop_Working.png/300px-Crossing_Loop_-_Main_and_Loop_Working.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/17/Crossing_Loop_-_Platform_Road_%26_Through_Road_Working.svg/300px-Crossing_Loop_-_Platform_Road_%26_Through_Road_Working.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Crossing_Loop_-_Up_and_Down_Working.png/300px-Crossing_Loop_-_Up_and_Down_Working.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/CaseyJonesStamp.png/300px-CaseyJonesStamp.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d3/Quintinshill_rail_crash.svg/934px-Quintinshill_rail_crash.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["single_track","rail"],["single_track","rail"],["fish_river","new_south_wales"],["spiral","railway"],["siding","rail"]],"members":["single_track","siding","spiral","fish_river"],"related":["Single_track_(rail)","Tram","Railway_station","Train","Tram","Railway_signalling","Refuge_siding","Gauntlet_track","Cable_railway","Funicular","Passing_place","Single-track_road","Railway_platform","Railroad_switch","Scone_railway_station","Island_platform","Side_platforms","Bombo_railway_station,_New_South_Wales","Molong","Berry,_New_South_Wales","AusLink","Junee","Melbourne","Track_duplication","Sweden","Norway","High-speed_rail_in_Norway","Catchpoints","Australian_Rail_Track_Corporation","Track_circuit","Centralized_traffic_control","Catchpoints","Tumulla_railway_station,_New_South_Wales","Dombarton,_New_South_Wales","Australia","Single_track_(rail)","Ruling_grade","Cowan_Bank","Razorback","Fish_River_(New_South_Wales)","Cullerin,_New_South_Wales","Catchpoints","Centralized_traffic_control","Longest_trains","Multiplicative_inverse","Refuge_siding","United_States_Postal_Service","Vaughan,_Mississippi","Casey_Jones","Dugald,_Manitoba","Signal_passed_at_danger","Double_track","Spiral_(railway)","Balloon_loop","Lists_of_rail_accidents","Refuge_siding","Siding_(rail)","Glossary_of_North_American_railway_terminology"]}
