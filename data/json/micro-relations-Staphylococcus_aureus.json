Although S.\naureus is not always pathogenic, it is a common cause of skin infections (e.g.\nboils), respiratory disease (e.g. sinusitis), and food poisoning. Disease-\nassociated strains often promote infections by producing potent protein toxins,\nand expressing cell-surface proteins that bind and inactivate antibodies. The\nemergence of antibiotic-resistant forms of pathogenic S. aureus (e.g. MRSA) is a\nworldwide problem in clinical medicine.\n\n'Staphylococcus' was first identified in Aberdeen, Scotland (1880) by the\nsurgeon Sir Alexander Ogston in pus from a surgical abscess in a knee joint. This name was later appended to\n'Staphylococcus aureus' by Rosenbach who was credited by the official system of\nnomenclature at the time. It is estimated that 20% of the human population are\nlong-term carriers of S. aureus  which can be\nfound as part of the normal skin flora and in anterior nares of the nasal\npassages. S. aureus is the\nmost common species of staphylococcus to cause ''Staph'' infections and is a\nsuccessful pathogen due to a combination of nasal carriage and bacterial immuno-\nevasive strategies.\nS. aureus can cause a range of illnesses, from minor skin infections, such as\n   pimples, impetigo, boils (furuncles), cellulitis folliculitis, carbuncles,\n   scalded skin syndrome, and abscesses, to life-threatening diseases such as\n   pneumonia, meningitis, osteomyelitis, endocarditis, toxic shock syndrome\n   (TSS), bacteremia, and sepsis. Its incidence ranges from skin, soft tissue,\n   respiratory, bone, joint, endovascular to wound infections. It is still one\n   of the five most common causes of nosocomial infections and is often the\n   cause of postsurgical wound infections. Each year, some 500,000 patients in\n   American hospitals contract a staphylococcal infection.\n\n{{Infobox disease\n | Name = Staphylococcus aureus ICD9
