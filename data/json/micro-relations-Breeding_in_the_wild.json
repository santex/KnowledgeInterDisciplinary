This terminology is distinct from\nanimal husbandry or breeding of species in captivity. Breeding locations are\noften chosen for very specific requirements of shelter and proximity to food;\nmoreover, the breeding season is a particular time window that has evolved for\neach species to suit species anatomical, climatic and other ecological temporal\nevents. M.F. Braby, 2004 Many species migrate considerable distances\nto reach the requisite breeding locations. M.L.
