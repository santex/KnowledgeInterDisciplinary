(1.38 MB, ogg/Theora format).]]\n\n'Gravitation', or 'gravity', is the natural phenomenon by which physical\nbodies appear to attract each other with a force proportional to their\nmasses. It is most commonly experienced as the agent that gives weight to\nobjects with mass and causes them to fall to the ground when dropped. The\nphenomenon of gravitation itself, however, is a byproduct of a more\nfundamental phenomenon described by general relativity, which suggests that\nspacetime is curved according to the energy and momentum of whatever matter\nand radiation are present.\n\nGravitation is one of the four fundamental interactions of nature, along with\nelectromagnetism, and the nuclear strong force and weak force. In modern\nphysics, the phenomenon of gravitation is most accurately described by the\ngeneral theory of relativity by Einstein, in which the phenomenon itself is a\nconsequence of the curvature of spacetime governing the motion of inertial\nobjects. The simpler Newton's law of universal gravitation provides an accurate\napproximation for most physical situations including calculations as critical as\nspacecraft trajectory.\n\nFrom a cosmological perspective, gravitation causes dispersed matter to\ncoalesce, and coalesced matter to remain intact, thus accounting for the\nexistence of planets, stars, galaxies and most of the macroscopic objects in the\nuniverse. It is responsible for keeping the Earth and the other planets in their\norbits around the Sun; for keeping the Moon in its orbit around the Earth; for\nthe formation of tides; for natural convection, by which fluid flow occurs under\nthe influence of a density gradient and gravity; for heating the interiors of\nforming stars and planets to very high temperatures; and for various other\nphenomena observed on Earth and throughout the universe.\n","linknr":807,"url":"Gravitation","recorded":1362485650,"links":231,"instances":["planet","mathematics","satellite","general_relativity","general_relativity","physicist"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Gravitation|","Empirical
