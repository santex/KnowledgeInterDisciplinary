Its\nscience and engineering counterpart is the National Science Foundation. It\ncomprises 27 separate institutes, centers, and offices which includes the Office\nof the Director. Francis S. Collins is the current Director.\n\nAs of 2003, the NIH was responsible for 28%âabout US$26.4 billionâof the total\nbiomedical research funding spent annually in the U.S., with most of the rest\ncoming from industry.\n\nThe NIH's research is divided into two parts: the NIH Extramural Research\nProgram is responsible for the funding of biomedical research outside the NIH,\nwhile the NIH Intramural Research Program (IRP) is the internal research program\nof the NIH, known for its synergistic approach to biomedical science. http://sourcebook.od.nih.gov/oversight/NIH-\nIRP_Redbook.pdf With 1,200 principal investigators and more than 4,000\npostdoctoral fellows in basic, translational, and clinical research, the IRP is\nthe largest biomedical research institution on earth. http://irp.nih.gov/about-us/organization-and-\nleadership The unique funding environment of the IRP facilitates\nopportunities to conduct both long-term and high-impact science that would\notherwise be difficult to undertake. With rigorous external reviews ensuring\nthat only the most innovative research secures funding, Blue Ribbon Panel\nReviews http://sourcebook.od.nih.gov/sci-review/blue-ribbon-toc.htm the\nIRP is responsible for many scientific accomplishments, including the discovery\nof fluoride to prevent tooth decay, the use of lithium to manage bipolar\ndisorder, and the creation of vaccines against hepatitis, [[Haemophilus\ninfluenzae]] (HIB), and human papillomavirus. NIH Sourcebook\nhttp://sourcebook.od.nih.gov/oir/IRP_transition.pdf Intramural research is\nprimarily conducted at the main campus in Bethesda, Maryland, and the\nsurrounding communities. The National Institute on Aging and the National\nInstitute on Drug Abuse are located in Baltimore, Maryland, and the National\nInstitute of Environmental Health Sciences is located in the Research Triangle\nregion of North Carolina. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious\nDiseases (NIAID) maintains its Rocky Mountain Labs in Hamilton, Montana, [http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/about/organization/dir/overview.htm About\nNIAID]\" (accessed January 14, 2007). National Institute of Allergy and\nInfectious Diseases. with an emphasis on virology.\n\nThe goal of NIH research is to acquire new knowledge to help prevent, detect,\ndiagnose, and treat disease and disability, from the rarest genetic disorder to\nthe common cold. The NIH mission is to uncover new knowledge that will lead to\nbetter health for everyone. NIH works toward that mission by conducting research\nin its own laboratories, supporting the research of non-federal scientists (in\nuniversities, medical schools, hospitals, and research institutions throughout\nthe country and abroad), helping in the training of research investigators, and\nfostering communication of medical and health sciences information.\n","linknr":757,"url":"National_Institutes_of_Health","recorded":1362506413,"links":84,"instances":["biology","sense","biology"],"pdf":["http://sourcebook.od.nih.gov/oversight/NIH-IRP_Redbook.pdf","http://sourcebook.od.nih.gov/oir/IRP_transition.pdf","http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL33695.pdf","http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL33695.pdf","http://officeofbudget.od.nih.gov/pdfs/FY13/spending%20list/Mechanism%20Detail%20for%20Total%20NIH%20FY%202000%20-%20FY%202011.pdf","http://officeofbudget.od.nih.gov/pdfs/FY13/spending%20list/Mechanism%20Detail%20for%20Total%20NIH%20FY%202000%20-%20FY%202011.pdf","http://opa.faseb.org/pdf/2008/nih_research_benefits.pdf","http://opa.faseb.org/pdf/2008/nih_research_benefits.pdf","http://oig.hhs.gov/oas/reports/region3/31003120.pdf","http://oig.hhs.gov/oas/reports/region3/31003120.pdf","http://oig.hhs.gov/oas/reports/region3/31003117.pdf","http://oig.hhs.gov/oas/reports/region3/31003117.pdf","http://oig.hhs.gov/oas/reports/region3/31003119.pdf","http://oig.hhs.gov/oas/reports/region3/31003119.pdf","http://oig.hhs.gov/oas/reports/region3/31003115.pdf","http://oig.hhs.gov/oas/reports/region3/31003115.pdf","http://oig.hhs.gov/oas/reports/region3/31003106.pdf","http://oig.hhs.gov/oas/reports/region3/31003106.pdf","http://oig.hhs.gov/oas/reports/region3/31003104.pdf","http://oig.hhs.gov/oas/reports/region3/31003104.pdf","http://oig.hhs.gov/oas/reports/region3/31003118.pdf","http://oig.hhs.gov/oas/reports/region3/31003118.pdf","http://oig.hhs.gov/oas/reports/region3/31003116.pdf","http://oig.hhs.gov/oas/reports/region3/31003116.pdf"],"categories":["Medical
