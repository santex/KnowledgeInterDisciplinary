Elementary examples of such relations include the\ndot product, the cross product, and linear maps. Vectors and scalars themselves\nare also tensors. A tensor can be represented as a multi-dimensional array of\nnumerical values. The order (also degree or rank) of a tensor is the\ndimensionality of the array needed to represent it, or equivalently, the number\nof indices needed to label a component of that array. For example, a linear map\ncan be represented by a matrix, a 2-dimensional array, and therefore is a 2nd-\norder tensor. A vector can be represented as a 1-dimensional array and is a 1st-\norder tensor. Scalars are single numbers and are thus 0th-order tensors.\n\nTensors are used to represent correspondences between sets of geometric\nvectors. For example, the stress tensor 'T' takes a direction 'v' as input and\nproduces the stress 'T'<sup>(v)</sup> on the surface normal to this vector for\noutput thus expressing a relationship between these two vectors, shown in the\nfigure (right).\n\nBecause they express a relationship between vectors, tensors themselves must be\nindependent of a particular choice of coordinate system. Taking a coordinate\nbasis or frame of reference and applying the tensor to it results in an\norganized multidimensional array representing the tensor in that basis, or like\nit looks from that frame of reference. The coordinate independence of a tensor\nthen takes the form of a \"covariant\" transformation law that relates the array\ncomputed in one coordinate system to that computed in another one. This\ntransformation law is considered to be built into the notion of a tensor in a\ngeometric or physical setting, and the precise form of the transformation law\ndetermines the type (or valence) of the tensor.\n\nTensors are important in physics because they provide a concise mathematical\nframework for formulating and solving physics problems in areas such as\nelasticity, fluid mechanics, and general relativity. Tensors were first\nconceived by Tullio Levi-Civita and Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro, who continued the\nearlier work of Bernhard Riemann and Elwin Bruno Christoffel and others, as part\nof the absolute differential calculus. The concept enabled an alternative\nformulation of the intrinsic differential geometry of a manifold in the form of\nthe Riemann curvature tensor.<ref name=\"Kline\"></ref>\n","title":"tensor","headings":["History","Definition","Examples","Notation","Operations","Applications","Generalizations","See also","Notes","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["4: Inner_product","3: Riemann_curvature_tensor","2: Cross_product","2: Euclidean_vector","2: Tullio_Levi-Civita","2: Gregorio_Ricci-Curbastro","2: Differential_geometry","2: General_relativity","2: Continuum_mechanics","2: Metric_tensor","2: Covariance_and_contravariance_of_vectors","2: Einstein_summation_convention","2: Tensor_field","2: Partial_derivative","2: Multilinear_map","2: Tensor_product","2: 1-form","2: Multivector","2: Bilinear_form","2: Elasticity_tensor","2: Volume_form","2: Covariant_derivative","2: Strain_tensor","1: Geometry","1: Linear_relation","1: Euclidean_vectors","1: Dot_product","1: Linear_map","1: Array_data_structure#Multidimensional_arrays","1: Coordinate-free","1: Coordinate_system","1: Basis_of_a_vector_space","1: Frame_of_reference","1: Covariant_transformation","1: Bernhard_Riemann","1: Elwin_Bruno_Christoffel","1: Manifold","1: Carl_Friedrich_Gauss","1: Algebraic_form","1: William_Rowan_Hamilton","1: Clifford_algebra","1: Woldemar_Voigt","1: Albert_Einstein","1: Marcel_Grossmann","1: Quadratic_form","1: Exterior_algebra","1: Hermann_Grassmann","1: Differential_form","1: Élie_Cartan","1: Algebraic_topology","1: Künneth_theorem","1: Abstract_algebra","1: Homological_algebra","1: Representation_theory","1: Category_theory","1: Monoidal_category","1: Euclidean_vector#Representations","1: Matrix_inverse","1: Vector_space","1: Dual_space","1: Universal_property","1: Bijection","1: Exterior_product","1: Graded_algebra","1: Parallelotope","1: Coordinate_surface","1: Scalar_curvature","1: Direction_vector","1: Bivector","1: Covector","1: Linear_functional","1: Linear_transformation","1: Kronecker_delta","1: Ricci_curvature","1: 2-form","1: Symplectic_form","1: Ricci_calculus","1: Outer_product","1: Summation","1: Symmetric_tensor","1: Antisymmetric_tensor","1: Summation_sign","1: Penrose_graphical_notation","1: Abstract_index_notation","1: Scalar_multiplication","1: Tensor_contraction","1: Solid_body","1: Fluid","1: Type_of_a_tensor","1: Linear_elasticity","1: Electromagnetic_tensor","1: Electromagnetism","1: Finite_deformation_tensors","1: Permittivity","1: Electric_susceptibility","1: Anisotropic","1: Four-tensors","1: Stress-energy_tensor","1: Momentum","1: Flux","1: Angular_momentum_operator","1: Spherical_coordinates","1: Diffusion_Tensor_Imaging","1: Quantum_Mechanics","1: Quantum_Computing","1: Computer_vision","1: Trifocal_tensor","1: Nonlinear_optics","1: Polarization_density#Relation_between_P_and_E_in_various_materials","1: Electric_field","1: Taylor_series","1: Pockels_effect","1: Second_harmonic_generation","1: Kerr_effect","1: Tensor_product_of_Hilbert_spaces","1: Hilbert_space","1: Nonlinear_system","1: Algebraic_dual","1: Banach_space","1: Continuous_dual","1: Banach_manifold","1: Jacobian_matrix_and_determinant","1: Density_bundle","1: Vector_bundle","1: Tangent_bundle","1: Line_bundle","1: Orientable_manifold","1: Density_on_a_manifold","1: Orthonormality","1: Orientation_entanglement","1: Plate_trick","1: Special_orthogonal_group","1: Simply_connected","1: Spinor","1: Cartesian_tensor","1: Fibre_bundle","1: Glossary_of_tensor_theory","1: Multilinear_subspace_learning#Multilinear_projection","1: One-form","1: Tensor_product_of_modules","1: Application_of_tensor_theory_in_engineering","1: Curvature","1: Diffusion_MRI#Mathematical_foundation—tensors","1: Einstein_field_equations","1: Fluid_mechanics","1: Multilinear_subspace_learning","1: Riemannian_geometry","1: Structure_Tensor","1: Tensor_decomposition","1: Tensor_derivative","1: Tensor_software","1: NASA"]}
