{"cursor":"9595","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nAn 'epoxide' is a cyclic ether with three ring atoms. This ring approximately\ndefines an equilateral triangle, which makes it highly strained. The strained\nring makes epoxides more reactive than other ethers. Simple epoxides are named\nfrom the parent compound ethylene oxide or oxirane, such as in\nchloromethyloxirane. As a functional group, epoxides feature the epoxy prefix,\nsuch as in the compound 1,2-epoxycycloheptane, which can also be called\ncycloheptene epoxide, or simply cycloheptene oxide. , a common chemical\nintermediate]] A polymer formed by reacting epoxide units is called a\npolyepoxide or an [[epoxy]]. Epoxy resins are used as adhesives and structural\nmaterials. Polymerization of an epoxide gives a polyether, for example ethylene\noxide polymerizes to give polyethylene glycol, also known as polyethylene oxide.\n","linknr":307,"url":"epoxide","recorded":1362900213,"links":38,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Functional groups","Epoxides|"],"headings":["Synthesis","Reactions","Perepoxides","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/25/Epoxide_generic.png/220px-Epoxide_generic.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ea/Glycidol.svg/220px-Glycidol.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6d/PrilezhaevReaction.svg/326px-PrilezhaevReaction.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/ButterflyMech.svg/328px-ButterflyMech.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/Methyloxirane_from_2-chloroproprionic_acid.png/400px-Methyloxirane_from_2-chloroproprionic_acid.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/07/EpoxOpen.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/De-epoxidation.svg/400px-De-epoxidation.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Ether","Equilateral_triangle","Ring_strain","Ethylene_oxide","Functional_group","Polymer","Adhesive","Polyether","Ethylene_oxide","Polyethylene_glycol","Ethylene_oxide","Propylene_oxide","Oxygen","Stoichiometry","Propylene","Alkenes","Peroxide","Hydrogen_peroxide","Dimethyldioxirane","T-butyl_hydroperoxide","Ethylbenzene","Prilezhaev_reaction","Peroxyacid","Meta-Chloroperoxybenzoic_acid","Styrene","Perbenzoic_acid","Styrene_oxide","Electrophile","Nucleophile","Enantioselective","Sharpless_epoxidation","Jacobsen_epoxidation","Shi_epoxidation","Oxaziridine","Williamson_ether_synthesis","Alkoxide_ion","Halohydrin","2-chloropropanol","Propylene_oxide","Darzens_reaction","Johnson-Corey-Chaykovsky_reaction","Carbonyl","Sulfonium_ylide","Enone","Acrylic_acid","Nucleophilic_conjugate_addition","Orbital_hybridisation","Stereogenic","Diastereomer","Sharpless_epoxidation","Jacobsen_epoxidation","Waits–Scheffer_epoxidation","Juliá-Colonna_Epoxidation","Organic_reaction","Nucleophilic_addition","Carbocation","Hydrolysis","Acid_catalyst","Glycol","Hydrolysis","Nucleophilic_addition","Acid_catalysis","Organic_reduction","Lithium_aluminium_hydride","Water","Alcohol","Tungsten_hexachloride","N-Butyllithium","Alkene","Amine","Epoxy","Triethylenetetramine","Isoelectronic","Episulfide","Photosensitizer","Drying_oil","Singlet_oxygen","Hydroperoxide","Polyether","Epoxide_hydrolase","Juliá-Colonna_epoxidation","Johnson-Corey-Chaykovsky_reaction"]}
