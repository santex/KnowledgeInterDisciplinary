{"cursor":"8380","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":":\n'Phlegm' (; \"inflammation, humour caused by heat\") is a liquid secreted by the\nmucous membranes of mammalians. Its definition is limited to the mucus produced\nby the respiratory system, excluding that from the nasal passages, and\nparticularly that which is expelled by coughing (sputum). Phlegm is in essence a\nwater-based gel consisting of glycoproteins, immunoglobulins, lipids and other\nsubstances. Its composition varies depending on climate, genetics, and state of\nthe immune system. Its color can vary from transparent to pale or dark yellow\nand green, from light to dark brown, and even to dark grey depending on the\nconstituents.\n","linknr":221,"url":"Phlegm","recorded":1362372193,"links":34,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.sciencemag.org/content/172/3984/741.full.pdf"],"categories":["Body fluids","Symptoms and signs"],"headings":["Distinction between mucus and phlegm","Excessive phlegm creation","Illnesses related to phlegm","Phlegm and humourism","Other concepts","References","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a2/Phlegm.jpg/220px-Phlegm.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Liquid","Mucous_membrane","Mammal","Mucus","Respiratory_system","Human_nose","Cough","Sputum","Glycoproteins","Immunoglobulins","Lipids","Climate","Genetics","Immune_system","Nasal_turbinate","Urogenital_tract","Viscoelastic_gel","Submucosal_glands","Goblet_cells","Glycoproteins","Linear_polymers","Sputum","Larynx","Vocal_fold_nodule","American_College_of_Chest_Physicians","Chronic_Obstructive_Pulmonary_Disease","Acute_bronchitis","Bronchioles","Larva","Intestinal_parasite","Hookworm","Hemoptysis","Tuberculosis","Bronchitis","Humourism","Four_humours","Classical_element","Melancholia","Yellow_bile","Blood","Hippocrates","Ancient_Greece","Apathetic","Phlegmatic","William_Osler"]}
