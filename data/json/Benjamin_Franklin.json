The provisions of the British Calendar\n(New Style) Act 1750, implemented in 1752, altered the official British dating\nmethod to the Gregorian calendar with the start of the year on January 1 (it had\nbeen March 25). These changes resulted in dates being moved forward 11 days, and\nfor those between January 1 and March 25, an advance of one year. For a further\nexplanation, see: Old Style and New Style dates.

As a\nscientist, he was a major figure in the American Enlightenment and the history\nof physics for his discoveries and theories regarding electricity. He invented\nthe lightning rod, bifocals, the Franklin stove, a carriage odometer, and the\nglass 'armonica'. He facilitated many civic organizations, including\na fire department and a university.\n\nFranklin earned the title of \"The First American\" for his early and\nindefatigable campaigning for colonial unity; as an author and spokesman in\nLondon for several colonies, then as the first United States Ambassador to\nFrance, he exemplified the emerging American nation. H.W. Brands, The\nFirst American: The Life and Times of Benjamin Franklin (2000) Franklin\nwas foundational in defining the American ethos as a marriage of the\npractical values of thrift, hard work, education, community spirit, self-\ngoverning institutions, and opposition to authoritarianism both political and\nreligious, with the scientific and tolerant values of the Enlightenment. In\nthe words of historian Henry Steele Commager, \"In a Franklin could be merged\nthe virtues of Puritanism without its defects, the illumination of the\nEnlightenment without its heat.\" Isaacson 2003, p. 491 To Walter\nIsaacson, this makes Franklin \"the most accomplished American of his age and\nthe most influential in inventing the type of society America would\nbecome.\" Isaacson 2003, p. 492\n\nFranklin, always proud of his working class roots, became a successful newspaper\neditor and printer in Philadelphia, the leading city in the colonies.

He\nplayed a major role in establishing the University of Pennsylvania and was\nelected the first president of the American Philosophical Society. Franklin\nbecame a national hero in America when he spearheaded the effort to have\nParliament repeal the unpopular Stamp Act. An accomplished diplomat, he was\nwidely admired among the French as American minister to Paris and was a major\nfigure in the development of positive Franco-American relations.\n\nFor many years he was the British postmaster for the colonies, which enabled him\nto set up the first national communications network. He was active in community\naffairs, colonial and state politics, as well as national and international\naffairs. From 1785 to 1788, he served as governor of Pennsylvania.
