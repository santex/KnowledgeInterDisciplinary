Coale, MA; Robert R. Redman, MA, JAMA. 1987;258(7):936-\n 940, is a United States-based nonprofit tax-exempt 501(c)\n organization that accredits more than 19,000 health care\n organizations and programs in the United States. {{cite web |url=\n http://www.ashe.org/ashe/codes/jcaho/background.html|title= American Society\n for Healthcare Engineering}} A majority of state governments have come to\n recognize Joint Commission accreditation as a condition of licensure and the\n receipt of Medicaid reimbursement. Surveys (inspections) typically follow a\n triennial cycle, with findings made available to the public in an accreditation\n quality report on the Quality Check Web site.\n\nThe declared mission of the organization is 'To continuously improve health care\nfor the public, in collaboration with other stakeholders, by evaluating health\ncare organizations and inspiring them to excel in providing safe and effective\ncare of the highest quality and value.\" [http://www.jointcommi-\nssion.org/AboutUs/Fact_Sheets/joint_commission_facts.htm Facts About The Joint\nCommission], The Joint Commission Web site\n\nThe Joint Commission was renamed Joint Commission on Accreditation of\nHospitals in 1951, but it was not until 1965 that accreditation had any\nofficial impact. In 1965 the federal government decided that a hospital that\nmet Joint Commission accreditation met the Medicare Conditions of\nParticipation. Recently, Section 125 of the Medicare Improvements for Patients\nand Providers Act of 2008 (MIPPA) removed The Joint Commission's statutorily-\nguaranteed accreditation authority for hospitals, effective July 15, 2010. At\nthat time, The Joint Commissionâs hospital accreditation program will be\nsubject to Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) requirements for\norganizations seeking accrediting authority. To avoid a lapse in accrediting\nauthority, The Joint Commission must submit an application for hospital\naccrediting authority consistent with these requirements and within a time\nframe that will enable CMS to review and evaluate their submission.

Its expenses during this period were $162 million. Its\ntotal return on investments in 2008 was -$27 million (a loss), and the total\nvalue of its investments was $83 million. In 2007, its collected revenue was\n$149 million. Its expenses were $148 million. Its total return on investments\nwas $5 million, and the total value of its investments was $107 million. The\nJoint Commission's primary investments in 2007 and 2008 were in stocks (about\n50% of investments) and trusts (about 40% of investments).
