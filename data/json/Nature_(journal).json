Most scientific journals\nare now highly specialized, and Nature is among the few journals (the other\nweekly journals [[Science (journal)|Science]] and [[Proceedings of the National\nAcademy of Sciences]] are also prominent examples) that still publish original\nresearch articles across a wide range of scientific fields. There are many\nfields of scientific research in which important new advances and original\nresearch are published as either articles or letters in Nature.\n\nResearch scientists are the primary audience for the journal, but summaries and\naccompanying articles are intended to make many of the most important papers\nunderstandable to scientists in other fields and the educated general public.\nTowards the front of each issue are editorials, news and feature articles on\nissues of general interest to scientists, including current affairs, science\nfunding, business, scientific ethics and research breakthroughs. There are also\nsections on books and arts. The remainder of the journal consists mostly of\nresearch articles, which are often dense and highly technical. Because of strict\nlimits on the length of articles, often the printed text is actually a summary\nof the work in question with many details relegated to accompanying\nsupplementary material on the journal's website.\n\nIn 2007 Nature (together with [[Science (journal)|Science]]) received the Prince\nof Asturias Award for Communications and Humanity. {{cite web\n | last = Ham first = Becky authorlink = coauthors = AAAS News release title =\n | Science Receives Spain's Prince of Asturias Award for Excellence in\n | Communication quote = Science [magazine] shares this year's award with the\n | journal Nature. publisher = American Association for the Advancement of\n | Science (AAAS) date = October 26, 2007 url =\n | http://www.aaas.org/news/releases/2007/1026asturias.shtml accessdate =2012-08-\n | 27}}\n{{cite web\n | title = Journals Nature and Science - Communication and Humanities 2007 quote\n | = Some of the most important and innovative work of the last 150 years has\n | appeared on the pages of Science and Nature... publisher = FundaciÃ´n Principe\n | de Asturias date = October 26, 2007 url = http://www.fpa.es/en/prince-of-asturias-awards/awards/2007-journals-nature-\n | and-science.html?texto=trayectoria accessdate =2012-08-27}}\n","linknr":646,"url":"Nature_(journal)","recorded":1362374212,"links":64,"instances":["literature","publisher","scientist"],"pdf":[],"categories":["English-language journals","Multidisciplinary scientific journals","Nature Publishing Group academic journals","Publications established in 1869","Weekly journals"],"headings":["History","Publishing in ''Nature''","Science fiction","Publication of ''Nature'' and related journals","References","Bibliography","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/62/Cover_nature.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Nature_cover%2C_November_4%2C_1869.jpg/170px-Nature_cover%2C_November_4%2C_1869.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/Nature_Materials_Nov_2008.jpg/120px-Nature_Materials_Nov_2008.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["philip_campbell","scientist"],["alexander_macmillan","publisher"],["philip_campbell","scientist"],["vignette","literature"]],"members":["vignette","alexander_macmillan","philip_campbell"],"related":["Philip_Campbell_(scientist)","Interdisciplinary","Nature_Publishing_Group","Interdisciplinary","Scientific_journal","Original_research","Scientific_research","Editorial","Prince_of_Asturias_Awards","American_Association_for_the_Advancement_of_Science","Fundaciôn_Principe_de_Asturias","Royal_Society","Isaac_Newton","Michael_Faraday","Charles_Darwin","Natural_history","Astronomy","Archaeology","Norman_Lockyer","William_Wordsworth","Alexander_Macmillan_(publisher)","X_Club","Thomas_Henry_Huxley","Joseph_Dalton_Hooker","Herbert_Spencer","John_Tyndall","Common_descent","John_Maddox","Norman_Lockyer","Imperial_College","Sir_Richard_Gregory,_1st_Baronet","L.J.F._Brimble","John_Maddox","Philip_Campbell_(scientist)","Barack_Obama","United_States_presidential_election,_2008","Positive_feedback","Impact_factor","Institute_for_Scientific_Information","Peer_review","Mission_statement","Wave_nature","Neutron","Nuclear_fission","DNA","Protein","Myoglobin","Plate_tectonics","Pulsars","Ozone_hole","Cloning","Mammal","Dolly_the_sheep","Human_genome","Jan_Hendrik_Schön","Superconductivity","James_D._Watson","Francis_Crick","John_Maddox","Enrico_Fermi","Fermi's_interaction","Beta_decay","Paul_Lauterbur","Peter_Mansfield","Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_or_Medicine","Science_fiction","Short_stories","Vignette_(literature)","European_Science_Fiction_Society","Nature_Publishing_Group","Macmillan_Publishers","Georg_von_Holtzbrinck_Publishing_Group","Boston","Munich","Basingstoke","Chris_Smith,_The_Naked_Scientist","The_Naked_Scientists"]}
