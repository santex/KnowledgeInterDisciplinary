For example, a computer may\nread information off a floppy disk and store it in random access memory to be\nplaced on the hard drive to be processed at a future date. Computers may read\ninformation from a variety of sources, such as magnetic storage, the Internet,\nor audio and video input ports.\n\nA 'read cycle' is the act of reading one unit of information (e.g. a byte). A\n'read channel' is an electrical circuit that transforms the physical magnetic\nflux changes into abstract bits. A 'read error' occurs when the physical part of\nthe process fails for some reason, such as dust or dirt entering the drive.\n\nReading can be abstracted to one of the main functions of a Turing machine.\n","linknr":173,"url":"Reading_(computer)","recorded":1362484801,"links":16,"instances":["electricity","hardware","writing_speed","circuits","computing"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Computer storage","Computer memory"],"headings":["History","Memory types","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/6c/Wiki_letter_w.svg/23px-Wiki_letter_w.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["process","computing"],["computer_port","hardware"],["node","circuits"],["ground","electricity"],["x","writing_speed"]],"members":["ground","computer_port","x","node","process"],"related":["Computers","Data","Volatile_memory","Process_(computing)","Floppy_disk","Random_access_memory","Hard_drive","Magnetic_storage","Internet","Sound","Video","Computer_port_(hardware)","Turing_machine","Non-volatile_memory","Microprocessor","Microcontroller","Static_Random_Access_Memory","Digital_logic","MOSFET","Pull-up_resistor","Electrical_network","Node_(circuits)","Voltage_source","IC_power_supply_pin","Ground_(electricity)","Conductive","Resistivity","Floating-gate_transistor","NOR_gate","MOSFET","Oxide","Electron","Binary_code","Data","Tunnel_injection","Tunnel_release","Universal_Serial_Bus","USB_flash_drive","Memory_card","Magnetization","Non-volatile_memory","Sequential_access_memory","Random_access_memory","Antikythera_mechanism","Common_Era","Hero_of_Alexandria","Common_Era","Punched_cards","Multiplexer","Non-volatile_memory","X_(writing_speed)","Computer_storage","Turing_machine","Optical_character_recognition"]}
