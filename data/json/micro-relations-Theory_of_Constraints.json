There is always at least one constraint, and TOC\nuses a focusing process to identify the constraint and restructure the rest of\nthe organization around it.\n\nTOC adopts the common idiom \"a chain is no stronger than its weakest link\".\nThis means that processes, organizations, etc., are vulnerable because the\nweakest person or part can always damage or break them or at least adversely\naffect the outcome.\n","linknr":531,"url":"Theory_of_Constraints","recorded":1362670918,"links":36,"instances":["business","mathematics","theory_of_constraints","disambiguation","business"],"pdf":["http://www.goalsys.com/books/documents/S-DBRPaper.pdf","http://www.goalsys.com/books/documents/S-DBRPaper.pdf","http://ac.aua.am/trietsch/web/MBC_to_MBC_II.pdf","http://ac.aua.am/trietsch/web/WorkingPaper281.pdf"],"categories":["Process management","Leadership","Marketing","Theory of constraints|"],"headings":["History","Applications","The TOC thinking processes","Development and practice","Criticism","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/Factory.svg/100px-Factory.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["throughput","business"],["constraint","mathematics"],["optimization","mathematics"],["thinking_processes","theory_of_constraints"],["just-in-time","business"],["constraint","disambiguation"],["throughput","business"]],"members":["optimization","thinking_processes","constraint","throughput"],"related":["Management_philosophy","Eliyahu_M._Goldratt","Goal","System","Throughput_(business)","Reductio_ad_absurdum","Inertia","Throughput_accounting","Inventory","Operating_expenses","Constraint_(mathematics)","Optimization_(mathematics)","Murphy's_Law","Kanban","Manufacturing","Project_management","Marketing","Sales","Finance","Operations_management","Throughput_accounting","Cost_accounting","Critical_Chain_Project_Management","Sales_process_engineering","Thinking_Processes_(Theory_of_Constraints)","Fundação_Getúlio_Vargas","P_=_NP_problem","System_dynamics","Jay_Forrester","Statistical_process_control","Program_Evaluation_and_Review_Technique","Critical_path_method","Just-in-time_(business)","Linear_programming","List_of_Theory_of_Constraints_topics","Systems_thinking","Critical_systems_thinking","Joint_decision_trap","Twelve_leverage_points","Donella_Meadows","Constraint_(disambiguation)","Throughput_(business)","Rate-determining_step"]}
