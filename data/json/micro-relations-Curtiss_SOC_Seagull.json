The aircraft served on battleships and cruisers in a\nseaplane configuration, being launched by catapult and recovered from a sea\nlanding. The wings folded back against the fuselage for storage aboard ship.\nWhen based ashore or on carriers the single float was replaced by fixed wheeled\nlanding gear.\n\nCurtiss delivered 258 SOC aircraft, in versions 'SOC-1' through 'SOC-4',\nbeginning in 1935. The SOC-3 design was the basis of the Naval Aircraft Factory\n'SON-1' variant, of which the NAF delivered 64 aircraft from 1940.\n","linknr":654,"url":"Curtiss_SOC_Seagull","recorded":1362664962,"links":43,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Seaplanes and flying boats","Curtiss aircraft|SO1C Seagull","United States military reconnaissance aircraft 1930â€“1939","Naval Aircraft Factory aircraft|SON","Single-engine aircraft"],"headings":["Design and development","Operational history","Variants","Operators","Specifications (SOC-1 floatplane)","Images","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/Curtiss_SOC-1.jpg/300px-Curtiss_SOC-1.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/84/SOC-3A_VGS-1_landing_ACV-1_Apr1942.jpg/220px-SOC-3A_VGS-1_landing_ACV-1_Apr1942.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Curtiss_SOC-4_Seagull_US_Coast_Guard.jpg/220px-Curtiss_SOC-4_Seagull_US_Coast_Guard.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a4/Flag_of_the_United_States.svg/22px-Flag_of_the_United_States.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b1/Curtiss_SOC_Seagull_drawings.png/300px-Curtiss_SOC_Seagull_drawings.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/RAdm_King_with_SOC_Seagull_1936.jpg/120px-RAdm_King_with_SOC_Seagull_1936.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c7/SON-1_1939_NAN9-57.jpg/120px-SON-1_1939_NAN9-57.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c6/SOC_launching_from_USS_Montpelier_%28CL-57%29.jpg/120px-SOC_launching_from_USS_Montpelier_%28CL-57%29.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/db/SOCs_from_USS_Honululu_%28CL-48%29_in_flight_c1938.jpg/120px-SOCs_from_USS_Honululu_%28CL-48%29_in_flight_c1938.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e1/SOC-3A_VS-201_ACV-1_Dec1941.jpg/120px-SOC-3A_VS-201_ACV-1_Dec1941.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/07/SOCs_on_cat_of_Brooklyn_class_cruiser_1943.jpg/120px-SOCs_on_cat_of_Brooklyn_class_cruiser_1943.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6a/USS_Tuscaloosa_hoists_a_Curtiss_SOC_scout_plane%2C_September_1941.jpg/120px-USS_Tuscaloosa_hoists_a_Curtiss_SOC_scout_plane%2C_September_1941.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/44/Curitss_SOC_taxiing_for_pickup_c1944.jpg/120px-Curitss_SOC_taxiing_for_pickup_c1944.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["uss_montpelier","cl-57"],["uss_tuscaloosa","ca-37"]],"members":["uss_montpelier","uss_tuscaloosa"],"related":["Curtiss-Wright","United_States_Navy","United_States_Coast_Guard","United_States_Marine_Corps","Naval_Aircraft_Factory","United_States","Biplane","Curtiss-Wright","United_States_Navy","Aircraft","Battleship","Cruiser","Seaplane","Aircraft_catapult","Fuselage","Conventional_landing_gear","1935_in_aviation","Naval_Aircraft_Factory","1940_in_aviation","United_States_Navy","Naval_Aircraft_Factory","Vought_OS2U_Kingfisher","SO3C_Seamew","Winch","Curtiss_SO3C_Seamew","Pratt_&_Whitney_R-1340","NACA_cowling","Naval_Aircraft_Factory","United_States_Navy","United_States_Marine_Corps","United_States_Coast_Guard","Pratt_&_Whitney_R-1340","Radial_engine","Nautical_mile","Ernest_King","USS_Montpelier_(CL-57)","Brooklyn_class_cruiser","USS_Tuscaloosa_(CA-37)","Curtiss_SO3C_Seamew","Vought_OS2U_Kingfisher","List_of_aircraft_of_World_War_II","Peter_M._Bowers","OCLC"]}
