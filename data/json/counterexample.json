For example,\nconsider the proposition \"all students are lazy\". Because this statement makes\nthe claim that a certain property (laziness) holds for all students, even a\nsingle example of a diligent student will prove it false. Thus, any hard-working\nstudent is a counterexample to \"all students are lazy\". More precisely, a\ncounterexample is a specific instance of the falsity of a universal\nquantification (a \"for all\" statement).\n\nIn mathematics, this term is (by a slight abuse) also sometimes used for\nexamples illustrating the necessity of the full hypothesis of a theorem, by\nconsidering a case where a part of the hypothesis is not verified, and where one\ncan show that the conclusion does not hold. A counterexample may be local or\nglobal in an argument.\n","title":"counterexample","headings":["In mathematics","In philosophy","Further reading","See also"]},"micro-relation":["2: Philosophy","2: Prime_number","1: Logic","1: Mathematics","1: Universal_quantification","1: Geometry","1: Shape","1: Conjecture","1: Rectangles","1: Mathematical_proof","1: Deductive_reasoning","1: Hypothesis","1: Rhombus","1: Natural_number","1: Composite_number","1: Mathematician","1: Plato","1: Callicles","1: Socrates","1: Prima_facie","1: Lynn_Arthur_Steen","1: J._Arthur_Seebach,_Jr.","1: Exception_that_proves_the_rule","1: Gainsay"]}
