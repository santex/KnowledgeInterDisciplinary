It consists of a set of\nexclusive rights granted by a sovereign state to an inventor or their assignee\nfor a limited period of time, in exchange for the public disclosure of the\ninvention. An invention is a solution to a specific technological problem, and\nmay be a product or a process. [http://www.wipo.int/export/sites/www/about-\nip/en/iprm/pdf/ch2.pdf WIPO Intellectual Property Handbook: Policy, Law and Use.\nChapter 2: Fields of Intellectual Property Protection] WIPO 2008\n\nThe procedure for granting patents, requirements placed on the patentee, and the\nextent of the exclusive rights vary widely between countries according to\nnational laws and international agreements. Typically, however, a patent\napplication must include one or more claims that define the invention. These\nclaims must meet relevant patentability requirements, such as novelty and non-\nobviousness. The exclusive right granted to a patentee in most countries is the\nright to prevent others from making, using, selling, or distributing the\npatented invention without permission.\n\nUnder the World Trade Organization's (WTO) Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of\nIntellectual Property Rights, patents should be available in WTO member states\nfor any invention, in all fields of technology, Article 27.1. of the TRIPs\nAgreement. and the term of protection available should be a minimum of\ntwenty years. Nevertheless, there are variations on what\nis patentable subject matter from country to country.\n","linknr":654,"url":"Patent","recorded":1362503505,"links":87,"instances":["law","inventor","patent","patent","patent","device","2000","patentee","ownership_right"],"pdf":["http://www.wipo.int/export/sites/www/about-ip/en/iprm/pdf/ch2.pdf","http://www.ipo.gov.uk/practice-sec-039.pdf","http://www.european-patent-office.org/epo/new/cost_analysis_2005_en.pdf","http://www.ip-institute.org.uk/pdfs/Perceptions%20of%20IP.pdf","http://www.international-ul.com/pdf/ebook/1/_Uyz13PfFMbDE.pdf","http://www.dklevine.com/papers/imbookfinalall.pdf","http://www.dklevine.com/papers/imbookfinalall.pdf"],"categories":["Intellectual
