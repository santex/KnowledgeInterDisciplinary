those facts.\n\nThis description may establish rules or laws, and may clarify the existing ones\nin relation to any objects, or phenomena examined. The components of an\nexplanation can be implicit, and be interwoven with one another.\n\nAn explanation is often underpinned by an understanding that is represented by\ndifferent media such as music, text, and graphics. Thus, an explanation is\nsubjected to interpretation, and discussion.\n\nIn scientific research, explanation is one of the purposes of research, e.g.,\nexploration and description. Explanation is a way to uncover new knowledge, and\nto report relationships among different aspects of studied phenomena.\nExplanations have varied explanatory power.\n","title":"explanation","headings":["Arguments","Justification","Types","Meta-explanation","See also","Further reading","External links"]},"micro-relation":["1: Description","1: Causality","1: Logical_consequence","1: Rule_of_inference","1: Axiom","1: Implicit","1: Understanding","1: Scientific_research","1: Exploration","1: Phenomena","1: Explanatory_power","1: Rhetoric","1: Critical_thinking","1: Proposition","1: Belief","1: Aristotle","1: Four_causes","1: Deductive-nomological_model","1: Abductive_reasoning","1: Cogency","1: Epistemology","1: Explanatory_gap","1: Explanans","1: Inductive_reasoning","1: Inquiry","1: Knowledge","1: Scientific_method","1: Unexplained","1: Theory","1: Wesley_Salmon"]}
