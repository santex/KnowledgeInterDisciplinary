It is close to the Tower of London, from which it\ntakes its name. Contrary to popular belief, the song \"London Bridge is Falling\nDown\" has nothing to do with Tower Bridge. They are completely different\nbridges. It has become an iconic symbol of London.\n\nThe bridge consists of two towers tied together at the upper level by means of\ntwo horizontal walkways, designed to withstand the horizontal forces exerted by\nthe suspended sections of the bridge on the landward sides of the towers. The\nvertical component of the forces in the suspended sections and the vertical\nreactions of the two walkways are carried by the two robust towers. The bascule\npivots and operating machinery are housed in the base of each tower. The\nbridge's present colour scheme dates from 1977, when it was painted red, white\nand blue for the Queen Elizabeth II's silver jubilee. Originally it was painted\na mid greenish-blue colour.

Docklands Light Railway station is Tower Gateway.\n","linknr":1012,"url":"Tower_Bridge","recorded":1362484577,"links":104,"instances":["united_states","uk_politician","architect","engineer","lake_havasu_city","sailing","london_underground"],"pdf":["http://www.theengineer.co.uk/journals/pdf/24222.pdf","http://www.theengineer.co.uk/journals/pdf/24222.pdf","http://www.speedcheck.co.uk/images/Tower_Bridge_Case_Study.pdf","http://www.speedcheck.co.uk/images/Tower_Bridge_Case_Study.pdf"],"categories":["Bascule
