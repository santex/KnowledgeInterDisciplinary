Being vocal groups, most boy band members do not play musical\ninstruments, either in recording sessions or on stage, making the term somewhat\nof a misnomer. However, exceptions do exist. Most boy bands dance as well as\nsing, usually giving highly choreographed performances.\n\nSome such bands form on their own. They can evolve out of church choral or\ngospel music groups, but are often created by talent managers or record\nproducers who hold auditions. Due to this and their general commercial\norientation towards a female audience of preteens, teenyboppers, or teens, the\nterm may be used with negative connotations in music journalism. Boy bands are\nsimilar in concept to girl groups.\n","linknr":618,"url":"Boy_band","recorded":1362477208,"links":44,"instances":["person","band","british_band","band","band","band","band","music_manager","band","band","band","band","boyband","english_band","group","band","band","band","band","band","japanese_band","band","musical_instrument","band","band","band","south_korean_band","taiwanese_band","band"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Boy
