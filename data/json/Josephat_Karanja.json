He resigned to avoid an\nongoing vote-of-no-confidence in the Kenyan Parliament. He was accused by the\nnow late Hon. David Mwenje Member of Parliament for Embakasi Constituency of\nwanting to overthrow President Daniel arap Moi's government by soliciting help\nfrom foreign nations. His large network of friends from the west â mainly US and\nBritain â where he had been a High Commissioner Ambassador. The speculation was\nfuelled by his wife being from a foreign country (Uganda). He was accused of\ndisplaying the stunning beauty at a time when political wives were never seen\nnor heard. Few people (mainly powerful) failed to understand his western\nideological thinking.\n\nHe was a member of parliament for Mathare Constituency (today Kasarani\nConstituency) during his VP years, but later moved to Githunguri Constituency,\nwhich he won in 1992 after two previous failed tries against Arthur Magugu.\nPreviously, between 1964 and 1970, Official Record 2nd Session, 7th\nParliament; Kenya National Assembly Hansard Vol. 3, No. 5; 12 October\n1993. he had been the youngest (at 33) to serve as High Commissioner\n(Ambassador) to Britain, which was and still is one of the most important\neconomic partners to Kenya; and had, beginning at age 40, served as the Vice-\nChancellor of the University of Nairobi. He is probably more remembered for his\ntenure there between 1970â1979, a period referred to as the hey-days of the\nuniversity whereby black student enrolment increased by large numbers for the\nfirst time in the country's history, than for any other aspects of his public\nservice career. His liberal & western ideology opened the university to many\nchanges, especially the encouragement of women to acquire higher education.\n\nHe had a reputation as a no-nonsense leader and administrator who would not\nentertain any margin for error. He managed the university with an iron fist, and\nwas politically very savvy. As a result, he was liked and loathed by many. He\nwas described in some quarters as brilliant, dedicated, but aloof and not in\ntouch in others. Many accused him and former Attorney General Charles Njonjo of\nbeing too westernised and out-of-touch with the common African population. This\nwas possibly because most foreign-educated and wealthy people had more\ninteraction with rich, white individuals who were remnants of the colonial era's\npowerful establishments. But, unlike the former Attorney General Charles Njonjo,\nDr. Karanja delegated and empowered those below him to take charge. Karanja\nfiercely guarded the independence of the University, and had the ability to get\nthings done.\n\nIn 1993 he was arrested by representatives of the government of President Moi\n(his former boss), and arraigned in court on charges that he was inciting the\npublic against the government. The charges were bogus since, at the time, he was\nin frail health and could barely attend parliamentary sessions. The government's\nheightened paranoia during this time was such that they intimidated those who\neven thought of challenging the president's government policies. Many opposition\npoliticians were detained without trial, and had their wealth and tax status\ninvestigated. Some died in mysterious 'car accidents'. The 1993 arrests of Dr.\nKaranja and others were condemned by many foreign governments including the US,\nBritain, Germany and Australia. A few weeks later, charges against the arrestees\nwere all dropped for 'lack of evidence'. Many believe President Moi to have\ncaved in to foreign pressure over the incident.\n\nKaranja died on 28 February 1994, 3 weeks and 2 days after his 63rd birthday.\n","linknr":131,"url":"Josephat_Karanja","recorded":1375074789,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Josephat_Karanja&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Josephat_Karanja&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Josephat_Karanja&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Template:Citation_needed","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/Vice-President_of_Kenya","/wiki/Daniel_arap_Moi","/wiki/Mwai_Kibaki","/wiki/George_Saitoti","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Nairobi,_Kenya","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Kenya_African_National_Union","/wiki/Doctorate","/wiki/Vice-President_of_Kenya","/wiki/Kenya","/wiki/National_Assembly_of_Kenya","/w/index.php?title=David_Mwenje&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Embakasi_Constituency","/wiki/Daniel_arap_Moi","/wiki/High_Commissioner","/wiki/Uganda","/wiki/Mathare_Constituency","/wiki/Kasarani_Constituency","/wiki/Githunguri_Constituency","/wiki/Arthur_Magugu","#cite_note-3","/wiki/University_of_Nairobi","/wiki/Attorney_General","/wiki/Charles_Njonjo","/wiki/Attorney_General","/wiki/Charles_Njonjo","/w/index.php?title=Josephat_Karanja&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","http://books.google.ca/books?id=8wPjJUPkaKgC&q=Josephat+Njuguna+Karanja+1931&dq=Josephat+Njuguna+Karanja+1931&hl=en&sa=X&ei=5L8LT6DCL4mliQLYg8ziAw&ved=0CEIQ6AEwAw","#cite_ref-2","http://books.google.ca/books?id=wNAtAQAAIAAJ&q=Josephat+Njuguna+Karanja+1994&dq=Josephat+Njuguna+Karanja+1994&hl=en&sa=X&ei=FcALT9nQFcfKiALMuIjpAw&ved=0CEcQ6AEwBQ","#cite_ref-3","/wiki/Template:KenyaVPs","/wiki/Template_talk:KenyaVPs","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:KenyaVPs&action=edit","/wiki/Vice-President_of_Kenya","/wiki/Jaramogi_Oginga_Odinga","/wiki/Joseph_Murumbi","/wiki/Daniel_arap_Moi","/wiki/Mwai_Kibaki","/wiki/George_Saitoti","/wiki/Musalia_Mudavadi","/wiki/Michael_Kijana_Wamalwa","/wiki/Moody_Awori","/wiki/Kalonzo_Musyoka","/wiki/Kenya","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Flag_of_Kenya.svg/50px-Flag_of_Kenya.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","/wiki/Nairobi,_Kenya","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Josephat_Karanja&oldid=560660217","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Vice-Presidents_of_Kenya","/wiki/Category:Kenya_African_National_Union_politicians","/wiki/Category:Members_of_the_National_Assembly_of_Kenya","/wiki/Category:1994_deaths","/wiki/Category:1931_births","/wiki/Category:Use_British_English_from_May_2013","/wiki/Category:Use_dmy_dates_from_May_2013","/wiki/Category:Articles_needing_additional_references_from_December_2009","/wiki/Category:All_articles_needing_additional_references","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Josephat+Karanja&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Josephat+Karanja","/wiki/Josephat_Karanja","/wiki/Talk:Josephat_Karanja","#","/wiki/Josephat_Karanja","/w/index.php?title=Josephat_Karanja&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Josephat_Karanja&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Josephat_Karanja","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Josephat_Karanja","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Josephat_Karanja&oldid=560660217","/w/index.php?title=Josephat_Karanja&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6288275","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Josephat_Karanja&id=560660217","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Josephat+Karanja","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Josephat+Karan
