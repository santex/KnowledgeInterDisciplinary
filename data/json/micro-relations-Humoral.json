The immune system is divided into a more primitive innate immune\nsystem, and acquired or adaptive immune system of vertebrates, each of which\ncontains 'humoral' and cellular components.\n\nHumoral immunity refers to antibody production and the accessory processes that\naccompany it, including: Th2 activation and cytokine production, germinal center\nformation and isotype switching, affinity maturation and memory cell generation.\nIt also refers to the effector functions of antibody, which include pathogen and\ntoxin neutralization, classical complement activation, and opsonin promotion of\nphagocytosis and pathogen elimination.\n","linknr":311,"url":"Humoral","recorded":1362674940,"links":24,"instances":["biologist","biology","immunology","medical","microbiology","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Immune system"],"headings":["History","Complement system","Antibodies","B cells","See also","References","Further reading"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["isotype","immunology"],["effector","biology"],["hans_buchner","biologist"],["immunity","medical"],["hemolysis","microbiology"],["agglutination","biology"],["immunity","medical"]],"members":["hans_buchner","effector","isotype","immunity","hemolysis","agglutination"],"related":["Cell-mediated__immunity","Humorism","Immune_system","Immunology","Innate_immune_system","Adaptive_immune_system","Cellular_immunity","Th2","Cytokine","Germinal_center","Isotype_(immunology)","Affinity_maturation","Memory_cell","Effector_(biology)","Complement_system","Opsonin","Phagocytosis","Antibacterial","Hans_Buchner_(biologist)","Elie_Metchnikoff","Paul_Ehrlich","Soluble","Diphtheria","Tetanus","Emil_von_Behring","Kitasato_Shibasabur≈ç","Diphtheria_toxin","Vaccination","Antitoxin","Ricin","Abrin","Immunotherapy","Immunity_(medical)","Complement_system","Antitoxins","Passive_immunization","Bacteriolysin","Richard_Friedrich_Johannes_Pfeiffer","Agglutinin","Precipitin","Max_von_Gruber","Hemolysis_(microbiology)","Jules_Bordet","Opsonin","Antibody","Proteins","Plasma_membrane","Cytolysis","Chemotaxis","Opsonization","Inflammation","Phagocytosis","Blood_serum","Globulin","Zymogen","Proteolytic_cleavage","Classical_complement_pathway","Alternate_complement_pathway","Mannose-binding_lectin_pathway","Agglutination_(biology)","Virus","Blood_transfusion","Transfusion_reaction","Hemolysis","Red_blood_cell","Urine","Hemoglobinuria","Hemoglobin","Acute_renal_failure","Cell_growth","Cellular_differentiation","Plasma_cell","Polyclonal_response","T_cell","Antigen_presenting_cell","Cytokine","Immune_system","Immunity_(medical)","Polyclonal_response"]}
