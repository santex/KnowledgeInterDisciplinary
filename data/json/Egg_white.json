In chickens it is formed from\nthe layers of secretions of the anterior section of the hen's oviduct during the\npassage of the egg. Ornithology, Volume 1994 By Frank B. Gill p. 361\nIt forms around either fertilized or unfertilized egg yolks. The primary natural\npurpose of egg white is to protect the yolk and provide additional nutrition for\nthe growth of the embryo (when fertilized). Egg white consists primarily of\nabout 90% water into which is dissolved 10% proteins (including albumins,\nmucoproteins, and globulins). Unlike the yolk, which is high in lipids (fats),\negg white contains almost no fat, and carbohydrate content is less than 1%. Egg\nwhites contain just over 50% of the protein in the egg. Egg white has many uses\nin food (e.g. mousse) and also many other uses (e.g. in the preparation of\nvaccines such as those for influenza).\n","linknr":297,"url":"Egg_white","recorded":1362503030,"links":40,"instances":["biochemistry","food"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Eggs|White","Biological matter"],"headings":["Composition","Egg white foam","Health issues","Uses","See also","References","Works cited","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/44/Chicken_egg01_monovular.jpg/220px-Chicken_egg01_monovular.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f1/Blancs_d%27oeufs_battus.jpg/220px-Blancs_d%27oeufs_battus.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Wikibooks-logo-en-noslogan.svg/40px-Wikibooks-logo-en-noslogan.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/15px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/15px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["egg","biology"],["egg","food"],["denaturation","biochemistry"]],"members":["denaturation","egg"],"related":["Egg_(biology)","Chicken","Oviduct","Egg_yolk","Embryo","Protein","Albumin","Mucoprotein","Globulin","Lipid","Carbohydrate","Egg_(food)","Mousse","Vaccine","Influenza_vaccine","Protein","Mineral","Vitamin","Glucose","Carbohydrate","Sodium","Calorie","Cholesterol","Ovalbumin","Ovotransferrin","Ovomucoid","Ovoglobulin_G2","Ovoglobulin_G3","Ovomucin","Lysozyme","Ovoinhibitor","Ovoglycoprotein","Flavoprotein","Ovomacroglobulin","Avidin","Cystatin","Denaturation_(biochemistry)","Flocculation","Fat","Cooking_oil","Egg_yolk","Copper","France","Sulfur","Egg_allergy","Food_allergy","Egg_white_intolerance","Finings","Clarification_and_stabilization_of_wine","Albumen_print","Haugh_unit","Elmhurst_College","Exploratorium"]}
