It\nis anything of value promised to another when making a contract. It can take the\nform of money, physical objects, services, promised actions, abstinence from a\nfuture action, and much more. Consideration to create a legally enforceable\ncontract entails a detriment to the promisee OR a benefit to the promisor. Under\nthe notion of \"pre-existing duties\", if either the promisor or the promisee\nalready had a legal obligation to render such payment, it cannot be seen as\nconsideration in the legal sense.\n\nIn common law it is a prerequisite that both parties offer consideration before\na contract can be thought of as binding. The doctrine of consideration is\nirrelevant in many jurisdictions, although contemporary commercial litigant\nrelations have held the relationship between a promise and a deed is a\nreflection of the nature of contractual considerations. If there is no element\nof consideration found, there is thus no contract formed.\n\nHowever, even if a court decides there is no contract, there might be a possible\nrecovery under [[quantum meruit]] (sometimes referred to as a quasi-contract) or\npromissory estoppel.\n\nIf A signs a contract to buy a car from B for $5,000, A's consideration is the\n$5,000, and B's consideration is the car.\n\nAdditionally, if A signs a contract with B such that A will paint B's house for\n$500, A's consideration is the service of painting B's house, and B's\nconsideration is $500 paid to A.\n\nFurther, if A signs a contract with B such that A will not repaint his own\nhouse in any other color than white, and B will pay A $500 per year to keep\nthis deal up, there is also consideration. Although A did not promise to\naffirmatively do anything, A did promise not to do something that he was\nallowed to do, and so A did pass consideration. A's consideration to B is the\nforbearance in painting his own house in a color other than white, and B's\nconsideration to A is $500 per year.\n\nConversely, if A signs a contract to buy a car from B for $0, B's\nconsideration is still the car, but A is giving no consideration, and so there\nis no valid contract. However, if B still gives the title to the car to A,\nthen B cannot take the car back, since, while it may not be a valid contract,\nit is a valid gift.\n\nThere are a number of common issues as to whether consideration exists in\na contract.\n","title":"consideration","headings":["History and comparative law","Monetary value of consideration","Pre-existing legal duties","Bundled terms","Past consideration","Option contracts and conditional consideration","In settlements","Treatments by different legal systems","References"]},"micro-relation":["2: At-will_employment","1: Contract","1: Common_law","1: Quasi-contract","1: Estoppel#Promissory_estoppel","1: Legislation","1: Lord_Denning","1: Central_London_Property_Trust_Ltd._v._High_Trees_House_Ltd.","1: Assumpsit","1: John_Stuart_Mill","1: A._W._B._Simpson","1: Oxford_University_Press","1: Common_law_system","1: Estoppel","1: Pre-contractual_negotiations","1: Accord_and_satisfaction","1: Tort","1: Compensatory_damages","1: Punitive_damages","1: Consideration_under_English_law","1: Consideration_under_American_law","1: Scots_contract_law"]}
