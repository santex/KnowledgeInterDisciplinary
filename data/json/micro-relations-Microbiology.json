{"cursor":"25519","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" streaked with microorganisms]]\n\n'Microbiology' (from Greek , mÄ«kros, \"small\"; , bios, \"life\"; and , [[-logy|-\nlogia]]) is the study of microscopic organisms, either unicellular (single\ncell), multicellular (cell colony), or acellular (lacking cells). Microbiology includes the disciplines virology, mycology,\nparasitology, bacteriology, and so on.\n\nEukaryotic microorganisms exhibit cell organelles and include fungi and\nprotists, whereas prokaryotic organismsâwhich all are microorganismsâare\nconventionally classified as lacking organelles and include eubacteria and\narchaebacteria. Microbiologists traditionally relied on culture, staining, and\nmicroscopy. Apparently, however, only some 1% of the microorganisms present in\nsome environments are culturable. Microbiologists\noften rely on extraction or detection of nucleic acid, either DNA or RNA\nsequences.\n\nViruses are not always classified as organisms, as they have been\nidentified either as very simple microorganisms or very complex molecules.\nPrions, never considered microorganisms, have been investigated by virologists,\nhowever, as the clinical effects traced to them were originally presumed due to\nchronic viral infections, and virologists took searchâdiscovering \"infectious\nproteins\".\n\nAs an application of microbiology, medical microbiology is often introduced with\nmedical principles of immunology as microbiology and immunology. Otherwise,\nmicrobiology, virology, and immunology as basic sciences have greatly exceeded\nthe medical variants, applied sciences.
