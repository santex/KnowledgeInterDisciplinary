{"cursor":"12973","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n]]\n\nA 'timing belt', or 'cam belt' (informal usage), is a part of an internal\ncombustion engine that controls the timing of the engine's valves. Some engines,\nsuch as the flat-4 Volkswagen air-cooled engine, and the straight-6 Toyota F\nengine use timing gears. First seen in the 1954 Devin, which won the SCCA\nNational Championship in 1956 (see May 1957 Sports Cars Illustrated article by O\nC Rich), timing belts replaced the older style timing chains that were common\nuntil the 1970s and 1980s (although in the last decade there has been\nreemergence of chain use for many carmakers). Some manufacturers, such as BMW [http://www.usautoparts.net/bmw/parts/bmw-timing-chain-\nworld.htm BMW Timing Chain - BMW World] and Mercedes-\nBenz, [http://www.partsgeek.com/mparts/timing_chain/mercedes.html Mercedes\nTiming Chain - Timing Chains] are known for using timing chains because of\ntheir durability. The term \"timing belt\" is sometimes used for the more general\ncase of any flat belt with integral teeth, although such usage is a misnomer\nsince there is no timing or synchronization involved.\n","linknr":219,"url":"Timing_chain","recorded":1362476870,"links":31,"instances":["internal_combustion_engine","automotive","mechanics","mechanism","mechanism","mechanical"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Belt drives","Engine components","Automobile maintenance","Mechanical power transmission"],"headings":["Engine applications","Timing","Failure","Construction and design","Usage history","Bicycle usage","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/Timing_belt.jpg/170px-Timing_belt.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e1/Timing_belt_RB30E.jpg/170px-Timing_belt_RB30E.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/Bent_Valves.jpg/220px-Bent_Valves.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["belt","mechanical"],["oil_pump","internal_combustion_engine"],["belt","mechanical"],["tension","mechanics"],["aftermarket","automotive"],["crank","mechanism"],["eccentric","mechanism"]],"members":["oil_pump","aftermarket","tension","crank","eccentric","belt"],"related":["Internal_combustion_engine","Poppet_valve","Flat-4","Volkswagen_air-cooled_engine","Straight-six_engine","Toyota_F_engine","Gear","BMW","Mercedes-Benz","Belt_(mechanical)","Crankshaft","Camshaft","Four-stroke_cycle","Oil_pump_(internal_combustion_engine)","Gear","Roller_chain","Crankshaft","Camshaft","Roller_chain","Composite_material","Belt_(mechanical)","Interference_engine","Interference_engine","Belt_tension","Tension_(mechanics)","Fiberglass","Twaron","Kevlar","Tension_members","Motor_oil","Nitrile","Trapezoid","Aftermarket_(automotive)","Engine_tuning","Hans_Glas","Slant_Four","Overhead_cam","Tandem_bicycles","Crank_(mechanism)","Bicycle_drivetrain_systems","Eccentric_(mechanism)","Bottom_bracket","Gilmer_belt","Interference_engine"]}
