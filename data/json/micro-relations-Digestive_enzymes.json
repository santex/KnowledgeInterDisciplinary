{"cursor":"17502","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Digestive enzymes' are enzymes that break down polymeric macromolecules into\ntheir smaller building blocks, in order to facilitate their absorption by the\nbody. Digestive enzymes are found in the digestive tracts of animals (including\nhumans) and in the traps of carnivorous plants, where they aid in the digestion\nof food, as well as inside cells, especially in their lysosomes, where they\nfunction to maintain cellular survival. Digestive enzymes are diverse and are\nfound in the saliva secreted by the salivary glands, in the stomach secreted by\ncells lining the stomach, in the pancreatic juice secreted by pancreatic\nexocrine cells, and in the intestinal (small and large) secretions, or as part\nof the lining of the gastrointestinal tract.\n\nDigestive enzymes are classified based on their target substrates: *proteases\nand peptidases split proteins into small peptides and amino acids. *lipases\nsplit fat into three fatty acids and a glycerol molecule. *carbohydrases split\ncarbohydrates such as starch and sugars into simple sugars such as glucose.\n*nucleases split nucleic acids into nucleotides.\n\nIn the human digestive system, the main sites of digestion are the oral\ncavity, the stomach, and the small intestine. Digestive enzymes are\nsecreted by different exocrine glands including: *Salivary glands\n*Secretory cells in the stomach *Secretory cells in the pancreas *Secretory\nglands in the small intestine\n","linknr":402,"url":"Digestive_enzymes","recorded":1362484399,"links":25,"instances":["biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Enzymes"],"headings":["Oral cavity","Stomach","Pancreas","Small intestine","Large intestine (colon)","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cell","biology"]],"members":["cell"],"related":["Enzymes","Polymer","Macromolecule","Digestive_tract","Carnivorous_plant","Digestion","Food","Cell_(biology)","Lysosome","Saliva","Salivary_glands","Pancreatic_juice","Enzyme_substrate","Protease","Peptidase","Protein","Amino_acid","Lipase","Fat","Fatty_acid","Glycerol","Carbohydrase","Carbohydrate","Starch","Sugar","Nuclease","Nucleic_acid","Nucleotides","Oral_cavity","Stomach","Small_intestine","Salivary_gland","Pancreas","Lingual_lipase","Lipid","Alpha-amylase","Ptyalin","Mucin","Lysozyme","IgA","Haptocorrin","Vitamin_B12","Intrinsic_factor","Parietal_cells","Cubam","Serous_gland","Parotid","Philippe-Frédéric_Blandin","Serous_cell","Mucous_cell","Viscosity","Electrolytes","Sodium","Potassium","Stomach","Pepsinogen","Peptide","Amino_acids","Hydrochloric_acid","Hydrogen_atoms","Parietal_cells","Intrinsic_factor","Ileum","Haptocorrin","Intrinsic_factor","Ileum","Mucin","Gastrin","G_cells","Endocrine","Parietal_cell","Parietal_cell","Chief_cell","Body_of_stomach","Chyme","G_cell","Antrum","Endocrine","Exocrine","Insulin","Glucagon","Ductal_cells","Bicarbonate","Secretin","Gastrin","Acinar_cells","Zymogens","Cholecystokinin","Pancreatic_juice","Trypsinogen","Enterokinase","Chymotrypsinogen","Carboxypeptidase","Elastase","Elastin","Pancreatic_lipase","Sterol_esterase","Phospholipase","Nuclease","DNAase","RNAase","Pancreatic_amylase","Glycogen","Cellulose","Secretin","Cholecystokinin","Bile","Cystic_duct","Common_bile_duct","Gastric_inhibitory_peptide","Fatty_acids","Somatostatin","Pyloric_sphincter","Duodenum","Retroperitoneal","Jejunum","Ligament_of_Treitz","Ileum","Secretin","S_cell","Cholecystokinin","Ampulla_of_Vater","Sphincter_of_Oddi","Gastric_inhibitory_peptide","Motilin","Somatostatin","Delta_cells","Sucrase","Lactase","Lactose_intolerance","Osmotic_diarrhea","Maltase","Metabolic_acidosis","Hypokalemia"]}
