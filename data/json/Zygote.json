In multicellular organisms, it\nis the earliest developmental stage of the embryo. In single-celled organisms,\nthe zygote divides to produce offspring, usually through meiosis.\n\nA zygote is always synthesized from the union of two gametes, and constitutes\nthe first stage in a unique organism's development. Zygotes are usually produced\nby a fertilization event between two haploid cellsâan ovum (female gamete) and a\nsperm cell (male gamete)âwhich combine to form the single diploid cell. Such\nzygotes contain DNA derived from both parents, and this provides all the genetic\ninformation necessary to form a new individual.\n","linknr":251,"url":"Zygote","recorded":1362373528,"links":61,"instances":["biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Developmental biology","Reproductive system"],"headings":["Plants","Animals","In other species","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/Gray3.png/220px-Gray3.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cell","biology"]],"members":["cell"],"related":["Greek_language","Cell_(biology)","Gamete","Sexual_reproduction","Embryo","Meiosis","Developmental_biology","Fertilization","Ploidy","Ovum","Female","Sperm","Male","Ploidy","DNA","Embryophyte","Archegonium","A_mass_of_cells","Morula","Mammalian_reproduction","Fallopian_tube","Cell_division","Mitosis","Lippincott_Williams_&_Wilkins","Blastocyst","Fetus","Blastocyst","Chlamydomonas","Algae","Chloroplast","CpDNA","Proembryo","Zygote_intrafallopian_transfer"]}
