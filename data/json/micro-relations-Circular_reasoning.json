{"cursor":"4678","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Circular reasoning' (also known as 'paradoxical thinking' or 'circular logic'),\nis a logical fallacy in which \"the reasoner begins with what he or she is trying\nto end up with\". The individual components of a circular argument\nwill sometimes be logically valid because if the premises are true, the\nconclusion must be true, and will not lack relevance. Circular logic cannot\nprove a conclusion because, if the conclusion is doubted, the premise which\nleads to it will also be doubted. Begging the question is a form of\ncircular reasoning.\n\nCircular reasoning is often of the form: \"a is true because b is true; b is true\nbecause a is true.\" Circularity can be difficult to detect if it involves a\nlonger chain of propositions. Academic Douglas Walton used the following example\nof a fallacious circular argument: :Wellington is in New Zealand. :Therefore,\nWellington is in New Zealand.\n\nHe notes that, although the argument is deductively valid, it cannot prove that\nWellington is in New Zealand because it contains no evidence that is distinct\nfrom the conclusion. The context â that of an argument â means that\nthe proposition does not meet the requirement of proving the statement, thus it\nis a fallacy. He proposes that the context of a dialogue determines whether a\ncircular argument is fallacious: if it forms part of an argument, then it\nis. Citing Cederblom and Paulsen 1986:109) Hugh G. Gauch\nobserves that non-logical facts can be difficult to capture formally:\n\"Whatever is less dense than water will float, because whatever is\nless dense than water will float\" sounds stupid, but \"Whatever is less dense\nthan water will float, because such objects won't sink in water\" might pass. \n","linknr":172,"url":"Circular_reasoning","recorded":1362553610,"links":20,"instances":["rhetoric"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Philosophical logic","Formal fallacies"],"headings":["Circular reasoning and the problem of induction","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/Greek_letter_uppercase_Phi.svg/30px-Greek_letter_uppercase_Phi.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["tautology","rhetoric"]],"members":["tautology"],"related":["Fallacy","Validity","Begging_the_question","Douglas_Walton","Wellington","New_Zealand","Joel_Feinberg","Russ_Shafer-Landau","David_Hume","Problem_of_induction","Inductive_proof","Empirical_evidence","Natural_deduction","Bertrand_Russell","Argument_from_authority","Coherentism","I'm_entitled_to_my_opinion","Polysyllogism","Self-reference","Tautology_(rhetoric)","Woozle_effect"]}
