{"cursor":"25325","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nThe 'gene-centered view of evolution', 'gene selection theory', or 'selfish gene\ntheory' holds that adaptive evolution occurs through the differential survival\nof competing genes, increasing the frequency of those alleles whose phenotypic\neffects successfully promote their own propagation, with gene defined as \"not\njust one single physical bit of DNA [but] all replicas of a particular bit of\nDNA distributed throughout the world\". The proponents of this\nviewpoint argue that, since heritable information is passed from generation to\ngeneration almost exclusively by genetic material, natural selection and\nevolution are best considered from the perspective of genes.\n\nThis is in contrast to the organism-centered viewpoint adopted historically by\nbiologists. Proponents of the gene-centered viewpoint argue that it permits\nunderstanding of diverse phenomena such as altruism and intragenomic conflict\nthat are otherwise difficult to explain from an organism-focused perspective.\n\nThe gene-centered view of evolution is a synthesis of the theory of evolution by\nnatural selection, the particulate inheritance theory, and the non-transmission\nof acquired characters. It states that those genes whose phenotypic effects\nsuccessfully promote their own propagation will be favorably selected in\ndetriment to their competitors. This process produces adaptations for the\nbenefit of genes that promote the reproductive success of the organism, or of\nother organisms containing the same gene (kin altruism and green-beard effects),\nor even only its own propagation in detriment to the other genes of the genome\n(intragenomic conflict).\n","linknr":519,"url":"Gene-centered_view_of_evolution","recorded":1362374193,"links":34,"instances":["biologist"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Evolutionary biology","Selection"],"headings":["Overview","Selfish-gene theory","Intragenomic conflict","Price equation","Main figures in selection debate","Criticisms","See also","Notes","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/Crystal_Clear_app_kedit.svg/40px-Crystal_Clear_app_kedit.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/CollapsedtreeLabels-simplified.svg/200px-CollapsedtreeLabels-simplified.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/Tree_of_life.svg/16px-Tree_of_life.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/Office-book.svg/16px-Office-book.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/Tree_of_life.svg/32px-Tree_of_life.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/Office-book.svg/30px-Office-book.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["david_haig","biologist"]],"members":["david_haig"],"related":["Evolution","Gene","Allele","Phenotype","DNA","Natural_selection","Altruism_in_animals","Intragenomic_conflict","Evolution","Natural_selection","Particulate_inheritance_theory","Non-transmission_of_acquired_characters","Genes","Organism","Evolution","Central_dogma_of_molecular_biology","Evolutionary_factor","Maynard_Smith","Ronald_Fisher","J._B._S._Haldane","Sewall_Wright","Epigenetics","Unit_of_selection","W._D._Hamilton","Colin_Pittendrigh","George_C._Williams","Richard_Dawkins","Phenotype","DNA","DNA_replication","Genome","Meiosis","Genetic_recombination","Meaning_of_life","Economists","Utility_function","Reverse_engineering","Ecosystem","Species","Adaptation","Somatic","Zygote","Kin_selection","Coefficient_of_relationship","J.B.S._Haldane","Green-beard_effect","Green-beard_effect","Richard_Dawkins","Meme","Symbiotic","Intragenomic_conflict","Meiosis","Gametogenesis","Gamete","Fertility","Covariance","Evolution","Natural_selection","George R._Price","London","W. D. Hamilton","Kin_selection","Richard_Dawkins","George C._Williams","Biologist","Philosopher","John_Maynard_Smith","George R._Price","Robert_Trivers","David_Haig_(biologist)","Helena_Cronin","David_Hull","Philip_Kitcher","Daniel C._Dennett","Ernst_Mayr","Stephen_Jay_Gould","David_Sloan_Wilson","Elliott_Sober","Multilevel_selection","E. O. Wilson","David_Sloan_Wilson","Elliott_Sober","Richard E._Michod","Samir_Okasha","Ernst_Mayr","Paleontologist","Stephen_Jay_Gould","David_Sloan_Wilson","Philosopher","Elliott_Sober","Causality","Adaptationism","Fundamentalism","Reductionist","Teleology","Kim_Sterelny","Niles_Eldredge","Evolutionary_biology","Francis_Crick","Charles_Darwin","Alfred_Russel_Wallace","Richard_Dawkins","Richard_Dawkins","Richard_Dawkins","Ernst_Mayr"]}
