They are\npolysporangiophytes, since their sporophytes consisted of branched stems bearing\nsporangia (spore-forming organs). They lacked leaves or true roots but did have\nsimple vascular tissue. The group was first placed in a subdivision of the\ndivision Tracheophyta under the name 'Rhyniophytina' (see for\nalternative names). Informally, they are often called 'rhyniophytes'. More\nrecently the name 'paratracheophytes' has been suggested, to distinguish such\nplants from 'true' tracheophytes or eutracheophytes.\n\nAs originally defined, the group was found not to be monophyletic since some of\nits members are now known to lack vascular tissue; these have been moved to the\nclass Horneophytopsida, which is defined as lacking true vascular tissue.\nCurrently, Rhyniopsida includes the genera [[Huvenia]], [[Rhynia]], and\n[[Stockmansella]], all from the Devonian.\n\nOne of the most important radiations for land plants occurred in the early\nDevonian (Pragian), when the first certain rhyniophytes appear in the fossil\nrecord, making this rich fossil discovery of\nmajor importance to paleobotany. It has been suggested that the poorly preserved\n[[Eohostimella]], found in deposits of Early Silurian age (Llandovery, around ),\nmay be a rhyniophyte.\n","linknr":211,"url":"Rhyniophyta","recorded":1362477093,"links":27,"instances":["biology","biology","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Prehistoric plants","Devonian life"],"headings":["Phylogeny","Rhynie flora","References","See also","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/97/Rhynia_reconstruction.jpg/220px-Rhynia_reconstruction.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Rhynie_chert_with_Rhynia_1.png/220px-Rhynie_chert_with_Rhynia_1.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["class","biology"],["family","biology"],["division","biology"]],"members":["division","class","family"],"related":["Class_(biology)","Vascular_plant","Family_(biology)","Early_Devonian","Polysporangiophyte","Sporophyte","Sporangium","Vascular_tissue","Division_(biology)","Tracheophyta","Monophyly","Horneophytopsida","Genus","Devonian","Devonian","Paleobotany","Early_Silurian","Cladogram","Tracheid","Polysporangiophyte","Plant","Rhynie_chert","Lagerst√§tte","Aberdeenshire","Scotland","Coeval","Floristic","Taxon","Anatomy","Vascular_plant","Sporangia","Gametangia","Ecosystem","Polysporangiophytes"]}
