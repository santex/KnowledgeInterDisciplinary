Neoplasia is the abnormal growth or division of cells. Prior to\nneoplasia, cells often undergo an abnormal pattern of growth, such as\nmetaplasia or dysplasia. However, metaplasia or\ndysplasia do not always progress to neoplasia. The growth of neoplastic cells\nexceeds, and is not coordinated with, that of the normal tissues around it. The\ngrowth persists in the same excessive manner even after cessation of the\nstimuli. It usually causes a lump or tumor. Neoplasms may be benign, pre-\nmalignant (carcinoma in situ) or malignant (cancer).\n\nIn modern medicine, the term tumor means a neoplasm that has formed a lump.\nIn the past, the term tumor was used differently. Some neoplasms do not\ncause a lump.\n","linknr":348,"url":"Neoplasm","recorded":1362685583,"links":31,"instances":["medical","cell_biology","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Anatomical pathology","Medical signs","Oncology"],"headings":["Types","Difficulty of definition","Neoplasia vs. tumor","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cc/Colon_cancer_2.jpg/200px-Colon_cancer_2.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/85/Fibroids.jpg/200px-Fibroids.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cell","biology"],["clone","cell_biology"],["swelling","medical"]],"members":["swelling","clone","cell"],"related":["Colorectal_carcinoma","Uterus","Ancient_Greek","Cell_(biology)","Metaplasia","Dysplasia","Tumor","Benign_tumor","Carcinoma_in_situ","Cancer","Cancer","Benign_tumor","Uterine_fibroids","Melanocytic_nevus","Carcinoma_in_situ","Metastasis","Chemotherapy","Radiotherapy","Oncology","Clone_(cell_biology)","Mutation","Epigenetics","Lymphoma","Leukemia","Immunoglobulin","B_cell","T-cell_receptor","T_cell","Tumor","Swelling_(medical)","Leukemia","Carcinoma_in_situ","Antineoplaston"]}
