The role of letters in\n communication has changed significantly since the nineteenth century.\n Historically, letters (in paper form) were the only reliable means of\n communication between two people in different locations.\n\nAs communication technology has diversified, posted letters have become less\nimportant as a routine form of communication; they however still remain but in a\nmodified form. For example, the development of the telegraph shortened the time\ntaken to send a letter by transferring the letter as an electrical signal (for\nexample in Morse code) between distant points. At the telegraph office closest\nto the destination of the letter, the signal was transferred back into a\nhardcopy format and sent as a normal mail to the person's home. This allowed the\nnormal speed of communication to be drastically shortened for larger and larger\ndistances. This required specialised technicians to encode and decode the\nletter. The facsimile (fax) machine took this one step further: an entire letter\ncould be completely transferred electrically from the sender's house to the\nreceiver's house by means of the telephone network as an image.\n\nToday, the Internet is becoming (or has become) the predominant medium for\nsending letters. The term e-mail, meaning electronic mail, has entered into\neveryday speech. By analogy, the term letter is sometimes used for e-mail\nmessages with a formal letter-like format. (And regular letters, since they take\nlonger, are often called \"snail-mail.\")\n\nHistorically, letters exist from the time of ancient India, ancient Egypt and\nSumer, through Rome, Greece and China, up to the present day. Letters make up\nseveral of the books of the Bible. Archives of correspondence, whether for\npersonal, diplomatic, or business reasons, serve as primary sources for\nhistorians.\n","linknr":301,"url":"Letter_(message)","recorded":1362569948,"links":76,"instances":["greeting","disambiguation","geography"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Letters (message)|","Paper products","Postal system"],"headings":["The study of letter writing","Advantages","The letter-delivering process","Letter layout","Letter of thanks","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/Einstein_Szilard_p1.jpg/250px-Einstein_Szilard_p1.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/44/Kate_Hepburn_Letter.jpg/250px-Kate_Hepburn_Letter.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/25/Letter_balance.jpg/250px-Letter_balance.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/Tuskegee-syphilis-experiment_thank-you-letter.gif/200px-Tuskegee-syphilis-experiment_thank-you-letter.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/15/The_Letter_Writer.jpg/170px-The_Letter_Writer.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/38px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["address","geography"],["postmaster_general","disambiguation"],["salutation","greeting"]],"members":["salutation","postmaster_general","address"],"related":["Edward_Teller","Leó_Szilárd","Franklin_Roosevelt","Atomic_bomb","Written","Message","Communication","Communication_technology","Morse_code","E-mail","History_of_India","Ancient_Egypt","Sumer","Ancient_Rome","Ancient_Greece","Ancient_China","Bible","Archives","Primary_source","Historian","Manuals","Ars_dictaminis","Rhetoric","Grammar","Alan_Light","Cary_Grant","Computer","Telephone","Envelope","Postage_stamp","Envelope","Royal_Mail","United_Kingdom","US_Postal_Service","United_States","Australia_Post","Australia","Canada_Post","Canada","Post_office","Trains","Fixed-wing_aircraft","Postscript","Tuskegee_Syphilis_Study","Business_letter","Personal_letter","Address_(geography)","Carbon_copy","Compliments_slip","Envelope","Historical_documents","Letter_box","Mail","Manuscript","Pen_pal","Pony_Express","Post_office","Kolkata","India","Postage_stamp","Postmaster","Postmaster_General_(disambiguation)","Private_Express_Statutes","Salutation_(greeting)","Secrecy_of_letters","Snail_mail","Stationery","Typography","Universal_Postal_Union","Valediction","Application_letter","Audio_letter","Begging_letter","Business_letter","Cease_and_desist","Chain_letter","Cover_letter","Dear_John_letter","E-mail_letter","Epistle","Hate_mail","Introduction_letter","Letter_of_credence","Letter_of_credit","Letter_of_inquiry","Letter_of_intent","Letter_of_marque","Letter_of_resignation","Letters_patent","Love_letter","National_Letter_of_Intent","Open_letter","Poison_pen_letter","Query_letter","Recommendation_letter","Reference_letter","Sales_letter"]}
