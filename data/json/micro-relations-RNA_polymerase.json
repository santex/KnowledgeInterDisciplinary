In cells, RNAP is necessary for\nconstructing RNA chains using DNA genes as templates, a process called\ntranscription. RNA polymerase enzymes are essential to life and are found in all\norganisms and many viruses. In chemical terms, RNAP is a nucleotidyl transferase\nthat polymerizes ribonucleotides at the 3' end of an RNA transcript.\n","linknr":536,"url":"RNA_polymerase","recorded":1362374299,"links":46,"instances":["molecular_biology","genetics","biology","biology","genetics","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Gene expression","RNA","Enzymes","EC 2.7.7"],"headings":["History","Control of transcription","RNA polymerase action","RNA polymerase in bacteria","RNA polymerase in eukaryotes","RNA polymerase in archaea","RNA polymerase in viruses","RNA polymerase purification","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/43/Transcription_label_en.jpg/220px-Transcription_label_en.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/RNAP_TEC_small.jpg/220px-RNAP_TEC_small.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/Alpha-Amanitin%E2%80%93RNA_polymerase_II_complex_1K83.png/220px-Alpha-Amanitin%E2%80%93RNA_polymerase_II_complex_1K83.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/01/RNA_pol.jpg/220px-RNA_pol.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cell","biology"],["transcription","genetics"],["transcription","genetics"],["cell","biology"],["transcription","genetics"],["promoter","biology"],["complementarity","molecular_biology"],["terminator","genetics"],["translation","biology"],["translation","genetics"],["translation","biology"],["transcription","genetics"]],"members":["complementarity","terminator","promoter","translation","transcription","cell"],"related":["Enzyme","RNA","Cell_(biology)","Gene","Transcription_(genetics)","Virus","Nucleotidyl_transferase","Polymerization","Ribonucleotide","3'","Jerard_Hurwitz","Nobel_Prize","Severo_Ochoa","Polynucleotide_phosphorylase","Roger_D._Kornberg","DNA","RNA","3'_end","5'_end","Gene","Transcription_(genetics)","Gene_expression","Cell_(biology)","Escherichia_coli","Transcription_(genetics)","Promoter_(biology)","Complementarity_(molecular_biology)","Nucleotide","Nucleotides","Dystrophin","Terminator_(genetics)","Messenger_RNA","Translation_(biology)","Ribosome","Non-coding_RNA","Transfer_RNA","Ribosomal_RNA","Translation_(genetics)","Transfer_RNA","Amino_acid","Polypeptide","Translation_(biology)","Ribosomal_RNA","Micro_RNA","Ribozyme","Enzyme","De_novo_synthesis","DNA_polymerase","Helicase","Sigma_factor","Supercoiling","Aspartic_acid","Rho-independent_transcription_termination","Rho_factor","Bacteria","MRNA","NcRNA","Atomic_mass_unit","RpoB","Sigma_factor","Eukaryote","RNA_polymerase_I","RRNA","Ribosome","RNA_polymerase_II","MRNA","SnRNA","MicroRNA","Transcription_factor","RNA_polymerase_III","TRNA","RRNA","Small_RNA","Cell_nucleus","Cytosol","RNA_polymerase_IV","Small_interfering_RNA","RNA_polymerase_V","SiRNA","Heterochromatin","Chloroplast","Chloroplast","Mitochondria","Archaea","Halophile","Orthopoxvirus","DNA_polymerase","Reverse_transcriptase","Bacteriophage","T7_RNA_polymerase","RNA-dependent_RNA_polymerase","Polio","Phosphocellulose_column","Glycerol_gradient_centrifugation","DNA_column","Ion_Exchange_Chromatography","Transcription_(genetics)","DNA_polymerase","T7_RNA_polymerase","RNA_polymerase_I","RNA_polymerase_II","RNA_polymerase_III","Alpha-amanitin"]}
