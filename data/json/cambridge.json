It lies in East Anglia, on the River\nCam, about north of London. According to the United Kingdom Census 2001, its\npopulation was 108,863 (including 22,153 students), and was estimated to be\n130,000 in mid-2010.<ref></ref> This makes Cambridge the second largest city in\nCambridgeshire after Peterborough. There is archaeological evidence of\nsettlement in the area during the Bronze Age and Roman times; under Viking rule\nCambridge became an important trading centre. The first town charters were\ngranted in the 12th century, although city status was not conferred until 1951.\n\nCambridge is most widely known as the home of the University of Cambridge,\nfounded in 1209 and consistently ranked one of the top five universities in the\nworld.<ref></ref> The university includes the renowned Cavendish Laboratory,\nKing's College Chapel, and the Cambridge University Library. The Cambridge\nskyline is dominated by the last two buildings, along with the chimney of\nAddenbrooke's Hospital in the far south of the city and St John's College\nChapel tower.\n\nToday, Cambridge is at the heart of the high-technology centre known as Silicon\nFen&nbsp;– a play on Silicon Valley and the fens surrounding the city. Its\neconomic strengths lie in industries such as software and bioscience, many start-\nup companies having been spun out of the university. Over 40% of the workforce\nhave a higher education qualification, more than twice the national average.\n\nThe green space of Parker's Piece hosted the first ever game of association\nfootball, and the Strawberry Fair music and arts festival is held on Midsummer\nCommon. Cambridge is adjacent to the M11 and A14 roads, and is around 49 minutes\nfrom London Kings Cross by non-stop train, with other rail links to Norwich,\nBirmingham and elsewhere.\n","title":"cambridge","headings":["History","Governance","Geography","Demography","Economy","Transport","Education","Culture","Public services","Religion","Twinned cities","See
