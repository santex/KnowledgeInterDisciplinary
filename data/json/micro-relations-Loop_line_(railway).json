Significantly longer than a passing loop,\n  its purpose may be purely to provide a bypassing route, or it may provide a\n  goods or passenger service in its own right, such as the Hertford Loop line.\n* A configuration, sometimes known as a balloon loop where trains entering it\n  turn though a half circle and return to the start of the loop facing in the\n  opposite direction from which they came, such as the Sutton Loop.\n* A totally enclosed system whereby trains always remain in the loop, as in the\n  London Underground Circle line.\n","linknr":75,"url":"Loop_line_(railway)","recorded":1362564915,"links":10,"instances":["london_underground"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Railway loop lines","Railway track layouts"],"headings":["See also"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["circle_line","london_underground"]],"members":["circle_line"],"related":["Passing_loop","Hertford_Loop","Balloon_loop","Circle_Line_(London_Underground)","Circle_line","Railway_line"]}
