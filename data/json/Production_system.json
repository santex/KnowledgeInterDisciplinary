{"cursor":"9103","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nA 'production system' (or 'production rule system') is a computer program\ntypically used to provide some form of artificial intelligence, which consists\nprimarily of a set of rules about behavior. These rules, termed 'productions',\nare a basic representation found useful in automated planning, expert systems\nand action selection. A production system provides the mechanism necessary to\nexecute productions in order to achieve some goal for the system.\n\nProductions consist of two parts: a sensory precondition (or \"IF\" statement) and\nan action (or \"THEN\"). If a production's precondition matches the current state\nof the world, then the production is said to be triggered. If a production's\naction is executed, it is said to have fired. A production system also contains\na database, sometimes called working memory, which maintains data about current\nstate or knowledge, and a rule interpreter. The rule interpreter must provide a\nmechanism for prioritizing productions when more than one is triggered.\n","linknr":132,"url":"Production_system","recorded":1362372553,"links":18,"instances":["computers","computer_science"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Logic programming","Expert systems"],"headings":["Basic operation","Matching production rules against working memory","Choosing which rules to evaluate","Using production systems","Related systems","References","See also"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["state","computer_science"],["execution","computers"]],"members":["execution","state"],"related":["Artificial_intelligence","Knowledge_representation","Automated_planning_and_scheduling","Expert_systems","Action_selection","State_(computer_science)","Execution_(computers)","Working_memory","Forward_chaining","BDI_software_agent","Inference_engine","Pattern_matching","Rete_algorithm","Charles_Forgy","Carnegie_Mellon_University","OPS5","Rewriting","Expert_system","CLIPS","ILOG","Drools","Jess_programming_language","CLIPS","Prolog","Lisp-based_Intelligent_Software_Agents","DTRules","OpenL_Tablets","Action_selection_mechanism","Expert_system","Inference_engine","L-system","OPS5","Production_Rule_Representation","Rete_algorithm"]}
