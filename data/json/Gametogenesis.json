{"cursor":"3750","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Gametogenesis' is a biological process by which diploid or haploid precursor\ncells undergo cell division and differentiation to form mature haploid gametes.\nDepending on the biological life cycle of the organism, gametogenesis occurs by\nmeiotic division of diploid gametocytes into various gametes, or by mitotic\ndivision of haploid gametogenous cells. For example, plants produce gametes\nthrough mitosis in gametophytes. The gametophytes grow from haploid spores after\nsporic meiosis. The existence of a multicellular, haploid phase in the life\ncycle between meiosis and gametogenesis is also referred to as alternation of\ngenerations.\n","linknr":254,"url":"Gametogenesis","recorded":1362374352,"links":27,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Developmental biology","Reproductive system","Germ cells"],"headings":["In animals","In gametangia","In flowering plants","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/Gray7.png/400px-Gray7.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Biology","Diploid","Haploid","Precursor_cell","Cell_division","Gamete","Biological_life_cycle","Organism","Meiosis","Gametocyte","Mitosis","Plants","Alternation_of_generations","Gonad","Male","Female","Sexual_reproduction","Primordial_germ_cells","Endoderm","Yolk_sac","Gonadal_ridge","Mitosis","Gametogonium","Gametocytogenesis","Gametidogenesis","Meiosis","Gametid","Gametangium","Zygomycota","Hypha","Zygote","Pollen","Anther","Pollination","Pollen_tube","Embryo_sac","Ovule","Microgametogenesis"]}
