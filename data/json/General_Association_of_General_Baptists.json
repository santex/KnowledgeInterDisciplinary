{"cursor":"10501","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'General Association of General Baptists' - a group of Baptists holding the\ngeneral atonement (that Christ died for all persons), located mostly in the\nMidwestern United States.\n\nThough theologically similar to the General Baptists in England and early\nAmerica, this body of General Baptists arose in the Midwestern United States in\nthe 19th century through the work of Benoni Stinson (1789-1869), a United\nBaptist minister first in Kentucky and then in Indiana. Stinson was ordained in\nKentucky in 1821, and evidently was already leaning toward or embracing Arminian\ntheology. Shortly after he moved to Indiana, in 1822 the Wabash District\nAssociation decided to divide into two bodies, for convenience sake. Stinson's\nchurch would be in the new body, and he labored to have a statement that \"the\npreaching that Christ tasted death for every man shall be no bar to fellowship\"\nwould be included in the articles of faith. The next fall, in 1823, the Liberty\nBaptist Church of Howell, Indiana was organized with 33 members, and Elder\nStinson was called as pastor. Three other churches were soon organized, all in\nthe Evansville, Indiana area. In October 1824, representatives from these four\nchurches came together and organized the Liberty Association of General\nBaptists. This appears to be the first time the name \"General\" was officially\nassociated with this movement. A number of General Baptist local associations\nwere organized from 1824 to 1870. During this period, some attempts were made by\nthe Liberty Association to correspond with the northern Free Will Baptists, but\nthis appears to have eventually proved unsatisfactory to both parties. In 1870,\na convention was called to meet with Harmony church, Gallatin County, Illinois,\nwith the idea of organizing a general association comprising all the annual\nGeneral Baptist associations. Delegates from Liberty, Mt. Olivet and Ohio\nassociations gathered and formed the General Association of General Baptists.\nThis body has grown and developed until it now embraces about 60 associations,\n816 churches and more than 73,000 members. The denominational headquarters are\nlocated in Poplar Bluff, Missouri, where they operate Stinson Press. The\nofficial denominational publication is The General Baptist Messenger. The\nGeneral Association oversees publication of Sunday School literature, a home\nmission board, a foreign mission board, and the Oakland City University in\nOakland City, Indiana. The General Association is a member of the National\nAssociation of Evangelicals and the Baptist World Alliance.\n\n   I. GOD We believe that there is only one true, living, and eternal God and\n      that the Godhead is revealed as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.\n(A) One True and Eternal God: Deut. 6:4; 33:27; Jer. 10:10; Matt. 3:15-16;\n    28:19; Mk. 12:29; Jn. 14:9-11; 10:30; Rom. 8:9- 11; I Cor. 8:4-6; II Cor.\n    3:17; I Thess. 1:9; I Tim. 1:17; 2:5; 6:17; Heb. 1:1-13; 3:12.\n(B) The Godhead:\n1. God as Father: Gen. 1:1; Matt. 6:9; Eph. 4:6.\n2. God as Son: Isa. 9:6; Matt. 16:16; Jn. 1:1; 3:14, 16; 14:28; I Cor. 15:28;\n   Heb. 1:8. Virgin Birth of Jesus: Matt. 1:18-25; Lk. 1:26-38.\n3. God as Holy Spirit: Jn. 14:16, 26; Acts 1:5, 8; 2:1-4; Rom. 8:16.\n\n  II. THE BIBLE We believe that the Holy Scriptures are the Old and New\n      Testaments, the inspired and infallible Word of God, and therein is found\n      the only reliable guide of Christian faith and conduct.\n(A) The Inspired Revelation: Lk. 24:44-46; Rom. 16:25-26; II Tim. 3:15-17; Heb.\n    1:1-2; II Pet. 1:20-21.\n(B) The Infallible Word: Isa. 40:8; Lk. 21:33; Jn. 17:17; Titus 1:2; I Pet.1:25.\n(C) The Reliable Guide: Deut. 6:6-9; Ps. 19:7-10; 119:105, 140; Jn. 5:39; Acts\n    17:11-12; Rom. 10:14-15; 15:4; II Tim. 3:16-17.\n\n III. MAN We believe that God created man in His own image to bring Him honor\n      through obedience, and that when man disobeyed, he became a fallen and\n      sinful creature, unable to save himself. We believe that infants are in\n      the covenant of God's grace and that all persons become accountable to God\n      when they reach a state of moral responsibility.\n(A) Man's Origin: Gen. 1:26-27; 2:7; Ps. 8:5.\n(B) Man's Purpose: Gen. 1:28-31; 2:15-25; Isa. 43:7.\n(C) Man's Sin: Gen. 3:1-24; Ps. 51:5; Jer. 13:23; Rom. 1:18-3:23; 5:12-\n    21; 7:1-25.\n(D) Man's Accountability: Matt. 19:13-15; Rom. 4:15; 5:13; 6:16; Heb. 11:24-26.\n\n  IV. SALVATION We believe that salvation (regeneration, sanctification,\n      justification and redemption) has been provided for all mankind through\n      the redemptive work (life, death, resurrection, ascension, and\n      intercession) of Jesus Christ, and that this salvation can be received\n      only through repentance toward God and faith toward our Lord\n\n   V. CHRISTIAN DUTIES We believe that Christians should live faithfully by\n      serving in and through the local church, praying diligently,\n      witnessing earnestly, practicing tolerance, showing loving kindness,\n      giving as God prospers, and conducting themselves in such a way as to\n      bring glory to God.\n(A) Faithful Service: I Chron. 16:11; Ps. 101:6; Matt. 28:18-20; Jn. 15:7-14;\n    Rom. 12:14; I Cor. 13; II Cor. 8, 9; Eph. 4, 6; Heb. 12:1.\n(B) Prayer: II Chron. 7:14; Dan. 6:10; Matt. 6:1-13; 26:41; Lk. 18:1; I\n    Thess. 5:17.\n(C) Witnessing: Matt. 28:19-20; Acts 1:8.\n(D) Tolerance: Matt. 18:15-17; Lk. 10:27; Gal. 5:22-23; II Pet. 1:5- 9.\n(E) Loving Kindness: Jn. 13:35; I Jn. 3:11; 4:7, 11-12.\n(F) Financial Stewardship: Matt. 23:23; I Cor. 16:2; II Cor. 9:6-7.\n\n VII. THE CHURCH We believe that the Church Universal is the Body of Christ, the\n      fellowship of all believers, and that its members have been called out\n      from the world to come under the dominion and authority of Christ, its\n      head. We believe that a local church is a fellowship of Christians, a part\n      of the Body of Christ, voluntarily banded together for worship, nurture,\n      and service.\n(A) The Church Universal: Matt. 16:18; Jn. 10:10; I Cor. 3:16; 12:12-14, 27;\n    Eph. 1:22-23; Col. 1:18, 24; Heb. 12:23.\n(B) The Local Church: Matt. 18:17; Acts 2:38-47; 11:19-30; Rev. 1:4; 3:22. 1.\n(C) Worship and Service: Rom. 12:1; I Cor. 14:12, 23-25; Heb. 10:25; Ja. 1:26-\n    27.\n2. Nurture: Eph. 4; II Pet. 1:2-8; 3:18.\n\nVIII. ORDINANCES We believe that baptism and the Lord's Supper are ordinances\n      instituted by Christ to be observed by Christians only. We also believe\n      that the Biblical mode of baptism is immersion and that participation in\n      the Lord's Supper should be open to all Christians. (Note: Several\n      associations and local churches recognize feet-washing as an ordinance. We\n      believe that this should be left to the individual, and that neither the\n      practice nor the non-practice of it should be any bar to fellowship,\n      either in the church, the local association, the Presbytery, or the\n      General Association. Jn. 13; I Tim. 5:10.)\n(A) Baptism:\n1. Instituted: Matt. 3:13-15; 28:19.\n2. Subjects: Acts 2:41; 8:12, 37-38; 10:47-48; 16:30-33; 19:5.\n3. Biblical Mode: Rom. 6:3-5; Col. 2:12.\n4.

Salvation: Heb. 5:9; I Thess. 5:9; I Pet. 1:9; Heb. 7:25.\n   Regeneration: Jn. 3:3-8; 1:11-13; I Pet. 1:23; Eph. 2:1-10; II Cor. 5:17; II\n   Pet. 1:4; Titus 3:5. Sanctification: I Cor. 1:30; Eph. 5:26; Heb. 10:9-10,\n   29; II Tim. 2:21; Heb. 13:12; Rom. 12:1-2; I Pet. 1:2. Justification: Rom.\n   3:20-24; 5:1-2, 18; 8:30-33; Acts 13:38-39; I Cor. 6:11; II Cor. 5:21.\n   Redemption: Matt. 20:28; Isa. 53:6; Col. 1:14; Titus 2:14; I Pet. 1:18-19;\n   Rev. 5:9. Christ's Redemptive Work: Jn. 3:16; Rom. 5:8; Heb. 2:9; Rev. 22:17;\n   II Pet. 3:9; Jn 14:6; Acts 4:12; Rom. 6:23; Eph. 2:8-9. Life and Death: Rom.\n   5:10; Heb. 9:12-15; Jn. 10:11; I Jn. 3:16.

Repentance: Isa.\n   55:6-7; Lk. 24:47; Lk. 13:3-5; Acts 2:38; I Thess. 1:9-10. Faith: Jn. 3:16-\n   18; Heb. 11:1, 6; I Pet. 1:5.\n\n   V. ASSURANCE AND ENDURANCE We believe that those who abide in Christ have the\n      assurance of salvation. However, we believe that the Christian retains his\n      freedom of choice; therefore, it is possible for him to turn away from God\n      and be finally lost.\n(A) Assurance: Matt. 28:20; I Cor. 10:13; Heb. 5:9.\n(B) Endurance: Matt. 10:22; Lk. 9:62; Col. 1:23; Rev. 2:10-11; 3:3-5.\n(C) Warnings: Jn. 15:6; Rom. 11:20-23; Gal. 5:4; Heb. 3:12; 10:26-29; II\n    Pet. 2:20-21.\n(D) Finally Lost: Jn. 15:6; I Cor. 9:27; Heb. 6:4-6. Purpose: I Cor. 11:26.\n\n  IX. THE LORD'S DAY We believe in the Sanctity of the Lord's Day, the first day\n      of the week, and that this day ought to be observed by worshiping God,\n      witnessing for Christ, and ministering to the needs of humanity. We\n      believe that secular work on Sunday should be limited to cases of\n      necessity or mercy.\n(A) Sanctity: Ex. 20:8; Isa. 58:13-14.\n(B) Observance: Mk. 2:27:28; Lk. 4:1-16; 14:1-6; Acts 20:7; I Cor. 16:2;\n    Rev. 1:10.\n\n   X. LAST THINGS We believe in the personal return of Jesus Christ, and in the\n      bodily resurrection of the dead. We believe that God will judge all\n      mankind by Jesus Christ; that He will reward the righteous with eternal\n      life in heaven, and that He will banish the unrighteous to everlasting\n      punishment in hell.\n(A) Return: Matt. 24, 25; Lk. 12:40; Jn. 14:3; Acts 1:11; I Jn. 3:2; Rev. 1:7.\n(B) Resurrection: Jn. 5:25, 28-29; 6:40; 11:24-25; Rom. 8:11; I Cor.15; Phil.\n    3:21; I Thess. 4:16-17; Rev. 20:4-6. (\nC) Judgment and Reward: Matt. 25:21; Mk. 9:43-48; Jn. 5:27; Acts 17:31; Rom.\n   2:16; 14:12; II Cor. 5:1, 10; Col. 3:24; II Thess. 1:7- 10; Heb. 9:27; II\n   Pet. 3:8-13; Jude 21; Rev. 2:7; 14:13;
