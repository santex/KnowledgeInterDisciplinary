This\nmeans that FBS independents are not required to schedule each other for\ncompetition like conference schools do. There are many fewer independent schools\nthan in years past; many independent schools join, or attempt to join,\nestablished conferences, usually in order to gain a share of television revenue\nand access to bowl games that agree to take teams from certain conferences, and\nin order to help deal with otherwise potentially difficult challenges in\nscheduling opponents to play throughout the season.\n\nAll Division I FBS independents are eligible for a Bowl Championship Series bowl\nprovided they meet eligibility requirements. Notre Dame receives an automatic\nbid by finishing in the top eight of the final BCS ranking. Navy and Army have\nagreements with the Military Bowl (formerly the EagleBank Bowl), Tenorio,\nPaul.

September 11, 2008.\nRetrieved October 5, 2008. and Notre Dame, in addition to its BCS\nagreement, has other bowl agreements as part of its affiliation with the\nAtlantic Coast Conference (ACC). (Notre Dame had similar agreements with its\nprevious conference, the Big East.) BYU has an agreement with the Armed Forces\nBowl for 2011. [http://www.deseretnews.com/article/700130590/BYU-football-Cougars-\nenter-agreement-with-Armed-Forces-Bowl.html]\n\nThe ranks of football independents increased by one starting with the 2011\nseason with the announcement that BYU would leave the Mountain West Conference\nto become a football independent starting with that season. The ranks increased by two in 2013 when the WAC dropped football\nand New Mexico State and Idaho did not have a conference for football. http://www.cbssports.com/collegefootball/blog/eye-on-college-\nfootball/20165368/new-mexico-state-makes-it-official-will-go-independent-in-\n2013- The ranks of football independents will decrease by two in 2014 with\nthe return of Idaho and New Mexico State as football-only members of the Sun\nBelt Conference, and by one more\nin 2015 with the announcement that Navy will join the American Athletic\nConference as a football only member.
