The Echoes were originally made up from\nâThe Spacemen skiffle groupâ which were Joe Browns skiffle group. Joe was a\nregular on [[Boy Meets Girls]] a television show with Marty Wilde. The Spacemen\nhad no other work while Joe was contracted to do the show so they were able to\ndo this tour with Chris Wayne as \"The Echoes\". Original line up was: Chris Wayne\n(vocals), Tony Oakman (rhythm guitar), George Staff (rhythm guitar), Peter\nOakman (bass), Bert Crome (drums). As Joe Brown was usually the lead guitarist\nanother one had to be found for the tour and he was Dave Burns (lead guitar).\nAfter the tour The Echoes disbanded with Tony Oakman, George Staff,Peter Oakman,\nBert Crome returning to Joe Brown as his group The Bruvvers. Later Peter Oakman\nwould go on to play bass for Lonnie Donegan which he did until Lonnieâs death.\nChris Wayne continued to work solo, Dave Burns went to work with Wee Willie\nHarris in Italy.\n\n'(1961)' Chris Wayne had another tour this time with Gene Vincent so he decided\nto reform The Echoes. Chris had a drummer Laurie Jay but needed guitar, piano\nand bass. The Dynamos agreed to do this tour as The Echoes as they had recently\nparted from Sonny Stewart. The Dynamos became The Echoes to accompany Gene\nVincent when he visited Britain at the beginning of 1961. The line up of this\ngroup was Laurie Jay (drums), Tony Collins (guitar), Les Smith (piano) and\nDouggie Reece (bass). During this tour Tony Collins had a car accident and was\nunable to continue. For the remainder of the tour he was replaced by Big Jim\nSullivan (originally from Marty Wilde's Wildcats and later Musical Director for\nTom Jones) on guitar. After such a successful tour it was decided to continue\nThe Echoes, as with their ability to stand alone as a band and to also play for\nother artists, plenty of work including touring was assured. Les Smith (piano)\nleft the group after the tour to continue his career as an architect. His\nreplacement was Ian Hines (piano), and brother of Frazer Hines who played Jamie\nin the Doctor Who television series. Tony Collins (guitar) was unable to\ncontinue due to the car accident so interim guitarists Billy Kuy (ex- Mike Berry\n& The Outlaws)and Vic Briggs(later with Eric Burdon & The Animals) were used\nuntil a permanent guitarist could be found. This was Dave Burns who had just\nreturned from Italy and was also a founder member of the original group. Ian\nHines (piano) went to work in Hamburg and was replaced in 1961 by Perry Ford a\nvery talented musician/singer/songwriter. Perry left in early 1962 to pursue his\nown career. He would have his own hits a few years later with a group called The\nIvy League. Records: \"Funny How Love Can Be\" and \"Tossing and Turning\". Ian\nHines returned from Hamburg and came back into the group.\n\n'(1962)' The Echoes had one last show to do on The Jerry Lee Lewis tour at The\nTower Ballroom New Brighton playing for Jerry Lee Lewis, when Laurie Jay left\nthe group. A drummer was needed that night so a local drummer was brought in and\nhe was Ringo Starr who had just returned from Hamburg playing for Rory Storm and\nThe Hurricanes. Laurie Jay went into management and was to later become the\nmanager for Billy Ocean and Shirley Bassey. On returning to London Tommy Frost\nthen became The Echoes new drummer. After this tour Ian Hines also left for\nHamburg again, and was replaced by Ray Murray on keyboards.\n\n'(May 1962)' The Echoes line up at this time was now: Tommy Frost (drums), Dave\nBurns (guitar), Ray Murray (keyboards), and Douggie Reece (bass).\n\n'(September 1963)' After 18 months of heavy work, recording and a summer season\n(1962) on the Isle of Mann and another in Jersey (1963) some of the band members\ndecided to pursue their own dreams. Dave Burns went on to form a duo with his\nwife. Tommy Frost decided to stay in Jersey for a while. Pete Clifford from the\nJesters took Dave Burns place on guitar. Shortly after the group returned to\nLondon Ray Murray left to go back to Scotland.\n\n'Audition [[Dusty Springfield]]:-'\n\nThe audition to play for Dusty was with Douggie Reece (bass), Micky Garrett\n(organ), Martin Gibbs (stand in drummer for Tommy Frost) and Pete Clifford (lead\nguitar).

Between Oct 1964 and May 1965 drummer Carlo Little was a member\nof the band.\n\n'(1965)' Both Pete Clifford (guitar), Micky Garrett (keyboards) left to form\ntheir own group in early 1965. Clifford subsequently played with The 004,\nFloribunda Rose and The Bats. Their replacements were Vic Briggs (guitar) and\nJimmy OâBrien (keyboards).\n\nDusty wanted to add a front line and more rhythm section to the group, so the\nline-up became Ian Harper (Trumpet 1), Derek Andrews (Trumpet 2), Derek\nWadsworth (Trombone), Tony Scott (Percussion), Vic Briggs (guitar), Jimmy\nOâBrien (keyboards), Johnny Dryden (drums), Douggie Reece (bass).
