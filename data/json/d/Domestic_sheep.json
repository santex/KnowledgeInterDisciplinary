Like all ruminants, sheep are members of the order Artiodactyla, the\neven-toed ungulates. Although the name \"sheep\" applies to many species in the\ngenus [[Ovis]], in everyday usage it almost always refers to Ovis aries.\nNumbering a little over one billion, domestic sheep are also the most numerous\nspecies of sheep.\n\nSheep are most likely descended from the wild mouflon of Europe and Asia. One of\nthe earliest animals to be domesticated for agricultural purposes, sheep are\nraised for fleece, meat (lamb, hogget or mutton) and milk. A sheep's wool is the\nmost widely used animal fiber, and is usually harvested by shearing. meat is\ncalled lamb when from younger animals and mutton when from older ones. Sheep\ncontinue to be important for wool and meat today, and are also occasionally\nraised for pelts, as dairy animals, or as model organisms for science.\n\nSheep husbandry is practised throughout the majority of the inhabited world, and\nhas been fundamental to many civilizations. In the modern era, Australia, New\nZealand, the southern and central South American nations, and the British Isles\nare most closely associated with sheep production.\n\nSheepraising has a large lexicon of unique terms which vary considerably by\nregion and dialect. Use of the word sheep began in Middle English as a\nderivation of the Old English word scÄap; it is both the singular and plural\nname for the animal. A group of sheep is called a flock, herd or mob. Adult\nfemale sheep are referred to as ewes, intact males as rams or occasionally tups,\ncastrated males as wethers, and younger sheep as lambs. Many other specific\nterms for the various life stages of sheep exist, generally related to lambing,\nshearing, and age.\n\nBeing a key animal in the history of farming, sheep have a deeply entrenched\nplace in human culture, and find representation in much modern language and\nsymbology. As livestock, sheep are most often associated with pastoral, Arcadian\nimagery. Sheep figure in many mythologiesâsuch as the Golden Fleeceâand major\nreligions, especially the Abrahamic traditions. In both ancient and modern\nreligious ritual, sheep are used as sacrificial animals.\n","linknr":1641,"url":"Domestic_sheep","recorded":1362480674,"links":191,"instances":["animal","sheep","christianity","medical","digestion","meteorology","predation","sheep","animal_disease","wool","business","material","animal","sheep","dentistry","cloned_sheep","mammalian_reproduction","eye","sheep","sheep","biology","sheep","genetics","sheep","ethology","sheep","anatomy","food","utopia"],"pdf":["http://www.napcsyr.org/dwnld-files/divisions/tpd/pubs/comd_brf/en/04_cbrf_sheep_en.pdf","http://www.napcsyr.org/dwnld-files/divisions/tpd/pubs/comd_brf/en/04_cbrf_sheep_en.pdf","http://ec.europa.eu/environment/chemicals/lab_animals/pdf/5th_stat_rep_lab_animals_en.pdf","http://ec.europa.eu/environment/chemicals/lab_animals/pdf/5th_stat_rep_lab_animals_en.pdf"],"categories":["Sheep","Megafauna","Herbivorous
