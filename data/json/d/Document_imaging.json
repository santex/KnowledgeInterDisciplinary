Document imaging systems can\ntake many forms including microfilm, on demand printers, facsimile machines,\ncopiers, multifunction printers, document scanners, computer output microfilm\n(COM) and archive writers. Since the 1990s, \"document imaging\" has been used to\ndescribe software-based computer systems that capture, store and reprint images.\n\nDocument imaging is a form of enterprise content management. In the early days\nof content management technologies, the term \"document imaging\" was used\ninterchangeably with \"document image management\" as the industry tried to\nseparate itself from the micrographic and reprographic technologies.\n\nIn the late 1980s, a new document management technology emerged: electronic\ndocument management. This technology was built around the need to manage and\nsecure the escalating volume of electronic documents (spreadsheets, word-\nprocessing documents, PDFs, e-mails) created in organizations.\n","linknr":104,"url":"Document_imaging","recorded":1362538582,"links":16,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Information technology management"],"headings":["See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Information_technology","Microfilm","Facsimile_machine","Copier","Multifunction_printer","Image_scanner","Software","Enterprise_content_management","Electronic_document_management_system","Spreadsheet","Word_processing","PDF","Email","Image_scanning","Document_management_system","Records_management"]}
