{"cursor":"7016","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" (sugar-ring) molecule with carbon atoms labeled using standard notation. The\n 5′ is upstream; the 3′ is downstream. DNA and RNA are synthesized\n in the 5′ to 3′ direction.]] 'Directionality', in molecular biology\n and biochemistry, is the end-to-end chemical orientation of a single strand of\n nucleic acid. The chemical convention of naming carbon atoms in the nucleotide\n sugar-ring numerically gives rise to a '5′'-end and a '3′'-end\n (usually pronounced \"five prime end\" and \"three prime end\"). The relative\n positions of structures along a strand of nucleic acid, including genes and\n various protein binding sites, are usually noted as being either upstream\n (towards the 5′-end) or downstream (towards the 3′-end). (See also\n upstream and downstream.)\n\nThis naming convention is important because nucleic acids can only be\nsynthesized in vivo in the 5′-to-3′ direction, as the polymerase\nthat assembles new strands only appends new nucleotides to the 3′-hydroxyl\n(-OH) group, via a phosphodiester bond. Directionality is related to, but\nindependent from sense. In coding DNA, codons read 5′âATGââ¯â3′ on\nthe sense strand, and 3′âTACââ¯â5′ on the complementary antisense\nstrand. Thus only the antisense strand will translate to sense\n(5′âAUGââ¯â3′) mRNA. By convention, single strands of DNA and RNA\nsequences are written in 5′-to-3′ direction.\n","linknr":167,"url":"Directionality_(molecular_biology)","recorded":1362672623,"links":26,"instances":["dna","genetics","molecular_biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["DNA","Molecular genetics","RNA"],"headings":["5&prime;-end","3&prime;-end","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f2/Nukleotid_num.svg/220px-Nukleotid_num.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e4/DNA_chemical_structure.svg/220px-DNA_chemical_structure.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/Phosphodiester_Bond_Diagram.svg/220px-Phosphodiester_Bond_Diagram.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["upstream_and_downstream","dna"],["sense","molecular_biology"],["sense","molecular_biology"],["translation","biology"],["translation","genetics"]],"members":["upstream_and_downstream","translation","sense"],"related":["DNA","RNA","Molecular_biology","Biochemistry","Nucleic_acid","Nucleotide","Furanose","Gene","Binding_site","Upstream_and_downstream_(DNA)","In_vivo","Polymerase","Hydroxyl","Phosphodiester_bond","Sense_(molecular_biology)","DNA","Codon","Start_codon","Sense_(molecular_biology)","Translation_(biology)","Start_codon","MRNA","DNA","RNA","Furanose","Deoxyribose","Ribose","Phosphate","DNA_ligase","Nucleotide","Phosphodiester_bond","Plasmid","DNA_cloning","Molecular_biology","Phosphatase","Messenger_RNA","5′_cap","Translation_(genetics)","Exonuclease","Methylated","Methylguanosine","Gene","Gene_promoter","Five_prime_untranslated_region","Ribosome_binding_site","Kozak_sequence","Hydroxyl","Furanose","DNA_ligase","Molecular_Biology","Nucleotides","DNA","DNA_sequencing","Messenger_RNA","Polyadenylation","Adenosine","Three_prime_untranslated_region"]}
