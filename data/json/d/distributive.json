In\npropositional logic, 'distribution' refers to two valid rules of replacement.\nThe rules allow one to reformulate conjunctions and disjunctions within\nlogical proofs.\n\nFor example, in arithmetic:\n: 2 × (1 + 3) = (2 × 1) + (2 × 3) but 2 /(1 + 3) ≠ (2 / 1) + (2 / 3).\n\nIn the left-hand side of the first equation, the 2 multiplies the sum of 1 and\n3; on the right-hand side, it multiplies the 1 and the 3 individually, with the\nproducts added afterwards. Because these give the same final answer (8), we say\nthat multiplication by 2 distributes over addition of 1 and 3. Since we could\nhave put any real numbers in place of 2, 1, and 3 above, and still have obtained\na true equation, we say that multiplication of real numbers distributes over\naddition of real numbers.\n","title":"Distributive%20property","headings":["Definition","Propositional logic","Examples","Distributivity and rounding","Distributivity in rings","Generalizations of distributivity","Notes","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["2: Real_number","2: Given_any","2: Bertrand_Russell","2: Alfred_Whitehead","2: Significant_digit","1: Abstract_algebra","1: Logic","1: Binary_operation","1: Elementary_algebra","1: Propositional_calculus","1: Validity","1: Rule_of_replacement","1: Logical_conjunction","1: Logical_disjunction","1: Formal_proof","1: Arithmetic","1: Multiplication","1: Addition","1: Binary_operator","1: Commutative","1: Logical_equivalence","1: Logical_connective","1: Well-formed_formula","1: Metalogic","1: Propositional_logic","1: Number","1: Natural_number","1: Complex_number","1: Cardinal_number","1: Ordinal_arithmetic#Multiplication","1: Ordinal_number","1: Cross_product","1: Vector_addition","1: Matrix_multiplication","1: Matrix_addition","1: Totally_ordered_set","1: Integer","1: Greatest_common_divisor","1: Least_common_multiple","1: Arithmetic_precision","1: Decimal_arithmetic","1: VAT","1: Rounding#Round_half_to_even","1: Distributive_lattice","1: Algebraic_structure","1: Boolean_ring","1: Boolean_lattice","1: Near-ring","1: Division_ring","1: Near-rig","1: Order_theory","1: Infinite_distributive_law","1: Interval_arithmetic","1: Category_theory","1: Natural_transformation","1: Lax_map_of_monads","1: Colax_map_of_monads","1: Distributive_law_between_monads","1: Generalized_distributive_law","1: Information_theory","1: Cut-the-knot"]}
