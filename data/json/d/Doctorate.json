From Rudolph Ackermann's History\n of Oxford, 1814.]]\n\nA 'doctorate' is an academic degree or professional degree that, in most\ncountries, qualifies the holder to teach at the university level in the specific\nfield of their certificate.\n\nIn some countries, the highest degree in a given field is called a terminal\ndegree, although this is by no means universal (the term is not in general use\nin the UK, for example), practice varies from country to country, and a\ndistinction is sometimes made between terminal professional degrees and terminal\nresearch degrees (such as the J.D. and J.S.D. or S.J.D. in law). See Forni,\nP. (1989). \"Models for Doctoral Programs: First Professional Degree or Terminal\nDegree?\" Nursing and Health Care, v. 10, n. 8, pp. 428â434.\n\nThe term doctorate comes from the Latin docere, meaning \"to teach.\"\n\nThe \"licentiate\" degree shortened from the full Latin title licentia docendi,\nmeans \"teaching licence\".
