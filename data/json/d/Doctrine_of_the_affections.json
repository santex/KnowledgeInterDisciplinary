{"cursor":"4711","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nThe 'doctrine of the affections', also known as the doctrine of affects,\ndoctrine of the passions, theory of the affects, or by the German term\n'Affektenlehre' (after the German Affekt; plural Affekte) was a theory in\nmusical aesthetics popular in the Baroque era (1600â1750). It derived from ancient theories of rhetoric\nand oratory (Buelow 2001), and was widely accepted by late-Baroque theorists and\ncomposers. The essential idea is that just one unified and \"rationalized\" Affekt\nshould be aimed at by any single piece or movement of music, and that to attempt\nmore was to risk confusion and disorder.\n\nAccording to one version of the theory there are three pairs of opposing\nemotions that make six \"affects\" all together: love/hate, joy/sorrow,\nwonder/desire. Another authority also mentions sadness, anger, and jealousy\n(Buelow 2001).\n\nLorenzo Giacomini (1552â1598) in his Orationi e discorsi (1597) defined an\naffection as \"a spiritual movement or operation of the mind in which it is\nattracted or repelled by an object it has come to know as a result of an\nimbalance in the animal spirits and vapours that flow continually throughout the\nbody\" (Giacomini 1597, ).\n\nThe doctrine fell out of use in the Classical era, when composers and theorists\nbegan to find it excessively mechanical and unnatural.\n\n\"Affections are not the same as emotions; however, they are a spiritual movement\nof the mind\" (Palisca 1991, 3).\n\nA prominent Baroque proponent of the Doctrine of the Affections was Johann\nMattheson (Poultney 1996, 107).\n","linknr":111,"url":"Doctrine_of_the_affections","recorded":1362889884,"links":23,"instances":["music","psychology","professor_of_music"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Baroque music"],"headings":["See also","References","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["classical_period","music"],["affect","psychology"],["john_tyrrell","professor_of_music"]],"members":["classical_period","affect","john_tyrrell"],"related":["Aesthetics","Baroque_music","Rhetoric","Public_speaking","Classical_period_(music)","Johann_Mattheson","Affect_(psychology)","Stanley_Sadie","John_Tyrrell_(professor_of_music)"]}
