The\nsymbol most often used for density is 'ρ' (the lower case Greek letter rho).\nMathematically, density is defined as mass divided by volume:<ref></ref>\n\n:<math> \\rho = \\frac{m}{V},</math>\n\nwhere ρ is the density, m is the mass, and V is the volume. In some cases (for\ninstance, in the United States oil and gas industry), density is also defined as\nits weight per unit volume,<ref></ref> although this quantity is more properly\ncalled specific weight.\n\nDifferent materials usually have different densities, and density may be\nrelevant to buoyancy, purity and packaging. Osmium and iridium are the densest\nknown 'elements' at standard conditions for temperature and pressure but certain\nchemical compounds may be denser.\n\nLess dense fluids float on more dense fluids if they do not mix. This concept\ncan be extended, with some care, to less dense solids floating on more dense\nfluids. If the average density (including any air below the waterline) of an\nobject is less than water it will float in water and if it is more than water it\nwill sink in water.\n\nDensity is sometimes expressed by the dimensionless quantity \"specific gravity\"\nor \"relative density\", i.e. the ratio of the density of the material to that of\na standard material, usually water. Thus a specific gravity less than one means\nthat the substance floats in water.\n\nThe density of a material varies with temperature and pressure. This variation\nis typically small for solids and liquids but much greater for gases. Increasing\nthe pressure on an object decreases the volume of the object and thus increases\nits density. Increasing the temperature of a substance (with a few exceptions)\ndecreases its density by increasing its volume. In most materials, heating the\nbottom of a fluid results in convection of the heat from the bottom to the top,\ndue to the decrease in the density of the heated fluid. This causes it to rise\nrelative to more dense unheated material.\n\nThe reciprocal of the density of a substance is occasionally called its specific\nvolume, a term sometimes used in thermodynamics. Density is an intensive\nproperty in that increasing the amount of a substance does not increase its\ndensity; rather it increases its mass.\n","title":"Density","headings":["History","Measurement of density","Changes of density","Density of solutions","Densities","Other common units","See also","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["4: Water","3: Kilogram","2: Volume","2: Specific_weight","2: Buoyancy","2: Osmium","2: Iridium","2: Standard_conditions_for_temperature_and_pressure","2: Gold","2: SI","2: Gram","2: US_customary_units","2: Bulk_density","2: Silicon","2: Earth","2: Event_horizon","1: Mass","1: Weight","1: Packaging","1: Dimensionless","1: Specific_gravity","1: Relative_density","1: Convection","1: Specific_volume","1: Thermodynamics","1: Intensive_property","1: Archimedes","1: Hiero_II_of_Syracuse","1: Goldsmith","1: Wreath","1: Alloy","1: Vitruvius","1: De_architectura","1: Cubic_metre","1: Cgs","1: Cubic_centimetre","1: Weighing_scale","1: Hydrometer","1: Dasymeter","1: Hydrostatic_weighing","1: Pressure","1: Temperature","1: Compressibility","1: Thermal_expansivity","1: Kelvin","1: Celsius","1: Ideal_gas","1: Molar_mass","1: Gas_constant","1: Absolute_temperature","1: Solution","1: Volume_concentration","1: Supercooling","1: Helium","1: Aerographite","1: Metallic_microlattice","1: Aerogel","1: Air","1: Tungsten_hexafluoride","1: Liquid_hydrogen","1: Styrofoam","1: Lithium","1: Wood","1: Potassium","1: Sodium","1: Ice","1: Plastics","1: Polypropylene","1: PETE","1: PVC","1: Tetrachloroethene","1: Magnesium","1: Beryllium","1: Glycerol","1: Aluminium","1: Diiodomethane","1: Diamond","1: Titanium","1: Selenium","1: Vanadium","1: Antimony","1: Zinc","1: Chromium","1: Manganese","1: Tin","1: Iron","1: Niobium","1: Cadmium","1: Cobalt","1: Nickel","1: Copper","1: Bismuth","1: Molybdenum","1: Silver","1: Lead","1: Thorium","1: Rhodium","1: Tantalum","1: Uranium","1: Tungsten","1: Plutonium","1: Platinum","1: Interstellar_medium","1: Inner_Core","1: Sun","1: Sagittarius_A*","1: White_dwarf","1: Ohio_State_University","1: Atomic_nuclei","1: Neutron_star","1: Black_hole","1: Cubic_meter","1: Liter","1: Milliliter","1: Metric_ton","1: Solid","1: Liquid","1: Avoirdupois_ounce","1: Cubic_inch","1: Cubic_foot","1: Cubic_yard","1: US_liquid_gallon","1: Bushel","1: Imperial_units","1: Precious_metal","1: Troy_weight","1: List_of_elements_by_density","1: Charge_density","1: Dord","1: Energy_density","1: Lighter_than_air","1: Number_density","1: Orthobaric_density","1: Standard_temperature_and_pressure","1: Girolami_method"]}
