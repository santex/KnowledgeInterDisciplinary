They are members of\n  the North Division of the National Football Conference (NFC) in the\n  National Football League (NFL), and play their home games at Ford Field\n  in Downtown Detroit.\n\nOriginally based in Portsmouth, Ohio and called the '[[Portsmouth Spartans]]',\nthe team began play in 1929 as an independent professional\nteam, [http://www.footballresearch.com/articles/frpage.cfm?topic=stapes\nFootballresearch] one of many such teams in the Ohio and Scioto River\nvalleys. For the 1930 season, the Spartans formally joined the NFL as the other\narea independents folded because of the Great Depression. Despite success within\nthe NFL, they could not survive in Portsmouth, then the NFL's smallest city. The\nteam was purchased and moved to Detroit for the 1934 season.\n\nThe Lions have won four NFL Championships, the last in 1957, giving the club the\nsecond-longest NFL championship drought behind the Arizona Cardinals. The Lions\nhave not had much success during the Super Bowl era: the Lions are one of four\ncurrent NFL teams that have yet to qualify for the Super Bowl, and the team is\n1â10 in post-season play during that period. The 2008 team became the only team\nin NFL history to lose all 16 regular season games since the NFL went to a 16-\ngame schedule in 1978.\n","linknr":1195,"url":"Detroit_Lions","recorded":1362480538,"links":66,"instances":["american_football","sportscaster","sportscaster","nfl","nfl","bloomington","football_player","american_football","radio","detroit","football","american_football"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Sports
