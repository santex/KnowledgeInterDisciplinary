Types of density include:\n\nIn 'physics', density of mass:\n* Density, mass per unit volume ** The Planck density, the derived unit of\n  density in the Planck unit system (1 Planck mass divided by 1 Planck volume)\n* Area density or surface density, mass over a (two-dimensional) area\n* Linear density, mass over a (one-dimensional) line\n* Bulk density, mass of many particles of a particulate solid or a powder\n  divided by the total volume they occupy\n* Particle density or true density, density of the particles that make up a\n  particulate solid or a powder\n* Relative density or specific gravity, a measure of density in comparison\n  to the density of something else ** Vapour density, a relative density\n  used for gases\n\nIn physics, densities of entities other than mass:\n* Number density, number of particles per unit volume, area, or length\n* Current density, the ratio of electric current to area\n* Charge density, the electric charge per volume\n* Energy density, potential energy per unit volume or mass, depending on context\n* Force density, force per unit volume\n* Optical density, the absorbance of an element\n\nIn 'mathematics':\n* Dense set and nowhere dense set in topology\n* Schnirelmann density in number theory\n* Natural density (also called asymptotic density) in number theory\n* Lebesgue's density theorem in measure theory\n* Probability density function, a function which maps probabilities across the\n  real line and whose integral is 1 **Density estimation is the construction\n  of an estimate of a probability density function **Kernel density\n  estimation, used in statistics to estimate a probability density function of\n  a random variable\n* Tensor density in differential geometry\n* Density in graph theory, the fraction of possible edges that exist in a graph\n* Dense-in-itself, in geometry, is a set that contains no isolated points\n* Dense order in order theory\n* A coinitial subset in the mathematical theory of forcing\n* Density (polytope) in geometry\n* Density on a manifold\n* Dense submodule in abstract algebra\n\nIn 'other scientific fields':\n* Population density, population per unit area\n* Memory storage density, bits (how computers store information) over an amount\n  of area or volume\n* Urban density, in urban planning and urban design\n\n'Density' can also refer to:\n* Spiritual density, levels of spiritual evolution, planes of existence or\n  \"dimensions\" in The Law of One\n* Stupidity, a stupid person is sometimes referred to as being \"dense\"\n","linknr":144,"url":"Density_(disambiguation)","recorded":1362576049,"links":35,"instances":["film","physics","polytope","mathematics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Mathematical disambiguation"],"headings":["See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/5f/Disambig_gray.svg/30px-Disambig_gray.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["forcing","mathematics"],["density","polytope"],["dense","film"],["intensity","physics"]],"members":["dense","intensity","density","forcing"],"related":["Mass","Density","Planck_density","Area_density","Linear_density","Bulk_density","Particle_density","Relative_density","Specific_gravity","Vapour_density","Number_density","Current_density","Charge_density","Energy_density","Force_density","Absorbance","Dense_set","Nowhere_dense_set","Schnirelmann_density","Natural_density","Lebesgue's_density_theorem","Probability_density_function","Density_estimation","Kernel_density_estimation","Tensor_density","Dense_graph","Dense-in-itself","Dense_order","Forcing_(mathematics)","Density_(polytope)","Density_on_a_manifold","Dense_submodule","Population_density","Memory_storage_density","Urban_density","Spiritual_density","Stupidity","Dense_(film)","Concentration","Flux","Intensity_(physics)"]}
