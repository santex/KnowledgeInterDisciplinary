Their main function is to process antigen material and present it on the\nsurface to other cells of the immune system. That is, dendritic cells function\nas antigen-presenting cells. They act as messengers between the innate and\nadaptive immunity.\n\nDendritic cells are present in tissues in contact with the external environment,\nsuch as the skin (where there is a specialized dendritic cell type called\nLangerhans cells) and the inner lining of the nose, lungs, stomach and\nintestines. They can also be found in an immature state in the blood. Once\nactivated, they migrate to the lymph nodes where they interact with T cells and\nB cells to initiate and shape the adaptive immune response. At certain\ndevelopment stages they grow branched projections, the [[Dendrite (non-\nneuronal)|dendrites]] that give the cell its name (Î´Î­Î½Î´ÏÎ¿Î½ or dÃ©ndron being\nGreek for \"tree\"). While similar in appearance, these are distinct structures\nfrom the dendrites of neurons. Immature dendritic cells are also called 'veiled\ncells', as they possess large cytoplasmic 'veils' rather than dendrites.\n","linknr":482,"url":"Dendritic_cell","recorded":1362512981,"links":47,"instances":["protein","biology"],"pdf":["http://www.jimmunol.org/cgi/reprint/165/11/6037.pdf","http://www.jimmunol.org/cgi/reprint/165/11/6037.pdf"],"categories":["Mononuclear phagocytes","Human cells","Immunology","Articles containing video clips"],"headings":["History","Types of dendritic cells","Life cycle","Dendritic cells and cytokines","Disease","Dendritic cells in animals other than humans","Media","See also","External links","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3b/Dendritic_cell.JPG/220px-Dendritic_cell.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2e/Dendritic_cells.jpg/220px-Dendritic_cells.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/S8-Dendritic_Cells_Dragging_Conidia_in_Collagen.ogg/100px--S8-Dendritic_Cells_Dragging_Conidia_in_Collagen.ogg.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ce/S6-Dendritic_Cells_with_Conidia_in_Collagen.ogg/100px--S6-Dendritic_Cells_with_Conidia_in_Collagen.ogg.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/18px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/Wikivoyage-logo.svg/25px-Wikivoyage-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["virus","biology"],["b7","protein"]],"members":["b7","virus"],"related":["Immune_cell","Mammal","Immune_system","Antigen-presenting_cell","Innate_immune_system","Adaptive_immune_system","Skin","Langerhans_cell","Human_nose","Lungs","Stomach","Intestine","Blood","Lymph_node","T_cell","B_cell","Neuron","Paul_Langerhans","Ralph_M._Steinman","Zanvil_A._Cohn","Albert_Lasker_Award_for_Basic_Medical_Research","Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_or_Medicine","Myeloid","Plasmacytoid","Monocyte","Interleukin_12","TLR_2","TLR_4","Plasmacytoid_dendritic_cell","Plasma_cell","Interferon","TLR_7","TLR_9","BDCA-2","BDCA-3","BDCA-4","Hematopoietic","Follicular_dendritic_cells","Mesenchymal","Hematopoietic","MHC_class_II","In_vitro","Monocyte","Pluripotential_hemopoietic_stem_cell","Rhesus_macaque","Mouse","Virus_(biology)","Bacteria","Pattern_recognition_receptors","Toll-like_receptor","Lymph_node","Protein","Major_histocompatibility_complex","Co-stimulation","CD80","CD86","CD40","Blood","Spleen","Lymphatic_system","Lymph_node","Antigen-presenting_cell","Helper_T-cell","Killer_T-cell","B-cell","Antigen-presenting_cells","Memory_T_cells","Naive_T_cells","Monocyte","Macrophage","Bone_marrow","B7_(protein)","CD28","Lymphocyte","Cell–cell_interaction","Cytokine","Interleukin_12","CD4","T_helper_cell","Interferon_type_1","HIV","AIDS","DC-SIGN","Antiretroviral_drug","SARS","Allergy","Autoimmune_disease","Lupus_erythematosus","Crohn's_disease","Ulcerative_colitis","Brown_rat","Conidium","Phagocytosis","Active_Hexose_Correlated_Compound","List_of_human_clusters_of_differentiation","CD80","CD86"]}
