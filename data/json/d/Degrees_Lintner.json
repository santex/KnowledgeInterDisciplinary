{"cursor":"2066","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Â°Lintner' or 'degrees Lintner' is a unit used to measure the ability of a\nmalt to reduce starch to sugar, that is, its diastatic power. While the\nmeasurement is applicable to any amylase, in general it refers to the combined\nÎ±-amylase and Î²-amylase used in brewing. The term is also generalized to\ndiastatic malt extracts and separately prepared brewing enzymes. The\nabbreviation 'Â°L' is official, but in brewing applications it may conflict\nwith Â°L used for degrees Lovibond.\n\nJECFA, the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives, defines the degree\nLintner as follows: :A malt has a diastatic power of 100 Â°L if 0.1[[Cubic\nmetre|cc]] of a clear 5% infusion of the malt, acting on 100cc of a 2%\n[[starch]] solution at 20Â°C for one [[hour]], produces sufficient reducing\nsugars to reduce completely 5cc of [[Fehling's solution]].\n\nNote that the amylases used in brewing reach their peak efficiencies\naround 66 Â°C.\n\nEvaluation of a malt or extract is usually done by the manufacturer rather than\nby the end user; as a rule of thumb, the total grain bill of a mash should have\na diastatic power of at least 40 Â°L in order to guarantee efficient conversion\nof all the starches in the mash to sugars.\n\nThe most active barley malts currently available have a diastatic activity of up\nto 160 Â°Lintner.\n\nIn Europe, diastatic activity is often stated in WindischâKolbach units (Â°WK).\nThese are related approximately to Â°Lintner by:\n: {}^\\circ\\mbox{Lintner} = \\frac{{}^\\circ\\mbox{WK} + 16}{3.5}\n: {}^\\circ\\mbox{WK} = \\left ( 3.5 \\times {}^\\circ\\mbox{Lintner} \\right ) -\n:16 .\n\n100. Â°Lintner equals 3.014 Ã 10 â7 katal or 18.08 enzyme units.\n","linknr":110,"url":"Degrees_Lintner","recorded":1362565419,"links":17,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.fao.org/ag/agn/jecfa-additives/specs/Monograph1/Additive-270.pdf"],"categories":["Brewing","Units of catalytic activity"],"headings":["External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/math/3/4/f/34f13b5479ed3382057daf9aeb4ea117.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/8/d/58dfc35cf6ae78932cc497d504ac21f1.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/AlphaHelixSection.svg/40px-AlphaHelixSection.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c4/Projet_bi%C3%A8re_logo_v2.png/30px-Projet_bi%C3%A8re_logo_v2.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Malt","Starch","Sugar","Mashing","Amylase","Brewing","Malt_extract","Degrees_Lovibond","Joint_FAO/WHO_Expert_Committee_on_Food_Additives","Mash_ingredients","Barley","Windisch–Kolbach_unit","Katal","Enzyme_unit"]}
