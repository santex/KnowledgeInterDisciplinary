It is\ndesigned to hold the unspun fibers, keeping them untangled and thus easing the\nspinning process. It is most commonly used to hold flax, and sometimes wool, but\ncan be used for any type of fiber. Fiber is wrapped around the distaff, and tied\nin place with a piece of ribbon or string. The word comes from dis in Low\nGerman, meaning a bunch of flax, connected with staff. As an adjective the term\ndistaff is used to describe the female side of a family.\n",
