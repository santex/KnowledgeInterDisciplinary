{"cursor":"56482","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'DNA sequencing' is the process of determining the precise order of nucleotides\nwithin a DNA molecule. It includes any method or technology that is used to\ndetermine the order of the four basesâadenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymineâin\na strand of DNA. The advent of rapid DNA sequencing methods has greatly\naccelerated biological and medical research and discovery.\n\nKnowledge of DNA sequences has become indispensable for basic biological\nresearch, and in numerous applied fields such as diagnostic, biotechnology,\nforensic biology, and biological systematics. The rapid speed of sequencing\nattained with modern DNA sequencing technology has been instrumental in the\nsequencing of complete DNA sequences, or genomes of numerous types and species\nof life, including the human genome and other complete DNA sequences of many\nanimal, plant, and microbial species.\n\n\nThe first DNA sequences were obtained in the early 1970s by academic researchers\nusing laborious methods based on two-dimensional chromatography. Following the\ndevelopment of fluorescence-based sequencing methods with automated\nanalysis, DNA sequencing has become easier and orders of magnitude\nfaster.\n","linknr":850,"url":"DNA_sequencing","recorded":1362505184,"links":49,"instances":["molecular_biology","genetics","company","genetics","uk","assay"],"pdf":["http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1980/gilbert-lecture.pdf"],"categories":["Molecular
