Discovered by Arthur Kornberg in 1956, it was the first known DNA polymerase (and, indeed,\nthe first known of any kind of polymerase). It was initially characterized in\n[[E. coli]], although it is ubiquitous in prokaryotes. In E. coli and many other\nbacteria, the gene that encodes Pol I is known as 'polA'. The E. coli form\nof the enzyme is composed of 928 amino acids, and is an example of a processive\nenzyme - it can sequentially catalyze multiple polymerisations.\n\nPol I possesses four enzymatic activities:\n\n# A 5' -> 3' (forward) DNA-Dependent DNA polymerase activity, requiring a 3'\n# primer site and a template strand A 3' -> 5' (reverse) exonuclease activity\n# that mediates proofreading A 5' -> 3' (forward) exonuclease activity mediating\n# nick translation during DNA repair. A 5' -> 3' (forward) RNA-Dependent DNA\n# polymerase activity. Pol I operates on RNA templates with considerably lower\n# efficiency (0.1–0.4%) than it does DNA templates, and this activity is\n# probably of only limited biological significance.\n\nIn the replication process, DNA Polymerase I removes the RNA primer (created by\nPrimase) from the lagging strand and fills in the necessary nucleotides between\nthe Okazaki fragments (see [[DNA replication]]) in 5' -> 3' direction,\nproofreading for mistakes as it goes. It is a template-dependent enzyme - it\nonly adds nucleotides that correctly base pair with an existing DNA strand\nacting as a template. DNA Ligase then joins the various fragments together into\na continuous strand of DNA.\n\nDespite its early characterisation, it quickly became apparent that Polymerase I\nwas not the enzyme responsible for most DNA synthesis — DNA replication in\nE. coli proceeds at approximately 1,000 nucleotides/second, while the rate of\nbase pair synthesis by Polymerase I averages only between 10 and 20\nnucleotides/second. Moreover, its cellular abundance of approximately 400\nmolecules per cell did not correlate with the fact that there are typically only\ntwo replication forks in E. coli. Moreover, it is insufficiently processive to\ncopy an entire genome, as it falls off after incorporating only 25-50\nnucleotides. Its role in replication was proven when, in 1969, John Cairns\nisolated a viable Polymerase I mutant that lacked the polymerase activity. Cairns' lab assistant Paula De Lucia created thousands\nof cell free extracts from E.coli colonies and assayed them for DNA-polymerase\nactivity. The 3,478th clone contained the polA mutant, which was named by Cairns\nto credit \"Paula\" [De Lucia]. It was not until\nthe discovery of DNA polymerase III that the main replicative DNA polymerase was\nfinally identified.\n","linknr":446,"url":"DNA_polymerase_I","recorded":1362484504,"links":19,"instances":["molecular_biology","molecular_biology","biology","biochemist"],"pdf":[],"categories":["EC 2.7.7","DNA replication","Enzymes"],"headings":["Research applications","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/31/PolymeraseDomains.jpg/220px-PolymeraseDomains.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["directionality","molecular_biology"],["primer","molecular_biology"],["proofreading","biology"],["directionality","molecular_biology"],["john_cairns","biochemist"]],"members":["primer","directionality","proofreading","john_cairns"],"related":["Enzyme","DNA_replication","Arthur_Kornberg","DNA_polymerase","Polymerase","Prokaryote","Gene","Processivity","Directionality_(molecular_biology)","Primer_(molecular_biology)","Exonuclease","Proofreading_(biology)","Nick_translation","DNA_repair","Directionality_(molecular_biology)","RNA","Primase","Lagging_strand","Nucleotides","Okazaki_fragments","Base_pair","DNA_Ligase","DNA","Replication_fork","Processivity","Genome","Nucleotides","John_Cairns_(biochemist)","Mutant","Paula_De_Lucia","PolA","DNA_polymerase_III","Molecular_biology","Klenow_fragment","Molecular_biology","Subtilisin","DNA_polymerase_II","DNA_polymerase_III"]}
