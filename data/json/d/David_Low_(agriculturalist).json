In 1825 he settled in Edinburgh, and in the following year at his\nsuggestion the [[Quarterly Journal of Agriculture]] was established, which he\nedited from 1828 to 1832.\n\nOn the death of Professor Andrew Coventry in 1831 Low was appointed professor of\nagriculture in the University of Edinburgh (1831â54). His first step was to urge\non the government the necessity of forming an agricultural museum. The\nChancellor of the Exchequer consented in\n1833 to allow Â£300 a year for that purpose. Low contributed collections of his\nown, and employed William Shiels, R.S.A., to travel, taking portraits of the\nbest specimens of different breeds of animals. Altogether Â£3,000 were expended\non the museum, of which Â£1,500 came from the government, Â£300 from the Reid\nfund, and the rest from the professor's private resources. The museum led to\nincreased attendance in the class of agriculture, which numbered from seventy to\nninety students.\n\nLow was also much devoted to chemistry, and had a private laboratory. In 1842 he\nbrought out a splendid work in two volumes, quarto, on The Breeds of the\nDomestic Animals of the British Islands, with coloured plates. This was\ntranslated for the French government immediately on its appearance.\n\nLow resigned his chair in 1854, and died at Mayfield, Edinburgh, on 7 January\n1859, and was interred at Warriston Cemetery.\n","linknr":122,"url":"David_Low_(agriculturalist)","recorded":1362477725,"links":25,"instances":["artist"],"pdf":["http://www.rse.org.uk/fellowship/fells_indexp2.pdf","http://www.rse.org.uk/fellowship/fells_indexp2.pdf"],"categories":["Agriculturalists","Scottish farmers","People from Berwickshire","Academics of the University of Edinburgh","Scottish non-fiction writers","1786 births","1859 deaths","Scottish agronomists","Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh","Burials at Warriston Cemetery","Scottish editors","Alumni of the University of Edinburgh","Scottish surveyors","Scottish chemists","People educated at Perth Academy"],"headings":["Works","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/12px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["william_shiels","artist"]],"members":["william_shiels"],"related":["Fellow_of_the_Royal_Society_of_Edinburgh","Scotland","Land-agent","Laws,_Berwickshire","Berwickshire","Perth_Academy","University_of_Edinburgh","The_Royal_Society_of_Edinburgh","Napoleonic_Wars","Edinburgh","Andrew_Coventry","Chancellor_of_the_Exchequer","Spring_Rice","William_Shiels_(artist)","R.S.A.","Chemistry","France","Mayfield,_Edinburgh","Warriston_Cemetery","French_language","German_language"]}
