Similar regulations cover driving or\n operating certain types of machinery while affected by drinking alcohol or\n taking other drugs, including, but not limited to prescription drugs. This is a\n criminal offense in most countries. Convictions do not necessarily involve\n actual driving of the vehicle.\n\nIn most jurisdictions a measurement such as a blood alcohol content (BAC) in\nexcess of a specific threshold level, such as 0.05% or 0.08% defines the\noffense, with no need to prove impairment or being under the influence of\nalcohol. In some jurisdictions, there is an aggravated category of the offense\nat a higher level e.g. 0.12%. In most countries, anyone who is convicted of\ninjuring or killing someone while under the influence of alcohol or drugs can be\nheavily fined, as in France, in addition to being given a lengthy prison\nsentence. Some jobs have their own rules and BAC limits, for example commercial\npilot, and the Federal Railroad Administration has a 0.04% limit for train\ncrew. Some jurisdictions have multiple levels of BAC; for example,\nthe state of California has a 0.08% BAC limit, which is lowered to 0.04% if the\noperator holds a commercial driver's license. The California BAC limit is 0.01%\nfor those younger than 21 years of age and those on probation for a previous DUI\nconviction. Some large corporations have their own rules; Union\nPacific Railroad has their own BAC limit of 0.02% that, if violated\nduring a random test or a for-cause test â for example, after a\ntraffic accident â can result in termination of employment with no\nchance of future re-hire.\n\nMany states in the U.S. and provinces in Canada have adopted truth in sentencing\nlaws that enforce strict guidelines on sentencing, differing from previous\npractice where prison time was reduced or suspended after sentencing had been\nissued. Some jurisdictions have judicial guidelines requiring a mandatory\nminimum sentence.\n\n, Canada]] The specific criminal offense may be called, depending on the\njurisdiction, driving under the influence [of alcohol or other drugs] (DUI),\ndriving under intense influence (DUII), driving while intoxicated (DWI),\noperating under the influence (OUI) operating while intoxicated (OWI), operating\na motor vehicle while intoxicated (OMVI), driving under the combined influence\nof alcohol and/or other drugs, driving under the influence per se or drunk in\ncharge [of a vehicle]. Many such laws apply also to motorcycling, boating,\npiloting aircraft, use of motile farm equipment such as tractors and combines,\nriding horses or driving a horse-drawn vehicle, or bicycling, possibly with\ndifferent BAC level than driving. In some jurisdictions there are separate\ncharges depending on the vehicle used, such as BWI (bicycling while\nintoxicated), which may carry a lighter sentence.\n\nIn the United States, local law enforcement agencies made 1,467,300 arrests\nnationwide for driving under the influence of alcohol in 1996, compared to 1.9\nmillion such arrests during the peak year in\n1983.

In 1997 an estimated 513,200 DWI offenders were in prison or\njail, down from 593,000 in 1990 and up from 270,100 in\n1986.
