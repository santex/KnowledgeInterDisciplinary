which organic substances are\nbroken down into simpler forms of matter. The process is essential for recycling\nthe finite matter that occupies physical space in the biome. Bodies of living\norganisms begin to decompose shortly after death. Although no two organisms\ndecompose in the same way, they all undergo the same sequential stages of\ndecomposition. The science which studies decomposition is generally referred to\nas [[taphonomy]] from the Greek word τάφος taphos, meaning tomb.\n\nOne can differentiate 'abiotic' from 'biotic decomposition' (biodegradation).\nThe former means \"degradation of a substance by chemical or physical processes,\ne.g. hydrolysis.<ref>Water Quality Vocabulary.
