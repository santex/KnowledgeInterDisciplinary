{"cursor":"7899","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nIn computer science, 'direct manipulation' is a humanâcomputer interaction style\nwhich involves continuous representation of objects of interest and rapid,\nreversible, and incremental actions and feedback. The intention is to allow a\nuser to directly manipulate objects presented to them, using actions that\ncorrespond at least loosely to the physical world. An example of direct-\nmanipulation is resizing a graphical shape, such as a rectangle, by dragging its\ncorners or edges with a mouse.\n\nHaving real-world metaphors for objects and actions can make it easier for a\nuser to learn and use an interface (some might say that the interface is more\nnatural or intuitive), and rapid, incremental feedback allows a user to make\nfewer errors and complete tasks in less time, because they can see the results\nof an action before completing the action, thus evaluating the output and\ncompensating for mistakes.\n\nThe term was introduced by Ben Shneiderman in 1983 within the context of office\napplications and the desktop metaphor. {{Cite journal |last= Shneiderman\n|first= Ben |authorlink= Ben Shneiderman |title= Direct Manipulation.

As a result the term has been more widespread in these environments.\n","linknr":108,"url":"Direct_manipulation_interface","recorded":1362574581,"links":14,"instances":["ratio","computing","geometry","mathematics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["User interface techniques"],"headings":["In contrast to WIMP/GUI interfaces","In computer graphics","References","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["wimp","computing"],["transformation","mathematics"],["translation","geometry"],["scale","ratio"]],"members":["scale","wimp","translation","transformation"],"related":["Computer_science","Human–computer_interaction","Ben_Shneiderman","Desktop_metaphor","GUI","WIMP_(computing)","Microsoft_Windows","GUI_widget","Transformation_(mathematics)","Translation_(geometry)","Rotation","Scale_(ratio)","Inverse_kinematics","Scientific_visualization","Object_Action_Interface"]}
