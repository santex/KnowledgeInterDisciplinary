{"cursor":"4459","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nIn chemistry and the biological sciences, a 'dehydration reaction' is usually\ndefined as a chemical reaction that involves the loss of a water molecule from\nthe reacting molecule. Dehydration reactions are a subset of elimination\nreactions. Because the hydroxyl group (âOH) is a poor leaving group, having a\nBrÃ¸nsted acid catalyst often helps by protonating the hydroxyl group to give the\nbetter leaving group, âOH 2+ . The reverse of a dehydration\nreaction is a hydration reaction. Common dehydrating agents used in organic\nsynthesis includes concentrated sulfuric acid, concentrated phosphoric acid, hot\naluminium oxide and hot ceramic.\n\nDehydration reactions and dehydration synthesis have the same meaning, and are\noften used interchangeably. Two monosaccharides, such as glucose and fructose,\ncan be joined together (to form sucrose) using dehydration synthesis. The new\nmolecule, consisting of two monosaccharides, is called a disaccharide.\n\nThe process of hydrolysis is the reverse reaction, meaning that the water is\nrecombined with the two hydroxyl groups and the disaccharide reverts to being\nmonosaccharides.\n\nIn the related condensation reaction water is released from two different\nreactants.\n","linknr":143,"url":"Dehydration_reaction","recorded":1362371730,"links":27,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.orgsynth.org/orgsyn/pdfs/CV1P0015.pdf"],"categories":["Elimination reactions"],"headings":["Dehydration reactions","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/72/EliminationReactionGlycerol2Acrolein2.svg/325px-EliminationReactionGlycerol2Acrolein2.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f0/Dehydration_1-methyl-2-cyclohexanol.svg/285px-Dehydration_1-methyl-2-cyclohexanol.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9f/Dienol_benzene_rearrangement.png/400px-Dienol_benzene_rearrangement.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Chemistry","Chemical_reaction","Water","Elimination_reaction","Hydroxyl","Leaving_group","Brønsted_acid","Hydration_reaction","Sulfuric_acid","Phosphoric_acid","Aluminium_oxide","Monosaccharide","Glucose","Fructose","Disaccharide","Hydrolysis","Condensation_reaction","Organic_synthesis","Alcohol","Ether","Alkene","Glycerol","Acrolein","Organic_syntheses","Carboxylic_acid","Acid_anhydride","Amide","Nitrile","Sugar","Sulfuric_acid","Hydration_reaction"]}
