Palgrave, Basingstoke</ref><ref>Beynon-\nDavies P. (2010) Significance: exploring the nature of information, systems and\ntechnology. Palgrave, Basingstoke</ref> Any organised collection of symbols and\nsymbol-manipulating operations can be considered a data system. Hence, human-\nspeech analysed at the level of phonemes can be considered a data system as can\nthe Incan artefact of the khipu and an image stored as pixels. A data system is\ndefined in terms of some data model and bears a resemblance to the idea of a\nphysical symbol system.\n\nSymbols within some data systems may be persistent or not. Hence, the sounds\nof human speech are non-persistent symbols because they decay rapidly in\nair. In contrast, pixels stored on some peripheral storage device are\npersistent symbols.\n",
