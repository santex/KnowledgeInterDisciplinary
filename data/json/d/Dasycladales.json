They live on\nsubstrates in shallow warm marine waters, usually less than 20 meters deep. They\nare very large cells. They are able to attain these sizes without numerous\ninternal cell wells because they build calcium carbonate shells around\nthemselves.\n\nThey contain only one nucleus in their vegetative stage, which remains in the\nbottom of the cell in the holdfast at the substrate. Only when they are ready to\nproduce gametes does the nucleus undergo meiosis and then numerous mitoses into\nmany nuclei which then migrate into the gametangia at the top of the algae.\n\nBecause the nucleus is safely hidden in the holdfast, the cells easily\nregenerate if the top portions are broken off.\n\nThese algae are notable for having an intracellular network of 10 nm\nproteinaceous filaments, possibly for the storage and transport of\nribonucleoprotein particles.\n\nBecause of all these properties, and the fact that they are easy to manipulate\nthey have been favorite organisms in the study of the role of the nucleus vs the\nunnucleated cytoplasm in the behavior of cells. receptaculitid, considered a\nmember of the Order Dasycladales; Ordovician of Estonia.]]\n","linknr":135,"url":"Dasycladales","recorded":1362372852,"links":18,"instances":["biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Ulvophyceae"],"headings":["References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/93/Receptaculitid.JPG/220px-Receptaculitid.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/Ulva_lactuca_-_Sowerby.jpg/28px-Ulva_lactuca_-_Sowerby.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["order","biology"]],"members":["order"],"related":["Ordovician","Eukaryota","Plantae","Chlorophyta","Ulvophyceae","Dasycladaceae","Polyphysaceae","Taxonomy","Order_(biology)","Ulvophyceae","AlgaeBase","National_University_of_Ireland,_Galway","Dasycladaceae","Polyphysaceae","Cell_nucleus","Holdfast","Gametes","Meiosis","Mitosis","Gametangia","Nanometer","Cytoplasm","Ordovician","Estonia"]}
