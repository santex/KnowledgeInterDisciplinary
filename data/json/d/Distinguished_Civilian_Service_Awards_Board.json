It was originally established by President Dwight D.\nEisenhower on June 27, 1957 by to recommend to the President people in the U.S.\nCivil Service to receive the President's Award for Distinguished Federal\nCivilian Service. Its mandate was expanded via by President John F. Kennedy on\nFebruary 22, 1963, so that the board would recommend to the President people to\nbe awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\n\nJimmy Carter abolished the Distinguished Civilian Service Awards Board in\nExecutive Order 12014 and turned over the responsibility for recommending\nrecipients to the Chairman of the United States Civil Service Commission. {{cite web\n | last = Carter first
