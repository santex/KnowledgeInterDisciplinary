Switches\nof the former type are commonly used in locomotives, aircraft refuelling,\nfreight elevators, lawn mowers, tractors, personal watercraft, outboard\nmotors, chainsaws, snowblowers, tread machines, snowmobiles, and many medical\nimaging devices.\n\nA dead man's switch may also be used to activate a harmful device, such as a\nbomb or IED. The user holds down a switch of some sort in their hand which arms\nthe device. When the switch is released, the device will activate, so that if\nthe user is killed while holding the switch, the switch will be released and the\nbomb will detonate (i.e. fail-deadly). The Special Weapons Emergency Separation\nSystem is an application of this concept in the field of nuclear weapons (see\nDead Hand (nuclear war)).\n\nA similar concept has been employed with computer data, where the \"switch\" is a\ndecryption key that can release sensitive information, as with the WikiLeaks\n\"Insurance File\".\n","linknr":237,"url":"Dead_man's_switch","recorded":1362554005,"links":27,"instances":["networking_utility","new_york_city_subway_car","nuclear_war","spacecraft","train"],"pdf":["http://latts.cnrs.fr/site/tele/rep1/ISSA%202006%20-%20dead%20man.pdf"],"categories":["Occupational safety and health","Rail transport","Safety switches"],"headings":["Background","Types","Vigilance control","Alternative names","Event recording","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/Dodemansknop_Linde.jpg/200px-Dodemansknop_Linde.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e3/P_train.svg/31px-P_train.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["dead_hand","nuclear_war"],["r142a","new_york_city_subway_car"],["ping","networking_utility"],["safe_mode","spacecraft"],["emergency_brake","train"]],"members":["ping","r142a","dead_hand","safe_mode","emergency_brake"],"related":["Human","Death","Loss_of_consciousness","Fail-safe","Series_circuit","Suicide_bomber","Locomotive","Elevator","Lawn_mower","Tractor","Personal_watercraft","Outboard_motor","Chainsaw","Snowblower","Treadmill","Snowmobile","Medical_imaging","Bomb","Improvised_Explosive_Device","Fail-deadly","Special_Weapons_Emergency_Separation_System","Dead_Hand_(nuclear_war)","WikiLeaks","Tram","Rapid_transit","Steam_railroad","Electric","Diesel_locomotive","Locomotive","Urban_area","Suburban","New_York_City_Subway","Malbone_Street_Wreck","Brooklyn_Rapid_Transit","Michael_Miscione","Pneumatic","Solenoid","Pilot_valve","New_York_City_Subway","R142A_(New_York_City_Subway_car)","Nottingham_Express_Transit","Tram","Track_brake","Waterfall_train_disaster","Canadian_National_Railway","Budd_Rail_Diesel_Car","Power_take-off","Outboard_motor","Snowmobile","Jet_ski","Waverunner","Treadmill","Strategic_Air_Command","Special_Weapons_Emergency_Separation_System","Fail-deadly","Cruise_control","Dead-man's_vigilance_device","Software","Encryption","Log_in","E-mail","Ping_(networking_utility)","GPS","Telephone","Booting","Safe_mode_(spacecraft)","Watchdog_timer","Voyager_2","UK","Event_recorder","Emergency_brake_(train)","Parking_brake","Kill_switch","Train_protection_system","Watchdog_timer"]}
