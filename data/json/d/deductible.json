      "text" : "\n\n\nIn an insurance policy, the 'deductible' is the amount of expenses that must be\npaid out of pocket before an insurer will pay any expenses.<ref></ref> In\ngeneral usage, the term 'deductible' may be used to describe one of several\ntypes of clauses (see below) that are used by insurance companies as a threshold\nfor policy payments.\n\nDeductibles are typically used to deter the large number of trivial claims that\na consumer can be reasonably expected to bear the cost of. By restricting its\ncoverage to events that are significant enough to incur large costs, the\ninsurance firm expects to pay out slightly smaller amounts much less frequently,\nincurring much higher savings. As a result, insurance premiums are typically\ncheaper when they involve higher deductibles. Deductible is what make insurance\nso profitable. For example, phone companies offer replacement plans, with\ndeductible set at the level of wholesale price of the phone. As added benefit to\nthem, the customer does not switch to different company as they often do with\nnew phone purchase.\n\nDeductibles are normally provided as clauses in an insurance policy that dictate\nhow much of an insurance-covered expense is borne by the policyholder. They are\nnormally quoted as a fixed quantity and is a part of most policies covering\nlosses to the policy holder. The insurer then becomes liable for claimable\nexpenses that exceed this amount (subject to the maximum sum claimable indicated\nin the contract). Depending on the policy, the deductible may apply per covered\nincident, or per year. For policies where incidences are not easy to delimit\n(for example health insurance), the deductible is typically applied per year.\n\nSeveral deductibles can be set by the insurer based on the cause of the claim.\nFor example, a single housing insurance policy may contain multiple deductible\namounts for loss or damage arising from theft, fire, natural calamities,\nevacuation etc.\n\nThere are also deductible reimbursement programs that reimburse a deductible in\nthe event of an auto, home, boat/yacht or health insurance claim.\n",
