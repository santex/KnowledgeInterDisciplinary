This is usually done with two\ndata/information sources with different languages as in XML data binding. In UI\ndata binding data and information objects of the same language but different\nlogic function are bound together (e.g. Java UI elements to Java objects).\n\nIf the binding has been made in the proper manner, each data change is reflected\nautomatically by the elements that are bound to the data. The term data binding\nis also used in cases where an outer representation of data in an element\nchanges, and the underlying data is automatically updated to reflect this\nchange. As an example, a change in a TextBox element could modify\nthe underlying data value.
