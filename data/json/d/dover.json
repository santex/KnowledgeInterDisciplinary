) is a\ntown and major ferry port in the home county of Kent, in South East England. It\nfaces France across the narrowest part of the English Channel, and lies south-\neast of Canterbury; east of Kent's administrative capital Maidstone; and north-\neast along the coastline from Dungeness and Hastings. The town is the\nadministrative centre of the Dover District and home of the Dover Calais ferry\nthrough the Port of Dover. The surrounding chalk cliffs have become known as the\nWhite Cliffs of Dover, and the narrow sea passage nearby – the Strait of\nDover.<ref>The French name for the Strait is Le Pas-de-Calais</ref> Its\nstrategic position has been evident throughout its history: archaeological finds\nhave revealed that the area has always been a focus for peoples entering and\nleaving Britain. The name of the town derives from the name of the river that\nflows through it, the River Dour. The town has been inhabited since the Stone\nAge according to archaeological finds, and Dover is one of only a few places in\nBritain &ndash; London and Cornwall being other examples &ndash; to have a\ncorresponding name in the French language, Douvres.<ref>\n|publisher=Fr.wikipedia.org |date=3 April 2010 |accessdate=2010-04-18}}</ref>\n\nThere was a military barracks in Dover, which was closed in 2007. Although many\nof the former ferry services have declined, services related to the Port of\nDover provide a great deal of the town’s employment, as does tourism. The\nprospect of privatizing the sale of the Port of Dover to create increased cash\nflow for the government was given a recent ironic twist due to the rejection of\na possible bid from the town of Calais in France after opposition in Dover\nagainst any sale forced the government to withdraw the Port from the market:\n:Local residents had clubbed together to propose buying it for the community.\nMore than 12,000 people have bought a £10 share in the People's Port Trust but\noptimism that this would transform Dover has been short lived.\n","title":"dover","headings":["History","Geography","Demography","Economy","RNLI","Education","Public services","Local media","Culture","International relations","Sports","Places of interest","Notable people","Gallery","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["6: Calais","4: Strait_of_Dover","3: Kent","3: Canterbury","3: Port_of_Dover","2: Maidstone","2: Hastings","2: River_Dour,_Kent","2: Stone_Age","2: London","2: Ancient_Rome","2: Dubris","2: Dover_Western_Heights","2: Dover_Castle","2: P&O_Ferries","2: DFDS_Seaways","2: Ramsgate","2: Folkestone","2: Dunkirk","2: Dover_Museum","2: Roman_Painted_House","1: Home_county","1: South_East_England","1: English_Channel","1: Dover_Calais_ferry","1: Chalk","1: White_Cliffs_of_Dover","1: Great_Britain","1: Cornwall","1: Tourism","1: Nickname","1: Archaeological","1: Bronze_Age","1: Iron_Age","1: Lympne","1: Richborough","1: Watling_Street","1: World_War_II","1: Cinque_Ports","1: South_Foreland","1: Europe","1: Cap_Gris_Nez","1: Longshore_drift","1: Oceanic_climate","1: Edward_Hasted","1: Office_for_National_Statistics","1: River,_Kent","1: Kearsney,_Kent","1: Temple_Ewell","1: Whitfield,_Kent","1: The_English_Channel","1: Dover_Marine_railway_station","1: Boulogne","1: Zeebrugge","1: SNCF","1: Train_ferry","1: Channel_Tunnel","1: Regie_voor_Maritiem_Transport","1: Ostend","1: TransEuropa_Ferries","1: Stena_Line","1: Hoverspeed","1: SpeedFerries","1: LD_Lines","1: Dieppe,_Seine-Maritime","1: Severn_class_lifeboat","1: Toll_road","1: Stagecoaches","1: A258_road","1: London,_Chatham_and_Dover_Railway","1: Dover_Corporation_Tramways","1: Long_distance_footpaths_in_the_United_Kingdom","1: Saxon_Shore_Way","1: North_Downs_Way","1: National_Cycle_Network","1: Norfolkline","1: Belgium","1: Netherlands","1: Stagecoach_in_East_Kent","1: Deal","1: Dymchurch","1: Sandwich","1: Hythe,_Kent","1: Romney_Marsh","1: Lydd_Airport","1: Lydd","1: Rye","1: National_Express","1: Ashford,_Kent","1: Gillingham,_Kent","1: Greenhithe","1: Bluewater_Shopping_Centre","1: Dartford","1: Bexleyheath","1: Eltham","1: Walworth","1: Canary_Wharf","1: Elephant_&_Castle","1: The_City_of_London","1: Victoria_Coach_Station","1: Dover_Pencester_Road","1: Costa_Coffee","1: Dover_Grammar_School_for_Girls","1: Dover_Grammar_School_for_Boys","1: Dover_Christ_Church_Academy","1: Duke_of_York's_Royal_Military_School","1: Dover_College","1: Workhouse","1: KM_Group","1: KOS_Media","1: KMFM_Shepway_and_White_Cliffs_Country","1: Heart_Kent","1: BBC_Radio_Kent","1: Dover_Transport_Museum","1: Town_twinning","1: Ohio","1: Croatia","1: Dover_Athletic_F.C.","1: Solea_solea","1: Blériot_memorial","1: The_White_Cliffs_of_Dover","1: Samphire_Hoe","1: South_Foreland_Lighthouse","1: St_Edmund's_Chapel"]}
