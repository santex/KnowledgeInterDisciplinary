Sequence-specific DNA-binding\n proteins generally interact with the major groove of B-DNA, because it exposes\n more functional groups that identify a base pair. However there are some known\n minor groove DNA-binding ligands such as Netropsin, Distamycin,\n Hoechst 33258, Pentamidine, DAPI and others.\n","linknr":369,"url":"DNA-binding_protein","recorded":1362538368,"links":19,"instances":["biophysics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["DNA-binding proteins","Molecular genetics","DNA replication","Transcription factors","Biophysics"],"headings":["Examples","Non-specific DNA-protein interactions","DNA-binding proteins that specifically bind single-stranded DNA","Binding to particular DNA sequences","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e4/Cro_protein_complex_with_DNA.png/220px-Cro_protein_complex_with_DNA.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/be/Nucleosome1.png/220px-Nucleosome1.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8f/Lambda_repressor_1LMB.png/185px-Lambda_repressor_1LMB.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dc/EcoRV_1RVA.png/220px-EcoRV_1RVA.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["lattice_model","biophysics"]],"members":["lattice_model"],"related":["EcoRV","Protein","DNA-binding_domain","DNA","Major_groove","B-DNA","Functional_group","Base_pair","Minor_groove","Netropsin","Hoechst_33258","Pentamidine","DAPI","Protein","Transcription_factors","Gene_modulation","Polymerases","Nucleases","Histones","Cell_nucleus","Zinc_finger","Helix-turn-helix","Leucine_zipper","Chromatin","Histone","Nucleosome","Ionic_bond","Methylation","Phosphorylation","Acetylation","Transcription_factor","Replication_protein_A","Stem-loop","Nuclease","Transcription_factor","Enzyme","Signal_transduction","Cellular_differentiation","Lattice_model_(biophysics)","DNA-binding_domain","Single-strand_binding_protein","Zinc_finger","Leucine_Zipper","BZIP_domain","Helix-turn-helix","Helix-loop-helix","HMG-box","Lexitropsin","List_of_nucleic_acid_simulation_software"]}
