In some cases the direct construction of\nan object (as in pottery, engineering, management, cowboy coding and graphic\ndesign) is also considered to be design.\n\nMore formally design has been defined as follows.\n:(noun) a specification of an [[Object (philosophy)|object]], manifested by\n:an [[Agency (philosophy)|agent]], intended to accomplish [[goal]]s, in a\n:particular [[Environment (systems)|environment]], using a set of primitive\n:components, satisfying a set of [[requirement]]s, subject to constraints;\n:(verb, transitive) to create a design, in an [[Environment\n:(systems)|environment]] (where the designer operates)<ref>Ralph, P. and\n:Wand, Y. (2009). A proposal for a formal definition of the design concept.\n:In Lyytinen, K., Loucopoulos, P., Mylopoulos, J., and Robinson, W., editors,\n:Design Requirements Workshop (LNBIP 14), pp. 103–136. Springer-Verlag, p.\n:109 .</ref>\n\nAnother definition for design is a roadmap or a strategic approach for someone\nto achieve a unique expectation. It defines the specifications, plans,\nparameters, costs, activities, processes and how and what to do within legal,\npolitical, social, environmental, safety and economic constraints in achieving\nthat objective.<ref>Don Kumaragamage, Y. (2011). Design Manual Vol 1</ref>\n\nHere, a \"specification\" can be manifested as either a plan or a finished\nproduct, and \"primitives\" are the elements from which the design object\nis composed.\n\nWith such a broad denotation, there is no universal language or unifying\ninstitution for designers of all disciplines. This allows for many differing\nphilosophies and approaches toward the subject (see Philosophies and studies of\ndesign, below).\n\nThe person designing is called a [[designer]], which is also a term used for\npeople who work professionally in one of the various design areas, usually also\nspecifying which area is being dealt with (such as a fashion designer, concept\ndesigner or web designer). A designer's sequence of activities is called a\ndesign process. The scientific study of design is called design\nscience.<ref>Simon (1996)</ref><ref>Alexander, C. (1964) Notes on the Synthesis\nof Form, Harvard University Press.</ref><ref></ref>\n\nDesigning often necessitates considering the aesthetic, functional, economic and\nsociopolitical dimensions of both the design object and design process. It may\ninvolve considerable research, thought, modeling, interactive adjustment, and\nre-design.<ref name=\"Transferable Knowledge,\"></ref> Meanwhile, diverse kinds of\nobjects may be designed, including clothing, graphical user interfaces,\nskyscrapers, corporate identities, business processes and even methods of\ndesigning.<ref></ref>\n","title":"Design","headings":["Design as a process","Design disciplines","Philosophies and studies of design","Terminology","See also","Footnotes","Bibliography"]},"micro-relation":["5: Applied_arts","3: Engineering","3: Graphic_design","3: Industrial_design","2: Business_process","2: Management","2: Research","2: Problem_solving","2: Skyscraper","2: Engineering_design","2: Creativity","2: Fashion_design","2: Product_design","2: Service_design","2: Fine_art","1: Louis_Comfort_Tiffany","1: Blueprint","1: Engineering_drawing","1: Circuit_diagram","1: Pottery","1: Cowboy_coding","1: Organizational_communication","1: Institutional_memory","1: Design_science","1: Aesthetic","1: Thought","1: Physical_model","1: Clothing","1: Graphical_user_interface","1: Corporate_identity","1: Herb_Simon","1: Constraints","1: Goal","1: Rationalism","1: Waterfall_Model","1: Systems_Development_Life_Cycle","1: Design_brief","1: Parti_pris","1: Analysis","1: Specification","1: Product_design_specification","1: Conceptual","1: Document","1: Presentation","1: Product_development","1: In_situ","1: Implementation","1: Evaluation","1: Logical_consequence","1: Constructive_criticism","1: Best_practices","1: Emotion","1: Improvisation","1: Empiricism","1: Agile_software_development","1: Sensemaking","1: Architecture","1: Communication_design","1: Game_design","1: Information_Architecture","1: Instructional_design","1: Interaction_design","1: Interior_design","1: Landscape_architecture","1: Lighting_design","1: Process_design","1: Software_design","1: Web_design","1: Urban_design","1: Visual_design","1: Holistic","1: Utopian","1: Material_culture","1: Sustainable_design","1: First_Things_First_2000_manifesto","1: Herbert_A._Simon","1: KISS_principle","1: There_is_more_than_one_way_to_do_it","1: Use-centered_design","1: User-centered_design","1: Critical_design","1: Transgenerational_design","1: Exploring","1: Definition","1: Prototyping","1: Madrid","1: Spain","1: Raymond_Loewy","1: Bauhaus","1: Ulm_School_of_Design","1: Decorative_arts","1: Graphic_art","1: Commercial_art","1: American_Heritage_Dictionary","1: Science","1: Social_science","1: Natural_science","1: Xerox_PARC","1: Apple_Inc.","1: Personal_computer","1: Production,_costs,_and_pricing","1: Multidisciplinary","1: Division_of_labour","1: Creative_professional","1: Architect","1: Construction","1: Multifunction_printer","1: Desktop_publishing","1: Production_artist","1: Construction_worker","1: Chemical_process","1: Information_age","1: Business_process_design","1: Manufacturing","1: Design_elements_and_principles"]}
