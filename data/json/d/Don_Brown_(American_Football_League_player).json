He played one season in the American Football League in 1960. [http://www.databasefootball.com/players/playerpage.htm?ilkid=BROWNDON01 Don\nBrown], Database Football, retrieved July 17, 2010. He was born in Dayton,\nTexas and attended Dayton High School where he played high school football from\n1953 to 1955. He then attended University of Houston where he played for the\nfootball team as a running back and defensive back from 1956 to 1958, earning an\nAll-America honorable mention during his senior year. He played for the College\nAll-Stars in 1959 against the defending NFL champions, the Baltimore Colts. In\nthe game, he was involved in a serious collision with Bill Pellington which left\nhim unconscious for several minutes.\n\nHe was drafted by the Los Angeles Rams, but immediately traded for Ollie Matson\nof the Chicago Cardinals. This trade was significant, as he was one of 9 players\ntraded for Matson. After the Cardinals, he had a brief stint with the Green Bay\nPackers with Coach Vince Lombardi before returning home to try out for the newly\nformed Houston Oilers, where he ended his professional career in 1961.\n","linknr":164,"url":"Don_Brown_(American_Football_League_player)","recorded":1375056711,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Don_Brown_(American_football_player)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Don_Brown_(American_football_player)&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","/wiki/Don_Brown_(American_football_player)","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","/w/index.php?title=Don_Brown_(American_Football_League_player)&redirect=no","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Don_Brown_(American_football_coach)","/wiki/Defensive_coordinator","/wiki/Donald_Brown_(American_football)","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Biographies_of_living_persons","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability","/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources","/wiki/Defamation","/wiki/American_football","/wiki/American_Football_League","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Dayton,_Texas","/wiki/Dayton_High_School_(Texas)","/wiki/High_school_football","/wiki/University_of_Houston","/wiki/Houston_Cougars_football","/wiki/Running_back","/wiki/Defensive_back","/wiki/College_Football_All-American","/wiki/College_All-Star_Game","/wiki/National_Football_League","/wiki/History_of_the_Indianapolis_Colts","/wiki/Bill_Pellington","/wiki/Los_Angeles_Rams","/wiki/Ollie_Matson","/wiki/Chicago_Cardinals","/wiki/Green_Bay_Packers","/wiki/Houston_Oilers","/w/index.php?title=Don_Brown_(American_football_player)&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","http://www.databasefootball.com/players/playerpage.htm?ilkid=BROWNDON01","http://www.oldestlivingprofootball.com/donalbertbrown.htm","/wiki/Template:1960_Houston_Oilers","/wiki/Template_talk:1960_Houston_Oilers","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:1960_Houston_Oilers&action=edit","/wiki/Tennessee_Titans","/wiki/American_Football_League","/wiki/Dalva_Allen","/wiki/Jack_Atchason","/wiki/Tony_Banfield","/wiki/George_Belotti","/wiki/George_Blanda","/wiki/Billy_Cannon","/wiki/Johnny_Carson_(American_football)","/wiki/Doug_Cline","/w/index.php?title=Pete_Davidson&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Mike_Dukes","/wiki/Don_Floyd","/w/index.php?title=Bobby_Gordon_(American_football)&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Gabby_Greaves&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Bill_Groman","/wiki/Kenneth_Hall_(American_football)","/wiki/Jerry_Helluin","/wiki/Charlie_Hennigan","/wiki/Al_Jamison","/wiki/Mark_Johnston_(American_football)","/w/index.php?title=Charlie_Kendall&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Dan_Lanphear","/wiki/Jacky_Lee","/wiki/Wahoo_McDaniel","/wiki/Rich_Michael","/wiki/Charlie_Milstead","/wiki/Dennit_Morris","/wiki/Jim_Norton_(safety)","/w/index.php?title=Phil_Perlo&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Hugh_Pitts&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=George_Shirkey&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=John_Simerson&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Dave_Smith_(fullback)","/w/index.php?title=Julian_Spence&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Bob_Talamini","/wiki/Charlie_Tolar","/wiki/Orville_Trask","/wiki/Fred_Wallner","/w/index.php?title=Hogan_Wharton&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Bob_White_(American_football)","/w/index.php?title=John_White_(American_football)&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Al_Witcher&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Lou_Rymkus","/wiki/Wally_Lemm","/wiki/Walt_Schlinkman","/wiki/Mac_Speedie","/wiki/Fred_Wallner","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Don_Brown_(American_football_player)&oldid=566017249","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1937_births","/wiki/Category:Living_people","/wiki/Category:People_from_Dayton,_Texas","/wiki/Category:American_football_running_backs","/wiki/Category:American_football_defensive_ends","/wiki/Category:Houston_Cougars_football_players","/wiki/Category:Chicago_Cardinals_players","/wiki/Category:Green_Bay_Packers_players","/wiki/Category:Houston_Oilers_players","/wiki/Category:BLP_articles_lacking_sources_from_September_2008","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Don+Brown+%28American+football+player%29&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Don+Brown+%28American+football+player%29","/wiki/Don_Brown_(American_football_player)","/wiki/Talk:Don_Brown_(American_footba
