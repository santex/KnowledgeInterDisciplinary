It may also be used before certain\nmedical procedures (such as endoscopies) to reduce tension and anxiety, and in\nsome surgical procedures to induce amnesia.\n\nIt possesses anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, hypnotic, sedative, skeletal\nmuscle relaxant, and amnestic properties. The pharmacological\naction of diazepam enhances the effect of the neurotransmitter GABA by\nbinding to the benzodiazepine site on the GABA A receptor (via\nthe constituent chlorine atom) leading to central nervous system\ndepression.\n\nAdverse effects of diazepam include anterograde amnesia (especially at higher\ndoses) and sedation, as well as paradoxical effects such as excitement, rage or\nworsening of seizures in epileptics. Benzodiazepines also can cause or worsen\ndepression. Long-term effects of benzodiazepines such as diazepam include\ntolerance, benzodiazepine dependence and benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome upon\ndose reduction. After cessation of benzodiazepines, cognitive deficits may\npersist for at least six months and it was suggested that longer than six months\nmay be needed for recovery from some deficits. Diazepam\nalso has physical dependence potential and can cause serious problems of\nphysical dependence with long term use. Compared to other benzodiazepines,\nthough, physical withdrawal from diazepam following long term use is usually far\nmore mild due to its long elimination half-life. Nevertheless, urgent action by\nnational governments to improve prescribing practices has been recommended . Diazepam is the drug of choice for treating benzodiazepine\ndependence, with its low potency, long duration of action and the availability\nof low-dose tablets making it ideal for gradual dose reduction and the\ncircumvention of withdrawal symptoms.\n\nAdvantages of diazepam are a rapid onset of action and high efficacy rates,\nwhich is important for managing acute seizures, anxiety attacks and panic\nattacks; benzodiazepines also have a relatively low toxicity in overdose. Diazepam is a core medicine in the World Health\nOrganization's \"Essential Drugs List\", which is a list of minimum medical needs\nfor a basic health care system. Diazepam was\nfirst synthesized by Leo Sternbach, is used to treat a wide range of\nconditions, and has been one of the most frequently prescribed medications in\nthe world since its launch in 1963.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Diazepam","recorded":1362479188,"links":0,"instances":["herb","biology","mood","medical","nerve_agent"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Benzodiazepines","Hoffmann-La Roche","World
