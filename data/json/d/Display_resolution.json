This\nexample would normally be spoken as \"ten twenty-four by seven sixty-eight\" or\n\"ten twenty-four by seven six eight\".\n\nOne use of the term âdisplay resolutionâ applies to fixed-pixel-array displays\nsuch as plasma display panels (PDPs), liquid crystal displays (LCDs), digital\nlight processing (DLP) projectors, or similar technologies, and is simply the\nphysical number of columns and rows of pixels creating the display (e.g., 1920\nÃ 1080). A consequence of having a fixed-grid display is that, for multi-\nformat video inputs, all displays need a \"scaling engine\" (a digital video\nprocessor that includes a memory array) to match the incoming picture format\nto the display.\n\nNote that for broadcast television standards the use of the word resolution here\nis a misnomer, though common. The term âdisplay resolutionâ is usually used to\nmean pixel dimensions, the number of pixels in each dimension (e.g., 1920 Ã\n1080), which does not tell anything about the pixel density of the display on\nwhich the image is actually formed: broadcast television resolution properly\nrefers to the pixel density, the number of pixels per unit distance or area, not\ntotal number of pixels. In digital measurement, the display resolution would be\ngiven in pixels per inch. In analog measurement, if the screen is 10 inches\nhigh, then the horizontal resolution is measured across a square 10 inches\nwide. This is typically stated as \"lines horizontal resolution, per picture\nheight;\" for example, analog NTSC TVs can\ntypically display about 340 lines of \"per picture height\" horizontal resolution\nfrom over-the-air sources, which is equivalent to about 440 total lines of\nactual picture information from left edge to right edge.\n","linknr":347,"url":"Display_resolution","recorded":1362684440,"links":51,"instances":["image","retina","signal_processing","software","video"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Digital imaging","Display technology","History of television","Television technology","Television terminology","Video signal"],"headings":["Considerations","Interlacing versus progressive scan","Overscan and underscan","Current standards","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/Mergefrom.svg/50px-Mergefrom.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f0/Vector_Video_Standards4.svg/500px-Vector_Video_Standards4.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7f/Progressive_scan_hdtv.svg/220px-Progressive_scan_hdtv.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/Fatty_watching_himself_on_TV.jpg/220px-Fatty_watching_himself_on_TV.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7b/MacBookEeePCNintendoDS.JPG/220px-MacBookEeePCNintendoDS.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/48/C64_startup_animiert.gif/250px-C64_startup_animiert.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/59/CGA_CompVsRGB_Text.png/250px-CGA_CompVsRGB_Text.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c5/HAM6example.png/250px-HAM6example.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Torak.gif/250px-Torak.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["aspect_ratio","image"],["graphics_display_resolution#wxga","1280×768"],["graphics_display_resolution#xga","1024×768"],["bandwidth","signal_processing"],["luma","video"],["macbook_pro#third_generation","retina"],["steam","software"],["geos","8-bit_operating_system"]],"members":["aspect_ratio","bandwidth","geos","steam","luma"],"related":["Digital_television","Computer_monitor","Display_device","Pixel","Cathode_ray_tube","Flat_panel_display","Liquid_crystal_display","Plasma_display","Liquid_crystal_display","Digital_light_processing","Pixel_density","Pixel_density","NTSC","1920_×_1080","Overscan","Image_resolution","Optical_resolution","Aspect_ratio_(image)","Native_resolution","Video_processing","Image_scaling","Astigmatism","Shadow_mask","Trinitron","Analog_television","Interlaced_video","PAL","NTSC","Scan_line","Cathode_ray_tube","Progressive_video","Television","Kell_factor","LCD_television","Video_scaling","Interlaced_video","Progressive_video","TV_tuner_card","Sampling_theorem","Bandwidth_(signal_processing)","Luma_(video)","Standard-definition_television","480i","NTSC","Interlaced_video","576i","PAL","Enhanced-definition_television","480p","Progressive_scan","576p","High-definition_television","720p","1080i","1080p","Ultra-high-definition_television","Ultra-high-definition_television","Ultra-high-definition_television","Ultra-high-definition_television","XGA","Computer-aided_design","UXGA","SXGA+","Wide_XGA","WXGA+","WSXGA+","WUXGA","WQXGA","Steam_(software)","Virtual_desktop","720p","1080p","Film_stock","Motion_picture_film_scanner","Digital_intermediate","Film_format","HDTV","Cinemascope","PAL","NTSC","Enhanced_Graphics_Adapter","S-Video","Color_Graphics_Adapter","Atari_2600","Apple_II_Plus","GEOS_(8-bit_operating_system)","Amiga","Amiga","Final_Fantasy_XII","Video_Toaster","IBM_PS/2","IBM_Multicolor_Graphics_Array","Windows_XP","Linux","FreeBSD","Unix","X_Window_System","Display_device","Video_card","List_of_common_resolutions","Display_size","Computer_display_standard","Resolution_independence","Display_aspect_ratio","Widescreen","List_of_displays_by_pixel_density","Video_scaler"]}
