It is an ocular manifestation of diabetes, a systemic\ndisease, which affects up to 80 percent of all patients who have had diabetes\nfor 10 years or more. Despite these intimidating\nstatistics, research indicates that at least 90% of these new cases could be\nreduced if there was proper and vigilant treatment and monitoring of the\neyes. The longer a person has diabetes, the higher his or her chances\nof developing diabetic retinopathy.\n","linknr":848,"url":"Diabetic_retinopathy","recorded":1362482102,"links":41,"instances":["tests","eye","epidemiology","tests","medicine"],"pdf":["http://content.karger.com/ProdukteDB/Katalogteile/isbn3_8055/_92/_75/FDIAB20_02.pdf"],"categories":["Diabetes","Blindness","Disorders of choroid and retina"],"headings":["Signs and symptoms","Pathogenesis","Risk factors","Diagnosis","Management","Experimental treatments","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3f/Fundus_photo_showing_scatter_laser_surgery_for_diabetic_retinopathy_EDA09.JPG/230px-Fundus_photo_showing_scatter_laser_surgery_for_diabetic_retinopathy_EDA09.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cc/Eye_disease_simulation%2C_normal_vision.jpg/220px-Eye_disease_simulation%2C_normal_vision.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/Eye_disease_simulation%2C_diabetic_retinopathy.jpg/220px-Eye_disease_simulation%2C_diabetic_retinopathy.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["fundus","eye"],["sensitivity","tests"],["specificity","tests"],["incidence","epidemiology"],["sign","medicine"]],"members":["sensitivity","fundus","incidence","specificity","sign"],"related":["Fundus_(eye)","Laser_scalpel","Retinopathy","Retina","Diabetes","Blindness","Ocular_manifestation_of_systemic_disease","Macular_edema","Ocular_hemorrhage","Blood","Sleep","Fundoscope","Cotton_wool_spots","Crystalline_lens","Hyperphacosorbitomyopicosis","Sorbitol","Sugar_alcohol","Myopia","Hyperglycemia","Pericyte","Basement_membrane","Blood-retinal_barrier","Mitogen-activated_protein_kinase","SHP-1","PDGF_receptor","Blood_vessel","Blood_sugar","Glucose","Fructose","Macular_edema","Lipid","Macula","PDR","Oxygen","Vitreous_humour","Retinal_detachment","Neovascular_glaucoma","Cotton_wool_spots","Asymptomatic","Cohort_study","Cross-sectional","Sensitivity_(tests)","Specificity_(tests)","Positive_predictive_value","Negative_predictive_value","Prevalence","Incidence_(epidemiology)","Pregnancy","Eye_examination","Down's_syndrome","Endostatin","Eye_examination","Eye_chart","Visual_acuity","Pupil","Sign_(medicine)","Fundus_photography","Diabetes_mellitus","Nerve","Neuropathy","Macular_edema","Fluorescein_angiography","Vitrectomy","Macular_edema","Euglycemia","Kinase_inhibitor","Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor","Laser_photocoagulation","Ischemia","Ophthalmologist","Anesthetic","Glaucoma","Cataract","VEGF","Bevacizumab","Vitrectomy","Vitreous_humour","Local_anesthesia","Sclera","Hospital","Red","Infection","C-peptide","Oligomeric_proanthocyanidin","Diabetic_diet","Purtscher's_retinopathy","Retinal_regeneration","Public_domain_resource"]}
