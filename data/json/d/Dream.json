The content\nand purpose of dreams are not definitively understood, though they have been a\ntopic of scientific speculation, as well as a subject of philosophical and\nreligious interest, throughout recorded history. The scientific study of dreams\nis called oneirology. Scientists believe that, in addition to humans, birds and\nother mammals also dream.\n\nDreams mainly occur in the rapid-eye movement (REM) stage of sleepâwhen brain\nactivity is high and resembles that of being awake. REM sleep is revealed by\ncontinuous movements of the eyes during sleep. At times, dreams may occur during\nother stages of sleep. However, these dreams tend to be much less vivid or\nmemorable.\n\nDreams can last for a few seconds, or as long as twenty minutes. People are more\nlikely to remember the dream if they are awakened during the REM phase. The\naverage person has three to five dreams per night, but some may have up to seven\ndreams in one night. The dreams tend to last longer as the night progresses.\nDuring a full eight-hour night sleep, two hours of it is spent\ndreaming.\n\nIn modern times, dreams have been seen as a connection to the unconscious. They\nrange from normal and ordinary to overly surreal and bizarre. Dreams can have\nvarying natures, such as frightening, exciting, magical, melancholic,\nadventurous, or sexual. The events in dreams are generally outside the control\nof the dreamer, with the exception of lucid dreaming, where the dreamer is self-\naware. Dreams can at times make a creative thought occur to the person or give a\nsense of inspiration.\n\nOpinions about the meaning of dreams have varied and shifted through time and\nculture. Dream interpretations date back to 5000-4000 BC. The earliest recorded\ndreams were acquired from materials dating back approximately 5,000 years, in\nMesopotamia, where they were documented on clay tablets. p. 57, Hall\nIn the Greek and Roman periods, the people believed that dreams were direct\nmessages from the gods or from the dead, and that they predicted the future.\nSome cultures practiced dream incubation with the intention of cultivating\ndreams that are prophetic.\n\nSigmund Freud, who developed the discipline of psychoanalysis, wrote extensively\nabout dream theories and interpretations. He explained dreams as manifestations\nof our deepest desires and anxieties, often relating to repressed childhood\nmemories or obsessions. In [[The Interpretation of Dreams]], Freud developed a\npsychological technique to interpret dreams and devised a series of guidelines\nto understand the symbols and motifs that appear in our dreams.\n","linknr":1209,"url":"Dream","recorded":1362373648,"links":113,"instances":["plot_device","emotion","emotion","fictional_country","mythology","physiology","medicine","psychology","psychology","spirituality","psychology","in_dreams","neuroscience","chinese_medicine","psychology","folklore","psychology"],"pdf":["http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/~wegner/pdfs/Dream%20Rebound.pdf","http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/~wegner/pdfs/Dream%20Rebound.pdf","http://academicdepartments.musc.edu/neuromodulation/epapers/Aston-JonesetalLCsleepOrdway07.pdf","http://www.psychology.uiowa.edu/Faculty/Blumberg/Course_Docs/Seminar.2008/Readings/Siegel.REMSleep.pdf","http://www.epjournal.net/filestore/ep035978.pdf","http://www.epjournal.net/filestore/ep035978.pdf","http://www.journalsleep.org/PDF/AbstractBook2007.pdf","http://www.measuredhs.com/pubs/pdf/FR157/04Chapter04.pdf"],"categories":["Dream|","Psychotherapy","Symbols"],"headings":["Cultural
