It has been revised and expanded through 23 major editions, the\nlatest issued in 2011. [http://www.oclc.org/dewey/versions/default.htm DDC\n23 Print Edition] Dewey was responsible for all revisions until his death\nin 1931. A designation number, such as Dewey 16 for the 16th edition, is given\nfor each revision.\n\nA library assigns a DDC number that unambiguously locates a particular volume to\nwithin a short length of shelving which makes it easy to find any particular\nbook and return it to its proper place on the library shelves. Consider as\nan example a book on the network protocol IPv6. It will be located at 004.62,\nafter general networking books at 004.6. The shelf location is thus\ndefined. The system is used in 200,000 libraries in at least 135\ncountries. {{cite web\n| url =http://www.oclc.org/dewey/default.htm title =Dewey Services year =2009\n| publisher=Online Computer Library Center accessdate =November 4, 2009 quote\n| =Offers library users familiarity and consistency of a time-honored\n| classification system used in 200,000 libraries worldwid\n}} {{cite web\n| url =http://www.oclc.org/dewey/about/translations/countries.htm title\n| =Countries with libraries that use the DDC year =2009 publisher=Online\n| Computer Library Center accessdate =November 4, 2009 quote =Libraries in more\n| than 135 countries use the Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) system to\n| organize their collections for their users.
