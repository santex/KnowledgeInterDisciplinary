{"cursor":"2462","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Derrick Harold Robins', often known as 'D. H. Robins' (27 June 1914 â 3 May\n2004) was an English cricketer and sports promoter, at one time chairman of\nCoventry City Football Club. He was born in Bexleyheath, Kent.\n\nRobins played two matches for Warwickshire in 1947, but did little and never\nplayed county cricket again. Extraordinarily, his third first-class\nappearance would come 22 years later, when he appeared for his own \"D. H.\nRobins' XI\" against the touring West Indians at The Saffrons, Eastbourne.\nRobins made two further appearances for his own XI, against Oxford University\nin 1969 and against the Indians in 1971, the latter game coming a few days\nafter his 57th birthday.\n\nHowever, he was better known as the promoter who took several strong sides to\napartheid South Africa in the 1970s. Between 1972/73 and 1975/76 a D. H. Robins'\nXI played in the country each winter. In those days there were no sanctions\nagainst cricketers who visited South Africa, and Robins' teams included players\nof high quality, including such names as Bob Willis, Brian Close, Tony Greig and\nTrevor Chappell. Detailed accounts of these matches can be found in the\nInternational cricket in South Africa from 1971 to 1981 article.\n\nHe also took first-class teams to Sri Lanka in 1977â78 and New Zealand\nin 1979â80.\n\nHe died in South Africa at the age of 89.\n","linknr":96,"url":"Derrick_Robins","recorded":1364119188,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Derrick_Robins&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Derrick_Robins&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/England","/wiki/Cricketer","/wiki/Coventry_City_F.C.","/wiki/Bexleyheath","/wiki/Warwickshire_County_Cricket_Club","/wiki/County_cricket","/wiki/First-class_cricket","/wiki/West_Indian_cricket_team","/wiki/Eastbourne","/wiki/Oxford_University_Cricket_Club","/wiki/Indian_cricket_team","/wiki/Apartheid","/wiki/South_Africa","/wiki/Bob_Willis","/wiki/Brian_Close","/wiki/Tony_Greig","/wiki/Trevor_Chappell","/wiki/International_cricket_in_South_Africa_from_1971_to_1981","/wiki/D._H._Robins%27_XI_cricket_team_in_Sri_Lanka_in_1977%E2%80%9378","/wiki/D._H._Robins%27_XI_cricket_team_in_New_Zealand_in_1979%E2%80%9380","/w/index.php?title=Derrick_Robins&action=edit&section=1","http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/ci/content/player/19756.html","http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/156032.html","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Derrick_Robins&oldid=542989675","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1914_births","/wiki/Category:English_cricketers","/wiki/Category:Warwickshire_cricketers","/wiki/Category:English_football_chairmen_and_investors","/wiki/Category:Coventry_City_F.C._directors_and_chairmen","/wiki/Category:2004_deaths","/wiki/Category:English_wicket-keepers","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Derrick+Robins&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Derrick+Robins","/wiki/Derrick_Robins","/wiki/Talk:Derrick_Robins","#","/wiki/Derrick_Robins","/w/index.php?title=Derrick_Robins&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Derrick_Robins&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Derrick_Robins","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Derrick_Robins","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Derrick_Robins&oldid=542989675","/w/index.php?title=Derrick_Robins&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Derrick_Robins&id=542989675","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Derrick+Robins","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Derrick+Robins&oldid=542989675&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Derrick_Robins&printable=yes","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_Robins","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=skins.vector&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","/w/index.php?title=MediaWiki:Gadget-ReferenceTooltips.js&action=raw&ctype=text/javascript&508635914","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["1914
