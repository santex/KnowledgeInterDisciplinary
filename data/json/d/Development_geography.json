In this context,\ndevelopment is a process of change that affects people's lives. It may involve\nan improvement in the quality of life as perceived by the people undergoing\nchange. [http://www.hi.com.au/geogglobal1/pdf/global1_2_3.pdf Geography of\nglobal interactions] However, development is not always a positive\nprocess. Gunder Frank commented on the global economic forces that lead to the\ndevelopment of\nunderdevelopment. [http://www.rrojasdatabank.org/agfrank/underdev.html\nFrank, Gunder The Underdevelopment of Development] This is covered in his\ndependency theory.\n\nIn development geography, geographers study spatial patterns in development.\nThey try to find by what characteristics they can measure development by looking\nat economic, political and social factors. They seek to understand both the\ngeographical causes and consequences of varying development. Studies compare\nMore Economically Developed Countries (MEDCs) with Less Economically Developed\nCountries (LEDCs). Additionally variations within countries are looked at such\nas the differences between northern and southern Italy, the Mezzogiorno.\n\nWithin development geography, sustainable development is also studied in an\nattempt to understand how to meet the needs of the present without compromising\nthe needs of future generations to meet their own\nneeds.
