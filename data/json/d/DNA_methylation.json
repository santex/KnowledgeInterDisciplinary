{"cursor":"29510","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" molecule that is methylated at the two center cytosines. DNA methylation plays\n an important role for epigenetic gene regulation in development and disease.]]\n\n'DNA methylation' is a biochemical process involving the addition of a methyl\ngroup to the cytosine or adenine DNA nucleotides. DNA methylation stably alters\nthe expression of genes in cells as cells divide and differentiate from\nembryonic stem cells into specific tissues. The resulting change is normally\npermanent and unidirectional, preventing one organism from reverting back to a\nstem cell or converting into another type of tissue. DNA methylation is\ntypically removed during zygote formation and re-established through successive\ncell divisions during development. However, the latest research shows that\nhydroxylation of methyl groups occurs rather than complete removal of methyl\ngroups in zygote. Some\nmethylation modifications that regulate gene expression are inheritable and\ncause genomic imprinting.\n\nIn addition, DNA methylation suppresses the expression of endogenous retroviral\ngenes and other harmful stretches of DNA that have been incorporated into the\ngenome of the host over time. DNA methylation also forms the basis of chromatin\nstructure, which enables a single cell to grow into multiple organs or perform\nmultiple functions. DNA methylation also plays a crucial role in the development\nof nearly all types of cancer.\n\nDNA methylation at the 5 position of cytosine has the specific effect of\nreducing gene expression and has been found in every vertebrate examined. In\nadult non-gamete cells (cells in the body, not used for reproduction), DNA\nmethylation typically occurs in a CpG dinucleotide context; non-CpG methylation\nis prevalent in embryonic stem cells.\n","linknr":571,"url":"DNA_methylation","recorded":1362483230,"links":34,"instances":["biology","biology","genetics","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["DNA","Epigenetics"],"headings":["In mammals","DNA methyltransferases","In plants","In fungi","In bacteria","Detection","Computational prediction","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/80/DNA_methylation.jpg/300px-DNA_methylation.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cell","biology"],["tissue","biology"],["transcription","genetics"],["promoter","biology"]],"members":["promoter","tissue","transcription","cell"],"related":["Epigenetics","Biochemistry","Methyl_group","Cytosine","Adenine","Nucleotide","Gene_expression","Cell_(biology)","Cell_division","Cellular_differentiation","Embryonic_stem_cell","Tissue_(biology)","Zygote","Hydroxylation","Heritability","Genomic_imprinting","Endogenous_retrovirus","Genome","Chromatin","Cancer","Vertebrate","Gamete","CpG_site","Stem_cell","Genomic_imprinting","X-chromosome_inactivation","Carcinogenesis","Regulatory_regions","Genes","Cancer","CpG_island","Transcriptional_silencing","Epigenetic_therapy","Transcription_factor","Methyl-CpG-binding_domain","Methyl-CpG-binding_domain_protein_2","Histone_deacetylase","Chromatin_remodeling","Histone","Heterochromatin","Methyl_CpG_binding_protein_2","Rett_syndrome","Methyl-CpG-binding_domain_protein_2","Transcription_(genetics)","5-methylcytosine","Promoter_(biology)","DNA_methyltransferase","TRDMT1","Carcinogenesis","Decitabine","Base_analog","Genome","MRNA","Translation","CpG_site","RNA-directed_DNA_methylation","SiRNA","MiRNA","RNA_viruses","Transposons","Fungi","Gene_expression","Transposon","Adenine","Cytosine","Restriction_modification_system","Bacterium","Methylase","Restriction_enzyme","Bacteriophage","Dna_adenine_methylase","Origin_of_replication","Pilus","Operon","PCR","HELP_assay","ChIP-on-chip","Restriction_landmark_genomic_scanning","Methylated_DNA_immunoprecipitation","Chromatin_immunoprecipitation","Immunoprecipitation","DNA_microarrays","DNA_sequencing","Pyrosequencing","Demethylating_agent","MethDB","Reprogramming","Epigenetics","Genomic_imprinting","5-Methylcytosine","N6-Methyladenosine","7-Methylguanosine","5-Hydroxymethylcytosine"]}
