Retrieved on 2007-08-19.\n\nSalt water is desalinated to produce fresh water suitable for human consumption\nor irrigation. One potential byproduct of desalination is salt. Desalination is\nused on many seagoing ships and submarines. Most of the modern interest in\ndesalination is focused on developing cost-effective ways of providing fresh\nwater for human use. Along with recycled wastewater, this is one of the few rainfall-\nindependent water sources.\n\nLarge-scale desalination typically uses large amounts of energy and\nspecialized, expensive infrastructure, making it more expensive than fresh\nwater from conventional sources, such as rivers or groundwater. {{Cite journal |last=Fischetti |first=Mark\n|date=September 2007 |title=Fresh from the Sea |journal=Scientific\nAmerican|volume=297 |pmid=17784633 |issue=3 |pages=118â119|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0907-\n118 }}\n\nDesalination is particularly relevant to countries such as Australia, which\ntraditionally have relied on collecting rainfall behind dams to provide their\ndrinking water supplies.\n\nAccording to the International Desalination Association, in 2009, 14,451\ndesalination plants operated worldwide, producing 59.9 million cubic meters per\nday, a year-on-year increase of 12.3%. The production was 68 million\nm 3 in 2010, and expected to reach 120 million m 3 by 2020;\nsome 40 million m 3 is planned for the Middle East.
