The reaction can proceed even if some of the atoms in the newly\n  formed ring are not carbon. Some of the DielsâAlder reactions are reversible;\n  the decomposition reaction of the cyclic system is then called the 'retro-\n  DielsâAlder'. For example, retro-DielsâAlder compounds are commonly observed\n  when a DielsâAlder product is analyzed via mass spectrometry.\n\nOtto Paul Hermann Diels and Kurt Alder first documented the novel reaction in\n1928 for which they were awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1950 for their\nwork on the eponymous reaction.\n\nThe DielsâAlder reaction is generally considered one of the more useful\nreactions in organic chemistry since it requires very little energy to create a\ncyclohexene ring, which is useful in many other organic\nreactions.
