Often, the phrase \"to\ndiscipline\" carries a negative connotation. This is because enforcement of\norder–that is, ensuring instructions are carried out–is often regulated through\npunishment.\n\nDiscipline is the assertion of willpower over more base desires, and is usually\nunderstood to be synonymous with self control. Self-discipline is to some extent\na substitute for motivation, when one uses reason to determine the best course\nof action that opposes one's desires. Virtuous behavior is when one's\nmotivations are aligned with one's reasoned aims: to do what one knows is best\nand to do it gladly. Continent behavior, on the other hand, is when one does\nwhat one knows is best, but must do it by opposing one's motivations.<ref\nname=\"continence to virtue\"></ref> Moving from continent to virtuous behavior\nrequires training and some self-discipline.\n",
