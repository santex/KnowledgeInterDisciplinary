Alternatively, the data\nare deemed of high quality if they correctly represent the real-world construct\nto which they refer. Furthermore, apart from these definitions, as data volume\nincreases, the question of [[data consistency|internal consistency]] within data\nbecomes paramount, regardless of fitness for use for any external purpose, e.g.\na person's age and birth date may conflict within different parts of a database.\nThe first views can often be in disagreement, even about the same set of data\nused for the same purpose. This article discusses the concept as it related to\nbusiness data processing, although of course other data have various quality\nissues as well.\n","linknr":186,"url":"Data_quality","recorded":1362480366,"links":21,"instances":["natural_sciences"],"pdf":["http://www.go-ship.org/Manual/Swift_DataEval.pdf","http://ribbs.usps.gov/move_update/documents/tech_guides/PUB363.pdf","http://mitiq.mit.edu/Documents/Publications/TDQMpub/2002/IQ%20Benchmarks.pdf","http://vishnu.sims.monash.edu.au/dss2004/proceedings/pdf/65_Price_Shanks.pdf","http://web.mit.edu/tdqm/www/tdqmpub/WandWangCACMNov96.pdf","http://web.mit.edu/tdqm/www/tdqmpub/IEEEDEApr93.pdf","http://dit.unitn.it/~themis/publications/iciq08.pdf"],"categories":["Information science","Data quality|"],"headings":["Definitions","History","Overview","Criticism of existing tools and processes","Professional associations","See also","References","Further reading"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["protocol","natural_sciences"]],"members":["protocol"],"related":["Data","Business_operations","Decision_making","Planning","Joseph_M._Juran","Mainframe_computer","United_States_Postal_Service","GS1","Protocol_(natural_sciences)","Measurement_error","Bounds_checking","Cross_tabulation","Outlier","Data_integrity","Customer_service","Semiotics","Ontological","Information_systems","Accuracy","Correctness","Completeness","Relevance","List_of_system_quality_attributes","MIT","Data_warehousing","Business_intelligence","Customer_relationship_management","Supply_chain_management","Data_governance","Data_governance","Shadow_system","Data_quality_assurance","Data_profiling","Business_rules_engine","Guru","ISO_8000","Accuracy_and_precision","Data_cleansing","Data_governance","Data_integrity","Data_management","Data_profiling","Data_validation","Dirty_data","Identity_resolution","Information_quality","Master_data_management","Noisy_text_analytics","Data_quality_assessment","Kristo_Ivanov"]}
