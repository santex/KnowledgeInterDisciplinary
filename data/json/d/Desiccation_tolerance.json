{"cursor":"14951","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Desiccation tolerance' refers to the ability of an organism to withstand or\nendure extreme dryness, or drought-like conditions. Plants and animals living in\narid or periodically arid environments such as temporary streams or ponds may\nface the challenge of desiccation, therefore physiological or behavioral\nadaptations to withstand these periods are necessary to ensure survival. In\nparticular, insects occupy a wide range of ecologically diverse niches and, so,\nexhibit a variety of strategies to avoid desiccation.\n\nIn general, desiccation resistance in insects is measured by the change in mass\nduring dry conditions. The overall mass difference\nbetween measurements before and after aridity exposure is attributed to body\nwater loss, as respiratory water loss is generally considered negligible.\n","linknr":219,"url":"Desiccation_tolerance","recorded":1362538094,"links":10,"instances":["physiology","anatomy"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Droughts","Physiology"],"headings":["Types of desiccation resistance","Behavior modification","Cryptobiosis (Anhydrobiosis)","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["crop","anatomy"],["respiration","physiology"]],"members":["respiration","crop"],"related":["Drought","Adaptation","Insects","Species","Glycogen","Glucose","Polysaccharide","Eclosion","Hemolymph","Hemocoel","Carbohydrate","Trehalose","Crop_(anatomy)","Integument","Invertebrate_trachea","Excretion","Snail","Epiphragm","Exoskeleton","Epicuticle","Procuticle","Lipoprotein","Fatty_acid","Polyphenol","Dermis","Lipid","Neuroendocrine","Transpiration","Hormone","Spiracle","Respiration_(physiology)","Tsetse_flies","Dung_beetle","Cryptobiosis","Chironomid","Anhydrobiosis"]}
