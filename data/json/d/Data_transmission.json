{"cursor":"14689","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Data transmission', 'digital transmission', or 'digital communications' is the\nphysical transfer of data (a digital bit stream) over a point-to-point or point-to-\nmultipoint communication channel. Examples of such channels are copper wires,\noptical fibres, wireless communication channels, and storage media. The data are\nrepresented as an electromagnetic signal, such as an electrical voltage,\nradiowave, microwave, or infrared signal.\n\nWhile analog transmission is the transfer of a continuously varying analog\nsignal, digital communications is the transfer of discrete messages. The\nmessages are either represented by a sequence of pulses by means of a line code\n([[baseband]] transmission), or by a limited set of continuously varying wave\nforms ([[passband]] transmission), using a digital modulation method. The\npassband modulation and corresponding demodulation (also known as detection) is\ncarried out by modem equipment. According to the most common definition of\ndigital signal, both baseband and passband signals representing bit-streams are\nconsidered as digital transmission, while an alternative definition only\nconsiders the baseband signal as digital, and passband transmission of digital\ndata as a form of digital-to-analog conversion.\n\nData transmitted may be digital messages originating from a data source, for\nexample a computer or a keyboard. It may also be an analog signal such as a\nphone call or a video signal, digitized into a bit-stream for example using pulse-\ncode modulation (PCM) or more advanced source coding (analog-to-digital\nconversion and data compression) schemes. This source coding and decoding is\ncarried out by codec equipment.\n","linknr":336,"url":"Data_transmission","recorded":1362673105,"links":34,"instances":["computing","computing","telecommunications","disambiguation","telecommunication","signal_processing","electronics","data","communication"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Data transmission|","Local area networks","Media technology","Telecommunications"],"headings":["Distinction between related subjects","Protocol layers and sub-topics","Applications and history","Baseband or passband transmission","Serial and parallel transmission","Types of communication channels","Asynchronous and synchronous data transmission","See also","Notes","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["signal","electronics"],["flow_control","data"],["sampling","signal_processing"],["transmission","telecommunications"],["character","computing"],["signalling","telecommunication"],["duplex","telecommunications#half-duplex"],["duplex","telecommunications#full-duplex"],["point-to-point","telecommunications"],["protocol","computing"],["media","communication"],["transmission","disambiguation"]],"members":["protocol","character","transmission","signalling","sampling","duplex","signal","flow_control","media"],"related":["Data","Digital","Bit_stream","Point-to-multipoint_communication","Copper_wire","Optical_fibre","Wireless","Storage_media","Electromagnetic_field","Signal_(electronics)","Electrical_voltage","Radiowave","Microwave","Infrared","Analog_transmission","Analog_signal","Line_code","Modulation","Modem","Digital_signal","Digital-to-analog_conversion","Digitize","Pulse-code_modulation","Source_coding","Analog-to-digital_conversion","Data_compression","Codec","Telecommunication","Electrical_engineering","Computer_science","Computer_engineering","Data_communication","Computer_networking","Computer_communication","Inter-process_communication","Transmission_control_protocol","Tele_transmission","Analog_transmission","Analog_modulation_method","Amplitude_modulation","Frequency_modulation","Digital_modulation","Frequency-shift_keying","Phase-shift_keying","Amplitude-shift_keying","Information_theory","Coding_theory","OSI_model","Physical_layer","Channel_coding","Digital_modulation","Line_coding","Forward_error_correction","Bit_synchronization","Multiplexing","Equalization","Channel_model","Data_link_layer","Channel_access","Media_access_control","Frame_synchronization","Error_detection","Automatic_repeat_request","Flow_control_(data)","Presentation_layer","Source_coding","Cryptography","Information","Optical","Acoustics","Classical_mechanics","Communication","Analog_signal","History_of_the_telephone","Telegraphy","Teletypewriter","Digital_signal","Harry_Nyquist","Ralph_Hartley","Claude_Shannon","Computers","Computer_bus","Peripheral_equipment","Parallel_port","Serial_port","RS-232","Firewire","USB","Computer_networking","Modems","Local_area_network","Repeater","Network_hub","Microwave_link","Wireless_access_point","Pulse_code_modulation","Time_division_multiplexing","Telephone_exchange","AXE_telephone_exchange","Integrated_Services_Digital_Network","ADSL","Cable_modem","Fiber-to-the-building","Fiber-to-the-home","IP_telephony","IPTV","Digital_signal_processing","Sampling_(signal_processing)","Multiplexing","Wideband","Communication_channel","Solid-state_electronics","Telecommunication","2G","Cellular_telephony","Video_conferencing","Digital_TV","Digital_radio","Telemetry","Line_coding","Manchester_coding","Serial_cable","Local_area_network","Ethernet","Pulse_amplitude_modulated","Pulse_train","Modulation","Analog_transmission","Phase-shift_keying","QAM","Frequency-shift_keying","Modem","Serial_transmission","Transmission_(telecommunications)","Signal_element","Character_(computing)","Data","Signal_processing","Parity_bit","Parallel_transmission","Signalling_(telecommunication)","Digital","Data_transmission_circuit","Simplex_communication","Point-to-point_(telecommunications)","Multidrop_bus","Bus_network","Ring_network","Star_network","Mesh_network","Wireless_network","ASCII","Parity_bit","Clock","Data","Bit","Protocol_(computing)","Byte","Bit","Check_digit","Byte","Computer_networking","Information_theory","Media_(communication)","Signal_processing","Telecommunication","Transmission_(disambiguation)"]}
