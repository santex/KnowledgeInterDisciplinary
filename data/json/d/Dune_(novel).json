It won the Hugo\nAward in 1966, and the inaugural Nebula Award for\nBest Novel. Dune is frequently cited as the\nworld's best-selling science fiction novel and is the start of the ''Dune'' saga.\n\nSet in the far future amidst a feudal interstellar society in which noble\nhouses, in control of individual planets, owe allegiance to the imperial House\nCorrino, Dune tells the story of young Paul Atreides, the heir apparent to Duke\nLeto Atreides as his family accepts control of the desert planet Arrakis, the\nonly source of the \"spice\" melange. Melange is the most important and valuable\nsubstance in the universe, increasing Arrakis's value as a fief. The story\nexplores the multi-layered interactions of politics, religion, ecology,\ntechnology, and human emotion, as the forces of the empire confront each other\nin a struggle for the control of Arrakis and its \"spice\".\n\nHerbert wrote five sequels to the novel Dune: [[Dune Messiah]], [[Children of\nDune]], [[God Emperor of Dune]], [[Heretics of Dune]], and [[Chapterhouse:\nDune]]. The first novel also inspired a 1984 film adaptation by David Lynch, the\n2000 Sci-Fi Channel miniseries [[Frank Herbert's Dune]] and its 2003 sequel\n[[Frank Herbert's Children of Dune]] (which combines the events of Dune Messiah\nand Children of Dune), computer games, at least two board games, songs, and a\nseries of prequels, interquels, and sequels that were co-written by Kevin J.\nAnderson and the author's son, Brian Herbert, starting in 1999.\n","linknr":990,"url":"Dune_(novel)","recorded":1362484781,"links":62,"instances":["dune","band","fictional_drug","dune","band","dune","dune","musician","album","filmmaker","conspiracy","franchise"],"pdf":[],"categories":["1965
