They can\ngrow up to long. While most are marine, a few species inhabit the lower\nstretches of rivers in fresh water. Damselfish usually have bright colors.\n\n]]\n\n in tropical coral reefs, and many of those are kept as marine aquarium pets,\n although some species such as white-spotted damselfish are too demanding for an\n average marine aquarium. Their diets include small crustaceans, plankton, and\n algae. However, many also live in temperate climates, such as the species which\n inhabits the coast of southern California and the Pacific Mexican coast, the\n garibaldi.\n\nAquarists often use damselfish to biologically stabilize a new aquarium. The\nfish is introduced when the aquarium is first populated, and helps provide\nbeneficial bacteria. This practice is viewed negatively by some aquarists\nbecause of what they see as foul conditions and because other, slower,\nstabilization methods exist.\n\nIn the wild, the damselfish ([[Stegastes nigricans]]) cultivates red filamentous\nalgae (Polysiphonia).<ref name=\"BC\">Damselfish Are Also Known To Be Aggressive\nEspecially The Twospot Domino Damsel [http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-\n2148/10/185/abstract BC-85].</ref> At this time, garibaldi and damselfish are\nthe only fish known to engage in farming or cultivating.\n\nThere is geographic variation in the damselfish/red-alga cultivation mutualism\nin the Indo-West Pacific.
