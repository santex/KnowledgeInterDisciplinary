{"cursor":"46130","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Dual inheritance theory' ('DIT'), also known as 'geneâculture coevolution' or\n'biocultural evolution', was developed in the late 1970s and early\n1980s to explain how human behavior is a product of two different and\ninteracting evolutionary processes: genetic evolution and cultural evolution. In\nDIT, culture is defined as information and behavior acquired through social\nlearning. One of the theory's central claims is that culture evolves partly\nthrough a Darwinian selection process, which dual inheritance theorists often\ndescribe by analogy to genetic evolution.\n\nBecause genetic evolution is relatively well understood, most of DIT examines\ncultural evolution and the interactions between cultural evolution and genetic\nevolution.\n","linknr":466,"url":"Dual_inheritance_theory","recorded":1362483236,"links":49,"instances":["anthropologist","journal","observational_learning"],"pdf":["http://arbeit.ucdavis.edu/mcelreath/files/Henrich%20and%20McElreath%20final.pdf","http://xcelab.net/rm/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/cultureisbiology.pdf","http://artsci.wustl.edu/~pboyer/CEwebsite/Archive/ShennanRandomDrift.pdf","http://www.duke.edu/~mwh3/BabyNames.pdf","http://arbeit.ucdavis.edu/mcelreath/files/henrich%20mcelreath%20EA%202003.pdf","http://www.des.ucdavis.edu/faculty/richerson/SoltisBoydRichersonCA95.pdf","http://www.des.ucdavis.edu/faculty/Richerson/WheatPotatoes.pdf","http://www.des.ucdavis.edu/faculty/Richerson/Baumetalprinted.pdf","http://arbeit.ucdavis.edu/mcelreath/files/mcelreath%20AA%202004.pdf","http://www.umass.edu/preferen/gintis/Unity-BBS%20Print%20Version.pdf","http://www.des.ucdavis.edu/faculty/Richerson/CultureIsBiology.pdf","http://www.umass.edu/preferen/gintis/Unity-BBS%20Print%20Version.pdf","http://www.des.ucdavis.edu/faculty/Richerson/CambMeme.PDF","https://people.ok.ubc.ca/lgabora/papers/gabora-five-JOCC2011.pdf","http://faculty.washington.edu/easmith/ThreeStyles.pdf","http://arbeit.ucdavis.edu/mcelreath/files/henrich%20mcelreath%20EA%202003.pdf","http://amesoudi.googlepages.com/Mesoudi_Whiten_Laland_BBS_2006.pdf","http://www.umass.edu/preferen/gintis/Unity-BBS%20Print%20Version.pdf","http://arbeit.ucdavis.edu/mcelreath/files/mcelreath_henrich_mce_final.pdf","http://arbeit.ucdavis.edu/mcelreath/files/Henrich%20and%20McElreath%20final.pdf","http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/boyd/Innateness%20ver%204.1.pdf","http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/boyd/Innateness%20ver%204.1.pdf","http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/boyd/Built%20for%20Speed,%20Not%20for%20Comfort.pdf","http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/boyd/Built%20for%20Speed,%20Not%20for%20Comfort.pdf"],"categories":["Anthropology","Cultural anthropology","Demography","Human evolution","Population genetics","Sociobiology"],"headings":["Theoretical basis","View of culture","Genetic influence on cultural evolution","Cultural influences on genetic evolution","Mechanisms of cultural evolution","Social learning and cumulative cultural evolution","Cultural group selection","Historical development","Current and future research","Relation to other fields","Criticisms","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/Unbalanced_scales.svg/45px-Unbalanced_scales.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["emulation","observational_learning"],["nature","journal"],["robert_boyd","anthropologist"]],"members":["robert_boyd","nature","emulation"],"related":["Human_behavior","Evolution","Genetic_evolution","Cultural_evolution","Observational_learning","Social_learning","Lactose","Demographic_transition","Mutation","Cultural_drift","Genetic_drift","Luigi_Luca_Cavalli-Sforza","Social_learning","Pleistocene","Emulation_(observational_learning)","Group_selection","George_C._Williams","George_C._Williams","John_Maynard_Smith","Nature_(journal)","Charles_Darwin","Donald_T._Campbell","Richard_Dawkins","Luigi_Luca_Cavalli-Sforza","E._O._Wilson","Luigi_Luca_Cavalli-Sforza","Population_genetics","Epidemiology","Vertical_transmission","Horizontal_transmission","Robert_Boyd_(anthropologist)","Peter_Richerson","E._O._Wilson","Herbert_Gintis","Behavioral_economics","Ethnography","Ethnology","Sociology","Cultural_anthropology","Sociobiology","Evolutionary_psychology","Human_behavioral_ecology","Memetics","Meme","Richard_Dawkins","Memetics","Epigenetics","Horizontal_gene_transfer","John_von_Neumann","John_Holland","Genetic_algorithm","Culture","Neural_Darwinism","Richard_Lewontin","Niles_Eldredge","Stuart_Kauffman","Nature_versus_nurture","Adaptive_bias","Cultural_selection_theory","Memetics","Luigi_Luca_Cavalli-Sforza"]}
