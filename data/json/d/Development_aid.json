It is distinguished from\nhumanitarian aid by focusing on alleviating poverty in the long term, rather\nthan a short term response.\n\nThe term development cooperation, which is used, for example, by the World\nHealth Organization (WHO) is used to express the idea that a partnership should\nexist between donor and recipient, rather than the traditional situation in\nwhich the relationship was dominated by the wealth and specialized knowledge of\none side.
