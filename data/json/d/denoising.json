Noise can be random or white noise with no coherence, or\ncoherent noise introduced by the device's mechanism or processing algorithms.\n\nIn electronic recording devices, a major form of noise is hiss caused by random\nelectrons that, heavily influenced by heat, stray from their designated path.\nThese stray electrons influence the voltage of the output signal and thus create\ndetectable noise.\n\nIn the case of photographic film and magnetic tape, noise (both visible and\naudible) is introduced due to the grain structure of the medium. In photographic\nfilm, the size of the grains in the film determines the film's sensitivity, more\nsensitive film having larger sized grains. In magnetic tape, the larger the\ngrains of the magnetic particles (usually ferric oxide or magnetite), the more\nprone the medium is to noise.\n\nTo compensate for this, larger areas of film or magnetic tape may be used to\nlower the noise to an acceptable level.\n","title":"Noise%20reduction","headings":["In audio","In images","See also","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["2: Magnetic_tape","2: Dolby_B","2: Dbx_Type_I","2: Dbx_Type_II","2: Pixel","2: Heat_equation","1: Noise","1: Analog_electronics","1: Digital_data","1: White_noise","1: Algorithm","1: Electronic_circuit","1: Electron","1: Voltage","1: Photographic_film","1: Ferric_oxide","1: Magnetite","1: Tape_hiss","1: Tape_head","1: CEDAR_Audio_Ltd","1: Phonograph_records","1: Dolby_C","1: Dolby_S","1: High_Com","1: High_Com_II","1: Toshiba","1: JVC","1: Ray_Dolby","1: Henry_Kloss","1: Dbx,_Inc.","1: Compander","1: Video_recording","1: Patent","1: Philips","1: Cassette_deck","1: Semiconductor","1: National_Semiconductor","1: Telephony","1: Dolby_noise_reduction_system","1: FM_radio","1: Telefunken","1: High&thinsp;Com","1: General_Motors_Corporation","1: Delco","1: Car_stereo","1: Jeep","1: Dither","1: Digital_camera","1: Film_camera","1: Aesthetics","1: Art","1: Marketing","1: Computer_vision","1: Salt_and_pepper_noise","1: Charge-coupled_device","1: Gaussian_noise","1: Normal_distribution","1: Central_limit_theorem","1: Independent_and_identically_distributed","1: Convolution","1: Low-pass_filter","1: Gaussian_function","1: Microphone","1: Biophysics","1: Chemometrics","1: Partial_differential_equation","1: Anisotropic_diffusion","1: Median_filter","1: Median","1: Neat_Image","1: Grain_Surgery","1: Noise_Ninja","1: DenoiseMyImage","1: Netpbm","1: Adobe_Photoshop","1: GIMP","1: Ulead_Systems","1: Paint_Shop_Pro","1: Helicon_Filter","1: Darktable","1: Digital_image_processing","1: Noise_print","1: Signal_processing","1: Signal_subspace","1: Architectural_acoustics","1: Noise-cancelling_headphones","1: Sound_masking","1: Dark_frame","1: Video_denoising"]}
