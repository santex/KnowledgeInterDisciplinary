{"cursor":"46216","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\n'Digestion' is the mechanical and chemical breakdown of food into smaller\ncomponents that are more easily absorbed into a blood stream, for instance.\nDigestion is a form of catabolism: a breakdown of large food molecules to\nsmaller ones.\n\nWhen food enters the mouth, its digestion starts by the action of mastication, a\nform of mechanical digestion, and the contact of saliva. Saliva, which is\nsecreted by the salivary glands, contains salivary amylase, an enzyme which\nstarts the digestion of starch in the food. After undergoing mastication and\nstarch digestion, the food will be in the form of a small, round slurry mass\ncalled a bolus. It will then travel down the esophagus and into the stomach by\nthe action of peristalsis. Gastric juice in the stomach starts protein\ndigestion. Gastric juice mainly contains hydrochloric acid and pepsin. As these\ntwo chemicals may damage the stomach wall, mucus is secreted by the stomach,\nproviding a slimy layer that acts as a shield against the damaging effects of\nthe chemicals. At the same time protein digestion is occurring, mechanical\nmixing occurs by peristalsis, which are waves of muscular contractions that move\nalong the stomach wall. This allows the mass of food to further mix with the\ndigestive enzymes. After some time (typically an hour or two in humans, 4â6\nhours in dogs, somewhat shorter duration in house cats), the resulting thick\nliquid is called chyme. When the pyloric sphincter valve opens, chyme enters the\nduodenum where it mixes with digestive enzymes from the pancreas, and then\npasses through the small intestine, in which digestion continues. When the chyme\nis fully digested, it is absorbed into the blood. 95% of absorption of nutrients\noccurs in the small intestine. Water and minerals are reabsorbed back into the\nblood in the colon (large intestine) where the pH is slightly acidic about 5.6 ~\n6.9. Some vitamins, such as biotin and vitamin K (K 2MK7) produced by\nbacteria in the colon are also absorbed into the blood in the colon.
