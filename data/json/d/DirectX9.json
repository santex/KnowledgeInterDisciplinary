Originally, the names of these APIs all began with\nDirect, such as Direct3D, DirectDraw, DirectMusic, DirectPlay, DirectSound, and\nso forth. The name DirectX was coined as shorthand term for all of these APIs\n(the X standing in for the particular API names) and soon became the name of the\ncollection. When Microsoft later set out to develop a gaming console, the X was\nused as the basis of the name Xbox to indicate that the console was based on\nDirectX technology. [http://www.economist.com/node/5214861 Microsoft: The\nmeaning of Xbox | Economist (US), The] The X initial has been carried\nforward in the naming of APIs designed for the Xbox such as XInput and the Cross-\nplatform Audio Creation Tool (XACT), while the DirectX pattern has been\ncontinued for Windows APIs such as Direct2D and DirectWrite.\n\nDirect3D (the 3D graphics API within DirectX) is widely used in the development\nof video games for Microsoft Windows, Microsoft Xbox, Microsoft Xbox 360 and\nsome Sega Dreamcast games. Direct3D is also used by other software applications\nfor visualization and graphics tasks such as CAD/CAM engineering. As Direct3D is\nthe most widely publicized component of DirectX, it is common to see the names\n\"DirectX\" and \"Direct3D\" used interchangeably.\n\nThe DirectX software development kit (SDK) consists of runtime libraries in\nredistributable binary form, along with accompanying documentation and headers\nfor use in coding. Originally, the runtimes were only installed by games or\nexplicitly by the user. Windows 95 did not launch with DirectX, but DirectX was\nincluded with Windows 95 OEM Service Release\n2. [http://www.computerhope.com/directx.htm DirectX Help ] Windows 98 and Windows NT 4.0 both shipped with DirectX, as has\nevery version of Windows released since. The SDK is available as a free\ndownload. While the runtimes are proprietary, closed-source software, source\ncode is provided for most of the SDK samples. Starting with the release of\nWindows 8 Developer Preview, DirectX SDK has been integrated into Windows\nSDK. [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-\nus/library/ee663275%28v=VS.85%29.aspx MSDN - Windows Development - Where is the\nDirectX SDK?]\n\nDirect3D 9Ex, Direct3D 10, and Direct3D 11 are only available for Windows Vista\nand newer because each of these new versions was built to depend upon the new\nWindows Display Driver Model that was introduced for Windows Vista. The new\nVista/WDDM graphics architecture includes a new video memory manager supporting\nvirtualization of graphics hardware for various applications and services like\nthe Desktop Window Manager.\n","linknr":1188,"url":"DirectX9","recorded":1362543411,"links":67,"instances":["computer_science","software","programming_language"],"pdf":["http://developer.amd.com/assets/GDC_2008_DirectX10.1.pdf","http://developer.amd.com/assets/GDC_2008_DirectX10.1.pdf","http://download.microsoft.com/download/1/E/4/1E455D53-C382-4A39-BA73-55413F183333/Windows_Developer_Preview-Windows8_guide.pdf"],"categories":["1995
