It is one of the\n  lower sulfur oxides. It is a colourless gas. It can be formed by reacting\n  thionyl chloride with silver sulfide:\n\n:SOCl 2 + Ag 2S â AgCl + S 2O.\n\nThis is done under low pressure and high temperature. Another way to\nform it is via a glow discharge in sulfur dioxide. The\narrangement of atoms is SSO in a bent form. The angle formed at the central\nsulfur atom is 117.88Â°. The sulfur to sulfur bond length is 188.4pm, and the\nlength of the oxygen bond is 146.5pm. {{cite journal\n| quotes = | last =Meschi | first =D.J. | authorlink = | coauthors = Myers R.J.|\n| date = | year = 1959| month = | title = The microwave spectrum, structure, and\n| dipole moment of disulfur monoxide| journal = Journal of Molecular\n| Spectroscopy| volume = 3| issue =1â6 | pages =405â416 | publisher = | doi =\n| 10.1016/0022-2852(59)90036-0| url = |bibcode = 1959JMoSp...3..405M }} It\n| can form an orange red condensate at liquid nitrogen temperatures.
