Many such startups were formed to take advantage of the surplus of\nventure capital funding. Many were launched with very thin business plans,\nsometimes with nothing more than an idea and a catchy name. The stated goal was\noften to \"get big fast\", i.e. to capture a majority share of whatever market was\nbeing entered. The exit strategy usually included an IPO and a large payoff for\nthe founders. Others were existing companies that re-styled themselves as\nInternet companies, many of them legally changing their names to incorporate a\n.com suffix.\n\nWith the stock market crash around the year 2000 that ended the dot-com bubble,\nmany failed and failing dot-com companies were referred to punningly as 'dot-\nbombs', 'dot-cons' or 'dot-gones'. http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-811729-\ndetails/From+dotcoms+to+dotgones../article.do Many of the surviving firms\ndropped the .com suffix from their names.\n","linknr":273,"url":"Dot-com_company","recorded":1362485796,"links":27,"instances":["website","company"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Online companies|","Internet companies|*","Dot-com bubble"],"headings":["List of well-known failed dot-coms","Acquisitions","Notes and references","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Nuvola_apps_kaboodle.svg/30px-Nuvola_apps_kaboodle.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Nuvola_apps_kaboodle.svg/16px-Nuvola_apps_kaboodle.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["inktomi","company"],["dodgeball","website"]],"members":["dodgeball","inktomi"],"related":["Internet","Website","Generic_top-level_domain",".com","Startup_company","Venture_capital","Business_plan","Get_big_fast","Market_share","Exit_strategy","Initial_Public_Offering","Stock_market_crash","Dot-com_bubble","Dot-com_bubble","Boo.com","Broadband_Sports","Cyberian_Outpost","Fry's_Electronics","CyberRebate","DigiScents","EToys.com","Toys_\"R\"_Us","Excite","AOL","Broadband","Internet_service_provider","Flooz.com","Whoopi_Goldberg","Go.com","Web_portal","The_Walt_Disney_Company","Kozmo.com","TheGlobe.com","Stephan_Paternot","GovWorks","James_H._Clark","Pets.com","Pseudo.com","Ritmoteca.com","Online_music_store","ITunes","Universal_Music_Group","Sony_Music_Entertainment","Bertelsmann_Music_Group","Warner_Music_Group","Webvan","CNET","Amazon.com","Zapata_Corporation","Domain_name","MSN_Hotmail","Microsoft","Internet_Movie_Database","Amazon.com","Viaweb","Yahoo!","Netscape_Communications","AOL","GeoCities","Yahoo!","Broadcast.com","Yahoo!","Thawte","VeriSign","Network_Solutions","VeriSign","EGroups","Yahoo!","AllBusiness.com","Yahoo!_HotJobs","Yahoo!","CDNow","Amazon.com","PayPal","EBay","Inktomi_(company)","Yahoo!","Pyra_Labs","Google","Yahoo!_Search_Marketing","Yahoo!","Google_Earth","Google","Kelkoo","Yahoo!","Picasa","Google","Oddpost.com","Yahoo!","Lycos","Daum_Communications","Upcoming.org","Yahoo!","Ask.com","IAC/InterActiveCorp","Dialpad","Yahoo!","MySpace","News_Corporation","Konfabulator","Yahoo!","Dodgeball_(website)","Google","Provide_Commerce","Liberty_Media","Friends_Reunited","ITV_plc","Del.icio.us","Yahoo!","Webjay","Yahoo!"]}
