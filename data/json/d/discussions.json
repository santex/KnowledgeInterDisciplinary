dispute, controversy; discussion; especially\nthe discussion of questions of public interest in Parliament or in any\nassembly.<ref>The Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd ed., .</ref>\n\nDebate is a method of interactive and representational argument. Debate is a\nbroader form of argument than deductive reasoning, which only examines whether a\nconclusion is a consequence of premises, and factual argument, which only\nexamines what is or isn't the case, or rhetoric, which is a technique of\npersuasion. Though logical consistency, factual accuracy and some degree of\nemotional appeal to the audience are important elements of the art of\npersuasion, in debating, one side often prevails over the other side by\npresenting a superior \"context\" and/or framework of the issue, which is far more\nsubtle and strategic. The outcome of a debate depends upon consensus or some\nformal way of reaching a resolution, rather than the objective facts as such. In\na formal debating contest, there are rules for participants to discuss and\ndecide on differences, within a framework defining how they will interact.\n\nDebating is commonly carried out in many assemblies of various types to discuss\nmatters and to make resolutions about action to be taken, often by a vote.\nDeliberative bodies such as parliaments, legislative assemblies, and meetings of\nall sorts engage in debates. In particular, in parliamentary democracies a\nlegislature debates and decides on new laws. Formal debates between candidates\nfor elected office, such as the leaders debates and the U.S. presidential\nelection debates, are sometimes held in democracies. Debating is also carried\nout for educational and recreational purposes, usually associated with\neducational establishments. The major goal of the study of debate as a method or\nart is to develop the ability to debate rationally from either position with\nequal ease.\n\nAlthough informal debate is common the quality and depth of a debate\nimproves with knowledge and skill of its participants as debaters. The\noutcome of a contest may be decided by audience vote, by judges, or by some\ncombination of the two.\n","title":"Debate","headings":["Debating for decision-making","Educational debating","Other forms of debate","See also","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["3: Policy_debate","2: Argument","2: Parliament","2: United_Kingdom","2: World_Universities_Debating_Championship","2: American_Parliamentary_Debate_Association","2: Lincoln-Douglas_debate","1: Controversy","1: Conversation","1: Public_interest","1: Deliberative_assembly","1: Deductive_reasoning","1: Rhetoric","1: Legislature","1: Law","1: Election","1: President","1: Prime_minister","1: General_election","1: U.S._presidential_election,_1976","1: American_presidential_debate","1: Television_commercial","1: Talk_radio","1: Soundbite","1: League_of_Women_Voters","1: Commission_on_Presidential_Debates","1: Citizens'_Debate_Commission","1: Judge","1: Proposition","1: Parliamentary_procedure","1: India","1: Greece","1: English-Speaking_Union","1: East_Coast_of_the_United_States","1: Ivy_League","1: National_Parliamentary_Debate_Association","1: Oxford_Union","1: Oxford_University","1: Majority","1: Chairman","1: Convict","1: Vote","1: Team","1: Audience","1: Traditionally","1: Key_point","1: Analytical_skills","1: Entertainment","1: United_Asian_Debating_Championship","1: United_States","1: Lincoln-Douglas_Debates_of_1858","1: Karl_Popper","1: Open_Society_Institute","1: Congressional_Debate","1: Model_United_Nations","1: European_Youth_Parliament","1: Junior_State_of_America","1: American_Legion","1: Boys/Girls_State","1: Internet","1: Internet_forum","1: Policy_Debate","1: CreateDebate","1: Dialectics","1: Harvard_Model_United_Nations","1: Heart_of_Europe_Debating_Tournament","1: World_Individual_Debating_and_Public_Speaking_Championships","1: World_Schools_Debating_Championships","1: Debate_camp#Popular_camps/institutes","1: Australasian_Intervarsity_Debating_Championships","1: Canadian_University_Society_for_Intercollegiate_Debate","1: Harvard_World_Model_United_Nations","1: International_Public_Debate_Association","1: National_Association_of_Urban_Debate_Leagues","1: National_Model_United_Nations","1: North_American_Debating_Championship","1: North_American_Public_Speaking_Championship"]}
