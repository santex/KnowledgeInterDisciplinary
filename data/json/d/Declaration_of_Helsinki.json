It is widely regarded as the cornerstone\ndocument of human research ethics. (WMA 2000, BoÅ¡njak 2001, Tyebkhan 2003)\n\nIt is not a legally binding instrument in international law, but instead draws\nits authority from the degree to which it has been codified in, or influenced,\nnational or regional legislation and regulations (Human and Fluss 2001). Its\nrole was described by a Brazilian forum in 2000 in these words \"Even though the\nDeclaration of Helsinki is the responsibility of the World Medical Association,\nthe document should be considered the property of all humanity\" (Human and\nFluss 2001).\n","linknr":606,"url":"Declaration_of_Helsinki","recorded":1362505327,"links":49,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/nhrpac/mtg12-00/h2000-1996.pdf","http://www.pre.ethics.gc.ca/pdf/eng/tcps2/TCPS_2_FINAL_Web.pdf","http://www.nuffieldbioethics.org/fileLibrary/pdf/HRRDC_Follow-up_Discussion_Paper001.pdf","http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0014/001461/146180E.pdf","http://www.wma.net/e/ethicsunit/pdf/wg_doh_jan2004.pdf","http://216.147.199.31/PDF/APPI-Endorses-Helsinki-Updates.pdf","http://www.tera.org/Publications/comparisontable.pdf","http://www.tera.org/Publications/comparisontable.pdf","http://www.wma.net/e/ethicsunit/pdf/draft_historical_contemporary_perspectives.pdf","http://www.wma.net/e/ethicsunit/pdf/bibliography_draft_historical_contemporary_perspectives.pdf","http://www.onk.ns.ac.rs/Archive/Vol9/PDFVol9/V9n3p179.pdf","http://www.wma.net/e/publications/pdf/wmj1.pdf","http://www.wma.net/e/publications/pdf/wmj20.pdf","http://www.wma.net/e/ethicsunit/pdf/intl_response_helsinki.pdf","http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=1816102&blobtype=pdf","http://www.ftsr.ulaval.ca/ethiques/DOH/1989.pdf","http://www.brookwoodacademy.org/Documents/Declaration_of_Helsinki_1996_version.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20071027224123/www.wma.net/e/policy/pdf/17c.pdf","http://www.wma.net/e/ethicsunit/pdf/manual/ethics_manual.pdf","http://www.nuffieldbioethics.org/fileLibrary/pdf/HRRDC_Follow-up_Discussion_Paper001.pdf","http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0014/001461/146180E.pdf"],"categories":["Medical research","Clinical research","Human subject research|*","Research ethics"],"headings":["History","Principles","Future","Timeline (WMA meetings)","See also","References","Training","Bibliography","Other codes and regulations","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Human_experimentation","World_Medical_Association","Research_ethics","Helsinki","Finland","Nuremberg_Code","Nuremberg_Code","Declaration_of_Geneva","Human_experimentation","Institutional_Review_Board","Povl_Riis","Common_rule","CIOMS","World_Health_Organization","CIOMS_Guidelines","ACTG","Zidovudine","HIV","Placebo","Standard_of_care","Centers_for_Disease_Control","National_Institutes_of_Health","CIOMS","Food_and_Drug_Administration","European_Union","Clinical_Trials_Directive","Placebo","Marcia_Angell","Utilitarian","Distributive_justice","Cairo","São_Paulo","Feminist_Approaches_to_Bioethics","CIOMS","Informed_consent","Good_clinical_practice","Good_clinical_practice","European_Commission","Informed_consent","Medical_ethics","Clinical_trial","Human_experimentation_in_the_United_States","Clinical_Research","Nuremberg_Code","Declaration_of_Geneva","Belmont_Report","CIOMS","Good_clinical_practice","International_Conference_on_Harmonisation_of_Technical_Requirements_for_Registration_of_Pharmaceuticals_for_Human_Use","Code_of_Federal_Regulations"]}
