Visual discoveries are often called\n'sightings'.\n","title":"Discovery%20%28observation%29","headings":["Description","Exploration","See also","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["1: The_American_Adventure","1: Walt_Disney_World","1: Epcot","1: Sense","1: Knowledge","1: Question","1: Invention","1: Phenomenon","1: Scientific_evidence","1: Particle_physics","1: Standard_deviation#Table","1: Statistic","1: Experiment","1: Randomness","1: Western_culture","1: Exploration","1: Age_of_Exploration","1: Creativity_techniques","1: Serendipity","1: Timeline_of_scientific_discoveries","1: PBS","1: Infoplease"]}
