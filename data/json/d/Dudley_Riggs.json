Riggs was born in Little Rock,\nArkansas and joined the circus when he was five years old. His family performed\nin a variety of acts with the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus where he\nlearned comedy in the vaudeville style. Later, he formed a group that toured the\ncountry during winters when the circus was not operating.\n\nAudiences at shows put on by the troupe were often quite hostile toward the\nperformers. After years of trying to appease the crowds with traditional\nperformance styles, Riggs began to request input from them. As an example, he\nmight ask \"Who do you hate in this town?\" If the audience replied, \"the mayor,\"\nthe performers would quickly improvise a scene about the mayor. However, at the\ntime, [[improvisation]] was a word primarily used to describe the actions of\njazz musicians. Riggs was an admirer of jazz and avoided using the term himself,\npreferring the phrase \"instant theater.\" Later, a [[New York Times]] critic\ncalled Riggs' performances \"word jazz,\" while members of the Second City troupe\nvisiting in the 1960s and 1970s referred to the shows as \"spot improv.\"\n\nOne year, the booking agent for the troupe stated that he couldn't find anyplace\nwilling to take the performers. In order to keep skills strong, Riggs rented a\nstreet-level space in New York City where group members could practice. People\nwalking by could see what was going on by looking through the window, and passers-\nby soon began to offer money to watch rehearsals. Riggs soon booked a venue and\nput on a regular show.\n\nThe famous critic Walter Kerr was an early attendee, and was amazed by what he\nsaw. He held off writing a review for three weeks because he couldn't believe\nthat the performers were actually taking in the audience's ideas—Kerr was\nconvinced that group members were calling upon accomplices for input and were\nusing pre-arranged material. After realizing the authenticity of performances,\nhe wrote a glowing review.\n\nThe group began touring and eventually settled in Minneapolis in 1958. They were\noriginally at a site called \"Dudley Riggs CafÃ© Espresso\" on East Hennepin\nAvenue, where Riggs operated the first espresso machine in the state. After the\ncafÃ© moved to South Hennepin in Uptown in 1965, claims of \"the first espresso\nmachine west of the Mississippi River\" were also made. (Incidentally, the Uptown\nneighborhood now proclaims that they have more coffee shops per capita than\nSeattle, so Riggs may have been influential there as well.) The name was finally\nchanged to \"Brave New Workshop\" at the same time.\n\nRiggs opened the Experimental Theater Company (E.T.C.) in the Seven Corners area\nof Minneapolis, next to the University of Minnesota, in the early 1970s. This\ntheater provided a wider range of material including stand-up comedy, variety\nshows, and specialty acts.\n\nA number of famous performers started at the Brave New Workshop, including\nregional natives Louie Anderson and Al Franken, and writers such as Pat Proft,\ntelevision executive producer Linda Wallem, and scriptwriter and\nproducer/director Peter Tolan.\n\nThere was some sharing of experience and technique between BNW and Second City\nin Chicago. Del Close worked with Riggs for a time, and members of both troupes\nwere regulars at each other's shows when traveling.\n\nAfter operating it for 39 years, Riggs sold the Brave New Workshop in 1997 to\nMark Bergen, John Sweeney and Jenni Lilledahl, though Bergen eventually moved on\nto other projects. Sweeney and Lilledahl still operate the theater and have made\nsome changes. Their focus is more on long-form improvisation, while Riggs had\nalways been more focused on shorter individual sketches.\n","linknr":113,"url":"Dudley_Riggs","recorded":1364030731,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Dudley_Riggs&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Dudley_Riggs&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/Dudley_Riggs_(American_football)","/wiki/Improvisational_comedy","/wiki/Minneapolis","/wiki/Brave_New_Workshop","/wiki/Little_Rock,_Arkansas","/wiki/Circus","/wiki/Ringling_Bros._and_Barnum_%26_Bailey_Circus","/wiki/Vaudeville","/wiki/Audience","/wiki/Improvisation","/wiki/Jazz","/wiki/Musician","/wiki/New_York_Times","/wiki/Critic","/wiki/The_Second_City","/wiki/Booking_agent","/wiki/New_York_City","/wiki/Walter_Kerr","/wiki/Accomplice","/wiki/Hennepin_Avenue","/wiki/Espresso_machine","/wiki/Caf%C3%A9","/wiki/Uptown,_Minneapolis","/wiki/Mississippi_River","/wiki/Seattle,_Washington","/wiki/University_of_Minnesota","/wiki/Stand-up_comedy","/wiki/Variety_show","/wiki/Louie_Anderson","/wiki/Al_Franken","/wiki/Pat_Proft","/wiki/Linda_Wallem","/wiki/The_Second_City","/wiki/Chicago,_Illinois","/wiki/Del_Close","/w/index.php?title=Mark_Bergen&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/John_J._Sweeney_(professional_speaker)","/w/index.php?title=Jenni_Lilledahl&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Dudley_Riggs&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Stevie_Ray%27s_Improv_Company&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Google","http://google.com/search?q=cache:5VV1HRyKN28J:www.bravenewworkshop.org/theatre/historicaltimeline.cfm+%22dudley+riggs%22+born&hl=en","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dudley_Riggs&oldid=541603564","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1932_births","/wiki/Category:Living_people","/wiki/Category:American_comedians","/wiki/Category:People_from_Little_Rock,_Arkansas","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Dudley+Riggs&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Dudley+Riggs","/wiki/Dudley_Riggs","/wiki/Talk:Dudley_Riggs","#","/wiki/Dudley_Riggs","/w/index.php?title=Dudley_Riggs&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Dudley_Riggs&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Dudley_Riggs","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Dudley_Riggs","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Dudley_Riggs&oldid=541603564","/w/index.php?title=Dudley_Riggs&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Dudley_Riggs&id=541603564","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Dudley+Riggs","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Dudley+Riggs&oldid=541603564&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Dudley_Riggs&printable=yes","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dudley_Riggs","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=skins.vector&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","/w/index.php?title=MediaWiki:Gadget-ReferenceTooltips.js&action=raw&ctype=text/javascript&508635914","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":["professional_speaker"],"pdf":[],"categories":["1932
