The two terms have often been understood as\nfundamentally the same as sense-for-sense translation (translating the meanings\nof phrases or whole sentences) and word-for-word translation (translating the\nmeanings of individual words in their more or less exact syntactic sequence),\nrespectively, and Nida did often seem to use them this way. But his original\ndefinition of dynamic equivalence was rhetorical: the idea was that the\ntranslator should translate so that the effect of the translation on the target\nreader is roughly the same as the effect of the source text once was on the\nsource reader.\n","linknr":177,"url":"Dynamic_and_formal_equivalence","recorded":1362539301,"links":23,"instances":["bible","aristotle_"],"pdf":["http://www.tms.edu/tmsj/tmsj1d.pdf","http://www.northwest.cc/uploads/2/1/0/1/210144/bibletranslationchart.pdf"],"categories":["Translation studies","Biblical criticism"],"headings":["Function vs. form","Theory and practice","Bible translation","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/9a/Formal_bible_trans_rel.png/250px-Formal_bible_trans_rel.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["rhetoric","aristotle_"],["the_message","bible"]],"members":["the_message","rhetoric"],"related":["Translation","Eugene_Nida","Sense-for-sense_translation","Word-for-word_translation","Rhetoric_","Semantic","Sense-for-sense_translation","Aristotle","Rhetoric_(Aristotle)_","Bible","Novel","Diplomacy","Neologism","Idiom","Rhetoric","Chiastic_structure","Hebrew_Bible","Diction","King_James_Version","Young's_Literal_Translation","Lexham_English_Bible","Revised_Version","American_Standard_Version","Revised_Standard_Version","New_American_Standard_Bible","New_King_James_Version","English_Standard_Version","New_Revised_Standard_Version","Douay-Rheims","Green's_Literal_Translation","New_International_Version","Today's_New_International_Version","Holman_Christian_Standard_Bible","New_American_Bible","New_English_Translation","Modern_Language_Bible","New_Jerusalem_Bible","New_English_Bible","Revised_English_Bible","Good_News_Bible","Complete_Jewish_Bible","New_Living_Translation","God's_Word_Translation","Contemporary_English_Version","The_Message_(Bible)","The_Living_Bible","Lexical_markup_framework","The_Bible_version_debate","Translation","Textualism","Jurisprudence","Original_meaning","Original_intent","Purposivism","Purposive_theory"]}
