It is everything which may be\npreserved or represented in order to serve as evidence for some purpose. The\nclassical example provided by Suzanne Briet is an antelope: \"An antelope running\nwild on the plains of Africa should not be considered a document, she rules. But\nif it were to be captured, taken to a zoo and made an object of study, it has\nbeen made into a document. It has become physical evidence being used by those\nwho study it. Indeed, scholarly articles written about the antelope are\nsecondary documents, since the antelope itself is the primary document.\" (Quoted\nfrom Buckland, 1998 <ref>Buckland, M. (1998). What is a digital document? In:\nDocument Numérique (Paris) 2(2),\nhttp://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~buckland/digdoc.html</ref>). (This view has\nbeen seen as an early expression of what now is known as actor–network theory).\n\nThat documents cannot be defined by their transmission medium (such as paper) is\nevident because of the existence of electronic documents.\n",
