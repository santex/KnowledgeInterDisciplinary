A dissipative process is a process in which\nenergy (internal, bulk flow kinetic, or system potential) is transformed from\nsome initial form to some final form; the capacity of the final form to do\nmechanical work is less than that of the initial form. For example, transfer of\nenergy as heat is dissipative because it is a transfer of internal energy from a\nhotter body to a colder one. The second law of thermodynamics implies that this\nreduces the capacity of the combination of the two bodies to do mechanical work.\n\nThermodynamic dissipative processes are essentially irreversible. They produce\nentropy at a finite rate. In a process in which the temperature is locally\ncontinuously defined, the local density of rate of entropy production times\nlocal temperature gives the local density of dissipated power.\n\nImportant examples of irreversible processes are:\n# Heat flow through a thermal resistance Fluid flow through a flow resistance\n# Diffusion (mixing) Chemical reactions Electrical current flow through an\n# electrical resistance (Joule heating).\n\nThe concept of dissipation was introduced in the field of thermodynamics by\nWilliam Thomson (Lord Kelvin) in 1852.<ref>W. Thomson On the universal tendency\nin nature to the dissipation of mechanical energy Philosophical Magazine, Ser.\n4, p.304 (1852).</ref>\n\nA particular occasion of occurrence of a dissipative process cannot be described\nby a single individual Hamiltonian formalism. A dissipative process requires a\ncollection of admissible individual Hamiltonian descriptions, exactly which one\ndescribes the actual particular occurrence of the process of interest being\nunknown. This includes friction, and all similar forces that result in\ndecoherency of energy&mdash;that is, conversion of coherent or directed energy\nflow into an indirected or more isotropic distribution of energy.\n\nWaves or oscillations, lose energy over time, typically from friction or\nturbulence. In many cases the \"lost\" energy raises the temperature of the\nsystem. For example, a wave that loses amplitude is said to 'dissipate'. The\nprecise nature of the effects depends on the nature of the wave: an atmospheric\nwave, for instance, may dissipate close to the surface due to friction with the\nland mass, and at higher levels due to radiative cooling.\n\nIn computational physics, numerical dissipation (also known as \"numerical\ndiffusion\") refers to certain side-effects that may occur as a result of a\nnumerical solution to a differential equation. When the pure advection equation,\nwhich is free of dissipation, is solved by a numerical approximation method, the\nenergy of the initial wave may be reduced in a way analogous to a diffusional\nprocess. Such a method is said to contain 'dissipation'. In some cases,\n\"artificial dissipation\" is intentionally added to improve the numerical\nstability characteristics of the solution.<ref>Thomas, J.W. Numerical Partial\nDifferential Equation: Finite Difference Methods. Springer-Verlag. New York.\n(1995)</ref>\n\nA formal, mathematical definition of dissipation, as commonly used in the\nmathematical study of measure-preserving dynamical systems, is given in the\narticle [[wandering set]].\n","title":"Dissipation","headings":["In water engineering","See also","References"]},"micro-relation":["2: Entropy_production","2: Wave","2: Friction","1: Irreversible_processes","1: Thermodynamics","1: Joule_heating","1: William_Thomson","1: Hamiltonian_mechanics","1: Isotropic","1: Oscillation","1: Energy","1: Time","1: Turbulence","1: Temperature","1: Amplitude","1: Atmospheric_wave","1: Radiative_cooling","1: Computational_physics","1: Advection","1: Numerical_stability","1: Measure-preserving_dynamical_system","1: Erosion","1: Stream_bed","1: Waterfall","1: Waterfall#Types","1: Riprap","1: Kinetic_energy","1: Flood_control","1: Two_dimensional_gas"]}
