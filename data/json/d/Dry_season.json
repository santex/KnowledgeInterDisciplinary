The weather\nin the tropics is dominated by the tropical rain belt, which oscillates from the\nnorthern to the southern tropics over the course of the year. The tropical rain\nbelt lies in the southern hemisphere roughly from October to March, and during\nthis time the northern tropics experience a dry season in which precipitation is\nmore rare, and days are typically sunny throughout. From April to September, the\nrain belt lies in the northern hemisphere, and the southern tropics experience\ntheir dry season. Under the KÃ¶ppen climate classification, for tropical\nclimates, a dry season month is defined as a month where average precipitation\nis below .\n\nThe dry season is characterized by its low humidity, and some watering holes and\nrivers drying up. Because of the lack of these watering holes, many grazing\nanimals are forced to migrate due to the lack of water and feed to more fertile\nspots. Examples of such animals are zebras, elephants, and\nwildebeest. Because of the lack of water in the plants, bushfires are\ncommon.\n\nData shows that in Africa, the advent of the Dry Season coincides with a rise in\nthe cases of measlesâwhich researchers believe might be attributed to the higher\nconcentration of people in the dry season, as agricultural operations are all\nbut impossible without irrigation. During this time, some farmers move into\ncities, creating hubs of higher population density, and allowing disease to\nspread more easily.\n\nThe rain belt reaches roughly as far north as the Tropic of Cancer and as far\nsouth as the Tropic of Capricorn. Near these latitudes, there is one wet season\nand one dry season annually. On the equator, there are two wet and two dry\nseasons as the rain belt passes over twice a year, once moving north and once\nmoving south. Between the tropics and the equator, locations may experience a\nshort wet and a long wet season. Local geography may substantially modify these\nclimate patterns, however.\n\nNew data shows that in the South American Amazon Rainforest, foliage growth and\ncoverage varies in between the dry and wet seasons-with approximately 25% more\nleaves and faster growth in the dry season. Researchers believe that the Amazon\nitself has an effect in bringing the onset of the wet season; by growing more\nfoliage, it evaporates more water. However, this growth appears only\nin the undisturbed parts of the Amazon, where researchers believe roots can\nreach deeper and gather more rain water. {{cite web | url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2006-03/uoa-\narg031506.php | title=Amazon rainforest greens up in the dry season }} It\nhas also been shown that the ozone levels differ between the dry and wet seasons\nin the Amazon, with the level being substantially higher in the dry season than\nin wet season.\n","linknr":220,"url":"Dry_season","recorded":1362372925,"links":51,"instances":["meteorology"],"pdf":["http://www.hydrol-earth-syst-sci.net/11/1633/2007/hess-11-1633-2007.pdf","http://www.hydrol-earth-syst-sci.net/11/1633/2007/hess-11-1633-2007.pdf"],"categories":["Climate","Seasons"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/94/Cloud.jpg/32px-Cloud.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8b/Nuvola_apps_kalzium.svg/28px-Nuvola_apps_kalzium.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["precipitation","meteorology"]],"members":["precipitation"],"related":["Tropics","Tropical_rain_belt","Oscillation","Precipitation_(meteorology)","Köppen_climate_classification","Tropical_climate","Zebras","Elephants","Wildebeest","Measles","Tropic_of_Cancer","Tropic_of_Capricorn","South_America","Amazon_Rainforest","Ozone"]}
