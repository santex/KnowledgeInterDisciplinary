{"cursor":"11301","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nThe 'doctrine of equivalents' is a legal rule in most of the world's patent\nsystems that allows a court to hold a party liable for patent infringement even\nthough the infringing device or process does not fall within the literal scope\nof a patent claim, but nevertheless is equivalent to the claimed invention. U.S.\njudge Learned Hand has described its purpose as being \"to temper unsparing logic\nand prevent an infringer from stealing the benefit of the invention\". Royal\nTypewriter Co. v. [[Remington Rand]], Inc., 168 F.2d 691, 692 (2d Cir. 1948).\n\nThe goal of the doctrine of equivalents is to provide patent owners with fair\nprotection for their patents. Historically, courts took a literal approach to\npatent interpretation, based on established principles of legal interpretation.\nHowever, by the 18th and 19th centuries, this had come to be seen as unduly\nlimiting on the scope of protection afforded a patent-holder, especially as\npatent applicants are often required to describe new technology for which an\nadequate vocabulary has not yet been developed. In response to this, the English\ncourts developed a so-called 'pith and marrow' approach, which tried to\ndistinguish between the essential and non-essential features of a patent claim\nwhen deciding infringement cases. At the same time, courts in other countries,\nnotably the United States, developed slightly different approaches to claim\ninterpretation, of which the 'doctrine of equivalents' is perhaps the most\nfamous. The equivalents doctrine takes a more holistic approach when comparing\nthe patented invention with an alleged infringing device than did the 'pith and\nmarrow' approach.\n\nAttempts are ongoing at harmonizing the different approaches internationally\n(see below); however, progress is slow due to the long history of patent law in\ndeveloped nations. The doctrine has been criticized as unduly vague, to the\nextent that it injects uncertainty and unpredictability to a patent system.\n","linknr":168,"url":"Doctrine_of_equivalents","recorded":1362539300,"links":21,"instances":["patent"],"pdf":["http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/opinions/08-1240.pdf","http://www.ll.georgetown.edu/federal/judicial/fed/opinions/97opinions/97-1194.pdf","http://www.iwr.unibe.ch/content/ueber_uns/prof_cyrill_p_rigamonti/english/publications_by_prof_dr_cyrill_p_rigamonti/e7137/e7141/e7413/e7421/Rigamonti_40IDEA163_ger.pdf","http://wikileaks.org/leak/crs/RL31156.pdf"],"categories":["Patent law","Legal doctrines and principles"],"headings":["Standards for determining equivalents","Harmonization attempts","Landmark decisions","See also","References","Sources","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["claim","patent"],["claim","patent"]],"members":["claim"],"related":["Patent","Court","Patent_infringement","Claim_(patent)","Invention","Learned_Hand","Technology","Vocabulary","Holistic","France","Germany","Japan","Japan's_Supreme_Court","Estoppel","United_Kingdom","Lord_Hoffmann","Kirin-Amgen_v_Hoechst_Marion_Roussel","House_of_Lords","United_States","Prosecution_history_estoppel","World_Intellectual_Property_Organization","Paris_Convention_for_the_Protection_of_Industrial_Property","EPC_2000","United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Federal_Circuit","Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States","Claim_(patent)","Prosecution_history_estoppel","Boston_University_School_of_Law"]}
