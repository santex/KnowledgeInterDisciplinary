Sometimes \"diesel oil\" is used to mean\n:[[lubricating oil]] for [[diesel engine]]s.\n'Diesel fuel' () in general is any liquid fuel used in diesel engines. The most\ncommon is a specific fractional distillate of petroleum fuel oil, but\nalternatives that are not derived from petroleum, such as biodiesel, biomass to\nliquid (BTL) or gas to liquid (GTL) diesel, are increasingly being developed and\nadopted. To distinguish these types, petroleum-derived diesel is increasingly\ncalled 'petrodiesel'. Traders and importers now use the term, as well as\nacademic journals for example ACS publications (See 2006\n[http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ef0502711 article] on comparing Petrodiesel\nemissions with other types of fuel). The term is common in blogs and informal\nwiki sites, and is used several times in this article itself. Ultra-low\nsulfur diesel (ULSD) is a standard for defining diesel fuel with substantially\nlowered sulfur contents. As of 2007, almost all diesel fuel available in the\nUnited States of America, Canada and Europe is the ULSD type.\n\nIn the UK, diesel fuel for on-road use is commonly abbreviated 'DERV', standing\nfor Diesel Engined Road Vehicle, which carries a tax premium over equivalent\nfuel for non-road use (see Taxation). {{Cite web |title=The UK oil industry\nover the past 100 years
