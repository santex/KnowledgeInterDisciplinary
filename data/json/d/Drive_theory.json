{"cursor":"11225","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The terms 'drive theory' and 'drive reduction theory' refer to a diverse set of\nmotivational theories in psychology. Drive Reduction Theory, developed by Clark\nHull in 1943, was the first theory for motivation (Dewey, 2007). Drive is an\nâexcitatory state produced by a homeostatic disturbanceâ (Seward, 1956). Drive\ntheory is based on the principle that organisms are born with certain\npsychological needs and that a negative state of tension is created when these\nneeds are not satisfied. When a need is satisfied, drive is reduced and the\norganism returns to a state of homeostasis and relaxation. According to the\ntheory, drive tends to increase over time and operates on a feedback control\nsystem, much like a thermostat.\n","linknr":143,"url":"Drive_theory","recorded":1362671039,"links":16,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Motivation","Psychoanalytic terminology","Learning psychology","Social psychology"],"headings":["Psychoanalysis","Learning theory","Early attachment theory","Social psychology","See also","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Motivation","Psychology","Homeostasis","Freud","Psychoanalysis","Death_drive","Civilization_and_Its_Discontents","Clark_Hull","Kenneth_Spence","Classical_conditioning","Social_psychology","Robert_Zajonc","Social_facilitation","Audience_effect","Arousal","Ant","Cockroach","Evaluation_Apprehension_model","Clark_Hull","Yerkes-Dodson_law","Incentive_theory"]}
