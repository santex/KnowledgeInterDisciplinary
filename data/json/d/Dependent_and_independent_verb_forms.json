{"cursor":"19348","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In the Goidelic languages, 'dependent and independent verb forms' are distinct\nverb forms; each tense of each verb exists in both forms. Verbs are often\npreceded by a particle which marks negation, or a question, or has some other\nforce. The dependent verb forms are used after a particle, while independent\nforms are used when the verb is not subject to a particle. For example, in\nIrish, the past tense of the verb (\"to see\") has two forms: the independent form\nand the dependent form . The independent form is used when no particle precedes\nthe verb, as in (\"I saw John\"). As the Goidelic languages use\nverbâsubjectâobject word orders, the verb (\"saw\") precedes the subject\n(\"I\"). The dependent form is used when a particle such as (\"not\") precedes\nthe verb, as in (\"I did not see John\"). The particle triggers\nlenition of the verb, changing (pronounced ) to (pronounced ).\n","linknr":265,"url":"Dependent_and_independent_verb_forms","recorded":1362543984,"links":14,"instances":["linguistics","punctuation"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Verb types","Goidelic languages"],"headings":["Old Irish","Scottish Gaelic","Manx","Irish","Footnotes","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["colon","punctuation"],["stress","linguistics"]],"members":["stress","colon"],"related":["Goidelic_languages","Verb","Grammatical_particle","Irish_language","Past_tense","Verb–subject–object","Old_Irish","Prefix","Grammatical_particle","Relative_pronoun","Interpunct","Hyphen","Colon_(punctuation)","Stress_(linguistics)","Ancient_Greek","Phonology","Scottish_Gaelic","Manx_language","Initial_mutation","Early_Modern_Irish","Irish_language","Relative_clause","Conditional_clause","Realis","Irrealis"]}
