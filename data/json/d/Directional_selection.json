{"cursor":"2518","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nIn population genetics, 'directional selection' is a mode of natural selection\nin which a single phenotype is favored, causing the allele frequency to\ncontinuously shift in one direction. Under directional selection, the\nadvantageous allele increases in frequency independently of its dominance\nrelative to other alleles; that is, even if the advantageous allele is\nrecessive, it will eventually become fixed.\n\nDirectional selection occurs most often under environmental changes and when\npopulations migrate to new areas with different environmental pressures. An\nexample of directional selection is fossil records that show that the size of\nthe black bears in Europe decreased during interglacial periods of the ice ages,\nbut increased during each glacial period. Another example is the beak size in a\npopulation of finches. Throughout the wet years, small seeds were more common\nand there was such a large supply of the small seeds that the finches rarely ate\nlarge seeds. During the dry years, none of the seeds were in great abundance,\nbut the birds usually ate more large seeds. The change in diet of the finches\naffected the depth of the birdsâ beaks in the future generations.Their beaks\nrange from large and tough to small and smooth. * }}\n","linknr":142,"url":"Directional_selection","recorded":1362483328,"links":29,"instances":["natural_selection","population_genetics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Selection"],"headings":["See also","References","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/84/Selectiontypes-n0_images.png/225px-Selectiontypes-n0_images.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c2/Human_evolution_scheme.svg/43px-Human_evolution_scheme.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["fixation","population_genetics"],["negative_selection","natural_selection"]],"members":["negative_selection","fixation"],"related":["Population_genetics","Natural_selection","Phenotype","Allele_frequency","Recessive","Fixation_(population_genetics)","Balancing_selection","Disruptive_selection","Negative_selection_(natural_selection)","Stabilizing_selection","Peppered_moth_evolution"]}
