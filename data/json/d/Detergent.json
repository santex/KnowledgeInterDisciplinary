{"cursor":"7020","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nA 'detergent' is a surfactant or a mixture of surfactants with \"cleaning\nproperties in dilute solutions.\" These substances are usually\nalkylbenzenesulfonates, a family of compounds that are similar to soap but are\nmore soluble in hard water, because the polar sulfonate (of detergents) is less\nlikely than the polar carboxyl (of soap) to bind to calcium and other ions found\nin hard water. In most household contexts, the term detergent by itself refers\nspecifically to [[laundry detergent]] or [[Dishwashing liquid|dish detergent]],\nas opposed to hand soap or other types of cleaning agents. Detergents are\ncommonly available as powders or concentrated solutions. Detergents, like soaps,\nwork because they are amphiphilic: partly hydrophilic (polar) and partly\nhydrophobic (non-polar). Their dual nature facilitates the mixture of\nhydrophobic compounds (like oil and grease) with water. Because air is not\nhydrophilic, detergents are also foaming agents to varying degrees.\n","linknr":210,"url":"Detergent","recorded":1362512334,"links":43,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Cleaning products","Membrane-active molecules","Cleaning"],"headings":["Chemical classification of detergents","Major applications of detergents","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/34/Diskflaskor.JPG/220px-Diskflaskor.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0b/Soap%26Detergents.png/480px-Soap%26Detergents.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/63/Borax.jpg/220px-Borax.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Surfactant","Soap","Hard_water","Sulfonate","Amphiphilic","Hydrophilic","Hydrophobic","Foaming_agent","Sodium_dodecylbenzenesulfonate","Anions","Bile_acids","Deoxycholic_acid","Quaternary_ammonium","Polyoxyethylene","Glycoside","Polysorbate","Triton_X-100","Octyl-thioglucoside","Maltosides","Zwitterion","CHAPS_detergent","Otto_engine","Fouling","Soap_substitute","Hydrophile","Cleanser","PH","Green_cleaning","Laundry_detergent","Dishwashing_liquid","Hard-surface_cleaner","Cleavable_detergent","Dispersant"]}
