As\nthe structure of local government in England is not uniform, there are currently\nfour principal types of district-level subdivision. There are a total of 326\ndistricts made up of 36 metropolitan boroughs, 32 London boroughs, 201 non-\nmetropolitan districts, 55 unitary authorities, as well as the City of London\nand the Isles of Scilly which are also districts, but do not correspond to any\nof these categories. Some districts are styled as boroughs, cities, or royal\nboroughs; these are purely honorific titles, and do not alter the status of the\ndistrict. All boroughs and cities, and a few districts, are led by a mayor who\nin most cases is a ceremonial figure elected by the district council, but â\nafter local government reform â is occasionally a directly elected mayor who\nmakes most of the policy decisions instead of the council.\n","linknr":332,"url":"Districts_of_England","recorded":1362484592,"links":33,"instances":["county_subdivision","great_britain_and_ireland"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Local government in the United Kingdom","Districts of England","Types of subdivision in the United Kingdom","LAU 1 statistical regions of the European Union"],"headings":["History","Metropolitan boroughs","Non-metropolitan district (shire district)","Unitary authorities","London boroughs","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/84/England_Adminstrative_2010.png/300px-England_Adminstrative_2010.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/be/Flag_of_England.svg/22px-Flag_of_England.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["hundred","county_subdivision"],["urban_district","great_britain_and_ireland"]],"members":["hundred","urban_district"],"related":["England","Metropolitan_and_non-metropolitan_counties_of_England","List_of_English_districts","Local_Government_Act_1972","London_Government_Act_1963","Metropolitan_borough","Non-metropolitan_district","Unitary_authorities_of_England","London_borough","City_status_in_the_United_Kingdom","Royal_borough","Borough_status_in_England_and_Wales","Subdivisions_of_England","Metropolitan_borough","London_borough","Non-metropolitan_district","Unitary_authorities_of_England","City_of_London","Isles_of_Scilly","Borough","City_status_in_the_United_Kingdom","Royal_borough","Mayors_in_England","Local_government_in_the_United_Kingdom","Elected_mayors_in_the_United_Kingdom","Civil_parishes_in_England","Hundred_(county_subdivision)","Poor_Law_Union","English_Poor_Laws","Registration_district","Sanitary_district","Local_Government_Act_1894","Urban_district_(Great_Britain_and_Ireland)","Rural_district","Administrative_county","Metropolitan_borough","County_of_London","London_boroughs","Shire_counties","Metropolitan_borough","Non-metropolitan_district","Greater_London_Council","Greater_London_Authority","Unitary_authorities_in_England","Metropolitan_county","County_council","Shire_county","Council_house","Rutland","Herefordshire","Isle_of_Wight","Berkshire","Cornwall","Durham","Isle_of_Wight","Northumberland","Shropshire","Wiltshire","Greater_London","Greater_London_Council","Greater_London_Authority","List_of_English_districts","List_of_English_districts_by_population","List_of_articles_about_local_government_in_the_United_Kingdom"]}
