{"cursor":"4159","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Doreswamy Iyengar', generally known as 'Mysore V. Doreswamy Iyengar'\n(1920â1997), was a Carnatic musician and one of the greatest exponents of the\nVeena in modern history. Born into a family of musicians, His father,\nVenkatesha Iyengar, was himself a Vainika and a musician in the court of the\nMaharaja of Mysore.\n\nHe started learning the Veena from his father at an early age and soon became\nthe disciple of Veena Venkatagiriyappa, one of the foremost Vainikas of the day\nin Mysore. He performed in the esteemed presence of the then Maharaja of Mysore\nat the age of 12. The Maharaja liked his performance and awarded him a 50 rupee\nsilver coin. The Maharaja also asked Veena Venkatagiriyappa to nurture the boy\nas he thought Doreswamy Iyengar would bring laurels to the state of Mysore.\n\nHe gave his first public performance in 1943, in the Bangalore Gayana Samaja. He\nparticipated in music conferences including the one in Shiraz, Iran in 1969\nwhere he also performed at the Shiraz - Persepolis Festival of Arts. Over the\ncourse of his career, accolades poured in. He was awarded the Padma Vibhushan,\nthe Chowdiah National memorial award, the Sangeetha Kalaratna of the Bangalore\ngayana Samaj, the Sangeetha Kala Shikhamani of the Indian Fine Arts society and\nthe Sangeetha Kalanidhi of the Madras Music academy.\n\nHe studied BA in the Maharaja's College, Mysore. He was the music director of\nthe All India Radio in Bangalore. The University of Mysore conferred on him an\nHonorary Doctorate in 1975.\n\nIn an age when most of the other Vainikas started using the contact microphone,\nDoreswamy Iyengar remained a purist and stuck to the âacousticâ Veena. His style\nof playing is sometimes referred to as the Mysore style. This style is marked by\nthe movements from one note to another, achieved with the playing fingers (the\nindex and middle fingers of the left hand) parted. This, along with his unique\nstyle of plucking the strings enabled him to achieve the continuity of sound so\nessential to Carnatic music.\n\nThe Veena is a solo instrument and is accompanied only by percussion\ninstruments. However, the concerts of Doreswamy Iyengar accompanied by Mysore T\nChowdiah on the violin became very popular. He has participated in many\n'Jugalbandis' including other famous musicians such as Ustad Ali Akbar Khan. He\nalso composed music for dance dramas, especially those of P. T. Narasimhachar or\npu ti na, a renowned Kannada poet.\n\nHis son, D. Balakrishna, who was with Reserve Bank of India is among the\nforemost Vainikas of the day and is the torchbearer of the unique Mysore style\nof playing the veena. Another Vainika of note, who was Doreswamy Iyengarâs\ndisciple, was C. Krishnamurthy.\n\nDoriswamy Iyengar also composed music for a few Kannada films, notably\nSubbashastri, starring Kalyan Kumar.\n","linknr":118,"url":"Doraiswamy_Iyengar","recorded":1375065542,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Doraiswamy_Iyengar&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Doraiswamy_Iyengar&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Doraiswamy_Iyengar&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/Carnatic_music","/wiki/Veena_(instrument)","/wiki/Vainika","/wiki/Maharaja_of_Mysore","/wiki/Veena_(instrument)","/wiki/Veena_Venkatagiriyappa","/wiki/Veena_Venkatagiriyappa","/wiki/Shiraz,_Iran","/wiki/Maharaja%27s_College,_Mysore","/wiki/All_India_Radio","/wiki/Bangalore","/wiki/Microphone","/wiki/Carnatic_music","/wiki/Violin","/wiki/Jugalbandi","/wiki/Ustad","/wiki/Ali_Akbar_Khan","/wiki/P._T._Narasimhachar","/wiki/Kannada","/wiki/Reserve_Bank_of_India","/w/index.php?title=C._Krishnamurthy&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Subbashastri&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Kalyan_Kumar","/w/index.php?title=Doraiswamy_Iyengar&action=edit&section=1","http://www.frontlineonnet.com/fl1423/14230990.htm","http://www.frontlineonnet.com/fl1423/14231000.htm","/w/index.php?title=Doraiswamy_Iyengar&action=edit&section=2","http://www.kannadaaudio.com/Songs/Classical/home/TyagarajaMasterpieces.php","http://www.kamat.com/kalranga/people/iyengars/1078.htm","http://www.sangeethapriya.org/Downloads/vd/vd.html","/wiki/Mp3","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Doraiswamy_Iyengar&oldid=563887884","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1920_births","/wiki/Category:1997_deaths","/wiki/Category:Carnatic_singers","/wiki/Category:Indian_musicians","/wiki/Category:People_from_Mysore","/wiki/Category:University_of_Mysore_alumni","/wiki/Category:Maharaja%27s_College,_Mysore_alumni","/wiki/Category:Carnatic_instrumentalists","/wiki/Category:All_India_Radio_people","/wiki/Category:Articles_lacking_sources_from_February_2007","/wiki/Category:All_articles_lacking_sources","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Doraiswamy+Iyengar&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Doraiswamy+Iyengar","/wiki/Doraiswamy_Iyengar","/wiki/Talk:Doraiswamy_Iyengar","#","/wiki/Doraiswamy_Iyengar","/w/index.php?title=Doraiswamy_Iyengar&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Doraiswamy_Iyengar&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Doraiswamy_Iyengar","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Doraiswamy_Iyengar","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Doraiswamy_Iyengar&oldid=563887884","/w/index.php?title=Doraiswamy_Iyengar&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5297491","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Doraiswamy_Iyengar&id=563887884","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Doraiswamy+Iyengar","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Doraiswamy+Iyengar&oldid=563887884&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Doraiswamy_Iyengar&printable=yes","//kn.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E0%B2%AE%E0%B3%88%E0%B2%B8%E0%B3%82%E0%B2%B0%E0%B3%81_%E0%B2%A6%E0%B3%8A%E0%B2%B0%E0%B3%86%E0%B2%B8%E0%B3%8D%E0%B2%B5%E0%B2%BE%E0%B2%AE%E0%B2%BF_%E0%B2%85%E0%B2%AF%E0%B3%8D%E0%B2%AF%E0%B2%82%E0%B2%97%E0%B2%BE%E0%B2%B0%E0%B3%8D","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5297491#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","
