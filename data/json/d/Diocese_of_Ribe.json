{"cursor":"5776","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"]]\n\nThe former Roman Catholic 'diocese of Ribe' (29 deaneries, 278 parishes)\nconsisted of the modern Danish Provinces of Ribe, Vejle and RingkÃ¸bing, and part\nof Southern Jutland. The first church built at Ribe was founded by Saint Ansgar\nin 860, served by his biographer and successor, Saint Rembert, and destroyed\nduring the heathen reaction after the latter's death in 888. It was rebuilt\ntowards 948, in which year Saint Leofdag, first Bishop of Ribe, was consecrated\nby Archbishop Adaldag of Hamburg, probably at the Council of Ingelheim\n(Germany), which the Jutlandic bishops attended. Leofdag is said to have been\nmartyred by the heathen at Ribe. Until the death of his third known successor\nVale (1044â59) the bishops of Ribe, Schleswig, and Aarhus wandered about Jutland\non missionary tours.\n\nIn 1060, Jutland north of the KongeÃ¥ was divided into the four Dioceses of Ribe,\nAarhus, Viborg and Vestervig (BÃ¸rglum). Originally the diocese was a suffragan\nof the Archdiocese of Hamburg-Bremen until 1104, when the Diocese of Lund,\nelevated to a new archdiocese, became its metropolitan. Bishop Thure (1125â34)\nbegan the construction of the fine Cathedral of Our Lady at Ribe, which was\nfinished under Bishop Elias (1142â66), who founded the chapter in 1145. His\nsuccessor Radulf (1170â71), an Englishman and chancellor to King Valdemar I,\ntranslated to the cathedral the relics of Saint Leofdag, who was never formally\ncanonized. He began the foundation of the Cistercian LÃ¸gum Abbey (LÃ¸gumkloster;\nLocus Dei) in the present LÃ¸gumkloster in Northern Schleswig, which was\ncompleted by his successor Stephen (1173â77), formerly abbot of Herrevad Abbey\n(in Scania). Bishop Omer (1178â1204) reduced the number of the canons of Ribe to\ntwelve. Bishop Christian II (1288â1313) in 1298 greatly enriched the cathedral\nschool, which had been founded in 1145. Bishops Eskil (1388â1409) and Henry\nStangberg (1455â65) published synodal statutes with a view to reforming both\nclergy and laity.\n\nIvar Munk was elected bishop in 1499 but not consecrated till 1513. Although he\nwas unable to prevent Duke Christian from protestantizing Northern Schleswig, he\nkept Lutheranism out of the rest of his diocese. Ivar Munk opposed Christian's\nelection as King Christian III of Denmark in 1533, being however compelled as a\nprivy councillor for Jutland to join that monarch's party, Ivar Munk resigned\nhis bishopric in 1534 in favour of his nephew, Olaf Munk. The bishop's palace at\nRibe was bestowed upon Ivar Munk and there he died in 1539. Like the other\nDanish bishops Olaf Munk was imprisoned on 12 August 1536. When released he had\nto promise to marry as well as to comply with the conditions imposed upon all\nthe Danish bishops. On the fulfilment of his promise the premises and lands of\nthe former Tvis Abbey were bestowed upon him. He was later readmitted to the\nprivy council, and he lived the life of a rich nobleman until his death in 1569.\n\nRibe Cathedral (restored in 1904), a Romanesque building with Gothic additions\nand a tower dating from 1440, contained besides the shrine of Saint Leofdag a\nchapel dedicated to Saint Lambert, which was a great centre for pilgrimages.\nSaint Lambert was the patron of Ribe as well as of LiÃ¨ge in Belgium, and his\ncultus at Ribe is doubtless due to the trading connection between that city and\nthe Low Countries. The abbey church of LÃ¸gum Abbey, the Romanesque churches near\nRibe, like the cathedral built of volcanic stone brought from Andernach on the\nRhine, and the earliest Christian monument in Denmark, the great carved stone\nset up by King Harold Bluetooth near the funeral mounds of his parents, King\nGorm the Old (d. 940) and Queen Thyra Danebod (d. 945) at Jellinge near Veile,\nare all memorials of the Roman Catholic past of the Diocese of Ribe.\n\nThe cathedral chapter consisted of four prelates and twenty-one prebendaries\n(twelve resident). There were eight minor canons and nearly fifty chaplains.\n\nIn the city of Ribe there were also the Benedictine nunnery of St. Nicholas\n(founded before 1215), a Franciscan friary and the Dominican St. Catherine's\nPriory, both dating from 1259, a hospital of the Holy Ghost and a commandery of\nthe Knights of St. John of Jerusalem, both dating from about 1300.\n\nElsewhere in the diocese were the Cistercian monasteries of Tvis Abbey, near\nHolstebro (founded by Prince Buris in 1163), of LÃ¸gum Abbey and of Seem Abbey,\nthe last having been Benedictine till 1171. There were Benedictine nunneries\nat Gudum and at Stubber, a Dominican priory at Vejle and a Franciscan friary\nat Kolding.\n\nIn 1912 there were Catholic churches, schools and hospitals at Esbjerg, Kolding,\nFredericia and Vejle.\n","linknr":151,"url":"Diocese_of_Ribe","recorded":1375076114,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Ancient_Diocese_of_Ribe&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Ancient_Diocese_of_Ribe&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","/wiki/Ancient_Diocese_of_Ribe","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","/w/index.php?title=Diocese_of_Ribe&redirect=no","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Ribe,Denmark,Dom.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5a/Ribe%2CDenmark%2CDom.jpg/250px-Ribe%2CDenmark%2CDom.jpg","/wiki/File:Ribe,Denmark,Dom.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf8/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Ribe_Cathedral","/wiki/Roman_Catholic","/wiki/Ribe","/wiki/Vejle","/wiki/Ringk%C3%B8bing","/wiki/Southern_Jutland","/wiki/Saint_Ansgar","/wiki/Saint_Rembert","/w/index.php?title=Saint_Leofdag&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Adaldag","/wiki/Archdiocese_of_Bremen","/wiki/Council_of_Ingelheim","/wiki/Jutlandic","/wiki/Bishop_of_Schleswig","/wiki/Jutland","/wiki/Konge%C3%A5","/wiki/Diocese_of_Aarhus","/wiki/Diocese_of_Viborg","/wiki/Diocese_of_Vestervig","/wiki/Diocese_of_B%C3%B8rglum","/wiki/Suffragan","/wiki/Hamburg-Bremen","/wiki/Diocese_of_Lund","/wiki/Ribe_Cathedral","/wiki/Valdemar_I","/wiki/Cistercian","/wiki/L%C3%B8gum_Abbey","/wiki/L%C3%B8gumkloster","/wiki/Northern_Schleswig","/wiki/Herrevad_Abbey","/wiki/Scania","/wiki/Cathedral_school","/w/index.php?title=Ivar_Munk&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Lutheranism","/wiki/Christian_III_of_Denmark","/wiki/Privy_councillor","/w/index.php?title=Olaf_Munk&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Tvis_Abbey","/wiki/Ribe_Cathedral","/wiki/Romanesque_architecture","/wiki/Gothic_architecture","/wiki/Lambert_of_Maastricht","/wiki/Li%C3%A8ge","/wiki/Belgium","/wiki/L%C3%B8gum_Abbey","/wiki/Andernach","/wiki/Rhine","/wiki/Harold_Bluetooth","/wiki/Gorm_the_Old","/wiki/Thyra_Danebod","/wiki/Jellinge","/wiki/Cathedral_chapter","/wiki/Rule_of_St._Benedict","/wiki/St._Nicholas%27_Priory,_Ribe","/wiki/Franciscan","/wiki/Dominican_Order","/wiki/St._Catherine%27s_Priory,_Ribe","/wiki/Order_of_the_Holy_Ghost","/wiki/Commandery_(feudalism)","/wiki/Knights_of_St._John_of_Jerusalem","/wiki/Tvis_Abbey","/wiki/Holstebro","/wiki/L%C3%B8gum_Abbey","/w/index.php?title=Seem_Abbey&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Gudum_Priory","/wiki/Stubber_Priory","/wiki/Vejle","/wiki/Kolding","/wiki/Esbjerg","/wiki/Fredericia","/w/index.php?title=Ancient_Diocese_of_Ribe&action=edit&section=1","http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/16070b.htm","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ancient_Diocese_of_Ribe&oldid=554585746","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Pre-Reformation_dioceses_in_Nordic_Europe","/wiki/Category:Roman_Catholic_Church_in_Denmark","/wiki/Category:Dioceses_established_in_the_10th_century","/wiki/Category:948_establishments","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Ancient+Diocese+of+Ribe&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Ancient+Diocese+of+Ribe","/wiki/Ancient_Diocese_of_Ribe","/w/index.php?title=Talk:Ancient_Diocese_of_Ribe&action=edit&redlink=1","#","/wiki/Ancient_Diocese_of_Ribe","/w/index.php?title=Ancient_Diocese_of_Ribe&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Ancient_Diocese_of_Ribe&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Ancient_Diocese_of_Ribe","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Ancient_Diocese_of_Ribe","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Ancient_Diocese_of_Ribe&oldid=554585746","/w/index.php?title=Ancient_Diocese_of_Ribe&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3618601","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Ancient_Diocese_of_Ribe&id=554585746","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book
