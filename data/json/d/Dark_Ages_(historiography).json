From Cycle of Famous Men and\nWomen, Andrea di Bartolo di Bargilla, c. 1450]] The 'Dark Ages' is a historical\nperiod used for the first part of the Middle Ages. The term emphasizes the\ncultural and economic deterioration that supposedly\noccurred in Europe following the decline of the Roman Empire. [http://www.merriam-\nwebster.com/dictionary/dark%20age \"Dark age\"] in Merriam-Webster The label\nemploys traditional light-versus-darkness imagery to contrast the \"darkness\" of\nthe period with earlier and later periods of \"light\".\nThe period is characterized by a relative scarcity of historical and other\nwritten records at least for some areas of Europe, rendering it obscure to\nhistorians. The term \"Dark Age\" itself derives from the Latin [[saeculum\nobscurum]], originally applied by Caesar Baronius in 1602 to a tumultuous period\nin the 10th and 11th centuries. Dwyer, John C., Church history: twenty\ncenturies of Catholic Christianity, (1998) p. 155. Baronius, Caesar.\n[[Annales Ecclesiastici]], Vol. X. Roma, 1602, p. 647\n\nOriginally the term characterized the bulk of the Middle Ages, or roughly the\n6th to 13th centuries, as a period of intellectual darkness between\nextinguishing the \"light of Rome\" after the end of Late Antiquity, and the rise\nof the Italian Renaissance in the 14th century. Petrarca, De sui ipsius et\nmultorum ignorantia, ed. M. Capelli (Paris, 1906), p. 45.  This definition is still found in popular usage, , for example.\nFranklin is a mathematician who is discussing popularly-held misconceptions\nabout mathematics and science, such as that \"Galileo revolutionised physics by\ndropping weights from the Leaning Tower of Pisa.\" From his perspective as a\nmathematician, he says that the Dark Ages were sometimes very real, citing\nIsadore of Seville's writing that a cylinder was 'a square figure with a\nsemicircle on top'. but increased recognition of the accomplishments of\nthe Middle Ages has led to the label being restricted in application. Since the\n20th century, it is frequently applied to the earlier part of the era, the Early\nMiddle Ages (c. 5thâ10th century). Ker, W. P. (1904).\n[http://books.google.com/books?id=4XxzlEQPwMIC The dark ages]. New York: C.\nScribner's Sons. Page 1. (cf. The Dark Ages and the Middle Ages â or the Middle\nAge â used to be the same; two names for the same period. But they have come to\nbe distinguished, and the Dark Ages are now no more than the first part of the\nMiddle Age, while the term mediaeval is often restricted to the later centuries,\nabout 1100 to 1500, the age of chivalry, the time between the first Crusade and\nthe Renaissance. This was not the old view, and it does not agree with the\nproper meaning of the name.) Syed Ziaur Rahman, Were the âDark Agesâ\nReally Dark?, Grey Matter (The Co-curricular Journal of Jawaharlal Nehru Medical\nCollege), Aligarh Muslim University, Aligarh, 2003: 7-10 However, many\nmodern scholars who study the era tend to avoid the term altogether for its\nnegative connotations, finding it misleading and inaccurate for any part of the\nMiddle Ages. . In explaining his approach to writing the work, Snyder refers\nto the \"so-called Dark Ages\", noting that \"Historians and archaeologists have\nnever liked the label Dark Ages ... there are numerous indicators that these\ncenturies were neither \"dark\" nor \"barbarous\" in comparison with other\neras.\" Jordan, Chester William (2004).

Same volume, Freedman, Paul, \"Medieval\nStudies\", pp. 383â389. \"The stereotype of the Middle Ages as 'the\nDark Ages' fostered by Renaissance humanists and Enlightenment philosophes has,\nof course, long since been abandoned by scholars.\"\n\nThe concept of a Dark Age originated with the Italian scholar Petrarch\n(Francesco Petrarca) in the 1330s, and was originally intended as a sweeping\ncriticism of the character of Late Latin literature. Petrarch regarded the post-Roman centuries as \"dark\"\ncompared to the light of classical antiquity. Later historians expanded the term\nto refer to the transitional period between Roman times and the High Middle Ages\n(c. 11thâ13th century), including the lack of Latin literature, and a lack of\ncontemporary written history, general demographic decline, limited building\nactivity and material cultural achievements in general. Later historians and\nwriters picked up the concept, and popular culture has further expanded on it as\na vehicle to depict the Middle Ages as a time of backwardness, extending its\npejorative use and expanding its scope.\n","linknr":587,"url":"Dark_Ages_(historiography)","recorded":1362685558,"links":55,"instances":["historian","architecture","historian"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Middle
