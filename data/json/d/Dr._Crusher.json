She was a regular character in the show for all but the second of its\nseven seasons.\n\nCrusher is the chief medical officer on board the USS ''Enterprise''-D and its\nsuccessor, the USS ''Enterprise''-E. Crusher holds the rank of Commander, and\nwas the head of Starfleet Medical during 2365. She has one son, Wesley, with her\nlate husband, Jack Crusher.\n\nCrusher is often depicted as intelligent, compassionate, caring, and strong\nwilled; she is occasionally portrayed as defiant, occasionally siding with\ncharacters who seem to play the role of underdog and often plays devil's\nadvocate in the senior staff meetings.\n\nDuring the second season, actress Gates McFadden was replaced by Diana Muldaur,\nwho played Chief Medical Officer Dr. Katherine Pulaski. On the show, Crusher's\nabsence was attributed to her being promoted to head of Starfleet Medical.\nMcFadden returned to the role of Crusher in season 3, allegedly due to a lack of\nchemistry between Muldaur and the rest of the cast.\n","linknr":415,"url":"Dr._Crusher","recorded":1362534896,"links":37,"instances":["star_trek"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Star Trek","Star Trek film characters","Starfleet officers","Fictional military personnel","Fictional commanders","Fictional medical personnel","Fictional doctors","Fictional surgeons","Fictional actors","Fictional directors","Fictional writers","Fictional dancers","Starfleet doctors","Starfleet commanders","Fictional characters introduced in 1987"],"headings":["Casting","Character information","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fb/BeverlyCrusher.jpg/250px-BeverlyCrusher.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Wikiquote-logo-en.svg/40px-Wikiquote-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Symbol_book_class2.svg/16px-Symbol_book_class2.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg/16px-Portal-puzzle.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/People_icon.svg/16px-People_icon.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["uss_enterprise","ncc-1701-d"],["uss_enterprise","ncc-1701-e"],["commander","star_trek"],["uss_enterprise","ncc-1701-d"],["uss_enterprise","ncc-1701-e"],["commander","star_trek"]],"members":["commander","uss_enterprise"],"related":["Human","Female","Moon","United_Federation_of_Planets","Starfleet","USS_Enterprise_(NCC-1701-D)","Starfleet_Medical","USS_Enterprise_(NCC-1701-E)","Commander_(Star_Trek)","Jack_Crusher","Wesley_Crusher","Gates_McFadden","Gates_McFadden","Chief_medical_officer","USS_Enterprise_(NCC-1701-D)","USS_Enterprise_(NCC-1701-E)","Commander_(Star_Trek)","Starfleet_Medical","Wesley_Crusher","Jack_Crusher","Devil's_advocate","Diana_Muldaur","Katherine_Pulaski","La_Jolla_Playhouse","Diana_Muldaur","Patrick_Stewart","The_moon","Scottish-Americans","Starfleet_Academy","Medical_school","Jack_Crusher","Jean-Luc_Picard","Wesley_Crusher","Poker","William_Riker","Deanna_Troi","The_Naked_Now","Attached","All_Good_Things...","Starfleet_Medical"]}
