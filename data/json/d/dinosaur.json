They first appeared during the\n  Triassic period, approximately 237&nbsp;million years ago, and were the\n  dominant terrestrial vertebrates for 135&nbsp;million years, from the\n  beginning of the Jurassic (about 201&nbsp;million years ago) until the end of\n  the Cretaceous (66&nbsp;million years ago), when the Cretaceous–Paleogene\n  extinction event led to the extinction of most dinosaur groups at the close of\n  the Mesozoic Era. The fossil record indicates that birds evolved from theropod\n  dinosaurs during the Jurassic Period and, consequently, they are considered a\n  subgroup of dinosaurs by many paleontologists.<ref name=AF02/> Some birds\n  survived the extinction event that occurred 66 million years ago, and their\n  descendants continue the dinosaur lineage to the present day.<ref\n  name=\"Holtz2008\"/>\n\nDinosaurs are a varied group of animals from taxonomic, morphological and\necological standpoints. Birds, at over 10,000 living species,<ref></ref> are the\nmost diverse group of vertebrates besides perciform fish.<ref\nname=Alfaroetal2009/> Using fossil evidence, paleontologists have identified\nover 500 distinct genera<ref name=Wang&Dodson/> and more than 1,000 different\nspecies of non-avian dinosaurs.<ref name=AmosBBC/> Dinosaurs are represented on\nevery continent by both extant species and fossil remains.<ref name=MacLeod/>\nSome are herbivorous, others carnivorous. While dinosaurs were ancestrally\nbipedal, many extinct groups included quadrupedal species, and some were able to\nshift between these stances. Elaborate display structures such as horns or\ncrests are common to all dinosaur groups, and some extinct groups developed\nskeletal modifications such as bony armor and spines. Evidence suggests that egg\nlaying and nest building are additional traits shared by all dinosaurs. While\nmodern birds are generally small due to the constraints of flight, many\nprehistoric dinosaurs were large-bodied—the largest sauropod dinosaurs may have\nachieved lengths of 58 meters (190 feet) and heights of 9.25 meters (30 feet 4\ninches).<ref name=KC06/> Still, the idea that non-avian dinosaurs were uniformly\ngigantic is a misconception based on preservation bias, as large, sturdy bones\nare more likely to last until they are fossilized. Many dinosaurs were quite\nsmall: [[Xixianykus]], for example, was only about 50&nbsp;cm (20&nbsp;in) long.\n\nAlthough the word dinosaur means \"terrible lizard\", the name is somewhat\nmisleading, as dinosaurs are not lizards. Instead, they represent a separate\ngroup of reptiles which, like many extinct forms, did not exhibit\ncharacteristics traditionally seen as reptilian, such as a sprawling limb\nposture or ectothermy. Additionally, many prehistoric animals, including\nmosasaurs, ichthyosaurs, pterosaurs, plesiosaurs, and [[Dimetrodon]], are\npopularly conceived of as dinosaurs, but are not classified as dinosaurs.\nThrough the first half of the 20th century, before birds were recognized to be\ndinosaurs, most of the scientific community believed dinosaurs to have been\nsluggish and cold-blooded. Most research conducted since the 1970s, however, has\nindicated that all dinosaurs were active animals with elevated metabolisms and\nnumerous adaptations for social interaction.\n\nSince the first dinosaur fossils were recognized in the early 19th century,\nmounted fossil dinosaur skeletons have been major attractions at museums around\nthe world, and dinosaurs have become an enduring part of world culture. The\nlarge sizes of some groups, as well as their seemingly monstrous and fantastic\nnature, have ensured dinosaurs' regular appearance in best-selling books and\nfilms, such as [[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]. Persistent public\nenthusiasm for the animals has resulted in significant funding for dinosaur\nscience, and new discoveries are regularly covered by the media.\n",
