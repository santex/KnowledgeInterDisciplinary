In addition to\nbeing a catecholamine and a monoamine, dopamine may be classified as a\nsubstituted phenethylamine. Its name derives from its chemical structure, which\nconsists of an amine group (NH 2) linked to a catechol structure,\ncalled dihydroxyphenethylamine, the decarboxylated form of\ndihydroxyphenylalanine (acronym DOPA). In the brain, dopamine functions as a\nneurotransmitterâa chemical released by nerve cells to send signals to other\nnerve cells. The human brain uses five known types of dopamine receptors,\nlabeled D 1, D 2, D 3, D 4, and\nD 5. Dopamine is produced in several areas of the brain, including the\nsubstantia nigra and the ventral tegmental area.\n\nDopamine plays a major role in the brain system that is responsible for reward-\ndriven learning. Every type of reward that has been studied increases the level\nof dopamine transmission in the brain, and a variety of highly addictive drugs,\nincluding stimulants such as cocaine and methamphetamine, act directly on the\ndopamine system. Personality traits such as extraversion and reward\nseeking have been linked to higher sensitivity to rewarding stimuli of the\nmesolimbic dopamine system. Depue, R. A., & Collins, P. F. (1999).\n[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11301519 Neurobiology of the structure of\npersonality: Dopamine, facilitation of incentive motivation, and extraversion.]\nBehavioral and Brain Sciences, 22, 491â517. http://citation.allacadem-\nic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/1/1/1/9/0/pages111906/p111906-\n11.php\n\nSeveral important diseases of the nervous system are associated with\ndysfunctions of the dopamine system. Parkinson's disease, an age-related\ndegenerative condition causing tremor and motor impairment, is caused by loss of\ndopamine-secreting neurons in the substantia nigra. Schizophrenia has been shown\nto involve elevated levels of dopamine activity in the mesolimbic pathway and\ndecreased levels of dopamine in the prefrontal cortex.

American Journal of Psychiatry\n148:1474â1486. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15118803] Goldman-\nRakic, P.S,. Castner, S.A., Svensson, T.H., Siever, L.J., Williams, G.V.,\n(2004). Targeting the dopamine D1 receptor in schizophrenia: insights for\ncognitive dysfunction. Psychopharmacology,174: 3â16 Attention deficit\nhyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and restless legs syndrome (RLS) are also believed to\nbe associated with decreased dopamine activity.\n\nDopamine is available as an intravenous medication acting on the sympathetic\nnervous system, producing effects such as increased heart rate and blood\npressure. However, because dopamine cannot cross the bloodâbrain barrier,\ndopamine given as a drug does not directly affect the central nervous system.\nTo increase the amount of dopamine in the brains of patients with diseases\nsuch as Parkinson's disease and dopa-responsive dystonia, L-DOPA (the\nprecursor of dopamine) is often given because it crosses the bloodâbrain\nbarrier relatively easily.\n","linknr":2274,"url":"Dopamine","recorded":1362511052,"links":94,"instances":["biochemistry","mood","circulatory","molecular","molecule","alga","chemical_process","biology","biochemistry","biology","psychology","neuroscience","medical","biology"],"pdf":["http://movementdisorders.org/education/onlinecme/levodopa/print.pdf","http://edrv.endojournals.org/cgi/reprint/22/6/724.pdf","http://edrv.endojournals.org/cgi/reprint/22/6/724.pdf","http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=MImg&_imagekey=B6T0P-4NTB97R-Y-1&_cdi=4868&_user=308069&_orig=search&_coverDate=09%2F30%2F2007&_sk=999079998&view=c&wchp=dGLbVzz-zSkzV&md5=c49d721e7e713190c2ac6fab7a491093&ie=/sdarticle.pdf","http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=MImg&_imagekey=B6T0P-4NTB97R-Y-1&_cdi=4868&_user=308069&_orig=search&_coverDate=09%2F30%2F2007&_sk=999079998&view=c&wchp=dGLbVzz-zSkzV&md5=c49d721e7e713190c2ac6fab7a491093&ie=/sdarticle.pdf","http://dept.wofford.edu/neuroscience/NeuroSeminar/pdfSpring2006/a7.pdf","http://dept.wofford.edu/neuroscience/NeuroSeminar/pdfSpring2006/a7.pdf","http://www.jneurosci.org/content/13/3/900.full.pdf"],"categories":["Catecholamines","Hormones
