Like other MUDs, it was an online realm\nthat allowed people to interact in real time by connecting to a central\nserver, assuming a virtual identity within that realm, \"teleporting\" (in other\nwords, transporting your character) or \"walking\" to virtual rooms, and holding\ntext-based conversations with everyone else who had entered the same virtual\nroom. The MOO server kept track of which characters were in each virtual\n\"room,\" so that the comments of each character would be sent back to the\ncomputers of every other person whose character was \"in\" the same virtual\n\"room.\" What distinguished Diversity University from other MOOs was its\ncentral structuring metaphor as a virtual university campus, as well as its\npioneering use for actual online classes.\n","linknr":507,"url":"Diversity_University","recorded":1362539623,"links":13,"instances":["computing"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Distance education","Educational MUDs","MU* games","Online chat","Social networking services","Virtual reality communities"],"headings":["History and Purpose of Diversity University","Structure of Diversity University","Sample Educational Projects","Educational Tools in the MOO","Closing","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["keyboard","computing"]],"members":["keyboard"],"related":["MOO","Cross-platform","Educational_MUD","Multiplayer","Online","Telnet","MUD_client","Internet","Keyboard_(computing)","MOO","MUD","Embry-Riddle_Aeronautical_University","Marshall_University","MUVE","Second_Life","Susquehanna_University","University_of_Wyoming","LISTSERV","Divine_Comedy","The_Waste_Land","T._S._Eliot","Moby-Dick","Constructivist_teaching_methods","West_Virginia_Northern_Community_College","Microscope_slide","Learning_management_system","MUVE","Web_conferencing","Object-oriented_programming","Social_network_service","Network_effect","Web_2.0","New_York_Newsday","Network_Solutions"]}
