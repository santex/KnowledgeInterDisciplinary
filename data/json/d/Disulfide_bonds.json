{"cursor":"24210","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In chemistry, a 'disulfide bond' (Br.E. 'disulphide bond') is a covalent bond,\nusually derived by the coupling of two thiol groups. The linkage is also called\nan 'SS-bond' or 'disulfide bridge'. The overall connectivity is therefore R-S-S-\nR. The terminology is widely used in biochemistry. In formal terms, the\nconnection is a persulfide, in analogy to its congener, peroxide (R-O-O-R), but\nthis terminology is obscure and is no longer used (except in reference to R-S-S-\nH or H-S-S-H compounds).\n","linknr":545,"url":"Disulfide_bonds","recorded":1362572755,"links":45,"instances":["chemistry","chemistry"],"pdf":["http://www.interchim.fr/ft/2/242214.pdf"],"categories":["Organic disulfides|","Protein structure","Posttranslational modification","Sulfur"],"headings":["Properties","Preparation and reactions","Occurrence in proteins","In industry","Related compounds","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/82/Disulfide-bond.png/500px-Disulfide-bond.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/Equilibrium.svg/15px-Equilibrium.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/Equilibrium.svg/15px-Equilibrium.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/ba/Thiol_disulfide_exchange.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8c/Disulfide_Bridges_%28SCHEMATIC%29_V.1.svg/150px-Disulfide_Bridges_%28SCHEMATIC%29_V.1.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/22/Cystine-skeletal.png/150px-Cystine-skeletal.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/5/5/055540ef38d7b8827a8db9bda0557602.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/2/e/3/2e3f9e7751ca07debed581e5725f71db.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/6/4/1/641ccf587e113767fc97bf4ae304ae15.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["congener","chemistry"],["vicinal","chemistry"]],"members":["vicinal","congener"],"related":["Chemistry","Covalent_bond","Thiol","Functional_group","Congener_(chemistry)","Organic_peroxide","Bond_dissociation_energy","C-C_bond","C-H_bond","Polarizability","Electrophile","Nucleophile","Dihedral_angle","Diphenyl_disulfide","Dimethyl_disulfide","Hydrogenation","Ferrodoxin","Oxidation","Thiol","Hydrogen_peroxide","Sulfenic_acid","Iodine","Metal_complex","Thiol-disulfide_exchange","Alkylation","Polysulfide","Sodium_polysulfide","Organic_synthesis","Phthalimide","Mercaptoethanol","Dithiothreitol","TCEP","Interchim","Sodium_borohydride","Chemical_reaction","Thiol","Sulfur","Atom","PKa","Protein","Thiol","Cysteine","Glutathione","Dithiothreitol","Thioredoxin","Vicinal_(chemistry)","Organic_reaction","Sulfenyl_halide","Bromine","Chlorine","Reducing_environment","Cytosol","Cysteine","Thiol","Cysteine","Methionine","Ribonuclease_A","Cystine","Cysteine","Dihedral_angle","Loop_entropy","Hydrophobic_core","Hydrophobic_interaction","Hydrogen_bond","Secondary_structure","Thiol-disulfide_exchange","Thioredoxin","Ribonuclease_A","2-mercaptoethanol","Dithiothreitol","TCEP","Bacteria","Oxidation","Hydrogen_peroxide","Hydrogen","Oxygen","DNA","Bacteria","Eukaryote","Rough_endoplasmic_reticulum","Cytosol","Endoplasmic_reticulum","Glutathione","Vaccinia","Protamine","Sperm","Chromatin","Mammal","Gliotoxin","Chloroplasts","Ferredoxin_thioredoxin_system","Photosystem_I","Calvin-Benson_cycle","Starch","Adenosine_triphosphate","Hair","Keratin","Feather","Permanent_wave","Ammonium_thioglycolate","Vulcanization","Rubber","Rheology","Thiosulfoxide","Peroxide","Diselenide_bond","Thioperoxides","Sulfoxide","Thiuram_disulfide","Thiocarbonyl"]}
