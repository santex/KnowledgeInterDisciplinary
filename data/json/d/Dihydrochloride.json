{"cursor":"2050","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In chemistry, 'hydrochlorides' are salts resulting, or regarded as resulting,\nfrom the reaction of hydrochloric acid with an organic base (mostly amines). An\narchaic alternative name for \"hydrochloride\" is 'muriate', derived from\nhydrochloric acid's ancient name: muriatic acid.\n\nFor example, reaction of pyridine (C 5H 5N) with\nhydrochloric acid (HCl) yields pyridine hydrochloride\n(C 5H 5NÂ·HCl). Even though this style of formula is often\nused for denoting the hydrochlorides, the dot incorrectly implies that the two\nmolecules are weakly bonded together; rather, what is present is the salt C 5H 5NH + Cl -\n with the correct chemical name pyridinium chloride.\n\nHydrochloric salts are most often referred to by using the name of the base,\nthen simply tagging on 'hydrochloride' or 'HCl'. For example, while crack\ncocaine is the freebase of cocaine, the salt form is often referred to as\ncocaine HCl.\n","linknr":100,"url":"Dihydrochloride","recorded":1362511114,"links":19,"instances":["chemistry","chemistry","chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Organochlorides","Salts"],"headings":["Uses","See also","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["salt","chemistry"],["base","chemistry"],["free_base","chemistry"],["free_base","chemistry"]],"members":["base","salt","free_base"],"related":["Salt_(chemistry)","Hydrochloric_acid","Base_(chemistry)","Amine","Pyridine","Pyridinium","Crack_cocaine","Free_base_(chemistry)","Cocaine","Amine","Solubility","Free_base_(chemistry)","Quaternary_ammonium_cation"]}
