{"cursor":"4528","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Physiological tolerance' or 'drug tolerance' is commonly encountered in\npharmacology, when a subject's reaction to a specific drug and concentration of\nthe drug is progressively reduced, requiring an increase in concentration to\nachieve the desired effect. Drug tolerance can involve both\npsychological drug tolerance and physiological factors. Characteristics of drug\ntolerance: it is reversible, the rate depends on the particular drug, dosage and\nfrequency of use, differential development occurs for different effects of the\nsame drug. Physiological tolerance also occurs when an organism builds up a\nresistance to the effects of a substance after repeated exposure. This can occur\nwith environmental substances, such as salt or pesticides. A rapid drug\ntolerance is termed tachyphylaxis.\n","linknr":215,"url":"Drug_tolerance","recorded":1362538114,"links":28,"instances":["medicine"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Pharmacodynamics","Drug addiction"],"headings":["Tachyphylaxis","Mechanisms","Morphine as an Example","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/FlattenedRoundPills.jpg/40px-FlattenedRoundPills.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["desensitization","medicine"]],"members":["desensitization"],"related":["Pharmacology","Psychological_drug_tolerance","Physiological_tolerance","Tachyphylaxis","Phosphorylation","G-proteins","Cyclic_adenosine_monophosphate","Cholecystokinin","Proglumide","Beta-arrestin-2","G_protein-coupled_receptor","Îœ-opioid_receptor","Digital_object_identifier","PMID","Desensitization_(medicine)","Sensitization","Physical_dependence","Mithridatization","Reverse_tolerance","Cross-tolerance","Drug_resistance","Tachyphylaxis","Multidrug_resistance"]}
