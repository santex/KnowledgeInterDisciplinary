They are typically used in agriculture, agronomy, and\ncommodity markets to measure grain, dried beans, and dried and fresh fruit (e.g.\na peck of apples is a retail unit); formerly also salt pork and fish. They are\nalso used in fishing for clams, crabs, etc. and formerly for many other\nsubstances (e.g. coal, cement, lime) which were typically shipped and delivered\nin a standardized container such as a barrel.\n\nThey are often confused or conflated with units of mass, assuming a nominal\ndensity, and indeed many units nominally of dry measure have become standardized\nas units of mass (see bushel).\n",
