He furthered his studies at the Gregorian\nPontificial University in Rome where he did his Licence in Theology (Dogmatics).\nHe also studied the Holy Scriptures at Pontificio Istituto Bibblico in Rome\nwhere he did his licence in the Holy Scripture. He returned to Malta in 1954 and\nwas given the responsibility of teaching young Capuchin students.\n\nBetween 1958 and 1967 he was parish priest of the Holy Trinity Church in Marsa.\nThroughout those years he was instrumental in the construction of the parochial\ncentre St. Pius X. Between 1983 and 1991, again he was asked to serve as a\nparish priest of [http://schoolnet.gov.mt/sangwannparish/history.html Our Lady\nof Lourdes] in San Gwann. Throughout the years he served in San Gwann, he again\nfelt the need to gather the lay movements under one roof. Thus, the parochial\ncentre San Guzepp came to be. He found time also to restore the\n[http://www.vol.net.mt/sangwannpc/margaretinfo.htm Sta.

The main achievement of this Society was the\npublication of the Holy Bible in Maltese. The translation commenced in 1966 and\ncontinued until it was published in 1984. Since then, the Bible was revised yet\nagain, taking another five years. Hence, the second edition was published in\n1996. As the teaching and interpretation of the Bible were and still are his\nlife's mission, he was instrumental in opening Dar il-Bibbja in Floriana as a\nBible Centre.\n\nFr. Donat Spiteri is also the author of a numerous amount of\n[http://www.frdonatspiteri.com/publications.html books] of theological and\nbiblical themes, of which il-Ktieb tas-Salmi (Book of Psalms), Dizzjunarju\nBibbliku (Bible Dictionary), Temi Teologici (Theological Themes), l-Evangelji\nta' San Mattew u San Luqa (The Gospels of St. Matthew and St. Luke), il-Ktieb\nta' l-Atti ta' l-Appostli (The Book of the Acts of the Apostles) and many\nothers are being published by the Malta Bible Society. He also was a regular\ncontributor in articles to the local press and various religious magazines such\nas Dawl Frangiskan, besides lecturing and explaining the Holy Bible on the\nlocal media. He also toured various parishes in Malta and Gozo where he gave\nBiblical courses.\n\nIn 1974 Fr. Donat felt the need to spread further Bible reading into the Maltese\nhouseholds. Thus, he launched the small booklet Kliem il-Hajja (the Word of\nLife) which has become synonymous with him. This booklet is issued every quarter\nand helps and simplifies the daily reading of the Bible. He was the editor since\nits origin and today is the Director General. Today, this booklet finds its way\nin many homes throughout Malta and Gozo - and also amongst our Maltese emigrants\nabroad.
