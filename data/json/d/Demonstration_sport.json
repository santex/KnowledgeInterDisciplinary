{"cursor":"10859","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'demonstration sport' is a sport which is played to promote it, most commonly\nduring the Olympic Games, but also at other sporting events.\n\nDemonstration sports were officially introduced in 1912 Summer Olympics, when\nSweden decided to include glima, traditional Icelandic wrestling, in the Olympic\nprogram, but with its medals not counting as official. Most organizing\ncommittees then decided to include at least one demonstration sport at each\nedition of the Games, usually some typical or very popular sport in the host\ncountry, like baseball at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympic Games and taekwondo at\nthe 1988 Seoul Olympic Games. From 1912 to 1992, only two editions of the Summer\nOlympics did not have demonstration sports on their program. Some demonstration\nsports eventually gained enough popularity to become an official sport in a\nsubsequent edition of the Games. Traditionally, the medals awarded for the\ndemonstration events followed the same design as the Olympic medals, but of a\nsmaller size. These medals are never included in the medal count.\n\nDemonstration sports were suspended after the 1992 Summer Olympics, as the\nOlympic program grew bigger and it became more difficult for the organizing\ncommittees to give them the appropriate attention, since the IOC required the\nsame treatment to be dispensed for official and demonstration sports. http:-\n//www.olympic.org/uk/games/past/innovations_uk.asp?OLGT=2&OLGY=1992 It is\nunlikely that they will be reintroduced as a requirement for future Olympic\norganizing committees. However, the Beijing Olympic Committee received\npermission from the IOC to run a wushu competition parallel to the 2008 Beijing\nOlympic Games, Wushu Tournament Beijing 2008. http://www.newsgd.com/culture-\n/culturenews/200510140032.htm http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2005-\n10/16/content_3621265.htm {{cite web\n|url=http://en.beijing2008.cn/news/official/preparation/n214506999.shtml\n|title=Wushu Tournament Beijing 2008 to begin August 21 |publisher=Beijing 2008\nOlympic Games |date=2008-08-05}}\n\nSince the 1984 Summer Olympics, two Paralympic events (a men's and a women's\nwheelchair racing event) have been included in the athletics (track and field)\nprogramme of each Games. These events are considered by many as a demonstration\nsport, but are, in fact, used to promote the Paralympic Games. Disabled events\nin alpine and Nordic skiing (1988 only) were also held as demonstration sports\nat the 1984 and 1988 Winter Olympics.\n","linknr":271,"url":"Demonstration_sport","recorded":1374761545,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Demonstration_sport&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Demonstration_sport&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Olympic_Games","/wiki/1912_Summer_Olympics","/wiki/Sweden","/wiki/Glima","/wiki/Baseball","/wiki/1984_Summer_Olympics","/wiki/Taekwondo","/wiki/1988_Summer_Olympics","/wiki/1992_Summer_Olympics","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Wushu_(sport)","/wiki/2008_Summer_Olympics","/wiki/Wushu_Tournament_Beijing_2008","#cite_note-2","#cite_note-3","#cite_note-4","/wiki/1984_Summer_Olympics","/wiki/Paralympic","/wiki/Wheelchair_racing","/wiki/Athletics_(track_and_field)","/wiki/Paralympic_Games","/wiki/Paralympic_alpine_skiing","/wiki/Paralympic_cross-country_skiing","/wiki/Disabled_skiing_at_the_1984_Winter_Olympics","/wiki/Disabled_skiing_at_the_1988_Winter_Olympics","/wiki/Winter_Olympics","#Summer_Olympics","#Winter_Olympics","#See_also","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Demonstration_sport&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games","/wiki/1900_Summer_Olympics","#uno","/wiki/Angling","/wiki/Hot_air_ballooning","/wiki/Boules","/wiki/Cannon_shooting","/wiki/Fire_fighting","/wiki/Kite_flying","/wiki/Jeu_de_paume","/wiki/Lifesaving","/wiki/Longue_paume","/wiki/Motorsport","/wiki/Pigeon_racing","/wiki/Water_motorsports","/wiki/1904_Summer_Olympics","#uno","/wiki/Basketball","/wiki/American_football","/wiki/Gaelic_football","/wiki/Hurling","/wiki/Motor_cycling","/wiki/1908_Summer_Olympics","#uno","/wiki/Cycle_polo","/wiki/1912_Summer_Olympics","/wiki/Baseball","/wiki/Glima","#bei","/wiki/1920_Summer_Olympics","/wiki/Korfball","/wiki/1924_Summer_Olympics","/wiki/Basque_pelota","/wiki/La_canne","/wiki/Canoeing","/wiki/Kayaking","/wiki/Savate","/wiki/Volleyball","/wiki/1928_Summer_Olympics","/wiki/Frisian_handball","/wiki/Korfball","/wiki/Lacrosse","/wiki/1932_Summer_Olympics","/wiki/American_football","/wiki/Lacrosse","/wiki/1936_Summer_Olympics","/wiki/Baseball","/wiki/Gliding","/wiki/1948_Summer_Olympics","/wiki/Lacrosse","/wiki/Pehr_Henrik_Ling","/wiki/Gymnastics","/wiki/1952_Summer_Olympics","/wiki/Pes%C3%A4pallo","/wiki/Team_handball","/wiki/1956_Summer_Olympics","/wiki/Australian_football_at_the_1956_Summer_Olympics","/wiki/Baseball","/wiki/1960_Summer_Olympics","/wiki/1964_Summer_Olympics","/wiki/Baseball","/wiki/Bud%C5%8D","/wiki/1968_Summer_Olympics","/wiki/Basque_pelota","/wiki/Tennis","#ten","/wiki/1972_Summer_Olympics","/wiki/Badminton","/wiki/Water_skiing","/wiki/1976_Summer_Olympics","/wiki/1980_Summer_Olympics","/wiki/1984_Summer_Olympics","/wiki/Baseball","/wiki/Tennis","/wiki/1988_Summer_Olympics","/wiki/Badminton","/wiki/Baseball","/wiki/Bowling","/wiki/Judo","/wiki/Taekwondo","/wiki/1992_Summer_Olympics","/wiki/Basque_pelota","/wiki/Roller_hockey_(Quad)","/wiki/Taekwondo","/wiki/1996_Summer_Olympics","/wiki/2000_Summer_Olympics","/wiki/2004_Summer_Olympics","/wiki/2008_Summer_Olympics","#ten","/wiki/2012_Summer_Olympics","#cite_note-5","/wiki/Wushu_(sport)","/w/index.php?title=Demonstration_sport&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Winter_Olympic_Games","/wiki/1924_Winter_Olympics","/wiki/Military_patrol_at_the_1928_Winter_Olympics","/wiki/1928_Winter_Olympics","/wiki/Military_patrol_at_the_1928_Winter_Olympics","/wiki/Skijoring","/wiki/1932_Winter_Olympics","/wiki/Curling_at_the_1932_Winter_Olympics","/wiki/Sled_dog_race_at_the_1932_Winter_Olympics","/wiki/Speed_skating_at_the_1932_Winter_Olympics","#cur","/wiki/1936_Winter_Olympics","/wiki/Military_patrol_at_the_1936_Winter_Olympics","/wiki/Ice_stock_sport","/wiki/1948_Winter_Olympics","/wiki/Military_patrol_at_the_1948_Winter_Olympics","/wiki/Winter_pentathlon_at_the_1948_Winter_Olympics","/wiki/1952_Winter_Olympics","/wiki/Bandy_at_the_1952_Winter_Olympics","/wiki/1956_Winter_Olympics","/wiki/1960_Winter_Olympics","/wiki/1964_Winter_Olympics","/wiki/Ice_stock_sport","/wiki/1968_Winter_Olympics","/wiki/1972_Winter_Olympics","/wiki/1976_Winter_Olympics","/wiki/1980_Winter_Olympics","/wiki/1984_Winter_Olympics","/wiki/Disabled_skiing_at_the_1984_Winter_Olympics","/wiki/1988_Winter_Olympics","/wiki/Curling_at_the_1988_Winter_Olympics","/wiki/Freestyle_skiing_
