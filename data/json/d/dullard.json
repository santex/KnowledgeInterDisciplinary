Archaically the\nword mome has also been used. The similar terms moron, imbecile, and cretin have\nall gained specialized meanings in modern times. An idiot is said to be\n'idiotic', and to suffer from 'idiocy'. A dunce is an idiot who is specifically\nincapable of learning. An idiot differs from a fool (who is unwise) and an\nignoramus (who is uneducated/an ignorant), neither of which refers to someone\nwith low intelligence.\n",
