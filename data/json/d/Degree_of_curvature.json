The usual distance in US road work is 100 ft (30.48 m) of\narc. Davis, Foote, and Kelly. Surveying Theory and Practice, 1966 US\nrailroad work traditionally used 100 ft of chord and this may be used in\nother places for road work. Other lengths may be used—such as 100 metres\nwhere SI is favoured, or a shorter length for sharper curves.\n\nSince rail routes have very large radii, they are laid out in chords, as the\ndifference to the arc is inconsequential and this made work easier before\nelectronic calculators.\n\nThe is called a station, used to define length along a road or other alignment,\nannotated as stations plus feet 1+00, 2+00 etc. Metric work may use similar\nnotation, such as kilometers plus meters 1+000.\n","linknr":208,"url":"Degree_of_curvature","recorded":1362565399,"links":15,"instances":["angle","geometry","geometry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Surveying","Transport engineering"],"headings":["See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/07/Suspension_bridge_pattern_german1.svg/60px-Suspension_bridge_pattern_german1.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["degree","angle"],["arc","geometry"],["chord","geometry"]],"members":["degree","chord","arc"],"related":["Curvature","Civil_engineering","Surveying","Degree_(angle)","Arc_(geometry)","Chord_(geometry)","SI","Curve","Highway_engineering","Lateral_motion_device","Minimum_railway_curve_radius","Railway_systems_engineering","Track_transition_curve","Transition_curve"]}
