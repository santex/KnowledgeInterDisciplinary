It emerged from New York, Philadelphia,\nChicago, Baltimore, Newark, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Washington D.C and areas of\ngreater Los Angeles, including El Monte and Compton. Built upon vocal harmony,\ndoo-wop was one of the most mainstream, pop-oriented R&B styles of the time.\nSinger Bill Kenny is often noted as the father of Doo-wop for his introduction\nof the \"top & bottom\" format used by most Doo-wop groups. This format features a\nhigh tenor lead with a \"talking bass\" in the song's middle.\n\nAs a musical genre, doo-wop features vocal group harmony with the musical\nqualities of many vocal parts, nonsense syllables, a simple beat, sometimes\nlittle or no instrumentation, and simple music and lyrics. It is ensemble single\nartists appearing with a backing group. Solo billing usually implies an\nindividual is more prominent in the musical arrangement. Hoffmann, F.
