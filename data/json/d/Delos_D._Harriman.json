{"cursor":"4465","size":14,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Delos David Harriman', known as \"D.D. Harriman,\" is a character in the fiction\nof noted science fiction author Robert A. Heinlein. He is an entrepreneurial\nbusinessman who masterminded the first landing on the Moon as a private business\nventure. His story is part of Heinlein's Future History.\n\nHarriman's first appearance in print was in the story Requiem which described\nhis death while pursuing his dream of landing on the Moon himself. Having opened\nspace to humankind he was, like Moses, denied the sight of his promised land by\na combination of health and legal issues. At the end of his life, Harriman\ndecides to clandestinely arrange to go to the Moon himself. Harriman meets two\nspacemen, Captain James (Mac) McIntyre and Engineer Charles (Charlie) Cummings,\nwho are down on their luck and giving rocketship rides at county fairs. He\nsecretly hires them and pays to have an old orbital ship purchased and upgraded\nfor a flight to the Moon. To finance this, he liquidates his financial holdings\nwithout explanation. His actions cause his nieces and nephews to take him to\ncourt for a competency hearing. Harriman fails to show up for the hearing and\njoins the two spacemen as they prepare the ship at a secret desert location. A\ndeputy marshal locates them, but is knocked out by Charlie Cummings. As he comes\nto he sees them making a hurried departure in the modified ship. The spacemen\ngive the old man his last wish. He barely survives the trip, and dies shortly\nafter landing. Charlie buries Harriman's space-suited body on the surface of the\nMoon and scrawls his epitaph on the tag from an oxygen bottle. It is Robert\nLouis Stevenson's \"Requiem\", which is inscribed on his own headstone in Samoa.\n\nUnder the wide and starry sky,  Dig the grave and let me lie:  Glad did\nI live and gladly die,  And I laid me down with a will!  This be the\nverse you grave for me:  Here he lies where he longed to be;  Home is\nthe sailor, home from sea,  And the hunter home from the hill.\n\nCharlie and Mac then abandon the ship and begin the thirty-mile trip to\nLuna City.\n\nIn the later publication, The Man Who Sold the Moon, Harriman is in his prime.\nDetermined to carry out his vision of a private-venture rocket to the Moon, he\nbuys, bullies, finagles, and deceives anyone who stands in his way. His\npartners, who respect his successes if not his methods, think of him as the last\nof the old robber barons, or perhaps the first of the new ones. At the end of\nthat story, published later than its sequel, he is left behind as the first\ncolonization team leaves for the Moon.\n\nHarriman is long married, but his marriage takes second place to his business.\nWhen raising money for his venture, he warns Mrs. Harriman that they may close\ndown their extensive underground apartments (built for safety during the so-\ncalled \"Crazy Years\") and live only in the above ground parts of the house. He\nalso warns her that she may have to relearn the art of running a house without\nservants.","linknr":83,"url":"Delos_D._Harriman","recorded":1375083422,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Delos_D._Harriman&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Delos_D._Harriman&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Science_fiction","/wiki/Robert_A._Heinlein","/wiki/Entrepreneur","/wiki/Moon","/wiki/Future_History","/wiki/Requiem_(short_story)","/wiki/Moses","/wiki/Pressure_suit","/wiki/Robert_Louis_Stevenson","/wiki/The_Man_Who_Sold_the_Moon","/wiki/Robber_baron","/wiki/To_Sail_Beyond_the_Sunset","/wiki/Maureen_Johnson_(Heinlein_character)","/wiki/Lazarus_Long","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Delos_D._Harriman&oldid=534215560","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Robert_A._Heinlein_characters","/wiki/Category:Characters_in_written_science_fiction","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Delos+D.+Harriman&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Delos+D.+Harriman","/wiki/Delos_D._Harriman","/wiki/Talk:Delos_D._Harriman","#","/wiki/Delos_D._Harriman","/w/index.php?title=Delos_D._Harriman&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Delos_D._Harriman&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Delos_D._Harriman","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Delos_D._Harriman","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Delos_D._Harriman&oldid=534215560","/w/index.php?title=Delos_D._Harriman&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5254358","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Delos_D._Harriman&id=534215560","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Delos+D.+Harriman","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Delos+D.+Harriman&oldid=534215560&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Delos_D._Harriman&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5254358#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delos_D._Harriman","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":["heinlein_character","short_story"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Robert A.
