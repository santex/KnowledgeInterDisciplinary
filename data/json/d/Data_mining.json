{"cursor":"60113","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Data mining' (the advanced analysis step of the \"Knowledge Discovery in\nDatabases\" process, or KDD), an interdisciplinary subfield\nof computer science, is the computational process of discovering patterns in\nlarge data sets involving methods at the intersection of artificial\nintelligence, machine learning, statistics, and database systems. The overall goal of the data mining process is to extract information from a\ndata set and transform it into an understandable structure for further use. Aside from the raw analysis step, it involves database and data\nmanagement aspects, data preprocessing, model and inference considerations,\ninterestingness metrics, complexity considerations, post-processing of\ndiscovered structures, visualization, and online updating.\n\nThe term is a buzzword, and is frequently misused to mean any form of large-\nscale data or information processing (collection, extraction, warehousing,\nanalysis, and statistics) but is also generalized to any kind of computer\ndecision support system, including artificial intelligence, machine learning,\nand business intelligence. In the proper use of the word, the key term is\n[[Discovery (observation)|discovery]], commonly defined as \"detecting something\nnew\". Even the popular book \"Data mining: Practical machine learning tools and\ntechniques with Java\" (which covers mostly machine\nlearning material) was originally to be named just \"Practical machine learning\",\nand the term \"data mining\" was only added for marketing reasons. }}\nOften the more general terms \"(large scale) data analysis\", or \"analytics\" â or\nwhen referring to actual methods, artificial intelligence and machine learning â\nare more appropriate.\n\nThe actual data mining task is the automatic or semi-automatic analysis of\nlarge quantities of data to extract previously unknown interesting patterns\nsuch as groups of data records (cluster analysis), unusual records (anomaly\ndetection) and dependencies (association rule mining). This usually involves\nusing database techniques such as spatial indices. These patterns can then be\nseen as a kind of summary of the input data, and may be used in further\nanalysis or, for example, in machine learning and predictive analytics. For\nexample, the data mining step might identify multiple groups in the data, which\ncan then be used to obtain more accurate prediction results by a decision\nsupport system. Neither the data collection, data preparation, nor result\ninterpretation and reporting are part of the data mining step, but do belong to\nthe overall KDD process as additional steps.\n\nThe related terms [[data dredging]], data fishing, and data snooping refer to\nthe use of data mining methods to sample parts of a larger population data set\nthat are (or may be) too small for reliable statistical inferences to be made\nabout the validity of any patterns discovered. These methods can, however, be\nused in creating new hypotheses to test against the larger data populations.\n","linknr":893,"url":"Data_mining","recorded":1362505159,"links":81,"instances":["code_name","programming_language","programming_language","software","programming_language","electrical","machine_learning","statistics"],"pdf":["http://www.kdnuggets.com/gpspubs/aimag-kdd-overview-1996-Fayyad.pdf","http://www.kdnuggets.com/gpspubs/aimag-kdd-overview-1996-Fayyad.pdf","http://cdn.intechopen.com/pdfs/5937/InTech-A_data_mining_amp_knowledge_discovery_process_model.pdf","http://www.iadis.net/dl/final_uploads/200812P033.pdf","http://rtm.science.unitn.it/~battiti/archive/bcemo.pdf","http://rtm.science.unitn.it/~battiti/archive/bcemo.pdf","http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~tgd/publications/kdd2000-dlft.pdf","http://dml.cs.byu.edu/~cgc/docs/atdm/W11/BCPNN-ADR.pdf","http://www.csl.sony.fr/downloads/papers/2001/pachet01c.pdf","http://grid.deis.unical.it/papers/pdf/CACM2003.pdf","http://grid.deis.unical.it/papers/pdf/CACM2003.pdf","http://grid.deis.unical.it/papers/pdf/CACM2010.pdf","http://grid.deis.unical.it/papers/pdf/CACM2010.pdf","http://www.amstat.org/committees/ethics/linksdir/Jsm2005Seltzer.pdf","http://www.amstat.org/committees/ethics/linksdir/Jsm2005Seltzer.pdf","http://www.nascio.org/publications/documents/NASCIO-dataMining.pdf"],"categories":["Data
