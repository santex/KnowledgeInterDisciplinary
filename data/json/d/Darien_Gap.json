It measures just over long and about wide. Roadbuilding through this\narea is expensive, and the environmental toll is steep. Political consensus in\nfavor of road construction has not emerged. Consequently there is no road\nconnection through the DariÃ©n Gap connecting North/Central America with South\nAmerica and it is the missing link of the Pan-American Highway.\n\nThe geography of the DariÃ©n Gap on the Colombian side is dominated primarily by\nthe river delta of the Atrato River, which creates a flat marshland at least\nwide, half of this being swampland. The Panamanian side, in sharp contrast, is a\nmountainous rain forest, with terrain reaching from in the valley floors to at\nthe tallest peaks (Cerro Tacarcuna).\n","linknr":323,"url":"Darien_Gap","recorded":1362674080,"links":34,"instances":["people"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Landforms of Panama","Landforms of Colombia","Darién Province"],"headings":["Pan-American Highway","People","Natural resources","Crossing the Darién Gap","Armed conflict and kidnappings","See also","References","External links","({{NoMoreLinks}})",""],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/Regi%C3%B3n_Dari%C3%A9n.png/200px-Regi%C3%B3n_Dari%C3%A9n.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c4/Panama_Embera0607.jpg/170px-Panama_Embera0607.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/PanAmericanHwy.png/220px-PanAmericanHwy.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Revolutionary_Armed_Forces_of_Colombia_%28FARC%29_insurgents.GIF/220px-Revolutionary_Armed_Forces_of_Colombia_%28FARC%29_insurgents.GIF","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["kuna","people"],["kuna","people"]],"members":["kuna"],"related":["Panama","Darién_Province","Central_America","Colombia","South_America","Pan-American_Highway","River_delta","Atrato_River","Marsh","Swamp","Rain_forest","Cerro_Tacarcuna","Turbo,_Colombia","Yaviza","United_States","United_Nations","Foot_and_mouth_disease","Embera-Wounaan","Kuna_(people)","Darién_Province","Embera-Wounaan","Kuna_(people)","Cueva_people","Pirogue","La_Palma,_Panama","Yaviza","El_Real","Corn","Mandioca","Plantains","Bananas","Darién_National_Park","Los_Katíos_National_Park","Mahogany","Smithsonian_Institution","Land_Rover","Jeep","Special_Air_Service","UK","Terence_John_Whitfield","Australia","Chepo,_Panama","Quibdó","Colombia","Alaska","Argentina","Range_Rover","John_Blashford-Snell","British_Army","John_Blashford-Snell","Russell_Braddon","Ian_Hibell","Cape_Horn","Alaska","CJ-5_Jeep","Crucera_Express","Sebastian_Snow","Wade_Davis","Tierra_Del_Fuego","Costa_Rica","George_Meegan","Goliath_Expedition","Bering_Strait","Karl_Bushby","Arthur_Blessitt","Bay_of_San_Miguel","Gulf_of_Parita","San_Blas_Islands","Kuna_Yala","Turia_River","La_Palma,_Darién","Yaviza","Embera-Wounaan","Raleigh_International","The_News_&_Observer","Darien_scheme","Vasco_Núñez_de_Balboa","Pat_Farmer","Ultra-marathon","Sportsperson","Revolutionary_Armed_Forces_of_Colombia","Tom_Hart_Dyke","Orchid_hunters","New_Tribes_Mission","Robert_Young_Pelton","National_Geographic_Adventure_Magazine","United_Self-Defense_Forces_of_Colombia","Lionel_Wafer","Gulf_of_Darién","Darién_scheme"]}
