{"cursor":"21419","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":":\"Dihydrogen monoxide\" redirects here. For the H 2O molecule, see\n:[[Properties of water]].\n\n atoms and one oxygen atom.]]\n\nThe 'dihydrogen monoxide' hoax involves calling water by an unfamiliar name,\n\"dihydrogen monoxide\", followed by a listing of real effects of this chemical,\noften presented as an argument that this substance should be regulated, labeled\nas hazardous, or banned. The hoax is intended to illustrate how the lack of\nscientific literacy and an exaggerated analysis can lead to misplaced\nfears. . \"Dihydrogen monoxide\", shortened to \"DHMO\", is a\nname for water that is consistent with basic rules of chemical\nnomenclature,  but is not among the names published by IUPAC and is almost\nexclusively used in humorous context.\n\nA popular version of the hoax was created by Eric Lechner, Lars Norpchen and\nMatthew Kaufman, housemates while attending University of California, Santa Cruz\nin 1990,  revised by Craig Jackson (also a UC Santa Cruz student) in\n1994, . and brought to widespread public attention\nin 1997 when Nathan Zohner, a 14-year-old student, gathered petitions to ban\n\"DHMO\" as the basis of his science project, titled \"How Gullible Are We?\". [http://www.snopes.com/science/dhmo.asp Dihydrogen Monoxide] from\nUrban Legends Reference Pages, Retrieved 2006-09-25.\n\n\"Dihydrogen monoxide\" may sound dangerous to those with a limited knowledge of\nchemistry or who hold to an ideal of a \"chemical-free\" life (chemophobia). The only familiar common usage of the term \"monoxide\" is in the\nhighly toxic gas \"carbon monoxide\", and the simplified term \"monoxide poisoning\"\nis commonly used to refer to poisoning by this colorless and odorless\nsubstance.\n\nThe joke has been frequently extended over the years. For example, a material\nsafety data sheetâa list of information about potentially dangerous materials\nused in research and industryâhas been created for it.\n","linknr":373,"url":"Dihydrogen_monoxide_hoax","recorded":1362372261,"links":46,"instances":["computing"],"pdf":["http://old.iupac.org/publications/books/principles/principles_of_nomenclature.pdf","http://old.iupac.org/publications/books/principles/principles_of_nomenclature.pdf","http://old.iupac.org/publications/books/principles/principles_of_nomenclature.pdf","http://old.iupac.org/publications/books/principles/principles_of_nomenclature.pdf","http://www.iupac.org/reports/provisional/abstract04/RB-prs310804/Chap1-3.04.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20110726171925/http://old.iupac.org/publications/books/principles/principles_of_nomenclature.pdf","http://www.iupac.org/publications/books/principles/principles_of_nomenclature.pdf","http://www.oehha.ca.gov/air/chronic_rels/pdf/7783064.pdf","http://www.oehha.ca.gov/air/chronic_rels/pdf/7783064.pdf","http://www.iupac.org/publications/books/principles/principles_of_nomenclature.pdf","http://www.matthew.at/dhm.pdf","http://img.scoop.co.nz/media/pdfs/0709/DeanDHMO.pdf","http://img.scoop.co.nz/media/pdfs/0709/DeanDHMO.pdf"],"categories":["Hoaxes in science","Professional humor","Water and society","20th-century hoaxes","21st-century hoaxes"],"headings":["Original Internet appearance","Terminology","Public efforts involving DHMO","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/Water_molecule_%281%29.svg/220px-Water_molecule_%281%29.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/ac/DMRDlogo.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/92/Danger_sign_hydrogen.jpg/220px-Danger_sign_hydrogen.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["mirror","computing"]],"members":["mirror"],"related":["Oxygen","Hoax","Scientific_literacy","International_Union_of_Pure_and_Applied_Chemistry","University_of_California,_Santa_Cruz","Urban_Legends_Reference_Pages","Chemical_free","Chemophobia","Carbon_monoxide","Carbon_monoxide_poisoning","Material_safety_data_sheet","Hydroxyl","Acid","Acid_rain","Greenhouse_effect","Scalding","Drowning","Erosion","Corrosion","Rust","Tumor","Cancer","Solvent","Nuclear_power","Polystyrene","Fire_retardant","Animal_research","Pesticide","Junk_food","Mirror_(computing)","The_Internet_Archive","Molecule","Chemical_formula","Molecule","Hydrogen","Atom","Oxygen","Oxide","Alkali","IUPAC_nomenclature_of_inorganic_chemistry","Covalent_bond","Hydrogen_sulfide","Lithium_oxide","IUPAC_nomenclature_of_inorganic_chemistry","Carbon_suboxide","Dicarbon_monoxide","Hydrogen_peroxide","University_of_California,_Santa_Cruz","Dan_Curtis_Johnson","Idaho_Falls,_Idaho","Science_fair","James_K._Glassman","United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency","National_Institutes_of_Health","April_Fools'_Day","Australian_Parliament","New_Zealand_Green_Party","Sue_Kedgley","Member_of_Parliament","Neal_Boortz","Penn_&_Teller","Kris_McGaha","Aliso_Viejo,_California","City_council","MSNBC","Louisville,_Kentucky","Louisville_Waterfront_Park","Louisville_Courier-Journal","Chemical_&_Engineering_News","10_Downing_Street","Jacqui_Dean","Jim_Anderton","Finnish_parliamentary_election,_2011","Voting_advice_application","Chemical_nomenclature","Parody_science","Sense_and_reference","Water_intoxication"]}
