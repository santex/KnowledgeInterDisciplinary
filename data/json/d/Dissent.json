{"cursor":"2804","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":":This article is about a philosophy of non-agreement. For other meanings see\n[[Dissent (disambiguation)]]. arguing that dissent is necessary for democracy.]]\n\n'Dissent' is a sentiment or philosophy of non-agreement or opposition to a\nprevailing idea (e.g. a government's policies) or an entity (e.g. an individual\nor political party which supports such policies). The term's antonyms include\n[[Wikt:agreement|agreement]], [[consensus]] (when all or nearly all parties\nagree on something) and [[consent]] (when one party agrees to a proposition made\nby another).\n\nIn some political systems, dissent may be formally expressed by way of\nopposition politics, while politically repressive regimes may prohibit any form\nof dissent, leading to suppression of dissent and the encouragement of social or\npolitical activism. Individuals who do not conform or support the policies of\ncertain states have been described as \"dissidents.\" Several thinkers have argued\nthat a healthy society needs not only to protect, but also to encourage\ndissent.

XV\n\nIn a well-known letter to Arnold Ruge, Karl Marx wrote: \"if constructing the\nfuture and settling everything for all times are not our affair, it is all the\nmore clear what we have to accomplish at present: I am referring to ruthless\ncriticism of all that exists, ruthless both in the sense of not being afraid of\nthe results it arrives at and in the sense of being just as little afraid of\nconflict with the powers that be.\" Marx to Ruge.
