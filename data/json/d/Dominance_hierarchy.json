In social living groups, members are\nlikely to compete for access to limited resources and mating opportunities.\nRather than fight each time they meet, relative relationships are formed between\nmembers of the same sex. These repetitive interactions lead to the creation of a\nsocial order that is subject to change each time a dominant animal is challenged\nby a subordinate one.\n","linknr":461,"url":"Dominance_hierarchy","recorded":1362669683,"links":24,"instances":["ethology","animal","trait","psychology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Ethology","Testosterone"],"headings":["Systems","Determining the outcome of conflict","Dominance","Subordinance","Interpersonal Complementarity","Mechanisms that regulate the formation of hierarchies in animals","Brood Hierarchy","Hormones and Dominance","Dominance hierarchies in eusocial insects","Regulatory mechanisms in eusocial organisms","Female dominance in mammals","Dominance in Birds","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6a/Social_order_continuum.png/220px-Social_order_continuum.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/Weeper_Capuchin_01.JPG/220px-Weeper_Capuchin_01.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/Wikipedia_project_hormone.png/220px-Wikipedia_project_hormone.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["observer_effect","psychology"],["territory","animal"],["intelligence","trait"],["dominance","ethology"]],"members":["dominance","territory","intelligence","observer_effect"],"related":["Social_animal","Mating","Dominance","Sexual_conflict","Pecking_order","Spotted_hyena","Brown_hyena","Meerkat","Gray_wolf","Gorilla","Lycaon_pictus","Agonistic_behavior","Game_theory","Common_shrew","White-crowned_sparrow","Rhesus_monkey","Canada_goose","Baboons","Bonnet_macaque","Rhesus_monkeys","Dwarf_mongoose","Chacma_baboon","Dark-eyed_junco","Oystercatcher","Great_tits","Pied_flycatcher","Baboon","Testosterone","Red_fox","Burying_beetles","Flat_lizard","Baboon","Brown_hyena","Toque_monkey","Brown_hyena","Lycaon_pictus","Round-robin_tournament","Audience_effect","Observer_effect_(psychology)","Food","Mating","Social_status","Reproductive_success","Offspring","Territory_(animal)","Ethology","Ageing","Gender","Intelligence_(trait)","Aggressiveness","Eusocial","Blue-footed_Booby","Hormone","Hibernation","Polistes_dominulus","Juvenile_hormone","Corpora_allata","20-hydroxyecdysone","Ecdysone","Oocytes","Polistes_dominulus","Ovaries","Fertile","Heterocephalus_glaber","Lutenizing_hormone","Testosterone","Ovarian_cycle","Virility","Pheromones","Aggressiveness","Glucocorticoids","Stress_hormones","Adrenal_glands","Fight_or_flight_response","Subdominant","Energy","Glycogen","Cortisol","Metabolism","Stress_hormones","Olive_baboons","Kenya","Immunosuppression","Appetite","Osteoporosis","Insect_societies","Kin_selection","Ants","Termites","Bees","Wasps","Naked_mole_rat","Haplodiploidy","Ovary","Nuptial_flights","Bumblebee","Paper_wasp","Stereotypy","Ponerinae","Insect_cuticle","Sclerite","Honey_bee","Hyena","Lemur","Bonobo","Social_dominance_orientation","Dunnock","Dominance_(ethology)","Sociobiology","Social_organization","Hypergamy","Hierarchical_organization","Evolution_of_intelligence","Pecking_order","William_Golding","Yann_Martel"]}
