Fluids such as wind and water, as well as\nsediment flowing via gravity, transport previously eroded sediment, which, at\nthe loss of enough kinetic energy in the fluid, is deposited, building up layers\nof sediment.\n\nDeposition occurs when the forces responsible for sediment transportation are no\nlonger sufficient to overcome the forces of particle weight and friction,\ncreating a resistance to motion, this is known as the null-point hypothesis.\nDeposition can also refer to the buildup of sediment from organically derived\nmatter or chemical processes. For example, chalk is made up partly of the\nmicroscopic calcium carbonate skeletons of marine plankton, the deposition of\nwhich has induced chemical processes (diagenesis) to deposit further calcium\ncarbonate. Similarly, the formation of coal begins with deposition of organic\nmaterial, mainly from plants, in anaerobic conditions.\n","linknr":268,"url":"Deposition_(geology)","recorded":1362371937,"links":32,"instances":["geology","environmental","sediment"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Geological processes","Sedimentology"],"headings":["Null-point hypothesis","References","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3d/Deposition_erosion.jpg/220px-Deposition_erosion.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/76/Null_point_theory_image1.png/220px-Null_point_theory_image1.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/3/7/0/370a137d0f46b26b79bdf5f1c33efda9.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/Akaroa_Harbour_jpeg.png/220px-Akaroa_Harbour_jpeg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["transportation","sediment"],["hypoxia","environmental"],["cementation","geology"]],"members":["cementation","hypoxia","transportation"],"related":["Geology","Sediments","Soil","Rocks","Landform","Sediment","Gravity","Transportation_(sediment)","Erosion","Kinetic_energy","Weight","Friction","Organic_matter","Chemical_process","Chalk","Calcium_carbonate","Plankton","Diagenesis","Coal","Hypoxia_(environmental)","Sediment","Akaroa","The_Wash","Bohai_Bay","Earth's_gravity","Reynolds_number","Stokes_Law","Phi","Stokes'_law","Electrolyte","Flocculation","Sieve","Pipette","Bohai_Bay","Jiangsu","The_Wash","Chenier","Dynamic_equilibrium","Beach_nourishment","Coastal_management","Littoral","Cementation_(geology)","Cross-bedding","Overbank","Sedimentary_rock","Sedimentary_structures","Longshore_drift","Shields_parameter","Stokes'_law","Settling","Flocculation"]}
