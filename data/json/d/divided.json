Specifically, if b times c equals a, written: :a = b\n× c where b is not zero, then a divided by b equals c, written: :a ÷ b = c\nFor instance,\n:6 ÷ 3 = 2\nsince\n:3 x 2 = 6\n\nIn the expression a ÷ b = c, a is called the 'dividend' or 'numerator', b the\n'divisor' or 'denominator' and the result c is called the '[[quotient]]'.\n\nConceptually, division describes two distinct but related settings. Partitioning\ninvolves taking a set of size a and forming b groups that are equal in size. The\nsize of each group formed, c, is the quotient of a and b. Quotative division\ninvolves taking a set of size a and forming groups of size c. The number of\ngroups of this size that can be formed, b, is the quotient of a and\nc.<ref>Fosnot and Dolk 2001. Young Mathematicians at Work: Constructing\nMultiplication and Division. Portsmouth, NH: Heinemann.</ref>\n\nTeaching division usually leads to the concept of fractions being introduced\nto students. Unlike addition, subtraction, and multiplication, the set of\nall integers is not closed under division. Dividing two integers may result\nin a remainder. To complete the division of the remainder, the number system\nis extended to include fractions or rational numbers as they are more\ngenerally called.\n","title":"Division%20%28mathematics%29","headings":["Notation","Computing","Algorithm","Of integers","Of rational numbers","Of real numbers","By zero","Of complex numbers","Of polynomials","Of matrices","In abstract algebra","Calculus","See also","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["3: Multiplication","3: Rational_number","2: Integer","2: Programming_language","2: Calculator","2: Decimal_fraction","2: Euclidean_algorithm","2: Real_number","2: Complex_number","2: Quaternion","1: Mathematics","1: Elementary_arithmetic","1: Addition","1: Subtraction","1: Remainder","1: Number_system","1: ASCII","1: Obelus","1: ISO_80000-2","1: English_language","1: William_Oughtred","1: Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz","1: Ratio","1: Michael_Stifel","1: Multiplication_tables","1: Short_division","1: Long_division","1: Abacus","1: Logarithm_tables","1: Slide_rule","1: Division_algorithm","1: Modular_arithmetic","1: Modular_multiplicative_inverse","1: Uniqueness_quantification","1: Absolute_value","1: Partial_function","1: Mixed_number","1: Numerical_computation","1: Greatest_common_divisor","1: Computer_program","1: MATLAB","1: Computer_algebra_system","1: Extended_real_number_line","1: Modulo_operation","1: Divisibility_rule","1: Zero","1: Polynomial","1: Euclidean_division_of_polynomials","1: Polynomial_long_division","1: Synthetic_division","1: Inverse_matrix","1: Matrix_multiplication","1: Commutative","1: Left_division","1: Mooreâ€“Penrose_pseudoinverse","1: Abstract_algebra","1: Multiplicative_inverse","1: Integral_domain","1: Pigeonhole_principle","1: Division_algebra","1: Bott_periodicity","1: Normed_division_algebra","1: Isomorphic","1: Octonion","1: Derivative","1: Quotient_rule","1: Integral","1: Rod_calculus#Division","1: Division_by_two","1: Galley_division","1: Inverse_element","1: Order_of_operations","1: Quasigroup","1: Repeating_decimal"]}
