The subsequent lack of insulin leads to increased blood and\nurine glucose. The classical symptoms are polyuria (frequent urination),\npolydipsia (increased thirst), polyphagia (increased hunger), and weight\nloss.\n\nIncidence varies from 8 to 17 per 100,000 in Northern Europe and the U.S. with a\nhigh of about 35 per 100,000 in Scandinavia to a low of 1 per 100,000 in Japan\nand China.\n\nEventually, type 1 diabetes is fatal unless treated with insulin. Injection\nis the most common method of administering insulin although other methods are\ninsulin pumps and inhaled insulin. Other alternatives are Pancreatic transplants\nthat have been used and also pancreatic islet cell transplantation.\nTransplantation is experimental yet growing.\n\nMost people who develop type 1 are otherwise healthy. Although\nthe cause of type 1 diabetes is still not fully understood, it is believed\nto be of immunological origin.\n\nType 1 can be distinguished from type 2 diabetes via a C-peptide\nassay, which measures endogenous insulin production.\n\nType 1 treatment must be continued indefinitely in all cases. Treatment should\nnot significantly impair normal activities but can be done adequately if\nsufficient patient training, awareness, appropriate care, discipline in testing\nand dosing of insulin is taken. However, treatment remains quite burdensome for\nmany people. Complications may be associated with both low blood sugar and high\nblood sugar, both largely due to the nonphysiological manner in which insulin is\nreplaced. Low blood sugar may lead to seizures or episodes of unconsciousness,\nand requires emergency treatment. High blood sugar may lead to increased fatigue\nand can also result in long-term damage to organs.\n","linknr":1177,"url":"Diabetes_mellitus_type_1","recorded":1362482025,"links":60,"instances":["mood","immunology"],"pdf":["http://www.idea.library.drexel.edu/bitstream/1860/2806/1/Markowitz_Jessica.pdf","http://www.idea.library.drexel.edu/bitstream/1860/2806/1/Markowitz_Jessica.pdf","http://www.who.int/diabetes/publications/Definition%20and%20diagnosis%20of%20diabetes_new.pdf","http://www.who.int/diabetes/publications/Definition%20and%20diagnosis%20of%20diabetes_new.pdf","http://whqlibdoc.who.int/hq/1999/WHO_NCD_NCS_99.2.pdf","http://whqlibdoc.who.int/hq/1999/WHO_NCD_NCS_99.2.pdf","http://ww2.ispad.org/pdf/clin-2.pdf","http://www.tianhecell.com/uploads/TranslationalRes.pdf","http://www.tianhecell.com/uploads/TranslationalRes.pdf","http://www.tianhecell.com/uploads/BMCMedicine.pdf","http://www.tianhecell.com/uploads/BMCMedicine.pdf","http://www.tianhecell.com/uploads/CurrentDiabetesReports.pdf","http://www.tianhecell.com/uploads/CurrentDiabetesReports.pdf","http://www.tianhecell.com/uploads/AutoimmunityReviewsT1D.pdf","http://www.tianhecell.com/uploads/AutoimmunityReviewsT1D.pdf","http://www.omicsonline.org/2155-6156/2155-6156-1-104.pdf","http://www.omicsonline.org/2155-6156/2155-6156-1-104.pdf","http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/14/11/1109.1.full.pdf","http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/14/11/1109.1.full.pdf"],"categories":["Diabetes","Autoimmune
