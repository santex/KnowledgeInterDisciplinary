The key elements of an amino acid\nare carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen, though other elements are found in\nthe side-chains of certain amino acids. About 500 amino acids are\nknown and can be classified in many ways. Structurally they can be\nclassified according to the functional groups' locations as alpha- (Î±-), beta-\n(Î²-), gamma- (Î³-) or delta- (Î´-) amino acids; other categories relate to\npolarity, pH level, and side chain group type (aliphatic, acyclic, aromatic,\ncontaining hydroxyl or sulphur, et al.). In the form of proteins, amino acids\ncomprise the second largest component (after water) of human muscles, cells and\nother tissues.

They\nare known as '2-, alpha-,' or 'Î±-amino acids' (generic formula\nH 2NCHRCOOH in most cases Proline is an exception to this\ngeneral formula. It lacks the NH 2 group because of the cyclization\nof the side-chain and is known as an imino acid; it falls under the category\nof special structured amino acids. where R is an organic substituent\nknown as a \"side-\nchain\"); [http://www.chemguide.co.uk/organicprops/aminoacids/background.-\nhtml â INTRODUCING AMINO ACIDS] often the term \"amino acid\" is used to\nrefer specifically to these. They include the 23 proteinogenic (\"protein-\nbuilding\") amino acids which combine into peptide chains (\"polypeptides\") to\nform the building blocks of a vast array of proteins.\nThese are all L-stereoisomers (\"left-handed\" isomers) although a few D-amino\nacids (\"right-handed\") occur in bacterial envelopes and some\nantibiotics. \"Biochemical pathways: an atlas of biochemistry and\nmolecular biology\" â Michal, p.5 20 of the 23 proteinogenic\namino acids are encoded directly by triplet codons in the genetic code and\nare known as \"standard\" amino acids. The other three (\"non-standard\" or \"non-\ncanonical\") are pyrrolysine (found in methanogenic organisms and other\neukaryotes), selenocysteine (present in many noneukaryotes as well as most\neukaryotes), and N-Formylmethionine. For example, 25 human proteins include\nselenocysteine (Sec) in their primary structure, Kryukov GV, Castellano\nS, Novoselov SV, Lobanov AV, Zehtab O, Guigo R, et al. Characterization of\nmammalian selenoproteomes. Science. 2003;300:1439â1443. and the\nstructurally characterized enzymes (selenoenzymes) employ Sec as the\ncatalytic moiety in their active sites.

Atta-Ur-Rahman & others,\np.299 CodonâtRNA\ncombinations not found in nature can also be used to \"expand\" the genetic\ncode and create novel proteins known as alloproteins incorporating non-\nproteinogenic amino acids.\n\nMany important proteinogenic and non-proteinogenic amino acids also play\ncritical non-protein roles within the body. For example: in the human brain,\nglutamate (standard glutamic acid) and gamma-amino-butyric acid (\"GABA\", non-\nstandard gamma-amino acid) are respectively the main excitatory and inhibitory\nneurotransmitters; hydroxyproline (a major\ncomponent of the connective tissue collagen) is synthesised from proline; the\nstandard amino acid glycine is used to synthesise porphyrins used in red blood\ncells; and the non-standard carnitine is used in lipid transport.\n\n9 of the 20 standard amino acids are called \"essential\" for humans because they\ncannot be created from other compounds by the human body, and so must be taken\nin as food. Others may be conditionally essential for certain ages or medical\nconditions. Essential amino acids may also differ between species. For\nexample, ruminants such as cows obtain a number of amino acids via microbes in\nthe first two stomach chambers.\n\nBecause of their biological significance, amino acids are important in nutrition\nand are commonly used in nutritional supplements, fertilizers, and food\ntechnology. Industrial uses include the production of drugs, biodegradable\nplastics and chiral catalysts.\n","linknr":1672,"url":"D-amino_acids","recorded":1362901543,"links":112,"instances":["chemistry","chemistry","biology","biology","chemistry"],"pdf":["http://www.informaworld.com/index/718581646.pdf","http://www.informaworld.com/index/718581646.pdf","http://rogov.zwz.ru/Macroevolution/amino.pdf","http://rogov.zwz.ru/Macroevolution/amino.pdf"],"categories":["Amino
