Removal\nmay be surgical, mechanical, chemical, autolytic (self-digestion), and by\nmaggot therapy, where certain species of live maggots selectively eat only\nnecrotic tissue.\n\nIn oral hygiene and dentistry, debridement refers to the removal of plaque and\ncalculus that have accumulated on the teeth. Debridement in this case may be\nperformed using ultrasonic instruments, which fracture the calculus, thereby\nfacilitating its removal, as well as hand tools, including periodontal scaler\nand curettes, or through the use of chemicals such as hydrogen peroxide.\n\nIn podiatry practitioners such as chiropodists, podiatrists and foot health\npractitioners remove callus, corns, verrucas etc.\n\nDebridement is an important part of the healing process for burns and\nother serious wounds; it is also used for treating some kinds of snake and\nspider bites.\n\nSometimes the boundaries of the problem tissue may not be clearly defined. For\nexample, when excising a tumor, there may be micrometastases along the edges of\nthe tumor that are too small to be detected, and if not removed, could cause a\nrelapse. In such circumstances, a surgeon may opt to debride a portion of the\nsurrounding healthy tissue â as little as possible â to ensure that the tumor is\ncompletely removed.\n","linknr":166,"url":"Debridement","recorded":1362568076,"links":27,"instances":["biology","biology","dental"],"pdf":["http://wound.smith-nephew.com/FileManager/Public/RetrieveFile.aspx?DocumentGUID=%7BC23FC15C-443F-4689-BCB5-0E5B6FDE989F%7D&b=2-Vanscheidt%20-%20TIME.pdf"],"categories":["Medical treatments"],"headings":["Types of wound debridement","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/Necrotizing_fasciitis_left_leg_debridement.JPEG/230px-Necrotizing_fasciitis_left_leg_debridement.JPEG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/Rod_of_Asclepius2.svg/8px-Rod_of_Asclepius2.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["tissue","biology"],["autolysis","biology"],["calculus","dental"]],"members":["autolysis","tissue","calculus"],"related":["Necrosis","Necrotizing_fasciitis","Dead","Infect","Tissue_(biology)","Health","Surgery","Autolysis_(biology)","Maggot_therapy","Species","Maggot","Necrosis","Oral_hygiene","Dentistry","Dental_plaque","Calculus_(dental)","Ultrasound","Periodontal_scaler","Periodontal_curette","Hydrogen_peroxide","Podiatry","Chiropodists","Podiatrists","Foot_health_practitioner","Burn","Micrometastasis","Eschar","Sloughing","Maggot_Therapy"]}
