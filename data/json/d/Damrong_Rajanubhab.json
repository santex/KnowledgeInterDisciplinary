He was also a self-taught historian, and one of the most\ninfluential intellectuals of his time.\n\nBorn as Phra Ong Chao Ditsawarakuman ( â 'Prince Ditsawarakuman'), a son of\nKing Mongkut with a lesser Royal wife named Chao Ghom Manda Chum, he initially\nlearned Thai and Pali from private tutors, and English at the Royal School with\nMr. Francis George Patterson. At the age of 14, he received his formal\neducation in a special palace school created by his half-brother, King\nChulalongkorn. He was given posts in the royal administration at an early age,\nbecoming the commander of the Royal Guards Regiment in 1880 at age 18, and\nafter several years working in building army schools as well as modernizing the\narmy in general he became the deputy commander-in-chief of the army in 1887. At\nthe same time he was chosen by the king to become the Minister of Education in\nhis provisional cabinet. However, when King Chulalongkorn began his\nadministrative reform programme in 1892, Prince Damrong was chosen to lead the\nMinistry of the North (Mahatthai), which was converted into the Ministry of the\nInterior in 1894.\n\nIn his time as minister, he completely overhauled the provincial administration.\nMany minor provinces were merged into larger ones, the provincial governors lost\nmost of their autonomy when the post was converted into one appointed and\nsalaried by the ministry, and a new administrative division â the [[monthon]]\n(circle) covering several provinces â was created. Also, the formal education of\nadministrative staff was introduced. Prince Damrong was among the most important\nadvisors of the king, and considered second only to him in power.\n\nAfter the death of King Chulalongkorn in 1910, the relationship with his\nsuccessor King Vajiravudh was less smooth. Prince Damrong finally resigned in\n1915 from his post at the ministry, officially due to health problems, since\notherwise the resignation would have looked like an affront against the\nabsolute monarch.\n\nDuring the brief reign of King Prajadhipok, the prince proposed that the king\nfounded the Royal Institute, mainly to look after the National Library and the\nmuseums. He became the first President of the Royal Institute of Thailand. He\nwas given the title Somdet Phra Chao Borommawong Thoe Krom Phraya Damrong\nRajanubhab by King Prajadhipok in recognition to his works. This became the name\nby which he is generally known.\n\nIn the following years Damrong worked as a self-educated historian, as well as\nwriting books on Thai literature, culture and arts. Out of his works grew the\nNational Library, as well as the National Museum.\n\nAfter the coup d'Ã©tat of 1932 which ended the absolute monarchy in Thailand, he\nwas exiled to Penang, (Malaysia). In 1942 he was allowed to return to Bangkok,\nwhere he died one year later.\n\nPrince Damrong is credited as the father of Thai history, the education system,\nthe health system (the Ministry of Health was originally a department of the\nMinistry of the Interior) and the provincial administration. On the centenary of\nhis birth in 1962, he became the first Thai to be included in the UNESCO list of\nthe world's most distinguished persons.\n\n\n\nHis many descendants use the Royal surname Disakul.\n","linknr":139,"url":"Damrong_Rajanubhab","recorded":1375074955,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Damrong_Rajanubhab&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Damrong_Rajanubhab&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Prince_Damrong_Rajanubhab.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/Prince_Damrong_Rajanubhab.jpg/220px-Prince_Damrong_Rajanubhab.jpg","/wiki/Mongkut","/wiki/Bangkok","/wiki/Bangkok","/wiki/File:Damrong_Rachanuphap_-_Sign_-_001.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/eb/Damrong_Rachanuphap_-_Sign_-_001.jpg/125px-Damrong_Rachanuphap_-_Sign_-_001.jpg","/wiki/Royal_Thai_General_System_of_Transcription","/wiki/Thailand","/wiki/Autodidacticism","/wiki/Mongkut","/wiki/Thai_language","/wiki/P%C4%81li","/wiki/Chulalongkorn","/wiki/Royal_Guards_(Thailand)","/wiki/Provinces_of_Thailand","/wiki/Monthon","/wiki/Vajiravudh","/wiki/Absolute_monarchy","/wiki/Prajadhipok","/wiki/The_Royal_Institute_of_Thailand","/wiki/National_Museum_(Thailand)","/wiki/Penang","/wiki/Malaysia","/wiki/UNESCO","/wiki/File:Damrong_Rajanubhab.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/44/Damrong_Rajanubhab.jpg/220px-Damrong_Rajanubhab.jpg","/wiki/File:Damrong_Rajanubhab.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/w/index.php?title=Damrong_Rajanubhab&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Special:BookSources/9747534584","/wiki/Special:BookSources/9748358852","/w/index.php?title=Twentieth_century_impressions_of_Siam&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Damrong_Rajanubhab&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Varadis_Palace","/w/index.php?title=Damrong_Rajanubhab&action=edit&section=3","http://www.asiasource.org/society/damrongrajanubhab.cfm","/w/index.php?title=Tej_Bunnag&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0-19-580343-4","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/50281980","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","/wiki/Bangkok","/wiki/Bangkok","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Damrong_Rajanubhab&oldid=550170743","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Thai_princes","/wiki/Category:Phra_Ong_Chao","/wiki/Category:Chakri_Dynasty","/wiki/Category:House_of_Disakul","/wiki/Category:Chulalongkorn_family","/wiki/Category:Thai_historians","/wiki/Category:Historians_of_Southeast_Asia","/wiki/Category:Knights_of_the_Order_of_the_Royal_House_of_Chakri","/wiki/Category:Knights_of_the_Order_of_the_Nine_Gems","/wiki/Category:Knights_Grand_Cordon_of_the_Order_of_Chula_Chom_Klao","/wiki/Category:Knights_of_the_Ratana_Varabhorn_Order_of_Merit","/wiki/Category:Knights_Grand_Cordon_of_the_Order_of_the_White_Elephant","/wiki/Category:Knights_Grand_Cordon_of_the_Order_of_the_Crown_of_Thailand","/wiki/Category:1862_births","/wiki/Category:1943_deaths","/wiki/Category:Use_dmy_dates_from_December_2011","/wiki/Category:Articles_containing_Thai-language_text","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Damrong+Rajanubhab&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Damrong+Rajanubhab","/wiki/Damrong_Rajanubhab","/wiki/Talk:Damrong_Rajanubhab","#","/wiki/Damrong_Rajanubhab","/w/index.php?title=Damrong_Rajanubhab&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Damrong_Rajanubhab&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Damrong_Rajanubhab","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Damrong_Rajanubhab","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPage
