The data is typically organized\nto model relevant aspects of reality (for example, the availability of rooms in\nhotels), in a way that supports processes requiring this information (for\nexample, finding a hotel with vacancies).\n\nDatabase management systems (DBMSs) are specially designed applications that\ninteract with the user, other applications, and the database itself to capture\nand analyze data. A general-purpose 'database management system (DBMS)' is a\nsoftware system designed to allow the definition, creation, querying, update,\nand administration of databases. Well-known DBMSs include MySQL, PostgreSQL,\nSQLite, Microsoft SQL Server, Microsoft Access, Oracle, SAP, dBASE, FoxPro, IBM\nDB2 and FilemakerPro. A database is not generally portable across different\nDBMS, but different DBMSs can inter-operate by using standards such as SQL and\nODBC or JDBC to allow a single application to work with more than one database.\n","title":"database","headings":["Terminology and overview","Applications and roles","History","Database research","Database type examples","Database design and modeling","Database
