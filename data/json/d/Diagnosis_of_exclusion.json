{"cursor":"3781","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'diagnosis of exclusion' (per exclusionem) is a medical condition reached by a\nprocess of elimination, which may be necessary if presence cannot be established\nwith complete confidence from examination or testing. Such elimination of other\nreasonable possibilities is a major component in performing a differential\ndiagnosis.\n\nPerhaps the largest category of diagnosis by exclusion is seen among psychiatric\ndisorders where the presence of physical or organic disease must be excluded as\na pre-requisite for making a functional diagnosis. Diagnosis by exclusion tends\nto occur where scientific knowledge is scarce, specifically where the means to\nverify a diagnosis by an objective method is absent. As a specific diagnosis\ncannot be confirmed a fall back position is to exclude that group of known\ncauses that may cause a similar clinical presentation.\n","linknr":136,"url":"Diagnosis_of_exclusion","recorded":1362570661,"links":15,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Medical terminology"],"headings":["Examples","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/Rod_of_Asclepius2.svg/9px-Rod_of_Asclepius2.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Process_of_elimination","Differential_diagnosis","Fever_of_unknown_origin","Neoplasm","Behcet's_Disease","Bell's_Palsy","Sarcoidosis","Tolosa-Hunt_syndrome","Irritable_bowel_syndrome","New_daily_persistent_headache","Sudden_infant_death_syndrome","Burning_mouth_syndrome","Idiopathic"]}
