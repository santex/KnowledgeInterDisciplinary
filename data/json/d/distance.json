In physics or everyday discussion, distance may refer\nto a physical length, or an estimation based on other criteria (e.g. \"two\ncounties over\"). In mathematics, a distance function or metric is a\ngeneralization of the concept of physical distance. A metric is a function\nthat behaves according to a specific set of rules, and is a concrete way of\ndescribing what it means for elements of some space to be \"close to\" or \"far\naway from\" each other. In most cases, \"distance from A to B\" is\ninterchangeable with \"distance between B and A\".\n",
