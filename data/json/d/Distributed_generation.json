Most countries generate electricity in large centralized facilities,\nsuch as fossil fuel (coal, gas powered), nuclear, large solar power plants or\nhydropower plants. These plants have excellent economies of scale, but usually\ntransmit electricity long distances and negatively affect the environment.\nDistributed generation allows collection of energy from many sources and may\ngive lower environmental impacts and improved security of supply.\n","linknr":362,"url":"Distributed_generation","recorded":1362508790,"links":36,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.nrel.gov/docs/legosti/fy97/6980.pdf"],"categories":["Power station technology","Distributed generation|"],"headings":["Economies of scale","Distributed generation","Microgrid","Modes of power generation","Communication in DER systems","Legal requirements for distributed generation","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/Windgen59.JPG/260px-Windgen59.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d3/Microgrid.jpg/400px-Microgrid.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/14/Crystal_energy.svg/29px-Crystal_energy.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/Sustainable_development.svg/32px-Sustainable_development.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Electricity","Fossil_fuel","Coal","Combined_cycle","Nuclear_reactor","Solar_power_plants","Hydropower","Colliery","Hydroelectricity","Natural_gas","District_heating","Feed-in_Tariff","Embedded_system","Renewable_energy","Geothermal","Photovoltaic_module","Do_it_yourself","Cadmium_telluride","Copper_indium_gallium_selenide","Capacity_factor","Wind_generator","Accelerated_depreciation","Slippery_Rock_University","Molten_carbonate_and_solid_oxide_fuel_cell","Fuel_Cell_Energy_Co,_VERSA_power_Co._and_Bloom_Energy_Server","Cogeneration","Microturbine","Reciprocating_engine","Absorptive_chiller","Air-conditioning","Micro_combined_heat_and_power","Power_quality","Gas_turbine","Water","Steam_turbine","Rankine_cycle","Electric_vehicle_network","Electrical_grid","July_2012_India_blackout","Combined_heat_power","Fuel_cells","MicroCHP","Microturbines","Photovoltaic_Systems","Reciprocating_engines","Wind_power","Stirling_engines","Trigeneration","IEC_61850","Manufacturing_Message_Specification","OLE_for_process_control","Autonomous_building","Demand_response","Energy_harvesting","Electric_power_transmission","Electricity_generation","Electricity_market","Electricity_retailing","Energy_demand_management","Future_energy_development","Green_power_superhighway","Grid-tied_electrical_system","Hydrogen_station","IEEE_1547","Islanding","Microgeneration","Net_metering","Relative_cost_of_electricity_generated_by_different_sources","Renewable_energy_development","Smart_meter","Smart_power_grid","Solar_Guerrilla","Stand-alone_power_system","Sustainable_community_energy_system","Trigeneration","Vehicle-to-grid","Virtual_power_plant","World_Alliance_for_Decentralized_Energy"]}
