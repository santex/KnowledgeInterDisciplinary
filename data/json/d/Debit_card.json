{"cursor":"75846","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nA 'debit card' (also known as a 'bank card' or 'check card') is a plastic\ncard that provides the cardholder electronic access to his or her bank\naccount(s) at a financial institution. Some cards have a stored value with which\na payment is made, while most relay a message to the cardholder's bank to\nwithdraw funds from a payee's designated bank account. The card, where accepted,\ncan be used instead of cash when making purchases. In some cases, the primary\naccount number is assigned exclusively for use on the Internet and there is no\nphysical card.

The development of debit cards, unlike credit cards and charge\ncards, has generally been country specific resulting in a number of different\nsystems around the world, which were often incompatible. Since the mid 2000s, a\nnumber of initiatives have allowed debit cards issued in one country to be used\nin other countries and allowed their use for internet and phone purchases.\n\nUnlike credit and charge cards, payments using a debit card are immediately\ntransferred from the cardholder's designated bank account, instead of them\npaying the money back at a later date.\n\nDebit cards usually also allow for instant withdrawal of cash, acting as the ATM\ncard for withdrawing cash. Merchants may also offer cashback facilities to\ncustomers, where a customer can withdraw cash along with their purchase.\n","linknr":802,"url":"Debit_card","recorded":1362477080,"links":79,"instances":["bank_card","indonesia","credit_card","interbank_network","company","law","interbank_network","debit_card","debit_card","debit_card","interbank_network","debit_card","interbank_network"],"pdf":["http://www.polymathconsulting.com/images/uploaded/Pepper%20Prepaid%20Report%20Extract.pdf","http://www.polymathconsulting.com/images/uploaded/Pepper%20Prepaid%20Report%20Extract.pdf","http://www.kansascityfed.org/publicat/reswkpap/pdf/rwp12-03.pdf","http://www.kansascityfed.org/publicat/reswkpap/pdf/rwp12-03.pdf","http://www.pbs.dk/wwcm/resources/file/ebe8a4094bde751/pbs-aarsrapport_2007_DK.pdf","http://www.pbs.dk/wwcm/resources/file/ebe8a4094bde751/pbs-aarsrapport_2007_DK.pdf","http://www.rbnz.govt.nz/finstab/payment/3236268.pdf","http://www.rbnz.govt.nz/finstab/payment/3236268.pdf","http://usa.visa.com/download/merchants/rules_for_visa_merchants.pdf"],"categories":["Payment
