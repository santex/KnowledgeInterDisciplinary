It\nhas a natural abundance in Earth's oceans of about one atom in of hydrogen.\nThus deuterium accounts for approximately 0.0156% (or on a mass basis:\n0.0312%) of all the naturally occurring hydrogen in the oceans, while the most\ncommon isotope (hydrogen-1 or protium) accounts for more than 99.98%. The\nabundance of deuterium changes slightly from one kind of natural water to\nanother (see VSMOW).\n\nThe nucleus of deuterium, called a 'deuteron', contains one proton and one\nneutron, whereas the far more common hydrogen isotope, protium, has no neutron\nin the nucleus. The deuterium isotope's name is formed from the Greek deuteros\nmeaning \"second\", to denote the two particles composing the nucleus. Deuterium was discovered and named in 1931 by Harold Urey,\nearning him a Nobel Prize in 1934. This followed the discovery of the neutron in\n1932, which made the nuclear structure of deuterium obvious. Soon after\ndeuterium's discovery, Urey and others produced samples of \"heavy water\" in\nwhich the deuterium has been highly concentrated with respect to the protium.\n\nBecause deuterium is destroyed in the interiors of stars faster than it is\nproduced, and because other natural processes are thought to produce only an\ninsignificant amount of deuterium, it is presently thought that nearly all\ndeuterium found in nature was produced in the Big Bang 13.7 billion years ago,\nand that the basic or primordial ratio of hydrogen-1 (protium) to deuterium\n(about 26 atoms of deuterium per million hydrogen atoms) has its origin from\nthat time. This is the ratio found in the gas giant planets, such as Jupiter.\nHowever, different astronomical bodies are found to have different ratios of\ndeuterium to hydrogen-1, and this is thought to be as a result of natural\nisotope separation processes that occur from solar heating of ices in comets.\nLike the water-cycle in Earth's weather, such heating processes may enrich\ndeuterium with respect to protium. In fact, the discovery of deuterium/protium\nratios in a number of comets very similar to the mean ratio in Earth's oceans\n(156 atoms of deuterium per million hydrogens) has led to theories that much of\nEarth's ocean water has a cometary origin. \n\nDeuterium/protium ratios thus continue to be an active topic of research in both\nastronomy and climatology.\n","linknr":663,"url":"Deuterium","recorded":1362512802,"links":77,"instances":["physics","quantum_mechanics","quantum_mechanics","physics","physics","physics","chemistry","quantum_mechanics"],"pdf":["http://iopscience.iop.org/0004-637X/554/1/391/pdf/0004-637X_554_1_391.pdf","http://iopscience.iop.org/0004-637X/554/1/391/pdf/0004-637X_554_1_391.pdf","http://www.iupac.org/publications/pac/2001/pdf/7302x0377.pdf","http://www.iupac.org/publications/pac/2001/pdf/7302x0377.pdf","http://mightylib.mit.edu/Course%20Materials/22.101/Fall%202004/Notes/Part3.pdf"],"categories":["Isotopes
