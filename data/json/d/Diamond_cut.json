{"cursor":"38667","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nA 'diamond cut' is a style or design guide used when shaping a diamond for\npolishing such as the brilliant cut. Cut does not refer to shape (pear, oval),\nbut the symmetry, proportioning and polish of a diamond. The cut of a diamond\ngreatly impacts a diamond's brilliance; this means if it is cut poorly, it will\nbe less luminous.\n\nIn order to best utilize a diamond gemstone's material properties, a number of\ndifferent 'diamond cuts' have been developed. A diamond cut constitutes a more\nor less symmetrical arrangement of facets, which together modify the shape and\nappearance of a diamond crystal. Diamond cutters must consider several factors,\nsuch as the shape and size of the crystal, when choosing a cut. The practical\nhistory of diamond cuts can be traced back to the Middle Ages, while their\ntheoretical basis was not developed until the turn of the 20th century. Design\ncreation and innovation continue to the present day: new technologyânotably\nlaser cutting and computer-aided designâhas enabled the development of cuts\nwhose complexity, optical performance, and waste reduction were hitherto\nunthinkable.\n\nThe most popular of diamond cuts is the modern round [[brilliant (diamond\ncut)|brilliant]], whose facet arrangements and proportions have been perfected\nby both mathematical and empirical analysis. Also popular are the [[#Fancy\ncuts|fancy cuts]], which come in a variety of shapesâmany of which were derived\nfrom the round brilliant. A diamond's cut is evaluated by trained graders, with\nhigher grades given to stones whose symmetry and proportions most closely match\nthe particular \"ideal\" used as a benchmark. The strictest standards are applied\nto the round brilliant; although its facet count is invariable, its proportions\nare not. Different countries base their cut grading on different ideals: one may\nspeak of the American Standard or the Scandinavian Standard (Scan. D.N.), to\ngive but two examples.\n","linknr":334,"url":"Diamond_cut","recorded":1362477225,"links":22,"instances":["tool","mineralogy","physics","gems","unit","diamond_cut","diamond","optics","optics"],"pdf":["http://www.diamondcut.gia.edu/pdf/6_05_RDR_pg239_243pdf.pdf"],"categories":["Diamond cutting|","Diamond"],"headings":["History","Theory","Polish and symmetry","Choice of cut","Round brilliant","Fancy cuts","Cut grading","See also","References","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/Brillanten.jpg/150px-Brillanten.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b9/Diamond_cut_history.png/350px-Diamond_cut_history.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e6/Fancy_cut_diamonds.jpg/220px-Fancy_cut_diamonds.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3a/Diamond_facets.svg/314px-Diamond_facets.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e8/PC_DiamondAnatomy_B-W.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["brilliant","diamond_cut"],["dispersion","optics"],["orlov","diamond"],["brilliant","diamond_cut"],["lathe","tool"],["dispersion","optics"],["reflection","physics"],["prism","optics"],["carat","unit"],["lustre","mineralogy"],["lustre","mineralogy"],["cut","gems"],["brilliant","diamond_cut"]],"members":["lathe","lustre","reflection","cut","carat","brilliant","orlov","prism","dispersion"],"related":["Brilliant_(diamond_cut)","Gemstone","Material_properties_of_diamond","Facet","Crystal","Diamond_cutting","Middle_Ages","Laser","Computer-aided_design","Mathematics","Empiricism","Middle_Ages","Octahedral","Guild","Nürnberg","Culet","Dispersion_(optics)","Adamantine_lustre","Ruby","Sapphire","Lodewyk_van_Berken","Flemings","Bruges","Antwerp","India","Orlov_(diamond)","Sancy","Brilliant_(diamond_cut)","Vincent_Peruzzi","Venice","Saw","Lathe_(tool)","Marcel_Tolkowsky","Alluvial","Washing_soda","Refractive_index","Sodium_light","Nanometer","Dispersion_(optics)","Spectral_color","Reflection_(physics)","Metal","Total_internal_reflection","Angle_of_incidence","Human_eye","Prism_(optics)","Surface_normal","Carat_(unit)","Diamond_cutting","Crystal","Octahedra","Material_properties_of_diamond","Crystal_twinning","Macle","Milligram","Lustre_(mineralogy)","Diamond_clarity","Art_Deco","Antique","Jewelry","Facet","Human_eye","Tradition","Valentine's_Day","Wedding_anniversary","Earrings","Insurance","Culet","Diamond_cutting","Symmetry","Marcel_Tolkowsky","North_America","Germany","Europe","Germany","Scandinavian_Diamond_Nomenclature","French_language","Insurance","New_York_City","Belgium","Emerald","Diamond_clarity","Lustre_(mineralogy)","Art_Deco","Antique","French_language","India","South_Africa","Basil_Watermeyer","Cross","Crescent","London","Gemology","American_Gem_Society","Hearts_and_arrows","Cut_(gems)","List_of_gemstone_cuts","Brilliant_(diamond_cut)","Princess_cut","Diamond_cutting","Diamond_clarity","Diamond_color","Diamond_enhancement","Diamond_simulant","Synthetic_diamond","Material_properties_of_diamond","List_of_diamonds"]}
