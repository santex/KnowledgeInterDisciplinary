      "text" : "\n\n\n return capsule (typical for the Corona series)]]\n\nThe 'Corona' program was a series of American strategic reconnaissance\nsatellites produced and operated by the Central Intelligence Agency Directorate\nof Science & Technology with substantial assistance from the U.S. Air Force. The\nCorona satellites were used for photographic surveillance of the Soviet Union\n(USSR), the People's Republic of China, and other areas beginning in June 1959\nand ending in May 1972. The name of this program is sometimes seen as \"CORONA\",\nbut its actual name \"Corona\" was a codeword, not an acronym.\n\nThe Corona satellites were designated 'KH-1', 'KH-2', 'KH-3', 'KH-4', 'KH-4A'\nand 'KH-4B'. KH stood for \"Key Hole\" or \"Keyhole\" (Code number 1010),<ref\nname=\"Yenne\">p.82 'Key Hole'</ref> with the name being an analogy to the act of\nspying into a person's room by peering through their door's keyhole. The\nincrementing number indicated changes in the surveillance instrumentation, such\nas the change from single-panoramic to double-panoramic cameras. The \"KH\" naming\nsystem was first used in 1962 with KH-4 and the earlier numbers were\nretroactively applied. There were 144 Corona satellites launched, of which 102\nreturned usable photographs.\n",
