It consists of a vertical rigid \"tower\" with one or more\nhorizontal platforms extending out over a deep pool of water. In platform\ndiving, the diver jumps from a high stationary surface. The height of the\nplatforms - , and - gives the diver enough time to perform the acrobatic\nmovements of a particular dive. There are additional platforms set at and .\nDiving platforms for FINA sanctioned meets must be at least feet long and wide.\nMost platforms are covered by some sort of matting or non-slip surface to\nprevent athletes from slipping.\n\nAll three levels of the platform are used in JO and NCAA competition. Each level\noffers a distinct degree of difficulty (DD) and therefore could yield different\nscores for divers.\n","linknr":87,"url":"Diving_platform","recorded":1362578997,"links":14,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Competitive diving"],"headings":["References","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/d0/Diving_Tower.jpg/220px-Diving_Tower.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Diving","Swimming_pool","Acrobatics","FINA","NCAA","Springboard"]}
