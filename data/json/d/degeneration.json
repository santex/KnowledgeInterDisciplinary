The social\ntheory developed consequently from Charles Darwin's Theory of Evolution.\nEvolution meant that mankind's development was no longer fixed and certain, but\ncould change and evolve or degenerate into an unknown future, possibly a bleak\nfuture that clashes with the analogy between evolution and civilization as a\nprogressive positive direction.\n\nAs a consequence, theorists assumed the human species might be overtaken by a\nmore adaptable species or circumstances might change and suit a more adapted\nspecies. Degeneration theory presented a pessimistic outlook for the future of\nwestern civilization as it believed the progress of the 19th century had begun\nto work against itself.\n","title":"degeneration","headings":["History","Art","See also","References","Bibliography","External links"]},"micro-relation":["3: Evolution","2: Georges-Louis_Leclerc,_Comte_de_Buffon","2: Caucasian_race","2: Alcoholism","1: Science","1: Art","1: Politics","1: Social_theory","1: Charles_Darwin","1: Theory_of_Evolution","1: Western_culture","1: Johann_Friedrich_Blumenbach","1: Monogenism","1: Adam_and_Eve","1: Carl_Linnaeus","1: Adaptation","1: Noah's_Ark","1: Lion","1: Cougar","1: Leopard","1: Jaguar","1: George_Campbell,_8th_Duke_of_Argyll","1: Poverty","1: Crime","1: Perversion","1: Political_violence","1: France","1: Bénédict_Morel","1: Darwinism","1: Jean-Baptiste_Lamarck","1: Sexual_perversion","1: Genetic_predisposition","1: Criminality","1: Criminologist","1: Cesare_Lombroso","1: Autopsy","1: Eugenic","1: Nazism","1: Daniel_Pick","1: Sander_Gilman","1: Aromorphosis","1: Anagenesis","1: Cladogenesis","1: Korotayev","1: Decadent_movement","1: Max_Nordau","1: Degenerate_art","1: Dysgenics","1: Societal_collapse"]}
