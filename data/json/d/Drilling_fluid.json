Often used while drilling oil and natural gas wells\nand on exploration drilling rigs, drilling fluids are also used for much simpler\nboreholes, such as water wells. Liquid drilling fluid is often called 'drilling\nmud'. The three main categories of drilling fluids are water-based muds (which\ncan be dispersed and non-dispersed), non-aqueous muds, usually called oil-based\nmud, and gaseous drilling fluid, in which a wide range of gases can be used.\n\nThe main functions of drilling fluids include providing hydrostatic pressure to\nprevent formation fluids from entering into the well bore, keeping the drill bit\ncool and clean during drilling, carrying out drill cuttings, and suspending the\ndrill cuttings while drilling is paused and when the drilling assembly is\nbrought in and out of the hole. The drilling fluid used for a particular job is\nselected to avoid formation damage and to limit corrosion.\n","linknr":465,"url":"Drilling_fluid","recorded":1362481592,"links":32,"instances":["measurement_while_drilling","well_drilling","oil","fluid","materials_science"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Drilling technology","Oilfield terminology"],"headings":["Types of drilling fluid","Function","Composition of drilling mud","Drilling mud classification","Mud engineer","Compliance engineer","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/DiamondRig-SuperFoam.jpg/250px-DiamondRig-SuperFoam.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c3/Barite_powder_A321.jpg/220px-Barite_powder_A321.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/12px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["blowout","well_drilling"],["permeability","fluid"],["coupon","materials_science"],["driller","oil"],["mwd","measurement_while_drilling"]],"members":["mwd","blowout","driller","permeability","coupon"],"related":["Geotechnical_engineering","Boreholes","Oil_well","Natural_gas","Drilling_rig","Water_wells","Gas","Hydrostatic_pressure","Formation_fluid","Well_drilling","Formation_damage","Drill_string","Polymer","Shale","Bentonite","Potassium_formate","Shale_shaker","Electrical_Equipment_in_Hazardous_Areas","Viscosity","Thixotropic","Lost_circulation","Sag","Solids_control","Barite","Blowout_(well_drilling)","Tectonic","Mud_filtrate","Calcium_carbonate","Bentonite","Asphalt","Gilsonite","Sandstones","Bentonite","Shales","Potassium","Glycols","Shale","Calcium_chloride","Shale","Permeability_(fluid)","Mud_filtrate","Mud_motor","Coefficient_of_friction","Derrick","Mud_motor","Measurement_while_drilling","Logging_while_drilling","Lithology","Resonance","Corrosion","Hydrogen_sulfide","Catastrophic_failure","PH","Coupon_(materials_science)","Lago_Agrio_oil_field","Bentonite","Clay","Barium_sulfate","Calcium_carbonate","Hematite","Thickener","Viscosity","Xanthan_gum","Guar_gum","Glycol","Carboxymethylcellulose","Starch","Deflocculant","Polyelectrolyte","Acrylate","Polyphosphate","Lignosulfonates","Tannic_acid","Quebracho_tannin","Quebracho_tannin","Oil_based_mud","Drilling_rig","Mud_engineer","Mudlogger","Directional_drilling","Driller_(oil)","Drilling_rig","Formation_evaluation","MWD_(measurement_while_drilling)","Roughneck","Underbalanced_drilling","Mud_Gas_Separator","Mud_systems","Oil_well_control"]}
