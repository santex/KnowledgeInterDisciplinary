{"cursor":"7010","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nA 'dopant', also called a doping agent, is a trace impurity element that is\ninserted into a substance (in very low concentrations) in order to alter the\nelectrical properties or the optical properties of the substance. In the case of\ncrystalline substances, the atoms of the dopant very commonly take the place of\nelements that were in the crystal lattice of the material. These materials are\nvery commonly either crystals of a semiconductor (silicon, germanium, etc.), for\nuse in solid-state electronics; or else transparent crystals that are used to\nmake lasers of various types. However, noncrystalline substances such as glass\ncan also be doped with impurities in order to make some lasers.\n","linknr":201,"url":"Dopant","recorded":1362555073,"links":18,"instances":["optics","semiconductor","phosphor"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Semiconductor material structures"],"headings":["Semiconductors","Lasing media","Phosphors and scintillators","Examples","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["doping","semiconductor"],["transparency","optics"],["activator","phosphor"]],"members":["transparency","doping","activator"],"related":["Electrical","Optics","Crystal","Crystal_lattice","Semiconductor","Silicon","Germanium","Solid-state_electronics","Transparency_and_translucency","Crystal","Laser","Glass","P-type_semiconductor","N-type_semiconductor","Transistor","Diode","Semiconductor","Doping_(semiconductor)","Fermi_level","N-type_semiconductor","P-type_semiconductor","Charge_carrier","Extrinsic_semiconductor","Intrinsic_semiconductor","Ion_implantation","Diffusion","Chromium","Neodymium","Erbium","Thulium","Ytterbium","Crystal","Ceramic","Glass","Active_laser_medium","Solid-state_laser","Population_inversion","Stimulated_emission","Laser","Ruby","Chromium","Aluminum_oxide","Yttrium_aluminum_garnet","Rare_earth_element","Transparency_(optics)","Stimulated_emission","Atomic_percent","Refraction_index","Optical_fiber","Double-clad_fiber","Phosphor","Scintillator","Activator_(phosphor)","Boron","Arsenic","Phosphorus","Antimony","Silicon","Germanium","Carbon_group","Pnictogen","Antimony","Phosphorus","Arsenic","Boron_group","Boron","Aluminium","Gallium","Gallium_arsenide","Chalcogen","Carbon_group","Sulfur","Selenium","Tellurium","Silicon","Germanium","Alkaline_earth_metal","Carbon_group","Magnesium","Zinc","Cadmium","Silicon","Germanium","Erbium","Laser_scalpel","Laser_surgery","Europium","Neodymium","Rare_earth_elements","Glass","Holmium","Yttrium_aluminium_garnet","Active_laser_medium","Gemstone","Ruby","Sapphire","Aluminum_oxide","Chromium","List_of_semiconductor_materials"]}
