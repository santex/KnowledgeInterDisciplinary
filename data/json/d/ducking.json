      "text" : "\n\n'Ducking' is an audio effect commonly used in radio and pop music, especially\ndance music. In ducking, the level of one audio signal is reduced by the\npresence of another signal. In radio this can typically be achieved by lowering\n(ducking) the volume of a secondary audio track when the primary track starts,\nand lifting the volume again when the primary track is finished. A typical use\nof this effect in a daily radio production routine is for creating a voice-over:\na foreign language original sound is dubbed (and ducked) by a professional\nspeaker reading the translation. Ducking becomes active as soon as the\ntranslation starts.\n\nIn music, the ducking effect is applied in more sophisticated ways where a\nsignal's volume is delicately lowered by another signal's presence. Ducking\nhere works through the use of a \"side chain\" gate. In other words, one track is\nmade quieter (the ducked track) whenever another (the ducking track) gets\nlouder. This may be done with a gate with its ducking function engaged or by a\ndedicated ducker.\n\nA typical application is to achieve an impression similar to the \"pumping\"\neffect. The difference between ducking and side-chain pumping is that in ducking\nthe attenuation is by a specific range while side-chain compression creates\nvariable attenuation.<ref>Hodgson, Jay (2010). Understanding Records, p.94. ISBN\n978-1-4411-5607-5.</ref> Ducking may be used in place of mirrored equalization\nto combat masking, for example with the bass guitar ducked under the kick drum,\nresembling subtle side-chain pumping.<ref>Hodgson (2010), p.96.</ref> A ducking\nsystem may be created where one track ducks another, which ducks another, and so\non. Examples include Portishead's \"Biscuit\".<ref>Hodgson (2010), p.97.</ref>\n\nUsed most often to turn down the music when the DJ speaks,<ref>Izhaki, Roey\n(2008). Mixing Audio, p.374. Focal Press. Cited in Hodgson (2010), p.95.</ref>\nducking may be used to combat the muffling and distancing effect of reverb and\ndelay. The ducker is inserted into the reverb and delay line and keyed to a dry\ntrack to duck its own reverb and delay so that when the dry track exceeds the\nducker's threshold by reaching a certain amplitude the reverb and delay are\nattenuated. Clear examples include Céline Dion's \"The Power Of Love\" where the\nreverb and delay become audible when Dion pauses and Adele's \"Cold\nShoulder\".<ref>Hodgson (2010), p.95-96.</ref>\n",
