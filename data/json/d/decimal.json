For the mathematical\ndefinition, see [[Decimal representation]].\n\n\n\nThe 'decimal' numeral system (also called 'base ten' or occasionally 'denary')\nhas ten as its base. It is the numerical base most widely used by modern\ncivilizations.<ref>The History of Arithmetic, Louis Charles Karpinski, 200pp,\nRand McNally & Company, 1925.</ref><ref>Histoire universelle des chiffres,\nGeorges Ifrah, Robert Laffont, 1994 (Also: The Universal History of Numbers:\nFrom prehistory to the invention of the computer, Georges Ifrah, ISBN 0-471-39340-\n1, John Wiley and Sons Inc., New York, 2000. Translated from the French by David\nBellos, E.F. Harding, Sophie Wood and Ian Monk)</ref>\n\n'Decimal notation' often refers to a base-10 positional notation such as the Hindu-\nArabic numeral system; however, it can also be used more generally to refer to\nnon-positional systems such as Roman or Chinese numerals which are also based on\npowers of ten.\n\n'Decimals' also refer to decimal fractions, either separately or in contrast to\nvulgar fractions. In this context, a decimal is a tenth part, and decimals\nbecome a series of nested tenths. There was a notation in use like 'tenth-\nmetre', meaning the tenth decimal of the metre, currently an Angstrom. The\ncontrast here is between decimals and vulgar fractions, and decimal divisions\nand other divisions of measures, like the inch. It is possible to follow a\ndecimal expansion with a vulgar fraction; this is done with the recent\ndivisions of the troy ounce, which has three places of decimals, followed by a\ntrinary place.\n","title":"decimal","headings":["Decimal notation","Decimal computation","History","See also","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["4: Hindu-Arabic_numerals","3: Numeral_system","3: Positional_notation","3: Hindu-Arabic_numeral_system","3: Roman_numerals","3: Octal","2: Georges_Ifrah","2: Chinese_numerals","2: Numerical_digit","2: Decimal_separator","2: Rational_number","2: Prime_factor","2: Recurring_decimal","2: 0.999...","2: Hexadecimal","2: Binary-coded_decimal","2: Simon_Stevin","1: Louis_Charles_Karpinski","1: Vulgar_fraction","1: Angstrom","1: Number","1: Brahmi_numerals","1: Counting_rods","1: Latin","1: Globe","1: Indian_numerals","1: Denominator","1: Exponentiation","1: Decimal_mark","1: Leading_zero","1: Integer_part","1: Truncation","1: Trailing_zero","1: Statistics","1: Finite_set","1: Long_division","1: Algorithm","1: Remainder","1: Geometric_series","1: Real_number","1: Sign_function","1: Common_logarithm","1: Irrational_number","1: Golden_mean_base","1: Rod_calculus","1: Abacus","1: Computer","1: Binary_numeral_system","1: ENIAC","1: IBM_650","1: Werner_Buchholz","1: IEEE_754","1: Mike_Cowlishaw","1: Egyptian_hieroglyphs","1: Cretan_hieroglyphs","1: Minoans","1: Bronze_Age_Greece","1: Linear_A","1: Linear_B","1: Classical_Greece","1: Archimedes","1: The_Sand_Reckoner","1: Carl_Friedrich_Gauss","1: Hittites","1: Lam_Lay_Yong","1: Joseph_Needham","1: Rod_calculus#Fractions","1: Qin_Jiushao","1: Mathematical_Treatise_in_Nine_Sections","1: Immanuel_Bonfils","1: Solomon_Gandz","1: Jamshīd_al-Kāshī","1: Abu'l-Hasan_al-Uqlidisi","1: Muhammad_ibn_Mūsā_al-Khwārizmī","1: Telugu_language","1: Dravidian_languages","1: Tamil_language","1: Malayalam","1: Hungarian_language","1: Chinese_language","1: Vietnamese_language","1: Japanese_language","1: Korean_language","1: Thai_language","1: Quechua_languages","1: Aymara_language","1: Pre-Columbian","1: Mesoamerica","1: Maya_numerals","1: Vigesimal","1: Toe","1: Yuki_tribe","1: California","1: Mexico","1: Chumashan_languages","1: Quaternary_numeral_system","1: Ventureño_language","1: Quinary","1: Gumatj_language","1: Nunggubuyu_language","1: SIL_International","1: Kuurn_Kopan_Noot_language","1: Saraveca","1: Nigeria","1: Base_12","1: Huli_language","1: Papua_New_Guinea","1: Pentadecimal","1: Umbu-Ungu_language","1: Base_24","1: Ngiti_language","1: Base_32","1: Algorism","1: Decimal_representation","1: Dewey_Decimal_System","1: Duodecimal","1: Scientific_notation","1: SI_prefix"]}
