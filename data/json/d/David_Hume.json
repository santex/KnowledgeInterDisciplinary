Hume is often grouped with John\nLocke, George Berkeley, and a handful of others as a British\nEmpiricist. Margaret Atherton, ed. The Empiricists: Critical Essays on\nLocke, Berkeley, and Hume. Lanham, MD: Rowman & Littlefield, 1999.\n\nBeginning with his [[A Treatise of Human Nature]] (1739), Hume strove to create\na total naturalistic \"science of man\" that examined the psychological basis of\nhuman nature. In stark opposition to the rationalists who preceded him, most\nnotably Descartes, he concluded that desire rather than reason governed human\nbehavior, saying: \"Reason is, and ought only to be the slave of the\npassions.\" A prominent figure in the sceptical philosophical\ntradition and a strong empiricist, he argued against the existence of innate\nideas, concluding instead that humans have knowledge only of things they\ndirectly experience. Thus he divides perceptions between strong and lively\n\"impressions\" or direct sensations and fainter \"ideas\", which are copied from\nimpressions. He developed the position that mental behaviour is governed by\n\"custom\", that is acquired ability; our use of induction, for example, is\njustified only by our idea of the \"constant conjunction\" of causes and effects.\nWithout direct impressions of a metaphysical \"self\", he concluded that humans\nhave no actual conception of the self, only of a bundle of sensations associated\nwith the self.\n\nHume advocated a compatibilist theory of free will that proved extremely\ninfluential on subsequent moral philosophy. He was also a sentimentalist who\nheld that ethics are based on feelings rather than abstract moral principles.\nHume also examined the normative isâought problem. He held notoriously ambiguous\nviews of Christianity, but famously challenged the argument from\ndesign in his [[Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion]] (1777).\n\nKant credited Hume with waking him up from his \"dogmatic slumbers\" and Hume has\nproved extremely influential on subsequent philosophy, especially on\nutilitarianism, logical positivism, William James, philosophy of science, early\nanalytic philosophy, cognitive philosophy, and other movements and thinkers. The\nphilosopher Jerry Fodor proclaimed Hume's Treatise \"the founding document of\ncognitive science\". Fodor, Jerry. Hume Variations. New York: Oxford\nUniversity Press, 2003, p. 134. Also famous as a prose\nstylist, Saintsbury, George, ed. Specimens of English Prose Style: From\nMalory to Macaulay. London: Macmillan & Co., 1907, p. 196. Hume pioneered\nthe essay as a literary genre and engaged with contemporary intellectual\nluminaries such as Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Adam Smith (who acknowledged Hume's\ninfluence on his economics and political philosophy), James Boswell, Joseph\nButler, and Thomas Reid.\n","linknr":1958,"url":"David_Hume","recorded":1362485281,"links":179,"instances":["poet","philosopher","logic","emotion","philosophy","philosophy","bookseller","philosopher","minister","philosopher"],"pdf":["http://stephanhartmann.org/HHL10_Milton.pdf","http://stephanhartmann.org/HHL10_Milton.pdf","http://www.davidhume.org/documents/1996PhD.pdf","http://www.davidhume.org/documents/1996PhD.pdf","http://www.rrbltd.co.uk/bibliographies/hume_web_bibiog_2e.pdf"],"categories":["1711
