{"cursor":"11892","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Dealkalization' is a process of surface modification applicable to glasses\ncontaining alkali ions, wherein a thin surface layer is created that has a lower\nconcentration of alkali ions than is present in the underlying, bulk glass. This\nchange in surface composition commonly alters the observed properties of the\nsurface, most notably enhancing corrosion resistance.\n\nMany commercial glass products such as containers are made of soda-lime glass,\nand therefore have a substantial percentage of sodium ions in their internal\nstructure. Since sodium is an alkali element, its selective removal from the\nsurface results in a dealkalized surface. A classic example of dealkalization is\nthe treatment of glass containers, where a special process is used to create a\ndealkalized inside surface that is more resistant to interactions with liquid\nproducts put inside the container. However, the term dealkalization may also be\ngenerally applied to any process where a glass surface forms a thin surface\nlayer that is depleted of alkali ions relative to the bulk. A common example is\nthe initial stages of glass corrosion or weathering, where alkali ions are\nleached from the surface region by interactions with water, forming a\ndealkalized surface layer.\n\nA dealkalized surface may have either no alkali remaining or may just have less\nthan the bulk. In silicate glasses, dealkalized surfaces are also often\nconsidered âsilica-richâ since the selective removal of alkali ions can be\nthought to leave behind a surface composed primarily of silica\n(SiO 2). To be precise, dealkalization does not generally involve the\noutright removal of alkali from the glass, but rather its replacement with\nprotons (H +) or hydronium ions (H 3O +) in the\nstructure through the process of ion-exchange.\n","linknr":234,"url":"Dealkalization","recorded":1362481738,"links":11,"instances":["chemistry","glassmaking","chemical_science"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Glass coating and surface modification","Glass chemistry","Packaging","Containers"],"headings":["Dealkalization treatment of glass containers","References","See also"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["leaching","chemical_science"],["base","chemistry"],["lehr","glassmaking"]],"members":["base","lehr","leaching"],"related":["Glass","Alkali","Ions","Corrosion","Soda-lime_glass","Sodium","Glass_container","Chemical_weathering","Leaching_(chemical_science)","Silicate","Silica","Proton","Hydronium","Ion-exchange","Alcohol","Vodka","Gin","PH","Buffer_solution","Base_(chemistry)","Diffusion","Vial","Borosilicate_glass","Ionic_strength","Lehr_(glassmaking)","Sulfur_dioxide","Sulfur_trioxide","Ammonium_sulfate","1,1-difluoroethane","Hydrofluoric_acid","Ball_Corporation","Autoclave","Titration","Secondary_ion_mass_spectrometry","X-ray_photoelectron_spectroscopy","Glass_container_industry","Glass","Soda-lime_glass","Surface_science"]}
