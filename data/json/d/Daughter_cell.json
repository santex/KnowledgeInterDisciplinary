Cell division is usually a small segment\nof a larger cell cycle. This type of cell division in eukaryotes is known as\nmitosis, and leaves the daughter cell capable of dividing again. The\ncorresponding sort of cell division in prokaryotes is known as binary fission.\nIn another type of cell division present only in eukaryotes, called meiosis, a\ncell is permanently transformed into a gamete and may not divide again until\nfertilization. Right before the parent cell splits, it undergoes DNA\nreplication.\n\nFor simple unicellular organisms Single cell\norganisms. See discussion within lead of the article on microorganism.\nsuch as the amoeba, one cell division is equivalent to reproduction â an entire\nnew organism is created. On a larger scale, mitotic cell division can create\nprogeny from multicellular organisms, such as plants that grow from cuttings.\nCell division also enables sexually reproducing organisms to develop from the\none-celled zygote, which itself was produced by cell division from gametes. And\nafter growth, cell division allows for continual construction and repair of the\norganism. A human being's body experiences about 10,000 trillion cell\ndivisions in a lifetime. {{Cite journal\n  | last = Quammen first = David authorlink = David Quammen title = Contagious\n  | cancer: The evolution of a killer url =\n  | http://harpers.org/archive/2008/04/0081988 journal = Harper's volume = 316\n  | issue = 1895 pages = 42 date = April 2008 accessdate = 24 September\n  | 2012}}\n\nCell division has been modeled by finite subdivision rules.

Before division can occur, the genomic information that is stored in\nchromosomes must be replicated, and the duplicated genome must be separated\ncleanly between cells. A great deal of cellular infrastructure is involved in\nkeeping genomic information consistent between \"generations\".\n","linknr":324,"url":"Daughter_cell","recorded":1362373970,"links":57,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Cell cycle","Cellular processes","Telomeres"],"headings":["Variants","Degradation","See also","Notes","References","Further Reading and reference sources","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/58/Padlock-olive.svg/20px-Padlock-olive.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/Three_cell_growth_types.png/300px-Three_cell_growth_types.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9f/Time-lapse_video_of_dividing_cells.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Cell_cycle","Eukaryote","Mitosis","Prokaryote","Binary_fission","Meiosis","Gamete","Fertilization","DNA_replication","Microorganism","Amoeba","Reproduction","Offspring","Sexual_reproduction","Zygote","Gamete","Finite_subdivision_rules","Genome","Chromosomes","Prokaryote","Eukaryote","Stem_cell","Sperm","Ovum","Somatic","Human","Hayflick_limit","Senescence","Telomere","Chromosome","Cancer","Enzyme","Telomerase","Cancer","Mitosis","Binary_fission","Cell_growth","Constantly_dividing_cells","American_Society_for_Cell_Biology","Xenopus_laevis","MRI","BioModels_Database"]}
