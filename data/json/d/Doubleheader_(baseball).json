{"cursor":"10121","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nA 'doubleheader' is a set of two baseball games played between the same two\nteams on the same day in front of the same crowd. In addition, the term is often\nused unofficially to refer to a pair of games played by a team in a single day,\nbut in front of different crowds and not in immediate succession.\n\nIn Major League Baseball, for many decades, doubleheaders were routinely\nscheduled several times each season. However, today a doubleheader is generally\nthe result of a prior game between the same two teams being postponed due to\ninclement weather or other factors. Most often the game is rescheduled for a day\non which the two teams play each other again. Often it is within the same\nseries, but in some cases, may be weeks or months after the original date. On\nrare occasions, the last game between two teams in that particular city is\nrained out, and a doubleheader may be scheduled at the other team's home park to\nreplace the missed game.\n\nCurrently, major league teams playing two games in a day usually play a \"day-\nnight doubleheader,\" in which the stadium is emptied of spectators and a\nseparate admission is required for the second game. However, such games are\nofficially regarded as two single games on the same date, rather than as a\ndoubleheader. True doubleheaders are less commonly played, and usually are of\nthe twi-night variety. Classic doubleheaders, also known as day doubleheaders,\nwere more common in the past, but still are played at the minor league and\ncollege levels.\n\nIn 1959, at least one league played a quarter of their games as classic\ndoubleheaders, which declined to 10% in 1979 and further to the point that there\nwere eight years between the last two scheduled official doubleheaders. Reasons\nfor the decline include clubs' desire to maximize revenue, longer duration of\ngames, five day pitching rotation as opposed to four day rotation, time\nmanagement of relievers and catchers, and lack of consensus amongst players.
