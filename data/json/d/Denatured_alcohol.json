{"cursor":"10352","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Denatured alcohol' or 'methylated spirits' is ethanol that has additives to\nmake it undrinkable (poisonous, extremely bad tasting, foul smelling or\nnauseating), to discourage recreational consumption. In some cases it is\nalso dyed.\n\nDenatured alcohol is used as a solvent and as fuel for spirit burners and\ncamping stoves. Because of the diversity of industrial uses for denatured\nalcohol, hundreds of additives and denaturing methods have been used. The main\nadditive has traditionally been 10% methanol, giving rise to the term\n\"methylated spirits\". Other typical additives include isopropyl alcohol,\nacetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone, and denatonium.\n\nDenaturing alcohol does not chemically alter the ethanol molecule. Rather, the\nethanol is mixed with other chemicals to form an undrinkable solution.\n\nDifferent additives are used to make it difficult to use distillation or other\nsimple processes to reverse the denaturation. Methanol is commonly used both\nbecause its boiling point is close to that of ethanol and because it is toxic.\nIn many countries, it is also required that denatured alcohol be dyed blue or\npurple with an aniline dye.\n","linknr":239,"url":"Denatured_alcohol","recorded":1362688436,"links":32,"instances":["juggling","economics","food"],"pdf":["http://journeytoforever.org/biofuel_library/EthylEsterofRapeOil.pdf","http://journeytoforever.org/biofuel_library/EthylEsterofRapeOil.pdf"],"categories":["Alcohols","Alcohol solvents","Excipients"],"headings":["Purpose","Formulations","Uses","Consumption and toxicity","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/Ethanol_Flasche.jpg/170px-Ethanol_Flasche.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/Denaturat.jpg/220px-Denaturat.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/da/MethylatedSpirits_bottle.jpg/220px-MethylatedSpirits_bottle.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["denaturation","food"],["duty","economics"],["torch","juggling"]],"members":["torch","duty","denaturation"],"related":["Ethanol","Poisonous","Emetic","Solvent","Methanol","Isopropyl_alcohol","Acetone","Methyl_ethyl_ketone","Methyl_isobutyl_ketone","Denatonium","Denaturation_(food)","Chemical_structure","Distillation","Dye","Aniline_dye","Ethanol","Sin_tax","Duty_(economics)","Ethanol","Wood_naphtha","Pyridine","Petroleum_oil","Methyl_violet","Ultralight_backpacking","Portable_stove","Sterno","Kerosene","Primus_stove","Sanding","Mealybug","Ink","Upholstery","Clothes","Shellac","Excipient","Ethanol","Biodiesel","Kerosene_heater","Kerosene_lamp","Mamod","Torch_(juggling)","Boric_acid","Jam","Fruit_preserves_","Marmalade","Toothpaste","Code_of_Federal_Regulations","Listerine","Thymol","Menthol","Eucalyptol","Drug_Facts_label","Surrogate_alcohol","Methanol","Prohibition","Denatonium","Pyridine","Unpleasant_odor","Syrup_of_ipecac","Isopropyl_alcohol","Rubbing_alcohol","E85","HM_Revenue_and_Customs"]}
