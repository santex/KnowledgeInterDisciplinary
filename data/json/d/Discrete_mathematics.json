{"cursor":"25162","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n like this are among the objects studied by discrete mathematics, for their\n interesting mathematical properties, their usefulness as models of real-world\n problems, and their importance in developing computer algorithms.]]\n\n'Discrete mathematics' is the study of mathematical structures that are\nfundamentally discrete rather than continuous. In contrast to real numbers that\nhave the property of varying \"smoothly\", the objects studied in discrete\nmathematics â such as integers, graphs, and statements in logic Richard\nJohnsonbaugh, Discrete Mathematics, Prentice Hall, 2008. â do not vary\nsmoothly in this way, but have distinct, separated values. Discrete\nmathematics therefore excludes topics in \"continuous mathematics\" such as\ncalculus and analysis. Discrete objects can often be enumerated by integers.\nMore formally, discrete mathematics has been characterized as the branch of\nmathematics dealing with countable sets Norman L. Biggs, Discrete\nmathematics, Oxford University Press, 2002. (sets that have the same\ncardinality as subsets of the natural numbers, including rational numbers but\nnot real numbers). However, there is no exact, universally agreed, definition of\nthe term \"discrete mathematics.\" Brian Hopkins, Resources for Teaching\nDiscrete Mathematics, Mathematical Association of America, 2008. Indeed,\ndiscrete mathematics is described less by what is included than by what is\nexcluded: continuously varying quantities and related notions.\n\nThe set of objects studied in discrete mathematics can be finite or infinite.\nThe term 'finite mathematics' is sometimes applied to parts of the field of\ndiscrete mathematics that deals with finite sets, particularly those areas\nrelevant to business.\n\nResearch in discrete mathematics increased in the latter half of the twentieth\ncentury partly due to the development of digital computers which operate in\ndiscrete steps and store data in discrete bits. Concepts and notations from\ndiscrete mathematics are useful in studying and describing objects and problems\nin branches of computer science, such as computer algorithms, programming\nlanguages, cryptography, automated theorem proving, and software development.\nConversely, computer implementations are significant in applying ideas from\ndiscrete mathematics to real-world problems, such as in operations research.\n\nAlthough the main objects of study in discrete mathematics are discrete objects,\nanalytic methods from continuous mathematics are often employed as well.\n","linknr":603,"url":"Discrete_mathematics","recorded":1362505076,"links":81,"instances":["mathematics","complexity","mathematics","logic","chemistry","mathematics","probability_theory","complexity","mathematics","mathematics","computer_science","mathematics","mathematics","mathematics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Discrete
