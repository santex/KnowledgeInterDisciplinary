It centers on a young racing\ndriver's effort to win the Champ Car World Series auto racing championship.\nPrior to production of the movie, Stallone was seen at many Formula 1 races, but\nhe was unable to procure enough information about the category due to the\nsecrecy with which teams protect their cars, so he decided to base the film on\nChamp Car.\n","title":"driven","headings":["Plot","Cast","Production","Reception","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["4: Sylvester_Stallone","3: Burt_Reynolds","3: Estella_Warren","2: Renny_Harlin","2: Kip_Pardue","2: Til_Schweiger","2: Gina_Gershon","2: Champ_Car","1: Elie_Samaha","1: Cristian_de_la_Fuente","1: Mauro_Fiore","1: Stuart_Levy","1: Franchise_Pictures","1: Warner_Bros.","1: Action_film","1: Drama_film","1: Champ_Car_World_Series","1: Formula_1","1: Cristián_de_la_Fuente","1: Stacy_Edwards","1: Robert_Sean_Leonard","1: Adrian_Fernandez","1: Jacques_Villeneuve","1: Jean_Alesi","1: Juan_Pablo_Montoya","1: Mark_Blundell","1: Roberto_Moreno","1: Kenny_Bräck","1: Tony_Kanaan","1: Formula_One","1: 1997_Italian_Grand_Prix","1: Montreal","1: Canada","1: Matt_Hullum","1: Rooster_Teeth_Productions","1: Grauman's_Chinese_Theatre","1: Hollywood_Blvd","1: Rotten_Tomatoes","1: Jay_Leno","1: Richard_Roeper","1: 22nd_Golden_Raspberry_Awards","1: Golden_Raspberry_Award_for_Worst_Picture","1: Golden_Raspberry_Award_for_Worst_Director","1: Golden_Raspberry_Award_for_Worst_Screenplay","1: Golden_Raspberry_Award_for_Worst_Screen_Couple","1: Golden_Raspberry_Award_for_Worst_Supporting_Actor"]}
