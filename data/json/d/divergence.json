More technically, the divergence represents the volume density\nof the outward flux of a vector field from an infinitesimal volume around a\ngiven point.\n\nFor example, consider air as it is heated or cooled. The relevant vector field\nfor this example is the velocity of the moving air at a point. If air is heated\nin a region it will expand in all directions such that the velocity field points\noutward from that region. Therefore the divergence of the velocity field in that\nregion would have a positive value, as the region is a source. If the air cools\nand contracts, the divergence is negative and the region is called a sink.\n","title":"divergence","headings":["Definition of divergence","Decomposition theorem","Properties","Relation with the exterior derivative","Generalizations","See also","Notes","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["2: Vector_field","2: Divergence_theorem","2: Tensor","2: Laplacian","1: Vector_calculus","1: Vector_operator","1: Current_sources_and_sinks","1: Flux","1: Velocity","1: Surface_integral","1: Cartesian_coordinates","1: Euclidean_space","1: Unit_vector","1: Continuously_differentiable","1: Orthogonal_matrix","1: Dot_product","1: Del","1: Abuse_of_notation","1: Spherical_coordinates","1: Electrodynamics","1: Helmholtz_decomposition","1: Calculus","1: Linear_operator","1: Real_number","1: Product_rule","1: Cross_product","1: Scalar_field","1: Poincaré_lemma","1: Chain_complex","1: De_Rham_cohomology","1: Exterior_derivative","1: Musical_isomorphism","1: Hodge_dual","1: Curvilinear_coordinates#Grad,_curl,_div,_Laplacian","1: Volume_form","1: Density_on_a_manifold","1: Riemannian_manifold","1: Lorentzian_manifold","1: Lie_derivative","1: Levi_Civita_connection","1: Tensors","1: Einstein_notation","1: Contravariant_vector","1: Covariant_derivative","1: Mixed_tensor","1: Del_in_cylindrical_and_spherical_coordinates","1: Gradient"]}
