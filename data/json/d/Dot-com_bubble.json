Galbraith and\nTravis Hale (2004). [http://utip.gov.utexas.edu/papers/utip_27.pdf Income\nDistribution and the Information Technology Bubble]. University of Texas\nInequality Project Working Paper ) was a historic speculative bubble\ncovering roughly 1997 â 2000 (with a climax on March 10, 2000, with the NASDAQ\npeaking at 5132.52 in intraday trading before closing at 5048.62) during which\nstock markets in industrialized nations saw their equity value rise rapidly from\ngrowth in the Internet sector and related fields. While the latter part was a\nboom and bust cycle, the 'Internet boom' is sometimes meant to refer to the\nsteady commercial growth of the Internet with the advent of the World Wide Web,\nas exemplified by the first release of the Mosaic web browser in 1993, and\ncontinuing through the 1990s.\n\nThe period was marked by the founding (and, in many cases, spectacular failure)\nof a group of new Internet-based companies commonly referred to as [[dot-com company|dot-\ncoms]]. Companies were seeing their stock prices shoot up if they simply added\nan \"e-\" prefix to their name and/or a \".com\" to the end, which one author called\n\"prefix investing\".

Some companies, such as\nPets.com, failed completely. Others lost a large portion of their market\ncapitalization but remained stable and profitable, e.g., Cisco, whose stock\ndeclined by 86%. Some later recovered and surpassed their dot-com-bubble peaks,\ne.g., Amazon.com, whose stock went from 107 to 7 dollars per share, but a decade\nlater exceeded 200.\n","linknr":486,"url":"Dot-com_bubble","recorded":1362485795,"links":51,"instances":["author","journalist","financier","capital_beltway","author","web_browser","accounting"],"pdf":["http://utip.gov.utexas.edu/papers/utip_27.pdf","http://web2.ono.ac.il/ShauserPublish/files/2011.1.pdf","http://web2.ono.ac.il/ShauserPublish/files/2011.1.pdf"],"categories":["Economic bubbles","Economic disasters in the United States","E-commerce","History of the Internet","History of the United States (1991–present)","Information technology management","Internet terminology","Online companies|","1990s economic history","1990s fads and trends","2000s economic history","Dot-com bubble|"],"headings":["Bubble growth","Soaring stocks","Free spending","The bubble bursts","Aftermath","List of companies significant to the bubble","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Ambox_globe_content.svg/48px-Ambox_globe_content.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/de/Nasdaq2.png/260px-Nasdaq2.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/Crystal_Clear_app_browser.png/28px-Crystal_Clear_app_browser.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Emblem-money.svg/28px-Emblem-money.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["mosaic","web_browser"],["andrew_smith","author"],["andrew_smith","author"],["interstate_495","capital_beltway"],["profit","accounting"],["fred_wilson","financier"],["david_kuo","author"],["michael_wolff","journalist"]],"members":["david_kuo","michael_wolff","fred_wilson","interstate_495","andrew_smith","mosaic","profit"],"related":["Economic_bubble","NASDAQ_Composite","Stock_markets","Quaternary_sector_of_industry","Boom_and_bust","World_Wide_Web","Mosaic_(web_browser)","Internet","Internet-related_prefixes",".com","Prefix","Speculation","Venture_capital","P/E_ratio","Pets.com","Cisco","Amazon.com","Business_model","Network_effect","Market_share","Mind_share","Stock_market_bubble","Roger_Lowenstein","Penguin_Books","Andrew_Smith_(author)","Andrew_Smith_(author)","Bloomsbury_Books","Wall_Street","Day_trading","Google","Amazon.com","Initial_public_offering","Burn_rate","Business_model","Onomatopoeia","Super_Bowl_XXXIV","Super_Bowl_XXXV","IWon","New_economy","Stock_option","Silicon_Valley","Broadband_access","Fiber_optic","Nortel_Networks","Bankruptcy","Dulles_Technology_Corridor","Interstate_495_(Capital_Beltway)","Mobile_phone","3G","Germany","Italy","United_Kingdom","Cash_flow","Information_technology","Federal_Reserve","NASDAQ_Composite","Bear_market","Findings_of_fact","United_States_federal_courts","Microsoft","Monopoly","Sean_Parker","Venture_capital","Profit_(accounting)","America_Online","Time_Warner","Chief_executive_officer","WorldCom","Accounting_scandals","NorthPoint_Communications","Global_Crossing","JDS_Uniphase","XO_Communications","Covad_Communications","Nortel","Cisco","Corning_Incorporated","Corning_Incorporated","Liquidation","Domain_names","Fraud","U.S._Securities_and_Exchange_Commission","Citigroup","Merrill_Lynch","Amazon.com","EBay","Google","Market_capitalization","Cantor_Fitzgerald","Fred_Wilson_(financier)","Irrational_exuberance","Throughput","Boo.com","Startups.com","E.Digital_Corporation","OTCBB","Freei","Initial_Public_Offering","Internet_service_provider","United_States","Baby_Bob","GeoCities","TheGlobe.com","GovWorks.com","Documentary_film","Pets.com","Open.com","InfoSpace","Lastminute.com","The_Learning_Company","Mattel","Think_Tools_AG","Webvan","MCI_Inc.","Bernard_Ebbers","Xcelera.com","Sweden","Broadcast.com","Mark_Cuban","MicroStrategy","BusinessWeek","Inktomi","Digital_Revolution","E-commerce","The_Long_Tail","South_Sea_Company","Tulip_mania","Techno-utopianism","Technology_hype","Web_2.0","E-learning","Dark_fiber","E-Dreams","SatireWire","Ebay.com","List_of_venture_capital_firms","Financial_crisis_of_2007-2010","Subprime_mortgage_crisis","United_States_housing_bubble","David_Kuo_(author)","Michael_Wolff_(journalist)","BBC"]}
