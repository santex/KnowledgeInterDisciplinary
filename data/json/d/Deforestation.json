[http://dictionaryofforestry.org/dict/term/deforestation SAFnet\nDictionary|Definition For [deforestation]]. Dictionary of forestry.org (2008-07-\n29). Retrieved on 2011-05-15. Examples of deforestation include conversion\nof forestland to farms, ranches, or urban use.\n\nAbout half of the world's original forests had been destroyed by 2011, the\nmajority during the previous 50 years. Since 1990 half of the world's rain\nforests have been destroyed. More than half of the animal and plant species in\nthe world live in tropical forests. [http://www.nat-\nure.org/ourinitiatives/urgentissues/rainforests/rainforests-facts.xml Rainforest\nFacts].\n\n\nThe term deforestation is often misused to describe any activity where all trees\nin an area are removed. However in temperate climates, the removal of all trees\nin an areaâin conformance with sustainable forestry practicesâis correctly\ndescribed as regeneration harvest. [http://dictionaryofforestry.org/dict/te-\nrm/regeneration_cut%28ting%29 SAFe.net Dictionary|Definition For\n[regeneration_cut(ting)]]. Dictionary of forestry.org (2008-08-14).\nRetrieved on 2011-05-15. In temperate mesic climates, natural regeneration\nof forest stands often will not occur in the absence of disturbance, whether\nnatural or anthropogenic. Furthermore, biodiversity after\nregeneration harvest often mimics that found after natural disturbance,\nincluding biodiversity loss after naturally occurring rainforest\ndestruction. Patel-\nWeynand, Toral (2002)\n[http://cedd.org/NCSSF/Documents/Biodiversity%20Paper.logo1.pdf Biodiversity and\nsustainable forestry: State of the science review]. The National Commission on\nScience for Sustainable Forestry, Washington DC\n\nDeforestation occurs for many reasons: trees are cut down to be used or sold as\nfuel (sometimes in the form of charcoal) or timber, while cleared land is used\nas pasture for livestock, plantations of commodities and settlements. The\nremoval of trees without sufficient reforestation has resulted in damage to\nhabitat, biodiversity loss and aridity. It has adverse impacts on\nbiosequestration of atmospheric carbon dioxide. Deforestation has also been used\nin war to deprive an enemy of cover for its forces and also vital resources. A\nmodern example of this was the use of Agent Orange by the United States military\nin Vietnam during the Vietnam War. Deforested regions typically incur\nsignificant adverse soil erosion and frequently degrade into .\n\nDisregard or ignorance of intrinsic value, lack of ascribed value, lax forest\nmanagement and deficient environmental laws are some of the factors that allow\ndeforestation to occur on a large scale. In many countries, deforestation, both\nnaturally occurring and human induced, is an ongoing issue. Deforestation causes\nextinction, changes to climatic conditions, desertification, and displacement of\npopulations as observed by current conditions and in the past through the fossil\nrecord.\n\nAmong countries with a per capita GDP of at least US$4,600, net deforestation\nrates have ceased to increase.
