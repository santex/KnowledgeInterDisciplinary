{"cursor":"9689","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n{{Infobox electronic component\n | component = Sensor photo = photo_caption = Thermocouple sensor for high\n | temperature measurement type = working_principle = invented = first_produced\n | = symbol = pins =\n}}\n\nA 'sensor' (also called 'detector') is a converter that measures a physical\nquantity and converts it into a signal which can be read by an observer or by an\n(today mostly electronic) instrument. For example, a mercury-in-glass\nthermometer converts the measured temperature into expansion and contraction of\na liquid which can be read on a calibrated glass tube. A thermocouple converts\ntemperature to an output voltage which can be read by a voltmeter. For accuracy,\nmost sensors are calibrated against known standards.\n\nSensors are used in everyday objects such as touch-sensitive elevator buttons\n(tactile sensor) and lamps which dim or brighten by touching the base. There\nare also innumerable applications for sensors of which most people are never\naware. Applications include cars, machines, aerospace, medicine, manufacturing\nand robotics.\n\nA sensor is a device which receives and responds to a signal when touched. A\nsensor's sensitivity indicates how much the sensor's output changes when the\nmeasured quantity changes. For instance, if the mercury in a thermometer moves\n1 cm when the temperature changes by 1 Â°C, the sensitivity is 1 cm/Â°C\n(it is basically the slope Dy/Dx assuming a linear characteristic). Sensors that\nmeasure very small changes must have very high sensitivities. Sensors also have\nan impact on what they measure; for instance, a room temperature thermometer\ninserted into a hot cup of liquid cools the liquid while the liquid heats the\nthermometer. Sensors need to be designed to have a small effect on what is\nmeasured; making the sensor smaller often improves this and may introduce other\nadvantages. Technological progress allows more and more sensors to be\nmanufactured on a microscopic scale as microsensors using MEMS technology. In\nmost cases, a microsensor reaches a significantly higher speed and sensitivity\ncompared with macroscopic approaches.\n","linknr":236,"url":"Detector","recorded":1362667798,"links":66,"instances":["mathematics","electronics","metrology","telecommunication","physics"],"pdf":["http://www.mdpi.org/sensors/papers/s7030341.pdf"],"categories":["Measuring instruments","Sensors","Transducers"],"headings":["Classification of measurement errors","Types","Sensors in nature","Biosensor","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/Type_K_and_type_S.jpg/220px-Type_K_and_type_S.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/da/Infrared_Transceiver_Circuit.jpg/220px-Infrared_Transceiver_Circuit.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["standard","metrology"],["proportionality","mathematics"],["sensitivity","electronics"],["sensitivity","electronics"],["dynamics","physics"],["drift","telecommunication"]],"members":["proportionality","sensitivity","standard","drift","dynamics"],"related":["Energy_conversion","Physical_quantity","Electronics","Mercury-in-glass_thermometer","Thermocouple","Voltmeter","Calibration","Standard_(metrology)","Tactile_sensor","Microscopic_scale","Microelectromechanical_systems","Macroscopic","Linear","Logarithm","Proportionality_(mathematics)","Sensitivity_(electronics)","Sensitivity_(electronics)","Bias","Non_linearity","Dynamics_(physics)","Bode_plot","Drift_(telecommunication)","Long_term_drift","Noise","Hysteresis","Digitization","Sampling_frequency","Aliasing","Systematic_error","Random_errors","Calibration","Signal_processing","Sensor_resolution","Digital_display","Accuracy_and_precision","Scanning_tunneling_microscope","Atom","Molecule","Magnetic_field","Gravity","Humidity","Moisture","Oscillation","Electrical_field","Sound","Stretching","Proprioception","Toxin","Nutrient","Pheromone","Glucose","Oxygen","Osmolality","Hormone","Neurotransmitter","Cytokine","Protein","Biosensor","Semipermeable_membrane","Dialysis","Hydrogel","Actuator","Data_acquisition","Data_logger","Machine_olfaction","Nanoelectronics","Nanosensor","Transducer","Wireless_sensor_network"]}
