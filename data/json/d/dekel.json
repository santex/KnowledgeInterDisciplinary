A gar'in group by the\nsame name was formed in the Israeli settlement of Yamit in 1979. However, its\nestablishment on the ground was delayed by the Camp David Accords which meant\nthat Israel had to withdraw from Sinai. The moshav was founded in April 1982 by\nthe Aguda Shitufit ([[Cooperative federation|Co-operative Union]]) with the help\nof the Jewish Agency.\n","title":"dekel","headings":["External links"]},"micro-relation":["2: Eshkol_Regional_Council","1: Agricultural_Union","1: Arecaceae","1: Moshav","1: Israel","1: Hevel_Shalom","1: Negev","1: Egypt","1: Gaza_Strip","1: Nahal_settlement","1: Suez_Crisis","1: Gar'in","1: Israeli_settlement","1: Yamit","1: Camp_David_Accords","1: Sinai","1: Aguda_Shitufit","1: Jewish_Agency_for_Israel"]}
