{"cursor":"7831","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"BUT}} In grammar, a 'conjunction' (abbreviated or ) is a part of speech that\nconnects two words, sentences, phrases or clauses together. A 'discourse\nconnective' is a conjunction joining sentences. This definition may overlap with\nthat of other parts of speech, so what constitutes a \"conjunction\" must be\ndefined for each language. In general, a conjunction is an invariable\ngrammatical particle, and it may or may not stand between the items it conjoins.\n\nThe definition may also be extended to idiomatic phrases that behave as a unit\nwith the same single-word conjunction (as well as, provided that, etc.).\n\nMany students are taught that certain conjunctions (such as \"and\", \"but\", and\n\"so\") should not begin sentences, although authorities such as the [[Chicago\nManual of Style]] state that this teaching has \"no historical or grammatical\nfoundation\".\n","linknr":334,"url":"Discourse_connective","recorded":1362903150,"links":63,"instances":["linguistics","linguistics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Grammar","Parts of speech"],"headings":["Coordinating conjunctions","Correlative conjunctions","Subordinating conjunctions","See also","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["sentence","linguistics"],["complement","linguistics"]],"members":["sentence","complement"],"related":["In","Grammar","A","List_of_glossing_abbreviations","Part_of_speech","Sentence_(linguistics)","Phrase","Clause","Is","Conjunction","Joining","Sentences","Language","Grammatical_particle","Disputes_in_English_grammar","Mnemonic","Correlative","Independent_clause","Dependent_clause","Complementizer","Complement_(linguistics)","Subject–object–verb","Language","Dependent_clause","Main_clause","Japanese_language","Verb","Part_of_speech","Verb","Grammatical_case","Noun","Adpositional_phrase","Asyndeton","Conjunctive_adverb","Conjunctive_mood","Logical_conjunction","On_a_white_bus","Polysyndeton","Relativizer","Serial_comma","Syndeton"]}
