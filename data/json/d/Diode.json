The filament may be bare, or more commonly (as shown here), embedded\n within and insulated from an enclosing cathode]]\n\nIn electronics, a 'diode' is a two-terminal electronic component with an\nasymmetric transfer characteristic, with low (ideally zero) resistance to\ncurrent flow in one direction, and high (ideally infinite) resistance in the\nother. A 'semiconductor diode', the most common type today, is a crystalline\npiece of semiconductor material with a p-n junction connected to two electrical\nterminals. A 'vacuum tube diode' is a vacuum tube with two\nelectrodes, a plate (anode) and heated cathode.\n\nThe most common function of a diode is to allow an electric current to pass in\none direction (called the diode's forward direction), while blocking current in\nthe opposite direction (the reverse direction). Thus, the diode can be viewed as\nan electronic version of a check valve. This unidirectional behavior is called\nrectification, and is used to convert alternating current to direct current,\nincluding extraction of modulation from radio signals in radio receiversâthese\ndiodes are forms of rectifiers.\n\nHowever, diodes can have more complicated behavior than this simple onâoff\naction. Semiconductor diodes begin conducting electricity only if a certain\nthreshold voltage or cut-in voltage is present in the forward direction (a state\nin which the diode is said to be ''forward-biased''). The voltage drop across a\nforward-biased diode varies only a little with the current, and is a function of\ntemperature; this effect can be used as a temperature sensor or voltage\nreference.\n\nSemiconductor diodes' nonlinear currentâvoltage characteristic can be tailored\nby varying the semiconductor materials and doping, introducing impurities into\nthe materials. These are exploited in special-purpose diodes that perform many\ndifferent functions. For example, diodes are used to regulate voltage (Zener\ndiodes), to protect circuits from high voltage surges (avalanche diodes), to\nelectronically tune radio and TV receivers (varactor diodes), to generate radio\nfrequency oscillations (tunnel diodes, Gunn diodes, IMPATT diodes), and to\nproduce light (light emitting diodes). Tunnel diodes exhibit negative\nresistance, which makes them useful in some types of circuits.\n\nDiodes were the first semiconductor electronic devices. The discovery of\ncrystals' rectifying abilities was made by German physicist Ferdinand Braun in\n1874. The first semiconductor diodes, called cat's whisker diodes, developed\naround 1906, were made of mineral crystals such as galena. Today most diodes are\nmade of silicon, but other semiconductors such as germanium are sometimes\nused.\n","linknr":829,"url":"Diode","recorded":1362485497,"links":130,"instances":["semiconductor","semiconductor","electronics","auto","oscillation","electricity","electronics","electricity","electrical_engineering","electronics","music","optics","electricity","radio","electric"],"pdf":["http://www.omega.com/Temperature/pdf/CY7.pdf","http://nobelprize.org/physics/laureates/1928/richardson-lecture.pdf","http://ecee.colorado.edu/~ecen5817/hw/hw1/Diode%20reverse%20recovery%20in%20a%20boost%20converter.pdf","http://ecee.colorado.edu/~ecen5797/course_material/SwLossSlides.pdf","http://digikey.com/Web%20Export/Supplier%20Content/Vishay_8026/PDF/Vishay_CurrentRegulatorDiodes.pdf","http://digikey.com/Web%20Export/Supplier%20Content/Vishay_8026/PDF/Vishay_ClassificationOfComponents.pdf","http://digikey.com/Web%20Export/Supplier%20Content/Vishay_8026/PDF/Vishay_ComponentConstruction.pdf","http://www.ixyspower.com/images/technical_support/Application%20Notes%20By%20Topic/FREDs,%20Schottky%20and%20GaAS%20Diodes/IXAN0044.pdf","http://digikey.com/Web%20Export/Supplier%20Content/Vishay_8026/PDF/Vishay_ProtectingLowCurrentLoads.pdf","http://www.powerguru.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/SEMIKRON_application_manual_power_semiconductors.pdf","http://www.powerguru.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/SEMIKRON_application_manual_power_semiconductors.pdf"],"categories":["Diodes|"],"headings":["History","Thermionic
