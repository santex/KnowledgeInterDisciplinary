{"cursor":"57846","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Dog training' is the process of modifying the behavior of a dog, either for it\nto assist in specific activities or undertake particular tasks, or for it to\nparticipate effectively in contemporary domestic life. While training dogs for\nspecific roles dates back to Roman times at least, the training of dogs to be\ncompatible household pets developed with suburbanisation in the 1950s.\n\nA dog learns from every interaction it has with its environment. Millan\n2010, p. 33. This can be through classical conditioning, where it forms an\nassociation between two stimuli; non-associative learning, where its behavior is\nmodified through habituation or sensitisation; and operant conditioning, where\nit forms an association between a behavior and a consequence.\n\nThere are a variety of established methods of dog training, each with its\nadherents and critics. Some of the better known are the Koehler method, clicker\ntraining, dominance-based training, and relationship-based training. The common\ncharacteristics of successful methods are knowing the dog's attributes and\npersonality, accurate timing of reinforcement and/or punishment and consistent\ncommunication.\n","linknr":656,"url":"Dog_training","recorded":1362891078,"links":44,"instances":["psychology","parrot","dog","dog","psychology"],"pdf":["http://binalunzer.com/Links_files/aversivestimulation.pdf","http://binalunzer.com/Links_files/aversivestimulation.pdf","http://www.avsabonline.org/avsabonline/images/stories/Position_Statements/dominance%20statement.pdf","http://www.avsabonline.org/avsabonline/images/stories/Position_Statements/dominance%20statement.pdf","http://www.landfood.ubc.ca/animalwelfare/publications/pdfs/theses/Orihel_MSc.pdf","http://www.landfood.ubc.ca/animalwelfare/publications/pdfs/theses/Orihel_MSc.pdf"],"categories":["Dog training and behavior|"],"headings":["Definition","History","How dogs learn","Training methods","Factors","Individualized and/or class training","Specialized training","Tools","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/82/Dog_training.jpg/250px-Dog_training.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2a/Rudd_Weatherwax_training_Lassie_circa_1955.JPG/220px-Rudd_Weatherwax_training_Lassie_circa_1955.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/23/Defense.gov_photo_essay_120614-A-KH311-062.jpg/220px-Defense.gov_photo_essay_120614-A-KH311-062.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/Dog_clicker_training.jpg/250px-Dog_clicker_training.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Symbol_book_class2.svg/16px-Symbol_book_class2.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg/16px-Portal-puzzle.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["extinction","psychology"],["alex","parrot"],["tracking","dog"],["bark","dog"],["punishment","psychology"]],"members":["punishment","alex","bark","tracking","extinction"],"related":["Dog","Classical_conditioning","Habituation","Sensitisation","Operant_conditioning","Obedience_training","Police_dog","Search_and_rescue_dog","Hunting_dog","Herding_dog","Assistance_dog","Dog_sports","Detection_dog","Guard_dog","Konrad_Most","Berlin","B.F._Skinner","Marian_Breland_Bailey","Clicker_training","Reinforcement","Konrad_Lorenz","Ethology","William_Koehler","Vicki_Hearne","Blanche_Saunders","Barbara_Woodhouse","United_Kingdom","New_Skete","Ian_Dunbar","Karen_Pryor","Joel_Silverman","Victoria_Stillwell","Reinforcement","Physiology","Psychology","Extinction_(psychology)","Learned_helplessness","Observational_learning","Imitation","Allelomimetic_behavior","Social_facilitation","Clicker_training","Irene_Pepperberg","Alex_(parrot)","Symbolic_interactionism","Labrador_retriever","Explosive","Cocker_Spaniel","Termite","German_Shepherd","Victoria_Stillwell","Ian_Dunbar","Canine_Good_Citizen","Dog_agility","Herding","Tracking_(dog)","Flyball","Detection_dog","Assistance_dog","Hunting_dog","Police_dog","Search_and_rescue_dogs","Guard_dog","Captain_Arthur_Haggerty","Animal_rights","PETA","Sighthounds","Dog_bite_tug","Alpha_roll","Bark_(dog)","Conformation_show","Dog_agility","Dog_sports","List_of_dog_trainers","Obedience_training","Animal_cognition","Animal_training","Ethology","Operant_conditioning","Punishment_(psychology)","Reinforcement","Reward_system"]}
