Besides contesting the accuracy of any allegation made against him or\nher in a criminal or civil proceeding, a defendant may also make allegations\nagainst the prosecutor or plaintiff or raise a defense, arguing that, even if\nthe allegations against the defendant are true, the defendant is nevertheless\nnot liable.\n\nSince a defense is raised by the defendant in a direct attempt to avoid what\nwould otherwise result in liability, the defendant typically holds the burden of\nproof. For example, if a defendant in an assault and battery case attempts to\nclaim provocation, the victim of said assault and battery would not have to\nprove that he did not provoke the plaintiff; the defendant would have to prove\nthat the plaintiff did.\n","linknr":161,"url":"Defense_(legal)","recorded":1362546702,"links":20,"instances":["crime","jurisprudence","legal"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Legal defenses"],"headings":["Civil law defenses","Costs","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/Crystal_Clear_app_kedit.svg/40px-Crystal_Clear_app_kedit.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/Scale_of_justice_2.svg/22px-Scale_of_justice_2.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["battery","crime"],["provocation","legal"],["justification","jurisprudence"]],"members":["battery","justification","provocation"],"related":["Civil_proceeding","Criminal_prosecution","Common_law","Defendant","Legal_liability","Allegation","Legal_burden_of_proof","Assault","Battery_(crime)","Provocation_(legal)","Common_law","Personal_jurisdiction","Subject_matter_jurisdiction","Diplomatic_immunity","Cause_of_action","Pleading","Affirmative_defense","Statute_of_limitations","Statute_of_frauds","Consent","Justification_(jurisprudence)","Right_of_self-defense","Defense_of_property","Legal_financing","Absolute_defence","Lawsuit","Legal_defense_fund","Legal_financing"]}
