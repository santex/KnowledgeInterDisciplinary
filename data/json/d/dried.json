{"cursor":"12148","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n'Drying' is a mass transfer process consisting of the removal of water or\nanother solvent by evaporation from a solid, semi-solid\nor liquid. This process is often used as a final production step before selling\nor packaging products. To be considered \"dried\", the final product must be\nsolid, in the form of a continuous sheet (e.g., paper), long pieces (e.g.,\nwood), particles (e.g., cereal grains or corn flakes) or powder (e.g., sand,\nsalt, washing powder, milk powder). A source of heat and an agent to remove the\nvapor produced by the process are often involved. In bioproducts like food,\ngrains, and pharmaceuticals like vaccines, the solvent to be removed is almost\ninvariably water.\n\nIn the most common case, a gas stream, e.g., air, applies the heat by convection\nand carries away the vapor as humidity. Other possibilities are vacuum drying,\nwhere heat is supplied by conduction or radiation (or microwaves), while the\nvapor thus produced is removed by the vacuum system. Another indirect technique\nis drum drying (used, for instance, for manufacturing potato flakes), where a\nheated surface is used to provide the energy, and aspirators draw the vapor\noutside the room. In contrast, the mechanical extraction of the solvent, e.g.,\nwater, by centrifugation, is not considered \"drying\" but rather \"draining\".\n","linknr":214,"url":"dried","recorded":1362566366,"links":32,"instances":["chemistry","phase_transition"],"pdf":["http://www.mcdtechnologiesinc.com/tang97.pdf"],"categories":["Drying"],"headings":["Drying mechanism","Methods of drying","Applications of drying","References","Sources","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a6/Drying.svg/220px-Drying.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/36/Stockfish_in_Lofoten.jpg/220px-Stockfish_in_Lofoten.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/ChemSepProcDiagram.svg/81px-ChemSepProcDiagram.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["critical_point","chemistry"],["sublimation","phase_transition"]],"members":["critical_point","sublimation"],"related":["Mass_transfer","Solvent","Evaporation","Solid","Semi-solid","Liquid","Heat","Pharmaceuticals","Vaccine","Humidity","Heat_conduction","Radiation","Microwaves","Vacuum","Drum_drying","Centrifugation","Equilibrium_moisture_content","Second_law_of_thermodynamics","Critical_point_(chemistry)","Supercritical_drying","Freeze_drying","Convection","Relative_humidity","Spray_drying","Drum_drying","Freeze_drying","Sublimation_(phase_transition)","Supercritical_drying","Natural_air_drying","Refractance_Window_drying","Infrared_Zone_Drying","Wood_drying"]}
