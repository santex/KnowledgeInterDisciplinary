{"cursor":"8107","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Danyel GÃ©rard' (born 'GÃ©rard Daniel Kherlakian', 7 March 1939, Paris) is a\nFrench pop singer and composer.\n\nGÃ©rard was born in Paris, France to an Armenian father and an Italian mother,\nbut grew up mainly in Rio de Janeiro. In 1953 he returned to Paris and became a\nchoir boy at Notre Dame. Following this he played in the rock and roll band The\nDangers. In 1958 he made his first recordings: \"Viens\" (a cover of the Kalin\nTwins' hit \"When\") and \"D'oÃ¹ reviens-tu Billy Boy\" (adapted from Dorothy\nCollins' \"Where Have You Been, Billy Boy\"), making one of the first young French\nsingers to successfully sing rock and roll (his only rivals at this stage were\nRichard Anthony, Claude Piron (later better known as Danny Boy) and Gabriel\nDalar), although his commercial impact was very limited; despite a latter-day,\nrevisionist recasting of him as the French Elvis Presley, he was\nnevertheless one of France's first rock stars.\n\nAfter cutting a further EP featuring a cover of Don Gibson's \"Oh Lonesome Me\"\n(\"O pauvre moi\") which was buried by a rival version by Sacha Distel and an\nadaptation of the Fraternity Brothers' \"Passion Flower\" (\"Tout l'amour\"), we was\ndrafted and spent from 1959 to 1961 he was a soldier in North Africa.\nSubsequently he was a singer and guitarist in various bistros. On his return, he\nresumed his singing career with the minor 1961 hit \"Oh Marie-Line\" but by then\nhe had been overtaken by newer singers such as Johnny Hallyday. He also began to\nwrite songs, penning tunes for Johnny Hallyday, Sylvie Vartan, Dalida, Richard\nAnthony, German-based star Caterina Valente, actress Marie LaforÃªt and Austrian\nsinger Udo JÃ¼rgens.\n\nAfter enjoying a major hit with the French version of Pat Boone's \"Speedy\nGonzales\" (\"Le petit GonzalÃ¨s\"), despite competition from a version by Dalida,\nin 1963 he became to the first signing to the new Disc AZ label, issuing two\nfurther EPs for them before unleashing his best recording of the period, a\nrevival of Chuck Berry's \"Memphis, Tennessee\". Further hits followed but by the\nmid-sixties his star had waned and he moved into record production, most notably\nfor Michel Corringe. He returned in 1970 with the French hit \"MÃªme un clown\" but\nhis international breakthrough came in 1971 with \"Butterfly\", which\nhe recorded in several languages and which has sold seven million\ncopies. It charted across Europe, reaching #1 in Germany,\nSwitzerland, Sweden, and France, #5 in the Netherlands, and #10 in the\nUK; in the US it peaked at #78. It was awarded a gold disc by the\nRecording Industry Association of America. {{cite book\n| first= Joseph last= Murrells year= 1978 title= The Book of Golden Discs\n| edition= 2nd publisher= Barrie and Jenkins Ltd location= London page= 293\n| isbn= 0-214-20512-6}} It has since became a pop standard, and was also\n| used in the film Die tollen Tanten schlagen zu.\n\nAfter this brief success, he enjoyed several other European hits, including \"Ti-laÃ¯-laÃ¯-\nlaÃ¯ (l'armenien)\", which reflected his Armenian roots, but he never again\nrecorded anything with the same impact as his breakthrough hit. Among the more\ninteresting recordings from this period are his \"AtmosphÃ¨re\" album, which\nincluded both \"Butterfly\" and the funky groover \"Sexologie\", and the follow-up,\nlogically titled \"AtmosphÃ¨re 2\", which featured the hit \"D'AmÃ©rique au coeur du\nJapon\", as well as the late seventies' \"Gone With the Wind\" album, which housed\nthe nostalgic \"Les temps changent\". Alongside his own recordings, he continued\nto dedicate himself to composing music for other artists.\n\nGÃ©rard made a comeback to the live scene with a concert at the Paris Olympia\ntheatre on 20 November 1978. The concert was a sell-out and included a 21-piece\nband and orchestra conducted by French composer and trumpeter, Yvan Julien. A\nfull troupe of circus performers joined GÃ©rard on stage for the finale. Anton\nKaras also performed his composition \"Harry Lime Theme\" from the film, [[The\nThird Man (film)|The Third Man]].\n\nGÃ©rard enjoyed a further major hit in the French pop charts with \"MÃ©lodie\nmÃ©lodie\", taken from his 1978 album of the same name. This led to various\ntelevision and radio appearances in France and Germany. Following the Paris\nOlympia concert, he took the nucleus of the orchestra and formed a seven-piece\nband, Horde, with which he played a number of shows in Paris and the south of\nFrance in 1978 and 1979. He continued to record into the eighties before\nretiring into the shadows to enjoy the benefits of his not inconsiderable\nroyalties.\n","linknr":163,"url":"Danyel_Gérard","recorded":1375070515,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Danyel_G%C3%A9rard&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Danyel_G%C3%A9rard&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Paris","/wiki/France","/wiki/Armenian_people","/wiki/Italian_people","/wiki/Rio_de_Janeiro","/wiki/Choir_boy","/wiki/Notre_Dame_de_Paris","/wiki/Rock_and_roll","/wiki/Kalin_Twins","/wiki/When_(1958_song)","/wiki/Dorothy_Collins","/wiki/Richard_Anthony_(French_singer)","/wiki/Elvis_Presley","#cite_note-1","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Don_Gibson","/wiki/Oh_Lonesome_Me","/wiki/Sacha_Distel","/wiki/North_Africa","/wiki/Bistro","/wiki/Johnny_Hallyday","/wiki/Songwriter","/wiki/Song","/wiki/Johnny_Hallyday","/wiki/Sylvie_Vartan","/wiki/Dalida","/wiki/Richard_Anthony_(French_singer)","/wiki/Caterina_Valente","/wiki/Marie_Lafor%C3%AAt","/wiki/Udo_J%C3%BCrgens","/wiki/Pat_Boone","/wiki/Speedy_Gonzales_(song)","/wiki/Dalida","/wiki/Memphis,_Tennessee_(song)","/wiki/Butterfly_(Danyel_Gerard_song)","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Language","#cite_note-4","/wiki/Record_chart","/wiki/Chart-topper","#cite_note-5","/wiki/Music_recording_sales_certification","/wiki/Recording_Industry_Association_of_America","#cite_note-The_Book_of_Golden_Discs-6","/wiki/Butterfly_(Danyel_Gerard_song)","/wiki/Musician","/wiki/Olympia_(Paris)","/wiki/Anton_Karas","/wiki/Harry_Lime_Theme","/wiki/The_Third_Man_(film)","/w/index.php?title=Danyel_G%C3%A9rard&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","http://books.google.com/books?id=hy0rxkj8bdoC&pg=PA27&dq=%22Danyel+G%C3%A9rard%22+source:%22-newswire%22+source:%22-wire%22+source:%22-presswire%22+source:%22-PR%22+source:%22-press%22+source:%22-release%22+source:%22-wikipedia%22#v=onepage&q=danyel&f=false","/wiki/Berg_Publishers","/wiki/International_Standard_Serial_Number","//www.worldcat.org/issn/185973636X","#cite_ref-2","http://books.google.com/books?id=jp764SaGjTkC&pg=PA70&dq=%22Danyel+G%C3%A9rard%22+source:%22-newswire%22+source:%22-wire%22+source:%22-presswire%22+source:%22-PR%22+source:%22-press%22+source:%22-release%22+source:%22-wikipedia%22#v=onepage&q=danyel&f=false","/wiki/International_Standard_Serial_Number","//www.worldcat.org/issn/1845450205","#cite_ref-3","http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=fr&tl=en&u=http://www.senioractu.com/Danyel-Gerard-sur-la-scene-de-l-Olympia-le-23-juin-dans-la-tournee-Generation-Rock-n-Roll_a7491.html","#cite_ref-4","http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=qOELAAAAIBAJ&sjid=u1cDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4520,2688346&dq=danyel-g%C3%A9rard&hl=en","#cite_ref-5","http://books.google.com/books?id=ejjQUZr2iPcC&pg=RA4-PA428&dq=%22Danyel+G%C3%A9rard%22+source:%22-newswire%22+source:%22-wire%22+source:%22-presswire%22+source:%22-PR%22+source:%22-press%22+source:%22-release%22+source:%22-wikipedia%22#v=onepage&q=&f=false","/wiki/Hal_Leonard_Corporation","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0-87930-808-7","#cite_ref-The_Book_of_Golden_Discs_6-0","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0-214-20512-6","/w/index.php?title=Danyel_G%C3%A9rard&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Number-one_hits_of_1971_(Germany)","/wiki/One-hit_wonders_in_the_UK","/wiki/List_of_French_singers","/wiki/List_of_best-selling_singles_worldwide","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/103114690","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Danyel_Gérard&oldid=553244542","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1939_births","/wiki/Category:Living_people","/wiki/Category:People_from_Paris","/wiki/Category:French_people_of_Armenian_descent","/wiki/Category:French_people_of_Italian_descent","/wiki/Category:French_male_singers","/wiki/Category:French_songwriters","/wiki/Category:French_military_personnel_of_the_Algerian_War","/wiki/Category:Use_dmy_dates_from_May_2011","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Danyel+G%C3%A9rard&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLog
