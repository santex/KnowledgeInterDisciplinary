{"cursor":"4906","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nOriginated in 1994, the 'The Dramatica Theory of Story Structure' is a\ndiagnostic modelling tool built around a concept called âThe Story Mind.â\nAccording to this notion, every story has a mind of its own â its psychology is\nbuilt by the storyâs structure and its personality is determined by the\nstorytelling.\n\nThe theory claims that this model of the mind was developed unintentionally over\ncenturies of storytelling as a by-product of the attempt to communicate\ninformation and emotions across a medium from an author to an audience.\n\nIn this light a story is seen as an argument in which the author, hoping to\nconvince the audience of a point of view, suggests that a particular approach to\nproblem solving is (or is not) better than all others that might reasonably be\ntried in a given situation.\n\nTo successfully make this argument, all other pertinent problem solving\napproaches must be examined in the story as well and shown to fall short of the\none promoted by the author.\n\nIn the process of including all the reasonable ways one might go about solving a\nparticular problem, all universal human points of view, attitudes, and\napproaches must appear for any storyâs argument to be complete.\n\nOver centuries of trial and error storytelling, these human qualities became\nfixed as the conventions of story structure from characters, to theme, to plot.\n\nTherefore, the Dramatic theory sees characters as representing our various\ndrives and motivations, theme is seen as our conflicting value standards, plot\nrepresents our problem solving methods, and genre describes the overall attitude\n(personality type) of the Story Mind itself.\n\nWhile these notions are merely conceptual, the Dramatica theory ultimately\ndeveloped beyond this into a very specific math-based model of psychology. The\nmodel itself is a visual representation of the relationships among dramatic\nelements and the dynamics which drive them.\n\nAppearing not unlike a cross between the Periodic Table of Elements and a three\ndimensional chess set, the Dramatic Table of Story Elements is divided into four\nfamilies: Universe (representing situations), Mind (attitudes), Physics\n(activities) and Psychology (manners of thinking).\n\nThese four families are represented as occupying a square (called a quad)\ndivided into four parts, one family in each corner. The position of each item in\na quad is important because the quad actually represents an equation purported\nby the Dramatica theory to represent the basic building block of thought.\n\nWith the four families at the top, the model extends down three additional\nâlevelsâ, creating a three-dimensional volume in which the storyâs argument\ntakes place and can be charted, analyzed and even predicted.\n\nEach level below the top is continually subdivided into smaller and more refined\ndramatic units. For example, Universe is subdivided into Past, Present, Future,\nand Progress. Each of those smaller units is subdivided as well until at the\nfourth and bottom level of the model, each family contains sixty-four elements.\n\nThe equations used to create the model establish consistent relationships among\ndramatic elements. For example, one of the subdivisions under the Mind family is\nâMemoryâ which falls in the same relative position in its quad to âPastâ in the\nUniverse family. Therefore, Memory is to Mind as Past is to Universe. The entire\nmodel is consistently structured in this manner.\n\nIn addition, the structure is not fixed, but flexible. The Dramatica theory\nuses a series of âdynamic operationsâ to twist and turn the model like a\nRubik's Cube in order to create the dramatic potentials necessary to support an\nauthorâs intent.\n\nIn later years, the ongoing development of Dramatica split into two branches.\nFirst is ongoing exploration into using the model to understand the workings of\nthe human mind itself â an area of research called (by the theory creators)\nMental Relativity. The second area of development is the implementation of the\nmodel as a patented computer program called âThe Story Engineâ which can be used\nto analyze story structures to find holes and inconsistencies and also used to\ninteractively suggest how to fix and fill them.\n\nDramatica theory has been taught at several universities, including the\nUniversity of California at Los Angeles, where the theory creators taught a twelve-\nweek âfor creditâ course for several years.\n\nThe most definitive explanation of the theory can be found in the book,\nDramatica â A New Theory of Story (ISBN 091897304X ISBN 978-0-918973-04-7),\nauthored by the theory co-creators.\n","linknr":103,"url":"Dramatica_Theory_of_Story_Structure","recorded":1374546689,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Dramatica_Theory_of_Story_Structure&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Dramatica_Theory_of_Story_Structure&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:What_Wikipedia_is_not#PUBLISHER","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dramatica_Theory_of_Story_Structure&action=edit","/wiki/Wikipedia:Encyclopedic_style","/wiki/Narrative","/wiki/Psychology","/wiki/Personality_type","/wiki/Storytelling","/wiki/Information","/wiki/Emotion","/wiki/Author","/wiki/Argument","/wiki/Audience","/wiki/Problem_solving","/wiki/Problem","/wiki/Attitude_(psychology)","/wiki/Trial_and_error","/wiki/Plot_(narrative)","/wiki/Motivation","/wiki/Concept","/wiki/Periodic_table","/wiki/Chess","/wiki/Universe","/wiki/Physics","/wiki/Equation","/wiki/Memory","/wiki/Rubik%27s_Cube","/wiki/Human_mind","/wiki/Computer_program","/wiki/University_of_California_at_Los_Angeles","/wiki/Special:BookSources/091897304X","/wiki/Special:BookSources/9780918973047","/w/index.php?title=Dramatica_Theory_of_Story_Structure&action=edit&section=1","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dramatica_Theory_of_Story_Structure&oldid=538325251","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Narratology","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_needing_style_editing_from_November_2009","/wiki/Category:All_articles_needing_style_editing","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Dramatica+Theory+of+Story+Structure&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Dramatica+Theory+of+Story+Structure","/wiki/Dramatica_Theory_of_Story_Structure","/w/index.php?title=Talk:Dramatica_Theory_of_Story_Structure&action=edit&redlink=1","#","/wiki/Dramatica_Theory_of_Story_Structure","/w/index.php?title=Dramatica_Theory_of_Story_Structure&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Dramatica_Theory_of_Story_Structure&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Dramatica_Theory_of_Story_Structure","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Dramatica_Theory_of_Story_Structure","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Dramatica_Theory_of_Story_Structure&oldid=538325251","/w/index.php?title=Dramatica_Theory_of_Story_Structure&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5305768","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Dramatica_Theory_of_Story_Structure&id=538325251","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Dramatica+Theory+of+Story+Structure","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Dramatica+Theory+of+Story+Structure&oldid=538325251&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Dramatica_Theory_of_Story_Structure&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5305768#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dramatica_Theory_of_Story_Structure","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=e
