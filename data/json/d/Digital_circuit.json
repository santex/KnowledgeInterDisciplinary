All\nlevels within a band represent the same signal state. Relatively small changes\nto the analog signal levels due to manufacturing tolerance, signal attenuation\nor parasitic noise do not leave the discrete envelope, and as a result are\nignored by signal state sensing circuitry.\n\nIn most cases the number of these states is two, and they are represented by two\nvoltage bands: one near a reference value (typically termed as \"ground\" or zero\nvolts) and a value near the supply voltage, corresponding to the \"false\" (\"0\")\nand \"true\" (\"1\") values of the Boolean domain respectively.\n\nDigital techniques are useful because it is easier to get an electronic device\nto switch into one of a number of known states than to accurately reproduce a\ncontinuous range of values.\n\nDigital electronic circuits are usually made from large assemblies of logic\ngates, simple electronic representations of Boolean logic functions.\n","linknr":345,"url":"Digital_circuit","recorded":1362668279,"links":51,"instances":["electronics","logic","data","signal_processing_chain","signal","logic","electronics","electronics","electronics","electronics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Digital
