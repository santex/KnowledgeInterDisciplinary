{"cursor":"6201","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The American Petroleum Institute gravity, or 'API gravity', is a measure of how\nheavy or light a petroleum liquid is compared to water. If its API gravity is\ngreater than 10, it is lighter and floats on water; if less than 10, it is\nheavier and sinks. API gravity is thus an inverse measure of the relative\ndensity of a petroleum liquid and the density of water, but it is used to\ncompare the relative densities of petroleum liquids. For example, if one\npetroleum liquid floats on another and is therefore less dense, it has a greater\nAPI gravity. Although mathematically, API gravity has no units (see the formula\nbelow), it is nevertheless referred to as being in \"degrees\". API gravity is\ngradated in degrees on a hydrometer instrument. The API scale was designed so\nthat most values would fall between 10 and 70 API gravity degrees.\n","linknr":157,"url":"Degree_API","recorded":1362565399,"links":47,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.crudemonitor.ca/quickfacts/misc/grades.pdf","http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/2006/3133/pdf/FS2006-3133_508.pdf"],"categories":["Units of density","Physical quantities","Petroleum geology","Petroleum production"],"headings":["History of development","API gravity formulas","Using API gravity to calculate barrels of crude oil per metric ton","Measurement of API gravity from its density","Direct Measurement of API gravity (Hydrometer method)","Classifications or grades","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/math/b/e/5/be5b5fd4cbc6b5c8d5a793c1a66601f2.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/3/2/3/323a5416832e31ec4be3f39bcaa5f770.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/a/1/d/a1d99039de84af13b3d9ee4b124beeb4.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/6/c/86cb58f858cc289522d2b14b0c9294dd.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/a/b/fab8acf4057f41a3257f3dd4f362a8ed.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["American_Petroleum_Institute","Petroleum","List_of_crude_oil_products","National_Bureau_of_Standards","Baum√©_scale","Specific_gravity","Density_of_water","Salinity","American_Petroleum_Institute","Petroleum","Specific_gravity","Petroleum","West_Texas_Intermediate","Density","Hydrometer","ASTM","Oscillating_U-tube","Meniscus","Petroleum_Measurement_Tables","Crude_oil","Light_crude_oil","Heavy_crude_oil","United_States_Geological_Survey","Extra_heavy_oil","Bitumen","Oil_sands","Synthetic_crude","Density","Specific_gravity","Specific_weight"]}
