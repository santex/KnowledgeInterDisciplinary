With a population of 156,561 in 2012, it is the fourth-\nlargest city in Scotland. It lies within the eastern central Lowlands on the\nnorth bank of the Firth of Tay, which feeds into the North Sea. Under the name\nof Dundee City, it forms one of the 32 council areas used for local government\nin Scotland.\n\nThe town developed into a burgh in Medieval times, and expanded rapidly in the\n19th century largely due to the jute industry. This, along with its other major\nindustries gave Dundee its epithet as the city of \"jute, jam and journalism\".\n\nIn mid-2012, the population of the City of Dundee was estimated to be 156,561.\nDundee's recorded population reached a peak of 182,204 at the time of the 1971\ncensus, but has since declined.\n\nToday, Dundee is promoted as 'One City, Many Discoveries' in honour of Dundee's\nhistory of scientific activities and of the RRS ''Discovery'', Robert Falcon\nScott's Antarctic exploration vessel, which was built in Dundee and is now\nberthed in the city harbour. Biomedical and technological industries have\narrived since the 1980s, and the city now accounts for 10% of the United\nKingdom's digital-entertainment industry. Dundee has two universities—the\nUniversity of Dundee and the University of Abertay Dundee. A £1,000,000,000\nmaster plan to regenerate and to reconnect the Waterfront to the city centre\nwhich started in 2001 is expected to be completed within a 30 year period, with\nthe Dundee Victoria & Albert Museum opening by 2015, at a cost of £45 million.\n\nDundee is also known for the Dandy, the Beano, Desperate Dan, Oor Wullie, and\nwas said to be built on the 'three Js': jam, jute, and journalism. There is a\nnew Victoria and Albert Museum to be built on waterfront near the Tay Bridge on\na plot vacated by the soon-to-be-replaced public swimming baths. Visitors\nwishing to orient themselves should consider taking a walk (or drive) up the\nLaw, Dundee which offers a 360 degree uninterrupted view of Dundee, the Tay\nestuary and the two Tay Bridges.\n","title":"dundee","headings":["History","Governance","Geography","Demography","Economy","Landmarks","Transport","Education","Religious sites","Culture","Sports and Recreation","Public
