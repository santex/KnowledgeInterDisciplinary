The title comes from French duc, itself from the Latin [[dux]],\n'leader', a term used in republican Rome to refer to a military commander\nwithout an official rank (particularly one of Germanic or Celtic origin), and\nlater coming to mean the leading military commander of a province.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages the title signified first among the Germanic monarchies.\nDukes were the rulers of the provinces and the superiors of the counts in the\ncities and later, in the feudal monarchies, the highest-ranking peers of the\nking. A duke may or may not be, ipso facto, a member of the nation's peerage: in\nthe United Kingdom and Spain all dukes are/were also peers of the realm, in\nFrance some were and some were not, while the term is not applicable to dukedoms\nof other nations, even where an institution similar to the peerage (e.g.,\nGrandeeship, Imperial Diet, Hungarian House of Magnates) existed.\n\nDuring the 19th century many of the smaller German and Italian states were ruled\nby Dukes or Grand Dukes. But presently, with the exception of the Grand Duchy of\nLuxembourg, there are no ruling dukes. Duke remains the highest hereditary title\n(aside from titles borne by the reigning or formerly reigning dynasty) in\nPortugal, Scandinavia, Spain and the United Kingdom. The Pope, as a temporal\nsovereign, has also, though rarely, granted the title of Duke or Duchess to\npersons for services to the Holy See. In some realms the relative status of\n\"duke\" and \"prince\", as titles borne by the nobility rather than by members of\nreigning dynasties, varied, e.g. in Italy and the Netherlands.\n\nA woman who holds in her own right the title to such duchy or dukedom, or is the\nwife of a duke, is normally styled 'duchess'. Queen Elizabeth II, however, is\nknown by tradition as Duke of Normandy in the Channel Islands and Duke of\nLancaster in Lancashire.\n","title":"duke","headings":["Duchy versus dukedom","Middle
