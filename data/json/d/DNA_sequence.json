{"cursor":"16468","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" molecule. Each codon consists of three nucleotides, usually representing a\n single amino acid.]]\n\nA 'nucleic acid sequence' is a succession of letters that indicate the order of\nnucleotides within a DNA (using GACT) or RNA (GACU) molecule. By convention,\nsequences are usually presented from the 5' end to the 3' end. Because nucleic\nacids are normally linear (unbranched) polymers, specifying the sequence is\nequivalent to defining the covalent structure of the entire molecule. For this\nreason, the nucleic acid sequence is also termed the primary structure.\n\nThe sequence has capacity to represent information. Biological DNA represents\nthe information which directs the functions of a living thing. In that context,\nthe term 'genetic sequence' is often used. Sequences can be read from the\nbiological raw material through DNA sequencing methods.\n\nNucleic acids also have a secondary structure and tertiary structure. Primary\nstructure is sometimes mistakenly referred to as primary sequence. Conversely,\nthere is no parallel concept of secondary or tertiary sequence.\n","linknr":368,"url":"DNA_sequence","recorded":1362508981,"links":36,"instances":["genetics","genetics","molecular_biology","medicine","genetics","molecular_biology","molecular_biology","genetics","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["DNA"],"headings":["Nucleotides","Biological significance","Sequence determination","Sequence analysis","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/RNA-codons.png/220px-RNA-codons.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/RNA_chemical_structure.GIF/220px-RNA_chemical_structure.GIF","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/94/Kooditabel.png/200px-Kooditabel.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/DNA_sequence.svg/268px-DNA_sequence.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/11/AMY1gene.png/370px-AMY1gene.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["directionality","molecular_biology"],["transcription","biology"],["complementarity","molecular_biology"],["sense","molecular_biology"],["translation","genetics"],["cell","biology"],["translation","genetics"],["transcription","genetics"],["complementarity","molecular_biology"],["sense","molecular_biology"],["treatment","medicine"],["conservation","genetics"],["coalescence","genetics"]],"members":["coalescence","transcription","complementarity","treatment","conservation","directionality","sense","translation","cell"],"related":["Nucleotide","Amino_acid","Nucleotides","DNA","RNA","Polymers","Primary_structure","Information","DNA_sequencing","Secondary_structure","Tertiary_structure","Phosphate","Sugar","Ribose","RNA","Deoxyribose","DNA","Nucleobase","Base_pair","Nucleic_acid_secondary_structure","Nucleic_acid_tertiary_structure","Nucleic_acid_double_helix","Nucleotide","Nucleobase","Adenine","Cytosine","Guanine","Thymine","Covalent","Phosphodiester_bond","Directionality_(molecular_biology)","Transcription_(biology)","Complementarity_(molecular_biology)","Sense_(molecular_biology)","IUPAC","5-Methylcytidine","7-methylguanosine","Hypoxanthine","Xanthine","Mutagen","Adenine","Guanine","Cytosine","Uracil","Nucleic_acid","Translation_(genetics)","Amino_acid","Protein","Cell_(biology)","Protein","Nucleobase","Translation_(genetics)","Amino_acid","Codon","Genetic_code","Central_dogma_of_molecular_biology","DNA","Transcription_(genetics)","MRNA","Ribosome","Complementarity_(molecular_biology)","Sense_(molecular_biology)","Nucleotide","DNA","Research","Medicine","Diagnosis","Treatment_(medicine)","Genetic_disease","Pathogens","Biotechnology","Reverse_transcriptase","RNA_editing","DNA_methylation","Polymerase_chain_reaction","Sequence_database","Artificial_gene_synthesis","Bioinformatics","Genome","Medical_diagnosis","Disease","Ancestry","Gene","Human_genome","Chromosome","Biochemical","Genetic_disease","DNA","RNA","Protein","Structural_biology","Evolution","Point_mutation","Indel","Amino_acid","Conservation_(genetics)","Sequence_motif","Side_chain","Nucleotide","Computational_phylogenetics","Phylogenetic_tree","Most_recent_common_ancestor","Molecular_clock","Coalescence_(genetics)","Natural_selection","DNA_repair","Silent_mutation","Codon","Amino_acid","SnoRNA","LSm","U1_spliceosomal_RNA","U2_spliceosomal_RNA","U4_spliceosomal_RNA","U5_spliceosomal_RNA","U6_spliceosomal_RNA","U12_minor_spliceosomal_RNA","Small_nucleolar_RNA_U3","Shine-Dalgarno_sequence","Kozak_consensus_sequence","RNA_polymerase_III","Single-nucleotide_polymorphism"]}
