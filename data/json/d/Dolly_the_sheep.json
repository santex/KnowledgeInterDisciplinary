She was cloned by Ian\nWilmut, Keith Campbell and colleagues at the Roslin Institute and the\nbiotechnology company PPL Therapeutics near Edinburgh in Scotland. The funding\nfor Dolly's cloning was provided by PPL Therapeutics and the Ministry of\nAgriculture. She was born on 5 July 1996 and she lived until the age\nof six, at which point she died from a progressive lung disease. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/2764039.stm \"Dolly the sheep\nclone dies young\"], BBC News, Friday, 14 February 2003 She has been called\n\"the world's most famous sheep\" by sources including BBC News and [[Scientific\nAmerican]]. The cell used as the donor for the cloning of\nDolly was taken from a mammary gland, and the production of a healthy clone\ntherefore proved that a cell taken from a specific part of the body could\nrecreate a whole individual. On Dolly's name, Wilmut stated \"Dolly is derived\nfrom a mammary gland cell and we couldn't think of a more impressive pair of\nglands than Dolly Parton's\".\n","linknr":375,"url":"Dolly_the_sheep","recorded":1362480674,"links":63,"instances":["sheep","biologist","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["1996 animal births","2003 animal deaths","1996 in Scotland","Cloned sheep","Cloning","Collections of the National Museums of Scotland","History of Midlothian","Dolly Parton"],"headings":["Birth","Life","Death","Legacy","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/Padlock-silver.svg/20px-Padlock-silver.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6e/Dolly_face_closeup.jpg/220px-Dolly_face_closeup.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8c/Dolly_clone.svg/250px-Dolly_clone.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cell","biology"],["keith_campbell","biologist"],["finnish_dorset","sheep"]],"members":["finnish_dorset","keith_campbell","cell"],"related":["Sheep","Lung_disease","Arthritis","National_Museum_of_Scotland","Dolly_Parton","Domestic_sheep","Mammal","Cloning","Somatic_cell","Cell_(biology)","Nuclear_transfer","Ian_Wilmut","Keith_Campbell_(biologist)","Roslin_Institute","Edinburgh","BBC_News","Mammary_gland","Dolly_Parton","Somatic_cell_nuclear_transfer","Cell_nucleus","Oocyte","Cell_nucleus","Blastocyst","Cellular_differentiation","Totipotency","Welsh_Mountain_sheep","Arthritis","Anti-inflammatory","Animal_euthanasia","Finnish_Dorset_(sheep)","Jaagsiekte","Retrovirus","JSRV","Telomeres","Ageing","Horse","Bull","Argali","Banteng","Mouflon","Extinction","Zaragoza","Pyrenean_ibex","Genetically_modified_organism"]}
