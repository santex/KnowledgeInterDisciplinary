{"cursor":"3717","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nIn common parlance, a 'devil's advocate' is someone who, given a certain\nargument, takes a position he or she does not necessarily agree with, for the\nsake of debate. In taking this position, the individual taking on the devil's\nadvocate role seeks to engage others in an argumentative discussion process. The\npurpose of such process is typically to test the quality of the original\nargument and identify weaknesses in its structure, and to use such information\nto either improve or abandon the original, opposing position. It can also refer\nto someone who takes a stance that is seen as unpopular or unconventional, but\nis actually another way of arguing a much more conventional stance.\n","linknr":146,"url":"Devil's_advocate","recorded":1362666932,"links":36,"instances":["catholic_church"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Sainthood","Legal professions","Canon law (Catholic Church)","English idioms"],"headings":["Origin","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/12px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["canon_law","catholic_church"]],"members":["canon_law"],"related":["Parlance","Argument","For_the_sake_of_argument","Canonization","Roman_Catholic_Church","Latin","Canon_law_(Catholic_Church)","Canonization","Skepticism","Miracle","Pope_Sixtus_V","Pope_John_Paul_II","Beatification","Pope","Aroup_Chatterjee","Christopher_Hitchens","Mother_Teresa","Pro_bono_publico","Dialectic","Polemic","Roman_Rota","Lawsuits_against_the_Devil"]}
