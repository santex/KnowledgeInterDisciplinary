It\nis represented mathematically by the Hamiltonian for the system having more than\none linearly independent eigenstate with the same eigenvalue. Conversely, an\nenergy level is said to be degenerate if it contains two or more different\nstates. The number of different states at a particular energy level is called\nthe level's degeneracy, and this phenomenon is generally known as a 'quantum\ndegeneracy'.\n\nFrom the perspective of quantum statistical mechanics, several degenerate states\nat the same level are all equally probable of being filled.\n","linknr":135,"url":"Degenerate_orbitals","recorded":1362477513,"links":28,"instances":["mathematics","quantum_mechanics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Quantum mechanics"],"headings":["Mathematics","Examples","Perturbation","See also","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["hamiltonian","quantum_mechanics"],["dimension","mathematics"]],"members":["dimension","hamiltonian"],"related":["Quantum_mechanics","Physics","Quantum_states","Energy_level","Hamiltonian_(quantum_mechanics)","Linear_independence","Eigenstate","Eigenvalue","Quantum_statistical_mechanics","Point_spectrum","Eigenstate","Eigenvalue","Scalar_multiplication","Eigenspace","Dimension_(mathematics)","Bra-ket_notation","Atomic_physics","Electron","Symmetry","Hydrogen_atom","Perturbation_theory","Magnetic_field","Electric_field","Energy_level_splitting","Density_of_states"]}
