{"cursor":"12423","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nIn criminal law, 'diminished responsibility' (or 'diminished capacity') is a\npotential defense by excuse by which defendants argue that although they broke\nthe law, they should not be held fully criminally liable for doing so, as their\nmental functions were \"diminished\" or impaired. The defense's acceptance in\nAmerican jurisdictions varies considerably. The majority of states have adopted\nit by statute or case decision, and a minority even recognise broader defenses\nsuch as 'irresistible impulse'. Some American states restrict the defense to the\ncharge of murder only where a successful defense will result in a manslaughter\nconviction instead of murder. Until recently, the Republic of Ireland did not\naccept the partial defense. The Irish Supreme Court had rejected the existence\nof the defense in The People (DPP) v Joseph O' Mahony [1984] ILRM 244. The case\nwas recently abrogated, however, by enactment of the Criminal Law (Insanity) Act\n2006, effective June 1, 2006. The act, in pertinent part, specifically adopted\nthe partial defense for the charge of murder where a successful defense will\nresult in a manslaughter conviction instead of murder.\n\nDiminished capacity is a partial defense to charges that require that the\ndefendant act with a particular state of mind. See e.g., State v. Shank, 322\nN.C. 243, 367 S.E.2d 639 (1988) and State v. Gerald, 304 N.C. 511, 284 S.E.2d\n312, (1981) For example, first degree murder requires that the state prove\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant acted with premeditation,\ndeliberation and the specific intent to kill - all three are necessary elements\nof the state's case. State v. Shank, 322 N.C. 243, 367 S.E.2d 639\n(1988) If evidence exists, sufficient to create a reasonable doubt as to\nwhether the defendant because of mental illness or \"defect\" possessed the\ncapacity to premeditate, deliberate or form the specific intent to kill then the\nstate cannot convict the defendant of first degree murder. See generally,\nJohn Rubin, The Diminished Capacity Defense, Administration of Justice Bulletin,\nNorth Carolina School of Government 1989. This does not mean that the\ndefendant is entitled to an acquittal. The defendant still might be convicted of\nsecond degree murder which only requires that the defendant act with general\nmalice. Malice means that the defendant acted with one of three \"man-\nendangering\" states of mind: intent to kill, intent to inflict serious bodily\ninjury or with a \"depraved\" heart. Although malice thus required a specific\nstate of mind courts have not considered this fact as making second degree\nmurder a specific intent crime. The defense is to be contrasted with\ninsanity which is a complete but affirmative defense. In most jurisdictions a\ndefendant would be acquitted on the grounds of insanity if the defendant\nestablished to the satisfaction of the jury that he suffered from such a mental\ndisease or defect that he was unable to appreciate the consequences of his\nactions or did not know what he was doing was wrong. See e.g., State v.\nSilvers, 323 N.C. 646, 655, 374 S.E.2d 858, 864 (1989) As noted a\nsuccessful insanity defense will result in acquittal although a number of\njurisdictions have adopted the guilty but insane verdict. The defense of\ninsanity and diminished capacity although clearly distinct are not inconsistent\ndefenses and both may be at issue in the same case. See e.g., State v. Rose,\n323 N.C. 455, 373 S.E.2d 426 (1988) The critical distinctions are that\ndiminished capacity is a partial, negating defense (negates an element of the\nstate's case) with the burden on the state to show that the defendant acted with\nthe requisite state of mind while insanity is a complete but affirmative defense\n- the defendant bearing the burden of proving that he was legally insane.\n","linknr":201,"url":"Diminished_responsibility","recorded":1363504212,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Diminished_responsibility&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Diminished_responsibility&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/Responsibility_(disambiguation)","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Diminished_responsibility&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Template:Citation_needed","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/Category:Criminal_defenses","/wiki/Common_law","/wiki/Insanity_defense","/wiki/Immunity_from_prosecution","/wiki/Mental_disorder_defence","/wiki/Intoxication_defense","/wiki/Defense_of_infancy","/wiki/Automatism_(law)","/wiki/Alibi","/wiki/Consent_(criminal_law)","/wiki/Mistake_(criminal_law)","/wiki/Duress","/wiki/Necessity","/wiki/Provocation_(legal)","/wiki/Right_of_self-defense","/wiki/False_confession","/wiki/Entrapment","/wiki/Criminal_law","/wiki/Criminal_procedure","/wiki/Common_law","/wiki/Criminal_law","/wiki/Contract_law","/wiki/Tort_law","/wiki/Property_law","/wiki/Will_(law)","/wiki/Trusts_and_estates","/wiki/Evidence_(law)","/wiki/Portal:Law","/wiki/Portal:Criminal_justice","/wiki/Template:Criminal_defenses","/wiki/Template_talk:Criminal_defenses","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Criminal_defenses&action=edit","/wiki/Criminal_law","/wiki/Defense_(legal)","/wiki/Excuse","/wiki/Defendant","/wiki/Law","/wiki/Crime","/wiki/Legal_liability","/wiki/Irresistible_impulse","/wiki/Repeal","#cite_note-1","#cite_note-2","#cite_note-3","#cite_note-4","#cite_note-5","#cite_note-6","#Discussion","#English_law","#Scottish_law","#Australia_and_India","#See_also","#Notes","#References","/w/index.php?title=Diminished_responsibility&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Insanity_defense","/wiki/M%27Naghten_Rules","/wiki/Columbia_Law_Review","/wiki/Scotland","/wiki/Common_law","/wiki/Punishment","/wiki/Murder","/wiki/Capital_punishment","/wiki/Intelligence_(trait)","/wiki/Punishment","/wiki/Society","/wiki/Jurisdiction","/wiki/Guilt_(law)","/wiki/Manslaughter","/wiki/Sentence_(law)","/wiki/California","http://myweb.wvnet.edu/~jelkins/lawpsy04/diminished.html","/wiki/Ballot_initiative","/wiki/Dan_White","/wiki/Moscone-Milk_assassinations","/wiki/Voluntary_manslaughter","/wiki/Murder","/wiki/Urban_legend","/wiki/Junk_food","/wiki/Twinkie_defense","#cite_note-Myth-7","#cite_note-8","#cite_note-Myth-7","/wiki/California_Penal_Code","/wiki/Irresistible_impulse","#cite_note-9","/w/index.php?title=Diminished_responsibility&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Diminished_responsibility_in_English_law","/w/index.php?title=Diminished_responsibility&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/Robert_Munro,_1st_Baron_Alness","/wiki/Scottish_Law_Commission","#cite_note-10","/w/index.php?title=Diminished_responsibility&action=edit&section=4","http://www.lawcom.gov.uk/docs/cp173apps.pdf","/w/index.php?title=Diminished_responsibility&action=edit&section=5","/wiki/Settled_insanity","/wiki/Mental_disorder_defence","/wiki/Insanity_defense","/wiki/Intoxication_defence","/wiki/Diminished_capacity_in_United_States_law","/w/index.php?title=Diminished_responsibility&action=edit&section=6","#cite_ref-1","#cite_ref-2","#cite_ref-3","#cite_ref-4","#cite_ref-5","#cite_ref-6","#cite_ref-Myth_7-0","#cite_ref-Myth_7-1","http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2003/11/23/INGRE343501.DTL&hw=twinkie+defense&sn=001&sc=1000","/wiki/San_Francisco_Chronicle","http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2003/11/23/INGRE343501.DTL&hw=twinkie+defense&sn=001&sc=1000","#cite_ref-8","http://www.snopes.com/legal/twinkie.htm","#cite_ref-9","http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=pen&group=00001-01000&file=25-29","/wiki/California_Penal_Code","http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=pen&group=00001-01000&file=25-29","#cite_ref-10","http://www.scotlawcom.gov.uk/downloads/rep195.pdf","/w/index.php?title=Diminished_responsibility&action=edit&section=7","http://www.scotlawcom.gov.uk/downloads/dp122_insanity.pdf","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Diminished_responsibility&oldid=
