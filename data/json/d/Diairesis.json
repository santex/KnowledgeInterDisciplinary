What Socrates laid down\nas a principle of knowledge, Plato enunciates as a principle of Being; the\nSocratic concept, which was epidemiological, is succeeded by the Platonic Idea,\nwhich is a metaphysical notion. Socrates taught that knowledge through concepts\nis the only true knowledge; therefore, concludes Plato, the concept, or the\nIdea, is the only true reality. Thus, for Plato, philosophy is the science of\nthe Idea, or, as we should say, of the unconditioned basis of phenomena.\n\nDiaeresis is a method of definition based on partitition which occurs in the\nPlatonic dialogues [[Phaedrus (Plato)|Phaedrus]], [[Sophist\n(dialogue)|Sophist]], [[Statesman (dialogue)|Statesman]] and [[Philebus]]. It is\na means of reaching a definition by which a large group is continually divided\ninto relatively equal parts until the definition has been found.\n\nA complementary term is merismos (cf. English merism: parsing or the\ndistinguishing of parts, as opposed to diairesis, which is the division of a\ngenus into its parts).\n\nFor example, in the Sophist (Â§235B), the Eleatic Stranger is examining\nillusions, which consist of words and \"visual objects.\" By using diaeresis, he\ndivides visual objects, by which it becomes clear he means works of art, into\ntwo categories: eikastikÄ [[technÄ]], the art of making likenesses or eikones;\nand phantastikÄ technÄ, the art of creating illusionary appearances. The\nStranger is much more fond of the former; the latter are only created to produce\nan appearance of beauty.\n","linknr":220,"url":"Diairesis","recorded":1362584100,"links":18,"instances":["philosopher","philosopher"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Stoicism","Rhetorical techniques","Definition","Philosophical concepts","Philosophical methodology"],"headings":["The method of ''diairesis'' in the history of philosophy","Notes","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["alcinous","philosopher"],["porphyry","philosopher"]],"members":["alcinous","porphyry"],"related":["Ancient_Greek","Platonic_philosophy","Stoic_philosophy","Definition","Merism","Homer","Hans_Leisegang","Hans_Herter","Prodicus","John_Lloyd_Ackrill","Democritus","Leucippus","Julius_Stenzel","Sophism","Richard_Robinson","Aristotle","Theophrastus","Speusippus","Xenocrates","Peripatetic_school","Aristotle","Aristoxenus","Theophrastus","Stoicism","Chrysippus","Middle_Platonism","Alcinous_(philosopher)","Maximus_of_Tyre","Philo","Neoplatonism","Plotinus","Porphyry_(philosopher)","Stanford_Encyclopedia_of_Philosophy"]}
