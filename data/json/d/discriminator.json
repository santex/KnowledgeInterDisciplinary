Here is an example\nof IDL union type definition:\n\n<pre> union Register switch (char) { case 'a': case 'b': short AX;\n\n    case 'c': long EAX;\n\n    default: octet AL; }; </pre>\n\nEffective value of the Register type may contain AX as selected field, but\ndiscriminator value may be either 'a' or 'b' and it is stored in memory\nseparately. Therefore, IDL logically separates information about currently\nselected field name and union effective value from information about current\ndiscriminator value. In the example above, discriminator value may be anything\nof the following: 'a', 'b', 'c', as well as all other characters belonging to\nthe IDL <code>char</code> type, since the <code>default</code> branch specified\nin the example Register type allows use of the remaining characters as well.\n","title":"discriminator","headings":["Other languages","References"]},"micro-relation":["1: Object_Management_Group","1: Interface_description_language","1: Tagged_union","1: Microsoft_Interface_Definition_Language","1: Java_annotation"]}
