{"cursor":"22690","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n ligand (brown) to a protein receptor (green) to produce a complex.]] docked to\n a protein.]]\n\nIn the field of molecular modeling, 'docking' is a method which predicts the\npreferred orientation of one molecule to a second when bound to each other to\nform a stable complex. Knowledge of the preferred\norientation in turn may be used to predict the strength of association or\nbinding affinity between two molecules using for example scoring functions.\n\nThe associations between biologically relevant molecules such as proteins,\nnucleic acids, carbohydrates, and lipids play a central role in signal\ntransduction. Furthermore, the relative orientation of the two interacting\npartners may affect the type of signal produced (e.g., agonism vs antagonism).\nTherefore docking is useful for predicting both the strength and type of\nsignal produced.\n\nDocking is frequently used to predict the binding orientation of small\nmolecule drug candidates to their protein targets in order to in turn predict\nthe affinity and activity of the small molecule. Hence docking plays an\nimportant role in the rational design of drugs.\nGiven the biological and pharmaceutical significance of molecular docking,\nconsiderable efforts have been directed towards improving the methods used to\npredict docking.\n","linknr":350,"url":"Docking_(molecular)","recorded":1362509762,"links":21,"instances":["biochemistry","chemistry","chemistry","pharmacology","molecular","biochemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Molecular modelling","Computational chemistry","Protein structure","Medicinal chemistry","Bioinformatics","Drug discovery"],"headings":["Definition of problem","Docking approaches","Mechanics of docking","Applications","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2b/Docking.gif/340px-Docking.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/80/Docking.jpg/340px-Docking.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["ligand","biochemistry"],["receptor","biochemistry"],["binding","molecular"],["antagonist","pharmacology"],["force_field","physics"],["force_field","chemistry"],["antagonism","chemistry"]],"members":["receptor","force_field","antagonism","antagonist","binding","ligand"],"related":["Ligand_(biochemistry)","Protein","Receptor_(biochemistry)","Protein","Molecular_modeling","Binding_(molecular)","Supramolecular_chemistry","Scoring_functions_for_docking","Proteins","Nucleic_acids","Carbohydrates","Lipids","Signal_transduction","Agonist","Antagonist_(pharmacology)","Small_molecule","Drug","Rational_drug_design","Pharmaceutical","Molecular_recognition","Gibbs_free_energy","Van_der_Waals_surface","Complementary_surface","Solvent-accessible_surface_area","X-ray_crystallography","Protein_NMR","Search_algorithm","Molecular_mechanics","Candidate_solution","Chemical_conformation","Flight_dynamics","Granularity","Stochastic","Dihedral_angle","Molecular_dynamics","Genetic_algorithm","Force_field_(physics)","Molecular_mechanics","Force_field_(chemistry)","Protein_Data_Bank","X-ray_crystallography","False_positive","Small_molecule","Enzyme","Enzyme_inhibitor","Agonist","Antagonism_(chemistry)","Drug_design","Organic_compound","Scoring_functions_for_docking","In_silico","Virtual_screening","Bioremediation","Drug_design","Katchalski-Katzir_algorithm","List_of_molecular_graphics_systems","Macromolecular_docking","Molecular_mechanics","Protein_structure","Protein_design","List_of_software_for_molecular_mechanics_modeling","Molecular_design_software","Docking@Home","Ibercivis","ZINC_database","AutoDock","DOCK","Lead_Finder"]}
