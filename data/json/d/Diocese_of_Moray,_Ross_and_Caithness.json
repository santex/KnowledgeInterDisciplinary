It covers Caithness and Sutherland (the old Diocese of\nCaithness), mainland Ross and Cromarty (the old Diocese of Ross), and mainland\nInverness-shire, Nairnshire, Moray and Banffshire (the old Diocese of Moray).\nThe diocesan centre is St. Andrew's Cathedral in Inverness. The see is currently\noccupied by the Right Reverend Mark Strange.\n\nThe three old dioceses united in the modern diocese were all founded during the\n12th century. Moray was founded by Bishop Gregory in 1114, Ross by Bishop\nMacbeth in 1131 and Caithness by Bishop Andrew in 1146. Being more removed from\nthe centre of political power during the Scottish Reformation, each of the\ndioceses managed to continue an unbroken line of bishops. However, its\nremoteness also caused problems for the appointment of new bishops under the\nperiod of the penal laws. For part of the 17th century, both Ross and Caithness\nwere without a bishop, and, at the beginning of the 18th century, the Diocese of\nOrkney was united with Caithness. In 1707, Alexander Rose, Bishop of Edinburgh\nand the first Primus, united Moray with his diocese for reason of practical\noversight. John Fullarton, Rose's successor in both roles, continued to oversee\nMoray until 1725, when it was felt more practical to combine it with the Diocese\nof Aberdeen, led by James Gadderar. However, in 1727, the new Primus, Andrew\nLumsden, appointed William Dunbar as sole Bishop of Moray and Ross, combining\nthe vacant northern see with Moray. In 1777, William Falconar, also Primus,\nunited Orkney, Moray, Ross and Caithness under his rule. In 1819, David Low was\nappointed Bishop of Ross by itself, but, from 1838 he administered the entire\nformer union and the see officially returned to the union in 1851. In 1857,\nOrkney was separated to unite with the Diocese of Aberdeen. Revd Mark Strange\nwas elected as the new bishop on 2 June 2007 and was consecrated and installed\non 13 October 2007.\n","linknr":156,"url":"Diocese_of_Moray,_Ross_and_Caithness","recorded":1375066440,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Diocese_of_Moray,_Ross_and_Caithness&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Diocese_of_Moray,_Ross_and_Caithness&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system","//tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Diocese_of_Moray,_Ross_and_Caithness&params=57.477_N_-4.231_E_region:GB_scale:200000","/wiki/File:Crest-moray.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/ea/Crest-moray.png","/wiki/Ecclesiastical_province","/wiki/Scottish_Episcopal_Church","#cite_note-1","/wiki/St._Andrew%27s_Cathedral,_Inverness","/wiki/Bishop_of_Inverness","/wiki/File:Diocese_of_Moray,_Ross_%26_Caithness.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Diocese_of_Moray%2C_Ross_%26_Caithness.png/220px-Diocese_of_Moray%2C_Ross_%26_Caithness.png","http://www.moray.anglican.org/","/wiki/Diocese","/wiki/Scottish_Episcopal_Church","/wiki/Caithness","/wiki/Sutherland","/wiki/Diocese_of_Caithness","/wiki/Ross_and_Cromarty","/wiki/Diocese_of_Ross","/wiki/Inverness-shire","/wiki/Nairnshire","/wiki/Moray_(county)","/wiki/Banffshire","/wiki/Diocese_of_Moray","/wiki/St._Andrew%27s_Cathedral,_Inverness","/wiki/Inverness","/wiki/Mac_Bethad_of_Rosemarkie","/wiki/Aindr%C3%A9as_of_Caithness","/wiki/Scottish_Reformation","/wiki/Bishop","/wiki/Diocese_of_Orkney","/wiki/Bishop_of_Edinburgh","/wiki/Primus_of_the_Scottish_Episcopal_Church","/wiki/Diocese_of_Aberdeen","/wiki/James_Gadderar","/wiki/William_Dunbar_(bishop)","/w/index.php?title=Bishop_of_Moray_and_Ross&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Diocese_of_Aberdeen","#cite_note-2","#cite_note-3","#cite_note-4","/w/index.php?title=Diocese_of_Moray,_Ross_and_Caithness&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","http://www.moray.anglican.org/index.php/churches_directory/","#cite_ref-2","http://www.morayrossandcaithness.co.uk/artman/publish/article_126.shtml","#cite_ref-3","http://www.scotland.anglican.org/index.php/news/entry/new_bishop_elected_for_moray_ross_caithness/","/wiki/Scottish_Episcopal_Church","#cite_ref-4","http://www.moray.anglican.org/artman/publish/article_128.shtml","/w/index.php?title=Diocese_of_Moray,_Ross_and_Caithness&action=edit&section=2","http://www.moray.anglican.org/","/wiki/Template:Scottish_Episcopal_Church","/wiki/Template_talk:Scottish_Episcopal_Church","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Scottish_Episcopal_Church&action=edit","/wiki/Scottish_Episcopal_Church","/wiki/Primus_of_the_Scottish_Episcopal_Church","/wiki/David_Chillingworth","/wiki/Bishop_of_St_Andrews,_Dunkeld_and_Dunblane","/wiki/Bob_Gillies","/wiki/Bishop_of_Aberdeen_and_Orkney","/wiki/Mark_Strange_(bishop)","/wiki/Bishop_of_Moray,_Ross_and_Caithness","/wiki/Gregor_Duncan_(bishop)","/wiki/Bishop_of_Glasgow_and_Galloway","/wiki/Kevin_Pearson_(bishop)","/wiki/Bishop_of_Argyll_and_The_Isles_(Episcopal)","/wiki/Nigel_Peyton","/wiki/Bishop_of_Brechin","/wiki/John_Armes","/wiki/Bishop_of_Edinburgh","/wiki/Diocese_of_Aberdeen_and_Orkney","/wiki/Diocese_of_Argyll_and_The_Isles_(Episcopal)","/wiki/Diocese_of_Brechin_(Episcopal)","/wiki/Diocese_of_Edinburgh","/wiki/Diocese_of_Glasgow_and_Galloway","/wiki/Diocese_of_St_Andrews,_Dunkeld_and_Dunblane","/wiki/File:Mitre_(plain).svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/Mitre_%28plain%29.svg/25px-Mitre_%28plain%29.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Diocese_of_Moray,_Ross_and_Caithness&action=edit","/wiki/Template:Anglican-diocese-stub","/wiki/Template_talk:Anglican-diocese-stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Anglican-diocese-stub&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Diocese_of_Moray,_Ross_and_Caithness&oldid=544437582","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Dioceses_of_the_Scottish_Episcopal_Church","/wiki/Category:Religion_in_Inverness","/wiki/Category:Anglican_diocese_stubs","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Diocese+of+Moray%2C+Ross+and+Caithness&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Diocese+of+Moray%2C+Ross+and+Caithness","/wiki/Diocese_of_Moray,_Ross_a
