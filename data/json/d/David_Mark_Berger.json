{"cursor":"7220","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'David Mark Berger' (June 24, 1944 – September 6, 1972) was an American-\nborn Israeli weightlifter for the Israeli Olympic team in 1972. A lawyer by\neducation, Berger was one of 11 members of Israelâs Olympic team who were\ntaken hostage and subsequently murdered by Arab terrorists at the Munich\nOlympic Games.\n\nBerger was born in Cleveland, Ohio to wealthy parents. A noted student-athlete,\nDavid graduated for Shaker Heights High School in 1962. He attended Tulane\nUniversity from 1962 to 1966 where he was an honor student and a weightlifter.\nWhile a junior at Tulane, he won the NCAA weightlifting title in the 148-pound\nclass. Berger earned a bachelor's degree in psychology from Tulane in 1966. He\nearned a master's degree in business administration and a doctor of laws degree\nfrom Columbia University (both in 1969). In addition to working toward his\ndegrees, Berger was able to devote time to weightlifting, competing as a light-\nheavyweight. His father, Benjamin, was once quoted as saying, âI used to tell\nhim âYou may not be the best weightlifter in the world, but youâre certainly the\nsmartest!ââ\n\nAfter competing in the 1969 Maccabiah Games, where he won a gold medal in the\nmiddleweight weight-lifting contest, Berger emigrated to Israel, intending to\nopen a law office in Tel Aviv after completing his compulsory military service.\nHe met and become engaged to an Israeli student. Continuing his weightlifting\ncompetitions, he won a silver medal at the 1971 Asian Weightlifting\nChampionships, and made the 1972 Israeli Olympic team. In late August of that\nyear, Berger flew to Munich with his teammates. On September 2, 1972, Berger\ncompeted, but was eliminated in an early round.\n","linknr":156,"url":"David_Mark_Berger","recorded":1375074144,"links":["/w/index.php?title=David_Mark_Berger&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=David_Mark_Berger&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/David_Berger_(disambiguation)","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/Israel","/wiki/Olympic_weightlifting","/wiki/Olympic_Games","/wiki/Arab","/wiki/1972_Summer_Olympics","/wiki/Cleveland","/wiki/Ohio","/wiki/Shaker_Heights_High_School","/wiki/Tulane_University","/wiki/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association","/wiki/Bachelor%27s_degree","/wiki/Master%27s_degree","/wiki/Columbia_University","/wiki/1969_Maccabiah_Games","/wiki/Tel_Aviv","/wiki/Silver_medal","/wiki/1971_Asian_Weightlifting_Championships","#Death","#Memorials","#See_also","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=David_Mark_Berger&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Palestinian_terrorist","/wiki/Moshe_Weinberg","/wiki/Gad_Tsobari","/wiki/Yossef_Romano","/wiki/F%C3%BCrstenfeldbruck","/wiki/Munich","/wiki/Hand_grenade","/wiki/Smoke_inhalation","/wiki/Richard_Nixon","/wiki/Munich_Massacre","/w/index.php?title=David_Mark_Berger&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/David_Berger_National_Memorial","/wiki/Beachwood,_Ohio","/wiki/New_Orleans","/wiki/Audubon_Park,_New_Orleans","#cite_note-1","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Shaker_Heights_High_School","/w/index.php?title=David_Mark_Berger&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/List_of_Jews_in_sports#Weightlifting","/w/index.php?title=David_Mark_Berger&action=edit&section=4","#cite_ref-1","http://www2.tulane.edu/article_news_details.cfm?ArticleID=6294","#cite_ref-2","http://www.phillyjewishsports.org/node/311.html","/w/index.php?title=David_Mark_Berger&action=edit&section=5","http://www.davidberger.org/","http://www.starofdavid44.com/","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","/wiki/Munich_Massacre","/wiki/Shaker_Heights,_Ohio","/wiki/Ohio","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/F%C3%BCrstenfeldbruck_Air_Base","/wiki/F%C3%BCrstenfeldbruck","/wiki/Bavaria","/wiki/Germany","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=David_Mark_Berger&oldid=551558969","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1944_births","/wiki/Category:1972_deaths","/wiki/Category:Columbia_Business_School_alumni","/wiki/Category:Columbia_Law_School_alumni","/wiki/Category:Israeli_weightlifters","/wiki/Category:American_weightlifters","/wiki/Category:Maccabiah_Games_weightlifters_of_the_United_States","/wiki/Category:Weightlifters_at_the_1969_Maccabiah_Games","/wiki/Category:Deaths_by_smoke_inhalation","/wiki/Category:Jewish_American_sportspeople","/wiki/Category:Jewish_weightlifters","/wiki/Category:Murdered_sportspeople","/wiki/Category:People_from_Cleveland,_Ohio","/wiki/Category:Tulane_University_alumni","/wiki/Category:Weightlifters_at_the_1972_Summer_Olympics","/wiki/Category:American_emigrants_to_Israel","/wiki/Category:Israeli_terrorism_victims","/wiki/Category:Israeli_people_taken_hostage","/wiki/Category:Terrorism_deaths_in_Germany","/wiki/Category:Israeli_people_murdered_abroad","/wiki/Category:Olympic_weightlifters_of_Israel","/wiki/Category:People_from_Shaker_Heights,_Ohio","/wiki/Category:Munich_massacre","/wiki/Category:Victims_of_Black_September_(group)","/wiki/Category:Maccabiah_Games_gold_medalists","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=David+Mark+Berger&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=David+Mark+Berger","/wiki/David_Mark_Berger","/wiki/Talk:David_Mark_Berger","#","/wiki/David_Mark_Berger","/w/index.php?title=David_Mark_Berger&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=David_Mark_Berger&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/David_Mark_Berger","/
