By successfully distinguishing a case, the holding or legal\nreasoning of the earlier case will either not apply or will be limited. There\nare two formal constraints on the later court: the factors in the ratio of the\nearlier case must be retained in formulating the ratio of the later case, and\nthe ruling in the later case must still support the result reached in the\nprecedent case.<ref name=\"distinguish stanford\">[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/legal-reas-\nprec/index.html#PreLayDowRul \"Precedent and Analogy in Legal Reasoning: 2.1\nPrecedents as laying down rules:] 2.1.2 The practice of distinguishing\".\nStanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. 2006-06-20.</ref>\n\nWhether a case is successfully distinguished often looks to whether the\ndistinguished facts are material to the matter.\n\nThe ruling made by the judge must be based around not only the evidence they are\nfaced with, but the precedents in which they must follow. This means that a\nprecedent will be dealt to a case with similar facts, in which a decision can\nthen be distinguished based upon this.\n","title":"Distinguishing","headings":["Examples","See also","References"]},"micro-relation":["2: Precedent","1: Law","1: Legal_case","1: Facts","1: Court","1: Ratio_decidendi","1: Breach_of_contract","1: Case_law","1: Opinion"]}
