A personal diary may include a person's experiences, and/or\nthoughts or feelings, including comment on current events outside the writer's\ndirect experience. Someone who keeps a diary is known as a diarist. Diaries\nundertaken for institutional purposes play a role in many aspects of human\ncivilization, including government records (e.g., Hansard), business ledgers and\nmilitary records.\n\nGenerally the term is today employed for personal diaries, normally intended\nto remain private or to have a limited circulation amongst friends or\nrelatives. The word \"journal\" may be sometimes used for \"diary,\" but generally\na diary has (or intends to have) daily entries, whereas journal-writing can be\nless frequent.\n\nAlthough a diary may provide information for a memoir, autobiography or\nbiography, it is generally written not with the intention of being published\nas it stands, but for the author's own use. In recent years, however, there\nis internal evidence in some diaries (e.g., those of Ned Rorem, Alan Clark,\nTony Benn or Simon Gray) that they are written with eventual publication in\nmind, with the intention of self-vindication (pre- or posthumous) or simply\nfor profit.\n\nBy extension the term 'diary' is also used to mean a printed publication of a\nwritten diary; and may also refer to other terms of journal including electronic\nformats (e.g., blogs).\n","linknr":329,"url":"Diary","recorded":1362672549,"links":56,"instances":["theatre_director","disambiguation"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Diaries"],"headings":["Etymology","History","Published diaries","Internet diaries","Other forms of diary","Fictional diaries","See also","References","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/The_Diary_of_a_Young_Girl_at_the_Anne_Frank_Zentrum.jpg/220px-The_Diary_of_a_Young_Girl_at_the_Anne_Frank_Zentrum.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/Samuel_Pepys.jpg/155px-Samuel_Pepys.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["li_ao","772-841"],["peter_hall","theatre_director"],["journal","disambiguation"]],"members":["peter_hall","li_ao","journal"],"related":["The_Diary_of_a_Young_Girl","Anne_Frank","Berlin","Calendar_date","List_of_diarists","Hansard","Ledger","Service_record","Memoir","Autobiography","Biography","Ned_Rorem","Alan_Clark","Tony_Benn","Simon_Gray","Blog","Latin","Old_French","French_language","Ben_Jonson","Middle_East","East_Asia","Marcus_Aurelius","Pillowbook","Japan","Asia","Li_Ao_(772-841)","Islamic_Golden_Age","Arabic_literature","Christian_mysticism","Elizabeth_of_Schönau","Agnes_Blannbekin","Beatrice_of_Nazareth","Renaissance","Florence","Buonaccorso_Pitti","Gregorio_Dati","Venice","Marino_Sanuto_the_Younger","Smythson","Autobiography","Samuel_Pepys","Magdalene_College,_Cambridge","John_Evelyn","Primary_source","English_Restoration","Witness","Great_Plague_of_London","Great_Fire_of_London","Dorothy_Wordsworth","Fanny_Burney","Henry_Crabb_Robinson","U.S._Civil_War","George_Templeton_Strong","New_York","Mary_Boykin_Chesnut","Confederate_States_of_America","Jemima_Condict","West_Orange,_New_Jersey","American_Revolutionary_War","Richard_Crossman","Tony_Benn","Alan_Clark","Chips_Channon","James_Lees-Milne","Roy_Strong","Peter_Hall_(theatre_director)","Anne_Frank","Amsterdam","Otto_Frank","Carl_Jung","Aleister_Crowley","Anaïs_Nin","Franz_Kafka","Edmund_Wilson","Friedrich_Kellner","Nazi_Germany","My_Opposition","Victor_Klemperer","German_Democratic_Republic","Internet","Online_diary","MIT_Media_Lab","Justin_Hall","USENET","Open_Diary","LiveJournal","Online_publishing","Blog","Advanced_Encryption_Standard","Calorie","Sleep_diary","Sleep_disorder","Robert_Musil","Paul_Klee","Officer_cadets","Royal_Military_College_of_Canada","India_ink","T-square","War_diary","Dream_journal","Fiction","George_Grossmith","Satire","Private_Eye","Mary_Wilson,_Lady_Wilson_of_Rievaulx","Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom","Harold_Wilson","Adrian_Mole","John_Major","Autobiography","Commentarii","Commonplace_book","Art_diary","Fake_memoirs","Journal_(disambiguation)","List_of_books_on_diaries_and_journals","List_of_diarists","List_of_dream_diaries","List_of_fictional_diaries","Nikki_Bungaku","Online_diary"]}
