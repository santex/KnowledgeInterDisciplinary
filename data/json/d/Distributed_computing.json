{"cursor":"31822","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Distributed computing' is a field of computer science that studies distributed\nsystems. A 'distributed system' consists of multiple computers that communicate\nthrough a computer network. The computers interact with each other in order to\nachieve a common goal. A computer program that runs in a distributed system is\ncalled a 'distributed program', and 'distributed programming' is the process of\nwriting such programs. . . , p. 10.\n\nDistributed computing also refers to the use of distributed systems to solve\ncomputational problems. In distributed computing, a problem is divided into many\ntasks, each of which is solved by one or more computers, . which\ncommunicate with each other by message passing. , p.\n291â292. , p.
