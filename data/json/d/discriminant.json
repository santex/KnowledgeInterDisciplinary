In this case, the discriminant vanishes if\nand only if the polynomial has a multiple root in its splitting field.\n\nAs the discriminant is a polynomial function of the coefficients, it is defined\nas soon as the coefficients belong to an integral domain R and, in this case,\nthe discriminant is in R. In particular, the discriminant of a polynomial with\ninteger coefficients is always an integer. This property is widely used in\nnumber theory.\n\nThe term \"discriminant\" was coined in 1851 by the British mathematician James\nJoseph Sylvester.<ref>J. J.
