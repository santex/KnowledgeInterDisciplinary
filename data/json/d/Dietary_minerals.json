{"cursor":"28498","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Dietary minerals' (also known as 'mineral nutrients') are the chemical elements\nrequired by living organisms, other than the four elements carbon, hydrogen,\nnitrogen, and oxygen present in common organic molecules.\n\nMinerals in order of abundance in the human body include the seven major\nminerals calcium, phosphorus, potassium, sulfur, sodium, chlorine, and\nmagnesium. Important \"trace\" or minor minerals, necessary for mammalian life,\ninclude iron, cobalt, copper, zinc, molybdenum, iodine, and selenium (see below\nfor detailed discussion).\n\nOver twenty dietary minerals are necessary for mammals, and several more for\nvarious other types of life on Earth. The total number of minerals that are\nabsolutely needed is not known for any organism. Ultratrace amounts of some\nminerals (e.g., boron, chromium) are known that clearly have a role but the\nexact biochemical nature is unknown, and others (e.g. arsenic, silicon) are\nsuspected to have a role in health, but without proof.\n\nMost minerals that enter into the dietary physiology of organisms consist of\nsimple compounds of chemical elements. Larger aggregates of minerals need to be\nbroken down for absorption. Plants absorb dissolved minerals in soils, which are\nsubsequently picked up by the herbivores that eat them and so on, the minerals\nmove up the food chain. Larger organisms may also consume soil (geophagia) and\nvisit mineral licks to obtain limiting mineral nutrients they are unable to\nacquire through other components of their diet.\n\nBacteria play an essential role in the weathering of primary minerals that\nresults in the release of nutrients for their own nutrition and for the\nnutrition of others in the ecological food chain. One mineral, cobalt, is\navailable for use by animals only after having been processed into complicated\nmolecules (e.g., vitamin B12), by bacteria. Scientists are only recently\nstarting to appreciate the magnitude and role that microorganisms have in the\nglobal cycling and formation of biological minerals.\n","linknr":677,"url":"Dietary_minerals","recorded":1362673811,"links":64,"instances":["ecological","biochemistry","medicine","food","nutrient","medicine","fruit","ecology","food"],"pdf":["http://www.ajcn.org/content/91/4/1095S.full.pdf","http://www.ajcn.org/content/91/4/1095S.full.pdf","http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/content/47/Special_Issue/1255.full.pdf","http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/content/47/Special_Issue/1255.full.pdf","http://www.butbn.cas.cz/adamec/new_phyt.pdf","http://www.butbn.cas.cz/adamec/new_phyt.pdf","http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/oceanography/courses/OCN621/Spring2011/Azam%20et%20al_loop.pdf","http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/oceanography/courses/OCN621/Spring2011/Azam%20et%20al_loop.pdf","http://mycor.nancy.inra.fr/GIteam/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/Uroz-TiM-2009.pdf","http://mycor.nancy.inra.fr/GIteam/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/Uroz-TiM-2009.pdf","http://www.ajcn.org/content/82/4/721.full.pdf"],"categories":["Dietary minerals|*","Nutrition","Food science"],"headings":["Essential chemical elements for mammals","Blood concentrations of dietary minerals","Dietary nutrition","Other elements","Mineral ecology","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/Blood_values_sorted_by_mass_and_molar_concentration.png/1150px-Blood_values_sorted_by_mass_and_molar_concentration.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6b/Magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c5/Foods.jpg/19px-Foods.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["fish","food"],["nut","fruit"],["nut","fruit"],["magnesium_deficiency","medicine"],["fish","food"],["egg","food"],["cofactor","biochemistry"],["manganese_deficiency","medicine"],["protein","nutrient"],["recycling","ecological"],["particle","ecology"]],"members":["recycling","cofactor","magnesium_deficiency","fish","protein","manganese_deficiency","nut","particle","egg"],"related":["Chemical_element","Organism","Carbon","Hydrogen","Nitrogen","Oxygen","Organic_chemistry","Calcium","Phosphorus","Potassium","Sulfur","Sodium","Chlorine","Magnesium","Iron","Cobalt","Copper","Zinc","Molybdenum","Iodine","Selenium","Boron","Chromium","Arsenic","Silicon","Physiology","Chemical_element","Chemical_compound","Mineral","Geophagia","Salt_lick","Food_chain","Cobalt","Vitamin_B12","Microorganisms","Biomineralization","Electrolyte","Trace_element","Potassium","Electrolyte","Adenosine_triphosphate","Legume","Potato_skin","Tomato","Banana","Hypokalemia","Hyperkalemia","Chlorine","Table_salt","Hypochloremia","Hyperchloremia","Sodium","Adenosine_triphosphate","Sea_vegetable","Milk","Spinach","Hyponatremia","Hypernatremia","Calcium","Dairy_product","Fish_(food)","Green_leafy_vegetable","Nut_(fruit)","Seeds","Hypocalcaemia","Hypercalcaemia","Phosphorus","Apatite","Phosphate","Hypophosphatemia","Hyperphosphatemia","Magnesium","Adenosine_triphosphate","Nut_(fruit)","Soy_bean","Cocoa_mass","Hypomagnesemia","Magnesium_deficiency_(medicine)","Hypermagnesemia","Zinc","Carboxypeptidase","Liver_alcohol_dehydrogenase","Carbonic_anhydrase","Zinc_deficiency","Zinc_toxicity","Iron","Hemoglobin","Anemia","Red_meat","Leafy_green_vegetable","Fish_(food)","Egg_(food)","Dried_fruit","Bean","Whole_grain","Enriched_grain","Anaemia","Iron_overload_disorder","Manganese","Cofactor_(biochemistry)","Enzyme","Manganese_deficiency_(medicine)","Manganism","Copper","Cytochrome_c_oxidase","Copper_deficiency","Copper_toxicity","Iodine","Thyroxine","Triiodothyronine","Goiter","Iodine_in_biology","Iodine_deficiency","Iodism","Selenium","Antioxidant","Glutathione_peroxidase","Selenium_deficiency","Selenosis","Molybdenum","Oxidase","Xanthine_oxidase","Aldehyde_oxidase","Sulfite_oxidase","Molybdenum_deficiency","Dietitian","Food_fortification","Iodised_salt","Iodine","Dietary_supplement","Vitamin","Calcium","Magnesium","Chromium","Chemical_reaction","Metabolism","Sulfur","Amino_acid","Protein_(nutrient)","Cobalt","Vitamin_B12","Bacteria","Vitamin","Vitamin_B12_deficiency","Cobalt_poisoning","Nickel","Chromium","Chromium_picolinate","Chromium_toxicity","Fluorine","Fluoride_poisoning","Boron","Strontium","Arsenic","Silicon","Vanadium","Tungsten","Bromine","Cadmium","Biological_engineering","Minerals","Metabolism","Recycling_(ecological)","Bacteria","Flagellates","Bacterivore","Plankton","Phytoplankton","Particle_(ecology)","Consumer","Top_predator","Food_chain","Essential_nutrient","Food_composition","Health_food","Macronutrient","Micronutrient_deficiency"]}
