National\nWeather Service Observing Handbook No. 8, Aviation Weather Observations for\nSupplementary Aviation Weather Reporting Stations (SAWRS), Manual Observations,\nOctober 1996 Drizzle is normally produced by low stratiform clouds and\nstratocumulus clouds. Precipitation rates from drizzle are on the order of a\nmillimetre per day or less at the ground. Owing to the small size of drizzle\ndrops, under many circumstances drizzle largely evaporates before reaching the\nsurface and so may be undetected by observers on the ground. The METAR code for\ndrizzle is 'DZ'.\n","linknr":193,"url":"Drizzle","recorded":1362372226,"links":44,"instances":["meteorology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Precipitation"],"headings":["Effects","Occurrence","Influence of aerosols","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/94/Cloud.jpg/32px-Cloud.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["precipitation","meteorology"]],"members":["precipitation"],"related":["Precipitation_(meteorology)","Water","Rain","Stratus_cloud","Cloud","Stratocumulus_cloud","METAR","Freezing_Drizzle","Freezing_Drizzle","Subtropical","Stratocumulus_cloud","Cumulus_cloud","Boundary_layer","Radar","Boundary_layer","Large_eddy_simulation","Particulate","Stratocumulus_cloud","Albedo","Climate_models","Greenhouse_effect","Fog","Mist","Rain"]}
