In human cells,\nboth normal metabolic activities and environmental factors such as UV light and\nradiation can cause DNA damage, resulting in as many as 1 million individual\nmolecular lesions per cell per day. Lodish H, Berk A,\nMatsudaira P, Kaiser CA, Krieger M, Scott MP, Zipursky SL, Darnell J. (2004).\nMolecular Biology of the Cell, p963. WH Freeman: New York, NY. 5th ed.\nMany of these lesions cause structural damage to the DNA molecule and can alter\nor eliminate the cell's ability to transcribe the gene that the affected DNA\nencodes. Other lesions induce potentially harmful mutations in the cell's\ngenome, which affect the survival of its daughter cells after it undergoes\nmitosis. As a consequence, the DNA repair process is constantly active as it\nresponds to damage in the DNA structure. When normal repair processes fail, and\nwhen cellular apoptosis does not occur, irreparable DNA damage may occur,\nincluding double-strand breaks and DNA crosslinkages (interstrand crosslinks or\nICLs).\n\nThe rate of DNA repair is dependent on many factors, including the cell type,\nthe age of the cell, and the extracellular environment. A cell that has\naccumulated a large amount of DNA damage, or one that no longer effectively\nrepairs damage incurred to its DNA, can enter one of three possible states:\n# an irreversible state of dormancy, known as senescence cell suicide, also\n# known as apoptosis or programmed cell death unregulated cell division, which\n# can lead to the formation of a tumor that is cancerous\n\nThe DNA repair ability of a cell is vital to the integrity of its genome and\nthus to its normal functioning and that of the organism. Many genes that were\ninitially shown to influence life span have turned out to be involved in DNA\ndamage repair and protection. Failure to correct\nmolecular lesions in cells that form gametes can introduce mutations into the\ngenomes of the offspring and thus influence the rate of evolution.\n","linknr":888,"url":"DNA_repair","recorded":1362481165,"links":57,"instances":["naturally_occurring","journal","chemistry","genetics","biology","genetics","biology","biology","chemistry"],"pdf":["http://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jemsge/28/2/56/_pdf","http://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jemsge/28/2/56/_pdf","http://www.benbest.com/lifeext/Nuclear_DNA_in_Aging.pdf","http://www.benbest.com/lifeext/Nuclear_DNA_in_Aging.pdf"],"categories":["Aging","Cellular
