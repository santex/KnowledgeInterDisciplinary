If the system is not functioning correctly,\nthe algorithm should be able to determine, as accurately as possible, which part\nof the system is failing, and which kind of fault it is facing. The computation\nis based on observations, which provide information on the current behaviour.\n\nThe expression diagnosis also refers to the answer of the question of whether\nthe system is malfunctioning or not, and to the process of computing the answer.\nThis word comes from the medical context where a diagnosis is the process of\nidentifying a disease by its symptoms.\n","linknr":129,"url":"Diagnosis_(artificial_intelligence)","recorded":1362570787,"links":12,"instances":["sampath","abstract"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Artificial intelligence"],"headings":["Example","Expert diagnosis","Model-based diagnosis","Diagnosability","Bibliography","See also","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/da/Principle-diagnosis.png/600px-Principle-diagnosis.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/2/e/2/2e220003cb9b15bb63fd7e8ff254bac8.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/d/1/8d1d7a1d099f0db029dc222e9479ff23.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/0/d/50d112953683a15ad0a0d7e4104779cc.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/2/3/e/23e0d1abd0f4c120a04dd9fbec8c343d.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/6/7/f/67fdd6651261a0b920e76776f8352d6d.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/2/7/82789e896ea830a3468ce5876d0a981a.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/1/6/1/161b99f8bca9d2ce86ff0034499bd7b2.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/b/0/0b0f8b3863d5d24a9a310a1bac13aa94.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/2/7/f2726e087c6b46fe519cd87f0de06c57.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/9/1/e9129cab390692d27b3dc3e640ae82a1.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["diagnoser","sampath"],["model","abstract"]],"members":["diagnoser","model"],"related":["Artificial_intelligence","Diagnosis","Expert_system","Machine_learning","Complexity","Diagnoser_(Sampath)","Discrete_event_systems","Abductive_reasoning","Model_(abstract)","Abductive_reasoning","AI_effect","Applications_of_artificial_intelligence","List_of_emerging_technologies","Outline_of_artificial_intelligence"]}
