{"cursor":"4750","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'double bond' in chemistry is a chemical bond between two chemical elements\ninvolving four bonding electrons instead of the usual two. The most common\ndouble bond, that between two carbon atoms, can be found in alkenes. Many types\nof double bonds between two different elements exist, for example in a carbonyl\ngroup with a carbon atom and an oxygen atom. Other common double bonds are found\nin azo compounds (N=N), imines (C=N) and sulfoxides (S=O). In skeletal formula\nthe double bond is drawn as two parallel lines (=) between the two connected\natoms; typographically, the equals sign is used for\nthis. .Organic Chemistry 2nd Ed. John McMurry.\n\nDouble bonds are stronger than single bonds and double bonds are also\nshorter. The bond order is two. Double bonds are also electron-rich, which\nmakes them reactive.\n\n{|align=\"center\" class=\"wikitable\"\n||  \n|-\n|| ethylene acetone dimethyl sulfoxide\n|-\n|Colspan=100%|'Common chemical compounds with double bonds'\n|}\n","linknr":219,"url":"Double-bond","recorded":1362371325,"links":32,"instances":["unit"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Chemical bonding"],"headings":["Bonding","Types of double bonds between atoms","Variations","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3b/Ethylene-CRC-MW-dimensions-2D.png/150px-Ethylene-CRC-MW-dimensions-2D.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4b/Acetone-CRC-MW-ED-dimensions-2D.png/180px-Acetone-CRC-MW-ED-dimensions-2D.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bb/DMSO-2D-dimensions.png/150px-DMSO-2D-dimensions.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/95/Doppelbindung1.png/400px-Doppelbindung1.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b1/Doppelbindung2.png/400px-Doppelbindung2.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["mole","unit"]],"members":["mole"],"related":["Chemistry","Chemical_bond","Chemical_elements","Bonding_electron","Alkenes","Carbonyl","Azo_compound","Imines","Sulfoxides","Skeletal_formula","Equals_sign","Covalent_bond","Bond_order","Ethylene","Acetone","Dimethyl_sulfoxide","Orbital_hybridization","Ethylene","Atomic_orbital","Sigma_bond","Pi-bond","Cis-trans_isomerism","Carbon&ndash;carbon_bond","Bond_length","Ethane","Joule","Mole_(unit)","Bent_bond","Alkene","Carbonyl","Imine","Thioketone","Thial","Oxygen","Nitroso","Sulfoxide","Sulfone","Sulfinic_acid","Sulfonic_acid","Azo_compound","Conjugated_system","Diene","Enone","Cyclic_compound","Aromaticity","Cumulene","Period_2_element","Carbon","Nitrogen","Oxygen","Double_bond_rule","Metal_ligand_multiple_bond"]}
