It is commonly associated\nwith transferring title to property. The deed has a greater presumption of\nvalidity and is less rebuttable than an instrument signed by the party to the\ndeed. A deed can be unilateral or bilateral. Deeds include conveyances,\ncommissions, licenses, patents, diplomas, and conditionally powers of attorney\nif executed as deeds. The deed is the modern descendant of the medieval charter,\nand delivery is thought to symbolically replace the ancient ceremony of livery\nof seisin.<ref>E. Rory O'Connor, The Irish Notary (Dublin: Professional Books,\n1987), 83:12n.</ref>\n\nThe traditional phrase signed, sealed and delivered refers to the practice of\nseals; however, attesting witnesses have replaced seals to some extent.\nAgreements under seal are also called contracts by deed or specialty; in the\nUnited States, a specialty is enforceable without consideration.<ref>[http://definitions.uslegal.com/c/contract-under-\nseal/ Contract under Seal Law & Legal Definition]. USLegal.com.</ref> In some\njurisdictions, specialties have a liability limitation period of double that of\na simple contract and allow for a third party beneficiary to enforce an\nundertaking in the deed, thereby overcoming the doctrine of privity.<ref>Andrew\nGriffiths, Contracting With Companies, (London: Hart Publishing, 2005), 7.</ref>\nSpecialties, as a form of contract, are and can therefore be distinguished from\ncovenants, which, being also under seal, are unilateral promises.\n",
