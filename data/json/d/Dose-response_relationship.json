{"cursor":"6632","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nThe 'doseâresponse relationship', or 'exposureâresponse relationship', describes\nthe change in effect on an organism caused by differing levels of exposure (or\ndoses) to a stressor (usually a chemical) after a certain exposure\ntime. This may apply to individuals (e.g.: a small amount has no\nsignificant effect, a large amount is fatal), or to populations (e.g.: how many\npeople or organisms are affected at different levels of exposure).\n\nStudying dose response, and developing dose response models, is central to\ndetermining \"safe\" and \"hazardous\" levels and dosages for drugs, potential\npollutants, and other substances to which humans or other organisms are exposed.\nThese conclusions are often the basis for public policy. The U.S. Environmental\nProtection Agency has developed extensive guidance and reports on dose-response\nmodeling and assessment, as well as software.\n\nDoseâresponse relationships generally depend on the exposure time and exposure\nroute (e.g., inhalation, dietary intake); quantifying the response after a\ndifferent exposure time or for a different route leads to a different\nrelationship and possibly different conclusions on the effects of the stressor\nunder consideration. This limitation is caused by the complexity of biological\nsystems and the often unknown biological processes operating between the\nexternal exposure and the adverse cellular or tissue response.\n","linknr":196,"url":"Dose-response_relationship","recorded":1362504910,"links":19,"instances":["medicine","biochemistry","biochemistry","biochemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Pharmacology","Toxicology"],"headings":["Dose–response curve","Problems with linear model","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/9b/DoseResponse000.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["dose","biochemistry"],["receptor","biochemistry"],["adverse_effect","medicine"],["hill_equation","biochemistry"]],"members":["adverse_effect","receptor","hill_equation","dose"],"related":["Organism","Dose_(biochemistry)","Stressor","Chemical","Organism","Cartesian_coordinate_system","Receptor_(biochemistry)","End_point_of_clinical_trials","Microgramme","Logarithm","Sigmoid_function","Threshold-dose","Adverse_effect_(medicine)","EC50","Probit_model","Logit_model","Hill_equation_(biochemistry)","Threshold_model","Linear_no-threshold_model","Pharmacodynamics","Spatial_epidemiology","EC50","IC50","Certain_safety_factor","Schild_regression","Hormesis","Arndt-Schulz_rule"]}
