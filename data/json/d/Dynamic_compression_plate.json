{"cursor":"2299","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nA 'dynamic compression plate (DCP)' is a metallic plate used in orthopedics for\ninternal fixation of bone, typically after fractures. As the name implies, it is\ndesigned to exert dynamic pressure between the bone fragments to be transfixed.\nDynamic compression is achieved either by attaching a tension device to a plate\nor by using a special dynamic compression plate. However, compression plating\nrequires a longer surgical incision to allow insertion of the tension device and\nthe possibility of refracture after the plate is removed. A neutralization plate\nis used to bridge a comminuted fracture; it also transmits bending or torsional\nforces from the proximal to the distal fragment. Plates used for buttressing\nprevent collapse by supporting an area of thin cortex or cancellous bone graft.\n\nWhen plates are used, atrophy of the bone beneath the plate may predispose the\nbone to fracture. After removal of plates, fractures may occur through the\nscrew holes.\n","linknr":96,"url":"Dynamic_compression_plate","recorded":1362484295,"links":15,"instances":["bone"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Implants","Orthopedic surgery"],"headings":["Sliding screw plate","Limited contact dynamic compression plate"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/AdhesiveBandage.png/40px-AdhesiveBandage.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["fracture","bone"]],"members":["fracture"],"related":["Orthopedic_surgery","Internal_fixation","Bone","Fracture_(bone)","Atrophy","Dynamic_hip_screw","Intertrochanteric","Lag_screw","Weight_bearing"]}
