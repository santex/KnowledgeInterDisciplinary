{"cursor":"4123","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nDosage forms are a mixture of active drug components and nondrug components\n(excipients). Depending on the method of administration they come in several\ntypes. These are liquid dosage form, solid dosage form and semisolid dosage\nforms. A 'Liquid dosage form' is the liquid form of a dose of a chemical\ncompound used as a drug or medication intended for administration or\nconsumption. Common dosage forms include pill, tablet, or capsule, drink or\nsyrup, and natural or herbal form such as plant or food of sorts, among many\nothers. Notably, the route of administration (ROA) for drug delivery is\ndependent on the dosage form of the substance in question.\n\nVarious dosage forms may exist for a single particular drug, since different\nmedical conditions can warrant different routes of administration. For example,\npersistent nausea and emesis or vomiting may make it difficult to use an oral\ndosage form, and in such a case, it may be necessary to utilize an alternate\nroute such as inhalational, buccal, sublingual, nasal, suppository or\nparenteral instead.\n\nAdditionally, a specific dosage form may be a requirement for certain kinds of\ndrugs, as there may be issues with various factors like chemical stability or\npharmacokinetics. As an example, insulin cannot be given orally because upon\nbeing administered in this manner, it is extensively metabolized in the\ngastrointestinal tract (GIT) before reaching the blood stream, and is thereby\nincapable of sufficiently reaching its therapeutic target destinations. The oral\nand intravenous doses of a drug such as paracetamol will differ for the same reason. http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-\n12366870\n","linknr":381,"url":"Dosage_form","recorded":1362676196,"links":35,"instances":["substance","pharmacy","pharmaceutical","chemistry","biochemistry","pharmacy","chemistry","pharmacy"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Pharmacology","Dosage forms"],"headings":["Types","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/FlattenedRoundPills.jpg/58px-FlattenedRoundPills.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/Hexaaquatitanium%28III%29-solution.jpg/58px-Hexaaquatitanium%28III%29-solution.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/Inhaler.jpg/58px-Inhaler.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/Glycerin_suppositories.jpg/58px-Glycerin_suppositories.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/SPF15SunBlock.JPG/58px-SPF15SunBlock.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/Injection_Syringe_01.jpg/58px-Injection_Syringe_01.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/84/Nuvola_apps_filetypes_red.svg/52px-Nuvola_apps_filetypes_red.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["dose","biochemistry"],["pill","pharmacy"],["tablet","pharmacy"],["capsule","pharmacy"],["pill","pharmacy"],["tablet","pharmacy"],["capsule","pharmacy"],["suspension","chemistry"],["powder","substance"],["freebase","chemistry"],["powder","substance"],["cream","pharmaceutical"]],"members":["powder","capsule","cream","freebase","dose","pill","suspension","tablet"],"related":["Dose_(biochemistry)","Chemical_compound","Drug","Medication","Ingestion","Pill_(pharmacy)","Tablet_(pharmacy)","Capsule_(pharmacy)","Drink","Syrup","Natural_resource","Herbal","Plant","Food","Route_of_administration","Drug_delivery","Chemical_substance","Medical_condition","Nausea","Emesis","Vomiting","Oral_administration","Inhalational","Cheek","Sublingual","Human_nose","Suppository","Parenteral","Chemical_stability","Pharmacokinetic","Insulin","Metabolized","Gastrointestinal_tract","Blood_stream","Paracetamol","Pill_(pharmacy)","Tablet_(pharmacy)","Capsule_(pharmacy)","Cheek","Sub-lingual","Orally_disintegrating_tablet","Thin_film_drug_delivery","Listerine_Pocketpak","Liquid","Solution","Suspension_(chemistry)","Drink","Syrup","Powder_(substance)","Liquid_crystal","Solid","Crystal","Natural_resource","Herbal","Plant","Seed","Food","Marijuana","Cannabis_foods","Aerosol_spray","Inhaler","Nebulizer","Smoking","Natural","Herb","Tobacco","Marijuana","Freebase_(chemistry)","Powder_(substance)","Cocaine","Methamphetamine","Vaporizer","Vaporize","Natural","Herb","Marijuana","Intradermal","Intramuscular","Intraosseous","Intraperitoneal","Intravenous","Subcutaneous","Intrathecal","Cream_(pharmaceutical)","Gel","Liniment","Balm","Lotion","Ointment","Ear_drop","Otic","Eye_drop","Ophthalmology","Transdermal_patch","Transdermal","Vaginal_ring","Vaginal","Douche","Pessary","Classification_of_Pharmaco-Therapeutic_Referrals","Drug_delivery","Route_of_administration"]}
