It later moved into televisions and\nultimately video recorders. In 1965 it merged with RentaSet, Joseph Robinson's\nsimilarly formed company. Then in 1968 it was acquired by Thorn Electrical\nIndustries and joined with Thorn's DER chain (founded 1938) as part of Thorn\nTelevision Rentals (TTR) though the two companies were run completely separately\nwith different staff and vehicles etc. In 1980 TTR and thus Radio Rentals became\npart of the merged Thorn-EMI, and in 2000 it merged with Granada Limited to form\nboxclever. The company still trades as Radio Rentals in Australia.\n","linknr":129,"url":"DER_rental","recorded":1362665824,"links":15,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Companies established in 1932","Companies of Australia","Defunct companies of the United Kingdom"],"headings":["United Kingdom","Oceania","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/12/Radio_Rentals_UK_1990s_logo.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/1d/Logo_radio_rentals.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c3/Radio_rentals_logo.png/250px-Radio_rentals_logo.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Thorn_Electrical_Industries","Thorn-EMI","Granada_plc","Boxclever","UK","Brighton","Sussex","England","BBC_Two","BBC","ITV","JVC","Sky_Television_plc","British_Satellite_Broadcasting","British_Sky_Broadcasting","High_Street","Integrated_circuit","Business_model","Granada_plc","Boxclever","Australia","New_Zealand","South_Australia","Big_Brown_Box","Appliances_Online"]}
