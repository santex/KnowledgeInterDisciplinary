{"cursor":"5089","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'David Monrad Johansen' (November 8, 1888 – February 20, 1974) was a\nNorwegian composer.\n\nHe was born in Vefsn and grew up near MosjÃ¸en, where he received his first piano\nlessons. He came to Christiania (Oslo) in 1904 to study at the conservatory\nthere, and he continued taking lessons with Catharinus Elling, Iver Holter and\nothers until he went to Berlin in 1915 for further studies. In 1920, he went for\na study trip to Paris, and here Stravinskyâs music came to make a huge\nimpression on him. In addition he met Fartein Valen, which inspired him to start\nstudying dissonant counterpoint. Later, in 1933 and 1935, he spent short periods\nabroad for further studies. Monrad Johansenâs study time was extraordinary\ndiverse, and his development was affected by this.\n\nIt is difficult to categorise his style, with all the different influences that\nhe went through. Before Berlin, he was within the conservative late romanticism,\nclearly influenced by Edvard Grieg. After Berlin, under the influence of Alf\nHurum, he started studying the French Impressionist music, and around 1920 this\nstyle is apparent in his music. This was also a very productive period. At the\nsame time, he was influenced by the nationalistic style. He several times used\nlyrics from Norse literature or Norwegian folk stories/songs, but seldom\nmelodies. He did, however, arrange some folk tunes for piano (opus 9 and 10).\n\nMonrad Johansenâs most famous piece is [[Voluspaa]] op. 15 (1926). It was\ncomposed for soloists/vocals, choir and orchestra, and itâs based on the poem\nVoluspaa, from the Edda. This piece and the [[Nordlands Trompet]] op. 13, are\nthe most pure nationalistic of Monrad Johansenâs works, and often called a\nNorwegian impressionism. Regarding sound, they are related to impressionism, but\nhave structures with more polyphonic features than what was common in f. ex.\nDebussyâs impressionistic pieces. The basis for the music, which is clearly\ntonal, has modal features. Dorian, Phrygian and Lydian scales are often\napparent. Even though Monrad Johansen had achieved significant recognition with\nthese pieces, it was clear to him that the style was a dead-end, and the\nfollowing pieces show a composer on a stylistic search. Then, during the studies\nin 1933 and 1935, he turned more into a neo-classical direction, more\npolyphonic, more clear tonality, classical forms â also more clear sound and\ncolours, and fewer dissonances than in the 1930s.\n\nMonrad Johansen had a very central position in Norwegian music life in the 1920s\nand 1930s. He was the leading person within the musical nationalism around 1925,\nafter having achieved great recognition with the 7 songs to old Norwegian folk\nstories (opus 6) and the piece for male choir, [[Draumkvedet]], opus 7. This\nposition was strengthened when he got the artist's grant (from 1925).\n\nDuring the German occupation of Norway in the course of World War II, Johansen\nsupported the collaborationist government of Vidkun Quisling, Jim Samson.\n[http://books.google.com/books?id=oxueiVlm97EC&pg=PA61&dq=%22David+Monrad+Johan-\nsen%22&lr=&as_brr=3&ei=N32GSPmbFoa4jgHquPiMBg&sig=ACfU3U0hK_QpRuok9AFQnF4paB_ug-\nLZd5A#PPA63,M1 Music and Nationalism: Five Historical Moments.] In: Nationalism\nand Ethnosymbolism: History, Culture and Ethnicity in the Formation of Nations.\nAthena S.
