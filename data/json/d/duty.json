      "text" : "\n]] 'Duty' (from \"due\" meaning \"that which is owing\"; , past participle of\ndevoir; , whence \"debt\") is a term that conveys a sense of moral commitment or\nobligation to someone or something. The moral commitment should result in\naction; it is not a matter of passive feeling or mere recognition. When someone\nrecognizes a duty, that person theoretically commits themself to its fulfillment\nwithout considering their own self-interest. This is not to suggest that living\na life of duty entirely precludes a life of leisure; however, its fulfillment\ngenerally involves some sacrifice of immediate self-interest. Typically, \"the\ndemands of justice, honor, and reputation are deeply bound up\" with\nduty.<ref>http://www.pvv.ntnu.no/~leirbakk/rpg/mythus/mythus_samurai.html</ref>\n\nCicero, an early philosopher who discusses duty in his work “On Duty\", suggests\nthat duties can come from four different sources:<ref>Cicero, Marcus T. De\nOfficiis. Cambridge: Harvard UP, 1913. Print.</ref>\n# as result of being human as a result of one's particular place in life (one's\n# family, one's country, one's job) as a result of one's character as a result\n# of one's own moral expectations for oneself\n\nVarious derivative uses of the word have sprung from the root idea of\nobligation, a concept involved in the notion of duty; thus it is used in the\nservices performed by a minister of a church, by a soldier, or by any employee\nor servant.\n\nMany schools of thought have debated the idea of duty. While many assert\nmankind's duty on their own terms, some philosophers have absolutely rejected a\nsense of duty.\n\nDuty has to be accepted and understood on the basis of one's foundation of sense\nand knowledge. Therefore, duty and its manifestations vary with values from\nculture to culture.\n",
