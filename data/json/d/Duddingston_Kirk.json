{"cursor":"2929","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Duddingston Kirk' is a Parish Church in the Church of Scotland, located\nadjacent to Holyrood Park in Duddingston Village, on the east side of the City\nof Edinburgh. Regular services are held at the kirk, conducted by the minister,\nRev Dr James A. P. Jack (from 2001).\n\nThe church was built in or around 1124 by Dodin, a Norman knight, on land\ngranted to Kelso Abbey by King David I of Scotland. As originally built, the\nkirk consisted of the chancel, nave and square tower. The traditional pattern of\nan east-west axis was adopted. The original entrance on the south wall includes\na particularly fine example of Scoto-Norman stone carving, with a round-topped\ndoorway. Following the enlargement of the parish boundaries, the Prestonfield\nAisle was added in 1631. This consists of a gallery, downstairs area and burial\nvaults were on the north side. In 1968 the kirkâs interior was reconditioned,\nwith the former pipe organ removed.\n\nThe entrance to the kirkyard from Duddingston village is notable for its\ngatehouse, built as a lookout point to deter âbodysnatchersâ in the early 19th\ncentury. The Edinburgh bodysnatchers, known as \"resurrectionists,\" stole\nrecently buried corpses to sell to anatomists, and, as in the notorious case of\nBurke and Hare, sometimes also resorted to murder.\n\nGiven its proximity to central Edinburgh, Duddingston has long been a favourite\nlocation for many of the cityâs artists and professionals. The novelist Walter\nScott was ordained an elder at Duddingston in 1806. A famous former minister in\nthe mid-19th century was the Reverend John Thomson, a notable painter and friend\nof Raeburn and Turner, and who was widely admired locally. His pastoral ministry\ngave rise to the popular Scottish expression \"Weâre a' Jock Tamsonâs bairnsâ.\n\nAnother minister of this parish, James Macfarlane, was Moderator of the General\nAssembly in 1865.\n","linknr":105,"url":"Duddingston_Kirk","recorded":1375066455,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Duddingston_Kirk&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Duddingston_Kirk&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Duddingston_Kirk_-_geograph.org.uk_-_1507676.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d7/Duddingston_Kirk_-_geograph.org.uk_-_1507676.jpg/220px-Duddingston_Kirk_-_geograph.org.uk_-_1507676.jpg","/wiki/File:Duddingston_Kirk_-_geograph.org.uk_-_1507676.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Church_of_Scotland","/wiki/Duddingston","/wiki/Edinburgh","/wiki/Normans","/wiki/Kelso_Abbey","/wiki/David_I_of_Scotland","/wiki/Apse","/wiki/Nave","/wiki/Tower","/wiki/Scoto-Norman","/wiki/Burke_and_Hare","/wiki/Sir_Walter_Scott","/wiki/Reverend_John_Thomson","/wiki/Henry_Raeburn","/wiki/J._M._W._Turner","/wiki/Jock_Tamson%27s_Bairns","/wiki/Moderator_of_the_General_Assembly_of_the_Church_of_Scotland","/w/index.php?title=Duddingston_Kirk&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Duddingston","/wiki/Edinburgh","/wiki/Church_of_Scotland","/wiki/List_of_Church_of_Scotland_parishes","/w/index.php?title=Duddingston_Kirk&action=edit&section=2","http://duddingstonkirk.co.uk/","http://www.edinburghpresbytery.org.uk/","http://photosynth.net/view.aspx?cid=af18bb15-04af-4375-bae0-9951148befbe","/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system","//tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Duddingston_Kirk&params=55_56_28.22_N_3_8_56.82_W_type:landmark","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Duddingston_Kirk&oldid=550009627","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Category_A_listed_buildings_in_Scotland","/wiki/Category:Church_of_Scotland_churches_in_Scotland","/wiki/Category:Churches_in_Edinburgh","/wiki/Category:Listed_buildings_in_Edinburgh","/wiki/Category:Listed_churches_in_Scotland","/wiki/Category:Buildings_and_structures_completed_in_the_12th_century","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Duddingston+Kirk&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Duddingston+Kirk","/wiki/Duddingston_Kirk","/wiki/Talk:Duddingston_Kirk","#","/wiki/Duddingston_Kirk","/w/index.php?title=Duddingston_Kirk&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Duddingston_Kirk&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Duddingston_Kirk","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Duddingston_Kirk","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Duddingston_Kirk&oldid=550009627","/w/index.php?title=Duddingston_Kirk&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5311666","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Duddingston_Kirk&id=550009627","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Duddingston+Kirk","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Duddingston+Kirk&oldid=550009627&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Duddingston_Kirk&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5311666#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duddingston_Kirk","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_
