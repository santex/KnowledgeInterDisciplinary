{"cursor":"16922","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In computer networking, a 'packet' is a formatted unit of data carried by a\npacket mode computer network. Computer communications links that do not support\npackets, such as traditional point-to-point telecommunications links, simply\ntransmit data as a series of bytes, characters, or bits alone. When data is\nformatted into packets, the bitrate of the communication medium can be better\nshared among users than if the network were circuit switched.\n","linknr":257,"url":"Data_packets","recorded":1362676821,"links":45,"instances":["computing","computing","computing","telecommunications","computing"],"pdf":["http://www.dvb.org/technology/standards/a001r7.tm1214r30.dTS101154.v1.8.1.pdf"],"categories":["Units of information","Packets (information technology)|"],"headings":["Packet framing","Terminology","Example: IP packets","Example: the NASA Deep Space Network","Example: Radio and TV Broadcasting","See also","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["character","computing"],["payload","computing"],["header","computing"],["trailer","computing"],["frame","networking"],["frame","telecommunications"]],"members":["trailer","character","payload","frame","header"],"related":["Computer_networking","Data","Packet_mode","Computer_network","Point-to-point_link","Bytes","Character_(computing)","Bit","Bitrate","Circuit_switching","Payload_(computing)","Header_(computing)","Trailer_(computing)","Communications_protocol","Binary_Synchronous_Transmission","Ethernet","Checksum","Cyclic_redundancy_check","Parity_bit","ARPANET","Internet","Packet_switching","OSI_model","Computer_networking","Protocol_data_unit","Network_Layer","Data_Link_Layer","OSI_model","Frame_(networking)","Transport_Layer","TCP_segment","Datagram","TCP/IP","Internet_Protocol","Ethernet","Internet_Protocol","Transmission_Control_Protocol","Internet_Protocol","User_Datagram_Protocol","Internet_Protocol","User_Datagram_Protocol","ARPANET","BBN_Report_1822","Interface_Message_Processor","CYCLADES","ALOHAnet","Ethernet","End-to-end_principle","Internet","IPsec","Internet_Protocol","IPv4_packet","IPv4","IPv6","Quality_of_Service","IP_fragmentation","User_Datagram_Protocol","Internet_protocol_suite","Transport_protocol","Transmission_Control_Protocol","User_Datagram_Protocol","OSI_model","IP_address","Frame_(telecommunications)","CCSDS","Reedâ€“Solomon_error_correction","Cyclic_redundancy_check","Specification","MPEG","Communication_protocol","MPEG-2","Elementary_stream","MPEG_transport_stream","MPEG_program_stream","Multiplexed","ATSC_tuner","Digital_Video_Broadcasting","Start_code","MPEG_transport_stream","Elementary_stream","Binary_numeral_system","Hexadecimal","Syncword","Monaural","Subcarrier","Frequency_modulation","Amplitude_modulation","In-flight_movie","White_noise","Anti-replay","DHCP_server","Fast_packet_switching","Gigapackets","Louis_Pouzin","Mangled_packet","Packet_analyzer","Packet_generation_model","Protocol_data_unit","Statistical_multiplexing","Tail_drop","TCP_segment","TCP/IP"]}
