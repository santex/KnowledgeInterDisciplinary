{"cursor":"1103","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'DNA synthesis' is the natural or artificial creation of deoxyribonucleic acid\n(DNA) molecules. In nature, such molecules are created by all living cells\nthrough the process of DNA replication, with replication initiator proteins\nsplitting the existing DNA of the cell and making a copy of each split segment,\nwith the copied segments then being joined together into a new DNA molecule.\nVarious means also exist to artificially stimulate the replication of naturally\noccurring DNA, or to create artificial gene sequences. A polymerase chain\nreaction is a form of enzymatic DNA synthesis, using cycles of repeated heating\nand cooling of the reaction for DNA melting and enzymatic replication of the\nDNA. Artificial gene synthesis is the process of synthesizing a gene [[in\nvitro]] without the need for initial template DNA samples. The main method is\ncurrently by oligonucleotide synthesis (also used for other applications) from\ndigital genetic sequences and subsequent annealing of the resultant fragments.\n","linknr":75,"url":"DNA_synthesis","recorded":1362371732,"links":10,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["DNA replication"],"headings":[],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Deoxyribonucleic_acid","DNA_replication","Polymerase_chain_reaction","Artificial_gene_synthesis","Gene","DNA","Oligonucleotide_synthesis","Digital_genetic_sequence"]}
