Inertia comes from the Latin word, iners, meaning idle, or\nlazy. Isaac Newton defined inertia as his first law in his [[PhilosophiÃ¦\nNaturalis Principia Mathematica]], which states: Andrew Motte's English\ntranslation:{{Citation\n  | last = Newton first = Isaac title = Newton's Principia : the mathematical\n  | principles of natural philosophy publisher = Daniel Adee year = 1846\n  | location = New York url =\n  | http://www.archive.org/details/newtonspmathema00newtrich pages= 72\n}}\n\n\n\nIn common usage the term \"inertia\" may refer to an object's \"amount of\nresistance to change in velocity\" (which is quantified by its mass), or\nsometimes to its momentum, depending on the context. The term \"inertia\" is more\nproperly understood as shorthand for \"the principle of inertia\" as described by\nNewton in his First Law of Motion; that an object not subject to any net\nexternal force moves at a constant velocity. Thus an object will continue\nmoving at its current velocity until some force causes its speed or direction\nto change.\n\nOn the surface of the Earth inertia is often masked by the effects of friction\nand air resistance, both of which tend to decrease the speed of moving objects\n(commonly to the point of rest), and gravity. This misled classical theorists\nsuch as Aristotle, who believed that objects would move only as long as force\nwas applied to them.
