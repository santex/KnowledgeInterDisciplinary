The Hadza are one of the few contemporary African\n societies that live primarily by foraging.]] A 'hunter-gatherer' or\n 'forager' society is one in which most or all food is obtained from\n wild plants and animals, in contrast to agricultural societies which rely\n mainly on domesticated species.\n\nHunting and gathering was the ancestral subsistence mode of [[Homo]], and all\nmodern humans were hunter-gatherers until around 10,000 years ago. Following the\ninvention of agriculture hunter-gatherers have been displaced by farming or\npastoralist groups in most parts of the world. Only a few contemporary societies\nare classified as hunter-gatherers, and many supplement, sometimes extensively,\ntheir foraging activity with farming and/or keeping
