In the international community, however, terrorism has no legally\nbinding, criminal law definition. Angus Martyn, [http://www.aph.gov.au/library/Pubs/CIB/2001-\n02/02cib08.htm The Right of Self-Defence under International Law-the Response to\nthe Terrorist Attacks of 11 September], Australian Law and Bills Digest Group,\nParliament of Australia Web Site, 12 February 2002. Thalif Deen.\n[http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=29633 \"POLITICS: U.N. Member States Struggle\nto Define Terrorism\"], Inter Press Service, 25 July 2005. Common\ndefinitions of terrorism refer only to those violent acts which are intended to\ncreate fear (terror); are perpetrated for a religious, political or, ideological\ngoal; and deliberately target or disregard the safety of non-combatants\n(civilians). Some definitions now include acts of unlawful violence and war. The\nuse of similar tactics by criminal organizations for protection rackets or to\nenforce a code of silence is usually not labeled terrorism, though these same\nactions may be labeled terrorism when done by a politically motivated group. The\nwriter Heinrich BÃ¶ll and scholars Raj Desai and Harry Eckstein have suggested\nthat attempts to protect against terrorism may lead to a kind of social\noppression. Heinrich BÃ¶ll, FÃ¼rsorgliche Belagerung (Cologne: Kiepenhauer &\nWitsch, 1979). Raj Desai and Harry Eckstein (1990). Insurgency: The\nTransformation of Peasant Rebellion, World Politics, 42 , pp 441-465\ndoi:10.2307/2010510\n\nThe word \"terrorism\" is politically and emotionally charged, Hoffman, Bruce. Inside Terrorism, Columbia University Press, 1998 ISBN 0-231-11468-\n0. P. 32. See review in the [[New York Times]] [http://www.nytimes.com/books/first/h/hoffman-\nterrorism.html \"'Inside Terrorism'\"]. and this greatly compounds the\ndifficulty of providing a precise definition. Studies have found over 100\ndefinitions of âterrorismâ. Schmid, Alex, and Jongman, Albert.\nPolitical Terrorism: A New Guide to Actors, Authors, Concepts, Data bases,\nTheories and Literature, Amsterdam ; New York : North-Holland ; New Brunswick:\nTransaction Books, 1988. The concept of terrorism may be controversial as\nit is often used by state authorities (and individuals with access to state\nsupport) to delegitimize political or other opponents,\nand potentially legitimize the state's own use of armed force against opponents\n(such use of force may be described as \"terror\" by opponents of the state). {{cite news |author= Elysa Gardner\n|title= Harold Pinter: Theater's singular voice falls silent |quote= In 2004, he\nearned the prestigious Wilfred Owen prize for a series of poems opposing the war\nin Iraq. In his acceptance speech, Pinter described the war as \"a bandit act, an\nact of blatant state terrorism, demonstrating absolute contempt for the concept\nof international law.\" |publisher= USA Today |date= 2008-12-25 |url= http://www.usatoday.com/life/theater/news/2008-12-25-\npinter_N.htm |accessdate= 2010-01-11 }}\n\nTerrorism has been practiced by a broad array of political organizations to\nfurther their objectives. It has been practiced by both right-wing and left-wing\npolitical parties, nationalistic groups, religious groups, revolutionaries, and\nruling governments. An abiding characteristic is\nthe indiscriminate use of violence against noncombatants for the purpose of\ngaining publicity for a group, cause, or individual. The symbolism of terrorism\ncan leverage human fear to help achieve these goals.\n","linknr":1367,"url":"Terrorism","recorded":1362501408,"links":167,"instances":["professor"],"pdf":["http://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pdffiles/pub207.pdf","http://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pdffiles/pub207.pdf","http://www.asap-spssi.org/pdf/asap019.pdf","http://www.asap-spssi.org/pdf/asap019.pdf","http://www.marshallcenter.org/mcpublicweb/MCDocs/files/College/F_Publications/occPapers/occ-paper_20-en.pdf","http://www.marshallcenter.org/mcpublicweb/MCDocs/files/College/F_Publications/occPapers/occ-paper_20-en.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20080709091840/http://www.fbi.gov/publications/terror/terror99.pdf","http://www.fbi.gov/publications/terror/terror99.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20080709091840/http://www.fbi.gov/publications/terror/terror99.pdf","http://llr.lls.edu/volumes/v35-issue4/seto.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20071201063344/http://www.law.du.edu/ilj/online_issues_folder/mccabe.final.4.26.03.pdf","http://www.law.du.edu/ilj/online_issues_folder/mccabe.final.4.26.03.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20071201063344/http://www.law.du.edu/ilj/online_issues_folder/mccabe.final.4.26.03.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.law.du.edu/ilj/online_issues_folder/mccabe.final.4.26.03.pdf","https://www.europol.europa.eu/sites/default/files/publications/te-sat2011.pdf","https://www.europol.europa.eu/sites/default/files/publications/te-sat2011.pdf","https://www.europol.europa.eu/sites/default/files/publications/tesat2010_0.pdf","https://www.europol.europa.eu/sites/default/files/publications/tesat2010_0.pdf","https://www.europol.europa.eu/sites/default/files/publications/tesat2009_0.pdf","https://www.europol.europa.eu/sites/default/files/publications/tesat2009_0.pdf","http://maxabrahms.com/pdfs/DC_250-1846.pdf","http://maxabrahms.com/pdfs/DC_250-1846.pdf","http://ksghome.harvard.edu/~.aabadie.academic.ksg/povterr.pdf","http://ksghome.harvard.edu/~.aabadie.academic.ksg/povterr.pdf","http://ksghome.harvard.edu/~.aabadie.academic.ksg/povterr.pdf","http://ksghome.harvard.edu/~.aabadie.academic.ksg/povterr.pdf","http://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/pdf-files/Soc_Psych_of_Terrorism.pdf","http://eprints.unimelb.edu.au/archive/00000137/01/Primorat.pdf","http://eprints.unimelb.edu.au/archive/00000137/01/Primorat.pdf","http://www.informaworld.com/index/781318312.pdf","http://www.informaworld.com/index/781318312.pdf","http://www.ncua.gov/letters/2002/02-CU-14.pdf","http://www.danieldrezner.com/research/guest/Pape1.pdf","http://www.danieldrezner.com/research/guest/Pape1.pdf"],"categories":["Terrorism|","Fear","Abuse","Dispositional
