Trotula of Salerno was a female physician who worked in Salerno, Italy.\nSeveral writings about womenâs health have been attributed to her, including\nDiseases of Women, Treatments for Women, and Womenâs Cosmetics. In medieval\nEurope, these texts were a major source for information on womenâs\nhealth. Green, Monica: The Trotula, page xi. U. of PA, 2001.\n\nDiseases of Women, Treatments for Women, and Womenâs Cosmetics are usually\nreferred to collectively as The Trotula. This is misleading because there is\nno evidence that Diseases of Women and Womenâs Cosmetics were actually written\nby Trotula; these two texts circulated anonymously until they were combined\nwith Treatments for Women sometime in the thirteenth century. Treatments for\nWomen bears Trotulaâs name. By the end of the thirteenth century, the\ncollection of the three texts was known as The Trotula. For the next several\nhundred years, The Trotula circulated throughout Europe, reaching its greatest\npopularity in the fourteenth century. Twenty-nine copies exist\ntoday. Green, pages 49-59.\n\nOnly two other texts by Trotula survive. She was one of seven Salerno physicians\nwho contributed to an encyclopedia of medical knowledge, On the Treatment of\nIllnesses. Her excerpt was later published separately as Practical Medicine\nAccording to Trota. These two texts and Treatments for Women are the only three\ntexts bearing Trotulaâs name. Green, page 49.\n\nLittle is known of Trotula's life. She is believed to have been a physician at\nthe so-called School of Salerno. The medieval scholar Caspar Wolff asserted that\nthe Trotula texts were actually written by a man, a freed Roman\nslave. Rowland, Beryl: Medieval Womanâs Guide to Health, page 3-4. Kent\nState, 1981. Two feminist historians, Elizabeth Mason-Hohl and Kate\nCampbell Hurd-Mead, wrote about Trotula in the 1930s/40s. Both women made false\nand unsupported elaborations about Trotulaâs life, leading to misconceptions\nthat last to this day. It is not known exactly when Trotula lived, if she was\nmarried, or if she was an early feminist. {{cite journal |last=Stuard\n|first=Susan Mosher |title=Dame Trot |pages=537â42| publisher=University of\nChicago Press |date=Winter 1975 |journal=Signs: ''Journal of Women in Culture\nand Society'' |volume=1 |issue=2 |jstor=3173063}}\n","recorded":1362124390,"portal":[],"list":[],"links":"78","instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["11th-century births","12th-century deaths","Medieval Italian physicians","Italian women writers","Women of medieval Italy","Medieval writers","Medieval women physicians","12th-century women writers","People from Salerno","12th-century Italian people"],"headings":["Francesca of Salerno","''The Trotula''","References","Further reading"],"tags":[],"image":["http://en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Trotula_of_Salerno.jpg","http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/Trotula_of_Salerno.jpg/200px-Trotula_of_Salerno.jpg","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Trotula_of_Salerno.jpg","http://bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Trotula_De_Ornatu_Mulierum_15th_century.jpg","http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/82/Trotula_De_Ornatu_Mulierum_15th_century.jpg/220px-Trotula_De_Ornatu_Mulierum_15th_century.jpg","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Trotula_De_Ornatu_Mulierum_15th_century.jpg","http://bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","http://bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","http://bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"related":["Salerno","School_of_Salerno","Elizabeth_Mason-Hohl","Kate_Campbell_Hurd-Mead","School_of_Salerno","Physicians","Surgeons","Galen","Obstetric_fistula","Ibn_al-Jazzar","De_Ornatu_mulierum"],"members":[],"book":[]}
