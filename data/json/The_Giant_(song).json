The Giant\nreferred to is Fingal, an Irish-Scottish mythical giant. The song is set in Nova\nScotia's rugged Cape Breton Island, and the lyrics contain enchanting imagery\ndescribing the island's landscape. The song also contains quasi-pagan imagery,\nincluding the suggestion of worshipping the new moon by dancing around a\nbonfire, although it may be that characters in the song are using the full moon\nto have a party. In the album [[Home in Halifax]], Stan Rogers claimed that the\nsong was about Guinness.\n","linknr":92,"url":"The_Giant_(song)","recorded":1362677054,"links":15,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Stan Rogers songs"],"headings":[],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/Musical_notes.svg/30px-Musical_notes.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Canadian","Stan_Rogers","Fionn_mac_Cumhaill","Ireland","Scotland","Nova_Scotia","Cape_Breton_Island"]}
