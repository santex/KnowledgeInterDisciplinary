This can\noften happen in microsatellite regions due to the DNA polymerase slipping.\nInsertions can be anywhere in size from one base pair incorrectly inserted into\na DNA sequence to a section of one chromosome inserted into another.\n\nOn a chromosome level, an insertion refers to the insertion of a larger sequence\ninto a chromosome. This can happen due to unequal crossover during meiosis.\n\n'N region addition' is the addition of non-coded nucleotides during\nrecombination by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase.\n\n'P nucleotide insertion' is the insertion of palindromic sequences encoded by\nthe ends of the recombining gene segments.\n\nTrinucleotide repeats are classified as insertion\nmutations [http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evosite/evo101/IIIC3aTypes.shtml\nTypes of Mutations] Understanding Evolution For Teachers Home.
