{"cursor":"83704","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Herbal medicine' (or '\"herbalism\"') is the study and use of medicinal\nproperties of plants. The scope of herbal medicine is sometimes extended to\ninclude fungal and bee products, as well as minerals, shells and certain animal\nparts. Pharmacognosy is the study of all medicines that are derived from\nnatural sources.\n\n trees contains large amounts of salicylic acid, which is the active metabolite\n of aspirin. Willow bark has been used for millennia as an effective pain\n reliever and fever reducer. ]] Plants have the ability to synthesize\n a wide variety of chemical compounds that are used to perform important\n biological functions, and to defend against attack from predators such as\n insects, fungi and herbivorous mammals. Many of these phytochemicals have\n beneficial effects on long-term health when consumed by humans, and can be used\n to effectively treat human diseases. At least 12,000 such compounds have been\n isolated so far; a number estimated to be less than 10% of the total. Chemical compounds in plants mediate their\n effects on the human body through processes identical to those already well\n understood for the chemical compounds in conventional drugs; thus herbal\n medicines do not differ greatly from conventional drugs in terms of how they\n work. This enables herbal medicines to be as effective as conventional\n medicines, but also gives them the same potential to cause harmful side\n effects.\n\nThe use of plants as medicines predates written human history. Ethnobotany (the\nstudy of traditional human uses of plants) is recognized as an effective way to\ndiscover future medicines. In 2001, researchers identified 122 compounds used in\nmodern medicine which were derived from \"ethnomedical\" plant sources; 80% of\nthese have had an ethnomedical use identical or related to the current use of\nthe active elements of the plant. Many of the\npharmaceuticals currently available to physicians have a long history of use as\nherbal remedies, including aspirin, digitalis, quinine, and opium.\n\nThe use of herbs to treat disease is almost universal among non-industrialized\nsocieties, and is often more affordable than purchasing expensive modern\npharmaceuticals. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 80 percent\nof the population of some Asian and African countries presently use herbal\nmedicine for some aspect of primary health care. Studies in the United States\nand Europe have shown that their use is less common in clinical settings, but\nhas become increasingly more in recent years as scientific evidence about the\neffectiveness of herbal medicine has become more widely available.\n","linknr":1454,"url":"Herbalism","recorded":1362373131,"links":64,"instances":["element","dosha","united_states","wine","herbalism","plant","plant"],"pdf":["http://medind.nic.in/iae/t07/i4/iaet07i4p243.pdf","http://medind.nic.in/iae/t07/i4/iaet07i4p243.pdf","http://www.bxscience.edu/ourpages/auto/2007/11/9/1194631995278/Arab%20Roots%20of%20European%20Medicine.pdf","http://www.bxscience.edu/ourpages/auto/2007/11/9/1194631995278/Arab%20Roots%20of%20European%20Medicine.pdf","http://nccam.nih.gov/news/report.pdf","http://nccam.nih.gov/news/report.pdf","http://toxicology.usu.edu/endnote/Harmless-Herbs.pdf","http://toxicology.usu.edu/endnote/Harmless-Herbs.pdf","http://annals.highwire.org/cgi/reprint/135/8_Part_1/594.pdf","http://annals.highwire.org/cgi/reprint/135/8_Part_1/594.pdf"],"categories":["Herbalism|","Biologically
