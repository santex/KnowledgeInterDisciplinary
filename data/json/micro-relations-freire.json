{"cursor":"7736","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Freire' is a word used in the Portuguese and Galician languages to define the\noccupational name for a friar, or a nickname for a pious person or someone\nemployed at a monastery. The word is derived from Latin frater, which means brother.[http://genealogy.familyeducation.com/surname-\norigin/freire ]\n\nIn the eleventh century religious associations of horsemen were founded, called\nthe Military Orders, whose members, in the language of the Church, were called\nfratres, and each frater (m). This word entered the everyday language which\nmeant fraternized Knight by the Military Orders, and, as circumstances of time\nand place, the Portuguese territory had evolved phonetically similar forms of\nthe form \"Frei\" hence the name Freire of these knights, and how \"Brother\" was\nused as a prepositional name to qualify the proper name of the Knights. Among\nthe French knights who came from France, accompanied D. Raymond and D. Henry,\nwho were the soldiers' \"Freire, the family of former Galicia, which joined the\nAndrade, almost at the beginning, joining later for new wedlock so many times\nthat is difficult to distinguish one from the another. These unions created one\nfamily, that of Freire de Andrade, who came to Portugal in the Middle Ages. Some\nuse both names together, others only to Andrade or just Freire, and this, as it\nwere the weapons were a (Coat of nobility) with the band, open mouthed serpent\nheads (Encyclopedia Portuguese and Brazilian). The kingdom of Leon, a region\nthat today corresponds to the extreme northern Spain, was divided into duchies,\nwhere he was part of that kingdom the Duchy of Portu-Callis and the duchy of\nGalicia. \"Two French noblemen, D. Raymond, son of Count Henry of Burgundy and\nhis cousin, offered to Alfonso VI, King of Leon to fight in the war against the\nMoors, perhaps in return for services rendered by war Afonso VI married his\nlegitimate daughter, Urraca with Raymond and his illegitimate daughter, Dona\nTeresa to Henry. Raymond received the government of Galicia and Henry Duchy of\nPortu-Callis \"( A. Souto Maior, History of Brazil, page 17). Portu-Callis was to\nbecome in 1143 the Kingdom of Portugal ruled by Henry (The conqueror)recognised\nby the kingdom of Castile and the Kingdom of LeÃ³n through the teaty of Zamora in\n1143. In 1179 Pope Alexander III r recognized Portugal as an independent nation\nand vassal of the church through the bull Manifestis Probatum.\n\nOrder of Avis - the creation date of this Order is unknown, but, like their\ncounterparts, will have started by an association of riders in order to fight\nthe Muslims, by mid-twelfth century. During the reign of Afonso Henriques\n(Henry) there was a military order with the name Freire of Ãvora, integrated\ninto the Order of Calatrava of Castile, the king donated of several castles\nexposed to the attacks of the Moors. In 1211, D. Afonso II donated to these\nFreires the place of Avis which later came to be established as the order of\nAvis. In the initiation ritual they professed the following oath: \"I come before\nGod and before the Freires\" ... Implying that this magic initiation ritual,\noccurred in the Castillo de Los Templar (this castle that belonged to the Order\nof Freires) in the town of Ponferrada in Galicia (photo).\n\nThe Andrades took advantage of this familyÂ´s prestige and titles using the\nFreire coat of arms since the Andrades did not belong to any order of chivalry.\nIn turn the Freires tapped into a new source of wealth, it was a mutually\nbeneficial alliance Members of the Freire family gave rise powerful noblemen in\nPortugal during the time of the reconquista. King Pedro I entrusted his son John\nwho later became D. JoÃ£o I( John I) King of Portugal, to Don Nuno Freire de\nAndrade the master of the Order of Christ which was the converted Order of the\nTemple by King PedroÂ´s farther King Dinis I of Portugal since the Templars had\nbeen extinct by Papal bull in 1318. Although an exception was made of the\nTemplarÂ´s holdings in the Kingdoms of Aragon, Castile, Portugal and Mallorca in\nother kingdoms throughout Europe such as France and England the TemplarÂ´s\nproperty was transferred to the Hospitallers. In the event, the three kings\nprincipally concerned âEdward II of England, James II of Aragon and above all\nPhilip IV of France-though they publicly agreed to the PopeÂ´s plans for the\nTempleÂ´s riches, all ensured that a portion remained in their hands and or the\nhands of their vassals. In the case of Portugal with King Dinis I this was no\ndifferent although in this case the Templars were merely converted to the Order\nof Christ in 1318, some of the vassals to gain recognition with this were\nprecisely the Freires. Again in this case there was an exception regarding the\nother kingdoms since they were already part of the Templars and the\nHospitallers.\n\nThe Freire family continued to have an important part in the Order of Christ all\nthe way to the beginning of the 20th century in Portugal until this country\nbecame a Republic. The Freires endured for 700 years in close ties to the\nPortuguese and European nobility such as the Austrians, French and Germans. The\nFreire Coat of arms is recognised to be one of the oldest unchanged European\nCoat of Arms it is also used under the name Freire de Andrade although the arms\nbelong to the Freire.\n\nSome of the known descendants of this aristocratic family are Count Luis Filipe\nde Almeida Augusto Hamelberg Freire currently living in the central highlands of\nPortugal in a town founded by the Hospitallers called Oliveira do Hospital most\nof their ancestors are from this region, but he has also lived in Angola-Luanda,\nUK-London, South Africa-Johannesburg and France-Tours. The tiny city of Oliveira\ndo Hospital was founded by the Hospitallers, had previously been occupied by the\nRomans and before them by Neolithic men. All family members have chosen not to\nuse their titles of nobility since living under a Republican political system in\nPortugal. The family now live anonymously as common people with without the\ninfluence wealth or power of their ancestors much of their wealth was usurped or\nspread out through ex colonies which were also lost along with the independence\nof those colonies such as Brazil and Angola.\n\nFreire is also a surname, and may refer to:\n\n'People'\n* Count/Baron Luis Filipe De Almeida Augusto Freire (
