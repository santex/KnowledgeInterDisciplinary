{"cursor":"9303","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nIn mathematics, a 'binary operation' on a set is a calculation involving two\nelements of the set (called operands) and producing another element of the set\n(more formally, an operation whose arity is two). Examples include the familiar\nelementary arithmetic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and\ndivision. Other examples are readily found in different areas of mathematics,\nfor example, vector addition, matrix multiplication and conjugation in groups.\n","linknr":228,"url":"Binary_operation","recorded":1362374533,"links":61,"instances":["mathematics","mathematics","algebra","mathematics","mathematics","mathematics","programming","mathematics","mathematics","mathematics","group_theory","mathematics","mathematics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Binary operations|"],"headings":["Terminology","Properties and examples","Notation","Pair and tuple","Binary operations as ternary relations","External binary operations","See also","Notes","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/c/6/fc639f09e8ad657a4894c20f0b905a79.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["operation","mathematics"],["division","mathematics"],["conjugation","group_theory"],["set","mathematics"],["map","mathematics"],["closure","mathematics"],["function","mathematics"],["group","mathematics"],["ring","algebra"],["matrix","mathematics"],["division","mathematics"],["set","mathematics"],["external","mathematics"],["field","mathematics"],["external","mathematics"],["operator","programming"]],"members":["function","division","ring","external","closure","matrix","operator","map","group","operation","conjugation","field","set"],"related":["Mathematics","Operands","Operation_(mathematics)","Arity","Elementary_arithmetic","Addition","Subtraction","Multiplication","Division_(mathematics)","Vector_addition","Matrix_multiplication","Conjugation_(group_theory)","Set_(mathematics)","Map_(mathematics)","Cartesian_product","Closure_(mathematics)","Function_(mathematics)","Partial_function","Real_numbers","Division_by_zero","Algebra","Model_theory","Computer_science","Binary_function","Abstract_algebra","Group_(mathematics)","Monoid","Semigroup","Ring_(algebra)","Addition","Multiplication","Number","Matrix_(mathematics)","Composition_of_functions","Commutative","Associative","Identity_element","Inverse_element","Example_of_a_commutative_non-associative_magma","Subtraction","Exponentiation","Division_(mathematics)","Tetration","Infix_notation","Superscript","Polish_notation","Reverse_Polish_notation","Ordered_pair","Binary_tree","Tuple","Multiset","Idempotent","Set_(mathematics)","Finitary_relation","External_(mathematics)","Scalar_multiplication","Linear_algebra","Field_(mathematics)","Vector_space","External_(mathematics)","Group_action","Dot_product","Iterated_binary_operation","Operator_(programming)","Ternary_operation","Unary_operation"]}
