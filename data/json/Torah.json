It has a range of meanings: it can most specifically mean the first\nfive books of the Tanakh, it can mean this, plus the rabbinic commentaries on\nit, it can mean the continued narrative from Genesis to the end of the Tanakh,\nit can even mean the totality of Jewish teaching and practice. Common to all\nthese meanings, Torah consists of the foundational narrative of the Jewish\npeople: their call into being by their God, their trials and tribulations, and\ntheir covenant with their God, which involves following a way of life (halakha)\nembodied in a set of religious obligations and civil laws.\n\nIn its most specific meaning, it consists of the first five books of the Tanakh\nwritten in Biblical Hebrew. The names of each of these books in Hebrew are taken\nfrom the first phrase in each book: Bereshit (\"In [the] beginning\", Genesis),\nShemot (\"Names\", Exodus), Vayikra (\"He called\", Leviticus Chaim Miller The\nGutnick Edition Chumashâthe Book of Leviticus p. 1. 2005 \"... Vayikra means \"He\ncalled\", as in the opening verse of our Parsha, \"He called to Moshe\". \" ),\nBamidbar (\"In the desert\", Numbers) and Devarim (\"Words\", Deuteronomy).\n\nIn rabbinic literature the word Torah denotes both these five books, Torah\nShebichtav (×ª××¨× ×©×××ª×, \"Torah that is written\"), and an Oral Torah, Torah\nShebe'al Peh (×ª××¨× ×©××¢× ×¤×, \"Torah that is spoken\"). The Oral Torah consists\nof the traditional interpretations and amplifications handed down by word of\nmouth from generation to generation and now embodied in the Talmud (×ªÖ·Ö¼×Ö°××Ö¼×)\nand Midrash (×××¨×©). Birnbaum (1979),\np. 630\n\nTraditionally, the words of the Torah are written on a scroll by a [[sofer]] on\nparchment in Hebrew. A Torah portion is read publicly at least once every three\ndays, in the halachically prescribed tune, in the presence of a\ncongregation. Babylonian Talmud Bava Kama 82a Reading the Torah\npublicly is one of the bases for Jewish communal life.\n\nAccording to religious tradition, all of the teachings found in the Torah, both\nwritten and oral, were given by God to Moses, some of them at Mount Sinai and\nothers at the Tabernacle, and all the teachings were written down by Moses,\nwhich resulted in the Torah we have today. According to a Midrash, the Torah was\ncreated prior to the creation of the world, and was used as the blueprint for\nCreation. Vol. 11 Trumah Section 61\n\nSome modern Biblical scholars believe that the written books were a product of\nthe Babylonian exilic period (c. 600 BCE) and that it was completed by the\nPersian period (c. 400 BCE). page 1,
