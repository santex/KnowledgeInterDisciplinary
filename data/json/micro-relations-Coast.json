{"cursor":"23363","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n of New Zealand]] A 'coastline' or 'seashore' is the area where land meets the\n sea or ocean. A precise line that can be called a coastline cannot\n be determined due to the dynamic nature of tides. The term \"'coastal zone'\" can\n be used instead, which is a spatial zone where interaction of the sea and land\n processes occurs. Both the terms coast and coastal are often used to\n describe a geographic location or region; for example, New Zealand's West\n Coast, or the East and West Coasts of the United States.\n\nA pelagic coast refers to a coast which fronts the open ocean, as opposed to a\nmore sheltered coast in a gulf or bay. A shore, on the other hand, can refer to\nparts of the land which adjoin any large body of water, including oceans (sea\nshore) and lakes (lake shore). Similarly, the somewhat related term \"bank\"\nrefers to the land alongside or sloping down to a river (riverbank) or to a body\nof water smaller than a lake. \"Bank\" is also used in some parts of the world to\nrefer to an artificial ridge of earth intended to retain the water of a river or\npond. In other places this may be called a levee.\n\nWhile many scientific experts might agree on a common definition of the term\n\"coast\", the delineation of the extents of a coast differ according to\njurisdiction, with many scientific and government authorities in various\ncountries differing for economic and social policy reasons.\n","linknr":617,"url":"Coast","recorded":1362688854,"links":83,"instances":["geology","weathering","geology","geology","spatial","chemistry","landform","geology"],"pdf":["http://pdf.wri.org/Page_coastal.pdf","http://pdf.wri.org/Page_coastal.pdf"],"categories":["Coasts|","Coastal
