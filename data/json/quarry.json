Quarries are generally used for extracting building materials,\n such as dimension stone, construction aggregate, riprap, sand, and gravel. They\n are often collocated with concrete and asphalt plants due to the requirement\n for large amounts of aggregate in those materials. Open mines that produce\n minerals are typically referred to as 'open pit mines'.\n\nThe word quarry can include underground quarrying for stone, such as Bath stone.\n",
