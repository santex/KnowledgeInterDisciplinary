Pericyclic\n reactions are usually rearrangement reactions. The major classes of pericyclic\n reactions are:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=2 |Name colspan=2 |Bond changes\n|-\n! Sigma !! Pi\n|- Electrocyclic reaction || + 1 || -1 - Cycloaddition || +2 || -2 - Sigmatropic\n|reaction || 0 || 0 - Group transfer reaction || + 1 || -1 - Cheletropic\n|reaction || + 2 || - 2 - Dyotropic reaction || 0 || 0 }\n\nIn general, these are considered to be equilibrium processes, although it is\npossible to push the reaction in one direction by designing a reaction by which\nthe product is at a significantly lower energy level; this is due to a\nunimolecular interpretation of Le Chatelier's principle. Pericyclic reactions\noften have related stepwise radical processes associated with them. Some\npericyclic reactions, such as the [2+2] cycloaddition, are 'controversial'\nbecause their mechanism is not definitively known to be concerted (or may depend\non the reactive system). Pericyclic reactions also often have metal-catalyzed\nanalogs, although usually these are also not technically pericyclic, since they\nproceed via metal-stabilized intermediates, and therefore are not concerted.\n\nA large photoinduced hydrogen sigmatropic shift was utilized in a corrin\nsynthesis performed by Albert Eschenmoser containing a 16Ï system.
