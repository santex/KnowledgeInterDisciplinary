The sport\nof gliding had been developed in Germany in the 1920s but had spread widely by\n1936, allowing an international demonstration to the International Olympic\nCommittee (IOC).\n\nNo contest took place and no prizes were allowed by the IOC. ISTUS\n(Internationale Studienkommission fÃ¼r motorlosen Flug) which later became part\nof the FAI Gliding Commission had wanted to present prizes but this did not\nhappen. However, a Swiss, Hermann Schreiber, was awarded a gold medal for his\nflight across the Alps in 1935.\n\nThe demonstration at the 1936 Berlin Olympics was at Berlin-Staaken airfield\non 4 August. 14 pilots from seven countries (Bulgaria, Italy, Hungary,\nYugoslavia, Switzerland, Germany and Austria) took part. On the previous day,\na wing of a glider broke during an aerobatic flight by an Austrian, Ignaz\nStiefsohn. He was killed.\n\nThe Hungarian pilot, Lajos Rotter, declared on the evening of 10 August at\nRangsdorf that the next day he would fly to Kiel, where Olympic sailing events\nwere held. He then flew his Nemere glider to Kiel in poor weather. On arrival\nover Kiel at an altitude of 650 m he saluted the Olympic site with two loops and\nlanded at Holtenau 4hr 31min after launch. The distance flown was 336.5 km.\nThis was then the longest pre-declared goal flight by a glider. [http://gliders-\nfega.freeweb.hu/Rotter.htm Biography of Lajos Rotter - Accessed 26 August\n2009]\n\nGliding was officially accepted by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) at\ntheir 1938 Cairo Conference as part of the \"facultative\" (optional) group of\nsports, and was to be staged for the first time in the 1940 Summer Olympics. An\nOlympic glider, the DFS Olympia Meise, was chosen in 1939 but the Games were\ncancelled due to the outbreak of the Finnish/Russian winter war\n{{cite web\n| url = http://www.deutsches-\n|
