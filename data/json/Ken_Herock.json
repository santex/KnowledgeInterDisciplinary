He\nplayed collegiately at West Virginia and professionally in the American Football\nLeague, where he played for the AFL Champion Oakland Raiders in the second AFL-\nNFL World Championship Game, held after the 1967 season. He attended Munhall\nHigh School in Pittsburgh. His six-year pro career was spent with the Oakland\nRaiders, who he helped win the AFL title, the Cincinnati Bengals, and the Boston\nPatriots. After his playing career ended, Herock was a player personnel\nexecutive in the NFL with the Raiders, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and the Atlanta\nFalcons. He is known for trading Brett Favre from the Falcons to the Green Bay\nPackers at the urging of head coach Jerry Glanville. [http://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/2008-03-04-favre-\nretires_N.htm And now Favre's gone; what's next for Packers?]\n\nHerock spent seven seasons as the Raiders' personnel director, and was credited\nwith helping build their Super Bowl XI championship team. He followed Ron Wolf\nto the expansion Buccaneers, where he held the title of Director of Player\nPersonnel for the team's first eight years. During his tenure, the Buccaneers\nreached the playoffs in only four years, at that time the fastest of any NFL\nteam. At the expiration of his contract in 1984, Herock found that he could make\nmore money than he was being offered by Buccaneers owner Hugh Culverhouse, but\nthe frugal Culverhouse refused to increase his offer. Zier, Patrick. \"Bucs\ncome up with dumbest move yet\". The Lakeland Ledger. 12 Jun 1984 Coach\nHoward Schnellenberger then made Herock his first hire, offering him the same\nposition with the USFL Washington Federals. This failed to pan out, as the\nteam's planned move to Miami coincided with the USFL's planned move to a fall\nschedule, and their prospective owner canceled his purchase of the team rather\nthan try to compete head-to-head with the Miami Dolphins and\nHurricanes. Associated Press. \"Schnellenberger Is Left Without Coaching\nJob\". The Toledo Blade. 25 Aug 1984\n\nHe has 2 sons, one being the assistant director of scouting for the Green Bay\nPackers. Ken also has 5 grandchildren.\n\nIn High School, Ken played volleyball, baseball, basketball, and football. Ken\nNow lives in Gainsville Georgia and is in the West Virginia Hall of Fame.\n","linknr":129,"url":"Ken_Herock","recorded":1375056772,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Ken_Herock&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Ken_Herock&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ken_Herock&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Template:Citation_needed","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/File:Ken_Herock.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b3/Ken_Herock.jpg/220px-Ken_Herock.jpg","/wiki/Munhall,_PA","/wiki/American_football_positions","/wiki/Tight_End","/wiki/College_football","/wiki/West_Virginia_University","/wiki/American_Football_League_Draft","/wiki/1963_American_Football_League_Draft#Round","http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/HeroKe00.htm","http://www.databasefootball.com/players/playerpage.htm?ilkid=HEROCKEN01","/wiki/American_Football_League","/wiki/Oakland_Raiders","/wiki/American_Football_League","/wiki/Cincinnati_Bengals","/wiki/American_Football_League","/wiki/Boston_Patriots","/wiki/Pittsburgh,_Pennsylvania","/wiki/American_football","/wiki/Tight_end","/wiki/West_Virginia_University","/wiki/American_Football_League","/wiki/Oakland_Raiders","/wiki/Professional_American_football_championship_games","/wiki/Pittsburgh,_Pennsylvania","/wiki/Oakland_Raiders","/wiki/Cincinnati_Bengals","/wiki/Boston_Patriots","/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Buccaneers","/wiki/Atlanta_Falcons","/wiki/Brett_Favre","/wiki/Green_Bay_Packers","/wiki/Jerry_Glanville","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Super_Bowl_XI","/wiki/Ron_Wolf","/wiki/1984_Tampa_Bay_Buccaneers_season","/wiki/Hugh_Culverhouse","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Howard_Schnellenberger","/wiki/USFL","/wiki/Washington_Federals","/wiki/Miami_Dolphins","/wiki/Miami_Hurricanes_football","#cite_note-3","/w/index.php?title=Ken_Herock&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","http://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/2008-03-04-favre-retires_N.htm","#cite_ref-2","#cite_ref-3","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","/wiki/Munhall,_PA","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ken_Herock&oldid=551131385","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:West_Virginia_Mountaineers_football_players","/wiki/Category:Living_people","/wiki/Category:1941_births","/wiki/Category:Articles_needing_additional_references_from_October_2009","/wiki/Category:All_articles_needing_additional_references","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Ken+Herock&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Ken+Herock","/wiki/Ken_Herock","/wiki/Talk:Ken_Herock","#","/wiki/Ken_Herock","/w/index.php?title=Ken_Herock&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Ken_Herock&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Ken_Herock","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Ken_Herock","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Ken_Herock&oldid=551131385","/w/index.php?title=Ken_Herock&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6387782","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Ken_Herock&id=551131385","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Ken+Herock","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Ken+Herock&oldid=551131385&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Ken_Herock&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6387782#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_polic
