While pontoon bridges are usually temporary\nstructures, some are used for long periods of time. Permanent floating bridges\nare useful for sheltered water-crossings where it is not considered economically\nfeasible to suspend a bridge from anchored piers. Such bridges can require a\nsection that is elevated, or can be raised or removed, to allow ships to pass.\n\nPontoon bridges are especially useful in wartime as river crossings. Such\nbridges are usually temporary, and are sometimes destroyed after crossing (to\nkeep the enemy from using them), or collapsed and carried (if on a long march).\nThey were used to great advantage in many battles throughout time, including the\nBattle of Garigliano, the Battle of Oudenarde, and many others.\n\nPontoon bridges have been in use since ancient times.\n",
