For other uses, see [[food energy]] and\n[[calorie (disambiguation)]]\n\nThe name 'calorie' is used for two units of energy:\n* the 'small calorie' or 'gram calorie' (symbol: cal) which is the approximate\n  amount of energy needed to raise the temperature of one gram of water by one\n  degree Celsius;\n* 'large calorie', 'kilocalorie', 'kilogram calorie', 'dietary calorie',\n  'nutritionist's calorie' or 'food calorie' (symbol: kcal or Cal), equal to\n  1000 small calories.\n\nThese units were at one time part of the metric system, but now they have been\nsuperseded in the International System of Units by the joule. One small calorie\nis about 4.2 joules, and one large calorie is therefore 4.2 kilojoules. The\nfactors used to convert calories to joules are numerically equivalent to\nexpressions of the specific heat capacity of water in joules per gram or per\nkilogram. The conversion factor depends on the definition adopted.\n\nIn spite of its non-official status, the (large) calorie is still widely used as\na unit of food energy in the US, UK and some other Western countries. The small\ncalorie is also often used in chemistry.\n\nThe calorie was first defined by Nicolas ClÃ©ment in 1824 as a unit of heat, and entered French and English dictionaries between 1841 and 1867.\nThe word comes from Latin calor meaning \"heat\".\n","linknr":212,"url":"Calorie","recorded":1362480448,"links":66,"instances":["unit"],"pdf":["http://www.biozentrum.unibas.ch/personal/schirmer/teaching/blockkurs/2008/Formelsammlung_physik_Konst.pdf"],"categories":["Units of energy","Heat transfer"],"headings":["Precise definitions","Usage","References","See also"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["mole","unit"]],"members":["mole"],"related":["Unit_of_energy","Gram","Celsius","Metric_system","International_System_of_Units","Joule","Kilojoule","Specific_heat_capacity","Food_energy","Chemistry","Nicolas_Clément","Heat","Standard_atmospheric_pressure","Kelvin","Thermochemistry","CIPM","Calorimetry","Specific_energy","Chemical_reaction","Mole_(unit)","Kilocalorie_per_mole","Bond_energy","Activation_barrier","ISO_31-4","International_Organization_for_Standardization","Empty_calorie","Basal_metabolic_rate","Food_energy","Nutrition_facts_label","Conversion_of_units_of_energy"]}
