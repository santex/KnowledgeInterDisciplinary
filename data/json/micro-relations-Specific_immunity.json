Both immune systems are\n\"adaptive\" in the physiological and evolutionary sense of allowing the organism\nto adapt to changing external circumstances. Both can be maladaptive in sense\nthat over-activity can lead to pathological inflammation and/or autoimmunity.\nThe pathogen-receptors of innate and acquired immune mechanisms are both\nspecific, but the specificities of the former have evolved over evolutionary\ntime for highly conserved molecular features of the microbial world, while the\nspecificities of the latter mature in each organism. For this reason, the term\n'acquired' is generally preferred over 'adaptive' or 'specific'.\n\nBoth jawless (class Agnatha) and jawed vertebrates have acquired immune systems.\nThe former generates acquired immune receptors using LRR (leucine-rich repeat)-\nbased variable segments rearranged at the DNA level through the activity of a\ncytosine deaminase enzyme. In contrast, Jawed vertebrates generate acquired\nimmune receptors using immunoglobulin family-related variable segments\nrearranged at the DNA level through RAG recombinase. The acquired immune system\nis activated by the ânon-specificâ and evolutionarily older innate immune system\n(which is the major system of host defense against pathogens in nearly all other\nliving things). The acquired immune response provides the vertebrate immune\nsystem with the ability to recognize and remember specific pathogens (to\ngenerate immunity), and to mount stronger attacks each time the pathogen is\nencountered. It is 'adaptive' in the sense that it prepares the body's immune\nsystem for future challenges by the same or related pathogen. Conversely, it is\n'maladaptive' when it results in autoimmunity.\n\nThe system is highly adaptable because of somatic hypermutation (a process of\naccelerated somatic mutations), and V(D)J recombination (an irreversible genetic\nrecombination of antigen receptor gene segments). This mechanism allows a small\nnumber of genes to generate a vast number of different antigen receptors, which\nare then uniquely expressed on each individual lymphocyte. Because the gene\nrearrangement leads to an irreversible change in the DNA of each cell, all of\nthe progeny (offspring) of that cell will then inherit genes encoding the same\nreceptor specificity, including the Memory B cells and Memory T cells that are\nthe keys to long-lived specific immunity.\n\nImmune network theory is a theory due chiefly to Niels Kaj Jerne of how the\nacquired immune system works, that is based on interactions between 'idiotypes'\n(unique molecular features\" of one clonotype and 'anti-idiotypes\" (antigen\nreceptors that react with the idiotype as if it were a foreign antigen).\n","linknr":738,"url":"Specific_immunity","recorded":1362375080,"links":40,"instances":["medical"],"pdf":["http://www.niaid.nih.gov/publications/immune/the_immune_system.pdf"],"categories":["Immune system"],"headings":["Functions","Lymphocytes","Antigen presentation","T lymphocytes","B lymphocytes and antibody production","Alternative acquired immune system","Immunological memory","Immunological diversity","Acquired immunity during pregnancy","See also","External links","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/SEM_Lymphocyte.jpg/200px-SEM_Lymphocyte.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4d/Antigen_presentation.svg/220px-Antigen_presentation.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/db/T_cell_activation.svg/280px-T_cell_activation.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/B_cell_activation.png/230px-B_cell_activation.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/33/Antibody.jpg/130px-Antibody.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["immunity","medical"],["v(dj_recombination"],["v(dj_recombination"],["v(dj_recombination"]],"members":["immunity"],"related":["Lymphocyte","Pathogen","Innate_immune_system","Immunity_(medical)","Adaptation","Somatic_hypermutation","Somatic_cell","Mutation","V(D)J_recombination","Genetic_recombination","Lymphocyte","DNA","Offspring","Memory_B_cell","Memory_T_cells","Immune_network_theory","Niels_Kaj_Jerne","Antigen_presentation","Lymphocytes","Leukocyte","B_cell","T_cell","Brain","Lymphatic_system","Multipotent_hematopoietic_stem_cell","Humoral_immune_response","Cell-mediated_immune_response","Vertebrate","Agnatha","Thymus","Naive_cell","Effector_cell","Antigens","Erythrocyte","Dendritic_cells","Macrophages","Antigen_presenting_cells","Exogenous","Chemotactic","Enzyme","Antigen","Major_histocompatibility_complex","Human_leukocyte_antigen","MHC_class_II","Endogenous","MHC_class_I","Erythrocyte","Clonal_expansion","Somatic_cell","Perforin","Granulysin","Plasma_membrane","Ion","Lysis","Granzyme","Serine_protease","Apoptosis","Interferon-gamma","Bactericidal","Cell-mediated_immunity","Interleukin_4","Humoral_immunity","Intracellular","Extracellular","Toxin","HIV","Regulatory_T_cells","Immune_tolerance","Gamma/delta_T_cells","T_cell_receptor","CD1d_receptor","Natural_Killer_T_cell","V(D)J_recombination","Junctional_diversity","Pattern_recognition_receptor","Non-peptidic_antigen","Antibodies","Blood_plasma","Humoral_immunity","IgA","IgD","IgE","IgG","IgM","Helper_T_cell","Cellular_differentiation","Plasma_cells","Complement_cascade","Memory_B_cell","Antibody","T_cell_receptor","Lymphocyte","Agnatha","Lamprey","Hagfish","Gene","Antigen","Infant","Maternal","Placenta","Breast_milk","Passive_immunization","Blood_plasma","Sanitation","Immunization","Vaccination","Antigen","Adaptive_immune_response","Vaccine","Attenuated_vaccine","Acellular","Toxin","Innate_immune_system","Protein","Polysaccharide","Epitope","Gene","Clonal_selection","V(D)J_recombination","Fetus","Uterus","Pregnancy","Eu-FEDS","Vivipary","Monotreme","Endogenous_retroviruses","Viral_fusion_proteins","Syncytium","Epithelium","Vivipary","Human_genome_project","Endogenous_retrovirus","Affinity_maturation","Allelic_exclusion","Anergy","Immune_tolerance","Immunosuppression","Original_antigenic_sin","Somatic_hypermutation","Polyclonal_response"]}
