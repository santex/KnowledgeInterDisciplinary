He obtained his PhD from Balliol College, Oxford and\ndid his early research on the theory of electrons in liquid metals at University\nof Cambridge.\n\nIn 1964 he was appointed professor of theoretical physics at University of\nBristol, where he wrote his Elements Of Advanced Quantum Theory (1969) which\nexplains the rudiments of quantum field theory with a elementary condensed\nmatter slant. During this period, his interests shifted towards the philosophy\nof science. He argued about the social dimension of\nscience, and the social\nresponsibility of scientists in numerous essays and books.\n\nHe married twice, to Rosemary Dixon in 1951 and secondly to Joan Solomon and was\nsurvived by his second wife and three of his four children.\n","recorded":1362123733,"portal":[],"list":[],"links":"132","instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.phy.bris.ac.uk/people/berry_mv/the_papers/Berry394.pdf","http://www.phy.bris.ac.uk/people/berry_mv/the_papers/Berry394.pdf"],"categories":["1925 births","People from Cambridge","English Jews","2005 deaths","English physicists","New Zealand physicists","Naturalised citizens of New Zealand","Jewish scientists","Fellows of the Royal Society","Alumni of King's College, Cambridge"],"headings":["Selected books authored by Ziman","References"],"tags":[],"image":["http://en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Wikiquote-logo-en.svg/40px-Wikiquote-logo-en.svg.png","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Flag_of_New_Zealand.svg","http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/Flag_of_New_Zealand.svg/40px-Flag_of_New_Zealand.svg.png","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Scientist.svg","http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/03/Scientist.svg/30px-Scientist.svg.png","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Science-symbol-2.svg","http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/75/Science-symbol-2.svg/30px-Science-symbol-2.svg.png","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Albert_Einstein_Head.jpg","http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d3/Albert_Einstein_Head.jpg/30px-Albert_Einstein_Head.jpg","http://bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","http://bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"related":["University_of_Bristol","University_of_Oxford","Victoria_University_of_Wellington","University_of_Cambridge","Fellow_of_the_Royal_Society","Physicist","Humanism","Condensed_matter_physics","The_Guardian","England","New_Zealand","Hamilton,_New_Zealand","Balliol_College,_Oxford","Electron","Metal","University_of_Cambridge","Theoretical_physics","University_of_Bristol","Quantum_field_theory","Philosophy_of_science"],"members":[],"book":[]}
