{"cursor":"14310","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nIn computational biology 'gene prediction' or 'gene finding' refers to the\nprocess of identifying the regions of genomic DNA that encode genes. This\nincludes protein-coding genes as well as RNA genes, but may also include\nprediction of other functional elements such as regulatory regions. Gene finding\nis one of the first and most important steps in understanding the genome of a\nspecies once it has been sequenced.\n\nIn its earliest days, \"gene finding\" was based on painstaking experimentation on\nliving cells and organisms. Statistical analysis of the rates of homologous\nrecombination of several different genes could determine their order on a\ncertain chromosome, and information from many such experiments could be combined\nto create a genetic map specifying the rough location of known genes relative to\neach other. Today, with comprehensive genome sequence and powerful computational\nresources at the disposal of the research community, gene finding has been\nredefined as a largely computational problem.\n\nDetermining that a sequence is functional should be distinguished from\ndetermining the function of the gene or its product. The latter still demands\n[[in vivo]] experimentation through gene knockout and other assays, although\nfrontiers of bioinformatics research are making it increasingly possible to\npredict the function of a gene based on its sequence alone.\n","linknr":325,"url":"Gene_finding","recorded":1362505162,"links":24,"instances":["biology","genetics"],"pdf":["http://www.cs.ubc.ca/grads/resources/thesis/Nov06/Rogic_Sanja.pdf","http://www.cs.ubc.ca/grads/resources/thesis/Nov06/Rogic_Sanja.pdf"],"categories":["Bioinformatics","Mathematical and theoretical biology","Markov models"],"headings":["Extrinsic approaches","''Ab initio'' approaches","Combined approaches","Comparative genomics approaches","See also","External links","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/11/Gene_structure.svg/350px-Gene_structure.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["transcription","genetics"],["promoter","biology"]],"members":["promoter","transcription"],"related":["Computational_biology","Genes","Gene","RNA_gene","Regulatory_regions","Sequencing","Homologous_recombination","Chromosome","Genetic_map","Gene_knockout","Bioinformatics","Messenger_RNA","Protein","Transcription_(genetics)","Genetic_code","BLAST","List_of_distinct_cell_types_in_the_adult_human_body","RefSeq","Ensembl","Genomic","DNA_sequence","Prokaryotes","Promoter_(biology)","Pribnow_box","Transcription_factor","Binding_site","Open_reading_frame","Base_pair","Stop_codon","Random_sequence","Frequency","Eukaryotes","CpG_island","Polyadenylation","RNA_splicing","Exons","Introns","Probabilistic_model","Hidden_Markov_model","GLIMMER","GeneMark","GENSCAN","Geneid","MGene","Machine_learning","Support_vector_machines","Discriminative_model","Hidden_Markov_support_vector_machine","Conditional_random_field","K-mer","Fourier_transform","Z-curve","Secondary_structure","Expressed_sequence_tag","Comparative_genomics","Natural_selection","List_of_gene_prediction_software","Sequence_mining"]}
