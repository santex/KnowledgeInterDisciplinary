{"cursor":"2883","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Suction' is the flow of a fluid into a partial vacuum, or region of low\npressure. The pressure gradient between this region and the ambient pressure\nwill propel matter toward the low pressure area. Suction is popularly thought of\nas an attractive effect, which is incorrect since vacuums do not innately\nattract matter. Dust being \"sucked\" into a vacuum cleaner is actually being\npushed in by the higher pressure air on the outside of the cleaner.\n\nThe higher pressure of the surrounding fluid can push matter into a vacuum but a\nvacuum cannot attract matter.\n\nHumans can create a sucking effect with the use of the lips, as in the case of\ndrinking through a straw.\n","linknr":118,"url":"Suction","recorded":1362567910,"links":22,"instances":["medicine","length","mechanical_process"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Physical quantities","Units of pressure","Vacuum"],"headings":["Pumps","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["foot","length"],["suction","medicine"],["implosion","mechanical_process"]],"members":["suction","foot","implosion"],"related":["Vacuum","Pressure_gradient_force","Vacuum_cleaner","Drinking_straw","Pumps","Centrifugal_pump","Atmospheric_pressure","Foot_(length)","Siphon","Suction_(medicine)","Implosion_(mechanical_process)","Suction_cup","Suction_cupping","Vacuum","Vacuum_cleaner"]}
