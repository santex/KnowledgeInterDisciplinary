He is one of the founders of modern bacteriology and microbiology.\n\nFerdinand Cohn was born in the Jewish quarter of Breslau in the Prussian\nProvince of Silesia (which is now Wroclaw, Poland). http://www.pnf.org/comp-\nendium/Ferdinand_Julius_Cohn.pdf http://www.microbeworld.org/images/s-\ntories/history_pdfs/f3.pdf His father, Issak Cohn, was a successful\nmerchant and manufacturer. At the age of 10 Ferdinand suffered hearing\nimpairment (for an unknown reason). Starting at age 16 he studied botany under\nHeinrich Goppert at the University of Breslau. Due to Cohn's Jewish background\nhe was prevented from taking the final degree examinations at Breslau. http://biography.yourdictionary.com/ferdinand-\ncohn http://www.microbeworld.org/images/stories/history_pdfs/f3.pdf http://www.pnf.org/compendium/Ferdinand_Julius_Cohn.pdf He then\nmoved to the University of Berlin. At age 19 in 1847 he received a degree in\nbotany at Berlin. He remained studying botany for another couple of years in\nBerlin, where he came in contact with many of the top scientists of his time.\n\nIn 1849 he returned to the University of Breslau and he remained at that\nuniversity for the rest of his career as a teacher and researcher. On his\ninitial return to Breslau in his early twenties, his father had bought for him a\nlarge and expensive microscope made by Simon PlÃ¶ssl. This microscope, which the\nUniversity of Breslau and most universities in did not have, was Ferdinanad\nCohn's main research tool in the 1850s. In the 1850s he studied the growth and\ndivision of plant cells. In 1855 he produced papers on the sexuality of\nSphaeroplea annulina and later Volvox globator. In the 1860s he studied plant\nphysiology in several different aspects. From 1870 onward he mostly studied\nbacteria. He published over 150 research reports during his lifetime. The\nUniversity of Breslau became an innovative center for plant physiology and\nmicrobiology while he was there.\n\nCohn was the first to classify algae as plants, and to define what distinguishes\nthem from green plants. His classification of bacteria into four groups based on\nshape (sphericals, short rods, threads, and spirals) is still in use today.\nAmong other things Cohn is remembered for being the first to show that Bacillus\ncan change from a vegetative state to an endospore state when subjected to an\nenvironment deleterious to the vegetative state.\n\nIn 1885 he received the Leeuwenhoek Medal.\n","linknr":146,"url":"Ferdinand_Cohn","recorded":1362505857,"links":37,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.pnf.org/compendium/Ferdinand_Julius_Cohn.pdf","http://www.microbeworld.org/images/stories/history_pdfs/f3.pdf","http://www.pnf.org/compendium/Ferdinand_Julius_Cohn.pdf","http://www.microbeworld.org/images/stories/history_pdfs/f3.pdf","http://www.microbeworld.org/images/stories/history_pdfs/f3.pdf","http://www.pnf.org/compendium/Ferdinand_Julius_Cohn.pdf"],"categories":["1828 births","1898 deaths","German microbiologists","German botanists","Jewish scientists","German Jews","People from Wrocław","People from the Province of Silesia","University of Breslau faculty","Foreign Members of the Royal Society","Leeuwenhoek Medal winners"],"headings":["References and external Links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fd/Ferdinand_Julius_Cohn_1828-1898.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/38px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Germany","Biologist","Breslau","Kingdom_of_Prussia","Province_of_Silesia","Wroclaw","Poland","Heinrich_Goppert","University_of_Breslau","Simon_Plössl","Sphaeroplea","Volvox_globator","Algae","Plant","Bacillus","Endospore","Leeuwenhoek_Medal"]}
