{"cursor":"13297","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nIn computing, 'memory' refers to the physical devices used to store programs\n(sequences of instructions) or data (e.g. program state information) on a\ntemporary or permanent basis for use in a computer or other digital electronic\ndevice. The term primary memory is used for the information in physical systems\nwhich function at high-speed (i.e. RAM), as a distinction from secondary memory,\nwhich are physical devices for program and data storage which are slow to access\nbut offer higher memory capacity. Primary memory stored on secondary memory is\ncalled \"virtual memory\". An archaic synonym for memory is 'store'. A.M.\nTuring and R.A. Brooker (1952). [http://www.alanturing.net/turing_archive/archive/m/m01/M01-\n005.html Programmer's Handbook for Manchester Electronic Computer Mark II].\nUniversity of Manchester.\n\nThe term \"memory\", meaning primary memory is often (but not always) associated\nwith addressable semiconductor memory, i.e. integrated circuits consisting of\nsilicon-based transistors, used for example as primary memory but also other\npurposes in computers and other digital electronic devices. There are two main\ntypes of semiconductor memory: volatile and non-volatile. Examples of non-\nvolatile memory are flash memory (sometimes used as secondary, sometimes\nprimary computer memory) and ROM/PROM/EPROM/EEPROM memory (used for firmware\nsuch as boot programs). Examples of volatile memory are primary memory\n(typically dynamic RAM, DRAM), and fast CPU cache memory (typically static RAM,\nSRAM, which is fast but energy-consuming and offer lower memory capacity per\narea unit than DRAM) .\n\nThe semiconductor memory is organized into memory cells or bistable flip-flops,\neach storing one binary bit (0 or 1). The memory cells are grouped into words of\nfix word length, for example 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 or 128 bit. Each word can be\naccessed by a binary address of N bit, making it possible to store 2 raised by N\nwords in the memory. This implies that processor registers normally are not\nconsidered as memory, since they only store one word and do not include an\naddressing mechanism.\n\nThe term 'storage' is often (but not always) used to describe secondary memory\nsuch as tape, magnetic disks and optical discs (CD-ROM and DVD-ROM).\n","linknr":275,"url":"Computer_memory","recorded":1362891452,"links":33,"instances":["element","computer_science","computing","computer_science"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Computer memory|","Computer storage|Memory"],"headings":["History","Volatile memory","Non-volatile memory","Management of memory","See also","References","External links","Footnotes"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c9/ENIAC_Penn2.jpg/200px-ENIAC_Penn2.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["state","computer_science"],["accumulator","computing"],["mercury","element"],["thrashing","computer_science"]],"members":["mercury","thrashing","accumulator","state"],"related":["Computing","State_(computer_science)","Computer","Digital","Electronics","Primary_memory","Random-access_memory","Secondary_memory","Computer_data_storage","Virtual_memory","Alan_Turing","Primary_memory","Semiconductor_memory","Integrated_circuits","Silicon","Transistors","Primary_memory","Digital","Electronics","Volatile_memory","Non-volatile_memory","Non-volatile_memory","Flash_memory","Read-only_memory","Programmable_read-only_memory","EPROM","EEPROM","Firmware","Volatile_memory","Primary_memory","Dynamic_random-access_memory","CPU_cache","Static_random-access_memory","Computer_data_storage","Bistable_flip-flop","Bit","Word_length","CPU","Processor_register","Secondary_memory","Magnetic","CD-ROM","DVD","Digital_computer","ENIAC","Vacuum_tube","Accumulator_(computing)","Delay_line_memory","J._Presper_Eckert","Mercury_(element)","Delay_line_memory","Williams_tube","Selectron_tube","Cathode_ray_tube","Random_access_memory","Non-volatile_memory","Jay_Forrester","Jan_A._Rajchman","An_Wang","Magnetic_core_memory","Transistor","Random_Access_Memory","RAM","Volatile_memory","Semiconductor","Static_random_access_memory","DRAM","Z-RAM","TTRAM","A-RAM","ETA_RAM","Non-volatile_memory","Read-only_memory","Flash_memory","Hard_disks","Floppy_discs","Magnetic_tape","Optical_discs","Paper_tape","Punched_cards","FeRAM","CBRAM","Parallel_Random_Access_Machine","SONOS","RRAM","Racetrack_memory","Nano-RAM","Millipede_memory","Operating_system","Arithmetic_overflow","Memory_leak","Segmentation_fault","Buffer_overflow","Thrashing_(computer_science)","Virtual_memory","Semiconductor_memory","Memory_Geometry","Memory_hierarchy"]}
