{"cursor":"45796","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\n\n'Social constructionism' and social constructivism are sociological theories of\nknowledge that consider how social phenomena or objects of consciousness develop\nin social contexts. A social construction (also called a social construct) is a\nconcept or practice that is the construct (or artifact) of a particular group.\nWhen we say that something is socially constructed, we are focusing on its\ndependence on contingent variables of our social selves rather than any inherent\nquality that it possesses in itself. The underlying assumptions on which social\nconstructivism is typically seen to be based are reality, knowledge, and\nlearning.\n","linknr":562,"url":"Social_construct","recorded":1362676285,"links":49,"instances":["philosophy","social_science","philosophy","sociology","psychology","logic"],"pdf":["http://as.nyu.edu/docs/IO/1153/socialconstruction.pdf","http://as.nyu.edu/docs/IO/1153/socialconstruction.pdf","http://evolution.binghamton.edu/dswilson/resources/publications_resources/DSW05.pdf","http://hps.arts.unsw.edu.au/hps_content/staff_homepages/p_slezak_site/Article%20Links/2000/Slezak_SocCon_2000.pdf"],"categories":["Social constructionism|","Consensus reality","Social epistemology","Sociology index","Sociology of knowledge","Sociological theories"],"headings":["Definition","Social constructionist analysis","Applications","The teleology of social construction","History and development","Criticisms","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/Unbalanced_scales.svg/45px-Unbalanced_scales.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/Merge-arrows.svg/50px-Merge-arrows.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c7/SNA_segment.png/180px-SNA_segment.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Wikiquote-logo-en.svg/40px-Wikiquote-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["interpretation","logic"],["object","philosophy"],["objectivity","philosophy"],["phenomenology","philosophy"],["internalisation","sociology"],["identity","social_science"],["phenomenology","psychology"]],"members":["object","identity","objectivity","internalisation","phenomenology","interpretation"],"related":["Social_constructivism","Sociological_theory","Knowledge","Cultural_artifact","Determinism","Essentialism","Transhistorical","Social_phenomena","Interpretation_(logic)","Knowledge","Ian_Hacking","Lev_Vygotsky","Jerome_Bruner","Ian_Hacking","Gender","Quark","Willard_Van_Orman_Quine","Duhem–Quine_thesis","Personal_construct_psychology","Ernst_von_Glasersfeld","Postmodern_social_construction_of_nature","Continental_philosophy","Environmental_sustainability","Systemic_Therapy","Philosophical_position","John_R._Searle","Chinese_room","Strong_AI","David_Deutch","Turing_principle","Frank_Tipler","Omega_point","Divine_right_of_kings","Brute_fact","Steven_Pinker","Tenure","Citizenship","Stanley_Fish","Object_(philosophy)","John_Searle","Ontology","Subjectivity","Epistemology","Objectivity_(philosophy)","Brute_fact","Group_think","Meditations_on_First_Philosophy","Ian_Hacking","Canadian","Ian_Hacking","Rudolf_Carnap","Consensus_reality","Peter_L._Berger","Thomas_Luckmann","Common_sense","Social_interactions","Typification","Signification","Social_institution","Phenomenology_(philosophy)","Heidegger","Edmund_Husserl","Alfred_Schutz","Michel_Foucault","Narrative_turn","Sociology_of_science","Science_and_technology_studies","Karin_Knorr-Cetina","Bruno_Latour","S._Barry_Barnes","Steve_Woolgar","Subjectivity","Andrew_Pickering","Social_construction_of_technology","SCOT","Wiebe_Bijker","Trevor_Pinch","Maarten_van_Wesel","Sal_Restivo","Randall_Collins","Reuben_Hersh","Philip_J._Davis","Paul_Ernest","Postmodernism","Cultural_studies","Cultural_turn","Worldview","Individual","Dialectic","Reality","Imagined_communities","Habituation","Language","Mythology","Socialization","Subjectivity","Internalisation_(sociology)","Identity_(social_science)","Nature_vs._nurture","Evolutionary_psychology","Behavior_genetics","Behavioral_neuroscience","Epigenetics","Alan_Sokal","Postmodernism_Generator","Postmodernism","Paul_Boghossian","Standard_social_science_model","Consensus_reality","Constructivism_in_international_relations","Constructivist_epistemology","Ethnomethodology","Imagined_Communities","Parametric_determinism","Phenomenology_(psychology)","Science_and_technology_studies","Social_construction_of_gender_difference","Social_epistemology","Symbolic_interactionism","Talcott_Parsons","Peter_L._Berger","Thomas_Luckmann","Ian_Hacking","John_Searle","Charles_Arthur_Willard","David_Sloan_Wilson","Sal_Restivo","Jacques_Ellul","Kenneth_Gergen","Peter_Lampe","Sheila_McNamee","Sheila_McNamee","Kenneth_Gergen","Sheila_McNamee","Kenneth_Gergen","Paul_Boghossian"]}
