Although extensively\n used and developed mainly in former Soviet Union countries circa 1920, the\n treatment is not approved in countries other than Georgia. Phage therapy has\n many potential applications in human medicine as well as dentistry, veterinary\n science, and agriculture.

They would\nhave a high therapeutic index, that is, phage therapy would be expected to give\nrise to few side effects. Because phages replicate [[in vivo]], a smaller\neffective dose can be used. On the other hand, this specificity is also a\ndisadvantage: a phage will only kill a bacterium if it is a match to the\nspecific strain. Consequently phage mixtures are often applied to improve the\nchances of success, or samples can be taken and an appropriate phage identified\nand grown.\n\nPhages are currently being used therapeutically to treat bacterial infections\nthat do not respond to conventional antibiotics, particularly in the Republic of\nGeorgia.
