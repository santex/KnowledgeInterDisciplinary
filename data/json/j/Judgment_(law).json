At the same time the\ncourt may also make a range of court orders, such as imposing a sentence upon a\nguilty defendant in a criminal matter, or providing a remedy for the plaintiff\nin a civil matter.\n\nIn the United States, under the rules of civil procedure governing practice in\nfederal courts and most state courts, the entry of judgment is the final order\nentered by the court in the case, leaving no further action to be taken by the\ncourt with respect to the issues contested by the parties to the lawsuit. With\ncertain exceptions, only a final judgment is subject to appeal.\n\nIn some legal systems (particularly civil law jurisdictions), a judgment is not\nconsidered final until after appeals have been exhausted or waived.\n","linknr":252,"url":"Judgment_(law)","recorded":1362669306,"links":31,"instances":["law","law","legal_system"],"pdf":["http://www.maximumassetprotection.com/publications/whitepapers/Collecting-on-Judgements.pdf","http://www.maximumassetprotection.com/publications/whitepapers/Collecting-on-Judgements.pdf"],"categories":["Judgment (law)|"],"headings":["Types","Enforcement","Release of judgment","Spelling","Notes"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["sentence","law"],["guilt","law"],["civil_law","common_law"],["civil_law","legal_system"]],"members":["sentence","guilt","civil_law"],"related":["Legal","Court","Lawsuit","Court_order","Sentence_(law)","Guilt_(law)","Defendant","Criminal_law","Legal_remedy","Plaintiff","Civil_law_(common_law)","United_States","Civil_procedure","Appeal","Civil_law_(legal_system)","Consent_decree","Declaratory_judgment","Default_judgment","Summary_judgment","Vacated_judgment","Lien","Vacated_judgment","Public_records","Credit_history","Illinois","Illinois_General_Assembly","United_Kingdom","Authorized_King_James_Version","Canada","Australia","New_Zealand","South_Africa"]}
