From an\nearly age, Joe has been portraying his love of art through his landscape\npaintings, and then went on to become one of Canada's top wildlife artist.\n\nBorn in Sliema, on the island of Malta, Europe, in 1951, Joe studied art at St.\nPatrick's school in Sliema, and after graduating with a diploma in art and\ndegree in printing and design, Joe found employment with a local printing\nestablishment as a graphic artist.

He immediately fell in love with the magnificent\nnatural habitat and its abundant wildlife.\n\nJoe was soon busy with his paint brush, and soon gained recognition, especially\nwith the local collectors, for its detailed realistic approach.
