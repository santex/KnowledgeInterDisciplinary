{"cursor":"5598","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'John of NikiÃ»' was an Egyptian Coptic bishop of NikiÃ»/Pashati in the Nile Delta\nand general administrator of the monasteries of Upper Egypt in 696. He was\nauthor of a Chronicle extending from Adam to the end of the Muslim conquest of\nEgypt which contains important historical details otherwise unknown.\n\nAccording to the [[Severus of Al'Ashmunein (Hermopolis): History of the\nPatriarchs of the Coptic Church of Alexandria|History of the Patriarchs]] by\nSeverus, Bishop of Al-Ashmunyn (Heliopolis), John of NikiÃ» lived under the\nPatriarchs John III, Isaac, and Simeon. But when John disciplined a monk guilty\nof some moral offense so severely that the monk died ten days later, the\nPatriarch Simeon removed John from his office.\n\nJohn of NikiÃ»'s Chronicle was originally written mostly in Greek. Some of the\nname forms indicate that John may have also written the sections concerning\nEgypt in Coptic. The work survives only in a Ge'ez translation made in 1602 of\nan Arabic translation of the original. Sections of the text are obviously\ncorrupted with unfortunate accidental omissions. Most notably, a passage\ncovering thirty years from 610 to 640 is missing.\n\nJohn's view of the earliest periods of history is informed by sources such as\nSextus Julius Africanus and John Malalas. The Chronicle is most noteworthy for\nits passages dealing with the early 7th century. John covers in detail the\nrevolt of the Thracian armies in 602 and the subsequent overthrow of the Emperor\nMaurice by the usurper Phocas. His account adds considerably to our knowledge of\nthe reign of Phocas and particularly to the successful revolt against him begun\nat Carthage by Heraclius. Unfortunately, the section dealing with the climactic\nPersian wars waged by Heraclius is not extant.\n\nPerhaps the most important section of John's Chronicle is that which deals with\nthe invasion and conquest of Egypt by the Muslim armies of Amr ibn al-Aas.\nThough probably not an eyewitness, John was most likely of the generation\nimmediately following the conquest, and the Chronicle provides the only near-\ncontemporary account. John describes the major events of Amr's campaign, such as\nthe taking of the Roman fortress at Babylon and the capture of Alexandria.\nThough his details are often vivid, his timeline is occasionally confusing.\n\nJohn credits the Muslims for not destroying Christian holy places, but he also\nrecords the numerous atrocities committed against the Egyptians and the\nprohibitive new taxes placed on the native population. In some cases, the taxes\nwere so burdensome that families were forced to sell their children into\nslavery. John also does not fail to mention in harsh terms the numerous\nEgyptians who abandoned Christianity in favor of Islam.\n\nWriting from an Oriental Orthodox point of view â at odds with the diophysite\nChristology affirmed at the Council of Chalcedon in 451 â John describes the\nIslamic invasion of his homeland as divine punishment for the Chalcedonian\nheresy which held sway in the Byzantine Empire. At the close of his Chronicle\nJohn describes the despair felt by the conquered Alexandrians, writing: \"None\ncould recount the mourning and lamentation which took place in that city....And\nthey had none to help them, and God destroyed their hopes and delivered the\nChristians into the hands of their enemies.\" However, the account ends on a note\nof hope and faith: \"But the strong beneficence of God will put to shame those\nwho grieve us, and He will make His love for man to triumph over our sins, and\nbring to naught the evil purposes of those who afflict us, who would not that\nthe King of Kings and Lord of Lords should reign over them, (even) Jesus Christ\nour true God. As for those wicked slaves, He will destroy them in evil fashion:\nas saith the holy Gospel: 'As for Mine enemies who would not that I should reign\nover them, bring them unto Me.'\"\n","linknr":119,"url":"John_of_Nikiû","recorded":1375069376,"links":["/w/index.php?title=John_of_Niki%C3%BB&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=John_of_Niki%C3%BB&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Egyptians","/wiki/Copt","/wiki/Nile_Delta","/wiki/Egypt","/wiki/Adam_and_Eve","/wiki/Muslim_conquest_of_Egypt","/wiki/Severus_of_Al%27Ashmunein_(Hermopolis):_History_of_the_Patriarchs_of_the_Coptic_Church_of_Alexandria","/wiki/Severus_Ibn_al-Muqaffa","/wiki/Heliopolis_(ancient)","/wiki/Pope_John_III_of_Alexandria","/wiki/Pope_Isaac_of_Alexandria","/wiki/Pope_Simeon_of_Alexandria","/wiki/Greek_language","/wiki/Ge%27ez","/wiki/Sextus_Julius_Africanus","/wiki/John_Malalas","/wiki/Maurice_(emperor)","/wiki/Phocas","/wiki/Carthage","/wiki/Heraclius","/wiki/Amr_ibn_al-Aas","/wiki/Oriental_Orthodox","/wiki/Diophysite","/wiki/Council_of_Chalcedon","/w/index.php?title=John_of_Niki%C3%BB&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/R._H._Charles","/wiki/Hermann_Zotenberg","/wiki/Special:BookSources/9781889758879","http://www.evolpub.com/CRE/CREseries.html#CRE4","http://gallica.bnf.fr/document?O=N108650","http://gallica.bnf.fr/","/w/index.php?title=John_of_Niki%C3%BB&action=edit&section=2","http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/nikiu1_intro.htm","http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/nikiu2_chronicle.htm","http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/fathers/nikiu1_intro.htm","http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/fathers/nikiu2_chronicle.htm","http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08475a.htm","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_of_Nikiû&oldid=549382262","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Egyptian_historians","/wiki/Category:7th-century_historians","/wiki/Category:Coptic_Christians_from_Egypt","/wiki/Category:Egyptian_bishops","/wiki/Category:7th-century_bishops","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=John+of+Niki%C3%BB&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=John+of+Niki%C3%BB","/wiki/John_of_Niki%C3%BB","/wiki/Talk:John_of_Niki%C3%BB","#","/wiki/John_of_Niki%C3%BB","/w/index.php?title=John_of_Niki%C3%BB&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=John_of_Niki%C3%BB&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/John_of_Niki%C3%BB","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/John_of_Niki%C3%BB","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=John_of_Niki%C3%BB&oldid=549382262","/w/index.php?title=John_of_Niki%C3%BB&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q981912","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=John_of_Niki%C3%BB&id=549382262","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=John+of+Niki%C3%BB","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=John+of+Niki%C3%BB&oldid=549382262&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=John_of_Niki%C3%BB&printable=yes","//bg.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%99%D0%BE%D0%B0%D0%BD_%D0%9D%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%B8%D1%83%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8","//de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_von_Nikiu","//el.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%99%CF%89%CE%AC%CE%BD%CE%BD%CE%B7%CF%82_%CE%9D%CE%B9%CE%BA%CE%AF%CE%BF%CF%85","//es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_de_Niki%C3%BB","//fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_de_Nikiou","//arz.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D9%8A%D9%88%D8%AD%D9%86%D8%A7_%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D9%8A%D9%82%D8%A7%D9%88%D9%89","//pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_z_Nikiu","//pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jo%C3%A3o_de_Nikiu","//ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%98%D0%BE%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BD_%D0%9D%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%B8%D1%83%D1%81%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9","//sr.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%88%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BD_%D0%B8%D0%B7_%D0%9D%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%B8%D1%98%D1%83%D0%B0","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q981912#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wik
