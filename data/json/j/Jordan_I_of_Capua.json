{"cursor":"5302","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Jordan I' () (after 1046 â€“ 1091), count of Aversa and prince of Capua\nfrom 1078 to his death, was the eldest son and successor of Prince Richard I of\nCapua and Fressenda, a daughter of Tancred of Hauteville and his second wife,\nalso named Fressenda, and the nephew of Robert Guiscard, duke of Apulia,\nCalabria, and Sicily. He, according to William of Apulia, \"equalled in his\nvirtues both the duke and his father.\" [http://www.leeds.ac.uk/history/webl-\nearning/MedievalHistoryTextCentre/william%20ap%202.doc William of Apulia.]\n\nIn 1078, while his father was besieging Naples with Robert Guiscard, he and\nRobert, count of Loritello, were ravaging the Abruzzi, then papal territory. He,\nhis father, and the duke were all excommunicated, when, suddenly, his father\nfell ill, retired to Capua, reconciled with the church, and died. Jordan,\nfearing to rule under the ban of the church, called off the siege of Naples and\nwent to Rome to reconcile himself to Pope Gregory VII and rectify his relations\nwith the church, of which his father had been both servant and protector. It\nappears that he intended to take up the position of his father vis-a-vis the\npapacy and to return to unfriendly relations with the duke of Apulia, for\nGregory visited Capua a mere three months after Richard's death and Jordan,\nprobably with papal prodding, began fomenting revolt in the Guiscard's lands.\nThe revolt, the widely supported and well-organised, was ineffectual in really\ncurbing Robert's influence and power.\n\nOne of his chief advisors was the abbot of Montecassino, Desiderius of\nBenevento, who mediated between the prince and the Emperor Henry IV on the\nlatter's descent into Italy (1081). Jordan forsook his erstwhile papal ally in\nexchange for an imperial investiture. Though Robert Guiscard and his brother\nRoger marched against him, Roger was recalled to Sicily and the expedition\nfell apart.\n\nIn 1085, on Robert's death, Jordan supported Bohemond, the elder son, over Roger\nBorsa, the eldest by Sichelgaita, who was his own sister-in-law, he having\nmarried Gaitelgrima, another daughter of Prince Guaimar IV of Salerno. For the\nnext three years, Bohemond held Apulia with the assistance of well-trained\nCapuan armies. In that same year, the pope died and the antipope Clement III\ncontinued to claim the papacy. In hopes of curbing the influence of Clement and\nunited his interests with those of the papacy once again, he pressured the\nCollege of Cardinals to elect Desiderius of Montecassino as successor Gregory.\nAt the same time, Roger Borsa freed the captured imperial prefect of Rome in\nopposition to the pretensions of Jordan and the Papal Curia, which had refused\nconfirmation of Roger's archiepiscopal candidate for Salerno. The move backfired\nand Desiderius, under pressure from Jordan to accept, was elected pope as Victor\nIII. With the aid of armies from Jordan and the Countess Matilda of Tuscany,\nVictor took the Vatican Hill from Clement on 1 July 1086. The pope remained\nlukewarm to his new job until Jordan suggested that only through decisive action\ncould the good fortune of his beloved abbey of Montecassino be sustained. This\nled to an important synod at Benevento (1087), where Clement was excommunicated,\nlay investiture outlawed, and war with the Saracens of Africa declared.\n\nThe remainder of Jordan's career was not notable and he died in November 1090 or\n1091 in Piperna (near Terracina) and was buried in the monastery he had long\nsupported, Montecassino, leaving a young son named Richard who succeeded him.\nHis other sons, Robert and Jordan, would also succeed to the Capuan throne some\nday, and he left one unnamed daughter.\n","linknr":138,"url":"Jordan_I_of_Capua","recorded":1375082773,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Jordan_I_of_Capua&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Jordan_I_of_Capua&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Italian_language","/wiki/Aversa","/wiki/Prince_of_Capua","/wiki/Richard_I_of_Capua","/w/index.php?title=Fressenda&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Tancred_of_Hauteville","/wiki/Robert_Guiscard","/wiki/Count_of_Apulia","/wiki/Calabria","/wiki/Sicily","/wiki/William_of_Apulia","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Naples","/wiki/Robert_I_of_Loritello","/wiki/Loritello","/wiki/Abruzzi","/wiki/Papal_States","/wiki/Rome","/wiki/Pope_Gregory_VII","/wiki/Papacy","/wiki/Montecassino","/wiki/Victor_III","/wiki/Emperor_Henry_IV","/wiki/Roger_I_of_Sicily","/wiki/Bohemond_I_of_Antioch","/wiki/Roger_Borsa","/wiki/Sichelgaita","/wiki/Gaitelgrima,_daughter_of_Guaimar_IV","/wiki/Guaimar_IV_of_Salerno","/wiki/Antipope_Clement_III","/wiki/College_of_Cardinals","/wiki/Papal_Curia","/wiki/Salerno","/wiki/Matilda_of_Tuscany","/wiki/Vatican_Hill","/wiki/Benevento","/wiki/Lay_investiture","/wiki/Saracen","/wiki/Africa","/wiki/Terracina","/wiki/Montecassino","/wiki/Richard_II_of_Capua","/wiki/Robert_I_of_Capua","/wiki/Jordan_II_of_Capua","/w/index.php?title=Jordan_I_of_Capua&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/William_of_Apulia","http://www.leeds.ac.uk/history/weblearning/MedievalHistoryTextCentre/william%20ap%201.doc","http://www.leeds.ac.uk/history/weblearning/MedievalHistoryTextCentre/william%20ap%202.doc","/wiki/John_Julius_Norwich","/w/index.php?title=Jordan_I_of_Capua&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-1","http://www.leeds.ac.uk/history/weblearning/MedievalHistoryTextCentre/william%20ap%202.doc","/wiki/Richard_I_of_Capua","/wiki/Aversa","/wiki/Richard_II_of_Capua","/wiki/Prince_of_Capua","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jordan_I_of_Capua&oldid=556890570","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1091_deaths","/wiki/Category:Normans","/wiki/Category:Italo-Normans","/wiki/Category:Princes_of_Capua","/wiki/Category:Counts_of_Aversa","/wiki/Category:Articles_containing_Italian-language_text","/wiki/Category:Use_dmy_dates_from_January_2012","/wiki/Category:Year_of_birth_unknown","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Jordan+I+of+Capua&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Jordan+I+of+Capua","/wiki/Jordan_I_of_Capua","/wiki/Talk:Jordan_I_of_Capua","#","/wiki/Jordan_I_of_Capua","/w/index.php?title=Jordan_I_of_Capua&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Jordan_I_of_Capua&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Jordan_I_of_Capua","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Jordan_I_of_Capua","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Jordan_I_of_Capua&oldid=556890570","/w/index.php?title=Jordan_I_of_Capua&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1095078","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Jordan_I_of_Capua&id=556890570","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Jordan+I+of+Capua","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Jordan+I+of+Capua&oldid=556890570&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Jordan_I_of_Capua&printable=yes","//ar.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D8%AC%D9%88%D8%B1%D8%AF%D8%A7%D9%86_%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D9%88%D9%84_%D9%85%D9%86_%D9%83%D8%A7%D8%A8%D9%88%D8%A7","//fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jourdain_Ier_d%27Aversa","//ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iordan_I_de_Capua","//ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%96%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B4%D0%B0%D0%BD_I_(%D0%BA%D0%BD%D1%8F%D0%B7%D1%8C_%D0%9A%D0%B0%D0%BF%D1%83%D0%B8)","//sl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_I._Kapuanski"
