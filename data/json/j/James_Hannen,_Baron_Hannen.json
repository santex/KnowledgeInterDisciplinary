{"cursor":"4411","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'James Hannen, Baron Hannen' PC FRS, (19 March 1821 â 29 March 1894), English\njudge, son of a London merchant, was born at Peckham.\n\nHe was educated at St Paul's School and at Heidelberg University, which was\nfamous as a school of law. Called to the bar at the Middle Temple in 1848, he\njoined the home circuit. At this time he also wrote for the press, and supplied\nspecial reports for the Morning Chronicle. Though not eloquent in speech, he was\nclear, accurate and painstaking, and soon advanced in his profession, passing\nmany more brilliant competitors. He appeared for the claimant in the Shrewsbury\npeerage case in 1858, when the 3rd Earl Talbot was declared to be entitled to\nthe earldom of Shrewsbury as the descendant of the 2nd earl; was principal agent\nfor Great Britain on the mixed British and American commission for the\nsettlement of outstanding claims, 1853â1855; and assisted in the prosecution of\nthe Fenian prisoners at Manchester.\n\nIn 1868, Hannen was appointed a judge of the Court of Queen's Bench. In many\ncases he took a strong position of his own, notably in that of Farrar v. Close\n(1869), which materially affected the legal status of trade unions and was\nregarded by unionists as a severe blow to their interests. Hannen became judge\nof the Court of Probate and Court for Divorce and Matrimonial Causes in 1872. By\nvirtue of being the Probate Judge, he became President of the Probate, Divorce\nand Admiralty Division by operation of the Judicature Acts when three courts\nbecame part of the new High Court of Justice. Here he showed himself a worthy\nsuccessor to Cresswell and Penzance.\n\nMany important causes came before him, but he will chiefly be remembered for the\nmanner in which he presided over the Parnell special commission. His influence\npervaded the whole proceedings, and it is understood that he personally penned a\nlarge part of the voluminous report. Hannen's last public service was in\nconnection with the Bering Sea inquiry at Paris, when he acted as one of the\nBritish arbitrators. In January 1891 he was appointed a Lord of Appeal in\nOrdinary with the dignity of a life peerage as 'Baron Hannen', of Burdock in the\nCounty of Sussex, but in that capacity he had few opportunities for displaying\nhis powers, and he retired at the close of the session of 1893.\n\nHe was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in March 1891. He died\nin London, after a prolonged illness, on 29 March 1894 and is interred in the\ncatacombs of West Norwood Cemetery\n\nHe was the elder brother of Sir Nicholas John Hannen who was Chief Justice of\nthe British Supreme Court for China and Japan from 1891 to 1900 and concurrently\nBritish Consul General at Shanghai from 1891 to 1898. Nicholas Hannen also\nserved as the Judge of the British Court for Japan from 1881 to\n1891.
