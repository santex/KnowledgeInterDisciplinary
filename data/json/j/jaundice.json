This\nhyperbilirubinemia subsequently causes increased levels of bilirubin in the\nextracellular fluid. Concentration of bilirubin in blood plasma is normally\nbelow 1.2 mg/dL ( The term jaundice\ncomes from the French word [[wikt:jaune#French|jaune]], meaning yellow.\n\nJaundice is often seen in liver disease such as hepatitis or liver cancer. It\nmay also indicate leptospirosis or obstruction of the biliary tract, for example\nby gallstones or pancreatic cancer, or less commonly be congenital in origin\n(e.g., biliary atresia).\n\nYellow discoloration of the skin, especially on the palms and the soles, but not\nof the sclera and mucous membranes (i.e. oral cavity) is due to carotenemiaâa\nharmless condition Carotenemia, Author: Robert A Schwartz, MD, MPH; Chief\nEditor: Dirk M Elston, MD, http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1104368-\noverview#showall important to differentiate from jaundice.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"jaundice","recorded":1363523630,"links":[],"instances":["biochemistry","biology","unit"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Symptoms and signs"],"headings":["Signs and symptoms","Differential diagnosis","Pathophysiology","Diagnostic approach","Complications","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["mole","unit"],["tissue","biology"],["bilin","biochemistry"]],"members":["bilin","tissue","mole"],"related":["Hepatic_failure","Yellow","Conjunctiva","Sclera","Mucous_membrane","Hyperbilirubinemia","Bilirubin","Extracellular_fluid","Blood_plasma","Milligram","Decilitre","Mole_(unit)","Litre","Hepatitis","Liver_cancer","Leptospirosis","Biliary_tract","Gallstones","Pancreatic_cancer","Biliary_atresia","Skin","Sclera","Mucous_membranes","Carotenemia","G6PD_deficiency","Fava_bean","Tissue_(biology)","Bilin_(biochemistry)","Sclera","Liver","Hemolysis","Red_blood_cell","Malaria","Genetic_disorder","Sickle_cell_anemia","Spherocytosis","Thalassemia","Glucose_6-phosphate_dehydrogenase_deficiency","Hemolytic_uremic_syndrome","Bilirubin_metabolism","Gilbert's_syndrome","Crigler-Najjar_syndrome","Gut_flora","Kernicterus","Blood_brain_barrier","Hepatitis","Hepatotoxicity","Cirrhosis","Alcoholic_liver_disease","Necrosis","Primary_biliary_cirrhosis","Hepatic","Leptospirosis","Cholestasis","Oedema","Bilirubin","Bile","Gallstone","Common_bile_duct","Pancreatic_cancer","Pancreas","Liver_fluke","Biliary_atresia","Cholangiocarcinoma","Pancreatitis","Pancreatic_pseudocyst","Mirizzi's_syndrome","Bile_pigment","Splenomegaly","Infants","Premature_birth","Hereditary_spherocytosis","Glucose-6-phosphate_dehydrogenase_deficiency","Pyknocytosis","Kernicterus","Bili_light","Reticuloendothelial_system","Hemoglobin","Macrophages","Heme","Globin","Protein","Amino_acids","Oxidation","Erythropoiesis","Myoglobin","Cytochrome","Liver","Serum_albumin","Glucuronic_acid","Bile","Urobilinogen","Stercobilinogen","Oxidized","Stercobilin","Feces","Kidneys","Urine","Urobilin","Alkaline_phosphatase","Gamma_glutamyl_transpeptidase","Prothrombin_time","Aspartate_aminotransferase","Alanine_aminotransferase","Cholestasis","Endoscopic_retrograde_cholangiopancreatography"]}
