{"cursor":"3960","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Jacques MikaÃ«l Der MikaÃ«lian' better known as 'Jacques HÃ©lian' (born in Paris,\n7 June 1912 - died 29 June 1986), was a famous French orchestra conductor for\nFrench music-hall.\n\nBorn of an Armenian father (descendant of Armenian bourgeoisie) and a French\nmother, at 16 he entered school of dentistry, but left his studies to pursue\nhis love of music studying saxophone with Raymond Legrand, and married\nLegrand's sister Marcelle. He commenced his musical career playing saxo alto,\nsaxo baryton and clarinet in Roland Dorsay's orchestra and later in Jo Bouillon\norchestra and in Ray Ventura's orchestra. He also performed in French live\nradio broadcasts releasing a number of recordings before World War II. Called\nfor military service in 1939, he became a prisoner of war until his liberation\nin March 1943 for health reasons. After his release, he formed a small\norchestra and performed on radio.\n\nAfter liberation of France from Nazi occupation, Jacques HÃ©lian gained huge\npopularity, replacing Raymond Legrand's fame. His tune \"Fleur de Paris\" (with\nlyrics from Maurice Vandair, and music by Henri Bourtayre) became a virtual\n\"hymne of liberation\" for France. All music broadcasts would start and end with\n\"Fleur de Paris\".\n\nBetween 1945 et 1949, Jacques HÃ©lian recorded more than 70 songs for Columbia\nRecords, with \"C'est Si Bon\" gaining international fame. \"Place Pigalle\" was\nwritten by Alex Alstone and recorded by Maurice Chevalier in 1946 with HÃ©lian's\norchestra. He collaborated with composers like Henri Bourtayre (\"Chanteville\",\n\"La Marchina\", \"Soleil levant\") and Loulou GastÃ© (\"Le Porte-Bonheur\", \"Chica!\nChica!\", \"Au Chili\", \"Les Pompiers du Mexique\"). Jacques HÃ©lian's continued his\nhighly-followed radio performances, and organized galas and musical tours\nthroughout France with artists that gained big following after appearing with\nhis orchestra including Francine Claudel, Zappy Max, Jo Charrier, Ginette Garcin\nand others. En 1947, a singer, guitarist and composer known as Jean Marco1 (real\nname Jean Marcopoulos), quickly became the signature voice of HÃ©lian's orchestra\nuntil his tragic death in a road accident on 24 June 1953. Jean-Louis Tristan\nand Lou Darley succeeded Jean Marco and Claude Evelyne as lead singers.\n\nHÃ©lian's \"Ãtoile des neiges\" sung by \"The HÃ©lians\" female choir became one of\nhis biggest successes ever with a gold accreditation. In 1951, he received the\n[[Grand Prix du Disque]] from AcadÃ©mie Charles Cros for his song \"Tout est\ntranquille\".\n\nBetween 1949 and 1956, the best of French and European jazz artists paraded with\nhis orchestra including Christian Garros, GÃ©rard LÃ©vecque, AndrÃ© Paquinet,\nGeorge Cloud, Fernand Verstraete, Marcel Bianchi, Pierre Gossez, Janot Morales,\nSadi, and from the other side of the Atlantic, jazzmen like Ernie Royal, Al\nMone, Bill Tamper, Don Byas, Kenny Clarke and Sonny Grey, making his band one of\nthe msot known names of \"big band\" in Europe. His music was used in a number of\nfilms like CÅur de coq (1946), Pigalle-Saint-Germain-des-PrÃ©s (1950), Musique en\ntÃªte (1951) and Tambour battant (1952). The permanent orchestra's grande finale\nwas on 15 March 1957.\n\nHe made various appearances until the beginning of the 1980s, but with much\nlesser following. His works are considered references for the best of \"big\nband\" orchestras in French music-hall. He died in Paris on 29 June 1986 at the\nage of 74. His works were featured as \"Les AnnÃ©es Jacques HÃ©lian\" in the film\nVive la vie.\n","linknr":92,"url":"Jacques_Hélian","recorded":1375070513,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Jacques_H%C3%A9lian&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Jacques_H%C3%A9lian&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Biographies_of_living_persons","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability","/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources","/wiki/Defamation","/wiki/Ray_Ventura","/wiki/World_War_II","/wiki/C%27est_Si_Bon","/wiki/Maurice_Chevalier","/wiki/Loulou_Gast%C3%A9","/wiki/Ginette_Garcin","/wiki/Grand_Prix_du_Disque","/wiki/Acad%C3%A9mie_Charles_Cros","/w/index.php?title=Jacques_H%C3%A9lian&action=edit&section=1","http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0405717/","/wiki/Internet_Movie_Database","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jacques_Hélian&oldid=565424912","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:French_composers","/wiki/Category:1912_births","/wiki/Category:1986_deaths","/wiki/Category:People_from_Paris","/wiki/Category:BLP_articles_lacking_sources_from_July_2013","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Jacques+H%C3%A9lian&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Jacques+H%C3%A9lian","/wiki/Jacques_H%C3%A9lian","/w/index.php?title=Talk:Jacques_H%C3%A9lian&action=edit&redlink=1","#","/wiki/Jacques_H%C3%A9lian","/w/index.php?title=Jacques_H%C3%A9lian&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Jacques_H%C3%A9lian&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Jacques_H%C3%A9lian","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Jacques_H%C3%A9lian","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Jacques_H%C3%A9lian&oldid=565424912","/w/index.php?title=Jacques_H%C3%A9lian&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3159138","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Jacques_H%C3%A9lian&id=565424912","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Jacques+H%C3%A9lian","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Jacques+H%C3%A9lian&oldid=565424912&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Jacques_H%C3%A9lian&printable=yes","//fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_H%C3%A9lian","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3159138#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_H%C3%A9lian","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["French
