His musical career began as the\nfalsettist lead singer, and rhythm guitarist of The Rockin' Berries in 1961, who\nscored a number of hits in the UK and Europe. The group was best known for its\ncovers, and Turton did much of the searching and decision work as to what was to\nbe sung. [ Jefferson] at Allmusic.com\n\nWhen the group broke up in 1968, Turton started a solo career, releasing a\nsingle, \"Don't You Believe It\", on Piccadilly Records. It flopped, and\nPiccadilly head John Schroeder suggested that Turton change his name to\nJefferson. The single \"Montage\" failed to chart, but its follow-up, \"Colour of\nMy Love\", was a hit in the UK (peaking at #22 in the UK Singles Chart), {{cite book\n| first= David last= Roberts year= 2006 title= British Hit Singles & Albums\n| edition= 19th publisher= Guinness World Records Limited location= London isbn=\n| 1-904994-10-5 page= 281}} and US (reaching #68 on the Billboard Hot\n| 100), [ Charts], Allmusic and an LP was issued following its\n| success. A third single, \"Baby Take Me in Your Arms\", was not a hit in the UK,\n| but cracked the Top 40 in America, peaking at #23 and justifying the release\n| of a stateside album. At the time of this single's success, Turton was hurt in\n| a car crash, and so he did not make any live appearances. After a six month\n| hospital stay, Turton had a second record which was never released by his\n| label and a career on hiatus in the UK. He began touring the US, where he was\n| still able to get gigs based on the success of \"Baby Take Me in Your Arms\". He\n| then secured a recording contract with Polygram Records, who released another\n| album and a single, \"I Love You This Much\" (later a hit in Europe for Mouth &\n| MacNeal).\n\nHe resumed under his given name when The Rockin' Berries reunited in the late\n1970s, and toured with them (as well as doing solo shows in the UK) into the\n1990s. In 2001, Castle Records released The Colour of My Love, a CD composed of\nmuch of his previously unreleased material.\n","linknr":140,"url":"Jefferson_(singer)","recorded":1375054411,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Geoff_Turton&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Geoff_Turton&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","/wiki/Geoff_Turton","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","/w/index.php?title=Jefferson_(singer)&redirect=no","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Birmingham","/wiki/Record_label","/wiki/The_Rockin%27_Berries","/wiki/Birmingham","/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction","/wiki/United_Kingdom","/wiki/Singing","/wiki/Falsetto","/wiki/Rhythm_guitar","/wiki/The_Rockin%27_Berries","/wiki/Hit_record","/wiki/United_Kingdom","/wiki/Europe","/wiki/Musical_ensemble","/wiki/Cover_version","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Solo_(music)","/wiki/Single_(music)","/wiki/Piccadilly_Records","/wiki/Record_chart","/wiki/UK_Singles_Chart","#cite_note-British_Hit_Singles_.26_Albums-2","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/Billboard_Hot_100","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Album","/wiki/Top_40","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/Stateside","/wiki/Gramophone_record","/wiki/Record_label","/wiki/Concert","/wiki/Recording_contract","/wiki/Polygram_Records","/wiki/Mouth_%26_MacNeal","/wiki/Castle_Records","/wiki/Compact_disc","/w/index.php?title=Geoff_Turton&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/List_of_1970s_one-hit_wonders_in_the_United_States","/w/index.php?title=Geoff_Turton&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-1","http://www.allmusic.com/artist/p657389","#cite_ref-British_Hit_Singles_.26_Albums_2-0","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Special:BookSources/1-904994-10-5","#cite_ref-3","http://www.allmusic.com/artist/p13322","/wiki/Allmusic","/wiki/Joel_Whitburn","http://www.allmusic.com/artist/p657389","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/96849705","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","/wiki/File:MusicalnotesUK.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/MusicalnotesUK.svg/40px-MusicalnotesUK.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Geoff_Turton&action=edit","/wiki/Template:UK-singer-stub","/w/index.php?title=Template_talk:UK-singer-stub&action=edit&redlink=1","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:UK-singer-stub&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Geoff_Turton&oldid=546957511","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1944_births","/wiki/Category:Living_people","/wiki/Category:English_male_singers","/wiki/Category:English_guitarists","/wiki/Category:English_pop_singers","/wiki/Category:English_rock_singers","/wiki/Category:People_from_Birmingham,_West_Midlands","/wiki/Category:British_singer_stubs","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_hCards","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Geoff+Turton&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Geoff+Turton","/wiki/Geoff_Turton","/wiki/Talk:Geoff_Turton","#","/wiki/Geoff_Turton","/w/index.php?title=Geoff_Turton&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Geoff_Turton&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Geoff_Turton","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Geoff_Turton","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Geoff_Turton&oldid=546957511","/w/index.php?title=Geoff_Turton&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5534349","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Geoff_Turton&id=546957511","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Geoff+Turton","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Geoff+Turton&oldid=546957511&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Geoff_Turton&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5534349#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipe
