{"cursor":"2747","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'John Cooper' (c. 1570 â€“ 1626), also known as 'Giovanni Coprario' or\n'Coperario', was an English composer, viol player and lutenist.\n\nHe changed his name in the early 17th century. It is often said he did this\nafter a visit to Italy, though there is no evidence he had been to the country.\nFrom 1622 he served and may have taught the Prince of Wales, for whom he\ncontinued to work upon his succession as Charles I. His long time patron was\nEdward Seymour, Earl of Hertford, for whom he taught William Lawes.\n\nAmong Cooper's works are fantasias, suites and other works for viols and\nviolins, and two collections of songs, Funeral Teares (1606) and Songs of\nMourning: Bewailing the Untimely Death of Prince Henry (1613). He also penned\nthe treatise on composition, Rules how to Compose.\n\nAccording to Ernst Meyer, Cooper was a Londoner who italianized his\nname as Italian music and musicians became more fashionable, and spent much of\nhis life as a musician in the royal court.\n\nNinety-six fantasias in between three and six voices, most of them in two Oxford\nand Royal College of Music collections, were known to exist by Cooper (as of\n1946). Meyer also notes that most of Cooper's five and six part fantasias are\nmainly transcriptions, or imitations, of his madrigals, but that his fantasias\nfor three or four instrumental parts are, formally especially, independently\ninteresting.\n","linknr":119,"url":"John_Coprario","recorded":1375059330,"links":["/w/index.php?title=John_Cooper_(composer)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=John_Cooper_(composer)&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","/wiki/John_Cooper_(composer)","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","/w/index.php?title=John_Coprario&redirect=no","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/England","/wiki/Composer","/wiki/Viol","/wiki/Lute","/wiki/Italy","/wiki/Prince_of_Wales","/wiki/Charles_I_of_England","/wiki/Patronage","/wiki/Edward_Seymour,_1st_Earl_of_Hertford","/wiki/William_Lawes","/wiki/Fantasia_(music)","/wiki/Suite_(music)","/wiki/Viol","/wiki/Violin","/wiki/Song","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Madrigal_(music)","/w/index.php?title=John_Cooper_(composer)&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0-306-70037-9","/w/index.php?title=John_Cooper_(composer)&action=edit&section=2","http://imslp.org/wiki/Category:Coperario,_John","/wiki/International_Music_Score_Library_Project","/wiki/Authority_control","http://www.worldcat.org/identities/lccn-n81-134938","/wiki/Library_of_Congress_Control_Number","http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n81134938","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Cooper_(composer)&oldid=550301201","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1570_births","/wiki/Category:1626_deaths","/wiki/Category:English_composers","/wiki/Category:Baroque_composers","/wiki/Category:People_of_the_Tudor_period","/wiki/Category:Renaissance_composers","/wiki/Category:English_viol_players","/wiki/Category:16th-century_English_people","/wiki/Category:17th-century_English_people","/wiki/Category:16th-century_musicians","/wiki/Category:17th-century_musicians","/wiki/Category:English_music_theorists","/wiki/Category:16th-century_composers","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_LCCN_identifiers","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=John+Cooper+%28composer%29&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=John+Cooper+%28composer%29","/wiki/John_Cooper_(composer)","/wiki/Talk:John_Cooper_(composer)","#","/wiki/John_Cooper_(composer)","/w/index.php?title=John_Cooper_(composer)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=John_Cooper_(composer)&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/John_Cooper_(composer)","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/John_Cooper_(composer)","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=John_Cooper_(composer)&oldid=550301201","/w/index.php?title=John_Cooper_(composer)&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q676541","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=John_Cooper_%28composer%29&id=550301201","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=John+Cooper+%28composer%29","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=John+Cooper+%28composer%29&oldid=550301201&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=John_Cooper_(composer)&printable=yes","//de.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cooper_(Komponist)","//fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coperario","//it.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cooper","//nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Coprario","//ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%82%B8%E3%83%A7%E3%83%B3%E3%83%BB%E3%82%B3%E3%83%97%E3%83%A9%E3%83%AA%E3%82%AA","//nn.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cooper","//fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cooper_(s%C3%A4velt%C3%A4j%C3%A4)","//sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cooper_(komposit%C3%B6r)","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q676541#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediaf
