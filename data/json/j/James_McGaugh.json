He is currently a Research\nProfessor at the University of California, Irvine.\n\nMcGaugh received his B.A. from San Jose State University in 1953 and his Ph.D.\nin psychology from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1959. He was\nbriefly a professor at San Jose State and then did postdoctoral work in\nneuropharmacology with Nobel Laureate Professor Daniel Bovet at the Istituto\nSuperiore di SanitÃ¡ in Rome, Italy. He then became a professor at the\nUniversity of Oregon from 1961-1964. He was recruited to the University of\nCalifornia, Irvine, in 1964 (the year of the school's founding) to be the\nfounding chair of the Department of Psychobiology (now Neurobiology and\nBehavior: [http://neurobiology.uci.edu/]). He became dean (1967â1970) of the\nSchool of Biological Sciences and Vice Chancellor (1975â1977) and executive\nVice Chancellor (1978â1982) of the university, though he maintained his\nlaboratory throughout that time. In 1983, he founded the Center for the\nNeurobiology of Learning and Memory ([http://www.cnlm.uci.edu/] and remained\ndirector from 1983-2004.\n\nMcGaugh's early work (in the 1950s and 1960s) demonstrated that memories are not\ninstantly created in a long-term, permanent fashion. Rather, immediately after a\nlearning event, the memory is labile and susceptible to influence. As time\npasses, the memory becomes increasingly resistant to external influences and\neventually becomes stored in a relatively permanent manner, a process termed\nmemory consolidation. Dr. McGaugh found that drugs, given to an animal after a\nlearning event, influence the subsequent retention of that event. The concept of\nsuch \"post-training\" manipulations is one of Dr. McGaugh's greatest\ncontributions to the field of learning and memory because it avoids many\npotential confounds, such as performance effects of the drug, that may occur\nwhen a drug or other treatment is given prior to the training.\n\nOver the ensuing decades, Dr. McGaugh extended his findings into a long-term\ninvestigation of emotionally-influenced memory consolidation. As most people\nrealize, they have stronger memories for long-ago events that were emotionally\narousing in nature, compared with memories for emotionally neutral events (which\nmay not be remembered well at all). Dr. McGaugh has examined how emotional\narousal influences memory consolidation. In particular, he has found that stress\nhormones, such as epinephrine and cortisol, mediate much of the effects of\nemotional arousal on subsequent retention of the event. These hormones, in turn,\nactivate a variety of brain structures, including the amygdala, which appears to\nplay a key role in modulating memory consolidation. The amygdala, when\nactivated, influences a variety of other brain structures, including the\nhippocampus, nucleus accumbens and caudate nucleus that process different\naspects of memory. It is through this \"orchestration\" of brain structures that\nmemories are eventually formed and stored, though the exact nature of memory\nstorage remains elusive.\n\nMcGaugh has been recognized in honor of his achievements, accomplishments, and\ncontributions to the field of learning and memory. In 1981 he was honored with\nthe Distinguished Scientific Contribution Award from the American Psychological\nAssociation. He received a Merit Award from the National Institute of Mental\nHealth in 1987. McGaugh was elected a member of the U.S. National Academy of\nSciences in 1989 and was also elected a member of the Brazilian and Mexican\nacademies of science. He was elected a fellow of the American Academy of Arts\nand Sciences and has served as president of the Association for Psychological\nScience and the Western Psychological Association. He was selected as a William\nJames Fellow, Association for Psychological Science, 1989. Other honors include\nthe John P. McGovern Award from the American Association for the Advancement of\nScience, 1996 and the Robert S. Dow Neuroscience Award, 2000. The University of\nCalifornia, Irvine, honored him with the UCI medal in 1992 and the naming of a\nbuilding after him, McGaugh Hall, in 2001. The University of L'Aquila, Italy,\nhonored him with the Laurea Honoris Causa in 2001. In 2006 the Western\nPsychological Association awarded him Lifetime Achievement Award. He received\nthe Norman Anderson Lifetime Achievement Award from the Society of Experimental\nPsychologists in 2008 where he was elected a Fellow in 1991. He was also honored\nin 2009 with the Karl Lashley Prize in Neuroscience from the American\nPhilosophical Society. McGaugh can be found playing in a jazz ensemble once a\nmonth at the UC Irvine campus
