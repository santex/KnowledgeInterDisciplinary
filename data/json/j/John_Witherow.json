Dominic Ponsford [http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/john-witherow-made-acting-editor-times-after-\nindependent-directors-show-their-teeth \"John Witherow made 'acting' editor of\nTimes after independent directors show their teeth\",] Press Gazette, 18 January\n2013 Previously he had been editor of [[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday\nTimes]] since 1994.\n\nHe migrated to Britain in the late 1950s and later attended Bedford School and\nthe University of York.\n\nIn 1971, he went to Namibia as a volunteer teacher to teach at St Mary's\nAnglican School in Ovamboland, but on being refused a permit to enter Ovamboland\nby the South African government he was asked by Bishop Colin Winter to remain in\nWindhoek to help establish a diocesan library and study centre for\ncorrespondence students.\n\nHe was sent by Reuters to the Cardiff School of Journalism, where he gained a\ndistinction. He worked in Madrid and London for Reuters before joining The Times\nas a reporter. He covered the Falklands War in 1982. John Witherow sailed on the\nHMS Invincible with the British troops involved in the Falklands War. While on\nHMS Invicible, working as a Times journalist at the time, he said, \"...the\natmosphere was quite extraordinary, there were hundreds of thousands of people\nlining the quay, waving and within the ship there was a curious mood of\nebullience and aggression\".\n\nLater he covered the Iran-Iraq war, before moving to The Sunday Times. There he\nserved in several positions, including Defence Editor, Diplomatic Editor,\nForeign Editor and managing Editor of News. Witherow was made acting editor\nafter the departure of Andrew Neil in 1994 and confirmed in the job the\nfollowing year.
