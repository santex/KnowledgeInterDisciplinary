{"cursor":"99420","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n(1794) McLachlan (1983), 28â30. |alt=Quarter-length portrait of a man\nin a black coat against a purple and blue curtain backdrop.]]\n\n'Joseph Priestley', FRS (13 March 1733 (O.S.) â 6 February 1804)\nwas an 18th-century English theologian, Dissenting clergyman, natural\nphilosopher, chemist, educator, and political theorist who published over 150\nworks. He is usually credited with the discovery of oxygen, having isolated it\nin its gaseous state, although Carl Wilhelm Scheele and Antoine Lavoisier also\nhave a claim to the discovery. Kuhn, 53â60; Schofield (2004), 112â13. The\ndifficulty in precisely defining the time and place of the \"discovery\" of\noxygen, within the context of the developing chemical revolution, is one of\nThomas Kuhn's central illustrations of the gradual nature of paradigm shifts in\n[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]].\n\nDuring his lifetime, Priestley's considerable scientific reputation rested on\nhis invention of soda water, his writings on electricity, and his discovery of\nseveral \"airs\" (gases), the most famous being what Priestley dubbed\n\"dephlogisticated air\" (oxygen). However, Priestley's determination to defend\nphlogiston theory and to reject what would become the chemical revolution\neventually left him isolated within the scientific community.\n\nPriestley's science was integral to his theology, and he consistently tried to\nfuse Enlightenment rationalism with Christian theism. Tapper, 10. In\nhis metaphysical texts, Priestley attempted to combine theism, materialism, and\ndeterminism, a project that has been called \"audacious and original\". He believed that a proper understanding of the natural world would\npromote human progress and eventually bring about the Christian Millennium. Tapper, 314. Priestley, who strongly believed in the free and\nopen exchange of ideas, advocated toleration and equal rights for religious\nDissenters, which also led him to help found Unitarianism in England. The\ncontroversial nature of Priestley's publications combined with his outspoken\nsupport of the French Revolution aroused public and governmental suspicion; he\nwas eventually forced to flee, in 1791, first to London, and then to the United\nStates, after a mob burned down his home and church. He spent the last ten years\nof his life living in Northumberland County, Pennsylvania.\n\nA scholar and teacher throughout his life, Priestley also made significant\ncontributions to pedagogy, including the publication of a seminal work on\nEnglish grammar, books on history, and he prepared some of the most influential\nearly timelines. These educational writings were some of Priestley's most\npopular works. It was his metaphysical works, however, that had the most lasting\ninfluence: leading philosophers including Jeremy Bentham, John Stuart Mill, and\nHerbert Spencer credit them among the primary sources for utilitarianism.\n","linknr":1246,"url":"Joseph_Priestley","recorded":1362485567,"links":100,"instances":["industrialist","philosophy_of_mind","philosopher","publisher","scientist","textiles","history","parish","british_coin","spirit","religion","chemist","ecclesiastical"],"pdf":["http://reporter.leeds.ac.uk/press_releases/current/assets/sainsbury1.pdf"],"categories":["1733
