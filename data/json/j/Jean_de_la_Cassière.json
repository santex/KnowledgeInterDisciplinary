He commissioned the\nbuilding of the Conventual Church of the Order (St John's Co-Cathedral) in\nValletta, Malta, and is buried in the Crypt of St. John.\n\nLa Cassiere had earned acclaim for his bravery in the battle of Zoara in\nNorthern Africa where he had saved the colors of the Order. He was Grand Prior\nof the Orderâs Langue dâAuvergne when he was elected on 30 January 1572 to\nsucceed Pierre de Monte as Grandmaster.\n\nThe early years of his reign as Grand Master were marked by numerous disputes\nand quarrels between the Order and the Bishop of Malta over the ecclesiastical\njurisdiction of the bishop. These disputes were unprecedented in the history of\nthe Order since it had arrived in Malta in 1530 with a grant of virtual\nsovereignty from Emperor Charles V. La Cassiere was unable to resolve the\nmatter, which finally was submitted to Pope Gregory XIII who in turn appointed a\nGrand Inquisitor, a step that caused enormous resentment within the Order.\n\nA second major conflict arose in 1575 with the Republic of Venice, when Maltese\ngalleys seized a Venetian ship that carried goods for Jewish owners. Venice was\noutraged, and the Order soon faced the threat of having all of its property on\nVenetian territory confiscated. Again it required the intervention of the Pope,\nas well as the payment by La Cassiere of complete compensation, to resolve the\ndispute. And again, there was much discontent among the knights over this\nperceived rebuke to their assumed right to confiscate any property of non-\nChristians.\n\nThe third and most serious cause of discord within the Order during La\nCassiereâs rule was triggered by King Philip II of Spain who managed to arrange\nthe appointment of one of his close relatives, 17-year old Archduke Wenzel\n(Wenceslaus) of Austria (son of Emperor Maximilan II, Philipâs cousin), to the\nGrand Priory of Castile and Leon and the Bailiwick of Lora. Outraged by the\nkingâs interference, the Castilian knights of the Order openly rebelled against\nthis appointment. In response, the Pope ordered them to apologize publicly\nbefore the Grand Master and the General Convent for this insubordination.\n\nThese events further fuelled resentment within the Order and the General Convent\nagainst La Cassiere, who was widely perceived to be the cause of these problems\nand humiliations. It eventually broke into virtual mutiny in 1581, when the\nConvent deposed La Cassiere and placed him in confinement in Fort St. Angelo.\nThis meant that Mathurin Romegas, former Grand Prior of Toulouse and the Orderâs\nmost celebrated naval hero, who had been elected Lieutenant to the Grand Master\nin 1577, was now the de facto Grand Master.\n\nThe Pope immediately sent a special envoy, Gaspare Visconti, to investigate and,\nsimultaneously, to administer the Order until the dispute could be settled. La\nCassiere and Romegas were both summoned to Rome to explain their conduct and\nplead their case. La Cassiere arrived in Rome on 26 October 1581 and, on orders\nof Pope Gregory XIII, was treated with much deference and ceremony. By contrast,\nRomegas was treated with extreme coldness and much disdain. He died, alone and\nwith broken spirit, within a week, on 4 November 1581. La Cassiere was honorably\nacquitted of all charges against him and restored to the position of Grand\nMaster. He did not live long enough, however, to enjoy his triumph, dying in\nRome on 21 December 1581 at the age of seventy-eight. His body was transferred\nto Malta and buried in St. John's Co-Cathedral in Valletta.\n\n\n{{Succession box | before=Pierre de Monte | title=Grand Master of the Knights\nHospitaller | years=1572–1581
