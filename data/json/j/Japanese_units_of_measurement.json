{"cursor":"21578","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'{{nihongo|Shakkan-hÅ|å°ºè²«æ³|}}' is the traditional Japanese system of measurement.\nThe name shakkanhÅ originates from the name of two of the units, the [[Shaku\n(unit)|shaku]], a unit of length, and the kan, a mass measurement.\n\nThe system is Chinese in origin. The units originated in the Shang Dynasty in\nthe 13th century BC, and eventually stabilized in the Zhou Dynasty in the 10th\ncentury BC and spread from there to Japan, South East Asia, and Korea. The units\nof the Tang Dynasty were officially adopted in Japan in 701, and the current\nshaku measurement has hardly altered since then. Many Taiwanese units of\nmeasurement are derived form the shakkanhÅ system.\n\nFrom 1924, the shakkanhÅ system was replaced by the metric system,\nand use of the old units for official purposes was forbidden after 31 March\n1966. However, in several instances the old system is still used. In\ncarpentry and agriculture use of the old-fashioned terms is common. Tools such\nas Japanese chisels, spatels, saws, hammers are manufactured in sizes of sun and\nbu. Land is sold on the basis of price in tsubo. The 2005 Japanese census freed\npeople to give the area of their houses in either square metres or tsubo.\n\nThere are several different versions of the shakkanhÅ. The tables below show the\none in common use in the Edo period. In 1891 the most common units were given\ndefinitions in terms of the metric system:\n\n{| class=wikitable\n|+ 1891 definitions\n!colspan=\"2\"|Unit !rowspan=\"2\"|Definition !rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"4\"|Conversions\n|-\n!Romanized !Kanji\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Length !metres !metres !inches !feet !yards\n|- style=\"text-align: right\"\n|align=\"center\"| jÅ |align=\"center\"| ä¸ |align=\"center\" height=\"30pt\"|\n|   3.03\n| 119.3\n|   9.942\n|   3.314\n|- style=\"text-align: right\"\n|align=\"center\"| kanejaku |align=\"center\"|æ²å°º |align=\"center\" height=\"30pt\"|\n| .303\n|  11.93 .9942 .3314\n\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Volume !litres !litres !millilitres !US fluid ounces\n!Imperial fluid ounces\n|- style=\"text-align: right\"\n|align=\"center\"| shÅ |align=\"center\"| å |align=\"center\" height=\"30pt\"|\n|   1.804 1804\n|  61.00\n|  63.49 -\n!colspan=\"2\"|Mass !grams !grams !drams !ounces !pounds\n|- style=\"text-align: right\"\n|align=\"center\"| momme |align=\"center\"| å |align=\"center\" height=\"30pt\"|\n|   3.75\n|   2.116 .1323 .008267 - colspan=\"13\" bgcolor=#F0F0F0|'Note:' Definitions are\n|     exact and conversions are rounded to four significant figures. }\n","linknr":322,"url":"Japanese_units_of_measurement","recorded":1362891013,"links":25,"instances":["length","mass","electronics","unit"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Obsolete units of measurement","Systems of units","Japanese vocabulary|Units","Science and technology during the Edo period","Science and technology in Japan|Units","Customary units of measurement"],"headings":["Length","Area","Volume","Mass","Money","Other units","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ce/1_Go.jpg/220px-1_Go.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf8/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["foot","length"],["dram","unit"],["pound","mass"],["dram","unit"],["pound","mass"],["wafer","electronics"],["foot","length"]],"members":["foot","pound","wafer","dram"],"related":["Japan","Systems_of_measurement","Units_of_measurement","Length","Mass","Chinese_units_of_measurement","Shang_Dynasty","Zhou_Dynasty","South_East_Asia","Korea","Tang_Dynasty","Taiwanese_units_of_measurement","Metric_system","Japanese_carpentry","Japanese_agriculture","Japanese_chisel","Edo_period","Metric_system","Hepburn_romanization","Kanji","Metre","Inch","Foot_(length)","Yard","Litre","United_States_customary_units","Fluid_ounce","Imperial_unit","Gram","Dram_(unit)","Ounce","Pound_(mass)","Japanese_carpentry","Baleen","Tatami","Japanese_proverbs","Shosoin","Nara,_Nara","Imperial_unit","United_States_customary_units","Millimetre","Tokyo","Meiji_period","Kilometre","Mile","Tatami","Aspect_ratio","Square_metre","Square_inch","Square_foot","Square_yard","Hectare","Acre","Sake","Millilitre","Pint","Gallon","Sake","Pearl","Avoirdupois","Milligram","Gram","Kilogram","Dram_(unit)","Ounce","Pound_(mass)","Japanese_proverbs","Units_of_measurement","Tire","Bicycle","Semiconductor_device","Wafer_(electronics)","Foot_(length)","Magnetic_tape","History_of_measurement","Metrication","Japanese_clock","Japanese_counter_word","Japanese_numerals","Units_of_measurement","Chinese_units_of_measurement","Taiwanese_units_of_measurement","Hong_Kong_units_of_measurement"]}
