It covers civil measures of protection concerning\nchildren, ranging from orders concerning parental responsibility and contact to\npublic measures of protection or care, and from matters of representation to the\nprotection of childrenâs property. It is therefore much broader in scope than\ntwo earlier conventions of the HCCH on the subject.\n\nThe Convention has uniform rules determining which countryâs authorities are\ncompetent to take the measures of protection. The Convention determines which\ncountryâs laws are to be applied, and it provides for the recognition and\nenforcement of measures taken in one Contracting State in all other Contracting\nStates. The co-operation provisions of the Convention provide the basic\nframework for the exchange of information and for the necessary degree of\ncollaboration between administrative authorities in the Contracting States.\n\nThe convention is in force since 1 January 2002 and has 39 Contracting States\n(as of 1 May 2013). For one non-member state of the organisation, Lesotho, the\nconvention has not entered into force (1 June 2013). In addition,\nBelgium, Italy and the United States signed the convention, but did not ratify.\n","linknr":157,"url":"Jurisdiction,_Applicable_Law,_Recognition,_Enforcement_and_Co-operation_in_respect_of_Parental_Responsibility_and_Measures_for_the_Protection_of_Children","recorded":1375071939,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Hague_Convention_on_Parental_Responsibility_and_Protection_of_Children&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Hague_Convention_on_Parental_Responsibility_and_Protection_of_Children&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","/wiki/Hague_Convention_on_Parental_Responsibility_and_Protection_of_Children","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","/w/index.php?title=Jurisdiction,_Applicable_Law,_Recognition,_Enforcement_and_Co-operation_in_respect_of_Parental_Responsibility_and_Measures_for_the_Protection_of_Children&redirect=no","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Hague_Convention_1996.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Hague_Convention_1996.svg/260px-Hague_Convention_1996.svg.png","/wiki/The_Hague","/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_(Netherlands)","/wiki/Hague_Conference_on_Private_International_Law","#cite_note-1","#Scope_and_application","#General_background","#The_Hague_Children.E2.80.99s_Conventions","#The_1996_Convention","#Implementation_in_the_European_Union","#External_links","#References","/w/index.php?title=Hague_Convention_on_Parental_Responsibility_and_Protection_of_Children&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Hague_Convention_on_Parental_Responsibility_and_Protection_of_Children&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=Hague_Convention_on_Parental_Responsibility_and_Protection_of_Children&action=edit&section=3","/w/index.php?title=Hague_Convention_on_Parental_Responsibility_and_Protection_of_Children&action=edit&section=4","/wiki/Unaccompanied_minor","/w/index.php?title=Hague_Convention_on_Parental_Responsibility_and_Protection_of_Children&action=edit&section=5","/wiki/Brussels_II","#cite_note-EUratificition-2","/wiki/Member_states_of_the_European_Union","#cite_note-3","#cite_note-EUratificition-2","/wiki/Disputed_status_of_Gibraltar","#cite_note-4","/w/index.php?title=Hague_Convention_on_Parental_Responsibility_and_Protection_of_Children&action=edit&section=6","http://hcch.e-vision.nl/index_en.php?act=conventions.text&cid=70","http://www.hcch.net/index_en.php?act=conventions.status&cid=70","http://www.lawjournalnewsletters.com/issues/ljn_nyfamily/9_4/news/149686-1.html","/w/index.php?title=Hague_Convention_on_Parental_Responsibility_and_Protection_of_Children&action=edit&section=7","#cite_ref-1","http://www.hcch.net/index_en.php?act=conventions.status&cid=70","/wiki/Hague","#cite_ref-EUratificition_2-0","#cite_ref-EUratificition_2-1","http://eur-lex.europa.eu/Notice.do?val=472155:cs&lang=en&list=472155:cs,&pos=1&page=1&nbl=1&pgs=10&hwords=&checktexte=checkbox&visu=#texte","/wiki/EUR-Lex","#cite_ref-3","http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/justice_freedom_security/judicial_cooperation_in_civil_matters/jl0046_en.htm","/wiki/EUR-Lex","#cite_ref-4","http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-01/09/content_7391857.htm","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hague_Convention_on_Parental_Responsibility_and_Protection_of_Children&oldid=562898024","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Treaties_concluded_in_1996","/wiki/Category:Treaties_entered_into_force_in_2002","/wiki/Category:Hague_Conference_on_Private_International_Law_conventions","/wiki/Category:Treaties_of_Albania","/wiki/Category:Treaties_of_Australia","/wiki/Category:Treaties_of_Austria","/wiki/Category:Treaties_of_Bulgaria","/wiki/Category:Treaties_of_Croatia","/wiki/Category:Treaties_of_Cyprus","/wiki/Category:Treaties_of_the_Czech_Republic","/wiki/Category:Treaties_of_Denmark","/wiki/Category:Treaties_of_Ecuador","/wiki/Category:Treaties_of_Estonia","/wiki/Category:Treaties_of_Finland","/wiki/Category:Treaties_of_France","/wiki/Category:Treaties_of_Germany","/wiki/Category:Treaties_of_Greece","/wiki/Category:Treaties_of_Hungary","/wiki/Category:Treaties_of_Ireland","/wiki/Category:Treaties_of_Latvia","/wiki/Category:Treaties_of_Lithuania","/wiki/Category:Treaties_of_Luxembourg","/wiki/Category:Treaties_of_Malta","/wiki/Category:Treaties_of_Monaco","/wiki/Category:Treaties_of_Montenegro","/wiki
