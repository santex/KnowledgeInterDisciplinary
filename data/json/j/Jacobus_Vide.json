{"cursor":"3178","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Jacobus Vide' (Jacques Vide) (fl. 1405–1433) was a Franco-Flemish\ncomposer of the transitional period between the medieval period and early\nRenaissance. He was an early member of the Burgundian School, during the reigns\nof John the Fearless and Philip the Good.\n\nThe earliest mention of him is from the archives of the Cathedral of Notre Dame\nin Paris, in 1405, where he was probably a choirboy (some uncertainty exists\nwith regard to the name). In 1410 he held a position at the church of St\nDonatian in Bruges, and around the same time he may have been a singer in the\nchapel of Antipope John XXIII. His service to the Burgundian court began\nsometime between then and 1423, when he was listed as a [[valet de chambre]] for\nPhilip the Good, and in 1426 he was given charge of instructing and caring for\ntwo choirboys. In 1428 he was promoted to the position of secretary to Philip\nthe Good. No records of his activity after 1433 have yet been discovered.\n\nAll eight of his surviving works are rondeaux, secular French songs which were a\nfavorite of the Burgundians. They are somewhat unusual, in comparison to other\nmusic of the period, in their free use of dissonance, and in addition are marked\nby frequent use of cross-rhythms. All of the characteristic cadences of the\nperiod — the Landini cadence, the Burgundian cadence, and the V-I cadence\nwhere the lowest voice jumps an octave to avoid parallel fifths — are\ncommon in Vide's music.\n\nOne of his more enigmatic songs is a three-voice rondeau, \"Las, j'ay perdu mon\nespincel\", in which the upper voices, the superius and the tenor, are fully\nwritten out, but the contratenor is left blank. Since the manuscript was\ncarefully prepared, it is probable that the missing part was deliberate, and was\na pun on the song text \"j'ay perdu mon\" (I lost my ...), in which case the\nsinger, likely trained to improvise as well as sing from score, would have had\nto fill in by himself on the spot.\n","linknr":106,"url":"Jacobus_Vide","recorded":1375077356,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Jacobus_Vide&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Jacobus_Vide&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Floruit","/wiki/Dutch_School_(music)","/wiki/Medieval_music","/wiki/Renaissance_music","/wiki/Burgundian_School","/wiki/John_the_Fearless","/wiki/Philip_the_Good","/wiki/Cathedral_of_Notre_Dame","/wiki/Paris","/wiki/Bruges","/wiki/Antipope_John_XXIII","/wiki/Duchy_of_Burgundy","/wiki/Valet_de_chambre","/wiki/Rondeau_(music)","/wiki/Consonance_and_dissonance","/wiki/Landini_cadence","/wiki/Burgundian_cadence","/w/index.php?title=Jacobus_Vide&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Gustave_Reese","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0393095304","http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/public/book/omo_gmo","/w/index.php?title=Jacobus_Vide&action=edit&section=2","http://imslp.org/wiki/Category:Vide,_Jacobus","/wiki/International_Music_Score_Library_Project","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jacobus_Vide&oldid=549567707","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Franco-Flemish_composers","/wiki/Category:Renaissance_composers","/wiki/Category:Medieval_composers","/wiki/Category:1430s_deaths","/wiki/Category:Burgundian_school_composers","/wiki/Category:Arts_in_the_court_of_Philip_the_Good","/wiki/Category:Pages_containing_links_to_subscription-only_content","/wiki/Category:Use_dmy_dates_from_October_2010","/wiki/Category:Year_of_birth_unknown","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Jacobus+Vide&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Jacobus+Vide","/wiki/Jacobus_Vide","/wiki/Talk:Jacobus_Vide","#","/wiki/Jacobus_Vide","/w/index.php?title=Jacobus_Vide&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Jacobus_Vide&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Jacobus_Vide","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Jacobus_Vide","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Jacobus_Vide&oldid=549567707","/w/index.php?title=Jacobus_Vide&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1345642","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Jacobus_Vide&id=549567707","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Jacobus+Vide","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Jacobus+Vide&oldid=549567707&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Jacobus_Vide&printable=yes","//de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobus_Vide","//eo.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobus_Vide","//it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobus_Vide","//nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobus_Vide","//fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobus_Vide","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1345642#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobus_Vide","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":["music","music"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Franco-Flemish
