{"cursor":"6126","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'John Adam' (5 March 1721 – 25 June 1792) was a Scottish architect. Born\nin Linktown of Abbotshall, now part of Kirkcaldy, Fife, he was the eldest son of\narchitect and entrepreneur William Adam. His younger brothers Robert and James\nAdam also became architects.\n\nThe Adam family moved to Edinburgh in 1728, as William Adam's career as a\ndesigner of country houses began to take off. John attended Dalkeith Grammar\nSchool, outside the city, although he did not proceed to university as he was\nalready being involved in the family businesses. However, the family home became\na hub of the Scottish Enlightenment, with numerous Edinburgh virtuosi visiting.\n\nDuring the 1740s, William was gradually handing over control to his eldest son.\nUpon William's death in June 1748, John took over the family businesses, which\nbesides designing and building houses, included interests in quarrying, mining\nand other industries. John also became Laird of Blair Adam, the estate in Kinross-\nshire which his father had built up. Finally, John inherited his father's\nposition as Master Mason to the Board of Ordnance in North Britain.\n\nJohn took his younger brother Robert into partnership, and the two profited\ngreatly from the lucrative Board of Ordnance contracts which were had been\ninitiated following the Jacobite Rising of 1745. These included the building of\nFort George near Inverness, to the designs of military engineer Colonel\nSkinner. Paul Latcham, âSkinner, William (1699/1700â1780)â, Oxford\nDictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Jan\n2008 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/25689, accessed 2 Feb 2013]\n\nThe brothers also continued to execute their late father's designs, including\nthe pavilions and interiors of Hopetoun House. Their first major new commission\ncame in 1754 from William Dalrymple, Earl of Dumfries. The new Dumfries House in\nAyrshire was probably mostly to the design of Robert Adam, the more talented\narchitect of the two. Robert oversaw the construction of the house until late\nsummer 1754, when he left on his Grand Tour to Italy. Even when abroad, Robert\ncontinued to send home designs. John concentrated on the business side of the\npractice, although he was a competent, if formulaic, architect.\n\nJohn did win a competition to design a new Royal Exchange in Edinburgh, but he\nwas not appointed as contractor. The successful contractor then appointed\nanother architect, who made changes to the design. However, the building, which\nnow serves as the City Chambers, is still often attributed to John Adam.\n\n\n\nOn Robert's return to Britain, he established himself in London, where he was\njoined by the younger brothers James and William. John continued to look\nafter the family's Scottish interests, investing in further quarrying\nventures, and the Carron Iron Works. He supplied his London-based brothers\nwith capital from the Blair Adam estate, at least until the collapse of a\nstock market venture by his friend Andrew Fairholme in 1764 left him out of\npocket. Further losses occurred after the failure of\nRobert's speculative Adelphi development in 1772, and John was forced to\nmortgage Blair Adam.\n\nJohn Adam designed other houses in Edinburgh, including Milton House in the Old\nTown, and Hawkhill, for Lord Alemoor. In the Annandale town of Moffat he\ndesigned Moffat House for the Earl of Hopetoun. Among his more\nsignificant work was Adam Square, a speculative development of three houses on\nhis own property in the city. The development, although not a true \"square\",\nrepresents one of the first terraces of townhouses in Edinburgh. Construction began in 1761, and despite the financial troubles,\nLord President Robert Dundas was able to move in in 1768.\nAdam himself also lived there until 1772, as well as having a villa at\nMerchiston. Adam Square was demolished in the 1870s, and the site is now\noccupied by Adam House, a building of the University of Edinburgh.\n\nUpon his death in 1792, he was succeeded as laird of Blair Adam by his only\nsurviving son, the politician and judge William Adam.\n","linknr":138,"url":"John_Adam_(architect)","recorded":1375084557,"links":["/w/index.php?title=John_Adam_(architect)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=John_Adam_(architect)&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Dumfries_House_-_frontage_-_geograph.org.uk_-_927584.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ec/Dumfries_House_-_frontage_-_geograph.org.uk_-_927584.jpg/220px-Dumfries_House_-_frontage_-_geograph.org.uk_-_927584.jpg","/wiki/File:Dumfries_House_-_frontage_-_geograph.org.uk_-_927584.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Scotland","/wiki/Architect","/wiki/Kirkcaldy","/wiki/Fife","/wiki/William_Adam_(architect)","/wiki/Robert_Adam","/wiki/James_Adam_(architect)","/wiki/Dalkeith","/wiki/Scottish_Enlightenment","/wiki/Laird","/wiki/Kinross-shire","/wiki/Board_of_Ordnance","/wiki/North_Britain","/wiki/Jacobite_Rising","/wiki/Fort_George,_Highland","/wiki/Inverness","/wiki/William_Skinner_(engineer)","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Hopetoun_House","/wiki/William_Dalrymple-Crichton,_5th_Earl_of_Dumfries,_4th_Earl_of_Stair","/wiki/Earl_of_Dumfries","/wiki/Dumfries_House","/wiki/Grand_Tour","/wiki/City_Chambers,_Edinburgh","/wiki/File:Moffat_House_Hotel.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/Moffat_House_Hotel.jpg/220px-Moffat_House_Hotel.jpg","/wiki/File:Moffat_House_Hotel.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Carron_Iron_Works","#cite_note-Mowat-2","/wiki/Adelphi,_London","/wiki/Old_Town,_Edinburgh","/wiki/Andrew_Pringle,_Lord_Alemoor","/wiki/Moffat","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Terraced_house","#cite_note-Mowat-2","/wiki/Lord_President_of_the_Court_of_Session","/wiki/Robert_Dundas,_of_Arniston,_the_younger","#cite_note-Mowat-2","/wiki/Merchiston","/wiki/University_of_Edinburgh","/wiki/William_Adam_(MP)","/w/index.php?title=John_Adam_(architect)&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/25689,","#cite_ref-Mowat_2-0","#cite_ref-Mowat_2-1","#cite_ref-Mowat_2-2","#cite_ref-3","http://data.historic-scotland.gov.uk/pls/htmldb/f?p=2200:15:0::::BUILDING,HL:37928,Moffat%20House","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0719500001","/w/index.php?title=John_Adam_(architect)&action=edit&section=2","http://freespace.virgin.net/andrew.jones39/robert%20adam.htm","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/62975960","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Adam_(architect)&oldid=559729050","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Scottish_architects","/wiki/Category:1721_births","/wiki/Category:1792_deaths","/wiki/Category:People_from_Kirkcaldy","/wiki/Category:Burials_at_Greyfriars_Kirkyard","/wiki/Category:People_of_the_Scottish_Enlightenment","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=John+Adam+%28architect%29&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=John+Adam+%28architect%29","/wiki/John_Adam_(architect)","/wiki/Talk:John_Adam_(architect)","#","/wiki/John_Adam_(architect)","/w/index.php?title=John_Adam_(architect)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=John_Adam_(architect)&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/John_Adam_(architect)","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/John_Adam_(architect)","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=John_Adam_(architect)&oldid=559729050","/w/index.php?title=John_Adam_(architect)&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6218149","/w/index.php?
