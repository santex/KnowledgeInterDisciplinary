Williams' (18 August 1933, Cleveland, Ohio â 22 February 2008, South\nHaven, Michigan) was a professor in the Department of English Language and\nLiterature at the University of Chicago.\n\nWilliams began as a researcher of English language. In Origins of the English\nLanguage: A Social & Linguistic History he traces the history of the English\nlanguage from the evolution of man through to Modern English. His interest in\nstudying close connection between grammar and rhetoric, reflected in another\nearlier book The New English: Structure, Form, Style, culminated in , his\nnoteworthy textbook on writing style.\n\nIn Style, based on \"The Little Red Schoolhouse\" course he taught at Chicago for\nmany years, Now, also English 13000/33000 ([http://writing-\nprogram.uchicago.edu/ Academic and Professional Writing]).  Williams\nestablished and vehemently defended two basic principles that âit is good to\nwrite clearly, and anyone can.â (Style: Lessons in Clarity and Grace (9th\nEdition) 4). To meet these ends Williams laid out streamlined steps to help\nwriters first make their sentences and paragraphs clear and then graceful. This\nincludes expressing actions in specific verbs to make sentences clear.\nParagraphs are cohesive, when sentences have a sense of flow, and coherent, when\nparagraphs are felt as the whole. Emphasis depends on how sentences end.\nGraceful sentences and paragraphs are concise, shapely (uninterrupted and\ncoordinated), and elegant (balanced in syntax, meaning, sound and rhythm). In\nlater editions, he discussed ethics of writing understood as a social act\nbetween writer and reader and offered steps to produce coherent documents.\n\nNoting the kinship between Style and The Elements of Style by William Strunk and\nE.B. White, some praised Williams for practicality of his advice\n[http://www.econ161.berkeley.edu/econ_articles/reviews/williams.html], while\nothers criticized him for his own wordiness which he strived to combat in\nwriting of others [http://www.amazon.com/Style-Lessons-Clarity-Grace-\n9th/dp/0321479351].\n\nThe Craft of Research, a collaborative textbook written by Williams and his two\nlong-term academic colleagues and friends â Wayne C. Booth and Gregory G.\nColomb, â was designed to help students plan, carry out and report on research\nin any field and at any level â from a term paper to a dissertation, an article,\nand a book. Authors understood writing a research report as âthinking in\nwritingâ and âthinking from the point of view of [the] readersâ (The Craft of\nResearch 15). Their treatment of research arguments included a refinement of\nStephen Toulminâs formal layout of arguments. In another book, The Craft of\nArgument, Williams and Colomb looked at written arguments in general. The\nauthors claimed that in argument âquestions and answers not only seek truth, but\nalso generate the means of persuasion that rhetoric seeksâ (The Craft of\nArgument xix).\n\nTogether with Gregory G. Colomb, Francis X. Kinahan, and Lawrence D. McEnerney,\nWilliams developed innovative instructional materials for advanced writers in\nthe academy and the professions known as The Little Red Schoolhouse [http://www-\n.me.gatech.edu/me/academics/little_red_schoolhouse/description.html], [http://writing-\nprogram.uchicago.edu/courses/grad.htm].\n\nFrom 1980, Williams (together with Colomb and others) ran Clearlines, a\nconsulting firm helping writers in corporations, law firms, and consulting\ngroups to write clearly and concisely.
