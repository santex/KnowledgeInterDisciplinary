{"cursor":"4691","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'John Weldon' (19 January 1676 â 7 May 1736) was an English composer.\n\nBorn at Chichester in the south of England, he was educated at Eton, where he\nwas a chorister, and later received musical instruction from Henry\nPurcell. Franklin Zimmerman, Henry Purcell 1659-1695, his Life and Times\n(New York 1967) By 1694 Weldon had been appointed organist of New College\nin Oxford and became well known in the musical life of that city, writing music\nfor masques as well as performing his organist duties.\n\nSome believe he set Shakespeare's play [[The Tempest]] to music in 1695,\nalthough others attribute that to Henry Purcell.\n\nWeldon moved to London and in 1701 took part in a competition to set Congreve's\nlibretto [[The Judgement of Paris (opera)|The Judgement of Paris]] to music.\nPerhaps surprisingly, Weldon's setting was chosen over contributions by his\nolder, more experienced and better-known competitors, Daniel Purcell (younger\nbrother of Henry), John Eccles and Godfrey Finger. Even more curiously,\nPurcell's and Eccles's scores were later published by John Walsh. Weldon's\nhowever was not and remains in manuscript, though the lack of recognition of his\nrelatively new name may also have played a part. In the Folger Library,\nWashington, D.C., Ms. Cs. 1479 There is some evidence to suggest that the\njudges of the competition were not entirely impartial, however it has also been\nsuggested that Weldon's setting was considered less old fashioned than his\nsomewhat older contemporaries. In the printed score of Eccles's The\nJudgement of Paris, published by Walsh (1702), the composer commented that there\nwere some [judges] 'who came prepar'd to Dislike it'. In the same year as\nthe competition, Weldon was made a Gentleman of the Chapel Royal.\n\nHaving established his reputation in London, Weldon continued for some years to\nwrite music for the theatre. Music for The Tempest, until the mid-1960s believed\nto have been composed by Henry Purcell, was in all probability written by Weldon\nfor the Drury Lane Theatre, in 1712. Margaret Laurie: 'Did Purcell set The\nTempest?', Proceedings of the Royal Musical Association, xc (1963â4), p.\n43â57 Weldon's musical style owes much to Purcell's influence but is more\nItalianate and also embraces the 'modern' French styles and forms that were\nbecoming increasingly popular at the time.\n\nJohn Weldon devoted the latter part of his life almost exclusively to the duties\nof the Chapel Royal and to writing church music. See\n[http://www.cpdl.org/wiki/index.php/In_Thee_O_Lord_%28John_Weldon%29 \"In Thee O\nLord\"] in the Choral Public Domain Library. He succeeded John Blow (1649-\n1708) as Chapel Royal organist, and in 1715 was made second composer under\nWilliam Croft (1678-1727). He wrote six anthems for the tenor Richard\nElford. From 1714, Weldon also held the post of organist at two\nLondon Churches, St Bride's, Fleet Street and St Martin-in-the-Fields. New\nOxford Companion to Music Vol. 2 He died on 7 May 1736 and is buried in\nSt. Paul's Church, Covent Garden, London.\n\nJohn Weldon's grandson Samuel Thomas Champnes would follow in his musical\nfootsteps and become one of Handel's soloists. Many of their descendants were\ninvolved in the church and took the Weldon surname as their second name, often\nwriting the music for hymns in the Ancient and Modern song book.\n","linknr":133,"url":"John_Weldon_(musician)","recorded":1375080807,"links":["/w/index.php?title=John_Weldon_(musician)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=John_Weldon_(musician)&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Chichester","/wiki/Henry_Purcell","#cite_note-1","/wiki/1694_in_music","/wiki/New_College,_Oxford","/wiki/The_Tempest","/wiki/Henry_Purcell","/wiki/William_Congreve_(playwright)","/wiki/The_Judgement_of_Paris_(opera)","/wiki/Daniel_Purcell","/wiki/John_Eccles_(composer)","#cite_note-2","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Chapel_Royal","#cite_note-4","/wiki/Chapel_Royal","#cite_note-5","/wiki/John_Blow","/wiki/1715_in_music","/wiki/William_Croft","/wiki/Richard_Elford","#cite_note-6","/wiki/1714_in_music","/wiki/St_Bride%27s_Church","/wiki/St_Martin-in-the-Fields","#cite_note-7","/wiki/Samuel_Thomas_Champnes","/w/index.php?title=John_Weldon_(musician)&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Organist","/wiki/St_Martin-in-the-Fields","/w/index.php?title=John_Weldon_(musician)&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-1","#cite_ref-2","#cite_ref-3","#cite_ref-4","#cite_ref-5","http://www.cpdl.org/wiki/index.php/In_Thee_O_Lord_%28John_Weldon%29","#cite_ref-6","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/12px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png","//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Weldon,_John_(DNB00)","/wiki/Dictionary_of_National_Biography","#cite_ref-7","/w/index.php?title=John_Weldon_(musician)&action=edit&section=3","http://www.cpdl.org/wiki/index.php/John_Weldon","/wiki/Choral_Public_Domain_Library","http://imslp.org/wiki/Category:Weldon,_John","/wiki/International_Music_Score_Library_Project","/wiki/Authority_control","http://www.worldcat.org/identities/lccn-n82-39431","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/37181562","/wiki/Library_of_Congress_Control_Number","http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n82039431","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Weldon_(musician)&oldid=544189010","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Baroque_composers","/wiki/Category:English_composers","/wiki/Category:Gentlemen_of_the_Chapel_Royal","/wiki/Category:People_from_Chichester","/wiki/Category:Organists_of_New_College,_Oxford","/wiki/Category:Opera_composers","/wiki/Category:1676_births","/wiki/Category:1736_deaths","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_LCCN_identifiers","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=John+Weldon+%28musician%29&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=John+Weldon+%28musician%29","/wiki/John_Weldon_(musician)","/wiki/Talk:John_Weldon_(musician)","#","/wiki/John_Weldon_(musician)","/w/index.php?title=John_Weldon_(musician)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=John_Weldon_(musician)&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/John_Weldon_(musician)","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/John_Weldon_(musician)","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=John_Weldon_(musician)&oldid=544189010","/w/index.php?title=John_Weldon_(musician)&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1702129","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=John_Weldon_%28musician%29&id=544189010","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=John+Weldon+%28musician%29","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=John+Weldon+%28musician%29&oldid=544189010&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=John_Weldon_(musician)&printable=yes","//de.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Weldon_(Komponist)","//pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Weldon_(compositor)","#","//www.wik
