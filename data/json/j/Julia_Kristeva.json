She is now a Professor at\nthe University Paris Diderot. Kristeva became influential in international\ncritical analysis, cultural theory and feminism after publishing her first book\nSemeiotikÃ¨ in 1969. Her sizable body of work includes books and essays which\naddress intertextuality, the semiotic, and abjection, in the fields of\nlinguistics, literary theory and criticism, psychoanalysis, biography and\nautobiography, political and cultural analysis, art and art history. Together\nwith Roland Barthes, Todorov, Goldmann, GÃ©rard Genette, LÃ©vi-Strauss, Lacan,\nGreimas, and Althusser, she stands as one of the foremost structuralists, in\nthat time when structuralism took a major place in humanities. Her works also\nhave an important place in post-structuralist thought.\n\nShe is also the founder and head of the Simone de Beauvoir Prize\ncommittee.
