Its powers are enshrined in the (as\namended) and the Commission reports to the Attorney General and Minister for\nJustice, presently Hon. Greg Smith SC MP.\n\nThe commission is the only body of its type in England. Similar bodies are in\nexistence in Canada, India and the United States. The\nwork of the commission is split into two distinct areas. The first is a conduct\ndivision which deals with complaints about judicial officers. The other area is\nthe educative function, which provides information on sentencing information,\nlegal development and ongoing training for judicial officers.\n\nThe commission marked a significant change in the legal system in New South\nWales. It restored public confidence in the judicial system, which had been\nrocked by a series of scandals and allegations of misconduct in the early 1980s.\nThe commission eliminated the political process from the removal of a judge from\npublic office. Judges were no longer subject to the whim of the government of\nthe day in whether they could be removed from office. Instead, the commission\nnow provides a means outside of politics for the dispassionate consideration of\nmisconduct by judicial officers. As one present judge has suggested, the\ncommission has actually improved and safe-guarded independence of the\ncourts. The model for a judicial commission has received support for\nintroduction elsewhere in Australia.
