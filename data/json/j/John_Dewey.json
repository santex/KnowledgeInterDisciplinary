Dewey was an important early developer of the\nphilosophy of pragmatism and one of the founders of functional psychology. He\nwas a major representative of progressive education and liberalism. Alan\nRyan, John Dewey and the High Tide of American Liberalism, (1995) p\n32\n\nAlthough Dewey is known best for his publications concerning education, he also\nwrote about many other topics, including experience, nature, art, logic,\ninquiry, democracy, and ethics.\n\nIn his advocacy of democracy, Dewey considered two fundamental\nelements—schools and civil society—as being major topics needing\nattention and reconstruction to encourage experimental intelligence and\nplurality. Dewey asserted that complete democracy was to be obtained not just by\nextending voting rights but also by ensuring that there exists a fully formed\npublic opinion, accomplished by effective communication among citizens, experts,\nand politicians, with the latter being accountable for the policies they adopt.\n","linknr":1230,"url":"John_Dewey","recorded":1362666195,"links":95,"instances":["personal_and_cultural","poet","philosophy"],"pdf":["http://www.siu.edu/~deweyctr/CHRONO.pdf","http://www.siu.edu/~deweyctr/CHRONO.pdf","http://www.erzwiss.uni-hamburg.de/sonstiges/dewey/DewExpNa.pdf","http://www.nasonline.org/publications/biographical-memoirs/memoir-pdfs/dewey-john.pdf"],"categories":["1859
