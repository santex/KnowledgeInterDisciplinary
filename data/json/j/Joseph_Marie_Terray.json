{"cursor":"8777","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":", 1774; the red calf-bound portfolio symbolic of his appointment stands on the\nwriting-table behind him.]]\n\n'Joseph Marie Terray' (December 9, 1715, BoÃ«n – February 18, 1778) was a\nController-General of Finances during the reign of Louis XV of France, an agent\nof fiscal reform, cut short by his death.\n\nTerray, tonsured but not a priest, was appointed in 1736 an ecclesiastical\ncounsellor in the Parlement of Paris, where he specialized in financial matters.\nIn 1764 he was made abbot [[in commendam]] of the rich abbey of Molesme. The\nsupport of his uncle, physician in ordinary to the duchess of OrlÃ©ans, mother of\nthe Regent, eventually rendered him rich, enabling him to set aside his former\ncircumspect style of life and openly seat his mistresses at his\ntable. Charles du Rozier, in Dictionnaire de la conversation et de la\nlecture inventaire, s.v. \"Terray (Joseph-Marie)\". His genuine capacity\nattracted the attention of Louis XV's chancellor, RenÃ© Nicolas Charles Augustin\nde Maupeou, who made him controller general in December 1769. His first big\nventure was helping Mme du Barry's partisans Choiseul, MÃ¨moires: \"Intrigue\nde l'abbÃ© Terray, de Madame du Barry et du duc d'Aiguillon pour me renvoyer du\nministÃ¨re\". to bring down the minister of foreign affairs, [[Ãtienne\nFranÃ§ois, duc de Choiseul]] the very next year by demonstrating that the\ngovernment could not afford to go to war with [[Great Britain]]. \"Intelligent,\nplain-speaking, hard-working and rich\", [[Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie]],The\nAncien RÃ©gime: a history of France, 1610-1774'' 1998:144. Terray spent the\nnext few years stabilizing the finances of the country by repudiating part of\nthe national debt, suspending payments on the interest on government bonds, and\nlevying forced loans. These reforms aroused mass protest among nobles and\ncommoners alike, which forced Maupeou to strip the Parlements of their political\npower in 1771, so that further reforms could be enacted.\n\nTerray continued his overhaul of the financial system by reforming the\ncollection of both the vingtiÃ¨me (a five percent tax on income) and the\ncapitation (head tax) of Paris and renegotiating more advantageous agreements\nwith the farmers general, the financiers who held the right to collect indirect\ntaxes. These measures were responsible for a large increase in government\nrevenue; however, he continued to face opposition, particularly over his\nrestriction of free trade of grain, . which opponents charged was part\nof a \"Pact of Famine\" with Louis XV designed to allow the king to profit from\nartificially high grain prices. When Louis XV died in May 1774, his successor\nLouis XVI bowed to pressure and dismissed both Terray and Maupeou. Napoleon\nBonaparte, \"Notes diverses tirÃ©es des mÃ©moires de l'abbÃ© Terray,\" Napoleon:\nManuscrits inÃ©dits, 1786-1791 publiÃ©s dâaprÃ¨s les originaux autographes par\nFrÃ©dÃ©ric Masson et Guido Biagi (Paris: SociÃ©tÃ© dâÃditions LittÃ©raires et\nArtistiques, 1910), 236-238.\n\nTerray's position enabled him to become a lavish patron of the arts. His\nrebuilding of his hÃ´tel in rue NÃ´tre-Dame-des-Champs, c. 1769â74, was the last\ncommission of Antoine-Mathieu Le Carpentier (1709â1773), who did not live to see\nits completion. Colin B. Bailey, Patriotic taste: collecting modern art in\npre-revolutionary Paris, 2002:267 The HÃ´tel Terray, \"notable for the good\narrangement of its rooms\", later housed the CollÃ¨ge Stanislas and was demolished\nin 1849, when the rue Stanislas was extended through its garden, Henri\nGourdon de Genouillac, Paris Ã  Travers les SiÃ¨cles, vol. 3:357; Jetta Sophia\nWolff , Historic Paris, 1921:315. leaving an isolated pavilion.

From the history painter Nicolas-Guy Brenet he commissioned two\nsubjects, equally referent to his official position; one, Cincinnatus Made\nDictator was a clear reference to the enlightened despotism under which he\noperated; the other made a less open reference to his reputation as a speculator\nin grain: The Roman Farmer, in which Caius Furius Cressinus was wrongly accused\nof sorcery on account of the abundance of his crops: it had been exhibited at\nthe Salon of 1775. Conisbee 2005; for Terray's reputation as a corrupt\nspeculator, see Rozier, in Dictionnaire. Not all subjects of his\ncommissions were so severe: from Jean-Jacques CaffiÃ©ri he commissioned a pair of\ntable bronzes in 1777, on [[galante]] subjects: Cupid Vanquishing Pan (Wallace\nCollection, London) and Friendship Surprised by Love (Toledo Museum of Art). A\nsmall marble Bartholomew by Pierre Le Gros the Younger was purchased from the\nestate of the painter Jean-FranÃ§ois de Troy, the head of the French Academy in\nRome. It has been identified with a sculpture at the Metropolitan Museum of\nArt (John Goldsmith Phillips). Among the rich furnishings of the HÃ´tel\nTerray was a secretary desk by Bernard II van Risamburgh. It was lent to the\nExposition de l'art franÃ§ais, 1888 (no. 213), by the comtesse Terray, and noted\nas stamped B.V.R.B. by Lady Dilke, French Furniture and Decoration in the\nXVIIIth Century 1901:161 and note. His funeral monument was sculpted by\nClodion. Michael Levey, Painting and Sculpture in France 1700-1789\n1995:151\n\nAfter his death the collection was dispersed by his nephew at auction in\n1779.
