He was highly regarded\nduring his lifetime. While building electromagnets, Henry discovered the\nelectromagnetic phenomenon of self-inductance. He also discovered mutual\ninductance independently of Michael Faraday, though Faraday was the first to\npublish his results. Henry developed the electromagnet\ninto a practical device. He invented a precursor to the electric doorbell\n(specifically a bell that could be rung at a distance via an electric wire,\n1831) and electric relay (1835). The SI unit of\ninductance, the henry, is named in his honor. Henry's work on the\nelectromagnetic relay was the basis of the practical electrical telegraph,\ninvented by Samuel Morse and Charles Wheatstone separately.\n","linknr":386,"url":"Joseph_Henry","recorded":1362891442,"links":60,"instances":["astronomer","unit"],"pdf":["http://www.uscg.mil/history/webcutters/Joseph_Henry_1880.pdf","http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/58/1/1.pdf","http://www.sil.si.edu/digitalcollections/HistoryCultureCollections/SIL7-154/pdf/SIL007-154.pdf","http://www.nasonline.org/publications/biographical-memoirs/memoir-pdfs/henry-joseph.pdf"],"categories":["1797 births","1878 deaths","American physicists","People from Albany, New York","People associated with electricity","American people of Scottish descent","Secretaries of the Smithsonian Institution","Burials at Oak Hill Cemetery","People from Galway, New York","People from Saratoga County, New York","Smithsonian Institution Archives related"],"headings":["Biography","Legacy","Curriculum vitae","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bb/Jospeh_Henry_%281879%29.jpg/220px-Jospeh_Henry_%281879%29.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/Birthplace_Of_Modern_Electricity.jpg/200px-Birthplace_Of_Modern_Electricity.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/da/Joseph_Henry_-_Brady-Handy.jpg/220px-Joseph_Henry_-_Brady-Handy.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c6/Henry_Joseph_grave.jpg/170px-Henry_Joseph_grave.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e5/JosephHenry-SmithsonianCastle-20050517.jpg/170px-JosephHenry-SmithsonianCastle-20050517.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["presbyterian_church","u.s.a."],["henry","unit"],["galway","village,_new_york"],["stephen_alexander","astronomer"],["oak_hill_cemetery","washington,_d.c."],["henry","unit"]],"members":["stephen_alexander","galway","presbyterian_church","oak_hill_cemetery","henry"],"related":["Albany,_New_York","Washington,_D._C.","Physics","The_Albany_Academy","Princeton_University","Smithsonian_Institution","The_Albany_Academy","Electromagnetic_induction","Doorbell","Relay","Michael_Faraday","Charles_Grafton_Page","Mary_Anna_Henry","Presbyterian_Church_(U.S.A.)","United_States","Smithsonian_Institution","National_Institute_for_the_Promotion_of_Science","Electromagnetism","Inductance","Michael_Faraday","Electromagnet","Doorbell","Relay","SI","Inductance","Henry_(unit)","Electrical_telegraph","Samuel_Morse","Charles_Wheatstone","Albany,_New_York","Galway_(village),_New_York","Watchmaker","Silversmith","The_Albany_Academy","Surveying","Hudson_River","Lake_Erie","Civil_engineering","Mechanical_engineering","The_Albany_Academy","T._Romeyn_Beck","Terrestrial_magnetism","Magnetism","Electromagnet","William_Sturgeon","Yale_University","Electrode","Electrical_telegraph","Electric_motor","Inductance","Michael_Faraday","Stephen_Alexander_(astronomer)","Thermopile","Sunspot","Angelo_Secchi","Thaddeus_S._C._Lowe","Jet_stream","Philadelphia,_Pennsylvania","Medford,_New_York","Cincinnati,_Ohio","Confederate_States_of_America","Simon_Cameron","Union_Army_Balloon_Corps","Alexander_Graham_Bell","Washington_Philosophical_Society","Oak_Hill_Cemetery_(Washington,_D.C.)","Georgetown,_Washington,_D.C.","John_Phillips_Sousa","Transit_of_Venus_March","Smithsonian_Castle","United_States_Lighthouse_Board","United_States_Coast_Guard","Hall_of_Fame_for_Great_Americans","Bronx,_New_York","Isaac_Newton","Thomas_Jefferson_Building","Library_of_Congress","Capitol_Hill","Washington,_D.C.","Princeton_University","Joseph_Henry_House","The_Albany_Academy","Relay","Smithsonian_Institution","E._G._Squier","United_States_Lighthouse_Board","Electromagnetism","Henry_(unit)","Multiple_coil_magnet","Timeline_of_historic_inventions","Timeline_of_communication_technology","American_Philosophical_Society","History_of_Albany,_New_York","Secretary_of_the_Smithsonian_Institution","Spencer_Fullerton_Baird","Albany,_New_York","Washington,_D._C."]}
