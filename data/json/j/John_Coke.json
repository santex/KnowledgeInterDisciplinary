He was\neducated at Westminster School and Trinity College, Cambridge. After\nleaving the university he entered public life as a servant of William Cecil,\nLord Burghley, afterwards becoming deputy-treasurer of the navy and then a\ncommissioner of the navy, and being specially commended for his labours on\nbehalf of naval administration.\n\nIn 1621 Coke was elected Member of Parliament for Warwick. He was appointed a Master of Requests in 1622 and was\nknighted in 1624. In 1624 he was elected MP for St Germans and was re-elected\nfor the seat in 1625. In the parliament of 1625 Coke acted as\na secretary of state; in this and later parliaments he introduced the royal\nrequests for money, and defended the foreign policy of Charles I and Buckingham,\nand afterwards the actions of the king. His actual appointment as secretary\ndates from September 1625. He was elected MP for Cambridge University in 1626\nand 1628. Disliked by the leaders of the popular party, his speeches in the\nHouse of Commons did not improve the king's position..\n\nKing Charles ruled without a parliament from 1628 and he found Coke's industry\nvery useful to him. Coke kept his post until 1639, when he was scapegoated for\nthe humiliating Pacification of Berwick with the Scots. Dismissed from office,\nhe retired to his estate at Melbourne in Derbyshire, and then resided in London,\ndying at Tottenham on 8 September 1644.\n\nCoke in his earlier years had been a defender of absolute monarchy and greatly\ndisliked the papacy. He was described by Clarendon as \"a man of very dumb\neducation and a narrower mind\"; and again he says, \"his cardinal perfection was\nindustry and his most eminent infirmity covetousness.\"\n\nCoke's elder son, Sir John Coke was a Parliamentarian in the English Civil War,\nwhile his younger son Thomas Coke was a Royalist.\n\nThe Coke family continued to own Melbourne Hall until George Lewis Coke, an\nambiguous figure who died childless. His sister married the family's lawyer and\nthe Coke name was lost.\n","linknr":167,"url":"John_Coke","recorded":1375075950,"links":["/w/index.php?title=John_Coke&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=John_Coke&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/John_Coke_(disambiguation)","/wiki/File:George_White,_The_Right_Honourable_Sr._John_Coke_Kt._(1724).jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/07/George_White%2C_The_Right_Honourable_Sr._John_Coke_Kt._%281724%29.jpg/200px-George_White%2C_The_Right_Honourable_Sr._John_Coke_Kt._%281724%29.jpg","/wiki/Trusley","/wiki/Derbyshire","/wiki/Tottenham","/wiki/Westminster_School","/wiki/Trinity_College,_Cambridge","#cite_note-1","/wiki/England","/wiki/House_of_Commons_of_England","/wiki/Trusley","/wiki/Derbyshire","/wiki/Westminster_School","/wiki/Trinity_College,_Cambridge","#cite_note-2","/wiki/William_Cecil,_Lord_Burghley","/wiki/Member_of_Parliament","/wiki/Warwick_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","#cite_note-Willis-3","/wiki/Master_of_Requests","/wiki/Knight","/wiki/St_Germans_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","#cite_note-Willis-3","/wiki/Secretary_of_State_(England)","/wiki/Charles_I_of_England","/wiki/George_Villiers,_1st_Duke_of_Buckingham","/wiki/Cambridge_University_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Pacification_of_Berwick","/wiki/Melbourne_Hall","/wiki/Melbourne,_Derbyshire","/wiki/Derbyshire","/wiki/London","/wiki/Tottenham","/wiki/Edward_Hyde,_1st_Earl_of_Clarendon","/wiki/John_Coke_(MP_for_Derbyshire)","/wiki/Roundhead","/wiki/English_Civil_War","/wiki/Thomas_Coke_(MP_for_Leicester)","/wiki/Cavaliers","/wiki/Melbourne_Hall","/wiki/George_Lewis_Coke","/w/index.php?title=John_Coke&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/File:PD-icon.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/62/PD-icon.svg/12px-PD-icon.svg.png","/wiki/Public_domain","/wiki/Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica_Eleventh_Edition","#cite_ref-1","#cite_ref-2","http://venn.lib.cam.ac.uk/cgi-bin/search.pl?sur=&suro=c&fir=&firo=c&cit=&cito=c&c=all&tex=CK576J2&sye=&eye=&col=all&maxcount=50","/wiki/Alumni_Cantabrigienses","#cite_ref-Willis_3-0","#cite_ref-Willis_3-1","/wiki/Browne_Willis","http://books.google.com/books?id=5V09AAAAYAAJ&pg=RA2-PA1#v=onepage&q&f=false","http://books.google.com/books?id=5V09AAAAYAAJ&pg=RA2-PA229#v=onepage&q&f=false","/wiki/Parliament_of_England","/w/index.php?title=Greville_Verney&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/John_Townsend_(MP_for_Warwick)","/wiki/Member_of_Parliament","/wiki/Warwick_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/w/index.php?title=Greville_Verney&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Edward_Conway,_2nd_Viscount_Conway","/w/index.php?title=Richard_Tisdale&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Richard_Buller","/wiki/Member_of_Parliament","/wiki/St_Germans_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Sir_John_Stradling,_1st_Baronet","/wiki/Henry_Marten_(politician)","/wiki/Henry_Marten_(politician)","/wiki/John_Eliot_(statesman)","/wiki/Robert_Naunton","/wiki/Albertus_Morton","/wiki/Member_of_Parliament","/wiki/Cambridge_University_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Thomas_Eden","/wiki/Edward_Somerset,_4th_Earl_of_Worcester","/wiki/Lord_Privy_Seal","/wiki/Robert_Naunton","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/74683934","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","/wiki/Trusley","/wiki/Derbyshire","/wiki/Tottenham","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Coke&oldid=560343647","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1563_births","/wiki/Category:1644_deaths","/wiki/Category:Alumni_of_Trinity_College,_Cambridge","/wiki/Category:Secretaries_of_State_of_the_Kingdom_of_England","/wiki/Category:Lords_Privy_Seal","/wiki/Category:People_from_Derbyshire","/wiki/Category:People_of_the_Tudor_period","/wiki/Category:People_of_the_Stuart_period","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_citing_Notitia_Parliamentaria_that_were_auto-converted_and_need_a_page_number_check","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_hCards","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_incorporating_a_citation_from_the_1911_Encyclopaedia_Britannica_with_no_article_parameter","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_incorporating_text_from_the_1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identif
