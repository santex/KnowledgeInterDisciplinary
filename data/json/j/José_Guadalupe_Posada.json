{"cursor":"5855","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'JosÃ© Guadalupe Posada' (February 2, 1852 â January 20, 1913 Nick Caistor,\nMexico City: A Cultural and Literary Companion (Interlink Books,\n2000)p115 ) was a Mexican cartoonist illustrator and artist whose work has\ninfluenced many Latin American artists and cartoonists because of its satirical\nacuteness and political engagement.\n\nPosada was born in Aguascalientes, on February 2, 1852. His education in his\nearly years was drawn from his older brother Cirilo, a country school teacher,\nwho taught him reading, writing, as well as drawing. As a young teenager he went\nto work in the workshop of Trinidad Pedroso, who taught him lithography and\nengraving. In 1871, before he was out of his teens, his career began with a job\nas the political cartoonist for a local newspaper in Aguascalientes, El Jicote\n(\"The Bumblebee\"). The newspaper closed after 11 issues, reputedly because one\nof Posada's cartoons had offended a powerful local\npolitician. [http://www.mexconnect.com/mex_/history/jtuck/jtjgposada.html\nHistory of Mexico - Mexico's Daumier: Josejhg Guadalupe Posada, by Jim Tuck in\nMexico Connect ] He then moved to the nearby\ncity of LeÃ³n, Guanajuato. There he was married to Maria de JesÃºs Vela on\nSeptember 20, 1875. In Leon, a former associate of his from Aguascalientes\nassisted him in starting a printing and commercial illustration shop. They\nfocused on commercial and advertising work, book illustrations, and the printing\nof posters and other representations of historical and religious figures.\nIncluded among these figures were the Virgin of Guadalupe, the Virgin, the Holy\nChild of Atocha and Saint Sebastian. In 1883, following his success, he was\nhired as a teacher of lithography at the local Preparatory School. The shop\nflourished until 1888 when a disastrous flood hit the city. He subsequently\nmoved to Mexico City. His first regular employment in the capital was with La\nPatria Ilustrada, whose editor was Ireneo Paz, the grandfather of the later\nfamed writer Octavio Paz. He later joined the staff of a publishing firm owned\nby Antonio Vanegas Arroyo and while at this firm he created a prolific number of\nbook covers and illustrations. Much of his work was also published in\nsensationalistic broadsides depicting various current events.\n\nPosada's best known works are his [[calavera]]s, which often assume various\ncostumes, such as the [[La Calavera Catrina|Calavera de la Catrina]], the \"Skull\nof the Female Dandy\", which was meant to satirize the life of the upper classes\nduring the reign of Porfirio DÃ­az. Most of his imagery was meant to make a\nreligious or satirical point. Since his death, however, his images have become\nassociated with the Mexican holiday DÃ­a de los Muertos, the \"Day of the Dead\".\n\nLargely forgotten by the end of his life, Posada's engravings were brought to a\nwider audience in the 1920s by the French artist Jean Charlot, who encountered\nthem while visiting Diego Rivera. While Posada died in poverty, his images are\nwell known today as examples of folk art. The muralist JosÃ© Clemente Orozco knew\nPosada when he was young, and would look at him work though a window on the way\nto school, and credited Posada's work as an influence on his own.\n","linknr":150,"url":"José_Guadalupe_Posada","recorded":1375075352,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Jos%C3%A9_Guadalupe_Posada&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Jos%C3%A9_Guadalupe_Posada&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Mexican_people","/wiki/Illustration","/wiki/Latin_American","/wiki/Cartoonist","/wiki/Aguascalientes","/wiki/Lithograph","/wiki/Engraving","/wiki/Political_cartoonist","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Le%C3%B3n,_Guanajuato","/wiki/Advertising","/wiki/Virgin_of_Guadalupe","/wiki/Ireneo_Paz","/wiki/Octavio_Paz","/wiki/Sensationalist","/wiki/File:Gran_calavera_el%C3%A9ctrica2.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/de/Gran_calavera_el%C3%A9ctrica2.jpg/240px-Gran_calavera_el%C3%A9ctrica2.jpg","/wiki/File:Gran_calavera_el%C3%A9ctrica2.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Calavera","/wiki/La_Calavera_Catrina","/wiki/Dandy","/wiki/Satire","/wiki/Upper_class","/wiki/Porfirio_D%C3%ADaz","/wiki/Religion","/wiki/Holiday","/wiki/Day_of_the_Dead","/wiki/File:JG_Posada_Print_shop.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/74/JG_Posada_Print_shop.JPG/220px-JG_Posada_Print_shop.JPG","/wiki/File:JG_Posada_Print_shop.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Jean_Charlot","/wiki/Diego_Rivera","/wiki/Poverty","/wiki/Folk_art","/wiki/Mural","/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Clemente_Orozco","/w/index.php?title=Jos%C3%A9_Guadalupe_Posada&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","#cite_ref-2","http://www.mexconnect.com/mex_/history/jtuck/jtjgposada.html","/wiki/Yale_University_Press","/wiki/Dover_Publications","/wiki/Library_of_Congress","/w/index.php?title=Jos%C3%A9_Guadalupe_Posada&action=edit&section=2","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Guadalupe_Posada","http://www.newworldprints.com/","http://elibrary.unm.edu/cswr/posada/","/wiki/University_of_New_Mexico","http://www.mexconnect.com/mex_/history/jtuck/jtjgposada.html","http://www.hawaii.edu/artgallery/posada.html","http://www.mexconnect.com/mex_/history/jtuck/jtjgposada.html","http://curator-jgposada.blogspot.com/","http://www.artspawn.com/artists/Jose_Guadalupe_Posada","http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hj1VNGHMNpA","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/2539572","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=José_Guadalupe_Posada&oldid=564317142","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1852_births","/wiki/Category:1913_deaths","/wiki/Category:19th-century_engravers","/wiki/Category:20th-century_engravers","/wiki/Category:Mexican_engravers","/wiki/Category:Mexican_caricaturists","/wiki/Category:Mexican_illustrators","/wiki/Category:People_from_Aguascalientes,_Aguascalientes","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Jos%C3%A9+Guadalupe+Posada&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Jos%C3%A9+Guadalupe+Posada","/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Guadalupe_Posada","/wiki/Talk:Jos%C3%A9_Guadalupe_Posada","#","/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Guadalupe_Posada","/w/index.php?title=Jos%C3%A9_Guadalupe_Posada&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Jos%C3%A9_Guadalupe_Posada&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Jos%C3%A9_Guadalupe_Posada","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Jos%C3%A9_Guadalupe_Posada","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/
