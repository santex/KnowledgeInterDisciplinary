{"cursor":"31442","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In genomics and related disciplines, 'noncoding DNA' sequences are components of\nan organism's DNA that do not encode protein sequences. Some noncoding DNA is\ntranscribed into functional noncoding RNA molecules (e.g. transfer RNA,\nribosomal RNA, and regulatory RNAs), while others are not transcribed or give\nrise to RNA transcripts of unknown function. The amount of noncoding DNA varies\ngreatly among species. For example, over 98% of the human genome is noncoding\nDNA, while only about 2% of a typical bacterial\ngenome is noncoding DNA.\n\nInitially, a large proportion of noncoding DNA had no known biological function\nand was therefore sometimes referred to as \"'junk DNA'\", particularly in the lay\npress. Some sequences may have no biological function for the organism, such as\nendogenous retroviruses. However, many types of noncoding DNA sequences do have\nimportant biological functions, including the transcriptional and translational\nregulation of protein-coding sequences. Other noncoding sequences have likely,\nbut as-yet undetermined, functions. (This is inferred from high levels of\nhomology and conservation seen in sequences that do not encode proteins but,\nnonetheless, appear to be under heavy selective pressure.)\n\nThe Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project\nsuggested in September 2012 that over 80% of DNA in the human genome \"serves\nsome purpose, biochemically speaking\". This conclusion\nhowever is strongly criticized by other scientists. {{cite journal |title=On the immortality\nof television sets: \"function\" in the human genome according to the evolution-\nfree gospel of ENCODE |author=Dan Graur, Yichen Zheng, Nicholas Price, Ricardo\nB.
