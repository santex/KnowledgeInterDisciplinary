The powers, functions, method of appointment,\ndiscipline, and training of judges vary widely across different jurisdictions.\nThe judge is supposed to conduct the trial impartially and in an open court. The\njudge hears all the witnesses and any other evidence presented by the parties of\nthe case, assesses the credibility and arguments of the parties, and then issues\na ruling on the matter at hand based on his or her interpretation of the law and\nhis or her own personal judgment. In some jurisdictions, the judge's powers may\nbe shared with a jury. In inquisitorial systems of criminal investigation, a\njudge might also be an examining magistrate.\n",
