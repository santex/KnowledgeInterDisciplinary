In 1944 with\nthe Boston Braves he pitched two no-hitters (one a five-inning game).\n\nTobin was born in Oakland, California, where the hometown Oakland Oaks of the\nPacific Coast League picked him up. They sent him to their Bisbee-Douglas farm\nteam in the Arizona-Texas League. The New York Yankees signed him shortly\nthereafter. He played for them in Binghamton and Wheeling in 1933 and 1934. The\nYankees sent him back to Oakland in 1935, where he compiled an 11-8 record\nbefore tearing the cartilage in his left knee. Appendicitis kept him off the\nYankee roster the following year, and he went 16-8 for the Oaks.\n\nRather than return to the Oaks in 1937, he arranged a deal with the Pittsburgh\nPirates, with whom he made his major league debut on April 30, 1937.\n\nIn 1940, Tobin joined the Boston Braves, where manager Casey Stengel made him a\nrelief pitcher. On May 13, 1942, by then a starter, Tobin became the only\npitcher in modern major-league history to hit three home runs in one game (Guy\nHecker hit three homers in a game in the nineteenth century).\n\nStill with the Braves in 1944, Tobin began throwing a knuckleball, and that\nseason he threw his two no-hitters. The first was April 27, 1944, when he beat\nthe Brooklyn Dodgers 2-0. The second was a five-inning game on June 22, 1944, in\nwhich the Philadelphia Phillies fell 7-0 (officially, this game is no longer\nconsidered a true no-hitter, as it lasted fewer than nine innings).\n\nIn another interesting event in 1944, Tobin drew a walk against Cincinnati Reds\npitcher Clyde Shoun in the third inning of what would otherwise have been a\nperfect game for Shoun (who settled instead for a no-hitter).\n\nTobin was with the Tigers in 1945, when they won the American League pennant and\nthe World Series. He pitched in Game 1 of the series, on October 3, which was\nhis final major league game.\n\nHe was back in the Pacific Coast League the following year, pitching for the\nSeattle Rainiers and the San Francisco Seals. He was released in 1947, but the\nOaks re-signed him in August 1948. That year he pitched the last out against the\nSacramento Solons in a game that clinched the pennant for the Oaks.\n\nTobin was the brother of Boston Red Sox third baseman Johnny Tobin.\n","linknr":169,"url":"Jim_Tobin","recorded":1375076442,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Jim_Tobin&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Jim_Tobin&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Jim_Tobin_(hurler)","/wiki/James_Tobin_(disambiguation)","/wiki/Pitcher","/wiki/Oakland,_California","/wiki/Oakland,_California","/wiki/1937_in_baseball","/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates","/wiki/1945_in_baseball","/wiki/Detroit_Tigers","/wiki/Win_(baseball)","/wiki/Earned_run_average","/wiki/Strikeout","/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates","/wiki/1937_in_baseball","/wiki/1939_in_baseball","/wiki/Atlanta_Braves","/wiki/1940_in_baseball","/wiki/1945_in_baseball","/wiki/Detroit_Tigers","/wiki/1945_in_baseball","/wiki/Oakland,_California","/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates","/wiki/Boston_Bees","/wiki/Detroit_Tigers","/wiki/Oakland_Oaks_(PCL)","/wiki/Pacific_Coast_League","/wiki/Arizona-Texas_League","/wiki/New_York_Yankees","/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates","/wiki/1937_in_baseball","/wiki/Atlanta_Braves","/wiki/Casey_Stengel","/wiki/1942_in_baseball","/wiki/Guy_Hecker","/wiki/Brooklyn_Dodgers_(baseball)","/wiki/Philadelphia_Phillies","/wiki/Cincinnati_Reds","/wiki/Clyde_Shoun","/wiki/1945_World_Series","/wiki/Seattle_Rainiers","/wiki/San_Francisco_Seals_(baseball)","/wiki/Sacramento_Solons","/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox","/wiki/Johnny_Tobin","/w/index.php?title=Jim_Tobin&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Jim_Tobin&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/1945_Detroit_Tigers_season","/wiki/List_of_Major_League_Baseball_all-time_leaders_in_home_runs_by_pitchers","/wiki/List_of_Major_League_Baseball_no-hitters","/w/index.php?title=Jim_Tobin&action=edit&section=3","http://oaklandoaks.tripod.com/tobin.html","http://www.baseball-reference.com/t/tobinji01.shtml","http://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Jim_Tobin","/wiki/Lon_Warneke","/wiki/List_of_Major_League_Baseball_no-hitters","/wiki/Clyde_Shoun","/wiki/Template:1945_Detroit_Tigers","/wiki/Template_talk:1945_Detroit_Tigers","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:1945_Detroit_Tigers&action=edit","/wiki/Detroit_Tigers","/wiki/1945_World_Series","/wiki/Bob_Swift","/wiki/Ed_Mierkowicz","/wiki/Eddie_Mayo","/wiki/Rudy_York","/wiki/Hank_Greenberg","/wiki/Roy_Cullenbine","/wiki/Joe_Hoover","/wiki/Doc_Cramer","/wiki/Paul_Richards_(baseball)","/wiki/Tommy_Bridges","/wiki/Dizzy_Trout","/wiki/John_McHale_(baseball)","/wiki/Les_Mueller","/wiki/Hal_Newhouser","/wiki/Zeb_Eaton","/wiki/Stubby_Overmire","/wiki/Al_Benton","/wiki/Billy_Pierce","/wiki/Art_Houtteman","/wiki/Virgil_Trucks","/wiki/Bob_Maier","/wiki/Hack_Miller_(catcher)","/wiki/Walter_Wilson_(baseball)","/wiki/George_Caster","/wiki/Chuck_Hostetler","/wiki/Jimmy_Outlaw","/wiki/Skeeter_Webb","/wiki/Red_Borom","/wiki/Hub_Walker","/wiki/Steve_O%27Neill","/wiki/1945_Detroit_Tigers_season","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jim_Tobin&oldid=554584921","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1912_births","/wiki/Category:1969_deaths","/wiki/Category:Major_League_Baseball_pitchers","/wiki/Category:Pittsburgh_Pirates_players","/wiki/Category:Boston_Bees_players","/wiki/Category:Boston_Braves_players","/wiki/Category:Detroit_Tigers_players","/wiki/Category:Baseball_players_from_California","/wiki/Category:People_from_Oakland,_California","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Jim+Tobin&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Jim+Tobin","/wiki/Jim_Tobin","/wiki/Talk:Jim_Tobin","#","/wiki/Jim_Tobin","/w/index.php?title=Jim_Tobin&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Jim_Tobin&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Jim_Tobin","/
