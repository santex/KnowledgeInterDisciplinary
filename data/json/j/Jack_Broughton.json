{"cursor":"7308","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\n'John \"Jack\" Broughton' (c. 1703 or 5 July 1704 â 8 January 1789) was an English\nbare-knuckle boxer. He was the first person to ever codify a set of rules to be\nused in such contests; prior to this the \"rules\" that existed were very loosely\ndefined and tended to vary from contest to contest. His seven rules of how\nboxing would be conducted at his amphitheatre (the largest and most influential\nat that time) evolved later into the London Prize Ring rules which are widely\nregarded as the foundation stone of the sport that would become boxing, prior to\nthe development of the Marquess of Queensberry rules in the 1860s.\n\nBroughton was of obscure birth, he is variously described as being born in\neither London or Gloucestershire. He served his apprenticeship in the Port of\nLondon, initially working as a lighterman but eventually, in light of his\nphysical prowess (Broughton was nearly 6 feet tall and very muscular, weighing\nover 14 stone, or approximately 196 pounds), working as a waterman rowing\npassengers on the River Thames. In 1730 he won a major annual race on the\nThames, Doggett's Coat and Badge race which is contested to this day, against a\nnumber of other watermen who had recently finished their apprenticeships.\n\nThroughout the 1730s Broughton fought semi-professionally and earned a sizable\nreputation. Although records of fights fought in this era are few, there is no\nevidence that Broughton ever lost a fight. Following his retirement, he\ncertainly claimed to have been undefeated, and this is also claimed by Captain\nGodfrey, a man who had cudgelled with James Figg and knew the fighters of the\nera well. In his treatise on boxing published in the mid-1740s. Broughton's\nfights often attracted sizeable audiences, so much so that on one occasion a\nspectator was crushed to death. Another of his fights, the epic and fatal\nBroughton v. Stevenson, served as the inspiration for Paul Whitehead's poem The\nGymnasiad.\n\nBroughton inflicted a heavy defeat on George Taylor, who was the head of Figg's\namphitheatre after the latter's death.\n\nAs a result of his status in boxing, and with help from a number of wealthy\npatrons, he opened his own amphitheatre in 1743, in Hanway Road, near Oxford\nStreet. Here, Broughton and his team staged boxing exhibitions.\n\nBroughton drew up a set of rules for the sport that were regarded as\ndefinitive for around 100 years. The rules stipulated that a round would last\nuntil a man went down, and there was to be a 30 second interval between\nrounds.\n\nIn 1750 Broughton came out of retirement to settle a dispute with Jack Slack, a\nNorwich butcher who had allegedly insulted him. Despite being far older than his\nopponent, Broughton entered the contest as the clear favourite. However, despite\na strong start, the fight did not go his way and he suffered an embarrassing\nloss (destroying the perfect record he claimed for himself) when after 14\nminutes of struggle Slack punched him right between the eyes, creating so much\neye swelling that Broughton was unable to see his man, and thus had to retire\nfrom the bout. The Duke of Cumberland, Broughton's patron at the time (and a son\nof the king), was said to have lost Â£10,000 on the match, and accused Broughton\nof throwing the fight. This led to the eventual closing of Broughton's\namphitheatre, variously reported as 1753 or 1754. Slack was heavily rumoured at\nthe time to be the grandson of Broughton's old boxing master, James Figg. After\nthe closing of the amphitheatre, Broughton continued to teach young boxers until\nhis death. In his retirement he ran an antiques business and a furniture\nwarehouse, making such a success at it that he left an estate of some Â£6,000 to\nhis family.\n\nAside from his career in boxing, Broughton also served in the Yeomen of the\nGuard (the bodyguard of the British monarch), as a member of which he\naccompanied George II at the Battle of Dettingen, the last time a British\nmonarch fought in a battle.\n\nFollowing his death in 1789, Broughton was interred at Westminster Abbey. His\nheadstone did not bear an epitaph for nearly 200 years because the Dean of the\nAbbey felt that the epitaph that Broughton had requested was inappropriate. It\nwas not until 1988 that Broughton's request was fulfilled and the words\n\"Champion of England\" were engraved on the headstone.\n\nBroughton developed a system of parrying, \"hitting away\" (striking on retreat),\nstopping and barring blows, and his defence, according to contemporaries, was so\ncomplete as to render him nearly untouchable. His code of 7 rules formed\nguidelines for the sport until the London Prize Ring Rules (1838, which expanded\nupon Broughton's code). Broughton also was the inventor of the first boxing\ngloves, called \"muffles\", which were used in his boxing academy by his students\nto \"effectually secure them from the inconveniency of black eyes, broken jaws\nand bloody noses...â They were never used in the professional prize ring.\n\nBroughton was one of the original inductees of the International Boxing Hall of\nFame, inducted as a pioneer of the sport.\n","linknr":139,"url":"Jack_Broughton","recorded":1375072066,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Jack_Broughton&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Jack_Broughton&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/John_M._Broughton","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:INCITE","/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Fact_and_Reference_Check","/wiki/Wikipedia:When_to_cite","/wiki/File:Jack_Broughton_2.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Jack_Broughton_2.jpg/220px-Jack_Broughton_2.jpg","/wiki/File:Jack_Broughton_2.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf8/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/England","/wiki/Bare-knuckle_boxing","/wiki/London_Prize_Ring_rules","/wiki/Boxing","/wiki/Marquess_of_Queensberry_rules","/wiki/London","/wiki/Gloucestershire","/wiki/Port_of_London","/wiki/Lightermen","/wiki/Watermen","/wiki/River_Thames","/wiki/Doggett%27s_Coat_and_Badge","/wiki/Singlestick","/wiki/James_Figg","/wiki/Paul_Whitehead","/w/index.php?title=George_Taylor_(boxer)&action=edit&redlink=1","#cite_note-si-1","/wiki/Amphitheatre","/wiki/Oxford_Street","#cite_note-2","#cite_note-si-1","/wiki/Norwich","/wiki/Prince_William,_Duke_of_Cumberland","/wiki/George_II_of_England","/wiki/Yeomen_of_the_Guard","/wiki/George_II_of_Great_Britain","/wiki/Battle_of_Dettingen","/wiki/Westminster_Abbey","/wiki/Headstone","/wiki/Epitaph","/wiki/International_Boxing_Hall_of_Fame","/w/index.php?title=Jack_Broughton&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-si_1-0","#cite_ref-si_1-1","http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1072306/index.htm#","#cite_ref-2","http://www.famous-fights.com/2007/05/boxing-broughton.html","/wiki/Special:BookSources/1590130200","http://books.google.com/books?id=T7k-AAAAYAAJ","/w/index.php?title=Jack_Broughton&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/List_of_bare-knuckle_boxers","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/26916494","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jack_Broughton&oldid=540466236","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Bare-knuckle_boxers","/wiki/Category:Creators_of_sports","/wiki/Category:English_boxers","/wiki/Category:1704_births","/wiki/Category:1789_deaths","/wiki/Category:British_Army_personnel_of_the_War_of_the_Austrian_Succession","/wiki/Category:Use_dmy_dates_from_April_2012","/wiki/Category:Articles_lacking_in-text_citations_from_July_2012","/wiki/Category:All_articles_lacking_in-text_citations","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Jack+Broughton&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Jack+Broughton","/wiki/Jack_Broughton","/wiki/Talk:Jack_Broughton","#","/wiki/Jack_Broughton","/w/index.php?title=Jack_Broughton&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Jack_Broughton&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Jack_Broughton","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Jack_Broughton","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Jack_Broughton&oldid=540466236","/w/index.php?title=Jack_Broughton&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1346464","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Jack_Broughton&id=540466236","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Jack+Broughton","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Jack+Broughton&oldid=540466236&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Jack_Broughton&printable=yes","//da.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Broughton","//de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Broughton","//
