{"cursor":"71458","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nThe 'Julian calendar' was a reform of the Roman calendar introduced by Julius\nCaesar in 46 BC (708 AUC). It took effect in 45 BC (709 AUC). It was the\npredominant calendar in most of Europe, and in European settlements in the\nAmericas and elsewhere, until it was superseded by the Gregorian calendar.\n\nThe Julian calendar has a regular year of 365 days divided into 12 months, as\nlisted in Table of months. A leap day is added to February every four years. The\nJulian year is, therefore, on average 365.25 days long. It was intended to\napproximate the tropical (solar) year. Although Greek astronomers had known, at\nleast since Hipparchus, that the tropical year was a few minutes shorter than\n365.25 days, the calendar did not compensate for this difference. As a result,\nthe calendar year gained about three days every four centuries compared to\nobserved equinox times and the seasons. This discrepancy was corrected by the\nGregorian reform of 1582. The Gregorian calendar has the same months and month\nlengths as the Julian calendar, but inserts leap days according to a different\nrule. Consequently, the Julian calendar is currently 13 days behind the\nGregorian calendar, so that, for instance, 1 January in the Julian calendar is\n14 January in the Gregorian.\n\nThe Julian calendar has been replaced as the civil calendar by the Gregorian\ncalendar in all countries which formerly used it, although it continued to be\nthe civil calendar of some countries into the 20th century. Most Christian\ndenominations in the West and areas evangelized by Western churches have also\nreplaced the Julian calendar with the Gregorian one as the basis for their\nliturgical calendars. However, most branches of the Eastern Orthodox Church\nstill use the Julian calendar for calculating the dates of moveable feasts,\nincluding Easter (Pascha). Some Orthodox churches have adopted the Revised\nJulian calendar for the observance of fixed feasts, while other Orthodox\nchurches retain the Julian calendar for all purposes.

In the form of the Alexandrian calendar, it is the basis for the\nEthiopian calendar, which is the civil calendar of Ethiopia.\n","linknr":1508,"url":"Julian_calendar","recorded":1362669934,"links":109,"instances":["astronomy","reference_date","province","month","holiday","calendar","calendar","christianity","god","roman_law","lexicographer","eastern_orthodox_liturgics","jurist"],"pdf":["http://www.uni-koeln.de/phil-fak/ifa/zpe/downloads/2000/129pdf/129159.pdf","http://www.hermetic.ch/cal_stud/cassidy/shspk1zc.pdf","http://www.rhm.uni-koeln.de/103/Radke.pdf"],"categories":["Julian
