On 27 July 1859\nhe and Thomas Mair formed 'Mair, Inglis and Evatt', a machine shop in Guelph,\nOntario, producing machinery for grist and flour mills. [http://www.inglis.ca/index.php/en/about-us/our-\nheritage \"The Inglis Story\"], Whirlpool Canada In 1864 they added a steam\nengine to power the machines. Some time after 1864 Daniel Hunter replaced Thomas\nMair and the name of the business was changed to 'Inglis and Hunter'. [http://www.lib.uwo.ca/programs/companyinformationcanada/ccc-\ninglis.htm \"Business and History - John Inglis Co. Limited\"], Industrial Canada,\nMay 1967\n\nIn September 1881, Inglis purchased a large triangular plot of land near\ndowntown Toronto, west of Strachan Avenue. He moved the company there, renaming\nit 'John Inglis and Sons' after five of his sons that worked in various\ndepartments. John Inglis died in 1898 and the business was taken over by one of\nhis sons, William. In 1903, William led the company into the manufacture of\nmarine steam engines and waterworks pumping engines, and he discontinued\nproduction of its previous milling product line. The company produced the\nengines for the Canada Steamship Lines Hamonic and Huronic, which served until\n1950.\n\nThe company reincorporated in 1913 as the 'John Inglis Company Limited'. During\nWorld War I the company turned out thousands of shells and shell forgings, and\nmore than 40 steam marine engines for freighters. Among products manufactured in\nthe 1920s were boilers, grain elevating and conveying machinery, hydraulic\nturbines, tugs, and reciprocating and centrifugal pumps.\n\nThe Great Depression seriously affected the company and led to major losses\nduring the 1930s. When William died in 1935, the company went into receivership.\nThe new Toronto Island Ferry was named after him shortly after his death.\n\nIn 1937 the company was purchased by Major J. E. Hahn of Toronto, owner of\nBritish Canadian Engineering Limited, who took on the name 'John Inglis and\nCompany'. In March 1938 the company won a contract with the British and Canadian\ngovernments to supply 5,000 Bren machine guns to Great Britain and 7,000 to\nCanada. Both countries shared the capital costs of creating a factory to produce\nthem. Inglis started production in 1940; and the contracts were extended several\ntimes. By 1943 they were producing 60% of the Bren machine guns destined for the\nBritish Commonwealth forces, and 30% of the British Army's own requirements.\nThey also produced a large proportion of the Polsten 20Â mm autocannon for\nthe British Commonwealth, as well as the Browning Hi-Power pistol for both the\nCommonwealth nations and other Canadian allies (primarily the Nationalist\nChinese Army). They also produced the machinery for four Tribal class\ndestroyers.\n\nAfter the war, Inglis entered the consumer products business, producing fishing\ntackle, house trailers, oil burner pumps and domestic heaters and stoves. In\n1946 they licensed production of a wringer washer being manufactured in the US\nby the Nineteen Hundred Corporation (now Whirlpool Corporation). A fully\nautomatic washer was added in 1950, and the line continued to expand to include\nelectric and gas dryers, and dishwashers.\n\nEarly in 1945 the company had acquired a controlling interest in the English\nElectric Company of Canada in St. Catharines, Ontario, which became a wholly\nowned subsidiary in 1947. In 1951 they completed a new plant in Scarborough,\nOntario to produce the English Electric Yarrows-100 naval steam turbine under\nlicense for Canadian destroyers, including the ''St. Laurent''-class and ''Restigouche''-\nclass. The plant was purchased by English Electric in 1955 and leased back to\nInglis. Inglis later built a new addition to house the former St. Catharines\nworks, which were shut down.\n\nIn 1962 Inglis purchased the Scarborough plant back from the English Electric.\nHowever, three years later they sold it off to General Electric Canada, and in\n1966 sold off a majority of their shares in English Electric Canada to its UK\nparent in order to concentrate on the consumer products field exclusively.\n\nBy 1966 Inglis had become the leading producer of Canadian-built laundry\nmachines. In 1967, a refrigerator plant was opened in Stoney Creek, Ontario and\nproduction of dehumidifiers was added there in 1970. In 1972, Inglis produced\nits one-millionth automatic washer and began manufacturing and selling\nappliances under the Whirlpool brand name. A year later the company began\noperating under the name, Inglis Limited. New operations were opened in Laval,\nQuebec in the late 1970s, along with expansions of their Toronto operations. In\n1982, Inglis purchased parts of Canadian Admiral Corporation, and sold some of\ntheir appliances under that name.\n\nIn 1981 the company moved its head office to Mississauga, Ontario, and starting\nthe next year the downtown Toronto operations were slowly sold off. , the former\nlocation on Strachan Avenue, along with the nearby Massey Ferguson plants, are\nbeing redeveloped as housing and commercial space. All that remains is the\nlandmark giant blue and white Inglis billboard, on a small part of one of the\nold buildings not demolished. It is aimed at the Gardiner Expressway and\nfrequently flashes inspirational quotes to passing motorists.\n\nWhirlpool Corporation acquired majority interest of Inglis in 1987 and changed\nthe company name to Whirlpool Canada in 2001. \"Inglis\" is now a brand of\nhousehold appliances from Whirlpool marketed primarily in Canada. In the United\nStates, Inglis appliances are sold at Best Buy stores.
