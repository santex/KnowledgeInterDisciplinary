Jordan borders Saudi Arabia to\n the south and east, Iraq to the north-east, Syria to the north and Israel to\n the west, sharing control of the Dead Sea with the latter.\n\nThe desert kingdom emerged out of the post-World War I division of the Middle\nEast by Britain and France. In 1946, Jordan became an independent sovereign\nstate officially known as the Hashemite Kingdom of Transjordan. After capturing\nthe West Bank area of Cisjordan during the 1948–49 war with Israel, Abdullah I\ntook the title King of Jordan and Palestine, and he officially changed the\ncountry's name to the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan in 1949.\n\nModern Jordan is classified as a country of \"medium human\ndevelopment\"<ref></ref> by the 2011 Human Development Report, and an emerging\nmarket with the third freest economy in West Asia and North Africa (32nd freest\nworldwide).<ref name=\"heritage.org\"></ref> Jordan has an \"upper middle income\"\neconomy.<ref name=\"data.worldbank.org\"></ref> Jordan has enjoyed \"advanced\nstatus\" with the European Union since December 2010,<ref></ref> and it is also a\nmember of the Euro-Mediterranean free trade area.
