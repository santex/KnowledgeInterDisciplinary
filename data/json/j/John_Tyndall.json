His initial scientific fame arose in the 1850s from his\nstudy of diamagnetism. Later he studied thermal radiation, and produced a number\nof discoveries about processes in the atmosphere. Tyndall published seventeen\nbooks, which brought state-of-the-art 19th century experimental physics to a\nwider audience. From 1853 to 1887 he was professor of physics at the Royal\nInstitution of Great Britain in London.\n","linknr":688,"url":"John_Tyndall","recorded":1362500878,"links":57,"instances":["tasmania","electromagnetic_radiation","colorado","electromagnetic_radiation","physics","politics"],"pdf":["http://www.londoncentre-hstm.ac.uk/thesis/stable/2008_hankin.pdf","http://www.microform.co.uk/guides/R97614.pdf","http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=2260786&blobtype=pdf","http://www.scs.uiuc.edu/~mainzv/HIST/awards/OPA%20Papers/2001-Rubin.pdf","http://www.anesthesia-analgesia.org/cgi/reprint/107/3/890.pdf","http://www.anesthesia-analgesia.org/cgi/reprint/107/3/890.pdf","http://www.londoncentre-hstm.ac.uk/thesis/stable/2008_hankin.pdf","http://www.clarku.edu/faculty/jbrown/papers/shpayer.pdf","http://www.clarku.edu/faculty/jbrown/papers/shpayer.pdf"],"categories":["1820
