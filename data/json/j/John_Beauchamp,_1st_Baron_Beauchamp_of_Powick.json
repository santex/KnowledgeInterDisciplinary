{"cursor":"5853","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'John Beauchamp, 1st Baron Beauchamp of Powick', KG, (died April 1475) was a\nnobleman and administrator. He was the son and eventual heir of Sir William\nBeauchamp of Powick in Worcestershire (ca. 1370âca. 1421), Constable of\nGloucester, and his wife, Katherine Usflete (d. after 1436).\n\nBeauchamp's father, a near kinsman of the Earls of Warwick, had been a royal\nretainer under Richard II, Henry IV, and Henry V. On his father's death he also\nentered the king's service in the Hundred Years' War. During the 1420s Beauchamp\nserved under the Duke of Bedford in medieval France : he was captain of Pont-de-\nl'Arche in 1422â1429, lieutenant of Rouen Castle in 1429, a participant in the\nMaineâAnjou campaigns, and a counsellor to the duke and member of his household.\nAbout the time of Henry VI's visit to France for his coronation, in 1430â1432,\nhowever, he seems to have taken up a permanent post within the king's domestic\nestablishment. Some time before 1434 he married Margaret de Ferrers, possibly\ndaughter of Edmund de Ferrers, 5th Baron Ferrers of Chartley.\n\nThe death of his kinsman Richard de Beauchamp, 13th Earl of Warwick in 1439\nseems to have been the first major turning point of John Beauchamp's career,\nwhen he became joint guardian of the extensive lands of Henry de Beauchamp, 1st\nDuke of Warwick. During the following decade Beauchamp's importance grew. In\n1439 or 1440 he rose up the household ladder to become Master of the King's\nHorse. In 1445 he became a Knight of the Garter. At about the same time he seems\nto have inherited his father's estates, with their centres at Powick and at\nAlcester in Warwickshire, and became the major power in the west midlands. On\nthe death of the Duke of Warwick in 1446, Sir John felt sufficiently confident\nto launch a claim for the earldom of Warwick itself. While the powerful\ninterests clustered around the duke's female heirs ensured his failure,\nBeauchamp was able to exact a handsome price for his acquiescence. Amid a series\nof grants made in 1446â7, including his father's old office of Constable of\nGloucester and the post of Justice of South Wales, he was on 2 May 1447 elevated\nto the peerage as Lord Beauchamp of Powick.\n\nBeauchamp emerged unscathed - even enhanced - from the crisis of 1449â1450 which\nbrought about the downfall of so many of his colleagues. On 22 June 1450 he\nsucceeded the hated Lord Saye and Sele as Lord Treasurer of England, a post\nwhich he held for the next two years. Policy during his tenure was probably more\ndetermined by the conflicting designs of parliament and the recipients of royal\npatronage than by his agency. He seems to have done well financially out of his\noffice, departing with a reward of Â£400.\n\nBetween 1450 and 1453 he remained a central figure in the royal household, under\nthe Duke of Somerset, but he avoided being implicated in the duke's more\npartisan activities. Beauchamp maintained a low profile during the crisis of\n1453â1454: he stayed at Henry VI's side during the latter's madness, and was\nallotted a place as one of two âbaronsâ of the household in the Yorkist\nordinances of November 1454.\n\nIf Somerset intended to enlist him as an ally by appointing him as a councillor\non 21 February 1455, he did not succeed. Beauchamp attended the council\nsporadically but he played no part in the battle of St Albans a few months\nlater. A poem of 1458 identified him as a member of the royalist party, but this\nis almost certainly to be explained by his long-standing place at court, where\nhe became Steward of the Household in the second half of 1457. There is no\nevidence either that he ever fought for Lancaster, or that Edward IV's new\nregime was hostile towards him.\n\nIn February 1462 Beauchamp received a pardon, and in October of that year an\nexemption from the obligations of office, on the grounds of his great age. Thus\nwith the downfall of Henry VI he went into retirement rather than opposition,\nfailing to help either king against his enemies in the rebellions of 1469â1471.\nHe died between 9 and 19 April 1475 and was buried in the Dominican friary at\nWorcester. He was succeeded by his son Richard Beauchamp, 2nd Baron Beauchamp\nof Powick.\n","linknr":117,"url":"John_Beauchamp,_1st_Baron_Beauchamp_of_Powick","recorded":1375075945,"links":["/w/index.php?title=John_Beauchamp,_1st_Baron_Beauchamp_(fifth_creation)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=John_Beauchamp,_1st_Baron_Beauchamp_(fifth_creation)&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","/wiki/John_Beauchamp,_1st_Baron_Beauchamp_(fifth_creation)","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","/w/index.php?title=John_Beauchamp,_1st_Baron_Beauchamp_of_Powick&redirect=no","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Order_of_the_Garter","/w/index.php?title=William_Beauchamp,_of_Powick&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Powick","/wiki/Worcestershire","/wiki/Gloucester_Castle","/wiki/Earls_of_Warwick","/wiki/Richard_II_of_England","/wiki/Henry_IV_of_England","/wiki/Henry_V_of_England","/wiki/Hundred_Years%27_War","/wiki/John_of_Lancaster,_1st_Duke_of_Bedford","/wiki/Medieval_France","/wiki/Pont-de-l%27Arche","/wiki/Rouen_Castle","/wiki/Henry_VI_of_England","/wiki/Edmund_de_Ferrers,_5th_Baron_Ferrers_of_Chartley","/wiki/Richard_de_Beauchamp,_13th_Earl_of_Warwick","/wiki/Henry_de_Beauchamp,_1st_Duke_of_Warwick","/wiki/Master_of_the_Horse","/wiki/Knight_of_the_Garter","/wiki/Alcester","/wiki/Warwickshire","/wiki/James_Fiennes,_1st_Baron_Saye_and_Sele","/wiki/Lord_Treasurer","/wiki/Edmund_Beaufort,_1st_Duke_of_Somerset","/wiki/First_Battle_of_St_Albans","/wiki/Lord_Steward","/wiki/Edward_IV","/wiki/Worcester","/wiki/Richard_Beauchamp,_2nd_Baron_Beauchamp_of_Powick","/w/index.php?title=John_Beauchamp,_1st_Baron_Beauchamp_(fifth_creation)&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Oxford_Dictionary_of_National_Biography","/wiki/James_Fiennes,_1st_Baron_Saye_and_Sele","/wiki/Lord_High_Treasurer","/wiki/John_Tiptoft,_1st_Earl_of_Worcester","/wiki/Peerage_of_England","/wiki/Baron_Beauchamp_of_Powick","/wiki/Richard_Beauchamp,_2nd_Baron_Beauchamp_of_Powick","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Beauchamp,_1st_Baron_Beauchamp_(fifth_creation)&oldid=550918855","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Barons_in_the_Peerage_of_England","/wiki/Category:Knights_of_the_Garter","/wiki/Category:Lord_High_Treasurers_of_England","/wiki/Category:15th-century_English_people","/wiki/Category:15th-century_births","/wiki/Category:1475_deaths","/wiki/Category:Beauchamp_family","/wiki/Category:Use_dmy_dates_from_January_2012","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=John+Beauchamp%2C+1st+Baron+Beauchamp+%28fifth+creation%29&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=John+Beauchamp%2C+1st+Baron+Beauchamp+%28fifth+creation%29","/wiki/John_Beauchamp,_1st_Baron_Beauchamp_(fifth_creation)","/wiki/Talk:John_Beauchamp,_1st_Baron_Beauchamp_(fifth_creation)","#","/wiki/John_Beauchamp,_1st_Baron_Beauchamp_(fifth_creation)","/w/index.php?title=John_Beauchamp,_1st_Baron_Beauchamp_(fifth_creation)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=John_Beauchamp,_1st_Baron_Beauchamp_(fifth_creation)&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/John_Beauchamp,_1st_Baron_Beauchamp_(fifth_creation)","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/John_Beauchamp,_1st_Baron_Beauchamp_(fifth_creation)","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=John_Beauchamp,_1st_Baron_Beauchamp_(fifth_creation)&oldid=550918855","/w/index.php?title=John_Beauchamp,_1st_Baron_Beauchamp_(fifth_creation)&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6221271","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=John_Beauchamp%2C_1st_Baron_Beauchamp_%28fifth_creation%29&id=550918855","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=John+B
