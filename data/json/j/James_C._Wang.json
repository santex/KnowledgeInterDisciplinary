He is a Harvard University Professor of biochemistry and\nmolecular biology. Wang was the first discoverer of topoisomerases.

He then taught at the University of California at\nBerkeley from 1966 until 1977, when he joined the faculty at Harvard University.\nHe was named the Mallinckrodt Professor of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at\nHarvard in 1988.\n\nWang discovered DNA\ntopoisomerases http://www.jbc.org/content/282/22/e17.full (or local\nenzymes) and proposed a mechanism for their operation in the 1970s. He also\nstudied the configuration (or topology) of DNA, an approach that proved fruitful\nin helping to explain how the structure of the double helix coils and relaxes.\n","linknr":117,"url":"James_C._Wang","recorded":1362579089,"links":13,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["1936 births","Living people","American biochemists|Wang","American biologists","Chinese emigrants to the United States","Chinese biochemists","Chinese biologists|Wang","Educators from Jiangsu","Harvard University faculty","Members of Academia Sinica","Molecular biologists|Wang","National Taiwan University alumni|Wang","Naturalized citizens of the United States","University of California, Berkeley faculty","Scientists from Jiangsu","Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences"],"headings":["References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Harvard_University","Biochemistry","Molecular_biology","Topoisomerase","Academician","Taiwan","Academia_Sinica","United_States","National_Academy_of_Science","National_Taiwan_University","California_Institute_of_Technology","University_of_California_at_Berkeley","DNA","Double_helix"]}
