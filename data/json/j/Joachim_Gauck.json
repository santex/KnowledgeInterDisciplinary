In 1990\nhe served as a member of the only freely elected People's Chamber for the\nAlliance 90. Following German reunification, he was elected by the Bundestag as\nthe first Federal Commissioner for the Stasi Archives, serving from 1990 to\n2000. As Federal Commissioner, he earned recognition as a \"Stasi hunter\" and\n\"tireless pro-democracy advocate,\" exposing the crimes of the former communist\nsecret police. |publisher=Wn.de |date=30 June 2010\n|accessdate=20 February 2012}}\n\nHe was nominated as the candidate of the SPD and the Greens for President of\nGermany in the 2010 election, but narrowly lost to Christian Wulff, the\ncandidate of the government coalition. His candidacy was met by significant\napproval of the population and the media; [[Der Spiegel]] described him as \"the\nbetter President\" and the [[Bild]] called him \"the president of\nhearts.\" |publisher=Bild.de |date=\n|accessdate=20 February 2012}} After Christian Wulff had\nstepped down, Gauck was elected President with 991 of 1228 votes in the Federal\nConvention in the 2012 election, as a nonpartisan consensus candidate of the\nCDU, the CSU, the FDP, the SPD and the Greens.\n\nA son of a survivor of a Soviet\nGulag, Gauck's political life was\nformed by his own family's experiences with totalitarianism.

He has called for increased awareness of communist\ncrimes in Europe, and for the necessity of delegitimizing the communist era.
