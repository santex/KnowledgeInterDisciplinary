Nicknamed \"Honest John\",\nAnderson played for six seasons in the National League from 1894 to 1899 and\nthen in the American League from 1900 to 1908.\n\nAnderson was born in Sarpsborg, Norway; he was the first of only three Major\nLeague baseball players to have ever been born in the country. He first appeared\nin the National League in , when he signed with the Brooklyn Grooms. He spent\nthe next three full seasons with Brooklyn and was primarily used as an\noutfielder, and batted over .300 in both and .\n\nDuring the season, he was sold to the Washington Senators, only to be sold back\nto Brooklyn four months later. Nevertheless, he managed to have one of his best\nseasons, leading the National League with 22 triples and also leading the\nleague in slugging percentage and extra-base hits. Anderson stayed in Brooklyn\nfor the before being purchased by the Milwaukee Brewers of the newly formed\nAmerican League.\n\nAnderson was one of the league's best hitters in the AL's first year as a Major\nLeague in . (In , the American League was still considered a minor league.) As\nthe Brewers' first baseman, he finished second in the league in base hits and\ndoubles, trailing only Nap Lajoie in both categories, ranked third in runs\nbatted in behind Lajoie and Buck Freeman, and was sixth in the league with a\n.330 average.\n\nHe stayed with the franchise when it relocated to St. Louis in to become the\nBrowns. He played two seasons in St. Louis and recorded virtually identical .284\nbatting averages in those years.\n\nOn September 24, 1903, Anderson tried to steal second base when the base was\nalready occupied. This particular mistake was often referred to as a \"John\nAnderson play\" in the early part of the century\n[http://www.baseballlibrary.com/ballplayers/player.php?name=Bobby_Wallace_1873]\n\nAnderson was dealt to the New York Highlanders before the season in exchange for\nJack O'Connor. He played one full season in New York and batted .278 with the\nclub. He started the season in New York but was waived after a slow start. The\nWashington Senators (officially a different franchise from the team he played\nfor in 1898) claimed him off of waivers, and he recovered to bat .279 on the\nseason, good enough for ninth in the AL in the midst of the dead-ball era.\n\nHe remained in Washington for the next two seasons. In , Anderson tied for the\nAmerican League lead in stolen bases with Elmer Flick. He left Washington after\nhis contract was purchased by the Chicago White Sox for the season. He played\nfor one season with the Pale Hose to end his career in the Major Leagues.\n\nAnderson retired with a .290 career average, 49 home runs, and 976 runs batted\nin. He also finished his career with 124 triples, currently tying him for 90th\nplace all-time in that category.\n\nHe died at the age of 74 in Worcester, Massachusetts.\n","linknr":209,"url":"John_Anderson_(outfielder)","recorded":1375076855,"links":["/w/index.php?title=John_Anderson_(outfielder)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=John_Anderson_(outfielder)&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Johnandersoncard.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/91/Johnandersoncard.jpg/200px-Johnandersoncard.jpg","/wiki/Outfielder","/wiki/First_baseman","/wiki/Sarpsborg,_Norway","/wiki/Worcester,_Massachusetts","/wiki/Batting_average","/wiki/Home_run","/wiki/Run_batted_in","/wiki/Stolen_base","/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers","/wiki/1894_in_baseball","/wiki/1898_in_baseball","/wiki/Washington_Senators_(1891-1899)","/wiki/1898_in_baseball","/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers","/wiki/1898_in_baseball","/wiki/1899_in_baseball","/wiki/Baltimore_Orioles","/wiki/1901_in_baseball","/wiki/1903_in_baseball","/wiki/New_York_Yankees","/wiki/1904_in_baseball","/wiki/1905_in_baseball","/wiki/Minnesota_Twins","/wiki/1905_in_baseball","/wiki/1907_in_baseball","/wiki/Chicago_White_Sox","/wiki/1908_in_baseball","/wiki/Slugging_Percentage","/wiki/List_of_Major_League_Baseball_stolen_base_champions","/wiki/Sarpsborg","/wiki/Norway","/wiki/Major_League_Baseball","/wiki/Outfielder","/wiki/First_baseman","/wiki/National_League","/wiki/American_League","/wiki/Sarpsborg","/wiki/Norway","/wiki/List_of_Countries_With_Their_First_Major_League_Player","/wiki/1894_in_baseball","/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers","/wiki/Batting_average","/wiki/1896_in_baseball","/wiki/1897_in_baseball","/wiki/1898_in_baseball","/wiki/Washington_Senators_(1891-1899)","/wiki/Triple_(baseball)","/wiki/Slugging_percentage","/wiki/Extra-base_hit","/wiki/1899_in_baseball","/wiki/Baltimore_Orioles","/wiki/1901_in_baseball","/wiki/1900_in_baseball","/wiki/Minor_league","/wiki/Base_hit","/wiki/Double_(baseball)","/wiki/Nap_Lajoie","/wiki/Runs_batted_in","/wiki/Buck_Freeman","/wiki/St._Louis,_Missouri","/wiki/1902_in_baseball","http://www.baseballlibrary.com/ballplayers/player.php?name=Bobby_Wallace_1873","/wiki/New_York_Yankees","/wiki/1904_in_baseball","/wiki/Jack_O%27Connor_(catcher)","/wiki/1905_in_baseball","/wiki/Minnesota_Twins","/wiki/Dead-ball_era","/wiki/1906_in_baseball","/wiki/Stolen_base","/wiki/Elmer_Flick","/wiki/Chicago_White_Sox","/wiki/1908_in_baseball","/wiki/Worcester,_Massachusetts","/wiki/Massachusetts","/w/index.php?title=John_Anderson_(outfielder)&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/List_of_Major_League_Baseball_players_with_100_triples","/wiki/List_of_Major_League_Baseball_leaders_in_career_stolen_bases","/wiki/List_of_Major_League_Baseball_stolen_base_champions","/wiki/List_of_Major_League_Baseball_triples_champions","/w/index.php?title=John_Anderson_(outfielder)&action=edit&section=2","http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/a/anderjo01.shtml","http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=1000232","http://www.thebaseballcube.com/profile.asp?P=John-Anderson","http://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/player.cgi?id=anders010joh","http://www.baseballlibrary.com/baseballlibrary/ballplayers/A/Anderson_John.stm","http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/Pandej101.htm","/wiki/Retrosheet","/wiki/Danny_Hoffman","/wiki/List_of_Major_League_Baseball_stolen_base_champions","/wiki/1906_in_baseball","/wiki/Elmer_Flick","/wiki/Ty_Cobb","/wiki/Template:1899_Brooklyn_Superbas","/wiki/Template_talk:1899_Brooklyn_Superbas","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:1899_Brooklyn_Superbas&action=edit","/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers","/wiki/National_League","/wiki/Doc_Casey","/wiki/Bill_Dahlen","/wiki/Tom_Daly_(infielder)","/wiki/Jack_Dunn_(baseball)","/wiki/Duke_Farrell","/wiki/Jay_Hughes","/wiki/Hughie_Jennings","/wiki/Fielder_Jones","/wiki/Willie_Keeler","/wiki/Joe_Kelley","/wiki/Brickyard_Kennedy","/wiki/Dan_McGann","/wiki/Deacon_McGuire","/wiki/Doc_McJames","/wiki/Joe_Yeager","/wiki/Ned_Hanlon_(baseball)","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","/wiki/Sarpsborg,_Norway","/wiki/Worcester,_Massachusetts","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Anderson_(outfielder)&oldid=544525770","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1873_births","/wiki/Category:1949_deaths","/wiki/Category
