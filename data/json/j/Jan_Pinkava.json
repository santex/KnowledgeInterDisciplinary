The family emigrated to Britain in 1969, where he obtained British\ncitizenship.\n\nHe attended Colchester Royal Grammar School from 1974 to 1982 showing\ninterest and talent in the arts, music, drama and sculpture. (One of his\njuvenile sculptures 'Big Cat' was acquired by Essex University and put on\npermanent display outside the library.)\n\nAfter obtaining an 8mm movie camera for Christmas in 1975, he began\nexperimenting with pixilation, stop-motion plasticine, paper-drawn and cel\nanimation. He had some early prize-winning successes in animation competitions.\nMost notably, he won the Young Film-Maker's Competition of the Year Award 1980\non the long-running (1969 to 1984) BBC children's quiz series [[Screen Test]]\nfor his animated short \"The Rainbow\". This was hailed in 2001 on\nChannel 4's 100 Greatest Kids' TV shows by ex-Screen Test presenters Michael\nRodd and Brian Trueman as \"the only occasion in the history of the competition\nwhere we came across a piece of film that was spectacularly professional\", a\nclip of him receiving the award is shown in the 2007 film [[Son of Rambow]].\n\nHe went on to study Computer Science at the University of Wales, Aberystwyth,\nwhere he graduated with first class honours and obtained his PhD,\nDuring this time he also represented his university in archery, fencing and hang-\ngliding competitions, and continued developing his cartoon drawing skills.\n\nAfter university he turned to a career in computer animation initially in\nLondon, with Digital Pictures, who specialised in TV commercials.\n\nIn 1993 he joined Pixar, and moved to the USA. His \"Arrows\" TV commercial for\nListerine won the Gold Clio Award in 1994.\n\nHis 1997 animated short Geri's Game won the Oscar on his mother's birthday,\nwhich prompted him to dedicate the award to her long-distance, with a message in\nCzech   and won a string of other awards.\n\nThe short film [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt4qQ6VoTzY \"67 Aluminum Plates\"]\nwas created during the 1998 Ottawa International Animation Festival by a group\nof volunteers under the direction of Jan Pinkava. The film is stop motion,\nfilmed in one long day and edited the next. It was shown on the\nclosing night of the festival.\n\nIn 2000, he began work as director on [[Ratatouille (film)|Ratatouille]], a European-\nflavored, ultimate-outsider tale based on his original story. This was to have\nbeen his feature film debut and the first Pixar film beyond the terms of the\nthen-expiring Pixar-Disney franchise. In 2005, Pinkava was replaced as main\ndirector by [[The Incredibles]] director Brad Bird. In an interview given in\n2006, Pinkava had \"no comment\"  about this turn of events and for\ntwo years staunchly refrained from comment on the genesis of the\nfilm. At the time when he was replaced, Pinkava had written the core\nstoryline of the film and created the styling, key characters and\nsets. Following his departure from the project, Pinkava initially\nundertook other duties and then left the company. In the final film,\nPinkava is credited for his original story idea\n[http://vzjp.cz/JJP/storyby.jpg] and as the co-director. The film was nominated\nfor five Academy Awards, including a nomination for Pinkava (along with Jim\nCapobianco and Brad Bird) in the Best Original Screenplay category.\n\nHe subsequently worked as a director at LAIKA on his new film Little White\nLie, but left in 2011 along with Claire\nJennings.\n","linknr":178,"url":"Jan_Pinkava","recorded":1375067805,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Jan_Pinkava&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Jan_Pinkava&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:JanPinkavaHeadShot.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/JanPinkavaHeadShot.JPG/220px-JanPinkavaHeadShot.JPG","/wiki/Prague","/wiki/Czechoslovakia","/wiki/Prague","/wiki/Pixar","/wiki/Geri%27s_Game","/wiki/Ratatouille_(film)","/wiki/Czechs","/wiki/Polymath","/wiki/Jan_K%C5%99esadlo","/wiki/British_citizenship","/wiki/Colchester_Royal_Grammar_School","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Essex_University","/wiki/Pixilation","/wiki/Stop-motion","/wiki/Cel_animation","/wiki/BBC","/wiki/Screen_Test","#cite_note-2","/w/index.php?title=100_Greatest_Kids%27_TV_shows&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Michael_Rodd","/wiki/Brian_Trueman","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/wiki/Son_of_Rambow","/wiki/University_of_Wales,_Aberystwyth","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Computer_animation","/wiki/Pixar","/wiki/Listerine","/wiki/Clio_Award","/wiki/Geri%27s_Game","/wiki/Academy_Award","#cite_note-4","http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt4qQ6VoTzY","/wiki/Ottawa_International_Animation_Festival","#cite_note-5","/wiki/Film_director","/wiki/Ratatouille_(film)","/wiki/The_Incredibles","/wiki/Brad_Bird","#cite_note-6","#cite_note-7","#cite_note-8","#cite_note-9","http://vzjp.cz/JJP/storyby.jpg","/w/index.php?title=Jim_Capobianco&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Brad_Bird","/wiki/Best_Original_Screenplay","/wiki/Laika_(company)","#cite_note-10","#cite_note-11","/w/index.php?title=Claire_Jennings&action=edit&redlink=1","#cite_note-12","/w/index.php?title=Jan_Pinkava&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","http://www.gazette-news.co.uk/archive/1999/07/08/Essex+Archive/5527238.Colchester__Oscar_winner_s_film_screening_at_school/","#cite_ref-2","http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/326077","#cite_ref-3","http://www.walesonline.co.uk/whats-on/whats-on-news/2007/10/20/the-welsh-days-of-animation-great-91466-19980395/","#cite_ref-4","http://aaspeechesdb.oscars.org/link/070-18/","#cite_ref-5","http://www.awn.com/articles/reviews/67-aluminum-plates","#cite_ref-6","http://www.computerarts.co.uk/in_depth/interviews/q_and_a_jan_pinkava","#cite_ref-7","http://animatedviews.com/2008/pinkava-on-pixar-projects/","#cite_ref-8","http://www.animationartconservation.com/index.php?c=art&p=articles_ratatouille","#cite_ref-9","http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1630548,00.html","#cite_ref-10","http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/two-writers-ready-tell-little-20920","#cite_ref-11","http://www.linkedin.com/pub/jan-pinkava/2a/aa8/202","#cite_ref-12","http://www.oregonlive.com/business/index.ssf/2011/03/laika_parts_with_claire_jennin.html","/w/index.php?title=Jan_Pinkava&action=edit&section=2","http://vzjp.cz/JJP/index.htm","http://theoscarsite.com/whoswho8/pinkava_j.htm","http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0684342/","/wiki/Internet_Movie_Database","http://www.pixar.com/artistscorner/jan/index.html","http://www.awn.com/asifa-sf/0398/news.html","http://www.computerarts.co.uk/in_depth/interviews/q_and_a_jan_pinkava","http://www.itwales.com/996964_INTERVIEW-Jan-Pinkava.htm","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","/wiki/Prague","/wiki/Czechoslovakia","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jan_Pinkava&oldid=555930840","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:People_educated_at_Colchester_Royal_Grammar_School","/wiki/Category:Czech_animators","/wiki/Category:British_animators","/wiki/Category:British_film_directors","/wiki/Category:English_people_of_Czech_descent","/wiki/Category:Alumni_of_Aberystwyth_University","/wiki/Category:People_from_Prague","/wiki/Category:1963_births","/wiki/Category:Living_people","/wiki/Category:Directors_of_Best_Animated_Short_Academy_Award_winners","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_hCards","/wiki/Category:All_articles_with_unsourced_statements","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_unsourced_statements_from_December_2012","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Jan+Pinkava&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin
