Marty\nDieckmeyer was soon brought in as a replacement for the departing Paxton.\nSometime in the middle of 1975, Jubal's Last Band or Jubal (as a shortened form\nof the name was briefly used) auditioned for Maranatha! Music and Calvary Chapel\n(without Baxter, who couldn't get off work) in hopes of signing a recording and\nperformance contract. At a Maranatha Music meeting, another band led by Darrell\nMansfield, was also using the name, Jubal. The two bands decided to change their\nnames to avoid confusion. Mansfield renamed his band [[Gentle Faith]], and\nJubal's Last Band/Jubal became Daniel Amos.\n\nDaniel Amos succeeded in landing a recording and performance contract, and\nquickly recorded their first song for the label, Taylor's \"Ain't Gonna Fight\nIt\" for the Maranatha 5 compilation. A full album, produced by Al Perkins,\nfollowed. Chamberlain quickly became an important part in the sound of D.A. In\nthe band's early days of country/rock, Chamberlain would often launch into a\nrock and roll guitar solo inappropriately in the middle of \"Happily Married\nMan.\" In the later years, his guitar playing drove songs like \"Endless Summer\"\nand \"I Love You #19.\"\n\nAlthough Chamberlain left DA in late 1983, he did return on a few later albums\nincluding [[Motor Cycle]] (1993) (which he co-produced), [[BibleLand]] (1994)\nand [[Songs of the Heart]] (1995).\n\nChamberlain was married to singer/songwriter/guitarist/bassist Sharon McCall\nfrom 1980 to 2005. The couple had a band together in the mid-1980s called Boy-O-\nBoy, shopping demos and playing clubs of L.A.\n\nIn 2001, Chamberlain and McCall recorded a song (\"Message From The Country\")\nwith pop rocker Doug Powell (Swag), drumlord Ken Coomer (Wilco, Uncle\nTupelo, Swag) and session ace Jonathan Yudkin (The Chain Smoking Altar Boys)\nfor the Jeff Lynne tribute Lynne Me Your Ears (2002) under the moniker, The\nBalls of France.\n\nThe years 2004â2005 saw Chamberlain and McCall join forces with friends to form\nan all-British Invasion outfit called The Pickled Beats. The band continues,\nwith slight lineup changes, to play the occasional live performance.\n\nIn 2006, Chamberlain once again joined forces with Terry Taylor by lending a\nhand on the Lost Dogs album [[The Lost Cabin and the Mystery Trees]].\nChamberlain also returned to his Swirling Eddies pseudonym \"Spot,\" for the 2007\nrelease [[The midget, the speck and the molecule]].\n\nAfter meeting and doing gigs together over 30 years ago in California,\nChamberlain and veteran folk-pop-rock singer-songwriter/record\nproducer/musician/vocalist Pam Mark Hall joined forces as the duo, Pamelita and\nParker, in the Fall of 2008.\n","linknr":190,"url":"Jerry_Chamberlain","recorded":1362566216,"links":12,"instances":["rock_band","band"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Living people","American rock guitarists","American rock singers","American male singers","American singer-songwriters","American composers","People from Nashville, Tennessee","Musicians from Tennessee","1952 births"],"headings":["External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["swag","band"],["wilco","rock_band"]],"members":["wilco","swag"],"related":["Inglewood,_California","Lead_Guitar","Rock_music","Pop_rock_music","Alternative_music","Singer","Songwriter","Guitarist","Record_producer","Daniel_Amos","Boy-O-Boy","Swirling_Eddies","The_Balls_of_France","The_Pickled_Beats","Pamelita_&_Parker","Inglewood,_California","California","Singing","Songwriter","Guitarist","Record_producer","Rock_music","Daniel_Amos","The_Swirling_Eddies","Terry_Scott_Taylor","Steve_Baxter","Kenny_Paxton","Marty_Dieckmeyer","Maranatha!_Music","Calvary_Chapel","Darrell_Mansfield","Daniel_Amos","Al_Perkins","Sharon_McCall","Boy-O-Boy","Swag_(band)","Wilco_(rock_band)","Uncle_Tupelo","The_Chain_Smoking_Altar_Boys","Jeff_Lynne","The_Balls_of_France","British_Invasion","The_Pickled_Beats","Lost_Dogs","Swirling_Eddies","Folk_music","Pop_music","Rock_music","Singer-songwriter","Record_producer","Musician","Vocalist","Pam_Mark_Hall","Pamelita_and_Parker"]}
