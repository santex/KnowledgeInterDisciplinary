He made important contributions to the\nemergence of genetic epidemiology and pursued an understanding of the influence\nof environment on genes. In his early work, he studied sickle-cell disease and\nconducted research on the effects of radiation on survivors of the Hiroshima\natomic bombing. In 1956, Neel established the University of Michigan Department\nof Genetics, the first department of human genetics at a medical school in the\nUnited States. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and\nSciences in 1971.\n\nOf particular interest to Neel was an understanding of the human genome in an\nevolutionary light, a concept he addressed in his fieldwork with cultural\nanthropologist Napoleon Chagnon among the Yanomamo in Brazil and Venezuela. His\ninvolvement in this fieldwork came under heavy scrutiny and criticism in the\nDarkness in El Dorado controversy, a scandal in anthropology that broke in 2000\ninvolving numerous allegations of unethical research that threatened serious\ndamage to Neel's reputation, despite the fact that he had died months earlier.\nUltimately, however, scholars and researchers exonerated Neel of all of the\nserious accusations.\n","linknr":614,"url":"James_V._Neel","recorded":1362485084,"links":31,"instances":["journalist"],"pdf":["http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterN.pdf","http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterN.pdf","http://www.nasonline.org/publications/biographical-memoirs/memoir-pdfs/neel-james.pdf"],"categories":["1915 births","2000 deaths","People from Hamilton, Ohio","American geneticists","National Medal of Science laureates","College of Wooster alumni","University of Rochester alumni","University of Michigan faculty","Fellows of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences","Recipients of the Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research"],"headings":["See also","References","Bibliography","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a4/Flag_of_the_United_States.svg/40px-Flag_of_the_United_States.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/03/Scientist.svg/30px-Scientist.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/75/Science-symbol-2.svg/30px-Science-symbol-2.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["patrick_tierney","journalist"]],"members":["patrick_tierney"],"related":["Human_genetics","United_States","Epidemiology","Gene","Sickle-cell_disease","Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki","University_of_Michigan","Medical_school","American_Academy_of_Arts_and_Sciences","Human_genome","Theory_of_evolution","Anthropology","Napoleon_Chagnon","Yanomamo","Brazil","Venezuela","Darkness_in_El_Dorado","Darkness_in_El_Dorado","Patrick_Tierney_(journalist)","Yanomamo","Thrifty_gene_hypothesis"]}
