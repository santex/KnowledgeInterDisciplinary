His work on the applications of thermodynamics was\ninstrumental in transforming physical chemistry into a rigorous deductive\nscience. Together with James Clerk Maxwell and Ludwig Boltzmann, he created\nstatistical mechanics (a term that he coined), explaining the laws of\nthermodynamics as consequences of the statistical properties of large ensembles\nof particles. Gibbs also worked on the application of Maxwell's equations to\nproblems in physical optics. As a mathematician, he invented modern vector\ncalculus (independently of the British scientist Oliver Heaviside, who carried\nout similar work during the same period).\n\nIn 1863, Yale awarded Gibbs the first American doctorate in engineering. After a\nthree-year sojourn in Europe, Gibbs spent the rest of his career at Yale, where\nhe was professor of mathematical physics from 1871 until his death. Working in\nrelative isolation, he became the earliest theoretical scientist in the United\nStates to earn an international reputation and was praised by Albert Einstein as\n\"the greatest mind in American history\". In 1901 Gibbs\nreceived what was then considered the highest honor awarded by the international\nscientific community, the Copley Medal of the Royal Society of London, \"for his contributions to mathematical physics\".\n\nCommentators and biographers have remarked on the contrast between Gibbs's\nquiet, solitary life in turn of the century New England and the great\ninternational impact of his ideas. Though his work was almost entirely\ntheoretical, the practical value of Gibbs's contributions became evident with\nthe development of industrial chemistry during the first half of the 20th\ncentury. According to Robert A. Millikan, in pure science Gibbs \"did for\nstatistical mechanics and for thermodynamics what Laplace did for celestial\nmechanics and Maxwell did for electrodynamics, namely, made his field a well-\nnigh finished theoretical structure.\"\n","linknr":1144,"url":"Josiah_Willard_Gibbs","recorded":1362480438,"links":86,"instances":["crater","literature","united_states","new_jersey","clothing","mathematical_physics","matter","device","new_hampshire","optics","united_states"],"pdf":["http://books.nap.edu/html/biomems/amichelson.pdf","http://books.nap.edu/html/biomems/amichelson.pdf","http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/1970/samuelson-lecture.pdf","http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/1970/samuelson-lecture.pdf","http://www.aps.org/units/fhp/newsletters/upload/february03.pdf","http://www.aps.org/units/fhp/newsletters/upload/february03.pdf","http://web.mit.edu/16.unified/www/FALL/thermodynamics/figures/MechEng-4-2006-Gibbs.pdf","http://web.mit.edu/16.unified/www/FALL/thermodynamics/figures/MechEng-4-2006-Gibbs.pdf"],"categories":["1839
