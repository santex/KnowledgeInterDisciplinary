{"cursor":"4092","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Joseph (Joe) Toole' (1887 - 4 June 1945) was a British Labour politician.\n\nToole was born in 1887, and was the eldest of thirteen children. He began\nworking at the age of 12 as a street scavenger in Manchester by day and as a\nnewspaper vendor by night. He subsequently had various jobs, before establishing\nhis own stationery business. He joined the Labour Party, and was elected to\nManchester City Council in 1919.\n\nIn 1923 he was elected as Labour member of parliament for Salford South,\nunseating the sitting Conservative MP. In the following year another election\nwas held, with the Conservatives regaining the seat. At the following election\nin 1929 Toole was able to regain Salford South for Labour. He was MP for two\nyears before a swing against Labour at the 1931 general election cost him his\nseat. He stood again, without success, in 1935.\n\nToole returned to local government as an alderman for the Openshaw ward of\nManchester City Council. He was Lord Mayor of the city in 1936/37.\n\nIn January 1944 Toole stood as an independent anti-government candidate at a\nparliamentary by-election in Skipton. Although he only garnered 3,029 votes and\nlost his deposit, his intervention was enough to enable Hugh Lawson of the\nCommon Wealth Party to defeat the coalition candidate by 221 votes. Toole was\npromptly expelled from the Labour Party for breaking the war-time electoral\ntruce between the main political parties.\n\nBy the time of his death in June 1945, Toole had moved to Blackpool, where he\noperated a private hotel. He continued to be a member of Manchester City Council\nuntil his death.\n","linknr":154,"url":"Joseph_Toole_(British_politician)","recorded":1375075924,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Joseph_Toole_(British_politician)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Joseph_Toole_(British_politician)&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/United_Kingdom","/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)","/wiki/Manchester","#cite_note-obit-1","/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1923","/wiki/Member_of_parliament","/wiki/Salford_South_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)","/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1924","/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1929","/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1931","/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1935","#cite_note-obit-1","/wiki/Alderman","/wiki/Openshaw","/wiki/Ward_(politics)","/wiki/Lord_Mayor_of_Manchester","#cite_note-obit-1","#cite_note-2","/w/index.php?title=Skipton_by-election,_1944&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Hugh_McDowall_Lawson","/wiki/Common_Wealth_Party","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Blackpool","#cite_note-obit-1","/w/index.php?title=Joseph_Toole_(British_politician)&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-obit_1-0","#cite_ref-obit_1-1","#cite_ref-obit_1-2","#cite_ref-obit_1-3","/wiki/The_Times","#cite_ref-2","http://www.manchester.gov.uk/site/scripts/documents_info.php?categoryID=1001&documentID=1158&pageNumber=4","#cite_ref-3","/wiki/The_Times","http://www.leighrayment.com/commons.htm","/wiki/Wikipedia:V#SELF","/wiki/Wikipedia:NOTRS","/w/index.php?title=Joseph_Toole_(British_politician)&action=edit&section=2","http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/people/mr-joseph-toole","/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Sir_Anderson_Montague-Barlow,_1st_Baronet","/wiki/Member_of_Parliament","/wiki/Salford_South_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1923","/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1924","/wiki/Edmund_Ashworth_Radford","/wiki/Edmund_Ashworth_Radford","/wiki/Member_of_Parliament","/wiki/Salford_South_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1929","/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1931","/wiki/John_Joseph_Stourton","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","/wiki/File:Bigben_small.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b5/Bigben_small.png/25px-Bigben_small.png","/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)","/wiki/Member_of_Parliament","/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joseph_Toole_(British_politician)&action=edit","/wiki/Template:Labour-UK-MP-stub","/wiki/Template_talk:Labour-UK-MP-stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Labour-UK-MP-stub&action=edit","/wiki/File:Flag_of_England.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/be/Flag_of_England.svg/30px-Flag_of_England.svg.png","/wiki/File:Crystal_personal.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/24/Crystal_personal.svg/30px-Crystal_personal.svg.png","/wiki/England","/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joseph_Toole_(British_politician)&action=edit","/wiki/Template:England-mayor-stub","/w/index.php?title=Template_talk:England-mayor-stub&action=edit&redlink=1","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:England-mayor-stub&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joseph_Toole_(British_politician)&oldid=480376671","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1887_births","/wiki/Category:1945_deaths","/wiki/Category:Labour_Party_(UK)_MPs","/wiki/Category:Members_of_the_United_Kingdom_Parliament_for_English_constituencies","/wiki/Category:UK_MPs_1923%E2%80%931924","/wiki/Category:UK_MPs_1929%E2%80%931931","/wiki/Category:Lord_Mayors_of_Manchester","/wiki/Category:Labour_MP_(UK)_stubs","/wiki/Category:English_mayor_stubs","/wiki/Category:Accuracy_disputes_from_March_2012","/wiki/Category:All_pages_needing_factual_verification","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_needing_factual_verification_from_March_2012","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_incorporating_an_LRPP-MP_template_without_an_unnamed_parameter","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Joseph+Toole+%28British+politician%29&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Joseph+Tool
