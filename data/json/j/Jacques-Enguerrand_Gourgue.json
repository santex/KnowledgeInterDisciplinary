{"cursor":"4692","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Jacques-Enguerrand Gourgue' (Port au Prince, 1930â1996) was one of Haiti's most\nrenowned painters in the 20th century.\n\nA Port-au-Prince native, Gourgue began painting at an early age and eventually\nhad his works exhibited throughout Europe and the Americas. His father was a\nFrench psychiatrist, and his mother said to be a Haitian vodou priestess. He typically painted scenes of rural Haitian life\nand vodou ceremonies. Gourgue, who had no formal training, often combined\nflowers, mountains, skeletal trees, peasants and their huts and vodou symbolism,\nin a personal style that managed to combine surrealism and naive art. \"He is\nbeyond dispute the leading figure in modern Haitian painting.\" [http://www.egallery.com/artists/?id=119\nBiography of Gallery website]\n\nAfter a turbulent and troubled childhood, Gourgue came to Centre d'Art in Port-au-\nPrince in 1947. The following year his painting \"The Magic Table\"âan\n\"unprecedented picture\" âwas exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art in\nNew York, and it is still part of its permanent collection. In 1949, at the age of 18, he won the gold medal of an\nexhibition commemorating the bicentennial of the founding of Port au Prince.\n\nDuring the decades of the 1950s and 1960s his style was greatly influenced by\nPablo Picasso, in what is known as his \"Spanish period.\" At that time he moved\nto Madrid, Spain, where he married a Spanish woman and had a daughter. He\nexhibited his work throughout Europe and North America, achieving major\nsuccesses. Several of his works have been auctioned at Christies and Sothebys of\nNew York.\n\n\"Gourgue's imagery is not easily interpreted by those not familiar with Haitian\nlife, folklore, and religion,\" wrote Ute Stebich, a noted expert on Haitian art.\n\"Juxtaposing familiar objects in a personal, always new and surprising way, his\nworks seem to resist rather than to invite analysis. The artist's intention is\nto force the viewer to meet him on the level of the subconscious, giving free\nrein to emotion and fantasy.\"\n\nAfter his divorce he moved to his hometown, where he painted most of his later\nwork, including a large mural that decorated the flag of Haiti in the Seville\nExpo of 1992. He remarried and had two children with his second wife. He died in\n1996 due to a heart attack.
