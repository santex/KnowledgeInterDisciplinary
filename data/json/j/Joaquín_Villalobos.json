The ERP was one of the five\norganizations that joined together in 1980 to form the Farabundo MartÃ­ National\nLiberation Front during the Salvadoran Civil War, in which left-wing guerrillas\nfought El Salvadorâs military-dominated and US-backed right-wing government. An\neconomics student and left-wing activist, Villalobos joined the ERP in 1971, at\nthe age of 19. He has since been accused of involvement in the killing in 1975\nof Roque Dalton, the revolutionary poet and fellow ERP leader who was shot by\nhis comrades after a power struggle in the group led to accusations that he was\na CIA spy. At the time, the killing led to splits and\nrecriminations within the ERP and criticism from other leftists, but after 1980\nVillalobos rose to become one of the FMLNâs main military strategists. The ERP\nunder his leadership has been described as âthe most efficient military\norganisation on the Salvadoran leftâ during the civil war, with Villalobos\ndeveloping a âreputation for brash strategic brillianceâ. He subsequently played\na major role in the negotiations that ended the civil war, presenting himself as\nthe conciliatory face of the ERP. In 1992, the year in which the\npeace agreement was signed, [[The New York Times]] described him as a âfeared\nmilitary commander with a reputation for ruthlessnessâ, but also noted his\nadmission of errors in the rebelsâ tactics and his stated regret for many of the\nkillings they had been involved in.\n\nAs a result of the 1992 peace accords, the FMLN was legalized as a political\nparty. Villalobos remained a member until 1995, when he and other former leaders\nof the ERP split from the FMLN to form a new centrist political party, the\nDemocratic Party, which signed a deal with the then government accepting a\nseries of neoliberal reforms. Later in the 1990s, Villalobos\nwent to England to study at St Anthony's College, Oxford University on a\nscholarship funded by the British Foreign Office.\n\nVillalobos is now an outspoken critic of the left in Latin American countries.\nHe has served as a consultant on peacemaking efforts in other countries\n(Colombia, Mexico, Sri Lanka, Philippines, Bosnia, Northern Ireland), as an\nadvisor to the Center of Cooperation Initiatives for Development at the\nUniversity of AlcalÃ¡ de Henares, and as a member of the\n[http://www.thedialogue.org/ Inter-American Dialogue] in Washington DC, USA.\nHe lives in Oxfordshire with his wife, Roxana, and 3 sons, Guillermo, Felipe\nand Rafael.\n","linknr":126,"url":"Joaquín_Villalobos","recorded":1375084412,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Joaqu%C3%ADn_Villalobos&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Joaqu%C3%ADn_Villalobos&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/People%27s_Revolutionary_Army_(El_Salvador)","/wiki/Farabundo_Mart%C3%AD_National_Liberation_Front","/wiki/People%27s_Revolutionary_Army_(El_Salvador)","/wiki/Marxist","#cite_note-LRB-1","/wiki/Farabundo_Mart%C3%AD_National_Liberation_Front","/wiki/Salvadoran_Civil_War","/wiki/Roque_Dalton","#cite_note-LRB-1","#cite_note-LRB-1","/wiki/Chapultepec_Peace_Accords","/wiki/The_New_York_Times","#cite_note-NYT-2","/w/index.php?title=Democratic_Party_(El_Salvador)&action=edit&redlink=1","#cite_note-LRB-1","/wiki/England","/wiki/St_Anthony%27s_College","/wiki/Oxford_University","/wiki/Foreign_and_Commonwealth_Office","#cite_note-Oxmail-3","/wiki/Colombia","/wiki/Mexico","/wiki/Sri_Lanka","/wiki/Philippines","/wiki/Bosnia_and_Herzegovina","/wiki/Northern_Ireland","/w/index.php?title=Center_of_Cooperation_Initiatives_for_Development&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/University_of_Alcal%C3%A1_de_Henares","http://www.thedialogue.org/","/w/index.php?title=Joaqu%C3%ADn_Villalobos&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-LRB_1-0","#cite_ref-LRB_1-1","#cite_ref-LRB_1-2","#cite_ref-LRB_1-3","#cite_ref-NYT_2-0","http://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/09/magazine/out-of-the-jungle-in-el-salvador-rebels-with-a-new-cause.html?pagewanted=2","#cite_ref-Oxmail_3-0","http://archive.oxfordmail.net/1999/3/16/82599.html","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","/wiki/File:Flag_of_El_Salvador.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/34/Flag_of_El_Salvador.svg/30px-Flag_of_El_Salvador.svg.png","/wiki/File:Crystal_personal.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/24/Crystal_personal.svg/30px-Crystal_personal.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joaqu%C3%ADn_Villalobos&action=edit","/wiki/Template:ElSalvador-politician-stub","/wiki/Template_talk:ElSalvador-politician-stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:ElSalvador-politician-stub&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joaquín_Villalobos&oldid=560145852","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1951_births","/wiki/Category:Living_people","/wiki/Category:Salvadoran_communists","/wiki/Category:Rebels","/wiki/Category:Salvadoran_Civil_War","/wiki/Category:Farabundo_Mart%C3%AD_National_Liberation_Front_politicians","/wiki/Category:Salvadoran_politician_stubs","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Joaqu%C3%ADn+Villalobos&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Joaqu%C3%ADn+Villalobos","/wiki/Joaqu%C3%ADn_Villalobos","/wiki/Talk:Joaqu%C3%ADn_Villalobos","#","/wiki/Joaqu%C3%ADn_Villalobos","/w/index.php?title=Joaqu%C3%ADn_Villalobos&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Joaqu%C3%ADn_Villalobos&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Joaqu%C3%ADn_Villalobos","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Joaqu%C3%ADn_Villalobos","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Joaqu%C3%ADn_Villalobos&oldid=560145852","/w/index.php?title=Joaqu%C3%ADn_Villalobos&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q934686","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Joaqu%C3%ADn_Villalobos&id=560145852","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Joaqu%C3%ADn+Villalobos","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Joaqu%C3%ADn+Villalobos&oldid=560145852&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Joaqu%C3%ADn_Villalobos&printable=yes","//de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joaqu%C3%ADn_V
