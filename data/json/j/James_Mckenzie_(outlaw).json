{"cursor":"4745","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'James Mckenzie' (or in his native ), possibly born in Ross-shire, Scotland, in\n1820 was a New Zealand outlaw who has become one of the country's most enduring\nfolk heroes. The correct spelling of Mckenzie is unclear and he is variously\nreferred to as James, John or Jock. His surname has been spelt as both\n'MacKenzie' and 'McKenzie' - the latter being more commonly used. He may also\nhave had at least one alias, 'John Douglass'.\n\nMckenzie emigrated to Australia in about 1849, arriving in Melbourne where he\npurchased a team of bullocks for carrying goods to the gold-diggings. He managed\nto save Â£1,000 and moved to New Zealand, arriving at Nelson. He worked as a\ndrover in Canterbury before moving on to Otago where he applied for a land grant\nin the Mataura district.\n\nIn March 1855, Mckenzie was caught stealing 1,000 sheep from Levels Station,\nnorth of Timaru. After escaping his accusers, he walked 160 kilometres\n(100 mi) to Lyttelton, where he was caught by the police. He was\nsubsequently sentenced to five years hard labour after being found guilty by a\nLyttelton Supreme Court jury in April 1855.\n\nHe escaped from prison on at least two occasions, in May and June 1855, neither\nescape lasting more than three days, after which he was placed in irons and\nclosely watched. In September 1855, the Christchurch resident magistrate\ninvestigated Mckenzie's case and found serious flaws in the police inquiry and\ntrial. Mckenzie was given an unconditional pardon on 11 January 1856 after\nspending only nine months in prison.\n\nAfter being freed, Mckenzie sailed for Australia from Lyttelton in January 1856,\nbut nothing certain is known of his later life.\n","linknr":122,"url":"James_Mckenzie_(outlaw)","recorded":1375079805,"links":["/w/index.php?title=James_Mckenzie_(outlaw)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=James_Mckenzie_(outlaw)&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/James_Mackenzie_(disambiguation)","/wiki/File:James_mackenzie_reward.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/ac/James_mackenzie_reward.jpg/220px-James_mackenzie_reward.jpg","/wiki/File:James_mackenzie_reward.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf8/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Scottish_Gaelic_language","/wiki/Ross-shire","/wiki/Scotland","/wiki/New_Zealand","/wiki/Outlaw","/wiki/Folk_hero","/wiki/Australia","/wiki/Melbourne","/wiki/Nelson,_New_Zealand","/wiki/Canterbury_Region","/wiki/Otago","/wiki/Mataura","/wiki/Timaru","/wiki/Lyttelton,_New_Zealand","/w/index.php?title=James_Mckenzie_(outlaw)&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Mackenzie_Basin","#cite_note-1","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Mike_Harding_(New_Zealand)","#cite_note-3","/w/index.php?title=James_Mckenzie_(outlaw)&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-1","http://www.forestandbird.org.nz/what-we-do/campaigns/save-the-mackenzie","/wiki/Royal_Forest_and_Bird_Protection_Society_of_New_Zealand","#cite_ref-2","http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/1/story.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10495357","/wiki/The_New_Zealand_Herald","#cite_ref-3","http://folksong.org.nz/mckenzie/index.html","http://www.teara.govt.nz/1966/M/MckenzieJames/MckenzieJames/en","http://www.dnzb.govt.nz/dnzb/default.asp?Find_Quick.asp?PersonEssay=1M30","http://folksong.org.nz/mckenzie/index.html","/w/index.php?title=James_Mckenzie_(outlaw)&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/24166936","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=James_Mckenzie_(outlaw)&oldid=554196658","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1820_births","/wiki/Category:New_Zealand_outlaws","/wiki/Category:Scottish_outlaws","/wiki/Category:New_Zealand_escapees","/wiki/Category:Scottish_escapees","/wiki/Category:Escapees_from_New_Zealand_detention","/wiki/Category:New_Zealand_people_of_Scottish_descent","/wiki/Category:Scottish_Gaelic-speaking_people","/wiki/Category:People_from_Ross_and_Cromarty","/wiki/Category:Articles_containing_Scottish_Gaelic-language_text","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/wiki/Category:Year_of_death_unknown","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=James+Mckenzie+%28outlaw%29&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=James+Mckenzie+%28outlaw%29","/wiki/James_Mckenzie_(outlaw)","/wiki/Talk:James_Mckenzie_(outlaw)","#","/wiki/James_Mckenzie_(outlaw)","/w/index.php?title=James_Mckenzie_(outlaw)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=James_Mckenzie_(outlaw)&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/James_Mckenzie_(outlaw)","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/James_Mckenzie_(outlaw)","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=James_Mckenzie_(outlaw)&oldid=554196658","/w/index.php?title=James_Mckenzie_(outlaw)&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6139582","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=James_Mckenzie_%28outlaw%29&id=554196658","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=James+Mckenzie+%28outlaw%29","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=James+Mckenzie+%28outlaw%29&oldid=554196658&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=James_Mckenzie_(outlaw)&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.or
