Watson, Crick, and Maurice\nWilkins were awarded the 1962 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine \"for their\ndiscoveries concerning the molecular structure of nucleic acids and its\nsignificance for information transfer in living material\". [http://nobelprize.org/medicine/laureates/1962/index.html The\nNobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1962]. Nobel Prize Site for Nobel Prize in\nPhysiology or Medicine 1962. After studies at the University of Chicago\nand Indiana University, he worked at the University of Cambridge's Cavendish\nLaboratory in England, where he first met his future collaborator and friend\nFrancis Crick.\n\nIn 1956, Watson became a junior member of Harvard University's Biological\nLaboratories, holding this position until 1976, promoting research in molecular\nbiology. Between 1988 and 1992, Watson was associated with the National\nInstitutes of Health, helping to establish the Human Genome Project. Watson has\nwritten many science books, including the textbook The Molecular Biology of the\nGene http://www.amazon.com/Molecular-Biology-Gene-6th-\nEdition/dp/080539592X/ref=pd_rhf_ee_s_cp_4 (1965) and his bestselling book\n[[The Double Helix]] (1968) about the DNA structure discovery, reissued in a new\nedition in 2012 - The Annotated and Illustrated Double Helix edited by Alex Gann\nand Jan Witkowski.\n\nFrom 1968 he served as director of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL) on\nLong Island, New York, greatly expanding its level of funding and research. At\nCSHL, he shifted his research emphasis to the study of cancer. In 1994, he\nstarted as president and served for 10 years. He was appointed chancellor,\nserving until 2007.\n","linknr":1638,"url":"James_Watson","recorded":1362675469,"links":114,"instances":["textbook","geneticist","biologist","biochemistry","uk","film"],"pdf":["http://www.pubmedcentral.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=385941&blobtype=pdf","http://www.pubmedcentral.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=385941&blobtype=pdf","http://www.nature.com/nature/dna50/watsoncrick.pdf","http://www.nature.com/nature/dna50/watsoncrick.pdf","http://www.nature.com/nature/dna50/wilkins.pdf","http://www.nature.com/nature/dna50/wilkins.pdf","http://www.nature.com/nature/dna50/franklingosling.pdf","http://www.nature.com/nature/dna50/franklingosling.pdf","http://chem-faculty.ucsd.edu/joseph/CHEM13/DNA1.pdf"],"categories":["1928
