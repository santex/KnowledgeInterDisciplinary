He was appointed on 23 November 1967 by\nUnited Nations Secretary General, U Thant, as Special Envoy under the terms of\nUN Security Council Resolution 242 to negotiate the implementation of the\nresolution.\n\nThe governments of Israel, Egypt, Jordan and Lebanon recognized Jarring's\nappointment and agreed to participate [http://domino.un.org/unispal.nsf/9-\na798adbf322aff38525617b006d88d7/9c1564a379bc943d0525654f005d71cc!OpenDocument-\n&Highlight=2,S%2F10070 \"See Security Council Document S/10070 Para 2.\"]\nin his shuttle diplomacy, although they differed on key points of\ninterpretation of the resolution. The government of Syria rejected Jarring's\nmission on grounds that total Israeli withdrawal was a prerequisite for\nfurther negotiations.

This Israel will never do.\" Policy,\nBackground: The Components of a Secure Peace, 10 March 1971, Embassy of\nIsrael, Washington DC\n\nThe talks continued under Jarring's auspices until 1973, but bore no results.\nAfter 1973, the Jarring mission was replaced by bilateral and multilateral peace\nconferences.\n\nThe impasse in Jarring's efforts appears to be related to differing\ninterpretations of the security council resolution. Israel insisted that any\nefforts should be undertaken with the goal of direct peace negotiations between\nIsrael and the Arab states; and that no territory concessions could be\ncontemplated without the prospect of a lasting peace. The Arab states and the\nSoviet Union maintained that there would be no direct talks with Israel (in\nkeeping with the Khartoum Resolution), and that withdrawals were a pre-condition\nfor any further talks.\n\nAt the time of his appointment, Jarring was the Swedish ambassador to the Soviet\nUnion at that time and he maintained his ambassadorship during the mission.\nCritics since then have pointed out that Jarring had to manage a difficult\nconflict of interest since he had to maintain his duties as Swedish ambassador\nto the Soviet Union while trying to facilitate talks in which the Soviet Union\nhad its own interests.\n\nA recent unpublished study of the Jarring mission claims that Jarring's efforts\nactually paved the way for the future peace talks, and thus were not as\ninsignificant as is common to assume.
