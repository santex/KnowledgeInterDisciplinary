{"cursor":"11760","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Moral equivalence' is a term used in political debate, usually to criticize any\ndenial that a moral hierarchy can be assessed of two sides in a conflict, or in\nthe actions or tactics of two sides. The term originates from a 1906 address by\nWilliam James entitled [[wikisource:The Moral Equivalent of War|The Moral\nEquivalent of War]], subsequently published in essay form in 1910. William\nJames. (1910). [http://librivox.org/the-moral-equivalent-of-war-by-william-\njames/ \"The Moral Equivalent of War\"]; retrieved 2013-1-13.\n\nThe term has some limited currency in polemic debates about the Cold War, and\nmore currently, the Arab-Israeli conflict. \"Moral equivalence\" began to be used\nas a polemic term-of-retort to \"moral relativism\", which had been gaining use as\nan indictment against political foreign policy that appeared to use only a situation-\nbased application of widely-held ethical standards.\n\nThe purveyors of the device usually start by believing their side is morally\nsuperior. They use history, possibly selectively, to cast the situation as a big-\npicture struggle against an evil power. This evil could be totalitarianism or\ngenocidal policies or some other ostentatious villainy. They then justify the\natrocities of their own side by claiming it to be a lesser evil compared with\nallowing the evil power to have its own way. These atrocities in this way become\nacts of good, not evil.\n\nInternational conflicts are sometimes viewed similarly, and interested parties\nperiodically urge both sides to conduct a ceasefire and negotiate their\ndifferences. However these negotiations may prove difficult in that both parties\nin a conflict believe that they are morally superior to the other, and are\nunwilling to negotiate on basis of moral equivalence.\n","linknr":199,"url":"Moral_equivalence","recorded":1362539280,"links":17,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Morality|Equivalence","Political terminology","Concepts in ethics"],"headings":["Cold War","Arab-Israeli conflict","World War II atrocities","See also","Further reading","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg/20px-Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Moral_hierarchy","William_James","Cold_War","Arab-Israeli_conflict","Moral_relativism","Situational_ethics","Ethics","Totalitarianism","Genocide","Superiority_complex","Cold_War","Formal_fallacy","Leftist","United_States","Totalitarian","Chile","Salvador_Allende","Communist_Party","Augusto_Pinochet","Cold_War","Economically","Moral_hierarchy","Korean_War","1956_Hungarian_Revolution","Cuban_missile_crisis","Vietnam_War","Soviet_war_in_Afghanistan","Nicaragua","Guatemala","Jacobo_Arbenz","United_Fruit_Company","Jeane_Kirkpatrick","United_Nations","Ronald_Reagan","Imprimis","Communists","Ronald_Reagan","Sandinista","Nicaragua","USSR","NATO_expansion","Rogue_states","Invasion_of_Iraq","War_on_Terror","Islamic_fundamentalists","Anti-Israeli","Russia","People's_Republic_of_China","Drug_traffickers","Serbs","Nationalists","Arab-Israeli_conflict","Terrorism","Suicide_bombing","Israeli_Defense_Forces","Hamas","Gaza","Anti-semitism","Yaacov_Lozowick","Axis_powers","Axis_powers","Holocaust","Second_World_War","Nazis","Final_Solution","National_Democratic_Party_of_Germany","F.J.P._Veale","Noam_Chomsky","Joseph_Sobran","Nicholson_Baker","Dresden_firebombing","Robert_H._Jackson","Nuremberg_Trials","Moral_relativism","Morality","Ethics","Jeane_Kirkpatrick","Imprimis"]}
