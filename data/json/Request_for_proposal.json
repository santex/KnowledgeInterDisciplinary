The RFP process brings structure to the procurement\ndecision and is meant to allow the risks and benefits to be identified clearly\nup front. Glenn Wheaton (2008) [http://www.epiqtech.com/request-for-proposal-\nrfp.htm Request for Proposal] online at Epiqtech.com (accessed on November 21,\n2008)\n\nThe RFP presents preliminary requirements for the commodity or service, and may\ndictate to varying degrees the exact structure and format of the supplier's\nresponse. Effective RFPs typically reflect the strategy and short/long-term\nbusiness objectives, providing detailed insight upon which suppliers will be\nable to offer a matching perspective.
