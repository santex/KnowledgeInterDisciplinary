He was sired by the great stakes winner Bull\nLea, the sire of Citation. His dam was Armful, whose sire was Belmont Stakes\nwinner Chance Shot, and whose grandsire was the great Fair Play.\n\nSmall for his age and very headstrong, Armed's habit of biting and kicking hay\nout of his handler's pitchfork, along with being practically untrainable, caused\nhis trainer, Ben A. Jones, to send him back to Calumet Farm to be gelded and\nturned out to grow up. He returned to the track late in his two-year-old season\nand resumed training.\n\nHis first start was as a three year old the following February and he won at\nHialeah Park by eight lengths. He won again less than a week later but then won\nonly once in five starts and had to be rested due to an ankle injury.\n\nArmed raced for seven seasons, from 1944 to 1950, finishing with a 41-20-10\nrecord in 81 starts. Ridden by Douglas Dodson, the 1947 season saw him defeat\nU.S. Triple Crown champion Assault in a match race at Belmont Park and also set\na new track record of 2:01-3/5 for one and one-quarter miles while winning the\nWidener Handicap and carrying 129 pounds. He repeated as American Champion Older\nMale Horse and was voted 1947 American Horse of the Year honors. In the Horse of\nthe Year poll conducted by Turf and Sport Digest magazine he received 151 of a\npossible 173 votes to win the title from Citation, Stymie, Bewitch and\nAssault.<ref></ref> Armed died in 1964 of an intestinal tumor.<ref\nname=\"arm1965\"></ref> In 1963, Armed was inducted into National Museum of Racing\nand Hall of Fame. In [[The Blood-Horse]] ranking of the top 100 U.S.\nthoroughbred champions of the 20th Century, he was ranked #39.\n","title":"armed","headings":["References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["3: Gelding","2: Bull_Lea","2: United_States","2: Calumet_Farm","2: Ben_A._Jones","2: Widener_Handicap","2: American_Champion_Older_Male_Horse","2: American_Horse_of_the_Year","2: National_Museum_of_Racing_and_Hall_of_Fame","1: Washington_Handicap","1: Suburban_Handicap","1: Washington_Park_Handicap","1: Stars_and_Stripes_Breeders'_Cup_Turf_Handicap","1: Gulfstream_Park_Handicap","1: Arlington_Handicap","1: McLennan_Handicap","1: Blood-Horse_magazine_List_of_the_Top_100_Racehorses_of_the_20th_Century","1: Thoroughbred","1: Horse_racing","1: Graded_stakes_race","1: Belmont_Stakes","1: Hay","1: Pitchfork","1: Horse_trainer","1: Hialeah_Park","1: Ankle","1: Douglas_Dodson","1: United_States_Triple_Crown_of_Thoroughbred_Racing","1: Match_race","1: Belmont_Park","1: Intestinal","1: Tumor","1: Blood-Horse_magazine_List_of_Top_100_Racehorses_of_the_20th_Century","1: Avalyn_Hunter"]}
