{"cursor":"21170","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Depth perception' is the visual ability to perceive the world in three\ndimensions (3D) and the distance of an object. 'Depth sensation' is the\ncorresponding term for animals, since although it is known that animals can\nsense the distance of an object (because of their ability to move accurately, or\nto respond consistently, according to that distance), it is not known whether\nthey \"perceive\" it in the same subjective way that humans do.\n\nDepth perception arises from a variety of depth cues. These are typically\nclassified into binocular cues that are based on the receipt of sensory\ninformation in three dimensions from both eyes and monocular cues that can be\nrepresented in just two dimensions and observed with just one\neye. Sternberg, R. K. (2012). Sensation and perception (6th ed.).\nPacific Grove CA: Wadsworth. Binocular cues include stereopsis, eye\nconvergence, disparity, and yielding depth from binocular vision through\nexploitation of parallax. Monocular cues include size: distant objects subtend\nsmaller visual angles than near objects, grain, size, and Parallax.\n","linknr":387,"url":"Depth_perception","recorded":1362562914,"links":26,"instances":["visual","eye","eye","vision","physics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Vision","Stereoscopy","Perception","Visual perception","Mental processes"],"headings":["Monocular cues","Binocular cues","Evolution","Depth perception in art","Disorders affecting depth perception","See also","References","Bibliography","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Box_1.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["motion","physics"],["perspective","visual"],["contrast","vision"],["accommodation","eye"],["convergence","eye"],["perspective","visual"]],"members":["perspective","accommodation","convergence","contrast","motion"],"related":["Visual_perception","Dimension","Three-dimensional_space","Binocular_vision","Monocular_vision","Stereopsis","Binocular_vision","Parallax","Visual_angle","Parallax","Virtual_Boy","Monocular_vision","Parallax","Binocular_vision","Orthogonal","Motion_(physics)","Kinetic_depth_perception","Perspective_(visual)","Aerial_perspective","Contrast_(vision)","Color_saturation","Computer_graphics","Distance_fog.","Spectrum","Cézanne","Picture_plane","Accommodation_(eye)","Ciliary_muscles","Focal_length","Proprioception","Occultation","Curvilinear_perspective","Visual_field","Fisheye_lens","Texture_gradient","Lighting","Shading","Depth_of_field","Human_eye","Binocular_vision","Stereopsis","Animal","Retina","Triangulation","Magic_Eye","Autostereogram","3-D_film","Stereoscopy","Convergence_(eye)","Extraocular_muscles","Herbivore","Predator","Boston_University","Squirrels","Birds","Tarsiers","Bird_of_prey","Talons","Photograph","Painting","Stereoscope","Viewmaster","3D_film","Charles_Wheatstone","Telephoto_lens","Distance_fog","Perspective_(visual)","Rembrandt","Cézanne","Cubism","Braque","Picasso","Robert_Delaunay","Eiffel_Tower","John_Marin","Post-Impressionist","Japanese_art","Hokusai","Hiroshige","Big_Lie","Cubism","Modern_art","Amblyopia","Optic_nerve_hypoplasia","Strabismus","Visual_perception","Senses","Optical_illusion","Retina","Orthoptics","Vision_therapy","Perception","Human_eye","Visual_cliff","Cyclopean_stimuli","Arboreal_theory"]}
