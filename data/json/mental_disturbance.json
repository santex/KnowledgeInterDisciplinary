(Armand Gautier) ICD10 = MeshID =\n| D001523 }}\nA 'mental disorder' or 'psychiatric disorder' is a psychological pattern or\nanomaly, potentially reflected in behavior, that is generally associated with\ndistress or disability, and which is not considered part of normal development\nin a person's culture. Mental disorders are generally defined by a combination\nof how a person feels, acts, thinks or perceives. This may be associated with\nparticular regions or functions of the brain or rest of the nervous system,\noften in a social context. The recognition and understanding of mental health\nconditions have changed over time and across cultures and there are still\nvariations in definition, assessment and classification, although standard\nguideline criteria are widely used. In many cases, there appears to be a\ncontinuum between mental health and mental illness, making diagnosis\ncomplex.<ref>The United States Department of Health and Human Services. Mental\nHealth: A Report of the Surgeon General. \"Chapter 2: The Fundamentals of Mental\nHealth and Mental Illness.\" pp 39 [http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/psych205-\n2.2.pdf] Retrieved May 21, 2012</ref> According to the World Health Organisation\n(WHO), over a third of people in most countries report problems at some time in\ntheir life which meet criteria for diagnosis of one or more of the common types\nof mental disorder.<ref name=\"WHOICPE\"></ref>\n\nThe causes of mental disorders are varied and in some cases unclear, and\ntheories may incorporate findings from a range of fields. Services are based in\npsychiatric hospitals or in the community, and assessments are carried out by\npsychiatrists, clinical psychologists and clinical social workers, using various\nmethods but often relying on observation and questioning. Clinical treatments\nare provided by various mental health professionals. Psychotherapy and\npsychiatric medication are two major treatment options, as are social\ninterventions, peer support and self-help. In a minority of cases there might be\ninvoluntary detention or involuntary treatment, where legislation allows. Stigma\nand discrimination can add to the suffering and disability associated with\nmental disorders (or with being diagnosed or judged as having a mental\ndisorder), leading to various social movements attempting to increase\nunderstanding and challenge social exclusion. Prevention is now appearing in\nsome mental health strategies.\n",
