Matthew, p.\n32 According to the Lombard chronicler Falco of Benevento, he was \"of\ndelicate constitution, he could endure neither labour nor hardship.\"\n\nIn the final month of 1127, Pope Honorius II came to Benevento to preach a\ncrusade against Count Roger II of Sicily in order to prevent the union of his\ncounty with the duchy of Apulia (Duke William II being recently deceased). At\nthe start of 1128, Honorius II granted investiture to Robert which made the\nprincipalities of Capua independent from Apulia. The pope endeavoured to gain\nRobert's loyalty to help defeat Roger II of Sicily in return for remissions of\nhis sins. Houben, p. 45 - 46 He was quickly recruited for the\nendeavour by the pope, who went to Capua for the ceremony. The pope probably\nhoped to use Capua as a counterpoise against Apulia, as in the days of Robert's\ngrandfather and great grandfather. Likewise, Robert may have intended to be the\nchief papal protector, as his ancestors had been. However, he was weak-willed\nand he soon fell ill and wanted out. Eventually, the coalition commenced\nnegotiations on Roger's arrival with an army. Honorius even successfully\nnegotiated the independence of Capua. In 1129, however, Robert submissively\nsurrendered suzerainty to the duke of Apulia Telese, p. 20 and, the\nnext year (on 25 December 1130) it was believed by Falco of Benevento that, as\nRoger's vassal-in-chief, laid the crown on his head at his royal coronation.\nThis is difficult to believe as it was such a crucial role and Roger II would\nnot have wanted Robert, as one of his vassals, to perform such an important\ntask, even if he was one of the highest rank. Houben, p.55-56\n\nIn 1132, Robert rebelled with many other south Italian vassals of the king of\nSicily and with the support of Pope Innocent II and his coalition of Louis VI of\nFrance, Henry I of England, and the Emperor Lothair II. Robert defeated Roger at\nthe Battle of Nocera on 24 July, but Roger burnt Aversa and, by 1134, forced\nRanulf, count of Alife, and the nominally Byzantine Duke Sergius VII of Naples\nto submit. Robert was given an ultimatum; if he wanted to keep his title, he\nmust submit to Roger. After the death of Roger's wife, Elvira, and the false\nnews of Roger's death, Robert went to Naples from Pisa with 8000 men. He was met\nby Rainulf and Duke Sergius when Roger arrived in June 1135, he again offered\nRobert a choice to keep his title. Houben, p.66 Roger made his third\nson Alfonso prince in his stead (1135).\n\nRobert fled to Pisa, where he gathered a navy and made war against Roger in\nSicily, but it was a stalemate. The Pisan fleet ravaged Amalfi and took much\nloot. Laden with this plunder and accompanied by a papal legation, Robert went\nto Germany to plead for the aid of the emperor. In Spring 1137, the emperor came\ndown with Pope Innocent II; Henry the Proud, duke of Bavaria; and a large force.\nThey took Benevento, Bari, and Capua itself, installing Ranulf as duke of Apulia\nand Robert in Capua, vindicating these actions in battle. But when the emperor\nleft Italy, Roger sacked Capua yet again. On 25 July 1139, Robert and the pope\nwere defeated in battle on the Garigliano, at Galluccio, ambushed by Roger. The\npope was captured, though Robert escaped. They thereafter acknowledged him as\nprincipatus Capuae. He spent most of the next fifteen years in exile in\nGermany. Houben p168 When Alfonso died in 1144, Roger made his fourth\nson William prince. However, following Roger's death in 1154, there was a revolt\non the mainland, led by Robert II of Basunvilla, cousin of the new king William\nI. Houben, p167\n\nWhen William was excommunicated by Pope Adrian IV, and with (unjustified)\nrumours that the Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa was set to invade southern\nItaly, Prince Robert was tempted to make a comeback. He swore homage to Adrian\nretook Capua (1155), taking advantage of William's serious illness. Houben,\np 168-169 However, in the spring of 1156 William recovered and took a\nfleet to the mainland. He dealt, first, with the more serious threat from Robert\nof Basunvilla and the other Apulian and Campanian rebels, but then he turned to\nCapua. Robert was captured. He might have been executed as a traitor, but\ninstead William sent him as a prisoner to Palermo, where he was possibly\nblinded. Houben, p 169, quoting Hugo Falcandus, The History of the Tyrants\nof Sicily\n\nRobert left a son named Jordan who lived in Constantinople, where he served\nthe Emperor Manuel I Comnenus as [[sebastos]] and diplomat. He journeyed to\nRome in 1166-1167 to try and aid the reunion of the Roman Catholic and Eastern\nOrthodox churches.\n","linknr":165,"url":"Robert_II_of_Capua","recorded":1375082775,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Robert_II_of_Capua&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Robert_II_of_Capua&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Robert_II_of_Capua&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Template:Citation_needed","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/File:Southern_Italy_1112.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Southern_Italy_1112.svg/350px-Southern_Italy_1112.svg.png","/wiki/File:Southern_Italy_1112.svg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Common_Era","/wiki/Suzerainty","/wiki/Vassalage","/wiki/Aversa","/wiki/Prince_of_Capua","/wiki/Jordan_II_of_Capua","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Lombards","/wiki/Falco_of_Benevento","/wiki/Pope_Honorius_II","/wiki/Benevento","/wiki/Crusade","/wiki/Roger_II_of_Sicily","/wiki/Apulia","/wiki/William_II,_Duke_of_Apulia","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Capua","/wiki/Apulia","#cite_note-3","#cite_note-4","/wiki/Pope_Innocent_II","/wiki/Louis_VI_of_France","/wiki/Henry_I_of_England","/wiki/Lothair_of_Supplinburg","/wiki/Battle_of_Nocera","/wiki/Ranulf_of_Alife","/wiki/Alife","/wiki/Byzantine_empire","/wiki/Sergius_VII_of_Naples","#cite_note-5","/wiki/Alfonso_of_Hauteville","/wiki/Pisa","/wiki/Amalfi","/wiki/Germany","/wiki/Pope_Innocent_II","/wiki/Henry_the_Proud","/wiki/Duke_of_Bavaria","/wiki/Benevento","/wiki/Bari","/wiki/Garigliano","/wiki/Galluccio","#cite_note-6","/wiki/William_I_of_Sicily","/wiki/William_I_of_Sicily","#cite_note-7","/wiki/Pope_Adrian_IV","/wiki/Frederick_I_Barbarossa","#cite_note-8","#cite_note-9","/wiki/Constantinople","/wiki/Byzantine_Emperor","/wiki/Manuel_I_Comnenus","/wiki/Sebastos","/wiki/Roman_Catholic","/wiki/Eastern_Orthodox","/w/index.php?title=Robert_II_of_Capua&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","#cite_ref-2","#cite_ref-3","#cite_ref-4","#cite_ref-5","#cite_ref-6","#cite_ref-7","#cite_ref-8","#cite_ref-9","/wiki/Hugo_Falcandus","/w/index.php?title=Robert_II_of_Capua&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Alexander_of_Telese","/wiki/Jordan_II_of_Capua","/wiki/Aversa","/wiki/William_I_of_Sicily","/wiki/Prince_of_Capua","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Robert_II_of_Capua&oldid=562007151","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1156_deaths","/wiki/Category:Normans","/wiki/Category:Italo-Normans","/wiki/Category:Counts_of_Aversa","/wiki/Category:Princes_of_Capua","/wiki/Category:Articles_needing_additional_references_from_December_2009","/wiki/Category:All_articles_needing_additional_references","/wiki/Category:Use_dmy_dates_from_January_2012","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/wiki/Category:Year_of_birth_unknown","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Robert+II+of+Capua&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Robert+II+of+Capua","/wiki/Robert_II_of_Capua","/wiki/Talk:Robert_II_of_Capua","#","/wiki/Robert_II_of_Capua","/w/index.php?title=Robert_II_of_Capua&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Robert_II_of_Capua&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Robert_II_of_Capua","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Robert_II_of_Capua","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Robert_II_of_Capua&oldid=562007151","/w/index.php?title=Robert_II_of_Capua&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1150295","/w/index.php?tit
