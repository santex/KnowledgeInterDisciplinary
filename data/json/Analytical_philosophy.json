In the United Kingdom, United States, Canada, Scandinavia,\nAustralia, and New Zealand, the vast majority of university philosophy\ndepartments identify themselves as \"analytic\" departments. \"Without exception, the best philosophy departments in the\nUnited States are dominated by analytic philosophy, and among the leading\nphilosophers in the United States, all but a tiny handful would be classified as\nanalytic philosophers. Practitioners of types of philosophizing that are not in\nthe analytic traditionâsuch as phenomenology, classical pragmatism,\nexistentialism, or Marxismâfeel it necessary to define their position in\nrelation to analytic philosophy.\" John Searle (2003) Contemporary Philosophy in\nthe United States in N. Bunnin and E.P. Tsui-James (eds.), The Blackwell\nCompanion to Philosophy, 2nd ed., (Blackwell, 2003), p. 1.\n\nThe term \"analytic philosophy\" can refer to:\n\n* A broad philosophical tradition See, e.g., Avrum Stroll, Twentieth-Century\n  Analytic Philosophy (Columbia University Press, 2000), p. 5: \"[I]t is\n  difficult to give a precise definition of 'analytic philosophy' since it is\n  not so much a specific doctrine as a loose concatenation of approaches to\n  problems.\" Also, see ibid., p. 7: \"I think Sluga is right in saying 'it may be\n  hopeless to try to determine the essence of analytic philosophy.' Nearly every\n  proposed definition has been challenged by some scholar. [...] [W]e are\n  dealing with a family resemblance concept.\" See Hans-Johann Glock,\n  What Is Analytic Philosophy (Cambridge University Press, 2008), p. 205: \"The\n  answer to the title question, then, is that analytic philosophy is a tradition\n  held together both by ties of mutual influence and by family\n  resemblances.\" characterized by an emphasis on clarity and argument\n  (often achieved via modern formal logic and analysis of language) and a\n  respect for the natural sciences. Brian Leiter (2006)\n  webpage [http://www.philosophicalgourmet.com/analytic.asp âAnalyticâ and\n  âContinentalâ Philosophy]. Quote on the definition: \"'Analytic' philosophy\n  today names a style of doing philosophy, not a philosophical program or a set\n  of substantive views. Analytic philosophers, crudely speaking, aim for\n  argumentative clarity and precision; draw freely on the tools of logic; and\n  often identify, professionally and intellectually, more closely with the\n  sciences and mathematics, than with the humanities.\" H. Glock, \"Was\n  Wittgenstein an Analytic Philosopher?\", Metaphilosophy, 35:4 (2004), pp.\n  419â444. Colin McGinn, The Making of a Philosopher: My Journey\n  through Twentieth-Century Philosophy (HarperCollins, 2002), p. xi.:\n  \"analytical philosophy [is] too narrow a label, since [it] is not generally a\n  matter of taking a word or concept and analyzing it (whatever exactly that\n  might be). [...] This tradition emphasizes clarity, rigor, argument, theory,\n  truth. It is not a tradition that aims primarily for inspiration or\n  consolation or ideology. Nor is it particularly concerned with 'philosophy of\n  life,' though parts of it are. This kind of philosophy is more like science\n  than religion, more like mathematics than poetry â though it is neither\n  science nor mathematics.\"\n\n* The more specific set of developments of early 20th-century philosophy that\n  were the historical antecedents of the broad sense: e.g., the work of Bertrand\n  Russell, Ludwig Wittgenstein, G. E. Moore, Gottlob Frege, and logical\n  positivists.\n\nIn this latter, narrower sense, analytic philosophy is identified with specific\nphilosophical commitments (many of which are rejected by contemporary analytic\nphilosophers), such as:\n\n*The logical positivist principle that there are not any specifically\nphilosophical truths and that the object of philosophy is the logical\nclarification of thoughts. This may be contrasted with the traditional\nfoundationalism, which considers philosophy as a special, elite science that\ninvestigates the fundamental reasons and principles of everything. See\nAristotle Metaphysics (Book II 993a), Kenny (1973) p. 230. As a result,\nmany analytic philosophers have considered their inquiries as continuous with,\nor subordinate to, those of the natural sciences. This is an attitude that\nbegins with John Locke, who described his work as that of an \"underlabourer\" to\nthe achievements of natural scientists such as Newton. During the twentieth\ncentury, the most influential advocate of the continuity of philosophy with\nscience was Willard Van Orman Quine: see, e.g., his papers \"Two Dogmas of\nEmpiricism\" and \"Epistemology Naturalized\".\n\n*The principle that the logical clarification of thoughts can only be achieved\nby analysis of the logical form of philosophical propositions. A.P.\nMartinich, \"Introduction,\" in Martinich & D. Sosa (eds.), A Companion to\nAnalytic Philosophy (Blackwell, 2001), p. 1: \"To use a general name for the kind\nof analytic philosophy practiced during the first half of the twentieth century,\n[...] 'conceptual analysis' aims at breaking down complex concepts into their\nsimpler components.\" The logical form of a proposition is a way of\nrepresenting it (often using the formal grammar and symbolism of a logical\nsystem) to display its similarity with all other propositions of the same type.\nHowever, analytic philosophers disagree widely about the correct logical form of\nordinary language. Wittgenstein, op. cit., 4.111\n\n*The rejection of sweeping philosophical systems in favour of attention to\ndetail, Scott Soames, Philosophical Analysis in the Twentieth Century Vol. 1\n(Princeton UP, 2003), p. xv: \"There is, I think, a widespread presumption within\nthe tradition that it is often possible to make philosophical progress by\nintensively investigating a small, circumscribed range of philosophical issues\nwhile holding broader, systematic questions in abeyance. What distinguishes twentieth-\ncentury analytical philosophy from at least some philosophy in other traditions,\nor at other times, is not a categorical rejection of philosophical systems, but\nrather the acceptance of a wealth of smaller, more thorough and more rigorous,\ninvestigations that need not be tied to any overarching philosophical view.\" See\nalso, e.g., \"Philosophical Analysis\" (catalogued under \"Analysis,\nPhilosophical\") in Encyclopedia of Philosophy , Vol. 1 (Macmillan, 1967), esp.\nsections on \"Bertrand Russell\" at p. 97ff, \"G.E. Moore\" at p. 100ff, and\n\"Logical Positivism\" at p. 102ff. or ordinary language. See, e.g., the\nworks of G.E. Moore and J.L. Austin.\n\nAccording to a characteristic paragraph by Bertrand Russell: \n\"Modern analytical empiricism [...] differs from that of Locke, Berkeley, and\nHume by its incorporation of mathematics and its development of a powerful\nlogical technique. It is thus able, in regard to certain problems, to achieve\ndefinite answers, which have the quality of science rather than of philosophy.\nIt has the advantage, as compared with the philosophies of the system-builders,\nof being able to tackle its problems one at a time, instead of having to invent\nat one stroke a block theory of the whole universe. Its methods, in this\nrespect, resemble those of science. I have no doubt that, in so far as\nphilosophical knowledge is possible, it is by such methods that it must be\nsought; I have also no doubt that, by these methods, many ancient problems are\ncompletely soluble.\" A History of Western Philosophy (Simon & Schuster,\n1945), p. 834. \n\nAnalytic philosophy is often understood in contrast to other philosophical\ntraditions, most notably continental philosophy, and also Indian philosophy,\nThomism, and Marxism. A.C. Grayling (ed.), Philosophy 2: Further through the\nSubject (Oxford University Press, 1998), p. 2: \"Analytic philosophy is mainly\nassociated with the contemporary English-speaking world, but it is by no means\nthe only important philosophical tradition. In this volume two other immensely\nrich and important such traditions are introduced: Indian philosophy, and\nphilosophical thought in Europe from the time of Hegel.\" L.J. Cohen, The\nDialogue of Reason: An Analysis of Analytical Philosophy (Oxford University\nPress, 1986), p. 5: \"So, despite a few overlaps, analytical philosophy is not\ndifficult to distinguish broadly [...] from other modern movements, like\nphenomenology, say, or existentialism, or from the large amount of\nphilosophizing that has also gone on in the present century within frameworks\nderiving from other influential thinkers like Aquinas, Hegel, or Marx.\" H.-J.\nGlock, What Is Analytic Philosophy? (Cambridge University Press, 2008), p. 86:\n\"Most non-analytic philosophers of the twentieth century do not belong to\ncontinental philosophy.\"\n","linknr":1192,"url":"Analytical_philosophy","recorded":1362582421,"links":76,"instances":["philosopher","philosopher","philosophy_of_mind","ethics","philosophy","logic","philosopher","philosophy_of_mind","logic","philosopher","journal","philosopher"],"pdf":["http://web.syr.edu/~rnvangul/mirror-mirror.final.pdf","http://www.mit.edu/%7Eyablo/om.pdf"],"categories":["Analytic
