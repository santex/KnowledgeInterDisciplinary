The Brigade was also the\nbeneficiary of Al Qaeda's worldwide network of procurement officers who obtained\nsophisticated equipment including satellite phones, night vision goggles, and\neven airplanes.\n\nReports from [[Time (magazine)|Time]] magazine indicate that members of the 055\nBrigade were often deployed in smaller groups to help reinforce regular Afghan\nmembers of the Taliban. This was often achieved via threats or intimidation\ndesigned to enforce discipline and a commitment to the mujahedin philosophy.\n\nEstimates on the strength of the 055 Brigade vary, however it is generally\nbelieved that at its peak it comprised somewhere between 1,000 and 2,000\npersonnel. The 055 Brigade suffered heavy losses during the 2001 war in\nAfghanistan and many were captured by the United States. Those that survived\nretreated with Osama bin Laden to the Afghanistan-Pakistan border area where\nthey regrouped with the intention of waging a protracted campaign.\n\nAccording to Joint Task Force Guantanamo counter-terrorism analysts the brigade\nwas a unit of foreign fighters in Afghanistan under the command of Osama bin\nLaden. 14 October 2005 {{cite web\n| url=http://www.dod.mil/pubs/foi/detainees/csrt_arb/ARB_Round_1_Factors_000197-\n| 000294.pdf#53 title=Unclassified Summary of Evidence for Administrative Review\n| Board in the case of date=14 October 2005 author=OARDEC pages=pages 53â55\n| publisher=United States Department of Defense accessdate=14 December 2007\n| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071214105656/http://www.dod.mil/pubs-\n| /foi/detainees/csrt_arb/ARB_Round_1_Factors_000197-000294.pdf| archivedate= 14\n| December 2007 }}\n{{cite news\n| url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/opinions/2001/11/14/2001-11-\n| 14_other_islamic_dictators_will.html title=Other Islamic dictators will fold\n| like Taliban publisher=New York Daily News author=Zev Chafets date= 14\n| November 2001 accessdate=14 December 2007\n}} JTF-GTMO analysts said that, under bin Laden's command, the 55th Arab\nBrigade was integrated into the Taliban's military.

He was given a Kalashnikov with four magazines and two\n  hand grenades. The detainee then was sent to a bunker facing the Northern\n  Alliance in a position called the Bilal Position.\n* The Bilal unit is part of the 55th Arab Brigade.\n* The al Qaida Force, or 55th Arab Brigade, is Usama bin Laden's primary\n  formation supporting Taliban objectives. Information indicates that the\n  ideology of those in the 55th Arab Brigade includes willingness to give their\n  lives for tactical objectives as declared by Usama bin Laden and the Taliban.\n\nAccording to the 2005 \"Warlords Rising: Confronting Violent Non-State\nActors\" the 55th Arab Brigade was a mechanized unit. {{cite book\n| url=http://books.google.com/books?id=sgkIZDGtD1IC&pg=PA172&lpg=PA172&dq=%2255-\n| th+arab+brigade%22&source=web&ots=YiEDUq65fv&sig=oERedPaWrrzApVY3Fnsz0Of-hZ4\n| title=Warlords Rising: Confronting Violent Non-State Actors page=page 172\n| publisher=Google books author=Troy S.
