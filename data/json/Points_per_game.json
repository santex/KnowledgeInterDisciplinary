{"cursor":"2108","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Points per game', often abbreviated 'PPG', is the average number of points\nscored by a player per game played in a sport, over the course of a series of\ngames, a whole season, or a career. It is calculated by dividing the total\nnumber of points by number of games. The terminology is often used in basketball\nand hockey. For description of sports points see goals for hockey or points for\nbasketball.\n\nIn games divided into fixed time periods, especially those in which a player may\nexit and re-enter the game multiple or an unlimited number of times, a player\nmay receive the same credit (in this context, a liability) for participation in\na game regardless of how long (i.e., for what portion of the game clock's\nelapsing) s/he was actually on the field or court. For this reason, the points-per-\ngame statistic may understate the contribution of players who are highly\neffective but used only in certain specific \"pinch\" or \"clutch\" scenarios, such\nthat a points-per-unit-time figure (e.g., \"points per 48 minutes\" in the case of\nprofessional basketball) may better represent their effectiveness within the\ncontext in which a coach or manager plays them. Although the points-per-game\nstatistic has the advantage of factoring in the breadth of scenarios in which\nthe player is effective, in that a player effective in many different scenarios\nwill play more minutes per game and therefore contribute more to the team's\noverall performance, it still fails to distinguish between an ineffective\nplayer, an effective \"pinch\"/\"clutch\" offensive player, and a player assuming a\nprimarily defensive role in a position whose title does not necessarily make the\nnature of his/her role obvious (e.g., basketball forward and star rebounder\nDennis Rodman).\n","linknr":134,"url":"Points_per_game","recorded":1375078837,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Points_per_game&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Points_per_game&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Points_per_game&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/Average","/wiki/Season_(sport)","/wiki/Basketball","/wiki/Hockey","/wiki/Goal_(sport)","/wiki/Point_(basketball)","/wiki/Substitution_(sport)","/wiki/Forward_(basketball)","/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)","/wiki/Dennis_Rodman","/wiki/Template:Basketball_statistics","/wiki/Template_talk:Basketball_statistics","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Basketball_statistics&action=edit","/wiki/Basketball_statistics","/wiki/Games_played","/wiki/Starting_lineup","/wiki/Minute_(basketball)","/wiki/Point_(basketball)","/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)","/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)","/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)","/wiki/Assist_(basketball)","/wiki/Steal_(basketball)","/wiki/Block_(basketball)","/wiki/Foul_(basketball)","/wiki/Turnover_(basketball)","/wiki/Field_goal_(basketball)","/wiki/Three-point_field_goal","/wiki/Free_throw","/wiki/Field_goal_(basketball)","/wiki/Three-point_field_goal","/wiki/Free_throw","/wiki/Field_goal_percentage","/wiki/Three-point_field_goal","/wiki/Free_throw","/wiki/Double_(basketball)","/wiki/Double_(basketball)#Double-double","/wiki/Double_(basketball)#Triple-double","/wiki/Double_(basketball)#Quadruple-double","/wiki/Double_(basketball)#Quintuple-double","/wiki/Double_(basketball)#Five-by-five","/wiki/Offense_efficiency_rating","/wiki/Player_efficiency_rating","/wiki/Offensive_rating","/wiki/Defensive_rating","/wiki/True_shooting_percentage","/wiki/Rebound_rate","/wiki/Performance_Index_Rating","/wiki/Efficiency_(basketball)","/wiki/File:Basketball_stub.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Basketball_stub.svg/35px-Basketball_stub.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Points_per_game&action=edit","/wiki/Template:Basketball-stub","/wiki/Template_talk:Basketball-stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Basketball-stub&action=edit","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Points_per_game&oldid=453216773","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Basketball_terminology","/wiki/Category:Basketball_statistics","/wiki/Category:Basketball_stubs","/wiki/Category:Articles_lacking_sources_from_December_2009","/wiki/Category:All_articles_lacking_sources","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Points+per+game&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Points+per+game","/wiki/Points_per_game","/wiki/Talk:Points_per_game","#","/wiki/Points_per_game","/w/index.php?title=Points_per_game&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Points_per_game&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Points_per_game","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Points_per_game","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Points_per_game&oldid=453216773","/w/index.php?title=Points_per_game&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7208402","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Points_per_game&id=453216773","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Points+per+game","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Points+per+game&oldid=453216773&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Points_per_game&printable=yes","#","//www.wiki
