{"cursor":"26242","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nAn 'intron' is any nucleotide sequence within a gene that is removed by RNA\nsplicing while the final mature RNA product of a gene is being generated. The term intron refers to both\nthe DNA sequence within a gene and the corresponding sequence in RNA\ntranscripts. Sequences that are joined together in the final mature\nRNA after RNA splicing are exons. Introns are found in the genes of most\norganisms and many viruses, and can be located in a wide range of genes,\nincluding those that generate proteins, ribosomal RNA (rRNA), and transfer RNA\n(tRNA). When proteins are generated from intron-containing genes, RNA splicing\ntakes place as part of the RNA processing pathway that follows transcription and\nprecedes translation.\n\nThe word intron is derived from the term intragenic region; i.e., a region\ninside a gene. Although introns are sometimes called intervening sequences, the\nterm \"intervening sequence\" can refer to any of several families of internal\nnucleic acid sequences that are not present in the final gene product, including\ninteins, untranslated sequences (UTR), and nucleotides removed by RNA editing,\nin addition to introns.\n","linknr":442,"url":"Introns","recorded":1362684584,"links":48,"instances":["biology","genetics","journal"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Gene expression","DNA","Spliceosome","RNA splicing"],"headings":["Simple illustration of an intron and RNA splicing","Introduction","Classification","Biological functions and evolution","Introns As Mobile Genetic Elements","References","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/07/Gene.png/270px-Gene.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Pre-mRNA_to_mRNA.svg/420px-Pre-mRNA_to_mRNA.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["transcription","genetics"],["translation","biology"],["nature","journal"]],"members":["translation","transcription","nature"],"related":["Gene","RNA_splicing","Exon","Protein","Ribosomal_RNA","Transfer_RNA","RNA_processing","Transcription_(genetics)","Translation_(biology)","Inteins","Untranslated_region","RNA_editing","Groucho_Marx","Adenovirus","Interrupted_gene","Phillip_Allen_Sharp","Richard_J._Roberts","Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_or_Medicine","Biochemistry","Walter_Gilbert","Nature_(journal)","Baker's_yeast","Mitochondrial_DNA","Spliceosome","Group_I_catalytic_intron","Ribozyme","Group_II_intron","Ribozyme","Group_III_intron","Messenger_RNA","Transfer_RNA","Ribosomal_RNA","Nucleic_acid_tertiary_structure","Noncoding_RNA","Alternative_splicing","Mobile_genetic_elements","Selfish_DNA","Spliceosome","RNA_world","Eukaryotic","Genomes","Encephalitozoon_cuniculi","Common_descent","Alternative_splicing","Spliceosome","Intron_Mediated_Enhancement","Exon","MRNA","Eukaryotic_chromosome_fine_structure","Small_t_intron","Alternative_splicing","Minor_spliceosome","MicroRNA","Intein","Interrupted_gene","Noncoding_DNA","Noncoding_RNA","Selfish_DNA","Twintron"]}
