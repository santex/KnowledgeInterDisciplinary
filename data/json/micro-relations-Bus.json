{"cursor":"31686","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n double-decker bus, running route 102 on the London Buses network.]] articulated\n bus in Chiba, Japan.]] in Kuala Lumpur.]]\n\nA 'bus' (; plural \"buses\", , archaically also 'omnibus', 'multibus', or\n'autobus') is a road vehicle designed to carry passengers. Buses can have a\ncapacity as high as 300 passengers. The most common\ntype of bus is the single-decker rigid bus, with larger loads carried by double-\ndecker buses and articulated buses, and smaller loads carried by midibuses and\nminibuses; coaches are used for longer distance services. Bus manufacturing is\nincreasingly globalised, with the same design appearing around the world.\n\nBuses may be used for scheduled bus transport, scheduled coach transport, school\ntransport, private hire, tourism; promotional buses may be used for political\ncampaigns and others are privately operated for a wide range of purposes.\n\nHorse drawn buses were used from the 1820s, followed by steam buses in the\n1830s, and electric trolleybuses in 1882. The first buses powered by internal\ncombustion engines were used in 1895 and this is still the most common power\nsource. Recently there has been growing interest in hybrid electric buses, fuel\ncell buses, electric buses as well as ones powered by compressed natural gas or\nbio-diesel.\n","linknr":823,"url":"Bus","recorded":1362688824,"links":121,"instances":["vehicle","music","vehicle","public_transport","marketing","morphology","competition","fashion","place","truck","airport","disambiguation","sports"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Buses|","Cab
