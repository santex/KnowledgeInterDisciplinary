Slide rules manufactured for specialized\nfields such as aviation or finance typically feature additional scales that aid\nin calculations common to that field.\n\nWilliam Oughtred and others developed the slide rule in the 17th century based\non the emerging work on logarithms by John Napier. Before the advent of the\npocket calculator, it was the most commonly used calculation tool in science and\nengineering.
