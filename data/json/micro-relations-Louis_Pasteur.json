He is remembered for his remarkable breakthroughs in the causes\nand preventions of diseases. His discoveries reduced mortality from puerperal\nfever, and he created the first vaccines for rabies and anthrax. His experiments\nsupported the germ theory of disease. He was best known to the general public\nfor inventing a method to treat milk and wine in order to prevent it from\ncausing sickness, a process that came to be called pasteurization. He is\nregarded as one of the three main founders of microbiology, together with\nFerdinand Cohn and Robert Koch.\n\nPasteur also made many discoveries in the field of chemistry, most notably the\nmolecular basis for the asymmetry of certain crystals. His body lies beneath the Institute Pasteur in Paris in a spectacular\nvault covered in depictions of his accomplishments in Byzantine\nmosaics.\n","linknr":719,"url":"Louis_Pasteur","recorded":1362505871,"links":144,"instances":["département","sculpture","fermentation","tomb","food","chemistry","academia"],"pdf":["http://192.129.24.144/licensed_materials/00897/papers/0003006/36kau897.pdf","http://crystal.flack.ch/sh5092.pdf"],"categories":["1822
