In the\noriginal design it was made with 11 flat wooden boards, with a straight back and\nseat. It also features wide armrests. In Canada it is known as the Muskoka\nchair, from the eponymous Ontario district. {{cite web\n | url = http://www.mynewwaterfronthome.com/adirondackmuskoka.aspx title =\n | Adirondack or Muskoka chairs, what's the difference first = Gary | last = May\n}}\n\nThe precursor to today's Adirondack chair was designed by Thomas Lee in 1903. He\nwas on vacation in Westport, New York, in the Adirondack Mountains, and needed\noutdoor chairs for his summer home. He tested the first designs on his family.\nAfter arriving at a final design for the \"Westport plank chair,\" Lee offered it\nto Harry Bunnell, a carpenter friend in Westport, who was in need of a winter\nincome. Bunnell quickly realized the chair was the perfect item to sell to\nWestport's summer residents, and apparently without asking Lee's permission,\nBunnell filed for and received patent 794,777 in\n1905. [http://www.google.com/patents?id=jsVNAAAAEBAJ&dq=794777 Harry C\nBunnell patent no.794,777] Bunnell manufactured his plank chairs for the\nnext twenty years. His \"Westport chairs\" were all signed and made of hemlock in\ngreen or medium dark brown.\n\nToday's Adirondack chairs usually feature a rounded back and contoured seat. The\nfounder of this style seems to be Irving Wolpin who designed his chair as early\nas 1938 and filed for and received patent 109239. [http://www.google.com/pa-\ntents/USD109239?printsec=drawing&hl=nl#v=onepage&q&f=false=109239 Irving Wolpin\npatent no.109,239] The style has also been translated to other pieces of\nfurniture, from gliders to love seats and tÃªte-Ã -tÃªte's. Some modern Adirondack\nchairs are made out of plastic lumber or engineered wood instead of wood.\n\nWhen made of wood a variety of types of wood are used. Each type reflects the\nlongevity of the Adirondack chair http://www.thebestadirondackchair.com/comparisons-\n26.aspx\n\nPine is fine for short term but is not termite resistant and is prone to water\ndamage, mildew and rotting. To make pine last longer be sure to put a good\nfinish on it including a primer and high UV rating top coat. Pine can last\nlonger than a few years but it requires regular maintenance. This is a cheap\nwood available anywhere and is most often used in third world made products.\nWatch out for pressure treated pine as the chemicals used in pressure treating\ncan be harmful to your health.{Citation needed}\n\nCedar is the best softwood for longevity as it is naturally impervious to rot\nand the cedar oils deter insects. Cedar is the choice wood for decks,\nboardwalks, and such due to its high durability and easy availability in North\nAmerica as it is a native wood there. Marks and blemishes can be easily sanded\naway and cedar can last many generations. If left unfinished it will eventually\nturn to a soft silvery grey and in a decade small fissures will show up in the\nwood surface but they do not compromise the strength or life of the wood. There\nare many species of cedar but the longest lasting of them is western red cedar.\n\nTeak is a very heavy hardwood that can last for generations. Its density creates\nthe heavy weight to this wood and like cedar it is naturally impervious to\ntermites. Teak is imported and not a native wood to North America and with its\nheavy weight and high demand it is incredibly expensive (up to 3 times the price\nof products made of cedar, and up to 6 times the price of products made of\npine). Teak is difficult to care for as it does not take a stain well.\n\nAdirondack chairs are becoming popular as outdoor seating at cafÃ©s because the\nflat armrests are suitable for setting food and beverages on, making it possible\nto provide individual seating without tables.\n\nThey are commonly made as school projects around the world.\n\n'Adirondacking' is a term used in the southern U.S. to describe public picnics\nat which people sit primarily in Adirondack chairs. It is also used to describe\nusing public Adirondack-chair displays outside home-improvement and grocery\nstores as a leisure break while shopping.\n","linknr":133,"url":"Adirondack_chair","recorded":1375087018,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Adirondack_chair&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Adirondack_chair&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Adirondack_chair&action=edit","/wiki/Talk:Adirondack_chair","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_style_guidelines","/wiki/Wikipedia:NPOV","/wiki/Wikipedia:Encyclopedic_style","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Adirondack_chair&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Template:Citation_needed","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/File:Adirondack_chair.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/bc/Adirondack_chair.jpg/200px-Adirondack_chair.jpg","/wiki/File:Adirondack_chair.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Canada","/wiki/Muskoka","/wiki/Eponymous","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Westport,_New_York","/wiki/New_York","/wiki/Adirondack_Mountains","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Tsuga_canadensis","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Swing_(seat)","/wiki/Love_seat","/wiki/Engineered_wood","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","#cite_note-4","/wiki/Cedar_oil","/wiki/Caf%C3%A9","/wiki/Food","/wiki/Beverage","/wiki/Table_(furniture)","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/w/index.php?title=Adirondack_chair&action=edit&section=1","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Adirondack_chair","//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Muskoka_chair","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Adirondack_chairs","/wiki/List_of_chairs","/w/index.php?title=Adirondack_chair&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-1","http://www.mynewwaterfronthome.com/adirondackmuskoka.aspx","#cite_ref-2","http://www.google.com/patents?id=jsVNAAAAEBAJ&dq=794777","#cite_ref-3","http://www.google.com/patents/USD109239?printsec=drawing&hl=nl#v=onepage&q&f=false=109239","#cite_ref-4","http://www.thebestadirondackchair.com/comparisons-26.aspx","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Adirondack_chair&oldid=566034229","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Chairs","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_needing_style_editing_from_July_2013","/wiki/Category:All_articles_needing_style_editing","/wiki/Category:Articles_needing_additional_references_from_July_2013","/wiki/Category:All_articles_needing_additional_references","/wiki/Category:All_articles_with_unsourced_statements","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_unsourced_statements_from_December_2012","/wiki/Category:Commons_category_with_local_link_same_as_on_Wikidata","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Adirondack+chair&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Adirondack+chair","/wiki/Adirondack_chair","/wiki/Talk:Adirondack_chair","#","/wiki/Adirondack_chair","/w/index.php?title=Adirondack_chair&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Adirondack_chair&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Adirondack_chair","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Adirondack_chair","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Adirondack_chair&oldid=566034229","/w/index.php?t
