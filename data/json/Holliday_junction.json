The\nstructure is named after Robin Holliday, who proposed it in 1964 to\naccount for a particular type of exchange of genetic information he observed in\nyeast known as homologous recombination. Holliday junctions are highly conserved\nstructures, from prokaryotes to mammals.\n\nBecause these junctions are between homologous sequences, they can slide up and\ndown the DNA. In bacteria, this sliding (or branch migration) is facilitated by\nthe RuvABC complex or RecG protein, molecular motors that use the energy of ATP\nhydrolysis to push the junction around. The junction must then be resolved,\nsplit up, to restore 2 linear duplexes. This can be done to either restore the\nparental configuration or to establish a crossed over configuration. Resolution\ncan occur in either a horizontal or vertical fashion during homologous\nrecombination, giving patch products (if in same orientation during double\nstrand break repair) or splice products (if in different orientations during\ndouble strand break repair).\n\nHolliday junctions are an intermediate in genetic recombination which are also\nof importance in maintaining genomic integrity.\n","linknr":161,"url":"Holliday_junction","recorded":1362508214,"links":22,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Molecular genetics","DNA"],"headings":["Details","Double Holliday Junction","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/83/Holliday_Junction.svg/200px-Holliday_Junction.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/92/Holliday_junction_coloured.png/200px-Holliday_junction_coloured.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["DNA","Robin_Holliday","Yeast","Homologous_recombination","Conserved_sequence","Prokaryote","Mammal","Bacteria","Branch_migration","RuvABC","RecG","Adenosine_triphosphate","Heteroduplex","Genetic_recombination"]}
