The law of\nbiogenesis, attributed to Louis Pasteur, is the observation that living things\ncome only from other living things, by reproduction (e.g. a spider lays eggs,\nwhich develop into spiders). That is, life does not arise from non-living\nmaterial, which was the position held by spontaneous\ngeneration. [http://biotech.law.lsu.edu/cphl/history/articles/pasteur.htm\nPasteur's Papers on the Germ Theory] This is summarized in the\nphrase Omne vivum ex vivo, Latin for \"all life [is] from life.\" A related\nstatement is Omnis cellula e cellula, \"all cells [are] from cells;\" this\nobservation is one of the central statements of cell theory.\n\nThe term biogenesis was coined by Henry Charlton Bastian to mean the generation\nof a life form from nonliving materials, however, Thomas Henry Huxley chose the\nterm abiogenesis and redefined biogenesis for life arising from preexisting\nlife. The generation of life from non-living material is called\nabiogenesis, and is hypothesized to have occurred at least once in the history\nof the Earth, or in the history of the Universe\n(see panspermia), when life first arose.\n\nThe term biogenesis may also refer to biochemical processes of production in\nliving organisms (see biosynthesis).\n","linknr":172,"url":"Biogenesis","recorded":1362505479,"links":30,"instances":["mythology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Origin of life","Biology theories","History of biology"],"headings":["Spontaneous generation and its disproof","See also","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["gaia","mythology"]],"members":["gaia"],"related":["Organism","Organelle","Louis_Pasteur","Life","Reproduction","Spider","Spontaneous_generation","Cell_theory","Henry_Charlton_Bastian","Thomas_Henry_Huxley","Abiogenesis","History_of_the_Earth","History_of_the_Universe","Panspermia","Biosynthesis","Gaia_(mythology)","Aristotle","Francesco_Redi","Abiogenesis","Franz_Schulze","Theodor_Schwann","John_Needham","Lazzaro_Spallanzani","Theodor_von_Dusch","Hermann_von_Helmholtz","Louis_Pasteur","Orthogenesis"]}
