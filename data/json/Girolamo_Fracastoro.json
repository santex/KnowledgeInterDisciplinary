Fracastoro subscribed to the\nphilosophy of atomism, and rejected appeals to hidden causes in scientific\ninvestigation.\n\nBorn of an ancient family in Verona, Republic of Venice and educated at Padua\nwhere at 19 he was appointed professor at the University. On account of his\neminence in the practice of medicine, he was elected physician of the Council of\nTrent. A bronze statue was erected in his honor by the citizens of Padua, while\nhis native city commemorated their great compatriot by a marble statue. He lived\nand practised in his hometown. In 1546 he proposed that epidemic diseases are\ncaused by transferable tiny particles or \"spores\" that could transmit infection\nby direct or indirect contact or even without contact over long distances. In\nhis writing, the \"spores\" of diseases may refer to chemicals rather than to any\nliving entities.\n\n\"I call fomites [from the Latin fomes, meaning \"tinder\"] such things as clothes,\nlinen, etc., which although not themselves corrupt, can nevertheless foster the\nessential seeds of the contagion and thus cause infection.\" On Contagion,\nContagious Diseases and Their Cure (1546) by Girolamo Fracastoro (1478-\n1553)\n\nHis theory remained influential for nearly three centuries, before being\ndisplaced by germ theory. http://www2.bartleby.com/65/fr/Fracasto.html The\nColumbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition. 2001-05.\n\nThe name for syphilis is derived from Fracastoro's 1530 epic poem in three\nbooks, Syphilis sive morbus gallicus (\"Syphilis or The French Disease\"), about a\nshepherd boy named Syphilus who insulted the sun god of Haiti and was punished\nby that god with a horrible disease. The poem suggests using mercury and\n\"guaiaco\" as a cure. His 1546 book (De contagione -- \"On Contagion\") also gave\nthe first description for typhus. The collected works of Fracastoro appeared for\nthe first time in 1555.\n\n\n\nA recently authenticated portrait in the National Gallery has been determined to\nbe that of Fracastoro and painted by the renowned Italian painter\nTitian.\n","linknr":191,"url":"Girolamo_Fracastoro","recorded":1362505823,"links":38,"instances":["crater"],"pdf":[],"categories":["1478 births","1553 deaths","People from Verona","Italian poets","15th-century Italian people","16th-century Italian physicians","Italian Renaissance writers"],"headings":["Fracastoro's landmarks in Verona","Fracastoro's landmarks on the [[Moon]]","Geology","Works","Notes","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a1/Fracastoro.jpg/220px-Fracastoro.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/72/Titian_Girolamo_Fracastoro.jpg/220px-Titian_Girolamo_Fracastoro.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/45/Girolamo_Fracastoro%27s_statue_in_Verona_1.JPG/90px-Girolamo_Fracastoro%27s_statue_in_Verona_1.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/94/Girolamo_Fracastoro%27s_statue_in_Verona_4.JPG/90px-Girolamo_Fracastoro%27s_statue_in_Verona_4.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/62/PD-icon.svg/12px-PD-icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["fracastorius","crater"]],"members":["fracastorius"],"related":["Italian_people","Physician","Poet","Scholar","Mathematics","Geography","Astronomy","Atomism","Verona","Republic_of_Venice","Padua","Professor","University_of_Padua","Council_of_Trent","Infectious_diseases","Infection","Germ_theory","Syphilis","Haiti","Oil_of_guaiac","Typhus","National_Gallery","Titian","Fracastorius_(crater)","Flood_myth"]}
