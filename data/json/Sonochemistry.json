The chemical\neffects of ultrasound do not come from a direct interaction with molecular\nspecies. Studies have shown that no direct coupling of the acoustic field with\nchemical species on a molecular level can account for sonochemistry Suslick,\nK. S. \"Sonochemistry,\" Science 1990, 247, 1439â1445. or\nsonoluminescence. Suslick, K. S.; Flannigan, D. J. âInside a Collapsing\nBubble, Sonoluminescence and Conditions during Cavitationâ Annual Rev. Phys.\nChem. 2008, 59, 659â683. Instead, sonochemistry arises from acoustic\ncavitation: the formation, growth, and implosive collapse of bubbles in a\nliquid. Suslick, Kenneth S. (February 1989). The Chemical\nEffects of Ultrasound. Scientific American. pp.62â68 (p.62) This is\ndemonstrated in phenomena such as ultrasound, sonication, sonoluminescence, and\nsonic cavitation.\n\nThe influence of sonic waves traveling through liquids was first reported by\nRobert Williams Wood (1868â1955) and Alfred Lee Loomis (1887â1975) in 1927. The\nexperiment was about the amount of Hz that it took for sonic waves to\n\"penetrate\" the barrier of water. He came to the conclusion that sound does\ntravel faster in water, but because of the water's density compared to our\nearth's atmosphere it was incredibly hard to get the sonic waves into the water.\nAfter lots of research they decided that the best way to disperse sound in to\nthe water was to make loud noises in to the water by creating bubbles that were\nmade at the same time as the sound. One of the easier ways that they put sound\ninto the water was they simply yelled. But another road block they ran into was\nthe ratio of the amount of time it took for the lower Hz waves to penetrate the\nbubbles walls and access the water around the bubble, and then time from that\npoint to the point on the other end of the body of water. But despite the\nrevolutionary ideas of this article it was left mostly unnoticed. Wood,\nR.W.; Loomis, A.L. The Physical and Biological Effects of High Frequency Sound\nWaves of Great Intensity. Philos. Mag. 1927, 4, 414. Sonochemistry\nexperienced a renaissance in the 1980s with the advent of inexpensive and\nreliable generators of high-intensity ultrasound.\n\nUpon irradiation with high intensity sound or ultrasound, acoustic cavitation\nusually occurs. Cavitation â the formation, growth, and implosive collapse of\nbubbles irradiated with sound â is the impetus for sonochemistry and\nsonoluminescence. Leighton, T.G. The Acoustic Bubble; Academic Press: London, 1994,\npp.531â555. Bubble collapse in liquids produces enormous amounts of energy\nfrom the conversion of kinetic energy of the liquid motion into heating the\ncontents of the bubble. The compression of the bubbles during cavitation is more\nrapid than thermal transport, which generates a short-lived localized hot-spot.\nExperimental results have shown that these bubbles have temperatures around 5000\nK, pressures of roughly 1000 atm, and heating and cooling rates above\n10 10 K/s. Suslick, K.S.; Hammerton, D.A.; Cline, R.E., Jr. J. Am.\nChem. Soc. 1986, 108, 5641. Flint, E.B.; Suslick, K.S. Science. 1991,\n253, 1397. These cavitations can create extreme physical and chemical\nconditions in otherwise cold liquids.\n\nWith liquids containing solids, similar phenomena may occur with exposure to\nultrasound. Once cavitation occurs near an extended solid surface, cavity\ncollapse is nonspherical and drives high-speed jets of liquid to the\nsurface. These\njets and associated shock waves can damage the now highly heated surface. Liquid-\npowder suspensions produce high velocity interparticle collisions. These\ncollisions can change the surface morphology, composition, and\nreactivity. Suslick, K.S.; Doktycz, S.J. Adv. Sonochem. 1990, 1,\n197â230.\n\nThree classes of sonochemical reactions exist: homogeneous sonochemistry of\nliquids, heterogeneous sonochemistry of liquid-liquid or solidâliquid systems,\nand, overlapping with the aforementioned, sonocatalysis. Einhorn, C.;\nEinhorn, J. Luche, J.L. Synthesis 1989, 787. Luche, J.L.; Compets.\nRendus. Serie. IIB 1996, 323, 203, 307. Pestman, J.M.; Engberts,\nJ.B.F.N.; de Jong, F. Jong. Recl. Trav. Chim. Pays-Bas. 1994, 113, 533.\nSonoluminescence is typically regarded as a special case of homogeneous\nsonochemistry. Crum, L.A. Physics Today 1994, 47, 22. Putterman,\nS.J. Sci. Am. February 1995, p. 46. The chemical enhancement of reactions\nby ultrasound has been explored and has beneficial applications in mixed phase\nsynthesis, materials chemistry, and biomedical uses. Because cavitation can only\noccur in liquids, chemical reactions are not seen in the ultrasonic irradiation\nof solids or solidâgas systems.\n\nFor example, in chemical kinetics, it has been observed that ultrasound can\ngreatly enhance chemical reactivity in a number of systems by as much as a\nmillion-fold; Suslick, K.S.; Casadonte, D.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1987, 109,\n3459. effectively acting as a catalyst by exciting the atomic and\nmolecular modes of the system (such as the vibrational, rotational, and\ntranslational modes). In addition, in reactions that use solids, ultrasound\nbreaks up the solid pieces from the energy released from the bubbles created\nby cavitation collapsing through them. This gives the solid reactant a larger\nsurface area for the reaction to proceed over, increasing the observed rate\nof reaction.\n\nWhile the application of ultrasound often generates mixtures of products, a\npaper published in 2007 in the journal [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] described the\nuse of ultrasound to selectively effect a certain cyclobutane ring-opening\nreaction. Atul Kumar, has reported multicomponent reaction Hantzsch\nester synthesis in Aqueous Micelles using ultrasound. Atul Kumar, R.A.Muarya\nSYNLETT 1987, 109, 3459.http://www.organic-\nchemistry.org/abstracts/lit2/076.shtm\n\nSome water pollutants, especially chlorinated organic compounds, can be\ndestroyed sonochemically.

Water 2(1), 28â74. http://www.mdpi.com/2073-\n4441/2/1/28/\n\nSonochemistry can be performed by using a bath (usually used for ultrasonic\ncleaning) or with a high power probe, called an ultrasonic
