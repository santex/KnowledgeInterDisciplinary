He works in the Manufacturing Systems Integration\nDivision, which performs research on software integration methods, creating\ncustom software that implements draft standards and serves as an interface to\nother components provided by separate vendors.\n\nLibes is responsible for numerous implementations of STEP, a family of ISO\nstandards and draft standards for product management. He\nis the creator of the NIST Identifier Collaboration Service, a free service to\nallow collaborative management of unmanaged namespaces. Libes is also\nresponsible for one of the earliest network-shared memory ports on UNIX and the\nfirst port of XINU on UNIX.\n\nLibes's book Obfuscated C Code and Other Mysteries\nexplains the winning entries in the Obfuscated C Code Contest, as an\neducational tool.\n\nLibes is best known for Expect, which is public domain software for automating\nand testing interactive applications such as telnet, ftp, passwd and hundreds of\nother programs that have no internal control language (or\ntoo limited of a control language) of their own. Libes also developed Expectk,\nwhich glues Expect to Tk thereby allowing a character-graphic or line-oriented\nprogram to be entirely hidden with a modern graphical user interface.\n","linknr":120,"url":"Don_Libes","recorded":1362561112,"links":13,"instances":["command","framework"],"pdf":[],"categories":["American computer scientists","Computer systems researchers","Living people"],"headings":["Publications","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3c/Don-libes_1.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["passwd","command"],["tk","framework"]],"members":["passwd","tk"],"related":["NIST","Expect","ISO_10303","Computer_scientist","NIST","ISO_10303","International_Organization_for_Standardization","XINU","International_Obfuscated_C_Code_Contest","Expect","Public_domain_software","Telnet","Ftp","Passwd_(command)","Tk_(framework)"]}
