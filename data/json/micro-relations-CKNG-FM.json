The\nstation plays an Hot AC format branded as 'Fresh FM'.\n\nSince Corus's other adult hits station in Kitchener, Ontario flipped to\nmainstream rock, CKNG-FM was the only adult hits station owned by Corus until\n2011, when CHAY-FM flipped from adult contemporary to adult hits.\n\nCKNG is owned by Corus Entertainment and has previously been known as 'Power\n92', when they had the popular \"phrase that pays\" of \"Power 92 plays today's\nbest music, now show me my money!\" Power 92 was the top listened-to FM station\nin Edmonton during its existence. When Corus bought CKNG, they rebranded the\nstation. With the rebranding, it was changed to simply \"I listen to Joe\".\n\nCKNG was the ninth most listened to radio station in the Edmonton market in the\nfall of 2008 but as of fall 2012, the station is ranked twelfth with\na 3.3 percent share.\n","linknr":296,"url":"CKNG-FM","recorded":1362675669,"links":24,"instances":["band","am"],"pdf":["http://web.archive.org/web/20081202235830/http://www.bbm.ca/en/BBM_Canada_S4_2008_Top-line_Radio_Report_final.pdf","http://www.bbm.ca/en/BBM_Canada_S4_2008_Top-line_Radio_Report_final.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20081202235830/http://www.bbm.ca/en/BBM_Canada_S4_2008_Top-line_Radio_Report_final.pdf","http://www.bbm.ca/_documents/radio_market_ratings/december_6_2012/RD_ME_Topline_Radio_Report_Edmonton_06-12-2012.pdf","http://www.bbm.ca/_documents/radio_market_ratings/december_6_2012/RD_ME_Topline_Radio_Report_Edmonton_06-12-2012.pdf"],"categories":["Radio stations in Edmonton|Kng","Corus Entertainment radio stations|Kng","Hot adult contemporary radio stations in Canada|Kng"],"headings":["History","Current on-air staff","Other on-air staff","Former on-air staff","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e1/925_Fresh_FM.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/29/92.5_Joe_FM_Logo.svg/150px-92.5_Joe_FM_Logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/Edmonton_Downtown_Skyline_daytime_new.jpg/32px-Edmonton_Downtown_Skyline_daytime_new.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1d/Radio_icon.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f5/Flag_of_Alberta.svg/35px-Flag_of_Alberta.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["ched","am"],["snap","band"]],"members":["snap","ched"],"related":["MHz","FM_radio","Edmonton","Alberta","Hot_Adult_Contemporary","Corus_Entertainment","CHED_(AM)","CHQT","CISN-FM","Watt","FM_radio","Radio_station","Edmonton","Alberta","Hot_Adult_Contemporary","CJDV-FM","Kitchener,_Ontario","Mainstream_rock","2011_in_radio","CHAY-FM","Adult_contemporary","Adult_hits","Corus_Entertainment","Jerry_Maguire","1991_in_radio","Contemporary_hit_radio","Snap_(band)","2003_in_radio","Hot_adult_contemporary","Adult_hits","CHQT","Hot_adult_contemporary","Daintre_Christensen","CITV-DT","Jackie_Jeffrey","Jacqueline_Greenly","Shaw_TV_Edmonton","Maureen_Holloway","C.R._Nichols","Ceara_K","CHBE-FM","Audie_Lynds","CKRA-FM","CKEA-FM","Bob_FM","CJDV-FM","Doug_FM","Hank_FM","Jack_FM","Sam_FM","Canadian_Communications_Foundation"]}
