The coat of\narms of the Cavenagh family can still be seen atop the signage at both ends of\nthe bridge.\n\nHe was the third son of James Gordon Cavenagh and Ann nÃ©e Coates. He married\nElizabeth Marshall Moriarty on 7 Sept 1842 at Dinapore, India and died in 1891\nleaving two sons.\n\nCavenagh trained at Addiscombe Military Seminary, the military academy of the\nBritish East India Company. He passed his examination in June 1837 and early in\n1838 joined the 32nd Regt. N.I. In 1840 he passed the prescribed examination at\nthe College of Fort William. He was appointed as Interpreter and Quartermaster\nto the 41st Regt. N.I. He was attached to the Force employed in watching the\nNepaul frontier 1840/41. Letter of January 20,\n1868 to R Bain, Adjutant General Bengal Staff Corps in \n\nHe was an Adjutant of the 4th Irregular Cavalry (Skinner's Horse) and in\nDecember 1843 was badly wounded in the Battle of Maharajpore. His leg was\nsevered just above the ankle by a round shot and his horse was killed under him.\nHe was wounded again in January 1846 during the Sikh campaign when he was struck\nin the left arm by a ricochetting round shot.

The Governor of the Settlements and his council were\nanswerable to the Governor-General of India in Calcutta. The Governor had little\nformal power, but was able to influence the Calcutta authorities who relied\nlargely on the recommendations of these representatives on legislation and\npolicy in each settlement. Control passed from Bengal to the Colonial Office in\nLondon on 1 April 1967 and the Settlements became a crown colony.\nCavenagh was the last Governor who reported to the Governor-General in Calcutta.\nHis successor, Sir Harry Ord reported to the Colonial Office in London.\n\n\n{{succession box | title = Governor of Straits Settlements | before = Edmund\nAugustus Blundell | after =
