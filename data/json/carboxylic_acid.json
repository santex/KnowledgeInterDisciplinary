      "text" : "\n\n\n\n\nA 'carboxylic acid' is an organic acid characterized by the presence of at least\none carboxyl group.<ref></ref> The general formula of a carboxylic acid is R-\nCOOH, where R is some monovalent functional group. A 'carboxyl group' (or\n'carboxy') is a functional group consisting of a carbonyl (RR'C=O) and a\nhydroxyl (R-O-H), which has the formula -C(=O)OH, usually written as -COOH or\n-CO<sub>2</sub>H.<ref></ref>\n\nCarboxylic acids are Brønsted-Lowry acids because they are proton\n(H<sup>+</sup>) donors. They are the most common type of organic acid. Among the\nsimplest examples are formic acid H-COOH, which occurs in ants, and acetic acid\nCH<sub>3</sub>-COOH, which gives vinegar its sour taste. Acids with two or more\ncarboxyl groups are called dicarboxylic, tricarboxylic, etc. The simplest\ndicarboxylic example is oxalic acid (COOH)<sub>2</sub>, which is just two\nconnected carboxyls. Mellitic acid is an example of a hexacarboxylic acid. Other\nimportant natural examples are citric acid (in lemons) and tartaric acid (in\ntamarinds).\n\nSalts and esters of carboxylic acids are called carboxylates. When a carboxyl\ngroup is deprotonated, its conjugate base forms a carboxylate anion. Carboxylate\nions are resonance stabilized and this increased stability makes carboxylic\nacids more acidic than alcohols. Carboxylic acids can be seen as reduced or\nalkylated forms of the Lewis acid carbon dioxide; under some circumstances they\ncan be decarboxylated to yield carbon dioxide.\n",
