The organization\nconstitutes a system of collective defence whereby its member states agree to\nmutual defense in response to an attack by any external party. NATO's\nheadquarters are in Brussels, Belgium, one of the 28 member states across North\nAmerica and Europe, the newest of which, Albania and Croatia, joined in April\n2009. An additional 22 countries participate in NATO's \"Partnership for\nPeace\", with 15 other countries involved in institutionalized dialogue\nprograms. The combined military spending of all NATO members constitutes over\n70% of the world's defence spending.\n\nFor its first few years, NATO was not much more than a political association.\nHowever, the Korean War galvanized the member states, and an integrated military\nstructure was built up under the direction of two U.S. supreme commanders. The\ncourse of the Cold War led to a rivalry with nations of the Warsaw Pact, which\nformed in 1955. Doubts over the strength of the relationship between the\nEuropean states and the United States ebbed and flowed, along with doubts over\nthe credibility of the NATO defence against a prospective Soviet invasionâdoubts\nthat led to the development of the independent French nuclear deterrent and the\nwithdrawal of the French from NATO's military structure in 1966.\n\nAfter the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, the organization became drawn into\nthe breakup of Yugoslavia, and conducted its first military interventions in\nBosnia from 1992 to 1995 and later Yugoslavia in 1999. Politically, the\norganization sought better relations with former Cold War rivals, which\nculminated with several former Warsaw Pact states joining the alliance in 1999\nand 2004. The 11 September attacks of 2001 signaled the only occasion in NATO's\nhistory that has been invoked as an attack on all NATO members. {{cite web\n|title=Invocation of Article 5 confirmed\n|url=http://www.nato.int/docu/update/2001/1001/e1002a.htm |work=North Atlantic\nTreaty Organization |accessdate=January 29, 2013}} After the attack,\ntroops were deployed to Afghanistan under the NATO-led ISAF, and the\norganization continues to operate in a range of roles, including sending\ntrainers to Iraq, assisting in counter-piracy operations and most\nrecently in 2011 enforcing a no-fly zone over Libya in accordance with U.N.\nSecurity Council Resolution 1973. The less potent Article 4, which merely\ninvokes consultation among NATO members has been invoked three times, and only\nby Turkey: once in 2003 over the Iraq War, and twice in 2012 over the Syrian\ncivil war after the downing of an unarmed Turkish F-4 reconnaissance jet and\nafter a mortar was fired at Turkey from Syria.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organisation","recorded":1375090620,"links":[],"instances":["france","norway","military","france","germany","country","municipality","land"],"pdf":[],"categories":["1949
