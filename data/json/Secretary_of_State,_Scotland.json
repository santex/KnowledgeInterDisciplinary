{"cursor":"7899","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nThe 'Secretary of Scotland' was a senior post in the pre-Union government\nof Scotland.\n\nThe office appeared in the 14th century (or earlier) when it was combined with\nthat of Keeper of the Privy Seal. Called Clericus Regis (although some have\napplied that to the Lord Clerk Register), he was regarded as an Officer of\nState. The Secretary was constantly to attend the King's person, receive the\npetitions and memorials that were presented to him, and write the King's answers\nupon them. All Letters Patent passed through his hands, and were drawn up by him\nas with all the King's letters and dispatches, warrants, orders, &c. In the case\nof lengthy documents a short docket was also subscribed by the Secretary for the\nKing's perusal, as a summary; and as all the writings signed by the King came\nthrough his hands, he was answerable for them if they contained anything\nderogatory to the laws or the dignity of The Crown. Scot of Scotstarvet, Sir\nJohn, Director of Chancery, The Staggering State of the Scots' Statesmen, 1550 -\n1650, Edinburgh, 1754, xxvii - xxviii\n\nFrom 1626 until their respective deaths, King Charles I divided the duties\nbetween two Secretaries, the Earl of Glencairn and Sir Archibald Achison of\nGlencairn.\n\nThe Secretary did not invariably sit in the Parliament of Scotland after 1603,\nbecause his duties normally involved his attendance upon the monarch who was\nthereafter resident in England. Between 1608 and 1640 there were often two\nSecretaries, which became normal practice after 1680, although only one could\nsit in Parliament.\n\nThe office was abolished as such in 1709, though from then until 1725 and again\nfrom 1742 to 1746 there was a third Secretary of State with particular\nresponsibility for Scottish affairs, for those posts, see Secretary of State\nfor Scotland.\n","linknr":270,"url":"Secretary_of_State,_Scotland","recorded":1375084762,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Secretary_of_State,_Scotland&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Secretary_of_State,_Scotland&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_Scotland","/wiki/Scotland","/wiki/File:Flag_of_Scotland.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/10/Flag_of_Scotland.svg/175px-Flag_of_Scotland.svg.png","/wiki/Politics_of_Scotland","/wiki/Scottish_Government","/wiki/Government_of_the_4th_Scottish_Parliament#Second_Salmond_government","/wiki/First_Minister_of_Scotland","/wiki/Alex_Salmond","/wiki/Deputy_First_Minister_of_Scotland","/wiki/Nicola_Sturgeon","/wiki/Crown_Office_and_Procurator_Fiscal_Service","/wiki/Scottish_Government#Civil_Service","/wiki/Scottish_Government","/wiki/Executive_agencies_of_the_Scottish_Government","/wiki/Scottish_public_bodies","/wiki/Scottish_Parliament","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Scottish_Parliament_from_1999","/wiki/Scottish_Statutory_Instrument","/wiki/Presiding_Officer_of_the_Scottish_Parliament","/wiki/Tricia_Marwick","/wiki/Shadow_Cabinet_(Scottish_Parliament)","/wiki/Shadow_Cabinet_(Scottish_Parliament)","/wiki/Johann_Lamont","/wiki/Member_of_the_Scottish_Parliament","/wiki/Members_of_the_1st_Scottish_Parliament","/wiki/Members_of_the_2nd_Scottish_Parliament","/wiki/Members_of_the_3rd_Scottish_Parliament","/wiki/Members_of_the_4th_Scottish_Parliament","/wiki/Elections_in_Scotland#Scottish_Parliament","/wiki/Scottish_Parliament_election,_1999","/wiki/Scottish_Parliament_election,_2003","/wiki/Scottish_Parliament_election,_2007","/wiki/Scottish_Parliament_election,_2011","/wiki/Scottish_Parliament_constituencies_and_regions","/wiki/Legislative_Consent_Motion","/wiki/Scots_law","/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Supreme_Courts_of_Scotland","/wiki/Sheriff_Court","/wiki/Scottish_Land_Court","/wiki/Justice_of_the_Peace_Court","/wiki/Court_of_the_Lord_Lyon","/wiki/United_Kingdom","/wiki/Government_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Scotland_Office","/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_Scotland","/wiki/Michael_Moore_(UK_politician)","/wiki/Under-Secretary_of_State_for_Scotland","/wiki/David_Mundell","/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Scottish_Grand_Committee","/wiki/Scottish_Affairs_Committee","/wiki/Reserved_matters_(Westminster)","/wiki/Elections_in_Scotland","/wiki/Scottish_Westminster_constituencies","/wiki/List_of_MPs_for_constituencies_in_Scotland_2010%E2%80%93","/wiki/European_Union","/wiki/European_Parliament","/wiki/Elections_in_Scotland#European_Parliament","/wiki/Scotland_(European_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Subdivisions_of_Scotland","/wiki/Local_government_of_Scotland","/wiki/Convention_of_Scottish_Local_Authorities","/wiki/Outline_of_political_science#Politics_by_region","//commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Atlas_of_Scotland","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/Royal_Coat_of_Arms_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg/16px-Royal_Coat_of_Arms_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png","/wiki/Portal:British_politics","/wiki/Template:Politics_of_Scotland","/wiki/Template_talk:Politics_of_Scotland","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Politics_of_Scotland&action=edit","/wiki/Act_of_Union_1707","/wiki/Government_of_Scotland","/wiki/Scotland","/wiki/Keeper_of_the_Privy_Seal_of_Scotland","/wiki/Lord_Clerk_Register","/wiki/Great_Officer_of_State","/wiki/Letters_Patent","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Charles_I_of_England","/wiki/Parliament_of_Scotland","/wiki/List_of_monarchs_of_Scotland","/wiki/England","/wiki/Scottish_affairs","/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_Scotland","/w/index.php?title=Secretary_of_State,_Scotland&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Malcolm_IV_of_Scotland","/w/index.php?title=Duncan_Pecoce&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Robert_II_of_Scotland","/w/index.php?title=Andrew_de_Hawick&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/James_I_of_Scotland","/wiki/John_Stewart,_Earl_of_Buchan","/wiki/Bishop_of_Glasgow","/wiki/William_Foulis_(Keeper_of_the_Privy_Seal)","/w/index.php?title=John_Methven&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/John_de_Ralston","/wiki/Bishop_of_Dunkeld","/wiki/James_II_of_Scotland","/w/index.php?title=Nicholas_Otterburn&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/George_Shoreswood
