Immigration may also result in the addition of new genetic variants to\nthe established gene pool of a particular species or population.\n\nThere are a number of factors that affect the rate of gene flow between\ndifferent populations. One of the most significant factors is mobility, as\ngreater mobility of an individual tends to give it greater migratory potential.\nAnimals tend to be more mobile than plants, although pollen and seeds may be\ncarried great distances by animals or wind.\n\nMaintained gene flow between two populations can also lead to a combination of\nthe two gene pools, reducing the genetic variation between the two groups. It is\nfor this reason that gene flow strongly acts against speciation, by recombining\nthe gene pools of the groups, and thus, repairing the developing differences in\ngenetic variation that would have led to full speciation and creation of\ndaughter species.\n\nFor example, if a species of grass grows on both sides of a highway, pollen is\nlikely to be transported from one side to the other and vice versa. If this\npollen is able to fertilize the plant where it ends up and produce viable\noffspring, then the alleles in the pollen have effectively been able to move\nfrom the population on one side of the highway to the other.\n","linknr":432,"url":"Gene_flow","recorded":1362483551,"links":52,"instances":["biology","biology","biology"],"pdf":["http://www2.nau.edu/~bah/BIO471/Reader/Pennisi_2003.pdf","http://www.rirdc.gov.au/reports/AFT/01-114.pdf","http://www.rirdc.gov.au/reports/AFT/01-114.pdf"],"categories":["Population genetics"],"headings":["Barriers to gene flow","Gene flow in humans","Gene flow between species","Models of gene flow","Gene flow mitigation","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/47/Gene_flow_final.png/300px-Gene_flow_final.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/CollapsedtreeLabels-simplified.svg/200px-CollapsedtreeLabels-simplified.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/Tree_of_life.svg/16px-Tree_of_life.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/Office-book.svg/16px-Office-book.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg/20px-Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["hybrid","biology"],["hybrid","biology"],["fitness","biology"],["morphology","biology"]],"members":["fitness","hybrid","morphology"],"related":["Population","Immigrate","Population_genetics","Alleles","Gene","Population","Allele_frequencies","Gene_pool","Speciation","Great_Wall_of_China","Great_Wall_of_China","Female_choice","Black-throated_blue_warbler","Humans","United_States","Malaria","Duffy_antigen","Hybrid_(biology)","Antigenic_shift","Reassortment","Plasmid","Gene","Species","Phylogenetic","Gene","Phylogenetic_marker","Phylogeny","Coalescence","Cladogenesis","Last_common_ancestor","Life","Molecule","Cenancestor","Species","Hybrid_(biology)","Introgression","Genotypes","Fitness_(biology)","Morphology_(biology)","Mallard","Population_genetics","Sewall_Wright","Neighborhood_model","Island_model","Stepping_stone_model","Genetic_engineering","Livestock","Genetic_pollution","Cross_pollination","Crossbreeding","Biosafety","Co-existence_of_genetically_modified_and_conventional_crops_and_derived_food_and_feed","Transcontainer","Biological_containment","SIGMEA","Co-Extra","Transplastomic_plants","DNA","Plastid","Chloroplast","Photosynthesis","Pollen","Cytoplasmic_male_sterility","Cleistogamy","Biological_dispersal","Genetic_erosion","Genetic_admixture"]}
