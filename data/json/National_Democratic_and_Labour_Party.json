{"cursor":"4049","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"National Democrats}}\n\n\nThe 'National Democratic and Labour Party', usually abbreviated to 'National\nDemocratic Party' (NDP), was a political party in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe party's origins lay in the 1915 split by the right wing of the British\nSocialist Party, primarily over issues raised by the First World War. They\nsupported \"the eternal idea of nationality\" and aimed to promote \"socialist\nmeasures in the war effort\". This group, including H. G. Wells and Robert\nBlatchford, formed the Socialist National Defence Committee. John Callaghan,\nSocialism in Britain (1990), p74.\n\nIn 1916, this Committee worked with Alexander M. Thompson to form the British\nWorkers League. Now avowedly anti-socialist, it described itself as a \"patriotic\nlabour\" group and focused on support for the war. Rev. A. W. Gough, Prebendary\nof St Paul's Cathedral, was Chairman of the British Workers League for London\nand the Home counties.\n\nIn 1918 the British Workers League re-constituted itself as the National\nDemocratic and Labour Party with the support of George Barnes, Member of\nParliament for Glasgow Blackfriars and Hutchesontown, when he resigned from the\nLabour Party.\n\nThe group gained the support of the Musicians' Union and parts of other unions,\nincluding some sections of the Miners' Federation of Great Britain. It was\nprimarily funded by Lloyd George Coalition Liberals and was dedicated to\nsupporting Lloyd George in fighting the First World War.\n\nIn the 1918 general election, the party stood in eighteen seats on the Coalition\nCoupon, winning nine seats, including Barnes in the Glasgow Gorbals seat. All\nthe elected MPs had held a coupon, although nine candidates stood against\nofficial Coalition candidates, none of who secured a seat. Barnes took a seat in\nthe coalition government's cabinet until 1920.\n\nIn 1922, Barnes retired from Parliament, and the group's remaining MPs joined\nthe National Liberal Party. The party was officially wound up in 1923.\n","linknr":149,"url":"National_Democratic_and_Labour_Party","recorded":1375075279,"links":["/w/index.php?title=National_Democratic_and_Labour_Party&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=National_Democratic_and_Labour_Party&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/National_Democratic_Party_(UK,_1966)","/wiki/National_Democrats_(disambiguation)","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=National_Democratic_and_Labour_Party&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Template:Citation_needed","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/Political_party","/wiki/United_Kingdom","/wiki/Right-wing_politics","/wiki/British_Socialist_Party","/wiki/World_War_I","/wiki/Nationality","/wiki/Socialism","/wiki/H._G._Wells","/wiki/Robert_Blatchford","/wiki/Socialist_National_Defence_Committee","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Alexander_M._Thompson","/wiki/British_Workers_League","/wiki/Anti-socialist","/wiki/Patriotism","/wiki/Labour_economics","/wiki/Prebendary","/wiki/St_Paul%27s_Cathedral","/wiki/London","/wiki/Home_counties","/wiki/George_Nicoll_Barnes","/wiki/Member_of_Parliament","/wiki/Glasgow_Blackfriars_and_Hutchesontown_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)","/wiki/Musicians%27_Union_(UK)","/wiki/Miners%27_Federation_of_Great_Britain","/wiki/David_Lloyd_George","/wiki/Liberal_Party_(UK)","/wiki/World_War_I","/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1918","/wiki/Coalition_Coupon","/wiki/Glasgow_Gorbals_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Lloyd_George_ministry","/wiki/National_Liberal_Party_(UK,_1922)","/w/index.php?title=National_Democratic_and_Labour_Party&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Aberdare_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Charles_Stanton","/wiki/Birmingham_Duddeston_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Eldred_Hallas","/wiki/Bradford_East_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Charles_Edgar_Loseby","/wiki/Don_Valley_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/James_Walton_(politician)","/wiki/East_Ham_South_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Clement_Edwards","/wiki/Leicester_West_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Joseph_Frederick_Green","/wiki/Hanley_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/James_Andrew_Seddon","/wiki/Wallsend_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Matthew_Turnbull_Simm","/wiki/Walthamstow_West_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Charles_Jesson","/wiki/Coalition_Labour","/w/index.php?title=National_Democratic_and_Labour_Party&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-1","/wiki/File:Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/ae/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg/30px-Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png","/wiki/File:Vote_icon.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/Vote_icon.svg/15px-Vote_icon.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=National_Democratic_and_Labour_Party&action=edit","/wiki/Template:UK-party-stub","/wiki/Template_talk:UK-party-stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:UK-party-stub&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=National_Democratic_and_Labour_Party&oldid=563156558","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Defunct_political_parties_in_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Category:Labour_parties","/wiki/Category:Labour_Party_(UK)_breakaway_groups","/wiki/Category:Nationalist_parties_in_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Category:Political_parties_established_in_1918","/wiki/Category:Political_parties_disestablished_in_1923","/wiki/Category:1918_establishments_in_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Category:United_Kingdom_political_party_stubs","/wiki/Category:Articles_needing_additional_references_from_May_2009","/wiki/Category:All_articles_needing_additional_references","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=National+Democratic+and+Labour+Party&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=National+Democratic+and+Labour+Party","/wiki/National_Democratic_and_Labour_Party","/wiki/Talk:National_Democratic_and_Labour_Party","#","/wiki/National_Democratic_and_Labour_Party","/w/index.php?title=Nationa
