It is usually referred to simply as the \"bid.\"\n\nIn bid and ask, the bid price stands in contrast to the ask price or \"offer\",\nand the difference between the two is called the bid/ask spread.\n\nAn unsolicited bid or purchase offer is when a person or company receives a bid\neven though they are not looking to sell. A bidding war is said to occur when a\nlarge number of bids are placed in rapid succession by two or more entities,\nespecially when the price paid is much greater than the ask price, or greater\nthan the first bid in the case of unsolicited bidding.\n\nIn the context of stock trading on a stock exchange, the bid price is the\nhighest price a buyer of a stock is willing to pay for a share of that given\nstock. The bid price displayed in most quote services is the highest bid price\nin the market.
