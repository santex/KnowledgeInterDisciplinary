It focuses\non the following aspects of viruses: their structure, classification and\nevolution, their ways to infect and exploit host cells for reproduction, their\ninteraction with host organism physiology and immunity, the diseases they cause,\nthe techniques to isolate and culture them, and their use in research and\ntherapy. Virology is considered to be a subfield of microbiology or of medicine.\n","linknr":535,"url":"Virology","recorded":1362511733,"links":71,"instances":["disease","biology","biology","genetics","biology","biology","biology","genetics","biology"],"pdf":["http://jem.rupress.org/content/201/3/320.full.pdf","http://jem.rupress.org/content/201/3/320.full.pdf","http://www.ohsu.edu/nod/documents/week1/short.vectorology.pdf"],"categories":["Virology|*","Subjects
