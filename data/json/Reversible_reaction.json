{"cursor":"3476","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'reversible reaction' is a chemical reaction that results in an equilibrium\nmixture of reactants and products. For a reaction involving two reactants and\ntwo products this can be expressed symbolically as\n\n:: aA + bB \\rightleftharpoons cC + dD\n\nA and B can react to form C and D or, in the reverse reaction, C and D can react\nto form A and B. This is distinct from reversible process in thermodynamics.\n\nThe concentrations of reactants and products in an equilibrium mixture are\ndetermined by the analytical concentrations of the reagents (A and B or C and D)\nand the equilibrium constant, K. The magnitude of the equilibrium constant\ndepends on the Gibbs free energy change for the reaction. at constant\npressure. So, when the free energy change is large (more than about 30 kJ\nmol −1 ), then the equilibrium constant is large (log K > 3) and\nthe concentrations of the reactants at equilibrium are very small. Such a\nreaction is sometimes considered to be an irreversible reaction, although in\nreality small amounts of the reactants are still expected to be present in the\nreacting system. A truly irreversible chemical reaction is usually achieved when\none of the products exits the reacting system, for example, as does carbon\ndioxide (volatile) in the reaction :Ca CO 3 + 2HCl â CaCl 2\n+ H 2O + CO 2â\n","linknr":122,"url":"Reversible_reaction","recorded":1362482390,"links":26,"instances":["chemistry","thermodynamics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Equilibrium chemistry","Physical chemistry"],"headings":["History","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/4/8/448676ebdd5d01b81d88391146404ff3.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["product","chemistry"],["reversible_process","thermodynamics"]],"members":["product","reversible_process"],"related":["Chemical_reaction","Chemical_equilibrium","Reactant","Product_(chemistry)","Reversible_process_(thermodynamics)","Thermodynamics","Concentration","Analytical_concentration","Equilibrium_constant","Gibbs_free_energy","Claude_Louis_Berthollet","Sodium_carbonate","Salt_lake","Natron","Limestone","Chemical_reaction","Salt","Peter_Waage","Cato_Maximilian_Guldberg","Law_of_mass_action","Henry_Louis_Le_Chatelier","Karl_Ferdinand_Braun","Le_Chatelier's_principle","Dynamic_equilibrium","Irreversibility","Microscopic_reversibility"]}
