which are listed in this summary article. This is a major topic in\nscience and technology and this article gives an overview of its major aspects,\nand provides links to the many specific articles about energy in its different\nforms and contexts.\n\nThe question \"what is energy?\" is difficult to answer in a simple, intuitive\nway, although energy can be rigorously defined in theoretical physics. In the\nwords of Richard Feynman, \"It is important to realize that in physics today, we\nhave no knowledge what energy is. We do not have a picture that energy comes in\nlittle blobs of a definite amount.\"<ref>Richard Feynman, in The Feynman Lectures\non Physics (1964) Volume I, 4-1</ref>\n\nHowever, it is clear that energy is always an indispensable prerequisite for\nperforming mechanical work, and the concept has great importance in natural\nscience. The natural basic units in which energy is measured are those used for\nmechanical work—the joule—which is equivalent to a unit of force multiplied by a\nunit of length. Other equivalent units for energy are mass units multiplied by\nvelocity units squared.\n","title":"Energy","headings":["Forms of energy","History of understanding","Units of measure","Energy in various contexts","Energy transformation","Conservation of energy","Applications of the concept of energy","Energy transfer","Energy and the laws of motion","Energy and thermodynamics","Measurement","See also","Notes and references","Further reading","External links","","{{No more links}}"]},"micro-relation":["9: Kinetic_energy","4: Thermal_energy","4: Potential_energy","4: Conservation_of_energy","4: Time","4: Entropy","3: Joule","3: Radiant_energy","3: Noether's_theorem","3: Translational_symmetry","3: Second_law_of_thermodynamics","3: Matter","2: Richard_Feynman","2: Force","2: Momentum","2: Kilocalorie","2: Mechanical_work","2: Organism","2: Metabolism","2: Supernova","2: Photosynthesis","2: Energy_transformation","2: Electric_energy","2: Gravitational_potential_energy","2: Heat","2: Big_Bang","2: Pendulum","2: Nuclear_fusion","2: Canonical_conjugate","2: Mass","2: Energy_state","2: Photon","2: Lagrangian","2: Wave_function","1: Electric_potential_energy","1: Light_energy","1: Sound_energy","1: Natural_science","1: Length","1: Aristotle","1: Common_Era","1: Gottfried_Leibniz","1: Isaac_Newton","1: Gustave-Gaspard_Coriolis","1: William_John_Macquorn_Rankine","1: Isolated_system","1: Conjugate_variables","1: Caloric_theory","1: James_Prescott_Joule","1: Lord_Kelvin","1: Thermodynamics","1: Rudolf_Clausius","1: Josiah_Willard_Gibbs","1: Walther_Nernst","1: JoÅ¾ef_Stefan","1: California_Institute_of_Technology","1: Nobel_Laureate","1: International_System_of_Units","1: Erg","1: Calorie","1: British_Thermal_Unit","1: Kilowatt-hour","1: Line_integral","1: Frame_dependent","1: Chemistry#Energy","1: Exergonic","1: Endergonic","1: Chemical_reaction","1: Activation_energy","1: Arrhenius_equation","1: Biology#Energy","1: Organelle","1: Carbohydrate","1: Lipid","1: Protein","1: Oxygen","1: Human_equivalent","1: Basal_metabolic_rate","1: Earth_science#earth's_energy","1: Continental_drift","1: Mountain","1: Volcano","1: Earthquake","1: Metereology","1: Wind","1: Rain","1: Hail","1: Snow","1: Lightning","1: Tornado","1: Tropical_cyclone","1: Solar_energy","1: Atmosphere","1: Physical_cosmology#Energy_of_the_cosmos","1: Star","1: Nova","1: Quasar","1: Gamma_ray_burst","1: Glucose","1: Stearin","1: Carbon_dioxide","1: Mitochondrion","1: Adenosine_diphosphate","1: Adenosine_triphosphate","1: Metabolic_pathway","1: Energy_conversion_efficiency","1: Machine","1: Crystal","1: Lattice_energy","1: Ecological_niche","1: Ecology","1: Food_chain","1: Carbon_fixation","1: Chemical_energy","1: Dam","1: Water","1: Turbine","1: Electric_generator","1: Uranium","1: Thorium","1: Nucleosynthesis","1: Gravitational_collapse","1: Fission_bomb","1: Chemical_explosive","1: Chemical_potential","1: Friction","1: Mass-energy_equivalence","1: Albert_Einstein","1: J._J._Thomson","1: Henri_PoincarÃ©","1: Friedrich_HasenÃ¶hrl","1: Mass-energy_equivalence#History","1: Nuclear_physics","1: Irreversibility","1: Heat_death_of_the_universe","1: Heat_engine","1: Radioactive_decay","1: Plate_tectonics","1: Orogenesis","1: Electron_acceptor","1: Catabolism","1: Enzyme","1: Quantum_mechanics","1: Heisenberg_Uncertainty_Principle","1: Particle_physics","1: Virtual_particles","1: Fundamental_forces","1: Fundamental_interactions","1: Virtual_photons","1: Electric_charge","1: Coulomb_law","1: Spontaneous_fission","1: Casimir_force","1: Van_der_Waals_force","1: Conservation_law","1: System","1: Derivative","1: Technical_terminology","1: Classical_physics","1: Special_relativity","1: Lorentz_scalar","1: Energy-momentum","1: 4-vector","1: Space","1: Space-time","1: Lorentz_boost","1: Electromagnetic_energy","1: Conserved_quantity","1: Hamilton's_equations","1: William_Rowan_Hamilton","1: Joseph_Louis_Lagrange","1: Classical_mechanics","1: Internal_energy","1: First_law_of_thermodynamics","1: Thermodynamic_free_energy","1: Pressure","1: Temperature","1: Advection","1: Harmonic_oscillator","1: Potential","1: Frequency","1: Equipartition_principle","1: Oscillator","1: Phonon","1: Ideal_gas","1: Dirac_delta_function","1: LC_circuit","1: Inductor","1: Capacitor","1: Free_space","1: SchrÃ¶dinger_equation","1: Energy_level","1: Quantum","1: Planck","1: Planck's_constant","1: Light","1: Speed","1: Lorentz_transformations","1: Newtonian_mechanics","1: Rest_mass_energy","1: Speed_of_light","1: Electron","1: Positron","1: Invariant_mass","1: Pair_creation","1: Stress-energy_tensor","1: Calorimeter","1: Calorimetry","1: Thermodynamic","1: Thermometer","1: Bolometer","1: Fuel","1: Hydrogen_fuel","1: Gasoline","1: Specific_energy","1: Combustion","1: Index_of_energy_articles","1: Index_of_wave_articles"]}
