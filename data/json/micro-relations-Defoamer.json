The terms anti-foam\nagent and defoamer are often used interchangeably.\n\nIn industrial processes, foams pose serious problems. They cause defects on\nsurface coatings. They prevent the efficient filling of containers. A variety\nof chemical formulas are available to prevent formation of foams. Rainer\nHÃ¶fer, Franz Jost, Milan J.
