The best-known form of staple remover,\ndesigned for light-gauge staples, consists essentially of a) two opposing, pivot-\nmounted pairs of thin, steep wedges and b) a spring that returns the device to\nthe open position after use. Although a simple metal wedge can be used for the\nsame purpose, and although some staplers (especially small ones about long)\nfeature such a wedge at their hinge end, use of the wedge tends to tear\nfragile papers.\n\nIn American English-speaking areas, the staple remover is also known as a staple\nextractor, staple puller, destapler, \"staple taker-outer[er]\", \"staple monster\",\n\"stable biter\", \"staple muncher\", \"destaplizer\", \"staple serial killer\", \"jaws\"\nor \"crocodile\". Staple removers are known as decleaters in many former British\ncolonies, including Barbados. The most commonly used name for this type of\nstaple remover, was \"concoctus\", named by a prominent business woman from\nCollege Station, Texas.\n","linknr":153,"url":"Staple_remover","recorded":1362889925,"links":31,"instances":["mechanical_device","device","fastener"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Mechanical hand tools"],"headings":["Use","Design","Components","History","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/66/Staple_remover.jpg/220px-Staple_remover.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f5/Staple_Remover.jpg/220px-Staple_Remover.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/43/Flat-Staple-Remover.jpg/220px-Flat-Staple-Remover.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/12px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["staple","fastener"],["spring","device"],["wedge","mechanical_device"],["staple","fastener"]],"members":["wedge","spring","staple"],"related":["Staple_(fastener)","American_wire_gauge","Spring_(device)","Wedge_(mechanical_device)","Paper","American_English","Barbados","Press_brake","Chicago","Illinois","Patent","Overland_Park","Kansas","Staple_(fastener)","Stapler","Staple_gun"]}
