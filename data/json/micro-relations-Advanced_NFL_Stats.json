It also features a live in-game win\nprobability model that estimates the chances either opponent will win a game in\nprogress. Advanced NFL Stats uses its win probability model to analyze strategic\ncoaching decisions such as whether to kick or attempt first down conversions.\n\nResearch topics include game theory applications, luck and\nrandomness, {{cite news|url= http://fifthdown.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/12/24/jets-were-one-of-the-luckiest-\nteams/|title=New York Times-Jets Were One of the Luckiest Teams| accessdate=2009-01-\n17|publisher=nytimes.com | first=Toni | last=Monkovic | date=2008-12-24|\narchiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090129105927/http://fifthdown.blogs.ny-\ntimes.com/2008/12/24/jets-were-one-of-the-luckiest-teams/| archivedate= 29\nJanuary 2009 | deadurl= no}} play calling, home field\nadvantage, run-pass balance, and the relative importance of various facets of\nperformance (offensive passing, offensive rushing, defensive passing, etc.).\nAlso featured is research on weather factors, team payroll, and the NFL Draft.\n\nThe site has pioneered other analytical concepts such as Air Yards, which is the\ndistance forward of the line of scrimmage that a pass travels. It removes the\ncontribution of Yards After Catch (YAC) run by a receiver.\n\nAdvanced NFL Stats also features a catalog of unique individual player stats.\nEach player's contribution toward his team's wins, known as Win Probability\nAdded (WPA), is available for each season since 2000. Expected Points Added\n(EPA), success rate (SR), and many other innovative metrics are available.\n\nDuring the NFL off-season, Burke has posted original research related to other\nNorth American professional sports leagues. {{cite news|url= http://blogs.wsj.com/dailyfix/2009/04/27/the-count-refining-the-concept-of-a-\nmust-win-game/|title=The Wall Street Journal, \"The Count: Refining the Concept\nof a Must-Win Game\"| accessdate=2009-04-287|publisher=wsj.com | first=Carl |\nlast=Bialik | date=2009-04-27}}\n","linknr":127,"url":"Advanced_NFL_Stats","recorded":1362484710,"links":10,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["American football strategy","National Football League websites"],"headings":["See also","External links","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["National_Football_League","Logistic_regression","Win_Probability","NFL_Draft","Yards_after_catch","Win_probability_added","Football_Outsiders"]}
