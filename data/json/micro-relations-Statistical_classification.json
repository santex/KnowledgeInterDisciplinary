{"cursor":"15633","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In machine learning and statistics, 'classification' is the problem of\nidentifying to which of a set of categories (sub-populations) a new observation\nbelongs, on the basis of a training set of data containing observations (or\ninstances) whose category membership is known. The individual observations are\nanalyzed into a set of quantifiable properties, known as various explanatory\nvariables, features, etc. These properties may variously be categorical (e.g.\n\"A\", \"B\", \"AB\" or \"O\", for blood type), ordinal (e.g. \"large\", \"medium\" or\n\"small\"), integer-valued (e.g. the number of occurrences of a part word in an\nemail) or real-valued (e.g. a measurement of blood pressure). Some algorithms\nwork only in terms of discrete data and require that real-valued or integer-\nvalued data be discretized into groups (e.g. less than 5, between 5 and 10, or\ngreater than 10). An example would be assigning a given email into \"spam\" or \"non-\nspam\" classes or assigning a diagnosis to a given patient as described by\nobserved characteristics of the patient (gender, blood pressure, presence or\nabsence of certain symptoms, etc.).\n\nAn algorithm that implements classification, especially in a concrete\nimplementation, is known as a '[[Pattern_recognition|classifier]]'. The term\n\"classifier\" sometimes also refers to the mathematical function, implemented by\na classification algorithm, that maps input data to a category.\n\nIn the terminology of machine learning, classification is considered an instance\nof supervised learning, i.e. learning where a training set of correctly-\nidentified observations is available. The corresponding unsupervised procedure\nis known as [[data clustering|clustering]] (or cluster analysis), and involves\ngrouping data into categories based on some measure of inherent similarity (e.g.\nthe distance between instances, considered as vectors in a multi-dimensional\nvector space).\n\nTerminology across fields is quite varied. In statistics, where classification\nis often done with logistic regression or a similar procedure, the properties of\nobservations are termed explanatory variables (or independent variables,\nregressors, etc.), and the categories to be predicted are known as outcomes,\nwhich are considered to be possible values of the dependent variable. In machine\nlearning, the observations are often known as instances, the explanatory\nvariables are termed features (grouped into a feature vector), and the possible\ncategories to be predicted are classes. There is also some argument over whether\nclassification methods that do not involve a statistical model can be considered\n\"statistical\". Other fields may use different terminology: e.g. in community\necology, the term \"classification\" normally refers to cluster analysis, i.e. a\ntype of unsupervised learning, rather than the supervised learning described in\nthis article.\n","linknr":502,"url":"Statistical_classification","recorded":1362896638,"links":24,"instances":["pattern_recognition"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Machine learning","Classification algorithms|*","Statistical classification|"],"headings":["Relation to other problems","Frequentist procedures","Bayesian procedures","Binary and multiclass classification","Feature vectors","Linear classifiers","Algorithms","Evaluation","Application domains","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/math/6/8/3/683d1f36655df70ba81886dd60076551.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["feature","pattern_recognition"],["boosting","meta-algorithm"]],"members":["feature","boosting"],"related":["Machine_learning","Statistics","Categorical_data","Training_set","Explanatory_variables","Categorical_data","Blood_type","Ordinal_data","Integer","Real_number","Supervised_learning","Unsupervised_learning","Cluster_analysis","Distance","Vector_space","Statistics","Logistic_regression","Explanatory_variable","Independent_variable","Dependent_variable","Feature_vector","Statistical_model","Community_ecology","Cluster_analysis","Unsupervised_learning","Pattern_recognition","Regression_analysis","Sequence_labeling","Part_of_speech_tagging","Part_of_speech","Parsing","Parse_tree","Syntactic_structure","Statistical_inference","Probability","R._A._Fisher","Fisher's_linear_discriminant","Multivariate_normal_distribution","Linear","C._R._Rao","Nonlinear","T._W._Anderson","Mahalanobis_distance","Markov_chain_Monte_Carlo","Class_membership_probabilities","Binary_classification","Multiclass_classification","Feature_vector","Feature_(pattern_recognition)","Explanatory_variable","Independent_variable","Statistically_independent","Binary_data","Categorical_data","Blood_type","Ordinal_data","Integer","Real_number","Vector_space","Dimensionality_reduction","Algorithm","Linear_function","Linear_combination","Dot_product","Linear_predictor_function","Discrete_choice","Utility","Linear_classifier","Logistic_regression","Multinomial_logit","Probit_regression","Perceptron","Support_vector_machine","Linear_discriminant_analysis","Neural_network","Support_vector_machines","K-nearest_neighbor_algorithm","Naive_Bayes","Decision_tree","Radial_basis_function","Linear_classifier","Fisher's_linear_discriminant","Logistic_regression","Naive_Bayes_classifier","Perceptron","Support_vector_machine","Least_squares_support_vector_machine","Quadratic_classifier","K-nearest_neighbor_algorithm","Boosting_(meta-algorithm)","Decision_tree_learning","Random_forest","Artificial_neural_networks","Gene_expression_programming","Bayesian_network","Hidden_Markov_model","Learning_vector_quantization","Proaftn","No_free_lunch_in_search_and_optimization","Precision_and_recall","Receiver_operating_characteristic","Uncertainty_coefficient","Accuracy","Data_mining","Computer_vision","Medical_imaging","Optical_character_recognition","Video_tracking","Drug_discovery","Drug_development","Toxicogenomics","Quantitative_structure-activity_relationship","Geostatistics","Speech_recognition","Handwriting_recognition","Biometric","Biological_classification","Statistical_natural_language_processing","Document_classification","Search_engines","Credit_scoring","Pattern_recognition","Class_membership_probabilities","Classification_rule","Compound_term_processing","Data_mining","Fuzzy_logic","Data_warehouse","Information_retrieval","Artificial_intelligence","Machine_learning","Pattern_recognition","Adaptive_kernel_density_estimation","University_of_Leicester"]}
