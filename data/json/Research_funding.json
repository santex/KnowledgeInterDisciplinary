{"cursor":"18182","size":15,"audio":[],"cat":[],"tmpl":[],"currentlang":"en","linknr":95,"url":"Research_funding","article":"'Research funding' is a term generally covering any funding for scientific\nresearch, in the areas of both \"hard\" science and technology and social science.\nThe term often connotes funding obtained through a competitive process, in which\npotential research projects are evaluated and only the most promising receive\nfunding. Such processes, which are run by government, corporations or\nfoundations, allocate scarce funds.\n\nMost research funding comes from two major sources, corporations (through\nresearch and development departments) and government (primarily carried out\nthrough universities and specialized government agencies). Some small amounts\nof scientific research are carried out (or funded) by charitable foundations,\nespecially in relation to developing cures for diseases such as cancer,\nmalaria and AIDS.\n\nAccording to OECD, around two-thirds of research and development in scientific\nand technical fields is carried out by industries, and 20% and 10% respectively\nby universities and government. Comparatively, in countries with less GDP, such\nas Portugal and Mexico the industry contribution is significantly lower. The US\ngovernment spends more than other countries on military R&D, although the\nproportion has fallen from around 30% in the 1980s to under 20. Government\nfunding for medical research amounts to approximately 36% in\nthe U.S. The government funding proportion in certain industries is higher, and\nit dominates research in social science and humanities. Similarly, with some\nexceptions (e.g. biotechnology) government provides the bulk of the funds for\nbasic scientific research. In commercial research and development, all but the\nmost research-oriented corporations focus more heavily on near-term\ncommercialization possibilities rather than \"blue-sky\" ideas or technologies\n(such as nuclear fusion).\n","recorded":1362124488,"portal":[],"list":[],"links":"96","instances":["magazine","wetenschap"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Innovation economics|funding","Research","Science in society"],"headings":["Government-funded research","Privately funded research","Research funding process","Funding influence on research","History","See also","References","External links"],"tags":[["discover","magazine"],["http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/geldstroom","wetenschap"]],"image":["http://en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","http://bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","http://bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"related":["Research","Science","Technology","Social_science","Research_and_development","Cancer","Malaria","AIDS","OECD","Research_and_development","Universities","Portugal","Mexico","Social_science","Humanities","Biotechnology","Nuclear_fusion","Basic_research","High-temperature_superconductivity","L'Or√©al-UNESCO_Awards_for_Women_in_Science","Human_genome","Human_Genome_Project","Celera_Genomics","Engineering_and_Physical_Sciences_Research_Council","National_Council_of_University_Research_Administrators","Systematic_review","Cochrane_Collaboration","Systematic_review","Randomized_controlled_trial","Observational_study","Cochrane_Library","Meta-analyses","Olestra","Procter_&_Gamble","National_Institutes_of_Health","Industrial_revolution","Inventor","Patent","Charles_Goodyear","Corporation","Research_and_development","Wilkinson_Sword","Global_Gillette","Disposable_razor","List_of_funding_opportunity_databases"],"members":["discover"],"book":[]}
