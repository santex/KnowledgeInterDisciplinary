{"cursor":"23943","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n players celebrating a goal.]]\n\n'Goal' refers to a method of scoring in many sports. It can also refer to the\nphysical structure or area of the playing surface where scoring occurs.\n\nIn several sports, a 'goal' is the sole method of scoring, and thus the final\nscore is expressed in the total number of goals scored by each team. In other\nsports, a goal may be one of several scoring methods, and thus may be worth a\ndifferent set number of points than the others. A few of these sports use the\nterm 'field goal' to distinguish one scoring method from another.\n\nThe structure of a goal can vary widely from sport to sport. In sports where\ngoals are the sole method of scoring, the goal is often a rectangular structure\nthat is placed at each end of the playing surface. Each structure usually\nconsists of two vertical posts, called the 'goal posts', supporting a horizontal\ncrossbar. A line called the goal line is also marked on the playing surface\nwhere each goal is located, parallel to the crossbars. Thus, the objective is to\nsend the ball or puck between the goal posts, under the crossbar, and across the\n'goal line'. There is often a net to catch the ball or puck as it is sent into\nthe goal. Other sports have very different structures, but have a variation on\nthe theme of goal lines, goal posts, crossbars, and nets.\n","linknr":376,"url":"Goal_(sport)","recorded":1362582494,"links":75,"instances":["american_football","basketball","disambiguation","association_football","football","ice_hockey","association_football","american_football"],"pdf":["http://www.usfieldhockey.com/hockey/rules_of_hockey07_08.pdf","http://www.usfieldhockey.com/hockey/rules_of_hockey07_08.pdf","http://www.ihf-online.info/upload/PDF-Download/rules_english.pdf","http://www.ihf-online.info/upload/PDF-Download/rules_english.pdf","http://www.ncaa.org/library/rules/2008/2008_m_lacrosse_rules.pdf","http://www.ncaa.org/library/rules/2008/2008_m_lacrosse_rules.pdf","http://www.usawaterpolo.org/media/usaplayingrules.pdf","http://www.usawaterpolo.org/media/usaplayingrules.pdf","http://www.us-polo.org/rules/outdoor_rules.pdf","http://www.us-polo.org/rules/outdoor_rules.pdf","http://afl.com.au/portals/0/afl_docs/2007_LAWS_OF_THE_GAME.pdf","http://afl.com.au/portals/0/afl_docs/2007_LAWS_OF_THE_GAME.pdf","http://www.gaa.ie/files/official_playing_rules.pdf","http://www.gaa.ie/files/official_playing_rules.pdf","http://www.fiba.com/downloads/Rules/2010/BasketballEquipment2010_V2.pdf","http://www.fiba.com/downloads/Rules/2010/BasketballEquipment2010_V2.pdf","http://www.cfl.ca/themes/cfl3/pdf/07rulebook.pdf","http://www.cfl.ca/themes/cfl3/pdf/07rulebook.pdf","http://www.cfl.ca/uploads/assets/CFL/PDF_Docs/CFLRules_2010_ENG.pdf","http://www.cfl.ca/uploads/assets/CFL/PDF_Docs/CFLRules_2010_ENG.pdf"],"categories":["Scoring","Association
