There are approximately a dozen members of this family, which\nare distinguished by their structure, catalytic mechanism, and which proteins\nthey cleave. Most of the members become activated at the low pH found in\nlysosomes. Thus, the activity of this family lies almost entirely within those\norganelles. There are, however, exceptions such as cathepsin K, which works\nextracellularly after secretion by osteoclasts in bone resorption.\n\nCathepsins have a vital role in mammalian cellular turnover, e.g. bone\nresorption. They degrade polypeptides and are distinguished by their substrate\nspecificites.\n","linknr":642,"url":"Cathepsins","recorded":1362484366,"links":24,"instances":["biochemistry","biochemistry"],"pdf":["http://medical.med.tokushima-u.ac.jp/jmi/vol52/pdf/v52_n1-2_p001.pdf","http://medical.med.tokushima-u.ac.jp/jmi/vol52/pdf/v52_n1-2_p001.pdf"],"categories":["EC 3.4","Peptidase","Protein families"],"headings":["Classification","Clinical significance","Cathepsin Zymography","History","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2d/Cathepsin_K_1TU6.png/220px-Cathepsin_K_1TU6.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["substrate","biochemistry"],["denaturation","biochemistry"]],"members":["substrate","denaturation"],"related":["Ancient_Greek","Protease","Enzymes","Lysosomes","Bone_resorption","Protein","Substrate_(biochemistry)","Cathepsin_A","Serine_protease","Cathepsin_B","Cysteine_protease","Cathepsin_C","Cathepsin_D","Aspartyl_protease","Cathepsin_E","Cathepsin_F","Cathepsin_G","Cathepsin_H","Cathepsin_K","Cathepsin_L1","Cathepsin_L2","Cathepsin_O","Cathepsin_S","Cathepsin_W","Cathepsin_Z","Cancer","Stroke","Alzheimer's_disease","Arthritis","Ebola","Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease","Chronic_periodontitis","Keratoconus","Retinal_detachment","Age-related_macular_degeneration","Glaucoma","Galactosialidosis","Lysate","Malignant_melanoma","Amyloid_plaque","Esophageal_adenocarcinoma","Ovarian_cancer","Myocardial_infarction","Aspartyl_protease","Fibronectin","Laminin","Collagenase","Osteoporosis","Osteoclast","Collagen","Insulin_receptor","Insulin-like_growth_factor_1_receptor","GLUT4","Zymography","Gel_electrophoresis","Polyacrylamide","Polymerization","Gelatin","Denaturation_(biochemistry)","Leupeptin","Coomassie_Brilliant_Blue","MEDLINE","PubMed","Journal_of_Biological_Chemistry","Max_Bergmann","MEROPS"]}
