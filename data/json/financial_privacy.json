{"cursor":"3363","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Financial Privacy' is a blanket term for a multitude of privacy issues:\n\n*Financial Institutions ensuring that their customers information remains\nprivate to those outside the institution. Issues include the Patriot Act, and\nother debates of privacy vs. security.\n\n*The term is also used to describe the issue of financial institutions selling\ncustomer information to other companies so that those companies may use that for\nmarketing, and especially telemarketing purposes. This issue however is mixed\nwith the issue of financial institutions sharing information within themselves,\nwhich could be considered \"sharing information between companies\" or \"affiliate\nsharing\" since a financial institution is not allowed to be one company for\nregulatory reasons, but instead must assume a holding company structure. This\nsense of the word has been the main issue debated in the United States during\nthe 21st century.\n\nDebates on the first sense of the phrase have many different points of view,\nfrom crypto anarchists who want to create a completely decentralized and\nanonymous banking system, to others who support enhancing the power of the\ngovernment to find financial information in order to fight terrorism.\n\nHowever, the majority of the debate in the United States involves the second\nsense of the phrase. The same anger against telemarketers which led to the\nUnited States National Do Not Call Registry also was focused on what some\nalleged to be the source of many of the telemarketers leads: financial\ninstitutions selling things like balances and transaction information to\ntelemarketers. Financial services companies, those that offer both banking,\ninsurance, and investment products however say that the issue and attempted\nlegislation on the topic was brought on by smaller financial institutions who\nsimply focused on one type of product or business. The reason for this is that\ncombining all those products with one company creates a Wal Mart style economies\nof scale and other synergies which are difficult to compete against as a single\nproduct line company. By putting forth legislation which forbids financial\ninstitutions from sharing information with other companies, single-product-line\nfinancial institutions could cripple integrated financial services companies\nbecause of the technicality that the banking, investments, and insurance parts\nof the business had to be operated under separate company affiliates within a\nholding company. Most financial services companies claim that they never had\nsold information to non financial services companies. Some critics of financial\ninstitutions agreed with this analysis but continued to press for the\nlegislation because they believed that the financial services integrated\nbusiness model was fundamentally wrong; however the vast majority of critical\narticles focused on the issue of selling information to outside telemarketers.\n","linknr":142,"url":"financial_privacy","recorded":1372154134,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Financial_privacy&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Financial_privacy&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Financial_privacy&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/Privacy","/wiki/Financial_Institution","/wiki/Patriot_Act","/wiki/Marketing","/wiki/Telemarketing","/wiki/Holding_company","/wiki/Crypto-anarchism","/wiki/Terrorism","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/United_States_National_Do_Not_Call_Registry","/wiki/Financial_services","/wiki/Insurance","/wiki/Investment","/wiki/Wal_Mart","/wiki/Economies_of_scale","/wiki/Business_model","/w/index.php?title=Financial_privacy&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Bank_secrecy","/wiki/Right_to_Financial_Privacy_Act","/wiki/Financial_cryptography","/w/index.php?title=Financial_privacy&action=edit&section=2","https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1PaFUxCbMlYgWxTzP9LQNw1tPdzpJiuGZdFZ9h0IQgzI/viewform","/wiki/Template:Privacy","/wiki/Template_talk:Privacy","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Privacy&action=edit","/wiki/Privacy","/wiki/Expectation_of_privacy","/wiki/Privacy_law","/wiki/Privacy_in_Australian_law","/wiki/Canadian_privacy_law","/wiki/Privacy_in_English_law","/wiki/Data_Protection_Directive","/wiki/Privacy_laws_of_the_United_States","/wiki/Consumer_privacy","/wiki/Medical_privacy","/wiki/Workplace_privacy","/wiki/Information_privacy","/wiki/Information_privacy_law","/wiki/Internet_privacy","/wiki/Political_privacy","/wiki/Personally_identifiable_information","/wiki/Personal_identifier","/wiki/Privacy-enhancing_technologies","/wiki/Privacy_issues_of_social_networking_sites","/wiki/American_Civil_Liberties_Union","/wiki/Center_for_Democracy_and_Technology","/wiki/Computer_Professionals_for_Social_Responsibility","/wiki/Future_of_Privacy_Forum","/wiki/Electronic_Privacy_Information_Center","/wiki/Electronic_Frontier_Foundation","/wiki/Global_Network_Initiative","/wiki/Privacy_International","/wiki/Privacy_Rights_Clearinghouse","/wiki/Anonymity","/wiki/Cyberstalking","/wiki/Data_security","/wiki/Human_rights","/wiki/Identity_theft","/wiki/Panopticon","/wiki/Personality_rights","/wiki/Search_warrant","/wiki/Surveillance","/wiki/Mass_surveillance","/wiki/Surveillance_state","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Financial_privacy&oldid=556255022","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Privacy","/wiki/Category:Banking","/wiki/Category:Business_ethics","/wiki/Category:Personal_finance","/wiki/Category:Articles_lacking_sources_from_March_2007","/wiki/Category:All_articles_lacking_sources","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Financial+privacy&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Financial+privacy","/wiki/Financial_privacy","/wiki/Talk:Financial_privacy","#","/wiki/Financial_privacy","/w/index.php?title=Financial_privacy&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Financial_privacy&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf7/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Financial_privacy","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Financial_privacy","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Financial_privacy&oldid=556255022","/w/index.php?title=Financial_privacy&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Financial_privacy&id=556255022","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Financial+privacy","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&b
