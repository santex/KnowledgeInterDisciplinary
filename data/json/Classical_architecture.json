Classical architecture\nhas inspired many more recent architects and has led to revivals such as\nneoclassical architecture from the mid-18th century and the Greek Revival of the\n19th century. After a brief period of eclecticism, the classical style reigned\nagain from the late 19th century until the second world war, though it continues\nto inform many architects to this day.\n\nThe term \"classical architecture\" also applies to any mode of architecture that\nhas evolved to a highly refined state, such as classical Chinese architecture,\nor classical Mayan architecture. It can also refer to any architecture that\nemploys classical aesthetic philosophy.\n","linknr":206,"url":"Classical_architecture","recorded":1362568651,"links":30,"instances":["capitoline_hill"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Architectural history","Architectural styles","Classicism"],"headings":["Archaeological use","Architectural use","Petrification","See also","References","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/Tholos_Athena_Pronaia.JPG/220px-Tholos_Athena_Pronaia.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a7/Con%C3%ADmbriga_-casa_das_fontes.jpg/300px-Con%C3%ADmbriga_-casa_das_fontes.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f4/P_parthenon.svg/31px-P_parthenon.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["temple_of_jupiter","capitoline_hill"]],"members":["temple_of_jupiter"],"related":["Delphi,_Greece","Architecture","Classical_antiquity","Renaissance","Neoclassical_architecture","Greek_Revival","Portugal","Alexander_the_Great","Greece","Etruscan_civilization","Renaissance","Europe","John_Summerson","Classical_orders","Doric_order","Ionic_order","Corinthian_order","Gaul","Archaic_Greece","Classical_Greece","Doric_order","Etruscans","Temple_of_Jupiter_(Capitoline_Hill)","Outline_of_classical_architecture","Richard_Sammons"]}
