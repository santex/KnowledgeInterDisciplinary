{"cursor":"8202","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The office of 'Lord Clerk Register' is the oldest surviving Great Officer of\nState in Scotland, with origins in the 13th century.\n\nThe Clerk-Register was from ancient times the principal Clerk in the kingdom,\nfrom whom all other clerks, whatever their government positions, and who were\nessentially his deputies, derived their immediate authority. He acted also as\nClerk to the parliament and Privy Council, where in the old registers and\nproceedings of parliament he is referred to as 'Clericus Rotulorum', because the\nancient scripts were in rolls of paper, not books. These later became termed\nRotuli parliamenti, the rolls of court, but were thereafter ordered to be made\nup into Register books and the respective clerks instructed to transmit those\nbooks to the Clerk-Register to be preserved by him in the public archives.\nScot, Sir John, of Scotstarvet, Director of Chancery, The Staggering State of\nthe Scots' Statesment, from 1550 to 1650, Edinburgh, 1754: xxxii - xxxiii\n\nBy the Treaty of Union in 1707 the preservation of public records was provided\nfor, and the election, and management thereof of the sixteen Scottish peers to\nthe House of Lords in the new British parliament was ordered by the Lord Clerk-\nregister, with two Clerks of Session commissioned by him to assist. Scot,\nSir John, 1754: xxxiii\n\nThe office formerly had other functions also: as well as the responsibility for\npublic registers and records, the Clerk-register was Commissioner for the\nRegalia and Keeper of the Signet. Only the latter two remain and the office is\nnow largely ceremonial in nature and carries no salary or special privileges.\n\nThe Lord Clerk Register (Scotland) Act 1879 provided that the Lord Clerk\nRegister should continue as an Officer of State, but all his rights and duties\nwith regard to the preservation of the public registers and records were\ntransferred to the Deputy Clerk Register (now the Keeper of the Records of\nScotland). The Lord Clerk Register remained responsible for the election of\nrepresentative peers of Scotland until these were abolished in 1963.\n\nThe role has been largely honorific since 1806, when a Deputy Clerk Register was\nappointed.\n\nThe Lord Clerk Register is one of the Commissioners of the Regalia, under a\nRoyal Commission of 1818, responsible for the Honours of Scotland. In practice\nthis responsibility was delegated to a deputy, then to the Queen's and Lord\nTreasurer's Remembrancer, and now to Historic Scotland. In 1996 the\nCommissioners were given additional responsibility for the Stone of Destiny\nunder another Royal Warrant.\n\nThe role of Lord Clerk Register is combined with the role of Keeper of the\nSignet, which was given to the Lord Clerk Register in 1817.\n\nThe Scottish Executive announced on 27 April 2007 that the Queen had appointed\nLord Mackay of Clashfern to the office, replacing the Earl of Wemyss and March.\n[http://www.scotland.gov.uk/News/Releases/2007/04/27102051\nhttp://www.scotland.gov.uk/News/Releases/2007/04/27102051]\n","linknr":321,"url":"Lord_Clerk_Register","recorded":1375084757,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Lord_Clerk_Register&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Lord_Clerk_Register&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Great_Officer_of_State","/wiki/Scotland","/wiki/Parliament_of_Scotland","/wiki/Privy_Council_of_Scotland","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Treaty_of_Union_in_1707","/wiki/Scottish_representative_peers","/wiki/Scottish_peers","/wiki/House_of_Lords","/wiki/Parliament_of_Great_Britain","/wiki/Court_of_Session","#cite_note-2","/w/index.php?title=Commissioner_for_the_Regalia&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Society_of_Writers_to_Her_Majesty%E2%80%99s_Signet","/w/index.php?title=Lord_Clerk_Register_(Scotland)_Act_1879&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Keeper_of_the_Records_of_Scotland","/wiki/Representative_peer","/wiki/Royal_Commission","/wiki/Honours_of_Scotland","/wiki/Queen%27s_and_Lord_Treasurer%27s_Remembrancer","/wiki/Historic_Scotland","/wiki/Stone_of_Scone","/wiki/Royal_Warrant","/wiki/Scottish_Executive","/wiki/Queen_Elizabeth_II","/wiki/Lord_Mackay_of_Clashfern","/wiki/Earl_of_Wemyss_and_March","#cite_note-3","/w/index.php?title=Lord_Clerk_Register&action=edit&section=1","#cite_note-4","/wiki/Bishop_of_St_Andrews","/wiki/Malcolm_IV_of_Scotland","/wiki/Alexander_II_of_Scotland","/wiki/Robert_II_of_Scotland","/wiki/Dundee","/wiki/Archdeacon_of_Glasgow","/wiki/Newlands,_Glasgow","/wiki/Dunkeld","/wiki/Glasgow","/wiki/Wigton","/wiki/Linlithgow","/wiki/Glasgow","/wiki/Restalrig","/wiki/Dunblane","/wiki/St_Andrews","/wiki/Aberdeen","/wiki/James_IV_of_Scotland","/wiki/James_MacGill_of_Nether_Rankeillour","/wiki/Flisk","/wiki/James_Balfour_(Pittendreich)","/w/index.php?title=Alexander_Hay,_Lord_Easter_Kennet&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/John_Skene,_Lord_Curriehill","/wiki/Thomas_Hamilton,_1st_Earl_of_Haddington","/wiki/Earl_of_Haddington","/w/index.php?title=John_Hay,_Lord_Barra&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Alexander_Gibson,_Lord_Durie&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Archibald_Johnston,_Lord_Warriston","/wiki/Archibald_Primrose,_Lord_Carrington","/wiki/Sir_Thomas_Burnett,_3rd_Baronet","/w/index.php?title=Charles_Douglas,_2nd_Earl_of_Selkirk&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Sir_James_Murray,_Lord_Philiphaugh","#cite_note-philiphaugh-5","/wiki/James_Johnston_(Secretary_of_State)","#cite_note-6","#cite_note-philiphaugh-5","/wiki/Archibald_Campbell,_3rd_Duke_of_Argyll","/wiki/James_Graham,_1st_Duke_of_Montrose","/wiki/Alexander_Hume-Campbell,_2nd_Earl_of_Marchmont","/w/index.php?title=Charles_Douglas,_2nd_Earl_of_Selkirk&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/William_Kerr,_3rd_Marquess_of_Lothian","/wiki/Alexander_Hume_Campbell","/wiki/James_Douglas,_14th_Earl_of_Morton","/wiki/Lord_Frederick_Campbell","/wiki/Archibald_Colquhoun","/wiki/William_Dundas","/wiki/James_Andrew_Broun-Ramsay,_1st_Marquess_of_Dalhousie","/wiki/William_Gibson_Craig","/wiki/George_Frederick_Boyle,_6th_Earl_of_Glasgow","/wiki/Douglas_Beresford_Malise_Ronald_Graham,_5th_Duke_of_Montrose","/wiki/John_Charles_Montagu-Douglas-Scott,_7th_Duke_of_Buccleuch","/wiki/Walter_John_Francis_Erskine,_12th_Earl_of_Mar","/wiki/Sidney_Herbert_Elphinstone,_16th_Baron_Elphinstone","/wiki/Walter_John_Montagu-Douglas-Scott,_8th_Duke_of_Buccleuch","/wiki/Francis_David_Charteris,_12th_Earl_of_Wemyss","/wiki/James_Mackay,_Baron_Mackay_of_Clashfern","/w/index.php?title=Lord_Clerk_Register&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-1","/wiki/Sir_John_Scott_of_Scotstarvet","#cite_ref-2","#cite_ref-3","http://www.scotland.gov.uk/News/Releases/2007/04/27102051","#cite_ref-4","#cite_ref-philiphaugh_5-0","#cite_ref-philiphaugh_5-1","/wiki/Oxford_Dictionary_of_National_Biography","http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/19615,","#cite_ref-6","http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/14941,","/w/index.php?title=Lord_Clerk_Register&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/Registrar_General_for_Scotland","/wiki/Lord_Justice_Clerk","/wiki/Template:Scotland_topics","/wiki/Template_talk:Scotland_topics","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Scotland_topics&action=edit","/wiki/Scotland","/wiki/List_of_Scotland-re
