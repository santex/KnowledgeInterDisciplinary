{"cursor":"4968","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"s to form a peptide bond (red) with expulsion of water (blue)]] A 'condensation\nreaction', also commonly referred to as dehydration synthesis, is a chemical\nreaction in which two molecules or moieties (functional groups) combine to form\na larger molecule, together with the loss of a small molecule. Possible small molecules lost are water, hydrogen chloride,\nmethanol, or acetic acid. The word \"condensation\" suggests a process in which\ntwo or more things are brought \"together\" (Latin \"con\") to form something\n\"dense\", like in condensation from gaseous to liquid state of matter; this does\nnot imply, however, that condensation reaction products have greater density\nthan reactants.\n\nWhen two separate molecules react, the condensation is termed intermolecular. A\nsimple example is the condensation of two amino acids to form the peptide bond\ncharacteristic of proteins. This reaction example is the opposite of hydrolysis,\nwhich splits a chemical entity into two parts through the action of the polar\nwater molecule, which itself splits into hydroxide and hydrogen ions. Hence\nenergy is released.\n\nIf the union is between atoms or groups of the same molecule, the reaction is\ntermed intramolecular condensation, and in many cases leads to ring formation.\nAn example is the Dieckmann condensation, in which the two ester groups of a\nsingle diester molecule react with each other to lose a small alcohol molecule\nand form a Î²-ketoester product.\n","linknr":184,"url":"Condensation_reaction","recorded":1362372410,"links":32,"instances":["chemistry","chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Condensation reactions","Organic reactions","Chemical reactions"],"headings":["Mechanism","Condensation reactions in polymer chemistry","Applications","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/AminoacidCondensation.svg/576px-AminoacidCondensation.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/23/Dieckmann_Condensation_Scheme.png/300px-Dieckmann_Condensation_Scheme.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["radical","chemistry"],["branching","chemistry"]],"members":["branching","radical"],"related":["Peptide_bond","Chemical_reaction","Molecule","Functional_groups","Water","Hydrogen_chloride","Methanol","Acetic_acid","Intermolecular","Amino_acid","Peptide_bond","Proteins","Hydrolysis","Hydroxide","Hydrogen","Intramolecular","Dieckmann_condensation","Ester","Alcohol","Nucleophilic_acyl_substitution","Aldol_condensation","Reaction_mechanism","Acyloin_condensation","Radical_(chemistry)","Single_electron_transfer","Monomer","Step-growth_polymerization","Polyester","Nylon","Copolymer","Polyaddition","Carothers'_equation","Thermoplastic","Branching_(chemistry)","Thermoset","Polymer","Nylon","Polyester","Condensation_polymer","Epoxy","Silicate","Polyphosphate","Anhydride","Polypeptide_synthesis","Polyketide","Terpene","Phosphorylation","Glycosylation","Acyloin_condensation","Aldol_condensation","Benzoin_condensation","Claisen_condensation","Claisen-Schmidt_condensation","Darzens_condensation","Dieckmann_condensation","Guareschi-Thorpe_condensation","Knoevenagel_condensation","Michael_condensation","Pechmann_condensation","Rap-Stoermer_condensation","Self-condensation","Ziegler_condensation","Named_reactions","Anabolism","Hydrolysis","Condensed_tannin"]}
