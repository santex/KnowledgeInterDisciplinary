A single sheet within a book is called a leaf, and each side of a leaf\nis called a page. A set of text-filled or illustrated pages produced in\nelectronic format is known as an electronic book, or e-book.\n\nBooks may also refer to works of literature, or a main division of such a work.\nIn library and information science, a book is called a monograph, to distinguish\nit from serial periodicals such as magazines, journals or newspapers. The body\nof all written works including books is literature. In novels and sometimes\nother types of books (for example, biographies), a book may be divided into\nseveral large sections, also called books (Book 1, Book 2, Book 3, and so on).\nAn avid reader of books is a bibliophile or colloquially, bookworm.\n\nA shop where books are bought and sold is a bookshop or bookstore. Books can\nalso be borrowed from libraries.
