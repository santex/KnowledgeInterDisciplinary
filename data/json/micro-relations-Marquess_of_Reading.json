{"cursor":"2875","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Marquess of Reading' is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was\ncreated in 1926 for Rufus Isaacs, 1st Earl of Reading, the former Viceroy of\nIndia and Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales. He had already been created\n'Baron Reading', of Erleigh in the County of Berkshire, in 1914, 'Viscount\nReading', of Erleigh in the County of Berkshire, in 1916, and 'Viscount\nErleigh', of Erleigh in the County of Berkshire, and 'Earl of Reading', in 1917.\nThe marquessate is the highest title in the British peerage ever attained by a\nJew, and is the junior-most (i.e. most recently created) Marquessate in the\nPeerage of the United Kingdom.\n\nLord Reading was succeeded by his son, the second Marquess. He notably held\nministerial office from 1951 to 1957 in the Conservative administrations of\nWinston Churchill and Anthony Eden. the titles are held by his grandson, the\nfourth Marquess, who succeeded his father in 1980. The Isaacs family lived until\nrecently at Jaynes Court, Bisley, Gloucestershire.\n\nIn May 1804, the title of Baron Reading was offered to the outgoing Prime\nMinister, Henry Addington, who had many links with the largely pre-\nindustrialised town, as a subsidiary title of the customary retirement earldom\nfor Prime Ministers. However, Addington refused the honour, though later\naccepting a peerage as Viscount Sidmouth. See also Earl of Banbury.\n","linknr":166,"url":"Marquess_of_Reading","recorded":1362484863,"links":22,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Marquessates in the Peerage of the United Kingdom"],"headings":["Marquesses of Reading (1926)","Notes","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b7/Marquess_of_Reading_COA.svg/200px-Marquess_of_Reading_COA.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/Coronet_of_a_British_Marquess.svg/80px-Coronet_of_a_British_Marquess.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Peerage_of_the_United_Kingdom","Rufus_Isaacs,_1st_Marquess_of_Reading","Viceroy_of_India","Lord_Chief_Justice_of_England_and_Wales","Earley","Earley","Jew","Conservative_Government_1951-1957","Winston_Churchill","Anthony_Eden","Bisley,_Gloucestershire","Henry_Addington,_1st_Viscount_Sidmouth","Earldom","Viscount_Sidmouth","Earl_of_Banbury","Rufus_Isaacs,_1st_Marquess_of_Reading","Gerald_Isaacs,_2nd_Marquess_of_Reading","Simon_Isaacs,_4th_Marquess_of_Reading","Heir_apparent"]}
