It is a sturdy material that can be intricately molded,\nallowing a great level of detail with consistent texture.\n\nAdditives can be incorporated into the compound to enhance the material's\nstrength, reduce its weight, add heat stability, decorative effects, and so on.\nPolyresin is also compatible with a large range of different finishes, including\npaint and metallic finishes, which is why many decorative pieces are made from\nthis material.\n\nOne form of polyresin often used is '[[Alabastrite]]'. It is a stone-based\nmaterial, easy to sculpt, takes paint well, and has a similar appearance to\nporcelain and pottery.\n","linknr":101,"url":"Polyresin","recorded":1362481525,"links":19,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Sculpture techniques","Resins"],"headings":["See also","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/6c/Wiki_letter_w.svg/23px-Wiki_letter_w.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Resin","Statue","Figurine","Furniture","Polyester_resin","Synthetic_resin"]}
