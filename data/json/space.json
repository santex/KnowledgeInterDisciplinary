      "text" : "\n\n used to indicate positions in space.]] 'Space' is the boundless three-\n dimensional extent in which objects and events have relative position and direction.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-\n 9068962/space Britannica Online Encyclopedia: Space]</ref> Physical space is\n often conceived in three linear dimensions, although modern physicists usually\n consider it, with time, to be part of a boundless four-dimensional continuum\n known as spacetime. In mathematics, \"spaces\" are examined with different\n numbers of dimensions and with different underlying structures. The concept of\n space is considered to be of fundamental importance to an understanding of the\n physical universe. However, disagreement continues between philosophers over\n whether it is itself an entity, a relationship between entities, or part of a\n conceptual framework.\n\nDebates concerning the nature, essence and the mode of existence of space date\nback to antiquity; namely, to treatises like the Timaeus of Plato, or Socrates\nin his reflections on what the Greeks called [[khora]] (i.e. \"space\"), or in the\nPhysics of Aristotle (Book IV, Delta) in the definition of topos (i.e. place),\nor even in the later \"geometrical conception of place\" as \"space qua extension\"\nin the Discourse on Place (Qawl fi al-Makan) of the 11th-century Arab polymath\nAlhazen.<ref>Refer to Plato's Timaeus in the Loeb Classical Library, Harvard\nUniversity, and to his reflections on khora. See also Aristotle's Physics, Book\nIV, Chapter 5, on the definition of topos. Concerning Ibn al-Haytham's 11th\ncentury conception of \"geometrical place\" as \"spatial extension\", which is akin\nto Descartes' and Leibniz's 17th century notions of extensio and analysis situs,\nand his own mathematical refutation of Aristotle's definition of topos in\nnatural philosophy, refer to: Nader El-Bizri, \"In Defence of the Sovereignty of\nPhilosophy: al-Baghdadi's Critique of Ibn al-Haytham's Geometrisation of Place\",\nArabic Sciences and Philosophy: A Historical Journal (Cambridge University\nPress), Vol. 17 (2007), pp. 57-80.</ref> Many of these classical philosophical\nquestions were discussed in the Renaissance and then reformulated in the 17th\ncentury, particularly during the early development of classical mechanics. In\nIsaac Newton's view, space was absolute—in the sense that it existed permanently\nand independently of whether there were any matter in the space.<ref>French and\nEbison, Classical Mechanics, p. 1</ref> Other natural philosophers, notably\nGottfried Leibniz, thought instead that space was in fact a collection of\nrelations between objects, given by their distance and direction from one\nanother. In the 18th century, the philosopher and theologian George Berkeley\nattempted to refute the \"visibility of spatial depth\" in his Essay Towards a New\nTheory of Vision. Later, the metaphysician Immanuel Kant said neither space nor\ntime can be empirically perceived, they are elements of a systematic framework\nthat humans use to structure all experiences. Kant referred to \"space\" in his\nCritique of Pure Reason as being: a subjective \"pure [[a priori and a\nposteriori|a priori]] form of intuition\", hence it is an unavoidable\ncontribution of our human faculties.\n\nIn the 19th and 20th centuries mathematicians began to examine non-Euclidean\ngeometries, in which space can be said to be curved, rather than flat.\nAccording to Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity, space around\ngravitational fields deviates from Euclidean space.<ref>Carnap, R. An\nintroduction to the Philosophy of Science</ref> Experimental tests of general\nrelativity have confirmed that non-Euclidean space provides a better model for\nthe shape of space.\n",
