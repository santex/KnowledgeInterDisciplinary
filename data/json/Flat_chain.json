{"cursor":"1128","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Flat chain' is a form of chain used chiefly in agricultural machinery. Early\nmachinery made extensive use of flat chain. It has been gradually replaced in\nmost applications by roller chain, which is quieter, lasts longer, and requires\nless frequent retensioning.\n\nModern flat chain is made from stamped steel. Individual links can be put\ntogether or taken apart using simple tools, unlike roller chain which requires a\nmaster link or special splicing equipment.\n\nToday, flat chain is used most often for conveyor belts, because it lends itself\nwell to the attachment of slats, flights, buckets, and prongs used to move\nmaterial. Such attachments can be welded on in the field, or can be purchased\nready-made on a single link (or pair of links where the conveyor uses two\nchains) and then spliced into a loop of chain.\n\nOlder forms of flat chain were made of iron. Though the sprockets are compatible\nwith modern chain, the two types cannot be spliced together.\n","linknr":72,"url":"Flat_chain","recorded":1362476872,"links":10,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Chain drives","Mechanical power transmission"],"headings":["External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Roller_chain","Conveyor_belt","Sprocket"]}
