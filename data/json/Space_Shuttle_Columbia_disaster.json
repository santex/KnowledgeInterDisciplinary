Debris from Columbia fell to Earth in Texas. A debris\nfield has been mapped http://www.columbiassacrifice.com/images/gen_graphics-\n/debris/gnd_trk_debris_1.jpg along a path stretching from south of Fort\nWorth to Hempill, Texas, as well as into parts of\nLouisiana. http://www.columbiassacrifice.com/$B_breakup.htm\n\nThe loss of Columbia was a result of damage sustained during launch when a\npiece of foam insulation the size of a small briefcase broke off from the\nSpace Shuttle external tank (the 'ET' main propellant tank) under the\naerodynamic forces of launch. The debris struck the leading edge of the left\nwing, damaging the Shuttle's thermal protection system (TPS), which shields\nthe vehicle from the intense heat generated from atmospheric compression\nduring re-entry. While Columbia was still in orbit, some engineers suspected\ndamage, but NASA managers limited the investigation, on the grounds that\nlittle could be done even if problems were found. {{cite web|\ntitle=Columbia's Problems Began on Left Wing\n| url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/bal-wing0201,0,4910059.story|\n| publisher=Associated Press via The Baltimore Sun |author=Marcia Dunn\n| |date=February 1, 2003 }}\n\nNASA's original shuttle design specifications stated that the external tank was\nnot to shed foam or other debris; therefore, strikes upon the vehicle were\nsafety issues that needed to be resolved before a launch was cleared. Launches\nwere often given the go-ahead as engineers came to see the foam shedding and\ndebris strikes as inevitable and unresolvable, with the rationale that they were\neither not a threat to safety, or an acceptable risk. The majority of shuttle\nlaunches recorded such foam strikes and thermal tile scarring. On STS-112, two launches before, a chunk of foam broke\naway from the ET bipod ramp and hit the SRB-ET Attach Ring near the bottom of\nthe left solid rocket booster (SRB) causing a dent four inches wide and three\ninches deep in it. After that mission,\nthe situation was analyzed and NASA decided to press ahead under the\njustification that \"The ET is safe to fly with no new concerns (and no added\nrisk)\" of further foam\nstrikes, justification that was revisited while Columbia was still in orbit and\nChair of the Mission Management Team (MMT) Linda Ham re-assessed, stating that\nthe âRationale was lousy then and still isâ. Ham as well as Shuttle Program\nManager Ron Dittemore had both been present at the October 31, 2002, meeting\nwhere this decision to continue with launches was made.\n\nDuring re-entry of STS-107, the damaged area allowed hot gases to penetrate and\ndestroy the internal wing structure, rapidly causing\nthe in-flight breakup of the vehicle. An extensive ground search in parts of\nTexas, Louisiana, and Arkansas recovered crew remains and many vehicle\nfragments.\n\nMission STS-107 was the 113th Space Shuttle launch. The mission was delayed\n18 times over the two years from the\nplanned launch date of January 11, 2001, to the actual launch date of January\n16, 2003. (It was preceded by STS-113.) A launch delay due to cracks in the\nshuttle's propellant distribution system occurred one month before a July 19,\n2002, launch date. The Columbia Accident Investigation Board (CAIB) determined\nthat this delay had nothing to do with the catastrophic failure six months\nlater.\n\nThe Columbia Accident Investigation Board's recommendations addressed both\ntechnical and organizational issues. Space Shuttle flight operations were\ndelayed for over two years, similar to the delay following the ''Challenger''\naccident. Construction of the International Space Station was put on hold, and\nfor 29 months the station relied entirely on the Russian Federal Space Agency\nfor resupply until Shuttle flights resumed with STS-114 and 41 months for crew\nrotation until STS-121. Major changes to shuttle operations, after missions\nresumed, included a thorough on-orbit inspection to determine how well the\nshuttle's thermal protection system had endured the ascent, and keeping a\ndesignated rescue mission at the ready in case irreparable damage was found.\nAlso it had been decided that all missions would be flown only to the ISS so\nthat the crew could use that spacecraft as a \"safe haven\" if need be. Later NASA\ndecided it would be an acceptable risk to make one exception to that policy for\none final mission to repair the Hubble Space Telescope in its high-altitude low-\ninclination orbit.\n","linknr":1104,"url":"Space_Shuttle_Columbia_disaster","recorded":1362267883,"links":101,"instances":["mars","united_states","tv_network","supercomputer","united_states","supercomputer","united_states","2006","physics","washington","constellation_program","spacecraft"],"pdf":["http://caib.nasa.gov/news/report/pdf/vol1/chapters/chapter6.pdf","http://caib.nasa.gov/news/report/pdf/vol1/chapters/chapter6.pdf","http://aboutfacts.net/ColumbiaDocs/Debris/STS112/STS-112.6.pdf","http://aboutfacts.net/ColumbiaDocs/Debris/STS112/STS-112.6.pdf","http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/news/columbia/frr/sts-113/08_et.pdf","http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/news/columbia/frr/sts-113/08_et.pdf","http://anon.nasa-global.speedera.net/anon.nasa-global/CAIB/CAIB_lowres_chapter6.pdf","http://anon.nasa-global.speedera.net/anon.nasa-global/CAIB/CAIB_lowres_chapter6.pdf","http://caib.nasa.gov/news/report/pdf/vol1/full/caib_report_volume1.pdf","http://caib.nasa.gov/news/report/pdf/vol1/full/caib_report_volume1.pdf","http://anon.nasa-global.speedera.net/anon.nasa-global/CAIB/CAIB_lowres_chapter6.pdf","http://anon.nasa-global.speedera.net/anon.nasa-global/CAIB/CAIB_lowres_chapter6.pdf","http://caib.nasa.gov/news/report/pdf/vol1/chapters/chapter6.pdf","http://caib.nasa.gov/news/report/pdf/vol1/chapters/chapter6.pdf","http://caib.nasa.gov/news/report/pdf/vol1/chapters/chapter5.pdf","http://caib.nasa.gov/news/report/pdf/vol1/chapters/chapter5.pdf","http://caib.nasa.gov/news/report/pdf/vol1/chapters/chapter6.pdf","http://anon.nasa-global.speedera.net/anon.nasa-global/CAIB/CAIB_lowres_full.pdf","http://anon.nasa-global.speedera.net/anon.nasa-global/CAIB/CAIB_lowres_full.pdf","http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/298870main_SP-2008-565.pdf","http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/298870main_SP-2008-565.pdf","http://csel.eng.ohio-state.edu/woods/space/Create%20foresight%20Col-draft.pdf","http://csel.eng.ohio-state.edu/woods/space/Create%20foresight%20Col-draft.pdf","http://research.jsc.nasa.gov/PDF/Eng-20.pdf","http://research.jsc.nasa.gov/PDF/Eng-20.pdf","http://www.globalsecurity.org/space/library/report/2003/caib-report_vol1_chapter3.pdf","http://www.globalsecurity.org/space/library/report/2003/caib-report_vol1_chapter3.pdf","http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/298870main_SP-2008-565.pdf","http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/298870main_SP-2008-565.pdf","http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/298870main_SP-2008-565.pdf","http://anon.nasa-global.speedera.net/anon.nasa-global/CAIB/CAIB_lowres_chapter6.pdf","http://anon.nasa-global.speedera.net/anon.nasa-global/CAIB/CAIB_lowres_chapter6.pdf","http://caib.nasa.gov/news/report/pdf/vol3/part02.pdf","http://caib.nasa.gov/news/report/pdf/vol3/part02.pdf","http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/298870main_SP-2008-565.pdf"],"categories":["2003
