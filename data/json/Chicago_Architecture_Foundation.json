It is well known for its public programs, most\nnotably the docent-led architecture cruise on the Chicago River, and bus,\nwalking, bike, Segway and 'L' train tours of the Chicago-area. CAF is also known\nfor its scale model of downtown Chicago. CAF was named the\n[http://travel.usnews.com/Chicago_IL/Things_To_Do/ #1 best thing to do in\nChicago by U.S. News and World Report] in 2012.\n\nCAF offers more than 85 different tours of the city. All tours are led by highly-\ntrained volunteer docents who go through a vigorous 14-week training course\nbefore being certified to lead CAF tours. Many tours in the Loop include\nhistoric buildings such as the Chicago Board of Trade, the Marquette Building,\nthe Monadnock Building, and Daniel Burnham and John Wellborn Root's Rookery\namong many others. Some modern buildings that are explored include the Inland\nSteel Building, Mies van der Rohe's Chicago Federal Center and the Trump Tower.\nCAF also offers tours of Millennium Park. During the summer months (April-\nSeptember) CAF offers tours of various neighborhoods throughout Chicago in\naddition to Loop tours. CAF's most popular tour, the\n[http://www.architecture.org/rivercruise CAF River Cruise aboard Chicago's\nFirst Lady Cruises] has departures April-November every year. CAF offers tours\nyear-round with no tours offered on New Year's Day, Thanksgiving Day and\nChristmas Day.\n\nThe Chicago Architecture Foundation was founded in 1966 as the Chicago School\nof Architecture Foundation to save H. H. Richardson's Glessner House, one of\nChicago's oldest residences. In 1971, it began to offer lectures and volunteer-\nled tours of Chicago to the public. In 1979 it was renamed the Chicago\nArchitecture Foundation. In 2009 CAF opened a new exhibition, Chicago Model\nCity, which includes a scale model of the central area of the city and has\nproven so popular that it is now on permanent display. In\naddition, CAF provides educational material for the Chicago primary and\nsecondary school system.\n\nThe Chicago Architecture Foundation is also proud to host the largest annual\narchitecture event in the city, [http://www.openhousechicago.org Open House\nChicago (OHC)]. This free, annual event gives the public access to buildings and\nspaces around the city that are typically closed to the public. Held over a\nweekend in October, OHC attracts tens of thousands of participants from across\nthe country and around the world.\n\nCAF offers a robust architecture and design education program and has received\nseveral awards for their curricula and textbooks including\n[http://www.architecture.org/schoolyards Schoolyards to Skylines], the\n[http://www.architecture.org/architecturehandbook Architecture Handbook], and\n[http://www.discoverdesign.org discoverdesign.org].\n\nThe Chicago Architecture Foundation is located at 224 South Michigan Avenue,\nChicago in the Chicago Loop's historic Santa Fe Building. It offers exhibitions\nabout architecture, infrastructure, cities, and design. Lectures, panel\ndiscussions, education programs and architecture tours are also offered.
