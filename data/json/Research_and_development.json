The activities that are classified as R&D differ from company to\ncompany, but there are two primary models. In one model, the primary function of\nan R&D group is to develop new products; in the other model, the primary\nfunction of an R&D group is to discover and create new knowledge about\nscientific and technological topics for the purpose of uncovering and enabling\ndevelopment of valuable new products, processes, and services. Under both\nmodels, R&D differs from the vast majority of a company's activities which are\nintended to yield nearly immediate profit or immediate improvements in\noperations and involve little uncertainty as to the return on investment (ROI).\nThe first model of R&D is generally staffed by engineers while the second model\nmay be staffed with industrial scientists. R&D activities are carried out by\ncorporate or governmental entities.\n","recorded":1362124573,"portal":[],"list":[],"links":"347","instances":["transportation","historical"],"pdf":["http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R41098.pdf","http://cesis.abe.kth.se/documents/WP156.pdf","http://cesis.abe.kth.se/documents/WP156.pdf","http://csis.org/files/publication/090520_diig_aerospace.pdf","http://www.greentechhistory.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/federal-investment-in-energy-rd-2008.pdf"],"categories":["Research and development|"],"headings":["Background","Business","R&D alliance","United States Federal Government","European Union","See also","Notes","External links"],"tags":[["productivity_improving_technologies","historical"],["traffic_engineering","transportation"]],"image":["http://en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b1/Ambox_outdated_content.svg/42px-Ambox_outdated_content.svg.png","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Cycle_of_Research_and_Development.gif","http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/63/Cycle_of_Research_and_Development.gif/200px-Cycle_of_Research_and_Development.gif","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Cycle_of_Research_and_Development.gif","http://bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Symbol_book_class2.svg/16px-Symbol_book_class2.svg.png","http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/12px-Commons-logo.svg.png","http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg/16px-Portal-puzzle.svg.png","http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg/16px-Wikiquote-logo.svg.png","http://bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","http://bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"related":["New_product_development","Return_on_investment","Engineer","Applied_science","Strategic_alliances","Acquisitions","Marketing","Contract_research_organization","Universities","Sovereign_state","Commerce","Science","Technology","Science","Statistics","Industry","Competition","Scientific_progress","Budget","Patent","Publication","Allergan","Biotech","Pharmaceutical_company","Merck_&_Co.","Novartis","Ericsson","Gross_profit","Amortizing_loan","Center_for_Strategic_and_International_Studies","Seventh_Framework_Programme","Basic_research","Technology_demonstration","Innovation","List_of_countries_by_research_and_development_spending","List_of_business_and_finance_abbreviations","Research","Science_of_science_policy","Science_policy","Technology_life_cycle","Neglected_Tropical_Disease_Research_and_Development"],"members":["traffic_engineering","productivity_improving_technologies"],"book":[]}
