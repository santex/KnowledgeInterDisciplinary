{"cursor":"4826","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n The 'All Red Line' was an\ninformal name for the system of electrical telegraphs that linked much of the\nBritish Empire. It was inaugurated on 31 October 1902. It had this name because\non many political maps, British Empire territory was coloured red (or pink).\n\nSome parts of the line were completed considerably earlier. The first\ntransatlantic cable connected Ireland and Newfoundland in 1858, although it\nlater failed. In 1866, the [[SS Great Eastern|Great Eastern]] laid out a lasting\nlink from Valentia Island, in Ireland, to Newfoundland. By 1870, Suez was linked\nto Bombay and from there to Madras, Penang and Singapore. Australia was linked\nto British telegraph cables directly in 1870, by extending a line from Singapore\nto Port Darwin, although it ran through the Dutch territory of Java. By 1872,\nmessages could be sent direct from London to Adelaide and Sydney. Australia was\nlinked to New Zealand by cable in 1876.\n\nTo complete the All Red Line, therefore, the final major cable laying project\nwas the trans-Pacific section. A resolution supporting such a project was passed\nby the First Colonial Conference in 1887 and more detailed plans were approved\nat the 1894 Colonial Conference in Ottawa which was called specifically on the\ntopic of the cable project. The \"Pacific Cable Committee\" was formed in 1896 to\nconsider the proposal and in 1901 the \"Pacific Cable Board\" was formed with\neight members: three from Britain, two from Canada, two from Australia and one\nfrom New Zealand. Funding for the project was shared between the British,\nCanadian, New Zealand, New South Wales, Victorian and Queensland governments. In\n1902 the [[Colonia (ship)|Colonia]], a newly built cable vessel, began laying\nthe 8000 tonnes of cable needed to complete the Bamfield, Canada, to Fanning\nIsland section of the cable. The final cost was around 2 million pounds.\n\nOriginally, the British government felt the All Red system should have sea-\nlandings only on British controlled soil for security purposes. Due to this,\nBritain was actively seeking to acquire Fanning Island to use it as a midpoint\nof power regeneration between Western Canada and Australia on the trans-Pacific\nOcean branch of the system.\n\nIn 1911 the Committee on Imperial Defence stated in a report that the All Red\nLine was complete. The network had so many redundancies that 49 cuts would be\nneeded to isolate the United Kingdom; 15 for Canada; and 5 for South Africa.\nMany colonies such as South Africa and India also had many land lines. Britain\nalso possessed the majority of the world's underwater-telegraph deployment and\nrepair equipment and expertise, and a monopoly of the gutta-percha insulation\nfor underwater lines. The 1911 report stated that the Imperial Wireless Chain\nshould only be a \"valuable reserve\" to the All Red Line, because enemies could\ninterrupt or intercept radio messages. Despite its great cost the telegraph\nnetwork succeeded in its purpose; British communications remained uninterrupted\nduring World War I, while Britain quickly succeeded in cutting Germany's\nworldwide network.\n","linknr":155,"url":"All_Red_Line","recorded":1375060611,"links":["/w/index.php?title=All_Red_Line&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=All_Red_Line&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=All_Red_Line&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Template:Citation_needed","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/Electrical_telegraph","/wiki/British_Empire","/wiki/Transatlantic_telegraph_cable","/wiki/Colony_of_Newfoundland","/wiki/SS_Great_Eastern","/wiki/Valentia_Island","/wiki/Bombay","/wiki/Madras","/wiki/Penang","/wiki/Singapore","/wiki/Australia","/wiki/Port_Darwin","/wiki/Java","/wiki/Adelaide","/wiki/Sydney","/wiki/New_Zealand","/wiki/Pacific","/wiki/First_Colonial_Conference","/wiki/1894_Colonial_Conference","/w/index.php?title=Colonia_(ship)&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Bamfield,_British_Columbia","/wiki/Fanning_Island","/wiki/Fanning_Island","/wiki/Committee_on_Imperial_Defence","/wiki/Gutta-percha","/wiki/Imperial_Wireless_Chain","/wiki/World_War_I","#cite_note-kennedy197110-1","#Routes","#See_also","#External_links","#References","/w/index.php?title=All_Red_Line&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/File:All_Red_Line.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/All_Red_Line.jpg/460px-All_Red_Line.jpg","/wiki/File:All_Red_Line.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean","/wiki/Great_Britain","/wiki/Ireland","/wiki/Canada","/wiki/Saint_Helena","/wiki/Ascension_Island","/wiki/Barbados","/wiki/Bermuda","/wiki/Pacific_Ocean","/wiki/Bamfield","/wiki/Canada","/wiki/Tabuaeran","/wiki/Fiji","/wiki/Norfolk_Island","/wiki/New_Zealand","/wiki/Australia","/wiki/Brisbane","/wiki/Australia","/wiki/Hong_Kong","/wiki/Indian_Ocean","/wiki/Perth,_Western_Australia","/wiki/Australia","/wiki/Keeling_Islands","/wiki/India","/wiki/Africa","/wiki/Mauritius","/wiki/South_Africa","/wiki/Durban","/wiki/Cape_Town","/w/index.php?title=All_Red_Line&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/All-Red_Route","/w/index.php?title=All_Red_Line&action=edit&section=3","http://atlantic-cable.com/Maps/index.htm","http://www.empireclubfoundation.com/details.asp?SpeechID=2617&FT=yes","/wiki/Sandford_Fleming","http://www.iscpc.org/information/gentsea.htm","/w/index.php?title=All_Red_Line&action=edit&section=4","#cite_ref-kennedy197110_1-0","http://www.jstor.org/stable/563928","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=All_Red_Line&oldid=552797448","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:British_Empire","/wiki/Category:Telegraphy","/wiki/Category:Articles_needing_additional_references_from_November_2007","/wiki/Category:All_articles_needing_additional_references","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=All+Red+Line&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=All+Red+Line","/wiki/All_Red_Line","/wiki/Talk:All_Red_Line","#","/wiki/All_Red_Line","/w/index.php?title=All_Red_Line&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=All_Red_Line&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/All_Red_Line","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/All_Red_Line","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=All_Red_Line&oldid=552797448","/w/index.php?title=All_Red_Line&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2837523","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=All_Red_Line&id=552797448","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=All+Red+Line","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=
