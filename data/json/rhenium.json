      "text" : "\n\n\n'Rhenium' is a chemical element with the symbol 'Re' and atomic number 75. It is\na silvery-white, heavy, third-row transition metal in group 7 of the periodic\ntable. With an estimated average concentration of 1 part per billion (ppb),\nrhenium is one of the rarest elements in the Earth's crust. The free element has\nthe third-highest melting point and highest boiling point of any element.\nRhenium resembles manganese chemically and is obtained as a by-product of\nmolybdenum and copper ore's extraction and refinement. Rhenium shows in its\ncompounds a wide variety of oxidation states ranging from âˆ’1 to +7.\n\nDiscovered in 1925, rhenium was the last stable element to be discovered. It was\nnamed after the river Rhine in Europe.\n\nNickel-based superalloys of rhenium are used in the combustion chambers, turbine\nblades, and exhaust nozzles of jet engines. These alloys contain up to 6%\nrhenium, making jet engine construction the largest single use for the element,\nwith the chemical industry's catalytic uses being next-most important. Because\nof the low availability relative to demand, rhenium is among the most expensive\nof metals, with an average price of approximately US$4,575 per kilogram\n(US$142.30 per troy ounce) as of August 2011; it is also of critical strategic\nmilitary importance, for its use in high performance military jet and rocket\nengines.<ref></ref>\n",
