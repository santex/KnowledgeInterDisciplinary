The\ntumor cells always stay on the outside of the nerve, but the tumor itself may\neither push the nerve aside and/or up against a bony structure (thereby possibly\ncausing damage). Schwannomas are relatively slow growing. For reasons not yet\nunderstood, schwannomas are mostly benign and less than 1% become malignant,\ndegenerating into a form of cancer known as neurofibrosarcoma.\n\nSchwannomas can arise from a genetic disorder called neurofibromatosis. They are\nuniversally S-100 positive.\n\nSchwannomas can be removed surgically, but can then recur.\n",
