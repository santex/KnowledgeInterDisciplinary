It provides updated texts of every Public General Act of the Parliament\nof the United Kingdom, Measure of the Welsh Assembly, or Church of England\nMeasure currently in force in England and Wales (and to various extents in\nScotland and Northern Ireland), as well as a number of private and local Acts,\nwith detailed annotations to each section and Schedule of each Act. It\nincorporates the effects of new Acts of Parliament and secondary legislation\ninto existing legislation to provide a consolidated \"as amended\" text of the\ncurrent statute book.\n\nHalsburyâs Statutes was created in 1929. The full title of this major work was\nThe Complete Statutes of England Classified and Annotated in Continuation of\n[[Halsburyâs Laws of England]] and for ready reference entitled Halsburyâs\nStatutes of England. The new work was to be a companion to ''Halsburyâs Laws''\nand therefore bears the name of Lord Halsbury.\n\nThe first edition, in twenty volumes, appeared between 1929 and 1931. The new\nencyclopedia was based on the design of the earlier Butterworthsâ Twentieth\nCentury Statutes (Annotated), a work in five volumes covering the Acts of 1900\nto 1909, which had been kept up to date by annual supplemental volumes. Like its\ncompanion, ''Halsbury's Laws'', it was arranged by subject matter. This new\nwork, however, expanded on the previous statutory work in that it included all\nprimary legislation in force at the time of publication.\n\nThe second edition in 33 volumes was published from 1948 to 1954. John S\nJames and Leslie F Maxwell. A Bibliography of the British Commonwealth of\nNations. Second Edition. Sweet & Maxwell. 1957. Volume 2. Page 152.\n\nThe current edition (the fourth), in fifty volumes, was published between 1985\nand 1992, and is supplemented by an annual hardbound supplement and periodic loose-\nleaf updates. It is published by LexisNexis Butterworths. Individual\nvolumes are reissued when there has been a significant impact on the subject\nmatter concerned through changes in legislation.\n\nThe complete set consists of the main volumes, the index, tables of statutes,\nsecondary legislation and cases, the annual Cumulative Supplement and the\nquarterly looseleaf service. Halsbury's Statutes is also available as a\nsearchable electronic archive on a paid subscription basis.\n","linknr":105,"url":"Halsbury's_Statutes","recorded":1375055839,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Halsbury%27s_Statutes&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Halsbury%27s_Statutes&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/ae/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg/22px-Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png","/wiki/United_Kingdom","/wiki/English_language","/wiki/Law","/wiki/LexisNexis_Butterworths","/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Welsh_Assembly","/wiki/Church_of_England","/wiki/England","/wiki/Wales","/wiki/Scotland","/wiki/Northern_Ireland","/wiki/Statute_book","/wiki/Halsbury%E2%80%99s_Laws_of_England","/wiki/Halsbury%27s_Laws_of_England","/wiki/Hardinge_Giffard,_1st_Earl_of_Halsbury","/wiki/Halsbury%27s_Laws_of_England","#cite_note-1","/wiki/LexisNexis_Butterworths","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Looseleaf_service","/w/index.php?title=Halsbury%27s_Statutes&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Is_it_in_Force%3F","/w/index.php?title=Halsbury%27s_Statutes_Citator&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Destination_Tables","/wiki/Halsbury%27s_Laws_of_England","/wiki/Halsbury%27s_Statutory_Instruments","/w/index.php?title=Halsbury%27s_Statutes&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-1","/w/index.php?title=A_Bibliography_of_the_British_Commonwealth_of_Nations&action=edit&redlink=1","#cite_ref-2","http://www.lexisnexis.co.uk/hssi/index.htm","/w/index.php?title=Halsbury%27s_Statutes&action=edit&section=3","http://www.wildy.co.uk/isbn/0406047537/halsbury's_statutes_of_england_and_wales.html","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Halsbury%27s_Statutes&oldid=546061983","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1929_books","/wiki/Category:Law_books","/wiki/Category:English_law","/wiki/Category:Encyclopedias_of_law","/wiki/Category:British_encyclopedias","/wiki/Category:Books_with_missing_cover","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Halsbury%27s+Statutes&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Halsbury%27s+Statutes","/wiki/Halsbury%27s_Statutes","/wiki/Talk:Halsbury%27s_Statutes","#","/wiki/Halsbury%27s_Statutes","/w/index.php?title=Halsbury%27s_Statutes&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Halsbury%27s_Statutes&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Halsbury%27s_Statutes","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Halsbury%27s_Statutes","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Halsbury%27s_Statutes&oldid=546061983","/w/index.php?title=Halsbury%27s_Statutes&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Halsbury%27s_Statutes&id=546061983","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Halsbury%27s+Statutes","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Halsbury%27s+Statutes&oldid=546061983&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Halsbury%27s_Statutes&printable=yes","#","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halsbury%27s_Statutes","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scri
