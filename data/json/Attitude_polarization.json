{"cursor":"9344","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Attitude polarization', also known as 'belief polarization', is a phenomenon in\nwhich a disagreement becomes more extreme as the different parties consider\nevidence on the issue. It is one of the effects of [[confirmation bias]]: the\ntendency of people to search for and interpret evidence selectively, to\nreinforce their current beliefs or attitudes. Fine 2006a When people\nencounter ambiguous evidence, this bias can potentially result in each of them\ninterpreting it as in support of their existing attitudes, widening rather than\nnarrowing the disagreement between them. Lord, ''et al.''\n1979\n\nThe effect is observed with issues that activate emotions, such as political\n\"hot button\" issues. For most issues, new\nevidence does not produce a polarization effect. For\nthose issues where polarization is found, mere thinking about the issue, without\ncontemplating new evidence, produces the effect. Social\ncomparison processes have also been invoked as an explanation for the effect,\nwhich is increased by settings in which people repeat and validate each other's\nstatements. This apparent tendency is of interest not only to\npsychologists, but also to sociologists Baldassarri & Bearman 2006 and\nphilosophers.
