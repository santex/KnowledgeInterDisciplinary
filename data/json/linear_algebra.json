      "text" : "\n{{multiple issues|\n\n\n}}\n\n 'R'<sup>3</sup> is a vector space, and lines and planes passing through the\n origin are vector subspaces in 'R'<sup>3</sup>.]] 'Linear algebra' is the\n branch of mathematics concerning vector spaces, often finite or countably\n infinite dimensional, as well as linear mappings between such spaces. Such an\n investigation is initially motivated by a system of linear equations in several\n unknowns. Such equations are naturally represented using the formalism of\n matrices and vectors.<ref></ref>\n\nLinear algebra is central to both pure and applied mathematics. For instance,\nabstract algebra arises by relaxing the axioms of a vector space, leading to a\nnumber of generalizations. Functional analysis studies the infinite-dimensional\nversion of the theory of vector spaces. Combined with calculus, linear algebra\nfacilitates the solution of linear systems of differential equations. Techniques\nfrom linear algebra are also used in analytic geometry, engineering, physics,\nnatural sciences, computer science, computer animation, and the social sciences\n(particularly in economics). Because linear algebra is such a well-developed\ntheory, nonlinear mathematical models are sometimes approximated by linear ones.\n",
