The Museum opened its doors to the public on May 28, 2007.\n\nThe museum has been criticized as promoting \"fallacy over fact\" and attempting\nto advance the tenets of a particular religious view while rejecting,\noverlooking and misconstruing scientific knowledge. The museum has received\ncriticism from the scientific community, several groups of educators, Christian\ngroups opposed to young earth creationism, and in the press.
