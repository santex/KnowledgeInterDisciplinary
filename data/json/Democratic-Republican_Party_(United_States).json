It stood in opposition to the Federalist\nParty and controlled the Presidency and Congress, and most states, from 1801 to\n1824, during the First Party System. It split after the 1824 presidential\nelection into two parties: the Democratic Party and the short-lived National\nRepublican Party (later succeeded by the Whig Party, many of whose adherents\neventually founded the modern Republican Party).\n\nMost contemporaries called it the 'Republican Party'. Today, political\nscientists typically use the hyphenated version while historians usually call it\nthe 'Jeffersonian Republicans', to distinguish it from the modern Republican\nParty, which was founded in 1854 and named after Jefferson's party.\n\nThe organization formed first as an \"Anti-Administration\" secret meeting in the\nnational capital (Philadelphia) to oppose the programs of Secretary of the\nTreasury Alexander Hamilton. Jefferson needed to have a nationwide party to\ncounteract the Federalists, a nationwide party organized by Hamilton. Foreign\naffairs took a leading role in 1794-95 as the Republicans vigorously opposed the\nJay Treaty with Britain, which was then at war with France. Republicans saw\nFrance as more democratic after its revolution, while Britain represented the\nhated monarchy. The party denounced many of Hamilton's measures (especially the\nnational bank) as unconstitutional.\n\nThe party was strongest in the South and weakest in the Northeast; it favored\nstates' rights and the primacy of the yeoman farmers. Republicans were deeply\ncommitted to the principles of republicanism, which they feared were\nthreatened by the supposed monarchical tendencies of the\nHamiltonians/Federalists. The party came to power with the election of\nJefferson in 1801. The Federalistsâtoo elitist to appeal to most peopleâfaded\naway, and totally collapsed after 1815. The Republicans, despite internal\ndivisions, dominated the First Party System until partisanship itself withered\naway during the Era of Good Feelings after 1816.\n\nThe party selected its presidential candidates in a caucus of members of\nCongress. They included Thomas Jefferson (nominated 1796; elected 1800-1, 1804),\nJames Madison (1808, 1812), James Monroe (1816, 1820). By 1824 the caucus system\npractically collapsed. After 1800, the party dominated Congress and most state\ngovernments outside New England. By 1824 the party was split 4 ways and lacked a\ncenter. One remnant followed Andrew Jackson and Martin Van Buren into the new\nDemocratic Party by 1828. That party still exists. Another remnant led by John\nQuincy Adams and Henry Clay formed the National Republicans in 1828; It held its\nfirst convention in late 1831 in Baltimore. It morphed into the Whig Party by\n1835. The Whig Party fell apart in the mid-1850s because it could not bridge North-\nSouth differences on slavery, while the Democrats held together by taking\npositions favored by the South.\n","linknr":475,"url":"Democratic-Republican_Party_(United_States)","recorded":1375088188,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Democratic-Republican_Party&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Democratic-Republican_Party&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","/wiki/Democratic-Republican_Party","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","/w/index.php?title=Democratic-Republican_Party_(United_States)&redirect=no","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Democratic_Republican_Party_(South_Korea)","/wiki/Anti-Administration_Party","/wiki/National_Republican_Party","/wiki/Jacksonian_Party","/wiki/List_of_political_ideologies","/wiki/Republicanism_in_the_United_States","/wiki/Jeffersonian_democracy","/wiki/States%27_rights","/wiki/Agrarianism","/wiki/Isolationism","/wiki/Nationalism","/wiki/Tertium_quids","/wiki/Politics_of_United_States","/wiki/List_of_political_parties_in_United_States","/wiki/Elections_in_United_States","/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson","/wiki/James_Madison","/wiki/Federalist_Party","/wiki/First_Party_System","/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1824","/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)","/wiki/National_Republican_Party","/wiki/Whig_Party_(United_States)","/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)","/wiki/History_of_the_Republican_Party_(United_States)","/wiki/Philadelphia","/wiki/Alexander_Hamilton","/wiki/Federalist_Party","/wiki/Jay_Treaty","/wiki/First_Bank_of_the_United_States","/wiki/States%27_rights","/wiki/Yeoman#United_States","/wiki/Republicanism_in_the_United_States","/wiki/First_Party_System","/wiki/Era_of_Good_Feelings","/wiki/James_Monroe","/wiki/New_England","/wiki/Andrew_Jackson","/wiki/Martin_Van_Buren","/wiki/History_of_the_Democratic_Party_(United_States)","/wiki/John_Quincy_Adams","/wiki/Henry_Clay","/wiki/National_Republican_Party_(United_States)","/wiki/Whig_Party_(United_States)","#Founding","#Presidential_elections_of_1792_and_1796","#Party_strength_in_Congress","#Organizational_strategy","#Revolution_of_1800","#Monroe_and_Adams.2C_1816.E2.80.931828","#Party_name","#Party_legacy","#Party_Presidents","#Candidates","#See_also","#Notes","#References","#Biographies","#State_studies","#Newspapers","#Primary_sources","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Democratic-Republican_Party&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/File:Thomas_Jefferson_3x4.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/de/Thomas_Jefferson_3x4.jpg/141px-Thomas_Jefferson_3x4.jpg","/wiki/File:James_Madison_140x190.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e4/James_Madison_140x190.jpg","#cite_note-1","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Strict_constructionism","/wiki/United_States_Constitution","#cite_note-3","/w/index.php?title=Democratic-Republican_Party&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/John_Beckley","/wiki/John_Jay","/wiki/George_Clinton_(vice_president)","#cite_note-4","/wiki/John_Adams","/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1796","/wiki/Aaron_Burr","/wiki/John_Adams","/wiki/Alien_and_Sedition_Acts","/wiki/Kentucky_and_Virginia_Resolutions","/wiki/States%27_rights","#cite_note-5","#cite_note-6","/wiki/Jay_Treaty","#cite_note-7","/w/index.php?title=Democratic-Republican_Party&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/Albert_Gallatin","/wiki/Quasi-War","#cite_note-8","/w/index.php?title=Democratic-Republican_Party&action=edit&section=4","/wiki/History_of_American_newspapers","#cite_note-9","/wiki/Fisher_Ames","/wiki/Jacobin_(politics)","/wiki/French_Revolution","#cite_note-10","/wiki/William_Duane","/wiki/Albert_Gallatin","/wiki/Thomas_Cooper_(US_politician)","#cite_note-11","/wiki/John_J._Beckley","#cite_note-12","#cite_note-13","/w/index.php?title=Democratic-Republican_Party&action=edit&section=5","/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1800","/wiki/Aaron_Burr","/wiki/Second_Bank_of_the_United_States","/wiki/John_Adams","/wiki/War_of_1812","/wiki/Hartford_Convention","/w/index.php?title=Democratic-Republican_Party&action=edit&section=6","/wiki/Philadelphia","/wiki/Scots-Irish_American","#cite_note-14","/wiki/War_of_1812","/wiki/Era_of_Good_Feelings","/wiki/William_H._Crawford","/wiki/Rufus_King","/wiki/James_Monroe","/wiki/U.S._presidential_election,_1820","/wiki/U.S._presidential_election,_1824","/wiki/William_H._Crawford","/wiki/Henry_Clay","/wiki/John_C._Calhoun","#cite_note-15","/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1824","/
