{"cursor":"61676","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Protein structure prediction' is the prediction of the three-dimensional\nstructure of a protein from its amino acid sequence â that is, the prediction of\nits secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structure from its primary structure.\nStructure prediction is fundamentally different from the inverse problem of\nprotein design. Protein structure prediction is one of the most important goals\npursued by bioinformatics and theoretical chemistry; it is highly important in\nmedicine (for example, in drug design) and biotechnology (for example, in the\ndesign of novel enzymes). Every two years, the performance of current methods is\nassessed in the CASP experiment (Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein\nStructure Prediction). A continuous evaluation of protein structure prediction\nweb servers is performed by the community project CAMEO.\n","linknr":797,"url":"Protein_structure_prediction","recorded":1362509772,"links":27,"instances":["protein","biochemistry","genetics","software","biology","computing","benchmark"],"pdf":["http://www.excli.de/vol8/lakizadeh_03_2009/lakizadeh_250309a_proof.pdf","http://www.excli.de/vol8/lakizadeh_03_2009/lakizadeh_250309a_proof.pdf"],"categories":["Bioinformatics","Protein structure","Protein methods"],"headings":["Protein structure and terminology","Protein classification","Secondary structure","Tertiary structure","Quaternary structure","Software","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d0/Fipsi.png/200px-Fipsi.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/75/Alpha_helix.png/100px-Alpha_helix.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/b/c/c/bccfc7022dfb945174d9bcebad2297bb.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/7/1/071997f13634882f823041b057f90923.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/f/2/7f20aa0b3691b496aec21cf356f63e04.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/1/9/d/19df1c2726ed43128440c1157f72a937.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["turn","biochemistry"],["dssp","protein"],["benchmark","computing"],["eva","benchmark"],["conservation","genetics"],["homology","biology"],["turn","biochemistry"],["homology","biology"],["homology","biology#homology_of_sequences_in_genetics"],["self-consistent_mean_field","biology"],["raptor","software"]],"members":["dssp","turn","conservation","raptor","homology","benchmark","eva"],"related":["Protein","Amino_acid","Protein_secondary_structure","Protein_tertiary_structure","Protein_quaternary_structure","Protein_primary_structure","Protein_design","Bioinformatics","Theoretical_chemistry","Medicine","Drug_design","Biotechnology","Enzymes","CASP","CAMEO","Ramachandran_plot","Introns","Databases","Structural_Classification_of_Proteins","Protein_Information_Resource","Families_of_structurally_similar_proteins","Protein_Information_Resource","Hidden_markov_model","Bioinformatics","Secondary_structure","Protein","RNA","Amino_acid","Nucleotide","Alpha_helix","Beta_sheet","Turn_(biochemistry)","DSSP_(protein)","X-ray_crystallography","Hydrogen_bond","Transmembrane_helix","Coiled_coil","MicroRNA","Fold_recognition","Ab_initio","Structural_motif","Sequence_alignment","Benchmark_(computing)","LiveBench","EVA_(benchmark)","Helix-coil_transition_model","Evolution","Conservation_(genetics)","Homology_(biology)","Multiple_sequence_alignment","Machine_learning","Artificial_neural_network","Support_vector_machine","Globular_protein","Tertiary_structure","Chou-Fasman_method","GOR_method","Information_theory","Bayesian_inference","Conditional_probability","Proline","Glycine","Artificial_neural_network","Hydrogen_bonding","Support_vector_machine","Turn_(biochemistry)","Protein_backbone","Dihedral_angle","Contact_number","Homology_(biology)","Evolution","NP-complete","DNA","Human_Genome_Project","Structural_genomics","X-ray_crystallography","Protein_NMR","Gibbs_free_energy","Energy_minimization","Levinthal's_paradox","Homology_modeling","Fold_recognition","De_novo_protein_structure_prediction","Protein_folding","Stochastic","Global_optimization","Blue_Gene","MDGRAPE-3","Folding@home","Human_Proteome_Folding_Project","Rosetta@Home","Protein_contact_map","Tertiary_structure","Structural_motif","Homology_modeling","Sequence_alignment","Protein_threading","Side_chain","Dead-end_elimination","Self-consistent_mean_field_(biology)","Rotamer","Structural_bioinformatics","Frederic_M._Richards","Hydrophobic","Pseudo_amino_acid_composition","Protein_complex","Macromolecular_docking","HHpred_/_HHsearch","HH-suite","RaptorX_/_software_for_protein_modeling_and_analysis","MODELLER","Protein_NMR","Phyre_/_Phyre2","RAPTOR_(software)","Molecular_Dynamics","Water_model","Distributed_computing","Folding@home","Rosetta@home","Human_Proteome_Folding_Project","Predictor@home","TANPAKU","Foldit","CASP","CAMEO","Protein_design","Protein_function_prediction","Protein_structure_prediction_software","De_novo_protein_structure_prediction","Molecular_design_software","List_of_software_for_molecular_mechanics_modeling","Modelling_biological_systems","Protein_fragment_library","Lattice_protein","Statistical_potential"]}
