The name may also mean an ester of carbonic\nacid, an organic compound containing the 'carbonate [[functional group|group]]'\nC(=O)(O–) 2.\n\nThe term is also used as a verb, to describe carbonation: the process of raising\nthe concentrations of carbonate and bicarbonate ions in water to produce\ncarbonated water and other carbonated beverages â either by the addition of\ncarbon dioxide gas under pressure, or by dissolving carbonate or bicarbonate\nsalts into the water.\n\nIn geology and mineralogy, the term \"carbonate\" can refer both to carbonate\nminerals and carbonate rock (which is made of chiefly carbonate minerals), and\nboth are dominated by the carbonate ion, CO. Carbonate minerals are extremely\nvaried and ubiquitous in chemically precipitated sedimentary rock. The most\ncommon are calcite or calcium carbonate, CaCO 3, the chief constituent\nof limestone (as well as the main component of mollusc shells and coral\nskeletons); dolomite, a calcium-magnesium carbonate\nCaMg(CO 3) 2; and siderite, or iron(II) carbonate,\nFeCO 3, an important iron ore. Sodium carbonate (\"soda\" or \"natron\")\nand potassium carbonate (\"potash\") have been used since antiquity for cleaning\nand preservation, as well as for the manufacture of glass. Carbonates are widely\nused in industry, e.g. in iron smelting, as a raw material for Portland cement\nand lime manufacture, in the composition of ceramic glazes, and more.\n","linknr":295,"url":"Carbonate","recorded":1362482414,"links":59,"instances":["chemistry","geology","chemistry","unit","mineral"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Carbonates|","Oxoanions"],"headings":["Structure and bonding","Chemical properties","Organic carbonates","Biological significance","Carbonate salts","Presence outside Earth","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0b/Carbonate-3D-balls.png/200px-Carbonate-3D-balls.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/Carbonate-ion-localised-2D.png/100px-Carbonate-ion-localised-2D.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Carbonate-ion-resonance-2D.png/400px-Carbonate-ion-resonance-2D.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/db/Carbonate-ion-delocalised-partial-charges-2D.png/120px-Carbonate-ion-delocalised-partial-charges-2D.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Carbonate-3D-vdW.png/80px-Carbonate-3D-vdW.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/Equilibrium.svg/15px-Equilibrium.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/Equilibrium.svg/15px-Equilibrium.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/Equilibrium.svg/15px-Equilibrium.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["salt","chemistry"],["lime","mineral"],["dalton","unit"],["resonance","chemistry"],["rock","geology"]],"members":["salt","rock","resonance","dalton","lime"],"related":["Salt_(chemistry)","Carbonic_acid","Ester","Carbonation","Bicarbonate","Carbonated_water","Carbon_dioxide","Geology","Mineralogy","Carbonate_minerals","Carbonate_rock","Sedimentary_rock","Calcite","Calcium_carbonate","Limestone","Mollusc","Coral","Dolomite","Siderite","Iron","Iron_ore","Sodium_carbonate","Potassium_carbonate","Glass","Portland_cement","Lime_(mineral)","Ceramic_glaze","Oxocarbon_anion","Carbon","Oxygen","Trigonal_planar","Dalton_(unit)","Formal_charge","Conjugate_acid","Bicarbonate","Lewis_structure","Isoelectronic","Nitrate","Resonance_(chemistry)","Delocalization","Calcination","Quicklime","Calcium_oxide","Lime_kiln","Chemical_compound","Solubility","Water","Standard_temperature_and_pressure","Solubility_constant","Lithium_carbonate","Sodium_carbonate","Potassium_carbonate","Ammonium_carbonate","Uranium_carbonate","Aqueous_solution","Chemical_equilibrium","Bicarbonate","Carbon_dioxide","Sodium_carbonate","Sodium_bicarbonate","Hard_water","Carbonated_water","Carbonic_anhydrase","Organic_chemistry","Functional_group","Dimethyl_carbonate","Ethylene_carbonate","Propylene_carbonate","Triphosgene","Buffer_solution","Le_Chatelier's_principle","Cellular_respiration","Rock_(geology)","Planetary_nebula","NGC_6302","Carbonates_on_Mars","Gusev_crater","Meridiani_Planum","Oxalate","Sodium_percarbonate","Peroxocarbonate"]}
