It is an allotrope of oxygen that is much less stable\nthan the diatomic allotrope (O 2), breaking down in the lower\natmosphere to normal dioxygen. Ozone is formed from dioxygen by the action of\nultraviolet light and also atmospheric electrical discharges, and is present in\nlow concentrations throughout the Earth's atmosphere. In total, ozone makes up\nonly 0.6 parts per million of the atmosphere.\n\nOzone was proposed as a new substance in air in 1840, and named, even before its\nchemical nature was known, after the Greek verb ozein (á½Î¶ÎµÎ¹Î½, \"to smell\"), from\nthe peculiar odor after lightning storms. Ozone's odor is sharp, reminiscent of\nchlorine, and detectable by many people at concentrations of as little as 10\nparts per billion in air. Ozone's O 3 formula was determined in 1865.\nThe molecule was later proven to have a bent structure and to be diamagnetic. In\nstandard conditions, ozone is a pale blue gas that condenses at progressively\ncryogenic temperatures to a dark blue liquid and finally a violet-black solid.\nOzone's instability with regard to more common dioxygen is such that both\nconcentrated gas and liquid ozone may decompose explosively. It is therefore\nused commercially only in low concentrations.\n\nOzone is a powerful oxidant (far more so than dioxygen) and has many industrial\nand consumer applications related to oxidation. This same high oxidizing\npotential, however, causes ozone to damage mucus and respiratory tissues in\nanimals, and also tissues in plants, above concentrations of about 100 parts per\nbillion. This makes ozone a potent respiratory hazard and pollutant near ground\nlevel. However, the so-called ozone layer (a portion of the stratosphere with a\nhigher concentration of ozone, from two to eight ppm) is beneficial, preventing\ndamaging ultraviolet light from reaching the Earth's surface, to the benefit of\nboth plants and animals.\n","linknr":1101,"url":"Ozone","recorded":1362477516,"links":133,"instances":["chemistry","microbiology","united_states","electric","chemistry","concentration","physics","unit","chemistry","chemical","electric","chemistry"],"pdf":["http://www.scs.uiuc.edu/~mainzv/HIST/awards/OPA%20Papers/2001-Rubin.pdf","http://www.scs.uiuc.edu/~mainzv/HIST/awards/OPA%20Papers/2001-Rubin.pdf","http://www.iitk.ac.in/che/jpg/papersb/full%20papers/K-106.pdf","http://www.iitk.ac.in/che/jpg/papersb/full%20papers/K-106.pdf","http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/112199/E79097.pdf","http://www.euro.who.int/document/E82790.pdf","http://www.epa.gov/air/ozonepollution/fr/20100119.pdf","http://arcsuppressiontechnologies.com/Documents/Lab%20Note%20106%20-%20APR2011%20-%20Environmental%20Impact.pdf","http://arcsuppressiontechnologies.com/Documents/Lab%20Note%20106%20-%20APR2011%20-%20Environmental%20Impact.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20110715132442/http://www.purityintl.com/Article%20POU.pdf","http://www.purityintl.com/Article%20POU.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20110715132442/http://www.purityintl.com/Article%20POU.pdf","http://water.epa.gov/lawsregs/rulesregs/sdwa/mdbp/upload/2001_07_13_mdbp_alternative_disinfectants_guidance.pdf","http://water.epa.gov/lawsregs/rulesregs/sdwa/mdbp/upload/2001_07_13_mdbp_alternative_disinfectants_guidance.pdf"],"categories":["Ozone|","Environmental
