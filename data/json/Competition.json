[http://www.sociologyguide.com/basic-\nconcepts/Competition.php Competition], Sociology guide It arises whenever\nat least two parties strive for a goal which cannot be shared or which is\ndesired individually but not in sharing and cooperation. Competition occurs\nnaturally between living organisms which co-exist in the same environment. Keddy, P.A. 2001.\n\n Competition (2 nd edition) Kluwer, Dordrecht. 552 p. For example, animals\n compete over water supplies, food, mates, and other biological resources.\n Humans compete usually for food and mates, though when these needs are met deep\n rivalries often arise over the pursuit of wealth, prestige, and fame.\n Competition is also a major tenet in market economy and business is often\n associated with competition as most companies are in competition with at least\n one other firm over the same group of customers, and also competition inside a\n company is usually stimulated for meeting and reaching higher quality of\n services or products that the company produce or develop.\n","linknr":440,"url":"Competition","recorded":1362485793,"links":52,"instances":["animal","biological","disambiguation","celebrity","business","european_commission","sociology"],"pdf":["http://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/documents/research/CompOrientPDF%2011-27%20%282%29.pdf","http://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/documents/research/CompOrientPDF%2011-27%20%282%29.pdf","http://qbox.wharton.upenn.edu/documents/mktg/research/Profitability%20of%20winning.pdf","http://qbox.wharton.upenn.edu/documents/mktg/research/Profitability%20of%20winning.pdf"],"categories":["Competition|","Social
