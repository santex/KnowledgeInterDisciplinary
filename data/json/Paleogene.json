Formerly the period\ncovered by the Paleogene was called the first part of the Tertiary, whose usage\nis no longer official. [http://www.stratigraphy.org/bak/geowhen/TQ.html\n\"Whatever happened to the Tertiary and Quaternary?\"] Lasting 42 million\nyears, the Paleogene is most notable as being the time in which mammals evolved\nfrom relatively small, simple forms into a large group of diverse animals in the\nwake of the CretaceousâPaleogene extinction event that ended the preceding\nCretaceous Period. Birds also evolved considerably during this period, changing\ninto roughly modern forms.\n\nThis period consists of the Paleocene, Eocene, and Oligocene Epochs. The end of\nthe Paleocene (55.5/54.8 Mya) was marked by one of the most significant\nperiods of global change during the Cenozoic, the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal\nMaximum, which upset oceanic and atmospheric circulation and led to the\nextinction of numerous deep-sea benthic foraminifera and on land, a major\nturnover in mammals. The Paleogene follows the Cretaceous Period and is followed\nby the Miocene Epoch of the Neogene Period. The terms 'Paleogene System'\n(formal) and 'lower Tertiary System' (informal) are applied to the rocks\ndeposited during the 'Paleogene Period'. The somewhat confusing terminology\nseems to be due to attempts to deal with the comparatively fine subdivisions of\ntime possible in the relatively recent geologic past, when more information is\npreserved. By dividing the Tertiary Period into two periods instead of five\nepochs, the periods are more closely comparable to the duration of 'periods' in\nthe Mesozoic and Paleozoic Eras.\n","linknr":502,"url":"Paleogene","recorded":1362539500,"links":72,"instances":["geology"],"pdf":["http://www.stratigraphy.org/ics%20chart/ChronostratChart2012.pdf"],"categories":["Geologic time scale","Paleogene"],"headings":["Climate and geography","Flora and fauna","Paleogene in geology","Notes","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/Blakey_35moll.jpg/240px-Blakey_35moll.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3c/Eocene.jpg/220px-Eocene.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["epoch","geology"]],"members":["epoch"],"related":["British_English","Geologic_period","Cenozoic","Era","Tertiary","Mammal","Evolution","Animal","Cretaceous–Paleogene_extinction_event","Cretaceous","Bird","Paleocene","Eocene","Oligocene","Epoch_(geology)","Paleocene-Eocene_Thermal_Maximum","Foraminifera","Miocene","Neogene","Tertiary","Tertiary","Mesozoic","Paleozoic","Mesozoic_era","Paleocene–Eocene_Thermal_Maximum","Antarctic_Circumpolar_Current","Plate_tectonics","India","Himalayas","Atlantic_Ocean","Mediterranean_Sea","Isthmus_of_Panama","North_America","Mammal","Dinosaur","Ocean","Cetacean","Primate","Cretaceous","Pterosaur","Life","Savannas","Prairies","Offshore_oil_drilling","Gulf_of_Mexico","Salt","Kaskida_oil_field","Tiber_Oil_Field","Jack_2"]}
