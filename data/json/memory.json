Encoding allows information that is from the outside world to\nreach our senses in the forms of chemical and physical stimuli. In this first\nstage we must change the information so that we may put the memory into the\nencoding process. Storage is the second memory stage or process. This entails\nthat we maintain information over periods of time. Finally the third process is\nthe retrieval of information that we have stored. We must locate it and return\nit to our consciousness. Some retrieval attempts may be effortless due to the\ntype of information.\n\nFrom an information processing perspective there are three main stages in the\nformation and retrieval of memory:\n* [[Encoding (memory)|Encoding]] or registration: receiving, processing and\n  combining of received information\n* [[Storage (memory)|Storage]]: creation of a permanent record of the encoded\n  information\n* [[Recollection|Retrieval]], recall or recollection: calling back the stored\n  information in response to some cue for use in a process or activity\n\nThe loss of memory is described as forgetfulness, or as a medical\ndisorder, amnesia.\n","title":"memory","headings":["Sensory memory","Short-term memory","Long-term memory","Models","Types of memory","Techniques used to study memory","Memory failures","Physiology","Cognitive  neuroscience of memory","Genetics","Memory in infancy","Memory and aging","Effects of physical exercise on memory","Disorders","Factors that influence memory","Memory and Stress","Memory construction","Improving memory","See also","Footnotes","External links"]},"micro-relation":["2: Amnesia","2: Prefrontal_cortex","2: Hippocampus","2: Procedural_memory","2: Episodic_memory","2: Long-term_potentiation","2: Memory_loss","2: Alzheimer's_disease","2: Method_of_loci","1: Psychology","1: Information_processing","1: George_Sperling","1: Iconic_memory","1: Echoic_memory","1: Haptic_memory","1: George_Armitage_Miller","1: Bell_Labs","1: The_Magical_Number_Seven,_Plus_or_Minus_Two","1: Telephone_number","1: Thomas_Jefferson_Building","1: Frontal_lobe","1: Parietal_lobe","1: Attention_span","1: Sleep","1: DNA_methylation","1: Prion","1: Atkinson-Shiffrin_memory_model","1: Richard_C._Atkinson","1: Richard_Shiffrin","1: Brain_damage","1: Baddeley's_model_of_working_memory","1: Visuospatial_Sketchpad","1: Episodic_memories","1: Declarative_memory","1: Conscious","1: Recollection","1: Semantic_memory","1: Knowledge","1: Autobiographical_memory","1: Visual_memory","1: Mental_image","1: Implicit_learning","1: Motor_skill","1: Unconscious_mind","1: Motor_learning","1: Cerebellum","1: Basal_ganglia","1: Retrospective_memory","1: Prospective_memory","1: Neuroanatomy_of_memory","1: Amygdala","1: Striatum","1: Mammillary_bodies","1: Declarative_learning","1: Emotion_and_memory","1: Learning","1: Synapse","1: Long-term_depression","1: Cortisol","1: Epinephrine","1: Mental_representation","1: Working_memory","1: Synaptic_transmission","1: Spike-timing-dependent_plasticity","1: Medial_temporal_lobe","1: Long-term_memory","1: Memory_consolidation","1: Reconsolidation","1: Short-term_memory","1: Apolipoprotein_E","1: Alzheimer's_Disease","1: Aging","1: Neurology","1: Parkinson's_disease","1: Hyperthymesia","1: New_Scientist","1: Korsakoff's_syndrome","1: Tip_of_the_tongue","1: Phenomenon","1: Anomic_aphasia","1: Lobes_of_the_brain","1: Reuters","1: Ohio_State","1: University","1: Interference_theory","1: Misinformation_effect","1: Cognition","1: Healthy_eating","1: Physical_fitness","1: Stress_management","1: Art_of_memory","1: International_Longevity_Center","1: Memorization","1: Rote_learning","1: Cosmos_Rossellius","1: Visual_alphabets","1: Spacing_effect","1: Cram_school","1: Zeigarnik_effect","1: Intermediate-term_memory","1: Politics_of_memory","1: Mnemonic_major_system","1: National_Institutes_of_Health"]}
