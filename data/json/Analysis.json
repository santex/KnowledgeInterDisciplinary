The technique has been applied in\nthe study of mathematics and logic since before Aristotle (384â322 B.C.), though\nanalysis as a formal concept is a relatively recent development.\n\nSome word is from the ancient latin Greek language|Greek]] á¼Î½Î¬Î»ÏÏÎ¹Ï (analusis,\n\"a breaking up\", from ana- \"up, throughout\" and lysis \"a loosening\").\n\nAs a formal concept, the method has variously been ascribed to\nAlhazen, RenÃ© Descartes ([[Discourse on the Method]]), and Galileo\nGalilei. It has also been ascribed to Isaac Newton, in the form of a practical\nmethod of physical discovery (which he did not name or formally describe).\n","linknr":424,"url":"Analysis","recorded":1362510075,"links":41,"instances":["information_gathering","linguistics","linguistics","chemical_analysis","homer","linguistics","online_algorithm","computer_science","statistics","cryptography"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Critical thinking","Thought","Research methods","Analysis|"],"headings":["Applicants","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["matrix","chemical_analysis"],["competitive_analysis","online_algorithm"],["program_analysis","computer_science"],["semantic_analysis","computer_science"],["intelligence","information_gathering"],["code","cryptography"],["morphology","linguistics"],["stylistics","linguistics"],["semantic_analysis","linguistics"],["analysis","homer"],["scale_analysis","statistics"]],"members":["intelligence","semantic_analysis","stylistics","matrix","analysis","morphology","competitive_analysis","program_analysis","scale_analysis","code"],"related":["Complexity","Mathematics","Logic","Aristotle","Before_Christ","Alhazen","René_Descartes","Galileo_Galilei","Isaac_Newton","Chemistry","Chemical_compound","Mixture","Chemical_process","Chemical_reaction","Chemical_element","Chemical_matter","Nuclear_reactor","Nuclear_scientist","Neutron_activation_analysis","Matrix_(chemical_analysis)","Analyser","National_security","Great_power","Materials_MASINT","Measurement_and_signature_intelligence","Isotope_analysis","Anthropology","Archeology","Food_chemistry","Forensics","Geology","Physical_science","Environmental_radioactivity","Financial_statement_analysis","Fundamental_analysis","Technical_analysis","Business_analysis","Price_analysis","Market_analysis","Supply_and_demand","Requirements_analysis","Competitive_analysis_(online_algorithm)","Lexical_analysis","Object-oriented_analysis_and_design","Booch_method","Program_analysis_(computer_science)","Semantic_analysis_(computer_science)","Static_code_analysis","Structured_systems_analysis_and_design_methodology","Yourdon","Syntax_analysis","Worst-case_execution_time","Agroecosystem_analysis","Input-output_model","Engineering","Requirement_analysis","Structural_analysis","Systems_analysis","Dimensional_analysis","Electrical_engineering","System_analysis","Electronics","Whole-life_cost","Accident_analysis","Intelligence_(information_gathering)","Intelligence_agency","Heuristics","Inductive_reasoning","Deductive_reasoning","Social_network_analysis","Dynamic_network_analysis","Brainstorming","Military_intelligence","Game_theory","Red_Team","Military_simulation","Signals_intelligence","Cryptanalysis","Frequency_analysis","Code_(cryptography)","Cipher","Business_intelligence","Competitive_intelligence","Competitor_analysis","Marketplace","Police","Crime_analysis","Ashtadhyayi","Tolkāppiyam","Language","Theoretical_linguistics","Phonology","Pragmatics","Morphology_(linguistics)","Etymology","Lexical_semantics","Phraseology","Syntax","Discourse_analysis","Stylistics_(linguistics)","Conversation_analysis","Computational_linguistics","Semantic_analysis_(linguistics)","Anthropological_linguistics","Biolinguistics","Evolutionary_linguistics","Language_geography","Historical_linguistics","Neurolinguistics","Psycholinguistics","Sociolinguistics","Applied_linguistics","Developmental_linguistics","Clinical_linguistics","Literary_theory","Literature","Literary_criticism","Analysis_(Homer)","Psychoanalytic_literary_criticism","Classical_mathematics","Real_analysis","Complex_analysis","Fourier_analysis","Numerical_analysis","Non-classical_analysis","Constructivist_analysis","Harmonic_analysis","Non-standard_analysis","Functional_analysis","Musical_analysis","Schenkerian_analysis","Philosophical_analysis","Psychoanalysis","Transactional_analysis","Finite_element_analysis","Independent_component_analysis","Link_quality_analysis","Path_quality_analysis","Statistics","Data_analysis","Analysis_of_variance","Boolean_analysis","Cluster_analysis","Factor_analysis","Meta-analysis","Multivariate_analysis","Principal_component_analysis","Regression_analysis","Scale_analysis_(statistics)","Sensitivity_analysis","Sequential_analysis","Spatial_analysis","Time-series_analysis","Aura_analysis","Bowling_analysis","Lithic_analysis","Protocol_analysis","Formal_analysis","Scientific_method"]}
