distributed.\n\nPressure is force per unit area applied in a direction perpendicular to the\nsurface of an object. Gauge pressure (also spelled gage pressure)<ref group=lower-\nalpha>The preferred spelling varies by country and even by industry. Further,\nboth spellings are often used within a particular industry or country.\nIndustries in British English-speaking countries typically use the \"gauge\"\nspelling. Many of the largest US manufacturers of pressure transducers and\ninstrumentation use the spelling \"gage pressure\" in their most formal\ndocumentation [http://www.sensotec.com/pressurefaq.shtml sensotec.com] Honeywell-\nSensotec's FAQ page and [http://us.fluke.com/usen/Home/Search.asp?txtSearchBox=-\n%22gage+pressure%22&x=0&y=0 fluke.com], Fluke Corporation's product search page.\nOne might even say, \"I have too much gauge pressure.\" Meaning the pressure\ndifference between atmospheric and the body is significant, therefore letting\nout gas would be a natural phenomenon.</ref> is the pressure relative to the\nlocal atmospheric or ambient pressure. Pressure is measured in any unit of force\ndivided by any unit of area. The SI unit of pressure is (the newton per square\nmetre) which is called the [[Pascal (unit)|pascal]] (Pa) after the seventeenth-\ncentury philosopher and scientist Blaise Pascal. A pressure of 1 Pa is small; it\napproximately equals the pressure exerted by a dollar bill resting flat on a\ntable. Everyday pressures are often stated in kilopascals (1 kPa = 1000 Pa).\n","title":"pressure","headings":["Definition","Types","See also","Notes","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["3: Blood_pressure","3: Underwater_diving","3: Atmospheric_pressure","3: Gas","2: Force","2: Area","2: Square_metre","2: Blaise_Pascal","2: Liquid","2: SI","2: Barye","2: Technical_atmosphere","2: Millibar","2: Manometer","2: Water","2: Torr","2: Bernoulli's_equation","2: Partial_pressure","1: Perpendicular","1: Gauge_pressure","1: International_System_of_Units","1: Momentum","1: Normal_force","1: Gravitational_acceleration","1: Proportionality_constant","1: Thermodynamics","1: Pound-force_per_square_inch","1: Cgs","1: Meteorologist","1: Inch_of_mercury","1: Decibar","1: Centimeters_of_water","1: InHg","1: Diving_chamber","1: Dive_computer","1: National_Institute_of_Standards_and_Technology","1: Centimeter_of_water","1: Ton-force#Short_ton-force","1: Ton-force#Long_ton-force","1: Pound-force","1: Ounce-force","1: Poundal","1: Metres_sea_water","1: Dyne","1: Sthene","1: Pieze","1: Thumbtack","1: Gradient","1: Force_density","1: Automobile","1: Tire","1: Pressure_gauge<!--Editors_are_asked_to_PLEASE_check_the_discussion_page_for_this_article_before_making_changes_regarding_\"gauge\"_vs._\"gage\"_spelling_issues._Much_debate_has_transpired_on_this_issue.-->","1: Name_plates","1: Brownian_motion","1: Vector_area","1: Tensor","1: Viscous_stress_tensor","1: General_relativity","1: Stress-energy_tensor","1: Gravity","1: Neutron_star","1: Fluid","1: Atmosphere_of_Earth","1: Pressure#Liquid_pressure","1: Negligible","1: Fluid_statics","1: Fluid_dynamics","1: Daniel_Bernoulli","1: Inviscid","1: Viscosity","1: Specific_weight","1: Acceleration_of_gravity","1: Artesian_well","1: Hydraulic_head","1: Turgor_pressure","1: Pythagorean_cup","1: Explosion","1: Deflagration","1: Van_der_Waals_force","1: Transpiration_pull","1: Casimir_effect","1: Vacuum_energy","1: Cosmological_constant","1: Drag_equation","1: Stagnation_pressure","1: Static_pressure","1: Mach_number","1: Pitot_tube","1: Kiel_probe","1: Cobra_probe","1: Boyle's_law","1: Ideal_gas","1: Ideal_gas_law","1: Amount_of_substance","1: Ideal_gas_constant","1: Real_gas","1: Vapor","1: Thermodynamic_equilibrium","1: Solid","1: Evaporate","1: Condense","1: Boiling_point","1: Normal_boiling_point","1: Liquid_bubble","1: Density","1: Buoyancy","1: Kinematic_viscosity","1: Navier-Stokes_equation","1: Boyle's_Law","1: Combined_gas_law","1: Conversion_of_units","1: Dynamic_pressure","1: Hydraulics","1: Internal_pressure","1: Kinetic_theory#Pressure","1: Microphone","1: Pressure_measurement","1: Pressure_sensor","1: Sound_pressure","1: Spouting_can","1: Timeline_of_temperature_and_pressure_measurement_technology","1: Units_conversion_by_factor-label","1: Vacuum","1: Vacuum_pump","1: Vertical_pressure_variation"]}
