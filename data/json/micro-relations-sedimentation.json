{"cursor":"6677","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Sedimentation' is the tendency for particles in suspension to settle out of the\nfluid in which they are entrained, and come to rest against a barrier. This is\ndue to their motion through the fluid in response to the forces acting on them:\nthese forces can be due to gravity, centrifugal acceleration or\nelectromagnetism. In geology sedimentation is often used as the polar opposite\nof erosion, i.e., the terminal end of sediment transport. In that sense it\nincludes the termination of transport by saltation or true bedload transport.\nSettling is the falling of suspended particles through the liquid, whereas\nsedimentation is the termination of the settling process.\n\nSedimentation may pertain to objects of various sizes, ranging from large rocks\nin flowing water to suspensions of dust and pollen particles to cellular\nsuspensions to solutions of single molecules such as proteins and peptides. Even\nsmall molecules such as aspirin can be sedimented, although it can be difficult\nto apply a sufficiently strong force to produce significant sedimentation.\n\nThe term is typically used in geology, to describe the deposition of sediment\nwhich results in the formation of sedimentary rock, and in various chemical and\nenvironmental fields to describe the motions of often-smaller particles and\nmolecules. Process is also used in biotech industry to separate out cells from\nthe culture media.\n","linknr":207,"url":"sedimentation","recorded":1362570705,"links":36,"instances":["geology","disambiguation","biology","ecology","chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Earth sciences","Laboratory techniques","Separation processes"],"headings":["Experiments","Geology","Chemistry","See also","Notes"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/7/c/47c99020a95e9532b764a6d11492cb90.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/2/0/2/202688ff6078fd55bb30703a9de0f4d9.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/1/4/0/140cf000060ccd9590c1c5cabb5f8829.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/d/a/d/dad0b84066b3a2f7b7f11ac646f6af7b.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/c/6/c/c6c501658ac454bc7243adfdc0674896.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/2/8/8/288ce9f656af4ec0aa9526daf2a36f4b.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/c/6/c/c6c501658ac454bc7243adfdc0674896.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/2/8/8/288ce9f656af4ec0aa9526daf2a36f4b.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/90/Siltation_or_Sedimentation.jpg/220px-Siltation_or_Sedimentation.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/62/Wallula-Gap-the-sisters.JPG/50px-Wallula-Gap-the-sisters.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["particle","ecology"],["suspension","chemistry"],["suspension","chemistry"],["particle","ecology"],["cell","biology"],["deposition","geology"],["coagulation","disambiguation"]],"members":["deposition","coagulation","cell","particle","suspension"],"related":["Particle_(ecology)","Suspension_(chemistry)","Gravitation","Centrifugal_acceleration","Electromagnetism","Sediment_transport","Saltation","Bedload","Settling","Suspension_(chemistry)","Particle_(ecology)","Cell_(biology)","Solution","Molecule","Protein","Peptide","Aspirin","Deposition_(geology)","Sediment","Sedimentary_rock","Terminal_velocity","Reynolds_number","Terminal_velocity","Stokes_flow","Sedimentation_coefficient","Sediment","Diffusion","Masonâ€“Weaver_equation","Buoyant_mass","Centrifugal_force","Lamm_equation","Circular_sector","Geology","Suspended","Exner_equation","Landform","Depositional_record","Siltation","Climate_change","Macromolecule","Centrifugal_force","Ultracentrifuge","Coagulation_(disambiguation)","Flocculation"]}
