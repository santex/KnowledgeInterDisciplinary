It provides strategic, technical and financial\nsupport to openly gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender candidates and\nofficials across the United States, helping them win elections at local, state\nand federal levels. Victory has helped elect several hundred openly LGBT\ncandidates to Congress, state legislatures, school boards and city councils. The\norganization also offers programs and training to elected officials.\n\nThe Victory Fund endorses dozens of openly LGBT candidates each year, increasing\nexposure to potential donors and providing both strategic and material support.\nPast endorsees include Tammy Baldwin, Barney Frank, Sean Patrick Maloney, h-\nttp://www.victoryfund.org/endorsed_candidates/profile/candidate:658 David\nCicilline, Lupe Valdez, Victoria Kolakowski, Patricia Todd and\nVirginia Linder. The first candidate the Victory Fund endorsed was Sherry\nHarris, who was elected to the City Council in Seattle, Washington, making her\nthe first openly lesbian African-American elected\nofficial. http://www.victoryfund.org/our_story/mission\n\nIn 1995, the Victory Fund was a principal organizer of a meeting between\nrepresentatives of the Clinton administration and several dozen leaders of gay\nand lesbian organizations. New York Times: [http://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/14/us/clinton-names-first-liaison-to-gay-and-\nlesbian-groups.html David W. Dunlap, \"Clinton Names First Liaison To Gay and\nLesbian Groups\", June 14, 1995], accessed Dec 9, 2009\n\nIn 2008, 80 of the group's 111 endorsed candidates won their\nelections.\n\nIn 2009, the Victory Fund played an important role in the election of Annise\nParker as mayor of Houston. In electing an out lesbian as its chief executive,\nHouston became the largest city in the country to have elected an openly gay\nperson as mayor. Local gay groups, particularly the Houston GLBT Political\nCaucus, had nurtured Parker's political career and were openly supporting her\nrace. The Victory Fund became a huge player in the race by providing a much-\nneeded source of cash for Parker's grassroots efforts and helping her stay\nfinancially competitive with her two chief rivals, both of whose campaigns were\nlavishly funded. After the campaign, Parker referred to the Victory Fund as her\n\"secret weapon\" and thanked the organization for its help.\n\nThe Victory Fund is the nationâs largest LGBT political action committee and one\nof the nationâs largest non-connected PACs. Its President and CEO since 2003 is\nChuck Wolfe.\n","linknr":154,"url":"Gay_&_Lesbian_Victory_Fund","recorded":1375075231,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Gay_%26_Lesbian_Victory_Fund&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Gay_%26_Lesbian_Victory_Fund&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gay_%26_Lesbian_Victory_Fund&action=edit","/wiki/Talk:Gay_%26_Lesbian_Victory_Fund","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gay_%26_Lesbian_Victory_Fund&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Template:Citation_needed","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability","/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research#Primary.2C_secondary_and_tertiary_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research#Primary.2C_secondary_and_tertiary_sources","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:TONE","/wiki/Wikipedia:Guide_to_writing_better_articles","/wiki/File:G%26L_Victory_Fund_logo.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/92/G%26L_Victory_Fund_logo.svg/150px-G%26L_Victory_Fund_logo.svg.png","/wiki/United_States","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a4/Flag_of_the_United_States.svg/22px-Flag_of_the_United_States.svg.png","/wiki/Washington,_D.C.","/wiki/Chair_(official)","//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/vice-","/wiki/Steve_Elmendorf","/wiki/Secretary","/wiki/Treasurer","/wiki/LGBT","/wiki/Politician","/wiki/Political_endorsement","/wiki/Fundraising","http://www.victoryfund.org/","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/Political_action_committee","/wiki/LGBT","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/Vic_Basile","#cite_note-RimmermanWald2000-1","/wiki/Gay","/wiki/Lesbian","/wiki/Bisexual","/wiki/Transgender","/wiki/Tammy_Baldwin","/wiki/Barney_Frank","/wiki/Sean_Patrick_Maloney","#cite_note-2","/wiki/David_Cicilline","/wiki/Lupe_Valdez","/wiki/Victoria_Kolakowski","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Patricia_Todd","/wiki/Virginia_Linder","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","#cite_note-4","#cite_note-5","#cite_note-6","/wiki/Annise_Parker","/wiki/Houston_GLBT_Political_Caucus","/wiki/Chuck_Wolfe_(executive)","/w/index.php?title=Gay_%26_Lesbian_Victory_Fund&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-RimmermanWald2000_1-0","http://books.google.com/books?id=vMghaleR8RoC&pg=PA71","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Special:BookSources/9780226719986","#cite_ref-2","http://www.victoryfund.org/endorsed_candidates/profile/candidate:658","#cite_ref-3","http://www.ebar.com/news/article.php?sec=news&article=5228","#cite_ref-4","http://www.victoryfund.org/our_story/mission","#cite_ref-5","http://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/14/us/clinton-names-first-liaison-to-gay-and-lesbian-groups.html","#cite_ref-6","http://www.pridesource.com/article.html?article=32873","/w/index.php?title=Gay_%26_Lesbian_Victory_Fund&action=edit&section=2","http://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/06/us/1994-campaign-homosexuality-struggle-over-gay-rights-moves-statewide-level.html","http://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/25/us/as-gay-marchers-gather-mood-is-serious-and-festive.html","/w/index.php?title=Gay_%26_Lesbian_Victory_Fund&action=edit&section=3","http://www.victoryfund.org/","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gay_%26_Lesbian_Victory_Fund&oldid=544691461","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:LGBT_political_advocacy_groups_in_the_United_States","/wiki/Category:United_States_political_action_committees","/wiki/Category:527_groups","/wiki/Category:Articles_needing_additional_references_from_December_2009","/wiki/Category:All_articles_needing_additional_references","/wiki/Category:Articles_lacking_reliable_references_from_October_2008","/wiki/Category:All_articles_lacking_reliable_references","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_needing_style_editing_from_February_2008","/wiki/Category:All_articles_needing_style_editing","/wiki/Category:All_articles_with_unsourced_statement
