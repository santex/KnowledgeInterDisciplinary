{"cursor":"2392","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nThe 'Church of Scotland offices' are located in the centre of Edinburgh,\nScotland (in the New Town) at 121 George Street. These imposing buildings are\npopularly known in Church circles as \"one-two-one\". They were designed in a Scandinavian-\ninfluenced style by the architect Sydney Mitchell and built in 1909-1911 for the\nUnited Free Church of Scotland. Following the union of the Church of Scotland\nand the United Free Church of Scotland in 1929 the church offices were\nhenceforth used by the newly united church. A matching extension, incorporating\na ground floor bookshop, was built in the 1930s on the east side (119 George\nStreet). A proposed matching extension on the west side (replacing the still-\nexisting buildings at 123 George Street) was never built. 123 George Street is,\nhowever, owned by the Church of Scotland and has been incorporated into the\noffices. The church offices also incorporate a chapel near the main entrance and\na staff canteen in the basement.\n\nThe title used is always \"church offices\" and never \"headquarters\". There are\nperiodically suggestions within the Church of Scotland that the current church\noffices should be sold, relocating to new premises outside Edinburgh. Such a\ndecision could only be taken by the General Assembly; so far no proposals have\nbeen made.\n\nThe offices of the Moderator, Principal Clerk, General Treasurer, Law Department\nand all the church councils are located at the church offices. The one major\nexception is the Social Care Council (CrossReach) which is located outside the\ncity centre at Charis House, 47 Milton Road East, Edinburgh.\n","linknr":101,"url":"Church_of_Scotland_Offices","recorded":1375066474,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Church_of_Scotland_Offices&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Church_of_Scotland_Offices&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Church_of_Scotland_Offices&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/File:ChurchofScotlandOffices.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/eb/ChurchofScotlandOffices.JPG/300px-ChurchofScotlandOffices.JPG","/wiki/File:ChurchofScotlandOffices.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Edinburgh","/wiki/Scotland","/wiki/New_Town,_Edinburgh","/wiki/George_Street,_Edinburgh","/wiki/Sydney_Mitchell","/wiki/United_Free_Church_of_Scotland","/wiki/Church_of_Scotland","/wiki/Moderator_of_the_General_Assembly_of_the_Church_of_Scotland","/w/index.php?title=Church_of_Scotland_Offices&action=edit&section=1","http://www.churchofscotland.org.uk","/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system","//tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Church_of_Scotland_Offices&params=55_57_8.80_N_3_12_17.02_W_","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Church_of_Scotland_Offices&oldid=520331307","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Office_buildings_completed_in_1911","/wiki/Category:Religious_buildings_completed_in_1911","/wiki/Category:1909_in_Scotland","/wiki/Category:Church_of_Scotland","/wiki/Category:Buildings_and_structures_in_Edinburgh","/wiki/Category:New_Town,_Edinburgh","/wiki/Category:Denomination_headquarters_in_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Category:Category_A_listed_buildings_in_Scotland","/wiki/Category:Listed_buildings_in_Edinburgh","/wiki/Category:Articles_lacking_sources_from_March_2012","/wiki/Category:All_articles_lacking_sources","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Church+of+Scotland+Offices&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Church+of+Scotland+Offices","/wiki/Church_of_Scotland_Offices","/wiki/Talk:Church_of_Scotland_Offices","#","/wiki/Church_of_Scotland_Offices","/w/index.php?title=Church_of_Scotland_Offices&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Church_of_Scotland_Offices&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Church_of_Scotland_Offices","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Church_of_Scotland_Offices","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Church_of_Scotland_Offices&oldid=520331307","/w/index.php?title=Church_of_Scotland_Offices&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5117190","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Church_of_Scotland_Offices&id=520331307","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Church+of+Scotland+Offices","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Church+of+Scotland+Offices&oldid=520331307&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Church_of_Scotland_Offices&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5117190#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaim
