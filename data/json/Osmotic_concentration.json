{"cursor":"6982","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Osmotic concentration', formerly known as 'osmolarity', IUPAC\ngoldbook is the measure of solute concentration, defined as the number of\nosmoles (Osm) of solute per litre (L) of solution (osmol/L or Osm/L). The\nosmolarity of a solution is usually expressed as 'Osm/L' (pronounced \"osmolar\"),\nin the same way that the molarity of a solution is expressed as \"M\" (pronounced\n\"molar\"). Whereas molarity measures the number of moles of solute per unit\nvolume of solution, osmolarity measures the number of osmoles of solute\nparticles per unit volume of solution.\n\nOsmolality is a measure of the osmoles of solute per kilogram of solvent\n(osmol/kg or Osm/kg).\n\nMolarity and osmolarity are not commonly used in osmometry because they are\ntemperature dependent. This is because water changes its volume with temperature\n(See: Vapour pressure of water). However, if the concentration of solutes is\nvery low, osmolarity and osmolality are considered equivalent.\n","linknr":165,"url":"Osmotic_concentration","recorded":1362374771,"links":19,"instances":["unit","chemistry","unit"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Analytical chemistry","Amount of substance","Solutions"],"headings":["Types of solutes","Definition","Osmolarity vs. tonicity","Plasma osmolarity vs. osmolality","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/c/0/5c0230aedc45ade7fac6bc7dfef966b0.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["osmole","unit"],["mole","unit"],["dissociation","chemistry"]],"members":["osmole","dissociation","mole"],"related":["Solution","Concentration","Osmole_(unit)","Litre","Solution","Molarity","Mole_(unit)","Volume","Osmolality","Kilogram","Solvent","Osmometry","Temperature","H2O","Thermal_expansion","Vapour_pressure_of_water","Dissociation_(chemistry)","Ionic_compounds","Salt","Ion","Sodium_chloride","Glucose","Osmotic_coefficient","Debye-HÃ¼ckel_equation","Glucose","Osmometer","Colligative_properties","Freezing-point_depression","Vapor_pressure","Boiling-point_elevation","Tonicity","Cell_membrane","Osmosis","Diffusion_equilibrium","Plasma_osmolality","Density","Blood_plasma","Anhydrous","Molarity","Molality","Plasma_osmolality","Tonicity"]}
