{"cursor":"3586","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Novelty Piano' is a genre of piano music that was popular during the 1920s.\n\nA successor to ragtime and an outgrowth of the piano roll music of the 1910s,\n'novelty piano' can be considered a pianistic cousin of jazz, which appeared\naround the same time. \"Nola,\" a 1915 composition by New York pianist Felix\nArndt, is generally considered the first novelty piano hit. Many early novelty\ncomposers were piano roll artists from the Chicago area, where two of the\nlargest piano roll companies, QRS and Imperial, had their headquarters. Though\nalso often highly syncopated, it is distinct from stride piano, which was\ndeveloped in New York at about the same time.\n\nThe earliest composers of novelty piano were piano roll artists looking to sell\npiano rolls. These pieces started out as highly complex rags with characteristic\nbreaks, consecutive fourths, and advanced harmonies. The pioneer of this style\nwas Charley Straight, whose compositions were issued on piano roll years before\nConfrey's novelty hits. Early Charley Straight novelties include S'more,\nPlaymor, Nifty Nonsense, Rufenreddy, and Wild And Wooly.\n\nNovelty piano came most powerfully to the attention of the public in 1921, with\nthe appearance of Zez Confrey's \"Kitten on the Keys\". The popularity of this\npiece quickly led to other Confrey works including \"Dizzy Fingers\" and\n\"Greenwich Witch\", and inspired other artists to issue novelty pieces. The style\nremained popular through the end of the decade, at which time big bands were on\nthe rise, player pianos were in decline, and the popularity of jazz continued\nunabated. Novelty piano slowly succumbed to, or was absorbed into, the new\norchestral styles as the piano moved off center stage and took on more of a\n\"support\" role.\n\nAlthough novelty piano has structural and stylistic similarities to the earlier\nragtime form, there are also distinct differences. Ragtime was generally sold in\nthe form of sheet music, so it was important to keep it simple enough to be\nplayed by the competent amateur. By the mid 'teens, though, two new technologies\nhad appeared which allowed the general public to hear music as performed by\nskilled musicians: the \"hand-played\" piano roll and the phonograph record.\nNovelty piano was developed as a vehicle to showcase the talents of these\nprofessionals, and was thus more often sold in the form of recordings and piano\nrolls than as sheet music. It was a new \"turbo-charged\" piano form, shorn of\nhackneyed, Victorian-era stylings, infused with chromatic piano roll flourishes,\nand influenced by the \"modernistic\" sounds of the art-deco twenties.\n(Themselves, largely adopted from the French \"Impressionist\" pianists such as\nDebussy and Satie. \"Novelty\" pianists tended to be highly Classically trained,\nso were fully familiar with such \"modern\" pianists, and their fondness for\ncomplex chordal intricacies.)\n\nProminent artists in the novelty piano genre include Zez Confrey, Charley\nStraight, Roy Bargy, Pauline Alpert, Fred Elizalde, Rube Bloom, Clement Doucet,\nMax Kortlander, and Billy Mayerl.\n","linknr":103,"url":"Novelty_piano","recorded":1374858000,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Novelty_piano&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Novelty_piano&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Novelty_piano&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/File:Dizzy_Fingers_Sheet_Music_Cover_1.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/55/Dizzy_Fingers_Sheet_Music_Cover_1.jpg/300px-Dizzy_Fingers_Sheet_Music_Cover_1.jpg","/wiki/File:Dizzy_Fingers_Sheet_Music_Cover_1.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf7/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Genre","/wiki/Ragtime","/wiki/Piano_roll","/wiki/Jazz","/wiki/Felix_Arndt","/wiki/Stride_piano","/wiki/Charley_Straight","/wiki/Charley_Straight","/wiki/Zez_Confrey","/wiki/Zez_Confrey","/wiki/Charley_Straight","/wiki/Roy_Bargy","/wiki/Fred_Elizalde","/wiki/Rube_Bloom","/wiki/Clement_Doucet","/w/index.php?title=Max_Kortlander&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Billy_Mayerl","/w/index.php?title=Novelty_piano&action=edit&section=1","http://www.perfessorbill.com/pbmidi8.shtml#category14","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Novelty_piano&oldid=561774678","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Popular_music","/wiki/Category:American_styles_of_music","/wiki/Category:Articles_lacking_sources_from_November_2010","/wiki/Category:All_articles_lacking_sources","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Novelty+piano&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Novelty+piano","/wiki/Novelty_piano","/w/index.php?title=Talk:Novelty_piano&action=edit&redlink=1","#","/wiki/Novelty_piano","/w/index.php?title=Novelty_piano&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Novelty_piano&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Novelty_piano","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Novelty_piano","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Novelty_piano&oldid=561774678","/w/index.php?title=Novelty_piano&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2909943","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Novelty_piano&id=561774678","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Novelty+piano","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Novelty+piano&oldid=561774678&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Novelty_piano&printable=yes","//fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novelty_piano","//nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novelty_piano","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2909943#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novelty_piano","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Popular
