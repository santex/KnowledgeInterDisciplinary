      "text" : "\n\n in 1952]]\n\nA 'flying saucer' (also referred to as a 'flying disc') is a type of described\nflying craft with a disc or saucer-shaped body, commonly used generically to\nrefer to any anomalous flying object. In 1947 the term was coined but was later\nofficially supplanted by the United States Air Force in 1952 with the broader\nterm unidentified flying objects or UFO's . Early reported sightings of unknown\n\"flying saucers\" usually described them as silver or metallic, sometimes\nreported as covered with navigation lights or surrounded with a glowing light,\nhovering or moving rapidly, either alone or in tight formations with other\nsimilar craft, and exhibiting high maneuverability.\n\nWhile disc-shaped flying objects have been interpreted as being sporadically\nrecorded since the Middle Ages, the first highly publicized sighting by Kenneth\nArnold on June 24 1947, resulted in the creation of the exact term by U.S.\nnewspapers. Although Arnold never specifically used the term \"flying saucer\", he\nwas quoted at the time saying the shape of the objects he saw was like a\n\"saucer\", \"disc\", or \"pie-plate\", and several years later added he had also said\n\"the objects moved like saucers skipping across the water.\" Both the terms\nflying saucer and flying disc were used commonly and interchangeably in the\nmedia until the early 1950s.\n\nArnold's sighting was followed by thousands of similar sightings across the\nworld. Such sightings were once very common, to such an extent that \"flying\nsaucer\" was a synonym for UFO through the 1960s before it began to fall out of\nfavor. More recently, the flying saucer has been largely supplanted by other\nalleged UFO-related vehicles, such as the black triangle. The term UFO was, in\nfact, invented in 1952, to try to reflect the wider diversity of shapes being\nseen. However, unknown saucer-like objects are still reported, such as in the\nwidely publicized 2006 sighting over Chicago-O'Hare airport.\n\nMany of the alleged flying saucer photographs of the era are now believed to be\nhoaxes. The flying saucer is now considered largely an icon of the 1950s and of\nB-movies in particular, and is a popular subject in comic science fiction.<ref\nname=\"BBC\"></ref>\n\nBeyond the common usage of the phrase, there have also been man-made saucer-like\ncraft. The first flying disc craft was called the Discopter and was patented by\nAlexander Weygers in 1944. Other designs have followed, such as the American\nVought V-173 / XF5U \"Flying Flapjack\", the British GFS Projects flying saucer,\nor the British \"S.A.U.C.E.R.\" (\"Saucer Aircraft Utilising Coanda Effect\nReactions\") flying saucer, by inventor Alf Beharie.\n",
