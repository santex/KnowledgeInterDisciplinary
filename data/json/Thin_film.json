Electronic semiconductor\ndevices and optical coatings are the main applications benefiting from thin film\nconstruction.\n\nA familiar application of thin films is the household mirror, which typically\nhas a thin metal coating on the back of a sheet of glass to form a reflective\ninterface. The process of silvering was once commonly used to produce mirrors.\nA very thin film coating (less than a nanometer thick) is used to produce two-\nway mirrors.\n\nThe performance of optical coatings (e.g. antireflective, or AR, coatings) are\ntypically enhanced when the thin film coating consists of multiple layers having\nvarying thicknesses and refractive indices. Similarly, a periodic structure of\nalternating thin films of different materials may collectively form a so-called\nsuperlattice which exploits the phenomenon of quantum confinement by restricting\nelectronic phenomena to two-dimensions.\n\nWork is being done with ferromagnetic and ferroelectric [http://www.printed-\nelectronicsworld.com/articles/winners_of_the_idtechex_printed_electronics_europ-\ne_awards_00001368.asp Thinfilm and InkTec awarded IDTechEx' Technical\nDevelopment Manufacturing Award] IDTechEx, April 15th 2009 thin films for\nuse as computer memory. It is also being applied to pharmaceuticals, via thin\nfilm drug delivery. Thin-films are used to produce thin-film batteries. Thin\nfilms are also used in dye-sensitized solar cells.\n\nCeramic thin films are in wide use. The relatively high hardness and inertness\nof ceramic materials make this type of thin coating of interest for protection\nof substrate materials against corrosion, oxidation and wear. In particular, the\nuse of such coatings on cutting tools can extend the life of these items by\nseveral orders of magnitude.\n\nResearch is being done on a new class of thin film inorganic oxide materials,\ncalled amorphous heavy-metal cation multicomponent oxides, which could be used\nto make transparent transistors that are inexpensive, stable, and\nenvironmentally benign.\n","linknr":251,"url":"Thin_film","recorded":1362538822,"links":26,"instances":["physics","printing","artist","physics","physics","electronics","chemistry","material","chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Thin films","Thin-film cells"],"headings":["Deposition","Thin-film photovoltaic cells","Thin-film batteries","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["layer","electronics"],["heavy_metal","chemistry"],["substrate","materials_science"],["deposition","physics"],["reflection","physics"],["conductor","material"],["larry_bell","artist"],["plasma","physics"],["dissociation","chemistry"],["substrate","printing"]],"members":["deposition","substrate","larry_bell","reflection","plasma","layer","heavy_metal","conductor","dissociation"],"related":["Layer_(electronics)","Nanometer","Monolayer","Micrometer","Electronics","Semiconductor","Optical_coating","Mirror","Silvering","Two-way_mirror","AR_coating","Refractive_index","Superlattice","Quantum_confinement","Ferromagnetic","Ferroelectric_polymers","Computer_memory","Thin_film_drug_delivery","Thin-film_battery","Dye-sensitized_solar_cells","Ceramic","Oxide","Amorphous","Heavy_metal_(chemistry)","Cation","Substrate_(materials_science)","Deposition_(physics)","Nanometre","Molecular_beam_epitaxy","Atom","Optics","Reflection_(physics)","Anti-reflective_coating","Self-cleaning_glass","Electronics","Electrical_insulation","Semiconductor","Conductor_(material)","Integrated_circuits","Packaging","Metallized_polyethylene_terephthalate","Contemporary_art","Larry_bell_(artist)","Copper","Electroplating","Silicon","Uranium","Chemical_vapor_deposition","Chemistry","Physics","Salt","Reagent","Noble_metal","Electroplating","Chemical-mechanical_polishing","Chemical_bath_deposition","Organometallic","Sol-gel","Viscosity","Halide","Hydride","Metalorganic_vapour_phase_epitaxy","Organometallic","Plasma_(physics)","Microwave","Conformal","Frost","Energy","Entropy","Scattering","Vapor_pressure","Heating_element","Molecular_beam_epitaxy","Electron_gun","Vapor_pressure","Gallium_arsenide","Gallium","Arsenic","Furnace","Chemical_beam_epitaxy","Noble_gas","Argon","Ablation","Laser","Ion_beam_deposition","Power_density","Ionization","Dissociation_(chemistry)","Ionization","Excited_state","Ion_flux","Taylor_cone","Photovoltaic","Photovoltaic_module","Printed_electronics","Roll-to-roll","Photovoltaic_cell","Printed_electronics","Lithium_polymer","Substrate_(printing)","Thin-film_battery","Coating","Dual_Polarisation_Interferometry","Ellipsometry","Hydrogenography","Kelvin_probe_force_microscope","Microfabrication","Organic_LED","Sarfus","Thin-film_interference","Thin-film_optics"]}
