Chicago: University of\nChicago Press, 1971. p.6. presenting pioneering analyses of social\nindividuality and fragmentation. For Simmel, culture referred to \"the\ncultivation of individuals through the agency of external forms which have been\nobjectified in the course of history\". Levine, Donald (ed) Simmel: On\nindividuality and social forms Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1971.\np.6. Simmel discussed social and cultural phenomena in terms of \"forms\"\nand \"contents\" with a transient relationship; form becoming content, and vice\nversa, dependent on the context. In this sense he was a forerunner to\nstructuralist styles of reasoning in the social sciences. With his work on the\nmetropolis, Simmel was a precursor of urban sociology, symbolic interactionism\nand social network analysis. Wellman, Barry. 1988. \"Structural Analysis:\nFrom Method and Metaphor to Theory and Substance.\" Pp. 19–61 in Social\nStructures: A Network Approach, edited by Barry Wellman and S.D. Berkowitz.\nCambridge: Cambridge University Press; Linton Freeman, The Development of Social\nNetwork Analysis. Vancouver: Empirical Press.\n\nAn acquaintance of Max Weber, Simmel wrote on the topic of personal character in\na manner reminiscent of the sociological 'ideal type'. He broadly rejected\nacademic standards, however, philosophically covering topics such as emotion and\nromantic love. Both Simmel and Weber's nonpositivist theory would inform the\neclectic critical theory of the Frankfurt School. Outhwaite, William. 1988.\nHabermas: Key Contemporary Thinkers 2nd Edition (2009), p.5 (ISBN\n9780745643281)\n\nSimmel's most famous works today are The Problems of the Philosophy of History\n(1892), [[The Philosophy of Money]] (1907), [[The Metropolis and Mental Life]]\n(1903), Soziologie (1908, inc. The Stranger, The Social Boundary, The Sociology\nof the Senses, The Sociology of Space, and On The Spatial Projections of Social\nForms), and Fundamental Questions of Sociology (1917). He also wrote extensively\non the philosophy of Schopenhauer and Nietzsche, as well on art, most notably\nhis book Rembrandt: An Essay in the Philosophy of Art (1916).\n","linknr":488,"url":"Georg_Simmel","recorded":1362480711,"links":56,"instances":["sociology","sociology","sociology","sociology","central_european","sociology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Kantian philosophers","1858 births","1918 deaths","German Jews","German philosophers","German sociologists","Jewish sociologists","Sociologists of religion","Writers from Berlin","People from the Province of Brandenburg","Humboldt University of Berlin alumni","Humboldt University of Berlin faculty","University of Strasbourg faculty","Sociology index","Philosophers of social science","19th-century philosophers","20th-century philosophers"],"headings":["Biography","Foundations of Simmel's theory","Social geometry","Simmel on the metropolis","''The Philosophy of Money''","''The Stranger''","Simmel on secrecy","Simmel on fashion","The work of Simmel","Other works","Works about Simmel and compilations","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4f/Simmel_01.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/82/Plato%2C_Confucius%2C_Avicenna.png/180px-Plato%2C_Confucius%2C_Avicenna.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/Socrates.png/10px-Socrates.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c7/SNA_segment.png/180px-SNA_segment.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/Georg-Simmel-1914.jpg/150px-Georg-Simmel-1914.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Wikiquote-logo-en.svg/40px-Wikiquote-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["structuralism","sociology"],["professor#german","central_european"],["dyad","sociology"],["triad","sociology"],["the_stranger","sociology"],["chicago_school","sociology"]],"members":["the_stranger","chicago_school","triad","dyad","structuralism"],"related":["19th-century_philosophy","Berlin","Kingdom_of_Prussia","Strasbourg","German_Empire","Germans","University_of_Berlin","Philosophy","Sociology","Immanuel_Kant","Max_Weber","Wilhelm_Dilthey","György_Lukács","Eric_Voegelin","Zygmunt_Bauman","Lewis_A._Coser","Harrison_White","Mark_Granovetter","Barry_Wellman","Max_Weber","Herbert_Blumer","Germans","Sociologist","Philosopher","Critic","Neo-Kantian","Antipositivism","Structuralism_(sociology)","Social_sciences","Metropolis","Urban_sociology","Symbolic_interactionism","Social_network","Max_Weber","Ideal_type","Critical_theory","Frankfurt_School","Schopenhauer","Nietzsche","Art","Berlin","Germany","Jew","Roman_Catholic","Lutheran","Baptized","Protestant","Pseudonym","Philosophy","History","Humboldt_University_of_Berlin","Ethics","Logic","Pessimism","Art","Psychology","Sociology","Max_Weber","Max_Weber","Rainer_Maria_Rilke","Stefan_George","Edmund_Husserl","German_Society_for_Sociology","Ferdinand_Tönnies","Max_Weber","University_of_Strasbourg","World_War_I","University_of_Heidelberg","Hepatocellular_carcinoma","Dyad_(sociology)","Triad_(sociology)","The_Stranger_(sociology)","Dresden","Chicago_school_(sociology)","Money","Financialization","Sociological_aspects_of_secrecy","Essayist","Donald_N._Levine","Donald_N._Levine","Donald_N._Levine","Oxfordshire","Progress_Publishers","Moscow","Germany","Sociology","Berlin","Kingdom_of_Prussia","Berlin","Germany"]}
