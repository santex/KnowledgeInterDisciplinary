{"cursor":"5472","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nGenre Tales of HeichÅ« ('HeichÅ« monogatari') belongs to the genre of\n'utamonogatari' poem tales that emerged in Japanese literature from the mid 10th\nto the early 11th centuries. As early as the Collection of Ten-Thousand Leaves\n('ManyÅshÅ«'), a poetry collection completed around 759, there appeared poems\nintroduced by brief prose narrations. The imperial court began to come alive\nwith poetry from around this time. People exchanged poetry with one another on\ntopics as diverse as love and politics and religion. Towards the end of the 9th\ncentury it was common for individual poets to keep compilations of their own\nverse, sometimes explaining in prose the circumstances behind a poem's\ncomposition. The highest honor was to have ones poem selected for inclusion in\nthe Collection of Ancient and Modern Poetry ('KokinshÅ«'), the first imperial\npoetry collection, which was completed around 905. By the middle of the 10th\ncentury the idea of a poem paired with a prose narration seems to have taken\nhold, and Tales of Ise ('Ise monogatari'), Tales of HeichÅ«, and Tales of Yamato\n('Yamato monogatari') seem to have emerged at about this same time.\nAlso, the second imperial poetry collection, Collection of Later Poetry\n('GosenshÅ«'), commissioned in 951 and compiled shortly thereafter, has many\nnarrative qualities. The only extant manuscript of Tales of HeichÅ« is\na 61-page codex discovered in 1931 that seems to date from the Kamakura Period\n(1185â1333), some three hundred years after the work's probable date of\ncomposition.\n\nAuthor The author of Tales of HeichÅ« could have been Taira no Sadafun, whose\nname appears variously as Sadafun, Sadabun, Sadafumi, and Sadabumi (870?-923?),\nbut more likely it was compiled by someone else after his death on the basis of\na non extant personal poetry collection compiled by Sadafun himself and popular\nlegends developing after his death. With nine poems by Sadafun in the Collection\nof Ancient and Modern Poetry, he ranks fourteenth out of the 120 poets whose\nwork appears in the only imperial anthology compiled during his\nlifetime.\n\nTales of Times Now Past ('Konjaku monogatari'), is the first narrative work to\nequate the names Sadafun and HeichÅ«. It has been traditionally\nassumed that the stories about HeichÅ« were based on episodes in the life of the\nhistorical person Taira no Sadafun, but modern scholarship has never been able\nto prove this. Tales of HeichÅ« may have reflected the real Sadafun, but clearly\nthe intent of the work was not simply biographical. Indeed, it may have been\nwholly fictional or based merely on hazy memories of an historical personage\nalready deceased. In the stories HeichÅ« is a courtier of imperial blood whose\nfamily has known better days. Though only of middling rank in the government\nbureaucracy, however, he was recognized in his own time as a sensitive poet of\nsome talent.\n\nHeichÅ« Legend By the mid tenth century, soon after Sadafun's death, his amatory\nescapades began to appear in Tales of Ise, Tales of HeichÅ«, and Tales of Yamato.\nThese stories continued to be told with changes and additions over the next 1000\nyears, his image changing in ways that reflect the cultural milieu of the time.\nDifferent authors focused on the characteristics of the hero that interested\nthem most, whether sensitive poet or spurned lover. Later the amatory ideal\nturns into a profligate rake and then a ridiculous clown. Sometimes his\nportrayed immorality became the basis for a lecture or sermon illustrating some\nmoral issue. He became the object of historical researches, and eventually\nappeared in a pornographic tale or two. HeichÅ« provided a fluid and varied image\nas different authors used him to further their own moral and narrative ends.\n\nWithin the first fifty years of the legend's formation there appeared three of\nthe four stock stories associated with HeichÅ«:\n\nâ¢ The 'mitsu' \"I have seen it!\" story, which is the germ of the more elaborate\nstory of Hon'in JijÅ« that emerges fully developed nearly two centuries later in\nTales of Times Now Past;\n\nâ¢ Fragments of the story of Kunitsune's wife whose kidnapping later become the\nbasis for more detailed narrations involving HeichÅ« and Fujiwara no Tokihira;\n\nâ¢ The story of Musashi, the maiden who takes the tonsure because she believes\nHeichÅ« to have abandoned her after a single night of love-making.\n\nAnother 50 years later there emerges the fourth major story of the HeichÅ«\nlegend: â¢ The 'suminuri' ink-blackening story in which HeichÅ« inadvertently\nblackens his face with \"tears\" of ink.\n\nClearly by the end of the tenth century readers were beginning to laugh at the\nexcesses of HeichÅ«, who had once been appreciated as a lover of refined\nsensibility and elegant poems.\n\nReferences\n\nVideen, Susan Downing. \"HeichÅ« monogatari and the HeichÅ« Legend.\" Ph.
