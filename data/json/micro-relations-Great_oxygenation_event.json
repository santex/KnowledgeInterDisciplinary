Stage 1 (3.85â2.45 Ga):\n  Practically no O 2 in the atmosphere. Stage 2 (2.45â1.85 Ga):\n  O 2 produced, but absorbed in oceans & seabed rock. Stage 3\n  (1.85â0.85 Ga): O 2 starts to gas out of the oceans, but is absorbed\n  by land surfaces. Stages 4 & 5 (0.85âpresent): O 2 sinks\n  filled and the gas accumulates.

Vol. 361. 2006. p. 903â915. ]]\n\nThe 'Great Oxygenation Event (GOE)', also called the 'Oxygen Catastrophe' or\n'Oxygen Crisis' or 'Great Oxidation', was the biologically induced appearance of\nfree oxygen (O 2) in Earth's atmosphere. Geological, isotopic, and\nchemical evidence suggest this major environmental change happened around 2.4\nbillion years ago (2.4 Ga).\n\nCyanobacteria, which appeared about 200 million years before the GOE,\nbegan producing oxygen by photosynthesis. Before the GOE, any free oxygen they\nproduced was chemically captured by dissolved iron organic matter. The GOE was\nthe point when these oxygen sinks became saturated and could not capture all of\nthe oxygen that was produced by cyanobacterial photosynthesis. After the GOE the\nexcess free oxygen started to accumulate in the atmosphere.\n\nFree oxygen is toxic to anaerobic organisms and the rising concentrations may\nhave wiped out most of the Earth's anaerobic inhabitants at the time. From their\nperspective it was a catastrophe. Cyanobacteria were therefore responsible for\none of the most significant extinction events in Earth's history. Additionally\nthe free oxygen reacted with the atmospheric methane, a greenhouse gas,\ntriggering the Huronian glaciation, possibly the longest snowball Earth episode.\nFree oxygen has been an important constituent of the atmosphere ever since.\n","linknr":302,"url":"Great_oxygenation_event","recorded":1362477474,"links":37,"instances":["biochemistry","geology","element","geology","geology","ecology"],"pdf":["http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/361/1470/903.full.pdf","http://www.cosis.net/abstracts/EGU06/00770/EGU06-J-00770.pdf","http://www.cosis.net/abstracts/EGU06/00770/EGU06-J-00770.pdf"],"categories":["Proterozoic","Oxygen","Climate history","Geological history of Earth","Extinction events"],"headings":["Timing","Time lag theory","Late evolution of oxy-photosynthesis theory","Role in mineral diversification","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/03/Oxygenation-atm-2.svg/420px-Oxygenation-atm-2.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["biota","ecology"],["rock","geology"],["nickel","element"],["cofactor","biochemistry"],["mantle","geology"],["crust","geology"]],"members":["cofactor","mantle","nickel","rock","crust","biota"],"related":["Biota_(ecology)","Cyanobacteria","Photosynthesis","Anaerobic_organism","Cyanobacteria","Extinction_events","Greenhouse_gas","Huronian_glaciation","Snowball_Earth","Geological_history_of_oxygen","Eukaryotic","Photosynthesis","Banded_iron_formations","Animikie_Group","Mass-independent_fractionation","Greenhouse_gas","Huronian_glaciation","Snowball_Earth","Oxygen_catastrophe","Evolution","Rock_(geology)","Sand","Clay","Organic_matter","Thermodynamic_free_energy","Mitochondria","Iron","Banded_iron_formation","Iron_ore","Methane","Oxidation","Carbon_dioxide","Ultraviolet","Methanogens","Nickel_(element)","Cofactor_(biochemistry)","Bistability","Ozone_layer","Steady_state","Photodissociation","Huronian_glaciation","Mineral","Hydrated","Oxidized","Mantle_(geology)","Crust_(geology)","Age_of_Earth","Banded_iron_formation","Evolution_of_dietary_antioxidants","Geological_history_of_oxygen","Iodide","Medea_hypothesis","Pasteur_point","Huronian_glaciation"]}
