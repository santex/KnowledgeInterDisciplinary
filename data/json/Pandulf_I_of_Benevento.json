{"cursor":"8184","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Pandulf I Ironhead' Also spelled Randulf, Bandulf, Pandulph, Pandolf,\nPandolfo, Paldolf, or Paldolfo. His nickname is Testa di Ferro, Testaferrata, or\nCapodiferro in Italian and Capi(te)ferreus in Latin. (died March 981) was\nthe Prince of Benevento and Capua from 943 (or 944) until his death. He was made\nDuke of Spoleto and Camerino in 967 and succeeded as Prince of Salerno in 977 or\n978. He was an important nobleman in the fight with the Byzantines and Saracens\nfor control of the Mezzogiorno in the centuries after the collapse of Lombard\nand Carolingian authority on the Italian Peninsula. He established himself over\nalmost the whole of the southern half of Italia before his death in March 981.\n\nHis mother was Yvantia. He co-reigned with his father, Landulf II, from 943,\nwhen his grandfather Landulf I died, and with his brother Landulf III from 959.\nSometime about 955, Pope John XII led an army of Romans, Tuscans, and Spoletans\nagainst Landulf II and Pandulf, but Gisulf I of Salerno came to their rescue and\nno battle was given. The pope and Gisulf made a treaty at Terracina. Gisulf and\nPandulf had a strong alliance after that.\n\nIn 961, Landulf II died and Pandulf and his brother became sole princes, though\nthe elder Pandulf was by far the more domineering. The [[Chronicum\nSalernitanum]] affirms the co-regency, however, and the principle of the\nindivisibility of the united Capua-Benevento as declared by Atenulf I in 900,\nwhen it says Beneventanorum principatum eius filii Pandolfum et Landulfum\nbifarie regebant . . . communi indivisoque iure, that is \"the Beneventan\nprincipality was reigned in jointly by Pandulf and Landulf under indivisible\ncommon jurisdiction.\" However, this system eventually collapsed and Pandulf\nruled in Capua while Landulf ruled in Benevento. The Chronicum says Pandulf\ntenuit principatum una cum suo germanus annos octo, that is, \"held the\nprincipality solely with his brother for eight years.\"\n\nLate in 965, a rebellion in Rome overthrew Pope John XIII, who was arrested and\ncarted off to imprisonment in Campania. Whether he escaped or was released, he\narrived in Capua not much later, seeking the protection of Pandulf, who gladly\ngave it. In return, and for the favour of the citizens, he erected Capua into an\narchdiocese and gave Pandulf's brother John the pallium. After ten months of\nexile, another revolt in Rome gave opportunity for return and Pandulf sent the\npope back with a Capuan escort.\n\nIn 967, the Emperor Otto I came down to Rome and granted Pandulf the vacant\nDuchy of Spoleto of Camerino and charged him with prosecuting the war against\nthe Byzantine Empire. Pandulf and Landulf introduced Prince Gisulf of Salerno to\nthe emperor at this time. They then took part in the imperial campaign of 968,\nbut Landulf retired in illness and died at Benevento leaving two sons: Pandulf\nand Landulf. Even though Pandulf was with the emperor on the border of Calabria\nwhen news of Landulf's death reached him, he quickly returned to Benevento and\nassociated with him his own eldest son Landulf, who was crowned prince in the\nchurch of Sancta Sophia, before rejoining the imperial campaign. In that year,\nOtto left the siege of Bari in the charge of Pandulf, but the Lombard was\ncaptured in the Battle of Bovino (969) by the Byzantines and jailed in\nConstantinople. In 970, during his absence, the Byzantines besieged Capua and\nMarinus II of Naples ravaged the countryside. He was released later in the deal\nin which the Byzantine emperor John Tzimisces gave Theophanu in marriage to\nOtto's son Otto II. During his absence, the great principality had been\nadministered by Landulf I, Archbishop of Benevento, and the young Landulf, with\nhelp from his mother, Pandulf's wife, Aloara. Benevento had been made an\narchdiocese in 969.\n\nIn the 960s, Byzantium had been trying to supplant German influence in Salerno\nand to this end may have engineered the rebellion which temporarily unseated\nJohn XIII, a pro-German pope. Prince Gisulf of Salerno, however, was allied both\nto the Greeks and to his Lombard neighbour Pandulf, whom he had rescued some\nyears before and who was, in fact, staunchly pro-German and anti-Greek. When\nGisulf was deposed and removed from office by Pandulf's cousin, Landulf of\nConza, in 973, Pandulf restored Gisulf as his vassal. When Gisulf died childless\nin 977 or 978, Pandulf succeeded in Salerno as per their prior agreement. The\npolicy of the Greeks was a thorough failure and Pandulf (and his Germans) was\nthe winner in southern Italy. He had united all three of the Lombard\nprincipalities — Benevento, Capua, and Salerno — and had even gained\nSpoleto and Camerino. He ruled a large bloc of territories that stretched as far\nnorth as Tuscany and as far south as the Gulf of Taranto. \"from Ancona to\nthe fringes of Calabria\" in Wickham, 156.\n\nPandulf's lands were partitioned among his sons, who fought endlessly over the\ninheritance. His son Landulf IV received Capua and Benevento and Pandulf II\nreceived Salerno. Otto II came down to Rome in 981, however, and Spoleto was\ngiven to Thrasimund IV, Duke of Camerino. Then, Pandulf's nephew Pandulf was\ngiven Benevento in a partition of Landulf's territory, in which Landulf kept\nCapua. Finally, Manso I of Amalfi dispossessed the younger Pandulf of Salerno\nand was confirmed by the Emperor.\n\nPandulf had several other sons: Landenulf, who succeeded Landulf IV in Capua;\nLaidulf, who succeeded Landenulf; and Atenulf, who died at the Battle of Stilo\non 13 July 982.\n","linknr":162,"url":"Pandulf_I_of_Benevento","recorded":1375082771,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Pandulf_Ironhead&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Pandulf_Ironhead&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","/wiki/Pandulf_Ironhead","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","/w/index.php?title=Pandulf_I_of_Benevento&redirect=no","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Torre_di_capodiferro_Cartolina.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/Torre_di_capodiferro_Cartolina.jpg/220px-Torre_di_capodiferro_Cartolina.jpg","/wiki/File:Torre_di_capodiferro_Cartolina.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","#cite_note-1","/wiki/List_of_Dukes_and_Princes_of_Benevento","/wiki/Prince_of_Capua","/wiki/Duke_of_Spoleto","/wiki/Prince_of_Salerno","/wiki/Byzantine_Empire","/wiki/Saracens","/wiki/Mezzogiorno","/wiki/Lombards","/wiki/Carolingian","/wiki/Italian_Peninsula","/wiki/Landulf_II_of_Benevento","/wiki/Landulf_I_of_Benevento","/wiki/Landulf_III_of_Benevento","/wiki/Pope_John_XII","/wiki/Rome","/wiki/March_of_Tuscany","/wiki/Duchy_of_Spoleto","/wiki/Gisulf_I_of_Salerno","/wiki/Terracina","/wiki/Chronicum_Salernitanum","/wiki/Atenulf_I_of_Capua","/wiki/Pope_John_XIII","/wiki/Campania","/wiki/Emperor_Otto_I","/wiki/Duchy_of_Spoleto","/wiki/Byzantine_Empire","/wiki/Pandulf_II_of_Benevento","/wiki/Landulf_VII_of_Capua","/wiki/Landulf_IV_of_Benevento","/wiki/Bari","/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_Bovino&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Constantinople","/wiki/Marinus_II_of_Naples","/wiki/Byzantine_emperor","/wiki/John_Tzimisces","/wiki/Theophanu","/wiki/Otto_II,_Holy_Roman_Emperor","/w/index.php?title=Landulf_I,_Archbishop_of_Benevento&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Aloara_of_Capua","/wiki/Landulf_of_Conza","/wiki/Gulf_of_Taranto","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Pandulf_II_of_Salerno","/w/index.php?title=Thrasimund_IV_of_Spoleto&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Pandulf_II_of_Benevento","/wiki/Manso_I_of_Amalfi","/wiki/Landenulf_II_of_Capua","/wiki/Laidulf_of_Capua","/wiki/Battle_of_Stilo","/w/index.php?title=Pandulf_Ironhead&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","/wiki/Italian_language","/wiki/Latin_language","#cite_ref-2","/w/index.php?title=Pandulf_Ironhead&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Ferdinand_Gregorovius","/wiki/H._M._Gwatkin","/wiki/Landulf_IV_of_Capua","/wiki/Prince_of_Capua","/wiki/Landulf_IV_of_Benevento","/wiki/Prince_of_Benevento","/wiki/Gisulf_I_of_Salerno","/wiki/Prince_of_Salerno","/wiki/Pandulf_II_of_Salerno","/w/index.php?title=Thrasimund_III_of_Spoleto&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Duke_of_Spoleto","/w/index.php?title=Thrasimund_IV_of_Spoleto&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pandulf_Ironhead&oldid=553630504","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Lombard_people","/wiki/Category:Princes_of_Benevento","/wiki/Category:Princes_of_Capua","/wiki/Category:Princes_of_Salerno","/wiki/Category:Dukes_of_Spoleto","/wiki/Category:10th-century_Italian_people","/wiki/Category:981_deaths","/wiki/Category:10th-century_rulers_in_Europe","/wiki/Category:Use_dmy_dates_from_January_2012","/wiki/Category:Year_of_birth_unknown","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Pandulf+Ironhead&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Pandulf+Ironhead","/wiki/Pandulf_Ironhead","/wiki/Talk:Pandulf_Ironhead","#","/wiki/Pandulf_Ironhead","/w/index.php?title=Pandulf_Ironhead&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Pandulf_Ironhead&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Pandulf_Ironhead","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Pandulf_Ironhead","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages"
