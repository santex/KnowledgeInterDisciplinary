Vitamin A is needed by the retina of the eye in the\nform of retinal, which combines with protein opsin to form rhodopsin the light-\nabsorbing molecule , name=Wolf> that is necessary for both low-light\n(scotopic vision) and color vision. Vitamin A also functions in a\nvery different role as an irreversibly oxidized form of retinol known as\nretinoic acid, which is an important hormone-like growth factor for epithelial\nand other cells.\n\nIn foods of animal origin, the major form of vitamin A is an ester, primarily\nretinyl palmitate, which is converted to retinol (chemically an alcohol) in the\nsmall intestine. The retinol form functions as a storage form of the vitamin,\nand can be converted to and from its visually active aldehyde form, retinal. The\nassociated acid (retinoic acid), a metabolite that can be irreversibly\nsynthesized from vitamin A, has only partial vitamin A activity, and does not\nfunction in the retina for the visual cycle. Retinoic acid is used for growth\nand cellular differentiation  name=Tanumihardjo> .\n\nAll forms of vitamin A have a beta-ionone ring to which an isoprenoid chain is\nattached, called a retinyl group. Both structural features are essential for\nvitamin activity. Carolyn Berdanier. 1997. Advanced Nutrition\nMicronutrients. CRC Press, ISBN 0849326648, pp. 22â39 The orange pigment\nof carrots â beta-carotene â can be represented as two connected retinyl groups,\nwhich are used in the body to contribute to vitamin A levels. Alpha-carotene and\ngamma-carotene also have a single retinyl group, which give them some vitamin\nactivity. None of the other carotenes have vitamin activity. The carotenoid beta-\ncryptoxanthin possesses an ionone group and has vitamin activity in humans.\n\nVitamin A can be found in two principal forms in foods:\n\n*Retinol, the form of vitamin A absorbed when eating animal food sources, is a\nyellow, fat-soluble substance. Since the pure alcohol form is unstable, the\nvitamin is found in tissues in a form of retinyl ester. It is also commercially\nproduced and administered as esters such as retinyl acetate or\npalmitate.\n\n*The carotenes alpha-carotene, beta-carotene, gamma-carotene; and the\nxanthophyll beta-cryptoxanthin (all of which contain beta-ionone rings), but no\nother carotenoids, function as provitamin A in herbivores and omnivore animals,\nwhich possess the enzyme (15-15'-dioxygenase) which cleaves beta-carotene in the\nintestinal mucosa and converts it retinol  name=deMan> . In general,\ncarnivores are poor converters of ionine-containing carotenoids, and pure\ncarnivores such as cats and ferrets lack 15-15'-dioxygenase and cannot convert\nany carotenoids to retinal (resulting in none of the carotenoids being forms of\nvitamin A for these species).\n","linknr":792,"url":"Vitamin_A","recorded":1362511251,"links":80,"instances":["chemist","food","symptom","food"],"pdf":["http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/foodcomp/Data/SR20/SR20_doc.pdf","http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/DRI//DRI_Vitamin_A/82-161_150.pdf","http://www.unicef.org/publications/files/Vitamin_A_Supplementation.pdf","http://www.unicef.org/nutrition/files/Vitamin_A_Supplementation.pdf","http://www.unitedcalltoaction.org/documents/Investing_in_the_future.pdf"],"categories":["Vitamins|A"],"headings":["History","Equivalencies of retinoids and carotenoids (IU)","Recommended daily intake","Sources","Metabolic functions","Deficiency","Toxicity","Vitamin A and derivatives in medical use","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/All-trans-Retinol2.svg/177px-All-trans-Retinol2.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3c/Retinol_3D_ball.png/177px-Retinol_3D_ball.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/X_mark.svg/7px-X_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fb/Yes_check.svg/7px-Yes_check.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fb/Yes_check.svg/7px-Yes_check.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fb/Yes_check.svg/7px-Yes_check.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fb/Yes_check.svg/7px-Yes_check.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fb/Yes_check.svg/7px-Yes_check.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fb/Yes_check.svg/7px-Yes_check.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/X_mark.svg/14px-X_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e6/Carrots.JPG/250px-Carrots.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["thomas_burr_osborne","chemist"],["liver","food"],["liver","food"],["liver","food"],["egg","food"],["anorexia","symptom"]],"members":["thomas_burr_osborne","liver","anorexia","egg"],"related":["Retina","Retinal","Rhodopsin","Scotopic","Color_vision","Retinol","Retinoic_acid","Growth_factor","Epithelial","Ester","Retinyl_palmitate","Retinol","Alcohol","Aldehyde","Retinal","Ionone","Isoprene","Carrots","Beta-carotene","Alpha-Carotene","Gamma-carotene","Cryptoxanthin","Food","Retinol","Retinyl_acetate","Retinyl_palmitate","Carotene","Xanthophyll","Carotenoid","Herbivore","15-15'-dioxygenase","Carbohydrate","Protein","Fat","Elmer_McCollum","University_of_Wisconsin–Madison","Lafayette_Mendel","Thomas_Burr_Osborne_(chemist)","Yale_University","International_unit","Microgram","USDA","Alpha-carotene","Gamma-carotene","Cryptoxanthin","Institute_of_Medicine","Food_and_Nutrition_Board","Institute_of_Medicine","Beta-carotene","Alpha-carotene","Beta-cryptoxanthin","Vegetarian","Night_blindness","Vegan","United_States_National_Academy_of_Sciences","Recommended_daily_allowance","Dietary_Reference_Intake","Dietary_Reference_Intake","Retinol","Dietary","Toxic","Cod_liver_oil","Liver_(food)","Liver_(food)","Liver_(food)","Taraxacum","Carrot","Broccoli","Sweet_potato","Butter","Kale","Spinach","Pumpkin","Collard_greens","Cheddar_cheese","Cantaloupe_melon","Egg_(food)","Apricot","Papaya","Mango","Pea","Broccoli","Milk","Tomatoes","Recommended_Dietary_Allowance","Gram","Haematopoiesis","Hox","Acne","Isotretinoin","Apoptosis","Teratogen","Retinoic_acid","Xerophthalmia","Burkina_Faso","Zinc","Xerophthalmia","Xerosis","Bitot's_spots","Keratomalacia_which_is_the_liquefaction_of_part_or_all_cornea","Keratosis_pilaris","Squamous_metaplasia","Postnatal","Birth_defects","Canadian_International_Development_Agency","Helen_Keller_International","Micronutrient_Initiative","UNICEF","USAID","World_Bank","International_unit","Kilogram","Renal_failure","Anorexia_(symptom)","Insomnia","Isotretinoin","Retinoid","13-cis_retinoic_acid","Pseudotumor_cerebri","Carotenodermia","Retinyl_palmitate","Retinoid","13-cis-retinoic_acid"]}
