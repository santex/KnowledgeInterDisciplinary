This view includes the case of \"spontaneous standardization\nprocesses\", to produce de facto standards.\n","linknr":247,"url":"Standardization","recorded":1362540037,"links":42,"instances":["organization","computing","disambiguation","business"],"pdf":["http://www.arussell.org/papers/futuregeneration-russell.pdf"],"categories":["Standards","Engineering","Standardization"],"headings":["Usage","Techniques","Historically important standards","Other uses","Types","See also","References","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["quality","business"],["oasis","organization"],["501(c(3"],["open_system","computing"],["template","disambiguation"]],"members":["oasis","open_system","template","quality"],"related":["Technical_standard","Wholesaler","Commoditization","Interoperability","Safety","Repeatability","Quality_(business)","Social_sciences","Economics","Coordination_problem","Ratification","De_facto_standard","Validation_and_verification","USB","Ethernet","Lean_manufacturing","Social_sciences","UN/CEFACT","W3C","OASIS_(organization)","Customer_service","British_Standards_Institution","The_International_Customer_Service_Institute","The_International_Customer_Service_Institute","De_facto_standard","De_jure","ABNT","Asociación_Española_de_Normalización_y_Certificación","Association_française_de_Normalisation","American_National_Standards_Institute","BSI_Group","DGN","DIN","Instituto_Argentino_de_Normalización_y_Certificación","Japanese_Industrial_Standards_Committee","Korean_Agency_for_Technology_and_Standards","South_African_Bureau_of_Standards","Standardization_Administration_of_China","Standards_Council_of_Canada","Swedish_Standards_Institute","SNZ","International_Organization_for_Standardisation","Standards_Council_of_Canada","American_National_Standards_Institute","Crown_Corporation","501(c)(3)","Specification","Internet","W3C","IETF","Request_for_Comments","Interchangeability","Commonality","Reference","Value_engineering","Statistical_process_control","Interchangeable_parts","Joseph_Whitworth","British_Standard_Whitworth","Track_gauge","Statistics","Standard_score","Test_theory","Supply_chain_management","Procurement","Manufacturing","New_institutional_economics","Coordination_game","International_marketing","Mass_production","De_facto_standard","Tradition","Standards_organization","7.62×51_NATO","American_National_Standards_Institute","ASTM","Commodity","Conformity_assessment","Embrace,_extend_and_extinguish","Environmental_standard","International_Classification_for_Standards","International_standard","Interoperability","Network_effect","Open_format","Open_standard","Open_system_(computing)","OpenDocument","Quality_infrastructure","Standard_gauge","Standards_organization","Template_(disambiguation)","Transport_standards_organisations","Vendor_lock-in","Java_Community_Process"]}
