{"cursor":"36021","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n attack helicopter provides close air support to United States Army soldiers\n patrolling the Tigris River southeast of Baghdad, Iraq during the Iraq War]]\n\nIn military tactics, 'close air support' ('CAS') is defined as air action by\nfixed or rotary winged aircraft against hostile targets that are close to\nfriendly forces, and which requires detailed integration of each air mission\nwith fire and movement of these forces. [[#DoD\nJointTactics|Joint Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Close Air Support]]\n(2003). DoD.\n\nThe determining factor for CAS is detailed integration, not proximity. CAS may\nneed to be conducted far from friendly forces, if the mission requires detailed\nintegration with the fire and movement of these forces. A closely related subset\nof air interdiction, 'battlefield air interdiction' denotes interdiction against\nunits with near-term effects on friendly units, but which does not require\nintegration with friendly troop movements. The term \"battlefield air\ninterdiction\" is not currently used in US joint doctrine.\n\nClose air support requires excellent coordination with ground forces. In\nadvanced modern militaries, this coordination is typically handled by\nspecialists such as Joint Fires Observers, Joint Terminal Attack Controllers\n(JTAC)s, and Forward Air Controllers (FAC).\n","linknr":432,"url":"Close_air_support","recorded":1362535193,"links":48,"instances":["raf_officer","tank","nazi_germany","world_war_ii","united_states","world_war_ii"],"pdf":["http://www.ifri.org/downloads/fs35bistenenbaum.pdf","http://carl.army.mil/download/csipubs/horwood.pdf","http://carl.army.mil/download/csipubs/horwood.pdf","http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/jel/new_pubs/jp3_09_3.pdf","http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/jel/new_pubs/jp3_09_3.pdf","http://www.ifri.org/downloads/fs35bistenenbaum.pdf","http://www.af.mil/library/posture/Anaconda_Unclassified.pdf"],"categories":["Aerial
