The result of this union is the\nproduction of a zygote, or fertilized egg, initiating prenatal development.\nScientists discovered the dynamics of human fertilization in the nineteenth\ncentury.

The most\ncommon sequence begins with ejaculation during copulation, follows with\novulation, and finishes with fertilization. Various exceptions to this sequence\nare possible, including artificial insemination, ''In vitro'' fertilization,\nexternal ejaculation without copulation, or copulation shortly after ovulation.-\nhttp://www.goaskalice.columbia.edu/0116.html http://www.american-\npregnancy.org/preventingpregnancy/pregnancyfaqmyths.html Lawyers Guide\nto Forensic Medicine ISBN 978-1-85941-159-9 By Bernard Knight - Page 188\n\"Pregnancy is well known to occur from such external ejaculation ...\" Upon\nencountering the ovum, the acrosome of the sperm produces enzymes which allow it\nto burrow through the outer jelly coat of the egg. The sperm plasma then fuses\nwith the egg's plasma membrane, the sperm head disconnects from its flagellum\nand the egg travels down the Fallopian tube to reach the uterus.\n\nIn vitro fertilization (IVF) is a process by which egg cells are fertilized by\nsperm outside the womb, [[in vitro]].\n","linknr":277,"url":"Human_fertilization","recorded":1362373528,"links":17,"instances":["embryology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Fertility"],"headings":["Anatomy","Fusion","Diseases","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/83/Acrosome_reaction_diagram_en.svg/400px-Acrosome_reaction_diagram_en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["corona_radiata","embryology"]],"members":["corona_radiata"],"related":["Ovum","Spermatozoon","Ampulla_of_uterine_tube","Prenatal_development","Ejaculation","Copulation","Ovulation","Artificial_insemination","In_vitro_fertilization","Corona_radiata_(embryology)","Oocyte","Ooplasm","Zona_pellucida","Acrosome","Kin_selection","Cortical_reaction","Hydrolyse","Cell_membrane","Oocyte","Meiosis","Ovum","Pronucleus","Mitochondria","Pronucleus","DNA","Mitotic","Chromosome","Mitotic_spindle","Polyspermy","Spontaneous_conception"]}
