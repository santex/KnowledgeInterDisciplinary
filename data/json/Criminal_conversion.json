{"cursor":"1956","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Criminal conversion' is the crime of exerting unauthorized use or control of\nsomeone else's property. It differs from theft in that it does not include the\nelement of intending to deprive the owner of the possession of that property. As\nsuch, it is a lesser included offense of the crime of theft. Criminal conversion\nspecifies a type of conversion in that it involves criminal law, not civil law.\n\nAn example might be tapping someone's secured wireless LAN or public utility\nline (which could also amount to theft of services). Another example might be\ntaking a joy ride in a car, never intending to keep it from the owner. Some\nplaces have defined such conduct as a specific type of theft, perhaps with a\nmodified penalty.\n\nNote that the \"unauthorized\" use may begin after a period of authorized use,\nwhere, for example, a person rents a car then keeps it for an extra week without\npermission from the rental company. Another common example occurs when a person\nfails to report finding lost goods (including animals), intending only to keep\nthem until someone asks for their return. When the intent becomes one of keeping\nthe property, it is a theft.\n","linknr":147,"url":"Criminal_conversion","recorded":1362684493,"links":21,"instances":["common_law","law"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Crimes"],"headings":["Fraudulent conversion","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/Scale_of_justice_2.svg/100px-Scale_of_justice_2.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/Standard_legirons_taiwan01.jpg/40px-Standard_legirons_taiwan01.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["conversion","law"],["civil_law","common_law"],["conversion","law"]],"members":["civil_law","conversion"],"related":["Crime","Property","Theft","Conversion_(law)","Criminal_law","Civil_law_(common_law)","Wireless_LAN","Theft_of_services","Joy_ride","England_and_Wales","Larceny_Act_1901","Larceny_Act_1916","Theft","Theft_Act_1968","Conversion_(law)","Embezzlement","TWOC"]}
