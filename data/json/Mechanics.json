The scientific discipline has its\norigins in Ancient Greece with the writings of Aristotle and Archimedes\nDugas, Rene. A History of Classical Mechanics.

During the early\nmodern period, scientists such as Galileo, Kepler, and especially Newton, laid\nthe foundation for what is now known as classical mechanics. It is a branch of\nclassical physics that deals with the particles that are moving either with less\nvelocity or that are at rest. It can also be defined as a branch of science\nwhich deals with the motion and force of the particular object.
