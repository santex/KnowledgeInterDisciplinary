He was born in the Soviet Union. He received his\nmaster's degree in mathematics at the Uzbek State University, Samarkand, Uzbek\nSSR in 1958 and Ph.D in statistics at the Institute of Control Sciences, Moscow\nin 1964. He worked at this institute from 1961 to 1990 and became Head of the\nComputer Science Research Department. At the end of 1990, he moved to the USA\nand joined the Adaptive Systems Research Department at AT&T Bell Labs in\nHolmdel, New Jersey. The group later became the Image Processing Research\nDepartment of AT&T Laboratories when AT&T spun off Lucent Technologies in 1996.\nVapnik Left AT&T in 2002 and joined NEC Laboratories in Princeton, New Jersey,\nwhere he currently works in the Machine Learning group. He also holds a\nProfessor of Computer Science and Statistics position at Royal Holloway,\nUniversity of London since 1995, as well as a position as Professor of Computer\nScience at Columbia University, New York City since 2003. He was inducted into\nthe U.S. National Academy of Engineering in 2006. He received the 2005 Gabor\nAward,<ref>[http://www.inns.org/awards.asp International Neural Network\nSociety.]</ref> the 2008 Paris Kanellakis Award, the 2010 Neural Networks\nPioneer Award,<ref>[http://ieee-cis.org/awards/recipients/ IEEE Computational\nIntelligence Society.]</ref> the 2012 IEEE Frank Rosenblatt Award, and the 2012\nBenjamin Franklin Medal in Computer and Cognitive Science from the Franklin\nInstitute.<ref>}}</ref>\n\nWhile at AT&T, Vapnik and his colleagues developed the theory of the support\nvector machine. They demonstrated its performance on a number of problems of\ninterest to the machine learning community, including handwriting recognition.\n","title":"Vladimir%20Vapnik","headings":["Writings","See also","External links","Notes"]},"micro-relation":["1: VapnikâChervonenkis_theory","1: Soviet_Union","1: Master's_degree","1: Mathematics","1: Samarkand_State_University","1: Samarkand","1: Uzbek_Soviet_Socialist_Republic","1: Doctor_of_Philosophy","1: Statistics","1: Moscow","1: United_States","1: AT&T_Corporation","1: Bell_Labs","1: Holmdel,_New_Jersey","1: AT&T_Laboratories","1: Lucent_Technologies","1: NEC","1: Princeton,_New_Jersey","1: Royal_Holloway,_University_of_London","1: Columbia_University","1: New_York_City","1: National_Academy_of_Engineering","1: Paris_Kanellakis_Award","1: IEEE_Frank_Rosenblatt_Award","1: Franklin_Institute","1: Support_vector_machine","1: Machine_learning","1: Handwriting_recognition","1: Alexey_Chervonenkis"]}
