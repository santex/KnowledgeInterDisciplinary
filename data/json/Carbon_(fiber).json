{"cursor":"15947","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n 'Carbon fiber', alternatively '[[graphite]] fiber', 'carbon\ngraphite' or 'CF', is a material consisting of fibers about 5â10 Î¼m in\ndiameter and composed mostly of carbon atoms. The carbon atoms are bonded\ntogether in crystals that are more or less aligned parallel to the long axis of\nthe fiber. The crystal alignment gives the fiber high strength-to-volume ratio\n(making it strong for its size). Several thousand carbon fibers are bundled\ntogether to form a tow, which may be used by itself or woven into a fabric.\n\nThe properties of carbon fibers, such as high stiffness, high tensile strength,\nlow weight, high chemical resistance, high temperature tolerance and low\nthermal expansion, make them very popular in aerospace, civil engineering,\nmilitary, and motorsports, along with other competition sports. However, they\nare relatively expensive when compared to similar fibers, such as glass fibers\nor plastic fibers.\n\nCarbon fibers are usually combined with other materials to form a composite.\nWhen combined with a plastic resin and wound or molded it forms carbon fiber\nreinforced plastic (often referred to as carbon fiber) which has a very high strength-to-\nweight ratio, and is extremely rigid although somewhat brittle. However, carbon\nfibers are also composed with other materials, such as with graphite to form carbon-\ncarbon composites, which have a very high heat tolerance.\n","linknr":396,"url":"Carbon_(fiber)","recorded":1362552016,"links":57,"instances":["united_kingdom","physicist_","polymers","resin","fiber"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Carbon forms","Synthetic fibers","Woven fabrics","Nonwoven fabrics","Net fabrics"],"headings":["History of carbon fiber","Structure and properties","Applications","Synthesis","Textile","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/44/Kohlenstofffasermatte.jpg/220px-Kohlenstofffasermatte.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/71/Cfaser_haarrp.jpg/200px-Cfaser_haarrp.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Cfk_heli_slw.jpg/120px-Cfk_heli_slw.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5d/PAN_stabilization.PNG/250px-PAN_stabilization.PNG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2d/Hanfstengel.jpg/140px-Hanfstengel.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["glass","fiber"],["roger_bacon","physicist_"],["ministry_of_defence","united_kingdom"],["pitch","resin"],["pitch","resin"],["spinning","polymers"],["pitch","resin"],["pitch","resin"],["tex","unit#tex"]],"members":["ministry_of_defence","roger_bacon","spinning","pitch","tex","glass"],"related":["Fibers","Carbon","Tow","Woven","Glass_(fiber)","Composite_material","Plastic","Carbon_fiber_reinforced_plastic","Strength-to-weight_ratio","Roger_Bacon_(physicist)_","Union_Carbide","Cleveland","Ohio","Rayon","Carbonization","Akio_Shindo","National_Institute_of_Advanced_Industrial_Science_and_Technology","Japan","Polyacrylonitrile","Royal_Aircraft_Establishment","Farnborough,_Hampshire","Ministry_of_Defence_(United_Kingdom)","National_Research_Development_Corporation","Rolls-Royce_Limited","Courtaulds","Rolls-Royce_RB211","House_of_Commons_of_the_United_Kingdom","Micrometre","Carbon","Micrometre","Graphite","Atoms","Graphene","Hexagon","Crystalline","Van_der_Waals_force","Polyacrylonitrile","Mesophase","Pitch_(resin)","Tensile_strength","Young's_modulus","Thermal_conductivity","Composite_material","Carbon_fiber_reinforced_polymer","Carbide","Corrosion","Metal_matrix_composite","Reinforced_carbon-carbon","Filtration","Electrode","Corrosion","Triboelectric_effect","Polymer","Rayon","Polyacrylonitrile","Pitch_(resin)","Spinning_(polymers)","Carbonization","Bobbin","Acrylonitrile","Oxidized","Argon","Graphene","Pitch_(resin)","Rayon","Tensile_strength","Pound_force_per_square_inch","Modulus_of_elasticity","Hexcel","SGL_Carbon","Toho_Tenax","Toray_Industries","Zoltek","Polyacrylonitrile","Rayon","Pitch_(resin)","Weaving","Textile","Cloth","Twill","Satin_weave","Plain_weave","Knitting","Braiding","Carbon_fiber_reinforced_polymer","Ceramic_matrix_composite","Carbon_nanotube","Flight_International"]}
