At the\ntender age of ten, he started playing organized soccer for the Valletta\nLilywhites in the Valletta youth league which used to be played at the Xara\nGrounds (i.e. the Independence Arena in Floriana) every Sunday morning in front\nof huge crowds.\n\nCharlie entered Stella Maris College when he was 11 years old and quickly\nestablished himself as one of the top players that Stella Maris College ever\nhad. Despite only being 11 years old, he represented his schoolâs top team on a\nregular basis.\n\nBetween playing at his school and his local Valletta Lilywhites team, Charlie\nwould train and play soccer an average of 4 hours per day, 7 days a week.\n\nDuring his playing days at the Independence Arena, Charlie was discovered by\nValletta FC officials and was asked to join Valletta FC at the age of 13 years\nold. At 16 years old, Charlie was the captain of the Valletta FC minors team,\nwhile also playing for the under 21 team and the Valletta FC reserves team on a\nregular basis.\n\nBy now everybody in both Valletta and Malta was seeing the potential that\nCharlie Williams had in the game of soccer. Consequently, the Malta Football\nAssociation (MFA) quickly picked him to represent Malta as a youth\nInternational.\n\nCharlie Williams made his Valletta FC debut at age 17 and made the number 4\nshirt his own. He quickly became Vallettaâs mainstay, playing the important role\nof a midfielder.\n\nCharlie was considered to be one of the strongest players in Malta during the\n60âs and also one of the top technical players. He scored many important goals\nfor Valletta FC and to this day Valletta fans still talk about the amazing goal\nhe scored against Norwich City FC. Another crucial goal that Charlie scored was\nagainst Floriana FC 3 minutes from time to give Valletta FC their 1962/63\nchampionship.\n\nDuring his stay with Valletta FC, Charlie Williams won all the honors. He won\nthe League Championship, Scicluna Cup, FA Trophy and the Cassar Cup. He\nrepresented Valletta FC in European competitions, playing against Dukla Praha in\nthe UEFA Champions League (formerly the European Cup) and against Real Zaragoza\nin the UEFA Europa League (formerly UEFA Cup Winnersâ Cup).\n\nAt the age of 18, Charlie Williams made his International debut playing for the\nMalta National Football Team against Italy C. Charlie also played for the Malta\nNational Football Team at the Liguria, Italy tournament where Malta finished in\n3rd place, beating Italy and tying Holland.\n\nAt the age of 23, Charlie was already a Maltese soccer star, so it was not a\nsurprise when first Norwich City FC, and then the newly formed professional\nsoccer league in the USA, National Professional Soccer League (NPSL), were\nrecruiting Charlie. Unfortunately, for both Valletta and Malta, in 1967\nCharlie decided to sign a professional contract to play in the NPSL, which\nlater became the NASL. Charlie was a pioneer in the game of soccer in America.\nHe spent 10 years playing in different leagues in the USA, with and against\nworld renowned players.\n\nThe transfer fee paid for Charlie Williams in the 1967 season was in the region\nof $5,000 which was paid by his American team, to Valletta FC. It was by far the\nbiggest transfer fee ever paid to any Maltese club in those days where weekly\nwages in Malta were around $20.\n\nAfter his American soccer playing days were over, Charlie retired from playing\nand decided to take up a coaching career. He did this with huge success as well,\nand in 1995 he was voted Best Coach in the State of New York.\n\nCharlie Williams was also the founder of his own Soccer Academy in the USA, a\nschool which he operated from 1993-2006.\n\nCharlie retired from soccer activities and decided to move back to his home\ncountry of Malta in 2010, where he currently resides with his wife, two kids and\ngrandchildren.\n\nCharlie Williams is a true Valletta born and raised icon in Maltese soccer, as\nwitnessed by the new issued book called âGheruq Beltinâ (âValletta Rootsâ) which\nfeatures top Valletta born individuals that made Valletta and Malta very proud.\n","linknr":133,"url":"Charlie_Williams_(soccer)","recorded":1375077005,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Charlie_Williams_(soccer)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Charlie_Williams_(soccer)&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Charlie_Williams_1963_Valletta_Malta.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bb/Charlie_Williams_1963_Valletta_Malta.jpg","/wiki/Valletta","/wiki/Malta","/wiki/Soccer","/wiki/Valletta","/wiki/Soccer","/wiki/Soccer","/wiki/Valletta_FC","/wiki/Valletta_FC","/wiki/Valletta_FC","/wiki/Valletta_FC","/wiki/Valletta","/wiki/Malta","/wiki/Soccer","/wiki/Malta_Football_Association","/wiki/Valletta_FC","/wiki/Malta","/wiki/Valletta_FC","/wiki/Norwich_fc","/wiki/Valletta_FC","/wiki/Valletta_FC","/wiki/Valletta_FC","/wiki/Dukla_Praha","/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League","/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League","/wiki/Real_Zaragoza","/wiki/Europa_League","/wiki/UEFA_Cup_Winners%27_Cup","/wiki/Malta_national_football_team","/wiki/Italy_national_football_team","/wiki/Malta_national_football_team","/wiki/Liguria","/wiki/Italy_national_football_team","/wiki/Netherlands_national_football_team","/wiki/Soccer","/wiki/Norwich_fc","/wiki/Usa","/wiki/National_Professional_Soccer_League_(1967)","/wiki/National_Professional_Soccer_League_(1967)","/wiki/North_American_Soccer_League_(1968%E2%80%931984)","/wiki/Usa","/wiki/Valletta_FC","/wiki/Malta","/wiki/Soccer","/wiki/New_york","/wiki/Soccer","/wiki/Usa","/wiki/Soccer","/wiki/Malta","/wiki/Valletta","/wiki/Valletta","/wiki/Valletta","/wiki/Malta","/w/index.php?title=Charlie_Williams_(soccer)&action=edit&section=1","http://www.nasljerseys.com/Players/W/Williams.Charles.htm","http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2006-01-31/news/the-story-of-charles-williams-a-former-valletta-fc-star-who-founded-his-own-football-school-in-new-york-86731/","http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20070111/sport/valletta-spoil-the-canaries-100-per-cent-record.30042/","http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20130110/football/City-see-off-Blues-challenge.452660/","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Charlie_Williams_(soccer)&oldid=552290320","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Living_people","/wiki/Category:1944_births","/wiki/Category:Maltese_footballers","/wiki/Category:Valletta_F.C._players","/wiki/Category:Malta_international_footballers","/wiki/Category:People_from_Valletta","/wiki/Category:Articles_which_use_infobox_templates_with_no_data_rows","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_hCards","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Charlie+Williams+%28soccer%29&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Charlie+Williams+%28soccer%29","/wiki/Charlie_Williams_(soccer)","/wiki/Talk:Charlie_Williams_(soccer)","#","/wiki/Charlie_Williams_(soccer)","/w/index.php?title=Charlie_Williams_(soccer)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Charlie_Williams_(soccer)&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Charlie_Williams_(soccer)","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Charlie_Williams_(soccer)","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Charlie_Williams_(soccer)&oldid=552290320","/w/index.php?title=Charlie_Williams_(soccer)&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Charlie_Williams_%28soccer%29&id=552290320","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Charlie+Williams+%28soccer%29","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Charlie+Williams+%28soccer%29&oldid=552290320&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Charlie_Williams_(soccer)&printable=yes","#","//en.
