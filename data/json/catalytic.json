It can also remove formaldehyde from\nthe air.]]\n\n'Catalysis' is the increase in rate of a chemical reaction due to the\nparticipation of a substance called a 'catalyst'. Unlike other reagents in the\nchemical reaction, a catalyst is not consumed. A catalyst may participate in\nmultiple chemical transformations. The effect of a catalyst may vary due to the\npresence of other substances known as inhibitors or poisons (which reduce the\ncatalytic activity) or promoters (which increase the activity).\n\nCatalyzed reactions have a lower activation energy (rate-limiting free energy of\nactivation) than the corresponding uncatalyzed reaction, resulting in a higher\nreaction rate at the same temperature. However, the mechanistic explanation of\ncatalysis is complex. Catalysts may affect the reaction environment favorably,\nor bind to the reagents to polarize bonds, e.g. acid catalysts for reactions of\ncarbonyl compounds, or form specific intermediates that are not produced\nnaturally, such as osmate esters in osmium tetroxide-catalyzed dihydroxylation\nof alkenes, or cause dissociation of reagents to reactive forms, such as\nchemisorbed hydrogen in catalytic hydrogenation.\n\nKinetically, catalytic reactions are typical chemical reactions; i.e. the\nreaction rate depends on the frequency of contact of the reactants in the rate-\ndetermining step. Usually, the catalyst participates in this slowest step, and\nrates are limited by amount of catalyst and its \"activity\". In heterogeneous\ncatalysis, the diffusion of reagents to the surface and diffusion of products\nfrom the surface can be rate determining. A nanomaterial-based catalyst is an\nexample of a heterogeneous catalyst. Analogous events associated with substrate\nbinding and product dissociation apply to homogeneous catalysts.\n\nAlthough catalysts are not consumed by the reaction itself, they may be\ninhibited, deactivated, or destroyed by secondary processes. In heterogeneous\ncatalysis, typical secondary processes include coking where the catalyst\nbecomes covered by polymeric side products. Additionally, heterogeneous\ncatalysts can dissolve into the solution in a solid–liquid system or evaporate\nin a solid–gas system.\n",
