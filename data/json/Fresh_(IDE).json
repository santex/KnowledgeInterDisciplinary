The\nprimary goal of Fresh is to make programming in assembly as fast and efficient\nas in other visual languages, without sacrificing the small application size and\nthe raw power of assembly language.\n\nBecause Fresh is the logical continuation of the FASM project in the area of\nvisual programming, it is perfectly compatible with FASM. Fresh can be used for\nWindows programming, but also to create programs for any OS that FASM supports -\nDOS, Linux, FreeBSD, BeOS, MenuetOS - the same way as is done in FASM.\n","linknr":101,"url":"Fresh_(IDE)","recorded":1362675674,"links":12,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Assembly languages","Free software programmed in assembly","Free integrated development environments"],"headings":["See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/Fresh_IDE_Screenshot.PNG/220px-Fresh_IDE_Screenshot.PNG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Integrated_development_environment","Windows","Artistic_license","Integrated_development_environment","Flat_Assembler","FASM","DOS","Linux","FreeBSD","BeOS","MenuetOS","Flat_Assembler","RadASM"]}
