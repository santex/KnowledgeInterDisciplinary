These issues\nmay have contributed to his relative historical obscurity.\n\nHe was at one time simultaneously the curator of experiments of the Royal\nSociety and a member of its council, Gresham Professor of Geometry and a\nSurveyor to the City of London after the Great Fire of London, in which capacity\nhe appears to have performed more than half of all the surveys after the fire.\nHe was also an important architect of his time, though few of his buildings now\nsurvive and some of those are generally misattributed, and was instrumental in\ndevising a set of planning controls for London whose influence remains today.\nAllan Chapman has characterised him as \"England's\nLeonardo\". [http://home.clara.net/rod.beavon/leonardo.htm England's\nLeonardo: Robert Hooke (1635â1703) and the art of experiment in Restoration\nEngland].\n\nHooke studied at Wadham College during the Protectorate where he became one of a\ntightly knit group of ardent Royalists centred around John Wilkins. Here he was\nemployed as an assistant to Thomas Willis and to Robert Boyle, for whom he built\nthe vacuum pumps used in Boyle's gas law experiments. He built some of the\nearliest Gregorian telescopes, observed the rotations of Mars and Jupiter and,\nbased on his observations of fossils, was an early proponent of biological\nevolution. He investigated the phenomenon of refraction,\ndeducing the wave theory of light, and was the first to suggest that matter\nexpands when heated and that air is made of small particles separated by\nrelatively large distances. He performed pioneering work in the field of\nsurveying and map-making and was involved in the work that led to the first\nmodern plan-form map, though his plan for London on a grid system was rejected\nin favour of rebuilding along the existing routes. He also came near to deducing\nthat gravity follows an inverse square law, and that such a relation governs the\nmotions of the planets, an idea which was subsequently developed by\nNewton. Encyclopaedia Britannica, 15th Edition, vol.6 p. 44 Much of\nHooke's scientific work was conducted in his capacity as curator of experiments\nof the Royal Society, a post he held from 1662, or as part of the household of\nRobert Boyle.\n","linknr":727,"url":"Robert_Hooke","recorded":1362505850,"links":92,"instances":["academic","mechanics","crater","historian","solid_mechanics","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Alumni of
