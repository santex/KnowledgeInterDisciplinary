Glasserton Parish in the National Library of Scotland, John\nAinslie AD1782 map. http://maps.nls.uk/counties/view/?id=685#id=685&zoom=5&lat=-\n3041&lon=13664.5&layers=BT http://freepages.history.rootsweb.ancestry-\n.com/~leighann/parishes/glasserton/glasserton2.html\n\nIt is thought that the name derives from the Saxon for âbare hillâ. It is\nlocated near Whithorn and includes the village of Monreith, the area called\nKirkmaiden and two mansions, namely Glasserton Park and Physgill, together with\nWoodfall Gardens. http://www.woodfall-gardens.co.uk/ The Statistical\nAccount remarks that the church \"stands near to Glasserton-House, and is\nromantically embosomed in wood, which sheds around it a vernerable gloom, as if\nit were a druidical temple, or the sacred grove of some Syrian\nidol.\". Statistical Account of Scotland, vol 5, page 401; republished\n1983\n\nLegend has it that Saint Ninian, otherwise called Saint Ringan, the first Bishop\nof Galloway lived for a while in a cave near Physgill by way of penitence and he\nwas the founder of Whithorn Abbey.\n\nLoch and sea fishing are available and the area is a haven for birdwatchers and\nwildlife enthusiasts. Low Knock on the outskirts of the village is an open farm\nwhere one can see the otters, ornamental ducks, and cattle. http://www.scottish-\nplaces.info/parishes/parmap1082.html\n\n'Kirkmaiden-in-Farines' otherwise Kirkmaiden Church, now a ruin, stood at Lag\nPoint in the Glasserton side of Monreith Bay south. In 1761 Rev. James Laing\nwas Minister of Glasserton and Kirkmaiden-in-Farines. Fasti Ecclesiae\nScoticanae. new edit. vol.II. http://archive.org/stream/fastiecclesiu02scotuof-\nt#page/n369/mode/2up http://www.flickr.com/photos/7382107@N04/127699-\n4318/\n\nNear the church is the bronze otter, sculpted by Penny Wheatley, standing as a\nmemorial to Gavin Maxwell, the author of the famous book \"Ring of Bright Water\",\nwhich was made into a successful film. Gavin Maxwell was often seen exercising\nhis tame otter, about which he wrote his book, on the beach below Kirkmaiden\nchurch. There is a signposted walk from the southern end of the village at\nClarksburn giving a magnificent view of Monreith Bay to Gavin Maxwell's otter.\nFrom the \"otter site\" you can view St. Medan's Golf Course, a 9-hole undulating\ncourse very popular with visitors.\n\n'Monreith' was called \"Milltown of Monreith\" so named by the watermills driven\nby the waterpower of Monreith Burn. Kirkmaiden church, was one of the oldest\nchurches in Scotland and the resting place of many of the McCulloch and Maxwell\nfamily members who owned the Monreith estate. Legend has it that when this\nparish was united with Glasserton, the pulpit and bell were removed from\nKirkmaiden church and were to be transported by sea across Luce Bay to a church\nof the same name in Kirkmaiden Parish in Rhins, Wigtownshire. A strange storm\nblew up and the boat foundered, sinking the pulpit and bell. The story goes that\non the approaching death of any descendant of the McCullochs of Myrton, the wraith-\nbell rang from the depths of Luce Bay. The church is opposite the car park of\nSt. Medans Golf Club.\n\nIn the 1870s Monreith Estate covered about 16000 acres and was partly in\nGlasserton and partly in Mochrum area. Monreith House, still owned by the\nMaxwell family, is surrounded by beautiful woodlands, and looks towards the\nWhite Loch of Myrton in Mochrum area. The original home of the Maxwells was the\ntower house known as the \"Dowies\" behind the Fell of Barhullion, the highest\npoint overlooking Monreith Village. When the Fell was owned by the Maxwell\nfamily, a member of the family boasted that he owned a Fell from which five\nkingdoms could be seen on a clear day, the kingdoms of Scotland, England,\nIreland, Mann, and finally, the Kingdom of Heaven.\n\nThe 'Dowies, or Old Place of Monreith' now owned by the Landmark Trust, has been\nbeautifully renovated. http://www.landmarktrust.org.uk/BuildingDetails/Over-\nview/221/Old_Place_of_Monreith http://www.stravaiging.com/history/cas-\ntle/dowies http://www.flickr.com/photos/boffinpc/4131237512/ It\nmay also have been known as 'Moure Castle' or Mowir or Mowr Castle http://www.streetmap.co.uk/map.srf?x=238159&y=543329&z=115&sv=54.7587560,-\n4.5166448&st=7&mapp=map.srf\n\nMonreith boasts sandy beaches, quite rare on this section of the Galloway\ncoastline, with safe swimming areas, rock pools and some interesting caves, one\nof which is streaked red and known as the \"Butcher's Cave\". The remains of a man-\nmade flounder pool can be found at the extreme end of the Black Rocks sands and\nwas built to catch flounders as the tide receded; at Ben Buoy, which is a sheer\nrock face, an interesting cave allows a very careful person to cross through the\ncliff and emerge in a small bay between Knock Farm and Cairndoon farm.\n\n'Ravenstone' On 16 December 1617 Joanni Kennedie junior de Blairquhan and his\nwife Marie Stewart had \"baroniam de Remistoun\" & fortalicio and lands of\nLochtoun alias Remistoun. This was also known as Ravenstone, Ravinstone and\nRemeston.

Stewart Esq. is shown on Ainslie's 1782 map\nas being in the north-west Glasserton area.\n\n'Woodfall' (Glasserton) house, park and gardens Glasserton Parish in the\nNational Library of Scotland, John Ainslie AD1782 map.\nhttp://maps.nls.uk/counties/view/?id=685 were built on the large estate on\nthe orders of the Honorable Admiral Keith Stewart, the second surviving son of\nAlexander Stewart, 6th Earl of Galloway who was given the \"Barony of Glasserton\"\nin 1767. The Statistical Account gives in 1795 a detailed description of his\nagricultural improvements, based on continued raising of the traditional black\ncattle. Statistical Account of Scotland , vol 5, pages 398-400; republished\n1983 He died in 1795, and was succeeded by his son, Rt Hon James Alexander\nStewart-Mackenzie, but the house was let and the contents were sold. He sold the\nhouse and grounds in 1819 to Stair Hathorn-Stewart at the neighbouring Physgill\nestate. That which is now called \"Woodfall Gardens\" was a part of the Glasserton\nand Physgill estate which was sold some thirty years ago and are now on show to\nthe public. c.1745 Military Map showing Physgill http://maps.nls.uk/geo/roy/#zoom=14&lat=54.70126&lon=-\n4.4054&layers=0B000000TTT\n\nOn the 1782 map Robert Stewart Esq. was at 'Physgill' near Kidsdale, just south\nof Adm.
