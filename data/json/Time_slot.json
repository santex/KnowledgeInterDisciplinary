{"cursor":"12267","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Time-division multiplexing' ('TDM') is a type of digital (or rarely analog)\nmultiplexing in which two or more bit streams or signals are transferred\nappearing simultaneously as sub-channels in one communication channel, but are\nphysically taking turns on the channel. The time domain is divided into several\nrecurrent time slots of fixed length, one for each sub-channel. A sample byte or\ndata block of sub-channel 1 is transmitted during time slot 1, sub-channel 2\nduring time slot 2, etc. One TDM frame consists of one time slot per sub-channel\nplus a synchronization channel and sometimes error correction channel before the\nsynchronization. After the last sub-channel, error correction, and\nsynchronization, the cycle starts all over again with a new frame, starting with\nthe second sample, byte or data block from sub-channel 1, etc.\n","linknr":665,"url":"Time_slot","recorded":1362676821,"links":35,"instances":["networking","file_format"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Multiplexing","Synchronization"],"headings":["Application examples","TDM versus packet-mode communication","History","Synchronous time-division multiplexing (sync TDM)","Synchronous digital hierarchy (SDH)","Statistical time-division multiplexing (stat TDM)","See also","Notes","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/62/PD-icon.svg/12px-PD-icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4e/Telecom-icon.svg/100px-Telecom-icon.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["frame","networking"],["riff","file_format"]],"members":["frame","riff"],"related":["Digital","Pulse-amplitude_modulation","Multiplexing","Bit_stream","Frame_(networking)","Plesiochronous_digital_hierarchy","PCM","T-carrier","E-carrier","Synchronous_optical_networking","Basic_Rate_Interface","Primary_Rate_Interface","Integrated_Services_Digital_Network","RIFF_(File_format)","Stereoscopic","Time_division_multiple_access","Frequency_division_multiplex","Global_system_for_mobile_communications","Link_16","Link_22","Circuit_mode","Statistical_multiplexing","Packet_mode","Dynamic_TDMA","Scheduling_algorithm","HIPERLAN/2","Dynamic_synchronous_Transfer_Mode","IEEE_802.16a","Telegraphy","Ã‰mile_Baudot","David_E._Hughes","SIGSALY","Telephone_exchange","Public_switched_telephone_network","DS0","Ethernet","OSI_reference_model","Wavelength_Division_Multiplexing","Frequency-division_multiplexing","McASP","Time-division_duplex","Time_division_multiple_access"]}
