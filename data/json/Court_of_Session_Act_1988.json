The description\n reads: \"The first Session was begun by Gavin Dunbar, Archbishop of Glasgow;\n Alexander Myln, Abbot of Cambuskenneth, Lord President; Master Richard\n Bothuile, Rector of Ashkirk; Sir John Dingwell, Provost of the Church of the\n Holy Trinity, near Edinburgh; Master Henry Quhyte, Rector of the Church of\n Finhaven; Master William Gibson, Dean of the Collegiate Church of Restlerig;\n Master Thomas Hay, Dean of the Collegiate Church of Dunbar, all elected by our\n Sovereign Lord the King.\"]]\n\nThe 'Court of Session' (; ) is the supreme civil court of Scotland,\nand constitutes part of the College of Justice. It sits in Parliament House in\nEdinburgh and is both a trial court and a court of appeal. The Court of Session has jurisdiction with the Sheriff\nCourtâthe other Scottish civil court, which sits locallyâand the pursuer is\ngiven first choice of what court to use. However, the majority of complex,\nimportant, or high value cases are brought in the Court of Session.\nLegal aid, administered by the Scottish Legal Aid Board, is available to persons\nwith little disposable income for cases in the Court of Session.\n\nThe court is a unitary collegiate court, with all judges other than the Lord\nPresident and the Lord Justice Clerk holding the same rank and titleâ[[Senator\nof the College of Justice]] and also Lord or Lady of Council and Session. There are thirty-four judges, in\naddition to a number of temporary judges; these temporary judges are typically\nsheriffs, or advocates in private practice. The judges sit also in the High\nCourt of Justiciary, where the Lord President is called the Lord Justice\nGeneral.\n\nThe court was divided in 1810 into an outer and inner house. The\nformer serves as the court of first instance; the latter is superior, and stands\nas an appeal court for civil cases as well as a court of first instance. Cases\nin the outer house are heard by Lords Ordinary who sit alone, though there may\noccasionally also be a jury of twelve. Cases in the inner house are heard by\nthree Lords of Council and Session, but significant or complicated cases may be\nheard by five or more judges.\n","linknr":501,"url":"Court_of_Session_Act_1988","recorded":1375084758,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Court_of_Session&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Court_of_Session&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","/wiki/Court_of_Session","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","/w/index.php?title=Court_of_Session_Act_1988&redirect=no","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Court_of_Session_(disambiguation)","/wiki/Moderators_and_clerks_in_the_Church_of_Scotland","/wiki/Principal_Clerk_of_Session_and_Justiciary","/wiki/File:Court_of_Session_logo.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/d4/Court_of_Session_logo.svg/175px-Court_of_Session_logo.svg.png","/wiki/Scotland","/wiki/Parliament_House,_Edinburgh","/wiki/Edinburgh","/wiki/Monarch_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/First_Minister_of_Scotland","/wiki/Judicial_Appointments_Board_for_Scotland","#cite_note-JOS-1","/wiki/James_V_of_Scotland","/wiki/Appeal","/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_Kingdom","#cite_note-Supreme-2","/wiki/Ad_vitam_aut_culpam","http://www.scotcourts.gov.uk","/wiki/Lord_President_of_the_Court_of_Session","/wiki/Brian_Gill,_Lord_Gill","/wiki/Lord_Justice_Clerk","/wiki/Colin_Sutherland,_Lord_Carloway","/wiki/File:Law_Courts_entrance,_Parliament_Square.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/Law_Courts_entrance%2C_Parliament_Square.JPG/220px-Law_Courts_entrance%2C_Parliament_Square.JPG","/wiki/File:Law_Courts_entrance,_Parliament_Square.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/File:Court.of.Session.1532.James.V.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/36/Court.of.Session.1532.James.V.JPG/220px-Court.of.Session.1532.James.V.JPG","/wiki/File:Court.of.Session.1532.James.V.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/James_V","/wiki/Gavin_Dunbar_(archbishop_of_Glasgow)","/wiki/Scottish_Gaelic_language","/wiki/Scots_language","/wiki/Supreme_court","/wiki/Civil_law_(common_law)","/wiki/Courts_of_Scotland","/wiki/Scotland","#cite_note-3","/wiki/College_of_Justice","/wiki/Parliament_House,_Edinburgh","/wiki/Edinburgh","/wiki/Trial_court","/wiki/Appeal","#cite_note-Session_Introduction-4","//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/coextensive","/wiki/Courts_of_Scotland","/wiki/Sheriff_Court","/wiki/Pursuer","#cite_note-5","/wiki/Legal_aid","/wiki/Scottish_Legal_Aid_Board","#cite_note-6","/wiki/Lord_President_of_the_Court_of_Session","/wiki/Lord_Justice_Clerk","/wiki/Senator_of_the_College_of_Justice","#cite_note-Session_Introduction-4","#cite_note-7","/wiki/Sheriff_Court","/wiki/Advocate","/wiki/High_Court_of_Justiciary","/wiki/Lord_Justice_General","#cite_note-Head-8","#cite_note-9","/wiki/Court_of_Session_Act_1810","/wiki/Outer_House","/wiki/Inner_House","#cite_note-10","/wiki/Lords_Ordinary","#History","#Structure","#Outer_House","#Inner_House","#Function","#See_also","#References","#Further_reading","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Court_of_Session&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Privy_Council_of_Scotland","#cite_note-11","#cite_note-12","/wiki/Papal_bull","/wiki/James_V_of_Scotland","/wiki/Parlement_of_Paris","/wiki/Lord_Chancellor_of_Scotland","#cite_note-13","/wiki/Laity","#cite_note-Shand-14","/wiki/Act_of_Parliament","#cite_note-15","/wiki/Treaty_of_Union","#cite_note-16","/wiki/Acts_of_Union_1707","/wiki/Outer_House","/wiki/Inner_House","/wiki/Court_of_Session_Act_1810","#cite_note-17","#cite_note-18","/wiki/Admiralty_Court","/wiki/Commissary_Court","#cite_note-Shand-14","/w/index.php?title=Court_of_Session&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Lord_Ordinary","/wiki/Act_of_Sederunt","#cite_note-Rule_Making-19","#cite_note-Section_5_Session_1988-20","/wiki/Scottish_Court_Service","/wiki/Scots_civil_procedure","#cite_note-21","/wiki/Faculty_of_Advocates","/wiki/Advocate","/wiki/Counsel","/wiki/Solicitors","/wiki/Solicitor-advocate","/w/index.php?title=Court_of_Session&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/Outer_House","/wiki/Lord_Ordinary","/wiki/High_Court","#cite_note-22","/wiki/Jury","#cite_note-Session_Introduction-4","/wiki/Subject-matter_jurisdiction","/wiki/Sheriff_court","#cite_note-23","#cite_note-24","#cite_note-25","/w/index.php?title=Court_of_Session&action=edit&section=4","/wiki/Inner_House","/wiki/Appeal","/wiki/Trial_court","#cite_not
