Started by the husband and wife team,\nJiae Kim and John H. Lee, in 2005, it was initially published four times a year.\nIn 2008, Theme magazine started publishing bimonthly. In 2009 they returned to a\nquarterly schedule.\n\nIn 2006 Theme won many design awards, including the Society of Publication\nDesigners annual competition, and Print's Regional Design Competition. It has\nbeen featured in Adobe's advertising for its CS2 line of products.\n\nTheme publishers operate a creative agency, called EMEHT.
