Its abundance is due to the Triple-alpha process by which it\nis created in stars.\n\nCarbon-12 is of particular importance as it is used as the standard from which\natomic masses of all nuclides are measured: its mass number is 12 by definition.\n","linknr":191,"url":"Carbon-12","recorded":1362375473,"links":33,"instances":["unit"],"pdf":["http://www.nscl.msu.edu/~jina/jinaastroclub/papers/Neff.pdf","http://www.nscl.msu.edu/~jina/jinaastroclub/papers/Neff.pdf","http://physics.aps.org/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevLett.106.192501.pdf","http://physics.aps.org/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevLett.106.192501.pdf"],"categories":["Isotopes of carbon"],"headings":["History","Hoyle state","Isotopic purification","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/80/Isotopes_and_half-life.svg/30px-Isotopes_and_half-life.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["mole","unit"],["mole","unit"]],"members":["mole"],"related":["Stable_isotope","Isotope","Carbon","Protons","Neutrons","Electrons","Triple-alpha_process","Atomic_mass","Nuclides","IUPAP","IUPAC","Oxygen","Mole_(unit)","Oxygen-16","CIPM","CGPM","Ground_state","Fred_Hoyle","Triple-alpha_process","Carbon_dioxide","Avogadro_constant","Carbon-11","Carbon-13","Carbon-14","Isotopes_of_carbon","Isotopically_pure_diamond","Mole_(unit)","Carbon-11","Carbon-13","Boron-12","Nitrogen-12"]}
