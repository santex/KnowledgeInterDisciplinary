{"cursor":"36042","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"{| style=\"float:right; background:none;\"\n|-\n|\n|-\n|\n|}\n, China]] 'Criminology' (from Latin , \"accusation\"; and Greek , [[-logy|-\nlogia]]) is the scientific study of the nature, extent, causes, and control\nof criminal behavior in both the individual and in society. Criminology is an\ninterdisciplinary field in the behavioral sciences, drawing especially upon\nthe research of sociologists (particularly in the sociology of deviance),\npsychologists and psychiatrists, social anthropologists as well as on\nwritings in law.\n\nAreas of research in criminology include the incidence, forms, causes and\nconsequences of crime, as well as social and governmental regulations and\nreaction to crime. For studying the distribution and causes of crime,\ncriminology mainly relies upon quantitative methods. The term criminology was\ncoined in 1885 by Italian law professor Raffaele Garofalo as criminologia.\nLater, French anthropologist Paul Topinard used the analogous French term\ncriminologie.\n","linknr":735,"url":"Criminology","recorded":1362669682,"links":80,"instances":["academic","social","sociologist","sociology","polity","sociology","sociology","criminology","sociology","criminologist","sociology","professor","psychology"],"pdf":["http://www.uwec.edu/patchinj/crmj301/theorysummaries.pdf","http://www.uwec.edu/patchinj/crmj301/theorysummaries.pdf","http://rds.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/prgpdfs/crrs08.pdf"],"categories":["Criminology|*","Branches
