According to Einstein's Theory of Relativity, simultaneity\nis not an absolute property between events; what is simultaneous in one frame of\nreference will not necessarily be simultaneous in another. For inertial frames\nmoving at speeds small compared to the speed of light with respect to one\nanother this effect is small and can for practical matters be ignored such that\nsimultaneity can be treated as an absolute property.\n\nThe word derives from the Latin simul, at the same time (see sem-1 in Indo-\nEuropean Roots) plus the suffix -taneous, abstracted from spontaneous<ref></ref>\n(which in turn comes directly from Latin<ref></ref>).\n\nThe noun simult means a supernatural coincidence, two or more divinely inspired\nevents that occur at or near the same period of time that are related to each\nother in both noticeable and unnoticeable characteristics.\n\n* In econometrics, it arises when one or more of the explanatory variables is\n  jointly determined with the dependent variable, typically through an\n  equilibrium mechanism.\n* In criminal law, for a criminal violation to be established, it usually must\n  be shown that there was simultaneity of actus reus and mens rea.\n* In mathematics, a system of equations or a set of simultaneous equations share\n  variables; a solution is a set of variable values for which all these\n  equations are satisfied together.\n* In music, see Simultaneity (music).\n* In physics, see Relativity of simultaneity.\n* In marketing, simultaneity is one of the characteristics of a service which\n  differentiates it from a product. It refers to the idea that the production\n  and consumption of a service occur simultaneously, making it impossible to\n  produce and store a service prior to consumption.\n","title":"Simultaneity","headings":["See also","References"]},"micro-relation":["1: Properties","1: Spacetime#Basic_concepts","1: Time","1: Frame_of_reference","1: Latin","1: Coincidence","1: Hierophany","1: Pre-established_harmony","1: Econometrics","1: Explanatory_variables","1: Dependent_variable","1: Economic_equilibrium","1: Criminal_law","1: Concurrence","1: Actus_reus","1: Mens_rea","1: Mathematics","1: Simultaneous_equations","1: Music","1: Relativity_of_simultaneity","1: Marketing","1: Synchronicity","1: Non-simultaneity"]}
