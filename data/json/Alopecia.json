Alopecia can mean baldness, a term generally reserved for pattern\nalopecia or androgenic alopecia. Compulsive pulling of hair (trichotillomania)\ncan also induce hair loss. Hairstyling routines such as tight ponytails or\nbraids may cause traction alopecia. Both hair relaxer solutions, and hot hair\nirons can also induce hair loss. In some cases, alopecia is due to underlying\nmedical conditions, such as iron deficiency.\n\nGenerally, hair loss in patches signifies alopecia areata. Alopecia areata\ntypically presents with sudden hair loss causing patches to appear on the scalp\nor other areas of the body. If left untreated, or if the disease does not\nrespond to treatment, complete baldness can result in the affected area, which\nis referred to as alopecia totalis. When the entire body suffers from complete\nhair loss, it is referred to as alopecia universalis. It is similar to the\neffects that occur with chemotherapy.\n","linknr":674,"url":"Alopecia","recorded":1362503060,"links":37,"instances":["medicine"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Radiation health effects","Conditions of the skin appendages","External signs of aging"],"headings":["Signs and symptoms","Causes","Pathophysiology","Diagnosis","Treatment","Research","See also","Footnotes","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/Merge-arrows.svg/50px-Merge-arrows.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/Alopecia.jpg/230px-Alopecia.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["iron_deficiency","medicine"]],"members":["iron_deficiency"],"related":["Classical_Greek","Hair","Baldness","Androgenic_alopecia","Trichotillomania","Ponytails","Braids","Traction_alopecia","Hair_relaxer","Iron_deficiency_(medicine)","Alopecia_areata","Alopecia_totalis","Alopecia_universalis","Chemotherapy","Frontal_lobe","Parietal_lobe","Alopecia_mucinosa","Androgenic_alopecia","Chronic_inflammation","Diabetes","Tinea_capitis","Hyperthyroidism","Hypothyroidism","Hypervitaminosis_A","Iron_deficiency","Malnutrition","Lupus_erythematosus","Chemotherapy","Anabolic_steroids","Birth_control_pill","Pseudopelade_of_Brocq","Radiation_therapy","Syphilis","Telogen_effluvium","Traction_alopecia","Trichotillomania","Tufted_folliculitis","Hair_follicle","Anagen_phase","Anagen_phase","Anagen_phase","Telogen_effluvium","Anagen_effluvium","Minoxidil","Allergic_contact_dermatitis","Finasteride","Libido","Erectile_dysfunction","Gynecomastia","Myopathy","Egg_oil","Unani","Traditional_medicine","Corticosteroid","Dithranol","Psoriasis","Oral_contraceptive_pill","Spironolactone","Flutamide","Hyperandrogenism","Hair_transplantation","Gene","Alopecia_in_animals","Androgenic_alopecia","Baldness","Lichen_planopilaris","Management_of_baldness"]}
