He was the mayor of Strasbourg between\n1929 and 1935, and a member of the French National Assembly twice. [http://www.assemblee-\nnationale.fr/sycomore/fiche.asp?num_dept=3888 Charles, Louis HUEBER (1883 -\n1943)]\n\nHueber became involved in political struggles at a young age. In 1900 he founded\nthe Alsatian section of the Metal Workers Trade Union. In 1910 he became the\nsecretary of the Social Democratic Party branch in Alsace-Lorraine. He fought in\nthe German Army during World War I, and became a sergeant. During the\nrevolutionary upsurge of 1918, Hueber acted as the chairman of the Strasbourg\nSoldiers Council Goodfellow, Samuel.\n[http://www.jstor.org/stable/260909 From Communism to Nazism: The Transformation\nof Alsatian Communists], in Journal of Contemporary History, Vol. 27, No. 2\n(Apr., 1992), pp. 231-258\n\nAt the end of the war, Hueber argued in favour of the creation of an\nindependent, neutral Alsatian state.\n\nDuring the December 1920 Congress of Tours, Hueber and a several other Alsatian\ndelegates supported the call to form a French Communist Party. A month later, he\nfounded the communist newspaper [[Die Neue Welt]]. Hueber became the most\nprominent figure of the Communist Party in Alsace. He later became the editor of\nthe Alsatian edition of [[l'HumanitÃ©]].\n\nIn 1923 Hueber took part in an international communist meeting in Essen,\norganized to protest the French occupation of the Ruhr. He was arrested by\nFrench authorities for his participation in the event, a fact that elevated his\nstanding within the Communist Party. He was imprisoned at La\nSantÃ© Prison. Wohl, Robert. [http://books.google.com/books?id=fZ6aAAAAIAAJ\nFrench Communism in the Making, 1914-1924]. Stanford, Calif: Stanford University\nPress, 1966. p. 320 The fame he achieved from being arrested helped him to\nget elected to the French National Assembly the following year.\nHueber was elected from the 1st constituency of Bas-Rhin.\n\nHueber was elected mayor of Strasbourg in 1929 by the [[Volksfront\n(Alsace)|Volksfront]] (a coalition of communists and clerical autonomists).\nHueber claimed that the electoral pact was a coalition of anti-imperialist\nforces. He was expelled from the Communist Party in the autumn of 1929. He\nbecame one of the main leaders of the Opposition Communist Party of Alsace-\nLorraine (KPO).\n\nDuring the period of 1933 and 1936 Hueber and his followers gradually moved\ntowards pro-Nazi positions. However, he publicly denied to being\nantisemitic. In 1935 the Volksfront fell apart as the\nRepublican People's Union (UPR) deserted it. Hueber lost his seat as Mayor to\nCharles Frey as the coalition that had backed him disappeared. Fischer, Christopher J.

New York: Berghahn Books, 2010. p. 199\n\nHe was re-elected to the National Assembly in 1936.\n\nDuring both of Hueber's National Assembly tenures, he formed part of the\ncommittee on Alsace-Lorraine. Hueber frequently addressed the Assembly in\nAlsatian language. On December 8, 1927 Hueber held a speech in\nAlsatian in the National Assembly, the content of which were so shocking for the\nAssembly that large chunks were stricken from the official protocol. Hueber had\nattacked the status of the French language in Alsace-Lorraine, stating that\nFrance was oppressing the Alsatian working class and that Alsace was under\nFrench colonial rule.

Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press,\n2008. p. 146\n\nHueber escaped arrest in the 1939 crackdown on Alsatian autonomist leaders, due\nto his deteriorating health. Hueber did not take part in the\n1940 Congress of Vichy vote.\n\nIn 1941, Hueber became a functionary of the NSDAP.
