{"cursor":"13675","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n'Tillage' is the agricultural preparation of the soil by mechanical of various\ntypes, such as digging, stirring, and overturning. Examples of human-powered\n'tilling' methods using hand tools include shovelling, picking, mattock work,\nhoeing, and raking. Examples of draft-animal-powered or mechanized work include\nploughing (overturning with moldboards or chiseling with chisel shanks),\nrototilling, rolling with cultipackers or other rollers, harrowing, and\ncultivating with cultivator shanks (teeth). Small-scale gardening and farming,\nfor household food production or small business production, tends to use the smaller-\nscale methods above, whereas medium- to large-scale farming tends to use the larger-\nscale methods. There is a fluid continuum, however. Any type of gardening or\nfarming, but especially larger-scale commercial types, may also use low-till or\nno-till methods as well.\n\nTillage is often classified into two types, primary and secondary. There is no\nstrict boundary between them so much as a loose distinction between tillage that\nis deeper and more thorough (primary) and tillage that is shallower and\nsometimes more selective of location (secondary). Primary tillage such as\nploughing tends to produce a rough surface finish, whereas secondary tillage\ntends to produce a smoother surface finish, such as that required to make a good\nseedbed for many crops. Harrowing and rototilling often combine primary and\nsecondary tillage into one operation.\n\n\"Tillage\" can also mean the land that is 'tilled'. The word \"'cultivation'\" has\nseveral senses that overlap substantially with those of \"tillage\". In a general\ncontext, both can refer to agriculture generally. Within agriculture, both can\nrefer to any of the kinds of soil agitation described above. Additionally,\n\"cultivation\" or \"cultivating\" may refer to an even narrower sense of shallow,\nselective secondary tillage of row crop fields that kills weeds while sparing\nthe crop plants.\n","linknr":258,"url":"Tillage","recorded":1362672978,"links":44,"instances":["agricultural_tool","tool","soil_and_water_environmental_enhancement_program","tillage_erosion","breed","tool","tool"],"pdf":["http://cropsoil.psu.edu/extension/ct/uc125.pdf","http://cropsoil.psu.edu/extension/ct/uc125.pdf","http://www.tbars.net/alternativetil.pdf"],"categories":["Agricultural soil science","Agricultural terminology"],"headings":["Tillage systems","Definitions","History of tilling","Alternatives to tilling","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/Mergefrom.svg/50px-Mergefrom.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/04/Fendt_Tractor_Ripping_up_Kulin.jpg/275px-Fendt_Tractor_Ripping_up_Kulin.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["hoe","tool"],["rake","tool"],["roller","agricultural_tool"],["harrow","tool"],["harrow","tool"],["harrow","tool"],["hoe","tool"],["roller","agricultural_tool"],["clydesdale","breed"],["sweep","soil_and_water_environmental_enhancement_program"],["teron","tillage_erosion"]],"members":["roller","harrow","sweep","teron","clydesdale","rake","hoe"],"related":["Agriculture","Soil","Manual_labour","Hand_tool","Shovel","Pickaxe","Mattock","Hoe_(tool)","Rake_(tool)","Working_animal","Mechanization","Plough","Rotary_tiller","Cultipacker","Roller_(agricultural_tool)","Harrow_(tool)","Cultivator","Small_business","No-till_farming","Seedbed","Row_crop","Crop_residue","Plough","Harrow_(tool)","No-till","Strip-Till","Mulch-till","Zone_tillage","Aerates","Nutrients","Carbon","Nitrogen","No-till_farming","Eutrophication","Crop_residue","Soybean_management_practices","Fertilizer","Herbicide","Harrow_(tool)","Dibber","Hoe_(tool)","Shovel","Rotary_tiller","Subsoiler","Roller_(agricultural_tool)","Cultivator","Photosynthesis","Slavery","Plow","Mule","Ox","Elephant","Domestic_buffalo","Clydesdale_(breed)","Steel","American_Midwest","Prairie","Farm_tractor","Agriculture","Agricultural_science","Herbicide","No-till_farming","Soil_erosion","Diesel_fuel","Polyculture","No-dig_gardening","Advance_sowing","Optimum_water_content_for_tillage","SWEEP_(Soil_and_Water_Environmental_Enhancement_program)","TERON_(Tillage_erosion)"]}
