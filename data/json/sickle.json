While both can (albeit\nwith a different technique) be used for cutting either green grass or mature\ncereals, it is the serrated sickle that still dominates the duty of harvesting\ngrain - with other words the \"reaping\". Modern kitchen knives with serrated\nedges, as well as grain-harvesting machines use the same design principle as\nprehistoric sickles.\n","linknr":670,"url":"sickle","recorded":1362580875,"links":89,"instances":["weapon"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Blade weapons","Cutting tools","Farming tools"],"headings":["History","Serrated or \"toothed\" sickles","How a sickle is used","Other uses","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/Hasiya_krish.jpg/220px-Hasiya_krish.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/Sickle33.jpg/220px-Sickle33.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/1255_-_Keramikos_Museum%2C_Athens_-_Iron_tool_-_Photo_by_Giovanni_Dall%27Orto%2C_Nov_12_2009.jpg/220px-1255_-_Keramikos_Museum%2C_Athens_-_Iron_tool_-_Photo_by_Giovanni_Dall%27Orto%2C_Nov_12_2009.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0a/Museum_Quintana_-_Neolithische_Sichel.jpg/250px-Museum_Quintana_-_Neolithische_Sichel.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/ClaySumerianSickle.jpg/250px-ClaySumerianSickle.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["kama","weapon"]],"members":["kama"],"related":["Panchkhal","Nepal","Cutting","Agricultural","Tool","Blade","Grain","Succulent_plants","Forage","Livestock","Hay","Trip_hammer","Kerameikos","Epipaleolithic","Bronze_Age","Ancient_Near_East","Bronze_Age_Europe","Hoard","Urnfield_culture","Frankleben_hoard","Bladed_weapon","Kusarigama","Kama_(weapon)","Chicken_sickles","Makraka","Zande_people","Paulus_Hector_Mair","German_Renaissance","Combat_manual","Hammer_and_sickle","Communism","Revolutionary_Socialism","Grim_Reaper","Scythe","Units_of_measurement","Money_in_Harry_Potter","NATO_reporting_name","RT-2PM_Topol","Intercontinental_ballistic_missile","Tacitus","Druid","Paulus_Hector_Mair","The_Hunger_Games","Walter_Hungerford,_1st_Baron_Hungerford","Hungerford_knot"]}
