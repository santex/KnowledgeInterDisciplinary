However,\nthis is only a fundamental psychological definition of a stereotype. Within and across different psychology disciplines,\nthere are different concepts and theories of stereotyping that provide their own\nexpanded definition.

others.\n","linknr":1269,"url":"Stereotypes","recorded":1362891051,"links":98,"instances":["psychology","psychology","psychologist","statistics","communication","neuroscience","statistics","psychology","memory"],"pdf":["http://catdir.loc.gov/catdir/samples/cam033/2002073438.pdf","http://catdir.loc.gov/catdir/samples/cam033/2002073438.pdf","http://www.archpsychological.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/deprejudice-txng-dep-n-prejudice-w-tx-for-other.pdf","http://www.archpsychological.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/deprejudice-txng-dep-n-prejudice-w-tx-for-other.pdf","http://www.cos.gatech.edu/facultyres/Diversity_Studies/Fiske_StereotypeContent.pdf","http://www.cos.gatech.edu/facultyres/Diversity_Studies/Fiske_StereotypeContent.pdf","http://www.people.hbs.edu/acuddy/2009,%20cuddy%20et%20al.,%20BJSP.pdf","http://www.people.hbs.edu/acuddy/2009,%20cuddy%20et%20al.,%20BJSP.pdf","http://allenmcconnell.net/pdfs/edbe-JPSP-1994.pdf","http://allenmcconnell.net/pdfs/edbe-JPSP-1994.pdf","http://faculty.washington.edu/donnaw/Devine%201989.pdf","http://faculty.washington.edu/donnaw/Devine%201989.pdf","http://www.atkinson.yorku.ca/~jsteele/PDF/Optional%20Readings/Lepore_Brown_JPSP_1997.pdf","http://www.atkinson.yorku.ca/~jsteele/PDF/Optional%20Readings/Lepore_Brown_JPSP_1997.pdf","http://users.nber.org/~sewp/events/2005.01.14/Bios+Links/Good-rec2-Steele_&_Aronson_95.pdf","http://users.nber.org/~sewp/events/2005.01.14/Bios+Links/Good-rec2-Steele_&_Aronson_95.pdf","http://clarksvillechessclub.org/pdf%20files/The%20role%20of%20gender%20stereotypes%20in%20chess.pdf","http://clarksvillechessclub.org/pdf%20files/The%20role%20of%20gender%20stereotypes%20in%20chess.pdf","http://jefferson.library.millersville.edu/reserve/COMM301_Paul_SocialPerception.pdf","http://jefferson.library.millersville.edu/reserve/COMM301_Paul_SocialPerception.pdf","https://wesfiles.wesleyan.edu/courses/PSYC-309-clwilkins/Week3/Rudman.Glick.2001.pdf","https://wesfiles.wesleyan.edu/courses/PSYC-309-clwilkins/Week3/Rudman.Glick.2001.pdf","http://www.chaire-crsng-inal.fsg.ulaval.ca/fileadmin/docs/documents/Article/Gender_and_career_choice_process_2001.pdf","http://www.chaire-crsng-inal.fsg.ulaval.ca/fileadmin/docs/documents/Article/Gender_and_career_choice_process_2001.pdf","http://people.uncw.edu/maumem/soc500/Correll2004.pdf","http://people.uncw.edu/maumem/soc500/Correll2004.pdf"],"categories":["Stereotypes","Stock
