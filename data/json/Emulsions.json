{"cursor":"17907","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" (purple outline around particles) positions itself on the interfaces between\n Phase II and Phase I, stabilizing the emulsion]]\n\nAn 'emulsion' is a mixture of two or more liquids that are normally immiscible\n(nonmixable or unblendable). Emulsions are part of a more general class of two-\nphase systems of matter called colloids. Although the terms colloid and\nemulsion are sometimes used interchangeably, emulsion should be used when both\nthe dispersed and the continuous phase are liquids. In an emulsion, one liquid\n(the dispersed phase) is dispersed in the other (the continuous phase).\nExamples of emulsions include vinaigrettes, milk, mayonnaise, and some cutting\nfluids for metal working. The photo-sensitive side of photographic film is an\nexample of a colloid.\n\nThe word \"emulsion\" comes from the Latin word for \"to milk\", as milk is (among\nother things) an emulsion of milk fat and water.\n\nTwo liquids can form different types of emulsions. As an example, oil and water\ncan form, firstly, an oil-in-water emulsion, where the oil is the dispersed\nphase, and water is the dispersion medium. Secondly, they can form a water-in-\noil emulsion, where water is the dispersed phase and oil is the external phase.\nMultiple emulsions are also possible, including a \"water-in-oil-in-water\"\nemulsion and an \"oil-in-water-in-oil\" emulsion.\n\nEmulsions, being liquids, do not exhibit a static internal structure. The\ndroplets dispersed in the liquid matrix (called the âdispersion mediumâ) are\nusually assumed to be statistically distributed.\n","linknr":515,"url":"Emulsions","recorded":1362506260,"links":64,"instances":["physics","food","chemistry","rheology","chemistry","pharmaceutical","medicine","matter","laxative","chemistry","distilled_beverage"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Colloidal chemistry","Chemical mixtures","Condensed matter physics","Soft matter","Drug delivery devices","Dosage forms"],"headings":["Appearance and properties","Emulsifiers","Mechanisms of emulsification","Uses","See also","External links","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/Emulsions.svg/180px-Emulsions.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6d/Propofol.jpg/220px-Propofol.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/FlattenedRoundPills.jpg/58px-FlattenedRoundPills.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/Hexaaquatitanium%28III%29-solution.jpg/58px-Hexaaquatitanium%28III%29-solution.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/Inhaler.jpg/58px-Inhaler.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/Glycerin_suppositories.jpg/58px-Glycerin_suppositories.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/SPF15SunBlock.JPG/58px-SPF15SunBlock.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/Injection_Syringe_01.jpg/58px-Injection_Syringe_01.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/84/Nuvola_apps_filetypes_red.svg/52px-Nuvola_apps_filetypes_red.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["phase","matter"],["dispersion","chemistry"],["homogenization","chemistry"],["vinaigrette","food"],["creaming","chemistry"],["coalescence","physics"],["creaming","chemistry"],["cream","pharmaceutical"],["arak","distilled_beverage"],["cream","pharmaceutical"],["paste","rheology"],["injection","medicine"],["fleet","laxative"]],"members":["coalescence","vinaigrette","homogenization","paste","creaming","cream","injection","phase","fleet","dispersion","arak"],"related":["Mixture","Liquid","Immiscible","Matter","Colloid","Phase_(matter)","Dispersion_(chemistry)","Vinaigrette","Milk","Mayonnaise","Cutting_fluid","Metal_working","Photographic_film","Probability_distribution","Phase_boundary","Scattering","White","Blue","Tyndall_effect","Yellow","Skimmed_milk","Cream","Microemulsions","Visible_spectrum","Nanometer","Microemulsions","Microemulsions","Surfactant","Solvent","Microemulsion","Homogenization_(chemistry)","Ultrasound","Vinaigrette_(food)","Microemulsions","Thermodynamics","Kinetics","Bancroft_rule","Flocculation","Creaming_(chemistry)","Coalescence_(physics)","Ostwald_ripening","Creaming_(chemistry)","Buoyancy","Centripetal_force","Centrifuge","Chemical_kinetics","Surfactant","Egg_yolk","Lecithin","Mustard_seed","Mucilage","Protein","Soy_lecithin","Pickering_emulsion","Sodium_stearoyl_lactylate","DATEM","Detergent","Cooking_oil","Water","Soap","Yellow_grease","Cleaning_agent","Pharmacy","Cream_(pharmaceutical)","Lotion","Emulsifying_wax","Cetearyl_alcohol","Polysorbate_20","Ceteareth","Nano-","Ouzo_effect","Anise","Ouzo","Pastis","Arak_(distilled_beverage)","Rakı","Ethanol","Espresso","Mayonnaise","Hollandaise_sauce","Lecithin","Sodium_stearoyl_lactylate","Homogenized_milk","Butter","Vinaigrette","Intravenous","Lecithin","Pharmaceutics","Hairstyling_product","Personal_hygiene","Cosmetics","Pharmaceutical_formulation","Cream_(pharmaceutical)","Ointment","Liniment","Paste_(rheology)","Thin_film","Liquid","Route_of_administration","Topical","Dosage_form","Human_skin","Transdermal","Eye_drop","Rectal","Vagina","Oral_administration","Injection_(medicine)","Calamine_lotion","Cod_liver_oil","Polysporin","Cortisol","Canesten","Fleet_(laxative)","Vaccine","Microbe","Soybean_oil","Antimicrobial","Surface_tension","Lipids","High-shear_mixer","Cell_membrane","Cell_envelope","Virus","Higher_organisms","Spermatozoon","Blood_cells","Intravenous","Disinfection","Surface","HIV-1","Tuberculosis","Porous","Fire_classes","Aqueous_solution","Fire-fighting_foam","Emulsion_dispersion","Microemulsion","Miniemulsion","Pickering_emulsion","Water-in-water_emulsion"]}
