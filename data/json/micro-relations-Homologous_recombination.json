{"cursor":"75889","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":", homologous recombination can produce new combinations of genes as shown here\nbetween similar but not identical copies of human chromosome 1.]] 'Homologous\nrecombination' is a type of genetic recombination in which nucleotide sequences\nare exchanged between two similar or identical molecules of DNA. It is most\nwidely used by cells to accurately repair harmful breaks that occur on both\nstrands of DNA, known as double-strand breaks. Homologous recombination also\nproduces new combinations of DNA sequences during meiosis, the process by which\neukaryotes make gamete cells, like sperm and egg cells in animals. These new\ncombinations of DNA represent genetic variation in offspring, which in turn\nenables populations to adapt during the course of evolution. Homologous recombination is also used in horizontal gene\ntransfer to exchange genetic material between different strains and species of\nbacteria and viruses.\n\nAlthough homologous recombination varies widely among different organisms and\ncell types, most forms involve the same basic steps. After a double-strand break\noccurs, sections of DNA around the 5' ends of the break are cut away in a\nprocess called resection. In the strand invasion step that follows, an\noverhanging 3' end of the broken DNA molecule then \"invades\" a similar or\nidentical DNA molecule that is not broken. After strand invasion, one or two cross-\nshaped structures called Holliday junctions connect the two DNA molecules.\nDepending on how the two junctions are cut by enzymes, the type of homologous\nrecombination that occurs in meiosis results in either chromosomal crossover or\nnon-crossover. Homologous recombination that occurs during DNA repair tends to\nresult in non-crossover products, in effect restoring the damaged DNA molecule\nas it existed before the double-strand break.\n\nHomologous recombination is conserved across all three domains of life as well\nas viruses, suggesting that it is a nearly universal biological mechanism. The\ndiscovery of genes for homologous recombination in protistsâa diverse group of\neukaryotic microorganismsâhas been interpreted as evidence that meiosis emerged\nearly in the evolution of eukaryotes. Since their dysfunction has been strongly\nassociated with increased susceptibility to several types of cancer, the\nproteins that facilitate homologous recombination are topics of active research.\nHomologous recombination is also used in gene targeting, a technique for\nintroducing genetic changes into target organisms. For their development of this\ntechnique, Mario Capecchi, Martin Evans and Oliver Smithies were awarded the\n2007 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine.\n","linknr":1191,"url":"Homologous_recombination","recorded":1362483282,"links":46,"instances":["gene","browser","bioinformatics","browser","molecular_biology","gene","gene","human","protein","browser_","genetics","browser","dna"],"pdf":["http://www.ias.ac.in/jgenet/Vol81No2/49.pdf","http://www.ias.ac.in/jgenet/Vol81No2/49.pdf","http://www2.biochemtech.uni-halle.de/xray/seminars/8_3.pdf","http://www2.biochemtech.uni-halle.de/xray/seminars/8_3.pdf","http://www.weizmann.ac.il/complex/tlusty/papers/MolCell2010.pdf","http://www.weizmann.ac.il/complex/tlusty/papers/MolCell2010.pdf","http://www.weizmann.ac.il/complex/tlusty/papers/MolCell2010B.pdf","http://www.weizmann.ac.il/complex/tlusty/papers/MolCell2010B.pdf","http://molecular.biosciences.wsu.edu/academics/courses/MBioS426/426-6c%20Thomas%20and%20Nielsen.pdf","http://molecular.biosciences.wsu.edu/academics/courses/MBioS426/426-6c%20Thomas%20and%20Nielsen.pdf"],"categories":["Genetics","DNA
