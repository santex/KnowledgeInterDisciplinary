In these cases, the term 'waveform' refers to\nthe shape of a graph of the varying quantity against time or distance. An\ninstrument called an oscilloscope can be used to pictorially represent a wave as\na repeating image on a screen. By extension, the term 'waveform' also describes\nthe shape of the graph of any varying quantity against time.\n","linknr":149,"url":"Waveform","recorded":1362484257,"links":31,"instances":["information_theory","video_game"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Waveforms|"],"headings":["Examples of waveforms","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/Waveforms.svg/350px-Waveforms.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["signal","information_theory"],["waveform","video_game"]],"members":["signal","waveform"],"related":["Square_wave","Triangle_wave","Sawtooth_wave","Signal_(information_theory)","Wave","Oscilloscope","Display_device","Periodic_function","Sine_wave","Trigonometry","Square_wave","Frequency","Harmonic","Triangle_wave","Harmonic","Sawtooth_wave","Time_base","Subtractive_synthesis","Frequency","Harmonic","Decibel","Basis_functions","Fourier_series","Fourier_transform","Arbitrary_waveform_generator","Electronic_tuner","Pulse_wave","Sawtooth_wave","Shape_waves","Sine_wave","Spectrum_analyzer","Square_wave","Triangle_wave","WAV","Waveform_monitor","Waveform_viewer","Waveform_(video_game)"]}
