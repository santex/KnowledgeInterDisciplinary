An example is: \"America was involved in the\nVietnam War\" versus \"America was right to get involved in the Vietnam War\". An\nopinion may be supported by facts, in which case it becomes an argument,\nalthough people may draw opposing opinions from the same set of facts. Opinions\nrarely change without new arguments being presented. It can be reasoned that one\nopinion is better supported by the facts than another by analyzing the\nsupporting arguments.<ref></ref> In casual use, the term opinion may be the\nresult of a person's perspective, understanding, particular feelings, beliefs,\nand desires. It may refer to unsubstantiated information, in contrast to\nknowledge and fact-based beliefs.\n\nCollective or professional opinions are defined as meeting a higher standard to\nsubstantiate the opinion.
