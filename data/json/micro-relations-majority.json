This can be compared to a plurality, which is a subset larger than\nany other subset considered; i.e. a plurality is not necessarily a majority as\nthe largest subset considered may consist of less than half the set's\nelements. In British English, majority and plurality are often used as\nsynonyms, and the term majority is also alternatively used to refer to the\nwinning margin, i.e. the number of votes separating the first-place finisher\nfrom the second-place finisher.\n\nA majority may be called a 'simple majority' to contrast with other types of\nmajority: an 'overall majority', in parliamentary systems, is the difference of\nlegislators between the government and its opposition; {{cite web\n| title= Overall Majority url= http://www.ldoceonline.com/dictionary/overall-\n| majority work= Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English publisher= Longmans\n| accessdate=2009-04-26}}\n an 'absolute majority' is a majority of all electors, not just those who\nvoted; \"With three-cornered contests as common as they\nnow are, we may have occasion to find a convenient single word for what we used\nto call an absolute majority...
