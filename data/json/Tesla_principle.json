[[Electrical\nExperimenter]], January 1919. p. 615.\n[http://www.teslasociety.com/pictures/teslaxc4.jpg] However, this phrase\nis no longer in conventional use. It was developed during Tesla's research in\nalternating currents where the current's magnitude and direction varied\ncyclically.\n\nIn 1946, on Tesla's principle, the first ultra-short waves were sent by radar to\nthe moon and the sun and brought back data about their distance from the\nEarth. Nikola Tesla Research, Health Research Books, Sept. 1996; isbn\n0787304042\n\nA reversible process in engineering is a process or operation of a system or\ndevice such that a net reverse in operation will accomplish the converse of the\noriginal function. The principle was that some systems could be reversed and\noperated in a complementary manner. During a demonstration of the Tesla turbine,\nthe disks revolved and machinery fastened to the shaft was operated by the\nengine. If the turbine's operation was reversed, the disks acted as a\npump. \"Tesla's New Monarch of Machines\". New York Herald Tribune, Oct. 15,\n1911. (Available online.
