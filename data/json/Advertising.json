Most commonly, the desired result is to drive consumer behavior with\nrespect to a commercial offering, although political and ideological\nadvertising is also common. In Latin, ad vertere means \"to turn the mind\ntoward.\" The purpose of advertising may also be to reassure employees or\nshareholders that a company is viable or successful. Advertising messages are\nusually paid for by sponsors and viewed via various traditional media;\nincluding mass media such as newspaper, magazines, television commercial, radio\nadvertisement, outdoor advertising or direct mail; or new media such as blogs,\nwebsites or text messages.\n\nCommercial advertisers often seek to generate increased consumption of their\nproducts or services through \"branding,\" which involves associating a product\nname or image with certain qualities in the minds of consumers. Non-commercial\nadvertisers who spend money to advertise items other than a consumer product or\nservice include political parties, interest groups, religious organizations and\ngovernmental agencies. Nonprofit organizations may rely on free modes of\npersuasion, such as a public service announcement (PSA).\n\nModern advertising was created with the innovative techniques introduced with\ntobacco advertising in the 1920s, most significantly with the campaigns of\nEdward Bernays, which is often considered the founder of modern, Madison Avenue\nadvertising.\n\nIn 2010, spending on advertising was estimated at $142.5 billion in the United\nStates and $467 billion worldwide \n\nInternationally, the largest (\"big four\") advertising conglomerates are\nInterpublic, Omnicom, Publicis, and WPP.\n","linknr":1344,"url":"Advertising","recorded":1362483691,"links":126,"instances":["united_kingdom","tv_series","electronic","magazine","advertising_agency","economics","airline","display_device","scam_ad","toothpaste","economics","economics","marketing","businessman","business","commercial","advertising_agency"],"pdf":["http://flora.insead.edu/fichiersti_wp/inseadwp1998/98-39.pdf","http://flora.insead.edu/fichiersti_wp/inseadwp1998/98-39.pdf","http://www.basmartin.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Martin-2003.pdf"],"categories":["Advertising|","Finance","Communication
