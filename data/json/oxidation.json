The sodium is oxidized, and the fluorine is reduced.]]\n\n'Redox' ('reduction-oxidation') reactions include all chemical reactions in\nwhich atoms have their oxidation state changed—that is, redox reactions involve\nthe transfer of electrons between species.\n\nThis can be either a simple redox process, such as the oxidation of carbon to\nyield carbon dioxide () or the reduction of carbon by hydrogen to yield methane\n(CH<sub>4</sub>), or a complex process such as the oxidation of glucose\n(C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>) in the human body through a series of\ncomplex electron transfer processes.\n\nThe term \"redox\" comes from two concepts involved with electron transfer:\nreduction and oxidation.<ref></ref> It can be explained in simple terms:\n* 'Oxidation' is the loss of electrons or an increase in oxidation state by a\n  molecule, atom, or ion.\n* 'Reduction' is the gain of electrons or a decrease in oxidation state by a\n  molecule, atom, or ion. <!-- There is a discussion of mnemonic devices on the\n  talk page that should be consulted. --> Although oxidation reactions are\n  commonly associated with the formation of oxides from oxygen molecules, these\n  are only specific examples of a more general concept of reactions involving\n  electron transfer.\n\nRedox reactions, or oxidation-reduction reactions, have a number of similarities\nto acid–base reactions. Like acid–base reactions, redox reactions are a matched\nset, that is, there cannot be an oxidation reaction without a reduction reaction\nhappening simultaneously. The oxidation alone and the reduction alone are each\ncalled a [[half-reaction]], because two half-reactions always occur together to\nform a whole reaction. When writing half-reactions, the gained or lost electrons\nare typically included explicitly in order that the half-reaction be balanced\nwith respect to electric charge.\n\nThough sufficient for many purposes, these descriptions are not precisely\ncorrect. Oxidation and reduction properly refer to a change in [[oxidation\nstate]] — the actual transfer of electrons may never occur. Thus, oxidation is\nbetter defined as an increase in oxidation state, and reduction as a decrease in\noxidation state. In practice, the transfer of electrons will always cause a\nchange in oxidation state, but there are many reactions that are classed as\n\"redox\" even though no electron transfer occurs (such as those involving\ncovalent bonds).\n\ning iron]]\n. ]]\n",
