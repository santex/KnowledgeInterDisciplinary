These terms are used in the\nmore recent literature in an attempt to reach a more neutral terminology. The\nolder literature, especially that which predates the Diagnostic and Statistical\nManual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR), almost exclusively refers to 'self-\nmutilation'. The term is synonymous with \"self-injury\".\n\nThe most common form of self-harm is skin-cutting but self-harm also covers a\nwide range of behaviors including, but not limited to, burning, scratching,\nbanging or hitting body parts, interfering with wound healing, hair-pulling\n(trichotillomania) and the ingestion of toxic substances or objects. Behaviours\nassociated with substance abuse and eating disorders are usually not considered\nself-harm because the resulting tissue damage is ordinarily an unintentional\nside effect. However, the boundaries are not\nalways clearly defined and in some cases behaviours that usually fall outside\nthe boundaries of self-harm may indeed represent self-harm if performed with\nexplicit intent to cause tissue damage. Although\nsuicide is not the intention of self-harm, the relationship between self-harm\nand suicide is complex, as self-harming behaviour may be potentially life-\nthreatening. There is also an increased risk of suicide in\nindividuals who self-harm to the\nextent that self-harm is found in 40â60% of suicides. However, generalising self-harmers to be suicidal is,\nin the majority of cases, inaccurate.\n\nSelf-harm is listed in the DSM-IV-TR as a symptom of borderline personality\ndisorder. However patients with other diagnoses may also self-harm, including\nthose with depression, anxiety disorders, substance abuse, eating disorders, post-\ntraumatic stress disorder, schizophrenia, and several personality disorders. Self-harm is also apparent in high-functioning individuals\nwho have no underlying clinical diagnosis. The\nmotivations for self-harm vary and it may be used to fulfill a number of\ndifferent functions. These functions include self-harm\nbeing used as a coping mechanism which provides temporary relief of intense\nfeelings such as anxiety, depression, stress, emotional numbness or a sense of\nfailure or self-loathing and other mental traits including low self-\nesteem See Impression formation. or perfectionism. Self-harm is often\nassociated with a history of trauma and abuse, including emotional and sexual\nabuse. There are a number of\ndifferent methods that can be used to treat self-harm and which concentrate on\neither treating the underlying causes or on treating the behaviour itself. When\nself-harm is associated with depression, antidepressant drugs and treatments may\nbe effective. Other approaches involve avoidance techniques,\nwhich focus on keeping the individual occupied with other activities, or\nreplacing the act of self-harm with safer methods that do not lead to permanent\ndamage.\n\nSelf-harm is most common in adolescence and young adulthood, usually first\nappearing between the ages of 12 and 24. Self-harm in childhood is relatively rare but the rate has\nbeen increasing since the 1980s. However, self-\nharm behaviour can nevertheless occur at any age,\nincluding in the elderly population. The risk of\nserious injury and suicide is higher in older people who self-harm. Self-harm is not limited to humans. Captive non-human animals,\nsuch as birds and monkeys, are also known to participate in self-harming\nbehaviour.\n","linknr":933,"url":"Self-injury","recorded":1362373703,"links":61,"instances":["jewish_law","psychology","psychology"],"pdf":["http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/pdf/CG16FullGuideline.pdf","http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/pdf/CG16FullGuideline.pdf","http://www.kjm.keio.ac.jp/past/58/3/144.pdf","http://www.kjm.keio.ac.jp/past/58/3/144.pdf","http://www.nta.nhs.uk/publications/documents/clinical_guidelines_2007.pdf","http://www.nta.nhs.uk/publications/documents/clinical_guidelines_2007.pdf","http://www.cawt.com/Site/11/Documents/NI%20Registry%20of%20Deliberate%20Self%20Harm%202%20year%20report.pdf","http://www.cawt.com/Site/11/Documents/NI%20Registry%20of%20Deliberate%20Self%20Harm%202%20year%20report.pdf","http://www.affinityhealth.co.uk/pdf/SHS.pdf","http://www.affinityhealth.co.uk/pdf/SHS.pdf","http://etd.lib.fsu.edu/theses_1/available/etd-09132005-192859/unrestricted/DominiqueRoeSepowitzDissertation.pdf","http://etd.lib.fsu.edu/theses_1/available/etd-09132005-192859/unrestricted/DominiqueRoeSepowitzDissertation.pdf"],"categories":["Abnormal
