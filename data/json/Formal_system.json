{"cursor":"7981","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'formal system' is, broadly defined as any well-defined system of abstract\nthought based on the model of mathematics. Euclid's [[Euclid's\nElements|Elements]] is often held to be the first formal system and displays the\ncharacteristic of a formal system. The entailment of the system by its logical\nfoundation is what distinguishes a formal system from others which may have some\nbasis in an abstract model. Often the formal system will be the basis for or\neven identified with a larger theory or field (e.g. Euclidean geometry)\nconsistent with the usage in modern mathematics such as model theory. A formal\nsystem need not be mathematical as such, Spinoza's Ethics for example imitates\nthe form of Euclid's Elements.\n\nEach formal system has a formal language, which is composed by primitive\nsymbols. These symbols act on certain rules of formation and are developed by\ninference from a set of axioms. The system thus consists of any number of\nformulas built up through finite combinations of the primitive\nsymbolsâcombinations that are formed from the axioms in accordance with the\nstated rules. EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica, [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9034889/formal-\nsystem Formal system] definition, 2007.\n\nFormal systems in mathematics consist of the following elements:\n# A finite set of symbols (i.e. the alphabet), that can be used for constructing\n# formulas (i.e. finite strings of symbols). A grammar, which tells how well-\n# formed formulas (abbreviated wff) are constructed out of the symbols in the\n# alphabet. It is usually required that there be a decision procedure for\n# deciding whether a formula is well formed or not. A set of axioms or axiom\n# schemata: each axiom must be a wff. A set of inference rules.\n\nA formal system is said to be recursive (i.e. effective) if the set of axioms\nand the set of inference rules are decidable sets or semidecidable sets,\naccording to context.\n\nSome theorists use the term formalism as a rough synonym for formal system, but\nthe term is also used to refer to a particular style of notation, for example,\nPaul Dirac's bra-ket notation.\n","linknr":579,"url":"Formal_system","recorded":1362476965,"links":41,"instances":["mathematical_logic","logic","formal","computer_science","logic","mathematics","computer_science","book"],"pdf":["http://www-ls.informatik.uni-tuebingen.de/psh/forschung/publikationen/RoutledgeFLS1995.pdf"],"categories":["Formal languages","Mathematical logic","Formal methods","Metalogic","Syntax (logic)","Formal systems|"],"headings":["Related subjects","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/Complex-adaptive-system.jpg/32px-Complex-adaptive-system.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/Logical_connectives_Hasse_diagram.svg/20px-Logical_connectives_Hasse_diagram.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["ethics","book"],["symbol","formal"],["alphabet","computer_science"],["interpretation","logic"],["sentence","mathematical_logic"],["decidability","logic"],["set","mathematics"],["string","computer_science"]],"members":["sentence","decidability","symbol","string","interpretation","set","alphabet","ethics"],"related":["Abstraction","Mathematics","Entailment","Euclidean_geometry","Model_theory","Ethics_(book)","Formal_language","Symbol_(formal)","Axiom","Alphabet_(computer_science)","Grammar","Well-formed_formula","Axiom_schema","Rule_of_inference","Recursive_set","Decidable_set","Recursively_enumerable_set","Paul_Dirac","Bra-ket_notation","Semantics_of_logic","Model_theory","Interpretation_(logic)","Truth_value","Sentence_(mathematical_logic)","Free_variable","Soundness","Complete","Axiom","David_Hilbert","Metamathematics","Decidability_(logic)","Metatheorem","Formal_language","Linguistics","Syntax","Semantics","Formal_language_theory","Computer_science","Linguistics","Formal_language","Set_(mathematics)","String_(computer_science)","Generative_grammar","Analytic_grammar","Axiomatic_system","Formal_ethics","Lambda_calculus","Proof_calculus","List_of_formal_systems","Axiom","Formal_grammar","Formal_language","Formal_method","Formal_science","Gödel's_incompleteness_theorems","QED_manifesto","Substitution_instance","Douglas_Hofstadter"]}
