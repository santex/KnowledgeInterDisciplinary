{"cursor":"38987","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n]] ASR teleprinter, with punched tape reader and punch, usable as a computer\nterminal]]\n\nA 'teleprinter' ('teletypewriter', 'Teletype' or 'TTY') is an electromechanical\ntypewriter that can be used to send and receive typed messages from point to\npoint and point to multipoint over various types of communications channels.\nThey were adapted to provide a text-based user interface to early mainframe\ncomputers and minicomputers, sending typed data to the computer with or without\nprinted output, and printing the response from the computer. Some models could\nalso be used to create punched tape for data storage (either from typed input or\nfrom data received from a remote source) and to read back such tape for local\nprinting or for transmission of previously stored messages and data. These\npunched tapes were also compatible with higher speed tape readers and punches\ndirectly attached to computers.\n\nTeleprinters could use a variety of different communication media. These\nincluded a simple pair of wires, dedicated non-switched telephone circuits\n(leased lines), switched networks that operated similarly to the public\ntelephone network, and radio and microwave links. A teleprinter attached to a\nmodem could also communicate through standard switched public telephone lines.\nThis latter configuration was often used to connect teleprinters to remote\ncomputers, particularly in time-sharing environments.\n\nTeleprinters are now largely obsolete, having been replaced by fully electronic\ncomputer terminals which usually use a computer monitor instead of a printer\n(though the term \"TTY\" is still occasionally used to refer to them, such as in\nUnix systems). Nevertheless, teleprinters are still widely used in the aviation\nindustry (AFTN and airline teletype system), and variations called\nTelecommunications Devices for the Deaf ('TDDs') are still used by the hearing\nimpaired for typed communications over ordinary telephone lines.\n","linknr":868,"url":"Teleprinter","recorded":1362902180,"links":58,"instances":["am","inventor","telecommunications","telecommunications","linguistics"],"pdf":["http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/teletype/138_Model15_Adj_Oct41.pdf","http://www.baudot.net/docs/haynes--notes.pdf"],"categories":["History
