Several versions of\nthe Agreement were published, each adapted to address not only broad concerns\nbut also specific issues during the fast changing revolutionary political\nenvironment of those years. The Agreements of the People have been most\nassociated as the manifestos of the Levellers but were also published by the\nAgitators and the General Council of the New Model Army.\n\nMajor published versions of the Agreement include:\n* \"An Agreement of the People for a firm and present peace upon grounds of\n  common right\", presented to the Army Council in October\n  1647.

Tendered as\n  a Peace-Offering to this distressed Nation] an extended version from the\n  imprisonment of the Leveller leaders, May 1649\n\nSoon after the First English Civil War, the Agreement was the subject of the\nPutney Debates in 1647. The major tenets of this first version of the Agreement\nwere: freedom of religion, the frequent convening of a new Parliaments and\nequality for all under the law. These tenets also appeared in the later\nversions of the manifesto. As these basic proposals were queried, other\nprovisions were added; for example Roman Catholics were exempt from the right\nto religious freedom, and the electorate was to be made up of adult male\nproperty holders. The Levellers hoped to base England's new constitution on the\nAgreement of the People, but in the end, the New Model Army based their demands\non an alternative less revolutionary document, the Heads of Proposals, that was\nproposed and supported by the [[Grandee (New Model Army)|Grandee]]s (senior\nofficers) of the Army.\n\nThe Agreement is believed to have \"greatly influence[ed] the development of the\nU.S.\nConstitution.\" [http://members.mobar.org/civics/Prelude%20to%20Liberty.htm\nPrelude to Liberty.] \"Civics Library of the Missouri
