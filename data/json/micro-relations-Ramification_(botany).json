{"cursor":"2269","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n a regular, cone-shaped outline.]] In botany, 'ramification' is the divergence\n of the stem and limbs of a plant into smaller ones, i.e. trunk into branches,\n branches into increasingly smaller branches, etc. Gardeners stimulate the\n process of ramification through pruning, thereby making trees, shrubs and other\n plants bushier and denser.\n\nShort internodes (the section of stem between nodes, i.e. areas where leaves are\nproduced) help increase ramification in those plants that form branches at these\nnodes. Long internodes (which may be the result of over-watering, the over-use\nof fertilizer, or a seasonal \"growth spurt\") decrease a gardener's ability to\ninduce ramification in a plant.\n\nA high degree of ramification is essential for the creation of topiary as it\nenables the topiary artist to carve a bush or hedge into a shape with an even\nsurface. Ramification is also essential to practitioners of the art of bonsai as\nit helps recreate the form and habit of a full-size tree in a small tree grown\nin a container.\n\nThe pruning practices of coppicing and pollarding induce ramification by\nremoving most of a tree's mass above the root. Fruit tree pruning increases the\nyield of orchards by inducing ramification and thereby creating many vigorous,\nfruitful branches in the place of a few less-fruitful ones.\n","linknr":109,"url":"Ramification_(botany)","recorded":1362482704,"links":15,"instances":["botany","geometry","barrier"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Plant physiology","Horticulture and gardening","Plant anatomy","Plant morphology"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3f/Araucaria_heterophylla_01.jpg/220px-Araucaria_heterophylla_01.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8d/Fern.jpg/35px-Fern.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cone","geometry"],["trunk","botany"],["hedge","barrier"]],"members":["trunk","cone","hedge"],"related":["Cone_(geometry)","Botany","Plant_stem","Plant","Trunk_(botany)","Branch","Pruning","Tree","Shrub","Internodes","Leaf","Fertilizer","Topiary","Hedge_(barrier)","Bonsai_aesthetics","Coppicing","Pollarding","Fruit_trees_pruning","Orchards"]}
