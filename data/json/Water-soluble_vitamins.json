Lieberman, S, Bruning, N\n(1990). The Real Vitamin & Mineral Book. NY: Avery Group, 3, ISBN 0-89529-769-\n8 An organic chemical compound (or related set of compounds) is called a\nvitamin when it cannot be synthesized in sufficient quantities by an organism,\nand must be obtained from the diet. Thus, the term is conditional both on the\ncircumstances and on the particular organism. For example, ascorbic acid\n(vitamin C) is a vitamin for humans, but not for most other animals, and biotin\nand vitamin D are required in the human diet only in certain circumstances.\n\nBy convention, the term vitamin includes neither other essential nutrients, such\nas dietary minerals, essential fatty acids, or essential amino acids (which are\nneeded in larger amounts than vitamins) nor the large number of other nutrients\nthat promote health but are otherwise required less often. {{cite book |last\n= Maton |first = Anthea |coauthors = Jean Hopkins, Charles William McLaughlin,\nSusan Johnson, Maryanna Quon Warner, David LaHart, Jill D.

Thus, each \"vitamin\" refers to a number of [[vitamer]] compounds that\nall show the biological activity associated with a particular vitamin. Such a\nset of chemicals is grouped under an alphabetized vitamin \"generic descriptor\"\ntitle, such as \"vitamin A\", which includes the compounds retinal, retinol, and\nfour known carotenoids. Vitamers by definition are convertible to the active\nform of the vitamin in the body, and are sometimes inter-convertible to one\nanother, as well.\n\nVitamins have diverse biochemical functions. Some have hormone-like functions as\nregulators of mineral metabolism (such as vitamin D), or regulators of cell and\ntissue growth and differentiation (such as some forms of vitamin A). Others\nfunction as antioxidants (e.g., vitamin E and sometimes vitamin C). The largest number of vitamins (such as B complex vitamins)\nfunction as precursors for enzyme cofactors, that help enzymes in their work as\ncatalysts in metabolism. In this role, vitamins may be tightly bound to enzymes\nas part of prosthetic groups: For example, biotin is part of enzymes involved in\nmaking fatty acids.\n\nVitamins may also be less tightly bound to enzyme catalysts as coenzymes,\ndetachable molecules that function to carry chemical groups or electrons between\nmolecules. For example, folic acid may carry methyl, formyl, and methylene\ngroups in the cell. Although these roles in assisting enzyme-substrate reactions\nare vitamins' best-known function, the other vitamin functions are equally\nimportant.\n\nUntil the mid-1930s, when the first commercial yeast-extract vitamin B complex\nand semi-synthetic vitamin C supplement tablets were sold, vitamins were\nobtained solely through food intake, and changes in diet (which, for example,\ncould occur during a particular growing season) usually greatly altered the\ntypes and amounts of vitamins ingested. However, vitamins have been produced as\ncommodity chemicals and made widely available as inexpensive semisynthetic and\nsynthetic-source multivitamin dietary and food supplements and additives, since\nthe middle of the 20th century.\n\nThe term vitamin was derived from \"vitamine,\" a compound word coined in 1912 by\nthe Polish biochemist Kazimierz Funk when working at the Lister\nInstitute of Preventive Medicine. The name is from vital and amine, meaning\namine of life, because it was suggested in 1912 that the organic micronutrient\nfood factors that prevent beriberi and perhaps other similar dietary-deficiency\ndiseases might be chemical amines. This proved incorrect for the micronutrient\nclass, and the word was shortened to vitamin.\n","linknr":1108,"url":"Water-soluble_vitamins","recorded":1362510008,"links":127,"instances":["biochemistry","physician","food","epidemiology","linguistics","fruit","food"],"pdf":["http://www.iom.edu/Object.File/Master/7/296/0.pdf","http://www.iom.edu/Object.File/Master/7/296/0.pdf","http://www.iom.edu/Object.File/Master/7/296/0.pdf","http://www.aapcc.org/dnn/Portals/0/2008annualreport.pdf","http://www.aapcc.org/dnn/Portals/0/2008annualreport.pdf","http://www.lifeinyouryears.net/everyvitamin.pdf","http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/dga/rda.pdf"],"categories":["Essential
