Firepower is normally provided by a large-calibre main gun in a\nrotating turret and secondary machine guns, while heavy armour and all-terrain\nmobility provide protection for the tank and its crew, allowing it to perform\nall primary tasks of the armoured troops on the battlefield. von Senger and\nEtterlin (1960), The World's Armored Fighting Vehicles, p.9.\n\nTanks in World War I were developed separately and simultaneously by Great\nBritain and France as a means to break the deadlock of trench warfare on the\nWestern Front. Their first use in combat was by the British Army on September\n15, 1916 at Flers-Courcelette, during the Battle of the Somme. The name \"tank\"\nwas adopted by the British during the early stages of their development, as a\nsecurity measure to conceal their purpose (see etymology). While the French and\nBritish built thousands of tanks between them, Germany developed and brought\ninto service only a single design the A7V producing 20 vehicles due to lack of\ncapacities or resources.\n\nTanks of the interwar period evolved into the designs of World War II. Important\nconcepts of armoured warfare were developed; the Soviet Union launched the first\nmass tank/air attack at Khalkhin Gol (Nomonhan) in August 1939, Coox (1985),\np. 579, 590, 663 which later resulted in the T-34, a predecessor of the\nmain battle tank; this was quickly followed up by Germany on a larger scale when\nthey introduced blitzkrieg ('lightning war') less than two weeks later; a\ntechnique which made use of massed concentrations of tanks supported by\nartillery and air power to break through the enemy front and cause a complete\ncollapse in enemy resistance and morale.\n\nTanks in the Cold War advanced to counter greater battlefield threats. Tanks\nbecame larger and their armour became thicker and much more effective. Advances\nin manufacturing late in the war allowed the mass production of composite\narmor. Aspects of gun technology changed significantly as well, with advances\nin shell design.\n\nDuring the 20th century, main battle tanks were considered a key component of\nmodern armies. In the 21st century, with the increasing\nrole of asymetrical warfare and the end of the Cold War, that also contributed\nto the increase of cost-effective Russian anti-tank weapons worldwide, the\nimportance of tanks has waned. Modern tanks seldom operate alone, as they are\norganized into armoured units which involve the support of infantry, who may\naccompany the tanks in infantry fighting vehicles. They are also usually\nsupported by reconnaissance or ground-attack aircraft.\n","linknr":1646,"url":"Tank","recorded":1362500451,"links":167,"instances":["military","partition","mobile_bridge","military","magazine","ballistics","idf","united_kingdom","crossing","projectile","tank","geometric","military","wwi","mechanics","military","countermeasure","world_war_ii","military"],"pdf":["http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/1997/5fcs97.pdf","http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/1997/5fcs97.pdf"],"categories":["Tanks|","Armoured
