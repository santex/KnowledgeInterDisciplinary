{"cursor":"9144","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" in Wittgenstein, Germany.]]\n\nIn ecology, a 'disturbance' is a temporary change in average environmental\nconditions that causes a pronounced change in an ecosystem. Outside disturbance\nforces often act quickly and with great effect, sometimes resulting in the\nremoval of large amounts of biomass. Ecological disturbances include fires,\nflooding, windstorm, insect outbreaks, as well as anthropogenic disturbances\nsuch as trampling, forest clearing, and the introduction of exotic species. Disturbances can have profound immediate effects on\necosystems and can, accordingly, greatly alter the natural community. Because of\nthese and the impacts on populations, these effects can continue for an extended\nperiod of time.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Disturbance_(ecology)","recorded":1372152239,"links":[],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Landscape ecology","Ecological succession","Ecology terminology","Environmental terminology","Habitat (ecology) terminology"],"headings":["Disturbance conditions","Disturbance as part of a cycle","Species adapted to disturbance","Importance","See also","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Germany","Ecology","Ecosystem","Fires","Flooding","Windstorm","Human_impact_on_the_environment","Disturbance","Deforestation","Introduced_species","Community","Ecological_succession","Mountain_pine_beetle","Lodgepole_pine","Greece","Shade-intolerant","Aspen","Jack_Pine","Shade-intolerant_species","Ponderosa_pine","Douglas-fir","Patch_dynamics","Ecological_succession","Forest_pathology","Intermediate_Disturbance_Hypothesis"]}
