For orbital spaceflights, spacecraft\nenter closed orbits around the Earth or around other celestial bodies.\nSpacecraft used for human spaceflight carry people on board as crew or\npassengers from start or on orbit (space stations) only, while those used for\nrobotic space missions operate either autonomously or telerobotically. Robotic\nspacecraft used to support scientific research are space probes. Robotic\nspacecraft that remain in orbit around a planetary body are artificial\nsatellites. Only a handful of interstellar probes, such as Pioneer 10 and 11,\nVoyager 1 and 2, and New Horizons, are currently on trajectories that leave our\nSolar System.\n\nOrbital spacecraft may be recoverable or not. By method of reentry to Earth they\nmay be divided in non-winged space capsules and winged spaceplanes.\n\nCurrently, only twenty-four nations have spaceflight technology: Russia\n(Roscosmos, the Russian Space Forces), the United States (NASA, the US Air\nForce, SpaceX (a U.S private aerospace company)), the member states of the\nEuropean Space Agency, the People's Republic of China (China National Space\nAdministration), Japan (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency), and India (Indian\nSpace Research Organisation).\n\nSpacecraft and space travel are common themes in works of science fiction.\n",
