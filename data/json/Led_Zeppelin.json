The band\nconsisted of guitarist Jimmy Page, singer Robert Plant, bassist/keyboardist John\nPaul Jones, and drummer John Bonham. They are widely considered to be one of the\nmost successful, innovative and influential rock groups in history.\n\nAfter changing their name from The New Yardbirds, they signed a favourable deal\nwith Atlantic Records that allowed them considerable artistic freedom. Led\nZeppelin disliked releasing their songs as singles; they viewed their albums as\nindivisible and complete listening experiences. Due to the heavy, guitar-driven\nblues rock sound of their first two albums, Led Zeppelin are frequently\nrecognised as the progenitors of heavy metal and hard rock. However, the band's\nindividualistic style drew from a wide variety of influences, including folk\nmusic, which they incorporated into their next two albums. Their untitled fourth\nalbum, which features the track \"Stairway to Heaven\", is among the most popular\nand influential works in rock music, and it cemented the status of the group as\n\"superstars.\" Subsequent albums saw greater experimentation and were accompanied\nby record-breaking tours, which earned them a reputation for excess. Although\nthey remained commercially and critically successful, in the later 1970s, the\nband's output and touring schedule were limited by the personal difficulties and\ncircumstances of the members. Led Zeppelin disbanded following Bonham's\nunexpected death in 1980.\n\nSince 1980, the surviving members have pursued solo careers and have also been\ninvolved in a series of collaborations and sporadic one-off reunions. In 2007,\n27 years after the group disbanded, the surviving members of Led Zeppelin\nreunited (along with John Bonham's son, Jason) for the Ahmet Ertegun Tribute\nConcert at The O2 Arena in London. The band were honoured with the \"Best Live\nAct\" prize for their one-off reunion at MOJO Awards 2008, where they were\ndescribed as the \"greatest rock and roll band of all time\".\n\nLed Zeppelin are one of the best-selling music artists in the history of audio\nrecordingâvarious sources estimate the group's sales at more than 200 or even\n300 million albums worldwide. With 111.5 million RIAA-certified units\nthey are the second-best-selling band in the United States .\nEach of their nine studio albums reached the top 10 of the US ''Billboard''\nalbum chart, and six reached the number-one spot. [[Rolling Stone]] magazine\ndescribed them as \"the heaviest band of all time\", \"the biggest band of the\n'70s\" and \"unquestionably one of the most enduring bands in rock history\".\nSimilarly, the US Rock and Roll Hall of Fame stated that the band were \"as\ninfluential in that decade [the 1970s] as the Beatles were in the prior one\".\n","linknr":1788,"url":"Led_Zeppelin","recorded":1362551521,"links":130,"instances":["music","musician","music_manager","musician","band","entertainer","song","band","american_band","london","new_york_city","album","uk","band","musicologist","musician","band","music","jazz_performance_style","promoter","song","musician","drummer"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Led
