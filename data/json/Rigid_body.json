In other words, the distance between any two given\npoints of a rigid body remains constant in time regardless of external forces\nexerted on it. Even though such an object cannot physically exist due to\nrelativity, objects can normally be assumed to be perfectly rigid if they are\nnot moving near the speed of light.\n\nIn classical mechanics a rigid body is usually considered as a continuous mass\ndistribution, while in quantum mechanics a rigid body is usually thought of as a\ncollection of point masses. For instance, in quantum mechanics molecules\n(consisting of the point masses: electrons and nuclei) are often seen as rigid\nbodies (see classification of molecules as rigid rotors).\n","linknr":414,"url":"Rigid_body","recorded":1362540122,"links":44,"instances":["objects","physics","rigid_body","physics","geometry","physics","geometry","rigid_body_dynamics","mathematics","engineering","physics","geometry","geometry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Rigid
