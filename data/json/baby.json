When applied to humans,\nthe term is usually considered synonymous with 'baby' or bairn (Scotland), but\nthe latter is commonly applied to the young of any animal. When a human child\nlearns to walk, the term [[toddler]] may be used instead.\n\nThe term infant is typically applied to young children between the ages of 1\nmonth and 12 months; however, definitions may vary between birth and 2 years of\nage. A 'newborn' is an infant who is only hours, days, or up to a few weeks old.\nIn medical contexts, newborn or 'neonate' (from Latin, neonatus, newborn) refers\nto an infant in the first 28 days after birth;<ref name=\"mwn\"></ref> the term\napplies to premature infants, postmature infants, and full term infants. Before\nbirth, the term [[fetus]] is used.\n",
