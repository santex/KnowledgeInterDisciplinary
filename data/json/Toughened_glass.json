Tempering creates balanced internal stresses which cause the\nglass, when broken, to crumble into small granular chunks instead of splintering\ninto jagged shards. The granular chunks are less likely to cause injury.\n\nAs a result of its safety and strength, tempered glass is used in a variety of\ndemanding applications, including passenger vehicle windows, shower doors,\narchitectural glass doors and tables, refrigerator trays, as a component of\nbulletproof glass, for diving masks, and various types of plates and cookware.\nIn the United States, federal safety laws require that window glass be tempered\nif each of the following criteria are met: sill height within 18 in (0.457 m) of\nthe floor, top edge greater than 36 in (0.914 m) from the floor, area greater\nthan 9 ftÂ² (0.836 mÂ²), and horizontal distance to nearest walking surface of\nless than 36 in (0.914 m). http://www.diychatroom.com/f19/when-tempered-glass-required-\n36117/#post214129\n","linknr":267,"url":"Toughened_glass","recorded":1362481699,"links":32,"instances":["glass","tableware","unit"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Glass engineering and science","Glass types","Glass physics"],"headings":["Properties","Uses","Manufacturing","Advantages","Disadvantages","History","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/Broken_phone_box.jpg/200px-Broken_phone_box.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a0/Safeguard_Glass_Markings_1.jpg/220px-Safeguard_Glass_Markings_1.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7d/Tempered_Glass_2.jpg/220px-Tempered_Glass_2.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Broken_Meat_Case_Window.JPG/220px-Broken_Meat_Case_Window.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["arc_international","tableware"],["annealing","glass"],["pascal","unit"],["pascal","unit"]],"members":["annealing","arc_international","pascal"],"related":["Telephone_booth","Safety_glass","Heat_treatment","Passenger_vehicle","Bulletproof_glass","Diving_mask","Prince_Rupert's_Drops","Polarizer","Pittsburgh_Plate_Glass","Windshield","Laminated_glass","Cooking","Baking","Pyrex","Corelle","Arc_International_(tableware)","Annealing_(glass)","Chemically_strengthened_glass","Ion_exchange","Pascal_(unit)","Pounds_per_square_inch","Pascal_(unit)","Rudolph_A._Seiden","Prince_Rupert_of_the_Rhine","Prince_Rupert's_Drops","King_Charles_II_of_England","Practical_joke"]}
