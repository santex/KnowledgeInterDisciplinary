Physical topology refers to the placement of\nthe network's various components, including device location and cable\ninstallation, while ''logical'' topology shows how data flows within a network,\nregardless of its physical design. Distances between nodes, physical\ninterconnections, transmission rates, and/or signal types may differ between two\nnetworks, yet their topologies may be identical.\n\nA good example is a local area network (LAN): Any given node in the LAN has one\nor more physical links to other devices in the network; graphically mapping\nthese links results in a geometric shape that can be used to describe the\nphysical topology of the network. Conversely, mapping the data flow between the\ncomponents determines the logical topology of the network.\n",
