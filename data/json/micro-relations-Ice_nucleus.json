There are many\nprocesses that can take place in the atmosphere to form ice particles; the\nsimplest is by water vapor depositing directly onto the solid particle. The\npresence of an ice nucleus can also cause a previously supercooled water droplet\nto freeze through contact, immersion or dissolution within the water that would\notherwise have stayed in the liquid phase at a given temperature. {{cite journal\n | doi = 10.1524/zpch.218.11.1231.50812 author = Koop, T. date = March 25, 2004\n | | title = Homogeneous ice nucleation in water and aqueous solutions volume =\n | 218 issue = 11 pages = 1231â1258 url =\n | http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=16233451 accessdate = 2008-04-07\n | journal = Zeitschrift fÃ¼r physikalische Chemie\n }}\n\nIce particles can have a significant effect on cloud dynamics. They are known\nto be important in the processes by which clouds can become electrified,\nwhich causes lightning. They are also known to be able to form the seeds for\nrain droplets.\n\nMany different types of particulates in the atmosphere can act as 'ice nuclei',\nboth natural and anthropogenic, including those composed of minerals, soot,\norganic matter and sulfate. However, the exact nucleation potential of each type\nvaries greatly, depending on the exact atmospheric conditions. Very little is\nknown about the spatial distribution of these particles, their overall\nimportance on global climate through ice cloud formation and whether human\nactivity has played a major role in changing these effects.\n\nRecent research shows that bacteria found in the atmosphere all over the world\nmay be responsible for much ice nucleation.\n","linknr":153,"url":"Ice_nucleus","recorded":1362685296,"links":18,"instances":["physics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Clouds","Particulates"],"headings":["References","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Cyclone_Catarina_from_the_ISS_on_March_26_2004.JPG/40px-Cyclone_Catarina_from_the_ISS_on_March_26_2004.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["deposition","physics"]],"members":["deposition"],"related":["Nucleation","Ice_crystal","Earth's_atmosphere","Ice","Deposition_(physics)","Supercooling","Freezing","Cloud","Lightning","Cloud_seeding","Atmospheric_particulate_matter","Nucleation","Bergeron_process","Cloud_condensation_nuclei","Nucleation","Snow","Supercooling"]}
