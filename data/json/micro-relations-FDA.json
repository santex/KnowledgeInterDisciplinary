The FDA is responsible for protecting and\npromoting public health through the regulation and supervision of food safety,\ntobacco products, dietary supplements, prescription and over-the-counter\npharmaceutical drugs (medications), vaccines, biopharmaceuticals, blood\ntransfusions, medical devices, electromagnetic radiation emitting devices\n(ERED), and veterinary products.\n\nThe FDA also enforces other laws, notably Section 361 of the Public Health\nService Act and associated regulations, many of which are not directly related\nto food or drugs. These include sanitation requirements on interstate travel and\ncontrol of disease on products ranging from certain household pets to sperm\ndonation for assisted reproduction.\n\nThe FDA is led by the Commissioner of Food and Drugs, appointed by the President\nwith the advice and consent of the Senate. The Commissioner reports to the\nSecretary of Health and Human Services. The 21st and current Commissioner is Dr.\nMargaret A. Hamburg. She has served as Commissioner since February 2009.\n\nThe FDA has its headquarters in unincoporated White Oak, Maryland. The agency also has 223 field offices and 13\nlaboratories located throughout the 50 states, the United States Virgin Islands,\nand Puerto Rico. In 2008, the FDA started opening offices\nin foreign countries, including China, India, Costa Rica, Chile, Belgium, and\nthe United Kingdom.\n\nIn June 1906, President Theodore Roosevelt signed into law the Food and Drug\nAct, also known as the \"Wiley Act\" after its chief advocate Dr. Harvey\nWashington Wiley who riveted the country's and eventually congress's attention\nwith public hygiene demonstrations. This act was the basis for the modern USDA,\nbeing originally given the name of the Food, Drug, and Insecticide organization.\nThe name eventually was shortened to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) a\nfew years later.\n","linknr":1049,"url":"FDA","recorded":1362503923,"links":77,"instances":["horse","rcc","disambiguation","fda"],"pdf":["http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Training/ClinicalInvestigatorTrainingCourse/UCM283299.pdf","http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Training/ClinicalInvestigatorTrainingCourse/UCM283299.pdf","http://www.thefactsaboutwater.org/uploads/BW%20PWS%20Just%20the%20Facts%202011%20Final.pdf","http://www.fda.gov/downloads/AboutFDA/CentersOffices/OfficeofMedicalProductsandTobacco/CDER/UCM148055.pdf","http://www.independent.org/pdf/policy_reports/2010-02-10-fda.pdf","http://www.independent.org/pdf/policy_reports/2010-02-10-fda.pdf","http://www.abigail-alliance.org/WLF_FDA.pdf","http://www.finance.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/111804dgtest.pdf"],"categories":["Food
