{"cursor":"14928","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nThe 'nats' (; ) are spirits worshipped in Burma (or Myanmar) in conjunction with\nBuddhism. They are divided between the 37 Great Nats and all the rest (i.e.,\nspirits of trees, water, etc.). Almost all of the 37 Great Nats were human\nbeings who met violent deaths (, lit. \"green death\"). They may thus also be\ncalled nat sein (; lit. green spirits). The word 'sein', while meaning 'green',\nis being used to mean 'raw' in this context. There are however two types of nats\nin Burmese Buddhist belief.\n\nNat spirits are termed lower nats or auk nats (), whether named or unnamed,\nwhereas ahtet nats () or higher nat dewas inhabit the six heavens.\nMuch like sainthood, nats can be designated for a variety of reasons, including\nthose only known in certain regions in Burma. Nat worship is less common in\nurban areas than in rural areas, and is practised among ethnic minorities as\nwell as in the mainstream Bamar society. It is however among the Buddhist Bamar\nthat the most highly developed form of ceremony and ritual is seen.\n\nEvery Burmese village has a nat sin () which essentially serves as a shrine to\nthe village guardian nat called the ywa saung nat (). An offertory coconut () is\noften hung on the main southeast post () in the house, wearing a [[gaung baung]]\n(headdress) and surrounded by perfume, as an offering to the Min Mahagiri (Lord\nof the Great Mountain), also known as the ein dwin () or ein saung () (house\nguardian) nat. One may inherit a certain member or in some instances two of the\n37 Nats as mi hsaing hpa hsaing (; lit. mother's side, father's side) from one\nor both parents' side to worship depending on where their families originally\ncome from. One also has a personal guardian spirit called ko saung nat ().\n","linknr":350,"url":"Nat_(spirit)","recorded":1362539225,"links":28,"instances":["buddhism","nat","buddhism"],"pdf":["http://www.dhammaweb.net/books/Cult_in_Burmese_Religion.pdf","http://www.dhammaweb.net/books/Cult_in_Burmese_Religion.pdf"],"categories":["Burmese nats|*","Religion in Burma","Buddhism in Burma","Burmese words and phrases"],"headings":["Nat worship and Buddhism","Nat worship and ecology","Popular nat festivals","List of official nats","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/10/Burmese_character_k.svg/40px-Burmese_character_k.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Nat_oun.JPG/220px-Nat_oun.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/Nat_Pwe.JPG/220px-Nat_Pwe.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/Distant_Popa.JPG/220px-Distant_Popa.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/76/Mount_Popa.JPG/220px-Mount_Popa.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/93/Offerings_of_alcohol_to_Burmese_nat.jpg/220px-Offerings_of_alcohol_to_Burmese_nat.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/IMG_banana-offering.JPG/220px-IMG_banana-offering.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/Brother_Nats.JPG/220px-Brother_Nats.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["deva","buddhism"],["śakra","buddhism"],["shingon","nat"]],"members":["deva","shingon","śakra"],"related":["Burma","Buddhism","Deva_(Buddhism)","Sainthood","Ethnic_minorities","Bamar","Anawrahta","Bagan","Ayeyarwady_Region","Kyaukpadaung","Mount_Popa","Bagan","Mandalay","Amarapura","Transgender","Transvestites","Palm_wine","Shwe_Hpyin_Nyidaw","Anawrahta","Shwezigon_Pagoda","Śakra_(Buddhism)","History_of_Burma","Thailand","Shan_state","Thagyamin","Mahagiri","Hnamadawgyi","Shwe_Nabay","Thonbanhla","Taungoo_Mingaung","Mintara","Thandawgan","Shwe_Nawrahta","Aungzwamagyi","Kyawswa_I_of_Pinya","Aung_Pinle_Hsinbyushin","Taungmagyi","Maungminshin","Shindaw","Nyaunggyin","Tabinshwehti","Minye_Aungdin","Shwe_Sitthin","Medaw_Shwezaga","Maung_Po_Tu","Yun_Bayin","Maung_Minbyu","Mandalay_Bodaw","Shwe_Hpyin_Naungdaw","Shwe_Hpyin_Nyidaw","Mintha_Maungshin","Htibyuhsaung","Htibyuhsaung_Medaw","Pareinma_Shin_Mingaung","Min_Sithu","Min_Kyawzwa","Myaukhpet_Shinma","Anauk_Mibaya","Shingon_(nat)","Shingwa","Shin_Nemi","Hungry_ghost","Lên_đồng","Preta","YouTube","Michigan_State_University","Flickr","Flickr"]}
