He was also the first to build a successful human-carrying\n| glider. Cayley described many of the concepts and elements of the modern\n| aeroplane and was the first to understand and explain in engineering terms the\n| concepts of lift and thrust.}} In 1799 he set forth the concept of the\n| modern aeroplane as a fixed-wing flying machine with separate systems for\n| lift, propulsion, and control. {{cite web title = Aviation History url =\n| http://www.aviation-history.com/early/cayley.htm publisher = accessdate =26\n| July 2009 quote = 'In 1799 he set forth for the first time in history the\n| concept of the modern aeroplane'.

Cayley established the\n| modern configuration of an aeroplane as a fixed-wing flying machine with\n| separate systems for lift, propulsion, and control as early as 1799.\n}} He was a pioneer of aeronautical engineering and is sometimes referred\nto as \"the father of aerodynamics.\" Designer of the first successful glider to\ncarry a human being aloft, he discovered and identified the four aerodynamic\nforces of flight: weight, lift, drag, and thrust, which act on any flying\nvehicle. Modern aeroplane design is based on those discoveries including\ncambered wings. He is credited with the first major breakthrough in heavier-than-\nair flight and he worked over half a century before the development of powered\nflight, being acknowledged by the Wright brothers. Dee, Richard.\n[http://www.richarddee.net/image_gallery_7.html] Retrieved: 30 May 2010.\nHe designed the first actual model of an aeroplane and also diagrammed the\nelements of vertical flight. {{cite web\n| title = U.S Centennial of Flight Commission. url =\n| http://www.centennialofflight.gov/essay/Dictionary/Cayley/DI15.htm publisher =\n| accessdate =10 September 2008 quote = He established the scientific principles\n| for heavier-than-air flight and used glider models for his research.

He was a founding member of the British\nAssociation for the Advancement of Science and was a distant cousin of the\nmathematician Arthur Cayley.\n","linknr":324,"url":"Sir_George_Cayley's_coachman","recorded":1374761544,"links":["/w/index.php?title=George_Cayley&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=George_Cayley&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","/wiki/George_Cayley","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","/w/index.php?title=Sir_George_Cayley%27s_coachman&redirect=no","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Cayley_baronets","/wiki/File:George_Cayley.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d7/George_Cayley.jpg/200px-George_Cayley.jpg","/wiki/Scarborough,_England","/wiki/Yorkshire","/wiki/Brompton,_Scarborough","/wiki/British_people","/wiki/Aviation","/wiki/Aerodynamics","/wiki/Aeronautics","/wiki/Aeronautical_engineering","/wiki/Aerodynamic","/wiki/Weight","/wiki/Lift_(force)","/wiki/Drag_(physics)","/wiki/Thrust","/wiki/Camber_(aerodynamics)","/wiki/English_people","/wiki/Engineer","/wiki/Aeronautics","#cite_note-1","#cite_note-ctie-2","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Fixed-wing_aircraft","#cite_note-4","#cite_note-5","/wiki/Aeronautical_engineering","/wiki/Aerodynamics","/wiki/Weight","/wiki/Lift_(force)","/wiki/Drag_(physics)","/wiki/Thrust","/wiki/Camber_(aerodynamics)","/wiki/Wright_brothers","#cite_note-ctie-2","#cite_note-deeWright7-6","#cite_note-7","/wiki/File:Cayley_Glider_Replica_Flown_By_Derek_Piggott_2.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c2/Cayley_Glider_Replica_Flown_By_Derek_Piggott_2.jpg/220px-Cayley_Glider_Replica_Flown_By_Derek_Piggott_2.jpg","/wiki/File:Cayley_Glider_Replica_Flown_By_Derek_Piggott_2.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/British_Whig_Party","/wiki/Member_of_Parliament","/wiki/Scarborough_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/University_of_Westminster","/wiki/British_Association_for_the_Advancement_of_Science","/wiki/Mathematics","/wiki/Arthur_Cayley","#General_engineering_projects","#Flying_machines","#Memorial","#See_also","#Notes","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=George_Cayley&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Brompton,_Scarborough","/wiki/Scarborough,_North_Yorkshire","/wiki/Yorkshire","/wiki/Engineering","/wiki/Lifeboat_(rescue)","/wiki/Wire_wheels","#cite_note-8","/wiki/Caterpillar_track","#cite_note-9","#cite_note-10","/wiki/Seat_belt","/wiki/Helicopter","/wiki/Internal_combustion_engine","/wiki/Gunpowder","/wiki/Prosthetic","/wiki/Hot_air_engine","/wiki/Electricity","/wiki/Theatre","/wiki/Architecture","/wiki/Ballistics","/wiki/Optics","/wiki/Land_reclamation","#cite_note-ackroyd-11","/w/index.php?title=George_Cayley&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/File:Governableparachute.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3d/Governableparachute.jpg/170px-Governableparachute.jpg","/wiki/File:Governableparachute.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/File:George_Cayley_Glider_(Nigel_Coates).jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/George_Cayley_Glider_%28Nigel_Coates%29.jpg/220px-George_Cayley_Glider_%28Nigel_Coates%29.jpg","/wiki/File:George_Cayley_Glider_(Nigel_Coates).jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Flying_machine","/wiki/Glider_aircraft","#cite_note-AerNav123-12","/wiki/William_Nicholson_(chemist)","/wiki/Royal_Aeronautical_Society","#cite_note-13","/wiki/Camber_(aerodynamics)","/wiki/Airfoil","/wiki/Dihedral_(aircraft)","/wiki/Centre_of_gravity","/wiki/Hang_gliders","/wiki/Aerospace_engineer","/wiki/Compression_(physical)","/wiki/Tension_(physics)","#cite_note-FG54-14","/wiki/Wire_wheels","/wiki/Horizontal_stabiliser","/wiki/Vertical_stabilizer","/wiki/Centre_of_gravity","#cite_note-15","/wiki/Charles_Harvard_Gibbs-Smith","/wiki/Derek_Piggott","#cite_note-glidmag1-16","#cite_note-glidmag2-17","/wiki/IMAX","/wiki/On_the_Wing_(1986_film)","/wiki/Yorkshire_Air_Museum","#cite_note-Yorkshire_Air_Museum-18","#cite_note-virCay-19","/wiki/Salina,_Kansas","/wiki/Steve_Fossett","/wiki/Virgin_Atlantic_GlobalFlyer","/wiki/Richard_Branson","#cite_note-popmecCay-20","/w/index.php?title=George_Cayley&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/University_of_Hull,_Scarborough_Campus","/wiki/Hall_of_residence","/wiki/Loughborough_University","/wiki/University_of_Westminster","/wiki/Regent_Street","/wiki/Royal_Air_Force_Museum_L
