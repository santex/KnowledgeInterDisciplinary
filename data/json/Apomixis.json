{"cursor":"16942","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nIn botany, 'apomixis' was defined by Hans Winkler as replacement of the normal\nsexual reproduction by asexual reproduction, without fertilization.\nThis definition notably does not mention meiosis. Thus \"normal asexual\nreproduction\" of plants, such as propagation from cuttings or leaves, has never\nbeen considered to be apomixis, but replacement of the seed by a plantlet, or\nreplacement of the flower by bulbils are types of apomixis. Apomictically\nproduced offspring are genetically identical to the parent plant.\n\nIn flowering plants, the term \"apomixis\" is commonly used in a restricted sense\nto mean 'agamospermy', i.e. asexual reproduction through seeds.\n\n'Apogamy' is a related term that has had various meanings over time. In plants\nwith independent gametophytes (notably ferns), the term is still used\ninterchangeably with \"apomixis\", and both refer to the formation of sporophytes\nby parthenogenesis of gametophyte cells.\n\n'Male apomixis' ('paternal apomixis') involves replacement of the genetic\nmaterial of the egg cell by that from the pollen.\n","linknr":274,"url":"Apomixis","recorded":1362480618,"links":37,"instances":["publication","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Plant reproduction"],"headings":["Apomixis and evolution","Apomixis in non-flowering plants","Apomixis in flowering plants (angiosperms)","Some terms related to apomixis","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg/20px-Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/6c/Wiki_letter_w.svg/23px-Wiki_letter_w.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/Poa_bulbosa%2C_vegetative_apomixis.jpg/220px-Poa_bulbosa%2C_vegetative_apomixis.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/Agave_angustifolia_%28Caribbean_Agave%29_in_Hyderabad_W_IMG_8660.jpg/220px-Agave_angustifolia_%28Caribbean_Agave%29_in_Hyderabad_W_IMG_8660.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["flora","publication"],["family","biology"]],"members":["flora","family"],"related":["Botany","Hans_Winkler","Asexual_reproduction","Meiosis","Plantlet","Bulbils","Seeds","Gametophyte","Sporophyte","Parthenogenesis","Species","Genus","Flora_(publication)","Bramble","Family_(biology)","Asteraceae","Poaceae","Rosaceae","Rowan","Whitebeam","Meadow_grass","Hawkweed","Dandelion","Evolution","Sexual_reproduction","Eloquence","Henry_Ford","Hierarchy","Zoology","Embryo","Parthenogenesis","Gametophyte","Meiosis","Nucellus","Nucellar_embryony","Bulbil","Megagametophyte","Chromosomes","Meiosis","Archesporium","Nucellus","Nucellar_embryony","Ovule","Bulbils","Parthenogenesis","Endosperm","Archesporium","Megaspore_mother_cell","Photoperiodism","Haploid","Monoploid","Meiosis","Anther","Microspores","Pollination","Endosperm","Embryo","GÃ¶te_Turesson","Cytomixis","Klepton","Meiosis","Parthenocarpy","Parthenogenesis","Animal","Plant_sexuality"]}
