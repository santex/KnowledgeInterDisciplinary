{"cursor":"33899","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":", in 1864.]] A 'centenarian' is a person who lives to or beyond the age of 100\nyears. Because current average global life expectancies are less than 100, the\nterm is invariably associated with longevity. A supercentenarian is a person who\nhas lived to the age of 110 or more, something only achieved by about one in\n1,000 centenarians. Even rarer is a person who has lived to age 115 â , there\nare only 29 people in recorded history who have indisputably reached this age,\nof whom only Jiroemon Kimura is still currently\nliving. In 2009, the United Nations estimated\nthat there were 455,000 living centenarians worldwide;\nhowever, in 2012, this estimate was reduced to 316,600.\n","linknr":593,"url":"Centenarian","recorded":1362373548,"links":49,"instances":["nutrition"],"pdf":["http://www.soa.org/library/journals/north-american-actuarial-journal/2002/july/naaj0207_6.pdf","http://www.soa.org/library/journals/north-american-actuarial-journal/2002/july/naaj0207_6.pdf","http://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/WPA2009/WPA2009-report.pdf","http://www.unfpa.org/webdav/site/global/shared/documents/publications/2012/UNFPA-Report-Chapter1.pdf","http://www.unfpa.org/webdav/site/global/shared/documents/publications/2012/UNFPA-Report-Chapter1.pdf","http://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/reports/c2010sr-03.pdf","http://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/reports/c2010sr-03.pdf","http://www.okicent.org/docs/age_validation_in_okinawa_jgbs_2008.pdf","http://www.avmaroc.com/pdf/centenaires-japon-actualite-a140600-d.pdf","http://www.imsersomayores.csic.es/documentos/documentos/proyectomeri-italia-01.pdf","http://www.erudit.org/revue/cqd/2004/v33/n1/010852ar.pdf","http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/dcp171778_235000.pdf","http://www.statistics.gov.uk/pdfdir/agenr0910.pdf","http://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/reports/c2010sr-03.pdf","http://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/reports/c2010sr-03.pdf","http://www.census.gov/prod/99pubs/p23-199.pdf","http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/course/98-030/hist1.pdf","http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/course/98-030/hist1.pdf","http://www.actabp.pl/pdf/2_2000/281.pdf","http://www.actabp.pl/pdf/2_2000/281.pdf"],"categories":["Lists of people by age|*Centenarians","Centenarians|","Aging","Senescence"],"headings":["Current incidence","Traditions","Centenarians in ancient times","Research into centenarians","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/86/SamuelDowning.jpg/170px-SamuelDowning.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/43/Muriel_Duckworth.jpg/170px-Muriel_Duckworth.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/MosulChaldean107yrs.jpg/220px-MosulChaldean107yrs.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["diet","nutrition"]],"members":["diet"],"related":["Life_expectancy","Longevity","Supercentenarian","List_of_the_verified_oldest_people","Jiroemon_Kimura","United_Nations","Muriel_Duckworth","United_States","2010_United_States_Census_","Japan","United_Nations","Diet_(nutrition)","Shimane_Prefecture","Okinawa_Prefecture","Xinhua","Mayotte","President_of_the_United_States","NBC","Commonwealth_Realms","List_of_British_monarchs","Telegram","President_of_Ireland","Irish_diaspora","Prime_Minister_of_Japan","Telegram","Monarchy_of_Sweden","President_of_Italy","Respect_for_the_Aged_Day","Blessing","Hindu","Judaism","Ten_thousand_years","Augury","Ancient_Greece","Mediterranean_diet","Diogenes_Laertius","Hipparchus","Democritus_of_Abdera","Xenophanes_of_Colophon","Pyrrho","Eratosthenes","Epimenides","Sixth_dynasty_of_Egypt","Pepi_II","Hosius_of_Córdoba","Constantine_the_Great","First_Council_of_Nicaea","Bernold_of_Constance","Vitamin_A","Vitamin_E","Sardinia","Upper_Silesia","Glutathione_reductase","Catalase","Vitamin_E","Glutathione_reductase","Enzyme","B_cell","FOXO3","Eunuchs","Tokyo","Lists_of_centenarians","New_England_Centenarian_Study","Okinawa_Centenarian_Study","Oldest_people","Queensland_Community_Care_Network"]}
