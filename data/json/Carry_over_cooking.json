{"cursor":"1557","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Carry over cooking' refers to the phenomenon that food retains heat and\ncontinues to cook even after being removed from the source of heat. The larger and denser the object being heated the greater\nthe amount of carry over cooking. After being removed from the heat source\n(oven, barbecue grill, etc.) the internal temperature can continue to increase.\nThis means that when cooking large roasts or turkeys, for instance, the roast\nmeat should be rested before serving to allow heat to distribute from the warmer\noutside to the cooler middle, also allowing juices to distribute throughout the\nmeat.\n","linknr":96,"url":"Carry_over_cooking","recorded":1362667063,"links":13,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Cooking techniques"],"headings":["Physics","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c1/Bolognese_pot.jpg/40px-Bolognese_pot.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Heat","Cooking","Oven","Barbecue_grill","Temperature","Roast","Turkey","Surface_area_to_volume_ratio","Water_content","Water","Heat_capacity"]}
