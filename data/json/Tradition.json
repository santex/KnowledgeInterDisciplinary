{"cursor":"36887","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\nA 'tradition' is a belief or behavior passed down within a group or society with\nsymbolic meaning or special significance with origins in the past. Common examples include\nholidays or impractical but socially meaningful clothes (like lawyer wigs or\nmilitary officer spurs), but the idea has also been applied to social norms such\nas greetings. Traditions can persist and evolve for thousands of yearsâthe word\n\"tradition\" itself derives from the Latin tradere or traderer literally meaning\nto transmit, to hand over, to give for safekeeping. While it is commonly assumed\nthat traditions have ancient history, many traditions have been invented on\npurpose, whether that be political or cultural, over short periods of time.\nCertain scholarly fields, such as anthropology and biology, have adapted the\nterm \"tradition,\" defining it more precisely than its conventional use in order\nto facilitate scholarly discourse.\n\nThe concept of tradition, as the notion of holding on to a previous time, is\nalso found in political and philosophical discourse. For example, the political\nconcept of traditionalism is based around it, as are strands of many world\nreligions including traditional Catholicism. In artistic contexts, tradition is\nused to decide the correct display of an art form. For example, in the\nperformance of traditional genres (such as traditional dance), adherence to\nguidelines dictating how an art form should be composed are given greater\nimportance than the performer's own preferences. A number of factors can\nexacerbate the loss of tradition, including industrialization, globalization,\nand the assimilation or marginalization of specific cultural groups. In response\nto this, tradition-preservation attempts have now been started in many countries\naround the world, focusing on aspects such as traditional languages. Tradition\nis usually contrasted with the goal of modernity and should be differentiated\nfrom customs, conventions, laws, norms, routines, rules and similar concepts.\n","linknr":639,"url":"Tradition","recorded":1362485190,"links":76,"instances":["political","history","architecture","religion"],"pdf":["http://www.bunka.go.jp/bunkazai/pamphlet/pdf/pamphlet_en_03.pdf","http://www.bunka.go.jp/bunkazai/pamphlet/pdf/pamphlet_en_03.pdf"],"categories":["Traditions|","Social philosophy","Political culture"],"headings":["Definition of tradition","Invention of tradition","In scholarly discourse","In political and religious discourse","In artistic discourse","Relationship to other concepts","Preservation of tradition","See also","References","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/db/Wigilia_potrawy_76.jpg/220px-Wigilia_potrawy_76.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/26/Tradition-Warner-Highsmith.jpeg/300px-Tradition-Warner-Highsmith.jpeg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["traditionalism","religion"],["tympanum","architecture"],["progress","history"],["traditionalism","religion"],["legitimacy","political"]],"members":["legitimacy","progress","tympanum","traditionalism"],"related":["Belief","Spur","Latin","Anthropology","Biology","Traditionalist_conservatism","Traditionalism_(religion)","Traditional_Catholicism","Modernity","Tympanum_(architecture)","Thomas_Jefferson_Building","Latin","Roman_law","Inheritance","Anthony_Giddens","Age_of_Enlightenment","Progress_(history)","Prehistory","Arcane","Writing_system","Figures_of_speech","Rhyme","Alliteration","Oral_tradition","Ancient","Generation","National_anthem","Public_holiday","Federal_holidays_in_the_United_States","Religious_denomination","Local_church","Traditionalism_(religion)","Social_interaction","Greeting_card","Picnic","Monotheism","Citizenship","Adjective","Traditional_music","Traditional_medicine","Traditional_values","Invented_traditions","E._J._Hobsbawm","Wedding_dress","Queen_Victoria","Albert_of_Saxe-Coburg","Palace_of_Westminster","British_Parliament","Monarchy_of_the_United_Kingdom","Terence_Ranger","Legitimacy_(political)","National_dish","Expatriate","Myth","Thomas_Kuhn","Social_sciences","Archeology","Psychology","Sociology","Edward_Shils","Pascal_Boyer","Archaeology","Archaeological_culture","Archaeological_industry","American_archaeology","Musicology","Ethnomusicology","Traditional_society","Industrial_society","Max_Weber","Traditional_authority","Rational-legal_authority","Rationality","Division_of_labor","Autarky","Unilineal_evolution","Raymond_Boudon","Appeal_to_tradition","Martin_Heidegger","Plato","Aristotle","Hans-Georg_Gadamer","Aristotelianism","Alasdair_MacIntyre","Aristotelianism","Traditionalist_Catholic","Marcel_Lefebvre","Second_Vatican_Council","Sunni_Islam","Muhammad","Political_spectrum","Right-wing_politics","Left-wing_politics","Natural_law","Hierarchy","Organic_unity","Agrarianism","Classicism","High_culture","Individualism","Social_progress","Feminism","Othering","Traditional_dance","Folk_art","Fine_art","Filial_piety","Interdependence","Ideology","Spur","Globalization","Cultural_assimilation","Marginalization","Cornish_language","European_Charter_for_Regional_or_Minority_Languages","UNESCO","Japan","Agency_for_Cultural_Affairs","Living_National_Treasure","Māori_people","Aition","Folklore","Perennial_philosophy","Ševčenko's_law","E._J._Hobsbawm"]}
