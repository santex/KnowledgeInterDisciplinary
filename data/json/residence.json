Architecturally, a\nresidence is typically a house, mansion, cottage or even grand castles and\npalaces. A residence is offered to travelers as temporary lodgings where they\ncan rent a room. The rooms are generally furnished in the style which\ncomplements the architecture type of the building. This boutique type of\naccommodation has a nice homely feel where the traveler is the 'house-guest'.\nHotels, especially the extended stay chains, commonly function as residences for\nmany guests.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/6990706.stm\n'&#39;Home Suite Home'&#39;&nbsp;–].
