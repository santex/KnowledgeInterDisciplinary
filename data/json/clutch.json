      "text" : "\n\n\n hub is attached to the disc with springs to damp chatter.]] A 'clutch' is a\n mechanical device that provides for the transmission of power (and therefore\n usually motion) from one component (the driving member) to another (the driven\n member) when engaged, but can be disengaged.\n\nClutches are used whenever the transmission of power or motion must be\ncontrolled either in amount or over time (e.g., electric screwdrivers limit how\nmuch torque is transmitted through use of a clutch; clutches control whether\nautomobiles transmit engine power to the wheels).\n\nIn the simplest application, clutches connect and disconnect two rotating shafts\n(drive shafts or line shafts). In these devices, one shaft is typically attached\nto a motor or other power unit (the driving member) while the other shaft (the\ndriven member) provides output power for work.\n\nIn a torque-controlled drill, for instance, one shaft is driven by a motor and\nthe other drives a drill chuck. The clutch connects the two shafts so that they\nmay be locked together and spin at the same speed (engaged), locked together but\nspinning at different speeds (slipping), or unlocked and spinning at different\nspeeds (disengaged).\n",
