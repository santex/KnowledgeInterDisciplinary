The first techniques for rapid prototyping became available in the\nlate 1980s and were used to produce models and prototype parts. Today, they are\nused for a much wider range of applications and are even used to manufacture production-\nquality parts in relatively small numbers. Some sculptors use the technology to\nproduce exhibitions.\n","linknr":142,"url":"Rapid_prototyping","recorded":1362374828,"links":34,"instances":["metalworking","physical"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Product management","3D printing","Robotics"],"headings":["See also","References","Bibliography","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d8/3dprinter.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/Rapid_prototyping_slicing.jpg/220px-Rapid_prototyping_slicing.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["model","physical"],["cladding","metalworking"]],"members":["cladding","model"],"related":["Computer_aided_design","3D_printing","Model_(physical)","Prototype","Manufacture","Sculptor","Exhibition","3D_Printing","Fab_lab","Laser_engineered_net_shaping","Cladding_(metalworking)","MeshLab","RepRap","Rapid_Brand_Prototyping","Von_Neumann_universal_constructor"]}
