The series of eight\ncomputers was aimed at the business, research and further education markets.\nHowever, the ABC range was cancelled before any of the models were shipped to\ncustomers. The ABC 210 was subsequently relaunched as the 'Acorn Cambridge\nWorkstation', sold in modest numbers to academic and scientific users.\n\nThe ABC range was developed by Acorn essentially as a repackaged BBC Micro,\nexpanded to 64 kB RAM, to which was added (in some models) a second processor\nand extra memory to complement the Micro's 6502. The electronics and disk drives\nwere integrated into the monitor housing, with a separate keyboard.\n\nThe Zilog Z80, Intel 80286 and National Semiconductor 32016 were all used as second processors in the various models. Two of\nthe eight models produced, the Personal Assistant and the Terminal, had no\nsecond processor. http://www.computinghistory.org.uk/det/11871/Acorn-Business-\nComputer-(ABC)/\n","linknr":225,"url":"Acorn_Business_Computer","recorded":1362581109,"links":13,"instances":["operating_system"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Acorn Computers|Business Computer"],"headings":["Range and specifications","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/AcornBusinessComputer210.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["panos","operating_system"],["panos","operating_system"]],"members":["panos"],"related":["Acorn_Computers","Acorn_Computers","Panos_(operating_system)","Concurrent_DOS","MOS_Technology_6502","Zilog_Z80","32016","80286","BBC_Micro","Acorn_Archimedes","Microcomputers","United_Kingdom","Acorn_Computers_Ltd","BBC_Micro","MOS_Technology_6502","Disk_drive","Zilog_Z80","Intel_80286","National_Semiconductor_32016","Kilobyte","Random_Access_Memory","Floppy_disk","MOS_Technology_6502","Megahertz","MHz","RAM","Computer_bus","Acornsoft_ViewSheet","Kilobyte","Random_Access_Memory","MOS_Technology_6502","MHz","RAM","Computer_bus","VT100","Emulator","Kilobyte","Random_Access_Memory","Zilog_Z80","MOS_Technology_6502","Operating_system","Kilobyte","Random_Access_Memory","Megabyte","Hard_drive","Zilog_Z80","MOS_Technology_6502","Operating_system","Kilobyte","Random_Access_Memory","RAM","Computer_bus","32016","MOS_Technology_6502","Kilobyte","Random_Access_Memory","MHz","RAM","Hard_disk","32016","MOS_Technology_6502","Firmware","Xenix","Panos_(operating_system)","Kilobyte","Random_Access_Memory","80286","MOS_Technology_6502","Concurrent_DOS","GEM_windowing_system","Kilobyte","Random_Access_Memory","Hard_disk","80286","MOS_Technology_6502","Concurrent_DOS","GEM_windowing_system","Personal_Computer_World"]}
