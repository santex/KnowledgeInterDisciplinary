He was of distinguished parentage. Little is known about his early life\nand education, but he regarded himself as self-taught and a pioneer of wisdom.\nFrom the lonely life he led, and still more from the riddling nature of his\nphilosophy and his contempt for humankind in general, he was called \"The\nObscure\" and the \"Weeping Philosopher\".\n\nHeraclitus is famous for his insistence on ever-present change in the universe,\nas stated in the famous saying, \"No man ever steps in the same river\ntwice\" This is how Plato puts Heraclitus' doctrine. See Cratylus,\n402a. (see panta rhei, below). He believed in the unity of opposites,\nstating that \"the path up and down are one and the same\", all existing entities\nbeing characterized by pairs of contrary properties. His cryptic utterance that\n\"all entities come to be in accordance with this [[Logos]]\" (literally, \"word\",\n\"reason\", or \"account\") has been the subject of numerous interpretations.\n","linknr":1243,"url":"Heraclitus","recorded":1362485219,"links":102,"instances":["aristotle","classicist","dialogue","mythology","online_magazine","philosophy","phonetics"],"pdf":["http://community.middlebury.edu/~harris/Philosophy/heraclitus.pdf","http://community.middlebury.edu/~harris/Philosophy/heraclitus.pdf"],"categories":["535
