This requires the heart to work harder\nthan normal to circulate blood through the blood vessels. Blood pressure is\nsummarised by two measurements, systolic and diastolic, which depend on whether\nthe heart muscle is contracting (systole) or relaxed between beats (diastole).\nNormal blood pressure at rest is within the range of 100-140mmHg systolic (top\nreading) and 60-90mmHg diastolic (bottom reading). High blood pressure is said\nto be present if it is persistently at or above 140/90 mmHg.\n\nHypertension is classified as either primary (essential) hypertension or\nsecondary hypertension; about 90â95% of cases are categorized as \"primary\nhypertension\" which means high blood pressure with no obvious underlying medical\ncause. The remaining 5â10% of cases (secondary\nhypertension) are caused by other conditions that affect the kidneys, arteries,\nheart or endocrine system.\n\nHypertension is a major risk factor for stroke, myocardial infarction (heart\nattacks), heart failure, aneurysms of the arteries (e.g. aortic aneurysm),\nperipheral arterial disease and is a cause of chronic kidney disease. Even\nmoderate elevation of arterial blood pressure is associated with a shortened\nlife expectancy. Dietary and lifestyle changes can improve blood pressure\ncontrol and decrease the risk of associated health complications, although drug\ntreatment is often necessary in people for whom lifestyle changes prove\nineffective or insufficient.\n","linknr":1390,"url":"Hypertension","recorded":1362511121,"links":103,"instances":["medicine","medicine","unit","physician","primary_hypertension","cardiology","scientist","medical","medicine"],"pdf":["http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/live/13561/56007/56007.pdf","http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/live/13561/56007/56007.pdf","http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/public/heart/hbp/dash/new_dash.pdf","http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/public/heart/hbp/dash/new_dash.pdf","http://www.hta.ac.uk/fullmono/mon731.pdf","http://www.hta.ac.uk/fullmono/mon731.pdf","http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/pdf/cg034quickrefguide.pdf","http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/pdf/cg034quickrefguide.pdf","http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/GlobalHealthRisks_report_full.pdf","http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/GlobalHealthRisks_report_full.pdf"],"categories":["Hypertension|","Blood
