DVDs offer higher storage capacity than\nCompact Discs while having the same dimensions.\n\nPre-recorded DVDs are mass-produced using molding machines that physically stamp\ndata onto the DVD. Such discs are known as DVD-ROM, because data can only be\nread and not written nor erased. Blank recordable DVD discs (DVD-R and DVD+R)\ncan be recorded once using a DVD recorder and then function as a DVD-ROM.\nRewritable DVDs (DVD-RW, DVD+RW, and DVD-RAM) can be recorded and erased\nmultiple times.\n\nDVDs are used in DVD-Video consumer digital video format and in DVD-Audio\nconsumer digital audio format, as well as for authoring AVCHD discs. DVDs\ncontaining other types of information may be referred to as DVD data
