The two lower frames and the main frame all show superior mirages\n  of the Farallon Islands. In these three frames, the superior mirage evolves\n  from a 3-image mirage (an inverted image between two erect ones) to a 5-image\n  mirage, and then back to a 2-image mirage. Such a display is consistent with a\n  Fata Morgana. All frames but the upper one were photographed from about 50â70\n  feet above sea level. The upper frame was photographed from sea level.]] A\n  'mirage' is a naturally occurring optical phenomenon in which light rays are\n  bent to produce a displaced image of distant objects or the sky. The word\n  comes to English via the French mirage, from the Latin mirari, meaning \"to\n  look at, to wonder at\". This is the same root as for \"mirror\" and \"to admire\".\n\nIn contrast to a hallucination, a mirage is a real optical phenomenon which can\nbe captured on camera, since light rays actually are refracted to form the false\nimage at the observer's location. What the image appears to represent, however,\nis determined by the interpretive faculties of the human mind. For example,\ninferior images on land are very easily mistaken for the reflections from a\nsmall body of water.\n\nMirages can be categorized as \"inferior\" (meaning lower), \"superior\" (meaning\nhigher) and \"Fata Morgana\", one kind of superior mirage consisting of a series\nof unusually elaborate, vertically stacked images, which form one rapidly\nchanging mirage.\n","linknr":276,"url":"Mirage","recorded":1362372261,"links":60,"instances":["mathematics","mirage","geometry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Atmospheric optical phenomena"],"headings":["Cause","Inferior mirage","Superior mirage","Night-time mirages","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e9/Farallon_Islands_at_inferior_mirage_no_mirage_and_superior_mirage.jpg/350px-Farallon_Islands_at_inferior_mirage_no_mirage_and_superior_mirage.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7c/Desertmirage.jpg/220px-Desertmirage.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/Swiss_F-5E_at_Fairford.JPG/220px-Swiss_F-5E_at_Fairford.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7b/Hot_road_mirage.jpg/220px-Hot_road_mirage.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/Superior_mirage_of_Point_Reyes_from_SF_.jpg/220px-Superior_mirage_of_Point_Reyes_from_SF_.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/34/Cat_Mirage.jpg/220px-Cat_Mirage.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/95/Farallons_islands_miragep.jpg/220px-Farallons_islands_miragep.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["fata_morgana","mirage"],["fata_morgana","mirage"],["magnitude","mathematics"],["fata_morgana","mirage"],["arc","geometry"]],"members":["magnitude","fata_morgana","arc"],"related":["Green_flash","Fata_Morgana_(mirage)","Optical_phenomenon","French_language","Latin","Mirror","Hallucination","Fata_Morgana_(mirage)","Refractive_index","Gradient","Earth's_atmosphere","Celsius","Metre","Temperature_gradient","Marcel_Minnaert","Magnitude_(mathematics)","Sand","Asphalt_concrete","Desert","Density","Asphalt","Jet_engine","Convection","Gradient_index_optics","Telescope","Telephoto_lens","Sky","Refraction","Tarmac","Haze","Temperature_inversion","Polar_region","Fata_Morgana_(mirage)","Icelandic_language","Curvature","Willem_Barents","Northeast_passage","Novaya_Zemlya","Novaya_Zemlya_effect","Looming,_Towering,_Stooping,_and_Sinking","San_Francisco","Morgan_le_Fay","Polar_region","Temperature_inversion","Earth","Arc_(geometry)","Atmospheric_duct","Altitude","Earth","Atmosphere","Farallon_Islands","Horizon","Sunset","Temperature_inversion","Optical_phenomenon","Astronomical_object","Sun","Moon","Planet","Star","Comet","Sunset","Sunrise","Atmospheric_refraction","Looming_and_similar_refraction_phenomena","Mirage_of_astronomical_objects","Novaya_Zemlya_effect","Refraction"]}
