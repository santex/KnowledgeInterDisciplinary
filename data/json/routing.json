Routing is performed for many kinds of networks, including the\ntelephone network (circuit switching), electronic data networks (such as the\nInternet), and transportation networks. This article is concerned primarily with\nrouting in electronic data networks using packet switching technology.\n\nIn packet switching networks, routing directs packet forwarding (the transit of\nlogically addressed packets from their source toward their ultimate destination)\nthrough intermediate nodes. Intermediate nodes are typically network hardware\ndevices such as routers, bridges, gateways, firewalls, or switches. General-\npurpose computers can also forward packets and perform routing, though they are\nnot specialized hardware and may suffer from limited performance. The routing\nprocess usually directs forwarding on the basis of routing tables which maintain\na record of the routes to various network destinations. Thus, constructing\nrouting tables, which are held in the router's memory, is very important for\nefficient routing. Most routing algorithms use only one network path at a time.\nMultipath routing techniques enable the use of multiple alternative paths.\n\nIn case of overlapping/equal routes, the following elements are considered in\norder to decide which routes get installed into the routing table (sorted by\npriority): #Prefix-Length: where longer subnet masks are preferred (independent\nif it is within a routing protocol or over different routing protocol) #Metric:\nwhere a lower metric/cost is preferred (only valid within one and the same\nrouting protocol)\n#[[Administrative Distance]]: where a lower distance is preferred (only valid\n#between different routing protocols)\n\nRouting, in a more narrow sense of the term, is often contrasted with bridging\nin its assumption that network addresses are structured and that similar\naddresses imply proximity within the network. Structured addresses allow a\nsingle routing table entry to represent the route to a group of devices. In\nlarge networks, structured addressing (routing, in the narrow sense) outperforms\nunstructured addressing (bridging). Routing has become the dominant form of\naddressing on the Internet. Bridging is still widely used within localized\nenvironments.\n","title":"routing","headings":["Delivery semantics","Topology distribution","Path selection","Multiple agents","Route analytics","See also","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["2: Multipath_routing","2: Static_routing","2: Routing_in_the_PSTN","2: Adaptive_routing","2: Routing_protocol","2: Dijkstra's_algorithm","2: Mobile_ad-hoc_network","2: NSDI","1: PSTN","1: Circuit_switching","1: Computer_network","1: Internet","1: Transport_network","1: Packet_switching","1: Packet_forwarding","1: Network_switch","1: Computer","1: Routing_table","1: Computer_storage","1: Network_address","1: Unicast","1: Multicast","1: Anycast","1: Geocast","1: Network_topology","1: Public_Switched_Telephone_Network","1: Routing_Information_Protocol","1: OSPF","1: Bellman-Ford","1: Map","1: Shortest_path_problem","1: Inter-domain","1: Network_delay","1: Hop_count","1: Link-state","1: Cisco","1: Administrative_distance","1: Nash_equilibrium","1: Braess_paradox","1: Automated_guided_vehicle","1: Internet_service_provider","1: Border_Gateway_Protocol","1: Jennifer_Rexford","1: Hot-potato_routing","1: New_York_City","1: Millisecond","1: London","1: SIGCOMM","1: Mission_critical","1: Route_analytics","1: Deflection_routing","1: Edge_Disjoint_Shortest_Pair_Algorithm","1: Fuzzy_routing","1: Geographic_routing","1: Heuristic_routing","1: Hierarchical_routing","1: IP_forwarding_algorithm","1: Overlay_network","1: Key-based_routing","1: Decentralized_object_location_and_routing","1: Distributed_hash_table","1: Path_computation_element","1: Policy-based_routing","1: Quality_of_Service","1: Open_Source_Routing_Machine","1: Route_assignment","1: Small_world_routing","1: Classless_inter-domain_routing","1: Multiprotocol_Label_Switching","1: Asynchronous_Transfer_Mode","1: RPSL","1: RSMLT","1: Optical_mesh_network","1: Peer-to-peer","1: Network_coding","1: GNU_Zebra","1: Iproute2","1: Bird_Internet_routing_daemon","1: Network_operating_system","1: XORP","1: FTOS","1: Junos","1: Cisco_IOS","1: NX-OS","1: CatOS"]}
