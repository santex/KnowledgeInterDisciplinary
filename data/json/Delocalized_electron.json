{"cursor":"4778","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":", with the delocalization of the electrons indicated by the circle.]]\n\nIn chemistry, 'delocalized electrons' are electrons in a molecule, ion or solid\nmetal that are not associated with a single atom or one covalent bond.\nIUPAC Gold Book [http://goldbook.iupac.org/D01583.html\ndelocalization] Delocalized electrons are contained within an orbital that\nextends over several adjacent atoms. Classically, delocalized electrons can be\nfound in conjugated systems and mesoionic compounds. It is increasingly\nappreciated that electrons in sigma bonding levels are also delocalized. For\nexample, in methane, the bonding electrons are shared by all five atoms equally.\nPervasive existence of delocalization is implicit in molecular orbital theory.\n","linknr":140,"url":"Delocalized_electron","recorded":1362375329,"links":23,"instances":["chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Chemical bonding","Electron states"],"headings":["Examples","Delocalization in reactions","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3f/Benz4.png/200px-Benz4.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["resonance","chemistry"]],"members":["resonance"],"related":["Electron","Electron","Molecule","Ion","Metal","Atom","Covalent_bond","Molecular_orbital","Conjugated_system","Mesoionic","Sigma_bonds","Methane","Molecular_orbital_theory","Simple_aromatic_ring","Benzene","Pi_bond","Valence_bond_theory","Resonance_(chemistry)","D_orbital","S_orbital","Ion","Cation","Electrical_conductivity","Diamond","Carbon","Graphite","Right_angle","Carboxylate","Conjugate_acid","Perchlorate","Electronegativity","Perchloric_acid","Friedelâ€“Crafts_reaction","Alkylation","Carbocation","Butyl","Hyperconjugation","Conjugated_system","Molecular_orbital","Aromatic_ring_current"]}
