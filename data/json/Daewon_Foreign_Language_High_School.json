Students choose one primary language as a major from\nChinese, French, Japanese, Spanish, or German to study during their three years\nat the school. Korean and English are mandatory subjects, regardless of which\nfocus language students choose when entering the school. There does exist,\nhowever, an English department with submajors in Spanish and Chinese.\n\nLike most schools in Korea, Daewon starts its school year in March, starts its\nsecond semester in September, and ends the school year in February. There is a\nweeklong spring break in mid-February.\n\nDaewon is one of the four schools run by the Daewon Education Foundation, all of\nwhich share a campus in Junggok-dong, Gwangjin-gu, Seoul.\n\nThe school's primary language of instruction is Korean.\n","linknr":241,"url":"Daewon_Foreign_Language_High_School","recorded":1364058770,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Daewon_Foreign_Language_High_School&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Daewon_Foreign_Language_High_School&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/File:Daewon_FLHS_Seal.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8c/Daewon_FLHS_Seal.png/250px-Daewon_FLHS_Seal.png","/wiki/Seoul","/wiki/Korea,_Republic_of","/wiki/Private_school","/wiki/Day_school","/wiki/City","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Wisteria","/wiki/Lilac","http://www.dwfl.hs.kr/","/wiki/Hangeul","/wiki/Hanja","/wiki/Seoul","/wiki/Korea,_Republic_of","/wiki/Chinese_language","/wiki/French_language","/wiki/Japanese_language","/wiki/Spanish_language","/wiki/German_language","/wiki/Korean_language","/wiki/English_language","/wiki/English_language","/wiki/Spanish_language","/wiki/Chinese_language","/w/index.php?title=Daewon_Education_Foundation&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Gwangjin-gu","/wiki/Seoul","#History","#Origins","#Admissions","#Faculty","#Academics","#Academic_tracks","#Korean_curriculum_track","#Global_Leadership_Program_.28GLP.29","#Campus_facilities","#Academic_facilities","#Athletic_and_multipurpose_facilities","#Other_facilities","#Student_life","#Dress_code","#Extracurricular_activities","#Partnerships","#References","/w/index.php?title=Daewon_Foreign_Language_High_School&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Daewon_Foreign_Language_High_School&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/File:Dr._Lee_Won_Hee,_Daewon.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/89/Dr._Lee_Won_Hee%2C_Daewon.jpg/260px-Dr._Lee_Won_Hee%2C_Daewon.jpg","/wiki/File:Dr._Lee_Won_Hee,_Daewon.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Samsung","/wiki/Cheil_Jedang","/wiki/Government_of_South_Korea","/w/index.php?title=Daewon_Girls%27_High_School&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/School_uniform","/w/index.php?title=Daewon_Foreign_Language_High_School&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/Government_of_South_Korea","/w/index.php?title=Middle_school_in_South_Korea&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/English_language","/wiki/English_language","/wiki/Government_of_South_Korea","/wiki/Seoul,_South_Korea","/wiki/Lee_Myung-bak","/wiki/TOEFL","/wiki/Golf","/w/index.php?title=Daewon_Foreign_Language_High_School&action=edit&section=4","/wiki/Harvard_University","/wiki/Princeton_University","/wiki/Johns_Hopkins_University","/wiki/University_of_Virginia","/wiki/Stanford_University","/wiki/Duke_University","/wiki/Cornell_University","/wiki/Columbia_University","/wiki/Williams_College","/wiki/University_of_Michigan","#cite_note-NYT-2","/w/index.php?title=Daewon_Foreign_Language_High_School&action=edit&section=5","/w/index.php?title=Daewon_Foreign_Language_High_School&action=edit&section=6","/wiki/Government_of_South_Korea","/wiki/English_language","/w/index.php?title=Daewon_Foreign_Language_High_School&action=edit&section=7","/wiki/Seoul_National_University","/wiki/Yonsei_University","/wiki/Korea_University","/wiki/SAT","/wiki/Extracurricular_activities","/wiki/Advanced_Placement","/w/index.php?title=Daewon_Foreign_Language_High_School&action=edit&section=8","/wiki/Mathematics","/wiki/Psychology","/wiki/International_Relations","/wiki/Philosophy","/wiki/Harvard_University","/wiki/Yale_University","/wiki/Princeton_University","/wiki/Cornell_University","/wiki/University_of_California","/wiki/Williams_College","/wiki/SAT_Reasoning_Test","/wiki/SAT_Subject_Tests","/wiki/SAT_Subject_Test_in_Mathematics_Level_2","/wiki/SAT_Subject_Test_in_Chemistry","#cite_note-WSJ-3","/w/index.php?title=Daewon_Foreign_Language_High_School&action=edit&section=9","/w/index.php?title=Daewon_Foreign_Language_High_School&action=edit&section=10","/wiki/Samsung_C%26T","/w/index.php?title=Daewon_International_Middle_School&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Daewon_Girls%27_High_School&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Daewon_Girls%27_High_School&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Daewon_International_Middle_School&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Daewon_Foreign_Language_High_School&action=edit&section=11","/w/index.php?title=Daewon_Girls%27_High_School&action=e
