{"cursor":"2401","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Budding' is a form of asexual reproduction in which a new organism develops\nfrom an outgrowth or bud on another one. The new organism remains attached as it\ngrows, separating from the parent organism only when it is mature. Since the\nreproduction is asexual, the newly created organism is a clone and is\ngenetically identical to the parent organism. Organisms such as hydra use\nregenerative cells for reproduction in the process of budding. In hydra, a bud\ndevelops as an outgrowth due to repeated cell division at one specific site.\nThese buds develop into tiny individuals and when fully mature, detach from the\nparent body and become new independent individuals.\n","linknr":134,"url":"Budding","recorded":1362373992,"links":37,"instances":["reproduction","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Reproduction","Plant reproduction"],"headings":["Animal reproduction","Cellular budding","Virology","Plant multiplication","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/Hydra_oligactis.jpg/220px-Hydra_oligactis.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d9/S_cerevisiae_under_DIC_microscopy.jpg/220px-S_cerevisiae_under_DIC_microscopy.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["fragmentation","reproduction"],["fission","biology"]],"members":["fragmentation","fission"],"related":["Asexual_reproduction","Metazoan","Coral","Sponge","Virology","Viral_shedding","Virus","Viral_envelope","Cell_membrane","Agriculture","Horticulture","Grafting","Bud","Fragmentation_(reproduction)","Paratomy","Fission_(biology)"]}
