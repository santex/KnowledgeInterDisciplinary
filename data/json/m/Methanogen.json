They are classified as archaea, a domain quite distinct\nfrom bacteria. They are common in wetlands, where they are responsible for marsh\ngas, and in the guts of animals such as ruminants and humans, where they are\nresponsible for the methane content of belching in ruminants and flatulence in\nhumans. {{cite book |author = Joseph W.
