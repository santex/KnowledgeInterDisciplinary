      "text" : "\n\n\n\nA 'planet' () is an astronomical object orbiting a star or stellar remnant that\nis massive enough to be rounded by its own gravity, is not massive enough to\ncause thermonuclear fusion, and has cleared its neighbouring region of\nplanetesimals.<ref group=lower-alpha name=footnoteA>This definition is drawn\nfrom two separate IAU declarations; a formal definition agreed by the IAU in\n2006, and an informal working definition established by the IAU in 2001/2003 for\nobjects outside of the Solar System. The 2006 definition, while official,\napplies only to the Solar System, while the 2003 definition applies to planets\naround other stars. The extrasolar planet issue was deemed too complex to\nresolve at the 2006 IAU conference.</ref><ref name=\"IAU\"></ref><ref\nname=\"WSGESP\"></ref> The term planet is ancient, with ties to history, science,\nmythology, and religion. The planets were originally seen by many early cultures\nas divine, or as emissaries of deities. As scientific knowledge advanced, human\nperception of the planets changed, incorporating a number of disparate objects.\nIn 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) officially adopted a\nresolution defining planets within the Solar System. This definition has been\nboth praised and criticized and remains disputed by some scientists because it\nexcludes many objects of planetary mass based on where or what they orbit. While\neight of the planetary bodies discovered before 1950 remain \"planets\" under the\nmodern definition, some celestial bodies, such as Ceres, Pallas, Juno, Vesta\n(each an object in the Solar asteroid belt), and Pluto (the first-discovered trans-\nNeptunian object), that were once considered planets by the scientific community\nare no longer viewed as such.\n\nThe planets were thought by Ptolemy to orbit the Earth in deferent and epicycle\nmotions. Although the idea that the planets orbited the Sun had been suggested\nmany times, it was not until the 17th century that this view was supported by\nevidence from the first telescopic astronomical observations, performed by\nGalileo Galilei. By careful analysis of the observation data, Johannes Kepler\nfound the planets' orbits were not circular but elliptical. As observational\ntools improved, astronomers saw that, like Earth, the planets rotated around\ntilted axes, and some shared such features as ice caps and seasons. Since the\ndawn of the Space Age, close observation by probes has found that Earth and the\nother planets share characteristics such as volcanism, hurricanes, tectonics,\nand even hydrology.\n\nPlanets are generally divided into two main types: large, low-density gas giants\nand smaller, rocky terrestrials. Under IAU definitions, there are eight planets\nin the Solar System. In order of increasing distance from the Sun, they are the\nfour terrestrials, Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars, then the four gas giants,\nJupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Six of the planets are orbited by one or\nmore natural satellites.\n\nAdditionally, the IAU accepts five dwarf planets,<ref>Ceres, Pluto (originally\nclassified as the Solar System's ninth planet), Makemake, Haumea and Eris</ref>\nwith many others under consideration,<ref>http://www.iau.org/public/pluto/</ref>\nand hundreds of thousands of small Solar System bodies.\n\nSince 1992, hundreds of planets around other stars (\"extrasolar planets\" or\n\"exoplanets\") in the Milky Way have been discovered. As of , known extrasolar\nplanets (in planetary systems and multiple planetary systems) are listed in the\nExtrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia, ranging in size from that of terrestrial\nplanets similar to Earth to that of gas giants larger than Jupiter.<ref\nname=\"Encyclopaedia\"></ref> On December 20, 2011, the Kepler Space Telescope\nteam reported the discovery of the first Earth-sized extrasolar planets, Kepler-\n20e<ref name=\"Kepler20e-20111220\"></ref> and Kepler-20f,<ref name=\"Kepler20f-\n20111220\"></ref> orbiting a Sun-like star, Kepler-20.<ref name=\"NASA-\n20111220\"></ref><ref name=\"Nature-20111220\"></ref><ref name=\"NYT-\n20111220\"></ref> A 2012 study, analyzing gravitational microlensing data,\nestimates an average of at least 1.6 bound planets for every star in the Milky\nWay.<ref></ref> Astronomers at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics\n(CfA) reported in January 2013 that \"at least 17 billion\" Earth-sized (i.e.\n0.8–1.25 Earth masses) exoplanets with orbital periods of 85 days or less are\nestimated to reside in the Milky Way Galaxy.<ref name=\"Space-20130107\"></ref>\n",
