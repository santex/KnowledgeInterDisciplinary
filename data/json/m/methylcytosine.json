When cytosine is methylated,\nthe DNA maintains the same sequence, but the expression of methylated genes can\nbe altered (the study of this is part of the field of epigenetics). 5-\nMethylcytosine is incorporated in the nucleoside 5-methylcytidine.\n\nIn 5-methylcytosine, a methyl group, is attached to the 5th atom in the 6-atom\nring (counting counterclockwise from the NH nitrogen at the six o'clock\nposition, not the 2 o'clock). This methyl group distinguishes 5-methylcytosine\nfrom cytosine.\n",
