Class\nMarattiopsida diverged from other ferns very early in their evolutionary history\nand are quite different from many plants familiar to people in temperate zones.\nMany of them have massive, fleshy rootstocks and the largest known fronds of any\nfern. The Marattiaceae is one of two groups of ferns traditionally known as\neusporangiate fern, C.Michael Hogan. 2010.\n[http://www.eoearth.org/article/Fern Fern. Encyclopedia of Earth. National\ncouncil for Science and the Environment]. Washington, DC meaning that the\nsporangium is formed from a group of cells vs the leptosporangium in which there\nis a single initial cell. There have long been four traditional extant genera\n([[Angiopteris]], [[Christensenia]], [[Danaea]] and [[Marattia]]), but recent\ngenetic/cladistic analysis  has determined the\ngenus Marattia to be paraphyletic, and the genus has been split into three\ngenera, the two new ones being [[Eupodium]] and [[Ptisana]]. This fern group has\na long fossil history with many extinct taxa ([[Psaronius]], [[Asterotheca]],\n[[Scolecopteris]], [[Eoangiopteris]], [[Qasimia]], [[Marantoidea]],\n[[Danaeites]], [[Marattiopsis]], etc.)\n\nIn this group, such fronds are found in the genus [[Angiopteris]], native to\nAustralasia, Madagascar and Oceania. These fronds may be up to 9 meters long in\nthe species [[Angiopteris teysmanniana]] of Java. In Jamaica the species\n[[Angiopteris evecta]] is widely naturalized and is registered as an invasive\nspecies. The plant was introduced by Captain Bligh from Tahiti as a staple food\nfor slaves and cultivated in the Castleton Botanical Garden in 1860. From there\nit was able to distribute itself throughout the eastern half of the island.\n\nAnother East-Asian genus is [[Christensenia]], a peculiar fern with fronds\nresembling a horse chestnut leaf. That is why the species is called\n[[Christensenia aesculifolia]], meaning Christensen's chestnut-leaf. Carl\nChristensen was a famous Danish fern botanist.\n\nThe most widespread genus in Marattiaceae is the pantropical [[Marattia]],\nusually occurring at higher elevations. These are also large ferns with globular\nrhizomes, but fronds can be up to 4 times pinnate. The sporangia are fused into\nbivalvate structures called a synangium.\n\nThe fourth genus [[Danaea]] is endemic to the Neotropics. They have bipinnate\nleaves with opposite pinnae, which are dimorphic, the fertile leaves much\ncontracted, and covered below with sunken synangia.\n\nThe genus [[Eupodium]] is also neotropical, with two species. It has fronds that\nare 2-5 times pinnate, stalked synangia, and awns on the adaxial side of distal\nblade segments. Blade division decreases towards the apex of the frond. Plants\nof Eupodium usually only have one frond per plant per year (sometimes two).\n\n[[Ptisana]] is a paleotropical genus. These plants are 2-4 times pinnate.\nTerminal segments usually have a prominent suture where they attach. The\nsporangia lack the labiate apertures of Marattia and Eupodium, and synangia are\ndeeply cut. The King Fern, Ptisana salicina, from New Zealand and the South\nPacific and known in MÄori as para now has been placed in this genus. Sometimes\ncalled the Potato Fern, this is a large fern with an edible fleshy rhizome that\nis used as a food source by some indigenous peoples.\n\nSeveral other genera have been named in the Marattiaceae, namely:\nArchangiopteris, Macroglossum, Protangiopteris, and Protomarattia. These are all\nsynonyms of Angiopteris.\n\nAccording to recent molecular studies it appears that these eusporangiate ferns\nmay be a sister group to the horsetails (Equisetaceae). Both groups are\ncertainly of ancient lineage.\n","linknr":176,"url":"Marattiopsida","recorded":1362372804,"links":34,"instances":["tree"],"pdf":["http://www.pryerlab.net/publication/fichier749.pdf","http://www.pryerlab.net/publication/fichier749.pdf"],"categories":["Marattiopsida|*","Pteridophyta families"],"headings":["References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e0/Starr_030807-0181_Angiopteris_evecta.jpg/240px-Starr_030807-0181_Angiopteris_evecta.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["horse-chestnut","tree"]],"members":[],"related":["Plant","Pteridophyta","Genus","Marattia","Fern","Temperate","Frond","Eusporangiate_fern","Sporangium","Australasia","Madagascar","Oceania_ecozone","Java","Jamaica","Invasive_species","William_Bligh","Tahiti","Slaves","Castleton_Botanical_Garden","Horse-chestnut_(tree)","Carl_Christensen","Pantropical","Sporangia","Synangium","Neotropics","Synangia","Neotropics","Paleotropics","Ptisana_salicina","New_Zealand","Oceania","Māori_language","Rhizome","Synonyms","Horsetails","Equisetaceae"]}
