Some\ninsects, amphibians, molluscs, crustaceans, Cnidarians, echinoderms and\ntunicates undergo metamorphosis, which is usually accompanied by a change of\nhabitat or behavior.\n\nScientific usage of the term is exclusive, and is not applied to general aspects\nof cell growth, including rapid growth spurts. References to \"metamorphosis\" in\nmammals are imprecise and only colloquial, but historically idealist ideas of\ntransformation and monadology, as in Goethe's [[Metamorphosis of Plants]],\ninfluenced the development of ideas of evolution.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"metamorphosis","recorded":1372154301,"links":[],"instances":["biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Developmental biology","Animal anatomy"],"headings":["Etymology","Insect metamorphosis","Amphibian metamorphosis","Metamorphosis in fish","See also","References","Bibliography","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["nymph","biology"]],"members":["nymph"],"related":["Ecdysis","Nymph_(biology)","Animal","Developmental_biology","Birth","Body","Cellular_differentiation","Insect","Amphibian","Mollusca","Crustacean","Cnidaria","Echinoderm","Tunicate","Habitat","Behavior","Cell_growth","Puberty","Mammal","Monadology","Johann_Wolfgang_von_Goethe","Evolution","Greek_language","Pterygota","Hemimetabolous","Holometabolous","Pupa","Larval","Hemimetabolous","Ecdysis","Instar","Holometabolous","Pupa","Pupa","Manduca_sexta","Caterpillar","Programmed_cell_death","Embryogenesis","Larva","Pupa","Adult","Insect","Hormone","Endocrine_gland","Brain","Prothoracicotropic_hormone","Ecdysone","Ecdysteroid","Corpora_allata","Juvenile_hormone","Ecdysis","Frogs","Toads","Newts","Thyroxin","Prolactin","Lateral_line","Apoptosis","Prolactin","Thyroxin","Osteichthyes","Agnatha","Diadromous","European_eel","Leptocephalus","Phenotypic_plasticity","Elopomorpha","Direct_development","Indirect_development","Hypermetamorphosis","Morphogenesis"]}
