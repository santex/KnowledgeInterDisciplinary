The technology is inherited from the ATIP\ncode used on CD-R discs.\n\nIf the DVD burner recognizes the discs it means that the disc has been tested by\nthe drive manufacturer to achieve the best possible burn using an optimal write\nstrategy. The strategy is stored in the firmware. Writing to a disc with no MID\ncode or a code that is not recognized can result in inaccurate recording and\ndata read-back problems.\n","linknr":103,"url":"Media_Identification_Code","recorded":1362579525,"links":15,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["DVD"],"headings":["Displaying the MID","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Floppy_icon.svg/30px-Floppy_icon.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["DVD-R","DVD+R","DVD-RAM","CD-R","Firmware","Dvd+rw-tools"]}
