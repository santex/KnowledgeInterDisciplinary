It can be contrasted to macroangiopathy.\n\nThe term 'cerebral small vessel disease' refers to a group of pathological\nprocesses with various aetiologies that affect the small arteries, arterioles,\nvenules, and capillaries of the brain. Age-related and hypertension-related\nsmall vessel diseases and cerebral amyloid angiopathy are the most common forms.\n\n'Small vessel coronary disease' is a type of coronary heart disease (CHD) that\naffects the heart's arterioles and capillaries. Small vessel coronary disease is\nalso known as cardiac syndrome X, microvascular dysfunction, non-obstructive\ncoronary disease, or microvascular angina.\n","linknr":257,"url":"Microangiopathy","recorded":1362482097,"links":18,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Histopathology"],"headings":["Pathophysiology","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e4/Colonic_serrated_adenoma_%282%29_histopatholgy.jpg/32px-Colonic_serrated_adenoma_%282%29_histopatholgy.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Angiopathy","Blood_vessel","Macroangiopathy","Arteries","Arteriole","Venule","Capillaries","Hypertension","Cerebral_amyloid_angiopathy","Coronary_heart_disease","Cardiac_syndrome_X","Diabetes_mellitus","Blood_glucose","Endothelial_cell","Insulin","Glycoprotein","Basement_membrane","Blood","Diabetic_retinopathy","Diabetic_nephropathy","Diabetic_neuropathy","Microangiopathic_hemolytic_anemia"]}
