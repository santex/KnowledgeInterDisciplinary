{"cursor":"3183","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n'Morris Cargill' CD (10 June 1914 – 8 April 2000, Kingston) was a white\nJamaican lawyer, businessman, planter, journalist and novelist.\n\nEducated at Munro College, a prestigious Jamaican secondary school, and the\nStowe School in England, Cargill was articled as a solicitor in 1937. During\nWorld War II, he worked for the Crown Film Unit in Britain.\n\nAfter the war, he played a role in the development of the coffee liqueur Tia\nMaria. Returning to the Caribbean he worked as a newspaper editor in Trinidad,\nand, having acquired a banana plantation in Jamaica, began a career as a\ncolumnist for the [[Gleaner Company|Gleaner]] newspapers in 1953 which was to\nlast, with some interruptions, until his death. Until the late 1970s, his\narticles appeared under the pseudonym \"Thomas Wright\".\n\nIn 1958, he was elected to the parliament of the Federation of the West Indies,\nas a candidate of the Jamaica Labour Party, and served as deputy leader of the\nopposition in that legislature for the next four years.\n\nIn 1964 he persuaded his friend Ian Fleming to write the introductory article\nfor a guidebook to Jamaica called Ian Fleming introduces Jamaica. In the late\n1960s and early 1970s, he collaborated with novelist John Hearne, under the\npseudonym 'John Morris', on a series of three thrillers -- Fever Grass, The\nCandywine Development, and The Checkerboard Caperâabout an imaginary Jamaican\nsecret service. Cargill makes an appearance, in the surprising guise of a high\ncourt judge, at the end of Fleming's novel [[The Man with the Golden Gun\n(novel)|The Man with the Golden Gun]].\n\nFor two years in the late 1970s, he left Jamaica because of his opposition to\nthe government of Michael Manley, returning in 1980 to join the campaign against\nManley. During this period he lived in the United States and worked for the\npublisher Lyle Stuart, editing a study of the Third Reich in Germany called A\nGallery of Nazis, and writing a memoir called Jamaica Farewell (an expanded\nversion of which was reissued in 1995).\n\nIn his last two decades of life, he became an established figure in Jamaican\njournalism, which must have amused him as his entry in Who's Who Jamaica and the\nDirectory of Personalities, described his hobby as \"pricking and puncturing\npompous people.\"\n\n\n\n{{Persondata \n| NAME = Cargill, Morris ALTERNATIVE NAMES =
