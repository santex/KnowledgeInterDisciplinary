{"cursor":"22704","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In abstract algebra, a branch of mathematics, a 'monoid' is an algebraic\nstructure with a single associative binary operation and an identity element.\nMonoids are studied in semigroup theory as they are naturally semigroups with\nidentity. Monoids occur in several branches of mathematics; for instance, they\ncan be regarded as categories with a single object. Thus, they capture the idea\nof function composition within a set. Monoids are also commonly used in computer\nscience, both in its foundational aspects and in practical programming. The\ntransition monoid and syntactic monoid are used in describing finite state\nmachines, whereas trace monoids and history monoids provide a foundation for\nprocess calculi and concurrent computing. Some of the more important results in\nthe study of monoids are the KrohnâRhodes theorem and the star height problem.\nThe history of monoids, as well as a discussion of additional general\nproperties, are found in the article on semigroups.\n","linknr":389,"url":"Monoid","recorded":1362372655,"links":44,"instances":["algebra","structure","algebra","computer_science","mathematics","mathematics","number","category_theory","order","functional_programming","set_theory","mathematics","mathematics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Algebraic
