She\nis a mutant whose bones grow out of her skin and can be removed from her body,\nproviding her with potential knives and clubs as well as body armor.\n\nAs a child, Marrow was taken in by the Morlocks, a band of grotesque-looking\nmutants who hid in tunnels beneath New York City. As a young adult, she formed\nthe violent splinter cell Gene Nation until, under the orders of Morlock leader\nCallisto, she joined the X-Men to redeem herself. She made progress controlling\nher powers and learning a moral code, but eventually fell in with the\nparamilitary group Weapon X.\n\nAs a child, Marrow first appeared in [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] #15 (September\n1994) and was created by writer Jeph Loeb and artist David Brewer. However,\n[[Uncanny X-Men]] writer Scott Lobdell and artist Joe Madureira defined her\npowers and temperament.\n\nShe has shown herself to be a staunch team player (more-so with the X-Men than\nwith either Gene Nation or Weapon X) who is prepared to risk her own life to\nprotect those of her teammates. Despite her apparent disdain for humanity, she\nhas revealed that she would like nothing more than to be able to fit in with\nthem and be happy.\n\nWhile there have been occasions that this has happened for her (in an art\ngallery with Colossus and immediately following her genetic redesign by Weapon\nX), they have never lasted long and only served to increase her anger and\nbitterness towards the world when they have been taken away from her.\n","linknr":535,"url":"Marrow_(comics)","recorded":1362560088,"links":25,"instances":["comics","comics","comics","comics","comics","comics","comics","comics","marvel_comics","comics","comics","comics","comics","comics","comics","comics","comics","comics","video_games","marvel_comics","comics","comics","comics","comics","comics","comics","marvel_comics","comics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Characters created by Jeph Loeb","Characters created by Scott Lobdell","Comics characters introduced in 1994","Marvel Comics superheroes","Marvel Comics supervillains","Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength","Fictional orphans","Marvel Comics mutants","Female supervillains"],"headings":["Publication history","Fictional character biography","Powers and abilities","Other versions","In other media","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/ac/X-Men_Marrow.jpg/210px-X-Men_Marrow.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg/20px-Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/38/GM_Marrow.jpg/220px-GM_Marrow.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/df/Marrow_in_Wolverine_and_the_X-Men_Opening.jpg/220px-Marrow_in_Wolverine_and_the_X-Men_Opening.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["mutant","marvel_comics"],["morlocks","comics"],["mutant","marvel_comics"],["morlocks","comics"],["callisto","comics"],["colossus","comics"],["morlocks","comics"],["marauders","comics"],["gambit","comics"],["callisto","comics"],["generation_x","comics"],["storm","marvel_comics"],["cable","comics"],["iceman","comics"],["wolverine","comics"],["cannonball","comics"],["jubilee","comics"],["revolution","comics"],["underground","comics"],["david_north","comics"],["decimation","comics"],["sally_floyd","comics"],["m","comics"],["quicksilver","comics"],["mutant","marvel_comics"],["wolverine","comics"],["storm","marvel_comics"],["sabertooth","comics"],["sabra","comics"],["sandman","marvel_comics"],["hood","comics"],["apocalypse","comics"],["bishop","comics"],["polaris","comics"],["boss","video_games"]],"members":["polaris","iceman","hood","wolverine","decimation","underground","marauders","sally_floyd","storm","sabra","generation_x","callisto","cannonball","quicksilver","gambit","apocalypse","cable","jubilee","boss","sandman","m","revolution","morlocks","david_north","bishop","colossus","mutant","sabertooth"],"related":["Mutant_(Marvel_Comics)","Marvel_Comics","Jeph_Loeb","Scott_Lobdell","Joe_Madureira","X-Cell","Morlocks_(comics)","Gene_Nation","X-Men","S.H.I.E.L.D.","Weapon_X","Healing_factor","Marvel_Comics","Fictional_character","X-Men","Mutant_(Marvel_Comics)","Morlocks_(comics)","New_York_City","Gene_Nation","Callisto_(comics)","Weapon_X","Jeph_Loeb","Scott_Lobdell","Joe_Madureira","Colossus_(comics)","Morlocks_(comics)","Mutant_Massacre","Warren_Worthington_III","Marauders_(comics)","Gambit_(comics)","Mikhail_Rasputin","Social_Darwinism","Callisto_(comics)","Mother","Gene_Nation","Earth-616","Generation_X_(comics)","Storm_(Marvel_Comics)","Cable_(comics)","Prime_Sentinel","Iceman_(comics)","Cecilia_Reyes","Wolverine_(comics)","Cannonball_(comics)","Shadow_King","N'Garai","Cecilia_Reyes","Spider-Man","Skrull","Galactus","Jubilee_(comics)","Revolution_(comics)","S.H.I.E.L.D.","Life_Model_Decoy","Mary_Jane_Watson","Weapon_X","Underground_(comics)","David_North_(comics)","Martyr","Decimation_(comics)","Sally_Floyd_(comics)","X-Cell","M_(comics)","Siryn","X-Factor_Investigations","Quicksilver_(comics)","Mutant_(Marvel_Comics)","Skrull","Spear","Healing_factor","Wolverine_(comics)","Storm_(Marvel_Comics)","Flagsmasher","Sabertooth_(comics)","Brooklyn_Bridge","Sabra_(comics)","Mister_Sinister","House_of_M","Sandman_(Marvel_Comics)","Hood_(comics)","Age_of_X","Emma_Frost","President_of_the_United_States","Mister_Sinister","Apocalypse_(comics)","Tara_Strong","Charles_Xavier","Bishop_(comics)","Here_Comes_Tomorrow","Polaris_(comics)","Master_Mold","Spyke","Player_character","Days_of_Future_Past","Boss_(video_games)","Nancy_Linari"]}
