Four everyday measuring devices that have metric calibrations: a tape\nmeasure calibrated in centimetres, a thermometer calibrated in degrees\nCelsius, a kilogram weight, and an electrical multimeter that measures volts,\namps and ohms.]]\n\nThe 'metric system' is an internationally agreed decimal system of measurement\nthat was originally based on the and the introduced by France in 1799. Over the\nyears, the definitions of the metre and kilogram have been refined and the\nmetric system has been extended to incorporate many more units. Although a\nnumber of variants of the metric system emerged in the late nineteenth and early\ntwentieth centuries the term is now often used as a synonym for \"SI\"<ref\nname=French group=Note>The following abbreviations are taken from the French\nrather then the English texts: *SI: ''Le Système international d'unités'' *CGPM:\n''Conférence générale des poids et mesures'' *CIPM: ''Comité international des\npoids et mesures'' *BIPM: ''Bureau international des poids et mesures'' *CIE:\n''Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage ''</ref> or the \"International System\nof Units\"&mdash;the official system of measurement in almost every country in\nthe world.\n\nThe metric system has been officially sanctioned for use in the United States\nsince 1866, but it remains the only industrialised country that has not adopted\nthe metric system as its official system of measurement. Many sources also cite\nLiberia and Burma as the only other countries not to have done so.<!-- A\ncombination of the text in the CIA Handbook (the word \"official\") and the NIST\nwebsite (the words \"industrialised country\". Both are cited in full within later\nin the article --> Although the United Kingdom uses the metric system for most\nofficial purposes, the use of the imperial system of measure, particularly in\nunregulated sectors such as journalism, is widespread.\n\nAlthough the originators intended to devise a system that was equally accessible\nto all, it proved necessary to use prototype units under the custody of\ngovernment or other approved authorities as standards. Control of the prototype\nunits of measure was maintained by the French government until 1875 when it\npassed to an inter-governmental organisation&mdash;the General Conference on\nWeights and Measures (CGPM).<ref name=French group=Note/> It is now hoped that\nthe last of these prototypes can be retired by 2014.\n\nFrom its beginning, the main features of the metric system were the standard set\nof inter-related base units and a standard set of prefixes in powers of ten.\nThese base units are used to derive larger and smaller units that could replace\na huge number of other units of measure in existence. Although the system was\nfirst developed for commercial use, the development of coherent units of measure\nmade it particularly suitable for science and engineering.\n\nThe uncoordinated use of the metric system by different scientific and\nengineering disciplines, particularly in the late 19th century, resulted in\ndifferent choices of fundamental units, even though all were based on the same\ndefinitions of the metre and the kilogram. During the 20th century, efforts were\nmade to rationalise these units and in 1960 the CGPM published the International\nSystem of Units which, since then, has been the internationally recognised\nstandard metric system.\n",
