In the United States and Canada a period is used (see\nAbbreviation).\n\nMrs. originated as a contraction of the honorific [[Mistress (form of\naddress)|Mistress]], the feminine of [[Mister (Mr.)|Mister]], or [[Master (form\nof address)|Master]], which was originally applied to both married and unmarried\nwomen. The split into Mrs. for married women from [[Ms.]] and [[Miss]] began\nduring the 17th century.<ref>Spender, Dale. Man-Made\nLanguage.</ref><ref>Stannard, Una.

A variant in the works of Thomas Hardy and others is\n\"Mis'ess\", reflecting its etymology. Misses has been used but is ambiguous as\nthis is a commonly used plural for Miss. The plural of Mrs. is from the French:\nMesdames. This may be used as is in written correspondence, or may be\nabbreviated Mmes.\n","title":"Mrs.","headings":["Traditional usage","Modern usage","Non-English equivalents","References"]},"micro-relation":["2: Ms.","2: Etiquette","2: Vocative","1: American_English","1: British_English","1: English_honorifics","1: Commonwealth_of_Nations","1: Abbreviation#History","1: Thomas_Hardy","1: Etymology","1: Widow","1: Nanny","1: Divorce","1: Maiden_name","1: Emily_Post","1: White-collar_worker","1: Helen_Hayes","1: Amelia_Earhart","1: Miss"]}
