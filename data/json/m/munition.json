Every fifth round with a red tip is an M20\n (armour piercing incendiary tracer).]]\n\n'Ammunition' is gunpowder and artillery, or broadly anything that can be used in\ncombat including bombs, missiles, warheads, landmines, naval mines, and anti-\npersonnel mines. The word comes from the French la munition which is all\nmaterial used for war. The collective term for all types of ammunition is\n'munitions'.\n\nThe purpose of ammunition is to project force against a selected target.\nHowever, the nature of ammunition use also includes delivery or combat\nsupporting munitions such as pyrotechnic or incendiary compounds. Since the\ndesign of the cartridge, the meaning has been transferred to the assembly of a\nprojectile and its propellant in a single package.\n\nAmmunition involves the application of fire to targets, general use of weapons\nby personnel, explosives and propellants, cartridge systems, high explosive\nprojectiles (HE), warheads, shaped charge forms of attack on armour and\naircraft, carrier projectiles, fuzes, mortar ammunition, small arms ammunition,\ngrenades, mines, pyrotechnics, improved conventional munitions, and terminally\nguided munition.\n",
