{"cursor":"4238","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n]]\n\nA 'major appliance', or 'domestic appliance', is usually defined as a large\nmachine which accomplishes some routine housekeeping task, which includes\npurposes such as cooking, or food preservation, whether in a household,\ninstitutional, commercial or industrial setting. An appliance is differentiated\nfrom a plumbing fixture because it uses an energy input for its operation other\nthan water, generally using electricity or natural gas/propane. An object run by\na watermill would also be considered an appliance. The term 'white goods' or 'whiteware' [http://www.energystar.govt.nz/energy-star-\nproducts/whiteware \"Energy Star Products\"] [[Energy Star]].govt.nz is also\nused for these items, primarily where British English is spoken, although\ndefinitions for the term \"white goods\" can differ. In the United States, the\nterm white goods more commonly refers to linens rather than appliances. [http://www.m-\nw.com/dictionary/white%20goods \" 'white goods' - Definition - Merriam-Webster\" ] [[Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary]]\n\nMajor appliances have become more technically complex from the control side\nrecently with the introduction of the various Energy Labelling rules across the\nworld. This has meant that the appliances have been forced to become more and\nmore efficient leading to more accurate controllers in order to meet the\nregulations.\n\nMajor appliances are differentiated from small appliances because they are\nlarge, difficult to move, and generally fixed in place to some extent. They are\noften considered fixtures and part of real estate and as such they are often\nsupplied to tenants as part of otherwise unfurnished rental properties. Another\nfrequent characteristic of major appliances is that they may have substantial\nelectricity requirements that necessitate special electrical wiring to supply\nhigher current and/or voltage than standard electrical outlets can deliver. This\nlimits where they can be placed in a home.\n","linknr":453,"url":"Major_appliance","recorded":1362534895,"links":53,"instances":["company","company","property_law","company"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Electro mechanical engineering","Home appliances|","Consumer goods","Hardlines"],"headings":["Brands","Types","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/85/LG_refrigerator_interior.jpg/220px-LG_refrigerator_interior.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/LGwashingmachine.jpg/170px-LGwashingmachine.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/Drying_cupboard_002.JPG/170px-Drying_cupboard_002.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Symbol_book_class2.svg/16px-Symbol_book_class2.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/12px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg/16px-Portal-puzzle.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg/16px-Wikiquote-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["fixture","property_law"],["dyson","company"],["midea","company"],["candy","company"]],"members":["candy","dyson","fixture","midea"],"related":["Machine","Cooking","Food_preservation","Plumbing_fixture","Water","Electricity","Natural_gas","Propane","Watermill","British_English","United_States","Linens","Small_appliance","Fixture_(property_law)","Real_estate","Electrical_wiring","Electric_current","Voltage","Whirlpool_Corporation","LG","Robert_Bosch_GmbH","Siemens","Electrolux","Samsung","Godrej_Group","Frigidaire","Dyson_(company)","AEG","Quba","Hitachi","Toshiba","Gorenje","Fujitsu","Haier","Midea_(company)","GE","Zanussi","Hotpoint","Candy_(company)","Mabe_Mexico","John_Inglis_and_Company","Kenmore_Appliances","White_Westinghouse","Indesit","Fagor","Beko","Blomberg","Vestel","Fulgor","Refrigeration","Freezer","Refrigerator","Stove","Kitchen_stove","Microwave_oven","Washing","Washing_machine","Clothes_dryer","Drying_cabinet","Dishwasher","Air_conditioner","Water_heater","Computer","Television","Small_appliance","Domestic_technology","Home_automation","E-waste","Household_chore","Yellow_goods","Brown_goods"]}
