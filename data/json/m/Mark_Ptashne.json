He currently holds the Ludwig Chair of\nMolecular Biology at Memorial SloanâKettering Cancer Center in New York. He was\nthe first scientist to demonstrate specific binding between protein and DNA, and\nhis lifelong work has been the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms of switch\nbetween lytic and lysogenic lifecyle of bacteriophage lambda, as well as how the\nyeast transcriptional activator Gal4 works. He was the originator of the \"ball\nand stick\" model of transcription factor function, demonstrating in bacteria and\nin yeast that they typically consist of separable regions that mediate DNA\nbinding and interaction with transcriptional activators or repressors. In 1980\nhe cofounded Genetics Institute, Inc. with Thomas Maniatis, which was acquired\nby Wyeth 1996.

In 1985, he was awarded Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize\nfrom Columbia University. He won Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research\nin 1997. He has written popular books for a wider scientific audience, including\nhis book Genes and Signals. {{cite journal |last=Ptashne |first=M\n|year=1967 |title=Specific Binding of the Î» Phage Repressor to Î» DNA\n|journal=Nature |volume=214 |pages=232â234 |doi=10.1038/214232a0 |issue=5085\n}} {{cite journal |last=Ptashne |first=M |coauthors=et al. |year=1980\n|title=How the Î» repressor and cro work |journal=Cell |volume=19 |pages=1â11 |doi=10.1016/0092-8674(80)90383-\n9 |pmid=6444544 |issue=1 }}\n","linknr":225,"url":"Mark_Ptashne","recorded":1362481132,"links":23,"instances":["journal","journal"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Living people","Molecular biologists","Harvard University faculty","Reed College alumni","Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences","1940 births","Recipients of the Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research"],"headings":["References","Bibliography","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c5/Nci-vol-8185-300_mark_ptashne.jpg/220px-Nci-vol-8185-300_mark_ptashne.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a4/Flag_of_the_United_States.svg/35px-Flag_of_the_United_States.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/03/Scientist.svg/30px-Scientist.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["nature","journal"],["cell","journal"]],"members":["cell","nature"],"related":["Chicago","Molecular_biology","Violin","Memorial_Sloan–Kettering_Cancer_Center","Lytic","Lysogenic","Lambda_phage","Transcription_factor","Genetics_Institute,_Inc.","Thomas_Maniatis","Wyeth","Louisa_Gross_Horwitz_Prize","Columbia_University","Albert_Lasker_Award_for_Basic_Medical_Research","Nature_(journal)","Cell_(journal)","The_New_York_Times"]}
