{"cursor":"47205","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'penalty' in ice hockey is a punishment for an infringement of the rules. Most\npenalties are enforced by detaining the offending player within a penalty box\nfor a set number of minutes, during which the player can not participate in\nplay. The offending team usually may not replace the player on the ice, leaving\nthem short handed as opposed to full strength. The opposing team is said to be\non a [[Power play (sport)|power play]], having one player more on the ice than\nthe short-handed team. The short handed team is said to be \"penalty killing\"\nuntil the penalty expires and the penalized player returns to play. While\nstandards vary somewhat between leagues, most leagues recognize several common\ndegrees of penalty, as well as common infractions. The statistic used to track\npenalties was traditionally called \"Penalty Infraction Minutes\" (PIM), although\nthe alternate term \"Penalties in Minutes\" has become common in recent\nyears.
