US Geological Survey, [http://woodshole.er.usgs.gov/project-\npages/hydrates/what.html Gas hydrate: What is it?], accessed 27 February\n2010. Originally thought to occur only in the outer regions of the Solar\nSystem where temperatures are low and water ice is common, significant deposits\nof methane clathrate have been found under sediments on the ocean floors of Earth. [http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/pub/old-gas-new-\ngas] The worldwide amount of carbon bound in gas hydrates is\nconservatively estimated to total twice the amount of carbon to be found in all\nknown fossil fuels on Earth. [http://marine.usgs.gov/fact-sheets/gas-\nhydrates/title.html Gas (Methane) Hydrates -- A New Frontier] , USGS fact\nsheet\n\nMethane clathrates are common constituents of the shallow marine geosphere, and\nthey occur both in deep sedimentary structures, and as outcrops on the ocean\nfloor. Methane hydrates are believed to form by migration of gas from depth\nalong geological faults, followed by precipitation, or crystallization, on\ncontact of the rising gas stream with cold sea water. Methane clathrates are\nalso present in deep Antarctic ice cores, and record a history of atmospheric\nmethane concentrations, dating to 800,000 years ago. The ice-core\nmethane clathrate record is a primary source of data for global warming\nresearch, along with oxygen and carbon dioxide.\n","linknr":484,"url":"Methane_clathrate","recorded":1362375223,"links":42,"instances":["tv_channel","oil_well","environmental","chemistry","unit","unit","geology","oil_drilling"],"pdf":["http://digitalcorpora.org/corp/nps/files/govdocs1/223/223434.pdf","http://geosci.uchicago.edu/~archer/reprints/buffett.2004.clathrates.pdf","http://geosci.uchicago.edu/~archer/reprints/buffett.2004.clathrates.pdf","http://www.cosis.net/abstracts/EGU2008/01526/EGU2008-A-01526.pdf","http://www.gsc.nrcan.gc.ca/gashydrates/canada/pdf/natural_gas_studies_in_canada.pdf"],"categories":["Clathrate hydrates","Hydrocarbons","Methane","Unconventional gas"],"headings":["Structure and composition","Natural deposits","Hydrates in natural gas processing","Methane clathrates and climate change","Natural gas hydrates (NGH) vs. liquified natural gas (LNG) in transportation","References in Popular Culture","See also","Notes","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/03/Burning_hydrate_inlay_US_Office_Naval_Research.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b4/Methane_Hydrate_phase_diagram.jpg/260px-Methane_Hydrate_phase_diagram.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ab/Gas_hydrates_1996.svg/350px-Gas_hydrates_1996.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Gashydrat_im_Sediment.JPG/220px-Gashydrat_im_Sediment.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/Gashydrat_mit_Struktur.jpg/220px-Gashydrat_mit_Struktur.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/BP_oil_containment_domes.jpg/220px-BP_oil_containment_domes.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["fault","geology"],["mole","unit"],["magic_number","chemistry"],["pascal","unit"],["hypoxia","environmental"],["annulus","oil_well"],["casing","borehole"],["shut-in","oil_drilling"],["casing","borehole#cementing"],["tnt","tv_channel"]],"members":["tnt","annulus","hypoxia","magic_number","mole","pascal","casing","fault"],"related":["United_States_Geological_Survey","Clathrate_compound","Clathrate_hydrate","Methane","Crystal","Ice","Solar_System","Ocean","Earth","USGS","Geosphere","Sedimentary_rock","Fault_(geology)","Antarctica","Ice_core","Atmospheric_methane","Global_warming","Mole_(unit)","Standard_temperature_and_pressure","Methane","Dodecahedron","Tetradecahedron","Magic_number_(chemistry)","Hydronium_ion","Magic_angle_spinning","Kelvin","Pascal_(unit)","Gas_phase","Montmorillonite","Lithosphere","Sedimentary_rock","Sediment","Water_mass","Lake_Baikal","Siberia","Alaska","Sandstone","Siltstone","Continental_shelf","Sediment-water_interface","Methane","Clathrate","Carbon-13","Redox","Carbon_dioxide","Gas_hydrate_stability_zone","Blake_Ridge","Continental_rise","Phase_equilibrium","Hydrocarbon","Carbon-13","Organic_matter","Gulf_of_Mexico","Caspian_Sea","Methanogen","Archaea","Water_column","Sulfates","Sulfides","Remineralization","Electron_acceptors","Pore_water","Hypoxia_(environmental)","Seawater","Syntrophic","Order_of_magnitude","Continental_shelves","Sandstone","Siltstone","Alaska","Siberia","Northern_Canada","Mallik_gas_hydrate_site","Mackenzie_River","Imperial_Oil","Natural_gas","Hydrocarbon","Fuel","Messoyakha_Gas_Field","Russia","Norilsk","Japan","Aichi_Prefecture","Bjørn_Kvamme","Arne_Graue","University_of_Bergen","ConocoPhillips","JOGMEC","Ethylene_glycol","Methanol","Antifreeze","Annulus_(oil_well)","Casing_(borehole)","Shut-in_(oil_drilling)","Bore_hole","Deepwater_Horizon_oil_spill","Oil_well","Sea_level","Greenhouse_gas","Half_life","Global_warming_potential","Climate","Permian-Triassic_extinction_event","Paleocene-Eocene_Thermal_Maximum","James_E._Hansen","Permafrost","Runaway_climate_change","Monterey_Bay_Aquarium_Research_Institute","European_Geophysical_Union","Liquefied_natural_gas","LNG_carrier","Natural_gas_hydrate","Alternative_energy","TNT_(TV_channel)","Christopher_Ewing","Jesse_Metcalfe","Clathrate_compound","Clathrate_gun_hypothesis","Clathrate_hydrate","Future_energy_development","Long-term_effects_of_global_warming","U.S._Department_of_Energy"]}
