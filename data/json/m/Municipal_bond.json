Municipal bonds may be general\nobligations of the issuer or secured by specified revenues.\n\nIn the United States, interest income received by holders of municipal bonds is\noften exempt from the federal income tax and from the income tax of the state in\nwhich they are issued, although municipal bonds issued for certain purposes may\nnot be tax exempt.\n\nUnlike new issue stocks that are brought to market with price restrictions until\nthe deal is sold, municipal bonds are free to trade at any time once they are\npurchased by the investor. Professional traders regularly trade and retrade the\nsame bonds several times a week.\n","linknr":406,"url":"Municipal_bond","recorded":1362555831,"links":25,"instances":["finance","voting","finance","bond"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Government debt","Local government in the United States","Government bonds"],"headings":["History","Types of tax-exempt bonds","Purpose of municipal bonds","Characteristics of municipal bonds","Risk","Disclosures to investors","Comparison to corporate bonds","Subprime mortgage crisis","Default rates","Build America Bonds","Statutory history","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d7/Philippine-stock-market-board.jpg/135px-Philippine-stock-market-board.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c9/Obligacja1929Krakow10.jpg/200px-Obligacja1929Krakow10.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/b/d/0bd6673197cb08176dd64c1ea136dbcc.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/6/9/e/69e04f1ddb140f72a3b4d454c67d2816.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/d/c/edcf145a8210cf0a36d3a3d21ae7cbf1.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/c/1/4/c1435cf90f694bdf5059326dc4c6497d.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["bond","finance"],["bond","finance"],["bond","finance"],["plurality","voting"],["coupon","bond"],["yield","finance"]],"members":["bond","plurality","yield","coupon"],"related":["Bond_(finance)","Special-purpose_district","School_district","Tax_advantage","Income_tax","Poland","Certificate_of_deposit","Primary_market","Secondary_market","Bond_(finance)","Initiative","Bond_(finance)","Funding","Public_works","Vote","Plurality_(voting)","Majority","United_States","Revenue","Tax","Private_activity_bonds","General_obligation_bond","Revenue_bond","Assessment_bond","Property_tax","Rating_agency","Standard_&_Poor's","Moody's","Fitch_Ratings","Bond_rating","Primary_market","Electronic_Municipal_Market_Access","Municipal_Securities_Rulemaking_Board","Coupon_(bond)","Yield_(finance)","Arbitrage","Municipal_Bond_Arbitrage","Monoline_insurance","Monoline_insurance","Collateralized_debt_obligation","American_Recovery_and_Reinvestment_Act","Tax_credit","Revenue_Act_of_1913","Tax_Reform_Act_of_1986","Internal_Revenue_Code"]}
