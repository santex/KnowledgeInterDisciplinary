It purports to be an approach to evolutionary models of\ncultural information transfer.\n\nThe meme, analogous to a gene, was conceived as a \"unit of culture\" (an idea,\nbelief, pattern of behaviour, etc.) which is \"hosted\" in one or more individual\nminds, and which can reproduce itself, thereby jumping from mind to mind. Thus\nwhat would otherwise be regarded as one individual influencing another to adopt\na belief is seen—when adopting the intentional stance Discussion between\nJeremy Burman and Tim Tyler, [http://on-memetics.blogspot.com/2012/02/was-there-misunderstanding-of-\nmemes.html Was there a misunderstanding of memes?] On Memetics. —as\nan idea-replicator reproducing itself in a new host. As with genetics,\nparticularly under a Dawkinsian interpretation, a meme's success may be due to\nits contribution to the effectiveness of its host.\n\nMemetics is also notable for sidestepping the traditional concern with the\n[[truth]] of ideas and beliefs. Instead, it is interested in their success.\n\nThe Usenet newsgroup alt.memetics started in 1993 with peak posting years in the\nmid to late 1990s.
