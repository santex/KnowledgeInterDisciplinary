He shared a Nobel Prize\nin Physiology or Medicine in 1968 with Har Gobind Khorana and Robert W. Holley\nfor \"breaking the genetic code\" and describing how it operates in protein\nsynthesis. In the same year, together with Har Gobind Khorana, he was awarded\nthe Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize from Columbia University.\n","linknr":978,"url":"Marshall_Nirenberg","recorded":1362483933,"links":62,"instances":["author"],"pdf":[],"categories":["1927 births","2010 deaths","Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences","American biochemists","American geneticists","Jewish American scientists","American Nobel laureates","Nobel laureates in Physiology or Medicine","Members of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences","University of Michigan alumni","National Medal of Science laureates","University of Florida alumni","Members of the European Academy of Sciences and Arts","Recipients of the Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research"],"headings":["Research","Biography","See also","Notes","References","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d9/Marshall_Nirenberg_2003.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/78/Nierenberg_matthaei.jpg/250px-Nierenberg_matthaei.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/MNirenberg.jpg/250px-MNirenberg.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["ed_regis","author"]],"members":["ed_regis"],"related":["New_York_City","United_States","Genetic_code","United_States","Biochemist","Genetics","Jewish","Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_or_Medicine","Har_Gobind_Khorana","Robert_W._Holley","Genetic_code","Har_Gobind_Khorana","Louisa_Gross_Horwitz_Prize","Columbia_University","Avery-MacLeod-McCarty_experiment","Hershey-Chase_experiment","Meselson-Stahl_experiment","DNA","DNA","RNA","Heinrich_J._Matthaei","National_Institutes_of_Health","RNA","Uracil","Nucleotide","RNA","DNA","RNA","Ribosome","Protein","DNase","RNA","Amino_acid","Phenylalanine","Radioactive","Genetic_code","Phenylalanine","Uracil","Codon","Messenger_RNA","Proceedings_of_the_National_Academy_of_Sciences","Journal_of_Molecular_Biology","Science_Magazine","PNAS","PNAS","Francis_Crick","Adenosine","Lysine","Cytosine","Proline","Philip_Leder","TRNA","DeWitt_Stetten,_Jr.","Neuroscience","Homeobox","New_York_City","Rheumatic_fever","Orlando,_Florida","Subtropical_climate","Biology","B.S._degree","Master's_degree","Zoology","University_of_Florida","Pi_Lambda_Phi","Fraternity","Dissertation","Master's_thesis","Ecological","Taxonomic","Caddis_flies","Trichoptera","Ph.D.","Biochemistry","University_of_Michigan","Ann_Arbor","Postdoctoral","National_Institutes_of_Health","American_Cancer_Society","National_Institute_of_Arthritis_and_Metabolic_Diseases","NIH","DNA","RNA","Protein","National_Heart_Institute","National_Heart,_Lung,_and_Blood_Institute","Perola_Zaltzman","Chemist","University_of_Brazil","Rio_de_Janeiro","NIH","Myrna_M._Weissman","Ph.D.","Epidemiology","Psychiatry","Columbia_University_College_of_Physicians_and_Surgeons","Evanston,_Illinois","New_York,_New_York","New_Haven,_Connecticut","San_Francisco,_California","National_Medal_of_Science","National_Medal_of_Honor","President","Lyndon_B._Johnson","American_Philosophical_Society","Cancer","History_of_RNA_biology","List_of_Jewish_Nobel_laureates","List_of_RNA_biologists","Heinrich_Matthaei","Ed_Regis_(author)","Scientific_American","New_York_City"]}
