{"cursor":"4548","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Micropublishing' is used in two senses. *The book publishing industry sometimes\nuses this term in discussing publishing companies below a certain revenue level.\n*It is also used to describe the use of efficient publishing and distribution\ntechniques to publish a work intended for a specific micromarket. Typically,\nthese works are not considered by larger publishers because of their low economy\nof scale and mass appeal and the difficulties that would arise in their\nmarketing.\n\nThe remainder of this article is about the second use of the term.\n\nTo make micropublishing more economical, the works are often printed using POD\n(Print On Demand) printing techniques. Those new to the industry often use\ncompanies called \"POD publishers,\" while those who have more experience or who\nare more profit-focused tend to skip these middlemen. POD printing reduces the\nrequired up-front investment in book publishing, allowing many more individuals\nand companies to enter the marketplace, and allowing niche markets to be served\nas never before. The ebook market is taking this one step further.\n","linknr":139,"url":"Micropublishing","recorded":1362574166,"links":17,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Publishing terms","Ebook suppliers"],"headings":["History","Present","eReaders","Distribution","Notes","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Publishing","Content_distribution","Micromarket","Economy_of_scale","Mass_appeal","Marketing","Print_On_Demand","Niche_market","Ebook","Internet","Self-publishing","Digital_distribution","Digital_distribution","Copyright_piracy","Scraper_sites","Digital_Millennium_Copyright_Act","Infringement","Intellectual_property","Copyright","Scribd","Docstoc","Intellectual_property","Intellectual_property"]}
