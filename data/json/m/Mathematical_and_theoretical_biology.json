{"cursor":"39712","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Mathematical and theoretical biology' is an interdisciplinary scientific\nresearch field with a range of applications in biology, biotechnology, and\nmedicine. [http://sciencecareers.sciencemag.org/career_d-\nevelopment/previous_issues/articles/2870/mathematical_and_theoretical_biology_a-\n_european_perspective Mathematical and Theoretical Biology: A European\nPerspective] The field may be referred to as 'mathematical biology' or\n'biomathematics' to stress the mathematical side, or as 'theoretical biology' to\nstress the biological side. \"There is a subtle difference between\nmathematical biologists and theoretical biologists. Mathematical biologists tend\nto be employed in mathematical departments and to be a bit more interested in\nmath inspired by biology than in the biological problems themselves, and vice\nversa.\" [http://life.biology.mcmaster.ca/~brian/biomath/careers.theo.biol.html\nCareers in theoretical biology] It includes at least four major subfields:\nbiological mathematical modeling, relational biology/complex systems biology\n(CSB), bioinformatics and computational biomodeling/biocomputing. Mathematical\nbiology aims at the mathematical representation, treatment and modeling of\nbiological processes, using a variety of applied mathematical techniques and\ntools. It has both theoretical and practical applications in biological,\nbiomedical and biotechnology research. For example, in cell biology, protein\ninteractions are often represented as \"cartoon\" models, which, although easy to\nvisualize, do not accurately describe the systems studied. In order to do this,\nprecise mathematical models are required. By describing the systems in a\nquantitative manner, their behavior can be better simulated, and hence\nproperties can be predicted that might not be evident to the experimenter.\n\nSuch mathematical areas as calculus, probability theory, statistics, linear\nalgebra, abstract algebra, graph theory, combinatorics, algebraic geometry,\ntopology, dynamical systems, differential equations and coding theory are now\nbeing applied in biology. Some mathematical areas, such as\nstatistics, were developed as tools during the conduct of research into\nmathematical biology.\n","linknr":652,"url":"Mathematical_and_theoretical_biology","recorded":1362509677,"links":53,"instances":["genetics","theoretical_biologist"],"pdf":["http://acube.org/volume_23/v23-1p11-36.pdf","http://papa.indstate.edu/amcbt/volume_23/v23-1p11-36.pdf","http://cdsweb.cern.ch/record/746663/files/COMPUTER_MODEL_AND_AUTOMATA_THEORY_IN_BIOLOGY2p.pdf","https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/bitstream/1807/2951/2/compauto.pdf","https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/retrieve/4969/QuantumInteractomicsInCancer_Sept13k4E_cuteprt.pdf","http://cogprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/archive/00003718/01/COMPUTER_SIMULATIONCOMPUTABILITYBIOSYSTEMSrefnew.pdf","http://www.sbi.uni-rostock.de/dokumente/p_gilles_paper.pdf","http://www.princeton.edu/~allengrp/ms/annobib/mb.pdf","http://library.bjcancer.org/ebook/109.pdf","http://www.ams.org/notices/199509/hoppensteadt.pdf","http://www.ams.org/notices/199509/hoppensteadt.pdf","http://www.resnet.wm.edu/~jxshix/math490/reed.pdf","http://www.resnet.wm.edu/~jxshix/math490/reed.pdf","http://eprints.maths.ox.ac.uk/567/01/224.pdf","http://eprints.maths.ox.ac.uk/567/01/224.pdf","http://eqworld.ipmnet.ru/en/solutions/syspde/spde-toc2.pdf"],"categories":["Mathematical
