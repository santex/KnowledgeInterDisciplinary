Without a cell wall, they are unaffected by many common\nantibiotics such as penicillin or other beta-lactam antibiotics that target cell\nwall synthesis. They can be parasitic or saprotrophic. Several species are\npathogenic in humans, including [[Mycoplasma pneumoniae|M. pneumoniae]], which\nis an important cause of atypical pneumonia and other respiratory disorders, and\n[[Mycoplasma genitalium|M. genitalium]], which is believed to be involved in\npelvic inflammatory diseases. Mycoplasma is the smallest known cell and is about\n0.1 Âµm in diameter.\n","linknr":535,"url":"Mycoplasma","recorded":1362483829,"links":47,"instances":["biology","unit"],"pdf":["http://ijs.sgmjournals.org/cgi/reprint/23/1/62.pdf","http://ijs.sgmjournals.org/cgi/reprint/23/1/62.pdf","http://mic.sgmjournals.org/cgi/reprint/14/1/197.pdf","http://mic.sgmjournals.org/cgi/reprint/14/1/197.pdf","http://catalog2.corning.com/Lifesciences/media/pdf/cccontamination.pdf","http://catalog2.corning.com/Lifesciences/media/pdf/cccontamination.pdf"],"categories":["Bacteria","Bacteria genera","Rodent-carried diseases"],"headings":["Origin of the name","Characteristics","First isolation","Small genome","Taxonomy","Laboratory contaminant","Synthetic mycoplasma genome","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["class","biology"],["mole","unit"]],"members":["class","mole"],"related":["Bacteria","Tenericutes","Firmicutes","Mollicutes","Mycoplasmataceae","Mycoplasmataceae","Julian_Nowak","Genus","Bacteria","Cell_wall","Antibiotics","Penicillin","Beta-lactam","Parasitic","Saprotrophic","Pathogen","Atypical_pneumonia","Pelvic_inflammatory_diseases","Μm","Albert_Bernhard_Frank","Contagious_bovine_pleuropneumonia","Class_(biology)","Parasite","Commensal","Vertebrate","Cholesterol","Celsius","Ribosomal_RNA","Gene","Firmicutes","Bacteria","Cell_wall","Pseudococcoidal","Sterols","Cytoplasmic_membrane","Genome","Genetic_code","Codon","Tryptophan","Stop_codon","GC-content","Mole_(unit)","In_vitro","Molecular_biology","Genomics","Primer_walking","Cosmid","Whole-genome_shotgun","Proteomics","Mycoplasma_laboratorium","Serology","Ribosomal_RNA","Molecular_phylogenetics","Mollicutes","Peptidoglycan","Taxonomists","Gram-positive_bacteria","16S_ribosomal_RNA","Haemotrophic_mollicutes","Haemoplasmas","Cell_culture","Growth_medium","Microscope","Chromosome","Metabolism","ELISA","Polymerase_chain_reaction","Agar","DNA","DAPI","Hoechst_stain","Corning_Incorporated","Mycoplasma_laboratorium"]}
