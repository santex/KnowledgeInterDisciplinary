      "text" : "\n\n\nIn theoretical physics, 'M-theory' is an extension of string theory in which 11\ndimensions of spacetime are identified as 7 higher-dimensions + the 4 common\ndimensions (11D st = 7 hd + 4D). Proponents believe that the 11-dimensional\ntheory unites all five 10 dimensional string theories and supersedes them.\nThough a full description of the theory is not known, the low-entropy dynamics\nare known to be interacting with 2- and 5-dimensional membranes.\n\nThis idea is the unique supersymmetric theory in 11 dimensions, with its low-\nentropy matter content and interactions fully determined, and can be obtained as\nthe strong coupling limit of type IIA string theory because a new dimension of\nspace emerges as the coupling constant increases.\n\nDrawing on the work of a number of string theorists (including Ashoke Sen, Chris\nHull, Paul Townsend, Michael Duff and John Schwarz), Edward Witten of the\nInstitute for Advanced Study suggested its existence at a conference at USC in\n1995, and used M-theory to explain a number of previously observed dualities,\ninitiating a flurry of new research in string theory called the second\nsuperstring revolution.\n\nIn the early 1990s, it was shown that the various superstring theories were\nrelated by dualities which allow the description of an object in one super\nstring theory to be related to the description of a different object in another\nsuper string theory. These relationships imply that each of the super string\ntheories is a different aspect of a single underlying theory, proposed by\nWitten, and named \"M-theory\".\n\nOriginally the letter M in M-theory was taken from membrane, a construct\ndesigned to generalize the strings of string theory. However, as Witten was more\nskeptical about membranes than his colleagues, he opted for \"M-theory\" rather\nthan \"Membrane theory\". Witten has since stated that the different\ninterpretations of the M can be a matter of taste for the user, such as magic,\nmystery, and mother theory.<ref>Witten, Edward.\n[http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=412&artikel=2102509 Radio\ninterview], Vetandets värld, Swedish public radio, 6 June 2008.</ref>\n\nM-theory (and string theory) has been criticized for lacking predictive power or\nbeing untestable. Further work continues to find mathematical constructs that\njoin various surrounding theories. However, the tangible success of M-theory can\nbe questioned, given its current incompleteness and limited predictive power.\n",
