The study of microorganisms is\ncalled microbiology, a subject that began with Anton van Leeuwenhoek's discovery\nof microorganisms in 1675, using a microscope of his own design.\n\nMicroorganisms are very diverse; they include all of the prokaryotes, namely the\nbacteria and archaea; and various forms of eukaryotes, comprising the protozoa,\nfungi, algae, microscopic plants (green algae), and animals such as rotifers and\nplanarians. Some microbiologists also classify viruses as microorganisms, but\nothers consider these as nonliving.<ref></ref><ref name=pmid13481308>{{Cite\njournal |author=LWOFF A |title=The concept of virus |journal=J.

Microorganisms are crucial to nutrient\nrecycling in ecosystems as they act as decomposers. As some microorganisms can\nfix nitrogen, they are a vital part of the nitrogen cycle, and recent studies\nindicate that airborne microbes may play a role in precipitation and\nweather.<ref></ref>\n\nOn 17 March 2013, researchers reported data that suggested microbial life forms\nthrive in the Mariana Trench. the deepest spot on the Earth.<ref name=\"LS-\n20130317\"></ref><ref name=\"NG-20130317\"></ref> Other researchers reported\nrelated studies that microbes thrive inside rocks up to 1900 feet (580 metres)\nbelow the sea floor under 8500 feet (2590 metres) of ocean off the coast of the\nnorthwestern United States.<ref name=\"LS-20130317\" /><ref name=\"LS-\n20130314\"></ref> According to one of the researchers,\"You can find microbes\neverywhere — they're extremely adaptable to conditions, and survive wherever\nthey are.\"<ref name=\"LS-20130317\" />\n\nMicrobes are also exploited by people in biotechnology, both in traditional food\nand beverage preparation, and in modern technologies based on genetic\nengineering. However there are many pathogenic microbes which are harmful and\ncan even cause death in plants and\nanimals.<ref>[http://www.who.int/healthinfo/bodgbd2002revised/en/index.html 2002\nWHO mortality data] Accessed 20 January 2007</ref>\n",
