{"cursor":"8476","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"s are included in the molecular model of a protein.]]\n\n\n'Molecular modeling' encompasses all theoretical methods and computational\ntechniques used to model or mimic the behaviour of molecules. The techniques are\nused in the fields of computational chemistry, drug design, computational\nbiology and materials science for studying molecular systems ranging from small\nchemical systems to large biological molecules and material assemblies. The\nsimplest calculations can be performed by hand, but inevitably computers are\nrequired to perform molecular modelling of any reasonably sized system. The\ncommon feature of molecular modelling techniques is the atomistic level\ndescription of the molecular systems. This may include treating atoms as the\nsmallest individual unit (the Molecular mechanics approach), or explicitly\nmodeling electrons of each atom (the quantum chemistry approach).\n","linknr":172,"url":"Molecular_modelling","recorded":1362668950,"links":24,"instances":["chemistry","abstract"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Molecular modelling|","Bioinformatics","Molecular biology","Computational chemistry"],"headings":["Molecular mechanics","Variables","Applications","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b5/Peptide_angles.png/220px-Peptide_angles.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/48/Hardware-accelerated-molecular-modeling.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/0/9/00985fc47499c3f6deaa402f07e49010.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/0/a/00a12e86985706a12bbea84f3dce0d73.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/e/8/7e8eeee0c85073d8a25eb9a28f1005cf.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["model","abstract"],["force_field","chemistry"],["force_field","chemistry"]],"members":["force_field","model"],"related":["Protein","Model_(abstract)","Molecule","Computational_chemistry","Drug_design","Computational_biology","Materials_science","Molecular_mechanics","Quantum_chemistry","Molecular_mechanics","Classical_mechanics","Newtonian_mechanics","Chemical_bonds","Van_der_Waals_forces","Lennard-Jones_potential","Van_der_Waals_forces","Coulomb's_law","Internal_coordinates","Potential_function","Steepest_descent","Conjugate_gradient","Molecular_dynamics","Potential_function","Force_field_(chemistry)","Potential_function","Molecular_dynamics","Protein_folding","Enzyme","Catalysis","Biomolecular_function","DNA","Cheminformatics","Computational_chemistry","Force_field_(chemistry)","Force_field_implementation","List_of_molecular_graphics_systems","List_of_nucleic_acid_simulation_software","List_of_software_for_Monte_Carlo_molecular_modeling","List_of_software_for_nanostructures_modeling","List_of_protein_structure_prediction_software","Molecular_design_software","Molecular_dynamics","Molecular_graphics","Molecular_mechanics","Molecular_model","Molecular_modeling_on_GPU","Molecule_editor","Monte_Carlo_method","Quantum_chemistry_computer_programs","Semi-empirical_quantum_chemistry_method","Simulated_reality","List_of_software_for_molecular_mechanics_modeling","Structural_bioinformatics","Molecular_Simulation"]}
