{"cursor":"39838","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'microbial mat' is a multi-layered sheet of micro-organisms, mainly bacteria\nand archaea. Microbial mats grow at interfaces between different types of\nmaterial, mostly on submerged or moist surfaces but a few survive in\ndeserts. They\ncolonize environments ranging in temperature from â40Â°C to +120Â°C. A few are\nfound as endosymbionts of animals.\n\nAlthough only a few centimetres thick at most, microbial mats create a wide\nrange of internal chemical environments, and hence generally consist of layers\nof micro-organisms that can feed on or at least tolerate the dominant\nchemicals at their level and which are usually of closely related species. In\nmoist conditions mats are usually held together by slimy substances secreted\nby the micro-organisms, and in many cases some of the micro-organisms form\ntangled webs of filaments which make the mat tougher. The best known physical\nforms are flat mats and stubby pillars called stromatolites, but there are\nalso spherical forms.\n\nMicrobial mats are the earliest form of life on Earth for which there is good\nfossil evidence, from , and have been the most important members and maintainers\nof the planet's ecosystems. Originally they depended on hydrothermal vents for\nenergy and chemical \"food\", but the development of photosynthesis gradually\nliberated them from the \"hydrothermal ghetto\" by proving a more widely available\nenergy source, sunlight, although initially the photosynthesizing mats still\ndepended on the diffusion of chemicals emitted by hydrothermal vents. The final\nand most significant stage of this liberation was the development of oxygen-\nproducing photosynthesis, since the main chemical inputs for this are carbon\ndioxide and water.\n\nAs a result microbial mats began to produce the atmosphere we know today, in\nwhich free oxygen is a vital component. At around the same time they may also\nhave been the birthplace of the more complex eukaryote type of cell, of which\nall multicellular organisms are composed. Microbial mats were abundant on the\nshallow seabed until the Cambrian substrate revolution, when animals living in\nshallow seas increased their burrowing capabilities and thus broke up the\nsurfaces of mats and let oxygenated water into the deeper layers, poisoning the\noxygen-intolerant micro-organisms that lived there. Although this revolution\ndrove mats off soft floors of shallow seas, they still flourish in many\nenvironments where burrowing is limited or impossible, including rocky seabeds\nand shores, hyper-saline and brackish lagoons, and are found on the floors of\nthe deep oceans.\n\nBecause of microbial mats' ability to use almost anything as \"food\", there is\nconsiderable interest in industrial uses of mats, especially for water treatment\nand for cleaning up pollution.\n","linknr":934,"url":"Microbial_mat","recorded":1362511605,"links":43,"instances":["biology","biology","chemistry","biochemistry","biology"],"pdf":["http://134.106.242.33/krumbein/htdocs/Archive/397/Krumbein_397.pdf","http://134.106.242.33/krumbein/htdocs/Archive/397/Krumbein_397.pdf","http://www.pnas.org/content/91/21/10173.full.pdf","http://www.pnas.org/content/91/21/10173.full.pdf","http://www.amherst.edu/~jwhagadorn/publications/CSR.pdf","http://www.amherst.edu/~jwhagadorn/publications/CSR.pdf","http://www.springerlink.com/index/WP279834395100KH.pdf","http://www.springerlink.com/index/WP279834395100KH.pdf","http://geomatrixsystems.com/docs/general/Low-Profile-System.pdf","http://geomatrixsystems.com/docs/general/Low-Profile-System.pdf","http://skio.usg.edu:443/publications/pdfs/bender_aquaculture_eng31_73-82.pdf","http://skio.usg.edu:443/publications/pdfs/bender_aquaculture_eng31_73-82.pdf"],"categories":["Archean","Cambrian","Microbiology","Paleontology","Phanerozoic","Proterozoic","Evolutionary
