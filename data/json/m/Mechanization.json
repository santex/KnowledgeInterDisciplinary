In an early engineering text a machine is defined as follows:\n\nâEvery machine is constructed for the purpose of performing certain\nmechanical operations, each of which supposes the existence of two other things\nbesides the machine in question, namely, a moving power, and an object subject\nto the operation, which may be termed the work to be done. Machines, in fact,\nare interposed between the power and the work, for the purpose of adapting the\none to the other.â {{cite book |title= Principles of Mechanism: Designed\nFor The Use Of Students In The Universities And For Engineering Students\nGenerally |last=Willis |first= Robert |coauthors= |year=1861 |publisher =John W.\nParker |location= London |isbn= |pages=\n|url=http://books.google.com/?id=1CCEKSqQaqcC&pg=PA1#v=onepage&q&f=false\n| postscript = }}\n\n\nIn some fields, mechanization includes the use of hand tools. In modern usage,\nsuch as in engineering or economics, mechanization implies machinery more\ncomplex than hand tools and would not include simple devices such as an un-\ngeared horse or donkey mill. Devices that cause speed changes or changes to or\nfrom reciprocating to rotary motion, using means such as gears, pulleys or\nsheaves and belts, shafts, cams and cranks, usually are considered machines.\nAfter electrification, when most small machinery was no longer hand powered,\nmechanization was synonymous with motorized machines. Jerome (1934) gives\nthe industry classification of machine tools as being \"other than hand power\".\nBeginning with the 1900 U.S. census, power use was part of the definition of a\nfactory, distinguishing it from a workshop.\n","linknr":276,"url":"Mechanization","recorded":1362565613,"links":35,"instances":["agriculturist","mechanism","machine"],"pdf":["http://www.nber.org/chapters/c5238.pdf","http://www.nber.org/chapters/c5238.pdf","http://flora.insead.edu/fichiersti_wp/inseadwp2002/2002-52.pdf","http://flora.insead.edu/fichiersti_wp/inseadwp2002/2002-52.pdf"],"categories":["Industry","Agricultural machinery","Armoured warfare"],"headings":["History","Mechanical vs human labour","Levels of Mechanization","See also","References","Bibliography","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/0d/Agricola1.jpg/220px-Agricola1.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/01/Salisbury_02.jpg/200px-Salisbury_02.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c2/Involute_wheel.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["crank","mechanism"],["jethro_tull","agriculturist"],["productivity_improving_technologies","historical"],["crane","machine"],["productivity_improving_technologies","historical#4._mechanization","general_and_in_agriculture"]],"members":["jethro_tull","crank","crane","productivity_improving_technologies"],"related":["De_re_metallica","Georgius_Agricola","British_English","Machine","Gear","Pulley","Line_shaft","Drive_shaft","Cam","Crank_(mechanism)","Trip_hammer","De_re_Metallica","Clock","Machine_tools","De_re_Metallica","Epicycloid","Involute_gear","Newcomen_steam_engine","John_Smeaton","Industrial_Revolution","Spinning_jenny","Water_frame","Machine_tool","Paper_machine","Continuous_production","Seed_drill","Jethro_Tull_(agriculturist)","Mechanized_agriculture","Reaper","Threshing_machine","Combine_harvester","Servomechanism","Feedback_control","Electrification","Material_handling","Mechanized_agriculture","Productivity_improving_technologies_(historical)","List_of_agricultural_machinery","Trip_hammer","Crusher","Ball_mill","Bulk_material_handling","Crane_(machine)","Concrete_mixer","Concrete_pump","Cherry_picker","Electrification","Line_shaft","Machine_tools","Automation","Mass_production","Caterpillar_track","Armoured_fighting_vehicle","Armoured_personnel_carrier","Infantry","Airborne_forces","Wärtsilä-Sulzer_RTA96-C","Automation","Mass_production","Assembly_line","Mechanized_agriculture","Bulk_materials_handling"]}
