Furthermore, the measure of the empty set is\n required to be 0.]]\n\nIn mathematical analysis, a 'measure' on a set is a systematic way to assign a\nnumber to each suitable subset of that set, intuitively interpreted as its size.\nIn this sense, a measure is a generalization of the concepts of length, area,\nand volume. A particularly important example is the Lebesgue measure on a\nEuclidean space, which assigns the conventional length, area, and volume of\nEuclidean geometry to suitable subsets of the <math>n</math>-dimensional\nEuclidean space <math>\\mathbb{R}^n</math>. For instance, the Lebesgue measure of\nthe interval <math>\\left[0, 1\\right]</math> in the real numbers is its length in\nthe everyday sense of the word&thinsp;–&thinsp;specifically, 1.\n\nTechnically, a measure is a function that assigns a non-negative real number or\n+∞ to (certain) subsets of a set <math>X</math> (see Definition below). It must\nassign 0 to the empty set and be (countably) additive: the measure of a 'large'\nsubset that can be decomposed into a finite (or countable) number of 'smaller'\ndisjoint subsets, is the sum of the measures of the \"smaller\" subsets. In\ngeneral, if one wants to associate a consistent size to each subset of a given\nset while satisfying the other axioms of a measure, one only finds trivial\nexamples like the counting measure. This problem was resolved by defining\nmeasure only on a sub-collection of all subsets; the so-called measurable\nsubsets, which are required to form a <math>\\sigma</math>-algebra. This means\nthat countable unions, countable intersections and complements of measurable\nsubsets are measurable. Non-measurable sets in a Euclidean space, on which the\nLebesgue measure cannot be defined consistently, are necessarily complicated in\nthe sense of being badly mixed up with their complement. Indeed, their existence\nis a non-trivial consequence of the axiom of choice.\n\nMeasure theory was developed in successive stages during the late\n19<sup>th</sup> and early 20<sup>th</sup> centuries by Émile Borel, Henri\nLebesgue, Johann Radon and Maurice Fréchet, among others. The main applications\nof measures are in the foundations of the Lebesgue integral, in Andrey\nKolmogorov's axiomatisation of probability theory and in ergodic theory. In\nintegration theory, specifying a measure allows one to define integrals on\nspaces more general than subsets of Euclidean space; moreover, the integral with\nrespect to the Lebesgue measure on Euclidean spaces is more general and has a\nricher theory than its predecessor, the Riemann integral. Probability theory\nconsiders measures that assign to the whole set the size 1, and considers\nmeasurable subsets to be events whose probability is given by the measure.\nErgodic theory considers measures that are invariant under, or arise naturally\nfrom, a dynamical system.\n","title":"Measure%20%28mathematics%29","headings":["Definition","Properties","Sigma-finite measures","Completeness","Additivity","Examples","Non-measurable sets","Generalizations","See also","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["4: Lebesgue_measure","3: Counting_measure","3: Axiom_of_choice","3: Radon_measure","2: Subset","2: Empty_set","2: Euclidean_space","2: Extended_real_number_line","2: Sigma-algebra","2: Probability_theory","2: Ergodic_theory","2: Countable","2: Probability_space","2: Real_number","2: Hausdorff_measure","1: Mathematical_analysis","1: Length","1: Area","1: Volume","1: Euclidean_geometry","1: Real_line","1: Countably","1: Non-measurable_set","1: Ãmile_Borel","1: Henri_Lebesgue","1: Johann_Radon","1: Maurice_FrÃ©chet","1: Lebesgue_integral","1: Andrey_Kolmogorov","1: Axiomatisation","1: Integral","1: Riemann_integral","1: Dynamical_system","1: Sigma_additivity","1: Disjoint_sets","1: Function_composition","1: Tuple","1: Probability_measure","1: Topological_space","1: Locally_convex_space","1: Continuous_function","1: Nicolas_Bourbaki","1: Monotonic_function","1: Subadditivity","1: Closed_interval","1: Integer","1: LindelÃ¶f_space","1: Symmetric_difference","1: Translational_invariance","1: Angle","1: Rotation","1: Hyperbolic_angle","1: Squeeze_mapping","1: Haar_measure","1: Locally_compact_space","1: Topological_group","1: Unit_interval","1: Probability_axioms","1: Dirac_delta_function","1: Indicator_function","1: Borel_measure","1: Jordan_measure","1: Ergodic_measure","1: Euler_measure","1: Gaussian_measure","1: Baire_measure","1: Young_measure","1: Mass","1: Gravity_potential","1: Extensive_property","1: Conserved_quantity","1: Conservation_law","1: Gibbs_measure","1: Canonical_ensemble","1: Lebesgue_measurable","1: Vitali_set","1: Hausdorff_paradox","1: BanachâTarski_paradox","1: Set_function","1: Complex_number","1: Banach_spaces","1: Hilbert_space","1: Functional_analysis","1: Spectral_theorem","1: Conical_combination","1: Linear_combination","1: Banach_limit","1: Lp_space","1: StoneâÄech_compactification","1: Signed_measure","1: Abelian_von_Neumann_algebra","1: Almost_everywhere","1: CarathÃ©odory's_extension_theorem","1: Fubini's_theorem","1: Fuzzy_measure_theory","1: Geometric_measure_theory","1: Inner_measure","1: Lebesgue_integration","1: Lifting_theory","1: Measurable_function","1: Outer_measure","1: Product_measure","1: Pushforward_measure","1: Vector_measure","1: Volume_form","1: Measurable_cardinal","1: Robert_G._Bartle","1: Paul_Halmos","1: R._Duncan_Luce","1: Daniell_integral"]}
