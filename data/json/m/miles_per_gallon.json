The vehicle weighed only 135 pounds\n(61.2&nbsp;kg) and was an adaptation of a small gasoline engine originally\ndesigned to power a bicycle.<ref>{{cite journal\n | title = Man and His Machines journal = The World's Work publisher =\n | Doubleday, Page & Co. location = Garden City, New York volume = XXXIII year =\n | 1916 url = http://books.google.com/?id=lPAMVa7esS4C&printsec=toc#PPA223,M1\n | author1 = Page, Walter Hines author2 = Page, Arthur Wilson}}</ref>]]\nThe 'fuel economy' of an automobile is the fuel efficiency relationship between\nthe distance traveled and the amount of fuel consumed by the vehicle.\nConsumption can be expressed in terms of volume of fuel to travel a distance, or\nthe distance travelled per unit volume of fuel consumed. Since fuel consumption\nof vehicles is a great factor in air pollution, and since importation of motor\nfuel can be a large part of a nation's foreign trade, many countries impose\nrequirements for fuel economy. Different measurement cycles are used to\napproximate the actual performance of the vehicle. The energy in fuel is\nrequired to overcome various losses (wind resistance, tire drag, and others) in\npropelling the vehicle, and in providing power to vehicle systems such as\nignition or air conditioning. Various measures can be taken to reduce losses at\neach of the conversions between chemical energy in fuel and kinetic energy of\nthe vehicle. Driver behavior can affect fuel economy; sudden acceleration and\nheavy braking wastes energy.\n",
