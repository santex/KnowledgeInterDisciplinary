Examples of problems might be \"given an integer n, determine whether n is\nprime\", or \"given two numbers x and y, calculate the product x*y\". As the inputs\nget bigger, the amount of computational resources needed to solve a problem will\nincrease. Thus, the resources needed to solve a problem are described in terms\nof asymptotic analysis, by identifying the resources as a function of the length\nor size of the input.\n\nComputational resources are useful because we can study which problems can be\ncomputed in a certain amount of each computational resource. In this way, we can\ndetermine whether algorithms for solving the problem are optimal and we can make\nstatements about an algorithm's efficiency. The set of all of the computational\nproblems that can be solved using a certain amount of a certain computational\nresource is a complexity class, and relationships between different complexity\nclasses are one of the most important topics in complexity theory.\n","linknr":108,"url":"Memory_space","recorded":1362371492,"links":19,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/CDMTCS/chaitin/acm66.pdf","http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/CDMTCS/chaitin/acm66.pdf","http://www.ee.columbia.edu/ln/dvmm/publications/98/daby_eleft_asilomar98.pdf","http://www.ee.columbia.edu/ln/dvmm/publications/98/daby_eleft_asilomar98.pdf"],"categories":["Computational complexity theory","Computational resources|"],"headings":["Describing generally accessible computing equipment","Formal quantification of computing capability","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Computational_complexity_theory","Computational_model","Computational_problem","Computation_time","Asymptotic_analysis","Algorithm","Algorithmic_efficiency","Complexity_class","Utility_computing","Turing_machine","Journal_of_the_ACM"]}
