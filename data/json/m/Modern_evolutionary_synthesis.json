{"cursor":"49229","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nThe 'modern evolutionary synthesis' is a 20th century union of ideas from\nseveral biological specialties which provides a widely accepted account of\nevolution. It is also referred to as the new synthesis, the modern synthesis,\nthe evolutionary synthesis, millennium synthesis and the neo-Darwinian\nsynthesis.\n\nThe synthesis, produced between 1936 and 1947, reflects the consensus about how\nevolution proceeds. The previous development of population genetics,\nbetween 1918 and 1932, was a stimulus, as it showed that Mendelian genetics was\nconsistent with natural selection and gradual evolution. The synthesis is still,\nto a large extent, the current paradigm in evolutionary biology.\n\nThe modern synthesis solved difficulties and confusions caused by the\nspecialisation and poor communication between biologists in the early years of\nthe 20th century. At its heart was the question of whether Mendelian genetics\ncould be reconciled with gradual evolution by means of natural selection. A\nsecond issue was whether the broad-scale changes (macroevolution) seen by\npalaeontologists could be explained by changes seen in local populations\n(microevolution).\n\nThe synthesis included evidence from biologists, trained in genetics, who\nstudied populations in the field and in the laboratory. These studies were\ncrucial to evolutionary theory. The synthesis drew together ideas from several\nbranches of biology which had become separated, particularly genetics, cytology,\nsystematics, botany, morphology, ecology and paleontology.\n\nJulian Huxley invented the term, when he produced his book, [[Evolution: The\nModern Synthesis]] (1942). Other major figures in the modern synthesis include\nR. A. Fisher, Theodosius Dobzhansky, J. B. S. Haldane, Sewall Wright, E. B.\nFord, Ernst Mayr, Bernhard Rensch, Sergei Chetverikov, George Gaylord Simpson,\nand G. Ledyard Stebbins.\n","linknr":873,"url":"Modern_evolutionary_synthesis","recorded":1362483248,"links":51,"instances":["biology","biology","genetics","genetics","biology","fish","genetics","biology"],"pdf":["http://www.sdsc.edu/~shindyal/ejc121304.pdf","http://www.biology-direct.com/content/pdf/1745-6150-2-30.pdf"],"categories":["History
