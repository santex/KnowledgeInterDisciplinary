On May 12, 2010, the\ncurrent version of Microsoft Access 2010 was released by Microsoft in Office\n2010; Microsoft Office Access 2007 was the prior version.\n\nMicrosoft Access stores data in its own format based on the Access Jet Database\nEngine. It can also import or link directly to data stored in other applications\nand databases.\n\nSoftware developers and data architects can use Microsoft Access to develop\napplication software, and \"power users\" can use it to build software\napplications. Like other Office applications, Access is supported by Visual\nBasic for Applications, an object-oriented programming language that can\nreference a variety of objects including DAO (Data Access Objects), ActiveX Data\nObjects, and many other ActiveX components. Visual objects used in forms and\nreports expose their methods and properties in the VBA programming environment,\nand VBA code modules may declare and call Windows operating-system functions.\n","linknr":597,"url":"Microsoft_Access","recorded":1362553383,"links":59,"instances":["computer_science","web","database","sql_server","database","computing","file_format","software_platform","project_management","sql","computer_science","database","computing","computers","database","sql","sql","computer_science"],"pdf":["http://www.fmsinc.com/FMSUpsize/docs/EvolvingMicrosoftAccessApplications.pdf"],"categories":["1992
