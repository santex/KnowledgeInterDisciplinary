It is the first step of digestion and it increases the surface area of\nfoods to allow more efficient break down by enzymes. During the mastication\nprocess, the food is positioned between the teeth for grinding by the cheek and\ntongue. As chewing continues, the food is made softer and warmer, and the\nenzymes in saliva begin to break down carbohydrates in the food. After chewing,\nthe food (now called a bolus) is swallowed. It enters the esophagus and via\nperistalsis continues on to the stomach, where the next step of digestion\noccurs.\n\nPremastication is sometimes performed by human parents for young infants who are\nunable to do so for themselves. The food is masticated in the mouth of the\nparent into a bolus and then transferred to the infant for consumption. \n\nCattle and some other animals, called ruminants, chew food more than once to\nextract more nutrients. After the first round of chewing, this food is\ncalled cud.\n","linknr":245,"url":"Mastication","recorded":1362552132,"links":34,"instances":["tooth","digestion"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Dentistry","Digestive system"],"headings":["Mastication motor program","In other animals","In machinery","See also","Notes","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/14/Macaca_arctoides.png/250px-Macaca_arctoides.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e9/Masticator-usfs_image.jpg/220px-Masticator-usfs_image.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["bolus","digestion"],["molar","tooth"]],"members":["molar","bolus"],"related":["Teeth","Digestion","Enzyme","Cheek","Tongue","Carbohydrates","Bolus_(digestion)","Peristalsis","Premastication","Cattle","Ruminant","Cud","Proprioceptive","Dentures","Parafunctional_habit","Parafunctional_habit","Mammal","Herbivory","Carnivore","Idiom","Ornithopod","Dinosaur","Hadrosaurid","Molar_(tooth)","Incisor","Cretaceous","Sauropoda","Gastrolith","Cretaceousâ€“Paleogene_extinction_event","U.S._Forest_Service","Fireline","Gnathology","Muscles_of_mastication","Neuromuscular_dentistry"]}
