{"cursor":"5964","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nIn Greek mythology, 'Melicertes' (ancient Greek ÎÎµÎ»Î¹ÎºÎ­ÏÏÎ·Ï, sometimes\n'Melecertes', later called 'Palaemon' Î Î±Î»Î±Î¯Î¼ÏÎ½) is the son of the Boeotian\nprince Athamas and Ino, daughter of Cadmus.\n\nIno, pursued by her husband, who had been driven mad by Hera because Ino had\nbrought up the infant Dionysus, threw herself and Melicertes into the sea from a\nhigh rock between Megara and Corinth, Both were changed into marine deities: Ino\nas Leucothea, noted by Homer, Homer, [[Odyssey]], 5.333 Melicertes as\nPalaemon. The body of the latter was carried by a dolphin to the Isthmus of\nCorinth and deposited under a pine tree. Here it was found by his uncle\nSisyphus, who had it removed to Corinth, and by command of the Nereids\ninstituted the Isthmian Games and sacrifices in his honour.\n\nPalaemon appears for the first time in Euripides [[Iphigeneia in Tauris]], where\nhe is already the \"guardian of ships\". Euripides, Iphigeneia in Tauris,\n270. The paramount identification in the Latin poets of the Augustan age\nis with Portunus, the Roman god of safe harbours, memorably in Virgil's\n[[Georgics]]. Virgil, Georgics 1.46: sailors, preserved from the hazards of\nthe sea and safely ashore, give thanks to Melicertes. Ovid twice told the\nstory of Ino's sea-plunge with Melicertes in her arms. Ovid, [[Fasti]]\n6.473ff, and [[Metamorphoses]] 4.416ff.\n\nOvid's treatment in Fasti identifies for the first time as the location the\nIsthmus without literally naming it: A land there is, shrunk within\nnarrow bounds, which repels twin seas, and single in itself, is lashed by two-\nfold waters.\n\nIn later Latin poets there are numerous identifications of Palaemon with the\nsanctuary at the Isthmus, where no archaeological evidence was found for a pre-\nAugustan cult. In the late 2nd century CE, within the sanctuary of Poseidon at\nIsthmia, Pausanias saw a temple of Palaemon, with images in it of\nPoseidon, Leucothea and Palaemon himself. There is also what is called his Holy\nof Holies, and an underground descent to it, where they say that Palaemon is\nconcealed. Whosoever, whether Corinthian or stranger, swears falsely here, can\nby no means escape from his oath. There is also an ancient sanctuary called the\naltar of the Cyclopes, and they sacrifice to the Cyclopes upon\nit. Pausanias, 2.2.1\n\nIn company with Leucothea, Melicertes/Palaemon was widely invoked for protection\nfrom dangers at sea. The Greek Anthology contains several prayers of this\ntype (Loeb Classical Library, vol. I, book 6, nos. 164, 223, 348); Aelius\nAristides (Isthm. in Pos. 49); Nonnus, Dionysiaca 47.354; Orphic Hymns, 74, 75,\nare all noted by Hawthorne 1958:92, note 3.\n\nThere seems considerable doubt whether or not the cult of Melicertes was of\nforeign, probably Phoenician, origin, and introduced by Phoenician navigators on\nthe coasts and islands of the Aegean and Mediterranean. Edouard Will,\nsummarizing the debate in 1955, concluded in Korinthiaka (1955:169 note 3) that\nMelicertes was wholly Greek. For the Hellenes he is a native of Boeotia,\nwhere Phoenician influences were strong; at Tenedos he was propitiated by the\nsacrifice of children which seems to point to his identity with Melqart. The\npremature death of the child in the Greek form of the legend is probably an\nallusion to this.\n\nThe Romans identified Palaemon with Portunus (the harbour god). No satisfactory\norigin of the name Palaemon has been given. It has been suggested that it means\nthe \"wrestler\" or \"struggler\" and is an epithet of Heracles, with whom Melqart\nis identified by [[interpretatio graeca]] and referred to as the Tyrian\n[[Hercules|Herakles]], but there does not appear to be any traditional\nconnection between Heracles and Palaemon. Melicertes being Phoenician, Palaemon\nalso has been explained as the \"burning lord\" (Baal-haman), but there seems\nlittle in common between a god of the sea and a god of fire.\n\nIn 1956 excavations at Isthmia by the University of Chicago under the direction\nof Oscar Broneer uncovered the small sanctuary of Palaimon, which eventually had\na tiny Roman round temple in the Corinthian order, which appeared on coins of\nCorinth in the 2nd century CE; it was the successor to two previous more modest\narchitectural phases of the sanctuary. The foundations of the temple were found\nto lie over the starting-line of a late 5th or early 4th century BCE stadium.\nWorship was characterized by the dedication of hundreds of wheelmade oil lamps\nof a distinct type. The completed excavation was published by Broneer in\nHesperia '27' (1958:1-57). A cult of Melicertes of great antiquity,\npossibly based on pre-Hellenic figures of Ino and Melicertes, was posited by\nEdouard Will just previous to the site's discovery Will, in Korinthiaka (1955:168-\n80, 210-12. and refuted by John Hawthorne in 1958. Hawthorne, \"The\nMyth of Palaemon\", Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological\nAssociation '89' (1958:92-98). The archaeologists found evidence of bull\nsacrifice and a tub which may have been filled with water in an initiation rite\nfor members. This further cements the connection of Melicertes with the\ncorinthian games, one of the four major athletic festivals in Greece, the most\nfamous of which is the Olympian Games.
