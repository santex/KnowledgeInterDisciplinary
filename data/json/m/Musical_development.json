It refers to the transformation\nand restatement of initial material, and is often contrasted with musical\nvariation, which is a slightly different means to the same end. Development is\ncarried out upon portions of material treated in many different presentations\nand combinations at a time, while variation depends upon one type of\npresentation at a time. Wennerstrom, Mary (1975). \"Form in Twentieth-Century\nMusic\" (chap. 1), Aspects of Twentieth-Century Music. Wittlich, Gary (ed.).\nEnglewood Cliffs, New Jersey: Prentice-Hall. ISBN 0-13-049346-5.\n\nIn this process, certain central ideas are repeated in different contexts or in\naltered form so that the mind of the listener consciously or unconsciously\ncompares the various incarnations of these ideas. Listeners may apprehend a\n\"tension between expected and real results\" (see irony), which is one \"element\nof surprise\" in music. This practice has its roots in counterpoint, where a\ntheme or subject might create an impression of a pleasing or affective sort, but\nwould go on to delight the mind further as its contrapuntal capabilities are\ngradually unveiled.\n\nThe musical form which traditionally exploits development to the fullest is the\nsonata form. In this form there is a section after the [[exposition\n(music)|exposition]] and before the [[recapitulation (music)|recapitulation]]\nwhich is called the development section, where material from the exposition\nsection is developed. In some older texts the development section of a sonata\nmay be referred to as \"free fantasia.\"\n","linknr":149,"url":"Musical_development","recorded":1362477578,"links":22,"instances":["music","music","music","music"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Musical development","Formal sections in music analysis"],"headings":["See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/04/Development_Haydn%27s_Sonata_in_G_Major.png/350px-Development_Haydn%27s_Sonata_in_G_Major.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/Loudspeaker.svg/11px-Loudspeaker.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c5/FClef.svg/40px-FClef.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["transformation","music"],["theme","music"],["variation","music"],["fugue","music#the_development"],["sequence","music"]],"members":["variation","sequence","fugue","theme","transformation"],"related":["Sonata_in_G_Major","Hoboken-Verzeichnis","Classical_music","Idea","Piece","Transformation_(music)","Theme_(music)","Variation_(music)","Irony","Counterpoint","Musical_form","Sonata_form","Developing_variation","Sequence_(music)"]}
