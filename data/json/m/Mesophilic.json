Willey, Joanne M., Linda Sherwood, Christopher J. Woolverton, and\nLansing M. Prescott. Prescott, Harley, and Klein's Microbiology. New York: McGraw-\nHill Higher Education, 2008. Print. The term is mainly applied to\nmicroorganisms.\n\nThe habitats of these organisms include especially cheese, yogurt, and mesophile\norganisms are often included in the process of beer and wine making.\n\nOrganisms that prefer cold environments are termed psychrophilic, those\npreferring warmer temperatures are termed thermophilic and those thriving in\nextremely hot environments are hyperthermophilic. All bacteria have their own\noptimum environmental surroundings and temperatures in which they thrive the\nmost. A genome-wide computational approach has been designed by Zheng, et al. to\nclassify bacteria into mesophilic and thermophilic. Hao Zheng and Hongwei\nWu.
