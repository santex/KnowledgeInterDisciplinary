The most\nobvious developments have been procedures developed to allow anastomosis of\nsuccessively smaller blood vessels and nerves (typically 1 mm in diameter)\nwhich have allowed transfer of tissue from one part of the body to another and\nre-attachment of severed parts. Although microsurgery is used mostly in plastic\nsurgery, microsurgical techniques are utilized by several specialties today,\nespecially those involved in reconstructive surgery such as: general surgery,\nophthalmology, orthopedic surgery, gynecological surgery, otolaryngology,\nneurosurgery, oral and maxillofacial surgery, and pediatric surgery.\n","linknr":189,"url":"Microsurgery","recorded":1362505223,"links":22,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Surgery","Oral and maxillofacial surgery","Plastic surgery"],"headings":["History","Free tissue transfer","Replantation","Transplantation","External links","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/Needle_through_hair.jpg/230px-Needle_through_hair.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7c/Foot_Laser_Surgery.jpg/220px-Foot_Laser_Surgery.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/5e/Footwound.JPG/120px-Footwound.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/30/Footwound2.JPG/120px-Footwound2.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Surgery","Operating_microscope","Anastomosis","Plastic_surgery","Reconstructive_surgery","General_surgery","Ophthalmology","Orthopedic_surgery","Gynecological_surgery","Otolaryngology","Neurosurgery","Oral_and_maxillofacial_surgery","Pediatric_surgery","Neurosurgery","William_House","Gazi_Yasargil","Burlington,_Vermont","Zürich","Plastic_surgeon","Harry_J._Buncke","Rabbit","Plastic_surgeons","Fibula","Free_flap","Finger","Thumb","Ear","Scalp","Human_nose","Face","Arm","Penis","Artery","Vein"]}
