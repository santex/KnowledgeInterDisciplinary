Four identical sculptures are located in Buffalo City, South Africa;\nChangchun, China; Sarajevo, Bosnia and Sydney, Australia]] 'Multiculturalism'\n(or 'ethnic diversity') relates to communities containing multiple cultures. The\nterm is used in two broad ways, either descriptively or normatively. As a descriptive term, it usually refers to the simple\nfact of cultural diversity: it is generally applied to the demographic make-up\nof a specific place, sometime at the organizational level, e.g. schools,\nbusinesses, neighbourhoods, cities, or nations. As a normative term, it refers\nto ideologies or policies that promote this diversity or its\ninstitutionalisation; in this sense, multiculturalism is a society âat ease with\nthe rich tapestry of human life and the desire amongst people to express their\nown identity in the manner they see fit.â Such\nideologies or policies vary widely, including country to country, ranging from the advocacy of equal respect to the\nvarious cultures in a society, to a policy of promoting the maintenance of\ncultural diversity, to policies in which people of various ethnic and religious\ngroups are addressed by the authorities as defined by the group they belong\nto. However, two main different and\nseemingly inconsistent strategies have developed through different Government\npolicies and strategies:\nThe first focuses on interaction and communication between different cultures.\nInteractions of cultures provide opportunities for the cultural differences to\ncommunicate and interact to create multiculturalism. (Such approaches are also\noften known as interculturalism.) The second centers on diversity and cultural\nuniqueness. Cultural isolation can protect the uniqueness of the local culture\nof a nation or area and also contribute to global cultural diversity. A common\naspect of many policies following the second approach is that they avoid\npresenting any specific ethnic, religious, or cultural community values as\ncentral.\n\nMulticulturalism is often contrasted with the concepts of assimilationism and\nhas been described as a \"salad bowl\" or \"cultural mosaic\" rather than a \"melting\npot\".\n","linknr":1522,"url":"Multiculturalism","recorded":1362555774,"links":100,"instances":["malaysia","ethnic_group","personal_and_cultural","germany","political_philosophy","polity","ethnic_group","malaysia","uk","1991","cultural_idea","ethnic_group","film_director"],"pdf":["http://www.unu.edu/dialogue/papers/claval-s2.pdf","http://www.unu.edu/dialogue/papers/claval-s2.pdf","http://www.geography.ryerson.ca/jmaurer/030_108art/030Multiculturalism.pdf","http://www.geography.ryerson.ca/jmaurer/030_108art/030Multiculturalism.pdf","http://www.immi.gov.au/media/publications/research/_pdf/poa-2008.pdf","http://www.immi.gov.au/media/publications/research/_pdf/poa-2008.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20030316104007/http://www.apmab.gov.au/guide/religious/religious.pdf","http://www.apmab.gov.au/guide/religious/religious.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20030316104007/http://www.apmab.gov.au/guide/religious/religious.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20050619070219/http://www.apmab.gov.au/guide/religious2/religious_guide.pdf","http://www.apmab.gov.au/guide/religious2/religious_guide.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20050619070219/http://www.apmab.gov.au/guide/religious2/religious_guide.pdf","http://www.hawaii.edu/hivandaids/Racism,_Ethnicity_and_Hate_Crime.pdf","http://www.hawaii.edu/hivandaids/Racism,_Ethnicity_and_Hate_Crime.pdf","http://www.coe.int/t/dg4/cultureheritage/culture/cities/index/Mexico_en.pdf","http://www.miami.edu/eucenter/Boening_EuroIslam_EUMA2007edi.pdf","http://www.miami.edu/eucenter/Boening_EuroIslam_EUMA2007edi.pdf","http://www.ceibs.edu/ase/Documents/diplomacy06.pdf","http://www.fep.um.edu.my/working%20papers/2001/FEA-WP-2001-003.pdf","http://minorityaffairs.gov.in/sites/upload_files/moma/files/pdfs/sachar_comm.pdf","http://minorityaffairs.gov.in/sites/upload_files/moma/files/pdfs/sachar_comm.pdf","http://www.imi.ox.ac.uk/pdfs/SC%20paper%20on%20MC%20soc%20for%20GHFR%20Korea%202007.pdf","http://www.brill.nl/downloads/ToC-Duchesne-SCSS-28.pdf","http://www.brill.nl/downloads/ToC-Duchesne-SCSS-28.pdf"],"categories":["Identity
