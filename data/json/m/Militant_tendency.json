According to Michael\nCrick, its politics were influenced by Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, Vladimir\nLenin and Leon Trotsky and \"virtually nobody else\". Crick The March of\nMilitant, p.3\n\nIn 1982, a Labour Party commission found Militant in contravention of clause II,\nsection 3 of the party's constitution, and declared it ineligible for\naffiliation to the Labour Party. In 1983, the five members of the Editorial\nBoard of the Militant newspaper were expelled from the Labour Party. At this\npoint the group claimed internally to have about 4,300 members, a figure which\nmay be generous. Crick, p.315\n\nMilitant played a leading role in Liverpool City Council between 1983 and 1987\nwhen 47 councillors were banned and surcharged. Crick The March of Militant, p.229 Forty-nine councillors were\ninitially subject to surcharge, but two councillors subsequently died during the\nprocess, and the group was termed the Liverpool 47.\nhttp://www.liverpool47.org From 1983, a series of moves led by the Labour\nParty's National Executive Committee and leader Neil Kinnock led to the\nexpulsion of prominent members of the group, and the eventual loss of Militant's\nthree Labour MPs. These actions ended Militant's influence within the Party.\n\nBetween 1989 and 1991 Militant led the All-Britain Anti-Poll Tax Federation's\nnon-payment campaign against the Community Charge ('poll tax'). In 1991,\nMilitant decided by a large majority to abandon entryism in the Labour Party.\nTed Grant, once the group's most important member, was expelled, and his\nbreakaway minority, now known as Socialist Appeal, continued with the entryist\nstrategy. The majority changed its name to Militant Labour, and then in 1997 to\nthe Socialist Party.\n","linknr":455,"url":"Militant_tendency","recorded":1362675202,"links":15,"instances":["politician","england_and_wales","british_politician","uk","uk_parliament_constituency","united_states","uk","sanction","uk_parliament_constituency"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Committee for a Workers' International","Labour Party (UK) breakaway groups","Militant tendency|","Socialism in the United Kingdom","Trotskyist organisations of the United Kingdom"],"headings":["Origins","Early editions of ''Militant''","The 1970s","Militant in the 1980s","The Poll Tax","The Open Turn","See also","Notes and references","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Militant.gif/220px-Militant.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["labour_party","uk"],["surcharge","sanction"],["socialist_appeal","uk,_1992"],["socialist_party","england_and_wales"],["revolutionary_communist_party","uk,_1944"],["revolutionary_socialist_league","uk,_1957"],["socialist_workers_party","united_states"],["labour_party","uk"],["liverpool_walton","uk_parliament_constituency"],["revolutionary_socialist_league","uk,_1957"],["coventry_south_east","uk_parliament_constituency"],["john_golding","british_politician"],["conservative_party","uk"],["alan_woods","political_theorist"],["socialist_party","england_and_wales"],["alan_woods","politician"]],"members":["alan_woods","socialist_party","john_golding","conservative_party","liverpool_walton","socialist_appeal","revolutionary_communist_party","revolutionary_socialist_league","socialist_workers_party","labour_party","surcharge","coventry_south_east"],"related":["Trotskyism","Entryism","Labour_Party_(UK)","Michael_Crick","Karl_Marx","Friedrich_Engels","Vladimir_Lenin","Leon_Trotsky","Liverpool_City_Council","Surcharge_(sanction)","National_Executive_Committee","Neil_Kinnock","All-Britain_Anti-Poll_Tax_Federation","Community_Charge","Ted_Grant","Socialist_Appeal_(UK,_1992)","Socialist_Party_(England_and_Wales)","Workers_International_League","Revolutionary_Communist_Party_(UK,_1944)","Revolutionary_Socialist_League_(UK,_1957)","Leon_Trotsky","Jimmy_Deane","Ted_Grant","Peter_Taaffe","Socialist_Workers_Party_(United_States)","United_Kingdom_general_election,_1964","Peter_Taaffe","Labour_Party_(UK)","Incomes_policy","Peter_Taaffe","International_Marxist_Group","Committee_for_a_Workers'_International","Cammell_Laird","Social_Democratic_Federation","Liverpool_Walton_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","Bessie_Braddock","Liverpool,_Exchange","Ted_Grant","Woodrow_Wyatt","English_Electric","Harland_and_Wolff","Litherland","Father_of_the_Chapel","Revolutionary_Socialist_League_(UK,_1957)","Independent_Labour_Party","Labour_Party_Young_Socialists","Pat_Wall","Clause_Four_Group","Henry_Underhill,_Baron_Underhill","Eric_Heffer","National_Executive_Committee","Tony_Benn","Alexander_Kerensky","Zinoviev_letter","Reg_Prentice,_Baron_Prentice","Pentonville_Five","James_Callaghan","Michael_Davie","International_Monetary_Fund","Mujahadeen","Poplar_Rates_Rebellion","Rate-capping_rebellion","Derek_Hatton","Militant_tendency","Labour_Party_Young_Socialists","Socialist_Youth_Newspaper_of_the_Labour_Party_Young_Socialists","Labour_Co-ordinating_Committee","Campaign_for_Labour_Party_Democracy","Ken_Livingstone","Peter_Taaffe","Ted_Grant","Lynn_Walsh","Terry_Fields","Liverpool_Broadgreen","Dave_Nellist","Coventry_South_East_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","Neil_Kinnock","Labour_Party_Conference","Eric_Heffer","Derek_Hatton","Dennis_Skinner","Peter_Kilfoyle","Michael_Meacher","Tony_Benn","John_Golding_(British_politician)","Terry_Fields","Lesley_Mahmood","Liverpool_Walton_by-election,_1991","Community_Charge","Terry_Fields","Tommy_Sheridan","All-Britain_Anti-Poll_Tax_Federation","Poll_Tax_Riots","Terry_Fields","Dave_Nellist","Coventry_South_East","Tommy_Sheridan","Pollok","City_of_Glasgow","United_Kingdom_general_election,_1992","Conservative_Party_(UK)","Scottish_National_Party","Lesley_Mahmood","Alan_Woods_(political_theorist)","International_Marxist_Tendency","International_Marxist_Tendency","Socialist_Party_(England_and_Wales)","Committee_for_a_Workers'_International","Scottish_Socialist_Party","Socialist_Appeal","Socialism","Marxism","Alan_Woods_(politician)","International_Marxist_Tendency","Modern_Records_Centre,_University_of_Warwick"]}
