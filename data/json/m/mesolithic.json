The term developed as a catch-\nall to refer to material that did not fit into the other categories of\nprehistory. The term \"Epipaleolithic\" is often used for areas outside northern\nEurope but was also the preferred synonym used by French archaeologists until\nthe 1960s.\n\nThe term is used to refer to different time spans in different parts of Eurasia.\nIt was first used to refer to post-Pleistocene but pre-agricultural material in\nnorthwest Europe about 10,000 to 5000&nbsp;BCE but is also applied to material\nfrom the Levant (about 20,000 to 9500&nbsp;BCE); in Japan the Jōmon period\n(about 14,000 to 400&nbsp;BCE) is sometimes called Mesolithic.\n",
