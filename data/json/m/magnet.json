      "text" : "\n\n, an iron alloy. The magnet is made in the shape of a horseshoe to bring the two\nmagnetic poles close to each other, to create a strong magnetic field there that\ncan pick up heavy pieces of iron]] of a solenoid electromagnet, which are\nsimilar to a bar magnet as illustrated above with the iron filings]]\n\n\nA 'magnet' (from Greek {{transl|grc|[[wiktionary:magnḗtis|magnḗtis]]\n[[wiktionary:líthos|líthos]]}}, \"Magnesian stone\") is a material or object that\nproduces a magnetic field. This magnetic field is invisible but is responsible\nfor the most notable property of a magnet: a force that pulls on other\nferromagnetic materials, such as iron, and attracts or repels other magnets.\n\nA 'permanent magnet' is an object made from a material that is magnetized and\ncreates its own persistent magnetic field. An everyday example is a refrigerator\nmagnet used to hold notes on a refrigerator door. Materials that can be\nmagnetized, which are also the ones that are strongly attracted to a magnet, are\ncalled ferromagnetic (or ferrimagnetic). These include iron, nickel, cobalt,\nsome alloys of rare earth metals, and some naturally occurring minerals such as\nlodestone. Although ferromagnetic (and ferrimagnetic) materials are the only\nones attracted to a magnet strongly enough to be commonly considered magnetic,\nall other substances respond weakly to a magnetic field, by one of several other\ntypes of magnetism.\n\nFerromagnetic materials can be divided into magnetically \"soft\" materials like\nannealed iron, which can be magnetized but do not tend to stay magnetized, and\nmagnetically \"hard\" materials, which do. Permanent magnets are made from \"hard\"\nferromagnetic materials such as alnico and ferrite that are subjected to special\nprocessing in a powerful magnetic field during manufacture, to align their\ninternal microcrystalline structure, making them very hard to demagnetize. To\ndemagnetize a saturated magnet, a certain magnetic field must be applied, and\nthis threshold depends on coercivity of the respective material. \"Hard\"\nmaterials have high coercivity, whereas \"soft\" materials have low coercivity.\n\nAn electromagnet is made from a coil of wire that acts as a magnet when an\nelectric current passes through it but stops being a magnet when the current\nstops. Often, the coil is wrapped around a core of \"soft\" ferromagnetic material\nsuch as steel, which greatly enhances the magnetic field produced by the coil.\n\nThe overall strength of a magnet is measured by its magnetic moment or,\nalternatively, the total magnetic flux it produces. The local strength of\nmagnetism in a material is measured by its magnetization.\n",
