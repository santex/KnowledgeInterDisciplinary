{"cursor":"5559","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nIn aeronautics, 'chord' refers to the imaginary straight line joining the\nleading and trailing edges of an airfoil. The chord length is the\ndistance between the trailing edge and the point on the leading edge\nwhere the chord intersects the leading edge. Clancy,\nL.J. (1975), Aerodynamics, Section 5.2, Pitman Publishing Limited,\nLondon. ISBN 0-273-01120-0\n\nThe point on the leading edge which is used to define the chord can be defined\nas either the surface point of minimum radius,\np.18 or the surface point which will yield maximum chord length.\n\nThe wing, horizontal stabilizer, vertical stabilizer and propeller of an\naircraft are all based on airfoil sections, and the term chord or chord\nlength is also used to describe their width. The chord of a wing, stabilizer\nand propeller is determined by examining the planform and measuring the\ndistance between leading and trailing edges in the direction of the airflow.\n(If a wing has a rectangular planform, rather than tapered or swept, then the\nchord is simply the width of the wing measured in the direction of airflow.)\nThe term chord is also applied to the width of wing flaps, ailerons and\nrudder on an aircraft.\n\nThe term is also applied to airfoils in gas turbine engines such as turbojet,\nturboprop, or turbofan engines for aircraft propulsion.\n\nMost wings do not have a rectangular planform so they have a different 'chord'\nat different positions along their span. To give a characteristic figure which\ncan be compared among various wing shapes, the mean aerodynamic chord, or MAC,\nis used. The MAC is somewhat more complex to calculate, because most wings vary\nin 'chord' over the span, growing narrower towards the outer tips. This means\nthat more lift is generated on the wider inner portions, and the MAC moves the\npoint to measure the chord to take this into account.\n","linknr":153,"url":"Mean_Aerodynamic_Chord","recorded":1362477066,"links":21,"instances":["wing","force","fluid_mechanics","aircraft","aircraft"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Aerospace engineering","Aircraft wing design"],"headings":["Standard mean chord","Mean aerodynamic chord","Tapered wing","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/Chord_length_definition_%28en%29.svg/400px-Chord_length_definition_%28en%29.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/Aircraft_chord.svg/400px-Aircraft_chord.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/3/8/038450dd1eb2e7410d83adc446c6d711.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/4/4/544e90b040bbca28245a322f010ef3cb.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/9/5/8955c3e11f2621c738bce29c6cde9caa.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/0/5/e05a30d96800384dd38b22851322a6b5.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/3/3/4334b4c70b652e6e030d0cdda9c83bc9.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/9/0/e90f15344573a004cdc128810a833403.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["propeller","aircraft"],["flap","aircraft"],["lift","force"],["center_of_pressure","fluid_mechanics"],["aspect_ratio","wing"]],"members":["aspect_ratio","lift","center_of_pressure","flap","propeller"],"related":["Aeronautics","Airfoil","Wing","Horizontal_stabilizer","Vertical_stabilizer","Propeller_(aircraft)","Planform","Flap_(aircraft)","Ailerons","Rudder","Gas_turbine","Planform","Wingspan","Lift_(force)","Aerodynamics","Aerodynamic_force","Center_of_pressure_(fluid_mechanics)","Angle_of_attack","Center_of_mass","Aspect_ratio_(wing)","Lift-induced_drag","Glider_aircraft","Taper_ratio"]}
