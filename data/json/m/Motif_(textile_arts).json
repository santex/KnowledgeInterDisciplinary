In knitting and crochet, motifs are made one at a\ntime and joined together to create larger works such as afghan blankets or\nshawls. A good example of a motif is the granny square. Motifs may be varied or\nrotated for contrast and variety, or to create new shapes, as with 'quilt\nblocks' in quilts and quilting. Contrast with motifless crazy quilting.\n\nMotifs can be any size, but usually all the motifs in any given work are the\nsame size. The patterns and stitches used in a motif may vary greatly, but there\nis almost always some unifying element, such as texture, stitch pattern, or\ncolour, which gives the finished piece more aesthetic appeal. Motifs may\ncommemorate events or convey information or political slogans. For example the\nindividual blocks of the AIDS Memorial Quilt, the possible Quilts of the\nUnderground Railroad, and the \"54-40 or Fight\" quilt\nblock. \"[http://earlywomenmasters.net/quilts/f/54_40/index.html 54-40 or\nFight]\", Antique Geometric Quilt Designs.\n","linknr":108,"url":"Motif_(textile_arts)","recorded":1362566378,"links":20,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Textile arts"],"headings":["See also","Sources"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/Granny_square.jpg/200px-Granny_square.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf8/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e5/Square-in-a-square_quilt_block.png/100px-Square-in-a-square_quilt_block.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f4/Kitchen_kaleid.PNG/100px-Kitchen_kaleid.PNG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/Loudspeaker.svg/11px-Loudspeaker.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8b/Sampler_by_Elizabeth_Laidman_1760_detail_small.jpg/35px-Sampler_by_Elizabeth_Laidman_1760_detail_small.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Crochet_hook","Textile_arts","Knitting","Crochet","Afghan_blanket","Granny_square","Quilt","Quilting","Crazy_quilting","AIDS_Memorial_Quilt","Quilts_of_the_Underground_Railroad","Oregon_boundary_dispute","Tessellation"]}
