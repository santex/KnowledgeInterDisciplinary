The company was founded by Bill\nGates and Paul Allen on April 4, 1975. Microsoft is the world's largest software\nmaker measured by revenues.<ref></ref> It is also one of the world's most\nvaluable companies.<ref></ref>\n\nMicrosoft was established to develop and sell BASIC interpreters for the Altair\n8800. It rose to dominate the personal computer operating system market with MS-\nDOS in the mid-1980s, followed by the Microsoft Windows line of operating\nsystems. The company's 1986 initial public offering, and subsequent rise in its\nshare price, created an estimated three billionaires and 12,000 millionaires\nfrom Microsoft employees. Since the 1990s, it has increasingly diversified from\nthe operating system market and has made a number of corporate acquisitions. In\nMay 2011, Microsoft acquired Skype Technologies for $8.5 billion in its largest\nacquisition to date.<ref></ref>\n\nAs of 2013, Microsoft is market dominant in both the PC operating system and\noffice suite markets (the latter with Microsoft Office). The company also\nproduces a wide range of other software for desktops and servers, and is active\nin areas including internet search (with Bing), the video game industry (with\nthe Xbox and Xbox 360 consoles, and the upcoming Xbox One console), the digital\nservices market (through MSN), and mobile phones (via the Windows Phone OS). In\nJune 2012, Microsoft announced that it would be entering the PC vendor market\nfor the first time, with the launch of the Microsoft Surface tablet computer.\n\nIn the 1990s, critics began to contend that Microsoft used monopolistic business\npractices and anti-competitive strategies including refusal to deal and tying,\nput unreasonable restrictions in the use of its software, and used\nmisrepresentative marketing tactics; both the U.S. Department of Justice and\nEuropean Commission found the company in violation of antitrust laws.\n","title":"microsoft","headings":["History","Product divisions","Culture","Criticism","Corporate affairs","See also","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["5: Bill_Gates","3:
