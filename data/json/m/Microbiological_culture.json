{"cursor":"6937","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'']] A 'microbiological culture', or 'microbial culture', is a method of\nmultiplying microbial organisms by letting them reproduce in predetermined\nculture media under controlled laboratory conditions. Microbial cultures are\nused to determine the type of organism, its abundance in the sample being\ntested, or both. It is one of the primary diagnostic methods of microbiology and\nused as a tool to determine the cause of infectious disease by letting the agent\nmultiply in a predetermined medium. For example, a throat culture is taken by\nscraping the lining of tissue in the back of the throat and blotting the sample\ninto a medium to be able to screen for harmful microorganisms, such as\n[[Streptococcus pyogenes]], the causative agent of strep throat. http://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/throat-\nculture Furthermore, the term culture is more generally used informally to\nrefer to \"selectively growing\" a specific kind of microorganism in the lab\n\nMicrobial cultures are foundational and basic diagnostic methods used\nextensively as a research tool in molecular biology. It is often essential to\nisolate a pure culture of microorganisms. A pure (or axenic) culture is a\npopulation of cells or multicellular organisms growing in the absence of other\nspecies or types. A pure culture may originate from a single cell or single\norganism, in which case the cells are genetic clones of one another.\n\nFor the purpose of gelling the microbial culture, the medium of agarose gel\n(agar) is used. Agar is a gelatinous substance derived from seaweed. A cheap\nsubstitute for agar is guar gum, which can be used for the isolation and\nmaintenance of thermophiles.\n","linknr":261,"url":"Microbiological_culture","recorded":1362505897,"links":33,"instances":["biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Microbiology techniques","Microbiology terms","Cell culture"],"headings":["Bacterial culture","Virus and phage culture","Eukaryotic cell culture","References","External links","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/40/Anthrax_culture.jpg/200px-Anthrax_culture.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cell","biology"]],"members":["cell"],"related":["Microorganism","Culture_media","Medical_diagnosis","Microbiology","Infectious_disease","Throat_culture","Molecular_biology","Cell_(biology)","Multicellular_organisms","Species","Clones","Agar","Seaweed","Guar_gum","Thermophiles","Petri_dish","Antimicrobial_peptides","American_Type_Culture_Collection","Manassas","Virginia","National_Collection_of_Type_Cultures","Health_Protection_Agency","United_Kingdom","Belgian_Co-ordinated_Collections_of_Micro-organisms","Ghent","Belgium","Paris","France","Deutsche_Sammlung_von_Mikroorganismen_und_Zellkulturen","Braunschweig","Germany","Japan_Collection_of_Microorganisms","Saitama,_Saitama","Japan","Utrecht","Netherlands","Aberdeen","Scotland","Valencia","Spain","Bacteriophage","Virus","Fungi","Algae","Metazoa","Agar_plate","Microbial_Food_Cultures","Blood_culture","Sputum_culture","Screening_cultures","Synchronous_culture","NCPPB","International_Collection_of_Microorganisms_from_Plants","Deutsche_Sammlung_von_Mikroorganismen_und_Zellkulturen"]}
