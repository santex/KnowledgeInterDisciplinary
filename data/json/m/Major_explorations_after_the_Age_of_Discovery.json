{"cursor":"35617","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Major explorations' continued 'after the [[Age of Discovery]]'. By the early\nseventeenth century, vessels were sufficiently well built and their navigators\ncompetent enough to travel to virtually anywhere on the planet by sea. In the\n17th century Dutch explorers such as Willem Jansz and Abel Tasman explored the\ncoasts of Australia. Spanish expeditions from Peru explored the South Pacific\nand discovered archipelagos such as Vanuatu and the Pitcairn Islands. Luis Vaez\nde Torres chartered the coasts of New Guinea and the Solomon Islands, and\ndiscovered the strait that bears his name. European naval exploration mapped the\nWestern and northern coasts of Australia, but the east coast had to wait for\nover a century, while in the eighteenth century it was British explorer James\nCook who mapped much of Polynesia. Cook traveled as far as Alaska. In the later\n18th century the Pacific became a focus of renewed interest, with Spanish\nexpeditions reaching northern Canada and Alaska, and Northern Europeans\nexploring other unknown regions in the North-American west coast.\n\nThe centers of the Americas had been reached by the mid 16th century, although\nthere were unexplored areas until the 18th and 19th centuries. Australia's and\nAfrica's deep interiors were not explored by Europeans until the mid to late\n19th and early 20th centuries; this being due to a lack of trade potential in\nthis region, and to serious problems with contagious tropical diseases in sub-\nSaharan Africa's case. Finally, Antarctica's interior was explored, with North\nand South Poles reached in the 20th century.\n","linknr":647,"url":"Major_explorations_after_the_Age_of_Discovery","recorded":1362689309,"links":34,"instances":["explorer","navigation","instrument","amazon","angle","antarctica","1585","island","arctic_explorer","astronomer","mariner","northwest_territories_and_nunavut","explorer","sealer"],"pdf":["http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/1997/antpanel/antpan05.pdf","http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/1997/antpanel/antpan05.pdf"],"categories":["Exploration","History
