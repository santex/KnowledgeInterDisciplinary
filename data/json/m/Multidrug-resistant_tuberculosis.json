This can happen for a number of reasons: Patients may\nfeel better and halt their antibiotic course, drug supplies may run out or\nbecome scarce, patients may forget to take their medication from time to time or\npatients do not receive effective therapy. Most tuberculosis therapy consists of\nshort-course chemotherapy which is only curing a small percentage of patients\nwith multi-drug resistant tuberculosis. Delays in second line drugs make multi-\ndrug resistant tuberculosis more difficult to treat. MDR-TB is spread from person to person as readily as drug-sensitive\nTB and in the same\nmanner. http://www.cdc.gov/tb/publications/factsheets/drtb/mdrtb.htm\nEven with the patent off second line antituberculosis medication the price is\nstill high and therefore a big problem for patients living in poor countries to\nbe treated. With patients not treated, the spread of Tuberculosis would be\nproblematic in poor countries. In order to fully cure infectious diseases, such\nas Tuberculosis, we need a plan to ensure equal access to health care.\n","linknr":681,"url":"Multidrug-resistant_tuberculosis","recorded":1362500802,"links":26,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://aac.asm.org/cgi/reprint/43/7/1638.pdf","http://aac.asm.org/cgi/reprint/43/7/1638.pdf","http://aac.asm.org/cgi/reprint/48/8/3133.pdf","http://aac.asm.org/cgi/reprint/48/8/3133.pdf","http://www.tbcindia.org/pdfs/DOTS_Plus_Guidelines_Jan2010.pdf"],"categories":["Tuberculosis","Pharmaceuticals policy","Antibiotic-resistant bacteria"],"headings":["Epidemiology","Mechanisms of ''M. tuberculosis'' Drug Resistance","Extensively drug-resistant TB","Prevention of MDR TB","Treatment of MDR-TB","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Tuberculosis","Antibiotic_resistance","Isoniazid","Rifampicin","Isolate","HIV","Moldova","AIDS","Quinolone","Extensively_drug-resistant_tuberculosis","Directly_Observed_Therapy_–_Short_Course","First-line_treatment","Streptomycin","Isoniazid","Rifampicin","Ethambutol","Pyrazinamide","Moxifloxacin","Cycloserine","Moxifloxacin","Cycloserine","Aminoglycoside","Amikacin","Kanamycin","Capreomycin","Pyrazinamide","Ethambutol","Fluoroquinolone","Moxifloxacin","Ciprofloxacin","Rifabutin","Cycloserine","Thioamide","Prothionamide","Ethionamide","4-Aminosalicylic_acid","Macrolide","Clarithromycin","Linezolid","Isoniazid","Interferon-γ","Thioridazine","Arginine","Vitamin_D","Immunoxel/Dzherelo","V5_Immunitor","Imipenem","Co-amoxiclav","Clofazimine","Prochlorperazine","Metronidazole","Food_and_Drug_Administration","Bedaquiline","Johnson_&_Johnson","Adenosine_triphosphate","ATP_synthase","PA-824","Novartis","TB_Alliance","National_Jewish_Medical_and_Research_Center","2007_tuberculosis_scare","Drug_resistance","Methicillin-resistant_Staphylococcus_aureus","Vancomycin-resistant_enterococcus","Totally_drug-resistant_tuberculosis","Woodrow_Wilson_Center","Murray_Feshbach"]}
