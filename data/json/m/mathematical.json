Mathematicians resolve the truth or falsity of\nconjectures by mathematical proof. When mathematical structures are good\nmodels of real phenomena, then mathematical reasoning can provide insight or\npredictions about nature. Through the use of abstraction and logic,\nmathematics developed from counting, calculation, measurement, and the\nsystematic study of the shapes and motions of physical objects. Practical\nmathematics has been a human activity for as far back as written records\nexist. The research required to solve mathematical problems can take years or\neven centuries of sustained inquiry.\n\nRigorous arguments first appeared in Greek mathematics, most notably in Euclid's\n[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]. Since the pioneering work of Giuseppe Peano\n(1858–1932), David Hilbert (1862–1943), and others on axiomatic systems in the\nlate 19th century, it has become customary to view mathematical research as\nestablishing truth by rigorous deduction from appropriately chosen axioms and\ndefinitions. Mathematics developed at a relatively slow pace until the\nRenaissance, when mathematical innovations interacting with new scientific\ndiscoveries led to a rapid increase in the rate of mathematical discovery that\nhas continued to the present day.<ref>Eves</ref>\n\nGalileo Galilei (1564–1642) said, \"The universe cannot be read until we have\nlearned the language and become familiar with the characters in which it is\nwritten. It is written in mathematical language, and the letters are triangles,\ncircles and other geometrical figures, without which means it is humanly\nimpossible to comprehend a single word. Without these, one is wandering about in\na dark labyrinth.\"<ref>Marcus du Sautoy,\n[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00sr3fm A Brief History of Mathematics: 1.\nNewton and Leibniz], BBC Radio 4, 27 September 2010.</ref> Carl Friedrich Gauss\n(1777–1855) referred to mathematics as \"the Queen of the Sciences\".<ref\nname=\"Waltershausen\">Waltershausen</ref> Benjamin Peirce (1809–1880) called\nmathematics \"the science that draws necessary conclusions\".<ref>Peirce, p.\n97.</ref> David Hilbert said of mathematics: \"We are not speaking here of\narbitrariness in any sense. Mathematics is not like a game whose tasks are\ndetermined by arbitrarily stipulated rules. Rather, it is a conceptual system\npossessing internal necessity that can only be so and by no means\notherwise.\"<ref>Hilbert, D. (1919–20), Natur und Mathematisches Erkennen:\nVorlesungen, gehalten 1919–1920 in Göttingen. Nach der Ausarbeitung von Paul\nBernays (Edited and with an English introduction by David E. Rowe), Basel,\nBirkhäuser (1992).</ref> Albert Einstein (1879–1955) stated that \"as far as the\nlaws of mathematics refer to reality, they are not certain; and as far as they\nare certain, they do not refer to reality.\"<ref name=certain/> French\nmathematician Claire Voisin states \"There is creative drive in mathematics, it's\nall about movement trying to express itself.\"\n<ref>[http://www2.cnrs.fr/en/1402.htm Claire Voisin, Artist of the\nAbstract]</ref>\n\nMathematics is used throughout the world as an essential tool in many fields,\nincluding natural science, engineering, medicine, finance and the social\nsciences. Applied mathematics, the branch of mathematics concerned with\napplication of mathematical knowledge to other fields, inspires and makes use of\nnew mathematical discoveries, which has led to the development of entirely new\nmathematical disciplines, such as statistics and game theory. Mathematicians\nalso engage in pure mathematics, or mathematics for its own sake, without having\nany application in mind. There is no clear line separating pure and applied\nmathematics, and practical applications for what began as pure mathematics are\noften discovered.<ref>Peterson</ref>\n","title":"Mathematics","headings":["History","Definitions of mathematics","Inspiration, pure and applied mathematics, and aesthetics","Notation, language, and
