It is north of another\nvillage called Fernhill Heath. It is situated on a junction of the A38 and\nA4538. There is a public house called \"The Swan\" in the village and is located\njust north of the junction.\n\nIts church contains the grave of Thomas Tomkins, a composer of sacred music\nunder Elizabeth I and James I.\n\nRichard Pearce currently plays a huge role, again after a short absence, in\nmaintaining the church and ensuring its longevity albeit a fight against the\nparocial red tape. The church is made of sand stone and is being eatern by mason\nbees which are also in decline - so the balance to preserve both is difficult to\nmaintain. A recent addition of a toilet and sink within the church has added the\ndiversity of the uses of the building which lends host to larger congregations\nand addition church activities.\n","linknr":226,"url":"Martin_Hussingtree","recorded":1362572256,"links":20,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Villages in Worcestershire","Wychavon","Civil parishes in Worcestershire"],"headings":["External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/22/St_Michael_%26_All_Angels%2C_Martin_Hussingtree_-_geograph.org.uk_-_92936.jpg/250px-St_Michael_%26_All_Angels%2C_Martin_Hussingtree_-_geograph.org.uk_-_92936.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/Worcestershire_UK_location_map.svg/240px-Worcestershire_UK_location_map.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/0c/Red_pog.svg/6px-Red_pog.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/0c/Red_pog.svg/6px-Red_pog.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c1/EnglandWorcestershire.svg/25px-EnglandWorcestershire.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Wychavon","Worcestershire","Droitwich_Spa","Worcester","Worcestershire","Fernhill_Heath","A38_road","A4538_road","Thomas_Tomkins","Elizabeth_I_of_England","James_I_of_England"]}
