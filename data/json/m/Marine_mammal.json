Pompa, S., Ehrlich, P. R. & Ceballos, G. (2011) \"Global\ndistribution and conservation of marine mammals\". PNAS 108 (33): 13600â13605\n They do not represent a distinct biological grouping, but rather are\nunified by their reliance on the marine environment for feeding. Jefferson, T. A. , Webber, M. A. & Pitman, R. L. (2008) Marine\nMammals of the World A Comprehensive Guide to their Identification London ;\nBurlington, MA: Academic ISBN 978-0-12-383853-7 7-16 The level of\ndependence on the marine environment for existence varies considerably with\nspecies. For example, dolphins and whales are completely dependent on the marine\nenvironment for all stages of their life, whereas seals feed in the ocean, but\nbreed on land. Marine mammals can be subdivided into four\nrecognised groups; cetaceans (whales, dolphins, porpoises and narwhal),\npinnipeds (seals, sea lions and walruses), sirenians (manatees and dugongs), and\nfissipeds, which are the group of carnivores with separate digits (the polar\nbear, and two species of otter). Both cetaceans and sirenians are fully aquatic\nand therefore are obligate ocean dwellers. Pinnipeds are semi-aquatic; they\nspend the majority of their time in the water, but need to return to land for\nimportant activities such as mating, breeding and molting. In contrast, both\notters and the polar bear are much less adapted to ocean living.\nWhile the number of marine mammals is small compared to those found on land,\ntheir total biomass is large. They play important roles in maintaining marine\necosystems, especially through regulation of prey populations. Kaschner, K., Tittensor, D. P., Ready, J., Gerrodette, T. & Worm, B.\n(2011) \"Current and Future Patterns of Global Marine Mammal Biodiversity\" PLoS\nONE 6(5): 19653  These two factors make them an integral component of the\nmarine environment. This is of particular concern considering 23% of marine\nmammal species are currently threatened. Shipper, J. , Chanson,\nJ.
