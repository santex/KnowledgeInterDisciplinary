It is a 2D array on a solid\nsubstrate (usually a glass slide or silicon thin-film cell) that assays large\namounts of biological material using high-throughput screening methods. The\nconcept and methodology of microarrays was first introduced and illustrated in\nantibody microarrays (also referred to as antibody matrix) in 1983 in a\nscientific publication<ref name=\"pmid6606681\"></ref> and a series of\npatents.<ref>http://www.google.com/patents/US4591570;\nhttp://www.google.com/patents/US4829010;\nhttp://www.google.com/patents/US5100777.</ref> As the \"gene chip\" industry\nstarted to grow in the 1990's, with the establishment of companies, such as\nAffymetrix, Illumina, and others, the technology of DNA microarrays has become\nthe most sophisticated and the most widely used.\n\nTypes of microarrays include: *DNA microarrays, such as cDNA microarrays,\noligonucleotide microarrays and SNP microarrays *MMChips, for surveillance of\nmicroRNA populations *Protein microarrays *Peptide microarrays, for detailed\nanalyses or optimization of protein-protein interactions *Tissue microarrays\n*Cellular microarrays (also called transfection microarrays) *Chemical compound\nmicroarrays *Antibody microarrays *Carbohydrate arrays (glycoarrays) *Phenotype\nmicroarrays\n* interferometric reflectance imaging sensor (IRIS)\n\nPeople in the field of CMOS biotechnology are developing new kinds of\nmicroarrays. Once fed magnetic nanoparticles, individual cells can be moved\nindependently and simultaneously on a microarray of magnetic coils. A microarray\nof nuclear magnetic resonance microcoils is under development. <ref> Donhee Ham\nand Robert M.
