In 1927, at the age of 13, he moved with\nhis family to Nairobi, a municipality which, since 1905, had functioned as the\nadministrative capital of the British East African protectorate. In 1935, he\nformed the Labour Trade Union of Kenya and, in 1949, he and Fred Kubai formed\nthe East African Trade Union Congress, the first central organization of trade\nunions in Kenya.\n\nMakhan Singh presents a new and unique challenge in analysing the history of\npolitical detentions and human rights. His ten year detention in late 1950s in\nthe desert prison camp near Lodwar, Northern Kenya, under the \"control orders\"\nissued by the British rulers of Kenya Colony, has become highly significant\nsince both the Guantanamo Bay and Belmarsh Prison detentions of 2000.\n\nAfter having spoken out in clear and strong terms against British occupation and\ncolonial rule in Kenya on 23 April 1950 at Nairobi's Kaloleni Halls, Makhan\nSingh was arrested within 21 days on May 15. He had inadvertently given the\nBritish colonial masters an opportunity to silence him. At a trial in Nyeri,\nChanan Singh (later Justice Chanan Singh) defended him eloquently and with\nrigour. He was acquitted.\n\nLike the Belmarsh Prisoners and their detentions in the UK, the then Kenya\nColony Governor, Sir Philip Mitchell, ordered that he be detained for an\nindefinite period. He was released after ten years of being confined without any\ncharge or trial on 20 October 1961.\n\nHis detainment and situations surrounding them is history repeating itself. Sir\nPhilip Mitchell could not send him back to India after his acquittal as India\nwas a new country- sovereign in its own rights. The British administrations idea\nof using its colonies and friendly (puppet) maharajas (kings) in various Indian\nkingdoms and Kala Pani (Andaman Islands) as convenient rendition sites for\npeople who threatened the empire was a common practice. Makhan Singh was a\nresident in Kenya Colony. India ( a new democracy then 1947), would not accept\nhis \"rendition\".\n\nMakhan Singh died of a heart attack in Nairobi at the age of 59.\n","linknr":116,"url":"Makhan_Singh_(Kenyan_politician)","recorded":1375074793,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Makhan_Singh_(Kenyan_trade_unionist)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Makhan_Singh_(Kenyan_trade_unionist)&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","/wiki/Makhan_Singh_(Kenyan_trade_unionist)","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","/w/index.php?title=Makhan_Singh_(Kenyan_politician)&redirect=no","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Gujranwala","/wiki/Punjab_Province_(British_India)","/wiki/British_India","/wiki/Nairobi","/wiki/Kenya","/wiki/Trade_Unionist","/wiki/Sikhism","/wiki/India","/wiki/Labour_union","/wiki/Trade_unionism","/wiki/Kenya","/wiki/British_India","/wiki/Gujranwala","/wiki/Sikh","/wiki/Punjab_(British_India)","/wiki/Pakistan","/wiki/Nairobi","/wiki/Municipality","/wiki/British_East_Africa","/wiki/Protectorate","/wiki/Lodwar","/wiki/Guantanamo_Bay_detention_camp","/wiki/Belmarsh_Prison","/wiki/Nyeri","/wiki/Philip_Euen_Mitchell","/wiki/Andaman_Islands","/w/index.php?title=Makhan_Singh_(Kenyan_trade_unionist)&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Makhan_Singh_(Kenyan_trade_unionist)&action=edit&section=2","http://www.sikhnet.com/sikhnet/news.nsf/NewsArchive/3E65724825A6C989872571E20076AC76","http://www.mashada.com/forums/politics/11905-contribution-asians-kenya-makhan-singh-crew.html","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/29578589","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Makhan_Singh_(Kenyan_trade_unionist)&oldid=533454013","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1913_births","/wiki/Category:1973_deaths","/wiki/Category:Punjabi_people","/wiki/Category:Trade_union_leaders","/wiki/Category:Indian_trade_unionists","/wiki/Category:Kenyan_trade_unionists","/wiki/Category:People_from_Nairobi","/wiki/Category:Deaths_from_myocardial_infarction","/wiki/Category:Indian_emigrants_to_Kenya","/wiki/Category:Kenyan_Sikhs","/wiki/Category:People_from_Gujranwala","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_hCards","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/wiki/Category:Date_of_death_missing","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Makhan+Singh+%28Kenyan+trade+unionist%29&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Makhan+Singh+%28Kenyan+trade+unionist%29","/wiki/Makhan_Singh_(Kenyan_trade_unionist)","/wiki/Talk:Makhan_Singh_(Kenyan_trade_unionist)","#","/wiki/Makhan_Singh_(Kenyan_trade_unionist)","/w/index.php?title=Makhan_Singh_(Kenyan_trade_unionist)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Makhan_Singh_(Kenyan_trade_unionist)&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Makhan_Singh_(Kenyan_trade_unionist)","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Makhan_Singh_(Kenyan_trade_unionist)","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Makhan_Singh_(Kenyan_trade_unionist)&oldid=533454013","/w/index.php?title=Makhan_Singh_(Kenyan_trade_unionist)&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6739354","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Makhan_Singh_%28Kenyan_trade_unionist%29&id=533454013","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Makhan+Singh+%28Kenyan+trade+unionist%29","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Makhan+Singh+%28Kenyan+trade+unionist%29&oldid=533454013&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Makhan_Singh_(Kenyan_trade_unionist)&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6739354#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Pr
