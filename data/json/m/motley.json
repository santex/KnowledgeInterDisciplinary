      "text" : "\n in motley attire, year 1761 by Maurice Sand]] 'Motley' refers to the\n traditional costume of the court jester, or the harlequin character in\n [[commedia dell'arte]]. The latter wears a patchwork of red, green and blue\n diamonds that is still a fashion motif.\n\nThe word motley is described in the Oxford English Dictionary as a cognate with\nmedley, although the unrelated mottled has also contributed to the meaning. The\nword is most commonly used as an adjective or noun, but is also seen as a verb\nand adverb. When used as a noun, it can mean \"a varied mixture.\" As an\nadjective, it is generally disparaging &mdash; a motley collection is an\nuninspiring pile of stuff, as in the cliche motley crew.\n\nThe word originated in England between the 14th and 17th centuries and referred\nto a woolen fabric of mixed colors.<ref>Apparel Search Glossary\n[http://www.apparelsearch.com/glossary_m_1.htm \"Motley.\"] Retrieved on: December\n4, 2007.</ref> It was the characteristic dress of the professional fool. During\nthe reign of Elizabeth I, motley served the important purpose of keeping the\nfool outside the social hierarchy and therefore not subject to class\ndistinction. Since the fool was outside the dress laws (sumptuary law), the fool\nwas able to speak more freely.\n\nLikewise, motley did not have to be checkered and has been recently thought to\nbe one pattern with different colored threads running through it.\n",
