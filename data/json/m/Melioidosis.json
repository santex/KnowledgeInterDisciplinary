It is of public health\nimportance in endemic areas, particularly in Thailand and northern Australia. It\nexists in acute and chronic forms. Symptoms may include pain in chest, bones, or\njoints; cough; skin infections, lung nodules and pneumonia.\n\nB. pseudomallei was previously classed as part of the [[Pseudomonas]] genus and\n   until 1992, it was known as Pseudomonas pseudomallei. It is phylogenetically\n   related closely to [[Burkholderia mallei]] which causes glanders, an\n   infection primarily of horses, donkeys and mules. The name Melioidosis is\n   derived from the Greek melis (Î¼Î·Î»Î¹Ï) meaning \"a distemper of asses\" with the\n   suffixes -oid meaning \"similar to\" and -osis meaning \"a condition\", that is,\n   a condition similar to glanders.\n","linknr":1148,"url":"Melioidosis","recorded":1362501593,"links":26,"instances":["medicine"],"pdf":["http://www.usamriid.army.mil/education/bluebookpdf/USAMRIID%20BlueBook%206th%20Edition%20-%20Sep%202006.pdf","http://www.usamriid.army.mil/education/bluebookpdf/USAMRIID%20BlueBook%206th%20Edition%20-%20Sep%202006.pdf"],"categories":["Bacterium-related cutaneous conditions","Zoonotic bacterial diseases","Biological weapons"],"headings":["Epidemiology","Clinical features","Diagnosis","Treatment","Prognosis","Prevention","Biological warfare potential","Synonyms","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Bps_close.JPG/230px-Bps_close.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["nodule","medicine"]],"members":["nodule"],"related":["Infectious_disease","Gram-negative","Bacterium","Soil","Nodule_(medicine)","Glanders","Bangladesh","Antibody","Panda","Diabetes_mellitus","Thalassaemia","Rice_paddy","Cystic_fibrosis","HIV","Incubation_period","Fulminant","Pneumonia","Ultrasound","Computed_tomography","Confidence_interval","Computed_tomography","Parotid_gland","Meningitis","Lymph_node","Tuberculosis","Vietnamese_tuberculosis","Pericarditis","Sputum","Blood_agar","Ashdown's_medium","Gentamicin","Serology","Haemagglutination_assay","ELISA","X-rays","Prostate","Differential_diagnosis","Tuberculosis","Intravenous","Ceftazidime","Meropenem","Imipenem","Cefoperazone","Sulbactam","Co-amoxiclav","Antibiotic","Parenteral","Meropenem","Endotoxin","Minimum_inhibitory_concentration","Mean_inhibitory_concentration","Moxifloxacin","Cefepime","Tigecycline","Ertapenem","Piperacillin","Doripenem","Biapenem","Granulocyte_colony-stimulating_factor","Co-trimoxazole","Co-trimoxazole","Doxycycline","Chloramphenicol","Doxycycline","Fluoroquinolone","Ciprofloxacin","Chloramphenicol","Co-trimoxazole","Doxycycline","Ceftazidime","Meropenem","BSL-3","Diabetes_mellitus","Chronic_renal_failure","Trovafloxacin","Grepafloxacin","Biological_warfare","Centers_for_Disease_Control","Glanders","Soviet_Union","Alfred_Whitmore","Nightcliff","Darwin,_Northern_Territory"]}
