It was first developed\nby Maurice Hilleman while at Merck in the late 1960s.\n\nThe vaccine is a mixture of three live attenuated viruses, administered via\ninjection. The shot is generally administered to children around the age of one\nyear, with a second dose before starting school (i.e. age 4/5). The second dose\nis a dose to produce immunity in the small number of persons (2â5%) who fail to\ndevelop measles immunity after the first dose. In the\nUnited States, the vaccine was licensed in 1971 and the second dose was\nintroduced in 1989. It is widely used around the world; since\nintroduction of its earliest versions in the 1970s, over 500 million doses have\nbeen used in over 60 countries. As with all vaccinations, long-term effects and\nefficacy are subject to continuing study. The vaccine is sold by Merck as M-M-R\nII, GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals as Priorix, Serum Institute of India as\nTresivac, and Sanofi Pasteur as Trimovax.\n\nIt is usually considered a childhood vaccination. However, it is also\nrecommended for use in some cases of adults with HIV.\n","recorded":1362124659,"portal":[],"list":[],"links":"360","instances":["epidemiology","epidemiology"],"pdf":["http://www.merck.com/product/usa/pi_circulars/a/attenuvax/attenuvax_pi.pdf","http://www.merck.com/product/usa/pi_circulars/a/attenuvax/attenuvax_pi.pdf","http://www.merck.com/product/usa/pi_circulars/m/mumpsvax/mumpsvax_pi.pdf","http://www.merck.com/product/usa/pi_circulars/m/mumpsvax/mumpsvax_pi.pdf","http://www.merck.com/product/usa/pi_circulars/m/mmr_ii/mmr_ii_pi.pdf","http://www.merck.com/product/usa/pi_circulars/m/mmr_ii/mmr_ii_pi.pdf"],"categories":["Vaccines","Measles","Mumps","Rubella","MMR vaccine controversy","Combination drugs","Live vaccines"],"headings":["Effectiveness","Development, formulation and administration","Safety","MMRV vaccine","References"],"tags":[["incidence","epidemiology"],["endemic","epidemiology"],["incidence","epidemiology"],["endemic","epidemiology"]],"image":["http://en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fb/Yes_check.svg/14px-Yes_check.svg.png","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Measles_US_1944-2007_inset.png","http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Measles_US_1944-2007_inset.png/220px-Measles_US_1944-2007_inset.png","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Measles_US_1944-2007_inset.png","http://bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Rubella-us-1966-93-cdc.gif","http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/Rubella-us-1966-93-cdc.gif/220px-Rubella-us-1966-93-cdc.gif","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Rubella-us-1966-93-cdc.gif","http://bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Preparation_of_measles_vaccines.jpg","http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1e/Preparation_of_measles_vaccines.jpg/220px-Preparation_of_measles_vaccines.jpg","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Preparation_of_measles_vaccines.jpg","http://bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Gnome_globe_current_event.svg","http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Gnome_globe_current_event.svg/42px-Gnome_globe_current_event.svg.png","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Mmr_rexn.JPG","http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/34/Mmr_rexn.JPG/200px-Mmr_rexn.JPG","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Mmr_rexn.JPG","http://bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","http://bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","http://bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"related":["Vaccine","Vaccine","Vaccine","Immunization","Measles","Mumps","Rubella","Maurice_Hilleman","Merck_&_Co.","Attenuated_virus","Vaccination","Efficacy","Merck_&_Co.","GlaxoSmithKline_Biologicals","Serum_Institute_of_India","Sanofi_Pasteur","HIV","Measles","Incidence_(epidemiology)","Mental_retardation","World_Health_Organization","UNICEF","Endemic_(epidemiology)","Romania","Mumps","Virus","Disease","Puberty","Orchitis","Infertility","Rubella","Pregnancy","Congenital_rubella_syndrome","Congenital","Cochrane_Library","Systematic_review","Virulence","Wistar_Institute","Growth_Medium","Measles","Attenuvax","Mumps","Mumpsvax","Jeryl_Lynn","Rubella","Meruvax_II","Lyophilization","Subcutaneous_injection","Kindergarten","Adverse_drug_reaction","Malaise","Arthralgia","Arthritis","Anaphylaxis","Egg_allergy","Aseptic_meningitis","National_Health_Service","Jeryl_Lynn","Jeryl_Lynn","Efficacy","United_Kingdom","Andrew_Wakefield","Autism_spectrum","General_Medical_Council","British_Medical_Journal","Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention","Institute_of_Medicine","United_States_National_Academy_of_Sciences","National_Health_Service","United_Kingdom","National_Health_Service","MMRV_vaccine","Varicella","Febrile_seizure"],"members":["endemic","incidence"],"book":[]}
