Most animals are motile but the term applies to\nunicellular and simple multicellular organisms, as well as to some mechanisms of\nfluid flow in multicellular organs, in addition to animal locomotion. Motile\nmarine animals are commonly called 'free-swimming'.\n\nThe opposite of motility is sessility.\n\nMotility may also refer to an organism's ability to move food through its\ndigestive tract, i.e., peristaltics (gut motility, intestinal motility, etc.).<ref>http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/179937-\noverview</ref>\n","title":"motility","headings":["Cellular-level motility","Movements","See also","References"]},"micro-relation":["1: Biology","1: Animal","1: Unicellular_organism","1: Multicellular_organism","1: Animal_locomotion","1: Marine_animal","1: Peristaltics","1: Flagellar_motility","1: Spermatozoa","1: Flagellum","1: Amoeboid_movement","1: Gliding_motility","1: Swarming_motility","1: Chemotaxis","1: Thermotaxis","1: Phototaxis","1: Magnetotaxis","1: Galvanotaxis","1: Gravitaxis","1: Durotaxis","1: Haptotaxis","1: Biopolymer","1: Cell_migration"]}
