{"cursor":"35599","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n'Medical genetics' is the specialty of medicine that involves the diagnosis and\nmanagement of hereditary disorders. Medical genetics differs from Human genetics\nin that human genetics is a field of scientific research that may or may not\napply to medicine, but medical genetics refers to the application of genetics to\nmedical care. For example, research on the causes and inheritance of genetic\ndisorders would be considered within both human genetics and medical genetics,\nwhile the diagnosis, management, and counseling of individuals with genetic\ndisorders would be considered part of medical genetics.\n\nIn contrast, the study of typically non-medical phenotypes such as the genetics\nof eye color would be considered part of human genetics, but not necessarily\nrelevant to medical genetics (except in situations such as albinism). Genetic\nmedicine is a newer term for medical genetics and incorporates areas such as\ngene therapy, personalized medicine, and the rapidly emerging new medical\nspecialty, predictive medicine.\n","linknr":566,"url":"Medical_genetics","recorded":1362486395,"links":32,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Medical genetics|*","Cancer research","Medical specialties","Medical doctors
