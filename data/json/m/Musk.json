They include glandular secretions from animals such as the musk deer,\nnumerous plants emitting similar fragrances, and artificial substances with\nsimilar odors. Musk was a name originally\ngiven to a substance with a penetrating odor obtained from a gland of the male\nmusk deer. The substance has been used as a popular perfume fixative since\nancient times and is one of the most expensive animal products in the world. The\nname originates from the Sanskrit word for \"testicle,\" {{Unicode|muá¹£kÃ¡}}, and\nhas come to encompass a wide variety of aromatic substances with similar odors\ndespite their often differing chemical structures.\n\nUntil the late 19th century, natural musk was used extensively in perfumery\nuntil economic and ethical motives led to the adoption of synthetic musk, which\nis now used almost exclusively. The organic compound\nprimarily responsible for the characteristic odor of musk is muscone.\n\nModern use of natural musk pods occurs in traditional Chinese medicine.\n","linknr":264,"url":"Musk","recorded":1362897506,"links":53,"instances":["perfumery","perfumery"],"pdf":["http://www.perfumerbook.com/Arranging%20Fine%20Perfume%20Compositions%20-%20Floral%20Aldehydic.pdf","http://www.perfumerbook.com/Arranging%20Fine%20Perfume%20Compositions%20-%20Floral%20Aldehydic.pdf","http://www.perfumerbook.com/Arranging%20Fine%20Perfume%20Compositions%20-%20Floral%20Aldehydic.pdf"],"categories":["Animal glandular products","Fragrances","Perfume ingredients"],"headings":["Natural sources","Artificial compounds","See also","Notes","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/bf/Questionmark_copyright.svg/100px-Questionmark_copyright.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/Primary_Form_of_Musk.jpg/220px-Primary_Form_of_Musk.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8d/Moschustier.jpg/180px-Moschustier.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/Musk_1616.jpg/140px-Musk_1616.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/Ondatra_zibethicus_FWS.jpg/220px-Ondatra_zibethicus_FWS.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Galaxolide.svg/220px-Galaxolide.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/62/PD-icon.svg/12px-PD-icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["note","perfumery"],["fixative","perfumery"]],"members":["fixative","note"],"related":["Note_(perfumery)","Odor","Gland","Musk_deer","Perfume","Fixative_(perfumery)","Animal_product","Sanskrit","Chemical_structure","Perfume","Organic_compound","Muscone","Traditional_Chinese_medicine","Granular_material","Tincture","CITES","Poaching","Ayurveda","Siberian_musk_deer","Muskrat","North_America","Musk_duck","Australia","Muskox","Musk_shrew","Musk_beetle","African_civet","Musk_turtle","Alligator","Central_America","Crocodile","Cloaca","Endangered_species","Cosmetics","Detergent","Androstenol","Civetone","Musk_deer"]}
