{"cursor":"3633","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Michael East' (or 'Easte', 'Est', 'Este') (ca. 1580–1648) was an English\norganist and composer. He was a nephew of London music publisher Thomas East\n(ca. 1540–1608), although it was once thought that he was his son. [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/176421/Michael-\nEast EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica online]\n\nIn 1601, East wrote a madrigal that was accepted by Thomas Morley for\npublication in his collection [[The Triumphs of Oriana]]. Horst Seeger:\nMusiklexikon Personen AâZ / Deutscher Verlag fÃ¼r Musik Leipzig (1981), p.\n210. In 1606, he received a Bachelor of Music degree from the University\nof Cambridge Grove Dictionary of Music (online edition) and\nin 1609 he joined the choir of Ely Cathedral, initially as a lay clerk. By 1618 he was employed by Lichfield Cathedral, where he worked as\na choirmaster, probably until 1644, when the Civil War brought an end to sung\nservices. Oxford Dictionary of National Biography Elias Ashmole was a\nchorister at Lichfield, and later recalled that \"Mr Michael East â¦ was my tutor\nfor song and Mr Henry Hinde, organist of the Cathedral â¦ taught me on the\nvirginals and organ\". H. W. Shaw, The succession of organists of the Chapel\nRoyal and the cathedrals of England and Wales from c. 1538, 1991, p. 146.\n\nEast's exact date of death is not known, but he died at Lichfield. His will was\nwritten on 7 January 1648 and proved on 9 May 1648. It mentions his wife\nDorothy, daughter Mary Hamersly, and a son and grandson both named Michael.\n\nHis most highly-regarded works are his five-part fantasies for\nviols: According to Grove's dictionary Thurston Dart is quoted as\nsaying, \"despite some slipshod part-writing, they are among the best five-part\nconsorts of the time\".\n","linknr":131,"url":"Michael_East_(composer)","recorded":1375059331,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Michael_East_(composer)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Michael_East_(composer)&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Thomas_East","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Madrigal","/wiki/Thomas_Morley","/wiki/The_Triumphs_of_Oriana","#cite_note-2","/wiki/University_of_Cambridge","#cite_note-grove-3","/wiki/Ely_Cathedral","#cite_note-grove-3","/wiki/Lichfield_Cathedral","/wiki/English_Civil_War","#cite_note-4","/wiki/Elias_Ashmole","#cite_note-5","/wiki/Lichfield","#cite_note-grove-3","/wiki/Fantasy_(music)","/wiki/Viol","#cite_note-6","/wiki/Thurston_Dart","#cite_note-grove-3","/w/index.php?title=Michael_East_(composer)&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Sir_Henry_Wotton","/wiki/Elizabeth_Stuart_(1596%E2%80%931662)","/wiki/James_I_of_England","/w/index.php?title=Michael_East_(composer)&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-1","http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/176421/Michael-East","#cite_ref-2","#cite_ref-grove_3-0","#cite_ref-grove_3-1","#cite_ref-grove_3-2","#cite_ref-grove_3-3","#cite_ref-4","#cite_ref-5","#cite_ref-6","/w/index.php?title=Michael_East_(composer)&action=edit&section=3","http://www.cpdl.org/wiki/index.php/Michael_East","/wiki/Choral_Public_Domain_Library","http://imslp.org/wiki/Category:East,_Michael","/wiki/International_Music_Score_Library_Project","http://www.oldmusicproject.com/madrigalia/east.html","http://www.hoasm.org/IVM/East.html","/wiki/Authority_control","http://www.worldcat.org/identities/lccn-n86-17122","/wiki/Library_of_Congress_Control_Number","http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n86017122","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Michael_East_(composer)&oldid=543172286","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1580s_births","/wiki/Category:1648_deaths","/wiki/Category:English_composers","/wiki/Category:Baroque_composers","/wiki/Category:English_classical_organists","/wiki/Category:Classical_composers_of_church_music","/wiki/Category:16th-century_English_people","/wiki/Category:17th-century_English_people","/wiki/Category:17th-century_musicians","/wiki/Category:People_of_the_Tudor_period","/wiki/Category:People_of_the_Stuart_period","/wiki/Category:Use_dmy_dates_from_December_2011","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_LCCN_identifiers","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Michael+East+%28composer%29&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Michael+East+%28composer%29","/wiki/Michael_East_(composer)","/wiki/Talk:Michael_East_(composer)","#","/wiki/Michael_East_(composer)","/w/index.php?title=Michael_East_(composer)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Michael_East_(composer)&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Michael_East_(composer)","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Michael_East_(composer)","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Michael_East_(composer)&oldid=543172286","/w/index.php?title=Michael_East_(composer)&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1927338","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Michael_East_%28composer%29&id=543172286","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Michael+East+%28composer%29","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Michael+East+%28composer%29&oldid=543172286&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Michael_East_(composer)&printable=yes","//de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_East_(Komponist)","//it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_East","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1927338#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki
