It was introduced\nin early 1984. The character was created by George Stone, [http://homepage.-\nntlworld.com/john.seymour1/ukbookguide/Series/MaxHeadroom.html The UK Sci-Fi TV\nBook Guide: Max Headroom: 20 Minutes Into the Future by Steve Roberts]\nAnnabel Jankel, and Rocky Morton in the mid-1980s, and portrayed by Matt Frewer\nas \"The World's first computer-generated TV host\" although the computer-\ngenerated appearance was achieved with prosthetic make up as the computer\ntechnology of the time was not sufficiently advanced to achieve the desired\neffect. Preparing the look for filming involved a four-and-a-half hour session\nin make-up which Matt Frewer described as \"a very painful, torturous and\ndisgusting enterprise.\"\n\nThe classic look for the character was a shiny dark suitâwhich was actually a\nfibreglass mouldâoften paired with Ray-Ban Wayfarer sunglasses. Only his head\nand shoulders were depicted, usually against a \"computer-generated\" backdrop of\na slowly rotating wire-frame cube interior, which was also initially generated\nby analogue means - in this case traditional cel animation, though later actual\ncomputer graphics were employed for the backdrop. Another distinguishing\ntrademark of Max was his chaotic speech patterns - his voice would seemingly\nrandomly pitch up or down, or occasionally get stuck in a loop. These\nmodulations also appeared when the character was performed live.\n\nThe character's personality was partly intended as a satire of insincere and\negotistical television personalities - what Rocky Morton described as the\n\"very sterile, arrogant, Western personification of the middle-class, male TV\nhost,\" but also was \"media-wise and gleefully disrespectful\" which appealed to\nyoung viewers.\n\nMatt Frewer was chosen for his ability to improvise, and his - according to\nproducer Peter Wagg - \"ideally exportable\" Mid-Atlantic accent. The actor\ndecided to model Max's personality after what he saw as the smarmy, self-\nimportant goofiness of [[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'s Ted Baxter. \"I\nparticularly wanted to get that phony bonhomie of Baxter,\" Frewer said in an\n1986 interview, \"Max always assumes a decade long friendship on the first\nmeeting. At first sight he'll ask about that blackhead on your nose.\"\n\nMax Headroom originally featured as a veejay in a music video programme whose\nfirst episodes unusually featured no introductory title sequence or end\ncredits. The show was an immediate cult hit, doubling Channel 4's viewing\nfigures for its slot.\n\nLater the character appeared in a , a dramatic television series, television\ncommercials and the song \"Paranoimia\" by the British pop act Art of Noise.\n\nAlthough best remembered in the UK for his initial TV host role, Max Headroom is\nmore associated in the United States and Canada with commercials for Coca-Cola\nand a later, short-lived science fiction series that featured him.\n","linknr":244,"url":"Max_Headroom_(character)","recorded":1363412818,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Max_Headroom_(character)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Max_Headroom_(character)&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/Max_Headroom_(TV_series)","/wiki/File:MaxheadroomMpegMan.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/7b/MaxheadroomMpegMan.jpg/250px-MaxheadroomMpegMan.jpg","/wiki/Matt_Frewer","/wiki/Voice_acting","/wiki/Artificial_intelligence","/wiki/Wit","/wiki/Sampling_(music)","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Annabel_Jankel","/wiki/Rocky_Morton","/wiki/Matt_Frewer","/wiki/Fibreglass","/wiki/Ray-Ban_Wayfarer","/w/index.php?title=Peter_Wagg&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/The_Mary_Tyler_Moore_Show","/wiki/Ted_Baxter","/wiki/VJ_(media_personality)","/wiki/The_Max_Headroom_Show","/wiki/Max_Headroom:_20_Minutes_into_the_Future","/wiki/Max_Headroom_(TV_series)","/wiki/Art_of_Noise","/wiki/Coca-Cola","#Appearances","#Max_Headroom_and_20_Minutes_into_the_Future","#Other_appearances","#Musical_performance","#Video_game","#Production_notes","#Signal_intrusion_event","#Proposed_film","#In_popular_culture","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Max_Headroom_(character)&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Max_Headroom_(character)&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/The_Max_Headroom_Show","/wiki/Max_Headroom:_20_Minutes_into_the_Future","/wiki/Cinemax","/wiki/Dystopia","/wiki/Multinational_corporation","/wiki/Max_Headroom_(TV_series)","/wiki/More4","/wiki/Channel_4","/wiki/Shout!_Factory","/w/index.php?title=Max_Headroom_(character)&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/File:Newcoke_maxheadroom.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/05/Newcoke_maxheadroom.jpg/100px-Newcoke_maxheadroom.jpg","/wiki/File:Newcoke_maxheadroom.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Spokesman","/wiki/New_Coke","/wiki/Coke_Classic","/wiki/Radio_Rentals","/wiki/Cinemax","/wiki/Sesame_Street","#cite_note-2","#cite_note-guardian-3","/wiki/Max_Headroom:_20_Minutes_into_the_Future","/w/index.php?title=Max_Headroom_(character)&action=edit&section=4","/wiki/Art_of_Noise","/wiki/Paranoimia","#cite_note-4","/wiki/Chrysalis_Records","#cite_note-5","/wiki/1988_Winter_Olympics","/w/index.php?title=Max_Headroom_(character)&action=edit&section=5","/wiki/Quicksilva","/wiki/Sinclair_Research_Ltd","/wiki/ZX_Spectrum","/wiki/Commodore_64","/w/index.php?title=Max_Headroom_(character)&action=edit&section=6","/wiki/Matt_Frewer","/wiki/Fiberglass","/wiki/Peter_Litten","/wiki/Traditional_animation","/wiki/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy_(TV_series)","/wiki/Amiga","/wiki/BAFTA","#cite_note-6","/wiki/All3Media","#cite_note-guardian-3","/w/index.php?title=Max_Headroom_(character)&action=edit&section=7","/wiki/Max_Headroom_broadcast_signal_intrusion","/wiki/Chicago","/wiki/Broadcast_signal_intrusion","/wiki/WGN-TV","/wiki/PBS","/wiki/WTTW","/wiki/Doctor_Who","/wiki/Horror_of_Fang_Rock","/wiki/WGN-TV#History","/w/index.php?title=Max_Headroom_(character)&action=edit&section=8","/wiki/Marilyn_Beck","#cite_note-7","/wiki/1988_Writers_Guild_of_America_strike","/w/index.php?title=Max_Headroom_(character)&action=edit&section=9","/wiki/Late_Night_with_David_Letterman","/wiki/Calvert_DeForest","/wiki/Back_to_the_Future_Part_II","/wiki/Marty_McFly","/wiki/Michael_Jackson","/wiki/Ronald_Reagan","/wiki/Ayatollah_Khomeini","/wiki/Doonesbury","/wiki/Garry_Trudeau","/wiki/Ron_Headrest","/wiki/Ronald_Reagan","/wiki/Farscape","/wiki/List_of_Farscape_episodes#Season_4","/wiki/Ben_Browder","/wiki/John_Crichton","/wiki/Sum_41","/wiki/Half_Hour_of_Power","/wiki/Spaceballs","/wiki/Spaceballs:_The_Animated_Series","/wiki/Gigi_D%27Agostino","/wiki/Another_Way_(Gigi_D%27Agostino_song)","/wiki/Square_One_Television","/wiki/Sirius_Radio","/wiki/Usher_(entertainer)","/wiki/OMG_(song)","/wiki/Selena_Gomez","/wiki/Ready_Player_One","/wiki/Ernest_Cline","/wiki/A_Clockwork_Hammer","/wiki/Sledge_Hammer","/wiki/Social_Democratic_Party","/wiki/David_Owen","/w/index.php?title=Max_Headroom_(character)&action=edit&section=10","#cite_ref-1","http://homepage.ntlworld.com/john.seymour1/ukbookguide/Series/MaxHeadroom.html","#cite_ref-2","http://www.wiki
