{"cursor":"2404","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Multitudes' is a French philosophical, political and artistic monthly journal\nfounded in 2000 by Yann Moulier-Boutang. It is thematically situated in the\ntheoretical framework of the work ''Empire'' by Antonio Negri and Michael Hardt.\nThe journal, like the book, focuses on the further elaboration of the\nphilosophical and political thought of the Italian [[Autonomist\nMarxism|operaismo]], but seems also to rest on Foucault, Althusser, and\nDeleuze's thought. It is a successor to the review Futur AntÃ©rieur edited by Jean-\nMarie Vincent (1934-2004) and Toni Negri, at the dep. of political science -\nUniversity Vincennes Paris 8. It is a member of the Eurozine network.\n\nMultitudes's name comes from the Spinozist eponymic concept. It has been thought\nby Toni Negri as an alternative to the classic conception of the people, class\nconsciousness, or nation-state. It publishes a lot on themes relating to the\ninformation society and the knowledge economy, supporting in particular the\nthesis of a \"cognitive labour\" and \"affective labour\" which can not be measured\nby standard means of labor-time, and also insists on the cooperative aspects of\nproduction in modern society. For this reason and others, it tends to argue in\nfavour of a guaranteed minimum income.\n\nContents published by Multitudes are mostly in French, although some\narticles are translated (in English, Spanish, etc.) and are under a Creative\nCommons license.\n","linknr":123,"url":"Multitudes","recorded":1362555759,"links":18,"instances":["book"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Political philosophy literature","Philosophy journals","Marxism","Autonomism","Publications established in 2000","Creative Commons-licensed journals"],"headings":["Some members","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2a/Newspaper.svg/30px-Newspaper.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c3/Flag_of_France.svg/30px-Flag_of_France.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["empire","book"]],"members":["empire"],"related":["Philosophy","Yann_Moulier-Boutang","Empire_(book)","Antonio_Negri","Michael_Hardt","Michel_Foucault","Althusser","Deleuze","Futur_Antérieur","Eurozine","Baruch_Spinoza","Multitude","People","Class_consciousness","Nation-state","Information_society","Knowledge_economy","Guaranteed_minimum_income","Creative_Commons","Barbara_Cassin","Maurizio_Lazzarato","Judith_Revel","Toni_Negri","Michael_Hardt","Patrice_Riemens","Nanni_Balestrini"]}
