{"cursor":"6452","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Minimum alveolar concentration' or 'MAC' is a concept used to compare the\nstrengths, or potency, of anaesthetic vapours;\nin simple terms, it is defined as the concentration of the vapour in the lungs\nthat is needed to prevent movement (motor response) in 50% of subjects in\nresponse to surgical (pain) stimulus. Thus, it is actually a median value; the\nuse of minimum would appear to be descended from the original paper in which the\nconcept appeared, although the term there was 'minimalalveolar concentration'. A\nlower MAC value represents a more potent volatile anesthetic.\n\nThe concept was introduced in 1965.\n\nOther uses of MAC include MAC-BAR (1.7-2.0 MAC), which is the concentration\nrequired to block autonomic reflexes to nociceptive stimuli, and MAC-awake (0.3-\n0.5 MAC), the concentration required to block voluntary reflexes and control\nperceptive awareness.\n","linknr":243,"url":"Minimum_alveolar_concentration","recorded":1362477066,"links":18,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Anesthesia"],"headings":["Formal definition","Meyer-Overton hypothesis","Altered MAC","Common MAC values","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Potency","Volatile_anaesthetic","Lung","Autonomic_nervous_system","Nociception","Partial_pressure","Alveoli","Blood","Brain","Nitrogen_narcosis","Lipid","Hans_Horst_Meyer","GABA","Thyrotoxicosis","Nitrous_oxide","Xenon","Desflurane","Ethyl_Ether","Sevoflurane","Enflurane","Isoflurane","Halothane","Chloroform","Methoxyflurane"]}
