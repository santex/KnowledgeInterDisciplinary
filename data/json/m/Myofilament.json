The principal types of muscle\nare striated muscle, obliquely striated muscle and smooth muscle. Various\narrangements of myofilaments create different muscles. Striated muscle has\ntransverse bands of filaments. In obliquely striated muscle, the filaments are\nstaggered. Smooth muscle has irregular arrangements of filaments.\n","linknr":619,"url":"Myofilament","recorded":1362674144,"links":17,"instances":["biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Cell movement"],"headings":["Types of myofilaments","Protein action","Muscle function","Myofilament response to exercise","Other areas of research","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a3/Myofilament.svg/250px-Myofilament.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cell","biology"]],"members":["cell"],"related":["Protein_filament","Myofibrils","Protein","Striated_muscle","Myosin","Myosin","Actin","Sarcomere","Actomyosin","Striated_muscle","Skeletal_muscle","Cardiac_muscle","Cell_(biology)","Muscle","Sarcomere","Myosin","Actin","Neurotransmitter","Enzyme","Adenosine_triphosphate","Thoroughbred","Actin","Desmin","Dystrophin"]}
