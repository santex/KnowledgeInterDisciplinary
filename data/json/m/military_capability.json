{"cursor":"4195","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Military capability' is defined by the Australian Defence Force as \"the ability\nto achieve a desired effect in a specific operating environment\". p.15,\nHinge It is defined by three interdependent factors: combat readiness,\nsustainable capability and force structure.\n\nIn terms of technologies, weapons and equipment use, it represents assets, that\nexist to perform specific functions in relation to requirements of the statement\nabout present or future military operations as derived from the national defence\npolicy (strategic). A national Capabilities Development Plan seeks to provide a\nglobal understanding of capability needs, capability trends and potential\ncapability shortfalls.\n\nMilitary capability is often referred to in terms of low, medium and high,\nalthough this usually refers to the type, quantity and sophistication of\ntechnology being used in combat operations, and the severity of threat to\nsecurity of the state.\n\nMaintaining military capability requires modernisation of military technology,\nparticularly prevalent in Europe since the Middle Ages due to the arms race that\ncommenced with the introduction of artillery and later firearms into warfare.\n\nIn the European Union, capability development is approached by the Capability\nDirectorate focusing on three primary areas: Steering Board Decision on Key\nOperating Rules for the R&T Operational Concept\n[http://www.eda.europa.eu/genericitem.aspx?area=Reference&id=143]\n* IAP: Information Acquisition & Processing - Knowledge\n* GEM: Guidance, Energy & Materials - Engagement\n* ESM: Environment, Systems & Modelling - Manoeuver\n\nExisting military capability in armed forces will be employed, and only minor\nenhancements are possible in a short conflict. The context within which the\nmilitary capabilities are used such as the geography of the area of operations,\nthe culture and demography of the enemy, and the preparedness of the opposing\nforces, generally can not be altered at the start of the conflict.\n\nIt is a major part of military science to find methods of defeating the enemy\nwith available capabilities using existing and new concepts. Successful use of\nmilitary capability by employing these concepts and methods is reflected in the\neffects on the enemy ability to continue to resist, subject to Rules of\nEngagement (ROE) range of political, legal and ethical factors. Military\ncapability is often tested in peacetime by using the scenario methodology to\nanalyse performance, often as a war game. It is  The military's\nstrategic role is to advise civilian leadership on the capability of military\nforces to execute specific missions. p.72, Newell \n\nFuture military capability is developed based on the analysis of experimentation\nand testing of existing capability performance, and future capability decisions\nare made based on the armed forces being able to meet the challenges of a range\nof possible future scenarios. This is arguably a difficult task to accomplish\ndue to the lack of predictability about future threats, changes in defence\npolicy, and the range of response options and their effects that a government\nmay want as a matter of future national defence policy.\n\nThe difference between expected and deliverable military capabilities is called\nthe military capability gap, although the same term is also sometimes used to\ncompare capabilities of potential future belligerents.\n","linknr":96,"url":"military_capability","recorded":1371065223,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Military_capability&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Military_capability&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Combat_readiness","/wiki/Force_structure","/wiki/National_defence_policy","/wiki/Military_technology","/wiki/Middle_Ages","/wiki/Arms_race","/wiki/Artillery","/wiki/Firearms","/wiki/Warfare","/wiki/European_Union","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Military_intelligence","/wiki/Combat","/wiki/Operational_mobility","/wiki/Area_of_operations","/wiki/Military_science","/wiki/Rules_of_Engagement","/wiki/Military_simulation","#cite_note-3","/w/index.php?title=Military_capability&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Military_budget","/w/index.php?title=Military_capability&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-1","#cite_ref-2","http://www.eda.europa.eu/genericitem.aspx?area=Reference&id=143","#cite_ref-3","/w/index.php?title=Military_capability&action=edit&section=3","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Military_capability&oldid=545415655","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Military_terminology","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Military+capability&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Military+capability","/wiki/Military_capability","/wiki/Talk:Military_capability","#","/wiki/Military_capability","/w/index.php?title=Military_capability&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Military_capability&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf3/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Military_capability","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Military_capability","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Military_capability&oldid=545415655","/w/index.php?title=Military_capability&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Military_capability&id=545415655","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Military+capability","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Military+capability&oldid=545415655&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Military_capability&printable=yes","//uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%92%D1%96%D0%B9%D1%81%D1%8C%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B8%D0%B9_%D0%BF%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%86%D1%96%D0%B0%D0%BB","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6852245#sitelinks","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_capability","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf3/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","/w/index.php?title=MediaWiki:Gadget-ReferenceTooltips.js&action=raw&ctype=text/javascript&508635914","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Military
