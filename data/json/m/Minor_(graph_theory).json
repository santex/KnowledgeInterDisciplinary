The\nRobertsonâSeymour theorem implies that an analogous forbidden minor\ncharacterization exists for every property of graphs that is preserved by\ndeletions and edge contractions. , theorem 4, p. 78; . For\nevery fixed graph H, it is possible to test whether H is a minor of an input\ngraph G in polynomial time; together with the forbidden minor\ncharacterization this implies that every graph property preserved by deletions\nand contractions may be recognized in polynomial time.\n\nOther results and conjectures involving graph minors include the graph structure\ntheorem, according to which the graphs that do not have H as a minor may be\nformed by gluing together simpler pieces, and Hadwiger's conjecture relating the\ninability fo color a graph to the existence of a large complete graph as a minor\nof it. Important variants of graph minors include the topological minors and\nimmersion minors.\n","linknr":382,"url":"Minor_(graph_theory)","recorded":1362553788,"links":26,"instances":["graph_theory","mathematician","graph_theory","graph_theory","mathematics","graph_theory","graph_theory","graph_theory","mathematician","graph_theory","graph_theory"],"pdf":["http://www.ams.org/notices/200209/rev-pegg.pdf","http://www.ams.org/notices/200209/rev-pegg.pdf","http://people.math.gatech.edu/~thomas/PAP/bcc.pdf","http://people.math.gatech.edu/~thomas/PAP/bcc.pdf","http://www2.renyi.hu/~p_erdos/1980-10.pdf","http://www2.renyi.hu/~p_erdos/1980-10.pdf","http://www.math.gatech.edu/~thomas/PAP/hadwiger.pdf","http://www.math.gatech.edu/~thomas/PAP/hadwiger.pdf"],"categories":["Graph minor theory|","Graph theory objects"],"headings":["Definitions","Example","Major results and conjectures","Minor-closed graph families","Topological minors","Immersion minor","Algorithms","Notes","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e2/GraphMinorExampleA.png/100px-GraphMinorExampleA.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/cf/GraphMinorExampleB.svg/200px-GraphMinorExampleB.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/GraphMinorExampleC.svg/190px-GraphMinorExampleC.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/5/4/054b3cdb6bd4b6f7bd772ba8f15f2a75.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["hadwiger_conjecture","graph_theory"],["loop","graph_theory"],["rank","graph_theory"],["neil_robertson","mathematician"],["paul_seymour","mathematician"],["genus","mathematics"],["hadwiger_conjecture","graph_theory"],["bridge","graph_theory"],["genus","mathematics"],["tree","graph_theory"],["diameter","graph_theory"],["crossing_number","graph_theory"],["subdivision","graph_theory"]],"members":["tree","neil_robertson","hadwiger_conjecture","subdivision","genus","diameter","bridge","loop","paul_seymour","crossing_number","rank"],"related":["Graph_theory","Undirected_graph","Edge_contraction","Wagner's_theorem","Planar_graph","Complete_graph","Complete_bipartite_graph","Robertson–Seymour_theorem","Forbidden_minors","Polynomial_time","Graph_structure_theorem","Hadwiger_conjecture_(graph_theory)","Graph_coloring","Complete_graph","Undirected_graph","Matroid_minor","Loop_(graph_theory)","Multiple_edge","Multigraph","Cut-edge","Rank_(graph_theory)","Pseudoforest","Binary_relation","Partial_order","Transitive_relation","Deep_result","Neil_Robertson_(mathematician)","Paul_Seymour_(mathematician)","Well-quasi-ordering","Minimal_element","Klaus_Wagner","Graph_structure_theorem","Clique-sum","Graph_embedding","Genus_(mathematics)","Graph_embedding","Sparse_graph","Planar_separator_theorem","Hadwiger_conjecture_(graph_theory)","Complete_graph","Graph_coloring","Four_color_theorem","Snark_theorem","W._T._Tutte","Bridge_(graph_theory)","Cubic_graph","Edge_coloring","Petersen_graph","Planar_graph","Graph_embedding","2-manifold","Genus_(mathematics)","Forbidden_graph_characterization","Wagner's_theorem","Pathwidth","Tree_(graph_theory)","Tree-depth","Path_graph","Treewidth","Planar_graph","Diameter_(graph_theory)","Apex_graph","Crossing_number_(graph_theory)","Wagner_graph","Subdivision_(graph_theory)","Graph_isomorphism","Decision_problem","Cycle_graph","Hamiltonian_cycle","Big_O_notation","Polynomial_time","Journal_of_the_American_Mathematical_Society","European_Journal_of_Combinatorics","Journal_of_the_ACM","Bulletin_of_the_American_Mathematical_Society","Bulletin_of_the_American_Mathematical_Society","Journal_of_Combinatorial_Theory","Journal_of_Combinatorial_Theory","American_Mathematical_Society","Journal_of_Combinatorial_Theory","Journal_of_Combinatorial_Theory","Journal_of_Combinatorial_Theory","Combinatorica","Mathematical_Proceedings_of_the_Cambridge_Philosophical_Society","Journal_of_Combinatorial_Theory"]}
