They include: *Transposons (also called transposable elements)\n**Retrotransposons ** **Insertion sequences *Plasmids *Bacteriophage elements,\nlike Mu, which integrates randomly into the genome *Group II introns\n\nThe total of all mobile genetic elements in a genome may be referred to as the\nmobilome. Barbara McClintock was awarded the 1983 Nobel Prize in Physiology or\nMedicine \"for her discovery of mobile genetic elements\".\n\nMobile genetic elements play a critical role in the spread of virulence factors,\nsuch as exotoxins and exoenzymes, amongst bacteria. Strategies to combat certain\nbacterial infections by targeting these specific virulence factors and mobile\ngenetic elements have been proposed.\n","linknr":157,"url":"Mobile_genetic_elements","recorded":1362664888,"links":22,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Genetics","Mobile genetic elements|"],"headings":["See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3d/Bacterial_mobile_elements.svg/400px-Bacterial_mobile_elements.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["DNA","Genome","Transposon","Retrotransposons","Insertion_sequences","Plasmids","Bacteriophage","Mu_phage","Group_II_intron","Mobilome","Barbara_McClintock","Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_or_Medicine","Exotoxin","Horizontal_gene_transfer","Classification_of_mobile_genetic_elements","Virulence_factor"]}
