Workers were\naccidentally exposed to tissues of infected grivets (Chlorocebus aethiops) at\nthe city's former main industrial plant, the Behringwerke, then part of Hoechst,\nand today of CSL Behring. During these outbreaks, 31 people became infected and\nseven of them died. Marburg virus (MARV) causes severe disease in humans and\nnonhuman primates in the form of viral hemorrhagic fever. MARV is a Select\nAgent, WHO Risk Group 4 Pathogen (requiring\nbiosafety level 4-equivalent containment), NIH/National\nInstitute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Category A Priority Pathogen, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\nCategory A Bioterrorism Agent, and is\nlisted as a biological agent for export control by the Australia Group.\n","linknr":614,"url":"Marburg_virus","recorded":1362501554,"links":47,"instances":["biochemistry","tv_series","biology","film","biology","genetics","journal"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Animal diseases","Animal virology","Arthropod-borne viral fevers and viral haemorrhagic fevers","Biological weapons","Hemorrhagic fevers","Mononegavirales","RNA viruses","Tropical diseases","Viral diseases","Virus-related cutaneous conditions","Zoonoses"],"headings":["Use of term","Previous designations","Virus inclusion criteria","Disease","Virology","Ecology","Weaponization","Popular culture","Vaccine research","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["nature","journal"],["receptor","biochemistry"],["transcription","genetics"],["translation","biology"],["promoter","biology"],["millennium","tv_series"],["outbreak","film"]],"members":["receptor","millennium","promoter","outbreak","translation","transcription","nature"],"related":["Hemorrhagic_fever_virus","Epidemic","Marburg","Frankfurt","Belgrade","Grivet","CSL_Behring","Disease","Human","Primates","Viral_hemorrhagic_fever","Select_Agent","World_Health_Organization","Biosafety","National_Institutes_of_Health","National_Institute_of_Allergy_and_Infectious_Diseases","Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention","Bioterrorism","Australia_Group","International_Committee_on_Taxonomy_of_Viruses","International_Committee_on_Taxonomy_of_Viruses","International_Committee_on_Taxonomy_of_Viruses","International_Committee_on_Taxonomy_of_Viruses","Marburg","Hesse","West_Germany","Taxonomy","Suffix","International_Committee_on_Taxonomy_of_Viruses","Capitalization","Italic_type","Abbreviation","Marburg_marburgvirus","Genome","Nucleotide","Marburg_virus_disease","Marburg_virus_disease","Marburg","Frankfurt","Germany","Belgrade","Yugoslavia","Rhodesia","Johannesburg","South_Africa","Kenya","Kenya","Koltsovo,_Novosibirsk_Oblast","Soviet_Union","Koltsovo,_Novosibirsk_Oblast","Soviet_Union","Durba,_Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo","Watsa","Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo","Ravn_virus","Angola","Uganda","Uganda","Netherlands","Uganda","Mononegavirales","RNA","Genome","5'_cap","Polyadenylation","Covalent_bond","Protein","Base_pair","Gene","Three_prime_untranslated_region","Five_prime_untranslated_region","Nucleic_acid_sequence","Filoviridae","Width","Helical","Ribonucleoprotein","Polymer","Nucleoprotein","RNA-dependent_RNA_polymerase","Lipid_bilayer","Antigen","NPC1","Nature_(journal)","Ebola_virus","Niemann-Pick_disease,_type_C","Virus","Filovirus","Filovirus","Viral_envelope","Filovirus","Viral_envelope","Small_molecule","Biological_life_cycle","Receptor_(biochemistry)","Lipid_bilayer_fusion","Nucleocapsid","Cytosol","Transcription_(genetics)","Genes","MRNA","Translation_(biology)","Proteins","Promoter_(biology)","Nucleoprotein","Concentration","Cell_membrane","Budding","Rousettus_aegyptiacus","Old_World","Bat","Soviet_Union","Biological_warfare","Sergiev_Posad","State_Research_Center_of_Virology_and_Biotechnology_VECTOR","Koltsovo","Irkutsk","Classified_information","Defection","Ken_Alibek","Stepnagorsk_Scientific_and_Technical_Institute_for_Microbiology","Stepnogorsk","Kazakh_Soviet_Socialist_Republic","Kazakhstan","Richard_Preston","Millennium_(TV_series)","Prion","Seattle","New_York_City","Sarah_Jane_Smith","Doomsday_cult","Michael_Marshall_Smith","Douglas_Coupland","Common_cold","Harold_Coyle","Barrett_Tillman","Al-Qaeda","Pakistan","Pandemic","Mira_Grant","Outbreak_(film)"]}
