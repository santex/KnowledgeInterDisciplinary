{"cursor":"3856","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nIn the United Kingdom, Republic of Ireland, and parts of the Commonwealth,\n'consultant' is the title of a senior physician who has completed all of his or\nher specialist training and been placed on the 'specialist register' in their\nchosen speciality. Consultants accept ultimate responsibility for the care of\nall the patients referred to them, so the job carries significant\npersonal responsibility.\n\nA physician must be on the Specialist Register before he or she may be employed\nas a substantive consultant in the National Health Service. This usually entails\nholding a Certificate of Completion of Training in any of the recognised\nspecialities, but academics with substantial publications and international\nreputation may be exempted from this requirement, in the expectation that they\nwill practice at a tertiary level. \"Locum consultant\" appointments of limited\nduration may be given to those with clinical experience, with or without higher\nqualifications.\n\nVirtually all consultants in the UK are employed by the NHS, rendering the NHS a\nvirtual monopoly of career opportunities for the senior hospital physician\ncommunity in the UK, and apart from one or two specialites there are virtually\nno opportunities for consultants to earn a living completely outside of the NHS.\n\nA consultant typically leads a \"firm\" (team of doctors) which comprises\nSpecialty Registrars, and Foundation Doctors, all training to work in the\nconsultant's speciality, as well as other \"career grade\" doctors such as\nclinical assistants, clinical fellows, Speciality Doctors, Associate Specialists\nand staff grade doctors. They also have numerous other key roles in the\nfunctioning of hospitals and the wider health service.\n\nThe time required to become a consultant depends upon a number of factors, but\nprincipally the speciality chosen. Certain specialities require longer training,\nor are more competitive, and therefore becoming a consultant can take longer.\nOther specialities are relatively easy to progress through, and it is possible\nfor a doctor to become a consultant much earlier in his or her career. After\nModernising Medical Careers came into operation (in early 2007), the length of\ntraining was fixed for the majority of doctors, at about nine years.\n\nMost consultants work on a long-term contract with one or more hospital trusts,\nand these posts are known as substantive consultant positions. Various titles\n(such as senior consultant, clinical director, medical director, etc.) exist for\nconsultants who have particular responsibilities for the overall management of\nthe hospital. Consultants have the right to undertake private medical work\noutside of their contracted hours of work for the NHS.\n\nOther doctors - some without a CCT, a few who have only just obtained that\nqualification, and others who have retired from substantive appointments - may\nbe employed as locum consultants, who have the same clinical responsibility, but\nare typically on fixed, short-term contracts.\n","linknr":127,"url":"Medical_Consultant","recorded":1364038143,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Consultant_(medicine)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Consultant_(medicine)&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","/wiki/Consultant_(medicine)","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","/w/index.php?title=Medical_Consultant&redirect=no","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/Consultant_(disambiguation)","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Ambox_globe_content.svg/48px-Ambox_globe_content.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Countering_systemic_bias","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Consultant_(medicine)&action=edit","/wiki/Talk:Consultant_(medicine)","/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Consultant_(medicine)&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/United_Kingdom","/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland","/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations","/wiki/Physician","/wiki/Medical_specialist","#cite_note-1","/wiki/National_Health_Service","/wiki/Certificate_of_Completion_of_Training","/wiki/Specialty_Registrar","/wiki/Foundation_Doctor","/wiki/Staff_grade","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Modernising_Medical_Careers","/wiki/Hospital","/w/index.php?title=Consultant_(medicine)&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Attending_physician","/wiki/United_States_of_America","/wiki/Modernising_Medical_Careers","/wiki/Junior_doctor","/wiki/Specialist_registrar","/wiki/Specialty_registrar","/w/index.php?title=Consultant_(medicine)&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-1","http://www.bma.org.uk/images/roleofconsultant0708_tcm41-169893.pdf","http://www.bma.org.uk/images/roleofconsultant0708_tcm41-169893.pdf","#cite_ref-2","http://www.bma.org.uk/careers/becoming_doctor/roleofconsultant0708.jsp","http://www.bma.org.uk/careers/becoming_doctor/roleofconsultant0708.jsp","/wiki/National_Health_Service","/wiki/Modernising_Medical_Careers","/wiki/Pre-registration_house_officer","/wiki/Foundation_Doctor","/wiki/Senior_house_officer","/wiki/Specialty_Registrar","/wiki/Specialty_Registrar","/wiki/Specialist_registrar","/wiki/General_Practitioner#United_Kingdom","/wiki/General_Practitioner#United_Kingdom","/wiki/General_Practitioner#United_Kingdom","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Consultant_(medicine)&oldid=544342635","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Consulting_occupations","/wiki/Category:Healthcare_occupations_in_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_limited_geographic_scope_from_December_2010","/wiki/Category:United_Kingdom-centric","/wiki/Category:Pages_in_non-existent_country_centric_categories","/wiki/Category:Articles_lacking_sources_from_December_2009","/wiki/Category:All_articles_lacking_sources","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Consultant+%28medicine%29&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Consultant+%28medicine%29","/wiki/Consultant_(medicine)","/wiki/Talk:Consultant_(medicine)","#","/wiki/Consultant_(medicine)","/w/index.php?title=Consultant_(medicine)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Consultant_(medicine)&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Consultant_(medicine)","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Consultant_(medicine)","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Consultant_(medicine)&oldid=544342635","/w/index.php?title=Consultant_(medicine)&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Consultant_%28medicine%29&id=544342635","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Consultant+%28medicine%29","/w/index.php?ti
