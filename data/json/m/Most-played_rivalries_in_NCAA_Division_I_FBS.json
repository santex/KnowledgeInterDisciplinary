{"cursor":"18960","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"This is a list of the 'most played [[College rivalry|rivalries]] in the\n[[Football Bowl Subdivision]]' of NCAA Division I. The two teams that have\nplayed each other the most in college football are the Wisconsin Badgers and the\nMinnesota Golden Gophers who play for Paul Bunyan's Axe. Many rivalries follow\nclosely behind the border battle between Wisconsin and Minnesota. Rivalries are\nnot necessarily continuous: several rivalries played by the Nebraska Cornhuskers\nwere interrupted after the 2010 season by the team's move from the Big 12\nConference to the Big Ten as of the 2011 season. In addition to Nebraska-\nKansas, Nebraska-Iowa State, and Nebraska-Missouri, several others have been\nthreatened by other effects of the ongoing 2010â13 NCAA conference realignment.\nThese include Missouri-Kansas and Missouri-Iowa State due to Missouri's move to\nthe SEC, Texas-Texas A&M and Texas A&M-Baylor due to TAMU's move to the SEC, and\nPitt-WVU due to Pitt's move to the ACC and WVU's move to the Big 12. Conversely,\nTCU-Baylor has again become a conference game after TCU joining the Big 12,\nwhile Oklahoma-Kansas has once again become an annual game.\n\nThis table lists all rivalries with more than 100 games played. Wins and\nlosses are given respective to the team leading the series. {|\nclass=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! Games !! Series leader !! Opponent !! Rivalry or trophy name !! W !! L !! T !!\n!
