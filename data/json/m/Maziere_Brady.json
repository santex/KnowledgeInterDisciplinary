{"cursor":"4625","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Sir Maziere Brady, 1st Baronet' PC (20 July 1796 â 13 April 1871) was an Irish\njudge, notable for his exceptionally long tenure as Lord Chancellor of Ireland.\n\nBrady was born in Dublin, the second son of Francis Brady of Booterstown and his\nwife Charlotte Hodgson of Castledawson. He was the brother of Sir Nicholas\nBrady, Lord Mayor of Dublin, and uncle of the ecclesiastical historian William\nMaziere Brady. Educated at the University of Dublin, he was called to the Bar in\n1819 and became King's Counsel in 1835.\n\nIn politics he was a Liberal and supported Catholic Emancipation. He was\nappointed Solicitor-General for Ireland in 1837 and Attorney-General for Ireland\nthe following year. In 1840 he was appointed Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer\nin Ireland. In 1846 he was appointed Lord Chancellor of Ireland and served in\nthat office, with short intervals for 20 years. He retired in 1866 and was made\na baronet, of Hazelbrook in the County of Dublin, in 1869. His appointment ended\nthe practice which grew up after the Act of Union (1800) of appointing only\nEnglish lawyers as Chancellor. He sat on the Government Commission on Trinity\nCollege Dublin in 1851.\n\nAccording to Elrington Ball, Brady's Lord Chancellorship was notable for length\nbut nothing else; by general agreement he was an excellent Chief Baron, but the\nmore onerous and largely political office of Chancellor was beyond his capacity;\nunlike some judges whose training was in the common law, he never mastered the\nseparate code of equity. Ball, F. Elrington The Judges in Ireland 1221-\n1921, John Murray, London, 1926. Delaney takes a somewhat more favourable\nview of Brady as a judge, arguing that while his judgements do not show any\ndepth of learning they do show an ability to quickly identify the central issue\nof any case and the applicable legal principle. Delaney, V.T.H. Christopher\nPalles Alan Figgis and Co. Dublin 1960 An anonymous pamphlet from 1850,\nhighly critical of the Irish judges generally, described Brady as unable to keep\norder in his Court, and easily intimidated by counsel.\n\nHe was a founder member of the Stephen's Green Club and a member of the Royal\nDublin Society and the Royal Irish Academy.\n\nBrady married Elizabeth Buchanan in 1823 and they had five children, including\nFrancis who succeeded to the title and followed his father to the Bar. Elizabeth\ndied in 1858; in 1860 Brady remarried Mary Hatchell.\n","linknr":125,"url":"Maziere_Brady","recorded":1375066026,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Maziere_Brady&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Maziere_Brady&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Privy_Council_of_Ireland","/wiki/Ireland","/wiki/Lord_Chancellor_of_Ireland","/wiki/Dublin","/wiki/Booterstown","/wiki/Castledawson","/wiki/Lord_Mayor_of_Dublin","/wiki/William_Maziere_Brady","/wiki/University_of_Dublin","/wiki/Call_to_the_Bar","/wiki/King%27s_Counsel","/wiki/Liberal_Party_(UK)","/wiki/Catholic_Emancipation","/wiki/Solicitor-General_for_Ireland","/wiki/Attorney-General_for_Ireland","/wiki/Lord_Chief_Baron_of_the_Exchequer_(Ireland)","/wiki/Lord_Chancellor_of_Ireland","/wiki/Baronet","/wiki/Acts_of_Union_1800","/wiki/Trinity_College_Dublin","/wiki/Common_law","/wiki/Equity_(law)","#cite_note-1","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Royal_Dublin_Society","/wiki/Royal_Irish_Academy","/w/index.php?title=Maziere_Brady&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","#cite_ref-2","/wiki/Stephen_Woulfe","/wiki/Solicitor-General_for_Ireland","/wiki/David_Richard_Pigot","/wiki/Nicholas_Ball_(lawyer)","/wiki/Attorney-General_for_Ireland","/wiki/David_Richard_Pigot","/wiki/Stephen_Woulfe","/wiki/Lord_Chief_Baron_of_the_Exchequer_(Ireland)","/wiki/David_Richard_Pigot","/wiki/Edward_Sugden,_1st_Baron_St_Leonards","/wiki/Lord_Chancellor_of_Ireland","/wiki/Francis_Blackburne","/wiki/Francis_Blackburne","/wiki/Lord_Chancellor_of_Ireland","/wiki/Sir_Joseph_Napier,_1st_Baronet","/wiki/Sir_Joseph_Napier,_1st_Baronet","/wiki/Lord_Chancellor_of_Ireland","/wiki/Francis_Blackburne","/wiki/List_of_extant_baronetcies","/wiki/Brady_baronets","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Maziere_Brady&oldid=542266437","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Irish_judges","/wiki/Category:Irish_barristers","/wiki/Category:Attorneys-General_for_Ireland","/wiki/Category:Lord_Chancellors_of_Ireland","/wiki/Category:1871_deaths","/wiki/Category:1796_births","/wiki/Category:Baronets_in_the_Baronetage_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Category:Members_of_the_Privy_Council_of_Ireland","/wiki/Category:Alumni_of_Trinity_College,_Dublin","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Maziere+Brady&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Maziere+Brady","/wiki/Maziere_Brady","/wiki/Talk:Maziere_Brady","#","/wiki/Maziere_Brady","/w/index.php?title=Maziere_Brady&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Maziere_Brady&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Maziere_Brady","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Maziere_Brady","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Maziere_Brady&oldid=542266437","/w/index.php?title=Maziere_Brady&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Maziere_Brady&id=542266437","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Maziere+Brady","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Maziere+Brady&oldid=542266437&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Maziere_Brady&printable=yes","#","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maziere_Brady","//wikimediafounda
