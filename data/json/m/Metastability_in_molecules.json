{"cursor":"13081","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n'Metastability' describes the behaviour of certain physical systems that can\nexist in long lived states that are less stable than the system's most\nstable state.\n\nThe parameters of excited systems may reach and hold stationary values (a\nmetastable state). But metastable states have finite lifetimes. After a\n(potentially very long) period of time, spontaneously or under an external\naction, the characteristic parameters of the state change again to relax to a\nmore stable state.\n\nA single particle analogy may be drawn with a ball resting in a hollow on a\nslope. With some perturbation the ball may start rolling again to lower levels.\nIsomerisation is another common example, where higher energy isomers are long\nlived as they are prevented from rearranging to the ground state by (possibly\nlarge) barriers in the potential energy.\n\nThe metastability concept originates in the physics of first-order phase\ntransitions later to acquire new meanings in the study of aggregated subatomic\nparticles (in atomic nuclei or in atoms) or in molecules, macromolecules or\nclusters of atoms and molecules. Later on it was borrowed for the study of decision-\nmaking and information transmitting systems.\n\nMany complex natural and man-made systems can demonstrate metastability.\n*Metastability is common in physics and chemistry - from an atom (many-body\nassembly) to statistical ensembles of molecules (viscous fluids, amorphous\nsolids, liquid crystals etc.) at molecular levels or as a whole (see metastable\nphases of matter and grain piles below). The abundance of states is more\nprevalent as the systems grow larger and/or if the forces of their mutual\ninteraction are spatially less uniform or more diverse. *In dynamic systems\n(with feedback) like electronic circuits, signal trafficking, decisional systems\nand neuroscience - it is the time-invariance of the active or reactive patterns\nwith respect to the external influences that defines stability and metastability\n(see brain metastability below). Here the equivalent of the thermal fluctuations\nis the \"white noise\" affecting the signal propagation and the decision-making.\n","linknr":248,"url":"Metastability_in_molecules","recorded":1362486024,"links":38,"instances":["biochemistry","materials_science","physics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Dynamical systems","Chemical properties"],"headings":["Statistical physics and thermodynamics","Quantum mechanics","Electronic circuits","Computational neuroscience","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a0/Meta-stability.svg/250px-Meta-stability.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a9/MtBaker-Chair8-Top.jpg/300px-MtBaker-Chair8-Top.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["sublimation","physics"],["polymorphism","materials_science"],["polymorphism","materials_science"],["cofactor","biochemistry"]],"members":["cofactor","polymorphism","sublimation"],"related":["Ground_state","Isomer","Ground_state","Subatomic_particle","Physics","Chemistry","Systems_dynamics","Feedback","Non-equilibrium_thermodynamics","Chemical_kinetics","Metastable_phase","States_of_matter","Sublimation_(Physics)","Supercooling","Superheating","Crystal_structure","Diamond","Standard_conditions_for_temperature_and_pressure","Graphite","Activation_energy","Martensite","Polymer","DNA","RNA","Protein","Polymorphism_(materials_science)","Quartz","Allotropes","Boron","Emulsion","Colloid","Glass","Bak–Tang–Wiesenfeld_sandpile","Sand","Friction","Avalanche","Subatomic_particle","Quantum_mechanics","Quarks","Nucleons","Atomic_nucleus","Electron","Atom","Molecule","Atomic_clusters","Degenerate_energy_levels","Ground_state","Global_minimum","Half-life","Chemical_stability","Maxima_and_minima","Absolute_zero","Quantum_tunnelling","Atomic_nucleus","Isotope","Technetium-99m","Rydberg_atom","Selection_rule","Population_inversion","Chemical_bond","Temperature","Isomerism","Temperature","Pressure","Polymorphism_(materials_science)","Phase_diagram","Reaction_intermediate","International_Union_of_Pure_and_Applied_Chemistry","Chaos_theory","Resonance","Stimulated_emission","Catalyst","Potential","Macromolecule","Enzyme","Cofactor_(biochemistry)","Metastability_in_electronics","Metastability_in_the_brain","Computational_neuroscience","Hysteresis"]}
