He was caught in\n1999, and in 2004 was sentenced to 200 months in prison based on over $200\nmillion in proven losses to insurance companies he bought then looted; the\nsentence was reaffirmed in 2006.\n\nMarty Frankel was born to Leon and Tilly Frankel in 1954; he was Leon's fourth\nchild and Tilly's second. He attended the University of Toledo but never\ngraduated.\n\nFrankel used astrology to make financial trading decisions. In addition, he\nusually could not bring himself to actually make trades, causing trouble for him\nwith the brokerage firms he worked for. After being fired by his boss John\nSchulte in 1986, Frankel set up 'Winthrop Capital' using the phony name of\n'James Spencer'. He also set up 'The Frankel Fund' with Douglas Maxwell, but\nremained reluctant to buy or hold his chosen investments.\n\nFrankel moved to Florida in 1987, and attracted Palm Beach investors, but the\nFrankel Fund lost money on trades, and Frankel was using shareholder accounts to\npaying expenses, including rent, stock-quote services, and personal spending\nmoney for himself, his sister, and his mother. By mid-\n1988, he was also raiding some investor's accounts to cash out other, worried\ninvestors who were pulling out their money. He transferred the remaining funds to his personal account and told his\nremaining investor that the fund had collapsed due to Maxwell's bad trades and\nembezzlement. Frankel gave the funds to an attorney, but the funds were then\nturned over to the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nFrankel moved back to Toledo and started a new firm, 'Creative Partners', while\nthe SEC was investigating him, using the name 'Rothschild International\nInvestments' and a Swiss bank account to separate Creative Partners from his own\nname and ongoing investigation. By this time, his former boss's wife, Sonia\nSchulte, was divorcing. Sonia Schulte set up a brokerage in direct competition\nwith her husband's and directed her clients to Creative Partners; meanwhile,\nFrankel set up another company, 'Donar Corporation', which paid for Sonia\nSchulte's new house, and paid Sonia's divorce and custody lawyers over $300,000\nout of the Swiss bank account.\n\n\n\nAfter paying a fine and agreeding to be barred from trading by the Securities\nand Exchange Commission in 1992, Frankel used several aliases, including 'David\nRosse'.\n\nIn an attempt to use the Roman Catholic Church to discourage questions of\nlegitimacy, Frankel founded the 'St. Francis of Assisi\nFoundation' in the British Virgin Islands, with a nominal mission of investing\nin insurance companies in order to fund hospitals. Among people solicited to join the Foundation board was retired\n[[CBS Evening News]] anchorman Walter Cronkite; when he declined to join, his\nname was used anyway. An official of the Roman\nCuria, Monsignor Emilio Colagiovanni, agreed to sign a letter falsely stating\nthat the Foundation received funding from the Vatican.\n\n\n\nFrankel fled the United States in May 1999. He\nwent by private plane to Rome and then to Hamburg, Germany, where he was arrested on September 4. He was first\ntried and sentenced in Germany to three years in jail for passport fraud. He was\nthen extradited to the U.S. in 2001.\n\nColagiovanni was arrested in Cleveland, Ohio on August 30, 2001.\n\nIn May 2002, Frankel plead guilty to 24 federal counts of securities fraud, wire\nfraud, and related racketeering and conspiracy. Fifteen of\nFrankel's associates, including Colagiovanni and Sonia Schulte, also pled guilty\nto related crimes. By the time Frankel was first\nsentenced in December 2004, sixteen of his accomplices had been convicted. Frankel told the judge that most of his behavior was to\nearn enough money to provide for Sonia Schulte (by then Sonia Howe) and her two\nchildren; after this, the judge asked \"So, you stole $209 million in order to\ntake care of the children?\" Frankel then explained that he could not end the\nscheme without it coming apart, and asked the judge to consider that deterrence\nshould not be a factor in his sentencing because \"If somebody is mentally ill,\nyou shouldn't punish them because it won't stop other mentally ill people from\ndoing it.\" Frankel was sentenced to 200 months (16\nyears 8 months) in federal prison; a state court in Tennessee also sentenced\nFrankel to 16 years, which was allowed to run concurrently on the condition that\nhe assist officials in recovering lost assets looted from his Tennessee\ninsurance companies.\n\nSeveral states put Frankel's insurance companies into receivership when it was\ndiscovered the companies' primary assets were investments in Frankel's own shell\ncompany; among the states affected were Arkansas, Mississippi, Missouri,\nOklahoma, Tennessee, and Virginia.\n","linknr":223,"url":"Martin_Frankel","recorded":1374760438,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Martin_Frankel&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Martin_Frankel&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","#cite_note-pressman-1","/wiki/United_States","#cite_note-pressman-1","#cite_note-cbsnews-vanishing-2","#cite_note-pressman-1","/wiki/Conviction","/wiki/Guilty_plea","/w/index.php?title=Conspriacy&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Racketeering","/wiki/Securities_fraud","/wiki/Wire_fraud","#cite_note-nyt-affirmed-3","#cite_note-pressman-1","/wiki/U.S._Bureau_of_Prisons","#cite_note-4","#cite_note-nyt-affirmed-3","#cite_note-5","/wiki/Money_manager","#cite_note-pressman-1","/wiki/Financial_crime","/wiki/Investment_fraud","/wiki/Insurance_company","#cite_note-nyt-affirmed-3","/wiki/University_of_Toledo","#cite_note-pressman-1","/wiki/Astrology","/wiki/Brokerage_firm","#cite_note-pressman-1","#cite_note-cnbc-ag-tv-6","/wiki/Palm_Beach,_Florida","#cite_note-pressman-1","#cite_note-pressman-1","#cite_note-cnbc-ag-tv-6","/wiki/Securities_and_Exchange_Commission","#cite_note-pressman-1","/wiki/Swiss_bank_account","#cite_note-pressman-1","/wiki/File:Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg/20px-Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg.png","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Martin_Frankel&action=edit","/wiki/Securities_and_Exchange_Commission","#cite_note-cbsnews-vanishing-2","/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Church","#cite_note-cnbc-ag-tv-6","/wiki/British_Virgin_Islands","#cite_note-cbsnews-vanishing-2","/wiki/CBS_Evening_News","/wiki/Walter_Cronkite","#cite_note-cbsnews-vanishing-2","/wiki/Roman_Curia","/wiki/Monsignor","/wiki/Holy_See","#cite_note-cnbc-ag-tv-6","#cite_note-ncr-complicity-7","/wiki/File:Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg/20px-Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg.png","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Martin_Frankel&action=edit","#cite_note-nyt-looting-8","/wiki/Rome","/wiki/Hamburg,_Germany","#cite_note-cnbc-ag-tv-6","#cite_note-pressman-1","#cite_note-pressman-1","/wiki/Cleveland,_Ohio","#cite_note-ncr-complicity-7","/wiki/Securities_fraud","/wiki/Wire_fraud","/wiki/Racketeering","/wiki/Conspiracy_(crime)","#cite_note-pressman-1","#cite_note-cnbc-ag-tv-6","#cite_note-nyt-looting-8","#cite_note-nyt-looting-8","/wiki/Concurrent_sentence","#cite_note-pressman-1","#cite_note-cbsnews-vanishing-2","/w/index.php?title=Martin_Frankel&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-pressman_1-0","#cite_ref-pressman_1-1","#cite_ref-pressman_1-2","#cite_ref-pressman_1-3","#cite_ref-pressman_1-4","#cite_ref-pressman_1-5","#cite_ref-pressman_1-6","#cite_ref-pressman_1-7","#cite_ref-pressman_1-8","#cite_ref-pressman_1-9","#cite_ref-pressman_1-10","#cite_ref-pressman_1-11","#cite_ref-pressman_1-12","#cite_ref-pressman_1-13","#cite_ref-pressman_1-14","/wiki/Digital_object_identifier","http://dx.doi.org/10.1201%2F9781420072860.ch10","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Special:BookSources/978-1-4200-7286-0","/wiki/Help:CS1_errors#accessdate_missing_url","#cite_ref-cbsnews-vanishing_2-0","#cite_ref-cbsnews-vanishing_2-1","#cite_ref-cbsnews-vanishing_2-2","#cite_ref-cbsnews-vanishing_2-3","#cite_ref-cbsnews-vanishing_2-4","http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/1999/06/22/national/main51571.shtml","/wiki/WCBS-TV","/wiki/CBS_News","#cite_ref-nyt-affirmed_3-0","#cite_ref-nyt-affirmed_3-1","#cite_ref-nyt-affirmed_3-2","http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/24/business/24frankel.html?_r=2","/wiki/New_Haven,_Connecticut","/wiki/Associated_Press","#cite_ref-4","http://www.bop.gov/locations/institutions/ftd/index.jsp","#cite_ref-5","http://www.bop.gov/iloc2/InmateFinderServlet?Transaction=NameSearch&needingMoreList=false&FirstName=martin&Middle=&LastName=frankel&Race=U&Sex=M&Age=&x=114&y=11","#cite_ref-cnbc-ag-tv_6-0","#cite_ref-cnbc-ag-tv_6-1","#cite_ref-cnbc-ag-tv_6-2","#cite_ref-cnbc-ag-tv_6-3","#cite_ref-cnbc-ag-tv_6-4","#cite_ref-cnbc-ag-tv_6-5","http://www.cnbc.com/id/19279099/","/wiki/American_Greed","/wiki/CNBC","http://www.cnbc.com/id/19279099/","#cite_ref-ncr-complicity_7-0","#cite_ref-ncr-complicity_7-1","http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1141/is_39_37/ai_787
