{"cursor":"15490","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"{{Infobox disease | Name = Maternal death | ICD10 = O95 | ICD9 = | }}\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), 'maternal death' is defined as\nthe death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of\npregnancy, irrespective of the duration and site of the pregnancy, from any\ncause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management but not from\naccidental or incidental\ncauses.\" [http://www.cahr.info/index_files/page0023.htm Maternal Mortality\nin Central Asia], Central Asia Health Review (CAHR), 2 June 2008\n\nGenerally, there is a distinction between a 'direct maternal death' that is the\nresult of a complication of the pregnancy, delivery, or management of the two,\nand an 'indirect maternal death' that is a pregnancy-related death in a patient\nwith a preexisting or newly developed health problem unrelated to pregnancy.\nFatalities during but unrelated to a pregnancy are termed accidental,\nincidental, or 'nonobstetrical' maternal deaths.\n\nThe U.S. Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations calls\nmaternal mortality a \"sentinel event\", and uses it to assess the quality of a\nhealth care system.\n\nHowever, a number of issues need to be recognized. First of all, the WHO\ndefinition is only one of many; other definitions may also include accidental\nand incidental causes. Cases with \"incidental causes\" include deaths secondary\nto violence against women that may be related to the pregnancy and be affected\nby the socioeconomic and cultural environment. Also, it has been reported that\nabout 10% of maternal deaths may occur late, that is after 42 days after a\ntermination or delivery, {{cite journal\n  | last = Koonin first = Lisa M. authorlink = coauthors = Hani K.
