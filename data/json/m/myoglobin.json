{"cursor":"13653","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Myoglobin' is an iron- and oxygen-binding protein found in the muscle tissue of\nvertebrates in general and in almost all mammals. It is related to hemoglobin,\nwhich is the iron- and oxygen-binding protein in blood, specifically in the red\nblood cells. The only time myoglobin is found in the bloodstream is when it is\nreleased following muscle injury. It is an abnormal finding, and can be\ndiagnostically relevant when found in blood. \n\nMyoglobin (abbreviated Mb) is a single-chain globular protein of 153\nor 154 amino acids, containing a heme (iron-containing\nporphyrin) prosthetic group in the center around which the remaining apoprotein\nfolds. It has eight alpha helices and a hydrophobic core. It has a molecular\nweight of 17,699 daltons (with heme), and is the primary oxygen-carrying pigment\nof muscle tissues. Unlike the blood-borne hemoglobin,\nto which it is structurally related, this protein does\nnot exhibit cooperative binding of oxygen, since positive cooperativity is a\nproperty of multimeric/oligomeric proteins only. High concentrations of\nmyoglobin in muscle cells allow organisms to hold their breaths longer. Diving\nmammals such as whales and seals have muscles with particularly high myoglobin\nabundance.\n\nMyoglobin was the first protein to have its three-dimensional structure\nrevealed.

For this discovery, John Kendrew\nshared the 1962 Nobel Prize in chemistry with Max Perutz. [http://nobelprize.org/chemistry/laureates/1962/index.html The\nNobel Prize in Chemistry 1962] Despite being one of the most studied\nproteins in biology, its true physiological function is not yet conclusively\nestablished: mice genetically engineered to lack myoglobin are viable, but\nshowed a 30% reduction in cardiac systolic output. They adapted to this\ndeficiency through hypoxic genetic mechanisms and increased vasodilation. In humans myoglobin is encoded by the MB gene.\n","linknr":629,"url":"myoglobin","recorded":1362896565,"links":67,"instances":["chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Hemoproteins","Human proteins"],"headings":["Meat color","Role in disease","Structure and bonding","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/Myoglobin.png/250px-Myoglobin.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f4/PBB_GE_MB_204179_at_tn.png/250px-PBB_GE_MB_204179_at_tn.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/PDB_1m6c_EBI.jpg/180px-PDB_1m6c_EBI.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cf/PDB_1m6m_EBI.jpg/180px-PDB_1m6m_EBI.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/90/PDB_1mdn_EBI.jpg/180px-PDB_1mdn_EBI.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/PDB_1mnh_EBI.jpg/180px-PDB_1mnh_EBI.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/90/PDB_1mni_EBI.jpg/180px-PDB_1mni_EBI.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/PDB_1mnj_EBI.jpg/180px-PDB_1mnj_EBI.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1e/PDB_1mnk_EBI.jpg/180px-PDB_1mnk_EBI.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d1/PDB_1mno_EBI.jpg/180px-PDB_1mno_EBI.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/PDB_1mwc_EBI.jpg/180px-PDB_1mwc_EBI.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6d/PDB_1mwd_EBI.jpg/180px-PDB_1mwd_EBI.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0a/PDB_1myg_EBI.jpg/180px-PDB_1myg_EBI.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d0/PDB_1myh_EBI.jpg/180px-PDB_1myh_EBI.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/PDB_1myi_EBI.jpg/180px-PDB_1myi_EBI.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/PDB_1myj_EBI.jpg/180px-PDB_1myj_EBI.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/25/PDB_1pmb_EBI.jpg/180px-PDB_1pmb_EBI.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6a/PDB_1yca_EBI.jpg/180px-PDB_1yca_EBI.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b5/PDB_1ycb_EBI.jpg/180px-PDB_1ycb_EBI.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b9/PDB_2mm1_EBI.jpg/180px-PDB_2mm1_EBI.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["moiety","chemistry"]],"members":["moiety"],"related":["Protein","Hemoglobin","Tertiary_structure","Amino_acid","Heme","Iron","Porphyrin","Prosthetic_group","Atomic_mass_unit","Oxygen","Biological_pigment","Muscle","Hemoglobin","Cooperative_binding","Oligomer","John_Kendrew","X-ray_crystallography","Nobel_Prize_in_chemistry","Max_Perutz","Gene","Pigment","Red_meat","Well_done","Nitrites","Nitric_oxide","Corned_beef","Ham","Smoke_ring","Rhabdomyolysis","Kidneys","Acute_renal_failure","Protoxin","Ferrihemate","Lysosome","Myocardial_infarction","Chest_pain","Myocardial_infarction","Creatine_kinase","Troponin","Electrocardiogram","Porphyrin","James_P._Collman","Prosthetic_group","Hydrogen_bond","Moiety_(chemistry)","Carbon_monoxide","Histidine","Heme","Hemoglobin","Protein_dimer","Oxymyoglobin","Deoxymyoglobin","Hemoglobin","Neuroglobin","Cytoglobin","Hemoprotein"]}
