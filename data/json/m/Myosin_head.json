Myosin is a major component of thick\nfilaments and exists as a hexamer of 2 heavy chains, 2 alkali light chains, and 2 regulatory light chains.\nThe heavy chain can be subdivided into the N-terminal globular head and the C-\nterminal coiled-coil rod-like tail, although some forms have a globular region\nin their C-terminal. There are many cell-specific isoforms of myosin heavy\nchains, coded for by a multi-gene family. Myosin\ninteracts with actin to convert chemical energy, in the form of ATP, to\nmechanical energy. The 3-D structure of the head\nportion of myosin has been determined  and a model\nfor actin-myosin complex has been constructed.\n\nThe globular head is well conserved, and is key to\ncontraction. Muscle contraction results from an attachmentâdetachment cycle\nbetween the myosin heads extending from myosin filaments and the sites on actin\nfilaments. The myosin head first attaches to actin together with the products of\nATP hydrolysis, performs a power stroke associated with release of hydrolysis\nproducts, and detaches from actin upon binding with new ATP. The detached myosin\nhead then hydrolyses ATP, and performs a recovery stroke to restore its initial\nposition. The strokes have been suggested to result from rotation of the lever\narm domain around the converter domain, while the catalytic domain remains\nrigid.\n","linknr":167,"url":"Myosin_head","recorded":1362890378,"links":11,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Protein domains"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b9/PDB_1kk7_EBI.jpg/220px-PDB_1kk7_EBI.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Muscle","Muscle_contraction","Protein_filament","Myosin","Protein_filament","Polymer","Gene_regulation","Coiled_coil","Isoforms","Genetic_code","Protein-protein_interaction","Actin","Energy","Protein_complex"]}
