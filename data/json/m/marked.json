It explores the world of tattoos\nbelonging to modern day tribes that operate at the edges of society, including\nmotorcycle clubs, urban gangs, and hardcore prisoners.\n\nThe show takes the viewer into the minds of members as they explain what the\nmysterious symbols decorating their bodies mean on the street, and mean to them\npersonally. Initiation rites, turf wars, and the fierce pride of belonging to an\noutlaw family are all part of the territory. Tattoo artists and cultural experts\nexplain the technique and history behind the ink and the groups it adorns,\nputting the personal experiences of the main characters into perspective. h-\nttp://www.history.com/shows.do?episodeId=472836&action=detail\n","linknr":79,"url":"marked","recorded":1362572604,"links":10,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["American documentary television series","History (TV channel) original programs"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["history","u.s._tv_channel"]],"members":["history"],"related":["NorthSouth_Productions","History_(U.S._TV_channel)","Tattoo","Motorcycle_club","Turf_war"]}
