      "text" : "\n\n\n\n'Manslaughter' is a legal term for the killing of a human being, in a manner\nconsidered by law as less culpable than murder. The distinction between murder\nand manslaughter is said to have first been made by the Ancient Athenian\nlawmaker Draco in the 7th century BCE.<ref>Ehrenberg, Victor. From Solon to\nSocrates. London & New York: Routledge, 2010. p. 46.</ref>\n\nThe definition of manslaughter differs from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. The\nlaw generally differentiates between levels of criminal culpability based on the\n[[mens rea]], or state of mind; or the circumstances under which the killing\noccurred (mitigating factors). Manslaughter is usually broken down into two\ndistinct categories: [[#Voluntary manslaughter|voluntary manslaughter]] and\n[[#Involuntary manslaughter|involuntary manslaughter]]; however, this is not the\ncase in all jurisdictions.<ref>See, e.g., </ref>\n\nIn some jurisdictions, such as the UK, Canada and some Australian states\nprovocation (or \"loss of control\" in English law) is a partial defence to a\ncharge of murder which acts by converting what would otherwise have been murder\ninto manslaughter.\n",
