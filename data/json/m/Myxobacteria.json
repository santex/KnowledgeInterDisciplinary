The myxobacteria have very large genomes, relative to other\nbacteria, e.g. 9â10 million nucleotides. [[Sorangium cellulosum]] has the\nlargest known (as of 2008) bacterial genome, at 13.0 million nucleotides. Myxobacteria are included among the delta group of\nproteobacteria, a large taxon of Gram-negative forms.\n\nMyxobacteria can move actively by gliding. They typically travel in [[swarm]]s\n(also known as wolf packs), containing many cells kept together by intercellular\nmolecular signals. Individuals benefit from aggregation as it allows\naccumulation of extracellular enzymes which are used to digest food, this in\nturn increases feeding efficiency. Myxobacteria produce a number of biomedically\nand industrially useful chemicals, such as antibiotics, and export those\nchemicals outside of the cell.\n","linknr":180,"url":"Myxobacteria","recorded":1362483717,"links":26,"instances":["biology","chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Proteobacteria"],"headings":["Life cycle","Clinical use","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/02/Myxococcus_xanthus.png/220px-Myxococcus_xanthus.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cell","biology"],["analog","chemistry"]],"members":["cell","analog"],"related":["Bacteria","Proteobacteria","Bacteria","Genome","Nucleotide","Deltaproteobacteria","Proteobacteria","Gram-negative","Bacterial_gliding","Cell_(biology)","Signal_transduction","Enzyme","Antibiotic","Fruiting_body","Chemotaxis","Spore","Cell_growth","Amoebae","Slime_mould","Pxr_sRNA","Metabolites","Epothilone","Antineoplastic","Analog_(chemistry)","Ixabepilone","U.S._Food_and_Drug_Administration","Metastatic","Breast_cancer"]}
