The best known mouse species is the common house mouse\n(Mus musculus). It is also a popular pet. In some places, certain kinds of field\nmice are also common. This rodent is eaten by large birds such as hawks and\neagles. They are known to invade homes for food and occasionally shelter.\n\nThe American white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus) and the deer mouse\n([[Peromyscus maniculatus]]), as well as other common species of mouse-like\nrodents around the world, also sometimes live in houses. These, however, are in\nother genera.\n\nCats, wild dogs, foxes, birds of prey, snakes and even certain kinds of\narthropods have been known to prey heavily upon mice. Nevertheless, because of\nits remarkable adaptability to almost any environment, the mouse is one of the\nmost successful mammalian genera living on Earth today.\n\nMice can at times be vermin, damaging and eating crops,<ref></ref> causing\nstructural damage and spreading diseases through their parasites and\nfeces.<ref></ref> In North America, breathing dust that has come in contact with\nmouse excrement has been linked to hantavirus, which may lead to Hantavirus\nPulmonary Syndrome (HPS).\n\nPrimarily nocturnal<ref name=\"noc1\">[http://www.jstor.org/pss/1374418 Behney -\nExplorations of Deer-Mouse]</ref><ref\nname=\"noc2\">[http://www.santharia.com/bestiary/field_mouse.htm The Field\nMouse]</ref> animals, mice compensate for their poor eyesight with a keen sense\nof hearing, and rely especially on their sense of smell to locate food and avoid\npredators.<ref>[http://www.hsus.org/animals_in_research/species_used_in_researc-\nh/mouse.html The Humane society of the United States]</ref>\n\nMice and rats are the most commonly used animals for laboratory\ntests.<ref></ref>\n\nMice build intricate burrows in the wild. These burrows typically have long\nentrances and are equipped with escape tunnels/routes. There is some evidence\nfrom a new study that indicates that the architectural design of a burrow is a\nresult of what is pre-written in a mouse's DNA.<ref>http://www.nature.com/natur-\ne/journal/v493/n7432/full/nature11816.html</ref>\n",
