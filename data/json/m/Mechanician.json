{"cursor":"5028","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":":\"Mechanist\" redirects here. For a person who subscribes to the philosophy, see\n:[[Mechanism (philosophy)]].\nA 'mechanician' is an engineer or a scientist working in the field of mechanics,\nor in a related or sub-field: engineering or computational mechanics, applied\nmechanics, geomechanics, biomechanics, and mechanics of materials. Names other\nthan mechanician have been used occasionally, such as 'mechaniker' and\n'mechanicist'.\n\nThe term \"mechanician\" is also used by the Irish Navy to refer to junior engine\nroom ratings. In the British Royal Navy, Chief Mechanicians and Mechanicians 1st\nClass were Chief Petty Officers, Mechanicians 2nd and 3rd Class were Petty\nOfficers, Mechanicians 4th Class were Leading Ratings, and Mechanicians 5th\nClass were Able Ratings. The rate was only applied to certain\ntechnical specialists and no longer exists.\n\nIn the New Zealand Post Office, which provided telephone service prior to the\nformation of Telecom New Zealand in 1987, \"Mechanician\" was a job classification\nfor workers who serviced telephone exchange switching equipment. The term seems\nto have originated in the era of the 7A Rotary system exchange, and was\nsuperseded by \"Technician\" circa 1960, perhaps because \"Mechanician\" was no\nlonger considered appropriate after the first Strowger switch exchanges began to\nbe introduced in 1952 (in Auckland, at Birkenhead, New Zealand exchange).\n\nIt is also the term by which makers of mechanical automata use in reference to\ntheir profession.\n","linknr":194,"url":"Mechanician","recorded":1362565213,"links":14,"instances":["physics","physics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Mechanics"],"headings":["People who made lasting contributions to mechanics prior to the 20th century","People who made lasting contributions to mechanics and died during or after the 20th century","Honors and awards","Footnotes","See also","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["elasticity","physics"],["elasticity","physics"],["elasticity","physics"],["elasticity","physics"],["elasticity","physics"],["plasticity","physics"],["plasticity","physics"]],"members":["plasticity","elasticity"],"related":["Mechanics","Computational_mechanics","Applied_mechanics","Geomechanics","Biomechanics","Mechanics_of_materials","Irish_Navy","United_Kingdom","Royal_Navy","Chief_Petty_Officer","Petty_Officer","Leading_Rating","Able_Rating","New_Zealand_Post_Office","Telecom_New_Zealand","Rotary_system","Strowger_switch","Auckland","Birkenhead,_New_Zealand","Automata","Ibn_al-Haytham","Mass","Acceleration","Gravity","Inertia","Newton's_laws_of_motion","Guillaume_Amontons","Friction","Augustin_Louis_Cauchy","Elasticity_(physics)","Leonhard_Euler","Buckling","Rigid_body_dynamics","Galileo_Galilei","Strength_of_materials","Josiah_Willard_Gibbs","Thermodynamics","William_Rowan_Hamilton","Hamiltonian_mechanics","Heinrich_Rudolf_Hertz","Contact_mechanics","Robert_Hooke","Hooke's_law","Gustav_Kirchhoff","Theory_of_plates","Joseph_Louis_Lagrange","Lagrangian_mechanics","Pierre-Simon_Laplace","Surface_tension","Claude-Louis_Navier","Elasticity_(physics)","Fluid_mechanics","Sophie_Germain","Elasticity_(physics)","Isaac_Newton","Newton's_laws","Law_of_gravitation","Siméon_Denis_Poisson","Elasticity_(physics)","Adhémar_Jean_Claude_Barré_de_Saint-Venant","Elasticity_(physics)","George_Gabriel_Stokes","Fluid_mechanics","Stephen_Timoshenko","Ludwig_Burmester","John_D._Eshelby","Alan_Arnold_Griffith","Fracture_mechanics","George_Rankine_Irwin","Fracture_mechanics","Theodore_von_Karman","Fluid_mechanics","Structural_instability","Warner_T._Koiter","Solid_mechanics","Structural_instability","Richard_Edler_von_Mises","Plasticity_(physics)","Lasse_Hiller","Ludwig_Prandtl","Fluid_mechanics","Plasticity_(physics)","Geoffrey_Ingram_Taylor","Fluid_mechanics","Dislocations","Applied_Mechanics_Division","American_Society_of_Mechanical_Engineers","Timoshenko_Medal","Koiter_Medal","Drucker_Medal","Thomas_K._Caughey_Dynamics_Award","Ted_Belytschko_Applied_Mechanics_Award","Thomas_J.R._Hughes_Young_Investigator_Award","American_Society_of_Civil_Engineers","Theodore_von_Karman","Society_of_Engineering_Science,_Inc.","William_Prager","G._I._Taylor","Applied_mechanics","Mechanics","Geomechanics","Biomechanics","Materials_Science_and_Engineering","Structural_analysis","Fluid_Mechanics"]}
