For example, the number of times a given\npolynomial equation has a root at a given point.\n\nThe notion of multiplicity is important to be able to count correctly without\nspecifying exceptions (for example, double roots counted twice). Hence the\nexpression, \"counted with (sometimes implicit) multiplicity\".\n\nIf multiplicity is ignored, this may be emphasized by counting the number of\n'distinct' elements, as in \"the number of distinct roots\". However, whenever a\nset (as opposed to multiset) is formed, multiplicity is automatically ignored,\nwithout requiring use of the term \"distinct\".\n","title":"Multiplicity%20%28mathematics%29","headings":["Multiplicity of a prime factor","Multiplicity of a root of a polynomial","In complex analysis","See also","References"]},"micro-relation":["5: Root_of_a_function","2: Polynomial","1: Mathematics","1: Multiset","1: Polynomial_equation","1: Integer_factorization","1: Eigenvalue,_eigenvector_and_eigenspace#Definitions","1: Discriminant#Discriminant_of_a_polynomial","1: Cartesian_coordinate_system","1: Derivative","1: Holomorphic_function","1: Meromorphic_function","1: Taylor_series","1: Fundamental_theorem_of_algebra","1: Fundamental_theorem_of_arithmetic","1: Eigenvalue"]}
