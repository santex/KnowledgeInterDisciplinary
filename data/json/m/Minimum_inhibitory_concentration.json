Minimum inhibitory concentrations are\nimportant in diagnostic laboratories to confirm resistance of microorganisms to\nan antimicrobial agent and also to monitor the activity of new antimicrobial\nagents. Andrews, J. M. Determination of minimum inhibitory concentrations.\nJournal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy 48 (Suppl. 1):5-16, (2001). PMID\n11420333. A lower MIC is an indication of a better antimicrobial agent. A\nMIC is generally regarded as the most basic laboratory measurement of the\nactivity of an antimicrobial agent against an organism.
