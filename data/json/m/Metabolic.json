These enzyme-catalyzed reactions allow organisms to grow and\nreproduce, maintain their structures, and respond to their environments. The\nword metabolism can also refer to all chemical reactions that occur in living\norganisms, including digestion and the transport of substances into and between\ndifferent cells, in which case the set of reactions within the cells is called\n'intermediary metabolism' or 'intermediate metabolism'.\n\nMetabolism is usually divided into two categories. Catabolism breaks down\norganic matter, for example to harvest energy in cellular respiration. Anabolism\nuses energy to construct components of cells such as proteins and nucleic acids.\n\nThe chemical reactions of metabolism are organized into metabolic pathways, in\nwhich one chemical is transformed through a series of steps into another\nchemical, by a sequence of enzymes. Enzymes are crucial to metabolism because\nthey allow organisms to drive desirable reactions that require energy and will\nnot occur by themselves, by coupling them to spontaneous reactions that release\nenergy. As enzymes act as catalysts they allow these reactions to proceed\nquickly and efficiently. Enzymes also allow the regulation of metabolic pathways\nin response to changes in the cell's environment or signals from other cells.\n\nThe metabolism of an organism determines which substances it will find\nnutritious and which it will find poisonous. For example, some prokaryotes use\nhydrogen sulfide as a nutrient, yet this gas is poisonous to animals. The speed of metabolism, the metabolic rate,\ninfluences how much food an organism will require, and also affects how it is\nable to obtain that food.\n\nA striking feature of metabolism is the similarity of the basic metabolic\npathways and components between even vastly different species. For\nexample, the set of carboxylic acids that are best known as the intermediates in\nthe citric acid cycle are present in all known organisms, being found in species\nas diverse as the unicellular bacterium [[Escherichia coli]] and huge\nmulticellular organisms like elephants. These striking\nsimilarities in metabolic pathways are likely due to their early appearance in\nevolutionary history, and being retained because of their efficacy.\n","linknr":3638,"url":"Metabolic","recorded":1362479210,"links":146,"instances":["biochemistry","biochemistry","thermodynamics","genetics","biology","physics","biochemistry","biology","systems_theory","soil","biology","food","biology","zoology"],"pdf":["http://www.biomed.cas.cz/physiolres/pdf/53%20Suppl%201/53_S91.pdf","http://www.biomed.cas.cz/physiolres/pdf/53%20Suppl%201/53_S91.pdf","http://www.ias.ac.in/jbiosci/sep2003/637.pdf","http://www.ias.ac.in/jbiosci/sep2003/637.pdf","http://ep.physoc.org/cgi/reprint/82/2/291.pdf","http://ep.physoc.org/cgi/reprint/82/2/291.pdf","http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/cgi/reprint/49/12/1967.pdf","http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/cgi/reprint/49/12/1967.pdf","http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/img/assets/4202/MetabolicPathways_6_17_04_.pdf"],"categories":["Metabolism|*","Underwater
