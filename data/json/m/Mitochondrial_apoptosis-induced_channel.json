{"cursor":"4753","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'The Mitochondrial Apoptosis-Induced Channel' (or MAC), is an early marker of\nthe onset of apoptosis. This\nion channel is formed on the outer mitochondrial membrane in response to certain\napoptotic stimuli. MAC activity is detected by patch\nclamping mitochondria from apoptotic cells at the time of cytochrome c\nrelease.\n\nMembers of the Bcl-2 protein family regulate apoptosis by controlling the\nformation of MAC: the pro-apoptotic members Bax and/or Bak form MAC, whereas the anti-apoptotic members like Bcl-\n2 or Bcl-xL prevent MAC formation. Once formed, MAC mediates the release of\ncytochrome c to the cytosol, triggering the commitment step of the mitochondrial\napoptotic cascade. Depletion of MAC activity is accomplished pharmacologically\nby specific compounds, namely Bax Channel Inhibitors\nand MAC inhibitors. Either by knocking down MACâs main\ncomponents or by its pharmacological inhibition, the end result is prevention of\ncytochrome c release and apoptosis.\n","linknr":146,"url":"Mitochondrial_apoptosis-induced_channel","recorded":1362477066,"links":11,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Cell signaling","Death","Programmed cell death","Apoptosis"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/85/MacModel.jpg/300px-MacModel.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Apoptosis","Ion_channel","Outer_mitochondrial_membrane","Patch_clamp","Cytochrome_c","Bcl-2","Bcl-2-associated_X_protein","Bcl-2_homologous_antagonist_killer","Bcl-2","Bcl-xL"]}
