{"cursor":"12322","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" [[Caenorhabditis elegans]] is stained to highlight the nuclei of its cells.]]\n 'Multicellular organisms' are organisms that consist of more than one cell, in\n contrast to single-celled organisms. To form a multicellular organism, these\n cells need to identify and attach to the other cells. {{cite book\n  | last = Becker et al first = Wayne M. authorlink = title = The world of the\n  | cell publisher = Pearson Benjamin Cummings series = year = 2009 doi = isbn =\n  | 978-0-321-55418-5 page = 480}}\n\nOnly a dozen or so unicellular species have cells that can be seen individually\nwith the naked eye. The rest of the nearly two million visible species are\nmulticellular. In particular all species of animals, land plants and filamentous\nfungi are multicellular, as are many algae. Some organisms are partially uni-\nand multicellular, like [[Dictyostelium]].\n","linknr":366,"url":"Multicellular_organisms","recorded":1362570734,"links":57,"instances":["biology","biology","publisher","biology","journal"],"pdf":["http://courses.cit.cornell.edu/biog1101/outlines/Bonner%20-Origin%20of%20Multicellularity.pdf","http://courses.cit.cornell.edu/biog1101/outlines/Bonner%20-Origin%20of%20Multicellularity.pdf"],"categories":["Developmental biology","Evolutionary biology"],"headings":["Evolutionary history","Hypotheses for origin","Advantages","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/C_elegans_stained.jpg/220px-C_elegans_stained.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/ColonialFlagellateHypothesis.png/650px-ColonialFlagellateHypothesis.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cell","biology"],["grex","biology"],["nature","journal"],["mosby","publisher"],["competition","biology"]],"members":["competition","grex","mosby","cell","nature"],"related":["Organism","Cell_(biology)","Single-celled_organism","Cell_adhesion","Pearson_Benjamin_Cummings","Unicellular","Animal","Embryophyte","Fungi","Algae","Brown_algae","Fungi","Mycetozoa","Red_algae","Prokaryote","Eukaryote","Cyanobacteria","Germ_cell","Sperm","Ovum","Developmental_biology","Sexual_reproduction","Mesoproterozoic","Cancer","Grex_(biology)","Slime_mold","Syncytium","Drosophila","Choanoflagellate","Demosponge","Grypania","Palaeoproterozoic","Francevillian_Group_Fossil","Gabon","Nature_(journal)","Phylogenetic","Anatomical","Embryological","Animal","Plant","Divergent_evolution","Convergent_evolution","Alloenzymes","Satellite_DNA","Symbiosis","Basic_Books","Clown_fish","Heteractis_magnifica","Genome","Mitochondria","Chloroplasts","Endosymbiosis","Mitosis","Lichen","Cell_nucleus","Endomembrane","Mosby_(publisher)","Ciliates","Slime_molds","Hypothesis","Macronucleus","Micronucleus","Syncytium","Haeckel","Slime_mould","Cytokinesis","Cellular_differentiation","Dictyostelium","Volvocaceae","Eudorina","Volvox","Protist","Diffusion","Competition_(biology)","Cellular_differentiation","Organogenesis","Embryogenesis","Bacterial_colony"]}
