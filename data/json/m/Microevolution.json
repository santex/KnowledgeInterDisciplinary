[http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evol-\nibrary/article/_0_0/evoscales_02 Microevolution: What is microevolution?]\nThis change is due to four different processes: mutation, selection (natural and\nartificial), gene flow, and genetic drift.\n\nPopulation genetics is the branch of biology that provides the mathematical\nstructure for the study of the process of microevolution. Ecological genetics\nconcerns itself with observing microevolution in the wild. Typically, observable\ninstances of evolution are examples of microevolution; for example, bacterial\nstrains that have antibiotic resistance.\n\nMicroevolution over time may lead to speciation or the appearance of novel\nstructure, sometimes classified as macroevolution. Contrary\nto claims by creationists however, macro and microevolution describe\nfundamentally identical processes on different time scales.\n","linknr":786,"url":"Microevolution","recorded":1362483395,"links":46,"instances":["biology","biology","biology","engineering","biology","statistics"],"pdf":["http://www.aaas.org/spp/dser/images_Doser/Publications/evol_dialogue_study_guide.pdf"],"categories":["Population genetics"],"headings":["Contrast with Macroevolution","The four processes","Origin and Misuse of the term","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/CollapsedtreeLabels-simplified.svg/200px-CollapsedtreeLabels-simplified.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/Tree_of_life.svg/16px-Tree_of_life.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/Office-book.svg/16px-Office-book.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5d/Gene-duplication.svg/100px-Gene-duplication.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Mutation_and_selection_diagram.svg/300px-Mutation_and_selection_diagram.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a0/Random_genetic_drift_chart.png/250px-Random_genetic_drift_chart.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["homology","biology"],["redundancy","engineering"],["trait","biology"],["sampling","statistics"],["hybrid","biology"],["hybrid","biology"],["domain","biology"]],"members":["domain","trait","homology","redundancy","hybrid","sampling"],"related":["Mutation","Natural_selection","Artificial_selection","Gene_flow","Genetic_drift","Population_genetics","Ecological_genetics","Evolution","Bacteria","Antibiotic_resistance","Macroevolution","Creationism","Macroevolution","Reductionist","Holistic","DNA","Genome","Radioactive_decay","Virus","Transposon","Mutagen","Meiosis","DNA_replication","DNA_replication","Cellular_processes","Somatic_hypermutation","DNA_replication","Mutations","DNA_polymerase","Mutagenic","UV_radiation","DNA_repair","Chromosomal_crossover","Meiosis","Gene_duplication","Chromosomal_inversion","Gene_deletion","Chromosomal_translocation","DNA_polymerase","DNA_repair","Gene_product","DNA_repair","Metabolism","Immune_system","Gene_duplication","Genetic_recombination","Gene_family","Homology_(biology)","Protein_domain","Cone_cell","Rod_cell","Polyploidy","Redundancy_(engineering)","Heritable","Trait_(biology)","Organism","Reproduction","Population","Natural_selection","Artificial_selection","Genetic_variability","Ecosystem","Charles_Darwin","Sexual_selection","Phenotype","Genetics","Allele_frequency","Adaptation","Ecological_niche","Speciation","Biology","Artificial_selection","Heredity","Darwinism","Classical_genetics","Molecular_genetics","Adaptive_evolution","Allele","Sampling_(statistics)","Allele_frequency","Sinauer_Associates","Allele_frequency","Natural_selection","Ronald_Fisher","Motoo_Kimura","Neutral_theory_of_molecular_evolution","Sinauer_Associates","Genetic_hitchhiking","Gene_flow","Pollen","Hybrid_(biology)","Horizontal_gene_transfer","Gene_pool","Reproductive_isolation","Speciation","Great_Wall_of_China","Most_recent_common_ancestor","Horse","Donkey","Mule","Hybrid_(biology)","Infertility","Meiosis","Hybrid_speciation","Gray_tree_frog","Polyploidy","Inbreeding_depression","Horizontal_gene_transfer","Bacteria","Antibiotic_resistance","Bdelloidea","Virus","Domain_(biology)","Eukaryote","Chloroplast","Mitochondrion","Alleles","Gene_pool","Speciation","Botanist","Robert_Greenleaf_Leavitt","Developmental_biology","Yuri_Filipchenko","Theodosius_Dobzhansky","Genetics_and_the_Origin_of_Species","Young_Earth_creationism","Baraminology","Created_kind","Old_Earth_creationism","American_Association_for_the_Advancement_of_Science","American_Association_for_the_Advancement_of_Science","TalkOrigins_Archive","Douglas_Futuyma","Speciation","Creation_science","Genus","Taxonomy","Macroevolution"]}
