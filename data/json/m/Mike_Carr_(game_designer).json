{"cursor":"3834","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Mike Carr' (born September 4, 1951) is a writer and game designer known for\nwriting Fight in the Skies (1968, also known as Dawn Patrol). He also co-\nauthored Don't Give Up The Ship! (1971) with Dave Arneson and Gary Gygax. Carr\nbegan wargaming with the International Federation of Wargamers as a teenager.\nAt the invitation of Gygax, he joined TSR, Inc. in 1976, for whom he wrote an\nintroductory Dungeons and Dragons module called [[In Search of the Unknown]]\n(1979). Since it was included with the Dungeons and Dragons introductory box\nset the module enjoyed a sizeable print run. As the role playing game evolved\ninto a more complete and complex version known as Advanced Dungeons and\nDragons, Carr served as editor for three hardbound volumes, the Monster Manual,\nDungeon Masters Guide and Players Handbook and wrote the Foreword to each\nbook's early editions. In the early 1980s Carr authored three children's books\nwhich were published by TSR, including one in the Endless Quest series entitled\n\"Robbers & Robots\".\n\nCarr worked as an editor for TSR, with his editing credits for [[Dungeons &\nDragons]] including the original [[Monster Manual]] (1977), [[Vault of the\nDrow]] (1978), [[Players Handbook]] (1978), [[White Plume Mountain]] (1979),\n[[The Village of Hommlet]] (1979), [[World of Greyhawk Fantasy Game Setting|The\nWorld of Greyhawk]] (1980), [[The Keep on the Borderlands]] (1981), [[Descent\ninto the Depths of the Earth]] (1981), [[Against the Giants]] (1981), and [[Deep\nDwarven Delve]] (not printed until 1999). [http://www.pen-\npaper.net/rpgdb.php?op=showcreator&creatorid=504 Pen & Paper listing for Mike\nCarr]\n\nCarr was honored in 2007 as the only person who has attended all 40 Gen Con game\nconventions since the founding of that event in 1968. His Fight in the Skies\ngame is also the only one that has been played at all 40 of those conventions.\n\nIn addition to being part of the Dungeons and Dragons phenomenon from its\ninception through 1983 (when he left TSR), Carr was subsequently involved in\nanother remarkable story. After answering a job ad in the Wall Street Journal,\nhe was selected by legendary commodity futures trader Richard Dennis as one of\nthe trainees for a trading group that became known as the \"Turtles\". Carr was a\nsuccessful futures trader as part of that program for several years and after it\nwas disbanded ran his own investment management firm throughout the 1990s. From\n2000 to 2007, he worked as manager of marketing communications for Generac Power\nSystems, Inc., a manufacturer of standby generators.\n\nCarr is currently working as a marketing consultant and as a freelance writer,\nwhere his specialty is writing about snowmobiling. In addition to authoring\nsnowmobile travel articles for several magazines, he writes the \"Making\nTracks\" column that appears in the Wisconsin Snowmobile News magazine. He is\nalso involved in the production of the Aerodrome magazine, a newsletter for\ndevotees of the Dawn Patrol game. That publication was founded by Carr in 1969\nand has published more than 150 issues, which is a remarkable track record for\na gaming fanzine.\n","linknr":116,"url":"Mike_Carr_(game_designer)","recorded":1375069085,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Mike_Carr_(game_designer)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Mike_Carr_(game_designer)&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Biographies_of_living_persons","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability","/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources","/wiki/Defamation","/wiki/Fight_in_the_Skies","/wiki/Don%27t_Give_Up_The_Ship!","/wiki/Dave_Arneson","/wiki/Gary_Gygax","/wiki/Wargaming","/wiki/International_Federation_of_Wargamers","/wiki/TSR,_Inc.","/wiki/Dungeons_and_Dragons","/wiki/In_Search_of_the_Unknown","/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons_Basic_Set","/wiki/Monster_Manual","/wiki/Dungeon_Masters_Guide","/wiki/Players_Handbook","/wiki/Endless_Quest","/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons","/wiki/Monster_Manual","/wiki/Vault_of_the_Drow","/wiki/Players_Handbook","/wiki/White_Plume_Mountain","/wiki/The_Village_of_Hommlet","/wiki/World_of_Greyhawk_Fantasy_Game_Setting","/wiki/The_Keep_on_the_Borderlands","/wiki/Descent_into_the_Depths_of_the_Earth","/wiki/Against_the_Giants","/wiki/Deep_Dwarven_Delve","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Gen_Con","/wiki/Fight_in_the_Skies","/wiki/Dungeons_and_Dragons","/wiki/Richard_Dennis","/wiki/Generac_Power_Systems,_Inc.","/w/index.php?title=Mike_Carr_(game_designer)&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","http://www.pen-paper.net/rpgdb.php?op=showcreator&creatorid=504","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mike_Carr_(game_designer)&oldid=525872003","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1951_births","/wiki/Category:American_fantasy_writers","/wiki/Category:Board_game_designers","/wiki/Category:Dungeons_%26_Dragons_game_designers","/wiki/Category:Living_people","/wiki/Category:Role-playing_game_designers","/wiki/Category:BLP_articles_lacking_sources_from_January_2010","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Mike+Carr+%28game+designer%29&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Mike+Carr+%28game+designer%29","/wiki/Mike_Carr_(game_designer)","/wiki/Talk:Mike_Carr_(game_designer)","#","/wiki/Mike_Carr_(game_designer)","/w/index.php?title=Mike_Carr_(game_designer)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Mike_Carr_(game_designer)&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Mike_Carr_(game_designer)","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Mike_Carr_(game_designer)","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Mike_Carr_(game_designer)&oldid=525872003","/w/index.php?title=Mike_Carr_(game_designer)&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6846265","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Mike_Carr_%28game_designer%29&id=525872003","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Mike+Carr+%28game+designer%29","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Mike+Carr+%28game+designer%29&oldid=525872003&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Mike_Carr_(game_designer)&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6846265#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contac
