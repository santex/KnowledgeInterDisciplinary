The technologies through which this\ncommunication takes place varies. Broadcast media such as radio, recorded music,\nfilm and television transmit their information electronically. Print media use a\nphysical object such as a newspaper, book,pamphlet or comics, Riesman et al.\n(1950) ch.2 p.50 to distribute their information. Outdoor media is a form\nof mass media that comprises billboards, signs or placards placed inside and\noutside of commercial buildings, sports stadiums, shops and buses. Other outdoor\nmedia include flying billboards (signs in tow of airplanes), blimps, and\nskywriting. Public speaking and event organising can\nalso be considered as forms of mass media. The digital\nmedia comprises both Internet and mobile mass communication. Internet media\nprovides many mass media services, such as email, websites, blogs, and internet\nbased radio and television. Many other mass media outlets have a presence on the\nweb, by such things as having TV ads that link to a website, or distributing a\nQR Code in print or outdoor media to direct a mobile user to a website. In this\nway, they can utilise the easy accessibility that the Internet has, and the\noutreach that Internet affords, as information can easily be broadcast to many\ndifferent regions of the world simultaneously and cost-efficiently.\n\nThe organizations that control these technologies, such as television stations\nor publishing companies, are also known as the mass media.\n","recorded":1362124659,"portal":[],"list":[],"links":"1012","instances":["country_subdivision","sociologist","social_sciences","professor","philosophy_of_language","country","communication","media","law","magazine","mathematics","science","broadcasting","filmmaking","scholar","computing","critical_theory","protest","people","business","public_relations","politics","control"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Mass
