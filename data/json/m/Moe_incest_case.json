{"cursor":"4336","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The 'Moe incest case' emerged in February 2007 when a woman, identified as M for\nlegal reasons, reported to Victoria Police in the town of Moe, Victoria,\nAustralia that her 63-year-old father, R S J, had raped,\nphysically abused, and kept her a virtual prisoner in her own home between 1977\nand 2005. The case was likened to that of Josef Fritzl.\n\nPolice had known about the alleged abuse since 2005, when M first came forward,\nbut could not act because she did not want to cooperate after her father\nthreatened violence against her mother and siblings.\n\nThe J family had been known to authorities for more than 30 years at the time\nthe abuse came to light; three of R S J's six children with his wife have died,\nand others have spent time in state care. The allegations first emerged in a\nreport released by News Limited, which said authorities had been warned of the\nman's activities years ago but had failed to investigate.\n\nDuring the years of abuse, M gave birth to four of her father's children, each\nin major Melbourne hospitals; one child, a girl, died from severe brain and\nrespiratory developmental problems at eleven weeks of age, two of the surviving\nboys are seriously intellectually disabled, and the third boy has a major speech\nimpediment and social interaction problems. None of the children had fathers\nlisted on their birth certificates, raising concerns about why questions were\nnot asked at the time. The victim's mother was unaware of any abuse, despite\nsharing a house with her daughter, husband and grandchildren until 2005.\n\nM and her three surviving sons were taken into the care of the Victorian\nauthorities. R S J was charged with 83 sexual abuse offences by police in June\n2008 after DNA tests showed he was the father of M's children.\n","linknr":106,"url":"Moe_incest_case","recorded":1364132043,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Moe_incest_case&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Moe_incest_case&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/Moe,_Victoria","#cite_note-1","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Josef_Fritzl","/wiki/News_Limited","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Melbourne","/wiki/Fetus#Developmental_problems","/wiki/Birth_certificate","/wiki/Sexual_abuse","/wiki/DNA_test","/w/index.php?title=Moe_incest_case&action=edit&section=1","#cite_note-4","#cite_note-5","/w/index.php?title=Moe_incest_case&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Alvarez_case","/wiki/Kidnapping_of_Jaycee_Lee_Dugard","/wiki/Lydia_Gouardo","/wiki/Mongelli_case","/wiki/Natascha_Kampusch","/wiki/Sheffield_incest_case","/wiki/Fritzl_case","/w/index.php?title=Moe_incest_case&action=edit&section=3","#cite_ref-1","http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/australiaandthepacific/australia/6200239/Australian-Josef-Fritzl-fathered-four-by-daughter.html","#cite_ref-2","http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,24897,26086710-601,00.html","#cite_ref-3","http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/09/17/2689174.htm?section=justin","http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/09/17/2689174.htm?section=justin","#cite_ref-4","http://www.abc.net.au/news/2010-02-15/incest-father-jailed-for-22-years/331510","http://www.abc.net.au/news/2010-02-15/incest-father-jailed-for-22-years/331510","#cite_ref-5","http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VSCA/2012/148.html","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Moe_incest_case&oldid=501211366","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:2009_crimes","/wiki/Category:2009_in_Australia","/wiki/Category:Children_kept_in_captivity","/wiki/Category:Crime_in_Melbourne","/wiki/Category:Incest","/wiki/Category:Rape_in_Australia","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Moe+incest+case&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Moe+incest+case","/wiki/Moe_incest_case","/wiki/Talk:Moe_incest_case","#","/wiki/Moe_incest_case","/w/index.php?title=Moe_incest_case&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Moe_incest_case&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Moe_incest_case","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Moe_incest_case","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Moe_incest_case&oldid=501211366","/w/index.php?title=Moe_incest_case&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Moe_incest_case&id=501211366","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Moe+incest+case","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Moe+incest+case&oldid=501211366&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Moe_incest_case&printable=yes","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moe_incest_case","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=skins.vector&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","/w/index.php?title=MediaWiki:Gadget-ReferenceTooltips.js&action=raw&ctype=text/javascript&508635914","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["2009
