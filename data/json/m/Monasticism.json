{"cursor":"23578","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n monk praying in his cell.]] 'Monasticism' (from Greek Î¼Î¿Î½Î±ÏÏÏ, monachos,\n derived from Î¼ÏÎ½Î¿Ï, monos, \"alone\") or '[[wikt:monkhood|monkhood]]' is a\n religious way of life that involves renouncing worldly pursuits to fully devote\n one's self to spiritual work. Monastic life plays an important role in many\n Christian churches, especially in the Catholic and Orthodox tradition. Similar\n forms of religious life also exist in other faiths, most notably in Buddhism,\n but also Hinduism and Jainism, though the expressions differ considerably.\n\nMales pursuing a monastic life are generally called [[monk]]s while female\nmonastics are called [[nuns]]. The way of addressing monastics differs between\nthe Christian traditions. For a general rule, in Roman Catholicism, monks and\nnuns are called brother or sister, while in Orthodox Christianity, they are\ncalled father or mother. This is not an absolute rule as their address varies\ndepending on their rank and monastic tradition.\n","linknr":728,"url":"Monasticism","recorded":1362892752,"links":49,"instances":["religious","buddhism","theology","roman_province"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Monasticism|","Religious behaviour and experience"],"headings":["Buddhism","Christianity","Hinduism","Islam","Jainism","Judaism","Other religions or movements","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8f/Trappist_praying_2007-08-20_dti.jpg/220px-Trappist_praying_2007-08-20_dti.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8d/Young_monks_of_Drepung.jpg/300px-Young_monks_of_Drepung.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/de/St._Anthony%27s_Monastery_2006.jpg/220px-St._Anthony%27s_Monastery_2006.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Coptic_monks.jpg/220px-Coptic_monks.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/Wikiversity-logo.svg/16px-Wikiversity-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["world","theology"],["ten_precepts","buddhism"],["judaea","roman_province"],["order","religious"]],"members":["order","ten_precepts","world","judaea"],"related":["Monk","Greek_language","Religion","World_(theology)","Christianity","Catholic","Eastern_Orthodoxy","Buddhism","Hinduism","Jainism","Sangha","Buddhist","Bhikkhu","Bhikkhuni","Gautama_Buddha","Asceticism","Eremitic","Parinibbana","Cenobitic","Vassa","Patimokkha","Theravada","Bhikkhu","Bhikkhuni","Mahaprajapati","Pāli","Sanskrit","Ten_Precepts_(Buddhism)","Anthony_the_Great","Monk","Monastery","Rule_of_St_Benedict","Monk","Evangelical_counsels","Syria","Egypt","Hermit","Anthony_the_Great","Pope_Athanasius_I_of_Alexandria","Middle_East","Syriac_Christianity","Pachomius","Cenobium","Monastery","Monastery","Monastery_of_Saint_Anthony","Mar_Awgin","Mt._Izla","Nisibis","Mesopotamia","Sabbas_the_Sanctified","Bethlehem","Mar_Saba","Eastern_Orthodox_Church","Saint_Catherine's_Monastery,_Mount_Sinai","Justinian_I","Rule_of_St_Basil","Rule_of_the_Master","Rule_of_Saint_Benedict","Benedict_of_Nursia","Monte_Cassino","Benedictine","Order_of_St_Benedict","Augustinian_Rule","Canons_Regular","Franciscan","Carmelite","Dominican_Order","Servite_Order","Servants_of_Mary","Augustinian","Mendicant_order","Convent","Ecumenical","Bose_Monastic_Community","Monastic_Fraternities_of_Jerusalem","Taize_Community","New_Monasticism","Spirituality","Sannyasa","Simplicity","Celibacy","R.S._McGregor","Sadhu","Sadhu","Sadhu","Vaisnavism","Saivism","Jainism","Chaturmas","Judaism","Torah","Mitzvos","Baal_shem_tov","Destruction_of_the_Second_Temple","Nazirite","Beta_Israel","Talmud","Kollel","Yaffa_Eliach","Perushim","Essenes","Modern_Israeli_Hebrew","Ancient_Hebrew","Koine_Greek","Jewish","Sect","Zadokite","Pharisees","Sadducees","Asceticism","Voluntary_poverty","Marriage","Mysticism","Jewish_eschatology","Jewish_Messiah","Asceticism","Josephus","Judaea_(Roman_province)","Dead_Sea_Scrolls","Hebrew_Bible","Rachel_Elior","Israelis","Ananda_Marga","Celibacy","Acharya","Missionary","Bön","Manichaeism","Scientology","Sea_Organization","Sea_Org","Church_of_Scientology","Sikhism","Bahá’í_Faith","Taoism","Monk","Nun","Transcendental_Meditation_movement","Ashram","Uttarkashi","India","Global_Country_of_World_Peace","Zoroastrianism","Zoroaster","Free_will","Asceticism","Carmelite_Rule_of_St._Albert","Into_Great_Silence","Matha","Order_(religious)","George_Zarnecki"]}
