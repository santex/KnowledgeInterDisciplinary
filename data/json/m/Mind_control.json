{"cursor":"51302","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\n\n'Mind control' (also known as 'brainwashing', 'coercive persuasion', 'mind\nabuse', 'menticide', 'thought control', or 'thought reform') refers to a process\nin which a group or individual \"systematically uses unethically manipulative\nmethods to persuade others to conform to the wishes of the manipulator(s), often\nto the detriment of the person being manipulated\". The term has been\napplied to any tactic, psychological or otherwise, which can be seen as\nsubverting an individual's sense of control over their own thinking, behavior,\nemotions or decision making.\n\nTheories of brainwashing and of mind control were originally developed to\nexplain how totalitarian regimes appeared to succeed systematically in\nindoctrinating prisoners of war through propaganda and torture techniques. These\ntheories were later expanded and modified by psychologists including Margaret\nSinger, to explain a wider range of phenomena, especially conversions to new\nreligious movements (NRMs). A third-generation theory proposed by Ben Zablocki\nfocused on the utilization of mind control to retain members of NRMs and cults.\nThe suggestion that NRMs use mind control techniques has resulted in scientific\nand legal controversy.\n","linknr":786,"url":"Mind_control","recorded":1362477622,"links":62,"instances":["biologist","correctional","sociologist","sociologist","emotion","psychology","sociologist","military"],"pdf":["http://www.agpf.de/Bundestag-Enquete-english.pdf","http://www.hamburg.de/servlet/contentblob/109286/brainwashing-pdf/data.pdf","http://www.hamburg.de/servlet/contentblob/109286/brainwashing-pdf/data.pdf"],"categories":["Mind control|","Hypothetical technology","New religious movements","Paranormal terminology","Popular psychology","Pseudoscience","Psychological abuse","Public opinion","Psychological manipulation"],"headings":["Korean War and the origin of brainwashing","Army report debunks brainwashing of American prisoners of war","Cults and the shift of focus","Other areas","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/Unbalanced_scales.svg/45px-Unbalanced_scales.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Ambox_globe_content.svg/48px-Ambox_globe_content.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Wikiquote-logo-en.svg/40px-Wikiquote-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["psyche","psychology"],["guilt","emotion"],["gi","military"],["kathleen_taylor","biologist"],["james_richardson","sociologist"],["thomas_robbins","sociologist"],["john_hall","sociologist"],["boot_camp","correctional"]],"members":["kathleen_taylor","boot_camp","thomas_robbins","james_richardson","guilt","psyche","john_hall","gi"],"related":["Psychological_manipulation","Psychological","Thinking","Totalitarian","Prisoners_of_war","Propaganda","Torture","Margaret_Singer","New_religious_movements","Ben_Zablocki","Scientific","Legal","Korean_War","Human_brain","Mindset","Psyche_(psychology)","Sleep_deprivation","Sensory_deprivation","Guilt_(emotion)","Peer_pressure","Pun","Taoist","Cardiovascular_disease","Psychologist","Central_business_district","United_States","GI_(military)","Community_organizing","Robert_W._Ford","James_Carne","Frank_Schwable","Repatriation","Robert_Jay_Lifton","Edgar_Schein","Social_deprivation","Anti-Americanism","Communist","Mikhail_Heller","Soviet_Union","Edgar_Schein","Papal_Inquisition","Russian_secret_police","Prison","Mental_hospital","Religious_sect","Fraternal_order","Political_elite","Primitive_society","Dick_Anthony","CIA","Fear","Duress","United_States_Department_of_Defense","Project_MKULTRA","Frank_Schwable","1st_Marine_Aircraft_Wing","Mark_W._Clark","Charles_Erwin_Wilson","Politics","Religion","Anti-cult_movement","Religious_conversion","Social_scientists","Psychologists","Religious_conversion","Cult","Philip_Zimbardo","Aum_Shinrikyo","Margaret_Singer","Neuroscience","Social_psychology","Kathleen_Taylor_(biologist)","Prefrontal_cortex","Robert_Cialdini","Destructive_cult","Deprogramming","Deprogramming","Exit_counseling","Steven_Hassan","Behavior_modification","Phobia","Psychotherapy","Eileen_Barker","Mental_health","Margaret_Singer","James_Richardson_(sociologist)","David_G._Bromley","Anson_Shupe","Thomas_Robbins_(sociologist)","Dick_Anthony","Eileen_Barker","Newton_Maloney","Massimo_Introvigne","John_Hall_(sociologist)","Lorne_Dawson","Anson_Shupe","Gordon_Melton","Marc_Galanter","Saul_Levine","Benjamin_Zablocki","Stephen_A._Kent","Lawrence_Wollersheim","Church_of_Scientology","Patty_Hearst","Steven_Fishman","Lee_Boyd_Malvo","American_Psychological_Association","Taskforce","APA_Task_Force_on_Deceptive_and_Indirect_Techniques_of_Persuasion_and_Control","Empirical","Benjamin_Beit-Hallahmi","Benjamin_Zablocki","Richard_Ofshe","Steven_Fishman","American_Sociology_Association","Science","Frye_Standard","James_T._Richardson","Child_sexual_abuse","Parental_alienation","Stephen_A._Kent","Meme","Boot_camp_(correctional)","Terrorist_group","Corporate_culture","Violence","Falun_Gong","APA_Task_Force_on_Deceptive_and_Indirect_Techniques_of_Persuasion_and_Control","Control_freak","Crowd_manipulation","Destabilisation","Gaslighting","Indoctrination","Jason_Scott_case","Love_bombing","Mind_control_in_popular_culture","Mind_games","MKULTRA","CIA","Propaganda","Propaganda_model","Social_control","Subliminal_message","Unethical_human_experimentation_in_the_United_States","Jacques_Ellul","Peter_Swirski"]}
