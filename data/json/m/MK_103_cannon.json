{"cursor":"4394","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The Rheinmetall-Borsig 'MK 103' (\"MK\" - [[autocannon|Maschinenkanone]]) was a\nGerman 30 mm caliber autocannon that was mounted in German combat aircraft\nduring World War II. Intended to be a dual purpose weapon for anti-tank and air-to-\nair fighting, it was a development of the heavy MK 101. Compared to the MK 101,\nit was lighter, faster-firing, and was originally intended to develop a higher\nmuzzle velocity than the MK 101. Unlike the MK 101, the MK 103 used a belt feed,\nallowing it to potentially carry a larger ammunition load. The MK 103 used\nelectrically primed rather than percussion primed ammunition. The firing\nmechanism differed from the recoil operated MK 101 in that it used a combination\nof gas and recoil operation. After firing, gas pressure serves to unlock the\nbreech, while barrel recoil was used to cycle the action (eject spent cartridge\nand load a fresh one).\n\nHowever, through a combination of lower grade steels and lighter components, the\nmechanism was not as strong as the MK 101. To counteract this weakness HE\nammunition used a reduced load of propellant, resulting in a lowered muzzle\nvelocity (-100 m/s) compared to the MK 101. The rate of fire was improved\nas a result, though still inferior to that of the MK 108 with its much lower\nmuzzle energy. The Armour-piercing 30 mm cartridge retained a full\npropellant charge, as the resulting higher muzzle velocities were felt to be\nworth the risk. The MK 103 entered service in 1943 as main armament of the Hs\n129 B-1 ground-attack/tank-destroyer aircraft, mounted below the central\nfuselage in a conformal gun pod.\n\nThe original specification for the weapon called for it to fit inside the engine\nmounting (possibly as a Motorkanone, firing through a hollow propeller hub) of\naircraft, however the final weapon was too large and heavy to fit into small-\nsize fighters like the Bf 109. Unless mounted on the aircraft's centerline, the\nasymmetric shock from the cannon's recoil tended to veer the aircraft off\ncourse. The only known usage of the original MK 103 in a Motorkanone fitment was\nin the Do 335. A modified version with a reduced-profile barrel - the MK 103M -\nwas developed and possibly tested for possible use as a Motorkanone cannon on\nsingle-engine fighter planes such as the Bf-109K, but probably never saw active\nservice. As a consequence, the MK 103 was largely restricted to the role of an\nair-to-ground weapon for use against armoured vehicles.\n\nA limited-production series of the Fw 190A fighter and Fw 190F ground attack\nfighter (which utilized a particularly strong wing/fuselage design) incorporated\ntwo MK 103 cannons, one apiece mounted in a conformal gondola-style gun pod\nunder each wing. Later in the war the MK 103 was also used as a ground-based anti-\naircraft (AA) weapon, using single or dual mounts. It was also used in the\nFlakpanzer IV \"Kugelblitz\".\n\nDeveloped alongside the MK 103 was a lighter short-ranged MK 108 cannon which\nfired the same projectiles using a smaller cartridge case with less propellant.\n","linknr":100,"url":"MK_103_cannon","recorded":1374767203,"links":["/w/index.php?title=MK_103_cannon&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=MK_103_cannon&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Rheinmetall","/wiki/Autocannon","/wiki/Germany","/wiki/30_mm_caliber","/wiki/Autocannon","/wiki/World_War_II","/wiki/MK_101_cannon","/wiki/Recoil_operation","/wiki/MK_108","/wiki/Henschel_Hs_129","/wiki/Gun_pod","/wiki/Messerschmitt_Bf_109","/wiki/Dornier_Do_335","/wiki/Focke-Wulf_Fw_190","/wiki/Kugelblitz","/wiki/MK_108_cannon","/w/index.php?title=MK_103_cannon&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Automatic_cannon","/wiki/Minengeschoss","/wiki/Minengeschoss","/wiki/APCR","/wiki/APCR","/w/index.php?title=MK_103_cannon&action=edit&section=2","http://www.cockpitinstrumente.de/archiv/Dokumente/ABC/m/MK%20103/MK%20103%20Maschinenkanone.htm","/wiki/Gun_pod","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=MK_103_cannon&oldid=540951566","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:30_mm_artillery","/wiki/Category:Automatic_cannons","/wiki/Category:Aircraft_guns","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=MK+103+cannon&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=MK+103+cannon","/wiki/MK_103_cannon","/wiki/Talk:MK_103_cannon","#","/wiki/MK_103_cannon","/w/index.php?title=MK_103_cannon&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=MK_103_cannon&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/MK_103_cannon","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/MK_103_cannon","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=MK_103_cannon&oldid=540951566","/w/index.php?title=MK_103_cannon&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q552029","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=MK_103_cannon&id=540951566","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=MK+103+cannon","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=MK+103+cannon&oldid=540951566&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=MK_103_cannon&printable=yes","//bg.wikipedia.org/wiki/MK-103","//de.wikipedia.org/wiki/MK_103","//es.wikipedia.org/wiki/MK_103","//ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/MK_103_%E6%A9%9F%E9%96%A2%E7%A0%B2","//sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/MK_103","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q552029#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/MK_103_cannon","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["30
