She\nearned her bachelor degree at Barnard College in New York City, and her M.A. and\nPh.D. degrees from Columbia University.\n\nShe was both a popularizer of the insights of anthropology into modern American\nand Western culture and a respected, if controversial, academic anthropologist.\nHer reports about the attitudes towards sex in South Pacific and Southeast Asian\ntraditional cultures amply informed the 1960s sexual revolution. Mead was a\nchampion of broadened sexual mores within a context of traditional western\nreligious life.\n\nAn Anglican Christian, she played a considerable part in the drafting of the\n1979 American Episcopal Book of Common Prayer.
