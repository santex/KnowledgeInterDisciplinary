{"cursor":"6953","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nA 'mortgage investment corporation' or 'MIC' is an investment and lending\ncompany designed specifically for mortgage lending (primarily residential\nmortgage lending) in Canada. Owning shares in a mortgage investment corporation\nenables you to invest in a company which manages a diversified and secured pool\nof mortgages. Shares of a MIC are qualified investments under the Income Tax Act\n(Canada) for RDSPs, RRSPs, RRIFs, TFSAs, or RESPs. Mortgage investment\ncorporations are generally provincially registered and licensed, with the\nmanagement of the mortgage fund under the direction of provincially licensed\nmortgage brokers and real estate agents.\n\nA MIC mortgage portfolio can include everything from small second mortgages on\nresidential property to commercial and development mortgages on new projects.\nEvery investment is typically based on a thorough investigation of the\nproperty. A typical MIC loan (ideally) should never exceed a specified\npercentage (typically from 60% to 85%) of the current value of the property.\nCompare this to a conventional bank's willingness to routinely loan 80% of the\nvalue of the property and sometimes even 100%. MIC's investment strategies vary\nconsiderably, as do their rates of return on invested capital. Many MIC's have\ndemonstrated an ability to generate consistent returns between 6% and 12% for\ninvestors, however, returns vary based not only on the investment strategy of\nthe specific MIC but also on the nature of the investment share itself. Some\nMIC shares are designed to be held for a period as short as a year, and other\nMIC shares require the investor to hold them for a longer period, up to 10\nyears in some cases. Yields typically increase when the hold periods are\nlonger, and are lower for shares that are immediately liquid after a short hold\nperiod such as one year.\n\nMIC's are organized for investing in pools of mortgages. Profits generated by\nMICs are distributed to its shareholders according to their proportional\ninterest. The mortgages are secured on real property, often in conjunction with\nother forms of security, such as personal and corporate guarantees, general\nsecurity agreements and assignments of material contracts, such as insurance\npolicies, prepared by lawyers for the MIC.\n","linknr":94,"url":"Mortgage_Investment_Corporation","recorded":1374778757,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Mortgage_investment_corporation&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Mortgage_investment_corporation&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","/wiki/Mortgage_investment_corporation","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","/w/index.php?title=Mortgage_Investment_Corporation&redirect=no","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e1/Ambox_wikify.svg/40px-Ambox_wikify.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Linking","/wiki/Wikipedia:BUILD","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mortgage_investment_corporation&action=edit","/wiki/Wikipedia:Only_make_links_that_are_relevant_to_the_context","/wiki/Investment","/wiki/Mortgage_loan","/wiki/Canada","/wiki/Shares","/wiki/Registered_Disability_Savings_Plan","/wiki/RRSP","/wiki/Registered_Retirement_Income_Fund","/wiki/TFSA","/wiki/Registered_Education_Savings_Plan","/wiki/Second_mortgage","/w/index.php?title=Mortgage_investment_corporation&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Mortgage_investment_corporation&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=Mortgage_investment_corporation&action=edit&section=3","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mortgage_investment_corporation&oldid=528501226","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Investment_companies_of_Canada","/wiki/Category:Mortgage-backed_security","/wiki/Category:Mortgage_lenders","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_too_few_wikilinks_from_October_2012","/wiki/Category:All_articles_with_too_few_wikilinks","/wiki/Category:Articles_covered_by_WikiProject_Wikify_from_October_2012","/wiki/Category:All_articles_covered_by_WikiProject_Wikify","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Mortgage+investment+corporation&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Mortgage+investment+corporation","/wiki/Mortgage_investment_corporation","/wiki/Talk:Mortgage_investment_corporation","#","/wiki/Mortgage_investment_corporation","/w/index.php?title=Mortgage_investment_corporation&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Mortgage_investment_corporation&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Mortgage_investment_corporation","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Mortgage_investment_corporation","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Mortgage_investment_corporation&oldid=528501226","/w/index.php?title=Mortgage_investment_corporation&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6914661","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Mortgage_investment_corporation&id=528501226","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Mortgage+investment+corporation","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Mortgage+investment+corporation&oldid=528501226&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Mortgage_investment_corporation&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6914661#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_investment_corporation","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/l
