Milling is among the oldest of human occupations.\n\"Miller\", \"Milne\" and other variants are common surnames,<ref></ref> as are\ntheir equivalents in other languages around the world (\"Müller\" or \"Mueller\" in\nGerman, \"Molnár\" in Hungarian, \"Molinero\" in Spanish, \"Molinari\" in Italian\netc.). Milling existed in hunter-gatherer communities, and later millers were\nimportant to the development of agriculture.\n\nThe materials ground by millers are often foodstuffs and particularly grain. The\nphysical grinding of the food allows for the easier digestion of its nutrients\nand saves wear on the teeth. Non-food substances needed in a fine, powdered\nform, such as building materials, may be processed by a miller.\n\n, Scotland.]] The most basic tool for a miller was the quern-stone - simply a\nlarge, fixed stone as a base and another movable stone operated by hand, similar\nto a mortar and pestle. As technology and millstones (the bedstone and rynd)\nimproved, more elaborate machines such as watermills and windmills were\ndeveloped to do the grinding work. These mills harnessed available energy\nsources including animal, water, wind, and electrical power. Mills are some of\nthe oldest factories in human history, so factories making other items are\nsometimes known as mills, for example, cotton mills and steel mills. These\nfactory workers are also called millers.\n\nThe rynd in pre-reformation Scotland was often carved on millers' gravestones as\na symbol of their trade.\n\nIn a traditional rural society, a miller is often wealthier than ordinary\npeasants, which can lead to jealousy and to millers being targeted in bread\nriots at times of famine. Conversely, millers might be in a stronger position\nvis-a-vis feudal land owners than are ordinary peasants.\n\n miller at a festival in Monselice.]] The traditional carnival held annually in\n the city of Ivrea, Italy commemorates a spirited \"Mugnaia\" (miller's daughter)\n who supposedly refused to let a local duke exercise his right of the first\n night, and proceeded to chop the duke's head off and spark a revolution.\n Whatever the historical validity of the story, it is significant it was the\n daughter of a miller to whom folk tradition assigned this rebellious role.\n","title":"miller","headings":["See also","References"]},"micro-relation":["2: Gristmill","1: De_Hoed,_Waarde","1: Cereal_crop","1: Flour","1: German_surname","1: German_language","1: Molnár","1: Hungarian_language","1: Molinero","1: Spanish_language","1: Molinari","1: Italian_language","1: Hunter-gatherer","1: History_of_agriculture","1: Foodstuff","1: Cereal","1: Nutrient","1: Building_materials","1: Quern-stone","1: Mortar_and_pestle","1: Millstones","1: Bedstone","1: Millrind","1: Watermill","1: Windmill","1: Cotton_mill","1: Steel_mill","1: History_of_Scotland","1: Rural","1: Bread_riots","1: Famine","1: Feudal","1: Monselice","1: Ivrea#Culture","1: Italy","1: Right_of_the_first_night","1: Bread","1: Horsebread","1: List_of_early_medieval_watermills","1: Wheatberry"]}
