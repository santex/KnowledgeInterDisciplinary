{"cursor":"4268","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Marc Blank' is an American game developer and software engineer. He is best\nknown as part of the team that created one of the first hit text adventure\ncomputer games, [[Zork]].\n\nIn high school he collaborated with Alex Citron on a simulation of a major\nleague baseball season called CWABL, standing alternatively for Computerized\nWinner Automatic Baseball League or Citroblamatic Whizamadingy Automatic\nBaseball League, which came to employ a pseudorandom number generator classmate\nRobert Goodman programmed on an electronic calculator for CWABL, which despite\nits name was otherwise run by manual table look-up.\n\nBlank first encountered Don Woods and Will Crowther's [[Colossal Cave\nAdventure|Adventure]] game while he was studying at MIT in the mid-1970s, where\nthe game was played on mainframe computers.\n\nBlank was frustrated by the computer's tiny vocabulary; when it parsed user\ninputs very few words were recognized. After thinking about the problem during\nhis undergraduate years, he started work on his own adventure game using MDL, a\ncomputer language invented at MIT. Blank and a handful of friends wrote the\noriginal version of Zork on a PDP-10 while he was attending medical school at\nAlbert Einstein College of Medicine in New York.\n\nThe free-play university version of Zork first became available on the MIT-DM\nPDP-10 in June 1977. It was then distributed by the Digital Equipment\nCorporation DECUS program and spread to many colleges in the United States\nand Canada.\n\nBlank graduated from medical school in 1979 but the call of Zork was\nirresistible. He and several friends spent the next year developing a\nspecialized computer language that they could use to program text adventures\nlike Zork on the new microcomputers.\n\nThe Apple II's limited RAM required them to cut half of the original version\nof Zork. The new Zork for the Apple and the Radio Shack TRS-80, had a 600-\nword vocabulary. They founded the new company Infocom to publish the game and\nmore like it.\n\nIn 1993 he teamed up with former Infocom writer Michael Berlyn to found Blank,\nBerlyn and Co.. The company's name was later changed to Eidetic. They initially\npublished productivity software for the Apple Newton. Eidetic's Notion: The\nNewton List Manager became a hit and was ultimately bundled in all Newtons.\n\nMarc returned to text adventures in 1997 when Activision producer Eddie\nDombrower asked Blank and Berlyn to create a small promotional game, [[Zork: The\nUndiscovered Underground]] as promotion for the release of Activision's\ngraphical game [[Zork: Grand Inquisitor]].\n\nAs Newton sales faded, Eidetic changed gears to focus on PC and PlayStation\ngames, producing the hit [[Syphon Filter]] in 1999. In 2000 Sony acquired\nEidetic for an undisclosed sum.\n\nBlank left Sony in 2004, where he focused on his email client for the Treo\nsmartphone, ChatterEmail. On February 22, 2007, Blank announced he would no\nlonger be \"actively\" working on ChatterEmail. Marc subsequently joined Palm,\nInc. (who acquired ChatterEmail) and led the design and implementation of the\nPalm Pre's Email application. He worked in the Android group at Google from 2009\nto 2012, and is now a Principal Engineer at Lab126 (Amazon.com).\n","linknr":151,"url":"Marc_Blank","recorded":1374967375,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Marc_Blank&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Marc_Blank&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/Video_game_developer","/wiki/Software_engineer","/wiki/Text_adventure","/wiki/Computer_games","/wiki/Zork","/wiki/Major_league_baseball","/wiki/Don_Woods_(programmer)","/wiki/Will_Crowther","/wiki/Colossal_Cave_Adventure","/wiki/MIT","/wiki/Mainframe_computer","/wiki/MDL_(programming_language)","/wiki/PDP-10","/wiki/Albert_Einstein_College_of_Medicine","/wiki/New_York","/wiki/Digital_Equipment_Corporation","/wiki/DECUS","/wiki/Computer_language","/wiki/Microcomputers","/wiki/Apple_II","/wiki/RAM","/wiki/Radio_Shack","/wiki/TRS-80","/wiki/Infocom","/wiki/Michael_Berlyn","/wiki/Eidetic","/wiki/Apple_Newton","/wiki/Eddie_Dombrower","/wiki/Zork:_The_Undiscovered_Underground","/wiki/Zork:_Grand_Inquisitor","/wiki/IBM_PC_clone","/wiki/PlayStation","/wiki/Syphon_Filter","/wiki/Sony","/wiki/Palm_Treo","/w/index.php?title=Marc_Blank&action=edit&section=1","http://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,199/","/wiki/MobyGames","http://archive.org/details/getlamp_blank","/wiki/Get_Lamp","/wiki/Template:Zork_universe","/wiki/Template_talk:Zork_universe","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Zork_universe&action=edit","/wiki/Zork","/wiki/Zork_I","/wiki/Zork_II","/wiki/Zork_III","/wiki/Enchanter_(video_game)","/wiki/Sorcerer_(video_game)","/wiki/Spellbreaker","/wiki/Beyond_Zork","/wiki/Zork_Zero","/wiki/Wishbringer","/wiki/Return_to_Zork","/wiki/Zork_Nemesis","/wiki/Zork:_Grand_Inquisitor","/wiki/Zork:_The_Undiscovered_Underground","/wiki/Legends_of_Zork","/wiki/Implementer_(video_games)","/wiki/Tim_Anderson_(Zork)","/wiki/Bruce_Daniels","/wiki/Dave_Lebling","/wiki/Infocom","/wiki/Activision","/wiki/Zombie_Studios","/wiki/Jolt_Online_Gaming","/wiki/Z-machine","/wiki/Zork_books","/wiki/69105_(number)","/wiki/Grue_(monster)","/wiki/Hello,_sailor","/wiki/Classic_Text_Adventure_Masterpieces_of_Infocom","/wiki/The_Lost_Treasures_of_Infocom","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Marc_Blank&oldid=551086153","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1954_births","/wiki/Category:American_video_game_designers","/wiki/Category:Google_employees","/wiki/Category:Interactive_fiction_writers","/wiki/Category:Living_people","/wiki/Category:Video_game_programmers","/wiki/Category:Infocom","/wiki/Category:Zork","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Marc+Blank&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Marc+Blank","/wiki/Marc_Blank","/wiki/Talk:Marc_Blank","#","/wiki/Marc_Blank","/w/index.php?title=Marc_Blank&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Marc_Blank&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Marc_Blank","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Marc_Blank","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Marc_Blank&oldid=551086153","/w/index.php?title=Marc_Blank&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6755399","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Marc_Blank&id=551086153","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Marc+Blank","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Marc+Blank&oldid=551086153&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Marc_Blank&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6755399#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License"
