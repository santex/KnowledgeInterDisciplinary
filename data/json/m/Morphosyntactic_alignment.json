{"cursor":"18950","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nIn linguistics, 'morphosyntactic alignment' is the grammatical relationship\nbetween argumentsâspecifically, between the two arguments (in English, subject\nand object) of transitive verbs like the dog chased the cat, and the single\nargument of intransitive verbs like the cat ran away. English has a [[subject\n(grammar)|subject]], which merges the more active argument of transitive verbs\nwith the argument of intransitive verbs, leaving the [[object\n(grammar)|object]] distinct; other languages may have different strategies, or,\nrarely, make no distinction at all. Distinctions may be made morphologically\n(through grammatical case or verbal agreement), syntactically (through word\norder), or both.\n\nFor example, in English, in the dog chased the cat (transitive verb, two\narguments), and in the bird flew (intransitive verb, one argument), 'dog'\nand 'bird' are both subjects, which is shown by their appearance before the\nverb, while 'cat' is different, an object, coming after the verb. Not all\nlanguages treat 'dog' and 'bird' as equivalent the way English does: in some\n'cat' and 'bird' will be equivalent, while 'dog' is different, and there are\nyet other systems.\n","linknr":206,"url":"Morphosyntactic_alignment","recorded":1362687753,"links":22,"instances":["grammar","grammar","grammar","grammar","linguistics","linguistics","linguistics","linguistics"],"pdf":[],"categories":[],"headings":["Semantics and grammatical relations","Ergative vs. accusative","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/23/MorphSyntAlign.svg/660px-MorphSyntAlign.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["morphology","linguistics"],["agreement","linguistics"],["subject","grammar"],["object","grammar"],["agent","grammar"],["patient","grammar"],["focus","linguistics"],["raising","linguistics"],["agent","grammar"]],"members":["object","patient","subject","agent","focus","agreement","raising","morphology"],"related":["Linguistics","Verb_argument","Verb_argument","Transitive_verb","Intransitive_verb","Morphology_(linguistics)","Grammatical_case","Agreement_(linguistics)","Syntax","Word_order","Subject_(grammar)","Object_(grammar)","Intransitive_verb","Agent_(grammar)","Patient_(grammar)","Grammatical_function","Thematic_relation","Nominative_case","Accusative_case","Ergative_case","Nominative–accusative_language","Nominative_case","Accusative_case","Oblique_case","Dative_case","Instrumental_case","Passive_voice","Cushitic_languages","Yuman_languages","Ergative–absolutive_language","Ergative_case","Oblique_case","Genitive_case","Instrumental_case","Absolutive_case","Antipassive_voice","Active–stative_language","Austronesian_languages","Grammatical_voice","Focus_(linguistics)","Locative_case","Benefactive_case","Accusative_case","Intransitive_case","Ergative_case","Nez_Perce_language","Iranian_language","Rushani_language","Split_ergativity","Animacy","Australian_Aboriginal_languages","Grammatical_aspect","Mayan_languages","Diyari_language","Argument_control","Raising_(linguistics)","Relative_clause","Syntactic_ergativity","Experiencer","Agent_(grammar)","Basque_language","Japanese_language","Milewski's_typology","Differential_object_marking","Jiwarli_language"]}
