Deciding what if anything is morally obligatory is a principle\nconcern of ethics.\n\nPeople who have moral responsibility for an action are called moral agents.\nAgents are capable of reflecting on their situation, forming intentions about\nhow they will act, and then carrying out that action. Free will is an important\nissue in the debate on whether individuals are ever morally responsible for\ntheir actionsâand, if so, in what sense. Incompatibilists think that determinism\nis at odds with free will, whereas compatibilists think the two can coexist.\n\nMoral responsibility is not necessarily the same as legal responsibility. A\nperson is legally responsible for an event when it is that person who is liable\nto be penalised in the court system for an event. Although it may often be the\ncase that when a person is morally responsible for an act, they are also legally\nresponsible for it, the two states do not always coincide.\n","linknr":409,"url":"Moral_responsibility","recorded":1362559665,"links":39,"instances":["psychology","philosophy","philosophy_of_mind"],"pdf":["http://faculty.baruch.cuny.edu/hsarkissian/Is%20Belief%20in%20Free%20Will%20a%20Universal_final.pdf","https://edocs.uis.edu/kmill2/www/TheRules/moralResponsibilityForComputerArtifactsV27.pdf","http://assembly.coe.int/Documents/WorkingDocs/Doc11/EDOC12777.pdf"],"categories":["Social philosophy","Sociological terminology","Concepts in ethics","Philosophy of life"],"headings":["Philosophical stances","Experimental research","Collective moral responsibility","Lack of sense of responsibility of psychopaths","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5a/Torch.svg/50px-Torch.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/94/DeterminismXFreeWill.svg/220px-DeterminismXFreeWill.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Prision_del_Condado_de_Mantras.JPG/140px-Prision_del_Condado_de_Mantras.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/99/Handcuffs-20060604.jpg/220px-Handcuffs-20060604.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["desert","philosophy"],["reward","psychology"],["dualism","philosophy_of_mind"]],"members":["reward","desert","dualism"],"related":["Morality","Desert_(philosophy)","Praise","Blame","Reward_(psychology)","Punishment","Obligation","Ethics","Moral_agents","Intention","Incompatibilist","Compatibilist","Legal_responsibility","Free_will","Metaphysical_libertarian","Jean-Paul_Sartre","Insanity_defense","Diminished_responsibility","Fallacy_of_the_single_cause","Thomas_Nagel","David_Hume","Oxford_University_Press","Hard_determinist","Fatalist","Liberty","Clarence_Darrow","Leopold_and_Loeb","Paul_of_Tarsus","Epistle_to_the_Romans","Neuroethics","Dualism_(philosophy_of_mind)","Cognitive_neuroscience","Neuroscience_of_free_will","Psychosis","Frontal_lobe","Justice","Ethical_realism","Consequentialism","David_Eagleman","Pedophile","Daniel_Dennett","Iroquois","Experimental_philosophy","South_Africa","Apartheid","Psychopathy","Accountability","House_of_Responsibility","Moral_hazard","Declaration_of_Human_Duties_and_Responsibilities","Ted_Honderich","The_Philosophical_Review","Pearson_Longman","Ted_Honderich","Andrew_Eshleman","Stanford_Encyclopedia_of_Philosophy","PACE"]}
