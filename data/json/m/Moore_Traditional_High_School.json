The large main gymnasium was\ncontained in the center of the building, off the lobby, and bordered by two\nparallel rows of classrooms. The art classrooms, located on the second floor of\nthe western end of the building, had balconies that overlooked a courtyard below\nthat separated the main building from the small industrial arts building\nimmediately to its west.\n\nMoore High School added a grade in each of the three succeeding years so that by\nthe 1971-1972 school year, the school contained grades 7-12 for the first time.\nMoore High School immediately made a name for itself in music, as the band won a\nstate championship in those early years and the choral music department put on\nthe musicals \"Brigadoon\" (1971), \"Oklahoma\" (1972) and \"Pajama Game\" (1973).\n","linknr":93,"url":"Moore_Traditional_High_School","recorded":1363440703,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Moore_Traditional_High_School&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Moore_Traditional_High_School&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/Louisville,_Kentucky","/wiki/Kentucky","/wiki/Public_school_(government_funded)","/wiki/High_school#United_States","/wiki/Jefferson_County_Public_Schools_(Kentucky)","/wiki/Sixth_grade","/wiki/Twelfth_grade","/wiki/Suburb","http://www.jefferson.k12.ky.us/schools/high/moore.html","/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Moore_Traditional_High_School&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system","http://toolserver.org/~geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Moore_Traditional_High_School&params=38.13950_N_-85.63750_E_scale:10000","/wiki/Middle_school","/wiki/High_school","/wiki/Louisville,_Kentucky","/wiki/Brigadoon_(musical)","/w/index.php?title=Moore_Traditional_High_School&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Moore_Traditional_High_School&action=edit&section=2","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Moore_Traditional_High_School&oldid=496838423","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Jefferson_County_Public_Schools_(Kentucky)","/wiki/Category:Public_high_schools_in_Kentucky","/wiki/Category:Schools_in_Louisville,_Kentucky","/wiki/Category:Articles_lacking_sources_from_December_2009","/wiki/Category:All_articles_lacking_sources","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Moore+Traditional+High+School&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Moore+Traditional+High+School","/wiki/Moore_Traditional_High_School","/wiki/Talk:Moore_Traditional_High_School","#","/wiki/Moore_Traditional_High_School","/w/index.php?title=Moore_Traditional_High_School&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Moore_Traditional_High_School&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Moore_Traditional_High_School","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Moore_Traditional_High_School","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Moore_Traditional_High_School&oldid=496838423","/w/index.php?title=Moore_Traditional_High_School&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Moore_Traditional_High_School&id=496838423","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Moore+Traditional+High+School","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Moore+Traditional+High+School&oldid=496838423&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Moore_Traditional_High_School&printable=yes","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore_Traditional_High_School","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=skins.vector&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","/w/index.php?title=MediaWiki:Gadget-ReferenceTooltips.js&action=raw&ctype=text/javascript&508635914","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modu
