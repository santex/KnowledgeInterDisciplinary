In our minds we often have images of\nobjects, events and settings. Sternberg: Cognitive Psychology. 2009\nFor example, If you were asked to recall a birthday party, you could probably\nremember the people, the place where it was held, and things that you saw and\nmaybe even the things you smelt. You cannot actually smell and see those things\nbut you can imagine them.\n\nIn contemporary philosophy, specifically in fields of metaphysics such as\nphilosophy of mind and ontology, a mental representation is one of the\nprevailing ways of explaining and describing the nature of ideas and concepts.\n\nMental representations (or mental imagery) enable representing things that have\nnever been experienced as well as things that do not exist. Sternberg:\nCognitive Psychology. 2009 Think of yourself traveling to a place you have\nnever been before, or having a third arm. These things have either never\nhappened or are impossible and do not exist, yet our brain and mental imagery\nallows us to imagine them. Although visual imagery is more likely to be\nrecalled, mental Imagery may involve representations in any of the sensory\nmodalities, such as, hearing, smell, or taste. Kosslyn proposes images are used\nto help solve certain types of problems. We are able to visualize the objects in\nquestion and mentally represent the images to solve it.
