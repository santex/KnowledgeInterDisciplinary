{"cursor":"9541","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The 'Mars Scout Program' was a NASA initiative to send a series of small, low-\ncost robotic missions to Mars, competitively selected from innovative proposals\nby the scientific community. The program had an array of missions destined to\nreach Mars, and study it at relatively low costs. Each Scout project was to cost\nless than US$485 million. The Phoenix lander and MAVEN orbiter were selected and\ndeveloped before the program was retired in 2010.
