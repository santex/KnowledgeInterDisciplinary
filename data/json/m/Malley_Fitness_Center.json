Dedicated October 8, 1999 the center is the primary sports and\nfitness center for the general population at Santa Clara University.\n\nBuilt at a cost of $8.8 million, the facility\nis named for legendary SCU football coach Pat Malley and includes three full\nbasketball/volleyball courts, a large weight room, two locker rooms, a\nmultipurpose room, lounge space, and new offices for recreation and wellness\nprograms. As weight and fitness facitilies are available for University\nathletics in the Leavey Center, Malley is always open to the campus community\nfor recreational use.\n\nSCU alumni, including many of Coach Malley's former football players, were\nsignificantly involved in the financing, planning and construction of the\nfacility, which includes approximately $400,000 in exercise equipment. \n\nDaily attendance of SCU students, staff,\nfaculty and alumni at the 44,000-sauare-foot fitness center averaged about 1,200\n(more than 25% of the undergraduate population) per day in its first month of\noperation. The tile-roof and adobe-wall structure situated next to the Leavey\nActivities Center and pool on the east side of the SCU campus was designed by\nCannon architects of Los Angeles.\n\nGary J. Filizetti, SCU '67, is one of several former Bronco football players who\nwere instrumental in the planning and fundraising for the project. He is\npresident of DEVCON Inc. of Milpitas, general contractor for the project.\nDEVCON's manager for the SCU project was another Bronco football player coached\nby Malley, Andy Schatzman, SCU '83. At the dedication ceremonies, a large mural\nhonoring Malley, the late SCU football coach, was unveiled.\n\nThe weight room is named the Filizetti-McPherson Weight Room, after Filizetti's\nfather, John, and Bill McPherson, SCU '54, the former Santa Clara and San\nFrancisco 49ers assistant coach. The lobby area was donated by another Bronco,\nformer 49er Brent Jones, SCU '85, and his wife Dana, SCU '86.\n\nMaster of ceremonies at the dedication was John Ottoboni, SCU '69, a San Jose\nlawyer who as a member of the SCU Board of Trustees was an early advocate of the\nMalley Center project.\n\nA highlight of the October 8 dedication ceremony was the unveiling of the Malley\nmural: three 74-inch-by-56-inch photo montages of Malley silk-screened on blue\nglass, under the titles, Coach, Educator, Friend; above a limestone panel\ninscribed with a quote from the coach.\n\nThe mural was designed by SCU Marketing Communications Art Director Greg Mar and\nTony Tirapelli and was constructed by General Graphics of San Francisco, which\ndoes the displays and graphics for the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. An\ninteractive video kiosk with a large plasma display screen directs visitors to\nMalley Center activities and informs them about the university and its programs.\n\nOther alumni involvement in the center's construction includes:\n\n* The Class of '61 Multi-Purpose Room\n* The Hayden Gymnasium -- The William R. and Virginia Hayden Foundation (Stan\n  Hayden, SCU '63)\n* The Nelson Wellness Center - Dick, SCU '69, and Nancy Nelson\n* The Anne Halligan Helmstein Women's Locker Room - the wife of the late Homer\n  Helmstein, SCU '37\n* The Albanese Family Men's Locker Room - Jos.
