He frequently serves as a sympathetic enemy of Batman.\nCreated by Bob Kane, he first appeared in [[Batman (comic book)|Batman]] #121\n(February 1959).\n\nFreeze is a scientist who must wear a cryogenic suit in order to survive, and\nbases his crimes around a \"cold\" or \"ice\" theme, complete with a \"freeze gun\"\nthat freezes its targets solid. In the most common variation of his origin\nstory, he is a former cryogenics expert who suffered an industrial accident\nwhile attempting to cure his terminally ill wife, Nora.\n\nIn the original [[Batman (TV series)|Batman]] television series, Mr. Freeze was\nplayed in various episodes by George Sanders, Otto Preminger and Eli Wallach. He\nwas voiced in [[Batman: The Animated Series]] by Michael Ansara, and by Clancy\nBrown in [[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]. In the 1997 film [[Batman &\nRobin (film)|Batman & Robin]], he was portrayed by Arnold Schwarzenegger.\n\nIGN's list of the Top 100 Comic Book Villains of All Time List ranked Mr. Freeze\nas #67.\n","linknr":892,"url":"Mr._Freeze","recorded":1362893113,"links":43,"instances":["comics","comics","comics","comics","fiction","comics","comics","dc_comics","comics","website","artist","comics","comics","comics","comics","comics","arts","fiction","comics","comics","comics","dc_comics","terry_mcginnis","actor","visual_arts"],"pdf":[],"categories":["DC
