His title seems to have been a purely honorary one, for his patriarchate\nlay under the dominion of the Saracens, and he himself resided at\nConstantinople. Nothing is known of him before the Sixth Ecumenical Council,\nwhich deposed him on account of his monothelitism, after which he disappeared\ninto obscurity in a Roman monastery. Nonetheless, he is noted in ecclesiastical\nhistory for causing the anathemisation or condemnation of Pope Honorius I.\n\nIn the first session of the council, the Roman legates delivered an address in\nwhich they described four successive patriarchs of Constantinople and others as\nhaving \"disturbed the peace of the world by new and unorthodox expressions\",\nreferring to the controversial doctrine of monothelitism. Macarius retorted, \"We\ndid not publish new expressions but what we have received from the holy and\nÅcumenical synods and from holy approved fathers\". He then went through the\nnames given by the legates, adding to them that of Pope Honorius.\n\nIn this and the following session Macarius was unable to find any references to\nmonothelitism in a passage from St. Cyril of Alexandria and St. Leo. In the\nthird session, several documents which he claimed emanated from Mennas and Pope\nVigilius were found to be forgeries, surreptitiously introduced into the Acts of\nthe Fifth Ecumenical Council. In the fifth and sixth sessions, he and his\nadherents produced three volumes of patristic testimonies which were sealed up\nfor later examination. In the eighth session, he read his ecthesis, or\n\"profession of faith\", in which he appealed to the authority of Honorius on\nbehalf of Monothelitism. In answer to questions put to him by the Emperor, he\ndeclared that he would rather be cut to pieces and thrown into the sea than\nadmit the doctrine of Dythelitism, which states that Jesus Christ had two wills,\nthe divine and human. In this same session and the following one his patristic\ntestimonies were found to be hopelessly garbled. He was formally deposed at the\nclose of the ninth session.\n\nAlthough his case was closed, Macarius had left the council more work to do. The\npapal legates seemed determined that monothelitism should be disposed of once\nand for all, so, when at the eleventh session the emperor inquired if there was\nany further business, they answered that there were some further writings\npresented by Macarius and one of his disciples still awaiting examination. Among\nthese documents was the first letter of Honorius to Sergius. The legates,\napparently without any reluctance, accepted the necessity of condemning\nHonorius. They must have felt that any other course of action would leave the\ndoor open for a revival of monothelitism. Their conduct in this respect is the\nmore noteworthy because the Sixth General Council acted throughout on the\nassumption that the doctrinal definitions of the Roman Pontiff were\nirreformable. The council had not met to deliberate but to bring about\nsubmission to the epistle of Pope St. Agatho â an uncompromising assertion of\npapal infallibility â addressed to it. see Harnack, \"Dogmengesch.\", II, 408;\n2nd edition)\n\nAt the close of the council Macarius and five others were sent to Rome to be\ndealt with by the pope. This was done at the request of the council and not, as\nHefele makes it appear, at the request of Macarius and his\nadherents. History of Councils, V, 179; Eng. trans. Macarius and three\nothers who still held out were confined in different monasteries (see [[Liber\nPontificalis]], Leo II).\n\nLater on Pope Benedict II tried for thirty days to persuade Macarius to recant.\nThis attempt was quoted in the first session of the Seventh General Council as a\nprecedent for the restoration of bishops who had fallen from the Faith. Baronius\ngives reasons for supposing that Benedict's purpose was to restore Macarius to\nhis patriarchal dignity, the patriarch who had succeeded him having just died\n(Annales, ann. 685).\n\nThe profession of faith in the Eucharist, in his \"Ecthesis\", is perhaps the\nearliest instance of a reference to this doctrine in a formal creed. To Macarius\nthe Eucharist was a palmary argument against Nestorianism. The flesh and blood\nin the Eucharist is not mere flesh and blood, he argued, for how else could it\nbe life-giving? He contended that it is life-giving because it is the own flesh\nand blood of the Word, which being God is by nature Life. Macarius develops this\nargument in a manner which shows how shadowy the line was which separated the\nMonothelite from the Monophysite.\n","linknr":115,"url":"Macarius_of_Antioch","recorded":1375080839,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Macarius_of_Antioch&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Macarius_of_Antioch&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Eastern_Orthodox_Church","/w/index.php?title=George_I_of_Antioch&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Theophanes_of_Antioch&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Patriarch_of_Antioch","/wiki/Saracen","/wiki/Constantinople","/wiki/Third_Council_of_Constantinople","/wiki/Monothelitism","/wiki/Rome","/wiki/Anathemisation","/wiki/Pope_Honorius_I","/wiki/Monothelitism","/wiki/Cyril_of_Alexandria","/wiki/Pope_Leo_I","/wiki/Mennas","/wiki/Pope_Vigilius","/wiki/Fifth_Ecumenical_Council","/wiki/Dythelitism","/wiki/Jesus_Christ","/wiki/Papal_legate","/wiki/Sergius","/wiki/Pope_Agatho","/wiki/Papal_infallibility","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Hefele","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Liber_Pontificalis","/wiki/Pope_Benedict_II","/wiki/Seventh_General_Council","/wiki/Eucharist","/wiki/Nestorianism","/wiki/Monophysite","/w/index.php?title=Macarius_of_Antioch&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Honorius_I","/wiki/Councils_of_Constantinople","/w/index.php?title=Macarius_of_Antioch&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-1","#cite_ref-2","/wiki/File:Wikisource-logo.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/12px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png","/wiki/Public_domain","//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Catholic_Encyclopedia_(1913)/Macarius_of_Antioch","/wiki/Catholic_Encyclopedia","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Macarius_of_Antioch&oldid=552715392","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:7th-century_bishops","/wiki/Category:People_declared_heretics_by_the_first_seven_Ecumenical_Councils","/wiki/Category:Articles_incorporating_text_from_the_1913_Catholic_Encyclopedia_with_Wikisource_reference","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Macarius+of+Antioch&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Macarius+of+Antioch","/wiki/Macarius_of_Antioch","/wiki/Talk:Macarius_of_Antioch","#","/wiki/Macarius_of_Antioch","/w/index.php?title=Macarius_of_Antioch&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Macarius_of_Antioch&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Macarius_of_Antioch","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Macarius_of_Antioch","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Macarius_of_Antioch&oldid=552715392","/w/index.php?title=Macarius_of_Antioch&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3011919","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Macarius_of_Antioch&id=552715392","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Macarius+of+Antioch","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Macarius+of+Antioch&oldid=552715392&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Macarius_of_Antioch&printable=yes","//fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macaire_Ier_d%27Antioche","//pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac%C3%A1rio_de_Antioquia","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3011919#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macarius_of_Antioch","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/stati
