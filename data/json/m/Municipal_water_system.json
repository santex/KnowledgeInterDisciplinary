{"cursor":"9941","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nA 'water supply system' or 'water supply network' is a system of engineered\nhydrologic and hydraulic components which provide water supply. A water supply\nsystem typically includes:\n# A drainage basin (see water purification - sources of drinking water). A raw\n# water collection point (above or below ground) where the water accumulates,\n# such as a lake, a river, or groundwater from an underground aquifer. Raw water\n# may be transferred using uncovered ground-level aqueducts, covered tunnels or\n# underground water pipes to water purification facilities. Water purification\n# facilities. Treated water is transferred using water pipes (usually\n# underground). Water storage facilities such as reservoirs, water tanks, or\n# water towers. Smaller water systems may store the water in cisterns or\n# pressure vessels. Tall buildings may also need to store water locally in\n# pressure vessels in order for the water to reach the upper floors. Additional\n# water pressurizing components such as pumping stations may need to be situated\n# at the outlet of underground or above ground reservoirs or cisterns (if\n# gravity flow is impractical). A pipe network for distribution of water to the\n# consumers (which may be private houses or industrial, commercial or\n# institution establishments) and other usage points (such as fire hydrants).\n# Connections to the sewers (underground pipes, or aboveground ditches in some\n# developing countries) are generally found downstream of the water consumers,\n# but the sewer system is considered to be a separate system, rather than part\n# of the water supply system.\n","linknr":347,"url":"Municipal_water_system","recorded":1362372141,"links":26,"instances":["graph_theory","water_supply"],"pdf":["http://www.tmvw.be/userfiles/file/WATERPUNT_voor_web.pdf"],"categories":["Water industry","Environmental engineering","Hydraulics","Water supply infrastructure"],"headings":["Water abstraction and raw water transfer","Water treatment","Water distribution network","Topologies of water distribution networks","Water network maintenance","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/Mergefrom.svg/50px-Mergefrom.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d8/Grand_Coulee_Dam_spillway.jpg/230px-Grand_Coulee_Dam_spillway.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b9/Arizona_cap_canal.jpg/150px-Arizona_cap_canal.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2e/Concrete_water_pipe.jpg/150px-Concrete_water_pipe.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2b/Water_well_tank.JPG/150px-Water_well_tank.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/Drinking_water.jpg/18px-Drinking_water.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["aqueduct","watercourse"],["loop","graph_theory"],["aqueduct","water_supply"]],"members":["loop","aqueduct"],"related":["Hydrologic","Hydraulic","Water_supply","Drainage_basin","Raw_water","Lake","River","Groundwater","Aquifer","Aqueduct_(watercourse)","Tunnel","Water_pipes","Water_purification","Water_pipe","Reservoirs","Water_tank","Water_tower","Cisterns","Pressure_vessel","Pumping_station","Fire_hydrant","Sanitary_sewer","Ditch","Raw_water","Surface_water","Lake","River","Groundwater","Water_well","Aquifer","Drainage_basin","Water_resource","Algae","Fertilizer","Raw_water","Tunnel","Water_pipes","World_Health_Organization","United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency","Fresh_water","Drinking_water","Water_quality","Pressure","Pressure","Pump","Water_tower","Reservoir","Pressure_vessel","Water_well","Local_government","Cities","Water_privatization","Urban_planner","Civil_engineering","Pipe_network_analysis","Corrosion","Iron","Copper","Domestic_water_system","Lead","Solder","Brass","Plumbing_fixture","PH","Alkalinity","Calcium_carbonate","Corrosion_inhibitors","Phosphates","Silicates","Disinfectant","Sodium_hypochlorite","Monochloramine","Disinfection","Loop_(graph_theory)","Graph_theory","Distribution_main","Computerized_maintenance_management_system","Aqueduct_(water_supply)","Civil_Engineering","Domestic_water_system","Hardy_Cross_method","Hydrology","Infrastructure","Plumbing","River","Tap_water","Water","Water_pipes","Water_meter","Water_well","Automatic_meter_reading","Backflow_prevention_device","Fire_hydrant","Strainers","Valve","Water_tower","Water_quality","Water_resources","Water_supply"]}
