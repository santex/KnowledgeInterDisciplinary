{"cursor":"11312","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Motion graphics' are graphics that use video footage and/or animation\ntechnology to create the illusion of motion or rotation, and are usually\ncombined with audio for use in multimedia projects. Motion graphics are usually\ndisplayed via electronic media technology, but may be displayed via manual\npowered technology (e.g. thaumatrope, phenakistoscope, stroboscope, zoetrope,\npraxinoscope, flip book) as well. The term is useful for distinguishing still\ngraphics from graphics with a transforming appearance over time without over-\nspecifying the form.
