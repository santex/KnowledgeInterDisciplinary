The language is\npreserved in inscriptions in Linear B, a script first attested on Crete before\nthe 14th century BC. Most instances of these inscriptions are on clay tablets\nfound in Knossos in central Crete, and in Pylos in the southwest of the\nPeloponnese. Other tablets have been found at Mycenae itself, Tiryns and Thebes\nand at Chania in Western Crete. * The language is named after Mycenae,\none of the major centres of Mycenaean Greece.\n\nThe tablets remained long undeciphered, and every conceivable language was\nsuggested for them, until Michael Ventris deciphered the script in 1952 and by a\npreponderance of evidence proved the language to be an early form of Greek.\n\nThe texts on the tablets are mostly lists and inventories. No prose narrative\nsurvives, much less myth or poetry. Still, much may be glimpsed from these\nrecords about the people who produced them and about Mycenaean Greece, the\nperiod before the so-called Greek Dark Ages.\n","linknr":660,"url":"Mycenaean_Greek_language","recorded":1362903280,"links":48,"instances":["phonetics","phonetics"],"pdf":["http://www.utexas.edu/research/pasp/publications/pdf/kafkania.pdf","http://www.explorecrete.com/archaeology/linearB.pdf"],"categories":["Mycenaean Greek language|","Varieties of Ancient Greek","Ancient languages","Languages of ancient Thessaly","Languages of ancient Crete"],"headings":["Orthography","Phonology","Morphology","Greek features","Corpus","See also","Notes","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/Homeric_Greece.svg/300px-Homeric_Greece.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/P46.jpg/180px-P46.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg/16px-Portal-puzzle.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/People_icon.svg/16px-People_icon.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["voice","phonetics"],["aspiration","phonetics"],["aspiration","phonetics"]],"members":["voice","aspiration"],"related":["Balkans","Crete","Hellenic_languages","Linear_B","Greece","Homer","Iliad","Bronze_Age","Greek_language","Crete","Cyprus","Mycenaean_period","Dorian_invasion","Linear_B","Knossos","Crete","Pylos","Peloponnese","Mycenae","Mycenaean_Greece","Michael_Ventris","Greek_Dark_Ages","Linear_B","Linear_A","Eteocretan","Alphabet","Orthography","Voice_(phonetics)","Aspiration_(phonetics)","Spiritus_asper","Labialized_velar_consonant","Knossos","Bilabial_consonant","Dental_consonant","Palatal_consonant","Velar_consonant","Labiovelar_consonant","Glottal_consonant","Nasal_stop","Plosive_consonant","Aspiration_(phonetics)","Fricative_consonant","Approximant","Trill_consonant","Lateral_consonant","Ancient_Greek","Indo-European_language","Digamma","Β","Attic_Greek","Ζ","Attic_Greek","Linear_B","Semivowels","Sonorant","Sibilant","Occlusive","Nominative_case","Genitive_case","Accusative_case","Dative_case","Instrumental_case","Locative_case","Vocative_case","Minoan_chronology","Helladic_period","Kafkania_pebble","Thomas_G._Palaima","Mycenaean_Greece","Greek_language","Society_for_the_Promotion_of_Hellenic_Studies"]}
