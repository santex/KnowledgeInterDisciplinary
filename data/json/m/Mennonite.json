The teachings of the Mennonites were founded on their\nbelief in both the mission and ministry of Jesus Christ, which they held to with\ngreat conviction despite persecution by the various Roman Catholic and\nProtestant states. Rather than fight, the majority survived by fleeing to\nneighboring states where ruling families were tolerant of their radical belief\nin believer's baptism. Over the years, Mennonites have become known as one of\nthe historic peace churches because of their commitment to pacifism (opposition\nto war and violence).\n\nIn contemporary society, Mennonites either are described only as a religious\ndenomination with members of different ethnic origins  or\nas both an ethnic group and a religious denomination. There is, however, still\nambiguity and controversy among Mennonites about this issue, with some insisting\nthat they are simply a religious group while others argue that they form a\ndistinct ethnic group  Some historians and sociologists treat\nMennonites as an ethno-religious group, while other historians\nchallenge that perception.\n\nThere are about 1.7 million Mennonites worldwide as of 2012. Mennonite congregations worldwide embody the full\nscope of Mennonite practice from \"plain people\" to those who are\nindistinguishable in dress and appearance from the general population. The\nlargest populations of Mennonites are in India, Ethiopia,\nCanada, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the United States, but\nMennonites can also be found in tight-knit communities in at least 82 countries\non six continents or scattered amongst the populace of those countries. There\nare German Mennonite colonies in Argentina, Belize,\nBolivia, [http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/21/world/americas/21bolivia.html\n\"Bolivian Reforms Raise Anxiety on Mennonite Frontier\"], [[The New York\nTimes]] Brazil, Mexico, Uruguay, and Paraguay, who\nare to a large extent descendants of Mennonites living in eastern Europe, and\nthere remains a small congregation in the Netherlands where Simons was born.\n\nThe Mennonite Disaster Service, based in North America, provides both\nimmediate and long-term responses to hurricanes, floods, and other disasters.\nThe Mennonite Central Committee provides disaster relief around the world\nalongside their long-term international development programs. Other programs\noffer a variety of relief efforts and services throughout the world.\n\nSince the latter part of the 20th century, some Mennonite groups have also\nbecome more actively involved with peace and social justice issues, helping to\nfound Christian Peacemaker Teams and Mennonite Conciliation
