It\ncan occur as part of natural weather or volcanic activity, and is common in cold\nair above warmer water, in exhaled air in the cold, and in a steam room of a\nsauna. It can also be created artificially with aerosol canisters if the\nhumidity conditions are right.\n\nThe only difference between mist and fog is\nvisibility. http://www.rcn27.dial.pipex.com/cloudsrus/mistnfog.html\nThis phenomenon is called fog if the visibility is one kilometre (1,100 yards)\nor less (in the UK for driving purposes the definition of fog is visibility less\nthan 200 metres, for pilots the distance is 1 kilometre). Otherwise it is known\nas mist. Seen from a distance, mist is bluish, and haze is more brownish.\n\nReligious connotations are associated with mist in some cultures; it is used as\na metaphor in 2 Peter 2:17.\n\nMist makes a beam of light visible from the side via refraction and reflection\non the suspended water droplets.\n\n\"Scotch mist\" is a light steady drizzle.\n\nMist usually occurs near the shores, and is often associated with fog. Mist can\nbe as high as mountain tops when extreme temperatures are low.\n","linknr":165,"url":"Mist","recorded":1362372238,"links":54,"instances":["disambiguation","physics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Air pollution","Fog","Psychrometrics"],"headings":["Freezing mist","References","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/31/AAfog3.jpg/88px-AAfog3.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d3/Zimba_Panorama.jpg/120px-Zimba_Panorama.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7d/Misty_morning02.jpg/120px-Misty_morning02.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Cyclone_Catarina_from_the_ISS_on_March_26_2004.JPG/40px-Cyclone_Catarina_from_the_ISS_on_March_26_2004.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["reflection","physics"],["spray","disambiguation"]],"members":["spray","reflection"],"related":["Water","Air","Weather","Volcanic","Exhalation","Sauna","Aerosol_spray","Humidity","Fog","Haze","Religious","2_Peter","Light_beam","Refraction","Reflection_(physics)","Albuquerque","New_Mexico","Moralberg","Swifts_Creek","Aeroponics","Brocken_spectre","Drizzle","Fog","Haze","Spray_(disambiguation)"]}
