{"cursor":"11871","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Medicinal chemistry' and 'pharmaceutical chemistry' are disciplines at the\nintersection of chemistry, especially synthetic organic chemistry, and\npharmacology and various other biological specialties, where they are involved\nwith design, chemical synthesis and development for market of pharmaceutical\nagents, or bio-active molecules (drugs).\n\nCompounds used as medicines are most often organic compounds, which are often\ndivided into the broad classes of small organic molecules (e.g., atorvastatin,\nfluticasone, clopidogrel) and \"biologics\" (infliximab, erythropoietin, insulin\nglargine), the latter of which are most often medicinal preparations of proteins\n(natural and recombinant antibodies, hormones, etc.). Inorganic and\norganometallic compounds are also useful as drugs (e.g., lithium and platinum-\nbased agents such as lithium carbonate and cis-platin.\n\nIn particular, medicinal chemistry in its most common guiseâfocusing on small\norganic moleculesâencompasses synthetic organic chemistry and aspects of natural\nproducts and computational chemistry in close combination with chemical biology,\nenzymology and structural biology, together aiming at the discovery and\ndevelopment of new therapeutic agents. Practically speaking, it involves\nchemical aspects of identification, and then systematic, thorough synthetic\nalteration of new chemical entities to make them suitable for therapeutic use.\nIt includes synthetic and computational aspects of the study of existing drugs\nand agents in development in relation to their bioactivities (biological\nactivities and properties), i.e., understanding their structure-activity\nrelationships (SAR). Pharmaceutical chemistry is focused on quality aspects of\nmedicines and aims to assure fitness for purpose of medicinal products.\n\nAt the biological interface, medicinal chemistry combines to form a set of\nhighly interdisciplinary sciences, setting its organic, physical, and\ncomputational emphases alongside biological areas such as biochemistry,\nmolecular biology, pharmacognosy and pharmacology, toxicology and veterinary and\nhuman medicine; these, with project management, statistics, and pharmaceutical\nbusiness practices, systematically oversee altering identified chemical agents\nsuch that after pharmaceutical formulation, they are safe and efficacious, and\ntherefore suitable for use in treatment of disease.\n","linknr":282,"url":"Medicinal_chemistry","recorded":1362500837,"links":44,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Medicinal chemistry","Cheminformatics"],"headings":["Medicinal chemistry in the path of drug discovery","Training in medicinal chemistry","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8b/Nuvola_apps_kalzium.svg/28px-Nuvola_apps_kalzium.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Chemistry","Pharmacology","Drug_design","Organic_synthesis","Pharmaceutical","Medication","Organic_compounds","Small_molecule","Atorvastatin","Fluticasone","Clopidogrel","Biologic_medical_product","Infliximab","Erythropoietin","Insulin_glargine","Recombinant_DNA","Antibodies","Hormones","Inorganic","Organometallic","Lithium","Platinum","Lithium_carbonate","Cis-platin","Synthetic_organic_chemistry","Computational_chemistry","Chemical_biology","Enzymology","Structural_biology","New_chemical_entity","Structure-activity_relationship","Physical_chemistry","Computational_chemistry","Biochemistry","Molecular_biology","Pharmacognosy","Pharmacology","Toxicology","Veterinary","Medicine","Project_management","Statistics","Pharmaceutical_formulation","Natural_products","Chemical_libraries","Combinatorial_chemistry","Pharmacophore","Pharmacokinetic","Pharmacodynamic","Clinical_trials","Chemical_synthesis","Formulation","Formulation_science","Process_synthesis","Good_manufacturing_practice","Drug_design","Drug_metabolism","Enzyme_inhibitor","Galenic_formulation","Inverse_benefit_law","Medical_biology","Medical_physics","Molecular_Conceptor","Pharmaceutical_company","Pharmacodynamics","Pharmacognosy","Pharmacokinetics","Pharmacology","Pharmacophore","Xenobiotic_metabolism","MedChemComm","Chemmedchem","Journal_of_Medicinal_Chemistry","ACS_Medicinal_Chemistry_Letters"]}
