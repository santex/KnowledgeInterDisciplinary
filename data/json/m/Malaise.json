Malaise\nis often defined in medical literature as a \"general feeling of being unwell\".\nThe word has existed in the French language since at least the 12th century.\n\nThe term is also often used figuratively in other contexts; for example,\n\"economic malaise\" refers to an economy that is stagnant or in recession\n(compare depression). The term is particularly associated with the 1973â75\nrecession. One example can be found in The Next 200 Years: A Scenario for\nAmerica and the World, by Herman Kahn et al., published in 1976, p. 2.\nA speech made by President Jimmy Carter in 1979 is commonly referred to as\nthe \"malaise\" speech, even though Carter did not actually use the term in\nthis speech.\n","linknr":296,"url":"Malaise","recorded":1362672740,"links":26,"instances":["economics","medical","disease"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Diseases and disorders","Emotions"],"headings":["Cause","Associated conditions","See also","Notes and references","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["depression","economics"],["plague","disease"],["fatigue","medical"]],"members":["depression","fatigue","plague"],"related":["Suffering","Infection","Economic_malaise","Depression_(economics)","1973–75_recession","Herman_Kahn","Jimmy_Carter","Malaise_speech","Non-specific_symptom","Emotion","Vasovagal_response","Hypoglycemia","Cancer","Stroke","Heart_attack","Internal_bleeding","Akathisia","Altitude_sickness","Anemia","Aphthous_ulcer","Appendicitis","Babesiosis","Bolivian_hemorrhagic_fever","Borderline_personality_disorder","Cat_scratch_disease","Chickenpox","Chronic_fatigue_syndrome","Chronic_myelogenous_leukemia","Chronic_kidney_disease","Chronic_sinusitis","Common_cold","Conjunctivitis","Coryza","Diabetes_mellitus","Diabetic_nephropathy","Dysautonomia","Ebola","Epilepsy","Fever","Fibromyalgia","Gilbert's_syndrome","Haemochromatosis","Hemolytic_anemia","Herpes_zoster","HIV","AIDS","HELLP_syndrome","Hepatitis","Hyponatremia","Infection","Infectious_mononucleosis","Infectious_endocarditis","Infectious_pericarditis","Influenza","Lead_poisoning","Leukemia","Lupus_erythematosus","Lyme_disease","Major_depressive_disorder","Malaria","Methicillin-resistant_Staphylococcus_aureus","Migraine","Multiple_myeloma","Neurotoxicity","Opsoclonus_myoclonus_syndrome","Plague_(disease)","Pneumonia","Q_fever","Rabies","Rheumatoid_arthritis","Scrofula","Scurvy","Sickness_behavior","African_trypanosomiasis","Smallpox","Staphylococcus","Streptococcal_pharyngitis","Syphilis","Withdrawal","Fatigue_(medical)","Prodrome","Ehlers–Danlos_syndrome"]}
