      "text" : "\nA 'mental image' is an experience that, on most occasions, significantly\nresembles the experience of perceiving some object, event, or scene, but occurs\nwhen the relevant object, event, or scene is not actually present to the\nsenses.<ref>McKellar, 1957</ref><ref>Richardson, 1969</ref><ref>Finke,\n1989</ref><ref>Thomas, 2003</ref> There are sometimes episodes, particularly on\nfalling asleep (hypnagogic imagery) and waking up (hypnopompic), when the mental\nimagery, being of a rapid, phantasmagoric and involuntary character, defies\nperception, presenting a kaleidoscopic field, in which no distinct object can be\ndiscerned.<ref></ref>\n\nThe nature of these experiences, what makes them possible, and their function\n(if any) have long been subjects of research and controversy in philosophy,\npsychology, cognitive science, and more recently, neuroscience. As contemporary\nresearchers use the expression, mental images (or mental imagery) can occur in\nthe form of any sense, so that we may experience auditory images,<ref>Reisberg,\n1992</ref> olfactory images,<ref>Bensafi et al., 2003</ref> and so forth.\nHowever, the vast majority of philosophical and scientific investigations of the\ntopic focus upon visual mental imagery. It has been assumed that, like humans,\nmany types of animals are capable of experiencing mental images.<ref>Aristotle:\n[[On the Soul]] III.3 428a</ref> Due to the fundamentally subjective nature of\nthe phenomenon, there is little to no evidence either for or against this view.\n\nPhilosophers such as George Berkeley and David Hume, and early experimental\npsychologists such as Wilhelm Wundt and William James, understood ideas in\ngeneral to be mental images, and today it is very widely believed that much\nimagery functions as mental representations (or mental models), playing an\nimportant role in memory and thinking.<ref>Pavio, 1986</ref><ref>Egan,\n1992</ref><ref>Barsalou, 1999</ref><ref>Prinz, 2002</ref> William Brant (2013,\np. 12) traces the scientific use of the phrase \"mental images\" back to the\nWilliam Tyndall's 1870 speech called the \"Scientific Use of the Imagination.\"\nSome have gone so far as to suggest that images are best understood to be, by\ndefinition, a form of inner, mental or neural representation;<ref>Block,\n1983</ref><ref>Kosslyn, 1983</ref> in the case of hypnagogic and hypnapompic\nimagery, it is not representational at all. Others reject the view that the\nimage experience may be identical with (or directly caused by) any such\nrepresentation in the mind or the brain,<ref>Sartre, 1940</ref><ref>Ryle,\n1949</ref><ref>Skinner, 1974</ref><ref>Thomas, 1999</ref><ref>Bartolomeo,\n2002</ref><ref>Bennett & Hacker, 2003</ref> but do not take account of the non-\nrepresentational forms of imagery.\n\nIn 2010 IBM applied for a patent on how to extract mental images of human faces\nfrom the human brain. It uses a feedback loop based on brain measurements of the\nfusiform face area in the brain which activates proportionate with degree of\nfacial recognition.<ref>[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/20100049076.pdf IBM\nPatent Application: Retrieving mental images of faces from the human\nbrain]</ref>\n",
