Developed by MathWorks, MATLAB allows matrix\nmanipulations, plotting of functions and data, implementation of algorithms,\ncreation of user interfaces, and interfacing with programs written in other\nlanguages, including C, C++, Java, and Fortran.\n\nAlthough MATLAB is intended primarily for numerical computing, an optional\ntoolbox uses the MuPAD symbolic engine, allowing access to symbolic computing\ncapabilities. An additional package, Simulink, adds graphical multi-domain\nsimulation and Model-Based Design for dynamic and embedded systems.\n\nIn 2004, MATLAB had around one million users across industry and academia.<ref\nname=\"eetimes2004\">Richard Goering,\n\"[http://www.eetimes.com/news/design/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=49400392 Matlab\nedges closer to electronic design automation world],\" EE Times, 10/04/2004</ref>\nMATLAB users come from various backgrounds of engineering, science, and\neconomics. MATLAB is widely used in academic and research institutions as well\nas industrial enterprises.\n\n'''\n","title":"MATLAB","headings":["History","Syntax","Graphics and graphical user interface programming","Object-oriented programming","Interfacing with other languages","License","Alternatives","Release history","File extensions","Easter eggs","See also","Notes","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["4: MathWorks","4: Fortran","2: Cross-platform","2: List_of_numerical_analysis_software","2: Proprietary_software","2: Object-oriented_programming","2: Numerical_analysis","2: C++","2: MuPAD","2: Sinc_function","2: .NET_Framework","2: Mathematica","1: Imperative_programming","1: Procedural_programming","1: Array_programming","1: Dynamic_typing","1: Weak_typing","1: Fourth-generation_programming_language","1: Algorithm","1: User_interface","1: Computer_algebra_system","1: Symbolic_computing","1: Simulink","1: Model_based_design","1: Dynamical_system","1: Embedded_systems","1: Engineering","1: Science","1: Economics","1: Cleve_Moler","1: Computer_science","1: University_of_New_Mexico","1: LINPACK","1: EISPACK","1: Applied_mathematics","1: John_N._Little","1: Stanford_University","1: LAPACK","1: Control_engineering","1: Linear_algebra","1: Image_processing","1: Functional_programming","1: Type_system#Strong_and_weak_typing","1: Array_data_type#Index_origin","1: Identity_matrix","1: Magic_square","1: Lambda_calculus","1: Graphical_user_interface","1: Sine_wave","1: MEX_file","1: ActiveX","1: XML","1: SQL","1: Java_Metadata_Interface","1: Wolfram_Research","1: MathML","1: Vendor_lock-in","1: European_Union","1: Maple_software","1: Free_software","1: Open_source","1: GNU_Octave","1: FreeMat","1: Scilab","1: S-Lang","1: IT++","1: Perl_Data_Language","1: Perl","1: SciPy","1: MS-DOS","1: Intel_80386","1: X87#80387","1: Windows_3.1x","1: Math_coprocessor","1: Hierarchical_Data_Format","1: PowerPC","1: Mac_OS_X_Snow_Leopard#64-bit_architecture","1: SPARC","1: Appleâ€“Intel_architecture","1: Macintosh","1: Linux","1: Spy_vs_Spy","1: Comparison_of_numerical_analysis_software","1: BSD_License"]}
