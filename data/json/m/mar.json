silent final yodh) is a title of respect in Syriac, literally\nmeaning 'my lord'. It is given by custom to all bishops and saints.<ref>\"Mor (or\nMar) is an honorific title used both for bishops and for saints\" ([http://books-\n.google.com/books?id=Xa1zdxyfxLYC&pg=PA1&dq=mar+bishop+syriac+title&hl=en&ei=7i-\n68Ta6oE8mxhAfgjfnWBQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=9&ved=0CFAQ6AEwCDgU#v-\n=onepage&q=mar%20bishop%20syriac%20title&f=false Sebastian P.

In the second Syriac inscription,\nAppendix I, the title is used for Bishop Diskoros)\" ([http://books.google.com/b-\nooks?id=c9oYAAAAYAAJ&q=mar+bishop+syriac+title&dq=mar+bishop+syriac+title&hl=en-\n&ei=zyu8TYrSPIKKhQeHxMy2BQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CDsQ6AEw-\nAw Erica Dodd, The Frescoes of Mar Musa al-Habashi (Pontifical Institute of\nMedieval Studies 2001 ISBN 978-0-88844-139-3), p. 23).]</ref> The corresponding\nfeminine form given to women saints is Mart or Mort (, {{Transl|syr|Mārt(y)}}).\nThe title is placed before the Christian name, as in Mar Aprem/Mor Afrem and\nMart/Mort Maryam. This is the original meaning of the name Martha 'A Lady'.\n\nThe variant Maran or Moran (, {{Transl|syr|Māran}}), meaning 'Our Lord', is a\nparticular title given to Jesus, either alone or in combination with other names\nand titles. Likewise, Martan or Mortan (, {{Transl|syr|Mārtan}}, 'Our Lady') is\na title of Mary.\n\nOccasionally, the term Maran or Moran has been used of various patriarchs and\ncatholicoi. The Syriac Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch, the Malankara Orthodox\nCatholicos and the Syro-Malankara Major Archbishop Catholicos use the title\nMoran Mor. Sometimes the Indian bearers of this title are called Moran Mar,\nusing a hybrid style from both Syriac dialects that reflects somewhat the\nhistory of Syrian Christians in Kerala. The Pope of Rome is referred to as Mar\nPapa by the Nasranis (Saint Thomas Christians) of India.\n\nThe obscure variant Marya or Moryo (, {{Transl|syr|Māryā}}) is used in the\nPeshitta Old Testament to render the Tetragrammaton. Although this word is\nclearly a derived form of the above, there is a fanciful derivation found in\nearly Syriac lexica, that the word is an initialism as follows:\n* — , {{Transl|syr|māruṯā}}, 'lordship'\n* — , {{Transl|syr|rabbuṯā}}, 'majesty'\n* — , {{Transl|syr|iṯyā}}, 'self-existence' In Mishnaic Hebrew through to date\n  this Aramaic word is pronounced [mar] (Hebrew: מָר), and it is used as a\n  formal way of addressing or referring to a male person. In Rabbanical circles\n  of Jews from the Middle East, the Aramaic word מָרָן (Aramaic: our lord) is a\n  title to a highly appreciated Rabbis, such as Ovadia Yosef, the spiritual\n  leader of Shas party. But some interpret this title, מָרָן, as an abbreviation\n  of the expression מֵאָה רַבָּנים נִסְמָךְ ('is ordinated by 100 rabbis'),\n  which is, of course, a backronym.\n","title":"mar","headings":["See also","References"]},"micro-relation":["2: Syriac_language","1: Yodh","1: Bishop","1: Saint","1: Christian_name","1: Ephrem_the_Syrian","1: Our_Lord","1: Jesus","1: Patriarch","1: Catholicos","1: Syriac_Orthodox_Patriarch_of_Antioch","1: Syro-Malankara_Catholic_Church","1: Kerala","1: Pope","1: Nasrani","1: India","1: Peshitta","1: Old_Testament","1: Tetragrammaton","1: Initialism","1: Mishnaic_Hebrew","1: Jews","1: Middle_East","1: Ovadia_Yosef","1: Shas","1: Backronym","1: Syriac_Christianity"]}
