{"cursor":"58680","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Magic realism' is a genre where magic elements are a natural part in an\notherwise mundane, realistic environment. Faris, Wendy B. and Lois Parkinson\nZamora, Introduction to Magical Realism: Theory, History, Community, pp. 5\nAlthough it is most commonly used as a literary genre, magic realism also\napplies to film and the visual arts.\n\nOne example of magic realism occurs when a character in the story continues to\nbe alive beyond the normal length of life and this is subtly depicted by the\ncharacter being present throughout many generations. On the surface the story\nhas no clear magical attributes and everything is conveyed in a real setting,\nbut such a character breaks the rules of our real world. The author may give\nprecise details of the real world such as the date of birth of a reference\ncharacter and the army recruitment age, but such facts help to define an age for\nthe fantastic character of the story that would turn out to be an abnormal\noccurrence like someone living for two hundred years.\n\nThe term is broadly descriptive rather than critically rigorous: Professor\nMatthew Strecher defines magic realism as \"what happens when a highly detailed,\nrealistic setting is invaded by something too strange to believe.\" Matthew\nC. Strecher, Magical Realism and the Search for Identity in the Fiction of\nMurakami Haruki, Journal of Japanese Studies, Volume 25, Number 2 (Summer 1999),\npp. 263-298, at 267. This critical perspective towards magical realism\nstems from the Western reader's disassociation with mythology, a root of magical\nrealism more easily understood by non-Western cultures. Faris, Wendy B. and Lois Parkinson Zamora, Introduction to Magical\nRealism: Theory, History, Community, pp. 3-4 Western confusion regarding\nmagical realism is due to the \"conception of the real\" created in a magical\nrealist text: rather than explain reality using natural or physical laws, as in\ntypical Western texts, magical realist texts create a reality \"in which the\nrelation between incidents, characters, and setting could not be based upon or\njustified by their status within the physical world or their normal acceptance\nby bourgeois mentality.\" Simpkins, Scott. \"Magical Strategies: The\nSupplement of Realism.\" Twentieth Century Literature 34.2 (1988): 140-154. Web.\n. Many writers are categorized as\n\"magical realist,\" which confuses what the term really means and how wide its\ndefinition is.
