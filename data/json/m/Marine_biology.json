{"cursor":"22625","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n'Marine biology' is the scientific study of organisms in the ocean or other\nmarine or brackish bodies of water. Given that in biology many phyla, families\nand genera have some species that live in the sea and others that live on land,\nmarine biology classifies species based on the environment rather than on\ntaxonomy. Marine biology differs from marine ecology as marine ecology is\nfocused on how organisms interact with each other and the environment, and\nbiology is the study of the organisms themselves.\n\nMarine life is a vast resource, providing food, medicine, and raw materials, in\naddition to helping to support recreation and tourism all over the world. At a\nfundamental level, marine life helps determine the very nature of our planet.\nMarine organisms contribute significantly to the oxygen cycle, and are involved\nin the regulation of the Earth's climate. {{cite journal\n| tournal = Climatic Change title = Planktonic dimethylsulfide and cloud albedo:\n| An estimate of the feedback response volume = 18 issue = 1 coauthors = Karl E.\n| Taylor, Steven J.

It studies\nhabitats such as coral reefs, kelp forests, tidepools, muddy, sandy and rocky\nbottoms, and the open ocean (pelagic) zone, where solid objects are rare and the\nsurface of the water is the only visible boundary.\n\nA large proportion of all life on Earth exists in the oceans. Exactly how large\nthe proportion is unknown, since many ocean species are still to be discovered.\nWhile the oceans constitute about 71% of the Earth's surface, due to their\ndepth they encompass about 300 times the habitable volume of the terrestrial\nhabitats on Earth.\n\nMany species are economically important to humans, including food fish. It is\nalso becoming understood that the well-being of marine organisms and other\norganisms are linked in very fundamental ways. The human body of knowledge\nregarding the relationship between life in the sea and important cycles is\nrapidly growing, with new discoveries being made nearly every day. These cycles\ninclude those of matter (such as the carbon cycle) and of air (such as Earth's\nrespiration, and movement of energy through ecosystems including the ocean).\nLarge areas beneath the ocean surface still remain effectively unexplored.\n","linknr":969,"url":"Marine_biology","recorded":1362510305,"links":80,"instances":["biophysical","fish","wwf","length","zoology","biology","phylum","biology","ocean","poaceae"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Marine
