{"cursor":"57358","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"An iron atom with five CO ligands]] 'Metal carbonyls' are coordination\ncomplexes of transition metals with carbon monoxide ligands. They occur as\nneutral complexes, as positively charged metal carbonyl cations or as negatively\ncharged metal carbonylates. The carbon monoxide ligand may be bond terminally to\na single metal atom or bridging to two or more metal atoms. These complexes may\nbe homoleptic, that is containing only CO ligands, such as nickel carbonyl\n(Ni(CO) 4), but more commonly metal carbonyls are heteroleptic and\ncontain a mixture of ligands.\n\nMetal carbonyls are useful in organic synthesis and as catalysts or catalyst\nprecursors in homogeneous catalysis, such as hydroformylation and Reppe\nchemistry. In the Mond process, nickel carbonyl is used to produce pure nickel.\nIn organometallic chemistry, metal carbonyls serve as precursors for the\npreparation of other organometalic complexes.\n\nMetal carbonyls are toxic by skin contact, inhalation or ingestion, in part\nbecause of their ability to carbonylate hemoglobin to give carboxyhemoglobin,\nwhich prevents the binding of O
