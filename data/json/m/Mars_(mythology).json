Mary\nBeard, J.A. North, and S.R.F. Price, Religions of Rome: A History (Cambridge\nUniversity Press, 1998), pp. 47â48. He was second in importance only to\nJupiter, and he was the most prominent of the military gods worshipped by the\nRoman legions. His festivals were held in March, the month named for him (Latin\n''Martius''), and in October, which began and ended the season for military\ncampaigning and farming.\n\nUnder the influence of Greek culture, Mars was identified with the Greek god\nAres, whose myths were reinterpreted in Roman literature and art under the name\nof Mars. But the character and dignity of Mars differed in fundamental ways from\nthat of his Greek counterpart, who is often treated with contempt and revulsion\nin Greek literature. Kurt A. Raaflaub, War and Peace in the Ancient World\n(Blackwell, 2007), p. 15. Mars was a part of the Archaic Triad along with\nJupiter and Quirinus, the latter of whom as a guardian of the Roman people had\nno Greek equivalent. Mars' altar in the Campus Martius, the area of Rome that\ntook its name from him, was supposed to have been dedicated by Numa himself, the\npeace-loving semi-legendary second king of Rome. Although the center of Mars'\nworship was originally located outside the [[pomerium]], or sacred boundary of\nRome, Augustus brought the god into the center of Roman religion by establishing\nthe Temple of Mars Ultor in his new forum. Paul Rehak and John G. Younger,\nImperium and Cosmos: Augustus and the Northern Campus Martius (University of\nWisconsin Press, 2006), pp. 11â12.\n\nAlthough Ares was viewed primarily as a destructive and destabilizing force,\nMars represented military power as a way to secure peace, and was a father\n(pater) of the Roman people. Isidore of Seville calls Mars Romanae gentis\nauctorem, the originator or founder of the Roman people as a [[gens]]\n(Etymologiae 5.33.5). In the mythic genealogy and founding myths of Rome,\nMars was the father of Romulus and Remus with Rhea Silvia. His love affair with\nVenus symbolically reconciled the two different traditions of Rome's founding;\nVenus was the divine mother of the hero Aeneas, celebrated as the Trojan refugee\nwho \"founded\" Rome several generations before Romulus laid out the city walls.\n\nThe importance of Mars in establishing religious and cultural identity within\nthe Roman Empire is indicated by the vast number of inscriptions identifying him\nwith a local deity, particularly in the Western provinces.\n","linknr":982,"url":"Mars_(mythology)","recorded":1362484556,"links":86,"instances":["mythology","mythology","mythology","roman","gens","mythology","deity","archaeologist","mythology","italic_tribe","mythology","ancient_rome","mythology","classicist","mythology","mythology","human","roman_province","goddess","spain","mythology","goddess","ancient_rome","god"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Deities
