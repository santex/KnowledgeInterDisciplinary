Understood as the sharing of\n\"free\" electrons among a lattice of positively charged ions (cations), metallic\nbonding is sometimes compared with that of molten salts; however, this\nsimplistic view holds true for very few metals. In a more quantum-mechanical\nview, the conduction electrons divide their density equally over all atoms that\nfunction as neutral (non-charged) entities. Metallic bonding accounts for many\nphysical properties of metals, such as strength, malleability, ductility,\nthermal and electrical conductivity, opacity, and\nluster.

Not all metals exhibit metallic bonding: one such example is the\nmercurous ion (), which forms covalent metal-metal bonds.\n","linknr":355,"url":"Metallic_bond","recorded":1362477010,"links":51,"instances":["element","optics","purity","matter","mineralogy"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Chemical bonding","Metals"],"headings":["History","The nature of metallic bonding","Metallic radius","Strength of the bond","Solubility and compound formation","Localization and clustering: from bonding to bonds","Optical properties","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["opacity","optics"],["lustre","mineralogy"],["mercury","element"],["carat","purity"],["phase","matter"],["lustre","mineralogy"]],"members":["mercury","opacity","carat","phase","lustre"],"related":["Delocalized_electron","Conduction_electrons","Crystal_structure","Cations","Metal","Quantum-mechanical","Physical_properties","Strength_of_materials","Malleability","Ductility","Thermal_conductivity","Electrical_conductivity","Opacity_(optics)","Lustre_(mineralogy)","Covalent_bond","Mercurous_ion","Periodic_table","Acids","Electrochemistry","Free_electron_model","Nearly_free_electron_model","Magnitude","Wave_vector","Fermi_surface","Brillouin_zone","X-ray_diffraction","Thermal_analysis","Phase_diagram","William_Hume-Rothery","Cyclotron_resonance","Caesium","Density_functional_theory","Density_functional_theory","Semiconductor","Peierls","Unpaired_electron","Delocalization","Electron_pair","Benzene","Aromaticity","Naphthalene","Anthracene","Ovalene","Graphene","Isoelectronic","Borazine","Semiconductor","Semimetal","Metal_aromaticity","Metal_cluster","Alloys","Electronegativity","Atom","Mercury_(element)","Sodium","Caesium","Nearly-free_electron_model","Wave_vector","Fermi_surface","Cyclotron_resonance","Tight_binding","Unpaired_electron","Magnetism","Atoms","Electron","Energy_level","Electron_deficiency","Wave_vector","Malleability","Ductility","Carat_(purity)","Phonon","Diamond","Semiconductor","Helium","Victor_Goldschmidt","Periodic_trends","Effective_nuclear_charge","Valence_electrons","Principal_quantum_number","Lanthanide_contraction","Electron_shielding","Atomic_orbitals","Tungsten","Group_12_element","Helium","Ultra-high_vacuum","Gallium","Metallic_glass","Conformational_change","Dual_polarisation_interferometry","Solid_solubility","Electrum","Intermetallics","Law_of_definite_proportions","Phase_(matter)","Metallurgy","Chemistry","X-ray_photoelectron_spectroscopy","Metal_cluster","Hydrogen","Metallic_hydrogen","Jupiter","Icosahedron","Charge_density_wave","Superconductivity","Electron_pair","Light","Lustre_(mineralogy)","Plasmon_frequency","Indium_tin_oxide","Degenerate_semiconductor","Infrared","Silver","Surface_plasmon_resonance","Momentum","Colloidal_gold","Bonding_in_solids","Metal_aromaticity"]}
