By contrast, massless particles, such as photons, are\nnot considered matter, because they have neither rest mass nor volume. However,\nnot all particles with rest mass have a classical volume, since fundamental\nparticles such as quarks and leptons (sometimes equated with matter) are\nconsidered \"point particles\" with no effective size or volume. Nevertheless,\nquarks and leptons together make up \"ordinary matter,\" and their interactions\ncontribute to the effective volume of the composite particles that make up\nordinary matter.\n\nMatter commonly exists in four [[state of matter|states]] (or [[phase\n(matter)|phases]]): solid, liquid and gas, and plasma. . However, advances in\nexperimental techniques have revealed other previously theoretical phases, such\nas Boseâ€“Einstein condensates and fermionic condensates. A focus on an elementary-\nparticle view of matter also leads to new phases of matter, such as the\nquarkâ€“gluon plasma.<ref name=RHIC> {{cite press |date=18 April 2005 |url=http://www.bnl.gov/bnlweb/pubaf/pr/pr_display.asp?prid=05-\n38 |title=RHIC Scientists Serve Up \"Perfect\" Liquid |publisher=Brookhaven\nNational Laboratory |accessdate=2009-09-15 }}</ref> For much of the history of\nthe natural sciences people have contemplated the exact nature of matter.

As the speed of light is , a relatively small amount of matter may be\nconverted to a large amount of energy. An example is that positrons and\nelectrons (matter) may transform into photons (non-matter). However, although\nmatter may be created or destroyed in such processes, neither the quantity of\nmass or energy change during the process.\n\nMatter should not be confused with mass, as the two are not quite the same in\nmodern physics.<ref name=Mongillo> {{cite book |author=J. Mongillo |year=2007\n|title=Nanotechnology 101 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=j69lwrrQ4nsC&pg=PA30\n|page=30 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing |isbn=0-313-33880-9 }}</ref> For\nexample, mass is a conserved quantity, which means that its value is unchanging\nthrough time, within closed systems. However, matter is not conserved in such\nsystems, although this is not obvious in ordinary conditions on Earth, where\nmatter is approximately conserved. Still, special relativity shows that matter\nmay disappear by conversion into energy, even inside closed systems, and it can\nalso be created from energy, within such systems. However, because mass (like\nenergy) can neither be created nor destroyed, the quantity of mass and the\nquantity of energy remain the same during a transformation of matter (which\nrepresents a certain amount of energy) into non-material (i.e., non-matter)\nenergy. This is also true in the reverse transformation of energy into matter.\n\nDifferent fields of science use the term matter in different, and sometimes\nincompatible, ways. Some of these ways are based on loose historical meanings,\nfrom a time when there was no reason to distinguish mass and matter. As such,\nthere is no single universally-agreed scientific meaning of the word \"matter.\"\nScientifically, the term \"mass\" is well-defined, but \"matter\" is not. Sometimes\nin the field of physics \"matter\" is simply equated with particles that exhibit\nrest mass (i.e., that cannot travel at the speed of light), such as quarks and\nleptons. However, in both physics and chemistry, matter exhibits both wave-like\nand particle-like properties, the so-called waveâ€“particle duality.<ref\nname=Davies> {{cite book |author=P.C.W.
