{"cursor":"7738","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Megasthenes' (ÎÎµÎ³Î±ÏÎ¸Î­Î½Î·Ï, ca. 350 â 290 BCE) was a Greek ethnographer and\nexplorer in the Hellenistic period, author of the work Indica. He was born in\nAsia Minor (modern day Turkey) and became an ambassador of Seleucus I of the\nSeleucid dynasty possibly to Chandragupta Maurya in Pataliputra, India. However\nthe exact date of his embassy is uncertain. Scholars place it before 298 BC, the\ndate of Chandragupta's death.\n\nArrian explains that Megasthenes lived in Arachosia, with the satrap Sibyrtius,\nfrom where he visited India:  \"Megasthenes lived with Sibyrtius,\nsatrap of Arachosia, and often speaks of his visiting Sandracottus, the king of\nthe Indians.\" Arrian, [[Anabasis Alexandri]]\n[http://websfor.org/alexander/arrian/book5a.asp v,6] \n\nWe have more definite information regarding the parts of India Megasthenes\nvisited. He entered the subcontinent through the district of the Pentapotamia,\nproviding a full account of the rivers found there (thought to be the five\naffluents of the Indus that form the Punjab region), and proceeded from there by\nthe royal road to Pataliputra. There are accounts of Megasthenes having visited\nMadurai (then, a bustling city and capital of the Pandyas), but he appears not\nto have visited any other parts of India.\n\nAt the beginning of his Indica, he refers to the older Indians who know about\nthe prehistoric arrival of Dionysus and Hercules in India, which was a story\nvery popular amongst the Greeks during the Alexandrian period. Particularly\nimportant are his comments on the religions of the Indians. He mentions the\ndevotees of Heracles and Dionysus but he does not mention Buddhists, something\nthat gives support to the theory that the latter religion was not widely known\nbefore the reign of Ashoka. Vassiliades, Demetrios, \"Greeks and Buddhism\nHistorical Contacts in the Development of a Universal religion\"The Eastern\nBuddhist, Vol. XXXVI, No. 1 & 2, Otani University, Kyoto 2005.\n\nHis Indica served as an important source for many later writers such as Strabo\nand Arrian. He describes such features as the Himalayas and the island of Sri\nLanka. He also describes a caste system different from the one that exists\ntoday, which shows that the caste system may to some extent be fluid and\nevolving. However, it might be that, being a foreigner, he was not adequately\ninformed about the caste system. His description follows:\n\n:The first is formed by the collective body of the Philosophers, which in point\nof number is inferior to the other classes, but in point of dignity preeminent\nover all. The philosopher who errs in his predictions incurs censure, and then\nobserves silence for the rest of his life. :The second caste consists of the\nHusbandmen, who appear to be far more numerous than the others. They devote the\nwhole of their time to tillage; nor would an enemy coming upon a husbandman at\nwork on his land do him any harm, for men of this class, being regarded as\npublic benefactors, are protected from all injury. :The third caste consists of\nthe Shepherds and in general of all herdsmen who neither settle in towns nor in\nvillages, but live in tents. :The fourth caste consists of the Artizans. Of\nthese some are armourers, while others make the implements that husbandmen and\nothers find useful in their different callings. This class is not only exempted\nfrom paying taxes, but even receives maintenance from the royal exchequer. :The\nfifth caste is the Military. It is well organized and equipped for war, holds\nthe second place in point of numbers, and gives itself up to idleness and\namusement in the times of peace. The entire force--men-at-arms, war-horses, war-\nelephants, and all--are maintained at the king's expense. :The sixth caste\nconsists of the Overseers. It is their province to inquire into and superintend\nall that goes on in India, and make report to the king, or, where there is not a\nking, to the magistrates. :The seventh caste consists of the Councillors and Assessors,--\nof those who deliberate on public affairs. It is the smallest class, looking to\nnumber, but the most respected, on account of the high character and wisdom of\nits members; for from their ranks the advisers of the king are taken, and the\ntreasurers, of the state, and the arbiters who settle disputes. The generals of\nthe army also, and the chief magistrates, usually belong to this class.\n\nLater writers such as Arrian, Strabo, Diodorus, and Pliny refer to Indica in\ntheir works. Of these writers, Arrian speaks most highly of Megasthenes, while\nStrabo and Pliny treat him with less respect. Indica contained many legends and\nfabulous stories, similar to those we find in the Indica of Ctesias.\n\nMegasthenes' Indica is the first well-known Western account of India and he is\nregarded as one of the founders of the study of Indian history in the West. He\nis also the first foreign Ambassador to be mentioned in Indian history.\n\nMegasthenes also comments on the presence of pre-Socratic views among the\nBrahmans and Jews. Five centuries later Clement of Alexandria, in his\nStromateis, may have misunderstood Megasthenes to be responding to claims of\nGreek primacy by admitting Greek views of physics were preceded by those of Jews\nand Indians. Megasthenes, like Numenius of Apamea, was simply comparing the\nideas of the different ancient cultures. Bezalel Bar-Kochva The Image of the\nJews in Greek Literature: The Hellenistic Period 2009 \"He does not respond to\nthe implied claim of Greek primacy, presumably because he did not have, and\ncould not have had, hard information about the beginnings of âparallelâ opinions\namong the Brahmans\".\n","linknr":165,"url":"Megasthenes","recorded":1375071576,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Megasthenes&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Megasthenes&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","/wiki/Help:Section","/wiki/MOS:HEAD","/wiki/Greeks","/wiki/List_of_Graeco-Roman_geographers","/wiki/Hellenistic_period","/wiki/Asia_Minor","/wiki/Seleucus_I","/wiki/Seleucid_dynasty","/wiki/Chandragupta_Maurya","/wiki/Pataliputra","/wiki/India","/wiki/Arrian","/wiki/Arachosia","/wiki/Satrap","/wiki/Sibyrtius","/wiki/Sandracottus","/wiki/Arrian","/wiki/Anabasis_Alexandri","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Indus_River","/wiki/Punjab_region","/wiki/Madurai","/wiki/Pandyan_kingdom","/wiki/Ashoka","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Strabo","/wiki/Arrian","/wiki/Himalayas","/wiki/Sri_Lanka","/wiki/Arrian","/wiki/Strabo","/wiki/Diodorus","/wiki/Pliny_the_Younger","/wiki/Ctesias","/wiki/Pre-Socratic_philosophy","/wiki/Stromateis","/wiki/Numenius_of_Apamea","#cite_note-3","/w/index.php?title=Megasthenes&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","http://websfor.org/alexander/arrian/book5a.asp","#cite_ref-2","/wiki/Demetrios_Vassiliades","#cite_ref-3","http://www.archive.org/stream/ancientindiaasd02mccrgoog#page/n6/mode/2up","http://books.google.com/books?id=xp35-8gTRDkC&pg=PA130&dq=Yamuna","/wiki/Motilal_Banarsidass","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Special:BookSources/81-208-1323-5","/wiki/Demetrios_Vassiliades","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Special:BookSources/ISBN_81-215-0921-1","http://books.google.com/books?id=J1MOAAAAQAAJ","/w/index.php?title=Megasthenes&action=edit&section=2","http://www.shsu.edu/~his_ncp/Indica.html","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Megasthenes&oldid=565314181","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:350_BC_births","/wiki/Category:290_BC_deaths","/wiki/Category:Ancient_Greek_geographers","/wiki/Category:Ancient_Greeks_in_Asia","/wiki/Category:Historiography_of_India","/wiki/Category:Historians_of_India","/wiki/Category:Greek_Indologists","/wiki/Category:Ancient_Greek_explorers","/wiki/Category:Ambassadors_in_Greek_Antiquity","/wiki/Category:Articles_needing_sections_from_March_2013","/wiki/Category:All_articles_needing_sections","/wiki/Category:Articles_covered_by_WikiProject_Wikify_from_March_2013","/wiki/Category:All_articles_covered_by_WikiProject_Wikify","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Megasthenes&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Megasthenes","/wiki/Megasthenes","/wiki/Talk:Megasthenes","#","/wiki/Megasthenes","/w/index.php?title=Megasthenes&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Megasthenes&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Megasthenes","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Megasthenes","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Megasthenes&oldid=565314181","/w/index.php?title=Megasthenes&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q312548","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Megasthenes&id=565314181","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Megasthenes","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Megasthenes&oldid=565314181&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Megasthenes&printable=yes","//bn.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E0%A6%AE%E0%A7%87%E0%A6%97%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%B8%E0%A7%8D%E0%A6%A5%E0%A6%BF%E0%A6%A8%E0%A6%BF%E0%A6%B8","//bg.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9C%D0%B5%D0%B3%D0%B0%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%BD","/
