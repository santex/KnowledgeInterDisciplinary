After Cass Elliot had a hit in the summer of 1969 with\nMann/Weil's \"It's Getting Better\" she recorded \"Make Your Own Kind of Music\" as\nthe follow-up single and her album [[Bubblegum, Lemonade, and... Something for\nMama]] was re-released as Make Your Own Kind of Music, the title cut having been\nadded to the original track listing. However Elliot's \"Make Your Own Kind of\nMusic\" single only just reached the Top 40 at #36: the similar chart impact of\nthe follow-up single: another Mann/Weil composition entitled \"New World Coming\"\nwhich reached #42, signaled Elliot's inability to maintain a profile as a\ncurrent hitmaker as the 1960s turned into the 1970s. The Cass Elliot track is in\nthe key of E major.\n","linknr":160,"url":"Make_Your_Own_Kind_of_Music_(song)","recorded":1362667960,"links":13,"instances":["cass_elliot_song","lost","the_carpenters_song","music"],"pdf":[],"categories":["1969 singles","Songs written by Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil","Cass Elliot songs","Barbra Streisand songs"],"headings":["Chart performance","Remixes","Other versions","Popular culture","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["it's_getting_better","cass_elliot_song"],["it's_getting_better","cass_elliot_song"],["medley","music"],["sing","the_carpenters_song"],["adrift","lost"]],"members":["adrift","sing","medley"],"related":["Cass_Elliot","Bubblegum,_Lemonade,_and..._Something_for_Mama","Pop_music","Dunhill_Records","Barry_Mann","Cynthia_Weil","Steve_Barri","It's_Getting_Better_(Cass_Elliot_song)","Pop_music","Barry_Mann","Cynthia_Weil","Cass_Elliot","It's_Getting_Better_(Cass_Elliot_song)","Top_40","E_major","Hot_Adult_Contemporary_Tracks","Universal_Records","Barbra_Streisand","Medley_(music)","Sing_(The_Carpenters_song)","Billboard_Hot_100","Barbra_Streisand...And_Other_Musical_Instruments","Bobby_Sherman","Paul_Westerberg","Ste_McCabe","Mary_Roos","Desmond_Hume","Man_of_Science,_Man_of_Faith","Adrift_(Lost)","Flashes_Before_Your_Eyes","Sitar","Live_Together,_Die_Alone","Snickers","Hallmark_Cards","Greeting_card","Newgrounds.com","IKEA","Bouygues_Telecom"]}
