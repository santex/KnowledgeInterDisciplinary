The clan was\noriginally known as the Kakizaki clan who settled Kakizaki, Kawauchi, Mutsu of\nthe Shimokita Peninsula. Claiming descendence from the Takeda of Wakasa\nprovince, the family later took the name Matsumae. In exchange for their service\nin defending the country, the Matsumae were made exempt from owing rice to the\nshogunate in tribute, and from the [[sankin kÅtai]] system, under which most\ndaimyo (feudal lords of Edo period Japan) were required to spend half the year\nat Edo, while their families were, essentially, held hostage to prevent\nrebellion, spending the entire year at Edo.\n\nDue to their location, and their role as border defenders, the Matsumae were\nthe first Japanese to negotiate with Russia in any semi-official way. They\nmight very well have been the first Japanese to meet Russians at all, within\nJapanese territory. In 1778, a merchant from Yakutsk by the name of Pavel Lebedev-\nLastoschkin arrived in HokkaidÅ with a small expedition. He offered gifts, and\npolitely asked to trade. The Matsumae official tried to explain that he had no\nauthority to agree to trade on behalf of the shogun and that they should come\nback the following year. The following September, the Russians did just that,\naccording to some accounts misinterpreting what had been said, and expecting to\ntrade. Their gifts were returned to them, they were forbidden to return to the\nisland, and were advised that foreign trade was only allowed at Nagasaki, a\nport on the southernmost of Japan's home islands. In 1790, a massive earthquake\nstruck HokkaidÅ, and a forty-two-foot tsunami lifted the Russian ship out of\nthe sea, depositing it a quarter-mile inland. The merchant Lebedev thus gave up\non HokkaidÅ.\n\nThe Matsumae clan's fief had extensive contacts with the Ainu of Hokaido, and\nhad exclusive rights to trade with the Ainu communities of the island's and to\nguarantee the security of Japanese interests in the area. The Matsumae relations\nwith the Ainu was conflictive at times, demonstrating that their power was not\nabsolute in the region. In 1669 what started as a fight for resources between\nrivaling Ainu clans developed into a rebellion against the Matsumae control of\nthe region until 1672 when Shakushain's Revolt was finally put down. The last\nserious Ainu rebellion was the Menashi-Kunashir Rebellion in 1789. Kakizaki\nHakyÅ painted the [[IshÅ« RetsuzÅ]], a series of portraits of Ainu chiefs, in\norder to prove to the Japanese populace that the Matsumae were capable of\ncontrolling the northern borders and the Ainu. The 12 paintings of Ainu chiefs\nwere displayed in 1791 in Kyoto.\n\nAt roughly the same time, in 1789, Finnish professor Erik Laxman, of the Russian\nAcademy of Sciences, came across several Japanese castaways in Irkutsk. Like\nseveral other Japanese before them, they had been found in the Aleutians, off\nthe coast of Alaska, by Russian sailors and had asked to be brought back to\nJapan. Like those before them, these castaways had been transported instead\nacross Siberia on their way to St. Petersburg. Laxman saw this as an opportunity\nto work towards the opening of Japan, and suggested this to Catherine the Great,\nwho agreed. In 1791 she appointed the professor's son, Lt. Adam Laxman, to\ncommand the voyage to return these castaways to Japan, and to open discussions\nof a trade agreement.\n\nThe expedition reached HokkaidÅ in October of 1792, and found the Japanese\nsurprisingly hospitable. The Russians were allowed to spend the winter, and\ntheir forms were sent to the [[bakufu]] in Edo. However, Professor Laxman\ninsisted on bringing the castaways to Edo, and that he would sail there himself\neven against the Shogun's desires. The bakufu sent an envoy to the Matsumae,\nrequesting that the Russians make their way to the town of Matsumae by land;\nsensing a trap, the Russians refused, and were eventually allowed to make port\nin Hakodate, escorted by a Japanese vessel. They were given a guest house near\nMatsumae castle, and were, unusually, allowed their Western customs (they did\nnot deny their Christianity, remove their boots indoors, nor bow to the Shogun's\nenvoys), with little or no negative repercussions. They were given by the\nJapanese envoys three swords and a hundred bags of rice.\n\nThey were informed that the Shogun's rules remained unchangeable: foreigners\ncould trade at Nagasaki only, if they came unarmed. All other ships would be\nsubject to seizure. Due to his purposes in returning castaways, Laxman was\ngranted a pardon in this instance, but he refused to relinquish the castaways\nuntil given something in writing answering his request for trade. The envoys\nreturned three days later with a document, restating the rules regarding trade\nat Nagasaki, and the laws against the practice of Christianity in Tokugawa\nJapan. The Russians never did establish any regular system of trade at Nagasaki,\nand historians today still disagree as to whether the document given to\nProfessor Laxman was an invitation to trade, or an evasive maneuver on the part\nof the shogunate. The Russian expedition led by Adam Johann von Krusenstern and\nNikolai Rezanov stayed six months in the port of Nagasaki in 1804â1805, failing\nto establish diplomatic and trade relations with Japan.\n\n'' on the clothing of the standing figure in background looks like four diamond-\nshapes turned sideways.]] \"opened the door\" to Japan.]] .]] Since the Matsumae\nland was a march, a frontier land used as the border defense against the Ainu,\nthe remainder of HokkaidÅ, then called Ezo, essentially became an Ainu\nreservation. Although Japanese influence and control over the Ainu gradually\ngrew stronger over the centuries, at that time, they were left to their own\ndevices and were not considered part of Japanese territory by the shogunate. It\nwas only during the Meiji Restoration in the late 19th century that the march\nwas dissolved and HokkaidÅ formally annexed by Japan.\n","linknr":159,"url":"Matsumae_clan","recorded":1375071984,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Matsumae_clan&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Matsumae_clan&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Hokkaid%C5%8D","/wiki/Matsumae,_Hokkaid%C5%8D","/wiki/File:Takedabishi2.gif","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b5/Takedabishi2.gif/140px-Takedabishi2.gif","/wiki/File:Takedabishi2.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Mon_(badge)","/wiki/Japanese_name","/wiki/Family_name","/wiki/Help:Installing_Japanese_character_sets","/wiki/Matsumae,_Hokkaid%C5%8D","/wiki/Marches","/wiki/Toyotomi_Hideyoshi","/wiki/Ainu_people","/w/index.php?title=Kakizaki_clan&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Kawauchi,_Aomori","/wiki/Mutsu,_Aomori","/wiki/Shimokita_Peninsula","/wiki/Takeda_clan","/wiki/Wakasa_province","/wiki/Tokugawa_shogunate","/wiki/Sankin_k%C5%8Dtai","/wiki/Daimyo","/wiki/Edo_period","/wiki/Edo","/wiki/Russia","/wiki/Yakutsk","/wiki/Pavel_Lebedev-Lastoschkin","/wiki/Nagasaki,_Nagasaki","/wiki/Tsunami","/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_clarify","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/wiki/Shakushain%27s_Revolt","/wiki/Menashi-Kunashir_Rebellion","/wiki/Kakizaki_Hakyo","/w/index.php?title=Ish%C5%AB_Retsuz%C5%8D&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/wiki/Finland","/wiki/Erik_Laxman","/wiki/Irkutsk","/wiki/Aleutian_Islands","/wiki/Alaska","/wiki/Siberia","/wiki/Saint_Petersburg","/wiki/Catherine_the_Great","/wiki/Adam_Laxman","/wiki/Bakufu","/wiki/Hakodate","/wiki/Nagasaki,_Nagasaki","/wiki/Tokugawa_shogunate","/wiki/Adam_Johann_von_Krusenstern","/wiki/Nikolai_Rezanov","/wiki/File:Matsue_mon_c1850s.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/86/Matsue_mon_c1850s.jpg/160px-Matsue_mon_c1850s.jpg","/wiki/File:Matsue_mon_c1850s.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Mon_(emblem)","/wiki/File:Matsue_daimyo_c1850s.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e9/Matsue_daimyo_c1850s.jpg/160px-Matsue_daimyo_c1850s.jpg","/wiki/File:Matsue_daimyo_c1850s.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Perry_Expedition","/wiki/File:Matumae_Takahiro.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ea/Matumae_Takahiro.jpg/160px-Matumae_Takahiro.jpg","/wiki/File:Matumae_Takahiro.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Edo_period","/wiki/Ezo","/wiki/Meiji_Restoration","/w/index.php?title=Matsumae_clan&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Empire_of_Japan%E2%80%93Russian_Empire_relations","/w/index.php?title=Matsumae_clan&action=edit&section=2","http://ambitious.lib.hokudai.ac.jp/hoppodb/kyuki.cgi?magoid=0A006500000001000&page=1","http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~me4k-skri/han/mutudewa/matumae.html","/w/index.php?title=Matsumae_clan&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/National_Archives_of_Japan","http://jpimg.digital.archives.go.jp/kouseisai/category/emaki/matsumae_okikuchi_e.html","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Matsumae_clan&oldid=565759012","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Japanese_clans","/wiki/Category:Matsumae_clan","/wiki/Category:People_from_Hokkaido","/wiki/Category:Use_dmy_dates_from_April_2012","/wiki/Category:Articles_containing_Japanese-language_text","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_needing_clarification_from_March_2010","/wiki/Category:All_articles_with_unsourced_statements","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_unsourced_statements_from_November_2010","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_unsourced_statements_from_October_2008","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Matsumae+clan&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Matsumae+clan","/wiki/Matsumae_clan","/wiki/Talk:Matsumae_clan","#","/wiki/Matsumae_clan","/w/index.php?title=Matsumae_clan&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Matsumae_clan&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/w
