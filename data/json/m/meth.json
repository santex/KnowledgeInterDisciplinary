and\n'desoxyephedrine', is a psychostimulant of the phenethylamine and amphetamine\nclass of psychoactive drugs.\n\nMethamphetamine occurs in two enantiomers, dextrorotary and levorotary.\nDextromethamphetamine is a stronger psychostimulant, but levomethamphetamine has\na longer half-life and is CNS-active with weaker (approx. one-tenth) effects on\nstriatal dopamine and shorter psychodynamic\neffects.<ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref> At high doses, both enantiomers of\nmethamphetamine can induce stereotypy and psychosis<ref></ref>, but\nlevomethamphetamine is less desired by drug abusers because of its weaker\npharmacodynamic profile.<ref></ref> Although rarely prescribed,<ref></ref>\nmethamphetamine hydrochloride is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug\nAdministration (FDA) for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity\ndisorder and obesity under the trade name 'Desoxyn'.\n\nIllicitly, methamphetamine may be sold either as pure dextromethamphetamine or\nin a racemic mixture. Both dextromethamphetamine and racemic methamphetamine are\nSchedule II controlled substances in the United States, and similarly the\nproduction, distribution, sale, and possession of methamphetamine is restricted\nor illegal in many jurisdictions. Internationally, methamphetamine has been\nplaced in Schedule II of the United Nations Convention on Psychotropic\nSubstances treaty.<ref name=incb></ref>\n\nContrary to popular misconception, methamphetamine in both powder and crystal\nform is a hydrochloride salt. The freebase form of methamphetamine (as well as\namphetamine) is an oily liquid.<ref>http://www.oehha.org/public_info/pdf/TSD%20-\nMethamphetamine%20Meth%20Labs%2010'8'03.pdf</ref> The misconception started with\nthe fact that heroin and cocaine are injected or snorted as salts, but they are\nsmoked in freebase form. See also: crack cocaine.\n\nIn low dosages, methamphetamine can increase alertness, concentration, and\nenergy in fatigued individuals. In higher doses, it can induce mania with\naccompanying euphoria, feelings of self-esteem and increased libido.<ref name=\"isbn1-59385-174-\nX\"></ref><ref name=\"Logan\">B. K. Logan.

Post-withdrawal syndrome can\npersist beyond the withdrawal period for months, and sometimes up to a year.<ref\nname=\"Cruickshank-2009\"></ref> In addition to psychological harm,
