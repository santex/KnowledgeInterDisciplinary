      "text" : "\n\nIn abstract algebra, a 'matrix ring' is any collection of matrices forming a\nring under matrix addition and matrix multiplication. The set of n&times;n\nmatrices with entries from another ring is a matrix ring, as well as some\nsubsets of infinite matrices which form 'infinite matrix rings'. Any subrings of\nthese matrix rings are also called matrix rings.\n\nIn the case when R is a commutative ring, then the matrix ring M<sub>n</sub>(R)\nis an associative algebra which may be called a 'matrix algebra'. In this\nsituation, if M is a matrix and r is in R, then the matrix Mr is the matrix M\nwith each of its entries multiplied by r.\n\nIt is assumed throughout that R is an associative ring with a unit\n1&nbsp;≠&nbsp;0, although matrix rings can be formed over rings without unity.\n",
