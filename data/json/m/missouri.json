Missouri\ncomprises 114 counties and the independent city of St. Louis.\n\nThe four largest urban areas are St. Louis, Kansas City, Springfield, and\nColumbia.<ref>http://www.census.gov/geo/www/ua/ua2k.txt</ref> Missouri's\ncapital is Jefferson City. The land that is now Missouri was acquired from\nFrance as part of the Louisiana Purchase and became known as the Missouri\nTerritory. Part of the Territory was admitted into the union as the 24th state\non August 10, 1821.\n\nMissouri's geography is highly varied. The northern part of the state lies in\ndissected till plains while the southern part lies in the Ozark Mountains (a\ndissected plateau), with the Missouri River dividing the two. The state lies at\nthe intersection of the three greatest rivers of North America, with the\nconfluence of the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers near St. Louis,<ref></ref> and\nthe confluence of the Ohio River with the Mississippi north of the Bootheel. The\nstarting points of the Pony Express and Oregon Trail were both in\nMissouri.<ref></ref> The mean center of United States population as of the 2010\nCensus is at the town of Plato in Texas County.<ref>[http://www.census.gov/geo/-\nwww/2010census/centerpop2010/centerpop2010.html Centers of Population for the\n2010 Census], U.S. Census Bureau</ref>\n\nEthnically, the majority of
