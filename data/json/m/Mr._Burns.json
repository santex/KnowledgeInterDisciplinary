{"cursor":"24521","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n{{Simpsons character\n| image = name = Mr. Burns gender = Male job = Owner of the Springfield Nuclear\n| Power Plant relatives = 'Father': Colonel Clifford Burns 'Mother:' Daphne\n| Charles Burns 'Son:' Larry appearance = \"Simpsons Roasting on an Open\n| Fire\" voiceactor = Harry Shearer\n}}\n\n'Charles Montgomery' \"'Monty'\" 'Burns', usually\nreferred to as 'Mr. Burns', is a recurring fictional character in the animated\ntelevision series [[The Simpsons]], who is voiced by Harry Shearer and\npreviously Christopher Collins. Burns is the evil owner of the Springfield\nNuclear Power Plant and is Homer Simpson's boss. He is attended at almost all\ntimes by Waylon Smithers, his loyal and sycophantic aide, advisor, confidant and\nsecret admirer.\n\nAlthough originally conceived as a one-dimensional, recurring villain who might\noccasionally enter the Simpsons' lives and wreak some sort of havoc, Burns'\npopularity has led to his repeated inclusion in episodes. He is a stereotype of\ncorporate America in his unquenchable desire to increase his own wealth and\npower, inability to remember his employees' names (including Homer's, despite\nfrequent interactions – which has become something of a recurrent joke)\nand lack of concern for their safety and well-being. Reflecting his advanced\nage, Burns is given to expressing dated humor, making references to pre-1950\npopular culture, and aspiring to apply obsolete technology to everyday life.\n\nBurns' trademark expression is the word \"Excellent\", muttered slowly in a low,\nsinister voice while tenting his fingertips. He occasionally orders Smithers to\n\"release the hounds\", so as to let his vicious guard dogs attack any intruders,\nenemies or even invited guests. Mr. Burns is Springfield's richest and most\npowerful citizen (and also the richest person in Springfield's state; his\ncurrent net worth has been given as $1.3 billion by [[Forbes]],\nthough it fluctuates wildly depending on the episode). He uses his power and\nwealth to do whatever he wants, usually without regard for consequences and\nwithout interference from the authorities. These qualities led ''Wizard\nMagazine'' to rate him the 45th greatest villain of all time.\n","linknr":516,"url":"Mr._Burns","recorded":1362686255,"links":44,"instances":["the_simpsons","magazine","simpsons","the_simpsons","united_states_coin","the_simpsons","united_states"],"pdf":[],"categories":["The Simpsons characters","Fictional business executives","Fictional businesspeople","Fictional Republicans (United States)","Fictional American people of Scottish descent","Fictional World War II veterans","Fictional characters introduced in 1989","Video game bosses"],"headings":["Role in ''The Simpsons''","Character","Reception","Notes","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/56/Mr_Burns.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/79/Harryshearer.jpg/200px-Harryshearer.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/Simpsons_tv_icon.svg/28px-Simpsons_tv_icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/03/Persons.svg/15px-Persons.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Wikiquote-logo-en.svg/40px-Wikiquote-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["springfield","simpsons"],["wizard","magazine"],["governor","united_states"],["nickel","united_states_coin"],["rosebud","the_simpsons"],["rosebud","the_simpsons"],["homer's_odyssey","the_simpsons"],["blood_feud","the_simpsons"],["rosebud","the_simpsons"]],"members":["blood_feud","wizard","springfield","nickel","rosebud","governor"],"related":["Male","Springfield_Nuclear_Power_Plant","Simpsons_Roasting_on_an_Open_Fire","Harry_Shearer","Fictional_character","List_of_animated_television_series","Harry_Shearer","Christopher_Collins","Springfield_Nuclear_Power_Plant","Homer_Simpson","Waylon_Smithers","Sycophant","Villain","Trademark","Hound","Springfield_(Simpsons)","Net_worth","Authorities","Wizard_(magazine)","Closed-circuit_television","Camera","Immigrant","Yale_University","College","Burns,_Baby_Burns","Adoption","Rabies","Marge_Simpson","Jaqueline_Bouvier","United_States_Army","World_War_II","Raging_Abe_Simpson_and_His_Grumbling_Grandson_in_\"The_Curse_of_the_Flying_Hellfish\"","Master_Sergeant","Abraham_Simpson","Ardennes","Battle_of_the_Bulge","Kamikaze","Harry_S._Truman","Europe","United_States","Marshall_Plan","Fidel_Castro","The_Trouble_with_Trillions","Homer_the_Smithers","William_Howard_Taft","Mansion","Attack_dog","Hound","Blackmail","Bribe","Mayor_Quimby","Nuclear_Regulatory_Commission","Governor_(United_States)","Marge_Simpson","Electricity","Maggie_Simpson","Simpson_and_Delilah","Lisa_Simpson","American_Civil_War","Pangea","Austria-Hungary","Siege_of_Khartoum","Prussia","Siam","Autogyro","Nickel_(United_States_coin)","Steak_and_kidney_pie","Coffee","Cheesecake","Newsreel","Battery_Park","Polo_Grounds","Homer_Simpson","Phrenology","Quill_pen","View_camera","Homer_at_the_Bat","Dead-ball_era","Honus_Wagner","Cap_Anson","The_Old_Man_and_Lisa","Recycling","Rosebud_(The_Simpsons)","Thumbs_signal","Insect","Dancin'_Homer","Bowling","Team_Homer","Teddy_bear","Rosebud_(The_Simpsons)","American_History_X-cellent","Schutzstaffel","Oskar_Schindler","Nazi","Matt_Groening","John_D._Rockefeller","David_Rockefeller","Mr._Potter","David_Silverman","Fox_Broadcasting_Company","Barry_Diller","Mantis","There's_No_Disgrace_Like_Home","Ronald_Reagan","Al_Jean","There's_No_Disgrace_Like_Home","Howard_Hughes","Charles_Foster_Kane","George_Meyer","The_Crepes_of_Wrath","Commedia_dell'arte","Pantalone","Montgomery_Ward","Portland,_Oregon","Oregon","Northwest_Industrial,_Portland,_Oregon","There's_No_Disgrace_Like_Home","Mike_Reiss","Waylon_Smithers","Simpson_and_Delilah","Lionel_Barrymore","Ronald_Reagan","Christopher_Collins","Homer's_Odyssey_(The_Simpsons)","Harry_Shearer","Lionel_Barrymore","Ronald_Reagan","Waylon_Smithers","Blood_Feud_(The_Simpsons)","Primetime_Emmy_Award_for_Outstanding_Voice-Over_Performance","61st_Primetime_Emmy_Awards","The_Burns_and_the_Bees","Dan_Castellaneta","Waylon_Smithers","Last_Exit_to_Springfield","Rosebud_(The_Simpsons)","Who_Shot_Mr._Burns?","Challenger,_Gray_&_Christmas","New_York_City","New_York_City_mayoral_election,_2009","Michael_Bloomberg","Shepard_Fairey","Barack_Obama_\"Hope\"_poster","Mitt_Romney"]}
