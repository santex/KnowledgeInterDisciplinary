However,\nwith industrialisation as well as the invention of the skyscraper, governmental\nzoning regulations were introduced to separate different functions, such as\nmanufacturing, from residential areas. In the United States, the heyday of separate-\nuse zoning in the U.S. was after World War II, but since the 1990s, mixed-use\nzoning has once again become desirable as the benefits are recognized.
