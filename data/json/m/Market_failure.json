{"cursor":"23853","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Market failure' is a concept within economic theory describing when the\nallocation of goods and services by a free market is not efficient. That is,\nthere exists another conceivable outcome where a market participant may be made\nbetter-off without making someone else worse-off. (The outcome is not Pareto\noptimal.) Market failures can be viewed as scenarios where individuals' pursuit\nof pure self-interest leads to results that are not efficient â that can be\nimproved upon from the societal point-of-view.

However, some types of government policy\n  | interventions, such as taxes, subsidies, bailouts, wage and price controls,\n  | and regulations, including attempts to correct market failure, may also lead\n  | to an inefficient allocation of resources, sometimes called government\n  | failure. {{cite book last = Weimer first = David\n  | coauthors = Aidan R.
