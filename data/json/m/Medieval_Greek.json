The latter date marked\nthe end of the Middle Ages in Southeast Europe. From the 7th century onwards,\nGreek was the only language of administration and government in the Byzantine\nEmpire. This former stage of language is thus described as Byzantine Greek. The\nstudy of the Medieval Greek language and literature is a branch of Byzantine\nStudies, or Byzantinology, the study of the history and culture of the\nByzantine Empire.\n\nThe beginning of Medieval Greek is occasionally dated back to as early as the\n4th century, either to 330 AD, when the political centre of the monarchy was\nmoved to Constantinople, or to 395 AD, the division of the Empire. However, this\napproach is rather arbitrary as it is more an assumption of political as opposed\nto cultural and linguistic developments. It is only after the Eastern Roman-\nByzantine culture was subjected to such massive change in the 7th century that a\nturning point in language development can be assumed. Medieval Greek is the link\nbetween the ancient and modern forms of the language because on the one hand,\nits literature is still strongly influenced by Ancient Greek, while on the other\nhand, many linguistic features of Modern Greek were already taking shape in the\nspoken language.\n","linknr":511,"url":"Medieval_Greek","recorded":1362903280,"links":33,"instances":["grammar","linguistics","linguistics","linguistics","grammar","phonetics","linguistics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Medieval Greek language|","Byzantine Empire"],"headings":["History and development","Phonetics and phonology","Grammar","Vocabulary, script, influence on other languages","Script","Influence on other languages","Research","See also","References","Sources","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/P46.jpg/180px-P46.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["morphology","linguistics"],["stress","linguistics"],["aspiration","phonetics"],["morphology","linguistics"],["contraction","grammar"],["augment","linguistics"],["perfect","grammar"],["genetic_relationship","linguistics"]],"members":["perfect","stress","genetic_relationship","augment","contraction","aspiration","morphology"],"related":["Mediterranean_Sea","Modern_Greek","Hellenic_languages","Proto-Greek_language","Ancient_Greek","Koine_Greek","Greek_alphabet","Greek_language","Middle_Ages","Fall_of_Constantinople","Europe","Byzantine_Empire","Byzantinology","Roman_Empire","Constantinople","Ancient_Greek","Modern_Greek","Roman_Empire","Latin","Corpus_Iuris_Civilis","Heraclius","Western_Roman_Empire","Heraclius","Alexandria","Great_Seljuq_Empire","Ottoman_Turks","Hellenistic_period","Diglossia","Attic_Greek","Koiné_Greek","Bible","Atticism","Modern_Greek","Chronicle","Historiography","Hagiography","Byzantine_Empire","Theophanes_the_Confessor","Constantine_VII_Porphyrogenitus","Morphology_(linguistics)","Syntax","Acclamatio","Constantinople","Digenes_Akritas","Michael_Psellos","Alexios_I_Komnenos","Anna_Komnena","Aragonese_language","Peloponnese","Greek_language_question","Vulgar_Latin","Black_Sea","Pontic_Greek","Koine_Greek","Griko","Tsakonian_language","Cappadocian_Greek_language","Cypriot_Greek","Phonology","Modern_Greek","Stress_(linguistics)","Hellenistic_period","Diphthongs","Monophthongs","Front_vowel","Back_vowel","Iota","Eta","Ypsilon","Epsilon","Omikron","Omega","Alpha","Suda","Alphabetically","Homophones","Apheresis","Synizesis","Consonant","Voiced","Plosives","Aspiration_(phonetics)","Voiceless","Fricatives","Late_Antiquity","Katharevousa","Velar","Palatal","Allophone","Rough_breathing","Consonant_clusters","Sandhi","Plosives","Fricatives","Dissimilation","Phonotactics","Modern_Greek","Mystras","Voicing","Plosives","Nasal_sound","Turkish_language","Dervish","Inflection","Indo-European","Morphology_(linguistics)","Declension","Nominative","Genitive","Comparative","Suffix","Enclitic","Personal_pronoun","Demonstrative_pronoun","Grammatical_particle","Contraction_(grammar)","Augment_(linguistics)","Reduplication","Perfect_(grammar)","Word_stem","Grammatical_aspect","Dative_case","Genitive_case","Accusative_case","Optative","Genitive_absolute","Accusative_and_infinitive","Gerund","Infinitive","Dependent_clause","Grammatical_particle","Dialect","Bulgarian_language","Romanian_language","Greek_language","Genetic_relationship_(linguistics)","Byzantine_Empire","Latin","Modern_Greek","Loanword","Bazaar","Greek_minuscule","Syria","Iota_subscript","Sigma","Orthodox_Church","Saints_Cyril_and_Methodius","Saints_Cyril_and_Methodius","Slavic_languages","Old_Church_Slavonic","Church_Slavonic","Bulgarian_language","Russian_language","Ukrainian_language","Serbian_language","Neologisms","Differences_between_standard_Bosnian,_Croatian_and_Serbian","Gothic_language","Pentecost","Spyridon_Lambros","Byzantine_studies","Ancient_Greek","Eastern_Roman_Empire","Humanism","Iotacism","Charles_du_Fresne,_sieur_du_Cange","Philhellenism","Byzantinology","Ludwig_Maximilian_University_of_Munich","Paris","Acritic_songs","Bridge_of_Arta","Byzantine_literature","Chatalar_Inscription","Frankokratia","Medieval_Greece","Omurtag's_Tarnovo_Inscription","The_Dead_Brother's_Song","Timarion"]}
