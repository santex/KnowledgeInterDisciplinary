{"cursor":"6639","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":":For other uses of multiplex, see [[multiplex (disambiguation)]].\n\nA 'multiplex assay' is a type of assay that simultaneously measures multiple\nanalytes (dozens or more) in a single run/cycle of the assay. It is\ndistinguished from procedures that measure one analyte at a time. Multiplex\nassays within a given application area or class of technology can be further\nstratified based on how many analytes can be measured per assay, where\n\"multiplex\" refers to those with the highest number of analyte measurements per\nassay (up to millions) and \"low-plex\" or \"mid-plex\" refers to procedures that\nprocess fewer (10s to 1000s), though there are no formal guidelines for calling\na procedure multi-, mid-, or low-plex based on number of analytes measured. Single-\nanalyte assays or low-to-mid-plex procedures typically predate the rise of their\nmultiplex versions, which often require specialized technologies or\nminiaturization to achieve a higher degree of parallelization.\n\nMultiplex assays are widely used in functional genomics experiments that\nendeavor to detect or to assay the state of all biomolecules of a given class\n(e.g., mRNAs, proteins) within a biological sample, to determine the effect of\nan experimental treatment or the effect of a DNA mutation over all of the\nbiomolecules or pathways in the sample. The ability to perform such multiplex\nassay experiments measuring large numbers of biomolecular analytes has been\nfacilitated by the completion of the human genome sequence and that of many\nother model organisms.\n","linknr":138,"url":"Multiplex_assay","recorded":1362481268,"links":12,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.licor.com./bio/QuantitativeWesterns/pdf/bt0609_LI-COR_final.pdf"],"categories":["Laboratory techniques"],"headings":["\"Multiplex\" versus \"High-throughput\"","Example multiplex assay techniques","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Assay","Analyte","Assay","Functional_genomics","Biomolecule","MRNA","Protein","Biological_specimen","Mutation","Metabolic_pathway","Human_Genome_Project","Model_organism","High-throughput_screening","Gene_expression","Genome","Biological_specimen","Automation","DNA_microarray","Gene_expression","Single_nucleotide_polymorphism","Serial_analysis_of_gene_expression","Multiplex_PCR","DNA","RNA","Multiplex_Ligation-dependent_Probe_Amplification","Sequencing_by_ligation","Luminex","XMAP","Protein_microarray","Antibody_microarray","Antibodies","Phage_display","Luminex","XMAP","Panel_reactive_antibody","PRA","Tissue_microarray","Cellular_microarray","Chemical_compound_microarray","Biomarker","ELISA","Microtiter_plate"]}
