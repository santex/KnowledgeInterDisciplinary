{"cursor":"12640","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n in a mechanical oscillatory system]]\n\n'Mechanical resonance' is the tendency of a mechanical system to respond at\ngreater amplitude when the frequency of its oscillations matches the\nsystem's natural frequency of vibration (its [[resonance frequency]] or\nresonant frequency) than it does at other frequencies. It may cause violent\nswaying motions and even catastrophic failure in improperly constructed\nstructures including bridges, buildings and airplanesâa phenomenon known as\nresonance disaster.\n\nAvoiding resonance disasters is a major concern in every building, tower and\nbridge construction project. The Taipei 101 building relies on a 660-ton\npendulum â a tuned mass damper â to modify the response at resonance.\nFurthermore, the structure is designed to resonate at a frequency which does not\ntypically occur. Buildings in seismic zones are often constructed to take into\naccount the oscillating frequencies of expected ground motion. In addition,\nengineers designing objects having engines must ensure that the mechanical\nresonant frequencies of the component parts do not match driving vibrational\nfrequencies of the motors or other strongly oscillating parts.\n\nMany resonant objects have more than one resonance frequency. It will vibrate\neasily at those frequencies, and less so at other frequencies. Many clocks keep\ntime by mechanical resonance in a balance wheel, pendulum, or quartz crystal.\n","linknr":236,"url":"Mechanical_resonance","recorded":1362485924,"links":21,"instances":["technology","1940","seat","device","physics"],"pdf":["http://www.physics.rutgers.edu/~jackph/2005s/PS02.pdf","http://www.ketchum.org/billah/Billah-Scanlan.pdf","http://www.physics.rutgers.edu/ugrad/301/PS02.pdf"],"categories":["Mechanical vibrations","Earthquake engineering"],"headings":["Description","Examples","Resonance disaster","Applications","Earthquake machine","See also","Notes","Further reading","Patents","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/07/Resonance.PNG/220px-Resonance.PNG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/1/0/5/105cc62a0c8f80698597a88384e91d8e.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/1/6/0/1601e81679e679674d5ae18ee9b4c085.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/Display_01.jpg/220px-Display_01.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/dc/TeslaOscillator.png/220px-TeslaOscillator.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["bob","physics"],["swing","seat"],["mythbusters","2004_season#breakstep_bridge"],["spring","device"],["tacoma_narrows_bridge","1940"],["millennium_bridge","london#resonance"],["the_power","snap!_song#tremors_at_techno-mart"],["mechanism","technology"],["mythbusters","2006_season#episode_60_.e2.80.93_.22earthquake_machine.22"]],"members":["mechanism","tacoma_narrows_bridge","mythbusters","the_power","millennium_bridge","swing","spring","bob"],"related":["Mechanics","Frequency","Vibration","Construction","Taipei_101","Pendulum","Tuned_mass_damper","Seismic","Engineer","Clock","Balance_wheel","Pendulum","Quartz_clock","Mass","Spring_constant","Swing_set","Standard_gravity","Earth","Elliptic_integral","Mass","Kinetic_energy","Potential_energy","Gravity","Bob_(physics)","Subharmonic","Musical_instruments","Acoustic_resonance","Clock","Balance_wheel","Pendulum","Quartz_clock","Tidal_resonance","Bay_of_Fundy","Orbital_resonance","Natural_satellite","Solar_system","Gas_giants","Basilar_membrane","Ear","Swing_(seat)","London_Millennium_Footbridge","Angers_Bridge","Lockstep_marching","Spring_(device)","Atom","Resonance","Oscillate","System","Energy","Tacoma_Narrows_Bridge_(1940)","Robert_H._Scanlan","American_Journal_of_Physics","Broughton_Suspension_Bridge","Angers_Bridge","Königs_Wusterhausen_Central_Tower","Tae_Bo","United_States_Patent_Office","Resonance","Frequency","Amplitude","Measuring","Experiment","Mechanism_(technology)","Frequency","Amplitude","Frequency_range","Nodal_point","Wave_length","Standing_wave","Nikola_Tesla","Houston_Street","Mythbusters","Resonator","Reed_switch","Transducer","Electrical_resonance","Laser_applications","Dunkerley's_Method","String_resonance"]}
