{"cursor":"16166","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nA 'market economy' is an economy in which decisions regarding investment,\nproduction and distribution are based on supply and demand, and\nprices of goods and services are determined in a free price system.\nThe major defining characteristic of a market economy is that decisions\nregarding investments and the allocation of producer goods is accomplished\nprimarily through markets. This is contrasted with a planned economy,\nwhere investment and production decisions are embodied in a plan of production.\n\nMarket economies can range from hypothetical laissez-faire and free market\nvariants to regulated markets and interventionist variants. In reality market\neconomies do not exist in pure form, since societies and governments regulate\nthem to varying degrees. Tucker, Irvin B. p 491. Macroeconomics\nfor Today. West Publishing. p. 491 Most existing market economies include\na degree of economic planning or state-directed activity, and are thus\nclassified as mixed economies. The term [[free-market]] economy is sometimes\nused synonymously with market economy, but it may also refer to laissez-faire or\nFree-market anarchism. [http://unabridged.merriam-webster.com/cgi-\nbin/unabridged?va=market%20economy \"market economy\"], Merriam-Webster Unabridged\nDictionary\n\nMarket economies do not logically presuppose the existence of private property\nin the means of production; a market economy can consist of various types of\ncooperatives, collectives or autonomous state agencies that buy and sell capital\ngoods with each other in a free price system. There are many\nvariations of market socialism that involve employee-owned enterprises based on\nself-management that operate in markets, as well as models that involve public\nownership of the means of production where capital goods are distributed through\nmarkets.\n\nThe term market economy used by itself can be somewhat misleading. For example,\nthe United States constitutes a mixed economy (substantial market regulation,\nagricultural subsidies, extensive government-funded research and development,\nMedicare/Medicaid), yet at the same time it is foundationally rooted in a market\neconomy. Different perspectives exist as to how strong a role the government\nshould have in both guiding the market economy and addressing the inequalities\nthe market produces.\n","linknr":622,"url":"Market_economy","recorded":1362483609,"links":68,"instances":["economic_theory","economics","economics","professor","united_states","economics","economics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Capitalism","Economic systems","Economic ideologies","Economic liberalism","Economies","Economics terminology"],"headings":["Capitalism","Market socialism","Early market economies","Criticisms","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Emblem-money.svg/16px-Emblem-money.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/85/Economic_template.svg/50px-Economic_template.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg/16px-Portal-puzzle.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg/16px-Portal-puzzle.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg/16px-Portal-puzzle.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg/16px-Portal-puzzle.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c5/Red_flag_waving.svg/100px-Red_flag_waving.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c5/Red_flag_waving.svg/15px-Red_flag_waving.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg/20px-Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["production","economics"],["distribution","economics"],["good","economics"],["service","economics"],["medicare","united_states"],["mutualism","economic_theory"],["mutualism","economic_theory"],["david_mcnally","professor"]],"members":["mutualism","good","production","david_mcnally","medicare","service","distribution"],"related":["Investment","Production_(economics)","Distribution_(economics)","Supply_and_demand","Good_(economics)","Service_(economics)","Free_price_system","Planned_economy","Laissez-faire","Free_market","Regulated_markets","Economic_interventionism","Economic_planning","Mixed_economy","Free-market_anarchism","Merriam-Webster","Means_of_production","Market_socialism","Worker_cooperative","Self-management","Means_of_production","Regulation","Agricultural_subsidy","Research_and_development","Medicare_(United_States)","Medicaid","Means_of_production","Capital_accumulation","Laissez-faire","Free_market","Economic_interventionism","Market_failure","State_capitalist","Indicative_planning","State_enterprise","Feudalism","Economy_of_the_United_States","Nordic_model","Financial_markets","Welfare_state","Collective_bargaining","Classical_liberal","Right-libertarianism","Coercive_monopoly","Anarcho-capitalism","Illegitimate","Alfred_Müller-Armack","Ludwig_Erhard","World_War_II","West_Germany","Market_failure","Regulation","Competition_policy","Contractionary_monetary_policy","Neoliberalism","Ordoliberalism","Duden","Public_ownership","Cooperative","Classical_economics","Adam_Smith","Ricardian_socialism","Mutualism_(economic_theory)","Social_dividend","Oskar_Lange","Lange_model","Marginal_cost","Perfect_competition","Pareto_optimality","John_Roemer","Economic_democracy","Social_ownership","Basic_income","Libertarian_socialists","Mutualism_(economic_theory)","Anarchists","Branko_Horvat","Jaroslav_Vanek","People's_Republic_of_China","Socialist_market_economy","Socialist-oriented_market_economy","Vietnam","Đổi_Mới","State_capitalism","Robin_Hahnel","Michael_Albert","Balanced_job_complex","David_McNally_(professor)","Adam_Smith","Wage_labor","Controlled_market","Economic_freedom","Free_market","Grey_market","Market_socialism","Mixed_economy","Planned_economy","Regulated_market","Social_market_economy","Socialist_market_economy"]}
