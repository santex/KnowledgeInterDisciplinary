His\nyounger brother Charles was instrumental in writing much of the hymnody of the\nMethodist Church. George Whitefield,\nanother significant leader in the movement, was known for his unorthodox\nministry of itinerant open-air preaching. Arnold Dallimore. George\nWhitefield: The Life and Times of the Great Evangelist of the Eighteenth-Century\nRevival. Carlisle, Pennsylvania: Banner of Truth Trust, 1980. The\nMethodist Church is known for its missionary work, and its establishment of hospitals, universities, orphanages, soup\nkitchens, and schools to follow Jesus' command to spread the Good News and serve\nall people.\n\nWesley, along with his brother, founded the Holy Club while they were at Oxford,\nwhere John was a fellow and later a lecturer at Lincoln College. The Holy Club met weekly and they\nsystematically set about living a holy life. They were branded as \"Methodist\" by\nstudents at Oxford who derided the methodical way they ordered their lives.\nWesley took the attempted mockery and turned it into a title of honour.\nInitially Whitefield and the Wesleys merely sought reform, by way of a return to\nthe gospel, within the Church of England, but the movement spread with revival\nand soon a significant number of Anglican clergy became known as 'Methodists' in\nthe mid-18th century. [http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity-\n/subdivisions/methodist_1.shtml/ BBC History] The movement did not form a\nseparate denomination in England until after John Wesley's death in 1791.\nAlthough Wesley and the majority of his followers were decidedly Arminian in\ntheir theological outlook, George Whitefield, Howell Harris, Richard\nBennett, \"Howell Harris and the Dawn of Revival\", (1909, Eng. tr. 1962), ISBN\n1-85049-035-X and Selina Hastings, Countess of Huntingdon were notable for\nbeing Calvinistic Methodists, and the Presbyterian Church of Wales originated\nfrom the preaching of Harris and Whitfield.\n\nThe influence of Whitefield and Lady Huntingdon on the Church of England was a\nfactor in the founding of the Free Church of England in 1844. Through vigorous\nmissionary activity Methodism spread throughout the British Empire and, mostly\nthrough Whitefield's preaching during what historians call the First Great\nAwakening, in colonial America. After Whitefield's death in 1770, however,\nAmerican Methodism entered a more lasting Wesleyan and Arminian phase of\ndevelopment.\n\nEarly Methodists were drawn from all levels of society, including the\naristocracy, but the Methodist preachers took the message to labourers and\ncriminals who tended to be left outside organized religion at that\ntime. Wesley himself thought it wrong to preach outside a church\nbuilding until persuaded otherwise by Whitefield. John Wesley, Journal 31\nMarch 1739\n\nDoctrinally, the branches of Methodism following the Wesleys are Arminian, while\nthose following Harris and Whitefield are Calvinistic. Wesley maintained the\nArminian doctrines that were dominant in the 18th-century Church of England,\nwhile Whitefield adopted Calvinism through his contacts with Calvinists in\nScotland and New England. This caused serious strains on the relationship\nbetween Whitefield and Wesley, with Wesley becoming quite hostile toward\nWhitefield in what had been previously very close relations. Whitefield\nconsistently begged Wesley not to let these differences sever their friendship\nand, in time their friendship was restored, though this was seen by many of\nWhitefield's followers to be a doctrinal compromise. Dallimore. George Whitefield. As a final testimony of their\nfriendship, John Wesley's sermon on Whitefield's death is full of praise and\naffection. Wesley, \"Sermons on Several Occasions\",\n[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/wesley/sermons.v.liii.html No. 53]\n\nMethodism has a wide variety of forms of worship, ranging from high church to\nlow church in liturgical usage. Both Whitefield and the Wesleys themselves\ngreatly valued the Anglican liturgy and tradition, and the Methodist worship in\nThe Book of Offices was based on the 1662 Book of Common Prayer. \"The
