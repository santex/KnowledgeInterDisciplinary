He\nhas written six influential books and conducts research with Warwick Business\nSchool (Young, 2008). He is a fellow of the RSA. He served on the Advisory Board\nfor the Rollins Center for eBusiness. He earned his Masters in Business\nAdministration and Ph.D. from the Warwick Business School under the supervision\nof Professor David Wilson and Professor Sotirios Paroutis, who was in turn\nsupervised by Andrew Pettigrew.\n\nMcKeown is an advocate of innovation culture. He also argues that failure can be\npositive for progress if it is viewed as part of learning (Chynoweth, 2010). He\nmakes a distinction between change and progress, \"change is inevitable but\nprogress is not\" (McKeown, 2008). His work described how 'creativity doesn't\ncome from hiring the right people, but from creating the right conditions'\n(Buchanan & Huczynski, 2013, Mckeown, 2008). He also argues that \"reacting\nmatters as much as planning\" and that strategy is effective only when it shapes\nevents in the real world (McKeown, 2011).\n\nIn Adaptability, a contribution to innovation literature he sets out four levels\nof adaptation that social groups can achieve. Collapsing is the end of the\nsocial group. Coping is survival 'without prosperity, pride or joy'. Thriving\nprovides benefits that are worthwhile and desirable. The final level,\nTranscending overcomes the limits of the old system, allowing more for everyone.\nThe three step model of Adaptability (RUN) involves (1) Recognition of required\nadaptation (2) Understanding of adaptation required (3) Necessary adaptation. He\ndescribes High Adaptability (Killer) Cultures - or HACKs - as supportive of self-\nrenewal that nurture and develop the talent of what he refers to as High\nAdaptability, High Achievement individuals - or HAHAs - who learn to become\nstronger when faced with adversity as compared to Low Adaptability, Low\nAchievement individuals - or LALAs - who become increasingly inflexible when put\nunder pressure (Mckeown, 2013).\n\nSocial groups, and individuals, attempt adaptation following three steps:\nFirst, recognition of the need to adapt. Second, understanding of the\nnecessary adaptation. And third, adapting as necessary. In most societies\nthere is a mix of different systems at different levels of adaptation fit.\nMany efforts to reach higher levels of adaptation fail because one or more of\nthe steps is not completely successfully. People may fail to understand change\nis necessary, or not understand what kind of change is necessary, or simply\navoid making those changes.\n\nIn The Strategy Book, one of the winners at the Chartered Institute of\nManagement's Book of the Year Awards 2013 (Atherton, 2013), argues that\n\"strategy is about shaping the future\" (Mckeown, 2011) and approaches strategy\nas something that people do, both as style of thinking and the combination of\nactions taken along with their consequences. He describes how individuals, and\ngroups, can increase their ability to think and act strategically, by finding\nthe best route to desirable ends with available means. He wrote the book to help\nreal people use strategy partly in response to a call to action from Richard\nWhittington, writing about school of strategic management research known as Strategy-In-\nPractice (Whittington, 2002). In 2013, Japanese and Portuguese translations will\nbe published.\n","linknr":98,"url":"Max_McKeown","recorded":1374863115,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Max_McKeown&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Max_McKeown&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Max_In_Jacket.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/Max_In_Jacket.jpg/220px-Max_In_Jacket.jpg","/wiki/London,_England","/wiki/United_Kingdom","/wiki/Management_consultant","/wiki/Writer","/wiki/London","/wiki/England","/wiki/Writer","/wiki/Consultant","/wiki/Researcher","/wiki/Innovation","/wiki/Warwick_Business_School","/wiki/Royal_Society_of_Arts","/wiki/Warwick_Business_School","/wiki/Andrew_Pettigrew","/wiki/Richard_Whittington","/w/index.php?title=Max_McKeown&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Max_McKeown&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/56113109","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","/wiki/London,_England","/wiki/United_Kingdom","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Max_McKeown&oldid=548543696","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:English_writers","/wiki/Category:Living_people","/wiki/Category:1969_births","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_hCards","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Max+McKeown&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Max+McKeown","/wiki/Max_McKeown","/wiki/Talk:Max_McKeown","#","/wiki/Max_McKeown","/w/index.php?title=Max_McKeown&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Max_McKeown&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Max_McKeown","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Max_McKeown","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Max_McKeown&oldid=548543696","/w/index.php?title=Max_McKeown&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6795005","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Max_McKeown&id=548543696","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Max+McKeown","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Max+McKeown&oldid=548543696&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Max_McKeown&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6795005#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_McKeown","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["English
