Merriam-Webster Dictionary A meme acts\nas a unit for carrying cultural ideas, symbols or practices, which can be\ntransmitted from one mind to another through writing, speech, gestures, rituals\nor other imitable phenomena. Supporters of the concept regard memes as cultural\nanalogues to genes in that they self-replicate, mutate and respond to selective\npressures.\n\nThe word meme is a shortening (modeled on gene) of mimeme (from Ancient Greek\nÎ¼Î¯Î¼Î·Î¼Î± mÄ«mÄma, \"imitated thing\", from Î¼Î¹Î¼Îµá¿ÏÎ¸Î±Î¹ mimeisthai, \"to imitate\", from\nÎ¼á¿Î¼Î¿Ï mimos \"mime\") The American Heritage Dictionary of the English\nLanguage: Fourth Edition, 2000 and it was coined by the British\nevolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins in [[The Selfish Gene]] (1976) ; [http://books.google.com/books?id=YphlBwpbJCUC&pg=PA16\nVarieties of meaning] \"Richard Dawkins invented the term 'memes' to stand for\nitems that are reproduced by imitation rather than reproduced\ngenetically.\" as a concept for discussion of evolutionary principles in\nexplaining the spread of ideas and cultural phenomena. Examples of memes given\nin the book included melodies, catch-phrases, fashion and the technology of\nbuilding arches.\n\nProponents theorize that memes may evolve by natural selection in a manner\nanalogous to that of biological evolution. Memes do this through the processes\nof variation, mutation, competition and inheritance, each of which influence a\nmeme's reproductive success. Memes spread through the behavior that they\ngenerate in their hosts. Memes that propagate less prolifically may become\nextinct, while others may survive, spread and (for better or for worse) mutate.\nMemes that replicate most effectively enjoy more success, and some may replicate\neffectively even when they prove to be detrimental to the welfare of their\nhosts. :\"But if we consider culture as its own self organizing\nsystem,âa system with its own agenda and pressure to surviveâthen the history of\nhumanity gets even more interesting. As Richard Dawkins has shown, systems of\nself-replicating ideas or memes can quickly accumulate their own agenda and\nbehaviours. I assign no higher motive to a cultural entity than the primitive\ndrive to reproduce itself and modify its environment to aid its spread. One way\nthe self organizing system can do this is by consuming human biological\nresources.\"\n\nA field of study called memetics arose in the 1990s to explore the\nconcepts and transmission of memes in terms of an evolutionary model. Criticism\nfrom a variety of fronts has challenged the notion that academic study can\nexamine memes empirically. However, developments in neuroimaging may make\nempirical study possible. Some commentators in the\nsocial sciences question the idea that one can meaningfully categorize culture\nin terms of discrete units, and are especially critical of the biological nature\nof the theory's underpinnings GILL, Jameson (2011).
