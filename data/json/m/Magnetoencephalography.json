Arrays of\nSQUIDs (superconducting quantum interference devices) are currently the most\ncommon magnetometer, and SERF being investigated for future machines.\nApplications of MEG include basic research into perceptual and cognitive brain\nprocesses, localizing regions affected by pathology before surgical removal,\ndetermining the function of various parts of the brain, and neurofeedback.\n","linknr":502,"url":"Magnetoencephalography","recorded":1362508953,"links":31,"instances":["neuroanatomy","sense","physicist","unit"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Electrodiagnosis","Magnetoencephalography|","Medical tests","Neurotechnology"],"headings":["History of MEG","The basis of the MEG signal","Magnetic shielding","Source localization","MEG use in the field","Comparison with related techniques","See also","Further reading","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e6/NIMH_MEG.jpg/220px-NIMH_MEG.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/Magnetoencephalography.png/250px-Magnetoencephalography.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/24/MSR_layered_door.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["david_cohen","physicist"],["tesla","unit"],["sulcus","neuroanatomy"],["hearing","sense"]],"members":["sulcus","hearing","david_cohen","tesla"],"related":["Magnetic_field","Human_brain","Magnetometer","SQUID","SERF","Neurofeedback","David_Cohen_(physicist)","SQUID","James_Edward_Zimmerman","Electroencephalography","Vacuum_flask","Neural_synchronization","Femto","Tesla_(unit)","Cerebral_cortex","Dendrite","Synapse","Maxwell's_equations","Dipole","Right-hand_rule","Pyramidal_cell","Sulcus_(neuroanatomy)","Signal_processing","Action_potentials","Earth's_magnetic_field","Magnetic_shielding","Aluminium","Mu-metal","Signal_noise","Ferromagnetism","Permalloy","Radio_frequency","Alternating_current","Eddy-current","Athinoula_A._Martinos_Center_for_Biomedical_Imaging","Magnetometer","Direct_current","Noise_floor","Expectation-maximization_algorithm","Magnetic_resonance_imaging","Fiduciary_marker","Coregistration","Multiple_signal_classification","MSST_Multiple_Dipole","Independent_component_analysis","Functional_magnetic_resonance_imaging","Hemodynamics","Multiple_sclerosis","Alzheimer's_disease","Schizophrenia","Sj√∂gren's_syndrome","Chronic_alcoholism","Facial_pain","Epilepsy","Eloquent_cortex","Brain_tumor","Primary_motor_cortex","Primary_sensory_cortex","Visual_cortex","ECoG","Visual_perception","Hearing_(sense)","Language_processing","Spatial_resolution","Temporal_resolution","Millisecond","Electroencephalography","Positron_emission_tomography","Ferromagnetic","Implant","Positron_emission_tomography","Electroencephalography","Electrophysiology","Evoked_field","Auditory_evoked_field","Functional_neuroimaging","Magnetocardiography","Magnetogastrography","Magnetomyography","Magnetometer","Magnetic_source_imaging","Mu-metal","SQUID","Direct_brain_interfaces","Whole_brain_emulation","FieldTrip"]}
