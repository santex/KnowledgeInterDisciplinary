Born in Amsterdam, Beijerinck studied at the\nTechnical School of Delft, where he was awarded the degree of Chemical Engineer\nin 1872. He obtained his Doctor of Science degree from the University of Leiden\nin 1877. At the time, Delft, then a Polytechnic, did not have the\nright to confer doctorates, so Leiden did this for them. He became a teacher in\nmicrobiology at the Agricultural School in Wageningen (now Wageningen\nUniversity) and later at the Polytechnische Hogeschool Delft (Delft Polytechnic,\ncurrently Delft University of Technology) (from 1895). He established the Delft\nSchool of Microbiology. His studies of agricultural and industrial microbiology\nyielded fundamental discoveries in the field of biology. His achievements have\nbeen perhaps unfairly overshadowed by those of his contemporaries, Robert Koch\nand Louis Pasteur, because unlike them, Beijerinck never studied human disease.\n\nHe is considered one of the founders of\nvirology. In 1898, he published\nresults on the filtration experiments demonstrating that tobacco mosaic disease\nis caused by an infectious agent smaller than a bacterium. Translated into\nEnglish in Johnson, J., Ed. (1942) Phytopathological classics. (St. Paul,\nMinnesota: American Phytopathological Society) No. 7, pp. 33â-52 (St. Paul,\nMinnesota) His results were in accordance with the similar observation\nmade by Dmitri Ivanovsky in 1892. Translated into English in Johnson, J.,\nEd. (1942) Phytopathological classics (St. Paul, Minnesota: American\nPhytopathological Society) No. 7, pp. 27â-30. Like Ivanovsky before him\nand Adolf Mayer, predecessor at Wageningen, Beijerinck could not culture the\nfilterable infectious agent, however he concluded that the agent can replicate\nand multiply in living plants. He named the new pathogen [[virus]] to indicate\nits non-bacterial nature. Beijerinck asserted that the virus was somewhat liquid\nin nature, calling it \"contagium vivum fluidum\" (contagious living fluid). It\nwas not until the first crystals of the tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) obtained by\nWendell Stanley in 1935, the first electron micrographs of TMV produced in 1939\nand the first X-ray crystallographic analysis of TMV performed in 1941 proved\nthat the virus was particulate.\n\nBeijerinck also discovered nitrogen fixation, Beijerinck, M.W, 1901, Ãber\noligonitrophile Mikroben, Centralblatt fÃ¼r Bakteriologie, Parasitenkunde,\nInfektionskrankheiten und Hygiene, Abteilung II, Vol 7, pp. 561-582 the\nprocess by which diatomic nitrogen gas is converted to ammonium ions and becomes\navailable to plants. Bacteria perform nitrogen fixation, dwelling inside root\nnodules of certain plants (legumes). In addition to having discovered a\nbiochemial reaction vital to soil fertility and agriculture, Beijerinck revealed\nthis archetypical example of symbiosis between plants and bacteria.\n\nBeijerinck discovered the phenomenon of bacterial sulfate reduction, a form of\nanaerobic respiration. He learned bacteria could use sulfate as a terminal\nelectron acceptor, instead of oxygen. This discovery has had an important impact\non our current understanding of biogeochemical cycles. [[Spirillum|Spirillum\ndesulfuricans]], the first known sulfate-reducing bacterium, was isolated and\ndescribed by Beijerinck.\n\nBeijerinck invented the enrichment culture, a fundamental method of studying\nmicrobes from the environment. He is often incorrectly credited with framing the\nmicrobial ecology idea that \"everything is everywhere, but, the environment\nselects,\" which was stated by Lourens Baas Becking.\n\nBeijerinck was a socially eccentric figure. He was verbally abusive to students,\nnever married, and had few professional collaborations. He was also known for\nhis ascetic lifestyle and his view of science and marriage being incompatible.\nHis low popularity with his students periodically depressed him, as he very much\nloved spreading his enthusiasm for biology in the classroom.\n","linknr":232,"url":"Martinus_Beijerinck","recorded":1362505889,"links":39,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://asm.org/ccLibraryFiles/FILENAME/0000000251/621096p539.pdf","http://asm.org/ccLibraryFiles/FILENAME/0000000251/621096p539.pdf","http://www.apsnet.org/publications/apsnetfeatures/Documents/1998/ZaitlinDiscoveryCausalAgentTobaccoMosaicVirus.pdf","http://www.apsnet.org/publications/apsnetfeatures/Documents/1998/ZaitlinDiscoveryCausalAgentTobaccoMosaicVirus.pdf"],"categories":["1851 births","1931 deaths","Virologists","Dutch microbiologists","Dutch botanists","Dutch phytopathologists","Environmental microbiology","Nitrogen metabolism","People from Amsterdam","Delft University of Technology alumni","Leiden University alumni","Wageningen University faculty","Delft University of Technology faculty","Foreign Members of the Royal Society","Corresponding Members of the Russian Academy of Sciences (1917–1925)","Corresponding Members of the USSR Academy of Sciences","Honorary Members of the USSR Academy of Sciences","Leeuwenhoek Medal winners"],"headings":["See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/Mwb_in_lab.JPG/150px-Mwb_in_lab.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/Martinus_Beijerinck.png/170px-Martinus_Beijerinck.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1e/Former_Delft_School_of_Microbiology.jpg/220px-Former_Delft_School_of_Microbiology.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Amsterdam","Gorssel","Microbiology","Wageningen_University","Delft_School_of_Microbiology","Leiden_University","Nitrogen_cycle","Chemotroph","Virology","Sulfate-reducing_bacteria","Microbiological_culture","Sergei_Winogradsky","Leeuwenhoek_Medal","Microbiologist","Botanist","Amsterdam","Wageningen_University","Delft","Delft_University_of_Technology","Delft_School_of_Microbiology","Biology","Robert_Koch","Louis_Pasteur","Virology","Tobacco_mosaic_disease","Bacterium","Dmitri_Ivanovsky","Adolf_Mayer","Pathogen","Contagium_vivum_fluidum","Tobacco_mosaic_virus","Wendell_Stanley","Nitrogen_fixation","Nitrogen","Ammonium","Root_nodules","Legume","Soil","Agriculture","Symbiosis","Plants","Bacteria","Sulfate-reducing_bacteria","Anaerobic_respiration","Biogeochemical_cycles","Enrichment_culture","Microbe","Lourens_Baas_Becking","Ascetic","Marriage","Nitrification","Nitrogen_cycle","Sergei_Winogradsky","Amsterdam","Gorssel"]}
