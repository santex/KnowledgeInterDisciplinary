Copies are automatically created in other network elements, such as\nrouters, but only when the topology of the network requires it.\n\nMulticast is most commonly implemented in IP multicast, which is often employed\nin Internet Protocol (IP) applications of streaming media and Internet\ntelevision. In IP multicast the implementation of the multicast concept occurs\nat the IP routing level, where routers create optimal distribution paths for\ndatagrams sent to a multicast destination address.\n\nAt the Data Link Layer, multicast describes one-to-many distribution such as\nEthernet multicast addressing, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) point-to-\nmultipoint virtual circuits (P2MP) or Infiniband multicast.\n","title":"multicast","headings":["IP multicast","Other multicast technologies","See also","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["3: IPTV","2: IP_multicast","2: Streaming_media","2: Spanning_tree_protocol","2: Overlay_network","2: Xcast","2: Free_software","1: Computer_networking","1: Information","1: Internet_Protocol","1: Datagram","1: Data_Link_Layer","1: Multicast_address#Ethernet","1: Asynchronous_Transfer_Mode","1: Infiniband","1: Point-to-multipoint_communication","1: Transport_layer","1: User_Datagram_Protocol","1: Reliable_multicast","1: Pragmatic_General_Multicast","1: Stock_exchange","1: Presence_information","1: Internet_Relay_Chat","1: Peer-to-peer","1: Peercasting","1: Optical_mesh_network","1: Multicast_lightpaths","1: Ad_hoc_routing_protocol_list","1: Anycast","1: Broadcast_address","1: CastGate","1: Comparison_of_streaming_media_systems","1: Comparison_of_video_services","1: Content_delivery_network","1: Flooding_algorithm","1: Grid_casting","1: IGMP","1: IP_speaker","1: Internet_television","1: List_of_music_streaming_services","1: List_of_streaming_media_systems","1: Multicast_address","1: NBMA","1: Packet_forwarding","1: P2PTV","1: Protection_of_Broadcasts_and_Broadcasting_Organizations_Treaty","1: Push_technology","1: Session_Announcement_Protocol","1: Unicast","1: VideoLAN","1: Application_software","1: Web_television","1: Webcast","1: Protocol_Independent_Multicast"]}
