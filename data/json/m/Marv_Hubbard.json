Originally from Randolph, New York, Hubbard attended Colgate\nUniversity in Hamilton, New York. He played for the Hartford Knights of the\nAtlantic Coast Football League. He then joined the American Football League's\nOakland Raiders in 1969, staying with the team until 1975, and then came back\nwith the Detroit Lions in 1977.\n\nA fullback wearing jersey #44, Hubbard was famous for his punishing mano-a-mano\nduels with Kansas City Chiefs linebacker Willie Lanier. He was not a shifty\nback, and did not evade contact. Powerfully built, he was famous for crashing\nheadlong into defenders, with little regard for his own well-being.\n\nThough never a star, Hubbard in his prime was an unusually productive player.\nOf note was his extremely high per-carry average. Over the course of their\ncareers, most of the best running backs average a little over 4 yards per\ncarry. Some of the best backs approach the 4.5 range. Only a few (Hall of\nFamers Jim Brown, Gale Sayers, Barry Sanders, OJ Simpson among them) actually\nexceed 4.5. Marv Hubbard averaged closer to five yards (4.82 to be exact) per\ncarry. The most obvious explanation for this slightly above average fullback\nhaving such a high career average, is the great offensive lines he ran behind.\nEarly in his career he had Bob Brown, Art Shell, Gene Upshaw and Jim Otto\nblocking for him, all Hall of Fame offensive lineman. Later in Hubbard's career\nBob Brown and Jim Otto retired, they were replaced by John Vella and Dave Dalby\nrespectively. The sports writers perhaps didn't give him the respect he\ndeserved as he was never nominated for an \"All-Pro\" team, but the players and\ncoaches in the NFL respected him and he did earn three trips to Pro Bowl as the\nbackup Fullback for the AFC.\n\nHowever Hubbard's career did not start impressively. After being drafted in the\neleventh round of the 1968 AFL Draft by Oakland, he was cut. He then went to the\nCanadian Football League, where he spent two seasons learning how to block. But\nafter returning to the Raiders, he teamed in the backfield with halfback Charlie\nSmith, and became a potent weapon, especially in short-yardage situations. He\nmade the AFC All-Star team with the Raiders in 1971, 1972, and 1973. His\nroughhouse style of play eventually caught up with Hubbard, resulting in a\nnagging shoulder injury that forced him to miss most of the season in 1975. He\nspent the entire 1976 season on the injured reserve list and was eclipsed during\nhis injury by his groomed replacement, fellow Colgate alum Mark van Eeghen. He\nsigned with the Detroit Lions, where he saw spot duty during the 1977 season,\nafter which he retired from the NFL.\n","linknr":134,"url":"Marv_Hubbard","recorded":1375056777,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Marvin_Hubbard&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Marvin_Hubbard&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","/wiki/Marvin_Hubbard","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","/w/index.php?title=Marv_Hubbard&redirect=no","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Salamanca,_New_York","/wiki/American_football_positions","/wiki/Running_Back","/wiki/College_football","/wiki/Colgate_University","/wiki/American_Football_League_Draft","/wiki/1968_American_Football_League_Draft#Round_11_.2F_Pick_277","/wiki/Pro_Bowl","http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/HubbMa00.htm","http://www.databasefootball.com/players/playerpage.htm?ilkid=HUBBAMAR01","/wiki/Atlantic_Coast_Football_League","/w/index.php?title=Hartford_Knights&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/American_Football_League","/wiki/Oakland_Raiders","/wiki/Detroit_Lions","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/American_football","/wiki/Randolph,_New_York","/wiki/Colgate_University","/wiki/Hamilton_(village),_New_York","/w/index.php?title=Hartford_Knights&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Atlantic_Coast_Football_League","/wiki/American_Football_League","/wiki/Oakland_Raiders","/wiki/Detroit_Lions","/wiki/Fullback_(American_football)","/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs","/wiki/Willie_Lanier","/wiki/Jim_Brown","/wiki/Gale_Sayers","/wiki/Barry_Sanders","/wiki/OJ_Simpson","/wiki/1968_American_Football_League_Draft","/wiki/Canadian_Football_League","/wiki/Charlie_Smith_(running_back)","/wiki/Mark_van_Eeghen","/wiki/Detroit_Lions","/w/index.php?title=Marvin_Hubbard&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Castro_Valley","/wiki/Driving_under_the_influence","#cite_note-1","#cite_note-2","#cite_note-3","/w/index.php?title=Marvin_Hubbard&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/List_of_American_Football_League_players","/w/index.php?title=Marvin_Hubbard&action=edit&section=3","#cite_ref-1","http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2003/09/29/BA30878.DTL","#cite_ref-2","http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-6967730.html","#cite_ref-3","http://articles.sfgate.com/2004-01-27/bay-area/17409298_1_eden-medical-center-u-turn-driving","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","/wiki/Salamanca,_New_York","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Marvin_Hubbard&oldid=492588520","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1946_births","/wiki/Category:Living_people","/wiki/Category:People_from_Cattaraugus_County,_New_York","/wiki/Category:American_football_fullbacks","/wiki/Category:American_football_running_backs","/wiki/Category:Colgate_University_alumni","/wiki/Category:Colgate_Raiders_football_players","/wiki/Category:Oakland_Raiders_(AFL)_players","/wiki/Category:Oakland_Raiders_players","/wiki/Category:American_Conference_Pro_Bowl_players","/wiki/Category:Detroit_Lions_players","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Marvin+Hubbard&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Marvin+Hubbard","/wiki/Marvin_Hubbard","/wiki/Talk:Marvin_Hubbard","#","/wiki/Marvin_Hubbard","/w/index.php?title=Marvin_Hubbard&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Marvin_Hubbard&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Marvin_Hubbard","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Marvin_Hubbard","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Marvin_Hubbard&oldid=492588520","/w/index.php?title=Marvin_Hubbard&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6778373","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Marvin_Hubbard&id=492588520","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Marvin+Hubbard","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Marvin+Hubbard&oldid=492588520&writer=rl","/w/index.php?tit
