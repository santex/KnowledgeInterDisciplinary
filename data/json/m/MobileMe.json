All services were being gradually transitioned and\nreplaced by iCloud and the service ceased as of June 30, 2012, with transfers to\niCloud available until July 31, 2012. After that date, all data was deleted, and\nthe email addresses of accounts not transferred to iCloud were marked as unused.\n\nAn early attempt by Apple with online services was eWorld, which ran from June\n1994 until March 1996.\n\nOriginally launched on January 5, 2000, as iTools, a free collection of Internet-\nbased services for users of Mac OS 9, Apple relaunched it as .Mac on July 17,\n2002, when it became a paid subscription service primarily designed for users of\nMac OS X. Apple relaunched the service again as MobileMe on July 9, 2008 at WWDC\n2008, now targeting , Windows, iPhone, iPod Touch users, and following its April\n2010 release, also iPad users.\n\nOn February 24, 2011, Apple discontinued offering MobileMe at its retail stores,\nwith MobileMe retail boxes eventually removed from resellers as well.\nAdditionally, Apple no longer accepted new subscribers for MobileMe. On June 6,\n2011, Apple announced that a new service called iCloud was to replace MobileMe,\nsometime in the fall. At the iPhone special event on October 4, 2011, Apple\nannounced it would finally launch iCloud on October 12, 2011, to replace\nMobileMe for new users, with current users having access until June 30, 2012,\nwhen the service would cease. MobileMe was shut down on June 30, 2012, but data\nwas still able to be retrieved for an advertised \"limited time\", until July 31,\n2012, when the site finally closed completely.\n","linknr":770,"url":"MobileMe","recorded":1362477078,"links":42,"instances":["software","software","apple","programming","application","ios","application","software","web_browser","street"],"pdf":["http://manuals.info.apple.com/en_US/iPhone_User_Guide.pdf"],"categories":["Apple
