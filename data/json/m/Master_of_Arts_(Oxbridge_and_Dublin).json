{"cursor":"19720","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nIn the Universities of Oxford, Cambridge and Dublin, Bachelors of Arts of these\nuniversities are promoted to the degree of '[[Master of Arts]]' or 'Master in\nArts' ('MA') on application after six or seven years' seniority as members of\nthe university (including years as an undergraduate).\n\nThere is no examination or study required for the degree beyond those required\nfor the BA. This practice differs from that in most other universities\nworldwide, for whom the degree reflects further postgraduate study or\nachievement, and these degrees are sometimes referred to as the 'Oxbridge MA'\nand 'Dublin' or 'Trinity MA' to differentiate them. See for instance a\nreader's letter to [[The Times]]:\n[http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=152170], an [[The\nIndependent|Independent]] article [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-5087035.html]\nand an article in [[The Oxford Student]]\n[http://www.oxfordstudent.com/mt1999wk1/news/privilege_axed] The Oxbridge\nMA is based on the system of academic rank rather than on one of academic\nqualifications. Once incepted/promoted to MA, the holder no longer wears the\nacademicals or uses the post-nominals pertaining to a Bachelor of Arts as they\nare no longer of that rank, thus the Master of Arts is not a separate degree\ngiven in addition to the Bachelor of Arts but is basically a conversion of one\ndegree to another.\n\nAll three universities have other masters' degrees that require further study\nand examination, but these have other titles, such as Master of Letters (MLitt),\nMaster of Philosophy (MPhil), Master of Studies (MSt), Master of Engineering\n(MEng) and Master of Science (MSc).\n\nIn the ancient universities of Scotland, the degree is awarded as a first degree\nto undergraduates in certain subjects (see [[Master of Arts (Scotland)]]).\n","linknr":245,"url":"Master_of_Arts_(Oxbridge_and_Dublin)","recorded":1363185551,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Master_of_Arts_(Oxbridge_and_Dublin)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Master_of_Arts_(Oxbridge_and_Dublin)&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/Master_of_Arts_(disambiguation)","/wiki/University_of_Oxford","/wiki/University_of_Cambridge","/wiki/University_of_Dublin","/wiki/Bachelor_of_Arts","/wiki/Master_of_Arts","/wiki/Undergraduate_education","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Academic_dress","/wiki/Master_of_Letters","/wiki/Master_of_Philosophy","/wiki/Master_of_Studies","/wiki/Master_of_Engineering","/wiki/Master_of_Science","/wiki/Ancient_universities_of_Scotland","/wiki/First_degree","/wiki/Master_of_Arts_(Scotland)","#Initials","#Requirements","#History_and_rationale","#Rights_and_privileges","#Precedence","#MA_status","#Recognition","#See_also","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Master_of_Arts_(Oxbridge_and_Dublin)&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Post-nominal_letters","/wiki/Honours_degree","#cite_note-2","/w/index.php?title=Master_of_Arts_(Oxbridge_and_Dublin)&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Matriculation","/wiki/Bachelor_of_Fine_Arts","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Bachelor_of_Arts","#cite_note-4","#cite_note-5","/wiki/Ad_eundem_gradum","#cite_note-6","#cite_note-7","#cite_note-8","#cite_note-9","#cite_note-10","/w/index.php?title=Master_of_Arts_(Oxbridge_and_Dublin)&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/Liberal_arts","/wiki/Trivium_(education)","/wiki/Quadrivium","/wiki/Bachelor%27s_degree","/wiki/Bachelor_of_Arts","/wiki/University_of_Paris","/wiki/Responsions","/wiki/Convocation","/wiki/Disputation","/wiki/Grammar_school","/wiki/France","/wiki/Baccalaur%C3%A9at","/wiki/University_of_London","/w/index.php?title=Master_of_Arts_(Oxbridge_and_Dublin)&action=edit&section=4","/wiki/Convocation","/wiki/Faculty_senate","/wiki/University_constituency#Scotland.2C_England.2C_Ireland.2C_Great_Britain.2C_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Chancellor_(education)","/wiki/Oxford_Professor_of_Poetry","/wiki/High_Steward_(academia)","/wiki/Proctor","/wiki/Gaudy","#cite_note-11","#cite_note-12","#cite_note-13","/w/index.php?title=Master_of_Arts_(Oxbridge_and_Dublin)&action=edit&section=5","#cite_note-14","#cite_note-15","/wiki/University_of_Oxford","/wiki/Doctor_of_Divinity","/wiki/Doctor_of_Civil_Law","/w/index.php?title=Master_of_Arts_(Oxbridge_and_Dublin)&action=edit&section=6","/wiki/Congregation_(university)","/w/index.php?title=Master_of_Arts_(Oxbridge_and_Dublin)&action=edit&section=7","/wiki/New_Zealand_Qualifications_Authority","/wiki/Chris_Leslie_(politician)","#cite_note-16","#cite_note-17","/w/index.php?title=Master_of_Arts_(Oxbridge_and_Dublin)&action=edit&section=8","/wiki/Wooden_spoon_(award)","/wiki/Wrangler_(University_of_Cambridge)","/w/index.php?title=Master_of_Arts_(Oxbridge_and_Dublin)&action=edit&section=9","#cite_ref-1","/wiki/The_Times","http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=152170","/wiki/The_Independent","http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-5087035.html","/wiki/The_Oxford_Student","http://www.oxfordstudent.com/mt1999wk1/news/privilege_axed","#cite_ref-2","http://www.ox.ac.uk/media/global/wwwoxacuk/localsites/gazette/documents/universitycalendar/style--current_for_2011.pdf","http://www.ox.ac.uk/media/global/wwwoxacuk/localsites/gazette/documents/universitycalendar/style--current_for_2011.pdf","#cite_ref-3","/wiki/Oxford_University_Press","#cite_ref-4","http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/univ/so/pdfs/cso_4_ordinance05.422_424.pdf","http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/univ/so/","/wiki/Cambridge_University_Press","http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/univ/so/pdfs/cso_4_ordinance05.422_424.pdf","#cite_ref-5","http://www.tcd.ie/calendar/assets/pdf/degrees_diplomas.pdf","http://www.tcd.ie/calendar/assets/pdf/degrees_diplomas.pdf","#cite_ref-6","http://www.admin.ox.ac.uk/statutes/215-031.shtml","http://www.admin.ox.ac.uk/statutes/","http://www.admin.ox.ac.uk/statutes/215-031.shtml","#cite_ref-7","http://www.tcd.ie/Secretary/Board/Other_Papers/Statutes-Current.pdf","http://www.tcd.ie/Secretary/Board/Other_Papers/Statutes-Current.pdf","#cite_ref-8","http://www.tcd.ie/about/calendar/pdf/degrees_diplomas.pdf","http://www.tcd.ie/a
