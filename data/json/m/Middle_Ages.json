It began with the collapse of the Western Roman Empire, and was\nfollowed by the Renaissance and the Age of Discovery. The Middle Ages is the\nmiddle period of the traditional division of Western history into Classical,\nMedieval, and Modern periods. The period is subdivided into the Early Middle\nAges, the High Middle Ages, and the Late Middle Ages.\n\nIn the Early Middle Ages, depopulation, deurbanization, and barbarian invasions,\nwhich began in Late Antiquity, continued. The barbarian invaders formed new\nkingdoms in the remains of the Western Roman Empire. In the 7th century North\nAfrica and the Middle East, once part of the Eastern Roman Empire (the Byzantine\nEmpire), became an Islamic Empire after conquest by Muhammad's successors.\nAlthough there were substantial changes in society and political structures, the\nbreak with Antiquity was not complete. The still sizeable Byzantine Empire\nsurvived and remained a major power. The empire's law code, the Code of\nJustinian, was widely admired. In the West, most kingdoms incorporated extant\nRoman institutions, while monasteries were founded as Christianity expanded in\nwestern Europe. The Franks, under the Carolingian dynasty, established an empire\ncovering much of western Europe; the Carolingian Empire endured until the 9th\ncentury, when it succumbed to the pressures of invasion â the Vikings from the\nnorth; the Magyars from the east, and the Saracens from the south.\n\nDuring the High Middle Ages, which began after AD 1000, the population of Europe\nincreased greatly as technological and agricultural innovations allowed trade to\nflourish and crop yields to increase. Manorialism â the organization of peasants\ninto villages that owed rent and labor services to the nobles; and feudalism â\nthe political structure whereby knights and lower-status nobles owed military\nservice to their overlords, in return for the right to rent from lands and\nmanors - were two of the ways society was organized in the High Middle Ages. The\nCrusades, first preached in 1095, were military attempts, by western European\nChristians, to regain control of the Middle Eastern Holy Land from the Muslims.\nKings became the heads of centralized nation states, reducing crime and violence\nbut making the ideal of a unified Christendom more distant. Intellectual life\nwas marked by scholasticism, a philosophy which emphasized joining faith to\nreason, and by the founding of universities. The philosophy of Thomas Aquinas,\nthe paintings of Giotto, the poetry of Dante and Chaucer, the travels of Marco\nPolo, and the architecture of Gothic cathedrals such as Chartres are among the\noutstanding achievements of this period.\n\nThe Late Middle Ages were marked by difficulties and calamities, such as\nfamine, plague, and war, which much diminished the population of western\nEurope; in the four years from 1347 through 1350, the Black Death killed\napproximately a third of the European population. Controversy, heresy, and\nschism within the Church paralleled the warfare between states, the civil war,\nand peasant revolts occurring in the kingdoms. Cultural and technological\ndevelopments transformed European society, concluding the Late Middle Ages and\nbeginning the Early Modern period.\n","linknr":2229,"url":"Middle_Ages","recorded":1362502028,"links":185,"instances":["metaphysics","907","ethnic_group","optics","historical","410","papal","armour","architecture","medieval","province","historiography","walters_71264","education","medieval","medieval_office","roman_empire","architecture","emperor","architecture","brooch"],"pdf":["http://www.st-edmunds.cam.ac.uk/faraday/CIS/Numbers/Numbers_Lecture.pdf","http://www.st-edmunds.cam.ac.uk/faraday/CIS/Numbers/Numbers_Lecture.pdf","http://www.st-edmunds.cam.ac.uk/faraday/CIS/Numbers/Numbers_Lecture.pdf"],"categories":["Middle
