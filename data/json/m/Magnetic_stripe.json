The magnetic stripe, sometimes called 'swipe card' or\n'magstripe', is read by swiping past a magnetic reading head.\n\nMagnetic recording on steel tape and wire was invented during World War II for\nrecording audio. In the 1950s, magnetic recording of digital computer data on\nplastic tape coated with iron oxide was invented. In 1960 IBM used the magnetic\ntape idea to develop a reliable way of securing magnetic stripes to plastic\ncards, Jerome Svigals, The long life and imminent death of\nthe mag-stripe card, IEEE Spectrum, June 2012, p. 71 under a contract with\nthe US government for a security system. A number of International Organization\nfor Standardization standards, ISO/IEC 7810, ISO/IEC 7811, ISO/IEC 7812, ISO/IEC\n7813, ISO 8583, and ISO/IEC 4909, now define the physical properties of the\ncard, including size, flexibility, location of the magstripe, magnetic\ncharacteristics, and data formats. They also provide the standards for financial\ncards, including the allocation of card number ranges to different card issuing\ninstitutions.\n","linknr":430,"url":"Magnetic_stripe","recorded":1362677574,"links":34,"instances":["new_york_city"],"pdf":["http://www.suu.edu/alumni/magazine/fall04/pdf/news.pdf","http://www.suu.edu/alumni/magazine/fall04/pdf/news.pdf"],"categories":["Magnetic devices","Personal documents","Banking technology","Radio-frequency identification","American inventions","1960 introductions"],"headings":["The Magnetic Stripe","First Magnetic Striped Plastic Credit and Badge Access Cards","The Magnetic Stripe and Bar Code Encoding Developments","The Production Process for the Magnetic Striped Plastic Credit and Badge ID Cards","Further Developments of the Magnetic Stripe Card and Encoding Standards","Magnetic stripe coercivity","Financial cards","United States driver's licenses","Other card types","See also","Notes","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/CCardBack.svg/225px-CCardBack.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/Aufnahme_der_magnetischen_Struktur_eines_Magnetstreifens_auf_eine_EC-Karte_%28Aufnahme_mit_CMOS-MagView%292.jpg/220px-Aufnahme_der_magnetischen_Struktur_eines_Magnetstreifens_auf_eine_EC-Karte_%28Aufnahme_mit_CMOS-MagView%292.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b3/Magnetic_stripe_prototype.jpg/220px-Magnetic_stripe_prototype.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/Aufnahme_der_magnetischen_Struktur_eines_Magnetstreifens_auf_eine_EC-Karte_%28Aufnahme_mit_CMOS-MagView%29.jpg/220px-Aufnahme_der_magnetischen_Struktur_eines_Magnetstreifens_auf_eine_EC-Karte_%28Aufnahme_mit_CMOS-MagView%29.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["metrocard","new_york_city"]],"members":["metrocard"],"related":["Magnetic_storage","Magnetism","Tape_head","World_War_II","IBM","International_Organization_for_Standardization","ISO/IEC_7810","ISO/IEC_7811","ISO/IEC_7812","ISO/IEC_7813","ISO_8583","ISO/IEC_4909","Forrest_Parry","Forrest_Parry","Los_Gatos,_California","International_Air_Transport_Association","American_Bankers_Association","Point_of_sale","ATM_card","VISA","MasterCard","Gift_card","Loyalty_card","Driver's_license","Telephone_card","Membership_card","Supplemental_Nutrition_Assistance_Program","Cyprus","Coercivity","Oersted","Oersted","American_Express","Slurry","Digital_Equipment_Corporation","Sixbit_code_pages","Parity_bit","Credit_card_number","Longitudinal_redundancy_check","ASCII","Credit_card_number","Longitudinal_redundancy_check","American_Association_of_Motor_Vehicle_Administrators","Smart_cards","Integrated_circuit","Contactless_card","RFID","Payment_card","Access_badge","Access_control","Common_Access_Card","Credential","Credit_card_number","Forrest_Parry","ID_Card","Keycard","MetroCard_(New_York_City)","Photo_identification","Physical_Security","Proximity_card","Security","Security_engineering","Smart_card","Stored-value_card"]}
