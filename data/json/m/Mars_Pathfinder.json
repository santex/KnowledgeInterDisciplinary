It consisted of a lander, renamed the 'Carl Sagan\nMemorial Station', and a lightweight (10.6 kg/23 lb) wheeled robotic\nMars rover named ''Sojourner''. http://mpfwww.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/past/pa-\nthfinder.html\n\nLaunched on December 4, 1996 by NASA aboard a Delta II booster a month after the\nMars Global Surveyor was launched, it landed on July 4, 1997 on Mars's Ares\nVallis, in a region called Chryse Planitia in the Oxia Palus quadrangle. The\nlander then opened, exposing the rover which conducted many experiments on the\nMartian surface. The mission carried a series of scientific instruments to\nanalyze the Martian atmosphere, climate, geology and the composition of its\nrocks and soil. It was the second project from NASA's Discovery Program, which\npromotes the use of low-cost spacecraft and frequent launches under the motto\n\"cheaper, faster and better\" promoted by the then administrator, Daniel Goldin.\nThe mission was directed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), a division of\nthe California Institute of Technology, responsible for NASA's Mars Exploration\nProgram. The project manager was JPL's Tony Spear.\n\nThis mission was the first of a series of missions to Mars that included rovers,\nand was the first successful lander since the two [[Viking program|Vikings]]\nlanded on the red planet in 1976. Although the Soviet Union successfully sent\nrovers to the Moon as part of the Lunokhod program in the 1970s, its attempts to\nuse rovers in its Mars probe program failed.\n\nIn addition to scientific objectives, the Mars Pathfinder mission was also a \"proof-of-\nconcept\" for various technologies, such as airbag-mediated touchdown and\nautomated obstacle avoidance, both later exploited by the Mars Exploration Rover\nmission. The Mars Pathfinder was also remarkable for its extremely low cost\nrelative to other unmanned space missions to Mars. Originally, the mission was\nconceived as the first of the Mars Environmental Survey (MESUR) program.\n","linknr":1401,"url":"Mars_Pathfinder","recorded":1362506451,"links":95,"instances":["computing","geology","rover_","spacecraft","space_exploration","mars","planet"],"pdf":["http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/MPF/newspio/pkts/mpfland2.pdf","http://mepag.jpl.nasa.gov/meeting/mar-09/02_MEPAG_McCuistion_Mar_09.pdf","http://mepag.jpl.nasa.gov/meeting/mar-09/02_MEPAG_McCuistion_Mar_09.pdf","http://www.unb.ca/passc/GSA/Newsletters.img/formatted%20newsletter%201998.pdf"],"categories":["Mars","Mars
