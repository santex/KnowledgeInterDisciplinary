Fire was an essential tool in early human cultural development. [http://bushcraft.org.nz/video/make-fire-without-matches-in-\n1 Fire bow tutorial]\n\nThe control of fire by early humans is said to date back to either [[Homo\nerectus]] or very early [[Homo sapiens]]: that is, hundreds of thousands of\nyears ago, based on archaeological evidence of hearths. Smoldering plants and\ntrees, or any source of hot coals from natural fires, may have been the first\nresources exploited by humans to control fire. Friction is the most commonly\nused primitive method for making fire. Ancient techniques for starting friction\nfires include the hand drill, the bow drill, the fire plow and the pump drill.\nThe flint and steel method, where hot sparks are struck from a piece of steel or\niron onto suitable tinder and fanned into flames, was also used by primitive\ncultures. These methods have been known since the Paleolithic age, and are still\nin common use by some indigenous peoples.\n\nThe skills required to create, control and use fire using primitive methods,\noften in a survival situation, have come into popular use as a component of\nbushcraft.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Making_fire","recorded":1372152273,"links":[],"instances":["cooking","film","optics","fire"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Firelighting|"],"headings":["Methods by historical era","See also","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["spark","fire"],["lens","optics"],["grill","cooking"],["quest_for_fire","film"]],"members":["grill","quest_for_fire","lens","spark"],"related":["Fire_striker","Control_of_fire_by_early_humans","Hearth","Smoldering","Coal","Bow_drill","Fire_plow","Pump_drill","Tinder","Paleolithic","Indigenous_peoples","Survival_techniques","Bushcraft","Fire_ecology","White_sage","Tobacco","Tinder","Birch","Friction","Hand_drill","Bow_drill","Fire_plough","Fire-saw","Quartz","Jasper","Agate","Flint","Ember","Spark_(fire)","Pyrite","Marcasite","Charcloth","Pre-industrial","Fire_striker","Tinderbox","Lens_(optics)","Burning_glass","Concave_mirror","Fire_piston","Laurens_van_der_Post","Match","Lighter","Ferrocerium","Butane","Grill_(cooking)","Piezoelectricity","Electric_stove","Charcloth","Ferro_rod","Bushcraft","Survivalists","Magnesium","Batoning","Bushcraft","List_of_firelighting_topics","Quest_for_Fire_(film)","Survival_skills"]}
