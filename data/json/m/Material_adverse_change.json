[http://vcexperts.com/vce/library/encyclopedia/documents_view.asp?documen-\nt_id=620 VC experts];\n[http://www.moneyglossary.com/?w=Material+Adverse+Change+or+Effect Money\nGlossary]\n\nThe rationale for such a clause is a means to protect the acquirer from major\nchanges that make the target less attractive as a purchase. Large transactions\noften require a long period of time between actual agreement and the completion\nof the transaction (the \"closing\"). This time is used to obtain governmental or\nregulatory approvals (e.g., in the United States, Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust\nImprovements Act approval), to obtain shareholder or labor consents, and any\nother required third-party consents. During this period, the target continues to\nfunction pending the completion of the merger, and is subject to the normal\nrisks of its business, the economy or acts beyond its control.\n\nEach merger agreement that contains such a clause has a different definition of\nwhat, in its particular context, constitutes a material adverse change. Often\nthis is one of the few or some times, the only way that an acquiring party can\nrefuse to complete a contemplated acquisition. When the acquiring party cites\nthe occurrence of a material adverse change to refuse to complete a merger or\nacquisition, litigation may ensue. One notable occurrence is the planned\nacquisition of SLM Corporation (formerly known as Sallie Mae) by a group\nincluding Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase.

According to the precedents\nof that court, an acquirer seeking to avoid completion of a transaction based\nupon a MAC provision bears the burden of proving that a material adverse change\nas defined by the parties' agreement has in fact occurred.
