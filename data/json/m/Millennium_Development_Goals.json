All 193 United Nations member states and at\nleast 23 international organizations have agreed to achieve these goals by the\nyear 2015. The goals are:\n# Eradicating extreme poverty and hunger, Achieving universal primary education,\n# Promoting gender equality and empowering women, Reducing child mortality\n# rates, Improving maternal health, Combating HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other\n# diseases, Ensuring environmental sustainability, and Developing a global\n# partnership for development. [http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/bkgd.shtml\n# Background page], Halve by 2015 the proportion of people without sustainable\n# access to safe drinking water United Nations Millennium Development Goals\n# website, retrieved 16 June 2009.\n\nEach of the goals has specific stated targets and dates for achieving those\ntargets. To accelerate progress, the G8 Finance Ministers agreed in June 2005 to\nprovide enough funds to the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF),\nand the African Development Bank (AfDB) to cancel an additional $40 to\n$55 billion in debt owed by members of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries\n(HIPC) to allow impoverished countries to reâchannel the resources saved from\nthe forgiven debt to social programs for improving health and education and for\nalleviating poverty.\n\nDebate has surrounded adoption of the MDGs, focusing on lack of analysis and\njustification behind the chosen objectives, the difficulty or lack of\nmeasurements for some of the goals, and uneven progress towards reaching the\ngoals, among other criticisms. Although developed countries' aid for achieving\nthe MDGs has been rising over recent years, more than half the aid is towards\ndebt relief owed by poor countries, with much of the remaining aid money going\ntowards natural disaster relief and military aid which do not further\ndevelopment.\n\nProgress towards reaching the goals has been uneven. Some countries have\nachieved many of the goals, while others are not on track to realize any. A UN\nconference in September 2010 reviewed progress to date and concluded with the\nadoption of a global action plan to achieve the eight anti-poverty goals by\ntheir 2015 target date. There were also new commitments on women's and\nchildren's health, and new initiatives in the worldwide battle against poverty,\nhunger, and disease.\n\nGovernment organizations assist in achieving those goals, among them are the\nUnited Nations Millennium Campaign, the Millennium Promise Alliance, Inc.,\nthe Global Poverty Project, the Micah Challenge, The Youth in Action EU\nProgramme, \"Cartoons in Action\" video project, and the 8 Visions of Hope\nglobal art project.\n","linknr":840,"url":"Millennium_Development_Goals","recorded":1362372170,"links":87,"instances":["latin_american_school_of_medicine_cuba","economic","country"],"pdf":["http://www.bwpi.manchester.ac.uk/resources/Working-Papers/bwpi-wp-1607.pdf","http://www.bwpi.manchester.ac.uk/resources/Working-Papers/bwpi-wp-1607.pdf","http://siteresources.worldbank.org/DATASTATISTICS/Resources/MDGsOfficialList2008.pdf","http://siteresources.worldbank.org/DATASTATISTICS/Resources/MDGsOfficialList2008.pdf","http://econ.lse.ac.uk/staff/rburgess/wp/jep11.pdf","http://econ.lse.ac.uk/staff/rburgess/wp/jep11.pdf","http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTPOVCALNET/Resources/Global_Poverty_Update_2012_02-29-12.pdf","http://www.unmillenniumproject.org/documents/hdr03_complete.pdf","http://www.ids.ac.uk/download.cfm?file=IF9.1.pdf","http://www.unmillenniumproject.org/documents/07_aconf198-11.pdf","http://www.unmillenniumproject.org/documents/07_aconf198-11.pdf","http://www.usunnewyork.usmission.gov/fact_sheet/ecosoc_Chapter_4_apr15.pdf","http://www.unmillenniumproject.org/documents/EUExternalRelations24May.pdf","http://www.unmillenniumproject.org/documents/EUExternalRelations24May.pdf","http://www.unmillenniumproject.org/documents/endorse_TI_19Jan05.pdf","http://www.unmillenniumproject.org/documents/endorse_TI_19Jan05.pdf","http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/Press%20release_post-2015panel.pdf","http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/Press%20release_post-2015panel.pdf"],"categories":["Development","Economic
