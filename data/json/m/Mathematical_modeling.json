{"cursor":"26978","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nA 'mathematical model' is a description of a system using mathematical concepts\nand language. The process of developing a mathematical model is termed\n'mathematical modelling'. Mathematical models are used not only in the natural\nsciences (such as physics, biology, earth science, meteorology) and engineering\ndisciplines (e.g. computer science, artificial intelligence), but also in the\nsocial sciences (such as economics, psychology, sociology and political\nscience); physicists, engineers, statisticians, operations research analysts and\neconomists use mathematical models most extensively. A model may help to explain\na system and to study the effects of different components, and to make\npredictions about behaviour.\n\nMathematical models can take many forms, including but not limited to dynamical\nsystems, statistical models, differential equations, or game theoretic models.\nThese and other types of models can overlap, with a given model involving a\nvariety of abstract structures. In general, mathematical models may include\nlogical models, as far as logic is taken as a part of mathematics. In many\ncases, the quality of a scientific field depends on how well the mathematical\nmodels developed on the theoretical side agree with results of repeatable\nexperiments. Lack of agreement between theoretical mathematical models and\nexperimental measurements often leads to important advances as better theories\nare developed.\n","linknr":343,"url":"Mathematical_modeling","recorded":1362511781,"links":55,"instances":["mathematics","mathematics","mathematics","mathematics","philosophy","mathematics","computing","software_engineering","goal","knowledge","mathematics","electronics","statistics","mathematics"],"pdf":["http://hsinnamon.web.wesleyan.edu/wescourses/NSB-Psyc255/Readings/17.%20Spatial%20Limbic%20System/Whishaw.pdf","http://www.causascientia.org/math_stat/Tutorial.pdf","http://www.emily-griffiths.postgrad.shef.ac.uk/models.pdf"],"categories":["Applied
