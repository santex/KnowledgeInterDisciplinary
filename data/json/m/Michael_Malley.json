{"cursor":"10044","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Michael \"Tanker\" Malley' (born July 8, 1962 in Chatham, New Brunswick) is a\nformer politician in the Canadian Province of New Brunswick. He represented the\nriding of Miramichi-Bay du Vin in the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick from\n1999 to 2006 and served as Speaker of the Assembly for part of 2006.\n\nMalley, a former Miramichi city councillor and bus driver, was first elected to\nthe legislature in the 1999 election and was re-elected in 2003.\n\nThe 2003 election returned his Progressive Conservatives to a majority\ngovernment of just a one-seat margin. Malley was named whip, a position of\nexpanded importance in a legislature with such close numbers. He was widely\ncalled upon by leaders in his community to leave the government in 2004 if the\nLord government did not back away from rumoured health care cuts in the region.\nIn the end the cuts were not as severe as had been rumoured and Malley remained\nin caucus.\n\nOn February 17, 2006, shortly after a cabinet shuffle, Malley announced he would\nleave the Conservative caucus to sit as an independent. He expressed\ndisappointment in the government's overall direction and in his not being\nincluded in cabinet despite being the only representative of Miramichi in the\nConservative caucus [http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikisource/en/9/9c/Michael_mal-\nley_leaves_caucus.pdf] He argued that whereas Miramichi is the province's fourth\nlargest city and where the three larger cities have significant representation\n(Moncton with 4, Saint John with 3 and Fredericton with 3), Miramichi ought to\nhave had a member in the cabinet. His argument here was somewhat flawed, in that\nthe cities proper have 2, 1 and 1 respectively, the numbers above include\nsurrounding areas; the Miramichi area, if viewed through the same lens, has one\ncabinet member in Rogersville-Kouchibouguac MLA Rose-May Poirier.\n\nPremier Bernard Lord has alleged Malley had less savory motives for leaving\nLord's governing Conservative party. Lord alleged at a news conference that\nMalley made five specific demands in exchange for staying with the\nConservatives, including: more money for his constituency office, more help for\nthe Miramichi's troubled paper mill and the appointment of a female friend as\nhis special assistant .[http://lfpress.ca/newsstand/News/National/2006/02/20/1452196-\nsun.html] Lord further alleged that Malley demanded he immediately appoint\nFredericton lawyer Cleveland Allaby, who Lord called a \"good friend\" of Mr.\nMalley's, as provincial court judge in the Miramichi. Allaby, however, denied\nthis allegation and Lord admitted that he had no proof of any of the alleged de-\nmands.[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20060219.wmalley0219/-\nBNStory/National/home] Malley has also denied these allegations.\n[http://www.cbc.ca/nb/story/nb_tankerspotting20060221.html]\n\nMalley's floor crossing was especially significant because it changed Lord's\nProgressive Conservative government from a majority to a minority with the\nstandings becoming: Progressive Conservatives 27, opposition Liberal Party 26\nand two independents including Malley and former Liberal Frank Branch. When\nMalley announced he was leaving the Conservatives, he stated that he would use\nhis new position of influence to support legislation that helps the poor people\nof New Brunswick and residents of the Miramichi region.\n\nOn March 28, 2006, Malley was acclaimed as Speaker of the Legislature after Tony\nHuntjens, the nominee of Bernard Lord, withdrew his name. Electing Malley as\nspeaker, a position in which one only votes in the case of a tie, instead of a\nmember of the government caucus, provides the government considerable more\nflexibility. Though still technically a minority government, by tradition,\nshould there be a tie on a vote of confidence, the Speaker would vote in favour\nof the government.\n\nOn April 13, 2006, Malley announced he was rejoining the Progressive\nConservative caucus, though as Speaker he would not attend caucus meetings and\nhe would remain impartial. Liberal leader Shawn Graham and New Democratic Party\nleader Allison Brewer (whose party is not currently represented in the\nlegislature, but was from 1991 to 2005) criticized the decision. Graham said\nMalley was making the legislature the \"laughing stock\" of the Commonwealth\nbecause of the unusual and unprecedented move of a, by definition, non-partisan\nSpeaker announcing from his chair his change in partisan affiliation. Brewer\nsaid a mockery was being made of office of speaker. As Malley remains only able\nto vote in the case of a tie, the actual status of the legislature is unchanged\nwith 27 ordinally voting members of the government, 27 members of the opposition\nand an impartial Speaker. The significance of this move, however, is a motion\npassed by the legislature in 2003 which requires the opposition withhold a vote\non committees on which the government does not have a majority in order to\n\"preserve the government majority\". Premier Benard Lord argues he now has a\nmajority again and the opposition should honour the terms of that motion while\nthe Opposition has said that they do not recognize a change of affiliation from\na speaker in the chair and will still operate as if the government were in a\nminority situation until such time as the Speaker resigns, sits among the\nConservative caucus and re-offers for his office as a Conservative.\n\nThrough much of May, the Government and Opposition began to negotiate to bring\nsome order back to the legislature. With only two parties represented, the tight\nnumbers make it difficult for the Government to pass some of its agenda through\nthe House and they had proposed radical rule changes to increase their majority\ninside of legislative committees. The Liberals opposed this saying it would turn\nthe legislature into little more than a rubber stamp. A counter proposal offered\nby the Liberals was to see Malley resign as speaker and, in exchange, the\nLiberals would allow one of their members to stand for the post therefore\nincreasing the working majority of the government by 2 votes. In exchange for\nthis, the Liberals wanted an early election in the fall of 2006. Though the\nConservative Government rejected this offer, the Liberals and Conservatives\nbegan negotiations which included the possibility of removing Malley from\noffice. On May 24, 2006, Government House Leader Bev Harrison, Malley's\npredecessor as Speaker, said the government would not force Malley from office\nbut, were he still Speaker, he would resign to resolve the deadlock. Malley has\nrefused to comment to the media on this situation.\n\nA vote on May 30, 2006 to remove Malley from office was defeated 27 to 25. Later\nhowever fellow Progressive Conservative Peter Mesheau announced his plans to\nresign from the legislature and rather than face another minority, Bernard Lord\ncalled an election. Malley sought re-election against Bill Fraser, the man who\nled the protests against hospital cuts in Malley's region.\n\nIn the general provincial election of 18 September 2006, Malley lost his seat to\nLiberal challenger Bill Fraser. Malley was soundly defeated, trailing his\nopponent by better than 20 percent in the popular vote.\n[http://www.cbc.ca/nbvotes2006/riding/011/]\n\nFollowing his defeat, Malley was expected to continue to receive a salary as\nSpeaker, though not as MLA, until a new Speaker is elected on February 6, 2007.\nThis attracted some controversy.\n","linknr":143,"url":"Michael_Malley","recorded":1364044169,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Michael_Malley&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Michael_Malley&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/Chatham,_New_Brunswick","/wiki/Politician","/wiki/Canadian","/wiki/New_Brunswick","/wiki/Miramichi-Bay_du_Vin","/wiki/Legislative_Assembly_of_New_Brunswick","/wiki/Speaker_of_the_Legislative_Assembly_of_New_Brunswick","/wiki/Miramichi,_New_Brunswick","/wiki/City_council","/wiki/New_Brunswick_general_election,_1999","/wiki/New_Brunswick_general_election,_2003","/wiki/Progressive_Conservative_Party_of_New_Brunswick","/wiki/Majority_government","/wiki/Whip_(politics)","/wiki/Caucus","/wiki/Cabinet_shuffle","/wiki/Independent_(politician)","http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikisource/en/9/9c/Michael_malley_leaves_caucus.pdf","/wiki/Moncton","/wiki/Saint_John,_New_Brunswick","/wiki/Fredericton,_New_Brunswick","/wiki/Rogersville-Kouchibouguac","/wiki/Rose-May_Poirier","/wiki/Premier_of_New_Brunswick","/wiki/Bernard_Lord","http://lfpress.ca/newsstand/News/National/2006/02/20/1452196-sun.html","/wiki/Cleveland_Allaby","http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20060219.wmalley0219/BNStory/National/home","http://www.cbc.ca/nb/story/nb_tankerspotting20060221.html","/wiki/Crossing_the_floor","/wiki/Minority_government","/wiki/New_Brunswick_Liberal_Association","/wiki/Frank_Branch","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/wiki/Tony_Huntjens","/wiki/Vote_of_confidence","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/wiki/Shawn_Graham","/wiki/New_Brunswick_New_Democratic_Party","/wiki/Allison_Brewer","/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Malley#endnote_speakercrossing","/wiki/Government_House_Leader_(New_Brunswick)","/wiki/Bev_Harrison","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Malley#endnote_toresign.3F","/wiki/Peter_Mesheau","/wiki/New_Brunswick_general_election,_2006","http://www.cbc.ca/nbvotes2006/riding/011/","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Malley#endnote_TT-Oct06-06","/w/index.php?title=Michael_Malley&action=edit&section=1","#ref_speakercrossing","/wiki/Times_%26_Transcript","#ref_toresign.3F","/wiki/Telegraph-Journal","#ref_TT-Oct06-06","/wiki/Times_%26_Transcript","/w/index.php?title=Michael_Malley&action=edit&section=2","http://news.yahoo.com/s/cpress/20060218/ca_pr_on_na/nb_malley_quits","/wiki/Bev_Harrison","/wiki/Speaker_(politics)","/wiki/Legislative_Assembly_of_New_Brunswick","/wiki/Eugene_McGinley","/w/index.php?title=James_Doyle_(Canadian_politician)&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/New_Brunswick_Liberal_Association","/wiki/Member_of_the_Legislative_Assembly","/wiki/Legislative_Assembly_of_New_Brunswick","/wiki/Miramichi-Bay_du_Vin","/wiki/Bill_Fraser_(politician)","/wiki/New_Brunswick_Liberal_Association","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Michael_Malley&oldid=468759250","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1962_births","/wiki/Category:Living_people","/wiki/Category:Progressive_Conservative_Party_of_New_Brunswick_MLAs","/wiki/Category:Speakers_of_the_Legislative_Assembly_of_New_Brunswick","/wiki/Category:People_from_Northumberland_County,_New_Brunswick","/wiki/Category:New_Brunswick_municipal_councillors","/wiki/Category:All_articles_with_unsourced_statements","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_unsourced_statements_from_February_2007","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Michael+Malley&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Michael+Malley","/wiki/Michael_Malley","/wiki/Talk:Michael_Malley","#","/wiki/Michael_Malley","/w/index.php?title=Michael_Malley&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Michael_Malley&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinks
