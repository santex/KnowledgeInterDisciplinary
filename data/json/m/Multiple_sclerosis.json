It has a prevalence that ranges\nbetween 2 and 150 per 100,000. MS was first\ndescribed in 1868 by Jean-Martin Charcot.\n\nMS affects the ability of nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord to\ncommunicate with each other effectively. Nerve cells communicate by sending\nelectrical signals called action potentials down long fibers called axons, which\nare contained within an insulating substance called myelin. In MS, the body's\nown immune system attacks and damages the myelin. When myelin is lost, the axons\ncan no longer effectively conduct signals. The name\nmultiple sclerosis refers to scars (sclerae-âbetter known as plaques or lesions)\nparticularly in the white matter of the brain and spinal cord, which is mainly\ncomposed of myelin. Although much is known about the\nmechanisms involved in the disease process, the cause remains unknown. Theories\ninclude genetics or infections. Different environmental risk factors have also\nbeen found.\n\nAlmost any neurological symptom can appear with the disease, and the disease\noften progresses to physical and cognitive disability.\nMS takes several forms, with new symptoms occurring either in discrete attacks\n(relapsing forms) or accumulating over time (progressive forms). Between attacks, symptoms may go away completely, but\npermanent neurological deficits often occur, especially as the disease\nadvances.\n\nThere is no known cure for multiple sclerosis. Treatments attempt to return\nfunction after an attack, prevent new attacks, and prevent disability. MS medications can have adverse effects or be poorly\ntolerated, and many people pursue alternative treatments, despite the lack of\nsupporting scientific study. The prognosis is difficult to predict; it depends\non the subtype of the disease, the individual's disease characteristics, the\ninitial symptoms and the degree of disability the person experiences as time\nadvances. Life expectancy of people with MS is 5 to 10\nyears lower than that of the unaffected population.\n","linknr":1812,"url":"Multiple_sclerosis","recorded":1362504367,"links":79,"instances":["biological","japan","epidemiology","medicine","human","medicine","united_states","nutrition","physical"],"pdf":["http://www.shreveportphysiology.com/Alexander-MS.pdf.pdf","http://www.shreveportphysiology.com/Alexander-MS.pdf.pdf","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK48919/pdf/TOC.pdf","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK48919/pdf/TOC.pdf","http://www.pharma.us.novartis.com/cs/www.pharma.us.novartis.com/product/pi/pdf/gilenya.pdf","http://www.pharma.us.novartis.com/cs/www.pharma.us.novartis.com/product/pi/pdf/gilenya.pdf"],"categories":["Multiple
