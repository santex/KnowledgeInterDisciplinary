The folder is\nopened to access the matches, which are attached in a comb-like arrangement and\nmust be torn away before use in contrast to a matchbox where the matches are\nloosely packed in the interior tray.\n\nThe exterior of the matchcover is usually imprinted with a producer's logo,\noften with artistic decorations, or serves as an advertising/promotional media\nfor the undertaking it is sold or handed off in. The ease of making matchcovers\nof different shapes also made them quite a popular cheap promotional item or\nanniversary souvenir.\n\nManufacturing of matchbooks peaked during the 1940s and 50s, then steadily\ndeclined because of the availability of disposable lighters and various anti-\nsmoking health campaigns. Recently, matchbooks have begun to regain some of\ntheir popularity as a \"retro\" advertising item, particularly in high-end\nrestaurants.\n\nAlthough paper matches were patented in the 1880s, an early paper match \"folder\"\nwas patented in September 1892 by Philadelphia patent\nattorney Joshua Pusey, however the matchbook as we know it was patented a few\nweeks later by Charles Bowman of Lebanon, Pennsylvania. Pusey challenged\nBowman's patent, but Bowman's patent was upheld. Pusey sold his patent to the\nDiamond Match Trust in 1896 and then served as the company's patent attorney.\nBowman's company, the American Safety Head Match Company of Lebanon, PA did not\nlast long, and Diamond Match Co. adapted his design into their product, becoming\nthe first mass-producer of paper matchbooks.\n\nCollecting of matchboxes, matchbooks, match labels and other match-related items\nis called phillumeny.\n","linknr":147,"url":"Matchbook","recorded":1362581502,"links":20,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Collecting","Home appliances","Firelighting"],"headings":["Matchcover","See also","Bibliography","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/Matchbook_%28open%29.JPG/220px-Matchbook_%28open%29.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Allumette_CONCORDE.jpg/220px-Allumette_CONCORDE.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/80-188-CG_Match_Book_Cover.jpg/220px-80-188-CG_Match_Book_Cover.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Paperboard","Matchcover","Match","Advertisement","Lighter","Joshua_Pusey","Lebanon,_Pennsylvania","Phillumeny","Uncle_Sam","Match","Advertising","Collecting","Pabst_Brewing_Company","American_Tobacco_Company","Wrigley_Company","Matchbox"]}
