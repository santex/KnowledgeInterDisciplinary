{"cursor":"6097","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Morris \"Moe\" Koffman', OC (December 28, 1928 - March 28, 2001) was a Canadian\njazz musician and composer. He played the flute, soprano, alto and tenor\nsaxophone and clarinet. Although some jazz purists did not appreciate his\nsensitivity to popular tastes, his ability to adapt to changing styles reflected\nhis technical skill as a musician and diverse musical interests.\n\nBorn in Toronto, Koffman began his musical studies in his native city with\nGordon Delamont. He attended the Toronto Conservatory of Music, now the Royal\nConservatory of Music of Toronto, where he was a student of Samuel Dolin but\nlater dropped out of school to perform in dance bands. In 1950, he moved to the\nUnited States, where he played with big bands including those of Sonny Dunham\nand Jimmy Dorsey. In 1955, he returned to Toronto where he formed a quartet and\nlater a quintet. He recorded [[Swinging Shepherd Blues]] in 1957 which helped\nestablish his reputation as a flautist and ranked him alongside Herbie Mann and\nYusef Lateef and later Jeremy Steig as great influential jazz flute players.\n\"Swinging Shepherd Blues\" was a hit in the United States, reaching #23 on the\nBillboard pop chart.\n\nKoffman was inspired by Rahsaan Roland Kirk to play multiple instruments at\nonce; and had a modified set of straps to hold a tenor and an alto saxophone\nso that he could put forward incredible chords and improvise at the same time.\nOne of the more famous session musicians in Toronto, he appeared in countless\ncommercials, background music, and film and TV soundtracks. Most work on bass\nflute in Canadian soundtracks from 1950 to 1990 in Toronto sessions was done\nby Koffman on this rare instrument. Koffman was also an exponent of circular\nbreathing techniques for his large volumes of sound, and joined fellow\nCanadian Maynard Ferguson and new age multi-instrumentalist musician Ron Allen\nin this talent.\n\nDuring the 1970s, Koffman recorded several popular albums with arrangements of\nworks by classical composers including Bach, Mozart and Vivaldi. He also was a\nguest performer with a number of symphony orchestras across Canada.\n\nHe performed with Dizzy Gillespie and Peter Appleyard during the 1980s. He often\nperformed with Rob McConnell's Boss Brass. From 1956 to 1990, Koffman booked\nperformers for George's Spaghetti House in Toronto, where he performed weekly.\nHis compositions \"Curried Soul\" and \"Koff Drops\" have been used as the opening\nand closing themes respectively for the CBC radio show [[As It Happens]] for\nover 30 years, and are consequently probably his best-known recordings.\n\nKoffman died of cancer in Orangeville, Ontario in 2001 at the age of 72. He had\nbeen diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma about a year earlier. Some of his\nmusic for Duke Street Records remains unreleased; however Music for the Night\nwas released and re-issued in 2007, and Devil's Brew was re-issued in 2009.\n\nHe was appointed to the Order of Canada in 1993 and inducted into the Canadian\nMusic Hall of Fame in 1997. In 2002, Moe Koffman was a\n[http://www.avtrust.ca/mw/mw.php?display&en&52 MasterWorks honouree (video\nclip)] by the Audio-Visual Preservation Trust of
