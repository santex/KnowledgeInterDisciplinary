His main discoveries include those of\nelectromagnetic induction, diamagnetism and electrolysis.\n\nAlthough Faraday received little formal education he was one of the most\ninfluential scientists in history, and historians of\nscience refer to him as having been the best experimentalist in the\nhistory of science. [http://www.bath.ac.uk/news/2006/10/25/gulp-\nford251006.html \"best experimentalist in the history of science.\"] Quoting Dr\nPeter Ford, from the University of Bathâs Department of Physics. Accessed\nJanuary 2007. It was by his research on the magnetic field around a\nconductor carrying a direct current that Faraday established the basis for the\nconcept of the electromagnetic field in physics. Faraday also established that\nmagnetism could affect rays of light and that there was an underlying\nrelationship between the two phenomena.

[http://www.theiet.org/about/libarc/archiv-\nes/biographies/faraday.cfm \"Archives Biographies: Michael Faraday\", The\nInstitution of Engineering and Technology.] He similarly discovered the\nprinciple of electromagnetic induction, diamagnetism, and the laws of\nelectrolysis. His inventions of electromagnetic rotary devices formed the\nfoundation of electric motor technology, and it was largely due to his efforts\nthat electricity became practical for use in technology.\n\nAs a chemist, Faraday discovered benzene, investigated the clathrate hydrate\nof chlorine, invented an early form of the Bunsen burner and the system of\noxidation numbers, and popularised terminology such as anode, cathode,\nelectrode, and ion. Faraday ultimately became the first and foremost\nFullerian Professor of Chemistry at the Royal Institution of Great Britain, a\nlifetime position.\n\nFaraday was an excellent experimentalist who conveyed his ideas in clear and\nsimple language; his mathematical abilities, however, did not extend as far as\ntrigonometry or any but the simplest algebra. James Clerk Maxwell took the work\nof Faraday and others, and summarized it in a set of equations that is accepted\nas the basis of all modern theories of electromagnetic phenomena. On Faraday's\nuses of the lines of force, Maxwell wrote that they show Faraday \"to have been\nin reality a mathematician of a very high order â one from whom the\nmathematicians of the future may derive valuable and fertile methods.\" [http://books.google.com/books?id=RaqhIhxqLiwC&pg=PA360&lp-\ng=PA360&dq=%22to+have+been+in+reality+a+mathematician%22 The Scientific Papers\nof James Clerk Maxwell Volume 1] page 360; Courier Dover 2003, ISBN 0-486-49560-\n4 The SI unit of capacitance, the farad, is named in his honour.\n\nAlbert Einstein kept a picture of Faraday on his study wall, alongside pictures\nof Isaac Newton and James Clerk Maxwell. \"Einstein's Heroes: Imagining the\nWorld through the Language of Mathematics\", by Robyn Arianrhod UQP, reviewed by\nJane Gleeson-White, 10 November 2003, The Sydney Morning Herald. Physicist\nErnest Rutherford stated; \"When we consider the magnitude and extent of his\ndiscoveries and their influence on the progress of science and of industry,\nthere is no honour too great to pay to the memory of Faraday, one of the\ngreatest scientific discoverers of all time\".
