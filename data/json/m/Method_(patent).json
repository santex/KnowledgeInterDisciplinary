{"cursor":"3460","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In United States patent law, a 'method', also called \"process\", is one of the\nfour principal categories of things that may be patented through \"utility\npatents\". The other three are a machine, an article of manufacture (also termed\na manufacture), and a composition of matter.\n\nIn that context, a method is a process, or series of steps or acts, for\nperforming a function or accomplishing a result. See Gottschalk v. Benson,\n409 U.S. 63, 70 (1972) (âA process is a mode of treatment of certain materials\nto produce a given result. It is an act, or a series of acts, performed upon the\nsubject-matter to be transformed and reduced to a different state or thing.â).\nSee also In re Kollar, 286 F.3d 1326, 1332 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (â[A]\nprocess...consists of a series of acts or steps.... It consists of doing\nsomething, and therefore has to be carried out or performed.â). The terms\nare largely interchangeable, Thus section 100(b) of the US patent act, 35\nU.S.C. sec. 100(b), states, \"The term 'process' means process, art, or method,\nand includes a new use of a known process....\" but \"process\" usually\nrefers to a manufacturing processâa series of steps for making something, while\na \"method\" usually refers to a way of using a product to accomplish a given\nresult. Thus, one might speak of a process for making soap or candles, or speak\nof a method for curing headaches comprising administering a therapeutically\neffective dosage of aspirin.\n\nNot all methods, in the dictionary sense, are methods for purposes of United\nStates patent law. The case law \"forecloses a purely literal reading of Â§\n101.\" Parker v. Flook, 437 U.S. 584, 589 (1978). In Gottschalk v. Benson,\n409 U.S. 63, 64 (1973), the Court said, \"The question is whether the method\ndescribed and claimed is a 'process' within the meaning of the Patent Act.\" See\nalso In re Bilski (\"But the Supreme Court has held that the meaning of 'process'\nas used in Â§ 101 is narrower than its ordinary meaning.\"). The concept is\nelaborated in the article Machine-or-transformation test.\n\nPreviously, a method patent claim could be infringed only when a single person\nor entity practices all claimed steps. \"[A] method claim is only infringed\nwhen a single party can be charged with performing each step of the asserted\nclaim.\" Muniauction v. Thomson Corp. and i-Deal, (Fed. Cir. 2008) [http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/opinions/07-\n1485.pdf opinion] Neither a physical device, such as a product that can be\nused to practice the method, nor instructions for practicing the method, are\ninfringing until they are used by a single person to perform all the steps\ntogether. This rule was changed in Akamai Tech. v. Limelight Networks (Fed. Cir.\n2012).  Akamai Tech. v. Limelight Networks (Fed. Cir. 2012) [http://http://www.ipwatchdog.com/2012/09/04/cafcs-joint-infringement-\nconundrum-p1/id=27774/ ipwatchdog review of decision]\n","linknr":92,"url":"Method_(patent)","recorded":1362478003,"links":11,"instances":["patent"],"pdf":["http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/opinions/07-1485.pdf"],"categories":["United States patent law"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["machine","patent"]],"members":["machine"],"related":["United_States_patent_law","Machine_(patent)","Article_of_manufacture","Composition_of_matter","Case_law","Parker_v._Flook","Gottschalk_v._Benson","In_re_Bilski","Machine-or-transformation_test"]}
