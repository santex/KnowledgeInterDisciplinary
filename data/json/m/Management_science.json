{"cursor":"36592","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Operations research', or 'operational research' in British usage, is a\ndiscipline that deals with the application of advanced analytical methods to\nhelp make better decisions. It is often considered to be a sub-field\nof mathematics. The terms 'management science' and 'decision science'\nare sometimes used as more modern-sounding synonyms.\n\nEmploying techniques from other mathematical sciences, such as mathematical\nmodeling, statistical analysis, and mathematical optimization, operations\nresearch arrives at optimal or near-optimal solutions to complex decision-making\nproblems. Because of its emphasis on human-technology interaction and because of\nits focus on practical applications, operations research has overlap with other\ndisciplines, notably industrial engineering and operations management, and draws\non psychology and organization science. Operations Research is often concerned\nwith determining the maximum (of profit, performance, or yield) or minimum (of\nloss, risk, or cost) of some real-world objective. Originating in military\nefforts before World War II, its techniques have grown to concern problems in a\nvariety of industries.
