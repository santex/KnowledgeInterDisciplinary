The\nEnglish word \"manse\" originally defined a property large enough for the parish\npriest to maintain himself, but a mansion is no longer self-sustaining in this\nway (compare a Roman or medieval villa). 'Manor' comes from the same root&mdash;\nterritorial holdings granted to a lord who would remain there&mdash; hence it is\neasy to see how the word 'Mansion' came to have its meaning. Within a Roman\ncity, patrician dwellings might be very extensive, but they rarely identified\ntheir grandeur to the street, beyond the public amenity of a sheltered portico.\nNero's Domus Aurea on the Palatine Hill, Rome was organized as a series of\nglittering pavilions in gardens rather than a mansion.\n\nFollowing the fall of Rome the practice of building unfortified villas ceased.\nToday, the oldest inhabited mansions around the world usually began their\nexistence as fortified castles in the middle ages. As social conditions slowly\nchanged and stabilised fortifications were able to be reduced, and over the\ncenturies gave way to comfort. It became fashionable and possible for homes to\nbe beautiful rather than grim and forbidding. Hence the modern mansion began\nto evolve.\n\nIn British English a 'mansion block' refers to a block of flats or apartments.\nIn many parts of Asia, including Hong Kong and Japan, the word 'mansion' also\nrefers to a block of apartments.\n",
