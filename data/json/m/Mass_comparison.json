It is now usually\ncalled 'multilateral comparison'. The method is rejected by most linguists\n, though not all.\n\nIn spite of widespread skepticism about his method, some of the relationships\nestablished by Greenberg gradually came to be generally accepted (e.g. Afro-\nAsiatic and NigerâCongo). Others are widely accepted though disputed by some\n(e.g. Nilo-Saharan), others are predominantly rejected but have some defenders\n(e.g. Khoisan), while others continue to be widely rejected and have only a\nhandful of defenders (e.g. Amerind).\n\nThe application of mass comparison led Greenberg not only to propose novel\nclassifications but to break apart previously accepted ones. The best-known\nexample is his rejection of the Hamitic language family.\n","linknr":215,"url":"Mass_comparison","recorded":1362671216,"links":21,"instances":["linguistics","philologist"],"pdf":["http://www.nostratic.ru/books/(270)beyond-lumping-and-splitting.pdf","http://www.billposer.org/Papers/iephm.pdf","http://www.uaf.edu/anlc/docs/dy_vajda_perspective.pdf","http://starling.rinet.ru/Texts/khoisan.pdf","http://www.nostratic.ru/books/(316)gell-starostin-jlr1.pdf"],"categories":["Historical linguistics","Language comparison"],"headings":["Theory of mass comparison","The disputed legacy of the comparative method","Toward a resolution of the conflict?","Bibliography","External links","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/Unbalanced_scales.svg/45px-Unbalanced_scales.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["genetic_relationship","linguistics"],["william_jones","philologist"]],"members":["genetic_relationship","william_jones"],"related":["Joseph_Greenberg","Genetic_relationship_(linguistics)","Afro-Asiatic_languages","Niger–Congo_languages","Nilo-Saharan_languages","Khoisan_languages","Amerind_languages","Hamitic_languages","Linguistic_typology","Empiricism","Linguistic_typology","Indo-European_languages","Comparative_linguistics","Comparative_method","Spanish_language","Italian_language","Latin","Indo-European_languages","Uralic_languages","Algonquian_languages","Bantu_languages","Rasmus_Christian_Rask","Jacob_Grimm","Grimm's_law","Karl_Verner","Verner's_law","August_Schleicher","Franz_Bopp","Karl_Brugmann","Neogrammarian","Berthold_Delbrück","William_Jones_(philologist)","Semitic_languages","Finno-Ugric_languages","Dravidian_languages","Robert_Caldwell","Eskimo–Aleut_languages","Afro-Asiatic_languages","Sino-Tibetan_languages","Anatolian_languages","Lydian_language","R.L._Trask","Hittite_language","Analogy","Nostratic_languages","Edward_Vajda","Dené–Yeniseian_languages","Johanna_Nichols","Georgiy_Starostin","Inspection"]}
