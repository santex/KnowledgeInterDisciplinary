The most common\nuse is in reference to natural earthen formation such as hills and mountains,\nparticularly if they appear artificial. The term may also be applied to any\nrounded area of topographically higher elevation on any surface. Artificial\nmounds have been created for a variety of reasons throughout history, including\nceremonial (platform mound), burial (tumulus), and commemorative purposes (e.g.\nKościuszko Mound).\n",
