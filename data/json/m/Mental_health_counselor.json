Research showed that these Master's degree level\ncounselors were successful in treating mental health issues. Counseling is\ngrounded in Developmental Theory and the counseling profession had its etiologic\nunderpinnings in prevention and wellness (Juntunen & Atkinson, 2001). James\nMessina, Gary Seiler and others came together to form the 'American Mental\nHealth Counselors Association' (AMHCA) in 1976.\n\nIn a few short years the association grew to over 12,000 members with a\nprofessional journal, newsletter, national meetings, state branches and a\ncertification process for the Certified Clinical Mental Health Counselor (CCMHC)\ncredential in 1979. Early efforts included the recognition by third party payers\nand state licensure for MHCs. These early goals have for the most part been met\nand AMHCA remains a viable professional organization.\n\nIn 1981, Artis J. Palmo developed a manuscript for the AMHCA Board of Directors\nwhich in part described the evolving role of the MHC. The counselor collected\ndata to assess the clientâs mental and emotional and/or behavioral problems or\nbehavioral disorders and helped clients to effectively adapt to the concerns\npresented. In later writings authors such as Hershenson and Strein (1991); and\nPalmo, Shosh and Weikel (2001) emphasized that MHCs are concerned about the\nclientâs environment with a more global view than other professionals as well as\na concern that goes beyond treating dysfunction or pathology and dealing with\nthe clientsâ self-awareness, personal growth, and wellness.\n\nSeiler, Brooks and Beck (1987) delivered the first Training Standards for\nMental Health Counselors (60 hours) which established this profession as the\nClinical Identity for the Council for Accreditation of Counseling and Related\nEducational Programs (CACREP). Though slow to accept, by the beginning of 2000,\nthe standard was pretty much accepted universally for clinical applications.\nWhile the 60 credit Master's program has become the standard for Mental Health\nCounselor training (at least for those seeking a pre-licensure program), there\nis currently only one state which requires CACREP accreditation specifically\n(New Jersey).\n\nAs Brooks and Weikel (1996) and later Smith and Weikel (2006) have pointed out,\nthe profession can trace its roots through several historical antecedents\nculminating in the shift to community based treatment and the need for a cadre\nof professionals to deliver counseling services in a cost-efficient manner. The\nMHC of the 2000s can be found in a variety of employment including mental health\ncenters, hospitals, clinics, colleges and universities and private practices. As\nthe profession continues to grow and evolve, more entities such as third party\npayers, public policy makers as well as members of the general public are\nrealizing the effectiveness of the professional MHC.\n","linknr":154,"url":"Mental_health_counselor","recorded":1363187420,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Mental_health_counselor&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Mental_health_counselor&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:INCITE","/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Fact_and_Reference_Check","/wiki/Wikipedia:When_to_cite","/wiki/Mental_health","/wiki/Psychoeducation","/wiki/Master%E2%80%99s_degree","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Dates_and_numbers#Chronological_items","/w/index.php?title=Certified_Clinical_Mental_Health_Counselor&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Abnormality_(behavior)","/wiki/Pathology","/wiki/Self-awareness","/wiki/Personal_growth","/wiki/Wellness_(alternative_medicine)","/w/index.php?title=Council_for_Accreditation_of_Counseling_and_Related_Educational_Programs&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Community","/wiki/Hospital","/wiki/Clinic","/wiki/College","/wiki/Universities","/wiki/Medical_practice","#Description_of_duties","#See_also","#References","#Sources","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Mental_health_counselor&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Social_workers","/wiki/Psychologist","/wiki/Nurse_practitioner","/wiki/Psychiatrist","/wiki/Human","/wiki/Families","/wiki/Group_therapy","/wiki/Mental_disorder","/wiki/Therapy","/wiki/Depression_(mood)","/wiki/Substance_dependence","/wiki/Substance_abuse","/wiki/Suicide","/wiki/Stress_(biological)","/wiki/Self-esteem","/wiki/Grief","/wiki/Career","/wiki/Education","/wiki/Parenting","/wiki/Marriage","/wiki/Interpersonal_relationship","/wiki/Psychiatric_nurses","/wiki/School_counselors","/wiki/US_state","#cite_note-bls-1","#cite_note-therapistnyc-2","/w/index.php?title=Mental_health_counselor&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/List_of_counseling_topics","/wiki/Mental_health_professional","/wiki/Psychotherapist","/wiki/Nonviolent_communication","/wiki/Social_worker","/wiki/Psychologist","/wiki/Psychiatrist","/wiki/Occupational_therapist","/wiki/Expressive_therapy","/wiki/Behavior_Therapy","/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy","/wiki/Rational_emotive_behavior_therapy","/wiki/Dialectical_behavioral_therapy","/w/index.php?title=Mental_health_counselor&action=edit&section=3","#cite_ref-bls_1-0","http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos067.htm","/wiki/United_States_Bureau_of_Labor_Statistics","#cite_ref-therapistnyc_2-0","http://www.therapistnyc.us/2012/06/01/nyc-therapist-news-reviewing-psychotherapy-licensure-laws-york/","/w/index.php?title=Mental_health_counselor&action=edit&section=4","/w/index.php?title=Mental_health_counselor&action=edit&section=5","http://www.counseling.org/","http://www.amhca.org/","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mental_health_counselor&oldid=515917595","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Mental_health","/wiki/Category:Counseling","/wiki/Category:Psychiatry-related_fields","/wiki/Category:Articles_lacking_in-text_citations_from_January_2009","/wiki/Category:All_articles_lacking_in-text_citations","/wiki/Category:All_articles_with_unsourced_statements","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_unsourced_statements_from_August_2011","/wiki/Category:Vague_or_ambiguous_time_from_August_2011","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Mental+health+counselor&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Mental+health+counselor","/wiki/Mental_health_counselor","/wiki/Talk:Mental_health_counselor","#","/wiki/Mental_health_counselor","/w/index.php?title=Mental_health_counselor&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Mental_health_counselor&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wi
