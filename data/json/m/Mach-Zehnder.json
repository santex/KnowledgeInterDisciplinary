The\ninterferometer has been used, amongst other things, to measure small phase\nshifts in one of the two beams caused by a small sample or the change in length\nof one of the paths. The apparatus is named after the physicists Ludwig Mach\n(the son of Ernst Mach) and Ludwig Zehnder.\n\nThe Michelson interferometer is a MachâZehnder interferometer that has been\nfolded back upon itself. The principal difference is that in the Michelson\ninterferometer, the beam splitting optic is also used to recombine the beams.\n","linknr":127,"url":"Mach-Zehnder","recorded":1362509892,"links":20,"instances":["physics","wave_propagation","waves","physics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Interferometers"],"headings":["How it works","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2d/Mach-zender-interferometer.png/230px-Mach-zender-interferometer.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/c/d/5cdfe45a06078765ff2e941362ad9367.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/Interferometre_de_Mach-Zender_paradoxe.svg/750px-Interferometre_de_Mach-Zender_paradoxe.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["phase","waves"],["coherence","physics"],["reflection","physics"],["interference","wave_propagation"]],"members":["coherence","interference","phase","reflection"],"related":["Phase_(waves)","Collimated","Coherence_(physics)","Ernst_Mach","Ludwig_Zehnder","Michelson_interferometer","Half-silvered_mirror","Mirror","Reflection_(physics)","Refraction","Wavelength","The_speed_of_light_in_vacuum","Interference_(wave_propagation)","Interferometer","Elitzur–Vaidman_bomb-tester","Time-bin_encoding","Jamin_interferometer","Classical_interference_microscopy","Dual_polarisation_interferometry","Schlieren","Schlieren_photography","Shadowgraph"]}
