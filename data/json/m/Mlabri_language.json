Linguist JÃ¸rgen Rischel has studied the language and described its\npeculiarities in several works. He divides the language into three varieties:\none spoken by a small group in Laos and previously called Yumbri, and two others\nspoken by larger groups in Thailand. They differ in intonation and in lexicon.\n\nAlthough it is possible to count up to ten in Mlabri, only the numerals one and\ntwo may be used to modify a noun, and the word for 'two' has uses closer to\n'pair' or 'couple' in English than a numeral.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Mlabri_language","recorded":1372152242,"links":[],"instances":["phonology","linguistics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Languages of Thailand","Khmuic languages","Languages of Laos"],"headings":["Phonology","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["intonation","linguistics"],["register","phonology"]],"members":["register","intonation"],"related":["Thailand","Laos","Khmuic_languages","Mlabri_people","Thailand","Laos","Khmuic_languages","Austroasiatic_languages","Linguistics","Jørgen_Rischel","Intonation_(linguistics)","Lexicon","Back_vowel","Register_(phonology)","Vowel_length","Epenthetic","Minor_syllable","Jørgen_Rischel","Jørgen_Rischel","Lexicography_Conference","Chiangmai","Jørgen_Rischel"]}
