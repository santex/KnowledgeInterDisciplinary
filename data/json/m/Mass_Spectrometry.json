{"cursor":"59711","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Mass spectrometry' (MS) is the science of displaying the [[spectrum|spectra]]\n(singular spectrum) of the masses of the molecules comprising a sample of\nmaterial. It is used for determining the elemental composition of a sample, the\nmasses of particles and of molecules, and for elucidating the chemical\nstructures of molecules, such as peptides and other chemical compounds. Mass\nspectrometry works by ionizing chemical compounds to generate charged molecules\nor molecule fragments and measuring their mass-to-charge ratios. In a typical MS procedure:\n# A sample (which may be solid, liquid, or gas) is ionized. The ions are\n# separated according to their mass-to-charge ratio. This is the key step.  The ions are dynamically detected by some\n# mechanism capable of detecting energetic charged particles. The signal is\n# processed into the [[spectrum|spectra]] (singular spectrum) of the masses of\n# the particles of that sample.\nThe elements or molecules are identified by correlating known masses by the\nidentified masses.\n\nA mass spectrometer instrument will consist of four modules:\n\n1. An [[ion source|ionizer]] converts some portion of the sample into ions.\n   There are a wide variety of techniques for this, depending on the phase\n   (solid, liquid, gas) of the sample, and the efficiency of various ionization\n   mechanisms for the target species in question. Mass spectrometers are\n   generally named after the ion source used. Some examples are:\n* Electron ionization\n* Glow discharge mass spectrometry (GDMS)\n* ICPMS\n* Resonant ionization mass spectrometry (RIMS)\n* SIMS\n* TIMS\n2. An extraction system which removes ions from the sample and gives them a\n   trajectory which allows the mass analyser to transmit them.\n\n3. A mass analyzer sorts the ions by mass. Methods used include:\n*  Magnetic sector\n* Quadrupole\n* Time of flight\n4. A detector, which measures the value of an indicator quantity and thus\n   provides data for calculating the abundances of each ion present. Some\n   detectors also give spacial information, e.g. a multichannel plate. The\n   technique has both qualitative and quantitative uses. These include\n   identifying unknown compounds, determining the isotopic composition of\n   elements in a molecule, and determining the structure of a compound by\n   observing its fragmentation. Other uses include quantifying the amount of a\n   compound in a sample or studying the fundamentals of gas phase ion chemistry\n   (the chemistry of ions and neutrals in a vacuum). MS is now in very common\n   use in analytical laboratories that study physical, chemical, or biological\n   properties of a great variety of compounds.\n","linknr":951,"url":"Mass_Spectrometry","recorded":1362507641,"links":64,"instances":["chemistry","moon","chemistry","moon","mass_spectrometry","spacecraft","linguistics","database"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Chemical
