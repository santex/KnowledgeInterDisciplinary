A typical permanent marker consists of\na container (glass, aluminum or plastic) and a core of an absorbent material\nsuch as felt. This filling serves as a carrier for the water-proof ink. The\nupper part of the marker contains the nib that was made in earlier time of a\nhard felt material, and a cap to prevent the marker from drying out. Until the\nearly 1990s the most common solvents that were used for the ink were toluene and\nxylene. These two substances are both harmful and characterized by a very strong\nsmell. Today, the ink is usually made on the basis of alcohols (e.g. 1-propanol,\n1-butanol, diacetone alcohol and cresols).\n","linknr":283,"url":"Marker_pen","recorded":1362676203,"links":46,"instances":["marker"],"pdf":["http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Module-6.pdf","http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Module-6.pdf"],"categories":["American inventions","Pens","Stationery"],"headings":["History","Types","Dialectal variations","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/79/Crayola-Markers.jpg/220px-Crayola-Markers.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2d/Marker1.jpg/220px-Marker1.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/d4/Marker_pen.JPG/220px-Marker_pen.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/db/Symbol_list_class.svg/16px-Symbol_list_class.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["sharpie","marker"]],"members":["sharpie"],"related":["Pen","Ink","Felt","Toluene","Xylene","1-propanol","1-butanol","Diacetone_alcohol","Cresols","Sidney_Rosenthal","Permanent_marker","Highlighter","Overhead_projector","Whiteboard","Xylene","Toluene","Wet_erase_marker","Security","Fluorescence","Burglary","Ultraviolet_light","Election_ink","Photosensitive","Silver_nitrate","Cuticle","Electoral_fraud","Vaccination","Developing_country","Refugee","Felt","Ceramic","Technical_drawing","Genericized_trademark","India","Malaysia","Singapore","Philippines","Indonesia","South_Korea","Japan","Australia","Genericized_trademark","Permanent_marker","Spanish-speaking_countries","Romania","Genericized_trademark","Sharpie_(marker)","Highlighter","List_of_pen_types,_brands_and_companies","Paint_marker","Permanent_marker"]}
