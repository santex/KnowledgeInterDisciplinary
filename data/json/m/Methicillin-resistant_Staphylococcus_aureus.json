{"cursor":"87676","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n of 'MRSA']] '[[Methicillin]]-resistantStaphylococcus aureus' ('MRSA') is a\n bacterium responsible for several difficult-to-treat infections in humans. It\n is also called 'multidrug-resistantStaphylococcus aureus' and 'oxacillin-\n resistantStaphylococcus aureus' (ORSA). MRSA is any strain of [[Staphylococcus\n aureus]] that has developed, through the process of natural selection,\n resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics, which include the penicillins\n (methicillin, dicloxacillin, nafcillin, oxacillin, etc.) and the\n cephalosporins. Strains unable to resist these antibiotics are classified as\n methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, or MSSA. The evolution of such\n resistance does not cause the organism to be more intrinsically virulent than\n strains of Staphylococcus aureus that have no antibiotic resistance, but\n resistance does make MRSA infection more difficult to treat with standard types\n of antibiotics and thus more dangerous.\n\nMRSA is especially troublesome in hospitals, prisons, schools, and nursing\nhomes, where patients with open wounds, invasive devices, and weakened immune\nsystems are at greater risk of infection than the general public.\n","linknr":1225,"url":"Methicillin-resistant_Staphylococcus_aureus","recorded":1362501033,"links":67,"instances":["country","medicine","chemistry","biology"],"pdf":["http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmselect/cmcomloc/636/636.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20070711030535/http://www.tufts.edu/med/apua/Patients/ridbooklet.pdf","http://www.tufts.edu/med/apua/Patients/ridbooklet.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20070711030535/http://www.tufts.edu/med/apua/Patients/ridbooklet.pdf","http://www.efsa.europa.eu/EFSA/Report/biohaz_report_301_joint_mrsa_en,0.pdf","http://www.efsa.europa.eu/EFSA/Report/biohaz_report_301_joint_mrsa_en,0.pdf","http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dhqp/pdf/ar/mdroGuideline2006.pdf","http://www.tpchd.org/files/library/2357adf2a147d1aa.pdf","http://www.tpchd.org/files/library/2357adf2a147d1aa.pdf","http://www.springerlink.com/content/p65r2660651u7k76/fulltext.pdf","http://www.springerlink.com/content/p65r2660651u7k76/fulltext.pdf","http://mrsa-research-center.bsd.uchicago.edu/JAMA_02_25_1998_issue.pdf"],"categories":["Staphylococcaceae","Bacterial
