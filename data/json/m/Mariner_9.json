Mariner 9\nwas launched toward Mars on May 30, 1971 from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station and reached the\nplanet on November 14 of the same year, becoming the first spacecraft to orbit another planet â only narrowly beating Soviet Mars 2 and Mars 3, which\nboth arrived within a month. After months of dust-storms it managed to send back\nclear pictures of the surface.\n\nMariner 9 returned 7329 images over the course of its mission, which concluded\nin October 1972.
