{"cursor":"4152","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Mycoremediation', a phrase coined by Paul Stamets, is a form of bioremediation,\nthe process of using fungi to degrade or sequester contaminants in the\nenvironment. Stimulating microbial and enzyme activity, mycelium reduces toxins\nin-situ. Some fungi are hyperaccumulators, capable of absorbing and\nconcentrating heavy metals in the mushroom fruit bodies.\n\nOne of the primary roles of fungi in the ecosystem is decomposition, which is\nperformed by the mycelium. The mycelium secretes extracellular enzymes and acids\nthat break down lignin and cellulose, the two main building blocks of plant\nfiber. These are organic compounds composed of long chains of carbon and\nhydrogen, structurally similar to many organic pollutants. The key to\nmycoremediation is determining the right fungal species to target a specific\npollutant. Certain strains have been reported to successfully degrade the nerve\ngases VX and sarin.\n\n'')]] In an experiment conducted in conjunction with Dr. S. A. Thomas, a major\ncontributor in the bioremediation industry, a plot of soil contaminated with\ndiesel was inoculated with mycelia of oyster mushrooms; traditional\nbioremediation techniques (bacteria) were used on control plots. After four\nweeks, more than 95% of many of the PAH (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) had\nbeen reduced to non-toxic components in the mycelial-inoculated plots. It\nappears that the natural microbial community participates with the fungi to\nbreak down contaminants, eventually into carbon dioxide and water. Wood-decay\nfungi are particularly effective in breaking down aromatic pollutants (toxic\ncomponents of petroleum), as well as chlorinated compounds (certain persistent\npesticides; Battelle, 2000).\n\nThe concept of mycoremediation was explored in the 1984 film NausicaÃ¤ of the\nValley of the Wind, where vast tracts of fungal forest rehabilitate the planet\nafter catastrophic human polluting and apocalypse.\n\nMycofiltration is a similar process, using fungal mycelia to filter toxic waste\nand microorganisms from water in soil.\n","linknr":130,"url":"Mycoremediation","recorded":1362507356,"links":19,"instances":["film","nerve_agent"],"pdf":["http://sbli.ls.manchester.ac.uk/fungi/21st_Century_Guidebook_to_Fungi/REPRINT_collection/Gadd_biogeochemistry.pdf","http://dungenessrivercenter.org/documents/FinalMycoremediationReport_000.pdf","http://www.ajebs.com/vol6/27.pdf"],"categories":["Bioremediation","Biotechnology","Environmental soil science","Mycology","Ecological restoration"],"headings":["References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/24/Austernseitling.jpg/220px-Austernseitling.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/Sustainable_development.svg/32px-Sustainable_development.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["vx","nerve_agent"],["nausicaä_of_the_valley_of_the_wind","film"]],"members":["nausicaä_of_the_valley_of_the_wind","vx"],"related":["Paul_Stamets","Bioremediation","Fungi","Ecosystem","Microbial","Enzyme","Mycelium","Toxin","Heavy_metals","Mushroom","Ecosystem","Decomposition","Acid","Lignin","Cellulose","Plant","Carbon","Hydrogen","Nerve_gas","VX_(nerve_agent)","Sarin","S._A._Thomas","Soil","Diesel_fuel","Oyster_mushroom","Polycyclic_aromatic_hydrocarbon","Carbon_dioxide","Water","Wood-decay_fungus","Petroleum","Pesticides","Nausicaä_of_the_Valley_of_the_Wind_(film)","Mycofiltration","Microorganism"]}
