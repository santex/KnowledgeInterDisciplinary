Most of the rest of the DNA present in eukaryotic cells can\nbe found in the cell nucleus, and in plants, the chloroplast as well.\n\nIn humans, mitochondrial DNA can be regarded as the smallest chromosome coding\nfor only 37 genes and containing only about 16,600 base pairs. Human\nmitochondrial DNA was the first significant part of the human genome to be\nsequenced. In most species, including humans, mtDNA is inherited solely from the\nmother.\n\nThe DNA sequence of mtDNA has been determined from a large number of organisms\nand individuals (including some organisms that are extinct), and the comparison\nof those DNA sequences represents a mainstay of phylogenetics, in that it allows\nbiologists to elucidate the evolutionary relationships among species. It also\npermits an examination of the relatedness of populations, and so has become\nimportant in anthropology and field biology.\n","linknr":674,"url":"MtDNA","recorded":1362373515,"links":59,"instances":["journal","journal","genetic"],"pdf":["http://www.clinsci.org/cs/107/0355/1070355.pdf","http://www.clinsci.org/cs/107/0355/1070355.pdf","http://pliki.supernova.com.pl/CELLFOOD/BADANIA/THE_MITOCHONDRIAL_FREE_RADICAL_THEORY_OF_AGING.pdf","http://www.jcb.org/cgi/reprint/19/3/593.pdf","http://www.jcb.org/cgi/reprint/19/3/593.pdf","http://www.biozentrum.unibas.ch/emeritus/schatz/pdf/Schatz_BBRC_1964.pdf"],"categories":["DNA","Mitochondrial genetics","Senescence"],"headings":["Origin","Mitochondrial inheritance","Structure","Replication","Mutations","Use in identification","History","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/Mitochondrial_DNA_en.svg/300px-Mitochondrial_DNA_en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/Electron_microscopy_reveals_mitochondrial_DNA_in_discrete_foci.jpg/220px-Electron_microscopy_reveals_mitochondrial_DNA_in_discrete_foci.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6e/Mitochondrial_DNA_and_diseases.svg/220px-Mitochondrial_DNA_and_diseases.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/62/Mol_Anth_Ico.PNG/20px-Mol_Anth_Ico.PNG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/Tree_of_life.svg/32px-Tree_of_life.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["science","journal"],["mitochondrial_dna","journal"],["supercluster","genetic"]],"members":["science","mitochondrial_dna","supercluster"],"related":["DNA","Organelle","Mitochondrion","Eukaryotic","Adenosine_triphosphate","Cell_nucleus","Chromosome","Human_mitochondrial_DNA","Human_genome","Phylogenetics","Evolutionary","Anthropology","Evolution","Circular_DNA","Bacteria","Endosymbiotic_theory","Mammal","Nuclear_DNA","Eukaryotic","Evolution","Metazoans","Sperm","Sexual_reproduction","Ubiquitin","Embryo","Oocyte","Matrilineality","Y_chromosome","Agnate","Human_mitochondrial_DNA","Hypervariable_control_region","Genealogical_DNA_test","Cambridge_Reference_Sequence","Science_(journal)","Mitochondrial_Eve","Human","Phylogeny","Evolutionary_tree","Genetic_genealogy","Paternal_mtDNA_transmission","Mussel","Drosophila","Honeybee","Magicicada","DNA","Ciliate","Green_alga","DNA","Telomerase","Telomere","DNA","Pathogen","Human_mitochondrial_DNA","Metazoans","Spermatozoon","Molecule","Base_pair","Transfer_RNA","Ribosomal_RNA","DNA_replication","DNA_polymerase","PEO1","SSB_protein","PEO1","Helicase","Embryogenesis","Blastocyst","Trophectoderm","Inner_cell_mass","Cell_signaling","Cellular_differentiation","Reactive_oxygen_species","Respiratory_chain","DNA_repair","Exercise_intolerance","Kearns-Sayre_syndrome","Aging-associated_diseases","Prostate_biopsy","Reactive_oxygen_species","Superoxide_dismutase","Catalase","Glutathione_peroxidase","Gene_therapy","Nutraceutical","Genetic_recombination","Mutation_rate","Matrilineage","Effective_population_size","Phylogenetics","Mutation_rate","Electron_microscope","Hans_Tuppy","Gottfried_Schatz","Hans_Tuppy","Gottfried_Schatz","Medical_faculty","University_of_Vienna","Vienna","Austria","Archaeogenetics_of_the_Near_East","CORR_Hypothesis","Haplogroup","Heteroplasmy","Human_mitochondrial_DNA_haplogroup","Human_mitochondrial_genetics","Mitochondrial_disease","Mitochondrial_DNA_(journal)","Mitochondrial_Eve","Cambridge_Reference_Sequence","Paternal_mtDNA_transmission","Single_origin_theory","Supercluster_(genetic)","TIM/TOM_Complex","Genetic_history_of_Africa","Genetic_history_of_Europe","Genetic_history_of_the_British_Isles","Genetic_history_of_the_Iberian_Peninsula","Genetic_history_of_indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas","Genetic_history_of_Italy","Genetic_history_of_North_Africa","Genetics_and_archaeogenetics_of_South_Asia"]}
