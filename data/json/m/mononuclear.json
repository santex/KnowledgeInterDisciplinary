Monocytes play multiple roles in immune function.\nSuch roles include: (1) replenish resident macrophages and dendritic cells\nunder normal states, and (2) in response to inflammation signals, monocytes can\nmove quickly (approx. 8â12 hours) to sites of infection in the tissues and\ndivide/differentiate into macrophages and dendritic cells to elicit an immune\nresponse. Half of them are stored in the spleen.
