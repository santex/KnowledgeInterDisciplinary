{"cursor":"12362","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'model figure' is a scale model representing a human, monster or other\ncreature. Human figures may be either a generic figure of a type (such as \"World\nWar II Luftwaffe pilot\"), a historical personage (such as \"King Henry VIII\"), or\na fictional character (such as \"Conan\").\n\nModel figures are sold both as kits for enthusiast to construct and paint and as\npre-built, pre-painted collectable figurines. Model kits may be made in plastic\n(usually polystyrene), polyurethane resin, or metal (including white metal);\ncollectables are usually made of plastic, porcelain, or (rarely) bronze.\n\nThere are larger size (12-inch or 30 cm) that have been produced for recent\nmovie characters (Princess Leia from Star Wars, for example). Large plastic\nmilitary figures are made by some model soldier firms as a sideline.\n","linknr":214,"url":"Model_figure","recorded":1362374832,"links":12,"instances":["gaming","1941_film","ratio"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Scale modeling","Figurines","Toy figurines","Toy collecting"],"headings":["Military models","Japanese figures","Garage Kits","US history","Model figure collecting{{anchor|Chase figure}}","See also","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["miniature_figure","gaming"],["scale","ratio"],["the_wolf_man","1941_film"]],"members":["miniature_figure","the_wolf_man","scale"],"related":["Scale_model","World_War_II","Luftwaffe","Aviator","Henry_VIII_of_England","Conan_the_Barbarian","Figurine","Plastic","Polystyrene","Polyurethane","Resin","Metal","White_metal","Porcelain","Bronze","Star_Wars","Military_model","Miniature_figure_(gaming)","Wargaming","Role-playing_game","Scale_(ratio)","Miniature_wargaming","Model_aircraft","Model_military_vehicle","Hello_Kitty","Anime","Manga","Kaiju","Science_fiction_films","Fantasy","Films","Video_game","Otaku","Fandom","Hobbyists","Garage_kits","Gashapon","PVC","Bishōjo","Modern_art","Takashi_Murakami","Kaikai_Kiki","Designer_toys","Garage_kit","Resin_casting","Polyurethane","Resin","Anime","Monsters","Scale_model","Monster","Frankenstein","The_Wolf_Man_(1941_film)","Dracula","Creature_from_the_Black_Lagoon","Aurora_Plastics_Corporation","Action_figure","Monogram_models","Garage_kit","Bride_of_Frankenstein","Invisible_Man","The_Phantom_of_the_Opera","Captain_America","Iron_Man","Aluminum_Metal_Toys","Ertl_Company","Revell","Star_Trek","Batman","Collecting","Chase_card","Collectible_card_game","Marvel_Legends","WWE_Classics_On_Demand","Figurine","Action_figure","Toy_soldier","Model_horse"]}
