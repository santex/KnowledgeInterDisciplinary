{"cursor":"2752","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'microphone preamplifier' is a sound engineering device that prepares a\nmicrophone signal to be processed by other equipment. Microphone signals are\noften too weak to be transmitted to units such as mixing consoles and recording\ndevices with adequate quality. Preamplifiers increase a microphone signal to line-\nlevel (i.e. the level of signal strength required by such devices) by providing\nstable gain while preventing induced noise that would otherwise distort the\nsignal. Ballou, 1987, pp. 506â507.\n\nA microphone preamplifier is colloquially called a 'microphone preamp', 'mic\npreamp', 'preamp' (not to be confused with a control amplifier in high-fidelity\nreproduction equipment), 'mic pre' and 'pre'.\n","linknr":178,"url":"Microphone_preamplifier","recorded":1362897059,"links":13,"instances":["effect","audio"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Audio amplifiers","Microphones"],"headings":["Technical details","In use","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["equalization","audio"],["exciter","effect"]],"members":["exciter","equalization"],"related":["Sound_engineer","Microphone","Electrical_signal","Mixing_console","Sound_recording","Gain","Control_amplifier","High_fidelity","Decibel","Audio_recording","Live_sound","Transducer","Audio_engineer","Channel_strip","Dynamic_range_compression","Equalization_(audio)","Noise_gate","Exciter_(effect)","Indianapolis,_Indiana"]}
