It is located on the River Isar\nnorth of the Bavarian Alps. Munich is the third largest city in Germany, behind\nBerlin and Hamburg. About 1.42&nbsp;million people live within the city limits.\nMunich was the host city of the 1972 Summer Olympics. Its inhabitants are\nsometimes called Munichers in English.\n\nThe city's motto is \"{{lang|de|München mag dich}}\" (Munich loves you).<ref>[http://www.muenchen.de/rathaus/Stadtverwaltung/Referat-fuer-Arbeit-\nund-Wirtschaft/News/News-Archiv-2011/Munich-Loves-You.html Landeshauptstadt\nMünchen - München Mag Dich<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Before 2006, it\nwas \"Weltstadt mit Herz\" (Cosmopolitan city with a heart). Its native name,\n{{lang|de|München}}, is derived from the Old High German Munichen, meaning \"by\nthe monks' place\". The city's name derives from the monks of the Benedictine\norder who founded the city; hence the monk depicted on the city's coat of arms.\nBlack and gold—the colours of the Holy Roman Empire—have been the city's\nofficial colours since the time of Ludwig the Bavarian.\n\nModern Munich is a financial and publishing hub, and a frequently top-ranked\ndestination for migration and expatriate location in livability rankings. Munich\nachieved 4th place in frequently quoted Mercer livability rankings in\n2011<ref></ref> and 2012.<ref></ref> For economic and social innovation, the\ncity was ranked 15th globally out of 289 cities in 2010, and 5th in Germany by\nthe 2thinknow Innovation Cities Index based on analysis of 162\nindicators.<ref></ref> In 2010, [[Monocle (2007 magazine)|Monocle]] ranked\nMunich as the world's most livable city (in 2012, Munich was ranked fifth in\nMonocle's ranking, yet remained the highest ranked city in Germany).<ref></ref>\n","title":"munich","headings":["History","Geography","Demographics","Politics","Subdivisions","Architecture","Sports","Culture","Colleges and universities","Scientific research
