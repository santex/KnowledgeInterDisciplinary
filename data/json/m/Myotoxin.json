This involves a non-enzymatic mechanism that leads to\nsevere muscle necrosis. These peptides act very quickly, causing instantaneous\nparalysis to prevent prey from escaping and eventually death due to\ndiaphragmactic paralysis.\n\nThe first myotoxin to be identified and isolated was crotamine, from the venom\nof Crotalus durissus terrificus, a tropical South American rattlesnake, by\nBrazilian scientist JosÃ© Moura GonÃ§alves, in the 1950s. Its biological actions,\nmolecular structure and gene responsible for its synthesis were all elucidated\nin the last two decades.\n","linknr":124,"url":"Myotoxin","recorded":1362484533,"links":14,"instances":["poison","anatomy"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Vertebrate toxins","Muscular system"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/87/Crotamin_1H5O.png/220px-Crotamin_1H5O.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["venom","poison"],["diaphragm","anatomy"]],"members":["venom","diaphragm"],"related":["Peptide","Snake","Venom_(poison)","Rattlesnake","Muscle","Necrosis","Paralysis","Prey","Diaphragm_(anatomy)","Crotamine","Brazil","Scientist","José_Moura_Gonçalves","Molecular_structure","Gene"]}
