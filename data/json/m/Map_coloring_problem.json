Two\nregions are called adjacent if they share a common boundary that is not a\ncorner, where corners are the points shared by three or more regions. From\nthis paper: Definitions: A planar map is a set of pairwise disjoint subsets of\nthe plane, called regions. A simple map is one whose regions are connected open\nsets. Two regions of a map are adjacent if their respective closures have a\ncommon point that is not a corner of the map. A point is a corner of a map if\nand only if it belongs to the closures of at least three regions. Theorem: The\nregions of any simple planar map can be colored with only four colors, in such\na way that any two adjacent regions have different colors. For example,\nin the map of the United States of America, Utah and Arizona are adjacent, but\nUtah and New Mexico, which only share a point that also belongs to Arizona and\nColorado, are not.\n\nDespite the motivation from coloring political maps of countries, the theorem is\nnot of particular interest to mapmakers. According to an article by the math\nhistorian Kenneth May , âMaps utilizing only four colours are rare, and those\nthat do usually require only three. Books on cartography and the history of\nmapmaking do not mention the four-color property.â\n\nThree colors are adequate for simpler maps, but an additional fourth color is\nrequired for some maps, such as a map in which one region is surrounded by an\nodd number of other regions that touch each other in a cycle. The five color\ntheorem, which has a short elementary proof, states that five colors suffice to\ncolor a map and was proven in the late 19th century ; however, proving that four\ncolors suffice turned out to be significantly harder. A number of false proofs\nand false counterexamples have appeared since the first statement of the four\ncolor theorem in 1852.\n\nThe four color theorem was proven in 1976 by Kenneth Appel and Wolfgang Haken.\nIt was the first major theorem to be proved using a computer. Appel and Haken's\napproach started by showing that there is a particular set of 1,936 maps, each\nof which cannot be part of a smallest-sized counterexample to the four color\ntheorem. Appel and Haken used a special-purpose computer program to confirm that\neach of these maps had this property. Additionally, any map (regardless of\nwhether it is a counterexample or not) must have a portion that looks like one\nof these 1,936 maps. Showing this required hundreds of pages of hand analysis.\nAppel and Haken concluded that no smallest counterexamples existed because any\nmust contain, yet not contain, one of these 1,936 maps. This contradiction means\nthere are no counterexamples at all and that the theorem is therefore true.\nInitially, their proof was not accepted by all mathematicians because the computer-\nassisted proof was infeasible for a human to check by hand . Since then the\nproof has gained wider acceptance, although doubts remain .\n\nTo dispel remaining doubt about the AppelâHaken proof, a simpler proof using the\nsame ideas and still relying on computers was published in 1997 by Robertson,\nSanders, Seymour, and Thomas. Additionally in 2005, the theorem was proven by\nGeorges Gonthier with general purpose theorem proving
