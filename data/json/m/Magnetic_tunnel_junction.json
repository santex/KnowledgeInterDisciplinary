If the insulating layer is thin\nenough (typically a few nanometers), electrons can tunnel from one ferromagnet\ninto the other. Since this process is forbidden in classical physics, the tunnel\nmagnetoresistance is a strictly quantum mechanical phenomenon.\n\nMagnetic tunnel junctions are manufactured in thin film technology. On an\nindustrial scale the film deposition is done by magnetron sputter deposition; on\na laboratory scale molecular beam epitaxy, pulsed laser deposition and electron\nbeam physical vapor deposition are also utilized. The junctions are prepared by\nphotolithography.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Magnetic_tunnel_junction","recorded":1363137188,"links":[],"instances":["electrical","physics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Electric and magnetic fields in matter","Spintronics"],"headings":["Phenomenological description","History","Applications","Physical explanation","Spin-transfer torque in Magnetic Tunnel Junctions (MTJs)","References","See also"],"image":[],"tags":[["insulator","electrical"],["spin","physics"],["green's_function","many-body_theory"]],"members":["insulator","spin"],"related":["Magnetoresistance","Ferromagnet","Insulator_(electrical)","Nanometer","Electron","Quantum_tunneling","Quantum_mechanics","Thin_film","Sputter_deposition","Molecular_beam_epitaxy","Pulsed_laser_deposition","Electron_beam_physical_vapor_deposition","Photolithography","Magnetization","Magnetic_field","Electron","Electrical_resistance","Iron","Germanium","Oxygen","Cobalt","Amorphous","Aluminum_oxide","Crystalline","Magnesium_oxide","Iron","MgO","Disk_read-and-write_head","Hard_disk_drive","MRAM","Non-volatile_memory","Thermal_Assisted_Switching","Spin_Torque_Transfer","Spin_polarization","Spin_(physics)","Density_of_states","Fermi_energy","Voltage","Conservation_law","Coercivity","Antiferromagnet","Exchange_bias","Magnon","Heusler_alloy","Spin-transfer_torque","Gauge_theory","Density_matrix","Green's_function_(many-body_theory)","Zeeman_effect","Quantum_tunnelling","Magnetoresistance","Giant_Magnetoresistance","Spin-transfer_torque"]}
