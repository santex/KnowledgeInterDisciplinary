The term is Greek and means the \"mother city\" of a colony (in\nthe ancient sense), that is, the city which sent out settlers. This was later\ngeneralized to a city regarded as a center of a specified activity, or any\nlarge, important city in a nation.\n\nUrban areas of fewer than one million people are rarely considered metropolises\nin contemporary contexts. Big cities belonging to a larger urban agglomeration,\nbut which are not the core of that agglomeration, are not generally considered a\nmetropolis but a part of it. The plural of the word is most commonly\nmetropolises.<ref></ref>\n\nFor urban centers outside metropolitan areas that generate a similar attraction\nat smaller scale for their region, the term Regiopolis was introduced by German\nprofessors in 2006.<ref>Prof. Dr. Iris Reuther (FG Stadt- und Regionalplanung,\nUniversität Kassel): Presentation \"Regiopole Rostock\". 11 December 2008,\nretrieved 13 June 2009 (pdf).</ref>\n",
