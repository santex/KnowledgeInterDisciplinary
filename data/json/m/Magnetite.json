Naturally magnetized pieces of magnetite, called lodestone,\nwill attract small pieces of iron, and this was how ancient people first noticed\nthe property of magnetism.\n\nSmall grains of magnetite occur in almost all igneous and metamorphic rocks. It\nis black or brownish-black with a metallic luster, has a Mohs hardness of 5â6\nand a black streak.\n\nThe chemical IUPAC name is iron(II,III) oxide and the common chemical name is\n'ferrous-ferric oxide'.\n","linknr":462,"url":"Magnetite","recorded":1362485547,"links":69,"instances":["environmental","mineralogy","geology","literary_theory","steel","magnet","physics","mineral","crystal_system","mri"],"pdf":["http://www.handbookofmineralogy.com/pdfs/magnetite.pdf","http://www.pnas.org/content/99/26/16556.full.pdf","http://www.pnas.org/content/99/26/16556.full.pdf","http://www.gps.caltech.edu/~jkirschvink/pdfs/AnnualReviews89.pdf","http://www.gps.caltech.edu/~jkirschvink/pdfs/AnnualReviews89.pdf"],"categories":["Iron
