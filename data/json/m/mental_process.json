Sometimes the term cognitive process is used instead of\nmental process; however, the term cognitive tends to have specific implications.\n\nA specific instance of engaging in a cognitive process is a mental event. The\nevent of perceiving something is, of course, different from the entire\nprocess, or capacity of perception—one's ability to perceive things. In other\nwords, an instance of perceiving is different from the ability that makes\nthose instances possible.\n",
