It is a very important component of business strategy. The term is commonly interchanged with '[[marketing\nresearch]]'; however, expert practitioners may wish to draw a distinction, in\nthat marketing research is concerned specifically about marketing processes,\nwhile market research is concerned specifically with markets.\n\nMarket research is a key factor to get advantage over competitors.
