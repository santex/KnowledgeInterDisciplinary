Unlike a true cooperative, members usually do not contribute to the\ncapital of the company by direct investment, but derive their right to profits\nand votes through their customer relationship. A mutual organization or society\nis often simply referred to as a mutual.\n\nA mutual exists with the purpose of raising funds from its membership or\ncustomers (collectively called its members), which can then be used to provide\ncommon services to all members of the organization or society. A mutual is\ntherefore owned by, and run for the benefit of, its members - it has no external\nshareholders to pay in the form of dividends, and as such does not usually seek\nto maximize and make large profits or capital gains. Mutuals exist for the\nmembers to benefit from the services they provide and often do not pay income\ntax.<ref>Simpson, Steven D. Multistate Guide to Regulation and Taxation of\nNonprofits.
