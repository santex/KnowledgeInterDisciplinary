Edwards, the method of support aims to make inferences\nabout unknown parameters in terms of the relative support, or log likelihood,\ninduced by a set of data for a particular parameter value. The technique may be\nused whether or not prior information is available.\n\nThe method of maximum likelihood is part of the method of support, but note that\nthe method of support also provides confidence regions that are defined in terms\nof their support.\n\nNotable proponents of the method of support include A. W. F. Edwards.\n","linknr":82,"url":"Method_of_support","recorded":1362535171,"links":13,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Statistical inference"],"headings":["Bibliography"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Bellcurve.svg/30px-Bellcurve.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Statistics","A._W._F._Edwards","Likelihood","Method_of_maximum_likelihood","A._W._F._Edwards"]}
