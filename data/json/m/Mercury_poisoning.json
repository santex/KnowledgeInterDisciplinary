Mercury (chemical symbol Hg) is\na heavy metal occurring in several forms, all of which can produce toxic effects\nin high enough doses. Its zero oxidation state Hg 0 exists as vapor or\nas liquid metal, its mercurous state Hg 22+ exists as\ninorganic salts, and its mercuric state Hg 2+ may form either\ninorganic salts or organomercury compounds; the three groups vary in effects.\nToxic effects include damage to the brain, kidney, and lungs.\nMercury poisoning can result in several diseases, including acrodynia (pink\ndisease), Hunter-Russell syndrome, and Minamata disease.\n\nSymptoms typically include sensory impairment (vision, hearing, speech),\ndisturbed sensation and a lack of coordination. The type and degree of symptoms\nexhibited depend upon the individual toxin, the dose, and the method and\nduration of exposure.\n","linknr":997,"url":"Mercury_poisoning","recorded":1362511185,"links":45,"instances":["dentistry","chemistry","anatomy","symptom","element","1764","architecture","united_states","chemistry","anatomy"],"pdf":["http://www.orthomolecular.org/library/jom/1995/pdf/1995-v10n0304-p145.pdf","http://www.orthomolecular.org/library/jom/1995/pdf/1995-v10n0304-p145.pdf","http://www.epa.gov/ttn/oarpg/t3/reports/volume3.pdf","http://www.epa.gov/ttn/oarpg/t3/reports/volume3.pdf","http://www.epa.gov/ttn/oarpg/t3/reports/volume4.pdf","http://www.epa.gov/ttn/oarpg/t3/reports/volume4.pdf","http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxprofiles/tp46.pdf","http://www.nature.com/jhh/journal/v13/n10/pdf/1000896a.pdf","http://www.nature.com/jhh/journal/v13/n10/pdf/1000896a.pdf","http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxprofiles/tp46-c7.pdf","http://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/tjem/196/2/71/_pdf","http://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/tjem/196/2/71/_pdf","http://www.neonatology.org/pdf/pinkdisease.pdf","http://www.state.nj.us/health/eoh/cehsweb/kiddiekollege/documents/counter04_mercuryexpochildren.pdf","http://www.state.nj.us/health/eoh/cehsweb/kiddiekollege/documents/counter04_mercuryexpochildren.pdf"],"categories":["Mercury
