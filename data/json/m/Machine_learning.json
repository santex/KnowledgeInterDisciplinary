{"cursor":"23608","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n'Machine learning', a branch of artificial intelligence, is about the\nconstruction and study of systems that can learn from data. For example, a\nmachine learning system could be trained on email messages to learn to\ndistinguish between spam and non-spam messages. After learning, it can then be\nused to classify new email messages into spam and non-spam folders.\n\nThe core of machine learning deals with representation and generalization.\nRepresentation of data instances and functions evaluated on these instances are\npart of all machine learning systems. Generalization is the property that the\nsystem will perform well on unseen data instances; the conditions under which\nthis can be guaranteed are a key object of study in the subfield of\ncomputational learning theory.\n\nThere is a wide variety of machine learning tasks and successful applications.\nOptical character recognition, in which characters are recognized automatically\nbased on previous examples, is a classic engineering example of machine\nlearning.
