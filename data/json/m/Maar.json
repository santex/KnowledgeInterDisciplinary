A maar characteristically fills with water\nto form a relatively shallow crater lake. The name comes from the local Moselle\nFranconian dialect of Daun, where it is in turn derived from Latin mare (sea).\nMaars are shallow, flat-floored craters that scientists interpret as having\nformed above diatremes as a result of a violent expansion of magmatic gas or\nsteam; deep erosion of a maar presumably would expose a diatreme. Maars range in\nsize from across and from deep, and most are commonly filled with water to form\nnatural lakes. Most maars have low rims composed of a mixture of loose fragments\nof volcanic rocks and rocks torn from the walls of the diatreme.\n","linknr":253,"url":"Maar","recorded":1362900474,"links":52,"instances":["philippines","germany"],"pdf":["http://pubs.aina.ucalgary.ca/arctic/Arctic49-1-62.pdf","http://pubs.aina.ucalgary.ca/arctic/Arctic49-1-62.pdf"],"categories":["Depressions (geology)","Maars|","Volcanic landforms"],"headings":["Examples","Gallery","Notes","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/Maar_USGS.jpg/220px-Maar_USGS.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/87/Maare.jpg/225px-Maare.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d9/Ukinrek_Maars%2C_Alaska.jpg/120px-Ukinrek_Maars%2C_Alaska.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/33/Totenmaar_weinfelder_maar_eifel.jpg/120px-Totenmaar_weinfelder_maar_eifel.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Maar_Israel.JPG/120px-Maar_Israel.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f2/Rinjani_1994.jpg/100px-Rinjani_1994.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["daun","germany"],["crocodile_lake","philippines"]],"members":["crocodile_lake","daun"],"related":["Relief","Volcanic_crater","Phreatomagmatic_eruption","Explosion","Groundwater","Lava","Magma","Water","Crater_lake","Moselle_Franconian","Dialect","Daun_(Germany)","Latin","Sea","Scientist","Diatreme","Gas","Steam","Erosion","Lake","Volcanic_rock","Rocks","Seward_Peninsula","Magma","Permafrost","North_America","Patagonia","South_America","Eifel","Germany","Geological","Earth","La_Vestide_du_Pal","Kilbourne_Hole","Hunt's_Hole","El_Paso,_Texas","Crocodile_Lake_(Philippines)","Los_Ba√±os,_Laguna","Carbon_dioxide","Lake_Nyos","Africa","Zuni_Salt_Lake","New_Mexico","Saline_lake","Basalt","Wall_rock","Sandstone","Shale","Limestone","Diatreme","Crystalline","Canada","Wells_Gray-Clearwater_volcanic_field","British_Columbia","Kimberlite","Pali-Aike_Volcanic_Field","Patagonia","Auckland","Lake_Pupuke","Takapuna","Arizona","Meteor_Crater","Ukinrek_Maars","Alaska","Day","Volcanic_eruption","Diameter","Weinfelder_Maar","Birkat_Ram","Golan_Heights"]}
