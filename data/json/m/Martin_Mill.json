It takes its name from the\nnearby village of Martin. Martin Mill railway station is on the Dover to Deal\nrailway line.\n\nThe windmill which gives Martin Mill its name was operating commercially until\nabout 1923 when Sydney Hogben, the owner and former operator, took it into his\nhead to saw off the sails by his own hand. This caused outrage in the community\nand took the mill out of commission forever. The ruins were finally demolished\nin the 1960s.\n","linknr":214,"url":"Martin_Mill","recorded":1362572256,"links":20,"instances":["uk_parliament_constituency"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Villages in Kent"],"headings":["See also","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/Martin_Mill_railway_station.jpg/200px-Martin_Mill_railway_station.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/Kent_UK_location_map.svg/240px-Kent_UK_location_map.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/0c/Red_pog.svg/6px-Red_pog.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/0c/Red_pog.svg/6px-Red_pog.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/12px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/KentDover.svg/100px-KentDover.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["dover","district"],["dover","uk_parliament_constituency"]],"members":["dover"],"related":["Dover_(district)","Kent","Dover_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","Dover","Kent","England","Martin,_Kent","Martin_Mill_railway_station","Dover","Deal,_Kent","Martin,_Kent"]}
