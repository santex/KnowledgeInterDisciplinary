{"cursor":"8190","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Manufacturing' is the production of goods for use or sale using labor and\nmachines, tools, chemical and biological processing, or formulation. The term\nmay refer to a range of human activity, from handicraft to high tech, but is\nmost commonly applied to industrial production, in which raw materials are\ntransformed into finished goods on a large scale. Such finished goods may be\nused for manufacturing other, more complex products, such as aircraft, household\nappliances or automobiles, or sold to wholesalers, who in turn sell them to\nretailers, who then sell them to end users â the \"consumers\".\n\nManufacturing takes turns under all types of economic systems. In a free market\neconomy, manufacturing is usually directed toward the mass production of\nproducts for sale to consumers at a profit. In a collectivist economy,\nmanufacturing is more frequently directed by the state to supply a centrally\nplanned economy. In mixed market economies, manufacturing occurs under some\ndegree of government regulation.\n\nModern manufacturing includes all intermediate processes required for the\nproduction and integration of a product's components. Some industries, such as\nsemiconductor and steel manufacturers use the term fabrication instead.\n\nThe manufacturing sector is closely connected with engineering and industrial\ndesign. Examples of major manufacturers in North America include General Motors\nCorporation, General Electric, and Pfizer. Examples in Europe include Volkswagen\nGroup, Siemens, and Michelin. Examples in Asia include Toyota, Samsung, and\nBridgestone.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Manufacturers","recorded":1372154435,"links":[],"instances":["business","metal","military","business"],"pdf":[],"categories":[],"headings":["History and development","Industrial policy"],"image":[],"tags":[["product","business"],["fabrication","semiconductor"],["fabrication","metal"],["fabrication","metal"],["just_in_time","business"],["defense","military"]],"members":["just_in_time","fabrication","defense","product"],"related":["Machine","Tool","Handicraft","High_tech_manufacturing","Industry","Raw_material","Finished_good","Aircraft","Major_appliance","Automobile","Wholesale","Retailer","Consumer","Economic_system","Mass_production","Product_(business)","Consumer","Planned_economy","Regulation","Fabrication_(semiconductor)","Fabrication_(metal)","Engineering","Industrial_design","North_America","General_Motors_Corporation","General_Electric","Pfizer","Volkswagen_Group","Siemens","Michelin","Toyota","Samsung","Bridgestone","Artisan","Apprenticeship","Guild","Industrial_Revolution","Agriculture","Putting-out_system","Guild","Agile_manufacturing","American_system_of_manufacturing","English_system_of_manufacturing","Fabrication_(metal)","Flexible_manufacturing","Just_In_Time_(business)","Lean_manufacturing","Mass_customization","Mass_production","Ownership","Packaging_and_labeling","Prefabrication","Putting-out_system","Rapid_manufacturing","Reconfigurable_manufacturing_system","Soviet_collectivism","Service_Sector","Emerging_technologies","Manufacturing_Belt","United_States","Infrastructure","Defense_(military)","Hazardous_waste","Workers","Labor_laws","Environmental_policy","Labor_Unions","Craft_guilds","Third_world","Tort_law","Product_liability","Fossil_fuel","Jeff_Immelt","United_States"]}
