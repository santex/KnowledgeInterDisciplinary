Since many of the foods are abrasive enough to cause attrition,\nrabbit teeth grow continuously throughout life. Brown, Susan.

Three to four millimeters of tooth is worn away by incisors every\nweek, whereas the posterior teeth require a month to wear away the same\namount. RyÅ¡avy, Robin.

Page accessed April 9, 2007.\n\n'Anatomy of rabbit teeth'\n\nThe incisors and cheek teeth of rabbits are called aradicular hypsodont teeth.\nThis is sometimes referred to as an elodent dentition. These teeth grow or erupt\ncontinuously. The growth or eruption is held in balance by dental abrasion from\nchewing a diet high in fiber.\n\nRodent Rodents' incisors grow continuously throughout their lives, a process\nknown as aradicular. Unlike humans whose ameloblasts die after tooth\ndevelopment, rodents continually produce enamel and must wear down their teeth\nby gnawing on various materials. Caceci, Thomas. Veterinary Histology with\nsubtitle \"Digestive System: Oral Cavity\" found\n[http://education.vetmed.vt.edu/Curriculum/VM8054/Labs/Lab17/Lab17.htm\nhere]. These teeth are used for cutting wood, biting through the skin of\nfruit, or for defense. The teeth have enamel on the outside and exposed dentin\non the inside, so they self-sharpen during gnawing. On the other hand,\ncontinually growing molars are found in some rodent species, such as the sibling\nvole and the guinea pig. Tummers M and Thesleff I. Root or crown: a\ndevelopmental choice orchestrated by the differential regulation of the\nepithelial stem cell niche in the tooth of two rodent species. Development\n(2003). 130(6):1049-57. AM Hunt. A description of the molar teeth and\ninvesting tissues of normal guinea pigs. J Dent Res. (1959) 38(2):216-31.\nThere is variation in the dentition of the rodents, but generally, rodents lack\ncanines and premolars, and have a space between their incisors and molars,\ncalled the diastema region.\n\nHorse\n\nAn adult horse has between 36 and 44 teeth. All horses have twelve premolars,\ntwelve molars, and twelve incisors. Generally, all\nmale equines also have four canine teeth (called tushes) between the molars and\nincisors. However, few female horses (less than 28%) have canines, and those\nthat do usually have only one or two, which many times are only partially\nerupted. A few horses have one to four wolf teeth, which\nare vestigial premolars, with most of those having only one or two. They are\nequally common in male and female horses and much more likely to be on the upper\njaw. If present these can cause problems as they can interfere with the horse's\n[bit contact. Therefore, wolf teeth are commonly removed.\n\nHorse teeth can be used to estimate the animal's age. Between birth and five\nyears, age can be closely estimated by observing the eruption pattern on milk\nteeth and then permanent teeth. By age five, all permanent teeth have usually\nerupted. The horse is then said to have a \"full\" mouth. After the age of five,\nage can only be conjectured by study of the wear patterns on the incisors,\nshape, the angle at which the incisors meet, and other factors. The wear of\nteeth may also be affected by diet, natural abnormalities, and cribbing. Two\nhorses of the same age may have different wear patterns.\n\nA horse's incisors, premolars, and molars, once fully developed, continue to\nerupt as the grinding surface is worn down through chewing. A young adult horse\nwill have teeth which are 4.5-5 inches long, with the majority of the crown\nremaining below the gumline in the dental socket. The rest of the tooth will\nslowly emerge from the jaw, erupting about 1/8\" each year, as the horse ages.\nWhen the animal reaches old age, the crowns of the teeth are very short and the\nteeth are often lost altogether. Very old horses, if lacking molars, may need to\nhave their fodder ground up and soaked in water to create a soft mush for them\nto eat in order to obtain adequate nutrition.\n\nHumans\n\n\nElephants\n\nElephants' tusks are specialized incisors for digging food up and fighting. Some\nof elephant teeth are similar to those in manatees, and it is notable that\nelephants are believed to have undergone an aquatic phase in their evolution.\n\nElephants have four molars, one on each side of the upper and lower jaw. Until\nage 40, these are replaced by larger molars. The new molars shift forward from\nthe back of the jaw as the old wear down. The final set of molars last for about\ntwenty years. Bram, L. et al. MCMLXXXIII. Elephants. Funk & Wagnalls New\nEncyclopedia, Volume 9, p. 183. ISBN 0-8343-0051-6\n\nManatees Mandibular molars of manatees develop separately from the jaw and are\nencased in a bony shell separated by soft tissue.\n\nWalrus Walrus tusks are canine teeth that grow continuously throughout\nlife. [http://www.uic.edu/classes/orla/orla312/CANINES.htm The Permanent\nCanine Teeth], hosted on the University of Illinois at Chicago website. Page\naccessed February 5, 2007.\n\nDogs In dogs, the teeth are less likely than humans to form dental cavities\nbecause of the very high pH of dog saliva, which prevents enamel from\ndemineralizing. Chris C. Pinney, The Illustrated Veterinary Guide for Dogs,\nCats, Birds, and Exotic Pets (Blue Ridge Summit, PA: TAB Books, 1992), p.\n187.\n\nAardvark In Aardvarks, teeth lack enamel and have many pulp tubules, hence the\nname of the order Tubulidentata.\n\nCetaceans Toothed whales is a suborder of the cetaceans characterized by having\nteeth. The teeth differ considerably between the species. They may be numerous,\nwith some dolphins bearing over 100 teeth in their jaws. On the other hand, the\nnarwhals have a giant unicorn-like tusk, which is a tooth containing millions of\nsensory pathways and used for sensing during feeding, navigation and mating. It\nis the most neurologically complex tooth known. Beaked whales are almost\ntoothless, with only bizarre teeth found in males. These teeth may be used for\nfeeding but also for demonstrating aggression and showmanship.\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal
