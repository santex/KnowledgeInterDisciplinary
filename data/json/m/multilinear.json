If the codomain of a\nmultilinear map is the field of scalars, it is called a multilinear form.\nMultilinear maps and multilinear forms are fundamental objects of study in\nmultilinear algebra.\n\nIf all variables belong to the same space, one can consider symmetric,\nantisymmetric and alternating k-linear maps. The latter coincide if the\nunderlying ring (or field) has a characteristic different from two, else the\nformer two coincide.\n","title":"Multilinear map","headings":["Examples","Coordinate representation","Relation to tensor products","Multilinear functions on ''n''&times;''n'' matrices","Example","Properties","See also","References"]},"micro-relation":["2: Bilinear_map","2: Multilinear_form","2: Symmetric_function","2: Antisymmetric","2: Multilinear_subspace_learning","1: Linear_algebra","1: Vector_space","1: Linear_map","1: Multilinear_algebra","1: Alternating_map","1: Inner_product","1: Cross_product","1: Determinant","1: Square_matrix","1: Smooth_function","1: Multilinear_subspace_learning#Tensor-to-vector_projection_.28TVP.29","1: Tensor_product","1: Commutative_ring","1: Zero_function","1: Bilinear_map#Examples","1: Algebraic_form","1: Homogeneous_polynomial","1: Homogeneous_function","1: Tensor","1: Multilinear_subspace_learning#Multilinear_projection"]}
