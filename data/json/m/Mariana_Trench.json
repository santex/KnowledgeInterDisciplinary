It is located in the western Pacific Ocean, to the east of the Mariana\nIslands. The trench is about long but has an average width of only . It reaches\na maximum-known depth of 10.911 km (10,911 Â± 40 m) or 6.831 mi (36,069 Â± 131 ft)\nat the Challenger Deep, a small slot-shaped valley in its floor, at its southern\nend, although some unrepeated measurements place the deepest\nportion at .\n\nAt the bottom of the trench the water column above exerts a pressure of ,\nover one thousand times the standard atmospheric pressure at sea level. At\nthis pressure the density of water is increased by 4.96%, making ninety-five\nlitres of water under the pressure of the Challenger Deep contain the same\nmass as a hundred litres at the surface. The temperature at the bottom is 1\nto 4 â°C.
