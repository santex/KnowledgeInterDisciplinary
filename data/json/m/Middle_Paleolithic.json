The Middle\nPaleolithic and the Middle Stone Age broadly spanned from 300,000 to 30,000\nyears ago. There are considerable dating differences between regions. The Middle\nPaleolithic/Middle Stone Age was succeeded by the Upper Paleolithic subdivision\nwhich first began between 50,000 and 40,000 years ago.\n\nDuring this time period [[Homo neanderthalensis]] thrived in Europe between\n300,000 and 30,000 years ago, and the earliest anatomically modern humans\nappeared around 195,000 years ago. Phylogenetic separation of modern humans\ndates to this period, mitochondrial Eve to roughly 150,000 years ago, Y-\nchromosomal Adam to roughly 350,000 years ago\n[http://www.cell.com/AJHG/retrieve/pii/S0002929713000736 An African\nAmerican Paternal Lineage Adds an Extremely Ancient Root to the Human Y\nChromosome Phylogenetic Tree], by F.

Additionally, according to the Out of Africa\nHypothesis, modern humans began migrating out of Africa during the Middle Stone\nAge/Middle Paleolithic around 100,000 or 70,000 years ago and began to replace\nearlier pre-existent Homo species such as the Neanderthals and [[Homo\nerectus]] [http://www.actionbioscience.org/evolution/johanson.html Origins\nof Modern Humans: Multiregional or Out of Africa?] By Donald Johanson , a\ntheory that has been disproved by population genetics.\n","linknr":394,"url":"Middle_Paleolithic","recorded":1362373286,"links":44,"instances":["paleolithic_site"],"pdf":["http://www.ablongman.com/html/productinfo/millerwood/MillerWood_c08.pdf","http://www.ablongman.com/html/productinfo/millerwood/MillerWood_c08.pdf","http://anthropology.tamu.edu/faculty/alvard/anth630/reading/Week%208%20Diet%20tubers/Wrangham%20and%20Conklin-Brittain%202003.pdf","http://anthropology.tamu.edu/faculty/alvard/anth630/reading/Week%208%20Diet%20tubers/Wrangham%20and%20Conklin-Brittain%202003.pdf","http://www.sciencenews.org/pages/pdfs/data/1997/151-26/15126-11.pdf","http://www.sciencenews.org/pages/pdfs/data/1997/151-26/15126-11.pdf"],"categories":["Pleistocene","Paleolithic","Middle Stone Age|"],"headings":["Origin of behavorial modernity","Social stratification","Nutrition","Technology","Sites","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/BBC-artefacts.jpg/225px-BBC-artefacts.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e9/Kermanshah_Pal_Museum-Neanderthal.jpg/220px-Kermanshah_Pal_Museum-Neanderthal.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["bilzingsleben","paleolithic_site"]],"members":["bilzingsleben"],"related":["Paleolithic","Stone_Age","Europe","Africa","Asia","Middle_Stone_Age","Upper_Paleolithic","Modern_humans","Mitochondrial_Eve","Y-chromosomal_Adam","Multiregional_hypothesis","Out_of_Africa_Hypothesis","Homo_sapiens","Population_genetics","Behavioral_modernity","Krapina","Qafzeh","Philip_Lieberman","Archaeological_Site_of_Atapuerca","Lower_Paleolithic","Combe-Grenal","Abri_Moula","France","Excarnation","Ritual_defleshing","Middle_Stone_Age","Blombos_Cave","Venus_of_Tan-Tan","Bilzingsleben_(Paleolithic_site)","Thuringia","Acheulean","Band_society","Ochre","Band_societies","!Kung_San","Mbuti","Christopher_Boehm","Steven_Kuhn","Upper_Paleolithic","Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo","Pinnacle_Point","Tim_D._White","Cannibalism","Ritual_defleshing","Saber_tooth_cat","Lions","Hyenas","Stone_tool","Prepared-core_technique","Acheulean","Neanderthals","Homo_sapiens","Ambush","Harold_Dibble","Robert_K._Wayne","Axlor","Petralona","Le_Moustier","Mousterian","La_Quina","Neanderthal","Goyet","Grotte_de_Spy","Spy,_Belgium","Biache-Saint-Vaast","Rheindahlen","Maastricht","Belvédère","Veldwezelt-Hezerwater","Early_human_migrations","Recent_African_origin_of_modern_humans","Timeline_of_human_prehistory"]}
