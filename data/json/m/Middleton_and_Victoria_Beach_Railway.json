It ran west from Middleton, where it joined both the Dominion\nAtlantic Railway, which ran from Halifax westerly to Yarmouth through the\nAnnapolis Valley, and the Nova Scotia Central Railway, which ran from Middleton\nsouth to Bridgewater and Lunenburg. It never went as far as Victoria Beach, but\nstopped a few miles short in Port Wade where a quarter mile wharf was built\nwhich was used even after the railway stopped running.\n\nThe line of the railway tended to be closer to the North Mountain and the farms\nthere than was the Dominion Atlantic where the two railways more or less\nparallelled each other between Middleton and Bridgetown. West of Bridgetown the\nDominion Atlantic crossed to the south side of the Annapolis River and the\nMiddleton and Victoria Beach tended to run fairly close to the river from\nBridgetown west to Port Wade.\n\nThe earliest variant of the company was the Granville and Victoria Beach Railway\nCompany. Statutes of Nova Scotia 1891, chapter 126. The incorporators\n(those listed as the first members of the company) included forestry operators,\nmerchants and lawyers from along the proposed route. This was a common way to\nget political support for the necessary legislative charter each railway had to\nhave in order to qualify for the provincial construction grant, to allow it to\nexpropriate its right of way (which it actually owned) Statutes of Nova\nScotia, Railways Act and to permit it to cross highways. This railway was\nintended to run west from Bridgetown rather than from Middleton.\n\nA second attempt to get the railway started was the Granville and Victoria Beach\nRailway and Development Company. Statutes of Nova Scotia 1897, chapter\n82 The incorporation was extended in 1899. The 1897 Act had provided that\nthe Act would cease if work had not been completed within two years. Then there\nwas another extension in 1901, when the name of the company was changed to the\nMiddleton and Victoria Beach Railway Company. Statutes of Nova Scotia 1901,\nchapter 160 At this time the eastern end of the railway was shifted east\nfrom Bridgetown to Middleton, possibly because the promoters were afraid to\ntrust their only rail connection to the outside world to the Dominion Atlantic,\nbut also because the railway to Bridgewater had been completed. At about this\ntime the railway plans were approved and filed in the registry of deeds, which\nconstituted the expropriation. See plans in the Annapolis County Registry of\nDeeds, Lawrencetown, Annapolis County, Nova Scotia The municipalities\nalong the way, the Municipality of the County of Annapolis and the Town of\nBridgetown, obtained legislative sanction to pay for the railway right of way,\nwhat was then referred to as railway damages. That was their contribution to\nwhat was generally seen as a valuable economic engine.\n\nThe railway was acquired by the Halifax and South Western Railway in\n1905. The sale was completed July 28, 1903 (see New York Times, July 29,\n1903) but the necessary statutory authority was not confirmed until 1905.\nThe construction had not been completed, and the H&SW had to finish the job.\nMacKenzie and Mann, who were expanding the Canadian Northern in Nova Scotia,\nowned the H&SW, which had acquired the Nova Scotia Central and built a railway\ninto Halifax from Bridgewater. The provincial government fixed the length of the\nline at forty miles (64 kilometers) for purposes of the subsidy.\n\nThe railway eventually became part of Canadian Government Railways, and then\nCanadian National Railways.\n","linknr":127,"url":"Middleton_and_Victoria_Beach_Railway","recorded":1375061488,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Middleton_and_Victoria_Beach_Railway&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Middleton_and_Victoria_Beach_Railway&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e1/Ambox_wikify.svg/40px-Ambox_wikify.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Linking","/wiki/Wikipedia:BUILD","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Middleton_and_Victoria_Beach_Railway&action=edit","/wiki/Wikipedia:Only_make_links_that_are_relevant_to_the_context","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","/wiki/Help:Section","/wiki/MOS:HEAD","/wiki/Annapolis_County","/wiki/Middleton,_Nova_Scotia","/wiki/Dominion_Atlantic_Railway","/wiki/Halifax_Regional_Municipality","/wiki/Yarmouth,_Nova_Scotia","/wiki/Annapolis_Valley","/wiki/Bridgewater,_Nova_Scotia","/wiki/Lunenburg,_Nova_Scotia","/wiki/Victoria_Beach,_Nova_Scotia","/wiki/Port_Wade","/wiki/Bridgetown","#cite_note-1","#cite_note-2","#cite_note-3","#cite_note-4","#cite_note-5","/wiki/Halifax_and_South_Western_Railway","#cite_note-6","/wiki/Canadian_Government_Railways","/wiki/Canadian_National_Railways","#Iron","#First_Abandonment","#Final_Abandonment","#References","/w/index.php?title=Middleton_and_Victoria_Beach_Railway&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Torbrook","/w/index.php?title=Middleton_and_Victoria_Beach_Railway&action=edit&section=2","#cite_note-7","/w/index.php?title=Middleton_and_Victoria_Beach_Railway&action=edit&section=3","/w/index.php?title=Middleton_and_Victoria_Beach_Railway&action=edit&section=4","#cite_ref-1","#cite_ref-2","#cite_ref-3","#cite_ref-4","#cite_ref-5","#cite_ref-6","#cite_ref-7","/wiki/File:CN_8880_rolls_past_Wood_Street_Crossing_in_Harvey.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/CN_8880_rolls_past_Wood_Street_Crossing_in_Harvey.jpg/50px-CN_8880_rolls_past_Wood_Street_Crossing_in_Harvey.jpg","/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Middleton_and_Victoria_Beach_Railway&action=edit","/wiki/Template:Canada-rail-transport-stub","/wiki/Template_talk:Canada-rail-transport-stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Canada-rail-transport-stub&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Middleton_and_Victoria_Beach_Railway&oldid=545460440","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Defunct_Nova_Scotia_railways","/wiki/Category:Canada_rail_transport_stubs","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_too_few_wikilinks_from_October_2012","/wiki/Category:All_articles_with_too_few_wikilinks","/wiki/Category:Articles_covered_by_WikiProject_Wikify_from_October_2012","/wiki/Category:All_articles_covered_by_WikiProject_Wikify","/wiki/Category:Articles_needing_sections_from_October_2012","/wiki/Category:All_articles_needing_sections","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Middleton+and+Victoria+Beach+Railway&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Middleton+and+Victoria+Beach+Railway","/wiki/Middleton_and_Victoria_Beach_Railway","/wiki/Talk:Middleton_and_Victoria_Beach_Railway","#","/wiki/Middleton_and_Victoria_Beach_Railway","/w/index.php?title=Middleton_and_Victoria_Beach_Railway&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Middleton_and_Victoria_Beach_Railway&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Middleton_and_Victoria_Beach_Railway","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Middleton_and_Victoria_Beach_Railway","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Middleton_and_Victoria_Beach_Railway&oldi
