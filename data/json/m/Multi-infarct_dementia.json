This type of dementia was previously referred to as \"multi-infarct\ndementia\", and also hardening of the arteries. Vascular dementia is the second\nmost common form of dementia after Alzheimer's disease (AD) in older\nadults. Multi-\ninfarct dementia (MID) is thought to be an irreversible form of dementia, and\nits onset is caused by a number of small strokes or sometimes, one large stroke\npreceded or followed by other smaller strokes. Antai-Otong, D. 2008.\nPsychiatric Nursing: Biological and Behavioral Concepts. 2nd ed. Canada:\nThompson Delmar Learning. The term refers to a group of syndromes caused\nby different mechanisms all resulting in vascular lesions in the brain. Early\ndetection and accurate diagnosis are important, as vascular dementia is at least\npartially preventable.\n\nThe main subtypes of this disease are: mild cognitive impairment, multi-infarct\ndementia, vascular dementia due to a strategic single infarct (affecting the\nthalamus, the anterior cerebral artery, the parietal lobes or the cingulate\ngyrus), vascular dementia due to hemorrhagic lesions, and mixed Alzheimer's and\nvascular dementia.\n\nVascular lesions can be the result of diffuse cerebrovascular disease, such as\nsmall vessel disease, or focal lesions; usually both. Mixed dementia is\ndiagnosed when patients have evidence of AD and cerebrovascular disease, either\nclinically or based on neuroimaging evidence of ischemic lesions. In fact\nvascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease often coexist, especially in older\npatients with dementia.\n\nMID is sometimes triggered by cerebral amyloid angiopathy, which involves\naccumulation of beta amyloid plaques in the walls of the cerebral arteries,\nleading to breakdown and rupture of the vessels. Since amyloid plaques are a\ncharacteristic feature of AD, vascular dementia may occur as a side effect of\nit. However, cerebral amyloid angiopathy can also appear in people with no prior\ndementia condition and a small amount of beta amyloid plaques are often present\nin cognitively normal older persons.\n","linknr":478,"url":"Multi-infarct_dementia","recorded":1362579525,"links":32,"instances":["epidemiology","human","psychology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Dementia","Cognitive disorders","Organic, including symptomatic, mental disorders","Psychiatric diagnosis","Learning disabilities"],"headings":["Signs and symptoms","Diagnosis","Cause","Treatment","Prognosis","Epidemiology","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["affect","psychology"],["gait","human"],["incidence","epidemiology"]],"members":["incidence","gait","affect"],"related":["Dementia","Alzheimer's_disease","Mild_cognitive_impairment","Infarct","Thalamus","Anterior_cerebral_artery","Parietal_lobe","Cingulate_gyrus","Cerebrovascular_disease","Cerebral_amyloid_angiopathy","Amyloid","Hypertension","Affect_(psychology)","Apathy","Abulia","Syphilis","Diagnostic_and_Statistical_Manual_of_Mental_Disorders","International_Classification_of_Diseases","National_Institute_of_Neurological_Disorders_and_Stroke","Hemiparesis","Bradykinesia","Hyperreflexia","Extensor_plantar_reflexes","Ataxia","Pseudobulbar_palsy","Gait_(human)","Swallowing_difficulties","Free_recall","Dysarthria","Aphasia","ECG","Single_photon_emission_computed_tomography","Positron_emission_tomography","Mental_status_examination","Medical_history","NINCDS-ADRDA_Alzheimer's_Criteria","Full_blood_count","Liver_function_tests","Thyroid_function_tests","Erythrocyte_sedimentation_rate","C_reactive_protein","Syphilis","Urea","Electrolytes","Vitamin_B-12","Folate","White_matter","Hippocampus","Thamalus","Hypertension","Hypercholesterolemia","Diabetes_mellitus","Cardiovascular_disease","Cerebrovascular_disease","Caregiver_syndrome","Cholinesterase_inhibitors","Galantamine","Pneumonia","Prevalence","Incidence_(epidemiology)","Dementia","Relative_risk","Cerebrovascular_accident","Binswanger's_disease"]}
