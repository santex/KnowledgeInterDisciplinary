Meaning a mixture, medley, or assortment, a can include pieces on many\nsubjects and in a variety of different\nforms.<ref>[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/119276?rskey=nK2Wqw&result=1\nMiscellany, n.] OED Online. Oxford University Press. Retrieved April 18,\n2013.</ref> In contrast to anthologies, whose aim is to give a selective and\n[[Western canon|canonical]] view of literature, miscellanies were produced for\nthe entertainment of a contemporary audience and so instead emphasise\ncollectiveness and popularity. Laura Mandell and Rita Raley state:\n\n\nManuscript miscellanies are important in the Middle Ages, and are the sources\nfor most surviving shorter medieval vernacular poetry. Medieval miscellanies\noften include completely different types of text, mixing poetry with legal\ndocuments, recipes, music, medical and devotional literature and other types of\ntext, and in medieval contexts a mixture of types of text is often taken as a\nnecessary condition for describing a manuscript as a miscellany. They may have\nbeen written as a collection, or represent manuscripts of different origins\nthat were later bound together for convenience. In the early modern period\nmiscellanies remained significant in a more restricted literary context, both\nin manuscript and printed forms, mainly as a vehicle for collections of shorter\npieces of poetry, but also other works. Their numbers increased until their\npeak of importance in the 18th century, when over 1000 English poetry\nmiscellanies were published,<ref>[http://digitalmiscellaniesindex.org/about/\n\"About\"], Digital Miscellanies Index</ref> before the rise of anthologies in\nthe early 19th century. The printed miscellany gradually morphed into the\nformat of the regularly published magazine, and many early magazines used the\nword in their titles.\n",
