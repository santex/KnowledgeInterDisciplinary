Mellick]\n\nThe Middle Brook's western and eastern branches drain the Washington Valley\nbetween the first and second Watchung Mountain ridges in Bridgewater Township\nand the western part of Warren Township. The two branches unite in the Bound\nBrook Gap and the Middle Brook runs southward where it enters the Raritan in\nBound Brook. The total drainage area is 17.2 mÂ². \n\nThe Western Branch is followed by the Middle Brook Trail, a public hiking\ntrail.

The smaller Eastern Branch is also dammed\nand then cascades over the Buttermilk Falls in Washington Valley Park.\n\nThe Middle Brook section in Bound Brook is being regulated as part of the\nGreen Brook Flood Control Project in an attempt to spare Bound Brook flooding\nfrom backwater from the Raritan that can enter the terminal section of the\nMiddle Brook.\n","linknr":107,"url":"Middle_Brook_(New_Jersey)","recorded":1362677147,"links":13,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://nj.usgs.gov/adr/adr2006/PDF/01403200.2006.pdf","http://nj.usgs.gov/adr/adr2006/PDF/01403200.2006.pdf"],"categories":["Tributaries of the Raritan River","Rivers of New Jersey","Geography of Somerset County, New Jersey"],"headings":["See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/86/Buttermilkfalls.JPG/220px-Buttermilkfalls.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Tributary","Raritan_River","Somerset,_New_Jersey","New_Jersey","United_States","Watchung_Mountains","Bridgewater_Township,_New_Jersey","Warren_Township,_New_Jersey","Bound_Brook,_New_Jersey","Washington_Valley_Park","Green_Brook_Flood_Control_Project","List_of_rivers_of_New_Jersey","Middlebrook_encampment"]}
