Typical values of membrane potential are in the range â40 mV to â80\nmV. Many ions have a concentration gradient across the membrane, including\npotassium (K +), which is at a high inside and a low concentration\noutside the membrane. Sodium (Na +) and chloride (Cl â ) ions\nare at high concentrations in the extracellular region, and low concentrations\nin the intracellular regions. These concentration gradients provide the\npotential energy to drive the formation of the membrane potential. This voltage\nis established when the membrane has permeability to one or more ions. In the\nsimplest case, illustrated here, if the membrane is selectively permeable to\npotassium, these positively charged ions can diffuse down the concentration\ngradient to the outside of the cell, leaving behind uncompensated negative\ncharges. This separation of charges is what causes the membrane potential. Note\nthat the bulk solutions of either side of the membrane are electro-neutral.\nLikewise, the system as a whole is electro-neutral. The \"uncompensated\" positive\ncharges outside the cell, and the uncompensated negative charges inside the\ncell, physically line up on the membrane surface and attract each other across\nmembrane. Thus, the membrane potential is physically located only in the\nimmediate vicinity of the membrane. It is the separation of these charges across\nthe membrane that is the basis of the membrane voltage. Note also that this\ndiagram is only an approximation of the ionic contributions to the membrane\npotential. Other ions including sodium, chloride, calcium and others play a more\nminor role, even though they have strong concentration gradients, because they\nhave more limited permeability than potassium. Key: Blue pentagons - sodium\nions; Purple squares - potassium ions; Yellow circles - Choloride ions; Orange\nrectangles - Anions (these arise from a variety of sources including proteins).\nThe large purple structure with an arrow represents a transmembrane potassium\nchannel and the direction of net potassium movement. ]]\n\n'Membrane potential' (also 'transmembrane potential' or 'membrane voltage') is\nthe difference in electrical potential between the interior and the exterior\nof a biological cell. Typical values of membrane potential range from â40 mV\nto â80 mV.\n\nAll animal cells are surrounded by a plasma membrane composed of a lipid bilayer\nwith a variety of types of proteins embedded in it. The membrane potential\narises primarily from the interaction between the membrane and the actions of\ntwo types of transmembrane proteins embedded in the plasma membrane. The\nmembrane serves as both an insulator and a diffusion barrier to the movement of\nions. Ion transporter/pump proteins actively push ions across the membrane to\nestablish concentration gradients across the membrane, and ion channels allow\nions to move across the membrane down those concentration gradients, a process\nknown as facilitated diffusion. In the most fundamental example of this, the ion\ntransporter Na +/K +-ATPase pumps sodium cations from the\ninside to the outside, and potassium cations from the outside to the inside of\nthe cell. This establishes two concentration gradients: a gradient for sodium\nwhere its concentration is much higher outside than inside the cell, and a\ngradient for potassium where its concentration is much higher inside the cell\nthan outside. Transmembrane potassium-selective leak channels allow potassium\nions to diffuse across the membrane, down the concentration gradient that was\nestablished by the ATPase, creating a charge separation, and thus a voltage,\nacross the membrane. In almost all cases, the ion that determines the so-called\n\"resting\" membrane potential of a cell is K +, although other ions do\ncontribute in more minor ways. By convention, the sign of the membrane potential\nis the voltage inside relative to ground outside the cell. In the case of\nK +, its diffusion down its concentration gradient (toward the outside\nof the cell, in this case) creates transmembrane voltage that is negative\nrelative to the outside of the cell, and typically â60 to â80 millivolts (mV) in\namplitude.\n\nVirtually all eukaryotic cells (including cells from animals, plants, and fungi)\nmaintain a nonzero transmembrane potential, usually with a negative voltage in\nthe cell interior as compared to the cell exterior. The membrane potential has\ntwo basic functions. First, it allows a cell to function as a battery, providing\npower to operate a variety of \"molecular devices\" embedded in the membrane.\nSecond, in electrically excitable cells such as neurons and muscle cells, it is\nused for transmitting signals between different parts of a cell. Signals are\ngenerated by opening or closing of ion channels at one point in the membrane,\nproducing a local change in the membrane potential. This change in the electric\nfield can quickly be detected by either adjacent or more distant ion channels in\nthe membrane. Those ion channels can then depolarize, reproducing the signal.\n\nIn non-excitable cells, and in excitable cells in their baseline states, the\nmembrane potential is held at a relatively stable value, called the resting\npotential. For neurons, typical values of the resting potential range from â70\nto â80 millivolts; that is, the interior of a cell has a negative baseline\nvoltage of a bit less than one tenth of a volt. The opening and closing of ion\nchannels can induce a departure from the resting potential. This is called a\ndepolarization if the interior voltage becomes more positive (say from â70 mV to\nâ60 mV), or a hyperpolarization if the interior voltage becomes more negative\n(say from â70 mV to â80 mV). In excitable cells, a sufficiently large\ndepolarization can evoke an action potential, in which the membrane potential\nchanges rapidly and significantly for a short time (on the order of 1 to 100\nmilliseconds), often reversing its polarity. Action potentials are generated by\nthe activation of certain voltage-gated ion channels.\n\nIn neurons, the factors that influence the membrane potential are diverse. They\ninclude numerous types of ion channels, some that are chemically gated and some\nthat are voltage-gated. Because voltage-gated ion channels are controlled by the\nmembrane potential, while the membrane potential itself is influenced by these\nsame ion channels, feedback loops that allow for complex temporal dynamics\narise, including oscillations and regenerative events such as action potentials.\n","linknr":472,"url":"Membrane_potential","recorded":1362479230,"links":48,"instances":["electricity","electricity_","biology","unit","biochemistry","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Cell
