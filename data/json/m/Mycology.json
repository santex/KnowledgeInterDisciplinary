{"cursor":"11572","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" are a kind of fungal reproductive structure]] 'Mycology' (from the Greek Î¼ÏÎºÎ·Ï,\n mukÄs, meaning \"fungus\") is the branch of biology concerned with the study of\n fungi, including their genetic and biochemical properties, their taxonomy and\n their use to humans as a source for tinder, medicine (e.g., penicillin), food\n (e.g., beer, wine, cheese, edible mushrooms) and entheogens, as well as their\n dangers, such as poisoning or infection.\n\nFrom mycology arose the field of phytopathology, the study of plant diseases,\nand the two disciplines remain closely related because the vast majority of\n\"plant\" pathogens are fungi. A biologist who studies mycology is called a\n'mycologist'.\n\nHistorically, mycology was a branch of botany because, although fungi are\nevolutionarily more closely related to animals than to plants, this was not\nrecognized until a few decades ago. Pioneer mycologists included Elias Magnus\nFries, Christian Hendrik Persoon, Anton de Bary and Lewis David von Schweinitz.\n\nMany fungi produce toxins, antibiotics and other secondary metabolites. For\nexample the cosmopolitan (worldwide) genus [[Fusarium]] and their toxins\nassociated with fatal outbreaks of alimentary toxic aleukia in humans were\nextensively studied by Abraham Joffe.\n\nFungi are fundamental for life on earth in their roles as symbionts, e.g. in the\nform of mycorrhizae, insect symbionts and lichens. Many fungi are able to break\ndown complex organic biomolecules such as lignin, the more durable component of\nwood, and pollutants such as xenobiotics, petroleum, and polycyclic aromatic\nhydrocarbons. By decomposing these molecules, fungi play a critical role in the\nglobal carbon cycle.\n\nFungi and other organisms traditionally recognized as fungi, such as oomycetes\nand myxomycetes (slime molds), often are economically and socially important as\nsome cause diseases of animals (such as histoplasmosis) as well as plants (such\nas Dutch elm disease and Rice blast).\n\nField meetings to find interesting species of fungi are known as 'forays', after\nthe first such meeting organized by the Woolhope Naturalists' Field Club in 1868\nand entitled \"a foray among the fungi.\"\n\nSome fungi can cause disease in humans or other organisms. The study of\npathogenic fungi is referred to as medical mycology.\n","linknr":380,"url":"Mycology","recorded":1362509040,"links":79,"instances":["fungi","biology","pliny"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Mycology|*"],"headings":["History","Medicinal mycology","See also","Notes","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/Mycena_leaiana_var._australis.jpg/220px-Mycena_leaiana_var._australis.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/Karl_Johanssvamp%2C_Iduns_kokbok.png/25px-Karl_Johanssvamp%2C_Iduns_kokbok.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["truffle","fungi"],["natural_history","pliny"],["classification","biology"]],"members":["truffle","classification","natural_history"],"related":["Greek_language","Biology","Fungus","Genetics","Biochemistry","Taxonomy","Ethnomycology","Tinder","Medicine","Penicillin","Beer","Wine","Cheese","Mushroom","Entheogens","Poison","Infection","Phytopathology","Botany","Evolution","Elias_Magnus_Fries","Christian_Hendrik_Persoon","Anton_de_Bary","Lewis_David_von_Schweinitz","Toxin","Antibiotics","Secondary_metabolism","Cosmopolitan_distribution","Abraham_Joffe","Symbiosis","Mycorrhiza","Insect","Lichens","Organic_compound","Biomolecules","Lignin","Wood","Xenobiotic","Petroleum","Polycyclic_aromatic_hydrocarbon","Carbon_cycle","Oomycetes","Slime_molds","Histoplasmosis","Dutch_elm_disease","Magnaporthe_grisea","Woolhope_Naturalists'_Field_Club","Organism","Pathogenic_fungi","Pathogenic_fungi","Mushroom_hunting","Prehistoric","Euripides","Theophrastos","Pliny_the_elder","Truffle_(fungi)","Natural_History_(Pliny)","Pier_Antonio_Micheli","Florence","Classification_(biology)","Miles_Joseph_Berkeley","China","Japan","Russia","Middle_East","Poland","Belarus","Hadith","Polypores","Reishi","City_of_Hope_National_Medical_Center","Memorial_Sloan–Kettering_Cancer_Center","Blood_sugar","Cancer","Pathogen","Immune_system","Pleurotus_ostreatus","Lovastatin","Vitamin_D","UV_light","Taxol","Penicillin","Lovastatin","Ciclosporin","Griseofulvin","Cephalosporin","Ergometrine","Statins","Fungus","Mycotoxicology","List_of_mycologists","List_of_mycology_journals","Pathogenic_fungi","Fungal_Biochemical_Tests","Protistology","Medicinal_mushrooms","Mushroom_hunting","British_Mycological_Society","Mycological_Society_of_America"]}
