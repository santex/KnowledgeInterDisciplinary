Centromeres were first defined as genetic loci that direct\nthe behaviour of chromosomes. Their physical role is to act as the site of\nassembly of the kinetochore - a highly complex multiprotein structure that is\nresponsible for the actual events of chromosome segregation - e.g. binding\nmicrotubules and signalling to the cell cycle machinery when all chromosomes\nhave adopted correct attachments to the spindle, so that it is safe for cell\ndivision to proceed to completion (i.e. for cells to enter anaphase). There are broadly speaking two types of centromeres. \"Point\ncentromeres\" bind to specific proteins that recognise particular DNA sequences\nwith high efficiency. Any piece of DNA with the point\ncentromere DNA sequence on it will typically form a centomere if present in the\nappropriate species. The best characterised point centromeres are those of the\nbudding yeast, [[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]. \"Regional centromeres\" is the term\ncoined to describe most centromeres, which typically form on regions of\npreferred DNA sequence, but which can form on other DNA sequences as well. The signal for formation of a regional centromere appears to be\nepigenetic. Most organisms, ranging from the fission yeast [[Schizosaccharomyces\npombe]] to humans, have regional centromeres.\n\nRegarding mitotic chromosome structure, centromeres represent a constricted\nregion of the chromosome (often referred to as the primary constriction) where\ntwo identical sister chromatids are most closely in contact. When cells enter\nmitosis, the sister chromatids (which represent the two copies of each\nchromosomal DNA molecule resulting from DNA replication earlier in the cell\ncycle and packaged by histones and other proteins into chromatin) are linked all\nalong their length by the action of the cohesin complex. It is now believed that\nthis complex is mostly released from chromosome arms during prophase, so that by\nthe time the chromosomes line up at the mid-plane of the mitotic spindle (also\nknown as the metaphase plate), the last place where they are linked with one\nanother is in the chromatin in and around the centromere.\n","linknr":420,"url":"Centromere","recorded":1362481144,"links":45,"instances":["human","biology","human","human","human","human"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Chromosomes"],"headings":["Centromere positions","The centromeric sequence","Inheritance","Structure","Centromeric aberrations","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0b/Chromosome.svg/220px-Chromosome.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["chromosome_13","human"],["chromosome_14","human"],["chromosome_15","human"],["chromosome_21","human"],["chromosome_22","human"],["homology","biology"]],"members":["chromosome_13","homology","chromosome_22","chromosome_15","chromosome_21","chromosome_14"],"related":["Chromosome","Spindle_apparatus","Kinetochore","Kinetochore","Microtubules","Anaphase","Epigenetics","Sister_chromatids","Cohesin","Lund's_Amphibious_Rat","Human_genome","Chromosome_13_(human)","Chromosome_14_(human)","Chromosome_15_(human)","Chromosome_21_(human)","Chromosome_22_(human)","Y_chromosome","Robertsonian_translocation","Horse","Homology_(biology)","Conspecificity","Przewalski's_horse","Extant_taxon","Telomeres","House_mouse","DNA","Heterochromatin","Eukaryotes","DNA_sequence","Satellite_DNA","Kinetochore","Epigenetic_inheritance","Heterochromatin","Cohesin","Histone","RNAi","Dicentric_chromosome","Anti-nuclear_antibodies","Anti-centromere_antibodies","Monopolin","Genetics","Cell_biology","Chromatid","Diploid"]}
