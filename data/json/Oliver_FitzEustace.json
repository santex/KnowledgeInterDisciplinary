{"cursor":"2841","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Oliver FitzEustace' ( died after 1491) was an Irish judge. His appointment as\nChief Baron of the Irish Exchequer was a surprising one since according to the\nleading historian of the Irish judiciary he appears to have been mentally\ndeficient and unable to speak. Ball, F. Elrington The Judges in Ireland 1221-\n1921 John Murray London 1926 Vol.1 p. 106\n\nOliver was the son of Rowland FitzEustace, 1st Baron Portlester (died 1496).\nBall believed, probably correctly that he was illegitimate since his father had\nseveral legitimate daughters but died without a male heir to the barony.\nPortlester was, apart from his son-in-law Gerald FitzGerald, 8th Earl of\nKildare, perhaps the dominant Irish statesman of his time, Ball p.106\nand held office as Lord Treasurer of Ireland and Lord Chancellor of Ireland. As\nChancellor he was able to exercise judicial patronage and it was entirely due to\nhis influence that Oliver was made Chief Baron in 1482. Gilbert, J.T.\n\"Roland FitzEustace\" Dictionary of National Biography 1885-1900 Vol.18\np.53\n\nHe was installed without swearing an oath; according to Elrington Ball, this was\nbecause he could not understand or speak it. Ball p.106 Stronger\nevidence of his lack of capacity is that his patent of office gave him the right\nto act through a Deputy, and that over the next decade the office of Chief Baron\nwas normally exercised through a Deputy. Ball p.106 These Deputies-\nJohn Burnell, John Estrete and Clement Fitzleones- were all lawyers of\ndistinction. It seems to have been Oliver's father who made the actual\nappointments.\n\nDuring the rebellion of Lambert Simnel Oliver is listed as one of his\nsupporters; on the face of it this contradicts the claim that he was mentally\ndeficient, but his name may simply have been linked to that of his father, one\nof Simnel's strongest supporters. Gilbert p.53 At any rate he shared\nin the pardon granted by King Henry VII of England to Simnel's followers in\n1488. Ball p.186 Having been removed from office he was restored in\n1491 to act jointly with his former deputy John Burnell. His date of death is\nuncertain.\n\n\n","linknr":101,"url":"Oliver_FitzEustace","recorded":1375066021,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Oliver_FitzEustace&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Oliver_FitzEustace&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Chief_Baron_of_the_Irish_Exchequer","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Rowland_FitzEustace,_1st_Baron_Portlester","/wiki/Barony","/wiki/Gerald_FitzGerald,_8th_Earl_of_Kildare","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Lord_Treasurer_of_Ireland","/wiki/Lord_Chancellor_of_Ireland","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Oath","#cite_note-4","/wiki/Letters_patent","#cite_note-5","/wiki/John_Burnell","/wiki/John_Estrete","/wiki/Clement_Fitzleones","/wiki/Lambert_Simnel","#cite_note-6","/wiki/King_Henry_VII_of_England","#cite_note-7","/w/index.php?title=Oliver_FitzEustace&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","#cite_ref-2","#cite_ref-3","#cite_ref-4","#cite_ref-5","#cite_ref-6","#cite_ref-7","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Oliver_FitzEustace&oldid=564013531","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Irish_judges","/wiki/Category:15th-century_Irish_people","/wiki/Category:People_from_County_Kildare","/wiki/Category:Year_of_death_uncertain","/wiki/Category:Year_of_birth_unknown","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Oliver+FitzEustace&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Oliver+FitzEustace","/wiki/Oliver_FitzEustace","/w/index.php?title=Talk:Oliver_FitzEustace&action=edit&redlink=1","#","/wiki/Oliver_FitzEustace","/w/index.php?title=Oliver_FitzEustace&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Oliver_FitzEustace&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Oliver_FitzEustace","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Oliver_FitzEustace","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Oliver_FitzEustace&oldid=564013531","/w/index.php?title=Oliver_FitzEustace&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7087540","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Oliver_FitzEustace&id=564013531","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Oliver+FitzEustace","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Oliver+FitzEustace&oldid=564013531&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Oliver_FitzEustace&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7087540#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_FitzEustace","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Irish
