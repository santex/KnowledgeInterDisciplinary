Before the introduction of the seed drill, the common practice\nwas to plant seeds by hand. Besides being wasteful, planting was very imprecise\nand led to a poor distribution of seeds, leading to low productivity. Jethro\nTull is widely thought of as having invented the seed drill, though the\nSumerians used a single-tube version, and by the 2nd Century BC, the Chinese\nwere using a multi-tube seed drill. The use of a seed drill can improve the\nratio of crop yield by as much as nine times.\n","linknr":159,"url":"Seed_drill","recorded":1362373366,"links":32,"instances":["agriculturist","tool","farm_implement"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Agricultural machinery","Horticultural techniques","Habitat management equipment and methods","1701 introductions","Chinese inventions","English inventions"],"headings":["Description","History","See also","Notes","Bibliography","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Sowing_machine_Nordsten.jpg/300px-Sowing_machine_Nordsten.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/74/1902_Monitor_seed_drill_detail.jpg/220px-1902_Monitor_seed_drill_detail.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/72/ChineseSeedDrill1637.jpg/220px-ChineseSeedDrill1637.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["hoe","tool"],["jethro_tull","agriculturist"],["planter","farm_implement"]],"members":["jethro_tull","hoe","planter"],"related":["Seeds","Plough","Minneapolis","Minnesota","Sowing","Soil","Crop_yield","Weed","Hoe_(tool)","Song_Yingxing","Encyclopedia","Sumerians","Bologna","England","Jethro_Tull_(agriculturist)","British_Agricultural_Revolution","Soil_loss","Planter_(farm_implement)"]}
