Krug et al.,\n[http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/world_report/en/ \"World\nreport on violence and health\"], World Health Organization, 2002. This\ndefinition associates intentionality with the committing of the act itself,\nirrespective of the outcome it produces.\n\nGlobally, violence takes the lives of more than 1.5 million people annually:\njust over 50% due to suicide, some 35% due to homicide, and just over 12% as a\ndirect result of war or some other form of conflict. For each single death due\nto violence, there are dozens of hospitalizations, hundreds of emergency\ndepartment visits, and thousands of doctors'\nappointments. [http://www.who.int/topics/global_burden_of_disease/en/\n\"Global Burden of Disease\"], World Health Organization, 2008. Furthermore,\nviolence often has lifelong consequences for victims' physical and mental health\nand social functioning and can slow economic and social development.\n\nViolence, however, is preventable. Evidence shows strong relationships between\nlevels of violence and potentially modifiable factors such as concentrated\npoverty, income and gender inequality, the harmful use of alcohol, and the\nabsence of safe, stable, and nurturing relationships between children and\nparents. Scientific research shows that strategies addressing the underlying\ncauses of violence can be effective in preventing violence. Examples of\nscientifically credible strategies to prevent violence include nurse home-\nvisiting and parenting education to prevent child maltreatment; life skills\ntraining for children ages 6â18 years; school-based programmes to address gender\nnorms and attitudes; reducing alcohol availability and misuse through enactment\nand enforcement of liquor licensing laws, taxation and pricing; reducing access\nto guns and knives; and promoting gender equality by, for instance, supporting\nthe economic empowerment of women.
