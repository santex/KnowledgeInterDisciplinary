ISO\n772: 1996. Hydrometric determinations â Vocabulary and symbols.\n\nA 'water level' is a device used for matching elevations of locations that are\ntoo far apart for a spirit level to span. The simplest water level is a section\nof clear tubing, partially filled with water. Water is easily procured for use,\nand easily discarded after use. The ends are held vertical, and the rest of the\ntubing lies on the ground or floor. The water level at each end of the tube will\nbe at the same elevation, whether the two ends are adjacent or far\napart. http://www.deckmagazine.com/article/64.html Making and Using a Water\nLevel Water levels have been used for many years. The water level is lower-\ntech than the laser level, but it can be more accurate over long distances. To\navoid error, all of the water should be at the same temperature. Other sources\nof error include difficulty reading due to meniscus.\n\nIf the water level is used often, dye can be added to the water to make it\neasier to see. If the water level is used outdoors in winter, antifreeze can be\nadded to the water.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Water_level","recorded":1362478002,"links":0,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Construction equipment","Hydrology","Inclinometers","Surveying"],"headings":["References"],"image":[],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Stream","Lake","Reservoir","Spirit_level","Low-technology","Laser_level","Sources_of_error","Meniscus"]}
