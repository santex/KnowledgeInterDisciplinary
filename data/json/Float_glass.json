{"cursor":"8172","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":", London]] 'Float glass' is a sheet of glass made by floating molten glass on a\nbed of molten metal, typically tin, although lead and various low melting point\nalloys were used in the past. This method gives the sheet uniform thickness and\nvery flat surfaces. Modern windows are made from float glass. Most float glass\nis soda-lime glass, but relatively minor quantities of specialty borosilicate [http://www.schott.com/hometech/english/products/borofloat/index.html Schott\nBorofloat] and flat panel display glass are also produced using the float\nglass process. Not all flat panel display glass is produced by the float\nglass process. The company Corning is using the overflow downdraw technique,\nwhile Schott uses the float glass technique (see\n[http://www.schott.com/fpd/english/lcd_glass/index.html Schott website]).\nThe float glass process is also known as the 'Pilkington process', named after\nthe British glass manufacturer Pilkington, which pioneered the technique\n(invented by Sir Alastair Pilkington) in the 1950s.\n","linknr":227,"url":"Float_glass","recorded":1362481686,"links":27,"instances":["window","glass","glassmaking"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Glass forming","Glass types","Glass architecture","History of glass","English inventions","Industrial processes"],"headings":["History","Manufacture","Market","See also","References and footnotes","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/CrystalPalaceStation.jpg/220px-CrystalPalaceStation.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/10/Windowfloatnofloat.jpg/220px-Windowfloatnofloat.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["crown_glass","window"],["lehr","glassmaking"],["annealing","glass"]],"members":["crown_glass","annealing","lehr"],"related":["London","Glass","Tin","Lead","Melting_point","Window","Soda-lime_glass","Borosilicate","Flat_panel_display","Corning_Incorporated","Overflow_downdraw_method","Schott_Glass","Pilkington","Alastair_Pilkington","Jena","Germany","Flat_glass","Crown_glass_(window)","Glassblowing","Cylinder_blown_sheet","Cylinder_method","Henry_Bessemer","England","Engineer","Iron","Alastair_Pilkington","Tin","Sand","Sodium_carbonate","Dolomite","Limestone","Sodium_sulfate","Glass_batch","Cullet","Specific_gravity","Tin","Immiscible","Redox","Tin_dioxide","Positive_pressure","Nitrogen","Hydrogen","Lehr_(glassmaking)","Annealing_(glass)","Asahi_Glass","Nippon_Sheet_Glass","Pilkington","Saint-Gobain","Guardian_Industries","PPG_Industries","Hankuk","Soda-lime_glass","Glass_production","Glass_batch_calculation"]}
