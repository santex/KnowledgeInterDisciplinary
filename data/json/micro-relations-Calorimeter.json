These experiments mark the foundation of thermochemistry.]] A\n 'calorimeter' (from Latin calor, meaning heat) is an object used for\n calorimetry, or the process of measuring the heat of chemical reactions or\n physical changes as well as heat capacity. Differential scanning calorimeters,\n isothermal microcalorimeters, titration calorimeters and accelerated rate\n calorimeters are among the most common types. A simple calorimeter just\n consists of a thermometer attached to a metal container full of water suspended\n above a combustion chamber.\n\nTo find the enthalpy change per mole of a substance A in a reaction between two\nsubstances A and B, the substances are added to a calorimeter and the initial\nand final temperatures (before the reaction started and after it has finished)\nare noted. Multiplying the temperature change by the mass and specific heat\ncapacities of the substances gives a value for the energy given off or absorbed\nduring the reaction. Dividing the energy change by how many moles of A were\npresent gives its enthalpy change of reaction. This method is used primarily in\nacademic teaching as it describes the theory of calorimetry. It does not account\nfor the heat loss through the container or the heat capacity of the thermometer\nand container itself. In addition, the object placed inside the calorimeter\nshows that the objects transferred their heat to the calorimeter and into the\nliquid, and the heat absorbed by the calorimeter and the liquid is equal to the\nheat given off by the metals.\n","linknr":307,"url":"Calorimeter","recorded":1362504987,"links":49,"instances":["unit","unit"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Measuring instruments","Laboratory equipment"],"headings":["History","Adiabatic calorimeters","Reaction calorimeters","Bomb calorimeters","Calvet-type calorimeters","Constant-pressure calorimeter","Differential scanning calorimeter","Isothermal titration calorimeter","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/Ice-calorimeter.jpg/150px-Ice-calorimeter.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/34/Bombenkalorimeter_mit_bombe.jpg/220px-Bombenkalorimeter_mit_bombe.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/Bomb_Calorimeter.png/220px-Bomb_Calorimeter.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/3/e/73e14f0cd30264b60f30515c85cc0c83.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/c/c/4cc09c1eee8b979e9ea1ff822b3fd26c.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/1/9/e/19e2c87dfcd499d96746ef27b99584a5.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/3/e/c/3ecdbbc9a64a9bfc57883ae306bf51cd.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/6/1/e/61e9c06ea9a85a5088a499df6458d276.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/6/9/6/69691c7bdcc3ce6d5d8a1361f22d04ac.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/b/2/fb2925b3bfa2ac9668f179b807a7cd3b.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/1/d/3/1d34cc52cfbe5334f5b8b09156096c7d.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["mole","unit"],["bar","unit"]],"members":["bar","mole"],"related":["Pierre-Simon_Laplace","Heat","Chemical_change","Joseph_Black","Latent_heat","Thermochemistry","Latin","Heat","Calorimetry","Chemical_reaction","Physical_change","Heat_capacity","Enthalpy","Mole_(unit)","Temperature","Specific_heat_capacity","Energy","Antoine_Lavoisier","Guinea_pig","Adiabatic_process","Chemical_reaction","Benzoic_acid","Joule_effect","Enthalpy","Solution","Atmospheric_pressure","Styrofoam","Thermal_insulation","Heat_flow","Aluminium","Heat_capacity","Thermocouple","Law_of_heat_conduction","Ohm's_law","Integral","Polymer","Gold","Pressure","Bar_(unit)","Exothermic","Chemical_stability","Activation_energy","Ambient_temperature","Titration","Stoichiometry","Biochemistry","Enzyme","Enthalpy","Heat","Calorie","Heat_of_combustion","Calorimeter_constant"]}
