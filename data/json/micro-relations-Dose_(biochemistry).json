In\nmedicine, the term is usually applied to the quantity of a drug or other agent\nadministered for therapeutic purposes. In toxicology 'dose' may refer to the\namount of a harmful agent (such as a poison, carcinogen, mutagen, or teratogen),\nto which an organism is exposed.\n\nChemicals are the most common things for which doses are measured, but there are\nothers, such as radiation exposure. For humans, most doses of micronutrients and\nmedications are measured in milligrams (mg), but some are measured in micrograms\nbecause of their potency. Nonmedicinal poisons span the measurement scale; some\npoisons are so dangerous that a single microgram of it could be deadly, whereas\nother substances take much more. For example, even water is toxic when consumed\nin large enough quantities.\n","linknr":135,"url":"Dose_(biochemistry)","recorded":1362676196,"links":33,"instances":["medicine","medicine"],"pdf":["http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/cgi/reprint/18/7/853.pdf"],"categories":["Pharmacology","Toxicology"],"headings":["Effects are dose-dependent","Calculation of dose","Biological agents","Toxicology","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["adverse_effect","medicine"],["injection","medicine"]],"members":["adverse_effect","injection"],"related":["Chemical","Biological","Nutrition","Nutrient","Dietary_supplement","Medicine","Drug","Therapeutic","Toxicology","Poison","Carcinogen","Mutagen","Teratogen","Micronutrients","Microgram","Water_intoxication","Quantity","Therapeutic_effect","Adverse_effect_(medicine)","Time","Drug_delivery","Inhalation","Ingestion","Transdermal_patch","Injection_(medicine)","Suppository","Body_surface_area","Toxicology","Median_lethal_dose","Occupational_Safety_and_Health_Administration"]}
