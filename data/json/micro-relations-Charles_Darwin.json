By the 1870s the\nscientific community and much of the general public had accepted evolution as\na fact. However, many favoured competing explanations and it was not until the\nemergence of the modern evolutionary synthesis from the 1930s to the 1950s\nthat a broad consensus developed in which natural selection was the basic\nmechanism of evolution. In modified\nform, Darwin's scientific discovery is the unifying theory of the life\nsciences, explaining the diversity of life. [http://darwin-\nonline.org.uk/biography.html The Complete Works of Darwin Online â Biography.]\ndarwin-online.org.uk. Retrieved 2006-12-15 As Darwinian\nscholar Joseph Carroll of the University of MissouriâSt. Louis puts it in his\nintroduction to a modern reprint of Darwin's work: \"The Origin of Species has\nspecial claims on our attention. It is one of the two or three most\nsignificant works of all timeâone of those works that fundamentally and\npermanently alter our vision of the world...It is argued with a singularly\nrigorous consistency but it is also eloquent, imaginatively evocative, and\nrhetorically compelling.\" \n\nDarwin's early interest in nature led him to neglect his medical education at\nthe University of Edinburgh; instead, he helped to investigate marine\ninvertebrates. Studies at the University of Cambridge encouraged his passion for\nnatural science. His five-year voyage on established him\nas an eminent geologist whose observations and theories supported Charles\nLyell's uniformitarian ideas, and publication of his journal of the voyage made\nhim famous as a popular author.\n\nPuzzled by the geographical distribution of wildlife and fossils he collected on\nthe voyage, Darwin began detailed investigations and in 1838 conceived his\ntheory of natural selection. Although he discussed his ideas with\nseveral naturalists, he needed time for extensive research and his geological\nwork had priority. He was writing up his theory in 1858 when Alfred\nRussel Wallace sent him an essay which described the same idea, prompting\nimmediate joint publication of both of their theories. Darwin's work\nestablished evolutionary descent with modification as the dominant scientific\nexplanation of diversification in nature. In 1871 he examined\nhuman evolution and sexual selection in [[The Descent of Man|The Descent of Man,\nand Selection in Relation to Sex]], followed by [[The Expression of the Emotions\nin Man and Animals]]. His research on plants was published in a series of books,\nand in his final book, he examined earthworms and their effect on\nsoil.\n\nIn recognition of Darwin's pre-eminence as a scientist, he was honoured with a\nmajor ceremonial funeral and buried in Westminster Abbey, close to John Herschel\nand Isaac Newton. Darwin has been described as\none of the most influential figures in human history.\n","linknr":2162,"url":"Charles_Darwin","recorded":1362509338,"links":200,"instances":["bird","historical","science","keeling_islands","tortoise","london","religious_movement","evolution","publisher","mathematician","andes","biology","biology","classification_of_human_beings","summary","magazine"],"pdf":["http://www.springerlink.com/content/n1gh3n4474th3385/fulltext.pdf","http://www.springerlink.com/content/n1gh3n4474th3385/fulltext.pdf","http://speakingoffaith.publicradio.org/programs/darwin/moore-devilschaplain.pdf","http://speakingoffaith.publicradio.org/programs/darwin/moore-devilschaplain.pdf","http://www.sulloway.org/Finches.pdf","http://www.sulloway.org/Finches.pdf","http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20090326070105/http://www.psych.uni-goettingen.de/abt/1/sydow/von_Sydow_(2005)_Darwin_A_Christian_Undermining_Christianity.pdf","http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20090326070105/http://www.psych.uni-goettingen.de/abt/1/sydow/von_Sydow_(2005)_Darwin_A_Christian_Undermining_Christianity.pdf"],"categories":["Charles
