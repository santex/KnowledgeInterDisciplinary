{"cursor":"65268","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\n, such as York Minster.]]\n\n'City status in the United Kingdom' is granted by the British monarch to a\nselect group of communities. The holding of city status gives a settlement no\nspecial rights other than that of calling itself a \"city\". Nonetheless, this\nappellation carries its own prestige and, consequently, competitions for the\nstatus are hard fought. The status does not apply automatically on the basis of\nany particular criteria, although in England and Wales it was traditionally\ngiven to towns with diocesan cathedrals. This association between having a\ncathedral and being called a city was established in the early 1540s when King\nHenry VIII founded dioceses (each having a cathedral in the see city) in six\nEnglish towns and also granted them city status by issuing letters patent.\n\nCity status in Ireland was granted to far fewer communities than in England\nand Wales, and there are only two pre-nineteenth century cities in present-\nday Northern Ireland. In Scotland, city status did not explicitly receive any\nrecognition by the state until the nineteenth century. At that time, a\nrevival of grants of city status took place, first in England, where the\ngrants were accompanied by the establishment of new cathedrals, and later in\nScotland and Ireland.\n\nIn the twentieth century, it was explicitly recognised that the status of city\nin England and Wales would no longer be bound to the presence of a cathedral,\nand grants made since have been awarded to communities on a variety of criteria,\nincluding population size.\n\nThe abolition of some corporate bodies as part of successive local government\nreforms, beginning with the Municipal Corporations (Ireland) Act 1840, has\ndeprived some ancient cities of their status. However, letters patent have been\nissued for most of the affected cities to ensure the continuation or restoration\nof their status. At present, Rochester and Elgin are the only former cities in\nthe United Kingdom.\n\nThe suffix \"City\" does not, in itself, denote city status; it may be appended to\nlocations for reasons of historical association (e.g. White City) or for\nmarketing purposes (e.g. Stratford City).\n","linknr":1220,"url":"City_status_in_the_United_Kingdom","recorded":1362893220,"links":39,"instances":["city","united_kingdom","scotland_act_1994","manner_of_address","ireland_act_1840","scotland_act_1973"],"pdf":["http://www.northampton.gov.uk/downloads/NorthamptonMMSreport1.pdf"],"categories":["Cities
