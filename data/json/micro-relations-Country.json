A country may be an independent sovereign state or one that is\noccupied by another state, as a non-sovereign or formerly sovereign political\ndivision, or a geographic region associated with sets of previously independent\nor differently associated peoples with distinct political characteristics.\nRegardless of the physical geography, in the modern internationally accepted\nlegal definition as defined by the League of Nations in 1937 and reaffirmed by\nthe United Nations in 1945, a resident of a country is subject to the\nindependent exercise of legal jurisdiction.\n\nSometimes the word country is used to refer both to sovereign states and to\nother political entities, while other times it\nrefers only to states. For example, the [[CIA World Factbook]] uses\nthe word in its \"Country name\" field to refer to \"a wide variety of\ndependencies, areas of special sovereignty, uninhabited islands, and other\nentities in addition to the traditional countries or independent\nstates\".
