property or attribute (= ) of an\nentity) may refer to:\n\nIn 'physics' and 'engineering', any characteristic curve that shows the\nrelationship between certain input and output parameters, for example: *I-V or\ncurrent-voltage characteristic, the current in a circuit as a function of the\napplied voltage *Receiver operating characteristic\n\nIn 'navigation':\n* Light characteristic, pattern of a lighted beacon\n\nIn 'mathematics':\n* Characteristic (algebra) of a ring, the smallest common cycle length of the\n  ring's addition operation\n* Characteristic function (disambiguation), usually the indicator function of a\n  subset, though the term has other meanings in specific domains\n* Characteristic polynomial, a polynomial associated to a square matrix in\n  linear algebra\n* Characteristic vector, another name for eigenvector of a matrix\n* Characteristic value, another name for eigenvalue of a matrix\n* Characteristic word, a subclass of Sturmian word\n* Euler characteristic, a topological invariant\n* Characteristic subgroup, a subgroup that is invariant under all automorphisms\n  in group theory\n* Method of characteristics, a technique for solving
