Today, the term is\napplied to nurses, accountants, educators, scientists, technology experts,\nsocial workers, artists, librarians (information professionals) and many more.\n\nThe term is also used in sports to differentiate amateur players from those who\nare paid—hence \"professional footballer\" and \"professional golfer\". Many\ncompanies include the word professional in their store name to imply the quality\nof their workmanship or service.\n\nIn some cultures, the term is used as shorthand to describe a particular social\nstratum of well-educated, salaried workers who enjoy considerable work autonomy\nand are commonly engaged in creative and intellectually challenging work.<ref\nname=\"Gilbert\">Gilbert, D.
