{"cursor":"2807","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nThe 'first-pass effect' (also known as 'first-pass metabolism' or 'presystemic\nmetabolism') is a phenomenon of drug metabolism whereby the concentration of a\ndrug is greatly reduced before it reaches the systemic circulation. It is the\nfraction of lost drug during the process of absorption which is generally\nrelated to the liver and gut wall. Notable drugs that experience a significant\nfirst-pass effect are imipramine, morphine, propranolol, buprenorphine,\ndiazepam, midazolam, demerol, cimetidine, and lidocaine.\n\nAfter a drug is swallowed, it is absorbed by the digestive system and enters the\nhepatic portal system. It is carried through the portal vein into the liver\nbefore it reaches the rest of the body. The liver metabolizes many drugs,\nsometimes to such an extent that only a small amount of active drug emerges from\nthe liver to the rest of the circulatory system. This first pass through the\nliver thus greatly reduces the bioavailability of the drug. Alternative routes\nof administration like suppository, intravenous, intramuscular, inhalational\naerosol and sublingual avoid the first-pass effect because they allow drugs to\nbe absorbed directly into the systemic circulation.\n\nThe four primary systems that affect the first pass effect of a drug are the\nenzymes of the gastrointestinal lumen, gut wall enzymes, bacterial enzymes, and\nhepatic enzymes.\n\nIn drug design, drug candidates may have good druglikeness but fail on first-\npass metabolism, because it is biochemically selective.\n\nThe first pass effect can also be exploited for a beneficial effect. Some\nprodrugs, for example codeine (methylmorphine, inactive) are converted from an\ninactive form to the pharmacologically active form (morphine proper) by first\npass metabolism (in this case, demethylation).\n","linknr":143,"url":"First-pass_metabolism","recorded":1362504802,"links":28,"instances":["anatomy"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Pharmacokinetics","Medicinal chemistry"],"headings":["See also","References and external links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/FlattenedRoundPills.jpg/40px-FlattenedRoundPills.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["lumen","anatomy"]],"members":["lumen"],"related":["Drug_metabolism","Concentration","Medication","Liver","Imipramine","Morphine","Propranolol","Buprenorphine","Diazepam","Midazolam","Demerol","Cimetidine","Lidocaine","Digestive_system","Hepatic_portal_system","Hepatic_portal_vein","Liver","Metabolism","Circulatory_system","Bioavailability","Route_of_administration","Suppository","Intravenous","Intramuscular","Sublingual","Systemic_circulation","Gastrointestinal_tract","Lumen_(anatomy)","Drug_design","Druglikeness","Prodrug","Codeine","Demethylation","ADME","Pharmacokinetics","Pharmacology","Biopharmaceutics_Classification_System","Drug","Partition_coefficient","National_Library_of_Medicine","University_of_Nottingham"]}
