{"cursor":"6725","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nAn 'internal model' is a postulated neural process that simulates the response\nof the motor system in order to estimate the outcome of a motor command.\n\nThe internal model theory of motor control argues that the motor system is\ncontrolled by the constant interactions of the âplantâ and the âcontroller.â The\nplant is the body part being controlled, while the internal model itself is\nconsidered part of the controller. Information from the controller, such as\ninformation from the CNS, feedback information, and the efference copy, is sent\nto the plant which moves accordingly.\n\nInternal models can be controlled through either feed-forward or feedback\ncontrol. Feed-forward control computes its input into a system using only the\ncurrent state and its model of the system. It does not use feedback, so it\ncannot correct for errors in its control. In feedback control, some of the\noutput of the system can be fed back into the systemâs input, and the system is\nthen able to make adjustments or compensate for errors from its desired output.\nTwo primary types of internal models have been proposed: forward models and\ninverse models. In simulations, models can be combined together to solve more\ncomplex movement tasks.\n","linknr":121,"url":"Internal_model","recorded":1362374858,"links":15,"instances":["control_theory","control"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Motor control","Neuroscience","Control theory"],"headings":["Forward models","Inverse models","Combined forward and inverse models","Adaptive Control theory","Scientists","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/79/Basic_Forward_Model.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3e/Basic_Internal_Model.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/75/Inverse_Model.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["controller","control_theory"],["feed_forward","control"]],"members":["controller","feed_forward"],"related":["Controller_(control_theory)","Efference_copy","Feed_forward_(control)","Feedback","Adaptive_control","Michael_I._Jordan","Emmanuel_Todorov","Daniel_Wolpert","Sandro_Mussa-Ivaldi","Mitsuo_Kawato","Claude_Ghez","Reza_Shadmehr","John_Krakauer","Jon_Krakauer","Pietro_Mazzoni","Maurice_A._Smith","Kurt_Thoroughman","Joern_Diedrichsen","Amy_Bastian"]}
