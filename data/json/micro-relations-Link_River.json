McArthur, p. 580 Draining a basin of , the\nriver begins at the southern end of Klamath Lake and flows a short distance to\nthe Link River Dam and continues to the head of Lake Ewauna. The \"falls\" from\nwhich Klamath Falls derives its name, and which in reality are best described as\nrapids rather than falls, are visible a short distance below the dam, though the\nwater flow is generally insufficient to provide water flow over the rocks. The\nKlamath River begins at the narrow southern end of Lake Ewauna and flows from\nthere to the Pacific Ocean.\n\nBefore settlers came to the Klamath Basin, the Link River was known to the local\nKlamaths as Yulalona, meaning \"back and forth.\" At times,\nstrong winds blew the water upstream into Klamath Lake and partly drained the\nriverbed.\n\nAfter its founding in 1867, Klamath Falls was originally named Linkville. The name was changed to Klamath Falls in 1892â€“93.
