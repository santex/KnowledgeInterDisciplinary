Thomas (1863â1947):\n\n\n\nIn other words, the interpretation of a situation causes the action. This\ninterpretation is not objective. Actions are affected by subjective perceptions\nof situations. Whether there even is an objectively correct interpretation is\nnot important for the purposes of helping guide individuals' behavior.\n\nIn 1923, Thomas stated more precisely that any definition of a situation will\ninfluence the present. Not only that, butâafter a series of definitions in which\nan individual is involvedâsuch a definition also \"gradually [influences] a whole\nlife-policy and the personality of the individual himself.\" The Unadjusted\nGirl.
