{"cursor":"72493","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In language structure, a 'diminutive', or 'diminutive form'\n(abbreviated ), is a formation of a word used to convey a slight degree of the\nroot meaning, smallness of the object or quality named, encapsulation, intimacy,\nor endearment. Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, 6th\nedition It is the opposite of an augmentative. While many languages apply\nthe grammatical diminutive to nouns, a few also use it for adjectives and even\nother parts of speech (see Dutch, Italian, Latin, Romanian, Portuguese, Polish,\nRussian, Slovene, and Yiddish examples below).\n\nDiminutives are often used for the purpose of expressing affection (see nickname\nand hypocoristic). In many languages, the meaning of diminution can be\ntranslated \"tiny\" or \"wee\", and diminutives are used frequently when speaking to\nsmall children; adult people sometimes use diminutives when they express extreme\ntenderness and intimacy by behaving and talking like children. (See\nApocopation.) In some languages, diminutives are formed in a regular way by\nadding affixes to nouns and proper names; in English the alteration of meaning\nis often conveyed through clipping, either alone or combined with an affix. Beyond the diminutive form of a single word, a diminutive can be a\nmulti-word name, such as \"Tiny Tim\" or \"Little Dorrit\". English\ndiminutives tend to be shorter and more colloquial than the basic form of the\nword; diminutives formed by adding affixes in other languages are often longer\nand not necessarily colloquial.\n\nIn many languages, formation of diminutives by adding suffixes is a productive\npart of the language. \"The Standards Site: Glossary - D to F\",\nCrown Copyright, 1997-2008, webpage: [http://www.standards.dfes.gov.uk/secondar-\ny/keystage3/respub/mflframework/appendices/glossary_of_terms/d_to_f/ Gov-UK-Glossary-\nDEF].  All nouns, not just proper nouns can be diminuted. The word\n\"diminutive\" is used in a narrower and less vague sense here than when referring\nto English. The basic meaning of diminution in these languages is \"smallness of\nthe object named\"; endearment, intimacy, etc. is secondary and dependent on\ncontext. For example, the name of one of the last Roman emperors of the western\npart of the Roman EmpireâRomulus Augustusâwas diminuted to Romulus Augustulus\n(little Augustus) to emphasise the contrast between the grandness of the name\nand political insignificance of its bearer; in this case the connotation of\ndiminution is derogatory, not endearing.\n\nA 'double diminutive' is a diminutive form with two diminutive suffixes\nrather than one.\n","linknr":812,"url":"Diminutive","recorded":1362538009,"links":62,"instances":["given_name","name","mythology","name","gloves","linguistics","scented_bag","linguistics","armour","linguistics","manner_of_address","diacritic","linguistics","place","given_name","morphology","stream","clothing","linguistics"],"pdf":["http://userpage.fu-berlin.de/~alvismal/6etym.pdf","http://www.plc.psychologia.pl/plc/contents/fulltext/07-1_3.pdf"],"categories":["Linguistic
