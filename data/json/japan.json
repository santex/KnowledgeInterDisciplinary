Located in the Pacific\nOcean, it lies to the east of the Sea of Japan, China, North Korea, South\nKorea and Russia, stretching from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north to the East\nChina Sea and Taiwan in the south. The characters that make up Japan's name\nmean \"sun-origin\", which is why Japan is sometimes referred to as the \"Land of\nthe Rising Sun\".\n\nJapan is an archipelago of 6,852 islands. The four largest islands are Honshu,\nHokkaido, Kyushu, and Shikoku, which together comprise about ninety-seven\npercent of Japan's land area. Japan has the world's tenth-largest population,\nwith over 126&nbsp;million people. Honshū's Greater Tokyo Area, which includes\nthe ''de facto'' capital city of Tokyo and several surrounding prefectures, is\nthe largest metropolitan area in the world, with over 30 million residents.\n\nArchaeological research indicates that people lived in Japan as early as the\nUpper Paleolithic period. The first written mention of Japan is in Chinese\nhistory texts from the 1st century&nbsp;AD. Influence from other nations\nfollowed by long periods of isolation has characterized Japan's history. From\nthe 12th century until 1868, Japan was ruled by successive feudal military\ndictatorships (shogunates) in the name of the Emperor. Japan entered into a long\nperiod of isolation in the early 17th century, which was only ended in 1853 when\na United States fleet pressured Japan to open to the West. Nearly two decades of\ninternal conflict and insurrection followed before the Meiji Emperor was\nrestored as head of state in 1868 and the Empire of Japan was proclaimed, with\nthe Emperor as a divine symbol of the nation. In the late 19th and early 20th\ncenturies, victory in the First Sino-Japanese War, the Russo-Japanese War and\nWorld War I allowed Japan to expand its empire during a period of increasing\nmilitarism. The Second Sino-Japanese War of 1937 expanded into part of World War\nII in 1941, which came to an end in 1945 following the atomic bombings of\nHiroshima and Nagasaki. Since adopting its revised constitution in 1947, Japan\nhas maintained a unitary constitutional monarchy with an emperor and an elected\nlegislature called the Diet.\n\nA major economic power,<ref name=\"cia\"></ref> Japan has the world's third-\nlargest economy by nominal GDP and the world's fourth-largest economy by\npurchasing power parity. It is also the world's fourth-largest exporter and fourth-\nlargest importer. Although Japan has officially renounced its right to declare\nwar, it maintains a modern military with the sixth largest military\nbudget,<ref></ref> used for self-defense and peacekeeping roles. After\nSingapore, Japan has the lowest homicide rate (including attempted homicide) in\nthe world.<ref></ref> According to Japan's health ministry, Japanese women have\nthe second highest life expectancy of any country in the world.<ref></ref>\nAccording to the United Nations, Japan also has the third lowest infant\nmortality rate.<ref name=\"haaretz.com\"></ref><ref name=\"Table
