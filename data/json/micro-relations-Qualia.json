{"cursor":"65824","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Qualia' ( or ; singular form: 'quale' () is a term used in philosophy to refer\nto individual instances of subjective, conscious experience. The term derives\nfrom a Latin word meaning for \"what sort\" or \"what kind.\" Examples of qualia are\nthe pain of a headache, the taste of wine, or the perceived redness of an\nevening sky.\n\nDaniel Dennett (b.1942), American philosopher and cognitive scientist, writes\nthat qualia is \"an unfamiliar term for something that could not be more familiar\nto each of us: the ways things seem to us.\" Erwin SchrÃ¶dinger (1887-\n1961), the famous physicist, had this counter-materialist take:\n:\"The sensation of color cannot be accounted for by the physicist's objective\n:picture of light-waves. Could the physiologist account for it, if he had fuller\n:knowledge than he has of the processes in the retina and the nervous processes\n:set up by them in the optical nerve bundles and in the brain? I do not think\n:so.\"\n\nThe importance of qualia in philosophy of mind comes largely from the fact that\nit is seen as posing a fundamental problem for materialist explanations of the\nmind-body problem. Much of the debate over their importance hinges on the\ndefinition of the term that is used, as various philosophers emphasize or deny\nthe existence of certain features of qualia. As such, the nature and existence\nof qualia are controversial.\n","linknr":568,"url":"Qualia","recorded":1362373697,"links":52,"instances":["philosopher","philosophy_of_mind","philosophy","science"],"pdf":["http://www.unicog.org/publications/Ramachandran_JCS01.pdf","http://www.unicog.org/publications/Ramachandran_JCS01.pdf","http://www.imprint.co.uk/rama/qualia.pdf"],"categories":["Consciousness studies","Perception","Philosophy of mind","Concepts in metaphysics","Mind","Qualia"],"headings":["Definitions","Arguments for the existence of qualia","Critics of qualia","Proponents of qualia","Neurological blending of perspectives","Other issues","See also","Notes","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/25/Red.svg/150px-Red.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/Inverted_qualia_of_colour_strawberry.jpg/250px-Inverted_qualia_of_colour_strawberry.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Wikibooks-logo-en-noslogan.svg/40px-Wikibooks-logo-en-noslogan.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/Socrates.png/18px-Socrates.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["objectivity","science"],["identity","philosophy"],["dualism","philosophy_of_mind"],["michael_tye","philosopher"],["dualism","philosophy_of_mind"]],"members":["michael_tye","dualism","identity","objectivity"],"related":["Philosophy","Subjective","Consciousness","Latin","Daniel_Dennett","American_philosopher","Cognitive_scientist","Erwin_Schrödinger","Philosophy_of_mind","Materialist","Mind-body_dichotomy","Clarence_Irving_Lewis","Frank_Cameron_Jackson","Daniel_Dennett","Perception","Analogy","Nanometer","Argument","Saul_Kripke","Philosophical_zombie","Physicalism","Thought_experiment","Thomas_Nagel","Objectivity_(science)","Reductionism","John_Locke","Identity_(philosophy)","Modal_logic","Philosophical_zombie","Epistemological","Frank_Cameron_Jackson","Thought_experiment","Physicalism","Epiphenomenalism","Causality","Dualism_(philosophy_of_mind)","Daniel_Dennett","Thought_experiment","Intuition_pump","Mary's_room","Paul_Churchland","Feral_child","Visual_cortex","Brain","Color","Gary_Drescher","Common_Lisp","David_Kellogg_Lewis","Artificial_intelligence","Marvin_Minsky","Michael_Tye_(philosopher)","David_Chalmers","Hard_problem_of_consciousness","Jonathan_Lowe","Bertrand_Russell","Gilbert_Ryle","A.J._Ayer","V.S._Ramachandran","William_Hirstein","Howard_Robinson","Sense-data","Physicalist","Phosphenes","Erwin_Schrödinger","Rodolfo_Llinás","Nietzsche","Kant","Thing_in_itself","Indeterminacy_in_philosophy","Immanuel_Kant","Phenomena","Epiphenomenalism","Interactionist_dualism","Emergentism","John_McDowell","Epistemological","Veil_of_perception","Relativism","Solipsism","Epistemic","Hermann_von_Helmholtz","Philosophy_of_mind","Materialists","Dualists","John_Hagelin","Direct_realism","Consciousness","David_Chalmers","Dualism_(philosophy_of_mind)","Form_constant","Hard_problem_of_consciousness","Mind_body_problem","Philosophy_of_mind","Self-reference","Subjectivity","Subject-object_problem","Synesthesia","David_Chalmers","Vilayanur_S._Ramachandran","William_Hirstein","Richard_Gregory"]}
