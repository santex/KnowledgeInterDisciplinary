The oscillations in\na resonator can be either electromagnetic or mechanical (including acoustic).\nResonators are used to either generate waves of specific frequencies or to\nselect specific frequencies from a signal. Musical instruments use acoustic\nresonators that produce sound waves of specific tones.\n\nA 'cavity resonator', usually used in reference to electromagnetic resonators,\nis one in which waves exist in a hollow space inside the device. Acoustic cavity\nresonators, in which sound is produced by air vibrating in a cavity with one\nopening, are known as Helmholtz resonators.\n",
