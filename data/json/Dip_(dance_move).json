{"cursor":"3003","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n]] 'Dips' are common to many dance forms (Tango, Lindy Hop, Salsa,\nBallroom dances).\n\nStandard: The flyer usually balances herself. The flyer's body may be horizontal\nor vertical. There are many grips for bases. The base uses a one-handed grip if\nflyer is experienced. In performance, flyer may turn her torso sideways toward\nthe audience or toward the base. In social dance, they flyer usually turns her\ntorso toward the base. The lead can use a two-handed grip for inexperienced\npartners when social dancing.\n\nTango: The follow's leg locks around the lead's right leg. The\nflyer can support herself, if she has strong stomach muscles.\n\nTango Swoop: The flyer leans back (torso horizontal) and moves in a circle and\nthen returns to vertical.\n\nShoulder Support (Right): When the follow spins to her left, the lead may grip\nher left shoulder with his right arm. She will stop spinning when his right arm\nblocks her body. This leads to a natural dip, where she simply leans back while\nhe supports her by holding her shoulder. Note: Never hold her neck.\n\nShoulder Support (Left): When the follow spins to her left, the lead may grip\nher left shoulder or upper arm, with his left hand. She will stop spinning when\nhis arm left blocks her body. During her spin, the lead's right hand holds the\nfollow's right hand. This leads to a natural dip, where she simply leans back,\nwhile he supports her with both hands: his right hand holds her right hand\nbehind his neck and his left hand holds her left shoulder.\n\nLean: The base and flyer stand side by side, with the base's hand on her hip.\nThe base lunges sideways, away from the flyer, holding her hip to his. She keeps\none leg straight and styles with the other, often a figure-4 knee bend.\n\nLean to Standard: From a lean, the follow rolls forward into a normal dip.\n\nBetween the Legs: The lead steps over her torso.\n\nStraddle: The flyer bends back horizontally. The lead steps over her torso, then\nmoves his feet together so his feet touch. The flyer is supported by his feet.\n\nDeath Drop: From cuddle position, with a circus grip. Flyer leans forward and\nfalls as far a grip allows, which is not very far. Then the lead slips the\ncuddle arm out and the flyer falls again as far as the grip allows. Spotters\nshould be under where the flyer's head will go.\n\nOne-handed coin swooping dip (Trance): Whilst dipping your partner with the one\nhanded gripping technique, lower your torso until in a vertical position and\nwithin reach of the dance floor. There is a slight pelvic sway in sync with the\ntrance beat. With your free hand collect the coin, and then return to the\nupright position. The position of your leading thigh is key in making this\npopular move successful\n","linknr":87,"url":"Dip_(dance_move)","recorded":1364161452,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Dip_(dance_move)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Dip_(dance_move)&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dip_(dance_move)&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/File:Salsa_dance_dip.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/Salsa_dance_dip.jpg/200px-Salsa_dance_dip.jpg","/wiki/File:Salsa_dance_dip.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Salsa_(dance)","/wiki/Dance","/wiki/Tango_(dance)","/wiki/Lindy_Hop","/wiki/Salsa_(dance)","/wiki/Ballroom_dance","/w/index.php?title=Dip_(dance_move)&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Lead_and_follow","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dip_(dance_move)&oldid=412476526","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Dance_moves","/wiki/Category:Articles_lacking_sources_from_February_2009","/wiki/Category:All_articles_lacking_sources","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Dip+%28dance+move%29&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Dip+%28dance+move%29","/wiki/Dip_(dance_move)","/wiki/Talk:Dip_(dance_move)","#","/wiki/Dip_(dance_move)","/w/index.php?title=Dip_(dance_move)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Dip_(dance_move)&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Dip_(dance_move)","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Dip_(dance_move)","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Dip_(dance_move)&oldid=412476526","/w/index.php?title=Dip_(dance_move)&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Dip_%28dance_move%29&id=412476526","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Dip+%28dance+move%29","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Dip+%28dance+move%29&oldid=412476526&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Dip_(dance_move)&printable=yes","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dip_(dance_move)","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=skins.vector&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","/w/index.php?title=MediaWiki:Gadget-ReferenceTooltips.js&action=raw&ctype=text/javascript&508635914","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":["dance","dance"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Dance
