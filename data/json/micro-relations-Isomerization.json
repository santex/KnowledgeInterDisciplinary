{"cursor":"4639","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In chemistry 'isomerization' (also 'isomerisation') is the process by which one\nmolecule is transformed into another molecule which has exactly the same atoms,\nbut the atoms are rearranged e.g. A-B-C â B-A-C (these related molecules are\nknown as isomers ). In some molecules and under some conditions,\nisomerization occurs spontaneously. Many isomers are equal or roughly equal in\nbond energy, and so exist in roughly equal amounts, provided that they can\ninterconvert relatively freely, that is the energy barrier between the two\nisomers is not too high. When the isomerization occurs intramolecularly it is\nconsidered a rearrangement reaction.\n\nAn example of an organometallic isomerization is the production of\ndecaphenylferrocene, [(η 5-\nC 5Ph 5) 2Fe] from its linkage\nisomer.\n","linknr":145,"url":"Isomerization","recorded":1362504741,"links":20,"instances":["chemistry","unit"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Chemical reactions"],"headings":["Instances of isomerization","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/28/Formation_of_decaphenylferrocene_from_its_linkage_isomer.PNG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/15/N-pentane_isomerization.svg/500px-N-pentane_isomerization.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/74/Rasveratrol_isomerization.png/400px-Rasveratrol_isomerization.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cracking","chemistry"],["mole","unit"]],"members":["cracking","mole"],"related":["Chemistry","Molecule","Isomer","Bond_energy","Intramolecular","Rearrangement_reaction","Organometallic_chemistry","Phenyl","Linkage_isomer","Cracking_(chemistry)","Organic_chemistry","Pentane","N-butane","Isobutane","Geometric_isomerism","Maleic_acid","Azobenzene","Photoisomerization","Resveratrol","Journal_of_Chemical_Education","Aldose-ketose_isomerization","Conformational_isomer","Cyclohexane_conformation","Fluxional_molecule","Bullvalene","Double_bond","Valence_tautomerism","Endothermic","2-butene","Calorie","Mole_(unit)","Isopentane","N-pentane","Trans-2-butene","1-butene","J._Org._Chem."]}
