Since inception in 1986,\nAshland Railway has grown to provide service 24 hours a day 7 days a week along\n55 miles of track, to industries within Ashland, Huron, Richland and Wayne\ncounties. ASRY interchanges with the Norfolk Southern Railroad in Mansfield, The\nWheeling & Lake Erie Railroad in Plymouth, OH and CSX Transportation (CSXT) in\nWillard, OH. The line runs southeast from Willard through Plymouth and Shelby,\nOH to Mansfield. From Mansfield the line runs northeast through Ashland, OH and\nterminates in West Salem, OH\n\nThe Ashland Railway operates on two separate lines that connect in Mansfield,\nOH. The \"original\" Ashland mainline, which began operations in 1986, was\npurchased from Conrail. This line's heritage goes back to the Erie Lackawanna\nRailway and was their Chicago - New York main line. After Conrail took control\nof the Erie Lackawanna, most of its trackage was deemed redundant, and removed\nin vast sections. The portion east of West Salem, OH and the portions west of\nMansfield, OH removed in about 1984. Conrail retained ownership of the EL line\nbetween Mansfield and Ontario, to service a GM plant. As such, the crossing with\nthe Conrail (former Pennsylvania Railroad) Ft. Wayne Line was removed, and spur\ntracks were built to interchange traffic on either side.\n\nThe second portion of the Ashland Railway is the Willard to Mansfield section.\nThis was operated by the Baltimore & Ohio railroad as a line between the docks\non Lake Erie to south-central Ohio, including the city of Mt. Vernon, Ohio.\nBecause of economic downturns in the 1980s, fright traffic reduced drastically\non this line, and it was later reduced to a branch line between Willard and\nMansfield. By 1990, the new CSX Transportation was ready to part with this line,\nand sold it to the Ashland Railway as well. Before the purchase of the CSX line,\nthe Ashland was marooned with only one railroad to interchange with: Conrail in\nMansfield.\n\nThe railway has built a spur line to serve an industrial park in\nAshland.\n\nIn 1924, the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway was considering buying the Ashland\nRailway, a separate company from the current one by that name.\n","linknr":149,"url":"Ashland_Railway","recorded":1375080446,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Ashland_Railway&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Ashland_Railway&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Help:Template","/wiki/Template:Infobox_rail","/wiki/Wikipedia:Templates_for_discussion/Log/2013_July_27#Template:Infobox_rail","/wiki/Reporting_mark","/wiki/Track_gauge","/wiki/Standard_gauge","/wiki/Mansfield,_Ohio","http://www.ashlandrailway.com","/wiki/Reporting_mark","/wiki/Class_III_railroad","/wiki/Shortline_railroad","/wiki/Mansfield,_Ohio","/wiki/Norfolk_Southern_Railroad","/wiki/Wheeling_and_Lake_Erie_Railway_(1990)","/wiki/Plymouth,_OH","/wiki/CSX_Transportation","/wiki/Willard,_OH","/wiki/Shelby,_OH","/wiki/Ashland,_OH","/wiki/West_Salem,_OH","/wiki/Conrail","/wiki/Erie_Lackawanna_Railway","/wiki/Pennsylvania_Railroad","/wiki/Baltimore_%26_Ohio","/wiki/Mt._Vernon,_Ohio","/wiki/CSX_Transportation","/wiki/Spur_line","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Chesapeake_and_Ohio_Railway","#cite_note-2","/w/index.php?title=Ashland_Railway&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","http://www.times-gazette.com/news/article/4473281","#cite_ref-2","http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F40914F8395F17738DDDAB0894DC405B848EF1D3","/w/index.php?title=Ashland_Railway&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/File:Locomotive_J_1211_front.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/95/Locomotive_J_1211_front.jpg/32px-Locomotive_J_1211_front.jpg","/wiki/Portal:Railways","http://www.ashlandrailway.com","/wiki/Template:Ohio_railroads","/wiki/Template_talk:Ohio_railroads","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Ohio_railroads&action=edit","/wiki/Common_carrier","/wiki/List_of_Ohio_railroads","/wiki/Ann_Arbor_Railroad_(1988)","/wiki/Akron_Barberton_Cluster_Railway","/w/index.php?title=Ashtabula,_Carson_and_Jefferson_Railroad&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Bessemer_and_Lake_Erie_Railroad","/wiki/Camp_Chase_Industrial_Railroad","/w/index.php?title=Cleveland_Commercial_Railroad&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Chicago,_Fort_Wayne_and_Eastern_Railroad","/wiki/Central_Railroad_of_Indiana","/wiki/Canadian_National_Railway","/wiki/CSX_Transportation","/wiki/Columbus_and_Ohio_River_Railroad","/w/index.php?title=Cleveland_Works_Railway&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Flats_Industrial_Railroad","/wiki/Indiana_Eastern_Railroad","/wiki/Indiana_Northeastern_Railroad","/wiki/Indiana_and_Ohio_Railway","/w/index.php?title=Lake_Terminal_Railroad&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Maumee_and_Western_Railroad","/wiki/Mahoning_Valley_Railway","/wiki/Northern_Ohio_and_Western_Railway","/wiki/Norfolk_Southern_Railway","/wiki/Newburgh_and_South_Shore_Railroad","/wiki/Republic_N%26T_Railroad","/wiki/Ohio_Central_Railroad_(1988)","/wiki/Ohi-Rail_Corporation","/wiki/Ohio_Southern_Railroad_(1986)","/w/index.php?title=R.J._Corman_Railroad/Cleveland_Line&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=R.J._Corman_Railroad/Western_Ohio_Lines&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/U_S_Rail_Corporation","/wiki/Wheeling_and_Lake_Erie_Railway_(1990)","/wiki/Warren_and_Trumbull_Railroad","/wiki/Youngstown_and_Austintown_Railroad","/wiki/Youngstown_Belt_Railroad","/wiki/Youngstown_and_Southeastern_Railroad","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ashland_Railway&oldid=560490247","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Ohio_railroads","/wiki/Category:Railway_companies_established_in_1986","/wiki/Category:1986_establishments_in_Ohio","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Ashland+Railway&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Ashland+Railway","/wiki/Ashland_Railway","/wiki/Talk:Ashland_Railway","#","/wiki/Ashland_Railway","/w/index.php?title=Ashland_Railway&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Ashland_Railway&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=e
