{"cursor":"5270","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The Church of Scotland has a Presbyterian structure, which means it is organised\nunder a hierarchy of courts. Traditionally there were four levels of courts: the\nKirk Session (at congregational level), the Presbytery (at local area level),\nthe Synod (at a regional level) and the General Assembly (the Church's highest\ncourt). However, the synods were abolished in the early 1990s.\n\nScottish local government was reorganised in 1975, creating a new system of\nregions and districts to replace the long-standing counties and burghs. The\nGeneral Assembly of the Church of Scotland also ordered a major reorganisation\nof presbyteries in the mid-1970s, redrawing presbytery boundaries to make them\nbroadly contiguous with the then-new local government boundaries. An example was\nthe union of the former Presbyteries of Cupar and St Andrews, creating a new\nPresbytery of St Andrews (which also included the Parishes of Newport-on-Tay,\nWormit and Tayport, previously in the Presbytery of Dundee). This new\nPresbytery's boundaries mirrored the North East Fife District Council.\n\nFollowing further local government reorganisation in the 1990s (replacing\nregions and districts with a single-tier system of councils), it was proposed to\nfurther considerably reduce the number of Presbyteries (possibly to as few as\nseven). This proposal was rejected by the General Assembly. Since 2003 several\npresbyteries have voluntarily sought permission to merge, as described below.\nDespite these mergers the existing Presbytery numbering system is being\nretained, albeit now with some gaps.\n\nIt is the presbyteries which have oversight of parishes and pastoral\nresponsibility for parish ministers, and the Kirk Sessions of the individual\nparishes are subordinated to them. A parish minister is answerable to the\nPresbytery, not to the Kirk Session. The following is a list of presbyteries,\narranged according to historical synod, and with the presbytery code number from\nthe Church of Scotland Yearbook.\n","linknr":138,"url":"List_of_Church_of_Scotland_synods_and_presbyteries","recorded":1375066479,"links":["/w/index.php?title=List_of_Church_of_Scotland_synods_and_presbyteries&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=List_of_Church_of_Scotland_synods_and_presbyteries&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Church_of_Scotland","/wiki/Presbyterian_polity","/wiki/Kirk_Session","/wiki/Presbyterian_polity#The_presbytery","/wiki/Synod","/wiki/General_Assembly_of_the_Church_of_Scotland","#Synods","#Synod_of_Lothian","#Synod_of_The_Borders","#Synod_of_Dumfries_and_Galloway","#Synod_of_Ayr","#Synod_of_Clydesdale","#Synod_of_Argyll","#Synod_of_Forth","#Synod_of_Fife","#Synod_of_Perth_and_Angus","#Synod_of_Grampian","#Synod_of_The_Southern_Highlands","#Synod_of_Ross.2C_Sutherland_and_Caithness","#Presbyteries_not_formally_part_of_any_Synod","#See_also","/w/index.php?title=List_of_Church_of_Scotland_synods_and_presbyteries&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=List_of_Church_of_Scotland_synods_and_presbyteries&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Presbytery_of_Edinburgh","http://www.edinburghpresbytery.org.uk","/w/index.php?title=List_of_Church_of_Scotland_synods_and_presbyteries&action=edit&section=3","/w/index.php?title=List_of_Church_of_Scotland_synods_and_presbyteries&action=edit&section=4","http://www.presbyteryofannandaleandeskdale.com","http://www.presbyteryofdumfriesandkirkcudbright.org.uk","/w/index.php?title=List_of_Church_of_Scotland_synods_and_presbyteries&action=edit&section=5","http://www.presbyteryofayr.org.uk/","http://www.irvinekilmarnockpresbytery.org.uk","http://www.ardrossanpresbytery.org.uk","/w/index.php?title=List_of_Church_of_Scotland_synods_and_presbyteries&action=edit&section=6","http://www.presbofgreenockandpaisley.org","/wiki/Presbytery_of_Glasgow","http://www.presbyteryofglasgow.org.uk","http://www.presbyteryofhamilton.co.uk","http://www.presbyteryofdumbarton.org.uk","/w/index.php?title=List_of_Church_of_Scotland_synods_and_presbyteries&action=edit&section=7","http://www.argyllchurchofscotland.co.uk","/w/index.php?title=List_of_Church_of_Scotland_synods_and_presbyteries&action=edit&section=8","http://www.falkirkpresbytery.org","/w/index.php?title=List_of_Church_of_Scotland_synods_and_presbyteries&action=edit&section=9","http://www.dunfermline.presbytery.org.uk","http://www.standrewspresbytery.org.UK","/w/index.php?title=List_of_Church_of_Scotland_synods_and_presbyteries&action=edit&section=10","http://www.perthpresbytery.org.uk","http://www.dundeepresbytery.org.uk","http://www.anguspresbytery.org.uk","/w/index.php?title=List_of_Church_of_Scotland_synods_and_presbyteries&action=edit&section=11","/wiki/Presbytery_of_Aberdeen","http://www.aberdeenpresbytery.org.uk","http://www.presbyteryofgordon.org.uk/","http://www.presbyteryofbuchan.org.uk","http://www.moraypresbytery.org.uk","/w/index.php?title=List_of_Church_of_Scotland_synods_and_presbyteries&action=edit&section=12","/wiki/Presbytery_of_Abernethy","http://www.invernesspresbytery.co.uk","http://www.cofslochaber.co.uk","/w/index.php?title=List_of_Church_of_Scotland_synods_and_presbyteries&action=edit&section=13","/w/index.php?title=List_of_Church_of_Scotland_synods_and_presbyteries&action=edit&section=14","http://www.orkneycommunities.co.uk/PRESBYTERY","http://www.presbyteryofengland.org.uk","/wiki/Presbytery_of_Europe","http://www.europepresbytery.net","/w/index.php?title=List_of_Church_of_Scotland_synods_and_presbyteries&action=edit&section=15","/wiki/List_of_Church_of_Scotland_parishes","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Church_of_Scotland_synods_and_presbyteries&oldid=536116337","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Church_of_Scotland","/wiki/Category:Presbyteries_of_the_Church_of_Scotland","/wiki/Category:Ecclesiastical_provinces","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=List+of+Church+of+Scotland+synods+and+presbyteries&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=List+of+Church+of+Scotland+synods+and+presbyteries","/wiki/List_of_Church_of_Scotland_synods_and_presbyteries","/wiki/Talk:List_of_Church_of_Scotland_synods_and_presbyteries"
