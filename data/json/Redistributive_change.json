{"cursor":"4747","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Redistributive change' is a legal theory of economic justice in the context of\nU.S. law that promotes the recognition of poverty as a classification, like\nrace, ethnicity, gender, and religion, that should likewise draw extra scrutiny\nfrom the courts in matters pertaining to civil rights. {{cite\nweb |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2203237/ |title=He's Not Robin Hood: What Obama\nreally meant by \"redistributive change.\" |first=Emily |last=Bazelon\n|publisher=Slate |date=2008-10-28}}\n\nThe theory was discussed in academia in the wake of [[Goldberg v. Kelly]], a\n1970 U.S. Supreme Court case, which decided that due process, such as a notice\nand a fair hearing, were required when dealing with the deprivation of a\ngovernment benefit (such as a medical license) or an entitlement (such as\nwelfare payments). However, attempts to promote\nredistributive change through the courts gained no traction, and the result of\nGoldberg v. Kelly was thus limited in scope.\n\nOne of the goals, in light of [[Brown v. Board of Education]], was to promote\nequality in school funding, but this was specifically rejected by the Supreme\nCourt in [[San Antonio School District v. Rodriguez]] (1973) which ruled there\nwas no inherent right to education in the United States. {{cite web\n|url=http://www.wbez.org/audio_library/od_rajan01.asp#010118 |title=The Court\nand Civil Rights |first=Gretchen |last=Helfrich |coauthors=Susan Bandes, Dennis\nHutchinson, and Barack Obama |publisher=Chicago Public Radio |date=2001-01-18\n|quote=A classic example would be something like public education, where after\nBrown v. Board, a major issue ends up being redistribution -- how do we get more\nmoney into the schools, and how do we actually create equal schools and equal\neducational opportunity? Well, the court in a case called San Antonio v.\nRodriguez in the early '70s basically slaps those kinds of claims down, and\nsays, 'You know what, we as a court have no power to examine issues of\nredistribution and wealth inequalities. With respect to schools, that's not a\nrace issue, that's a wealth issue and something we can't get into.'}}\n\nA discussion among two law professors and Illinois State Senator and law\nlecturer Barack Obama on the topic of civil rights aired on Chicago Public\nRadio's Odyssey program in 2001. {{cite web\n|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/29/us/politics/29campaign.html?em\n|title=Candidates Battle for Pennsylvania |first=Michael |last=Cooper\n|coauthors=Jack Healy |publisher=The New York Times |date=2008-10-28}}\nObama declared in the discussion that redistributive change needs to come\nthrough legislation, not the courts, and lamented that the\ncivil rights movement failed to pursue political means to bring such a change\nabout. {{cite web
