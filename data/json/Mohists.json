It evolved at about the same time as Confucianism, Taoism and\nLegalism, and was one of the four main philosophic schools during the Spring and\nAutumn Period (from 770 BC to 480 BC) 697 and the Warring States\nPeriod (from 479 BC to 221 BC). During that time, Mohism (å¢¨ Mo) was seen as a\nmajor rival to Confucianism (å Ru). The Qin dynasty, which united China in 221\nBC, adopted Legalism as the official government philosophy and suppressed all\nother philosophic schools. The Han dynasty that followed adopted Confucianism as\nthe official state philosophy, as did most other successive dynasties, though\nTaoism and later Buddhism also played an important part in later Chinese life\nand thought, while Mohism all but disappeared as a separate school of thought.\nMohist books were later merged into Taoist canon.\n","recorded":1362124531,"portal":[],"list":[],"links":"566","instances":["philosophy","confucianism","philosophy","manga","polity","concept","philosophy","literature","warring_states_period","concept","chinese_religion","concept","philosophy","concept","philosopher","concept","philosophy","philosophy","chinese_philosophy","philosophy_of_mind","concept","chinese","2006_film","metaphysics","philosophy","philosopher","confucianism"],"pdf":["http://kirkland.myweb.uga.edu/rk/pdf/guides/MOTZU.pdf"],"categories":["Classical Chinese philosophy","Chinese thought","Consequentialism","Social theories","Mohism|*","Utilitarianism"],"headings":["Beliefs","The Logicians","Mathematics","Siege engineers","Decline","Modern perspectives","See also","Further reading","Notes","References","External links"],"tags":[["latinization","literature"],["legalism","philosophy"],["legalism","philosophy"],["state","polity"],["bokko","manga"],["latinization","literature"],["legalism","philosophy"],["legalism","philosophy"],["http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=mozi","book&action=edit&redlink=1"],["state","polity"],["bokko","manga"],["a_battle_of_wits","2006_film"],["action_theory","philosophy"],["pain","philosophy"],["legalism","chinese_philosophy"],["cynicism","philosophy"],["judeo-islamic_philosophies","800%e2%80%931400"],["functionalism","philosophy_of_mind"],["phenomenology","philosophy"],["libertarianism","metaphysics"],["naturalism","philosophy"],["norm","philosophy"],["action_theory","philosophy"],["event","philosophy"],["legalism","chinese_philosophy"],["xu_xing","philosopher"],["zhang_yi","warring_states_period"],["de","chinese"],["fa","concept"],["jing","concept"],["li","confucian"],["li","neo-confucianism"],["qing","concept"],["ren","confucianism"],["shen","chinese_religion"],["si","concept"],["ti","concept"],["xin","concept"],["yi","confucianism"],["bernard_bosanquet","philosopher"],["legalism","chinese_philosophy"]],"image":["http://en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9e/Zhongwen.svg/40px-Zhongwen.svg.png","http://bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","http://bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"related":["Chinese_philosophy","Mozi","Latinization_(literature)","Confucianism","Taoism","Legalism_(philosophy)","Hundred_Schools_of_Thought","Spring_and_Autumn_Period","Warring_States_Period","Qin_dynasty","China","Legalism_(philosophy)","Burning_of_books_and_burying_of_scholars","Han_dynasty","Taoist_canon","Student","Nepotism","Social_mobility","Carpenter","Love","Confucian","Utilitarianism","Ethic","Maslow's_hierarchy_of_needs","Stanford_University","Sinologist","David_S._Nivison","State_(polity)","War","Pacifism","Fortification","Righteousness","Han_Fei","Funeral","Fatalism","Art","Music","Fine_arts","Logicians","Logic","Joseph_Needham","Philosophy_of_science","Mathematics","Euclid","Plato","Atomist","Democritus","Artisans","En_cadre","Chinese_University_of_Hong_Kong","Chinese_Academy_of_Sciences","Bokko_(manga)","A_Step_into_the_Past","Agape","Ascetism","Logic_in_China","Taoism","Utilitarianism","Consequentialism","Wing-tsit_Chan","Bertolt_Brecht","Chinese_Text_Project","Wikisource"],"members":["pain","yi","cynicism","bokko","state","ti","norm","latinization","zhang_yi","xin","shen","si","action_theory","jing","xu_xing","fa","naturalism","event","legalism","functionalism","qing","de","a_battle_of_wits","li","libertarianism","phenomenology","bernard_bosanquet","ren"],"book":[]}
