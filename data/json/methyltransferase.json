Methytransferases use a reactive methyl group bound to sulfur in S-\nadenosyl methionine (SAM) as the methyl donor.\n","linknr":245,"url":"methyltransferase","recorded":1362897799,"links":23,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["EC 2.1.1"],"headings":["Function","Clinical significance","Examples","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5f/HaeIII-methyltransferase-dna-pdb-1DCT.png/220px-HaeIII-methyltransferase-dna-pdb-1DCT.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6b/Methyl.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/78/Methylation_sites2.jpg/220px-Methylation_sites2.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d9/PBB_GE_PNPLA6_203718_at_tn.png/60px-PBB_GE_PNPLA6_203718_at_tn.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Transferase","Enzyme","Methyl","S-adenosyl_methionine","DNA_methylation","Epigenetic","DNA_methylation","Tumor_suppressor_gene","Tumorigenesis","Metastasis","Restriction_modification_system","Amino_acids","Linezolid","Plasmid","DNA_methyltransferase","Histone_methyltransferase","5-Methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine_methyltransferase","O-methyltransferase"]}
