Their name literally translates as\n\"raving ones\". Often the maenads were portrayed as inspired by Dionysus into a\nstate of ecstatic frenzy, through a combination of dancing and drunken\nintoxication.<ref name=\"wiles\"></ref> In this state, they would lose all self-\ncontrol, begin shouting excitedly, engage in uncontrolled sexual behavior, and\nritualistically hunt down and tear to pieces animals—and, at least in myth,\nsometimes men and children—devouring the raw flesh. During these rites, the\nmaenads would dress in fawn skins and carry a thyrsus, a long stick wrapped in\nivy or vine leaves and tipped with a pinecone; they would weave ivy-wreaths\naround their heads or wear a bull helmet in honor of their god, and often handle\nor wear snakes.<ref>Ernest L. Abel, Intoxication in Mythology: A Worldwide\nDictionary of Gods, Rites, Intoxicants, and Place McFarland; Jefferson, NC and\nLondon 2006.</ref> German philologist Walter Friedrich Otto writes that\n\n\n\nThe maddened Hellenic women of real life were mythologized as the mad women who\nwere nurses of Dionysus in Nysa: Lycurgus \"chased the Nurses of the frenzied\nDionysus through the holy hills of Nysa, and the sacred implements dropped to\nthe ground from the hands of one and all, as the murderous Lycurgus struck them\ndown with his ox-goad.\"<ref>Homer, [[Iliad]], VI.130ff, in E.V. Rieu's\ntranslation.</ref> They went into the mountains at night and practised strange\nrites.<ref name=\"lever\"></ref>\n\nIn Macedon, according to Plutarch's Life of Alexander, they were called\nMimallones and Klodones, epithets derived from the feminine art of spinning\nwool;<ref>According to Grace Harriet Macurdy, \"Klodones, Mimallones and Dionysus\nPseudanor\", The Classical Review '27'.6 (September 1913), pp. 191-192, and Troy\nand Paeonia. With Glimpses of Ancient Balkan History and Religion, 1925, p.\n166.</ref> nevertheless, these warlike parthenoi (\"virgins\") from the hills,\nassociated with a shamanic Dionysios pseudanor, routed an invading\nenemy.<ref>According to the second-century CE Macedonian military writer\nPolyaenus, IV.1; Polyaenus gives a fanciful etymology..</ref> In southern Greece\nthey were described as Bacchae, Bassarides, [[Thyia]]des, Potniades<ref>Potnia,\nthe \"power\" of maddened intoxication.</ref> and given other\nepithets.<ref>Harrison, \"The Maenads\", Prolegomena to the Study of Greek\nReligion, 3rd ed. (1922:388-400) p. 388.</ref>\n\nThe maenads were also known as 'Bassarids' (or 'Bacchae' or 'Bacchantes') in\nRoman mythology, after the penchant of the equivalent Roman god, Bacchus, to\nwear a fox-skin, a bassaris.\n\nIn Euripides' play [[The Bacchae]], Theban maenads murdered King Pentheus after\nhe banned the worship of Dionysus. Dionysus, Pentheus' cousin, himself lured\nPentheus to the woods, where the maenads tore him apart. His corpse was\nmutilated by his own mother, Agave, who tore off his head, believing it to be\nthat of a lion.\n\nA group of maenads also killed Orpheus.<ref>Apollodorus (Pseudo Apollodorus),\n[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Apollod.+1.3.2 Library and\nEpitome, 1.3.2]. \"Orpheus also invented the mysteries of Dionysus, and having\nbeen torn in pieces by the maenads he is buried in Pieria.\"</ref>\n\nIn Greek vase painting, the frolicking of maenads and Dionysus is often a theme\ndepicted on Greek kraters, used to mix water and wine. These scenes show the\nmaenads in their frenzy running in the forests, often tearing to pieces any\nanimal they happen to come across.\n",
