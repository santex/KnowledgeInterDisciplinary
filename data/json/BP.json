It also has renewable energy activities in biofuels and\nwind power.\n\nBP has operations in over 80 countries, produces around 3.4 million barrels\nof oil equivalent per day and has around 21,800 service stations worldwide. Its largest division\nis BP America, which is the second-largest producer of oil and gas in the United\nStates. , BP had total proven commercial reserves of\n17.75 billion barrels of oil equivalent.

It had a market capitalisation of Â£81.4 billion as of 6\nJuly 2012, the fourth-largest of any company listed on the London Stock\nExchange. It has a secondary listing on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nBP's origins date back to the founding of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in 1909,\nestablished as a subsidiary of Burmah Oil Company to exploit oil discoveries in\nIran. In 1935, it became the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and in 1954 'British\nPetroleum'. In 1959, the company expanded beyond the\nMiddle East to Alaska and in 1965 it was the first company to strike oil in the\nNorth Sea. British Petroleum acquired majority control of Standard Oil of Ohio\nin 1978. Formerly majority state-owned, the British government privatised the\ncompany in stages between 1979 and 1987. British Petroleum merged with Amoco in\n1998 and acquired ARCO and Burmah Castrol in 2000.\n\nBP has been involved in several major environmental and safety incidents,\nincluding the 2005 Texas City Refinery explosion which caused the death of 15\nworkers and resulted in a record-setting OSHA fine and the 2010 Deepwater\nHorizon oil spill, the worldâs largest accidental release of oil into marine\nwaters. In November 2012, the U.S. Attorney\nGeneral announced that BP and three of its employees were indicted on criminal\ncharges including manslaughter and obstruction of Congress. In addition BP\nagreed to pay a $4 billion fine, the largest criminal resolution in the history\nof the United States.\n","linknr":3061,"url":"BP","recorded":1362512318,"links":153,"instances":["businessman","fuel","united_states","magazine","united_states","finance","mandate_administration","petroleum_industry","united_kingdom","well_drilling","oil_platform","lubricant","petroleum_industry","united_states"],"pdf":["http://www.bp.com/assets/bp_internet/globalbp/STAGING/global_assets/downloads/B/bp_fourth_quarter_2012_results.pdf","http://www.bp.com/assets/bp_internet/globalbp/STAGING/global_assets/downloads/B/bp_fourth_quarter_2012_results.pdf","http://www.bp.com/liveassets/bp_internet/globalbp/STAGING/global_assets/downloads/I/BP_20-F_2009.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20100704100147/http://www.bp.com/liveassets/bp_internet/globalbp/STAGING/global_assets/downloads/I/BP_20-F_2009.pdf","http://www.bp.com/liveassets/bp_internet/globalbp/STAGING/global_assets/downloads/I/BP_20-F_2009.pdf","http://www.bp.com/liveassets/bp_internet/globalbp/STAGING/global_assets/downloads/F/FOI_2007_2011_full_book.pdf","http://www.bp.com/liveassets/bp_internet/globalbp/STAGING/global_assets/downloads/F/FOI_2007_2011_full_book.pdf","http://www.bp.com/assets/bp_internet/globalbp/globalbp_uk_english/set_branch/STAGING/common_assets/bpin2011/downloads/BP_Annual_Report_and_Form_20F_2011.pdf","http://www.bp.com/assets/bp_internet/globalbp/globalbp_uk_english/set_branch/STAGING/common_assets/bpin2011/downloads/BP_Annual_Report_and_Form_20F_2011.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web-cdx/20120313160949/http://www.investfairbanks.com/Projects/PDFs/Vol.1_The_Facts.pdf","http://www.investfairbanks.com/Projects/PDFs/Vol.1_The_Facts.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web-cdx/20120313160949/http://www.investfairbanks.com/Projects/PDFs/Vol.1_The_Facts.pdf","http://www.bp.com/assets/bp_internet/globalbp/globalbp_uk_english/set_branch/STAGING/common_assets/bpin2011/downloads/BP_Annual_Report_and_Form_20F_2011.pdf","http://www.bp.com/assets/bp_internet/globalbp/globalbp_uk_english/set_branch/STAGING/common_assets/bpin2011/downloads/BP_Annual_Report_and_Form_20F_2011.pdf","http://www.devonenergy.com/SiteCollectionDocuments/DVN-2010CorpFactSheet.pdf","http://www.devonenergy.com/SiteCollectionDocuments/DVN-2010CorpFactSheet.pdf","http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/Global/usa/report/2010/1/carbon-scam-noel-kempff-clima.pdf","http://www.dec.state.ak.us/SPAR/PERP/response/sum_fy06/060302301/sitreps/060302301_sr_23.pdf","http://www.dec.state.ak.us/SPAR/PERP/response/sum_fy06/060302301/sitreps/060302301_sr_23.pdf","http://dec.alaska.gov/spar/perp/response/sum_fy07/060806301/060806301_sr_05.pdf","http://dec.alaska.gov/spar/perp/response/sum_fy07/060806301/060806301_sr_05.pdf","http://www.bp.com/liveassets/bp_internet/globalbp/STAGING/global_assets/downloads/A/abp_wwd_alaska_prudhoe_bay_fact_sheet.pdf","http://www.bp.com/liveassets/bp_internet/globalbp/STAGING/global_assets/downloads/A/abp_wwd_alaska_prudhoe_bay_fact_sheet.pdf","http://www.bp.com/liveassets/bp_internet/globalbp/STAGING/global_assets/downloads/B/BP_and_Oil_Sands_FAQs.pdf","http://www.bp.com/liveassets/bp_internet/globalbp/STAGING/global_assets/downloads/B/BP_and_Oil_Sands_FAQs.pdf","http://www.csb.gov/assets/document/CSBFinalReportBP.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20100528174726/http://www.csb.gov/assets/document/CSBFinalReportBP.pdf","http://www.csb.gov/assets/document/CSBFinalReportBP.pdf","http://www.cftc.gov/ucm/groups/public/@lrenforcementactions/documents/legalpleading/enfbpproductscomplaint.pdf","http://www.cftc.gov/ucm/groups/public/@lrenforcementactions/documents/legalpleading/enfbpproductscomplaint.pdf"],"categories":["Automotive
