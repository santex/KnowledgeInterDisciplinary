What these rights and\nduties are vary from country to country. Weis, Paul.\n[http://books.google.com/books?id=hSLGDXqXeegC&pg=PA29 Nationality and\nStatelessness in International Law].

It differs technically and legally from\ncitizenship, although in most modern countries all nationals are citizens of the\nstate and all citizens are nationals of the state.\n\nNationality affords the state jurisdiction over the Person and affords the\nperson the protection of the state. The most common distinguishing feature of\ncitizenship is that citizens have the right to participate in the political life\nof the state, such as by voting or standing for election. The term national can\ninclude both citizens and non-citizens. By custom, it is the right of each state\nto determine who its nationals are. Such determinations are part of nationality\nlaw. In some cases, determinations of nationality are also governed by public\ninternational lawâfor example, by treaties on statelessness and the European\nConvention on Nationality.\n\nIn English, the same word is used in the sense of an ethnic group (a group of\npeople who share a common ethnic identity, language, culture, descent, history,\nand so forth). This meaning of nationality is not defined by political borders\nor passport ownership and includes nations that lack an independent state (such\nas the Scots, Welsh, English, Basques, Kurds, Tamils, Hmong, Inuit and MÄori).\n\nIndividuals may also be considered nationals of groups with autonomous status\nwhich have ceded some power to a larger government, such as the federally\nrecognized tribes of Native Americans in the United States. Spanish law\nrecognises the autonomous communities of Andalusia, Aragon, Balearic Islands,\nCanary Islands, Catalonia, Valencia, Galicia and the Basque Country as\n\"nationalities\" (nacionalidades).\n\nArticle 15 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that \"Everyone\nhas the right to a nationality,\" and \"No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of\nhis nationality nor denied the right to change his nationality.\"\n","linknr":526,"url":"Nationality","recorded":1362477190,"links":52,"instances":["spain","autonomous_community"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Nationality|","Nationality law|","Conflict of laws","Human migration","Legal categories of people","Nationalism"],"headings":["Nationality versus ethnicity","Nationality versus citizenship","Nationality versus national identity","Dual nationality","Statelessness","International law","See also","References","Further reading"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["galicia","spain"],["basque_country","autonomous_community"],["nottebohm","liechtenstein_v._guatemala"]],"members":["nottebohm","galicia","basque_country"],"related":["Nation_state","Citizenship","Politics","Voting","Candidate","Customary_international_law","Nationality_law","Public_international_law","Treaty","Statelessness","European_Convention_on_Nationality","Ethnic_group","Sovereign_state","Scottish_people","Welsh_people","English_people","Basque_people","Kurdish_people","Tamil_people","Hmong_people","Inuit","Māori_people","Autonomous_area","Devolved_government","Federally_recognized_tribes","Native_Americans_in_the_United_States","Andalusia","Aragon","Balearic_Islands","Canary_Islands","Catalonia","Valencian_Community","Galicia_(Spain)","Basque_Country_(autonomous_community)","Nationalities_and_regions_of_Spain","Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights","Cognate","Ethnicity","Jus_sanguinis","Jus_soli","Kurds","Sovereign_state","Soviet_Union","SFRY","Russian_language","Serbo-Croatian","Ethnic_group","Russian_Federation","Nationalities_of_China","Nationalities_in_Spain","Necessary_and_sufficient_condition","Polity","United_States_nationality_law","British_nationality_law","Right_of_abode","Republic_of_China","Taiwan","National_without_household_registration","Republic_of_China_nationality_law","Taiwan_Area","National_identity","Dual_nationality","Statelessness","Nottebohm_(Liechtenstein_v._Guatemala)","Blood_quantum_laws","Demonym","Imagined_communities","Intersectionality","List_of_adjectival_and_demonymic_forms_of_place_names","Meta-ethnicity","Nationalism","Second-class_citizen"]}
