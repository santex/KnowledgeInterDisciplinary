{"cursor":"1885","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nA 'calendar effect' is any market anomaly or economic effect which appears to be\nrelated to the calendar. Such effects include the apparently different behaviour\nof stock markets on different days of the week, different times of the month,\nand different times of year ('seasonal tendencies'). The term sometimes includes\nmulti-year effects, such as the 10-year (decadal) cycle, or the 4-year U.S.\npresidential election cycle. It also sometimes includes time of day effects.\n\nExamples include:\n* Halloween indicator (or the 'Sell in May' principle)\n* January effect\n* January barometer\n* Mark Twain effect\n* Monday effect\n* Weekend effect\n* Turn-of-the-Month effect\n\nIn their 2001 paper Dangers of data mining: The case of calendar effects in\nstock returns (Journal of Econometrics), Sullivan et al. argue that there is no\nstatistically significant evidence for calendar effects in the stock market, and\nthat all such patterns are the result of data dredging.\n\nMarket prices are often subject to seasonal tendencies because the availability\nand demand for an item is not constant throughout the year. For example,\nnatural gas prices often rise in the winter because that commodity is in demand\nas a heating fuel. In the summer, when the demand for heat is lower, prices\ntypically fall.\n\nSeasonal patterns are not confined to prices; many other systems can exhibit the\nsame kind of calendar effect. However, the term is most often used in an\neconomic context.\n","linknr":257,"url":"Seasonal_tendencies","recorded":1362675118,"links":17,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Market trends","Behavioral finance","Calendar effect"],"headings":["See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Market_anomaly","Halloween_indicator","January_effect","January_barometer","Mark_Twain_effect","Monday_effect","Weekend_effect","Turn-of-the-Month_effect","Stock_market","Data_dredging","Market_price","Natural_gas","Commodity","Market_timing","July_effect","Halloween_indicator","Seasonal_adjustment","The_Congressional_Effect"]}
