Being an only child, HuszÃ¡rik had an\nadoring relationship with his widowed mother. His background had a great\ninfluence on his work.\n\nHe was accepted to the Hungarian School of Film- and Theatrical Arts, but was\nexpelled in 1952 because his family was blamed to be Kulaks. He took on\ndifferent jobs, when—after a seven-year hiatus—he was again accepted\nto the film school in 1959. In the same year he made his first student film, a\nshort entitled JÃ¡tÃ©k (Game) about two prisoners playing chess with the shadow of\ntheir bars when the sun shines unto their cell. HuszÃ¡rik's graduation film was\nanother short entitled Groteszk (Grotesque) in 1963 about a strange train voyage\nof an artist carrying his own picture.\n\nHuszÃ¡rik made his first professional short film in 1965 at BÃ©la BalÃ¡zs Studios\nentitled ElÃ©gia (Elegy). This 20-minute experimental short film was generally\nacclaimed as being the starting point of a new visual style in Hungarian\nfilmmaking. Often called a \"film poem\" or a \"film symphonie\" HuszÃ¡rik's\nmasterpiece consists of montages of horses from the dawn of time to the modern\ntimes from cave paintings to horse races, mourning the loss of these creatures\nand their service to mankind, starting as free animals and becoming\nslaughterhouse victims. The film is generally regarded as an allegory to the\nhuman fate.\n\nHuszÃ¡rik made another experimental short film called Capriccio (about snowmen\nmelting in the spring as an allegory to man's ultimate fate - death) and a short\ndocumentary on Hungarian-born artist [[Amerigo Tot]], both in 1969. He also\ndirected several state-financed educational short films in this period.\n\nIn 1971 HuszÃ¡rik finished his first feature-length work [[SzindbÃ¡d]] (Sinbad), a\nhighly stylized adaptation of early 20th century author Gyula KrÃºdy's short\nstories. The film depicts the life and memories of traveler and womanizer\nSzindbÃ¡d (played by ZoltÃ¡n Latinovits), who tries to recover his lost love\nbefore he dies. The film which covers time and memory in an unusual way, was\npraised by critics and was a commercial success upon its release and is\ngenerally regarded now as one of the best works of Hungarian cinema.\n\nHuszÃ¡rik made two experimental shorts in 1971 and 1976, entitled Tisztelet az\nÃ¶regasszonyoknak (Homage to Old Ladies) and A Piacere (As You Like It),\nrespectively. The first is a homage to the old country widows whose husbands\ndied in World War II and live their lives according to daily tasks and\nregulations until they die (which is mainly inspired by HuszÃ¡rik's own mother).\nThe second is a study of death in its various forms, including a gypsy \"merry\nfuneral\" and stock footage of bombings and concentration camps in WWII.\n\nThe second (and last) feature-length film of HuszÃ¡rik was made after a five-year\nstruggle. CsontvÃ¡ry depicts the life of Hungarian artist Tivadar CsontvÃ¡ry\nKosztka and an actor playing him in a film (both played by Bulgarian actor Ichak\nFinci), with the two men' lives interacting with each other. After the death of\nLatinovits, who was the original choice for the dual role, the film went on\nthrough several re-writes, re-shoots, casting and budget problems, finally\nending up as the most expensive Hungarian production at the time. The film was\nfinally completed and released in 1980. It was a huge failure with the public\nand critics also bashed it. HuszÃ¡rik who was greatly exhausted, depressed and an\nalcoholic at the time committed suicide in 1981 at the age of 50.\n\nHuszÃ¡rik originally wanted to be a visual artist. He made several paintings,\ndrawings and other pieces of art during his lifetime. He also took smaller\nacting jobs in the films of fellow Hungarian directors, including IstvÃ¡n SzabÃ³'s\n[[Budapesti mesÃ©k]] (Budapest Tales). His daughter, Kata HuszÃ¡rik is an\nacclaimed actress.\n","linknr":153,"url":"Zoltán_Huszárik","recorded":1375072516,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Zolt%C3%A1n_Husz%C3%A1rik&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Zolt%C3%A1n_Husz%C3%A1rik&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Domony","/wiki/Hungary","/wiki/Budapest","/wiki/Hungary","/wiki/1959_in_film","/wiki/1980_in_film","/w/index.php?title=Kata_Husz%C3%A1rik&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Hungary","#cite_note-.C3.89lete-1","/wiki/Domony","#cite_note-.C3.89lete-1","/wiki/Kulak","/w/index.php?title=B%C3%A9la_Bal%C3%A1zs_Studios&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Experimental_film","/wiki/Amerigo_Tot","/wiki/Szindb%C3%A1d","/wiki/Gyula_Kr%C3%BAdy","/wiki/Zolt%C3%A1n_Latinovits","/wiki/Romani_people","/wiki/Tivadar_Csontv%C3%A1ry_Kosztka","/w/index.php?title=Ichak_Finci&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Istv%C3%A1n_Szab%C3%B3","/wiki/Budapesti_mes%C3%A9k","/w/index.php?title=Kata_Husz%C3%A1rik&action=edit&redlink=1","#Filmography","#Source_material","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Zolt%C3%A1n_Husz%C3%A1rik&action=edit&section=1","#cite_note-Huszarik-2","#cite_note-Huszarik-2","#cite_note-Huszarik-2","#cite_note-Huszarik-2","#cite_note-Huszarik-2","/wiki/Amerigo_Tot","#cite_note-Huszarik-2","#cite_note-Huszarik-2","/wiki/Szindb%C3%A1d","#cite_note-Huszarik-2","#cite_note-Huszarik-2","#cite_note-Huszarik-2","#cite_note-Huszarik-2","/w/index.php?title=Zolt%C3%A1n_Husz%C3%A1rik&action=edit&section=2","http://www.filmvilag.hu/xista_frame.php?cikk_id=7198","http://www.mtv.hu/modernkepmesek/cikk.php?id=115364","/w/index.php?title=Zolt%C3%A1n_Husz%C3%A1rik&action=edit&section=3","#cite_ref-.C3.89lete_1-0","#cite_ref-.C3.89lete_1-1","http://www.mek.iif.hu/porta/szint/egyeb/lexikon/eletrajz/html/ABC05727/06679.htm","#cite_ref-Huszarik_2-0","#cite_ref-Huszarik_2-1","#cite_ref-Huszarik_2-2","#cite_ref-Huszarik_2-3","#cite_ref-Huszarik_2-4","#cite_ref-Huszarik_2-5","#cite_ref-Huszarik_2-6","#cite_ref-Huszarik_2-7","#cite_ref-Huszarik_2-8","#cite_ref-Huszarik_2-9","#cite_ref-Huszarik_2-10","http://www.port.hu/pls/pe/person.person?i_pers_id=619&i_direction=2&i_city_id=3372&i_county_id=-1","/w/index.php?title=Zolt%C3%A1n_Husz%C3%A1rik&action=edit&section=4","http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0404177/","/wiki/Internet_Movie_Database","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/76578489","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","/wiki/Domony","/wiki/Hungary","/wiki/Budapest","/wiki/Hungary","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Zoltán_Huszárik&oldid=565731627","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Hungarian_film_directors","/wiki/Category:1931_births","/wiki/Category:1981_deaths","/wiki/Category:Suicides_in_Hungary","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_hCards","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Zolt%C3%A1n+Husz%C3%A1rik&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Zolt%C3%A1n+Husz%C3%A1rik","/wiki/Zolt%C3%A1n_Husz%C3%A1rik","/wiki/Talk:Zolt%C3%A1n_Husz%C3%A1rik","#","/wiki/Zolt%C3%A1n_Husz%C3%A1rik","/w/index.php?title=Zolt%C3%A1n_Husz%C3%A1rik&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Zolt%C3%A1n_Husz%C3%A1rik&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Zolt%C3%A1n_Husz%C3%A1rik","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Zolt%C3%A1n_Husz%C3%A1rik","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Zolt%C3%A1n_Husz%C3%A1rik&oldid=565731627","/w/index.php?title=Zolt%C3%A1n_Husz%C3%A1rik&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/
