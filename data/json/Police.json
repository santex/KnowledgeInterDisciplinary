Their powers\ninclude the legitimized use of force. The term is most commonly associated with\npolice services of a state that are authorized to exercise the police power of\nthat state within a defined legal or territorial area of responsibility. Police\nforces are often defined as being separate from military or other organizations\ninvolved in the defense of the state against foreign aggressors; however,\ngendarmerie are military units charged with civil policing.\n\nLaw enforcement, however, constitutes only part of policing activity.\nPolicing has included an array of activities in different situations, but the\npredominant ones are concerned with the preservation of order. In\nsome societies, in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, these developed\nwithin the context of maintaining the class system and the protection of private\nproperty.

Members may be referred to as\npolice officers, troopers, sheriffs, constables, rangers, peace officers or\ncivic/civil guards. Police of the Soviet-era Eastern Europe were (or are, in\nsome cases, as in Belarus) called the [[militsiya]]. The Irish police are called\nthe Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na (\"guardians of the peace\"); a police officer is called a\ngarda. As police are often in conflict with individuals, slang terms are\nnumerous. Many slang terms for police officers are decades or centuries old with\nlost etymology.\n","linknr":1264,"url":"Police","recorded":1362482195,"links":141,"instances":["law","military_police","spain","country_subdivision","disambiguation","weapon","state","common_law","polity","england","car","law","police_rank","2002_film","police_commander","spain","hong_kong","disambiguation","country_subdivision","brazil","law","weapon","new_york","law_enforcement","chinese_state"],"pdf":["http://www.psi.org.uk/publications/archivepdfs/Role%20pol/INDPOL-0.P.pdf","http://www.psi.org.uk/publications/archivepdfs/Role%20pol/INDPOL-0.P.pdf","http://www.policefoundation.org/pdf/kcppe.pdf","http://www.policefoundation.org/pdf/kcppe.pdf"],"categories":["Crime
