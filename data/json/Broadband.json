{"cursor":"14848","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nThe term 'broadband' refers to the wide bandwidth characteristics of a\ntransmission medium and its ability to transport multiple signals and traffic\ntypes simultaneously. The medium can be coax, optical fiber, twisted pair or\nwireless. In contrast, baseband, describes a communication system in which\ninformation is transported across a single channel.\n\nPrior to the invention of home broadband, dial-up Internet access was the only\nmeans by which one could access the Internet and download files such as songs,\nmovies, e-mails, etc. It would take anywhere from 10â30 minutes to download one\nsong (3.5 MB) and over 28 hours to download a movie (700 MB). Dial-up\nInternet was also considered very inconvenient as it would impair the use of the\nhome telephone line, and users would contemplate whether or not to get a second\nline, and if doing so was worth the cost.\n\nIn 1997, the cable modem was introduced, although the common use of broadband\ndidn't begin rising until 2001. Having a broadband connection enabled one to\ndownload significantly faster than on dial-up. As with many new technologies,\nmost consumers were unable to afford the cost of faster Internet service.\nHowever, high costs weren't a factor for long as by 2004, most average American\nhouseholds considered home broadband service to be affordable. Since its\ninception, broadband has continually strengthened and available connection\nspeeds continue to rise.\n\nDifferent criteria for \"broad\" have been applied in different contexts and\nat different times. Its origin is in physics, acoustics and radio systems\nengineering, where it had been used with a meaning similar to\nwideband. Issued December 12, 1950. However, the\nterm became popularized through the 1990s as a vague marketing term for\nInternet access.\n","linknr":293,"url":"Broadband","recorded":1362545186,"links":53,"instances":["united_states","signal_processing"],"pdf":["http://transition.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2010/db0806/FCC-10-148A1.pdf","http://transition.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2010/db0806/FCC-10-148A1.pdf"],"categories":["Digital technology","Broadband|"],"headings":["In telecommunication","In computer networks","In video","Internet access","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["bandwidth","signal_processing"],["bandwidth","signal_processing"],["national_broadband_plan","united_states"]],"members":["national_broadband_plan","bandwidth"],"related":["Bandwidth_(signal_processing)","Coax","Optical_fiber","Twisted_pair","Wireless","Baseband","Dial-up_Internet_access","Internet","Telephone","Telephone_line","Cable_modem","United_States","Acoustics","Wideband","Internet_access","Telecommunications","Relative_term","Bandwidth_(signal_processing)","Radio","Morse_code","Music","Audio_frequency","Sound_reproduction","Passband","Frequency-division_multiplexing","Television","Wideband","56k_modem","Telephone_line","Voiceband","Digital_subscriber_line","Baseband","Plain_old_telephone_service","Load_coil","Very-high-bitrate_digital_subscriber_line","Broadband_Integrated_Services_Digital_Network","Bit_rate","Computer_network","Line_code","Baseband","Ethernet","10BASE5","Cable_modem","Cable_television","Radio_frequency","10BROAD36","DOCSIS","Internet_access","10PASS-TS","Power_line_communication","Narrowband","ITU-T","G.hn","Local_area_network","Ethernet_over_coax","Analog_signal","Video","Cable_television","Modulation","Baseband","Antonym","Composite_video","Sound_recording_and_reproduction","Streaming_media","IPTV","Video_on_demand","ITU-T","Bit_rate","Primary_Rate_Interface","National_Information_Infrastructure","Buzzword","National_Broadband_Plan_(United_States)","Speed_of_light","Mobile_broadband","Wireless_broadband","Ultra-wideband","Broadband_universal_service","National_broadband_plans_from_around_the_world","Broadband_mapping_in_the_United_States"]}
