{"cursor":"3378","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n  \n\n'Carl Oskar Ursinus' (March 11, 1877 – July 6, 1952) was a pioneer of\nGerman aviation and is remembered mainly for his contributions to sailplane\ndesigns and the sport of gliding. He has been nicknamed the RhÃ¶nvater (\"RhÃ¶n\nfather\") because he founded Germanyâs first gliding club at the Wasserkuppe in\nthe RhÃ¶n Mountains in 1920.\n\nUrsinus was born in WeiÃenfels and attended Technical College in Mittweida.\nAfter graduation, he worked for Borsig on compressors for locomotives and spent\nsome time working on mining machinery in Romania for the firm.\n\nIn 1908, back in Germany, Ursinus began to publish a magazine titled\nFlugsport (âSports Flyingâ), since he had become fascinated by the new\ntechnology of flight. The magazine helped establish a network amongst\nGermanyâs aviation enthusiasts and led to the organisation of Germanyâs first\ninternational airshow.\n\nHe was conscripted into the German Army in 1914 and requested a position in\naircraft design. The request was approved and he was posted to Gothaer\nWaggonfabrik designing warplanes. The famous series of Gotha bombers used by the\nGerman air corps throughout World War I were all based on an Ursinus design of\n1915 that was refined and manufactured as the Gotha G.I. Ursinus' real passion,\nhowever, was for seaplanes, and in 1916 he designed a revolutionary seaplane\nfighter with retractable floats that was unfortunately destroyed before testing\nwas complete.\n\nFollowing the war, the Treaty of Versailles prohibited Germany from building\npowered aircraft, and the attention of German aviators therefore turned to\ngliding. A plateau particularly suited to gliding, the Wasserkuppe, became a\nfocal point for this activity, and in 1920, Ursinus organised a competition\nthere. Twenty-four people attended the meeting between 15 July and 15 September\n1920 including Wolf Hirth and other gliding pioneers. (see also RhÃ¶n-Rossitten\nGesellschaft.)\n\nOver the next decade, this grew in importance to become an international event.\nUrsinus also constructed the first clubhouse on the Wasserkuppe in 1924. He was\npursuing experiments in human-powered flight when the outbreak of World War II\nintervened.\n\nFollowing the war, powered flying was once again forbidden in Germany, but\nUrsinus lived just long enough to see this prohibition lifted.\n\nToday, he is regarded in Germany as the father of gliding, and Germanyâs\nassociation for homebuilt aircraft, the [[Oskar Ursinus-Vereinigung]] (\"Oskar\nUrsinus Association\") bears his name.\n\n{{Persondata \n| NAME = Ursinus, Oskar ALTERNATIVE NAMES = SHORT DESCRIPTION = German aerospace\n| engineer DATE OF BIRTH = March 11, 1877 PLACE OF
