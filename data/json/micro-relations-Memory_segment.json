In a computer system using segmentation, a reference\nto a memory location includes a value that identifies a segment and an offset\nwithin that segment. Segments or sections are also used in object files of\ncompiled programs when they are linked together into a program image and when\nthe image is loaded into memory.\n\nDifferent segments may be created for different program modules, or for\ndifferent classes of memory usage such as code and data segments. Certain\nsegments may even be shared between programs.\n","linknr":248,"url":"Memory_segment","recorded":1362671737,"links":35,"instances":["computer_science","computer_memory","computing","computing","computing","programming","computer_science"],"pdf":["http://download.intel.com/products/processor/manual/325384.pdf","http://download.intel.com/products/processor/manual/325384.pdf","http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/intel/iAPX_432/171821-001_Introduction_to_the_iAPX_432_Architecture_Aug81.pdf","http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/intel/iAPX_432/171821-001_Introduction_to_the_iAPX_432_Architecture_Aug81.pdf"],"categories":["Memory management"],"headings":["Hardware implementation","History","x86 architecture","Object files","References","External links","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["offset","computer_science"],["linking","computing"],["loader","computing"],["module","programming"],["page","computer_memory"],["process","computing"],["thread","computer_science"]],"members":["thread","page","linking","loader","process","module","offset"],"related":["Computer","Primary_memory","Offset_(computer_science)","Object_file","Linking_(computing)","Program_image","Loader_(computing)","Module_(programming)","Code_segment","Data_segment","Memory_protection","Page_(computer_memory)","Paging","Byte","Process_(computing)","Hardware_exception","Segmentation_fault","Page_table","Operating_system","Intel_80386","Memory_management_unit","Burroughs_Corporation","Burroughs_large_systems","Virtual_memory","GE-600_series","Multics","Intel_iAPX_432","Prime_Computer","Stratus_Technologies","Apollo_Computer","IBM_System/38","IBM_AS/400","X86","Intel_8086","Intel_80286","Real_mode","Protected_mode","X86-64","Microsoft_Windows","Win32_Thread_Information_Block","Thread_(computer_science)","Linux_kernel","Object_files","DOS","Intel_Memory_Model","Data_segment","Text_segment","BSS_Segment","Virtual_address_space","Virtual_memory","X86_memory_segmentation","Segmentation_fault"]}
