In physics or everyday discussion, distance may refer\nto a physical length, or an estimation based on other criteria (e.g. \"two\ncounties over\"). In mathematics, a distance function or metric is a\ngeneralization of the concept of physical distance. A metric is a function\nthat behaves according to a specific set of rules, and is a concrete way of\ndescribing what it means for elements of some space to be \"close to\" or \"far\naway from\" each other. In most cases, \"distance from A to B\" is\ninterchangeable with \"distance between B and A\".\n","title":"distance","headings":["Mathematics","Distance versus directed distance and displacement","Other \"distances\"","See also","References"]},"micro-relation":["4: Metric_space","3: Pythagorean_theorem","3: Euclidean_distance","3: Triangle_inequality","2: Mathematics","2: Cartesian_coordinate_system","2: Non-Euclidean_geometry","2: Chebyshev_distance","2: Center_of_gravity","2: Hamming_distance","2: Lee_distance","1: Physics","1: Analytic_geometry","1: Hypotenuse","1: Orthogonal","1: Formula","1: Arc_length","1: Euclidean_space","1: Coordinates","1: Ruler","1: Chessboard","1: Super_ellipse","1: Rigid_body","1: Rotation","1: Calculus_of_variations","1: Euler-Lagrange_equations","1: Einstein_summation_convention","1: Manifolds","1: Curvature","1: Scalar_quantity","1: Lagrange_multiplier","1: Protein_folding","1: Nambu-Goto_action","1: String_theory","1: Computer_vision","1: Least_squares","1: Conic#Homogeneous_coordinates","1: Geometric_distance","1: Non-linear_least_squares","1: Geometry","1: Real_number","1: If_and_only_if","1: Symmetric_relation","1: Topology","1: Real_line","1: Discrete_topology","1: Low_Earth_orbit","1: Subset","1: Infimum","1: Premetric_space","1: Hemimetric_space","1: Hausdorff_distance","1: Supremum","1: Compact_space","1: Metric_space#Distance_between_points_and_sets;_Hausdorff_distance_and_Gromov_metric","1: Graph_theory","1: Negative_number","1: Odometer","1: Euclidean_vector_space","1: Mechanics","1: E-statistic","1: Mahalanobis_distance","1: Statistics","1: Coding_theory","1: Levenshtein_distance","1: Canberra_distance","1: Taxicab_geometry","1: Astronomical_units_of_length","1: Cosmic_distance_ladder","1: Comoving_distance","1: Distance_geometry","1: Dijkstra's_algorithm","1: Exit_number#Distance-based_numbers","1: Distance_measuring_equipment","1: Engineering_tolerance","1: Great-circle_distance","1: Length","1: Milestone","1: Proper_length","1: Distance_matrix","1: Proxemics","1: Meridian_arc"]}
