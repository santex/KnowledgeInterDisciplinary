{"cursor":"5311","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Suzanne Spaak' (c. 1905 - 12 August 1944) was a World War II French Resistance\noperative.\n\nBorn into a prosperous Belgian banking family sometime around 1905. She married\nBrussels-born dramatist Claude Spaak (1904-1990), brother of both Charles Spaak,\na screenwriter, and Paul-Henri Spaak, a Belgian statesmen. Living in Paris, with\nher husband and two children, she enjoyed a life of luxury and prestige as one\nof the city's leading socialites. Her husband had acquired paintings by their\nfellow Belgian, RenÃ© Magritte, and in 1936, Magritte painted her portrait. Her\nlifestyle changed drastically with the onslaught of World War II and the\nsubsequent occupation of France by Germany.\n\nAngry with the suppression, brutality and racial intolerance of the Nazis, she\nvolunteered to work with the underground National Movement Against Racism\n(MNCR). Chris Pauly [http://www.raoulwallenberg.net/?en/saviors/dutch/4249/suzanne-\nspaak.4298.htm Suzanne Spaak profile at The International Raoul Wallenberg\nFoundation online] Spaak's offer of assistance was greeted with a certain\namount of skepticism by members of the French Resistance, who wondered if she\nwould last under difficult and dangerous conditions. Her initial involvement\nwas mundane, i.e. typing, distributing leaflets, and shopping for everyday\nsupplies. She walked all over the city of Paris in an effort to find a hospital\nwilling to take the risk of treating Jews who were in hiding and in dire need\nof medical attention. Using her influence with the upper class of Parisian\nsociety, she knocked on the doors of lawyers, judges, clerics, film stars and\nauthors for support.\n\nWith time and growing atrocities by the Nazis, Spaak devoted herself to ridding\nFrance and her native Belgium of its suppressors. She joined the Red Orchestra\nintelligence network, a Soviet-sponsored organization founded by a Polish Jew,\nLeopold Trepper. Chris Pauly [http://www.raoulwallenberg.net/?en/saviors/dutch/4249/suzanne-\nspaak.4298.htm Suzanne Spaak profile at The International Raoul Wallenberg\nFoundation online] This group conducted very effective intelligence\ngathering in Germany, France, the Netherlands and in neutral Switzerland with\nmembers known as the \"Lucy Ring\". The network became so successful, even\ninfiltrating the German military intelligence service Abwehr, that the Nazis set\nup the \"Red Orchestra Special Detachment\" (\"Sonderkommando Rote Kapelle\") to\ndestroy it.\n\nA mother of two, Spaak worked doggedly to save the lives of Jewish children who\nwere facing deportation to the German death camps. In early 1943, she was part\nof a group that saved a hundred sixty three Jewish children who were about to be\ndeported from the Union Generale des Israelites de France (UGIF) centers. At\nenormous risk to herself and her family, she hid some of the children in her own\nhome, helping to provide the children with clothing and ration cards and\narranging for them be moved to the safety of homes of people in various parts of\nFrance willing to risk hiding them.\n\nIn Belgium, in the spring of 1942, the Germans traced and monitored Red\nOrchestra operative's radio transmitters and made their first arrests of Red\nOrchestra agents. Captured members were brutally tortured and several broke,\ndivulging network secrets that, over the ensuing eighteen months, allowed for\nmore than six hundred people to be arrested, including Suzanne Spaak in Paris.\nSent by the Gestapo to the prison in Fresnes in October 1943, she was kept in\nhorrific conditions and subjected to torture. When the Allied forces broke\nthrough at Normandy and began to fight their way to free Paris, the Gestapo\nprepared to flee but before they did, they began executing certain prisoners.\n\nOn 12 August 1944, just thirteen days before the liberation of Paris, Spaak was\nexecuted by the Gestapo. In 1985, her valor and humanity was recognized by the\ngovernment of Israel, designating her as one of the Righteous Among the Nations\nin honours at the national Holocaust Memorial, Yad Vashem.\n","linknr":135,"url":"Suzanne_Spaak","recorded":1375083412,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Suzanne_Spaak&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Suzanne_Spaak&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Identifying_reliable_sources","/wiki/Talk:Suzanne_Spaak#.23","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Suzanne_Spaak&action=edit","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/World_War_II","/wiki/French_Resistance","/wiki/Belgium","/wiki/Brussels","/wiki/Charles_Spaak","/wiki/Paul-Henri_Spaak","/wiki/Paris","/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Magritte","/wiki/Nazism","/w/index.php?title=National_Movement_Against_Racism&action=edit&redlink=1","#cite_note-1","/wiki/French_Resistance","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/wiki/Red_Orchestra_(spy)","/wiki/Soviet_Union","/wiki/Poland","/wiki/Leopold_Trepper","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Germany","/wiki/France","/wiki/Netherlands","/wiki/Switzerland","/wiki/Lucy_spy_ring","/wiki/Abwehr","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/wiki/Death_camp","/w/index.php?title=Union_Generale_des_Israelites_de_France&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/wiki/Fresnes_prison","/wiki/Allied","/wiki/Normandy","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/wiki/Israel","/wiki/Righteous_Among_the_Nations","/wiki/Holocaust","/wiki/Yad_Vashem","/w/index.php?title=Suzanne_Spaak&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","http://www.raoulwallenberg.net/?en/saviors/dutch/4249/suzanne-spaak.4298.htm","#cite_ref-2","http://www.raoulwallenberg.net/?en/saviors/dutch/4249/suzanne-spaak.4298.htm","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Suzanne_Spaak&oldid=543968411","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1900s_births","/wiki/Category:1944_deaths","/wiki/Category:Belgian_Righteous_Among_the_Nations","/wiki/Category:Spies_who_died_in_the_Holocaust","/wiki/Category:Executed_spies","/wiki/Category:French_Resistance_members","/wiki/Category:Female_wartime_spies","/wiki/Category:Red_Orchestra_(espionage)","/wiki/Category:Female_resistance_members_of_World_War_II","/wiki/Category:Belgian_civilians_killed_in_World_War_II","/wiki/Category:Articles_needing_additional_references_from_March_2013","/wiki/Category:All_articles_needing_additional_references","/wiki/Category:All_articles_with_unsourced_statements","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_unsourced_statements_from_March_2013","/wiki/Category:Date_of_birth_missing","/wiki/Category:Place_of_birth_missing","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Suzanne+Spaak&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Suzanne+Spaak","/wiki/Suzanne_Spaak","/wiki/Talk:Suzanne_Spaak","#","/wiki/Suzanne_Spaak","/w/index.php?title=Suzanne_Spaak&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Suzanne_Spaak&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Suzanne_Spaak","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Suzanne_Spaak","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Suzanne_Spaak&oldid=543968411","/w/index.php?title=Suzanne_Spaak&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q459656","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Suzanne_Spaak&id=543968411","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Suzanne+Spaak","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Suzanne+Spaak&oldid=543968411&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Suzanne_Spaak&printable=yes","//de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suzanne_Spaak","//fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suzanne_Spaak","//la.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susanna_Spaak","//no.wikipedia.org/wiki/Su
