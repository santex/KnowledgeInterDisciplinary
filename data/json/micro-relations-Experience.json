{"cursor":"17367","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Experience' as a general concept comprises knowledge of or skill of some thing\nor some event gained through involvement in or exposure to that thing or\nevent. Compare various contemporary definitions given in the OED (2nd\nedition, 1989): \"[...] 3. The actual observation of facts or events, considered\nas a source of knowledge.[...] 4. a. The fact of being consciously the subject\nof a state or condition, or of being consciously affected by an event. [...] b.\nIn religious use: A state of mind or feeling forming part of the inner religious\nlife; the mental history (of a person) with regard to religious emotion. [...]\n6. What has been experienced; the events that have taken place within the\nknowledge of an individual, a community, mankind at large, either during a\nparticular period or generally. [...] 7. a. Knowledge resulting from actual\nobservation or from what one has undergone. [...] 8. The state of having been\noccupied in any department of study or practice, in affairs generally, or in the\nintercourse of life; the extent to which, or the length of time during which,\none has been so occupied; the aptitudes, skill, judgement, etc. thereby\nacquired.\"  The history of the word experience aligns it closely with the\nconcept of [[experiment]]. For example, the word experience could be used in a\nstatement like: \"I have experience in fishing\".\n\nThe concept of experience generally refers to know-how or procedural knowledge,\nrather than propositional knowledge: on-the-job training rather than book-\nlearning. Philosophers dub knowledge based on experience \"empirical knowledge\"\nor \"a posteriori knowledge\".\n\nThe interrogation of experience has a long tradition in continental philosophy.\nExperience plays an important role in the philosophy of SÃ¸ren Kierkegaard. The\nGerman term [[wiktionary:Erfahrung|Erfahrung]], often translated into English as\n\"experience\", has a slightly different implication, connoting the coherency of\nlife's experiences.\n\nA person with considerable experience in a specific field can gain a reputation\nas an expert.\n\nCertain religious traditions (such as types of Buddhism, Surat Shabd Yoga,\nmysticism and Pentecostalism) and educational paradigms with, for example, the\nconditioning of military recruit-training (also known as \"boot camps\"), stress\nthe experiential nature of human epistemology. This stands in contrast to\nalternatives: traditions of dogma, logic or reasoning. Participants in\nactivities such as tourism, extreme sports and recreational drug-use also tend\nto stress the importance of experience.\n","linknr":757,"url":"Experience","recorded":1362480796,"links":73,"instances":["cognitive","sociology","sociology","emerson","logic"],"pdf":["http://www.elainehatfield.com/103.pdf","http://www.elainehatfield.com/103.pdf"],"categories":["Sources of knowledge","Philosophy of science","Concepts in metaphysics","Perception","Consciousness"],"headings":["Types of experience","Contexts of experience","Changes in experience through history","Alternatives to experience","Writing","Art","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/Socrates.png/18px-Socrates.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Wikiquote-logo-en.svg/40px-Wikiquote-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg/16px-Portal-puzzle.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/People_icon.svg/16px-People_icon.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["interpretation","logic"],["shared_experience","sociology"],["norm","sociology"],["interpretation","logic"],["perspective","cognitive"],["experience","emerson"]],"members":["perspective","norm","shared_experience","experience","interpretation"],"related":["Concept","Oxford_English_Dictionary","Know-how","Procedural_knowledge","Propositional_knowledge","On-the-job_training","Book_learning","Philosophy","Empirical_knowledge","Philosophy","Philosophy_of_Søren_Kierkegaard","German_language","Personal_life","Expert","Religious","Traditions","Buddhism","Surat_Shabd_Yoga","Mysticism","Pentecostalism","Paradigms","Physical_exercise","Recruit_training","Epistemology","Dogma","Logic","Reason","Tourism","Extreme_sports","Recreational_drug_use","Mind","Wisdom","Interpretation_(logic)","Time","Body","Mind","Emotional","Spirituality","Vicarious","Virtual_reality","Observable","Modal_property","Mind","Intellect","Consciousness","Thought","Perception","Memory","Emotion","Free_will","Imagination","Cognitive","Mathematicians","Mathematical_realism","Paul_Erdős","Kurt_Gödel","Continuum_hypothesis","Falling_in_love","Mate_selection","Empathy","Mysticism","Neuropsychology","Altered_states_of_consciousness","Temporal_lobe_epilepsy","Mystical_practice","Sensory_deprivation","Mind_control","Hypnosis","Meditation","Prayer","Mystical_discipline","Mantra_meditation","Yoga","Sufism","Dream_yoga","Surat_shabd_yoga","Primitive_religion","Spiritual_experience","Psychoactive_drug","Entheogen","Cannabis","Psilocybin","Peyote","Dextromethorphan","Ayahuasca","Psychoacoustics","Binaural_beats","Shared_experience_(sociology)","Norm_(sociology)","Customs","Values","Traditions","Social_role","Symbols","Languages","Virtual_reality","Role-playing_game","Role-playing_video_game","Experience_point","First_hand","Sense","Perception","Interpretation_(logic)","Second_hand","Perspective_(cognitive)","Rumour","Hearsay","Authority","Individual","Subjectivity","Perception","Reality","Interaction","Individual","Data","Internalize","Biological","Neurological","Relativity","Experiential_group","Psychoeducation","Post-modernism","Modernity","Post-modernity","Immanuel_Kant","Reason","Ralph_Waldo_Emerson","Experience_(Emerson)","Emotion","Pessimism","Transcendentalism","Happening","Customer_experience","Empiricism","Experience_economy","Experiential_education","Experiential_marketing","Perception","Thrillseeker"]}
