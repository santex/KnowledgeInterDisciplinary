{"cursor":"41727","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\nThe term \"'mythology'\" can refer either to the study of myths (e.g.,\ncomparative mythology), or to a body or collection of myths (a 'mythos', e.g.,\nInca mythology). Kirk, p. 8; \"myth\", EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica In\nfolkloristics, a 'myth' is a sacred narrative usually explaining how the world\nor humankind came to be in its present form, Dundes,\nIntroduction, p. 1 although, in a very broad sense, the word can refer to\nany traditional story. Kirk, \"Defining\", p. 57; Kirk, Myth, p. 74; Simpson,\np. 3 Bruce Lincoln defines myth as \"ideology in narrative\nform\". Myths typically involve supernatural characters and are\nendorsed by rulers or priests. They may arise as either truthful depictions or\noverelaborated accounts of historical events, as allegory for or\npersonification of natural phenomena, or as an explanation of ritual. They are\ntransmitted to convey religious or idealized experience, to establish\nbehavioral models, and to teach.\n\nEarly rival classifications of Greek mythos by Euhemerus, Plato's [[Phaedrus\n(dialogue)|Phaedrus]], and Sallustius were developed by the neoplatonists and\nrevived by Renaissance mythographers as in the [[Theologia mythologica]] (1532).\nNineteenth-century comparative mythology reinterpreted myth as evolution toward\nscience (E. B. Tylor), \"disease of language\" (Max MÃ¼ller), or misinterpretation\nof magical ritual (James Frazer). Later interpretations rejected opposition\nbetween myth and science, such as Jungian archetypes, Joseph Campbell's\n\"metaphor of spiritual potentiality\", or LÃ©vi-Strauss's fixed mental\narchitecture. Tension between Campbell's comparative search for monomyth or Ur-\nmyth and anthropological mythologists' skepticism of universal origin has marked\nthe 20th century. Further, modern mythopoeia such as fantasy novels, manga, and\nurban legend, with many competing artificial mythoi acknowledged as fiction,\nsupports the idea of myth as ongoing social practice.\n","linknr":1472,"url":"Mythology","recorded":1362373203,"links":148,"instances":["god","fiction","social","roman_mythology","aeschylus","mythology","philosopher","genre"],"pdf":["http://www.fupress.com/Archivio/pdf/3622.pdf","http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/theses/available/etd-05172011-113805/unrestricted/OLSON_EL_T_2011.pdf","http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/theses/available/etd-05172011-113805/unrestricted/OLSON_EL_T_2011.pdf"],"categories":["Anthropology
