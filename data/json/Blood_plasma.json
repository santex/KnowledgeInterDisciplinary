{"cursor":"10157","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Blood plasma' is the straw-colored/pale-yellow liquid component of blood that\nnormally holds the blood cells in whole blood in suspension. It makes up about\n55% of total blood volume. It is the intravascular fluid part of extracellular\nfluid (all body fluid outside of cells). It is mostly water (93% by volume), and\ncontains dissolved proteins (i.e.âalbumins, globulins, and fibrinogen), glucose,\nclotting factors, electrolytes (Na +, Ca 2+ ,\nMg 2+ , HCO 3- Cl - etc.), hormones and\ncarbon dioxide (plasma being the main medium for excretory product\ntransportation). Plasma also serves as the protein reserve of the human body. It\nplays a vital role in intravascular osmotic effect that keeps electrolyte in\nbalance form and protects the body from infection and other blood disorders.\n\nBlood plasma is prepared by spinning a tube of fresh blood containing an\nanticoagulant in a centrifuge until the blood cells fall to the bottom of the\ntube. The blood plasma is then poured or drawn off. {{cite book\n  | last = Maton first = Anthea authorlink = coauthors = Jean Hopkins, Charles\n  | William McLaughlin, Susan Johnson, Maryanna Quon Warner, David LaHart, Jill\n  | D.
