{"cursor":"18858","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" basalt collected by Apollo 15.]] 'Moon rock' describes rock that formed on the\n Earth's moon. The term is also loosely applied to other lunar materials\n collected during the course of human exploration of the Moon.\n\nRocks collected from the Moon have been measured by radiometric dating\ntechniques. They range in age from about 3.16 billion years old for the basaltic\nsamples derived from the lunar maria, up to about 4.5 billion years old for\nrocks derived from the highlands. Based on the age dating technique\nof \"crater counting,\" the youngest basaltic eruptions are believed to have\noccurred about 1.2 billion years ago, but scientists do not possess\nsamples of these lavas. In contrast, the oldest ages of rocks from the Earth are\nbetween 3.8 and 4.28 billion years old.\n\nThere are currently three sources of Moon rocks on Earth: 1) those collected by\nUS Apollo missions; 2) samples returned by the Soviet Union Luna missions; and\n3) rocks that were ejected naturally from the lunar surface by cratering events\nand subsequently fell to Earth as lunar meteorites. During the six Apollo\nsurface excursions, 2,415 samples weighing 382 kg (842 lb) were\ncollected, the majority by Apollo 15, 16, and 17. The three Luna spacecraft\nreturned with an additional 0.32 kg (0.7 lb) of samples. Since 1980,\nover 120 lunar meteorites representing about 60 different meteorite fall events\n(none witnessed) have been collected on Earth, with a total mass of over\n48 kg (105.8 lb). About one third of these were discovered by US and\nJapanese teams searching for Antarctic meteorites (e.g., ANSMET), with most of\nthe remainder having been discovered by collectors in the desert regions of\nnorthern Africa and Oman.\n\nAlmost all lunar rocks are depleted in volatiles and are completely lacking in\nhydrated minerals common in Earth rocks. In some regards, lunar rocks are\nclosely related to Earth's rocks in their isotopic composition of the element\noxygen. The Apollo moon rocks were collected using a variety of tools, including\nhammers, rakes, scoops, tongs, and core tubes. Most were photographed prior to\ncollection to record the condition in which they were found. They were placed\ninside sample bags and then a Special Environmental Sample Container for return\nto the Earth to protect them from contamination. In contrast to the Earth, large\nportions of the lunar crust appear to be composed of rocks with high\nconcentrations of the mineral anorthite. The mare basalts have relatively high\niron values. Furthermore, some of the mare basalts have very high levels of\ntitanium (in the form of ilmenite).\n","linknr":405,"url":"Moon_rock","recorded":1362268783,"links":58,"instances":["optics","astronaut","crater","tool","tool"],"pdf":["http://curator.jsc.nasa.gov/lunar/lsc/70017.pdf","http://curator.jsc.nasa.gov/lunar/lsc/70017.pdf"],"categories":["Apollo
