Pyridoxamine is converted to the biologically active\nform of vitamin B 6, pyridoxal 5-phosphate, via the vitamin\nB 6 salvage pathway. Vitamin\nB 6 acts as an enzyme cofactor in a variety of metabolic processes. In\nfood, pyridoxamine is commonly found as a 5â-phosphate derivative, which is\nhydrolyzed by intestinal phosphatases to pyridoxamine and absorbed in the\njejunum. Absorbed pyridoxamine is converted to pyridoxamine 5â-\nphosphate by pyridoxal kinase, which is further converted to the active\npyridoxal 5-phosphate by pyridoxamine-phosphate transaminase or pyridoxine 5â-\nphosphate oxidase.\n\nPyridoxamine is based on a pyridine ring structure, with hydroxyl, methyl,\naminomethyl, and hydroxymethyl substituents. It differs from pyridoxine by the\nsubstituent at the 4-position. The phenol at position 3 and aminomethyl group at\nposition 4 of its ring endow pyridoxamine with a variety of chemical properties,\nincluding the scavenging of free radical species and carbonyl species formed in\nsugar and lipid degradation and chelation of metal ions that catalyze Amadori\nreactions.\n","linknr":401,"url":"Pyridoxamine","recorded":1362575230,"links":32,"instances":["chemistry","chemistry"],"pdf":["http://www.biomedcentral.com/content/pdf/cd-592993.pdf","http://www.biomedcentral.com/content/pdf/cd-592993.pdf"],"categories":["Pyridines","B vitamins","Dietary supplements","Alcohols"],"headings":["Research","FDA Regulatory Activity","Patenting Activity","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/Pyridoxamine.png/120px-Pyridoxamine.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fb/Yes_check.svg/7px-Yes_check.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fb/Yes_check.svg/7px-Yes_check.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fb/Yes_check.svg/7px-Yes_check.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fb/Yes_check.svg/7px-Yes_check.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fb/Yes_check.svg/7px-Yes_check.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fb/Yes_check.svg/7px-Yes_check.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fb/Yes_check.svg/7px-Yes_check.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fb/Yes_check.svg/14px-Yes_check.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fb/Yes_check.svg/10px-Yes_check.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/X_mark.svg/10px-X_mark.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["scavenger","chemistry"],["salt","chemistry"]],"members":["salt","scavenger"],"related":["Vitamer","Vitamin_B6","Pyridoxal","Pyridoxine","Pyridoxal_5-phosphate","Enzyme_cofactor","Intestinal","Phosphatase","Jejunum","Pyridoxal_kinase","Pyridoxamine-phosphate_transaminase","Pyridoxine_5’-phosphate_oxidase","Pyridine","Hydroxyl","Methyl","Aminomethyl","Hydroxymethyl","Substituent","Scavenger_(chemistry)","Free_radical","Chelation","Amadori_rearrangement_","Copper","Fe","Hydroxyl_radical","Maillard_reaction","Advanced_glycation_endproducts","Diabetes","Amadori_product","Glycation","Protein","Catalysis","Redox_reaction","Carbonyl","Chelation","Animal_model","Kidney","Histology","Aminoguanidine","Diabetic_nephropathy","Lipid_peroxidation","Carbonyl","Diabetic_neuropathy","Retinopathy","Kidney_stone","Ionizing_radiation","Gastrointestinal","Epithelial","Apoptosis","Amifostine","Food_and_Drug_Administration","Dietary_supplement","Hydrochloride","Salt_(chemistry)","United_States","Diabetic_nephropathy","Trade_association","Dietary_Supplement_Health_and_Education_Act_of_1994","Patent_application","World_Intellectual_Property_Organization","Pyridoxamine-oxaloacetate_transaminase","Pyridoxamine-pyruvate_transaminase","Pyridoxamine-phosphate_transaminase","Clinicaltrials.gov"]}
