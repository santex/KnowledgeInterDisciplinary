Kinesiology addresses physiological, mechanical, and psychological\nmechanisms. Applications of kinesiology to human health include: biomechanics\nand orthopedics, strength & conditioning, sport psychology, rehabilitation, such\nas physical and occupational therapy, as well as sport and exercise.\nIndividuals who have earned degrees in kinesiology can work in research, the\nfitness industry, clinical settings, and in industrial environments.\nStudies of human and animal motion include measures from motion tracking\nsystems, electrophysiology of muscle and brain activity, various methods for\nmonitoring physiological function, and other behavioral and cognitive research\ntechniques.
