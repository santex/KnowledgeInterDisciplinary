There is no scientifically precise\ndefinition of genius, and the question of whether the notion itself has any real\nmeaning has long been a subject of debate. The term is used in various ways: to\nrefer to a particular aspect of an individual, or the individual in his or her\nentirety; to a scholar in many subjects (e.g. Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz or\nLeonardo da Vinci) <ref></ref> or a scholar in a single subject (e.g., Albert\nEinstein or Isaac Newton). Research into what causes genius and mastery is still\nin its early stages, and psychology offers relevant insights.\n",
