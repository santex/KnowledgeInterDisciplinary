UniProt.\n[http://www.uniprot.org/keywords/160 Keyword Chromosomal rearrangement].\nAccessed 26 Dec 2012. Such changes may involve several different classes\nof events, like deletions, duplications, inversions, and translocations.\nUsually, these events are caused by a breakage in the DNA double helices at two\ndifferent locations, followed by a rejoining of the broken ends to produce a new\nchromosomal arrangement of genes, different from the gene order of the\nchromosomes before they were broken.

PMCID: PMC1015848\n\nSome chromosomal regions are more prone to rearrangement than others and thus\nare the source of genetic diseases and cancer. This instability is usually due\nto the propensity of these regions to misalign during DNA repair, exacerbated by\ndefects of the appearance of replication proteins (like FEN1 or Pol Î´) that\nubiquitously affect the integrity of the genome.
