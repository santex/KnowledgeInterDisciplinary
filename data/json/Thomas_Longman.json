{"cursor":"2745","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Thomas Longman' (1699- 18 June 1755) was an English publisher who founded the\npublishing house of Longman.\n\nLongman was bom at Bristol, the son of Ezekiel Longman and his second wife Sarah\nGibbon. The Longman family had been involved in the manufacture of soap for\nseveral generations and his father owned a shop and stalls in Temple Street.\nLongman's parents had died by the time he was nine. His father requested in his\nwill that he be \"especially well and handsomely bred and educated\". From his\nmother he inherited a considerable amount of property at Winford, Winfrith,\nRudghill and Stroud. When Longman was seventeen his guardians - his brother\nEzekiel, Nathaniel Webb and Mrs Thomas Coules - apprenticed him for seven years\nto John Osbom, a bookseller in Lombard Street, London. In 1724, when his\napprenticeship was ended, he purchased the business of John Taylor, a bookseller\nin Paternoster Row for Â£2,282. Taylor had been the first publisher of ' Robinson\nCrusoe', and traded at the sign of the Ship and Black Swan.\n\nIn time, John Osborn entered into partnership with Longman, and they traded as\n'J. Osbom & T. Longman' at the sign of the Ship. They were among the original\nshareholders of the [[Cyclopaedia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and\nSciences]] of Ephraim Chambers which became very successful and profitable When\nOsborn, whose daughter became the wife of Longman, died in about 1734 Longman\nbecame sole owner of the business. He steadily increased the business by buying\nshares in sound literary properties. In 1740 he published the third volume of\nDavid Hume's first work, [[A Treatise of Human Nature]] after he had been\nintroduced to Hume by Francis Hutcheson. In 1744 he held the largest number of\nshares of Chambers's ' Cyclopaedia,' owning nearly a sixth. He was one of the\nsix booksellers who entered into an agreement with Samuel Johnson to produce an\nEnglish dictionary, the ' Plan ' of which was issued in 1747. In 1753 he took\ninto partnership his nephew Thomas who carried on the business.\n\nLongman died, apparently childless,on 18 June 1755.\n\nLongman married Mary Osborn, daughter of John Osborn in 1731. They had no\nchildren.\n","linknr":91,"url":"Thomas_Longman","recorded":1364131189,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Thomas_Longman&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Thomas_Longman&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/Longman","/wiki/Bristol","/wiki/Paternoster_Row","#cite_note-DNB-1","/wiki/Cyclopaedia,_or_an_Universal_Dictionary_of_Arts_and_Sciences","/wiki/Ephraim_Chambers","/wiki/David_Hume","/wiki/A_Treatise_of_Human_Nature","/wiki/Francis_Hutcheson_(philosopher)","/wiki/Samuel_Johnson","/w/index.php?title=Thomas_Longman_(died_1797)&action=edit&redlink=1","#cite_note-DNB-1","#cite_note-DNB-1","#cite_note-DNB-1","/w/index.php?title=Thomas_Longman&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-DNB_1-0","#cite_ref-DNB_1-1","#cite_ref-DNB_1-2","#cite_ref-DNB_1-3","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/12px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png","//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Longman,_Thomas_(DNB00)","/wiki/Dictionary_of_National_Biography","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Thomas_Longman&oldid=511527862","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1699_births","/wiki/Category:1755_deaths","/wiki/Category:English_publishers_(people)","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Thomas+Longman&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Thomas+Longman","/wiki/Thomas_Longman","/wiki/Talk:Thomas_Longman","#","/wiki/Thomas_Longman","/w/index.php?title=Thomas_Longman&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Thomas_Longman&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Thomas_Longman","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Thomas_Longman","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Thomas_Longman&oldid=511527862","/w/index.php?title=Thomas_Longman&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Thomas_Longman&id=511527862","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Thomas+Longman","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Thomas+Longman&oldid=511527862&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Thomas_Longman&printable=yes","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Longman","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=skins.vector&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","/w/index.php?title=MediaWiki:Gadget-ReferenceTooltips.js&action=raw&ctype=text/javascript&508635914","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":["philosopher","died_1797"],"pdf":[],"categories":["1699
