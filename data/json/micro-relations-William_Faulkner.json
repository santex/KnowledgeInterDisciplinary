He is primarily known and\nacclaimed for his novels and short stories, many of which are set in the\nfictional Yoknapatawpha County, a setting Faulkner created based on Lafayette\nCounty, where he spent most of his life, and Holly Springs/Marshall\nCounty. Obituary [[Variety Obituaries|Variety]], July 11, 1962.\n\nFaulkner was one of the most important writers in Southern literature in the\nUnited States, along with Mark Twain, Robert Penn Warren, Flannery O'Connor,\nTruman Capote, Eudora Welty, Thomas Wolfe, Harper Lee and Tennessee Williams. Though his work was\npublished as early as 1919, and largely during the 1920s and 1930s, Faulkner was\nrelatively unknown until receiving the 1949 Nobel Prize in Literature. Two of\nhis works, [[A Fable]] (1954) and his last novel [[The Reivers]] (1962), won the\nPulitzer Prize for Fiction.\n\nIn 1998, the Modern Library ranked his 1929 novel [[The Sound and the Fury]]\nsixth on its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century;\nalso on the list were [[As I Lay Dying (novel)|As I Lay Dying]] (1930) and\n[[Light in August]] (1932). [[Absalom, Absalom!]] (1936) is often included on\nsimilar lists.\n","linknr":706,"url":"William_Faulkner","recorded":1362372202,"links":97,"instances":["theater"],"pdf":["http://ir.lib.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/metadb/up/kiyo/AA11747932/KJ00004184370.pdf"],"categories":["1897 births","1962 deaths","American Nobel laureates","American novelists","American short story writers","National Book Award winners","Nobel laureates in Literature","People from Union County, Mississippi","People from Oxford, Mississippi","Pulitzer Prize for Fiction winners","Southern United States in fiction","William Faulkner|","Writers from Mississippi","University of Virginia alumni","Deaths from myocardial infarction"],"headings":["Biography","Writing","Criticism","Awards","Bibliography","Audio recordings","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/William_Faulkner_1949.jpg/200px-William_Faulkner_1949.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c9/Faulkner_signature.png/160px-Faulkner_signature.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/William_Faulkner_01_KMJ.jpg/250px-William_Faulkner_01_KMJ.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/TheFaulknerPortable.jpg/250px-TheFaulknerPortable.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4b/Books-aj.svg_aj_ashton_01.svg/32px-Books-aj.svg_aj_ashton_01.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Wikiquote-logo-en.svg/40px-Wikiquote-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["play","theater"]],"members":["play"],"related":["New_Albany,_Mississippi","Mississippi","Byhalia,_Mississippi","Mississippi","United_States","English_language","Episcopal","Herman_Melville","Sherwood_Anderson","The_Bible","Honoré_de_Balzac","Mark_Twain","Emily_Bronte","William_Shakespeare","Leo_Tolstoy","Gustave_Flaubert","Cormac_McCarthy","Gabriel_Garcia_Marquez","Jim_Harrison","Toni_Morrison","Ken_Kesey","Flannery_O'_Connor","Don_Delillo","Harper_Lee","Mario_Vargas_Llosa","Mo_Yan","Rabih_Alameddine","Oxford,_Mississippi","Mississippi","Novel","Short_story","Play_(theater)","Poetry","Essays","Screenplay","Yoknapatawpha_County","Lafayette_County,_Mississippi","Holly_Springs,_Mississippi","Marshall_County,_Mississippi","Southern_literature","Mark_Twain","Robert_Penn_Warren","Flannery_O'Connor","Truman_Capote","Eudora_Welty","Thomas_Wolfe","Harper_Lee","Tennessee_Williams","Nobel_Prize_in_Literature","Pulitzer_Prize_for_Fiction","Modern_Library","Modern_Library_100_Best_Novels","New_Albany,_Mississippi","Mississippi","American_South","Ripley,_Mississippi","Oxford,_Mississippi","Nobelprize.org","Charles_Dickens","Grimms'_Fairy_Tales","William_Clark_Falkner","Romantic_era","University_of_Mississippi","Sigma_Alpha_Epsilon","James_Joyce","Good_old_boys","United_States_Army","Royal_Flying_Corps","New_Orleans,_Louisiana","Sherwood_Anderson","St._Louis_Cathedral,_New_Orleans","Pirate's_Alley","William_Hawks","Cinema_of_the_United_States","University_of_Virginia","Charlottesville,_Virginia","Myocardial_infarction","Byhalia,_Mississippi","Rowan_Oak","University_of_Mississippi","Oxford,_Mississippi","College_Hill_Presbyterian_Church","Oxford,_Mississippi","Honeymoon","Pascagoula,_Mississippi","Antebellum_architecture","Rowan_Oak","Irish_people","University_of_Mississippi","Alcoholism","Howard_Hawks","Script_supervisor","Stockholm","Thorsten_Jonsson","Tor_Bonnier","Short_story","Anthology","A_Rose_for_Emily","Red_Leaves","That_Evening_Sun","Dry_September","Yoknapatawpha_County","Oxford,_Mississippi","Diction","Cadence","Minimalism","Ernest_Hemingway","Stream_of_consciousness_writing","Southern_Gothic","Flannery_O'Connor","Nathaniel_Hawthorne","New_Critics","Cleanth_Brooks","Modernist_literature","Southern_Renaissance","Nobel_Prize_in_Literature","Bertrand_Russell","PEN/Faulkner_Award_for_Fiction","Rust_College","Holly_Springs,_Mississippi","Chevalier_de_la_Legion_d'honneur","Pulitzer_Prize","National_Book_Award","National_Book_Foundation","Neil_Baldwin","National_Book_Foundation","Rhea_Galati","United_States_Postal_Service","Postage_stamp","Scott_catalog","Faux_Faulkner_contest","Center_for_Faulkner_Studies","Library_of_America","Library_of_America","Library_of_America","Library_of_America","Library_of_America","Oxford,_Mississippi","Byhalia,_Mississippi"]}
