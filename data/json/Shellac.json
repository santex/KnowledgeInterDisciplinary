{"cursor":"21579","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n'Shellac' is a resin secreted by the female lac bug, on trees in the forests of\nIndia and Thailand. It is processed and sold as dry flakes (pictured at right),\nwhich are dissolved in ethyl alcohol to make liquid shellac, which is used as a\nbrush-on colorant, food glaze and wood finish. Shellac functions as a tough\nnatural primer, sanding sealant, tannin-blocker, odour-blocker, stain, and high-\ngloss varnish. Shellac was once used in electrical applications as it possesses\ngood insulation qualities and it seals out moisture. Phonograph (gramophone)\nrecords were also made of it during the pre-1950s, 78-rpm recording era.\n\nFrom the time it replaced oil and wax finishes in the 19th century, shellac was\none of the dominant wood finishes in the western world until it was largely\nreplaced by nitrocellulose lacquer in the 1920s and 1930s.\n","linknr":382,"url":"Shellac","recorded":1362481439,"links":46,"instances":["paint","electrical_engineering","silk","material_appearance","plant_resin"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Wood finishing materials","Food additives","Insect products","Polymers","Resins","Waxes","Excipients"],"headings":["Production","Colors and availability","Properties","History","Uses","Gallery","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/Shellac_varities.png/220px-Shellac_varities.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/1c/Haydn_shellac.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e5/Schellak.jpg/119px-Schellak.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/17/Shellac.JPG/120px-Shellac.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/07/Shellac_flakes_closeup.JPG/120px-Shellac_flakes_closeup.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/Shellac_board.JPG/120px-Shellac_board.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["primer","paint"],["gloss","material_appearance"],["cocoon","silk"],["mastic","plant_resin"],["armature","electrical_engineering"]],"members":["primer","armature","cocoon","gloss","mastic"],"related":["Resin","Kerria_lacca","India","Thailand","Ethyl_alcohol","Glazing_agent","Wood_finish","Primer_(paint)","Sanding","Sealant","Tannin","Odour","Wood_stain","Gloss_(material_appearance)","Varnish","Electrical_insulation","Phonograph","Gramophone_record","Nitrocellulose_lacquer","Bark","Cocoon_(silk)","Cochineal","Kursum","Ethyl_alcohol","Cabinetry","Polyurethane","Wainscoting","Luthier","Bioadhesive","Polymer","Plastic","Wood_flour","Thermoplastic","Urushi","Solubility","Alkaline","Ammonia","Sodium_borate","Sodium_carbonate","Sodium_hydroxide","Organic_solvent","Alcohol","Hydrolysis","Aliphatic","Alicyclic","Hydroxy_acids","Aleuritic_acid","Shellolic_acid","Mahabharata","East_Indies","Lapis_lazuli","Ultramarine","Cassone","Dowry","Spirit_varnish","Benzoin_resin","Mastic_(plant_resin)","Journal_of_the_American_Institute_of_Conservation","Infrared_spectroscopy","Sealing_wax","American_South","Pine","Paneling","Drywall","Polyurethane","Polyvinyl_chloride","Gramophone_records","Braille","Wear","Picture_frames","Boxes","Jewelry","Inkwells","Dentures","Plastics","Inductor","Electric_motor","Electrical_generator","Transformer","Armature_(electrical_engineering)","Cross-linked_polyester","Pine_resin","Bakelite","Barium_sulfate","Calcium_carbonate","Zinc_sulfide","Aluminium_oxide","Malachite","French_polish","Wood_finishing","Viol","Guitar","Piano","Glazing_agent","Excipients","Apple","Food_additive","E_number","Wood","Resin","Pigments","Wood_stain","Ban_Khwao_District","Chaiyaphum_province","Citrus_fruits","Lemons","Dentistry","India_ink","Cyclist","Bicycle_handlebar","Fountain_pen","Saxophone","Myrrh","Frankincense","Abrasive_wheel","Plaster_of_paris","Corundum","Aluminium_oxide","Fireworks","Watchmaking","Pallet_fork","Bakelite","Zein"]}
