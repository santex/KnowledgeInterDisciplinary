Virtually all of these human uses require fresh water.\n\n97% of the water on the Earth is salt water. However, only three percent is\nfresh water; slightly over two thirds of this is frozen in glaciers and polar\nice caps. The remaining unfrozen freshwater is found\nmainly as groundwater, with only a small fraction present above ground or in the\nair.\n\nFresh water is a renewable resource, yet the world's supply of clean, fresh\nwater is steadily decreasing. [http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/i-\nd/342896/title/Global_groundwater_use_outpaces_supply Global groundwater use\noutpaces supply; Measure reveals unsustainable use of world's aquifers]\nAugust 8th, 2012 Science News Water demand already exceeds supply in\nmany parts of the world and as the world population continues to rise, so too\ndoes the water demand. Awareness of the global importance of preserving water\nfor ecosystem services has only recently emerged as, during the 20th century,\nmore than half the worldâs wetlands have been lost along with their valuable\nenvironmental services for Water Education. The framework for allocating\nwater resources to water users (where such a framework exists) is known as\nwater
