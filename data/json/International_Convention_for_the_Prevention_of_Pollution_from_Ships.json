{"cursor":"11286","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Marpol 73/78' is the 'International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution\nFrom Ships, 1973 as modified by the Protocol of 1978'. (\"Marpol\" is short for\nmarine pollution and 73/78 short for the years 1973 and 1978.)\n\nMarpol 73/78 is one of the most important international marine environmental\nconventions. It was designed to minimize pollution of the seas, including\ndumping, oil and exhaust pollution. Its stated object is: to preserve the marine\nenvironment through the complete elimination of pollution by oil and other\nharmful substances and the minimization of accidental discharge of such\nsubstances.\n\nThe original MARPOL Convention was signed on 17 February 1973, but did not come\ninto force. The current Convention is a combination of 1973 Convention and the\n1978 Protocol. It entered into force on 2 October 1983. As of 31 December 2005,\n136 countries, representing 98% of the world's shipping tonnage, are parties to\nthe Convention.\n\nAll ships flagged under countries that are signatories to MARPOL are subject to\nits requirements, regardless of where they sail and member nations are\nresponsible for vessels registered under their respective nationalities.
