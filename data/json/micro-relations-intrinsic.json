It is independent of how much of the material is\npresent and is independent of the form of the material, e.g., one large piece or\na collection of smaller pieces. Intrinsic properties are dependent mainly on the\nchemical composition or structure of the material. Food and Packaging\nEngineering (IFNHH, Massey University, NZ)\n\nA property that is not essential or inherent is called an 'extrinsic' property.\nFor example, density is a physical intrinsic property of any physical object,\nwhereas weight is an extrinsic property that varies depending on the strength of\nthe gravitational field in which the respective object is placed.\n\nFor example, in biology, intrinsic effects originate from inside an organism or\ncell, such as an autoimmune disease or intrinsic immunity.\n","linknr":91,"url":"intrinsic","recorded":1362564766,"links":14,"instances":["economics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Motivation"],"headings":["See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["sunspots","economics"]],"members":["sunspots"],"related":["Density","Physical_body","Weight","Autoimmunity","Intrinsic_immunity","Intensive_and_extensive_properties","Intrinsic_function","Intrinsic_equation","Motivation","Sunspots_(economics)"]}
