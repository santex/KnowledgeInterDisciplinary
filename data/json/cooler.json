      "text" : "\n\nA 'cooler', 'cool\nbox',<ref>[http://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/british/coolbox Cool\nbox definition]</ref> 'portable ice chest', 'ice box', 'chilly bin' (in New\nZealand), or 'esky' (Australia) most commonly is an insulated box used to keep\nfood or drink cool. Ice cubes are most commonly placed in it to help the things\ninside stay cool. Ice packs are sometimes used, as they either contain the\nmelting water inside, or have a gel sealed inside that stays cold longer than\nplain ice (absorbing heat as it changes phase).\n\nThe portable ice chest was invented by Richard C. Laramy of Joliet, Illinois. On\nFebruary 24, 1951, Laramy filed an application with the United States Patent\nOffice for a portable ice chest (Serial No. 212,573). The patent (#2,663,157)\nwas issued December 22, 1953.\n\nThe Coleman Company popularized the cooler with its initial offering of a\ngalvanized cooler in 1954. Three years later, Coleman developed a process to\nmake a plastic liner for coolers and jugs.\n\nCoolers are often taken on picnics, and on vacation or holiday. Where summers\nare hot, they may also be used just for getting cold groceries home from the\nstore, such as keeping ice cream from melting in a hot automobile. Even without\nadding ice, this can be helpful, particularly if the trip home will be lengthy.\n\nThey are usually made with interior and exterior shells of plastic, with a hard\nfoam in between. They come in sizes from small personal ones to large family\nones with wheels. Disposable ones are made solely from polystyrene foam (such as\nis a disposable coffee cup) about 2&nbsp;cm or one inch thick. Most reusable\nones have molded-in handles; a few have shoulder straps. The cooler has\ndeveloped from just a means of keeping beverages cold into a mode of\ntransportation with the Ride on Cooler.\n\nIn the United Kingdom the common name is a \"cool-box\". In the United States they\nare usually called a \"cooler\". In New Zealand they are generally called a\n\"chilly bin\", a generic trademark; the common Australian name of \"Esky\" is also\na generic trademark.\n",
