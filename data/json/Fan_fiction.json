{"cursor":"32605","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Fan fiction' (alternatively referred to as 'fanfiction', 'fanfic', 'FF', or\nsimply 'fic') is a broadly-defined fan labor term for stories about characters\nor settings written by fans of the original work, rather than by the original\ncreator. Works of fan fiction are rarely commissioned or authorized by the\noriginal work's owner, creator, or publisher; also, they are almost never\nprofessionally published. Because of this, many stories often contain a\ndisclaimer stating that the creator of the work owns none of the characters. Fan\nfiction, therefore, is defined by being both related to its subject's canonical\nfictional universe and simultaneously existing outside the canon of that\nuniverse. Most fan fiction writers assume that their work is read\nprimarily by other fans, and therefore tend to presume that their readers have\nknowledge of the canon universe (created by a professional writer) in which\ntheir works are based.\n\n\n\nMedia scholar Henry Jenkins explains the correlation between transmedia\nstorytelling and fan fiction:\n","linknr":653,"url":"Fan_fiction","recorded":1362669575,"links":44,"instances":["electronic","sexual","series","internet","fiction","literature","fan_fiction","law"],"pdf":["http://www.ftlpublications.com/bwebook.pdf","http://www.ftlpublications.com/bwebook.pdf"],"categories":["Fan fiction|"],"headings":["History","Categories and types","Story creation in the online era","Interactivity in the online era","Legality","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/42/Spockanalia2.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/24/Wikinews-logo.svg/40px-Wikinews-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["canon","fiction"],["alternative_universe","fan_fiction"],["trope","literature"],["alternative_universe","fan_fiction"],["kink","sexual"],["flaming","internet"],["spam","electronic"],["transformation","law"],["twilight","series"],["canon","fiction"]],"members":["spam","kink","twilight","flaming","canon","trope","alternative_universe","transformation"],"related":["Fan_labor","Disclaimer","Canon_(fiction)","Fictional_universe","Henry_Jenkins","Transmedia_storytelling","Charlotte_Bronte","Arthur_Wellesley,_1st_Duke_of_Wellington","Arthur_Wellesley,_2nd_Duke_of_Wellington","Lord_Charles_Wellesley","The_Young_Men's_Magazine","British_Library","Lewis_Carroll","Frances_Hodgson_Burnett","E._Nesbit","Arthur_Conan_Doyle","Science_fiction_fandom","Amateur","Science_fiction","Science_fiction_fanzine","Trekkie","Mimeograph","Science_fiction_conventions","Usenet_group","Electronic_mailing_lists","FanFiction.Net","LiveJournal","Blog","Mailing_list","Electronic_mailing_lists","Amateur_press_associations","Cross-post","Japanese_literature","Self-published","Manga","Dōjin","Manga","Anime","Video_game","Mangaka","Shotaro_Ishinomori","Fujiko_Fujio","Comiket","Romance_fiction","Mary_Sue","Alternative_universe_(fan_fiction)","Harry_Potter","Hermione_Granger","Ron_Weasley","Slash_fiction","Femslash","Heterosexual","Kirk/Spock","Harry_Potter_fandom","Genre","Fictional_crossover","Angst","Trope_(literature)","Alternative_universe_(fan_fiction)","Hurt-comfort","Mary_Sue","Star_Trek","Kink_(sexual)","Fictional_crossover","Harry_Potter","Lord_of_the_Rings","Star_Wars","LiveJournal","Fanfiction.net","Drabble","MPAA","Beta_reader","E-mail","Private_message","Feedback","Anonymity","Constructive_criticism","Flaming_(Internet)","Spam_(electronic)","Internet_troll","Web_forum","LiveJournal","Blog","Affinity_spaces","Informal_learning","Derivative_work","United_States_copyright_law","United_States_District_Court","Holden_Caulfield","Organization_for_Transformative_Works","Fair_use","Transformation_(law)","Lucasfilm","List_of_Star_Wars_characters","Pornography","J.K._Rowling","Stephenie_Meyer","Twilight_(series)","Fifty_Shades_of_Grey","Edward_Cullen","Bella_Swan","Anne_Rice","Anne_McCaffrey","Raymond_Feist","FanFiction.Net","George_R.R._Martin","Canon_(fiction)","Collaborative_fiction","Cthulhu_Mythos","Dōjin","Dōjinshi","Fandom","FanFiction.Net","Fiction","Legal_issues_with_fan_fiction","Media_fandom","Wold_Newton_family","Karen_Joy_Fowler","University_of_Southampton"]}
