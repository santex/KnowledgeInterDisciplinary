To qualify as an alcoholic tincture, the extract should have an\nethanol percentage of at least 40-60% or 80-120 proof. Sometimes even a 90% or\n180 proof tincture is achieved. Groot Handboek\nGeneeskrachtige Planten by Geert Verhelst In herbal medicine, alcoholic\ntinctures are made with various concentrations of ethanol, 25% being the most\ncommon. Other concentrations include 45% and 90%.\n\nHerbal tinctures are not always made using ethanol as the solvent, though this\nis most commonly the case. Other solvents include vinegar, glycerol, ether and\npropylene glycol, not all of which can be used for internal consumption. Ethanol\nhas the advantage of being an excellent solvent for both acidic and basic\n(alkaline) constituents. Glycerine can also be used, but when used in\ntincturing fashion is generally a poorer solvent. Vinegar, being acidic, is a\nbetter solvent for obtaining alkaloids but a poorer solvent for acidic\ncomponents. For individuals who chose not to imbibe alcohol, non-alcoholic e,g.,\n(glycerite) extracts offer an alternative for preparations meant to be taken\ninternally.\n\nAlcohol cannot be subjected to high temperatures, so its use is considered a self-\nlimiting 'non-critical' passive methodology. Glycerol, utilized in a non-\ncritical fashion as it was in early Eclectic medicine studies, is typically seen\nas inferior to alcohol, whereas if glycerol is subjected to an innovative\nsynchronous serialized methodology now being acknowledged in the industry, the\nextractive potential of glycerol use this way is quite astounding and far\nexceeds the weak extractive potential for a tincturing methodology. Therefore,\nnewer glycerite products are showing great promise and even rivaling alcoholic\ntinctures in many ways. {{fix |link=Wikipedia:Citation needed\n|text=citation needed |class=noprint Template-Fact |title=This claim needs\nreferences to reliable sources }}\n\nSome solutions of volatile or nonvolatile substances are traditionally called\nspirits, regardless of whether obtained by distillation or not and whether or\nnot they even contain alcohol. In chemistry, a 'tincture' is a solution that has\nalcohol as its solvent.\n","linknr":355,"url":"Tincture","recorded":1362544381,"links":37,"instances":["tincture","chemistry","biochemistry","alcohol"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Drug delivery devices","Dosage forms"],"headings":["General method of preparation","Examples of tinctures","Advantages of tinctures","Disadvantages of tinctures","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/da/Whitewillowtincture.jpg/170px-Whitewillowtincture.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/FlattenedRoundPills.jpg/58px-FlattenedRoundPills.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/Hexaaquatitanium%28III%29-solution.jpg/58px-Hexaaquatitanium%28III%29-solution.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/Inhaler.jpg/58px-Inhaler.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/Glycerin_suppositories.jpg/58px-Glycerin_suppositories.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/SPF15SunBlock.JPG/58px-SPF15SunBlock.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/Injection_Syringe_01.jpg/58px-Injection_Syringe_01.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/84/Nuvola_apps_filetypes_red.svg/52px-Nuvola_apps_filetypes_red.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["volatility","chemistry"],["everclear","alcohol"],["green_dragon","tincture"],["iron(iii_chloride"],["denaturation","biochemistry"]],"members":["green_dragon","volatility","denaturation","everclear"],"related":["Extract","Solution","Volatility_(chemistry)","Iodine","Mercurochrome","Ethanol","Alcohol_proof","Vinegar","Glycerol","Ether","Propylene_glycol","Glycerite","Eclectic_medicine","Spirit","Distillation","Chemistry","Solution","Alcohol","Solvent","Ethanol","Everclear_(alcohol)","Ethanol","Cannabis_sativa","Tincture_of_Benzoin","Tincture_of_cannabis","Green_dragon_(tincture)","Cantharidin","Castoreum","Chelate","Citric_acid","Iron(III)_chloride","Soap","Lavender","Guaiacum","Tincture_of_iodine","Opium","Laudanum","Camphor","Paregoric","Pennyroyal","Warburg's_Tincture","Antipyretic","Ammonia","Spirits_of_hartshorn","Camphor","Diethyl_ether","Ammonium_acetate","Nitre","Nitric_acid","Ethyl_nitrite","Hydrochloric_acid","Vinegar","Acetic_acid","Vitriol","Sulfuric_acid","Wine","Methanol","Destructive_distillation","Wood","Calendula_officinalis","Denaturation_(biochemistry)","Antimicrobial","Polysaccharide","Protein","Propylene_glycol","Nalewka","Poland","Infusion","Elixir","Ethanol","Extract","Topical"]}
