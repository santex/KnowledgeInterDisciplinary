Sources\nsuggest an array of music teachers who may have taught him in his early years.\nAccording to the writings of Samuel Hartlib, composer and violinist Johann Schop\nwas one of those instructors. Baltzar may have studied the violin with Gregor\nZuber and composition with Franz Tunder. He may have also received instruction\nfrom composer and violinist Nicolaus Bleyer, who taught Baltzar's younger\nbrother.

Retrieved on May 31, 2008.\n\nThrough contacts at Germany's embassy in Sweden (where, by 1653, Baltzar was\nemployed), he may have come in contact with English musicians accompanying\nBulstrode Whitelocke's mission to Queen Christina. This possible encounter may\nhave been the impetus for Baltzar's decision to emigrate to England in 1655,\nleaving behind his newly attained position of Ratslutenist of LÃ¼beck (he had\nreturned briefly to his home city, probably shortly after Christina's abdication\nin June 1654). Hartlib's writings indicate that the Swedish ambassador to\nEngland, Christer Bonde, took in Baltzar.\n\nBaltzar's arrival in England was met with acclaim. On March 4, 1656, he\nperformed the violin at the residence of Roger L'Estrange, where John Evelyn was\nin attendance. Evelyn wrote in his [[John Evelyn's Diary|Diary]] that night:\n\n This night I was invited by Mr. Rog: L'Estrange to the incomperable\nLubicer on the Violin, his variety upon a few notes & plaine ground with that\ndexterity, as was admirable, & though a very young man, yet so perfect &\nskillful as there was nothing so crosse & perplext, which being by our Artists,\nbrought to him, which he did not at first sight, with ravishing sweetenesse &\nimprovements, play off, to the astonishment of our best Masters: In Summ, he\nplaid on that single Instrument a full Consort, so as the rest, flung-downe\ntheir Instruments, as acknowledging a victory. \n\nIn September 1656, Baltzar was listed as one of the musicians who helped\npremiere [[The Siege of Rhodes]] in London, thought to have\nbeen the first all-sung English opera.

Two years later, according to\nAnthony Wood, he was employed as a private musician for Sir Anthony Cope at\nHanwell House in Banbury. Wood, who had heard Baltzar play at\na performance in Oxford, described his \"very great astonishment\" at the German's\nskill. \"[I] saw him run his fingers to the end of the finger-\nboard of the violin, and run them back insensibly,\" he wrote, \"and all with\nalacrity and in very good tune, which [I] nor any in England saw the like\nbefore.\" Also in attendance was John Wilson, a professor of\nmusic at the University of Oxford, who, according to Wood, bowed at Baltzar's\nfeet after the performance.\n\nOn December 23, 1661, Baltzar entered Charles II's service as a member of the\nking's private music ensemble with an annual salary of Â£110, a high figure for\nthe time. Some of Baltzar's surviving compositions, including\na work in C major that may be the earliest suite for three violins, require virtuosity and technical mastery. According to Wood,\nBaltzar's drinking habits contributed to his death. He was buried in the\ncloisters of Westminster Abbey on July 27, 1663.\n","linknr":170,"url":"Thomas_Baltzar","recorded":1375059354,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Thomas_Baltzar&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Thomas_Baltzar&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Free_City_of_L%C3%BCbeck","/wiki/Holy_Roman_Empire","/wiki/Kingdom_of_England","/wiki/Music_genre","/wiki/Baroque_music","/wiki/Circa","/wiki/Germany","/wiki/Violin","/wiki/L%C3%BCbeck","#cite_note-Grove-1","/wiki/Samuel_Hartlib","/wiki/Johann_Schop","/w/index.php?title=Gregor_Zuber&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Musical_composition","/wiki/Franz_Tunder","/w/index.php?title=Nicolaus_Bleyer&action=edit&redlink=1","#cite_note-DNB-2","/wiki/Bulstrode_Whitelocke","/wiki/Christina_of_Sweden","/w/index.php?title=Christer_Bonde&action=edit&redlink=1","#cite_note-DNB-2","/wiki/Roger_L%27Estrange","/wiki/John_Evelyn","/wiki/John_Evelyn%27s_Diary","#cite_note-DNB-2","/wiki/The_Siege_of_Rhodes","/wiki/London","#cite_note-Grove-1","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Anthony_Wood","/w/index.php?title=Hanwell_House&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Banbury","#cite_note-Grove-1","/wiki/Oxford","#cite_note-DNB-2","/wiki/Fingerboard","#cite_note-DNB-2","/wiki/John_Wilson_(composer)","/wiki/University_of_Oxford","#cite_note-DNB-2","/wiki/Charles_II_of_England","/wiki/Pound_sterling","#cite_note-Grove-1","/wiki/C_(musical_note)","/wiki/Major_scale","/wiki/Suite_(music)","#cite_note-Grove-1","/wiki/Cloisters","/wiki/Westminster_Abbey","#cite_note-DNB-2","/w/index.php?title=Thomas_Baltzar&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-Grove_1-0","#cite_ref-Grove_1-1","#cite_ref-Grove_1-2","#cite_ref-Grove_1-3","#cite_ref-Grove_1-4","http://www.grovemusic.com","#cite_ref-DNB_2-0","#cite_ref-DNB_2-1","#cite_ref-DNB_2-2","#cite_ref-DNB_2-3","#cite_ref-DNB_2-4","#cite_ref-DNB_2-5","#cite_ref-DNB_2-6","http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/1253","/wiki/Oxford_Dictionary_of_National_Biography","/wiki/Oxford_University_Press","#cite_ref-3","http://www.grovemusic.com","/w/index.php?title=Thomas_Baltzar&action=edit&section=2","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/38px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png","/wiki/Wikisource","/wiki/Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica_Eleventh_Edition","//en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Baltzar,_Thomas","http://www.allmusic.com/artist/p43567","/wiki/AllMusic","http://imslp.org/wiki/Category:Baltzar,_Thomas","/wiki/International_Music_Score_Library_Project","http://www.mutopiaproject.org/cgibin/make-table.cgi?Composer=BaltzarT","/wiki/Mutopia_Project","/wiki/Authority_control","http://www.worldcat.org/identities/lccn-n87-113471","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/48273725","/wiki/Library_of_Congress_Control_Number","http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n87113471","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","/wiki/Free_City_of_L%C3%BCbeck","/wiki/Holy_Roman_Empire","/wiki/Kingdom_of_England","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Thomas_Baltzar&oldid=541205258","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1630s_births","/wiki/Category:1663_deaths","/wiki/Category:German_classical_violinists","/wiki/Category:German_composers","/wiki/Category:Baroque_composers","/wiki/Category:People_from_L%C3%BCbeck","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_hCards","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_LCCN_identifiers","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Thomas+Baltzar&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Thomas+Baltzar","/wiki/Thomas_Baltzar","/wiki/Talk:Thomas_Baltzar","#","/wiki/Thomas_Baltzar","/w/index.php?title=Thomas_Baltzar&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Thomas_Baltzar&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Speci
