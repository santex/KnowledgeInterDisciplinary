Along with most European\nlanguages, it is a descendant of the ancient Proto-Indo-European language. It\noriginated in the Italian peninsula. Although it is considered a dead language,\nmany modern languages (the Romance languages) are in fact living continuations\nof this language. Additionally, many students, scholars, and some members of the\nRoman Catholic clergy speak it fluently, and it is still taught in some primary,\nsecondary and post-secondary educational institutions around the\nworld.<ref></ref><ref></ref>\n\nLatin is still used in the creation of new words in modern languages of many\ndifferent families, including English, and in biological taxonomy. Latin and\nits daughter Romance languages are the only surviving languages of the\nItalic language family. Other languages of the Italic branch were attested\nin the inscriptions of early Italy, but were assimilated to Latin during the\nRoman Republic.\n\nThe extensive use of elements from vernacular speech by the earliest authors and\ninscriptions of the Roman Republic make it clear that the original, unwritten\nlanguage of the Roman Monarchy was an only partially deducible colloquial form,\nthe predecessor to Vulgar Latin. By the arrival of the late Roman Republic, a\nstandard, literate form had arisen from the speech of the educated, now referred\nto as Classical Latin. Vulgar Latin, by contrast, is the name given to the more\nrapidly changing colloquial language, which was spoken throughout the\nempire.<ref></ref>\n\nBecause of the Roman conquest, Latin spread to many Mediterranean regions, and\nthe dialects spoken in these areas, mixed to various degrees with the\nautochthonous languages, developed into the modern Romance tongues.<ref></ref>\nClassical Latin slowly changed with the Decline of the Roman Empire, as\neducation and wealth became ever scarcer. The consequent Medieval Latin,\ninfluenced by various Germanic and proto-Romance languages until expurgated by\nRenaissance scholars, was used as the language of international communication,\nscholarship, and science until well into the 18th century, when it began to be\nsupplanted by vernacular languages.\n\nLatin is a highly inflected language, with three distinct genders, seven noun\ncases, four verb conjugations, six tenses, three persons, three moods, two\nvoices, two aspects, and two numbers. A dual number (\"a pair of\") is present in\nArchaic Latin. One of the rarer of the seven cases is the locative, only marked\nin proper place names and a few common nouns. Otherwise, the locative function\n(\"place where\") has merged with the ablative. The vocative, a case of direct\naddress, is marked by an ending only in words of the second declension.\nOtherwise, the vocative has merged with the nominative, except that the particle\nO typically precedes any vocative, marked or not. There are only five fully\nproductive cases, that is, in the few instances of the formation of a distinct\nlocative or vocative, the endings are specific to those words and cannot be\nplaced on other stems of the declension to produce a locative or vocative. In\ncontrast, the plural nominative ending of the first declension may be used to\nform any first declension plural.\n\nAs a result of this case ambiguity, different authors list different numbers of\ncases: 5, 6, or 7. Adjectives and adverbs are compared, and the former are\ninflected according to case, gender, and number. In view of the fact that\nadjectives are often used for nouns, the two are termed substantives. Although\nClassical Latin has demonstrative pronouns indicating different degrees of\nproximity (\"this one here\", \"that one there\"), it does not have articles. Later\nRomance language articles developed from the demonstrative pronouns, e.g. le and\nla (French) from ille and illa, and su and sa (Sardinian) from ipse and ipsa.\n","title":"latin","headings":["Legacy","History of Latin","Phonology","Orthography","Grammar","Vocabulary","Example text","Phrases<ref>Ebbe Vilborg - ''Norstedts svensk-latinska ordbok'' -
