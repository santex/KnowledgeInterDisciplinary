{"cursor":"24587","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Region' is most commonly found as a term used in terrestrial and astrophysics\nsciences also an area, notably among the different sub-disciplines of geography,\nstudied by regional geographers. Regions consist of subregions that contain\nclusters of like areas that are distinctive by their uniformity of description\nbased on a range of statistical data, for example demographic, and locales. In\nastrophysics some regions have science-specific terms such as galactic clusters.\n\nIn Geography, regions can be broadly divided by physical characteristics\n(physical geography), human impact characteristics (human geography), and the\ninteraction of Humanity and the environment (environmental geography).\nGeographic regions and subregions are mostly described by their imprecisely\ndefined, and sometimes transitory boundaries, except in human geography where\njurisdiction areas such as national borders are clearly defined in law.\n\nApart from the global continental regions, there are also hydrospheric and\natmospheric regions that cover the oceans, and discrete climates above the\nland and water masses of the planet. The land and water global regions are\ndivided into subregions geographically bounded by large geological features\nthat influence large-scale ecologies, such as plains and steppes, forested\nmassifs, deserts, or mountainous regions. Subregions describe the areas within\nregions that are easily distinguished in both the geological and ecological\nobservable features.\n\nAs a way of describing spatial areas, the concept of regions is important and\nwidely used among the many branches of geography, each of which can describe\nareas in regional terms. For example, ecoregion is a term used in environmental\ngeography, cultural region in cultural geography, bioregion in biogeography, and\nso on. The field of geography that studies regions themselves is called regional\ngeography.\n\nIn the fields of physical geography, ecology, biogeography, zoogeography, and\nenvironmental geography, regions tend to be based on natural features such as\necosystems or biotopes, biomes, drainage basins, natural regions, mountain\nranges, soil types. Where human geography is concerned, the regions and\nsubregions are described by the discipline of ethnography.\n\nA region has its own nature that could not be moved. The first nature is its\nnatural environment (landform, climate, etc.). The second nature is its physical\nelements complex that were built by people in the past. The third nature is its\nsocio-cultural context that could not be replaced by new immigrants.\n","linknr":903,"url":"Region","recorded":1362374081,"links":98,"instances":["washington","country_subdivision","lds_church","demographics","california","area","lcms","warfare","mormonism"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Geography","Geography
