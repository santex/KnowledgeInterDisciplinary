Other closely related tetrazolium dyes including XTT,\nMTS and the WSTs, are used in conjunction with the intermediate electron\nacceptor, 1-methoxy PMS.

Biotechnology Annual Review, 11: 127-\n152 (2005) These assays measure cellular metabolic activity via NAD(P)H-\ndependent cellular oxidoreductase enzymes and may, under defined conditions,\nreflect the number of viable cells (cell proliferation). Tetrazolium dye assays\ncan also be used to measure cytotoxicity (loss of viable cells) or cytostatic\nactivity (shift from proliferative to resting status) of potential medicinal\nagents and toxic materials\n","linknr":164,"url":"MTT_assay","recorded":1362481326,"links":22,"instances":["journal","chemical_method"],"pdf":["http://www.aniara.com/pdf/literature/XTTvsMTT.pdf","http://www.aniara.com/pdf/literature/XTTvsMTT.pdf","http://www.interchim.fr/ft/F/F98881.pdf","http://www.interchim.fr/ft/F/F98881.pdf"],"categories":["Biochemistry methods"],"headings":["MTT and related tetrazolium salts","MTT Assays significance","References","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/MTT_Plate.jpg/200px-MTT_Plate.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/24/NewMTTscheme1.pdf/page1-400px-NewMTTscheme1.pdf.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["colorimetry","chemical_method"],["cytometry","journal"]],"members":["cytometry","colorimetry"],"related":["Colorimetry_(chemical_method)","Di-","Methyl","Thiazole","Phenyl","Tetrazole","Purple","Formazan","Journal_of_Immunological_Methods","Dimethyl_sulfoxide","Detergent","Sodium_dodecyl_sulfate","Hydrochloric_acid","Formazan","Absorbance","Wavelength","Spectrophotometer","ANIARA","Hydroxy_group","Sulfonate","Cancer_communications","Interchim","Oxford_University_Press","Cytometry_(journal)","Tetrazolium_chloride","Formazan"]}
