It can\n either indicate how \"tall\" something is, or how \"high up\" it is. For example\n \"The height of the building is 50 m\" or \"The height of the airplane is\n 10,000 m\". When used to describe how high something like an airplane or\n mountain peak is from sea level, height is more often called altitude.\n Height is measured along the vertical (y) axis between a specified point and\n another point.\n","linknr":179,"url":"height","recorded":1362564861,"links":49,"instances":["geometría","field_theory","triangle"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Length"],"headings":["Etymology","In mathematics","In geology","In geodesy","In aviation","In human culture","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/Height_demonstration_diagram.png/200px-Height_demonstration_diagram.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["altitude","triangle"],["minimal_polynomial","field_theory"],["altura","geometría"]],"members":["altura","minimal_polynomial","altitude"],"related":["Length","Width","Distance","Airplane","Mountain","Sea_level","Altitude","PIE","Dimension","Length","Width","Altitude_(triangle)","Circular_segment","Circular_segment","Height_function","Minimal_polynomial_(field_theory)","Algebraic_number","Commutative_algebra","Representation_theory","Sea_level","Elevation","Mount_Everest","Nepal","Tibet","China","Mauna_Kea","Hawaii","United_States","Human_height","Anthropometry","Genetics","United_Nations","Statistics","Nutrition","Developing_nation","Health_care_system","CGS_unit","Chinese_unit","Imperial_unit","International_System_of_Units","U.S._customary_units","Human_height","Acrophobia","Altura_(geometría)"]}
