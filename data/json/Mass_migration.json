Mass migration is distinguished from individual or\nsmall scale migration; it is also different from seasonal migration, which\noccurs on a regular basis.\n\nA specific mass migration that is seen as especially influential to the course\nof history may be referred to as a 'great migration'. Examples of great\nmigrations include the Barbarian Invasions during the Roman Empire, the Great\nMigration from England of the 1630s, the California Gold Rush from\n1848–1850, and the Great Migration of African Americans from the rural\nAmerican south to the industrial north during 1920–1950.\n\nHistorians often identify an 'age of mass migration', occurring from c. 1850 to\n1914 (sometimes 1940), in which long distance migration occurred at an\nunprecedented and exceptionally high rate. There were three factors that led to\nthe 'age of mass migration'. First, cost of migration decreased dramatically.\nSecond, benefits of migration rise (returns on migration was higher in the US\nthan in other countries). Third, open border regime. 'Age of mass migration'\nusually refers to the voluntary transatlantic migration of European peasants and\nlabourers to the Americas. Immigration from Europe accounted for about 40% of\ntotal U.S. population growth in late 19th century. However, it has been argued\nthat the term should include other mass migrations that occurred in the same\nperiod, since similar large numbers of people migrated long distances within the\ncontinent of Asia, most notably during the Pakistan Movement. During open border\nregime, immigrants attracted by falling costs of migration and higher wages in\nthe U.S. Migrant selection varies over time and across sending country,\ndepending on relative wage premium in U.S. for high/low skilled and cost of\nmigration. In late 20th century, migrants converge upon native-born in labor\nmarket but never fully catch up. [http://www.beyondbooks.com/wcu91/3k.asp\n3k.

Similarly, mass migrations may take\nplace in the form of deportation; for example, Japanese internment in the United\nStates and imprisonment in Nazi concentration camps during World War II,\ndeportations to Gulag camps in the Soviet Union, and coolie-labour in Southeast\nAsia and the Caribbean.\n","linknr":115,"url":"Mass_migration","recorded":1374546752,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Mass_migration&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Mass_migration&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Human_migration","/wiki/File:Chinese_Emigration_to_America.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7b/Chinese_Emigration_to_America.jpg/250px-Chinese_Emigration_to_America.jpg","/wiki/File:Chinese_Emigration_to_America.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf8/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Chinese_immigration_to_the_United_States","/wiki/San_Francisco","/wiki/Human_migration","/wiki/Seasonal_human_migration","/wiki/Great_Migration_(disambiguation)","/wiki/Migrations_period","/wiki/Roman_Empire","/wiki/Great_Migration_(Puritan)","/wiki/California_Gold_Rush","/wiki/Great_Migration_(African_American)","/wiki/Transatlantic_migrations","/wiki/Europe","/wiki/Peasants","/wiki/Americas","/wiki/Asia","/wiki/Pakistan_Movement","#cite_note-1","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Forced_migration","/wiki/Atlantic_slave_trade","/wiki/Book_of_Exodus","/wiki/Purohits","/wiki/Deportation","/wiki/Japanese_internment_in_the_United_States","/wiki/Nazi_concentration_camps","/wiki/World_War_II","/wiki/Gulag","/wiki/Soviet_Union","/wiki/Coolie","/wiki/Southeast_Asia","/wiki/Caribbean","/w/index.php?title=Mass_migration&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Human_migration","/wiki/Great_Migration_(disambiguation)","/wiki/Gold_rush","/wiki/Silver_rush","/wiki/Transatlantic_migrations","/wiki/Urbanization_in_China","/w/index.php?title=Mass_migration&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-1","http://www.beyondbooks.com/wcu91/3k.asp","#cite_ref-2","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mass_migration&oldid=543682606","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Human_migration","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Mass+migration&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Mass+migration","/wiki/Mass_migration","/wiki/Talk:Mass_migration","#","/wiki/Mass_migration","/w/index.php?title=Mass_migration&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Mass_migration&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Mass_migration","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Mass_migration","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Mass_migration&oldid=543682606","/w/index.php?title=Mass_migration&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6784066","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Mass_migration&id=543682606","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Mass+migration","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Mass+migration&oldid=543682606&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Mass_migration&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6784066#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_migration","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":["disambiguation"],"pdf":[],"cat
