{"cursor":"27444","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nA 'bearing' is a machine element that constrains relative motion between moving\nparts to only the desired motion. The design of the bearing may, for example,\nprovide for free linear movement of the moving part or for free rotation around\na fixed axis; or, it may prevent a motion by controlling the vectors of normal\nforces that bear on the moving parts. Bearings are classified broadly according\nto the type of operation, the motions allowed, or to the directions of the loads\n(forces) applied to the parts.\n\nThe term \"bearing\" is derived from the verb \"\"; a bearing being a machine element that allows one part\nto bear (i.e., to support) another. The simplest bearings are bearing surfaces,\ncut or formed into a part, with varying degrees of control over the form, size,\nroughness and location of the surface. Other bearings are separate devices\ninstalled into a machine or machine part. The most sophisticated bearings for\nthe most demanding applications are very precise devices; their manufacture\nrequires some of the highest standards of current technology.\n","linknr":371,"url":"Bearing_(mechanical)","recorded":1362566080,"links":64,"instances":["units","cyclist","bearing","lubricant","metal","mathematics_and_physics","geometry"],"pdf":["http://www.bwc.com/pdf/news/1737_MSD_BIWI_eprint_.pdf","http://www.bwc.com/pdf/news/1737_MSD_BIWI_eprint_.pdf"],"categories":["Bearings|","Tribology"],"headings":["History","Common","Principles of operation","Motions","Friction","Loads","Speeds","Play","Stiffness","Service life","Maintenance and lubrication","Types","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/16/Ball_Bearing2.jpg/220px-Ball_Bearing2.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7c/Tapered_steering_head_bearings.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a0/%D0%A8%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%B4%D1%88%D0%B8%D0%BF%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%B8.jpg/200px-%D0%A8%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%B4%D1%88%D0%B8%D0%BF%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%B8.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/26/Early_Timken_roller_bearing.jpg/220px-Early_Timken_roller_bearing.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/30/BallBearing.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["line","geometry"],["vector","mathematics_and_physics"],["james_moore","cyclist"],["babbitt","metal"],["newton","units"],["grease","lubricant"],["race","bearing"]],"members":["newton","james_moore","race","grease","babbitt","vector","line"],"related":["Machine_element","Moving_parts","Line_(geometry)","Rotation_around_a_fixed_axis","Vector_(mathematics_and_physics)","Normal_force","Bearing_surface","Surface_roughness","Accuracy_and_precision","High_tech","Wheel","Tree_trunk","Egyptian_pyramid_construction_techniques","Hand_drill","Ball_bearing","Roman_Republic","Nemi_ships","Lake_Nemi","Italy","Leonardo_da_Vinci","Ball_bearing","Agostino_Ramelli","Ball_bearing","Galileo_Galilei","Philip_Vaughan","Carmarthen","Wheel_and_axle","Wood","Bronze","Ceramic","Sapphire","Glass","Steel","Bronze","Nylon","Polyoxymethylene","Polytetrafluoroethylene","UHMWPE","Horology","John_Harrison","Patent","Ball_bearing","Jules_Suriray","James_Moore_(cyclist)","Paris-Rouen","Friedrich_Fischer","Schaeffler_Group","Ball_bearing","Sven_Wingquist","SKF","Henry_Timken","Erich_Franke","Wire_race_bearing","Gerhard_Heydrich","Aerospace_bearings","Plain_bearing","Lubricant","Bearing_surface","Babbitt_(metal)","Plain_bearing","Journal_bearing","Rolling-element_bearing","Jewel_bearing","Fluid_bearing","Magnetic_bearing","Magnetic_field","Flexure_bearing","Roller_bearing","Thrust_bearing","Bending_moment","Newton_(units)","False_brinelling","Normal_distribution","John_Harrison","Shaft_voltage","Grease_(lubricant)","Internal_combustion_engines","Stiffness","Plain_bearing","Stiction","Rolling_element_bearing","Jewel_bearing","Fluid_bearing","Magnetic_bearings","Electromagnet","Eddy_current","Electromagnet","Electrodynamic_bearing","Flexure_bearing","Friction","Ball_spline","Ball_bearing","Hertz_contact_stress","Hinge","Main_bearing","Needle_roller_bearing","Spiral_groove_bearing","Pillow_block_bearing","Race_(bearing)","Rolamite","Scrollerwheel","Shock_Pulse_Method","Slewing_bearing","Spherical_bearing"]}
