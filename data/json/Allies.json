When the\nterm is used in the context of war or armed struggle, such associations may also\nbe called 'allied powers', especially when discussing World War I or World\nWar II.\n\nA formal military alliance is not required for being perceived as an allyâco-\nbelligerence, fighting alongside someone, is enough. According to this usage,\nallies become so not when concluding an alliance treaty but when struck by war.\n\nWhen spelled with a capital \"A\", the word \"Allies\" usually denotes the countries\nwho fought together against the Central Powers in World War I (the Allies\nof World War I), or those who fought against the Axis Powers in World\nWar II (the Allies of World War II). The term has also been used by\nthe United States Army to describe the countries that gave assistance to the\nSouth Vietnam during the Vietnam War. \n\nMore recently, the term \"Allied forces\" has also been used to describe the\nCoalition of the Gulf War, as opposed to forces the Multi-National Force in Iraq\nwhich are commonly referred to as \"Coalition forces\" or, as by the George W.\nBush administration, \"The coalition of the willing\".\n\nThe Allies in World War I (also known as the Entente Powers) were initially\nthe British Empire, France, Russia, Belgium, Serbia, Montenegro, and Japan,\njoined later by Italy, Portugal, Romania, the United States, Greece, and Brazil.\nSome, such as Russia, withdrew from the war before the Armistice due to\nrevolution or defeat by the Central Powers.\n","linknr":153,"url":"Allies","recorded":1362566980,"links":32,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Diplomacy","Military alliances|*"],"headings":["See also","Notes and references","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/Childe_Hassam_-_Allies_Day.jpg/220px-Childe_Hassam_-_Allies_Day.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/07/Allies_at_the_Brandenburg_Gate%2C_1945.jpg/220px-Allies_at_the_Brandenburg_Gate%2C_1945.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/Icon_vojn.svg/30px-Icon_vojn.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["English_language","War","World_War&nbsp;I","World_War&nbsp;II","Military_alliance","Co-belligerence","Central_Powers","Allies_of_World_War&nbsp;I","Axis_powers_of_World_War_II","Allies_of_World_War&nbsp;II","United_States_Army","South_Vietnam","Vietnam_War","Coalition_of_the_Gulf_War","Multi-National_Force_–_Iraq","George_W._Bush","Coalition_of_the_willing","Allies_of_World_War_I","Allies_of_World_War_II"]}
