The Den was adjacent to New Cross Stadium, a\nlarge athletics stadium which later hosted Greyhound racing and Motorcycle\nspeedway as well as being used by Millwall for training, as Millwall were\nlacking a training pitch of their own at the time.\n","linknr":218,"url":"The_Den_(defunct_stadium)","recorded":1362904180,"links":20,"instances":["footballer","united_kingdom","football","soccer","sport"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Millwall F.C.","Defunct football venues in England","Sports venues completed in 1910"],"headings":["History","The Millwall Roar","Quotes","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9d/TheOldDen1988.jpg/250px-TheOldDen1988.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg/16px-Portal-puzzle.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/16px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["football","soccer"],["ministry_of_works","united_kingdom"],["floodlights","sport"],["12th_man","football"],["george_graham","footballer"]],"members":["george_graham","ministry_of_works","12th_man","football","floodlights"],"related":["New_Cross","London","England","Archibald_Leitch","Millwall_F.C.","Football_(soccer)","Millwall_F.C.","New_Cross","London","Millwall","Isle_of_Dogs","The_New_Den","Derby_County_F.C.","New_Cross_Stadium","Greyhound_racing","Motorcycle_speedway","North_Greenwich,_Isle_of_Dogs","Isle_Of_Dogs","Archibald_Leitch","Knightsbridge","Brighton_&_Hove_Albion_F.C.","Southern_Football_League","Champions","Arthur_Kinnaird,_11th_Lord_Kinnaird","The_FA","Scottish_Gaelic_Language","East_End_of_London","River_Thames","Greenwich_foot_tunnel","Rotherhithe_Tunnel","Surrey_Docks","The_Football_League","Bristol_Rovers_F.C.","Surrey_Commercial_Docks","The_Blitz","Nazi_Germany","Charlton_Athletic_F.C.","Crystal_Palace_F.C.","West_Ham_United_F.C.","Great_Britain","Ministry_of_Works_(United_Kingdom)","Archibald_Leitch","Manchester_United","Floodlights_(sport)","Benny_Fenton","Gold","The_Football_Association","England_national_football_team","Welsh_national_football_team","England_B","Yugoslavia_B","Football_League","Bristol_Rovers_F.C.","1992-93_in_English_football","Football_League_First_Division","Football_hooliganism","The_New_Den","New_Cross_Gate_station","Bermondsey","Etiquette","12th_man_(football)","Football_Association","Eamon_Dunphy","Francis_Lee","Bolton_Wanderers_F.C.","Harry_Cripps","Leicester_City_F.C.","FA_Cup","Gary_Lineker","Teddy_Sheringham","George_Graham_(footballer)","Mitcham","Surrey"]}
