{"cursor":"6663","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Hugh Le Caine' (May 27, 1914 â July 3, 1977) was a Canadian physicist,\ncomposer, and instrument builder.\n\nLe Caine was brought up in Port Arthur (now Thunder Bay) in northwestern\nOntario. After completing his Master of Science degree from Queen's University\nin 1939, Le Caine was awarded a National Research Council of Canada (NRC)\nfellowship to continue his work on atomic physics measuring devices at Queen's.\nHe worked with the NRC in Ottawa from 1940 to 1974. During World War II, he\nassisted in the development of the first radar systems. On an NRC grant he\nstudied nuclear physics from 1948 to 1952 in England.\n\nAt home he pursued a lifelong interest in electronic music and sound generation.\nIn 1937, Le Caine designed an electronic free reed organ, and in the mid-1940s,\nhe built the Electronic Sackbut, now recognised to be one of the first\nsynthesizers. After the success of public demonstrations of his instruments, he\nwas permitted to move his musical activities to the NRC and to work on them full-\ntime in 1954. Over the next twenty years, he built over twenty-two different new\ninstruments.\n\n\n at the Electronic Music Studio in Jerusalem (~1965).

But while Le Caine did get excellent responses from both the learned\nbodies and the public, he did not get a satisfactory response from industry.\nFortunately, a few people did eventually come into Le Caine's life to make him\nfeel his efforts were of some value. One of these people was Israeli composer\nJosef Tal. In the summer of 1958, Tal had travelled to Ottawa under a Unesco\ngrant to visit major electronic music studios. Tal grew very excited about the\ninstruments that Le Caine had built, but he did not realize what this meant to\nLe Caine until the next day while Le Caine, Tal, and several technicians were\nhaving lunch in a small restaurant. Tal noticed that, not only had Le Caine been\nrather silent on this day, but on close inspection at the table, Le Caine had\ntears running down his cheeks and falling silently into his soup. When an\nopportunity arose, Tal delicately asked one of the technicians about this and\nwas told that Le Caine had felt no composer in Canada had a use for his\ninstruments and that Tal was the first composer who had shown any interest in\nhis work.

Le Caine also\ncollaborated in the development of pioneering electronic music studios at the\nUniversity of Toronto in 1959 and at McGill University in 1964.\n\nHe was married to Trudi Le Caine, a notable supporter of the arts in Ottawa.\n\nThough his composition output was small, Le Caine is remembered as one of the\ngreat pioneer composers of [[musique concrÃ¨te]], his best known work being\nDripsody (1955), a piece of musique concrÃ¨te based on the sound of a single drop\nof water that is permuted and contorted into a multitude of sounds.\n","linknr":137,"url":"Hugh_Le_Caine","recorded":1374781558,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Hugh_Le_Caine&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Hugh_Le_Caine&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Canada","/wiki/Physicist","/wiki/Composer","/wiki/Port_Arthur,_Ontario","/wiki/Ontario","/wiki/Queen%27s_University,_Canada","/wiki/National_Research_Council_of_Canada","/wiki/Atomic_physics","/wiki/Ottawa","/wiki/World_War_II","/wiki/Radar","/wiki/Nuclear_physics","/wiki/Electronic_music","/wiki/Electronic_Sackbut","/wiki/Synthesizer","/wiki/File:Canadian_physicist_Hugh_Le_Caine.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/Canadian_physicist_Hugh_Le_Caine.jpg/220px-Canadian_physicist_Hugh_Le_Caine.jpg","/wiki/File:Canadian_physicist_Hugh_Le_Caine.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf8/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/File:Josef_Tal_at_the_Electronic_Music_Studio.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/76/Josef_Tal_at_the_Electronic_Music_Studio.jpg/200px-Josef_Tal_at_the_Electronic_Music_Studio.jpg","/wiki/File:Josef_Tal_at_the_Electronic_Music_Studio.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf8/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Josef_Tal","/wiki/Electronic_Music","/wiki/Jerusalem","/wiki/Synthesizer","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Josef_Tal","#cite_note-2","/wiki/University_of_Toronto","/wiki/McGill_University","/wiki/Trudi_Le_Caine","/wiki/Musique_concr%C3%A8te","#Notes","#Additional_reading","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Hugh_Le_Caine&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","http://cec.sonus.ca/econtact/Histories/EaMusicCanada.htm","#cite_ref-2","/w/index.php?title=Hugh_Le_Caine&action=edit&section=2","http://www.scribd.com/doc/83482078/EMR4","/w/index.php?title=Hugh_Le_Caine&action=edit&section=3","http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=U1ARTU0002014","http://www.hughlecaine.com","/w/index.php?title=Hugh_Le_Caine&action=edit&section=4","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Hugh_Le_Caine","http://www.hughlecaine.com","http://db.archives.queensu.ca/dbtw-wpd/exec/dbtwpub.dll?AC=GET_RECORD&XC=/dbtw-wpd/exec/dbtwpub.dll&BU=http%3A%2F%2Fdb.archives.queensu.ca%2Fdbtw-wpd%2Ffondsdb%2Fquery-fonds.html&TN=fonds&SN=AUTO9230&SE=1511&RN=1&MR=20&TR=0&TX=1000&ES=0&CS=2&XP=&RF=Fonds+Results&EF=&DF=HTML+-+Fonds+Display&RL=1&EL=1&DL=1&NP=3&ID=&MF=&MQ=&TI=0&DT=&ST=0&IR=23811&NR=0&NB=0&SV=0&BG=ffffff&FG=000080&QS=query&OEX=ISO-8859-1&OEH=ISO-8859-1","http://archives.queensu.ca/","http://www.audionautas.com/2011/02/hugh-le-caine-el-visionario-sonoro-i.html","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/45101435","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hugh_Le_Caine&oldid=543936141","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1914_births","/wiki/Category:1977_deaths","/wiki/Category:Canadian_composers","/wiki/Category:Canadian_electronic_musicians","/wiki/Category:Canadian_physicists","/wiki/Category:Canadian_nuclear_physicists","/wiki/Category:Musicians_from_Ontario","/wiki/Category:Electroacoustic_music_composers","/wiki/Category:People_from_Thunder_Bay","/wiki/Category:Commons_category_with_local_link_same_as_on_Wikidata","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Hugh+Le+Caine&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Hugh+Le+Caine","/wiki/Hugh_Le_Caine","/wiki/Talk:Hugh_Le_Caine","#","/wiki/Hugh_Le_Caine","/w/index.php?title=Hugh_Le_Caine&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Hugh_Le_Caine&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_p
