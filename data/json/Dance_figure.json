They are\nusually isolated, defined, and organized so that beginning dancers can learn and\nuse them independently of each other. Dance moves tend to emphasize the concepts\nof lead and follow and connection. In most cases dance moves by themselves are\nindependent of musicality, which is the appropriateness of a move to the music\n(for a notable exception, see Bharatanatyam). Generally, they are memorized in\nsets of eight counts. Also there are two different movements which is concreate\nand abstract movement. These two movement shows time, space, relationship,\nquality and focus. If I give you an example relationship could be movement of\ntwo different dancers or more. The names of moves may be somewhat arbitrary and\nvary from person to person and city to city. For example, in Lindy Hop, circles\nare also called \"rhythm circles\" and \"reverses\".\n\nDance moves may blur into each other. For example, the Lindy Hop move [[swing\nout (dance move)|swing out]] from close can also be thought of as a [[groucho\n(dance move)|groucho]] to open.\n\nEach dance emphasizes its own moves, but often moves are shared by\nseveral dances.\n","linknr":186,"url":"Dance_figure","recorded":1362371290,"links":19,"instances":["dance","dance_move","dance"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Dance moves"],"headings":["See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3a/Ballerina-icon.jpg/30px-Ballerina-icon.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["lead_and_follow","dance"],["connection","dance"],["circle","dance_move"]],"members":["connection","circle","lead_and_follow"],"related":["Lead_and_follow_(dance)","Connection_(dance)","Musicality","Bharatanatyam","Lindy_Hop","Circle_(dance_move)","Glossary_of_dance_moves","Glossary_of_ballet","Signature_move"]}
