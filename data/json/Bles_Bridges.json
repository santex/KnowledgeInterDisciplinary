{"cursor":"4170","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Bles Bridges' (22 July 1947, Viljoensdrif, Free State) â€“ 24 March 2000),\nborn 'Lawrence John Gabriel Bridges', was a much-loved South African singer. He\nbecame known as Bles Bridges, as his Irish grandfather called him Bles (i.e.\nbald), due to his very thin hair from an early age.\n\nHe released his first album in 1982, Onbekende Weermagman (Unknown Soldier). His\nprofessional career began in 1984, with the release of his second album,\n[[Bles]], which went gold in under a month (25,000 copies) and included Maggie,\none of his better-known songs. The album had sold twice that by the time his\nthird album was released. At the time of his death, Bles had sold more than two\nand a half million albums (records and CDs).\n\nSoon Bles Bridges began alternating between Afrikaans and English language\nalbums, to great acclaim. He also began working with Eurovision South Africa. In\n2000, he began recording an album with his friends in the music industry. The\nfirst song - a duet with Patricia Lewis (and his last song as it turned out, as\nhe died within a week of finishing it) - was \"The First Kiss Goodnight\" by\nDennis East; it was recorded on 21 March 2000.\n\nIn the 1980s he held a concert in support of the AWB Volkshulpskema (People's\nHelp Scheme) that raised 10,000 Rand (he was there as an artist, and by\npersonal belief).\n\nHe had cancer during the 1980s and gave generously to charity for cancer\nresearch after his recovery.\n\nHis wife Leonie was his sound engineer and the composer and/or songwriter of\nmost of his songs, including most of his biggest hits, including \"Maggie\" and \"I\nam the Eagle, you're the Wind\", among others.\n\nHis biggest hit was \"Ruiter van die Windjie\" (Rider of the Wind), which was\nreleased in 1986.\n\nHe loved life and roses, and it was his custom to hand out roses to some of the\nfemale audience members in the front row at his concerts.\n\nHis career highlight was when he performed to a soldout \"Superbowl\" at Sun City,\nfive times on one weekend, becoming the first and only artist to do so, as\nfeature artist on 14 and 15 May 1987. He actually managed to draw a bigger crowd\nthan Frank Sinatra did when he opened the Superbowl in 1982.\n\nBles died in a motorcar accident on 24 March 2000, leaving behind his wife,\nLeonie, and children Sunette and Victor. More than 15,000 mourners turned up for\nhis funeral.\n","linknr":101,"url":"Bles_Bridges","recorded":1375056023,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Bles_Bridges&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Bles_Bridges&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bles_Bridges&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/Viljoensdrif","/wiki/Free_State_(South_African_province)","/wiki/South_African","/w/index.php?title=Bles&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Afrikaans","/wiki/English_language","/w/index.php?title=Eurovision_South_Africa&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Dennis_East&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Leonie","/w/index.php?title=Ruiter_van_die_Windjie&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Sun_City,_North_West","/wiki/Frank_Sinatra","/w/index.php?title=Bles_Bridges&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Bles_Bridges&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=Bles_Bridges&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bles_Bridges&oldid=548674709","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1947_births","/wiki/Category:2000_deaths","/wiki/Category:People_from_Fezile_Dabi_District_Municipality","/wiki/Category:South_African_male_singers","/wiki/Category:White_South_African_people","/wiki/Category:South_African_pop_singers","/wiki/Category:Articles_lacking_sources_from_October_2008","/wiki/Category:All_articles_lacking_sources","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Bles+Bridges&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Bles+Bridges","/wiki/Bles_Bridges","/wiki/Talk:Bles_Bridges","#","/wiki/Bles_Bridges","/w/index.php?title=Bles_Bridges&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Bles_Bridges&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Bles_Bridges","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Bles_Bridges","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Bles_Bridges&oldid=548674709","/w/index.php?title=Bles_Bridges&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3643103","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Bles_Bridges&id=548674709","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Bles+Bridges","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Bles+Bridges&oldid=548674709&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Bles_Bridges&printable=yes","//af.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bles_Bridges","//ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/%EB%B8%94%EB%A0%88%EC%8A%A4_%EB%B8%8C%EB%A6%BF%EC%A7%80","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3643103#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bles_Bridges","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":["south_african_prov
