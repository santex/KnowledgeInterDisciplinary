It often contains\na DNA insert, which contains the gene sequence encoding a protein of interest,\nthat has been subcloned into a vector, which contains bacterial resistance\ngenes for growth in bacteria, and promoters for expression in the organism. A\nDNA construct may express wildtype protein, prevent the expression of certain\ngenes by expressing competitors or inhibitors, or express mutant proteins,\nsuch as deletion mutations or missense mutations. A DNA construct is often\nused in molecular biology to analyze macromolecules such as proteins or RNA in\nmore detail.\n","linknr":101,"url":"DNA_construct","recorded":1362676284,"links":16,"instances":["biology","biology","molecular_biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["DNA"],"headings":["See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/AlphaHelixSection.svg/40px-AlphaHelixSection.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cell","biology"],["vector","molecular_biology"],["promoter","biology"]],"members":["promoter","cell","vector"],"related":["Nucleic_acid","Biological_tissue","Cell_(biology)","DNA","Gene","Protein","Vector_(molecular_biology)","Bacteria","Promoter_(biology)","Missense_mutation","Molecular_biology","RNA","Rescue_construct","Disruption_construct"]}
