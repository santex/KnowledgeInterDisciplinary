This is the case with the oldest learned\nsocieties, such as the Polish Sodalitas Litterarum Vistulana (founded 1488), the\nItalian Accademia dei Lincei (founded 1603), the AcadÃ©mie FranÃ§aise (founded\n1635), the German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina (founded 1652) or the Royal\nSociety of London (founded 1660).\n\nMost learned societies are non-profit organizations. Their activities typically\ninclude holding regular conferences for the presentation and discussion of new\nresearch results and publishing or sponsoring academic journals in their\ndiscipline. Some also act as professional bodies, regulating the activities of\ntheir members in the public interest or the collective interest of the\nmembership.\n\nLearned societies are of key importance in the sociology of science, and their\nformation assists in the emergence and development of new disciplines or\nprofessions.\n\nSocieties can be very general in nature, such as the American Association for\nthe Advancement of Science, specific to a given discipline, such as the Modern\nLanguage Association, or specific to a given area of study, such as the Royal\nEntomological Society.\n\nMost are either specific to a particular country (though they generally include\nsome members from other countries as well), often with local branches, or are\ninternational, such as the International Federation of Library Associations\n(IFLA) or the Regional Studies Association, in which case they often have\nnational branches. But many are local, such as the Massachusetts Medical\nSociety, the publishers of the internationally known [[New England Journal of\nMedicine]].\n\nSome learned societies (such as the Royal Society of New Zealand) have been\nrechartered by legislation to form quasi-autonomous non-governmental\norganizations.\n","recorded":1362124294,"portal":[],"list":[],"links":"74","instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Learned societies|","Types of organization","Clubs and societies","Members of learned societies"],"headings":["Membership","See also","References","External links"],"tags":[["http://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/akademi","s%c3%a4llskap"]],"image":["http://en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","http://bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","http://bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"related":["Organization","Academic_discipline","Poland","Sodalitas_Litterarum_Vistulana","Accademia_dei_Lincei","Académie_Française","German_Academy_of_Sciences_Leopoldina","Royal_Society","Non-profit_organization","Academic_conference","Academic_journal","Professional_bodies","Sociology_of_science","American_Association_for_the_Advancement_of_Science","Modern_Language_Association","Royal_Entomological_Society_of_London","International_Federation_of_Library_Associations","Regional_Studies_Association","Massachusetts_Medical_Society","Royal_Society_of_New_Zealand","Quango","Post-nominal_letters","Academic_conference","List_of_learned_societies","National_academy","Professional_association","Text_publication_societies"],"members":[],"book":[]}
