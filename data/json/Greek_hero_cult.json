In Homeric Greek, \"hero\" (heroes, ) refers to a man\n who was fighting on either side during the Trojan War. By the historical\n period, however, the word came to mean specifically a dead man, venerated and\n propitiated at his tomb or at a designated shrine, because his fame during life\n or unusual manner of death gave him power to support and protect the living. A\n hero was more than human but less than a god, and various kinds of supernatural\n figures came to be assimilated to the class of heroes; the distinction between\n a hero and a god was less than certain, especially in the case of Heracles, the\n most prominent, but a typical hero. Robert Parker, in John Boardman,Jasper\n Griffin and Oswyn Murray, eds. Greece and the Hellenistic World (Oxford 1988)\n \"Greek religion\" p. 288; Parker gives a concise and clear synopsis of\n hero.\n\nThe grand ruins and tumuli remaining from the Bronze Age gave the pre-literate\nGreeks of the 10th and 9th centuries BC a sense of a grand and vanished age that\nwas reflected in the oral epic tradition, which would be crystallized in the\n[[Iliad]]. Copious renewed offerings begin to be represented, after a hiatus, at\nsites like Lefkandi, Carla Maria Antonaccio, An Archaeology of Ancestors:\nTomb Cult and Hero Cult in Early Greece (1995) and \"Lefkandi and Homer\", in O.\nAnderson and M. Dickie, Homer's World: Fiction, Tradition and Reality (1995); I.\nMorris, \"Tomb cult and the Greek Renaissance\" Antiquity '62' (1988:750-\n61). even though the names of the grandly buried dead were hardly\nremembered. \"Stories began to be told to individuate the persons who were now\nbelieved to be buried in these old and imposing sites,\" observes Robin Lane\nFox.
