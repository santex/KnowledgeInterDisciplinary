They are\nfrequently drawn into the clandestine world of the secret service through the\nmachinations of security chief Dugdale (Thorley Walters) or Bulman's one-time\npolice boss Lambie (Mark McManus).\n","title":"bulman","headings":["External links"]},"micro-relation":["2: Kenneth_Royce","2: Don_Henderson","2: Siobhan_Redmond","1: Drama","1: Greater_Manchester","1: Granada_Television","1: ITV","1: Granada_TV","1: Thorley_Walters","1: Mark_McManus"]}
