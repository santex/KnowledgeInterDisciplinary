{"cursor":"52071","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\n\n'Catholicism' is a broad term for describing specific traditions in the\nChristian churches in theology and doctrine, liturgy, ethics and spirituality.\n\nFor many the term usually refers to Christians and churches, western and\neastern, in full communion with the Holy See, usually known as the Catholic\nChurch or the Roman Catholic Church. McBrien, Catholicism, 19-20.\nHowever, many others use the term to refer to other churches with historical\ncontinuity from the first millennium.\n\nIn the sense of indicating historical continuity of faith and practice, the term\n\"Catholicism\" is at times employed to mark a contrast to Protestantism, which\ntends to look solely to the Bible as interpreted on the principles of the 16th-\ncentury Protestant Reformation as its ultimate standard. The Oxford\nDictionary of the Christian Church (Oxford University Press 2005 ISBN 978-0-19-280290-\n3), article \"Catholic\", p. 308 It was thus used by the Oxford\nMovement.\n\nFor some, however, such as the priest and theologian Richard McBrien, the term\nrefers exclusively and specifically to that \"Communion of Catholic Churches\" in\ncommunion with the Bishop of Rome. Richard McBrien, The Church: The\nEvolution of Catholicism (New York: HarperOne, 2008), 6, 281-82, and 356.\nIn its Letter on Some Aspects of the Church Understood as Communion, the\nCongregation for the Doctrine of the Faith stressed that the idea of the\nuniversal church as a communion of churches must not be presented as meaning\nthat \"every particular Church is a subject complete in itself, and that the\nuniversal church is the result of a reciprocal recognition on the part of the\nparticular Churches\". It insisted that \"the universal Church cannot be conceived\nas the sum of the particular Churches, or as a federation of particular Churche-\ns\".

According to Orthodox leaders like Bishop Kallistos Ware,\nthe Orthodox Church has these things as well, though the primacy of the See of\nRome is only honorific, showing non-jurisdictional respect for the Bishop of\nRome as the \"first among equals\" and \"Patriarch of the West\". Timothy Ware,\nThe Orthodox Church (Oxford: Penguin Books, 1993), 214â217. Catholicism,\naccording to McBrien's paradigm, includes a monastic life, religious institutes,\na religious appreciation of the arts, a communal understanding of sin and\nredemption, and missionary activity. In his book, Catholicism, he notes (on\npage 19) that his book was \"written in the midst of yet another major crisis in\nthe history of the Roman Catholic Church....\" Never once does he indicate in his\nbook that Catholicism refers to churches not in communion with the See of Rome.\nMcBrien, 19â20.\n","linknr":1136,"url":"Catholic","recorded":1362669236,"links":102,"instances":["religion","canon_law","christian","roman_catholic","catholicism"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Catholicism|","Ecclesiology","Christian
