Teams are especially\nappropriate for conducting tasks that are high in complexity and have many\ninterdependent subtasks.\n\nA group in itself does not necessarily constitute a team. Teams normally have\nmembers with complementary skills and generate synergy through a coordinated\neffort which allows each member to maximize his/her strengths and minimize\nhis/her weaknesses. Team members need to learn how to help one another, help\nother team members realize their true potential, and create an environment that\nallows everyone to go beyond their limitations. Davis, Barbee. 97 Things\nEvery Project Manager Should Know: Collective Wisdom from the Experts. Beijing:\nO'Reilly, 2009. Print.\"Build teams to Run Marathons, Not Sprints\" By Nitin pg\n96 A team becomes more than just a collection of people when a strong\nsense of mutual commitment creates synergy, thus generating performance greater\nthan the sum of the performance of its individual members.\n\nThus teams of game players can form (and re-form) to practise their craft.\nTransport logistics executives can select teams of horses, dogs or oxen for the\npurpose of conveying goods.\n\nTheorists in business in the late 20th century popularised the concept of\nconstructing teams. Differing opinions exist on the efficacy of this new\nmanagement fad. Some see \"team\" as a four-letter word: overused and under-\nuseful. Others see it as a panacea that finally realizes the human relations\nmovement's desire to integrate what that movement perceives as best for workers\nand as best for managers. Still others believe in the effectiveness of teams,\nbut also see them as dangerous because of the potential for exploiting workers\n— in that team effectiveness can rely on peer pressure and peer\nsurveillance.\n\nCompare the more structured/skilled concept of a crew, and the advantages of\nformal and informal partnerships.\n","linknr":230,"url":"Team","recorded":1362543655,"links":43,"instances":["rugby","sociology","rugby","sport","game","mts"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Social groups"],"headings":["Team size, composition, and formation","Types of teams","Devine’s (2002) Team Categories and Subtypes","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/Team_work.jpg/300px-Team_work.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0b/Rugby_union_scrummage.jpg/220px-Rugby_union_scrummage.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["field_goal","rugby"],["scrum","rugby"],["coach","sport"],["group","sociology"],["player","game"],["driving","horse#teams"],["multiteam_system","mts"]],"members":["scrum","group","driving","field_goal","coach","player","multiteam_system"],"related":["Groups_of_people","Animal","Complexity","Game","Horse","Dog","Ox","Theorist","Business","Team_building","Management","Fad","Four-letter_word","Human_Relations_Movement","Management","Peer_pressure","Surveillance","Crew","Partnership","Meredith_Belbin","David_Cooperrider","System","Bruce_Tuckman","Forming-storming-norming-performing","Scrum","Concept","Sports","Rugby_football","Groups_of_people","Rugby_League_positions","Field_goal_(rugby)","Scrum_(rugby)","Success","Rugby_football","Rugby_football","Chess","Bowling","Students","Employees","Equations","Football","Define","Project","Sport","Coach_(sport)","Virtual_team","Virtual_team","Sales","Euphemistic","Organisations","Air-defense_experiments","Coalition","Community","Forming-storming-norming-performing","Group_(sociology)","Groups_of_people","Albert_S_Humphrey","Judge–advisor_system","Teamwork","Team_building","Player_(game)","Virtual_team","The_Five_Dysfunctions_of_a_Team","Team_Composition","Multiteam_System_(MTS)"]}
