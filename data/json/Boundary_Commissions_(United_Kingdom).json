There are four boundary commissions in the United Kingdom: one each\nfor England, Scotland, Wales (), and Northern Ireland.\n\nThere are four members of each Commission, of which three actually take part in\nmeetings. The Speaker of the House of Commons is the ex officio Chairman of each\nBoundary Commission, though he takes no part in the proceedings. The Deputy\nChairman of a Commission, who presides over Commission meetings, is always a\nJustice in a British
