) is a city in the federal state of Saxony, Germany. It has around 510,000\ninhabitants.<ref></ref> Leipzig is situated about 150&nbsp;km south of Berlin at\nthe confluence of the White Elster, Pleisse, and Parthe rivers at the southerly\nend of the North German Plain.\n\nLeipzig has been a trade city at least since the time of the Holy Roman\nEmpire,<ref name=\"city-tourist.de\"></ref> sitting at the intersection of the Via\nRegia and Via Imperii, two important Medieval trade routes. At one time, Leipzig\nwas one of the major European centers of learning and culture in fields such as\nmusic and publishing.<ref name=\"idehist.uu.se\">[http://www.idehist.uu.se/distans/ilmh/Ren/bokt-\nfrankfurt.htm ]</ref> After World War II, Leipzig became a major urban center\nwithin the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) but its cultural and\neconomic importance declined,<ref name=\"idehist.uu.se\"/> despite East Germany\nbeing the richest economy in the Soviet Bloc.<ref name=\"Econ stats\"></ref>\n\nLeipzig later played a significant role in instigating the fall of communism in\nEastern Europe, through events which took place in and around St. Nicholas\nChurch. Since the reunification of Germany, Leipzig has undergone significant\nchange with the restoration of some historical buildings, the demolition of\nothers, and the development of a modern transport infrastructure. Nowadays\nLeipzig is an economic center in Germany and has an opera house and one of the\nmost modern zoos in Europe.<ref></ref>\n\nIn 2010 Leipzig was ranked among the top 70 world's most livable cities by\nconsulting firm Mercer in their quality of life survey. Also in 2010, Leipzig\nwas included in the top 10 of cities to visit by the [[New York Times]],<ref\nname=\"nytimes_travel\"/> and ranked 39th globally out of 289 cities for\ninnovation in the 4th Innovation Cities Index published by Australian
