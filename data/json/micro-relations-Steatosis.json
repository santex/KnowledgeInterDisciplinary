{"cursor":"8538","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" demonstrating marked (macrovesicular) 'steatosis' in non-alcoholic fatty liver\n disease. Masson's trichrome stain.]]\n\n section of a mouse's liver showing severe 'steatosis'. The clear vacuoles\n contained lipid in life; however, histological fixation caused it to be\n dissolved and hence only empty/clear spaces are seen.]] In cellular pathology,\n 'steatosis' (also called fatty change, fatty degeneration or adipose\n degeneration) is the process describing the abnormal retention of lipids within\n a cell. It reflects an impairment of the normal processes of synthesis and\n elimination of triglyceride fat. Excess lipid accumulates in vesicles that\n displace the cytoplasm. When the vesicles are large enough to distort the\n nucleus, the condition is known as 'macrovesicular steatosis', otherwise the\n condition is known as 'microvesicular steatosis'. Whilst not particularly\n detrimental to the cell in mild cases, large accumulations can disrupt cell\n constituents, and in severe cases the cell may even burst.\n\nThe risk factors associated with steatosis are varied, and include diabetes\nmellitus, protein malnutrition,\nhypertension cell toxins, obesity, anoxia and sleep apnea. As the\nliver is the primary organ of lipid metabolism it is most often associated with\nsteatosis, however it may occur in any organ, commonly the kidneys, heart, and\nmuscle.\n","linknr":267,"url":"Steatosis","recorded":1362485122,"links":28,"instances":["biology","medical","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Pathology","Histopathology"],"headings":["Pathogenesis","Histology","Radiography","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/83/Non-alcoholic_fatty_liver_disease1.jpg/250px-Non-alcoholic_fatty_liver_disease1.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/19/Liver_steatosis_fatty_change.jpg/250px-Liver_steatosis_fatty_change.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Liversteatosis.png/220px-Liversteatosis.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cell","biology"],["vesicle","biology"],["hypoxia","medical"]],"members":["vesicle","hypoxia","cell"],"related":["Non-alcoholic_fatty_liver_disease","Masson's_trichrome_stain","Vacuole","Lipid","Cell_(biology)","Pathology","Lipid","Biosynthesis","Triglyceride","Vesicle_(biology)","Cytoplasm","Cell_nucleus","Diabetes_mellitus","Hypoxia_(medical)","Sleep_apnea","Lipid_metabolism","Alcoholism","Adipocyte","Ethanol","NADH","Fatty_acid","Fatty_acid","Tetracyclines","Reye’s_Syndrome","Hepatitis_D","Carbon_tetrachloride","Aspirin","Diphtheria_toxin","Gaucher's_disease","Lysosome","Glycolipid","Kwashiorkor","Apolipoprotein","Lipoprotein","Histology","Liposome","Parenchyma","Staining","Sudan_stain","Glycogen","X-ray_computed_tomography","Echogenicity","Intracellular_fat","Fatty_liver","Lipid_metabolism","Non-alcoholic_fatty_liver_disease","Visceral_fat","Fat_globules"]}
