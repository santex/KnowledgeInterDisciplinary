{"cursor":"8352","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nThe 'Great Seal of Scotland' (Seala MÃ²r na h-Alba in Gaelic) allows the monarch\nto authorise official documents without having to sign each document\nindividually. Wax is melted in a metal mould or matrix and impressed into a wax\nfigure that is attached by cord or ribbon to documents that the monarch wishes\nto make official. The earliest seal impression, in the Treasury of Durham\nCathedral, is believed to be the Great Seal of Duncan II and dates to 1094.\n\nThe Chancellor had the custody of the King's Seal. Refer to the list for years\nAD1057-1794, pp.78â82 in \"A political index to the histories of Great Britain\nand Ireland\" by Robert Beatson. http://archive.org/stream/apoliticalindex0-\n2beatgoog#page/n88/mode/2up\n\nStrictly, the Great Seal of Scotland was abolished by the Act of Union 1707\nwhich provided that \"a Seal in Scotland after the Union be alwayes kept and made\nuse of in all things relating to private Rights or Grants, which have usually\npassed the Great Seal of Scotland, and which only concern Offices, Grants,\nCommissions, and private Rights within that Kingdom\".\n\nAlthough referred to in the Scotland Act 1998 as \"the seal appointed by the\nTreaty of Union to be kept and made use of in place of the Great Seal of\nScotland\", the seal is still commonly referred to as the Great Seal of Scotland.\n\nSection 12 of the Treason Act 1708, still in force today, makes it treason in\nScotland to counterfeit the seal. [http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.asp-\nx?LegType=All+Legislation&Year=1708&searchEnacted=0&extentMatchOnly=0&confersPo-\nwer=0&blanketAmendment=0&sortAlpha=0&TYPE=QS&PageNumber=1&NavFrom=0&parentActiv-\neTextDocId=1516341&ActiveTextDocId=1516341&filesize=18797 UK Statute Law\nDatabase website]\n\nThe Design of the Great Seal is a responsibility of the Lord Lyon King of Arms.\nThe reverse of the seal shows the monarch on horseback, but is not changed from\nreign to reignâthe current version is that engraved in 1911 for the accession of\nKing George V. The obverse is inscribed \"ELIZABETH II D G BRITT REGNORVMQVE\nSVORVM CETER REGINA CONSORTIONIS POPULORUM PRINCEPS F D\" and the figure on it is\nthe same as on the Great Seal of the United Kingdom. The inscription is\nabbreviated Latin for \"Elizabeth II, by the Grace of God of the Britains and of\nHer Other Kingdoms Queen, Head of the Commonwealth of Nations, Defender of the\nFaith\". See Great Seal of the Realm.\n\nThe Great Seal is administered by the Keeper of the Great Seal, one of the Great\nOfficers of State. From 1885 this office was held by the Secretary for\nScotland, Secretary for Scotland Act 1885, section 8  later the\nSecretary of State for Scotland. It transferred in 1999 to the First Minister of\nScotland, Scotland Act 1998, section 45(7) whose place in the order of\nprecedence in Scotland is determined by his office as Keeper of the Great Seal.\nIn practice the Seal is in the custody of the Keeper of the Registers of\nScotland, who has been appointed as Deputy Keeper.\n","linknr":279,"url":"Great_Seal_of_Scotland","recorded":1375075886,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Great_Seal_of_Scotland&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Great_Seal_of_Scotland&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Scotland","/wiki/File:Flag_of_Scotland.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/10/Flag_of_Scotland.svg/175px-Flag_of_Scotland.svg.png","/wiki/Politics_of_Scotland","/wiki/Scottish_Government","/wiki/Government_of_the_4th_Scottish_Parliament#Second_Salmond_government","/wiki/First_Minister_of_Scotland","/wiki/Alex_Salmond","/wiki/Deputy_First_Minister_of_Scotland","/wiki/Nicola_Sturgeon","/wiki/Crown_Office_and_Procurator_Fiscal_Service","/wiki/Scottish_Government#Civil_Service","/wiki/Scottish_Government","/wiki/Executive_agencies_of_the_Scottish_Government","/wiki/Scottish_public_bodies","/wiki/Scottish_Parliament","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Scottish_Parliament_from_1999","/wiki/Scottish_Statutory_Instrument","/wiki/Presiding_Officer_of_the_Scottish_Parliament","/wiki/Tricia_Marwick","/wiki/Shadow_Cabinet_(Scottish_Parliament)","/wiki/Shadow_Cabinet_(Scottish_Parliament)","/wiki/Johann_Lamont","/wiki/Member_of_the_Scottish_Parliament","/wiki/Members_of_the_1st_Scottish_Parliament","/wiki/Members_of_the_2nd_Scottish_Parliament","/wiki/Members_of_the_3rd_Scottish_Parliament","/wiki/Members_of_the_4th_Scottish_Parliament","/wiki/Elections_in_Scotland#Scottish_Parliament","/wiki/Scottish_Parliament_election,_1999","/wiki/Scottish_Parliament_election,_2003","/wiki/Scottish_Parliament_election,_2007","/wiki/Scottish_Parliament_election,_2011","/wiki/Scottish_Parliament_constituencies_and_regions","/wiki/Legislative_Consent_Motion","/wiki/Scots_law","/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Supreme_Courts_of_Scotland","/wiki/Sheriff_Court","/wiki/Scottish_Land_Court","/wiki/Justice_of_the_Peace_Court","/wiki/Court_of_the_Lord_Lyon","/wiki/United_Kingdom","/wiki/Government_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Scotland_Office","/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_Scotland","/wiki/Michael_Moore_(UK_politician)","/wiki/Under-Secretary_of_State_for_Scotland","/wiki/David_Mundell","/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Scottish_Grand_Committee","/wiki/Scottish_Affairs_Committee","/wiki/Reserved_matters_(Westminster)","/wiki/Elections_in_Scotland","/wiki/Scottish_Westminster_constituencies","/wiki/List_of_MPs_for_constituencies_in_Scotland_2010%E2%80%93","/wiki/European_Union","/wiki/European_Parliament","/wiki/Elections_in_Scotland#European_Parliament","/wiki/Scotland_(European_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Subdivisions_of_Scotland","/wiki/Local_government_of_Scotland","/wiki/Convention_of_Scottish_Local_Authorities","/wiki/Outline_of_political_science#Politics_by_region","//commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Atlas_of_Scotland","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/Royal_Coat_of_Arms_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg/16px-Royal_Coat_of_Arms_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png","/wiki/Portal:British_politics","/wiki/Template:Politics_of_Scotland","/wiki/Template_talk:Politics_of_Scotland","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Politics_of_Scotland&action=edit","/wiki/Scottish_Gaelic","/wiki/Durham_Cathedral","/wiki/Duncan_II_of_Scotland","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Act_of_Union_1707","/wiki/Scotland_Act_1998","/wiki/Treason_Act_1708","/wiki/Treason","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Lord_Lyon_King_of_Arms","/wiki/George_V_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Great_Seal_of_the_Realm","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Great_Officers_of_State","/wiki/Secretary_for_Scotland","#cite_note-4","/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_Scotland","/wiki/First_Minister_of_Scotland","#cite_note-5","/wiki/Order_of_precedence_in_Scotland","#List_of_Keepers_of_the_Great_Seal_of_Scotland_prior_to_the_Union","#List_of_Keepers_of_the_Great_Seal_of_Scotland_since_the_Union","#Register","#Notes_and_references","/w/index.php?title=Great_Seal_of_Scotland&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Lists#Incomplete_lists","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Great_Seal_of_Scotland&action=edit","#cite_note-6","/w/index.php?title=Alexander_de_Cockburn&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/John_Laing_(bishop)","/wiki/Bishop_of_Glasgow","/wiki/Gavin_Douglas","/wiki/Bishop_of_Dunk
