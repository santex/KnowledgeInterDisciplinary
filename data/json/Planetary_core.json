The cores of\nMars and Venus may be completely solid as they lack an internally generated\nmagnetic field. {{cite encyclopedia |last=Luhmann |first=J.\nG |last2=Russell |first2=C.

Although these cores are proportionately\nmuch smaller than those of terrestrial planets, gas giants are so large that\ntheir cores can actually be larger than Earth. Jupiter's core is thought to be\napproximately 12 times the mass of Earth (3% of Jupiter's total mass), and the\nexoplanet HD 149026 b is thought to have a core approximately 70 times the\nmass of Earth.\n\nIt is thought that some gas giants orbiting very close to their primaries may\nhave their atmospheres stripped away, leaving only their core behind. This as-\nyet hypothetical class of planets are called \"Chthonian planets\".\n\nSome moons, asteroids and other minor planets may also have well-differentiated\ncores depending on their size and history. Jupiter's moons Io and Europa are in\nmany ways sisters of the terrestrial planets and have very substantial cores\ncomprising about a third of their radii. The large asteroid 4 Vesta is likewise\nbelieved to have a differentiated structure with a distinct core.\n","linknr":147,"url":"Planetary_core","recorded":1362268771,"links":36,"instances":["planet","moon","moon"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Planets","Planetary science"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/59/Terrestial_Planets_internal_en.jpg/400px-Terrestial_Planets_internal_en.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["mercury","planet"],["io","moon"],["europa","moon"]],"members":["mercury","europa","io"],"related":["Planet","Mars","Venus","Magnetic_field","Moon","Mercury_(planet)","Gas_giant","Jupiter","Extrasolar_planet","HD_149026_b","Chthonian_planet","Natural_satellite","Asteroid","Minor_planet","Io_(moon)","Europa_(moon)","4_Vesta"]}
