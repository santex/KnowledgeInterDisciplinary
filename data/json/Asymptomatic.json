The CT scan shows a pulmonary contusion (red arrow)\n accompanied by a rib fracture (blue arrow).]] In medicine, a disease is\n considered 'asymptomatic' if a patient is a carrier for a disease or infection\n but experiences no symptoms. A condition might be 'asymptomatic' if it fails to\n show the noticeable symptoms with which it is usually associated. Asymptomatic\n infections are also called subclinical infections. The term 'clinically silent'\n is also used.\n\nKnowing that a condition is asymptomatic is important because:\n* It may develop symptoms later and so require watch and wait or early\n  treatment.\n* It may resolve itself or become benign.\n* It is required that a person undergoes treatment so it does not cause later\n  medical problems such as high blood pressure and hyperlipidaemia.\n* Be alert to possible problems: asymptomatic hypothyroidism makes a person\n  vulnerable to Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome or beri-beri following intravenous\n  glucose.\n* The affected person may be infectious and unknowingly spread the infection\n  to others.\n","linknr":184,"url":"Asymptomatic","recorded":1362553918,"links":21,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Medical terminology","Symptoms","Diseases and disorders","Health"],"headings":["Conditions","List","References","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ea/Pulmonary_contusion_CT_arrow.jpg/250px-Pulmonary_contusion_CT_arrow.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["CT_scan","Rib_fracture","Medicine","Symptom","Subclinical_infection","Watch_and_wait","Benign","High_blood_pressure","Hyperlipidaemia","Hypothyroidism","Wernicke-Korsakoff_syndrome","Beri-beri","Intravenous","Subclinical_infection","X-ray","Cancer","Alkaptonuria","Aortic_valve_stenosis","Atrial_fibrillation","Balanitis_xerotica_obliterans","Benign_lymphoepithelial_lesion","Cardiac_shunt","Carotid_artery_dissection","Carotid_bruit","Cavernous_hemangioma","Chloroma","Chronic_myelogenous_leukemia","Coeliac_disease","Coronary_Artery_Disease","Diabetic_retinopathy","Fructosuria","Folliculosebaceous_cystic_hamartoma","Glioblastoma_multiforme","Glucocorticoid_remediable_aldosteronism","Glucose-6-phosphate_dehydrogenase_deficiency","Hereditary_elliptocytosis","Heterophoria","Hypertension","Histidinemia","Hyperaldosteronism","Hyperlipidaemia","Hyperprolinemia","Hypothyroidism","Hypertension","Idiopathic_thrombocytopenic_purpura","Iridodialysis","Lesch-Nyhan_syndrome","Levo-Transposition_of_the_great_arteries","Meckel's_diverticulum","Microvenular_hemangioma","Mitral_valve_prolapse","Monoclonal_B-cell_lymphocytosis","Myelolipoma","Optic_disc_pit","Osteoporosis","Pes_cavus","Polyorchidism","Pre-eclampsia","Prehypertension","Protrusio_acetabuli","Pulmonary_contusion","Renal_tubular_acidosis","Spermatocele","Sphenoid_wing_meningioma","Spider_angioma","Splenic_infarction","Subarachnoid_hemorrhage","Tonsillolith","Type_II_diabetes","Vaginal_intraepithelial_neoplasia","Wilson's_disease","Symptomatic","Subclinical_infection"]}
