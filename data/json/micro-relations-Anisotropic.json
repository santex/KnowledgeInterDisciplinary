{"cursor":"12760","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n image (2012) of the (extremely tiny) anisotropies in the cosmic background\n radiation. ]]\n 'Anisotropy' is the property of being directionally dependent, as opposed to\n isotropy, which implies identical properties in all directions. It can be\n defined as a difference, when measured along different axes, in a material's\n physical or mechanical properties (absorbance, refractive index, conductivity,\n tensile strength, etc.) An example of anisotropy is the light coming through a\n polarizer. An example of an anisotropic material is wood, which is easier to\n split along its grain than across its grain.\n","linknr":266,"url":"Anisotropic","recorded":1362375293,"links":42,"instances":["geometry","chemistry","crystalline","geology","physics","geology","waves","metalworking","physics"],"pdf":["http://www.waterlog.info/pdf/enerart.pdf","http://www.waterlog.info/pdf/wellspac.pdf"],"categories":["Orientation"],"headings":["Fields of interest","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3c/Ilc_9yr_moll4096.png/300px-Ilc_9yr_moll4096.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/26/Plasma-lamp_2.jpg/300px-Plasma-lamp_2.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["normal","geometry"],["filter","chemistry"],["polarization","waves"],["plasma","physics"],["plasma","physics"],["elasticity","physics"],["crust","geology"],["mantle","geology"],["texture","crystalline"],["stamping","metalworking"]],"members":["normal","filter","texture","crust","plasma","mantle","polarization","stamping","elasticity"],"related":["Cosmic_background_radiation","Isotropy","Polarizer","Wood","Wood_grain","Computer_graphics","Normal_(geometry)","Velvet","Anisotropic_filtering","Bilinear_filtering","Trilinear_filtering","Aliasing","Filter_(chemistry)","Proximal","Region","Distal","NMR_spectroscopy","Chemical_shift","Benzene","Fluorescence_spectroscopy","Fluorescence_anisotropy","Polarization_(waves)","Birefringence","Plasma_(physics)","Cosmologists","Cosmic_microwave_background_radiation","Big_Bang","Physicists","Magnetic_anisotropy","Plasma_(physics)","Lightning","Plasma_globe","Chloroform","Liquid_crystals","Heat_conduction","Electronics","Crystal","Light","Birefringence","Crystal_optics","Optical_axis","Seismic_anisotropy","Wavelength","Elasticity_(physics)","Crust_(geology)","Mantle_(geology)","Inner_core","Geological","Sedimentary","Electrical_conductivity","Oil_exploration","Hydrocarbon","Sand","Shale","Resistivity","Formation_evaluation","Hydraulic_conductivity","Aquifer","Drainage","Water_well","Mineral","Quartz","Feldspar","Optical_mineralogy","Garnet","Echogenicity","Young's_modulus","Cambridge","Texture_(crystalline)","Composite_material","Stamping_(metalworking)","Deep_reactive_ion_etching","Aspect_ratio","Microelectromechanical_systems","MEMS","Microfluidic","Silicon","Diffusion_tensor_imaging","Magnetic_resonance_imaging","Brownian_motion","White_matter"]}
