In the summer of\n1981 John Watts split up with his group, Fischer-Z, on the grounds that his art\ncould not evolve within the context of the band. Prompted by the encouragement\nof the well-received Fischer-Z album, [[Red Skies Over Paradise]], Watts soon\nembarked on a solo career, releasing his first solo album, One More Twist\n(1982), followed quickly by his second, The Iceberg Model (1983). Watts toured\nextensively and even produced a mini-album for Zulu artist Busi Mhlongo. He\nreleased an album entitled Quick Quick Slow under the name The Cry in 1984.\n\nAfter touring and releasing an album per year up until 1985 John Watts was\ntrying to resolve his role of constantly touring with that of being a father of\ntwo children. Over the ensuing years he started to develop and record new\nmaterial with multi-talented musician, Ian Porter. In 1987 John Watts began to\nrecord material under the Fischer-Z name again — but, with one twist\n— Watts was now the only original member of the group and it was his\n\"musical vision\". Original Fischer-Z keyboardist, Steve Skolnik, did however\nmake a minor contribution to the album.\n","linknr":106,"url":"Reveal_(Fischer-Z_album)","recorded":1362675767,"links":17,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["1987 albums","Fischer-Z albums","Arista Records albums"],"headings":["Track listing","Personnel","Notes","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/37/Reveal_Fischer-Z.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Star_full.svg/11px-Star_full.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Star_full.svg/11px-Star_full.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Star_empty.svg/11px-Star_empty.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Star_empty.svg/11px-Star_empty.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Star_empty.svg/11px-Star_empty.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Album","Fischer-Z","New_Wave_music","Allmusic","Fischer-Z","Zulu_people","Busi_Mhlongo"]}
