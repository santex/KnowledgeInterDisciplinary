He speculates that decompiculture could eventually\nbecome a new biological field that could have significant and important impacts\non both humans and termites.\n","linknr":90,"url":"Decompiculture","recorded":1362509391,"links":14,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.thebiopod.com/pdf/Decompiculture.pdf"],"categories":["Composting","Waste treatment technology","Biodegradable waste management"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/International_tidyman.svg/30px-International_tidyman.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Neologism","University_of_Toronto","Decomposition","Termite","Symbiosis","Landfill","Waste","Composting","Detoxification","Dangerous_goods","Biomass"]}
