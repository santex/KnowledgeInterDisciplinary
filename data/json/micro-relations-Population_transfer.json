{"cursor":"49271","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Population transfer' or 'Resettlement' is the movement of a large group of\npeople from one region to another, often a form of forced migration imposed by\nstate policy or international authority and most frequently on the basis of\nethnicity or religion. Banishment or exile is a similar process, but is forcibly\napplied to individuals and groups.\n\nOften the affected population is transferred by force to a distant region,\nperhaps not suited to their way of life, causing them substantial harm. In\naddition, the loss of all immovable property and, when rushed, the loss of\nsubstantial amounts of movable property, is implied. This transfer may be\nmotivated by the more powerful party's desire to make other uses of the land in\nquestion or, less often, by disastrous environmental or economic conditions that\nrequire relocation. In Europe, the last major population transfer was the\nexpulsion of ethnic Germans from central and eastern Europe after World War II.\n\n'Population exchange' is the transfer of two populations in opposite directions\nat about the same time. Such exchanges have taken place several times in the\n20th century, such as during the partition of India and Pakistan and between post-\nOttoman Turkey and Greece.\n","linknr":666,"url":"Population_transfer","recorded":1362477127,"links":34,"instances":["province","country","classification_of_human_beings","19th_century"],"pdf":["http://www.unm.edu/~phooper/thesis_condensed.pdf","http://www.unm.edu/~phooper/thesis_condensed.pdf"],"categories":["Forced
