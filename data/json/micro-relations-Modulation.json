This is done in a similar fashion to a musician modulating a tone\n(a periodic waveform) from a musical instrument by varying its volume, timing\nand pitch. The three key parameters of a periodic waveform are its amplitude\n(\"volume\"), its phase (\"timing\") and its frequency (\"pitch\"). Any of these\nproperties can be modified in accordance with a low frequency signal to obtain\nthe modulated signal. Typically a high-frequency sinusoid waveform is used as\ncarrier signal, but a square wave pulse train may also be used.\n\nIn telecommunications, modulation is the process of conveying a message signal,\nfor example a digital bit stream or an analog audio signal, inside another\nsignal that can be physically transmitted. Modulation of a sine waveform is used\nto transform a baseband message signal into a passband signal, for example low-\nfrequency audio signal into a radio-frequency signal (RF signal). In radio\ncommunications, cable TV systems or the public switched telephone network for\ninstance, electrical signals can only be transferred over a limited passband\nfrequency spectrum, with specific (non-zero) lower and upper cutoff frequencies.\nModulating a sine-wave carrier makes it possible to keep the frequency content\nof the transferred signal as close as possible to the centre frequency\n(typically the carrier frequency) of the passband.\n\nA device that performs modulation is known as a modulator and a device that\nperforms the inverse operation of modulation is known as a demodulator\n(sometimes detector or demod). A device that can do both operations is a modem\n(from \"'mo'dulatorâ'dem'odulator\").\n\nThe aim of 'digital modulation' is to transfer a digital bit stream over an\nanalog bandpass channel, for example over the public switched telephone network\n(where a bandpass filter limits the frequency range to between 300 and\n3400 Hz), or over a limited radio frequency band.\n\nThe aim of 'analog modulation' is to transfer an analog baseband (or lowpass)\nsignal, for example an audio signal or TV signal, over an analog bandpass\nchannel at a different frequency, for example over a limited radio frequency\nband or a cable TV network channel.\n\nAnalog and digital modulation facilitate frequency division multiplexing (FDM),\nwhere several low pass information signals are transferred simultaneously over\nthe same shared physical medium, using separate passband channels (several\ndifferent carrier frequencies).\n\nThe aim of 'digital baseband modulation' methods, also known as line coding, is\nto transfer a digital bit stream over a baseband channel, typically a non-\nfiltered copper wire such as a serial bus or a wired local area network.\n\nThe aim of 'pulse modulation' methods is to transfer a narrowband analog signal,\nfor example a phone call over a wideband baseband channel or, in some of the\nschemes, as a bit stream over another digital transmission system.\n\nIn music synthesizers, modulation may be used to synthesise waveforms with an\nextensive overtone spectrum using a small number of oscillators. In this case\nthe carrier frequency is typically in the same order or much lower than the\nmodulating waveform. See for example frequency modulation synthesis or ring\nmodulation synthesis.\n","linknr":925,"url":"Modulation","recorded":1362668719,"links":74,"instances":["signal_processing","waves","music","music","communications","telecommunications"],"pdf":[],"categories":["History
