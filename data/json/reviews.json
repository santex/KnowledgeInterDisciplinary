composition (music review of a\ncomposition or recording), book (book review); a piece of hardware like a car,\nhome appliance, or computer; or an event or performance, such as a live music\nconcert, play, musical theater show, or dance show. In addition to a critical\nevaluation, the review's author may assign the work a rating to indicate its\nrelative merit. More loosely, an author may review current events, trends, or\nitems in the news. A compilation of reviews may itself be called a review. [[The\nNew York Review of Books]], for instance, is a collection of essays on\nliterature, culture, and current affairs. [[National Review]], founded by\nWilliam F. Buckley, Jr., is an influential conservative magazine, and [[Monthly\nReview]] is a long-running socialist periodical.\n\nIn the scientific literature, review articles are a category of scientific\npaper, which provides a synthesis of research on a topic at that moment in time.\nA compilation of these reviews forms the core content of a 'secondary'\nscientific journal, with examples including Annual Reviews, the Nature Reviews\nseries of journals and Trends. A [[peer review]] is the process by which\nscientists assess the work of their colleagues that has been submitted for\npublication in the scientific literature. A [[software review]] is also a form\nof peer review, by the co-workers.\n\nA consumer review refers to a review written by the owner of a product or the\nuser of a service who has sufficient experience to comment on reliability and\nwhether or not the product or service delivers on its promises, otherwise known\nas product reviews. Product reviews can be done either individually, or as a\ncomparison to similar products.<ref></ref> An expert review usually refers to a\nreview written by someone who has tested several peer products or services to\nidentify which offers the best value for money or the best set of features. A\nbought review is the system where the creator (usually a company) of a new\nproduct pays a reviewer to review his new product.\n","title":"Review","headings":["Book review","Music reviews","Bought review","See also","References"]},"micro-relation":["3: Book_review","1: Film","1: Film_criticism","1: Video_game","1: Musical_composition","1: Book","1: Car","1: Home_appliance","1: Computer","1: Content_rating","1: William_F._Buckley,_Jr.","1: Conservatism","1: Socialist","1: Scientific_literature","1: Review_article","1: Scientific_paper","1: Scientific_journal","1: Essay","1: Non-fiction","1: Puff_piece","1: Peacock_words","1: Weasel_words","1: Music_critic","1: Music_criticism","1: Music_journalism","1: Review_site","1: TestFreaks"]}
