It is a graphic representation of a\ndemand schedule. The demand curve for all\nconsumers together follows from the demand curve of every individual consumer:\nthe individual demands at each price are added together.\n\nDemand curves are used to estimate behaviors in competitive markets, and are\noften combined with supply curves to estimate the equilibrium price (the price\nat which sellers together are willing to sell the same amount as buyers together\nare willing to buy, also known as market clearing price) and the equilibrium\nquantity (the amount of that good or service that will be produced and bought\nwithout surplus/excess supply or shortage/excess demand) of that market. Krugman, Paul, and Wells, Robin. Microeconomics. Worth\nPublishers, New York. 2005. In a monopolistic market, the demand curve\nfacing the monopolist is simply the market demand curve.\n","linknr":236,"url":"Demand_curve","recorded":1362684016,"links":29,"instances":["economics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Economics curves","Demand"],"headings":["Characteristics","Linear demand curve","Shift of a demand curve","Movement along a demand curve","Discreteness of amounts","Units of measurement","Price elasticity of demand (PED)","Taxes and subsidies","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/Supply-and-demand.svg/220px-Supply-and-demand.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["demand","economics"]],"members":["demand"],"related":["Economics","Graph_of_a_function","Commodity","Perfect_competition","Supply_curve","Equilibrium_price","Market_clearing","Inverse_demand_function","Veblen_good","Giffen_good","Law_of_demand","Marginal_utility","Utility","Substitute_good","Complementary_good","Income","Normal_goods","Inferior_goods","Disposable/Discretionary_income","Short-run","Stocks_and_flows","Demand_(economics)","Feasibility_condition","Supply_and_demand","Effect_of_taxes_and_subsidies_on_price","Price_point","Inverse_demand_function"]}
