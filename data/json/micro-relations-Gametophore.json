{"cursor":"1401","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'']] The word 'gametophore', also known as gametangiophore, is composed of\ngametangium and \"phore\" (Greek Î¦Î¿ÏÎ¬, \"to be\ncarried\"). [http://www.mobot.org/MOBOT/tropicos/most/Glossary/glosefr.html\nBryological Glossary] In moss and fern (Archegoniata) the gametophore is\nthe bearer of the sex organs (gametangia), the female archegonia and the male\nantheridia. [[Ralf Reski]] (1998): Development ,\ngenetics and molecular biology of mosses. Botanica Acta 111, 1-15. If the\narchegonia as well as the antheridia are arranged at the same plant, they are\ncalled monoecious. If there are female and male plants they are called\ndioecious.\n\nIn Bryopsida the leafy moss plant (q. v. \"Thallus\") is called gametophore. It is\nthe adult form of the haploid gametophyte and develops from the juvenile form,\nthe protonema, under the influence of phytohormones (mainly cytokinins). Whereas the protonema grows by apical cell division,\nthe gametophore grows by division of three faced apical cells.\n","linknr":109,"url":"Gametophore","recorded":1362668345,"links":16,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Plant morphology"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/10/Physcomitrella_patens_Gametophor.JPG/220px-Physcomitrella_patens_Gametophor.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8d/Fern.jpg/35px-Fern.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Gametangium","Moss","Fern","Gametangia","Archegonia","Antheridia","Monoecious","Dioecious","Bryopsida","Thallus","Haploid","Gametophyte","Protonema","Phytohormones","Cytokinins","Apical_dominance"]}
