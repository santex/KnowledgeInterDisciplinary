{"cursor":"10516","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Small nuclear ribonucleic acid' (snRNA), also commonly referred to as U-RNA, is\na class of small RNA molecules that are found within the nucleus of eukaryotic\ncells. The length of the an average snRNA is approximately 150 nucleotides. They\nare transcribed by either RNA polymerase II or RNA polymerase III, and studies\nhave shown that their primary function is in the processing of pre-mRNA (hnRNA)\nin the nucleus. They have also been shown to aide in the regulation of\ntranscription factors (7SK RNA) or RNA polymerase II (B2 RNA), and maintaining\nthe telomeres.\n\nsnRNA are always associated with a set of specific proteins, and the complexes\nare referred to as small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNP) often pronounced\n\"snurps\". Each snRNP particle is composed of several Sm proteins, the snRNA\ncomponent, and snRNP specific proteins. The most common snRNA components of\nthese complexes are known, respectively, as: U1 snRNA, U2 snRNA, U4 snRNA, U5\nsnRNA, and U6 snRNA. Their nomenclature derives from their high uridine content.\n\nsnRNAs were discovered by accident during a gel electrophoresis experiment in\n1966. An unexpected type of RNA was found in the gel and investigated. Later\nanalysis has shown that these RNA were high in uridylate and were established in\nthe nucleus.\n\nA large group of snRNAs are known as small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs). These are\nsmall RNA molecules that play an essential role in RNA biogenesis and guide\nchemical modifications of ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) and other RNA genes (tRNA and\nsnRNAs). They are located in the nucleolus and the Cajal bodies of eukaryotic\ncells (the major sites of RNA synthesis), where they are called scaRNAs (small\nCajal body-specific RNAs).\n","linknr":251,"url":"SnRNA","recorded":1362374267,"links":27,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["RNA","Molecular genetics","Non-coding RNA","Telomeres"],"headings":["Classes of snRNA","snRNA in the spliceosome","U1 snRNA","snRNPs and human disease","References","See also","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2b/Minor_spliceosome.jpg/175px-Minor_spliceosome.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/RF00003.jpg/150px-RF00003.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Eukaryotic","RNA_polymerase_II","RNA_polymerase_III","HnRNA","Transcription_factors","7SK_RNA","Telomere","SnRNP","U1_snRNA","U2_snRNA","U4_snRNA","U5_snRNA","U6_snRNA","Uridine","Gel_electrophoresis","SnoRNA","Biogenesis","Nucleolus","Cajal_body","Eukaryotic","Small_Cajal_body-specific_RNA","RNA_polymerase_II","Cell_nucleus","Survival_motor_neuron","Spliceosome","Introns","Histone","RNA_polymerase_III","Nucleotide","Pre-mRNA","HnRNA","Minor_spliceosome","Sequence_conservation","Gene_knockdown","HeLa","Polyadenylation","Motor_neurons","SnoRNP","Neuromuscular","Duchenne_muscular_dystrophy","Serotonin","MRNA","MicroRNA"]}
