{"cursor":"1297","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n'expand' is a program that converts tab characters into groups of space\ncharacters. It is available in Unix operating systems and many Unix-like\noperating systems.\n\nFor example:\n\n $ echo -e \"foo\\tbar\" | expand | xxd -g 1 -u 0000000: 66 6F 6F 20 20 20 20 20 62\n 61 72 0A foo bar. $ echo -e \"foo\\tbar\" | xxd -g 1 -u 0000000: 66 6F 6F 09 62 61\n 72 0A foo.bar. $\n\nHere the echo command prints a string of text that includes a tab character,\nthen the output is directed into the 'expand' command. The resulting output is\nthen displayed in hexadecimal and as characters by the 'xxd' dump command. At\nthe second prompt, the same echo output is sent directly to the xxd command. As\ncan be seen by comparing the two, the 'expand' program converts the tab\n(specified as '\\t' to the echo program) into spaces.\n","linknr":105,"url":"Expand_(Unix)","recorded":1362575810,"links":14,"instances":["computing","command","punctuation"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Standard Unix programs","Unix SUS2008 utilities"],"headings":["See also","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["character","computing"],["space","punctuation"],["echo","command"]],"members":["character","echo","space"],"related":["Character_(computing)","Space_(punctuation)","Unix","Operating_system","Unix-like","Echo_(command)","Hexadecimal","List_of_Unix_programs","Manpage"]}
