{"cursor":"2657","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Object manipulation' is a form of dexterity play or performance in which one or\nmore artists physically interact with one or more objects. These can be special\nprops made for the purpose of the manipulation itself - such as balls, clubs,\nhoops, rings, poi, staff, devil sticks, etc. - or any other object. In this case\nwe consider it as object manipulation when the object is taken out of its\nsocially acknowledged context and its original purpose.\n\nObject manipulators may also be practitioners of fire dancing, which is\nessentially object manipulation where specially designed props are soaked in\nfuel and lit on fire.\n","linknr":146,"url":"Object_manipulation","recorded":1362574556,"links":13,"instances":["illusion","illusion","flag_spinning","juggling","performance_art","knife"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Circus skills","Physical activity and dexterity toys","Sleight of hand","Motor control"],"headings":["Types of object manipulation","See also","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8f/5_ball_juggling.jpg/200px-5_ball_juggling.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/Summerblast3624.jpg/200px-Summerblast3624.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["poi","performance_art"],["cigar_box","juggling"],["poi","performance_art"],["color_guard","flag_spinning"],["magic","illusion"],["isolation","illusion"],["balisong","knife"]],"members":["isolation","magic","color_guard","cigar_box","poi","balisong"],"related":["Dexterity","Juggling_balls","Juggling_club","Hooping","Juggling_ring","Poi_(performance_art)","Devil_sticks","Fire_dancing","Fuel","Fire","Chinlone","Flair_bartending","Footbag","Cigar_box_(juggling)","Juggling","Contact_juggling","Toss_juggling","Dance","Club_swinging","Fire_staff","Freestyle_nunchaku","Glowsticking","Hooping","Hula_hoop","Poi_(performance_art)","Rhythmic_gymnastics","Trick_roping","Twirling","Baton_twirling","Color_guard_(flag_spinning)","Winter_guard","Card_manipulation","Chip_tricks","Dice_stacking","Hat_manipulation","Magic_(illusion)","Isolation_(illusion)","Knife_throwing","Pen_spinning","Prestidigitation","Sport_stacking","Shuffling","Whipcracking","Balisong_(knife)","Chinese_yo-yo","Devil_sticks","Diabolo","Plate_spinning","Yo-yo","Michael_Moschen","Burning_Man","Modern_juggling_culture"]}
