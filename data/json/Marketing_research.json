Marketing research specifies the information required to\naddress these issues, designs the method for collecting information, manages and\nimplements the data collection process, analyzes the results, and communicates\nthe findings and their implications.\" The Definition of Marketing. American\nMarketing Association.\nhttp://www.marketingpower.com/AboutAMA/Pages/DefinitionofMarketing.aspx.\nRetrieved 2011-12-02. Approved by the AMA Board of Directors in October 2007,\nthe Marketing Accountability Standards Board (MASB) endorses this definition as\npart of its ongoing [http://www.themasb.org/common-language-project/ Common\nLanguage: Marketing Activities and Metrics Project].\n\nIt is the systematic gathering, recording, and analysis of qualitative and\nquantitative data about issues relating to marketing products and services. The\ngoal of marketing research is to identify and assess how changing elements of\nthe marketing mix impacts customer behavior. The term is commonly interchanged\nwith market research; however, expert practitioners may wish to draw a\ndistinction, in that market research is concerned specifically with markets,\nwhile marketing research is concerned specifically about marketing\nprocesses.\n\nMarketing research is often partitioned into two sets of categorical pairs,\neither by target market:\n\n* Consumer marketing research, and\n* Business-to-business (B2B) marketing research\n\nOr, alternatively, by methodological approach:\n\n* Qualitative marketing research, and\n* Quantitative marketing research\n\nConsumer marketing research is a form of applied sociology that concentrates on\nunderstanding the preferences, attitudes, and behaviors of consumers in a market-\nbased economy, and it aims to understand the effects and comparative success of\nmarketing campaigns. The field of consumer marketing research as a statistical\nscience was pioneered by Arthur Nielsen with the founding of the ACNielsen\nCompany in 1923.

as the systematic and objective\nidentification, collection, analysis, and dissemination of information for the\npurpose of assisting management in decision making related to the identification\nand solution of problems and opportunities in marketing. {{Citation\n  | last = Malhotra first = Naresha K. author-link = last2 = first2 = author2-\n  | link = title = Basic Marketing Research: A
