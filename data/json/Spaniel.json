It is assumed\nspaniels originated from Spain as the word spaniel may be derived from Hispania\n(the Iberian Peninsula) or possibly from the French phrase \"Chiens de\nlâEspagnol\" (Dogs of the Spaniard). Spaniels were especially bred to flush game\nout of dense brush. By the late 17th century spaniels had become specialized\ninto water and land breeds. The extinct English Water Spaniel was used to\nretrieve water fowl shot down with arrows. Land spaniels were setting\nspanielsâthose that crept forward and pointed their game, allowing hunters to\nensnare them with nets, and springing spanielsâthose that sprang pheasants and\npartridges for hunting with falcons, and rabbits for hunting with greyhounds.\nDuring the 17th century, the role of the spaniel dramatically changed as\nEnglishmen began hunting with flintlocks for wing shooting.
