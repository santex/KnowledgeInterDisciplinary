Egyptian hieroglyphs also have a claim, and it is unsettled which\nsystem began first. See [http://oi.uchicago.edu/pdf/oimp32.pdf Visible Language.\nInventions of Writing in the Ancient Middle East and Beyond], Oriental Institute\nMuseum Publications, 32, Chicago: University of Chicago, p. 13, ISBN 978-1-885923-76-\n9 Emerging in Sumer in the late 4th millennium BC (the Uruk IV period),\ncuneiform writing began as a system of pictographs. In the third millennium, the\npictorial representations became simplified and more abstract as the number of\ncharacters in use grew smaller, from about 1,000 in the Early Bronze Age to\nabout 400 in Late Bronze Age (Hittite cuneiform).\n\nThe original Sumerian script was adapted for the writing of the Akkadian,\nEblaite, Elamite, Hittite, Luwian, Hattic, Hurrian, and Urartian languages, and\nit inspired the Ugaritic and Old Persian alphabets. Cuneiform writing was\ngradually replaced by the Phoenician alphabet during the Neo-Assyrian Empire,\nand by the 2nd century AD, the script had become extinct, all knowledge of how\nto read it forgotten until it began to be deciphered in the 19th century.\n\nCuneiform documents were written on clay tablets, by means of a blunt reed for a\nstylus. The impressions left by the stylus were wedge shaped, thus giving rise\nto the name cuneiform \"wedge shaped\", from the Latin cuneus \"wedge\".\n","linknr":1338,"url":"Cuneiform_(script)","recorded":1362534945,"links":96,"instances":["mechanical_device","akkad","seal","cuneiform"],"pdf":["http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U12000.pdf","http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U12400.pdf","http://oi.uchicago.edu/pdf/oimp32.pdf","http://std.dkuug.dk/jtc1/sc2/wg2/docs/n2786.pdf"],"categories":["Cuneiform|","Sumerian
