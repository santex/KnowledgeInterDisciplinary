It was formed as the Plumstead district by\n   the Metropolis Management Act 1855 and was governed by the 'Plumstead\n   District Board of Works', which consisted of elected vestrymen.\n\nUntil 1889 the district was in the county of Kent, but included in the area of\nthe Metropolitan Board of Works. In 1889 the area of the MBW was constituted the\nCounty of London, and the District Board became a local authority under the\nLondon County Council. In 1894 the parish of Plumstead was removed from the\ndistrict to be governed by a parish vestry and the district was renamed Lee.\n","linknr":173,"url":"Lee_District_(Metropolis)","recorded":1362544298,"links":14,"instances":["metropolis"],"pdf":[],"categories":["History of Greenwich","History of Lewisham","Districts (Metropolis)"],"headings":["Area","Abolition","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a3/Metropolitan_Board_of_Works_in_Spring_Gardens_1860_ILN.jpg/175px-Metropolitan_Board_of_Works_in_Spring_Gardens_1860_ILN.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["district","metropolis"]],"members":["district"],"related":["District_(Metropolis)","Metropolitan_Borough_of_Greenwich","Metropolitan_Borough_of_Lewisham","Metropolitan_Borough_of_Woolwich","Local_government","London","Metropolis_Management_Act_1855","Kent","Metropolitan_Board_of_Works","County_of_London","London_County_Council","Plumstead","Civil_parish","Charlton,_London","Eltham,_London","Kidbrooke","Lee,_London","Plumstead","Metropolitan_Borough_of_Greenwich","Metropolitan_Borough_of_Woolwich","Metropolitan_Borough_of_Lewisham"]}
