{"cursor":"4867","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nAn 'artistic director' is the executive of an arts organization, particularly in\na theatre company, that handles the organization's artistic direction. He or she\nis generally a producer and director, but not in the sense of a mogul, since the\norganization is generally a non-profit organization. The artistic director of a\ntheatre company is the individual with the overarching artistic control of the\ntheatre's production choices, directorial choices, and overall artistic vision.\nIn smaller theatres, the artistic director may be the founder of the theatre and\nthe primary director of its plays. In larger non-profit theatres (often known in\nCanada and the United States as regional theatres) the artistic director may be\nappointed by the board of directors.\n\nThe artistic director of a theatre is similar to the music director of a\nsymphony, the primary person responsible for planning a theatre's season. The\nartistic director's responsibilities can include but are not limited to choosing\nthe material staged in a season, the hiring of creative/production personnel\n(such as directors), and other theatre management tasks. He or she may also\ndirect productions for the company. Artistic directors work closely with the\ngeneral manager of the theatre, and contribute the artistic evaluation of\nprojects and productions to be included in promotional, funding, and press\nmaterials. An artistic director also functions as a resource for the directors\nwho are working to mount productions at the theatre and can provide support,\ncounsel, and/or artistic input where requested. The artistic director may be\ncalled to assume the production should the director become unable to complete\nhis/her duties. Artistic directors are frequently regarded as the artistic\nrepresentatives of theatre companies and are often required to speak about their\ntheatre to the press. In the United States, artistic directors often have\nfundraising responsibilities as well.\n\nIn some ensemble companies, the artistic director is responsible for recruiting\nperformers to act as a talent pool for the company's productions. This ensemble\nmay include actors and artists of various disciplines. The artistic director\nfunctions as leader of this group, with the aim to create and/or realize various\nnew and established works.\n\nIn ballet the artistic director is the head of a ballet company. He has overall\nresponsibility for training the dancers and mounting productions. He is almost\nalways a retired dancer. Often he also choreographs some of the company's\nproductions.\n\nIn some companies the artistic director may also manage the company but in a\ngreat many companies the artistic director may only make decisions about the\nart. In those cases decisions about administration, business issues, finances,\nfundraising, board relations, donor relations, publicity and marketing are\nusually the responsibility of the General Manager, Chief Operations Officer or\nManaging Director.\n","linknr":146,"url":"Artistic_director","recorded":1374546211,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Artistic_director&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Artistic_director&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Art_director","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Artistic_director&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Template:Citation_needed","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/wiki/Theatrical_producer","/wiki/Theatre_director","/wiki/Business_magnate","/wiki/Non-profit","/wiki/Theatre_company","/wiki/Canada","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/Regional_theatre_in_the_United_States","/wiki/Board_of_directors","/wiki/Music_director","/wiki/Play_(theatre)","/wiki/Theatre_director","/wiki/Fundraising","/wiki/Ballet","/wiki/Ballet_company","/wiki/Choreograph","/w/index.php?title=Artistic_director&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Jason_Alexander","/wiki/Reprise_Theatre_Company","/wiki/Pierre_Audi","/wiki/The_Netherlands_Opera","/w/index.php?title=Charlotte_Benns&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=TheNaked.&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Cate_Blanchett","/wiki/Andrew_Upton","/wiki/Sydney_Theatre_Company","/wiki/Michael_Colgan_(director)","/wiki/Gate_Theatre","/wiki/Robert_Falls","/wiki/Goodman_Theatre","/wiki/Joe_Dowling","/wiki/Guthrie_Theatre","/wiki/Jan_Englert","/wiki/National_Theatre,_Warsaw","/wiki/Michael_Kahn_(theatre_director)","/wiki/Shakespeare_Theatre_Company","/wiki/Emily_Mann_(director)","/wiki/McCarter_Theatre","/wiki/Diane_Paulus","/wiki/American_Repertory_Theatre","/wiki/Bill_Rauch","/wiki/Oregon_Shakespeare_Festival","/wiki/Michael_Ritchie_(artistic_director)","/wiki/Center_Theatre_Group","/wiki/Kevin_Spacey","/wiki/Old_Vic","/wiki/Helgi_T%C3%B3masson_(dancer)","/wiki/San_Francisco_Ballet","/wiki/Lin_Hwai-min","/wiki/Cloud_Gate_Dance_Theatre","/wiki/Willy_Tsao","/wiki/City_Contemporary_Dance_Company","/wiki/BeijingDance_/_LDTX","/wiki/Karen_Kain","/wiki/National_Ballet_of_Canada","/wiki/Nikolaj_H%C3%BCbbe","/wiki/Royal_Danish_Ballet","/wiki/Gregory_Doran","/wiki/Royal_Shakespeare_Company","/wiki/Mark_Baldwin_(choreographer)","/wiki/Rambert_Dance_Company","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Artistic_director&oldid=561709559","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Theatrical_professions","/wiki/Category:Theatrical_management","/wiki/Category:Artistic_directors","/wiki/Category:Articles_needing_additional_references_from_August_2010","/wiki/Category:All_articles_needing_additional_references","/wiki/Category:All_articles_with_unsourced_statements","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_unsourced_statements_from_August_2010","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Artistic+director&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Artistic+director","/wiki/Artistic_director","/wiki/Talk:Artistic_director","#","/wiki/Artistic_director","/w/index.php?title=Artistic_director&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Artistic_director&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Artistic_director","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Artistic_director","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Artistic_director&oldid=561709559","/w/index.php?title=Artistic_director&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1797162","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Artistic_director&id=561709559","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Artistic+director","/w/index.php?title=Special:Bo
