Kosygin was born in the city of St. Petersburg in\n1904 to a Russian working-class family. He was conscripted into the labor army\nduring the Russian Civil War, and after the Red Army's demobilisation in 1921,\nhe worked in Siberia as an industrial manager. Kosygin returned to Leningrad in\nthe early 1930s and worked his way up the Soviet hierarchy. During the Great\nPatriotic War (World War II), Kosygin was a member of the State Defence\nCommittee and was tasked with moving Soviet industry out of territories soon to\nbe overrun by the German military. He served as Minister of Finance for a year\nbefore becoming Minister of Light Industry and later, the Minister of Light and\nFood Industry. One year before his death in 1953, Stalin removed Kosygin from\nthe Politburo, intentionally weakening his position within the Soviet hierarchy.\n\nAfter the power struggle triggered by Stalin's death in 1953, Nikita Khrushchev\nbecame the new leader. On 20 March 1959, Kosygin was appointed to the position\nof Chairman of the State Planning Committee (Gosplan), a post he would hold for\nlittle more than a year. Kosygin next became First Deputy Chairman of the\nCouncil of Ministers. When Khrushchev was replaced in 1964, Kosygin and Leonid\nBrezhnev became Premier and First Secretary respectively. Kosygin, along with\nBrezhnev and Nikolai Podgorny, the Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme\nSoviet, was a member of the newly established collective leadership. Kosygin\nbecame one of two major power players within the Soviet hierarchy, the other\nbeing Brezhnev, and was able to initiate the failed 1965 economic reform,\nusually referred to simply as the Kosygin reform. This reform, along with his\nmore open stance on solving the Prague Spring (1968), made Kosygin one of the\nmost liberal members of the top leadership.\n\nSome of Kosygin's policies were seen as too radical, particularly by more\nconservative members of the top leadership. However, they were never able to\ndepose Kosygin as Premier, even if he and Brezhnev disliked each other. By the\n1970s, Brezhnev had consolidated enough power to stop any \"radical\" reform-\nminded attempts by Kosygin. In 1980, Kosygin retired from office due to bad\nhealth, dying two months later on 18 December 1980.\n","linknr":1421,"url":"Alexei_Kosygin","recorded":1362267872,"links":72,"instances":["politician","economics","soviet_union","peru","soviet_union","bolsheviks_in_the_1940s","soviet_union","soviet_union","soviet_union","soviet_union","1970","politician","world_war_ii","soviet_union","triumvirate"],"pdf":[],"categories":["1904
