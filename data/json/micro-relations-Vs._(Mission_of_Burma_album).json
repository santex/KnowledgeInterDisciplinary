It\nwas a fully realized follow-up to their EP [[Signals, Calls, and Marches]]. It\nwas the only full studio album the band released during the 1980s, as soon\nafterward they disbanded due to Roger Miller's worsening tinnitus.\n\nThe album is hailed as one of the classic examples of the post-punk movement and\nis ranked number 49 on Pitchfork Media's Top 100 Albums of the 1980s. Pitchfork\nwriter Chris Dahlen states, \"Boston's finest art-punk trio-plus-tape-guy\nrecorded just one studio full-length, and it's a massive legacy. Assessable not\nin tunes but in grinding velocity, it's texturally complex and high-energy.\nRoger Miller's guitar varies from hypnotic repetition on \"Trem Two\" to sounding\nlike a power line flailing in a pool of rain, while the rhythmic noise divides\ninto shards for Martin Swope's tape manipulations; Miller as vocalist is prone\nto outbursts and declamations, while Clint Conley sings with his vulnerabilities\nin barbed wire on his sleeve.\"\n\nEddie Vedder has stated that Pearl Jam's 1993 album [[Vs. (Pearl Jam\nalbum)|Vs.]] was titled as a tribute to the Mission of Burma album.\n","linknr":183,"url":"Vs._(Mission_of_Burma_album)","recorded":1362539372,"links":23,"instances":["boston","rock_musician","musician"],"pdf":[],"categories":["1982 albums","Mission of Burma albums","Rykodisc albums","Matador Records albums"],"headings":["Track listing","Personnel","Notes"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/84/Mission_of_Burma-Vs-cover.jpg/220px-Mission_of_Burma-Vs-cover.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Star_full.svg/11px-Star_full.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Star_full.svg/11px-Star_full.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Star_full.svg/11px-Star_full.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Star_full.svg/11px-Star_full.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/Star_half.svg/11px-Star_half.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/Gnome-dev-cdrom-audio.svg/30px-Gnome-dev-cdrom-audio.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["ace_of_hearts_records","boston"],["roger_miller","rock_musician"],["peter_prescott","musician"],["roger_miller","rock_musician"],["peter_prescott","musician"]],"members":["ace_of_hearts_records","roger_miller","peter_prescott"],"related":["Album","Mission_of_Burma","Post-punk","College_rock","Ace_of_Hearts_Records_(Boston)","Rykodisc","Matador_Records","Allmusic","Robert_Christgau","Pitchfork_Media","Boston","Post-punk","Mission_of_Burma","Extended_play","Tinnitus","Post-punk","Pitchfork_Media","Eddie_Vedder","Pearl_Jam","Mission_of_Burma","Roger_Miller_(rock_musician)","Clint_Conley","Peter_Prescott_(musician)","Martin_Swope","Tape_loop","Percussion_instrument","Clint_Conley","Bass_guitar","Singing","Roger_Miller_(rock_musician)","Guitar","Piano","Trumpet","Peter_Prescott_(musician)","Drum_kit"]}
