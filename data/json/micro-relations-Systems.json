{"cursor":"20987","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nA 'system' is a set of interacting or interdependent components forming an\nintegrated whole or a set of elements (often called'components') and\nrelationships which are different from relationships of the set or its elements\nto other elements or sets.\n\nFields that study the general properties of systems include Systems science,\nsystems theory, cybernetics, dynamical systems, thermodynamics, and complex\nsystems. They investigate the abstract properties of systems' matter and\norganization, looking for concepts and principles that are independent of\ndomain, substance, type, or temporal scale.\n\nSome systems share common characteristics, including:\n\n* A system has structure, it contains parts (or components) that are directly or\n  indirectly related to each other;\n* A system has behavior, it contains processes that transform inputs into\n  outputs (material, energy or data);\n* A system has interconnectivity: the parts and processes are connected by\n  structural and/or behavioral relationships.\n* A system's structure and behavior may be decomposed via subsystems and sub-\n  processes to elementary parts and process steps.\n\nThe term system may also refer to a set of rules that governs structure and/or\nbehavior. Alternatively, and usually in the context of complex social systems,\nthe term institution is used to describe the set of rules that govern structure\nand/or behavior.\n","linknr":474,"url":"Systems","recorded":1362567616,"links":82,"instances":["economics","norm","business","mathematics","systems","economics","systems_theory","systems_scientist","uml","topology","economics","computing","model","mathematics_"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Cybernetics","Systems|*","Systems science","Systems theory"],"headings":["Etymology","History","System concepts","Elements of a system","Types of systems","Analysis of systems","Application of the system concept","See also","References","Further reading","External links","",""],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/System_boundary.svg/250px-System_boundary.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/Complex-adaptive-system.jpg/32px-Complex-adaptive-system.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Wikiquote-logo-en.svg/40px-Wikiquote-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["set","mathematics_"],["element","mathematics"],["environment","systems"],["boundary","topology"],["environment","systems"],["open_system","systems_theory"],["open_system","systems_theory"],["organic","model"],["open_system","systems_theory"],["brian_wilson","systems_scientist"],["distribution","business"],["consumption","economics"],["good","economics"],["service","economics"],["convention","norm"],["component","uml"],["platform","computing"],["brian_wilson","systems_scientist"]],"members":["service","convention","distribution","element","environment","good","open_system","brian_wilson","component","boundary","consumption","platform","organic","set"],"related":["Set_(mathematics)_","Element_(mathematics)","Mathematical_relationship","Systems_science","Systems_theory","Cybernetics","Dynamical_systems","Thermodynamics","Complex_systems","Structure","Behavior","Interconnectivity","Institution","Latin","Greek_language","Plato","Aristotle","Euclid","Thermodynamics","Rudolf_Clausius","Environment_(systems)","Systems_theory","Ludwig_von_Bertalanffy","Norbert_Wiener","Ross_Ashby","Complex_adaptive_system","Santa_Fe_Institute","John_Henry_Holland","Murray_Gell-Mann","Systems_theory","Boundary_(topology)","Environment_(systems)","Scientific_modelling","Structure","Behavior","Open_system_(systems_theory)","Closed_system","Isolated_system","View_model","Requirement_analysis","Systems_design","Structure","Behavior","System_model","System_architecture","View_model","Requirement_analysis","Systems_design","Structure","Behavior","System_model","Quantitative_property","Qualitative_research","Kenneth_D._Bailey","Conceptual","Concrete","Isolated_system","Closed_system","Open_system_(systems_theory)","Walter_F._Buckley","Mechanics","Organic_(model)","Process_modeling","Bela_H._Banathy","Living_systems_theory","Solar_system","Galactic","George_J._Klir","The_Real","Conceptual_system","Physical_systems","Unbounded_system","Hybrid_system","Open_system_(systems_theory)","Systems_engineering","Peter_Checkland","Brian_Wilson_(systems_scientist)","Soft_Systems_Methodology","Action_research","Culture","Social_system","Sociocultural_system","Social_institution","Economic_production","Distribution_(business)","Consumption_(economics)","Good_(economics)","Service_(economics)","Society","Person","Institutions","Convention_(norm)","Property","Economics","Computer_science","Information_science","Software_system","Component_(UML)","Inter-process_communication","Roman_numerals","Dewey_Decimal_System","Platform_(computing)","Engineering","Physics","Physical_system","Thermodynamic_system","Systems_engineering","Management_science","Operations_research","Organizational_development","Business_processes","Organizational_behavior","Peter_Senge","Systems_thinking","Reasoning","Organizational_studies","Margaret_Wheatley","Quantum_physics","Chaos_theory","Self-organizing_systems","John_A._Warden_III","First_Gulf_War","Physical_system","Conceptual_system","Complex_system","Formal_system","Information_system","Meta-system","Solar_System","Human_anatomy","Market","Chaos_theory","Cybernetics","Systems_ecology","Systems_engineering","Systems_psychology","Systems_theory","Thermodynamic_system","Control_theory","Glossary_of_systems_theory","Complexity_theory_and_organizations","Black_box","System_of_systems","System_of_systems_engineering","Systems_art","Kenneth_D._Bailey","Bela_H._Banathy","Walter_F._Buckley","Peter_Checkland","Robert_L._Flood","George_J._Klir","Brian_Wilson_(systems_scientist)"]}
