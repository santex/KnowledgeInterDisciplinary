Very broadly speaking there are appeals on the record and de novo\nappeals. In de novo appeals, a new decision maker re-hears the case without any\nreference to the prior decision maker. In appeals on the record, the decision of\nthe prior decision maker is challenged by arguing that he or she misapplied the\nlaw, came to an incorrect factual finding, acted in excess of his jurisdiction,\nabused his powers, was biased, considered evidence which he should not have\nconsidered, or failed to consider evidence that he should have considered.\n","title":"appeal","headings":["Results","See also","References"]},"micro-relation":["1: Law","1: Appellate_court","1: Civil_procedure","1: List_of_legal_topics","1: Appellate_procedure_in_the_United_States"]}
