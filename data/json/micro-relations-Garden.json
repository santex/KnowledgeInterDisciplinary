The garden can incorporate both\n natural and man-made materials. The most common form today is known as a\n residential garden, but the term garden has traditionally been a more general\n one. Zoos, which display wild animals in simulated natural habitats, were\n formerly called [[zoological gardens]]. Garden history : philosophy and\n design, 2000 BC--2000 AD, Tom Turner. New York: Spon Press, 2005. ISBN 0-415-31748-\n 7 The earth knows my name : food, culture, and sustainability in the\n gardens of ethnic Americans, Patricia Klindienst. Boston: Beacon Press, c2006.\n ISBN 0-8070-8562-6 Western gardens are almost universally based on\n plants, with garden often signifying a shortened form of [[botanical garden]].\n\nSome traditional types of eastern gardens, such as Zen gardens, use plants such\nas parsley. Xeriscape gardens use local native plants that do not require\nirrigation or extensive use of other resources while still providing the\nbenefits of a garden environment. Gardens may exhibit structural enhancements,\nsometimes called follies, including water features such as fountains, ponds\n(with or without fish), waterfalls or creeks, dry creek beds, statuary, arbors,\ntrellises and more.\n\nSome gardens are for ornamental purposes only, while some gardens also produce\nfood crops, sometimes in separate areas, or sometimes intermixed with the\nornamental plants. Food-producing gardens are distinguished from farms by\ntheir smaller scale, more labor-intensive methods, and their purpose\n(enjoyment of a hobby rather than produce for sale). Flower gardens combine\nplants of different heights, colors, textures, and fragrances to create\ninterest and delight the senses.\n\n'[[Gardening]]' is the activity of growing and maintaining the garden. This work\nis done by an amateur or professional gardener. A gardener might also work in a\nnon-garden setting, such as a park, a roadside embankment, or other public\nspace. Landscape architecture is a related professional activity with landscape\narchitects tending to specialise in design for public and corporate clients.\n","linknr":708,"url":"Garden","recorded":1362373098,"links":128,"instances":["garden","land","cultivation","tv_series","geology","slavic_settlement","biology","gardening"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Landscape","Gardens|"],"headings":["Etymology","Garden
