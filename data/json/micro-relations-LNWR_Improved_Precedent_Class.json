Webb. 166 were built in batches Crewe Works 1887-1897\nwith two further additions in 1898 and 1901 respectively. They were officially\nrebuilds of 96 Newton Class and 80 Precedent Class, though in reality they were\n\"paper\" rebuilds â that is, they were recorded in the asset register as rebuilds\nfor accountancy purposes, even though they were entirely new. On \"rebuilding\"\n(or renewal), they kept the numbers and names of their predecessors, and as a\nresult the numbering system continued to be completely haphazard.\n\nOn 22 August 1895, 790 Hardwicke took 2 hours and 6 minutes for the from to ,\nwith an average speed of , setting up a new speed record during the Race to\nthe North.\n\nWithdrawals started in December 1905.\n\nThe LMS acquired 80 upon the grouping of 1923, and gave them the power\nclassification 1P. The LMS assigned these the numbers 5000â79, in order of build\ndate, though not all received them as withdrawals continued apace. By the end of\n1933, only 5001 Snowdon survived and in April 1934 it was renumbered 25001 to\nclear the number 5001 for an LMS Stanier Class 5 4-6-0, but was withdrawn in\nOctober that year.\n\nOne, 790 Hardwicke (built 1892, LMS No. 5031, withdrawn 1932) has been preserved\nas part of the National Railway Collection. It was overhauled in 1976 and hauled\nsome excursion trains on the main line, on one of which it double-headed with\n''Flying Scotsman''. During this period it was allocated T.O.P.S. number\n98190. It is currently a static exhibit in the\nNational Railway Museum in York.\n","linknr":179,"url":"LNWR_Improved_Precedent_Class","recorded":1362551661,"links":13,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["London and North Western Railway locomotives|Precedent, improved","2-4-0 locomotives","Railway locomotives introduced in 1887"],"headings":["Stock list","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/85/LNWR_Jumbo_class_locomotive_790_Hardwicke_%28Howden%2C_Boys%27_Book_of_Locomotives%2C_1907%29.jpg/300px-LNWR_Jumbo_class_locomotive_790_Hardwicke_%28Howden%2C_Boys%27_Book_of_Locomotives%2C_1907%29.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["F.W._Webb","Crewe_Works","2-4-0","Allan_valve_gear","London_and_North_Western_Railway","London,_Midland_and_Scottish_Railway","London_and_North_Western_Railway","2-4-0","Steam_locomotive","F.W._Webb","Crewe_Works","LNWR_Newton_Class","LNWR_Precedent_Class","Race_to_the_North","London,_Midland_and_Scottish_Railway","Power_classification","LMS_Stanier_Class_5_4-6-0","National_Railway_Collection","LNER_Class_A3_4472_Flying_Scotsman","British_Rail_Class_98","National_Railway_Museum","York","Willie_Yeadon"]}
