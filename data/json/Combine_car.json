{"cursor":"3246","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" in North Freedom, Wisconsin.]] A 'combine car' in North American parlance, most\n often referred to simply as a 'combine', is a type of railroad car which\n combines sections for both passengers and freight.\n\nMost often, it was used on short lines to carry passengers and their luggage, as\na full car would not have been cost effective. One half (or less) of the car is\nbuilt like a baggage car while the other half of the car is a regular passenger\ncar. This type of combine is referred to as a coach-baggage. Another common type\nof combine in railroad use was the coach-[[Railway Post Office|RPO]]. A portion\nof this type of car was configured as a railway post office while the rest of\nthe car was configured as a coach.\n\nWhen Amtrak took over in 1971, lightweight combines were used on most routes,\nparticularly on trains which had used combines before Amtrak took over. As\nAmtrak started rehabbing their older cars to Heritage Fleet standards, the only\ncombines which survived were the Baggage-Dorm cars. As Amtrak received the\nSuperliner cars in all forms, including dorm cars, the only routes which\nrequired rehabbed single-level dorm cars were the East Coast routes\n([[Crescent]], [[Lake Shore Limited]], [[Silver Star]], etc.) due to low tunnel\nclearance. Because Amtrak had a surplus of single-level coaches due to the\nrecent delivery of Amfleet coaches, baggage-coaches were unnecessary. Thus, baggage-\ndorm cars were the only cars that should logically be rehabbed. Rehabbed baggage-\ndorm cars were used on Amtrak East Coast routes from the early 1980s until 1996.\n\nWhen Amtrak received its new Viewliner and Superliner II sleeping cars in 1996,\nsome of the Heritage 10-6 sleepers were turned into crew dorms, and the dorms\nbecame unnecessary. When Amtrak received the Superliner II coaches, some of the\nHeritage coaches which had been replaced were turned into baggage cars. Thus,\nbaggage-dorms became unnecessary, and all were retired.\n\nAlthough Amtrak operates many cars in its Superliner fleet that are labeled as\ncoach-baggage, they are not often referred to as combines. Via Rail Canada still\noperates a few combines in the traditional sense, which carry passengers,\nbaggage and supplies for villages en route. They are towed by freight trains in\nfar northern Manitoba.\n","linknr":144,"url":"Combine_car","recorded":1374543144,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Combine_car&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Combine_car&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Coach-baggage_CNW_7409_20041010.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/Coach-baggage_CNW_7409_20041010.jpg/300px-Coach-baggage_CNW_7409_20041010.jpg","/wiki/File:Coach-baggage_CNW_7409_20041010.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf6/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Mid-Continent_Railway_Museum","/wiki/North_Freedom,_Wisconsin","/wiki/Railroad_car","/wiki/Passenger","/wiki/Freight","/wiki/Short-line_railroad","/wiki/Luggage","/wiki/Cost_effective","/wiki/Baggage_car","/wiki/Passenger_car_(rail)","/wiki/Railway_Post_Office","/wiki/Railway_post_office","/wiki/Coach_(rail)","/wiki/Amtrak","/wiki/Heritage_Fleet","/wiki/Superliner_(railcar)","/wiki/Crescent","/wiki/Lake_Shore_Limited","/wiki/Silver_Star","/wiki/Amfleet","/wiki/Viewliner","/wiki/Superliner_II","/wiki/Superliner_II","/wiki/Via_Rail_Canada","/wiki/Manitoba","/w/index.php?title=Combine_car&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0801827434","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0801827221","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0801827477","/w/index.php?title=Combine_car&action=edit&section=2","http://www.csrmf.org/doc.asp?ID=183","/wiki/Template:Passenger_cars","/wiki/Template_talk:Passenger_cars","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Passenger_cars&action=edit","/wiki/Rail_transport","/wiki/Passenger_car_(rail)","/wiki/Baggage_car","/wiki/Refrigerator_car#Specialized_applications","/wiki/Head_end_power_car","/wiki/Stock_car_(rail)#Specialized_applications","/wiki/Railway_post_office","/wiki/Mobile_post_office","/wiki/Bar_car","/wiki/Bilevel_rail_car","/wiki/Compartment_coach","/wiki/Corridor_coach","/wiki/Couchette_car","/wiki/Dining_car","/wiki/Dome_car","/wiki/Lounge_car","/wiki/Observation_car","/wiki/Open_coach","/wiki/Passenger_car_(rail)","/wiki/Sleeping_car","/wiki/Slip_coach","/wiki/Autorack","/wiki/Pay_car","/wiki/Private_railroad_car","/wiki/Troop_sleeper","/wiki/Multiple_unit","/wiki/Rail_motor_coach","/wiki/Railcar","/wiki/Railbus","/wiki/File:25_railtransportation.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/66/25_railtransportation.svg/19px-25_railtransportation.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Combine_car&action=edit","/wiki/Template:Rail-transport-stub","/wiki/Template_talk:Rail-transport-stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Rail-transport-stub&action=edit","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Combine_car&oldid=525960300","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Freight_equipment","/wiki/Category:Passenger_rail_vehicles","/wiki/Category:Rail_transport_stubs","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Combine+car&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Combine+car","/wiki/Combine_car","/wiki/Talk:Combine_car","#","/wiki/Combine_car","/w/index.php?title=Combine_car&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Combine_car&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Combine_car","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Combine_car","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Combine_car&oldid=525960300","/w/index.php?title=Combine_car&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Combine_car&id=525960300","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Combine+car","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Combine+car&oldid=525960300&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Combine_car&printable=yes","//de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gep%C3%A4ckwagen_(Eisenbahnwagen)","/
