Technical DDT has been formulated in almost\nevery conceivable form including solutions in xylene or petroleum\ndistillates, emulsifiable concentrates, water-wettable powders, granules,\naerosols, smoke candles, and charges for vaporisers and lotions. {{ cite book|title=DDT and Its Derivatives|page=83|publisher=World\nHealth Organisation|location=Geneva|year=1989|isbn=92-4-154283-7}}\n\nFirst synthesized in 1874, DDT's insecticidal properties were not discovered\nuntil 1939, and it was used with great success in the second half of World War\nII to control malaria and typhus among civilians and troops. The Swiss chemist\nPaul Hermann MÃ¼ller was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in\n1948 \"for his discovery of the high efficiency of DDT as a contact poison\nagainst several arthropods.\" [http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1948/\nNobelPrize.org: The Nobel Prize in Physiology of Medicine 1948] Accessed July\n26, 2007. After the war, DDT was made available for use as an agricultural\ninsecticide, and soon its production and use skyrocketed. [http://www.inchem.org/documents/ehc/ehc/ehc009.htm Environmental\nHealth Criteria 9: DDT and its derivatives], World Health Organization,\n1979.\n\nIn 1962, [[Silent Spring]] by American biologist Rachel Carson was published.\nThe book catalogued the environmental impacts of the indiscriminate spraying of\nDDT in the US and questioned the logic of releasing large amounts of chemicals\ninto the environment without fully understanding their effects on ecology or\nhuman health. The book suggested that DDT and other pesticides may cause cancer\nand that their agricultural use was a threat to wildlife, particularly birds.\nIts publication was one of the signature events in the birth of the\nenvironmental movement, and resulted in a large public outcry that eventually\nled to DDT being banned in the US in 1972. DDT was\nsubsequently banned for agricultural use worldwide under the Stockholm\nConvention, but its limited use in disease vector control continues to this day\nand remains controversial.\n\nAlong with the passage of the Endangered Species Act, the US ban on DDT is cited\nby scientists as a major factor in the comeback of the bald eagle, the national\nbird of the United States, from near-extinction in the contiguous US.
