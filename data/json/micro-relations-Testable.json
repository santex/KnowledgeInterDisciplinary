In\nshort, a hypothesis is testable if there is some real hope of deciding whether\nit is true or false of real experience. Upon this property of its constituent\nhypotheses rests the ability to decide whether a theory can be supported or\nfalsified by the data of actual experience. If hypotheses are tested, initial\nresults may also be labeled inconclusive.\n","linknr":114,"url":"Testable","recorded":1362668929,"links":19,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Logic","Philosophy of science"],"headings":["See also","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bb/P_philosophy.png/32px-P_philosophy.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8b/Nuvola_apps_kalzium.svg/28px-Nuvola_apps_kalzium.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Empirical","Hypothesis","Contingency","Falsifiability","Counterexample","Practical","Reproducibility","Hypothesis","Theory","Confirmability","Contingency","Controllability","Observability","Scientific_method","Karl_Popper","Thomas_Kuhn"]}
