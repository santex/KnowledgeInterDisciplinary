{"cursor":"25187","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"]] The 'Chipko movement' or 'Chipko Andolan' is a movement that practiced the\nGandhian methods of satyagraha and non-violent resistance, through the act of\nhugging trees to protect them from being felled. The modern Chipko movement\nstarted in the early 1970s in the Garhwal Himalayas of Uttarakhand, then in\nUttar Pradesh with growing awareness towards rapid deforestation. The landmark\nevent in this struggle took place on March 26, 1974, when a group of peasant\nwomen in Reni village, Hemwalghati, in Chamoli district, Uttarakhand, India,\nacted to prevent the cutting of trees and reclaim their traditional forest\nrights that were threatened by the contractor system of the state Forest\nDepartment. Their actions inspired hundreds of such actions at the grassroots\nlevel throughout the region. By the 1980s the movement had spread throughout\nIndia and led to formulation of people-sensitive forest policies, which put a\nstop to the open felling of trees in regions as far reaching as Vindhyas and the\nWestern Ghats.

Water shortages became\nwidespread. Subsequently, communities gave up raising livestock, which added to\nthe problems of malnutrition in the region. This crisis was heightened by the\nfact that forest conservation policies, like the Indian Forest Act, 1927,\ntraditionally restricted the access of local communities to the forests,\nresulting in scarce farmlands in an over- populated and extremely poor area,\ndespite all of its natural wealth. Thus the sharp decline in the local agrarian\neconomy lead to a migration of people into the plains in search of jobs, leaving\nbehind several de-populated villages in the 1960s.

The year 1964 saw the establishment of Dasholi Gram\nSwarajya Sangh (DGSS) (âDasholi Society for Village Self-Ruleâ ), set up by\nGandhian social worker, Chandi Prasad Bhatt in Gopeshwar, and inspired by\nJayaprakash Narayan and the Sarvodaya movement, with an aim to set up small\nindustries using the resources of the forest. Their first project was a small\nworkshop making farm tools for local use. Its name was later changed to Dasholi\nGram Swarajya Sangh (DGSS) from the original Dasholi Gram Swarajya Mandal (DGSM)\nin the 1980s. Here they had to face restrictive forest policies, a hangover of\ncolonial era still prevalent, as well as the \"contractor system\", in which these\npieces of forest land were commodified and auctioned to big contractors, usually\nfrom the plains, who brought along their own skilled and semi-skilled laborers,\nleaving only the menial jobs like hauling rocks for the hill people, and paying\nthem next to nothing. On the other hand, the hill regions saw an influx of more\npeople from the outside, which only added to the already strained ecological\nbalance.

In\nOctober 1971, the Sangh workers held a demonstration in Gopeshwar to protest\nagainst the policies of the Forest Department. More rallies and marches were\nheld in late 1972, but to little effect, until a decision to take direct action\nwas taken. The first such occasion occurred when the Forest Department turned\ndown the Sanghâs annual request for ten ash trees for its farm tools workshop,\nand instead awarded a contract for 300 trees to Simon Company, a sporting goods\nmanufacturer in distant Allahabad, to make tennis rackets. In March, 1973, the\nlumbermen arrived at Gopeshwar, and after a couple of weeks, they were\nconfronted at village Mandal on April 24, 1973, where about hundred villagers\nand DGSS workers were beating drums and shouting slogans, thus forcing the\ncontractors and their lumbermen to retreat. This was the first confrontation of\nthe movement, The contract was eventually cancelled and awarded to the Sangh\ninstead. By now, the issue had grown beyond the mere procurement of an annual\nquota of three ash trees, and encompassed a growing concern over commercial\nlogging and the government's forest policy, which the villagers saw as\nunfavourable towards them. The Sangh also decided to resort to tree-hugging, or\nChipko, as a means of non-violent protest.\n\nBut the struggle was far from over, as the same company was awarded more ash\ntrees, in the Phata forest, 80 km away from Gopeshwar. Here again, due to\nlocal opposition, starting on June 20, 1973, the contractors retreated after a\nstand-off that lasted a few days. Thereafter, the villagers of Phata and Tarsali\nformed a vigil group and watched over the trees till December, when they had\nanother successful stand-off, when the activists reached the site in time. The\nlumberermen retreated leaving behind the five ash trees felled.\n\nThe final flash point began a few months later, when the government announced an\nauction scheduled in January, 1974, for 2,500 trees near Reni village,\noverlooking the Alaknanda River. Bhatt set out for the villages in the Reni\narea, and incited the villagers, who decided to protest against the actions of\nthe government by hugging the trees. Over the next few weeks, rallies and\nmeetings continued in the Reni area.\n\nOn March 26, 1974, the day the lumbermen were to cut the trees, the men\nof the Reni village and DGSS workers were in Chamoli, diverted by state\ngovernment and contractors to a fictional compensation payment site,\nwhile back home labourers arrived by the truckload to start logging\noperations. A local girl, on seeing them, rushed to inform\nGaura Devi, the head of the village Mahila Mangal Dal, at Reni village\n(Laata was her ancestral home and Reni adopted home). Gaura Devi led 27\nof the village women to the site and confronted the loggers. When all\ntalking failed, and instead the loggers started to shout and abuse the\nwomen, threatening them with guns, the women resorted to hugging the\ntrees to stop them from being felled. This went on into late hours. The\nwomen kept an all-night vigil guarding their trees from the cutters till\na few of them relented and left the village. The next day, when the men\nand leaders returned, the news of the movement spread to the neighbouring\nLaata and others villages including Henwalghati, and more people joined\nin. Eventually only after a four-day stand-off, the contractors left. [http://www.tehelka.com/story_main6.asp?filename=Ne090411Chipko-\n.asp Chipko! - Hill conservationists] Tehelka, September 11,\n2004.
