It was formed from Infantry Brigade Reconnaissance Groups on 14\nJanuary 1941.\n\nAll the Brigade reconnaissance groups of each infantry Corps were formed into\nreconnaissance battalions, each usually bearing the number of its relevant\nDivision. For example, the 43rd Battalion, Reconnaissance Corps (based on the\n5th Battalion, the Gloucestershire Regiment) was the divisional reconnaissance\nbattalion of the 43rd (Wessex) Infantry Division. [http://www.regiments.org/regiments/uk/volmil-england/vinf-so/gc-\n5.htm Mills, T.F. Land Forces of Britain, the Empire and Commonwealth] 5th\nBattalion, The Gloucestershire Regiment page. Retrieved 26 November 2007.\n\nInitially, coming from infantry units, reconnaissance units used the infantry\ndesignations of battalions, companies and platoons. However, from 6 June 1942,\nthe Corps changed to the cavalry descriptions of regiments, squadrons and\ntroops.\n\nIt became part of the Royal Armoured Corps in 1944, still maintaining its own\ncap badge with two lightning strikes supporting an upright spear. With the end\nof the war, this number of reconnaissance units was not needed and the Corps was\ndisbanded in August 1946. Reconnaissance duties reverted to Regular armoured\nunits of the Royal Armoured Corps.\n","linknr":453,"url":"Reconnaissance_Corps","recorded":1375083801,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Reconnaissance_Corps&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Reconnaissance_Corps&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Reconnaissance_Corps_Badge.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/9e/Reconnaissance_Corps_Badge.jpg/150px-Reconnaissance_Corps_Badge.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/ae/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg/23px-Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png","/wiki/United_Kingdom","/wiki/File:Flag_of_the_British_Army.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/Flag_of_the_British_Army.svg/23px-Flag_of_the_British_Army.svg.png","/wiki/British_Army","/wiki/Corps","/wiki/British_Army","/wiki/Gloucestershire_Regiment","/wiki/43rd_(Wessex)_Infantry_Division","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Battalion","/wiki/Platoon","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Royal_Armoured_Corps","/wiki/Regular_army","#Organisation_and_equipment","#Units","#Notes","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Reconnaissance_Corps&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/File:Recce_unit_sign_41.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/8d/Recce_unit_sign_41.png","/wiki/File:Recce_unit_sign_41.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Winchester","/wiki/Catterick,_North_Yorkshire","/wiki/Yorkshire","/wiki/IQ_test","/wiki/Parachute_Regiment_(United_Kingdom)","/wiki/Humber_Light_Reconnaissance_Car","/wiki/Universal_Carrier","/wiki/Humber_Armoured_Car","/wiki/Daimler_Armoured_Car","/wiki/T17_Armored_Car","/wiki/M8_Greyhound","#cite_note-3","/w/index.php?title=Reconnaissance_Corps&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=1st_Reconnaissance_Regiment&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/1st_Infantry_Division_(United_Kingdom)","/wiki/Royal_Hampshire_Regiment","#cite_note-4","/w/index.php?title=2nd_Reconnaissance_Regiment&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/2nd_Infantry_Division_(United_Kingdom)","/wiki/Loyal_Regiment_(North_Lancashire)","#cite_note-5","#cite_note-6","/w/index.php?title=3rd_Reconnaissance_Regiment&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/3rd_Infantry_Division_(United_Kingdom)","/wiki/Royal_Northumberland_Fusiliers","#cite_note-7","#cite_note-archive1-8","/w/index.php?title=4th_Reconnaissance_Regiment&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/10th_Infantry_Brigade_(United_Kingdom)","/wiki/11th_Infantry_Brigade_(United_Kingdom)","/wiki/12th_Infantry_Brigade_(United_Kingdom)","/wiki/4th_Infantry_Division_(United_Kingdom)","#cite_note-9","/w/index.php?title=5th_Reconnaissance_Regiment&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/5th_Infantry_Division_(United_Kingdom)","/w/index.php?title=Tower_Hamlets_Rifles&action=edit&redlink=1","#cite_note-10","#cite_note-archive2-11","/w/index.php?title=11th_(East_African)_Reconnaissance_Regiment&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/11th_(East_Africa)_Division","/w/index.php?title=Kenya_Armoured_Car_Regiment&action=edit&redlink=1","#cite_note-12","/w/index.php?title=15th_(Scottish)_Reconnaissance_Regiment&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/15th_(Scottish)_Infantry_Division","#cite_note-13","#cite_note-archive2-11","/w/index.php?title=18th_Reconnaissance_Battalion&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/18th_Infantry_Division_(United_Kingdom)","/wiki/Loyal_Regiment_(North_Lancashire)","/wiki/Battle_of_Singapore","#cite_note-14","/w/index.php?title=38th_(Welsh)_Reconnaissance_Regiment&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/38th_(Welsh)_Infantry_Division","#cite_note-adsl1-15","/wiki/43rd_(Wessex)_Reconnaissance_Regiment","/wiki/43rd_(Wessex)_Infantry_Division","/wiki/48th_(South_Midland)_Division","/wiki/Sword_Beach","#cite_note-16","#cite_note-adsl3-17","#cite_note-archive2-11","#cite_note-18","#cite_note-Ellis-19","/w/index.php?title=44th_Reconnaissance_Regiment&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/44th_(Home_Counties)_Infantry_Division","/wiki/Queen%27s_Own_Royal_West_Kent_Regiment","/wiki/56th_(London)_Infantry_Division","#cite_note-20","/w/index.php?title=45th_Reconnaissance_Regiment&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/45th_Infantry_Division_(United_Kingdom)","/wiki/70th_Infantry_Division_(United_Kingdom)","/wiki/South_Staffordshire_Regiment","#cite_note-21","/w/index.php?title=46th_Reconnaissance_Regiment&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/46th_Infantry_D
