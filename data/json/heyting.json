He was a student of Luitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer at\nthe University of Amsterdam, and did much to put intuitionistic logic on a\nfooting where it could become part of mathematical logic. Heyting gave the first\nformal development of intuitionistic logic in order to codify Brouwer's way of\ndoing mathematics. The inclusion of Brouwer's name in the\nBrouwer–Heyting–Kolmogorov interpretation is largely honorific, as Brouwer was\nopposed in principle to the formalisation of certain intuitionistic principles\n(and went as far as calling Heyting's work a \"sterile exercise\").<ref>Walter P.\nvan Stigt (1990).
