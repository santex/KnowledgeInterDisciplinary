No woman held a\nCabinet position before the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment to the\nUnited States Constitution in 1920, which prohibits states and the federal\ngovernment from denying any citizen the right to vote because of that citizen's\nsex.\n\nFrances Perkins was the first woman to serve in the Cabinet; she was appointed\nSecretary of Labor in 1933 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Oveta Culp Hobby became the\nsecond woman to serve in the Cabinet, when she was named\nhead of the then newly formed Department of Health, Education, and Welfare in\n1953. This department was subdivided into the departments\nof Education and Health and Human Services in 1979. Patricia\nRoberts Harris, who was Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare before the\ndepartment split and had earlier served as Secretary of Housing and Urban\nDevelopment in 1977, became the first female Secretary of Health and Human\nServices in 1979. Harris was also the first African American woman to serve in\nthe Cabinet.\n\nFormer North Carolina Senator Elizabeth Dole is the first woman to have served\nin two different Cabinet positions in two different administrations. She was\nappointed by President Ronald Reagan as Secretary of Transportation in 1983, and\nwas the Secretary of Labor during the tenure of George H. W. BushâReagan's\nsuccessor. Czechoslovakia-born Madeleine Albright became\nthe first foreign-born woman to serve in the Cabinet when she was appointed\nSecretary of State in 1997. Her appointment also made\nher the highest-ranking female Cabinet member at that time. Condoleezza Rice was appointed Secretary of State in 2005, and\nthus became the highest-ranking woman in the United States presidential line of\nsuccession in history. In 2006, Nancy Pelosi replaced\nRice as the highest-ranking woman in line when she was elected Speaker of the\nHouse. President George W. Bush appointed six\nwomen to Cabinet-level positions, the most of any Presidency.\n\nIn 2009, President Barack Obama named four women to the Cabinetâformer Arizona\ngovernor Janet Napolitano as Secretary of Homeland Security, former First Lady\nand New York Senator Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State, former California\nRepresentative Hilda Solis as Secretary of Labor, and former Kansas governor\nKathleen Sebelius as Secretary of Health and Human Services. Clinton became the first First Lady to serve in the\nCabinet and the third female Secretary of State. Napolitano\nbecame the first female Secretary of Homeland Security.\n\nThe Department of Labor has had the most female Secretaries with seven. The departments of Health and Human Services and State\nfollow with three, and the departments of Commerce, Education, Housing and Urban\nDevelopment and Transportation have each had two. The defunct\nDepartment of Health, Education, and Welfare has also had two female\nSecretaries. The three existing departments of Defense,\nTreasury, and Veterans Affairs have not had women Secretaries.\n","linknr":549,"url":"List_of_female_United_States_Cabinet_Secretaries","recorded":1375090445,"links":["/w/index.php?title=List_of_female_United_States_Cabinet_Secretaries&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=List_of_female_United_States_Cabinet_Secretaries&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Albrightmadeleine.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c3/Albrightmadeleine.jpg/100px-Albrightmadeleine.jpg","/wiki/File:Condoleezza_Rice_cropped.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/Condoleezza_Rice_cropped.jpg/105px-Condoleezza_Rice_cropped.jpg","/wiki/File:Hillary_Clinton_official_Secretary_of_State_portrait_crop.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/Hillary_Clinton_official_Secretary_of_State_portrait_crop.jpg/110px-Hillary_Clinton_official_Secretary_of_State_portrait_crop.jpg","/wiki/Madeleine_Albright","/wiki/Condoleezza_Rice","/wiki/Hillary_Rodham_Clinton","/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State","/wiki/United_States_Cabinet","/wiki/Nineteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution","/wiki/United_States_Constitution","/wiki/Suffrage","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Frances_Perkins","/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Labor","/wiki/President_of_the_United_States","/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt","#cite_note-perkins_a-2","#cite_note-perkins_b-3","/wiki/Oveta_Culp_Hobby","#cite_note-hobby-4","/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Health,_Education,_and_Welfare","#cite_note-HHS-5","/wiki/United_States_federal_executive_departments","/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Education","/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Health_and_Human_Services","#cite_note-HHS-5","/wiki/Patricia_Roberts_Harris","/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Housing_and_Urban_Development","/wiki/African_American","#cite_note-harris-6","/wiki/North_Carolina","/wiki/United_States_Senate","/wiki/Elizabeth_Dole","/wiki/Ronald_Reagan","/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Transportation","/wiki/George_H._W._Bush","#cite_note-dole-7","/wiki/Czechoslovakia","/wiki/Madeleine_Albright","/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State","#endnote_Note1a","#cite_note-albright-8","#endnote_Note2b","#cite_note-albright-8","/wiki/Condoleezza_Rice","/wiki/United_States_presidential_line_of_succession","#cite_note-rice-9","/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi","/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives","#cite_note-10","#cite_note-succession-11","/wiki/George_W._Bush","/wiki/Barack_Obama","/wiki/List_of_Governors_of_Arizona","/wiki/Janet_Napolitano","/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Homeland_Security","/wiki/List_of_First_Ladies_of_the_United_States","/wiki/New_York","/wiki/Hillary_Rodham_Clinton","/wiki/California","/wiki/U.S._House_of_Representatives","/wiki/Hilda_Solis","/wiki/List_of_Governors_of_Kansas","/wiki/Kathleen_Sebelius","#cite_note-napolitano-12","#cite_note-clinton-13","#cite_note-solis-14","#cite_note-sebelius-15","#cite_note-clinton-13","#cite_note-napolitano-12","#cite_note-women-16","/wiki/United_States_Department_of_State","/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Commerce","/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Housing_and_Urban_Development","/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Transportation","#cite_note-women-16","#cite_note-women-16","/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Defense","/wiki/United_States_Department_of_the_Treasury","/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Veterans_Affairs","#cite_note-treasury-17","#cite_note-defense-18","#cite_note-va-19","#Female_Secretaries","#Current_departments","#Defunct_departments","#See_also","#Notes","#References","/w/index.php?title=List_of_female_United_States_Cabinet_Secretaries&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=List_of_female_United_States_Cabinet_Secretaries&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/File:Image_FrancesPerkinsAfterRooseveltsDeath.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ad/Image_FrancesPerkinsAfterRooseveltsDeath.jpg/170px-Image_FrancesPerkinsAfterRooseveltsDeath.jpg","/wiki/File:Image_FrancesPerkinsAfterRooseveltsDeath.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Frances_Perkins","/wiki/File:Patricia_R._Harris.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/19/Patricia_R._Harris.jpg/170px-Patricia_R._Harris.jpg","/wiki/File:Pat
