The\nalbum is more power metal and traditional heavy metal than thrash metal, a\ntransition slowly seen throughout their releases. Exactly 7 days before the\nalbum's release, the single \"Missing\" came out to promote it. Oddly, a\npromotional video for the single's B-side \"Killer\" was made, but there was never\nan official promotional video for any song actually on Absolute.\n","linknr":98,"url":"Absolute_(Aion_album)","recorded":1362554347,"links":13,"instances":["japanese_band"],"pdf":[],"categories":["1994 albums"],"headings":["Track listing","Credits","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/bc/Absolute_%28Aion_album%29.jpeg/220px-Absolute_%28Aion_album%29.jpeg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["aion","japanese_band"],["aion","japanese_band"]],"members":["aion"],"related":["Aion_(Japanese_band)","Power_metal","Traditional_heavy_metal","Japanese_people","Heavy_metal_music","Aion_(Japanese_band)","Power_metal","Traditional_heavy_metal","Thrash_metal","Izumi_Ochiai"]}
