The concept developed mostly in the United States of America after World\nWar II. Initially focusing on military might, it now encompasses a broad range\nof facets, all of which impinge on the non military or economic security of the\nnation and the values espoused by the national society. Accordingly, in order to\npossess national security, a nation needs to possess economic security, energy\nsecurity, environmental security, etc. Security threats involve not only\nconventional foes such as other nation-states but also non-state actors such as\nviolent non-state actors, narcotic cartels, multinational corporations and non-\ngovernmental organisations; some authorities include natural disasters and\nevents causing severe environmental damage in this category.\n\nMeasures taken to ensure national security include:\n* using diplomacy to rally allies and isolate threats\n* marshalling economic power to facilitate or compel cooperation\n* maintaining effective armed forces\n* implementing civil defense and emergency preparedness measures (including anti-\n  terrorism legislation)\n* ensuring the resilience and redundancy of critical infrastructure\n* using intelligence services to detect and defeat or avoid threats and\n  espionage, and to protect classified information\n* using counterintelligence services or secret police to protect the nation from\n  internal threats\n","linknr":389,"url":"National_security","recorded":1362546688,"links":43,"instances":["economics","secretary_of_defense","book","political","polity"],"pdf":["http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/new_pubs/jp1_02.pdf","http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/new_pubs/jp1_02.pdf","http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/rss_viewer/national_security_strategy.pdf"],"categories":["National security|","Political terminology"],"headings":["Definitions","History of the national security concept","Current American views","Elements of national security","National security and rights & freedoms","Technical aspects","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Ambox_globe_content.svg/48px-Ambox_globe_content.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9d/National.security.parliament.arp.750pix.Clean.jpg/200px-National.security.parliament.arp.750pix.Clean.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["state","polity"],["harold_brown","secretary_of_defense"],["leviathan","book"],["land","economics"],["freedom","political"]],"members":["land","harold_brown","leviathan","freedom","state"],"related":["London","United_Kingdom","Concrete","Car_bomb","State_(polity)","Economic_power","Diplomacy","Power_projection","Political_power","United_States","World_War_II","Economic_security","Energy_security","Environmental_security","Nation_state","Violent_non-state_actor","Multinational_corporation","Non-governmental_organization","Natural_disaster","Diplomacy","Armed_forces","Civil_defense","Emergency_preparedness","Anti-terrorism_legislation","Critical_infrastructure","Intelligence_service","Espionage","Classified_information","Counterintelligence","Secret_police","Nation","Nation_state","Walter_Lippmann","War","Harold_Lasswell","Coercion","National_Defence_College,_India","India","Harold_Brown_(Secretary_of_Defense)","United_States_Secretary_of_Defense","Presidency_of_Jimmy_Carter","Harvard","National_power","Prabhakaran_Paleri","Peace_of_Westphalia","Sovereign_state","Sovereign","Thomas_Hobbes","Leviathan_(book)","Classical_realism","Immanuel_Kant","United_States","World_War_II","Yale_University","Foreign_relations_of_the_United_States","National_Security_Act_of_1947","President_of_the_United_States","Harry_S._Truman","United_States_Department_of_Defense","United_States_Secretary_of_Defense","United_States_National_Security_Council","Central_Intelligence_Agency","Maxwell_Taylor","Cold_War","Superpower","Terrorism","September_11,_2001_attacks","The_White_House","President_of_the_United_States","The_White_House","Executive_Office_of_the_President_of_the_United_States","National_power","Military_capability","Diplomacy","Politics","Society","Environmental_policy","Energy","Natural_resources","Economics","Elements_of_national_power","Security","Nation-states","Nations","European_Union","United_Nations","Middle_East","Mexico","Rwanda","Roman_empire","Carthage","Gulf_War","Agent_Orange","Vietnam_War","Water","Energy","Land_(economics)","Minerals","Japan","Gulf_War","Iraq","Kuwait","India","Pakistan","Hegelian_dialectic","Liberal_democracy","Authority","Civil_rights","Human_rights","Self-determination","Sovereignty","Natural_right","Freedom_(political)","Good_governance","Rule_of_law","Separation_of_powers","Political_dissent","Formal_logic","Mass_surveillance","Censorship","Mass_media","Orwellian","Dystopia","USA_Patriot_Act","Anti-terrorism_legislation","Computer_insecurity","Good_governance","Homeland_security","Human_security","International_security","Nuclear_deterrence","Police_state","Rule_of_law","Security","Terrorism"]}
