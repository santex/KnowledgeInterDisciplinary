{"cursor":"7573","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n{{Infobox disease\n| Name = Lisp ICD10 = ICD9 =\n}}\n\nA 'lisp' is a speech impediment, historically also known as 'sigmatism'. {{cite web| url=http://www.speech-language-\ntherapy.com/~speech/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=86:lisp&catid=-\n11:admin&Itemid=122| title=Lisping - when /s/ and /z/ are hard to say|\nfirst=Caroline| last=Bowen| accessdate=2006-03-07}} Stereotypically,\npeople with a lisp are unable to pronounce sibilants (like the sound ), and\nreplace them with interdentals (like the sound ), though there are actually\nseveral kinds of lisp. The result is that the speech is unclear.\n\n* \"Interdental\" lisping is produced when the tip of the tongue protrudes between\n  the front teeth and \"dentalised\" lisping is produced when the tip of the\n  tongue just touches the front teeth.\n* The \"lateral\" lisp is where the and sounds are produced with air escaping over\n  the sides of the tongue, is also called 'slushy ess' or a 'slushy lisp' due to\n  the wet, spitty sound. The symbols for these lateralised sounds are in the\n  Extended International Phonetic Alphabet for speech disorders, and . Notably\n  Bryan Murray (ice hockey), the general manager of the NHL's Ottawa Senators,\n  and the former mayor of New York1, Rudolph Giuliani, have this type of\n  lisp.\n* Finally, there is the \"palatal lisp\", where the speaker attempts to make the\n  sounds with the tongue in contact with the palate.\n","linknr":201,"url":"Lisp","recorded":1362511103,"links":28,"instances":["ice_hockey","phonetics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Speech impediments","Specific developmental disorders"],"headings":["Cause of lisps","Treatment","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["bryan_murray","ice_hockey"],["phone","phonetics"]],"members":["bryan_murray","phone"],"related":["Speech_impediment","Sibilant","Interdental_consonant","Lateral_consonant","International_Phonetic_Alphabet","Bryan_Murray_(ice_hockey)","Ottawa_Senators","New_York_City","Rudolph_Giuliani","Physiological","Adenoids","Phoneme","Phone_(phonetics)","Allophone","Gay_lisp"]}
