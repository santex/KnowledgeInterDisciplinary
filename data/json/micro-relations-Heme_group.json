{"cursor":"15990","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" of Heme B]]\n\nA 'haem' (British English) or 'heme' (American English) is a chemical compound\nof a type known as a prosthetic group consisting of an iron ion contained in the\ncentre of a large heterocyclic organic ring called a porphyrin, made up of four\npyrrolic groups joined together by methine bridges. Not all porphyrins contain\niron, but a substantial fraction of porphyrin-containing metalloproteins have\nheme as their prosthetic group; these are known as hemoproteins. Hemes are most\ncommonly recognized in their presence as components of hemoglobin, the red\npigment in blood, but they are also components of a number of other hemo-\nproteins such as haemoglobin, myoglobin, cytochrome, endothelial nitric oxide\nsynthase, catalase, etc.\n","linknr":484,"url":"Heme_group","recorded":1362371313,"links":59,"instances":["physiology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Tetrapyrroles","Biomolecules","Cofactors"],"headings":["Function","Types","Synthesis","Degradation","Heme in health and disease","Genes","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/69/Haem-B-3D-vdW.png/200px-Haem-B-3D-vdW.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/Heme.png/200px-Heme.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Succinate_Dehygrogenase_1YQ3_Haem_group.png/220px-Succinate_Dehygrogenase_1YQ3_Haem_group.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/25/Porphyrin_Numbering.png/100px-Porphyrin_Numbering.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/be/Heme_b.svg/200px-Heme_b.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Heme_a.svg/200px-Heme_a.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/Heme_synthesis.svg/551px-Heme_synthesis.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d9/Heme_Breakdown.png/220px-Heme_Breakdown.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["respiration","physiology"]],"members":["respiration"],"related":["British_English","American_English","Chemical_compound","Prosthetic_group","Iron","Heterocyclic","Porphyrin","Pyrrole","Methine","Metalloprotein","Hemoprotein","Hemoglobin","Blood","Succinate_dehydrogenase","Electron_carrier","Mitochondria","Electron_transfer_chain","Iron","Ion","Hemoproteins","Diatomic","Catalysis","Redox","Peroxidase","Porphyrin","Ligand","Hemoproteins","Photosynthesis","Cyanobacteria","Hemoglobin","Lung","PH","Bohr_effect","Histidine","Carbonic_acid","Heme_A","Heme_B","Heme_C","Heme_O","Farnesene","Vinyl","Cysteine","Farnesene","Cysteine","Formyl","Methyl","Cytochrome_c_oxidase","Lactoperoxidase","Eosinophil_peroxidase","Thyroid_peroxidase","Peroxide","Glutamyl","Aspartyl","Myeloperoxidase","Ester_bond","Sulfonium","Chloride","Bromide","Neutrophil","Hypobromite","Propionic_acid","Spirolactone","Formyl","Hans_Fischer","Cytochrome","Mitochondrion","Porphyrin","Pyrrole","Cobalamin","Vitamin_B12","D-Aminolevulinic_acid","Amino_acid","Glycine","Succinyl-CoA","Citric_acid_cycle","Acute_intermittent_porphyria","Inborn_error_of_metabolism","Liver","Bone_marrow","Bilirubin_metabolism","Spleen","Biliverdin","NADPH","Carbon_monoxide","Ferric","Serum_albumin","Glucuronic_acid","Bile","Gut_flora","Bilirubin_diglucuronide","Urobilinogen","Urobilin","Stercobilinogen","Stercobilin","Feces","Fenton's_reagent","Programmed_cell_death","Malaria","Dehydratase","Oxidase","Ferrochelatase","Synthase","Oxidase","Uroporphyrinogen","Decarboxylase","Uroporphyrinogen","Synthase","Bilirubin_metabolism","Chlorin","Chlorophyll","Corrin","Cobalamin","Respiration_(physiology)"]}
