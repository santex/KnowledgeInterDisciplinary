{"cursor":"10110","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The history of life on Earth seems to show a clear trend; for example, it seems\nintuitive that there is a trend towards increasing complexity in living\norganisms. More recent organisms, such as mammals, appear to be much more\ncomplex than older organisms, such as bacteria. However, there are theoretical\nand empirical problems with this claim. From a theoretical perspective, it\nappears that there is no reason to expect evolution to result in any largest-\nscale trends, although small-scale trends, limited in time and space, are\nexpected (Gould, 1997). From an empirical perspective, it is difficult to\nmeasure complexity and, when it has been measured, the evidence does not support\na largest-scale trend (McShea, 1996).\n","linknr":130,"url":"Largest-scale_trends_in_evolution","recorded":1362483067,"links":11,"instances":["observational"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Evolutionary biology"],"headings":["Hypothetical largest-scale trends","History of the idea of evolutionary progress","Theoretical perspective","Empirical perspective","See also","Notes","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["artifact","observational"]],"members":["artifact"],"related":["Mammal","Bacteria","Theory","Empirical","Stephen_Jay_Gould","Entropy","Complexity","Alfred_Russel_Wallace","Herbert_Spencer","Teilhard_de_Chardin","Henri_Bergson","Charles_Darwin","Michael_Ruse","Francisco_J._Ayala","Brain","Hominid","Stephen_Jay_Gould","Largest-Scale_Trends_in_Evolution","Stephen_Jay_Gould","Artifact_(observational)","Selection","Mutation","Random_walk","Orthogenesis","Evolutionary_biology","Michael_Ruse","Stephen_Jay_Gould","Francisco_J._Ayala","Social_evolution","Korotayev"]}
