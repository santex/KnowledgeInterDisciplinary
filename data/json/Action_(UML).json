{"cursor":"2908","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nIn the Unified Modeling Language, an 'action' is a named element that is the\nfundamental unit of executable functionality. The execution of an action\nrepresents some transformation or processing in the modeled system. An action\nexecution represents the run-time behavior of executing an action within a\nspecific behavior execution. All action executions will be executions of\nspecific kinds of actions because Action is an abstract class. When the action\nexecutes, and what its actual inputs are, is determined by the concrete action\nand the behaviors in which it is used.\n\nAn action is the specification of an executable statement and is the fundamental\nunit of processing or behavior in an activity node that represents some\ntransformation in the modeled system.\n\nAn action forms an abstraction of a computational procedure which is an atomic\nexecution and therefore completes without interruption. An action is considered\nto take zero time and cannot be interrupted. In contrast, an activity is a more\ncomplex collection of behavior that may run for a long duration. An activity may\nbe interrupted by events, in which case, it does not run to completion.\n\nAn action is a result of a system state change, and is realized by sending a\nmessage to an object or modifying a link or a value of an attribute.\n\nAn action may receive inputs in the form of control flows and object flows (the\nlatter via input pins) and passes the results of its processing or\ntransformations to one or more outgoing control flows or object flows (the\nlatter via output pins) and onto downstream nodes.\n\nExecution of the action cannot begin until all its prerequisites are\nsatisfied. All incoming control flows have control tokens and all input pins\nhave object tokens.\n\nAn action refers to the suite of rules and policies associated with a state\nmachine state, and is represented as an object method.\n\nActions are contained within, and are provided context by activities.\n\nAn action behavior accompanies a transition event.\n","linknr":130,"url":"Action_(UML)","recorded":1362677372,"links":18,"instances":["computing","computer_science","programming","computer_science","program_lifecycle_phase","computer_science","uml","computer_science","graph_theory","geometry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Unified Modeling Language"],"headings":["Action types"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["transformation","geometry"],["run_time","program_lifecycle_phase"],["statement","programming"],["vertex","graph_theory"],["state","computer_science"],["object","computer_science"],["value","computer_science"],["attribute","computing"],["downstream","computer_science"],["state","computer_science"],["object","computer_science"],["event","uml"]],"members":["attribute","object","statement","value","run_time","downstream","event","state","vertex","transformation"],"related":["Unified_Modeling_Language","Named_element","Executable_functionality","Transformation_(geometry)","System","Run_time_(program_lifecycle_phase)","Behavior","Abstract_class","Specification","Executable","Statement_(programming)","Vertex_(graph_theory)","System","Abstraction","Atomic_operation","Execution","Complexity","Behavior","Result","System","State_(computer_science)","Message","Object_(computer_science)","Value_(computer_science)","Attribute_(computing)","Control_flow","Object_flow","Input_pin","Result","Control_flow","Object_flow","Output_pin","Downstream_(computer_science)","Execution","Control_flow","Control_token","Input_pin","Object_token","State_machine","State_(computer_science)","Object_(computer_science)","Behavior","Transition_event","Event_(UML)"]}
