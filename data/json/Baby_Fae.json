{"cursor":"4724","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Stephanie Fae Beauclair' (October 14, 1984 â November 15, 1984), better known\nas 'Baby Fae', was an American infant born in 1984 with hypoplastic left heart\nsyndrome. She became the first infant subject of a xenotransplant procedure,\nreceiving the heart of a baboon. The procedure, performed by Leonard L. Bailey\nat Loma Linda University Medical Center, was successful, but Fae died 21 days\nlater of heart failure due to rejection of the transplant. This was thought to\nbe caused largely in part by a humoral response against the graft, due to Fae's\ntype O blood creating antibodies against the type AB xenograft. This was seen as unavoidable as less than 1% of baboons are\ntype O and the donor baboon had to be chosen out of seven available young female\nbaboons, all of which were type AB. The transplant was hoped to be replaced by\nan allograft at a later date, but unfortunately a suitable donor could not be\nfound in time. The procedure was subject to a wide ethical and legal debate, but\nthe attention that it generated is thought to have paved the way for Bailey to\nperform the first successful infant allograft heart transplant a year later.\n\nThe Baby Fae case, and Bailey's role in it, has been a popular case study in the\nrealm of medical ethics. Bailey did not look for a human heart for Baby Fae.\nThere were questions as to whether parents should be allowed to volunteer\nchildren for experimental medical procedures, and whether the parents themselves\nwere properly informed by Bailey. However, because Fae's mother had no medical\ninsurance, she could not afford to pay for the heart transplant procedure. The\nxenograft, on the other hand, was offered for free. When asked why he had picked\na baboon over a primate more closely related to humans in evolution, he replied\n\"Er, I find that difficult to answer. You see, I don't believe in\nevolution.\" Charles Krauthammer, writing in [[Time\n(magazine)|Time]], said the Baby Fae case was totally within the realm of\nexperimentation and was \"an adventure in medical ethics.\" Charles Krauthammer,\n[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,923791,00.html Essay: The\nUsing of Baby Fae], Time, December 3, 1984, accessed May 28, 2013.\nUltimately, the American Medical Association and top medical journals criticized\nBailey, concluding that xenografts should be undertaken only as part of a\nsystematic research program with controls in randomized clinical trials.\n\nAlthough Fae's full name was not made public at the time of the procedure, her\nmother chose to reveal herself in 1997.\n","linknr":151,"url":"Baby_Fae","recorded":1374967102,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Baby_Fae&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Baby_Fae&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Infant","/wiki/Hypoplastic_left_heart_syndrome","/wiki/Xenotransplant","/wiki/Heart","/wiki/Baboon","/wiki/Leonard_L._Bailey","/wiki/Loma_Linda_University_Medical_Center","/wiki/Transplant_rejection","/wiki/Humoral_immunity","#cite_note-Bailey-1","/wiki/Medical_ethics","#cite_note-MedicalEthics-2","/wiki/Charles_Krauthammer","/wiki/Time_(magazine)","#cite_note-Time84-3","/wiki/American_Medical_Association","#cite_note-MedicalEthics-2","#cite_note-4","/w/index.php?title=Baby_Fae&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-Bailey_1-0","http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=402140","/wiki/Digital_object_identifier","http://dx.doi.org/10.1001","/wiki/PubMed_Identifier","//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2933538","#cite_ref-MedicalEthics_2-0","#cite_ref-MedicalEthics_2-1","/wiki/Gregory_Pence","http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~bwrobert/teaching/mm/articles/Pence2004_Ch14.pdf","#cite_ref-Time84_3-0","http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,923791,00.html","#cite_ref-4","http://www.abc.net.au/4corners/stories/s72726.htm","/w/index.php?title=Baby_Fae&action=edit&section=2","http://news.adventist.org/2009/10/surgeon-bailey-refle.html","http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,926947,00.html","http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wAJ6-fSD-Y","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2933538","/wiki/Journal_of_the_American_Medical_Association","/w/index.php?title=Baby_Fae&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/File:P_vip.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/69/P_vip.svg/28px-P_vip.svg.png","/wiki/Portal:Biography","http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=42791059","/wiki/Find_a_Grave","http://www.llu.edu/news/babyfae/index.page","/wiki/Template:LLUAHSC","/wiki/Template_talk:LLUAHSC","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:LLUAHSC&action=edit","/wiki/Loma_Linda_University_Adventist_Health_Sciences_Center","/wiki/Loma_Linda_University","/w/index.php?title=Loma_Linda_University_Faculty_of_Graduate_Studies&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Loma_Linda_University_School_of_Allied_Health_Professions","/wiki/Loma_Linda_University_School_of_Dentistry","/wiki/Loma_Linda_University_School_of_Medicine","/wiki/Loma_Linda_University","/wiki/Loma_Linda_University_School_of_Pharmacy","/wiki/Loma_Linda_University_School_of_Public_Health","/wiki/Loma_Linda_University_School_of_Religion","/wiki/Loma_Linda_University_School_of_Science_and_Technology","/wiki/Loma_Linda_University_Medical_Center","/w/index.php?title=Loma_Linda_University_Children%27s_Hospital&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Medical_Center_East_Campus&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Proton_Treatment_Center&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Loma_Linda_University_Heart_and_Surgical_Hospital&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Behavioral_Medicine_Center&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Loma_Linda_University_Health_Care&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Loma_Linda_University_School_of_Medicine","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","/wiki/File:Flag_of_the_United_States.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a4/Flag_of_the_United_States.svg/25px-Flag_of_the_United_States.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Baby_Fae&action=edit","/wiki/Template:US-bio-stub","/wiki/Template_talk:US-bio-stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:US-bio-stub&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Baby_Fae&oldid=561393276","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1984_births","/wiki/Category:1984_deaths","/wiki/Category:Organ_transplant_recipients","/wiki/Category:Loma_Linda_University","/wiki/Category:American_people_stubs","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Baby+Fae&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Baby+Fae","/wiki/Baby_Fae","/wiki/Talk:Baby_Fae","#","/wiki/Baby_Fae","/w/index.php?title=Baby_Fae&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=B
