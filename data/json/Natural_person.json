{"cursor":"1426","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In jurisprudence, a 'natural person' is a real human being, as opposed to a\nlegal person, which may be a private (i.e., business entity) or public (i.e.,\ngovernment) organization.\n\nIn many cases, fundamental human rights are implicitly granted only to natural\npersons. For example, the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States\nConstitution, which states a person cannot be denied the right to vote based on\ngender, or Section Fifteen of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which\nguarantees equality rights, apply to natural persons only. Another example of\nthe distinction between natural and legal persons is that a natural person can\nhold public office, but a corporation cannot. A corporation can, however, file a\nlawsuit or own property as a legal person.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Natural_person","recorded":1372154173,"links":[],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Legal terms","Legal entities","Personhood"],"headings":["Crime","References"],"image":[],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Jurisprudence","Legal_person","Business_entity","Government","Human_rights","Nineteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution","Section_Fifteen_of_the_Canadian_Charter_of_Rights_and_Freedoms","Lawsuit","Crime","Legal_person","Animal"]}
