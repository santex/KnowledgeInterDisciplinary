{"cursor":"24842","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Prediction markets' (also known as 'predictive markets', '[[information\nmarkets]]', 'decision markets', 'idea futures', 'event derivatives', or 'virtual\nmarkets') are speculative markets created for the purpose of making predictions.\nThe current market prices can then be interpreted as predictions of the\nprobability of the event or the expected value of the parameter. For example, a\nprediction market security might reward a dollar if a particular candidate is\nelected, such that an individual who thinks the candidate had a 70% chance of\nbeing elected should be willing to pay up to 70 cents for such a security.\n\nPeople who buy low and sell high are rewarded for improving the market\nprediction, while those who buy high and sell low are punished for degrading the\nmarket prediction. Evidence so far suggests that prediction markets are at least\nas accurate as other institutions predicting the same events with a similar pool\nof participants. Graefe, A. & Armstrong, J.S. (2011).
