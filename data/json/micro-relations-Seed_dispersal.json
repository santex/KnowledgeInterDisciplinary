{"cursor":"19120","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Seed dispersal' is the movement or transport of seeds away from the parent\nplant. Plants have limited mobility and consequently rely upon a variety of\ndispersal vectors to transport their propagules, including both abiotic and\nbiotic vectors. Seeds can be dispersed away from the parent plant individually\nor collectively, as well as dispersed in both space and time. The patterns of\nseed dispersal are determined in large part by the dispersal mechanism and this\nhas important implications for the demographic and genetic structure of plant\npopulations, as well as patterns and species interactions. There are five main\nmodes of seed dispersal: gravity, wind, ballistic, water and by animals. Some\nplants are serotinous and only disperse their seeds in response to an\nenvironmental stimulus. It can be measured using seed traps.\n","linknr":315,"url":"Seed_dispersal","recorded":1362567662,"links":31,"instances":["biology","flower_structure","ecology","fruit"],"pdf":["http://ebd06.ebd.csic.es/pdfs/Manzaneda.et.al.2005.Ecography.pdf","http://ebd06.ebd.csic.es/pdfs/Manzaneda.et.al.2005.Ecography.pdf"],"categories":["Seeds","Ecology"],"headings":["Benefits of seed dispersal","Types of dispersal","Consequences of seed dispersal","See also","Further reading","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/Photos-photos_1088103921_Floating.jpg/220px-Photos-photos_1088103921_Floating.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/43/Entada_phaseoloides_MHNT_graines.jpg/220px-Entada_phaseoloides_MHNT_graines.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/Geranium_sanguineum02.jpg/220px-Geranium_sanguineum02.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/Bur_Macro_BlackBg.jpg/220px-Bur_Macro_BlackBg.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/Epizoochoria_NRM.jpg/220px-Epizoochoria_NRM.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["competition","biology"],["pappus","flower_structure"],["samara","fruit"],["disturbance","ecology"]],"members":["competition","pappus","disturbance","samara"],"related":["Seed","Dispersal_vector","Abiotic","Biotic_component","Species","Gravitation","Serotinous","Seed_trap","Seed_predation","Pathogens","Competition_(biology)","Three-wattled_bellbird","Bellbird","Myrmecochory","Gravity","Apple","Coconut","Passionfruit","Trichome","Dandelions","Pappus_(flower_structure)","Maples","Samara_(fruit)","Germination","Seed","Mass","Weed","Ruderal","Tumbleweed","Water","Soil","Plant","Water","Nymphaeaceae","Plant","Flower","Fruit","Water","Root","Pond","Palm_tree","Ocean","Ocean_current","Continent","Mangrove","Water","Seed","Tree","Root","Water","Island","Root","Oceanic_dispersal","Human","Old_World","Clover","Hair","Seed","Apiaceae","Asteraceae","Habitats","Tapirs","Chimpanzees","Hornbills","Frugivore","Elaiosome","Secondary_metabolites","Humans","Invasive_species","Population","Janzen-Connell_hypothesis","Forest_migration","Biological_dispersal","Disturbance_(ecology)","Dormancy","Elaiosome","Gene_flow","Habitat_fragmentation","Island_hopping","Landscape_ecology","Metapopulation","Myrmecochory","Oceanic_dispersal","Population_ecology","Population_modeling"]}
