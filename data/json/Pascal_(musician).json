{"cursor":"2219","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Pascal' is the stage name of drum and bass DJ and producer 'Pascal Redpath'.\n\nLike many other producers in the genre, Pascal's involvement in drum and bass\ncame through a love of hip hop. From breaking to electro and honing his DJ\ntechnique through following DJ Cash Money and Jazzy Jeff, he went on to lay down\nhis own material onto a four track through cutting records on a pair of\nturntables.\n\nAlthough he had been dismissive of acid house, a close friend introduced him to\nthe rave scene in the early 1990s - drawn in by the hip hop samples and\ninfluences, which had crept into the music over time. From DJing he became\ninvolved in production; following the white label 'Fubar EP' with a couple of\nsingles as Bad Influence before eventually hooking up with Sponge to form Face\nRecords in 1992.\n\nHis first solo outing acted as testament to his skills as a producer, 'Johnny\nJungle' going on to be remixed often and a record influential to the 'dark'\nperiod which came to dominate the music of the time with its heavy sounds,\ntechnical percussives and horror film aesthetic. A series of singles led to 'The\nFace of the Future' album featuring artists such as Goldie and Alex Reece with\ntracks for Suburban Base raising his profile still further with 'Flammable',\n'Killa Sound' and 'Move On'.\n\nTwo years later saw an amicable split, Sponge going on to work with Marvellous\nCain at IQ and Pascal establishing his own Frontline imprint. The label was a\nsuccess, releasing its 50th record in the summer of 2000.\n","linknr":99,"url":"Pascal_(musician)","recorded":1374785515,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Pascal_(musician)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Pascal_(musician)&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Stage_name","/wiki/Drum_and_bass","/wiki/Disc_Jockey","/wiki/Record_producer","/wiki/Hip_hop_music","/wiki/Breakdance","/wiki/Electro_music","/wiki/DJ_Cash_Money","/wiki/DJ_Jazzy_Jeff","/wiki/Four_track","/wiki/Phonograph","/wiki/Acid_house","/wiki/Rave","/wiki/Sample_(music)","/wiki/White_label","/wiki/Sponge_(band)","/w/index.php?title=Face_Records&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Goldie","/wiki/Alex_Reece","/wiki/Suburban_Base","/w/index.php?title=Marvellous_Cain&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Frontline_Records_(1990s)&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Pascal_(musician)&action=edit&section=1","http://www.discogs.com/artist/Pascal","/wiki/Discogs","http://www.rolldabeats.com/artist/pascal","/wiki/Rolldabeats","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pascal_(musician)&oldid=536979125","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Drum_and_bass_musicians","/wiki/Category:Electronic_musicians","/wiki/Category:Living_people","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Pascal+%28musician%29&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Pascal+%28musician%29","/wiki/Pascal_(musician)","/wiki/Talk:Pascal_(musician)","#","/wiki/Pascal_(musician)","/w/index.php?title=Pascal_(musician)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Pascal_(musician)&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Pascal_(musician)","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Pascal_(musician)","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Pascal_(musician)&oldid=536979125","/w/index.php?title=Pascal_(musician)&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7141646","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Pascal_%28musician%29&id=536979125","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Pascal+%28musician%29","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Pascal+%28musician%29&oldid=536979125&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Pascal_(musician)&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7141646#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(musician)","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":["band","1990s","music"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Drum
