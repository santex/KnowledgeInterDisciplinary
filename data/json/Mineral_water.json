Mineral water may be \"sparkling\".\n\nTraditionally, mineral waters were used or consumed at their spring sources,\noften referred to as \"taking the waters\" or \"taking the cure,\" at developed\ncities such as spas, baths, or wells. The term spa was used for a place\nwhere the water was consumed and bathed in; bath where the water was used\nprimarily for bathing, therapeutics, or recreation; and well where the water\nwas to be consumed.\n\nActive tourist centres have grown up around many mineral water sites since\nancient times, such as Hungary, Hisarya (Bulgaria), BÃ­lina (Czech Republic),\nVichy (France), Jermuk (Armenia), Yessentuki (Russia), Spa (Belgium), Krynica-\nZdrÃ³j (Poland), Sulphur Baths (Tbilisi, Republic of Georgia), Bath (England), or\nKarlovy Vary (Czech Republic), Myrhorods'ka (Ukraine).

Travelling to the mineral water site for\ndirect access to the water is now uncommon, and in many cases not possible\n(because of exclusive commercial ownership rights).
