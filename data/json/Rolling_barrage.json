{"cursor":"30550","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" in 1915.]] A 'barrage' is a method of delivering massed artillery fire from a\n few or many batteries. Individual guns or howitzers are aimed at points,\n typically 20 - 30 yards apart, along one or more lines that can be from a few\n hundred to several thousand yards long. The lines are usually 100 yard apart\n and fire is lifted from one line to the next. The guns, etc, usually fired at a\n continuous steady rate using high explosive or shrapnel shells.\n\nBarrage fire may be defensive to deny or hamper enemy passage through an area\nor offensive to provide covering fire that neutralises the enemy in an area\nthrough which friendly forces are advancing. Defensive barrages are usually\nstatic (or standing or box). Offensive barrages move forward in front of the\nadvancing troops, the pattern of barrage movement may be creeping, rolling or\nblock. Barrage fire is not aimed at specific targets, it is aimed at areas in\nwhich there are known of expected targets. It contrasts with a concentration,\nin which the guns aim at a specific target in an area typically 150 to 250\nmetres diameter.\n\nThe barrage was developed by the British in the Second Boer War. It came to\nprominance in World War I, notably its use by the British Expeditionary force\nand particualry from late 1915 onwards when the British realised that the\nneutralising effects of artillery to provide covering fire were the key to\nbreaking into defensive positions. By late 1916 the creeping barrage was the\nstandard means of deploying artillery to support an infantry attack, with the\ninfantry following the advancing barrage as closely as possible. Its employment\nin this way recognised the importance of artillery fire in neutralising, rather\nthan destroying, the enemy. It was found that a moving barrage immediately\nfollowed by the infantry assault could be far more effective than weeks of\npreliminary bombardment.\n\nBarrages remained in use in World War II and later, but only as one of a variety\nof artillery tactics made possible by improvements in predicted fire, target\nlocation and communications.\n","linknr":319,"url":"Rolling_barrage","recorded":1362538065,"links":25,"instances":["world_war_i","royal_east_kent_regiment","1918","northumbrian_infantry_division","highland_infantry_division","united_states","1917","1917","united_kingdom","scottish_infantry_division","1917","north_africa"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Artillery operation","Military tactics","Salvo weapons"],"headings":["Development","Standing and box barrages","Advantages and drawbacks","World War I","World War II","Korean War and after","General use of the word","See also","Notes","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/German_Barrage_Fire_at_Night_%28Ypres%29.jpg/400px-German_Barrage_Fire_at_Night_%28Ypres%29.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/8inchShellsAustralianHeavyArtilleryMenYpres17October1917.jpeg/220px-8inchShellsAustralianHeavyArtilleryMenYpres17October1917.jpeg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/First_Battle_of_Passchendaele_-_barrage_map_%28colour_balance%29.jpg/220px-First_Battle_of_Passchendaele_-_barrage_map_%28colour_balance%29.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/23/Artillerycaen.jpg/220px-Artillerycaen.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/Artillery_Walking_barrage_illustration.jpg/220px-Artillery_Walking_barrage_illustration.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["shell","projectile"],["battle_of_messines","1917"],["buffs","royal_east_kent_regiment"],["western_desert","north_africa"],["british_expeditionary_force","world_war_i"],["50th","northumbrian_division"],["battle_of_megiddo","1918"],["shell","projectile#high-explosive"],["battle_of_arras","1917"],["battle_of_cambrai","1917"],["32nd_infantry_division","united_states"],["50th","northumbrian_infantry_division"],["51st","highland_infantry_division"],["15th","scottish_infantry_division"],["xxx_corps","united_kingdom"]],"members":["british_expeditionary_force","buffs","battle_of_megiddo","50th","51st","32nd_infantry_division","battle_of_arras","battle_of_messines","xxx_corps","shell","15th","battle_of_cambrai","western_desert"],"related":["Shell_(projectile)","Second_Boer_War","World_War_I","World_War_II","Predicted_fire","Second_Boer_War","Indirect_fire","Regiment","Brigade","Trench_warfare","Battle_of_Neuve_Chapelle","Battle_of_Messines_(1917)","Ordnance_QF_18_pounder","Shrapnel_shell","QF_4.5_inch_Howitzer","Buffs_(Royal_East_Kent_Regiment)","Battle_of_the_Somme","Nivelle_Offensive","Chemin_des_Dames","Stormtrooper","Spring_Offensive","Western_Desert_(North_Africa)","Francis_Tuker","Battle_of_Loos","Battle_of_the_Somme","No-man's_land","Fort_Vaux","Battle_of_Verdun","British_Expeditionary_Force_(World_War_I)","50th_(Northumbrian)_Division","Action_of_Tell_'Asur","Sinai_and_Palestine_Campaign","Battle_of_Megiddo_(1918)","Royal_Horse_Artillery","Battle_of_Arras_(1917)","Predicted_fire","Battle_of_Vimy_Ridge","Battle_of_Passchendaele","18-pounder","Georg_Bruchm√ºller","Spring_Offensive","Hindenburg_Line","Battle_of_Cambrai_(1917)","32nd_Infantry_Division_(United_States)","Second_battle_of_El_Alamein","2nd_New_Zealand_Division","25-pounder","Royal_School_of_Artillery","Larkhill","Western_Desert_campaign","Tunisia_Campaign","50th_(Northumbrian)_Infantry_Division","51st_(Highland)_Infantry_Division","Hitler_Line","I_Canadian_Corps","Operation_Overlord","15th_(Scottish)_Infantry_Division","Operation_Epsom","Operation_Veritable","XXX_Corps_(United_Kingdom)","High_explosive","Soviet_Union","Battle_of_Stalingrad","Korean_War","Battle_of_Pork_Chop_Hill","Horseshoe","Vietnam_War","Falklands_War","42_Commando","Royal_Marines","Battle_of_Mount_Harriet","MILAN","Reuters","Baghdad","Broadside","Salvo","Fusillade","John_J._Pershing"]}
