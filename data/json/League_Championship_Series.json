In 1981, and since 1995, the two annual series have matched up the winners\nof the Division Series, and the winners advance to meet in the World Series.\n2008 Game 3 between the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Philadelphia Phillies played\nat Dodger Stadium ]]\n\nThe League Championship Series was promulgated in 1969, when both the National\nLeague and the American League increased in size from ten teams to twelve with\nthe addition, via expansion, of the Montreal Expos and San Diego Padres to the\nformer and the Kansas City Royals and Seattle Pilots (now the Milwaukee Brewers\nof the NL) to the latter. Concomitant with this, both leagues formed Eastern and\nWestern Divisions, the first-place teams from which faced off in the LCS.\n\nOriginally, the League Championship Series were best-of-five using the 2â3\nformat in which the team without home field advantage hosted the first two games\nand the team with it hosted the remaining game(s), making it impossible for the\ndisadvantage team to win the series at home. It also allowed those teams the\nunusual luxury of starting a series at home, possibly having home field\nadvantage in a three game series, and a guarantee that they play the maximum\nnumber of games possible at home (2).\n\nIn 1985.

The\ndisadvantage team would have had more games played at home than on the road if\nthe series ends in five games.\n\nSince 1995 the LCS has matched up the winners of the Division Series, which were\nadded when both leagues realigned into three divisions, the winners thereof plus\none wild card team in each league participating in the latter series, which is a\nbest-of-five (this change was actually supposed to take place in 1994, but\npostseason play was not held in that year due to a players' strike).\n\nUntil 1998, the home-field advantage in the LCS was allocated on a rotating\nbasis between the two (and from 1995 through 1997, among the three) division\nchampions; since 1998 the team with the better record has had this advantage,\nexcept that in no case can the wild card ever secure the extra home game,\nregardless of regular-season records.\n\nAs of }}, all 30 MLB teams have reached the LCS at least once.\n","linknr":135,"url":"League_Championship_Series","recorded":1375076463,"links":["/w/index.php?title=League_Championship_Series&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=League_Championship_Series&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason","/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_wild-card_game","/wiki/Division_Series","/wiki/American_League_Division_Series","/wiki/National_League_Division_Series","/wiki/American_League_Championship_Series","/wiki/National_League_Championship_Series","/wiki/World_Series","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=League_Championship_Series&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Template:Citation_needed","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/Semifinal","/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason","/wiki/Major_League_Baseball","/wiki/1969_in_baseball","/wiki/1981_in_baseball","/wiki/1995_in_baseball","/wiki/Division_Series","/wiki/World_Series","/wiki/File:NLCS_2008.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/84/NLCS_2008.jpg/300px-NLCS_2008.jpg","/wiki/File:NLCS_2008.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/2008_National_League_Championship_Series","/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers","/wiki/Philadelphia_Phillies","/wiki/Dodger_Stadium","/wiki/National_League","/wiki/American_League","/wiki/Washington_Nationals","/wiki/San_Diego_Padres","/wiki/Kansas_City_Royals","/wiki/Milwaukee_Brewers","/wiki/Best-of-five_playoff","/wiki/Home_field_advantage","/wiki/1985_in_baseball","#cite_note-1","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Best-of-seven_playoff","/wiki/Wild_card_(sports)","/wiki/Best-of-five_playoff","/wiki/1994_in_baseball","/wiki/1994_Major_League_Baseball_strike","/wiki/1998_in_baseball","/wiki/1997_in_baseball","/wiki/2013_in_baseball","/w/index.php?title=League_Championship_Series&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=OmEeAAAAIBAJ&sjid=R8gEAAAAIBAJ&pg=4792,5236055&dq=expand+league+championship+to+best+of+7&hl=en","/wiki/Pittsburgh_Post-Gazette","#cite_ref-2","http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=rQEtAAAAIBAJ&sjid=i84FAAAAIBAJ&pg=3112,2384593&dq=expand+league+championship+to+best+of+7&hl=en","/wiki/Palm_Beach_Post","/w/index.php?title=League_Championship_Series&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/National_League_Championship_Series","/wiki/American_League_Championship_Series","/wiki/League_Championship_Series_Most_Valuable_Player_Award","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=League_Championship_Series&oldid=554119484","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Major_League_Baseball_playoffs_and_champions","/wiki/Category:National_League_Championship_Series","/wiki/Category:American_League_Championship_Series","/wiki/Category:Recurring_sporting_events_established_in_1969","/wiki/Category:Articles_needing_additional_references_from_May_2013","/wiki/Category:All_articles_needing_additional_references","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=League+Championship+Series&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=League+Championship+Series","/wiki/League_Championship_Series","/wiki/Talk:League_Championship_Series","#","/wiki/League_Championship_Series","/w/index.php?title=League_Championship_Series&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=League_Championship_Series&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/League_Championship_Series","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/League_Championship_Series","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:Spec
