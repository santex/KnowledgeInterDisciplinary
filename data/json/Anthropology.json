Wolf, Eric (1994)\nPerilous Ideas: Race, Culture, People. [[Current Anthropology]] 35: 1-7.\np.227 The term \"\" is from the Greek anthrÅpos (), \"man\", understood to\nmean humankind or humanity, and [[wiktionary:-logia|-logia]] (-Î»Î¿Î³Î¯Î±),\n\"discourse\" or \"study.\"\n\nSince the work of Franz Boas and BronisÅaw Malinowski in the late 19th and early\n20th centuries, anthropology has been distinguished from other social sciences\nby its emphasis on in-depth examination of context, cross-cultural comparisons,\nand the importance it places on participant-observation, or long-term,\nexperiential immersion in the area of research. Cultural anthropology in\nparticular has emphasized cultural relativism, holism, and the use of findings\nto frame cultural critiques. Hylland\nEriksen, Thomas. (2004) \"What is Anthropology\" Pluto. London. p. 79. This\nhas been particularly prominent in the United States, from Boas's arguments\nagainst 19th-century racial ideology, through Margaret Mead's advocacy for\ngender equality and sexual liberation, to current criticisms of post-colonial\noppression and promotion of multiculturalism. Ethnography is one of its primary\nmethods as well as the text that is generated from anthropological\nfieldwork. On varieties of\ncultural relativism in anthropology, see Spiro, Melford E. (1987) \"Some\nReflections on Cultural Determinism and Relativism with Special Reference to\nEmotion and Reason,\" in Culture and Human Nature: theoretical papers of Melford\nE. Spiro. Edited by B. Kilborne and L. L. Langness, pp. 32-58. Chicago:\nUniversity of Chicago Press.\n\nIn the United States, the discipline is traditionally divided into four fields:\ncultural anthropology, archaeology, linguistic anthropology, and biological\nanthropology. In Europe, the discipline originated as ethnology and was\noriginally defined as the study of social organization in non-state societies.\nIt was later renamed social anthropology. It is now sometimes referred to as\nsociocultural anthropology in most of Europe, the Commonwealth, and in the parts\nof the world that were influenced by the European tradition.
