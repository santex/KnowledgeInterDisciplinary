{"cursor":"30385","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nThis is a 'list of [[Act of Parliament|Acts]] of the [[Parliament of England]]\nfor the years 1603–1641'.\n\nFor Acts passed during the period 1707–1800 see List of Acts of the\nParliament of Great Britain. See also the List of Acts of the Parliament of\nScotland and the List of Acts of the Parliament of Ireland.\n\nFor Acts passed from 1801 onwards see List of Acts of the Parliament of the\nUnited Kingdom. For Acts of the devolved parliaments and assemblies in the\nUnited Kingdom, see the List of Acts of the Scottish Parliament from 1999, the\nList of Acts of the Northern Ireland Assembly, and the List of Acts and Measures\nof the National Assembly for Wales; see also the List of Acts of the Parliament\nof Northern Ireland.\n\nFor medieval statutes, etc. that are not considered to be Acts of Parliament,\nsee the List of English statutes.\n\nThe number shown after each Act's title is its chapter number. Acts are cited\nusing this number, preceded by the year(s) of the reign during which the\nrelevant parliamentary session was held; thus the Union with Ireland Act 1800 is\ncited as \"39 & 40 Geo. 3 c. 67\", meaning the 67th Act passed during the session\nthat started in the 39th year of the reign of George III and which finished in\nthe 40th year of that reign. Note that the modern convention is to use Arabic\nnumerals in citations (thus \"41 Geo. 3\" rather than \"41 Geo. III\"). Note also\nthat Acts of the last session of the Parliament of Great Britain and the first\nsession of the Parliament of the United Kingdom are both cited as \"41 Geo. 3\".\n\nActs passed by the Parliament of England did not have a short title; however,\nsome of these Acts have subsequently been given a short title by Acts of the\nParliament of the United Kingdom (such as the Short Titles Act 1896).\n\nActs passed by the Parliament of England were deemed to have come into effect on\nthe first day of the session in which they were passed. Because of this, the\nyears given in the list below may in fact be the year before a particular Act\nwas passed.\n\nSee also the List of Ordinances and Acts of the Parliament of England, 1642â1660\nfor Ordinances and Acts passed by the Long Parliament and other bodies without\nroyal assent, and which were not considered to be valid legislation following\nthe Restoration in 1660.\n","linknr":332,"url":"List_of_Acts_of_Parliament_of_the_English_Parliament,_1603_to_1641","recorded":1375055835,"links":["/w/index.php?title=List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_England,_1603%E2%80%931641&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_England,_1603%E2%80%931641&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_England,_1603%E2%80%931641","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","/w/index.php?title=List_of_Acts_of_Parliament_of_the_English_Parliament,_1603_to_1641&redirect=no","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Parliament_of_England","/wiki/Parliament_of_Scotland","/wiki/Parliament_of_Ireland","/wiki/Parliament_of_Great_Britain","/wiki/Legislation","/wiki/Act_of_Parliament","/wiki/Kingdom_of_England","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_England_to_1483","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_England,_1485%E2%80%931601","/wiki/List_of_Ordinances_and_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_England,_1642%E2%80%931660","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_England,_1660%E2%80%931699","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_England,_1700%E2%80%931706","/wiki/List_of_English_statutes","/wiki/Kingdom_of_Ireland","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_Ireland_to_1700","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_Ireland,_1701%E2%80%931800","/wiki/Kingdom_of_Scotland","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_Scotland_to_1707","/wiki/Kingdom_of_Great_Britain","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_Great_Britain,_1707%E2%80%931719","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_Great_Britain,_1720%E2%80%931739","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_Great_Britain,_1740%E2%80%931759","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_Great_Britain,_1760%E2%80%931779","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_Great_Britain,_1780%E2%80%931800","/wiki/Act_of_Parliament","/wiki/Parliament_of_England","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_Great_Britain","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_Scotland_to_1707","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_Ireland","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Scottish_Parliament_from_1999","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Northern_Ireland_Assembly","/wiki/List_of_Acts_and_Measures_of_the_National_Assembly_for_Wales","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_Northern_Ireland","/wiki/List_of_English_statutes","/wiki/Parliamentary_session","/wiki/Acts_of_Union_1800","/wiki/Arabic_numeral","/wiki/Short_title","/wiki/Short_Titles_Act_1896","/wiki/List_of_Ordinances_and_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_England,_1642%E2%80%931660","/wiki/Long_Parliament","/wiki/Royal_assent","/wiki/English_Restoration","#1603-1610","#1603_.281_Jas._1.29","#Public_Acts","#Private_Acts","#1605_.283_Jas._1.29","#Public_Acts_2","#Private_Acts_2","#1606_.284_Jas._1.29","#Public_Acts_3","#Private_Acts_3","#1609_.287_Jas._1.29","#Public_Acts_4","#Private_Acts_4","#1611-1620","#1620_.2818_.26_19_Jas._1.29","#Public_Acts_5","#1621-1630","#1623_.2821_Jas._1.29","#Public_Acts_6","#Private_Acts_5","#1625_.281_Chas._1.29","#Public_Acts_7","#Private_Acts_6","#1627_.283_Chas._1.29","#Public_Acts_8","#Private_Acts_7","#1631-1640","#1640_.2816_Chas._1.29","#Public_Acts_9","#Private_Acts_8","#References","/w/index.php?title=List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_England,_1603%E2%80%931641&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_England,_1603%E2%80%931641&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_England,_1603%E2%80%931641&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/Succession_to_the_Crown_Act_1603","/wiki/Union_of_England_and_Scotland_Act_1603","/wiki/Statute_of_Stabbing","/wiki/Bigamy_Act_1603","/wiki/Witchcraft_Acts#Witchcraft_Act_1604","/wiki/Privilege_of_Parliament_Act_1603","/wiki/Parliamentary_Privilege_Act_1603","/w/index.php?title=List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_England,_1603%E2%80%931641&action=edit&section=4","/wiki/Adam_Newton_(dean)","/w/index.php?title=List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_England,_1603%E2%80%931641&action=edit&section=5","/w/index.php?title=List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_England,_1603%E2%80%931641&action=edit&section=6","/wiki/Observance_of_5th_November_Act_1605","/wiki/Popish_Recusants_Act_1605","/wiki/Presentation_of_Benefices_Act_1605","/w/index.php?title
