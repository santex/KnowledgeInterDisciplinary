Aristotle did not consider all\npossibilities the same, and emphasized the importance of those that become real\nof their own accord when conditions are right and nothing stops\nthem. . Actuality, in contrast to potentiality, is the motion, change\nor activity that represents an exercise or fulfillment of a possibility, when a\npossibility becomes real in the fullest sense.\n\nThese concepts, in modified forms, remained very important into the middle ages,\ninfluencing the development of medieval theology in several ways. Going further\ninto modern times, while the understanding of nature (and, according to some\ninterpretations, deity) implied by the dichotomy lost importance, the\nterminology has found new uses, developing indirectly from the old. This is most\nobvious in words like \"energy\" and \"dynamic\" (words brought into modern physics\nby Leibniz) but also in examples such as the biological concept of an\n\"entelechy\".\n","linknr":643,"url":"Energeia","recorded":1362374681,"links":31,"instances":["philosophy","psychology","algebra","philosophy","philosophy_and_religion","physics","philosophy","mathematics","aristotle"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Aristotelianism","Causality","Concepts in metaphysics","Dichotomies","Modality","Possibility","Natural philosophy","Scholasticism","Reality"],"headings":["Potentiality","Actuality","Motion","The importance of actuality in Aristotle's philosophy","The active intellect","Post-Aristotelian usage","See also","References","Bibliography","Old translations of Aristotle","Translations of Leibniz"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Aristoteles_Louvre.jpg/100px-Aristoteles_Louvre.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cf/Socrates_blue_version2.png/20px-Socrates_blue_version2.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9f/Carrara_7.JPG/250px-Carrara_7.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6a/Gottfried_Wilhelm_von_Leibniz.jpg/250px-Gottfried_Wilhelm_von_Leibniz.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["motion","physics"],["psyche","psychology"],["nature","philosophy"],["nature","philosophy"],["nature","philosophy"],["accident","philosophy"],["motion","physics"],["motion","physics"],["telos","philosophy"],["telos","philosophy"],["nature","philosophy"],["rhetoric","aristotle"],["accident","philosophy"],["product","mathematics"],["square","algebra"],["hypostasis","philosophy_and_religion"]],"members":["accident","psyche","square","nature","hypostasis","motion","telos","product","rhetoric"],"related":["Philosophy","Dichotomy","Aristotle","Motion_(physics)","Four_causes","Aristotelian_ethics","Physiology","Psyche_(psychology)","Middle_ages","Medieval_theology","Nature_(philosophy)","Deity","Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz","Ancient_Greek","Latin","English_language","Early_modern","Hobbes","John_Locke","Nature_(philosophy)","Perseus_project","Nature_(philosophy)","Four_causes","Substance_theory","Accident_(philosophy)","Energy","History_of_science","Joe_Sachs","Pleasure","Happiness","Eudaimonia","Motion_(physics)","Motion_(physics)","Entelechy","Ancient_Greek","Latin","Hexis","Telos_(philosophy)","Modern_science","Carrara","Perseus_project","Telos_(philosophy)","Teleology","Four_causes","Reason","Teleology","Theory_of_forms","Formal_cause","Substance_theory","Material_cause","Nature_(philosophy)","Light","Knowledge","Unmoved_mover","God","Rhetoric_(Aristotle)","Polybius","Diodorus_Siculus","Vigor","Energy","Plotinus","Monotheism","Aristotle","Plato","Monotheism","Monism","The_Good","Theory_of_Forms","Emanation","Soul","Cosmos","Unmoved_Mover","Eastern_Orthodox","Gregory_Palamas","Essence","Asceticism","Hesychasm","Thomas_Aquinas","Pure_act","Contemporary_philosophy","Modal_logic","Scholastics","William_of_Ockham","John_Duns_Scotus","Essence","Accident_(philosophy)","Early_modern","Thomas_Hobbes","Energy","Physics","Product_(mathematics)","Mass","Square_(algebra)","Velocity","Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz","Descartes","Galileo","Conservation_of_energy","Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz","Descartes","Potential","Kinetic_energy","Thomism","Statics","Potential_energy","Metaphysics","Physics","Life","Soul","Monadology","Perception","Monadology","German_Idealism","Self-fulfillment","Vitalism","Hans_Driesch","Kenneth_Burke","Terministic_screen","Actual_infinity","Actus_Purus","Alexander_of_Aphrodisias","First_cause","Henosis","Hylomorphism","Hypostasis_(philosophy_and_religion)","Metaxy","Ontology","Ousia","Sumbebekos","Theosis","Unmoved_movers","Perseus_Project"]}
