He was educated at Rishworth School, West Yorkshire,\nand, after a time working as a railway booking clerk, he went to Leeds\nUniversity where he was awarded 1st Class BA in English in 1924 and a PhD in\n1926. His PhD thesis was on the place-names of the North Riding and the study of\nplace-names remained of continuing interest to him, resulting in several\npublications. He was Vaughan Fellow at Leeds University from 1924 to 1926, and\nwas then lecturer in English at Saltley College, Birmingham from 1926 to 1928.\nIn 1928 he went to Sweden and was English lecturer at Uppsala University,\nreturning to England in 1930 to University College London (UCL) as a lecturer\nand reader. In 1937 he was awarded a DLit degree at London University. During\nWorld War II, he enlisted in the RAF as an intelligence officer and in 1941\njoined the Scientific Intelligence Unit of the Air Ministry under R V Jones,\nending with the rank of Wing Commander. He was awarded the OBE for his war-time\nwork in 1947. In 1949 he succeeded Raymond Wilson Chambers as Quain Professor of\nEnglish at University College London. One of his successors was his former\nstudent Randolph Quirk. He was director of Scandinavian studies at UCL from 1946\nto 1963. In 1951 he took over the Survey of English PlaceâNames, on which work\nhad virtually ceased during the war.\n\nHe produced a large number of publications and was also joint editor of\nMethuenâs series of Old English Library and of the Early English Texts Society's\nFacsimile of The Parker Chronicle and Laws 1941. His interests beyond literature\nincluded cricket, horology and mechanical engineering. He built a printing press\nto demonstrate bibliographical problems, but it was destroyed in the bombing of\nUCL during the war.\n\nHe was described in his obituary in the Times as \"a most lovable character who\nappeared to be of more than human stature. He could be maddening alike in\nmatters of scholarship and in personal relations, though one's irritation never\nlasted long\". Randolph Quirk (as RQ) in a follow-up letter referred particularly\nto his \"hospitality and loyalty\".\n\nHe married in 1928 Helen Penelope Tomlinson the daughter of Charles Herbert\nTomlinson, grocer of Solihull, and Lucy Florence Tomlinson (nÃ©e Wilson). They\nhad two children.\n","linknr":117,"url":"Albert_Hugh_Smith","recorded":1374963042,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Albert_Hugh_Smith&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Albert_Hugh_Smith&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Order_of_the_British_Empire","/wiki/Old_English_language","/wiki/North_Germanic_languages","/wiki/British_toponymy","/wiki/Butler","/wiki/Sowerby,_West_Yorkshire","/wiki/Rishworth_School","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/wiki/University_of_Leeds","/wiki/Toponymy","/wiki/Saltley_College","/wiki/Birmingham","/wiki/Sweden","/wiki/Uppsala_University","/wiki/University_College_London","/wiki/World_War_II","/wiki/Royal_Air_Force","/wiki/Air_Ministry","/wiki/Reginald_Victor_Jones","/wiki/Raymond_Wilson_Chambers","/wiki/Quain_Professor","/wiki/Randolph_Quirk,_Baron_Quirk","/wiki/Scandinavian_studies","/wiki/University_College_London","/wiki/Cricket","/wiki/Horology","/wiki/University_College_London","/w/index.php?title=Albert_Hugh_Smith&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/North_Riding_of_Yorkshire","/wiki/East_Riding_of_Yorkshire","/wiki/West_Riding_of_Yorkshire","/wiki/Gloucestershire","/wiki/Westmorland","/w/index.php?title=Albert_Hugh_Smith&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/The_Times","/wiki/Peter_Foote","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/66601796","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Albert_Hugh_Smith&oldid=548335606","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1903_births","/wiki/Category:1967_deaths","/wiki/Category:English_philologists","/wiki/Category:Alumni_of_the_University_of_Leeds","/wiki/Category:Toponymists","/wiki/Category:Scholars_of_Old_Norse_and_Scandinavian_studies","/wiki/Category:Academics_of_University_College_London","/wiki/Category:All_articles_with_unsourced_statements","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_unsourced_statements_from_February_2012","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Albert+Hugh+Smith&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Albert+Hugh+Smith","/wiki/Albert_Hugh_Smith","/wiki/Talk:Albert_Hugh_Smith","#","/wiki/Albert_Hugh_Smith","/w/index.php?title=Albert_Hugh_Smith&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Albert_Hugh_Smith&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Albert_Hugh_Smith","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Albert_Hugh_Smith","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Albert_Hugh_Smith&oldid=548335606","/w/index.php?title=Albert_Hugh_Smith&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4710506","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Albert_Hugh_Smith&id=548335606","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Albert+Hugh+Smith","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Albert+Hugh+Smith&oldid=548335606&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Albert_Hugh_Smith&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4710506#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Hugh_Smith","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/
