He played with the 1888â89 New Zealand Native\nfootball team, and represented New Zealand in 1893, and once in 1896 â where he\ncaptained the side.\n\nGage was born in Kihikhi, New Zealand to a MÄori mother, and British born\nfather. After an early education in Auckland, he was awarded a scholarship to\nattend Te Aute College in the Hawke's Bay. After joining the Poneke Football\nClub of fellow Te Aute old-boy Thomas Ellison in 1887, he made his provincial\ndebut for Wellington in that same year. It was probably at Ellison's suggestion\nthat he was selected for Joe Warbrick's Native Football team that toured New\nZealand, Australia, and Britain in 1888 and 1889.\n\nGage played in 68 of the Natives side's 74 matches when in Britain, and appeared\nin their fixtures against Ireland, Wales, and England. The 74 British Isles\nmatches were played within six months, averaging a match every 2.3 days, and the\nNatives' team often struggled to field a fit side. He could play anywhere in the\nbacks, and ended up appearing in every back-line position despite originally\nbeing selected as a fullback. When the Natives toured Australia after the\nBritish Isles leg of their tour, Gage returned to New Zealand due to an ill\nrelative. He did turn out for the team once they returned to New Zealand\nhowever, when he played a further five matches.\n\nAfter returned in Wellington, Gage continued playing for Poneke, and represented\nWellington in 1889. The following season, the Wellington Rugby Union (WRU) â who\nadministered the sport in the city â decided that Gage was ineligible for\nselection in the provincial team. Poneke responded by withdrawing from the club\ncompetition, and the exclusion of any Poneke players weakened the Wellington\nside considerably. Hawke's Bay hosted Wellington that season, and Gage was\neligible for the Bay side after playing several club games in the region;\ndespite the opportunity to \"get even\" with the Wellington authorities, he\ndeclined to play for Hawke's Bay.}} 1891 and 1892 saw Gage return to the\nWellington side, and he was then selected for the first representative New\nZealand side organised under the authority of the New Zealand Rugby Football\nUnion. The New Zealand team toured Australia in 1893, and was captained by\nGage's Poneke and Wellington team-mate Ellison. He was again selected for New\nZealand in 1896, this time captaining the team against Queensland in Wellington.\nDuring his rugby career, which ended in 1901, Gage amassed 131 first-class\nappearances â an enormous number for the time.\n\nGage worked as both a MÄori interpreter, and later for the Wellington City\nCouncil. Following Gage's death from tuberculosis at age 48, the Poneke Club\nraised money to pay for a headstone, and support his widow and six children.\nFormer Poneke and Wellington captain Sid Nicholls said of him:
