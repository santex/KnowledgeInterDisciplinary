{"cursor":"8757","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nAn 'unsaturated fat' is a fat or fatty acid in which there is at least one\ndouble bond within the fatty acid chain. A fatty acid chain is monounsaturated\nif it contains one double bond, and polyunsaturated if it contains more than one\ndouble bond. Where double bonds are formed, hydrogen atoms are eliminated. Thus,\na saturated fat has no double bonds, has the maximum number of hydrogens bonded\nto the carbons, and therefore is \"saturated\" with hydrogen atoms. In cellular\nmetabolism, unsaturated fat molecules contain somewhat less energy (i.e., fewer\ncalories) than an equivalent amount of saturated fat. The greater the degree of\nunsaturation in a fatty acid (i.e., the more double bonds in the fatty acid) the\nmore vulnerable it is to lipid peroxidation (rancidity). Antioxidants can\nprotect unsaturated fat from lipid peroxidation.\n","linknr":332,"url":"Unsaturated_fat","recorded":1362585384,"links":34,"instances":["fruit","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Food science","Carboxylic acids","Fatty acids|#","Lipids","Nutrition"],"headings":["Chemistry and nutrition","Role of dietary fats in insulin resistance","Membrane composition as a metabolic enabler","Component in different foods","References","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/94/Fatchart.svg/220px-Fatchart.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/90/Fat_composition_in_foods.png/260px-Fat_composition_in_foods.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cell","biology"],["nut","fruit"]],"members":["nut","cell"],"related":["Fat","Fatty_acid","Double_bond","Monounsaturated_fat","Polyunsaturated","Hydrogen","Atom","Saturated_fat","Metabolism","Calories","Lipid_peroxidation","Rancidification","Antioxidant","Double_bond","Cis-trans_isomerism","Molecular_geometry","Conformational_isomerism","Hydrogen","Trans_fat","Saturated_fat","Food_preservation","Temperature","Cell_(biology)","Cell_membrane","Cholesterol","Low-density_lipoprotein","Blood","Stereochemistry","Atheroma","Molecule","Fatty_acid","Cardiac_arrhythmia","Menopause","Coronary","Atherosclerosis","Lipid_peroxidation","Vitamin_E","Palmitoleic_acid","Oleic_acid","Myristoleic_acid","Linoleic_acid","Arachidonic_acid","Avocado","Nut_(fruit)","Vegetable_oil","Canola","Olive_oil","Meat","Food_and_Drug_Administration","Saturated_fat","Insulin_resistance","Arachidonic_acid","Arachidic_acid","Phospholipid","Skeletal_muscle","Inflammation","Health_effects_of_polyphenols","Biology","Cell_membrane","Mammal","Docosahexaenoic_acid","Omega-3_fatty_acid","Reptile","Metabolism","Warm-blooded","Species","Fish","Temperature","Saturated_fat","Monounsaturated_fat","Polyunsaturated_fat","Trans_fat","Iodine_number"]}
