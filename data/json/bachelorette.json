When\nused now, it tends to imply that the woman has never been married and is too old\nto find a marriage and have children. A bachelorette may have previously been in\na relationship.\n\nIn Canada, the term bachelorette also refers to a small bachelor apartment. The\nterm bachelor apartment, used in Canada and South Africa, refers to an apartment\nwith only one large room serving as a bedroom and living room plus a separate\nbathroom (see studio apartment).\n",
