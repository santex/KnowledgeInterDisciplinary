They describe the relationship between the forces acting on\na body and its motion due to those forces. They have been expressed in several\ndifferent ways over nearly three centuries, For explanations of Newton's\nlaws of motion by Newton in the early 18th century, by the physicist William\nThomson (Lord Kelvin) in the mid-19th century, and by a modern text of the early\n21st century, see:- *Newton's \"Axioms or Laws of Motion\" starting on\n[http://books.google.com/books?id=Tm0FAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA19#v=onepage&q=&f=false page\n19 of volume 1 of the 1729 translation] of the \"Principia\";\n*[http://books.google.com/books?id=wwO9X3RPt5kC&pg=PA178 Section 242, Newton's\nlaws of motion] in Thomson, W (Lord Kelvin), and Tait, P G, (1867), Treatise on\nnatural philosophy, volume 1; and *Benjamin Crowell (2000), ''Newtonian\nPhysics''. and can be summarized as follows:\n# 'First law': If there is no net force on an object, then its velocity is\n# constant. The object is either at rest (if its velocity is equal to zero), or\n# it moves with constant speed in a single direction. 'Second law': The acceleration\n# 'a' of a body is parallel and directly proportional to the net force 'F'\n# acting on the body, is in the direction of the net force, and is inversely\n# proportional to the mass m of the body, i.e., 'F' = m'a'.","linknr":618,"url":"Newton's_laws_of_motion","recorded":1362685020,"links":110,"instances":["physics","geometry","physics","physics","physics","physics","physics","physics","mechanics"],"pdf":["http://ia310114.us.archive.org/2/items/newtonspmathema00newtrich/newtonspmathema00newtrich.pdf","http://www.ce.berkeley.edu/~coby/plas/pdf/book.pdf","http://www.ce.berkeley.edu/~coby/plas/pdf/book.pdf"],"categories":["Classical
