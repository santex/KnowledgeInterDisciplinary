Cacao has been cultivated for at least three\nmillennia in Mexico, Central America and Northern South America. Its earliest\ndocumented use is around 1100 BC. The majority of the Mesoamerican people made\nchocolate beverages, including the Aztecs, who made it into a beverage known as\n[[Aztec cuisine|xocolÄtl]] , a Nahuatl word meaning \"bitter water\". The seeds\nof the cacao tree have an intense bitter taste, and must be fermented to\ndevelop the flavor.\n\nAfter fermentation, the beans are dried, then cleaned, and then roasted, and the\nshell is removed to produce cacao nibs. The nibs are then ground to cocoa mass,\npure chocolate in rough form. Because this cocoa mass usually is liquefied then\nmolded with or without other ingredients, it is called chocolate liquor. The\nliquor also may be processed into two components: cocoa solids and cocoa butter.\nUnsweetened baking chocolate (bitter chocolate) contains primarily cocoa solids\nand cocoa butter in varying proportions. Much of the chocolate consumed today is\nin the form of sweet chocolate, combining cocoa solids, cocoa butter or other\nfat, and sugar. Milk chocolate is sweet chocolate that additionally contains\nmilk powder or condensed milk. White chocolate contains cocoa butter, sugar, and\nmilk but no cocoa solids.\n\nCocoa solids contain alkaloids such as theobromine and phenethylamine, which\nhave physiological effects on the body. It has been linked to serotonin levels\nin the brain. Some research found that chocolate, eaten in moderation, can\nlower blood pressure. The presence of theobromine\nrenders chocolate toxic to some animals, especially\ndogs and cats.\n\nChocolate has become one of the most popular food types and flavors in the\nworld. Chocolate chip cookies have become very common, and very popular, in most\nparts of Europe and North America. Gifts of chocolate molded into different\nshapes have become traditional on certain holidays. Chocolate is also used in\ncold and hot beverages, to produce chocolate milk and hot chocolate.\n\nCocoa mass was used originally in Mesoamerica both as a beverage and as an\ningredient in foods. Chocolate played a special role in both Maya and Aztec\nroyal and religious events. Priests presented cacao seeds as offerings to the\ndeities and served chocolate drinks during sacred ceremonies. All of the areas\nthat were conquered by the Aztecs that grew cacao beans were ordered to pay them\nas a tax, or as the Aztecs called it, a \"tribute\". Justin Kerr. \n\nThe Europeans sweetened and fattened it by adding refined sugar and milk, two\ningredients unknown to the Mexicans. By contrast, the Europeans never infused it\ninto their general diet, but have compartmentalized its use to sweets and\ndesserts. In the 19th century, Briton John Cadbury developed an emulsification\nprocess to make solid chocolate, creating the modern chocolate bar. Although\ncocoa is originally from the Americas, today Western Africa produces almost two-\nthirds of the world's cocoa, with CÃ´te d'Ivoire growing almost half of it.\n","linknr":1142,"url":"Chocolate","recorded":1362892069,"links":159,"instances":["symbol","materials_science","confectionery","taste","cocoa_bean","medical","city","food"],"pdf":["http://api.ning.com/files/Gr6vd-Aqjs2vj5t4p5tX-cZBB1kpTzKVDk8I59vVV6*FgB5zFYsVooD0wRRlQHO8tNMURHMwKR5hmuPX2Pe3al3iWOhcsi5S/Makingchocolatefromscratch.pdf","http://api.ning.com/files/Gr6vd-Aqjs2vj5t4p5tX-cZBB1kpTzKVDk8I59vVV6*FgB5zFYsVooD0wRRlQHO8tNMURHMwKR5hmuPX2Pe3al3iWOhcsi5S/Makingchocolatefromscratch.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20070604203647/http://www.chocolateusa.org/pdfs/CMA-stakeholder.pdf","http://www.chocolateusa.org/pdfs/CMA-stakeholder.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20070604203647/http://www.chocolateusa.org/pdfs/CMA-stakeholder.pdf","http://www.typetive.com/blogimages/07p-0085AppendixC.pdf","http://www.typetive.com/blogimages/07p-0085AppendixC.pdf","http://lib3.dss.go.th/fulltext/Journal/J.AOCS/J.AOCS/1998/no.4/1998,vol75,no4,p425-439.pdf","http://lib3.dss.go.th/fulltext/Journal/J.AOCS/J.AOCS/1998/no.4/1998,vol75,no4,p425-439.pdf"],"categories":["Chocolate","Nahuatl
