More generally,\n\"parliament\" may simply refer to a democratic government's legislature. The term\nis derived from the French , the action of parler (to speak): a parlement is a\ndiscussion. The term came to mean a meeting at which such a discussion took\nplace. It acquired its modern meaning as it came to be used for the body of\npeople (in an institutional sense) who would meet to discuss matters of\nstate.\n\nGenerally, a parliament has three functions: representation, legislation and\nparliamentary control (i.e., hearings, inquiries).\n","linknr":851,"url":"Parliament","recorded":1362685251,"links":124,"instances":["portugal","fiji","slovenia","canada","law","disambiguation","scotland","japan","canada","japan","italy","slovenia","instrument","title","division","italy","legislature","austria"],"pdf":["http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/POLSC101-5.2-Parliament-FINAL.pdf","http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/POLSC101-5.2-Parliament-FINAL.pdf","http://www.hizb-ut-tahrir.org/PDF/EN/en_books_pdf/system_of_islam.pdf","http://www.hizb-ut-tahrir.org/PDF/EN/en_books_pdf/system_of_islam.pdf"],"categories":["Legislatures","Westminster
