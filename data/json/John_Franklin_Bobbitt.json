A representative of\nthe efficiency minded thinkers, he specialized in the field of the curriculum.\n\nHis parents were James and Martha Bobbitt. From 1903 to 1907, Bobbitt was a\nteacher at the Philippine Normal School in Manila. He went to the Philippines as\npart of a member of a committee sent to draw up an elementary school curriculum\nfor the islands. They had the freedom to form an original curriculum to fit the\nneeds of the population. At first they put together American textbooks which\nthey had been familiar with in United States schools, but a director of\neducation in the Philippines made them look this over. When they saw that their\nidea did not fit with the social realities, they discarded their original plan.\nThis time they drew up a plan with a variety of things to help the people gain\nhealth, make a living, and enjoy self-realization. They got away from the\nAmerican textbooks and found activities derived from the Philippine culture.\nThis is when Bobbitt realized that there were more useful solutions to forming a\ncurriculum than just using traditional beliefs.\n\nHe felt that the curriculum was a way to prepare students for their future roles\nin the new industrial society. He influenced the curriculum by showing how\nteaching classical subjects should be replaced by teaching subjects that\ncorrespond to social needs. In 1918, Bobbitt wrote The Curriculum: a summary of\nthe development concerning the theory of the curriculum. This became an official\nspecialization in the education sciences. The entrance point of a curriculum\nwas, according Bobbitt, to see which results have to be accomplished.\n\nBobbitt felt that the curriculum has to adapt to the needs of an individual and\nto the needs of the new industrial society, people should not be taught what\nthey would never use. They should only learn those skills which were necessary\nto fulfill their personal tasks. Education was according to Bobbitt primarily a\npreparation for adulthood and not for childhood or youth. This resulted in an\nearly differentiation in education. Bobbitt was not a supporter of coeducation.\nIn his view girls had a very different future than boys, so they did not need\nthe same sort of education.\n\n \"Educate the individual according to his capabilities. This\nrequires that the material of the curriculum be sufficient various to meet the\nneeds of every class of individuals in the community and that the course of\ntraining and study be sufficiently flexible that the individual can be given\njust the things that he needs\" (Bobbitt, 1912, p. 269). \n\nBobbitt created five steps for curriculum making: (a) analysis of human\nexperience, (b) job analysis, (c) deriving objectives, (d) selecting objectives,\nand (e) planning in detail. The first step was about separating all of human\nexperience into major fields. This was followed by step two, where the fields\nwere broken down into more specific activities. The third step was to form the\nobjective from the abilities needed to perform the activities. Next is the\nfourth step, where the objectives are selected from to find ones that would\nserve as the basis for planning activities for the students. The last step was\nto lay out activities, experiences, and opportunities that would be needed to\nobtain the objectives.\n\nBesides a change in the content of the curriculum, Bobbitt was also calling for\nthe elimination of conventional school subjects. He preferred subjects that were\nthemselves areas of living, such as citizenship and leisure (p97). Bobbitt also\nbelieved that schools were charged to provide society with what it needed as\ndetermined by scientific analyses (p100).\n\nBobbitt realized that there were too many activities (for example related to\ncitizenship, health, spare time, parentship, work related activities and\nlanguages) to fit in any curriculum. A part of those activities were well taught\nby socialization: the so called undirected experiences. This is why the\ncurriculum has to aim at the particular subjects that are not sufficiency\nlearned as a result of normal socialization, these subjects were described as\nshortcomings.\n","linknr":92,"url":"John_Franklin_Bobbitt","recorded":1374544820,"links":["/w/index.php?title=John_Franklin_Bobbitt&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=John_Franklin_Bobbitt&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/English,_Indiana","/wiki/USA","/wiki/Efficiency_Movement","/wiki/Curriculum","/wiki/Manila","/wiki/Philippines","/wiki/Coeducation","/w/index.php?title=John_Franklin_Bobbitt&action=edit&section=1","http://www.coe.edu/","http://www2.selu.edu/","/w/index.php?title=John_Franklin_Bobbitt&action=edit&section=2","http://www.gutenberg.org/author/John_Franklin_Bobbitt","/wiki/Project_Gutenberg","http://worldcat.org/identities/lccn-n89-630991","/wiki/WorldCat","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/60690332","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Franklin_Bobbitt&oldid=553726081","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:American_educationists","/wiki/Category:1876_births","/wiki/Category:American_expatriates_in_the_Philippines","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/wiki/Category:Year_of_death_missing","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=John+Franklin+Bobbitt&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=John+Franklin+Bobbitt","/wiki/John_Franklin_Bobbitt","/wiki/Talk:John_Franklin_Bobbitt","#","/wiki/John_Franklin_Bobbitt","/w/index.php?title=John_Franklin_Bobbitt&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=John_Franklin_Bobbitt&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/John_Franklin_Bobbitt","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/John_Franklin_Bobbitt","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=John_Franklin_Bobbitt&oldid=553726081","/w/index.php?title=John_Franklin_Bobbitt&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q12617202","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=John_Franklin_Bobbitt&id=553726081","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=John+Franklin+Bobbitt","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=John+Franklin+Bobbitt&oldid=553726081&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=John_Franklin_Bobbitt&printable=yes","//ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/%EC%A1%B4_%ED%94%84%EB%9E%AD%ED%81%B4%EB%A6%B0_%EB%B3%B4%EB%B9%84%ED%8A%B8","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q12617202#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Franklin_Bobbitt","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["American
