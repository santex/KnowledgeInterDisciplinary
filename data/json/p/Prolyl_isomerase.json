Proline has an unusually conformationally restrained\npeptide bond due to its cyclic structure with its side chain bonded to its\nsecondary amine nitrogen. Most amino acids have a strong energetic preference\nfor the trans peptide bond conformation due to steric hindrance, but proline's\nunusual structure stabilizes the cis form so that both isomers are populated\nunder biologically relevant conditions. Proteins with prolyl isomerase activity\ninclude cyclophilin, FKBPs, and parvulin, although larger proteins can also\ncontain prolyl isomerase domains.\n","linknr":252,"url":"Prolyl_isomerase","recorded":1362481954,"links":15,"instances":["biochemistry","protein"],"pdf":[],"categories":["EC 5.2.1"],"headings":["Protein folding","Evidence for proline isomerization","Assays for prolyl isomerase activity","References","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/Mergefrom.svg/50px-Mergefrom.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/15/PDB_1nmw_EBI.jpg/220px-PDB_1nmw_EBI.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["chaperone","protein"],["turn","biochemistry"]],"members":["turn","chaperone"],"related":["Enzyme","Prokaryote","Eukaryote","Cis-trans_isomerism","Peptide_bond","Proline","Side_chain","Amine","Amino_acid","Steric","Cyclophilin","FKBP","Parvulin","Structural_domain","Amino_acid","Activation_energy","Rate-limiting_step","Protein_folding","Chaperone_(protein)","N-terminal","Turn_(biochemistry)","Native_state","Ribonuclease_A","Ribonuclease_T1","Beta_lactamase","Interleukin","Autocatalytic","Cytosol","Activation_energy","Enzyme_kinetics","Mutation","Chymotrypsin","Proteolytic","Alanine","Alanine","Proline","Phenylalanine","Aqueous"]}
