{"cursor":"2499","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In mathematics, a 'principal branch' is a function which selects one branch, or\n\"slice\", of a multi-valued function. Most often, this applies to functions\ndefined on the complex plane: see branch cut.\n\nOne way to view a principal branch is to look specifically at the exponential\nfunction, and the logarithm, as it is defined in complex analysis.\n\nThe exponential function is single-valued, where e^z is defined as:\n\n: e^z=e^a \\cos b +i e^a \\sin b\nwhere z = a + bi .\n\nHowever, the periodic nature of the trigonometric functions involved makes it\nclear that the logarithm is not so uniquely determined. One way to see this is\nto look at the following:\n\n: \\operatorname{Re}(\\log z)=\\log \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\n\nand\n\n: \\operatorname{Im}(\\log\\ z) = \\arctan(b/a) + 2\\pi k\nwhere k is any integer.\n\nAny number log(z) defined by such criteria has the property that\ne log(z)  = z.\n\nIn this manner log function is a multi-valued function (often referred to as a\n\"multifunction\" in the context of complex analysis). A branch cut, usually along\nthe negative real axis, can limit the imaginary part so it lies between −Ï\nand Ï. These are the chosen principal values.\n\nThis is the principal branch of the log function. Often it is defined using a\ncapital letter, Log(z).\n\nA more familiar principal branch function, limited to real numbers, is that of a\npositive real number raised to the power of 1/2.\n\nFor example, take the relation y = x 1/2 , where x is any positive\nreal number.\n\nThis relation can be satisfied by any value of y equal to a square root of x\n(either positive or negative). When y is taken to be the positive square root,\nwe write y = \\sqrt x .\n\nIn this instance, the positive square root function is taken as the principal\nbranch of the multi-valued relation x 1/2 .\n\nPrincipal branches are also used in the definition of many inverse trigonometric\nfunctions.\n","linknr":98,"url":"Principal_branch","recorded":1362670655,"links":12,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Complex analysis"],"headings":["See also","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/5/d/55da574462bedb4e146729b59e82ecda.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/9/e/b/9ebbf96d85a86273e6c8fdf10971b326.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/6/5/565fa857017a4609f9c6d22a2a38eefc.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/9/5/2/95202ce9d6dce568433fd13a83a30568.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/2/8/428981e5ae792366262dad65913469ea.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/0/4/70481502a42ddfc4eee87b3bdb83aacd.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Mathematics","Multi-valued_function","Complex_plane","Branch_cut","Exponential_function","Logarithm","Complex_analysis","Multi-valued_function","Principal_value","Square_root","Trigonometry","Branch_point","Complex_logarithm","Riemann_surface"]}
