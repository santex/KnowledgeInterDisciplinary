      "text" : "\n\n'Paleontology' or 'palaeontology' (, or , ) is the scientific study of\nprehistoric life. It includes the study of fossils to determine organisms'\nevolution and interactions with each other and their environments (their\npaleoecology). As a \"historical science\" it attempts to explain causes rather\nthan conduct experiments to observe effects. Paleontological observations have\nbeen documented as far back as the 5th&nbsp;century BC. The science became\nestablished in the 18th&nbsp;century as a result of Georges Cuvier's work on\ncomparative anatomy, and developed rapidly in the 19th&nbsp;century. The term\nitself originates from Greek παλαιός, palaios, i.e. \"old, ancient\", ὄν, on (gen.\nontos), i.e. \"being, creature\" and λόγος, logos, i.e. \"speech, thought,\nstudy\".<ref name=OnlineEtDict></ref>\n\nPaleontology lies on the border between biology and geology, and shares with\narchaeology a border that is difficult to define. It now uses techniques drawn\nfrom a wide range of sciences, including biochemistry, mathematics and\nengineering. Use of all these techniques has enabled paleontologists to discover\nmuch of the evolutionary history of life, almost all the way back to when Earth\nbecame capable of supporting life, about . As knowledge has increased,\npaleontology has developed specialized sub-divisions, some of which focus on\ndifferent types of fossil organisms while others study ecology and environmental\nhistory, such as ancient climates.\n\nBody fossils and trace fossils are the principal types of evidence about ancient\nlife, and geochemical evidence has helped to decipher the evolution of life\nbefore there were organisms large enough to leave fossils. Estimating the dates\nof these remains is essential but difficult: sometimes adjacent rock layers\nallow radiometric dating, which provides absolute dates that are accurate to\nwithin 0.5%, but more often paleontologists have to rely on relative dating by\nsolving the \"jigsaw puzzles\" of biostratigraphy. Classifying ancient organisms\nis also difficult, as many do not fit well into the Linnean taxonomy that is\ncommonly used for classifying living organisms, and paleontologists more often\nuse cladistics to draw up evolutionary \"family trees\". The final quarter of the\n20th century saw the development of molecular phylogenetics, which investigates\nhow closely organisms are related by measuring how similar the DNA is in their\ngenomes. Molecular phylogenetics has also been used to estimate the dates when\nspecies diverged, but there is controversy about the reliability of the\nmolecular clock on which such estimates depend.\n",
