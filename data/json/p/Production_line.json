{"cursor":"3180","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n production line]]\n\nA 'production line' is a set of sequential operations established in a factory\nwhereby materials are put through a refining process to produce an end-product\nthat is suitable for onward consumption; or components are assembled to make a\nfinished article.\n\nTypically, raw materials such as metal ores or agricultural products such as\nfoodstuffs or textile source plants (cotton, flax) require a sequence of\ntreatments to render them useful. For metal, the processes include crushing,\nsmelting and further refining. For plants, the useful material has to be\nseparated from husks or contaminants and then treated for onward sale.\n","linknr":130,"url":"Production_line","recorded":1362372551,"links":17,"instances":["physics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Industry","Industrial Revolution","Manufacturing","Production and manufacturing"],"headings":["History","See also","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/Krispy_Kreme_Doughnuts.jpg/220px-Krispy_Kreme_Doughnuts.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf8/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["power","physics"]],"members":["power"],"related":["Factory","Refining","Raw_material","Metal","Ore","Agriculture","Textile","Cotton","Flax","Smelting","Production_process","Energy","Wind_mill","Water_mill","Power_(physics)","Human_resources","Factory","Cotton_mill","Richard_Arkwright","Steam_engine","Machine","Industrial_revolution","Europe","United_States","Assembly_line","Eli_Whitney","Ford_Motor_Company","Henry_Ford","Assembly_line","Conveyor","Mass_production","Pilot_plant","JÃ³zsef_Galamb"]}
