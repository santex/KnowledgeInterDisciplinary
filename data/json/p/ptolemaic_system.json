      "text" : "\n\n, 1568 (Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris)]]\n\nIn astronomy, the 'geocentric model' (also known as 'geocentrism', or the\n'Ptolemaic system'), is a description of the cosmos where Earth is at the\norbital center of all celestial bodies. This model served as the predominant\ncosmological system in many ancient civilizations such as ancient Greece. As\nsuch, they assumed that the Sun, Moon, stars, and naked eye planets circled\nEarth, including the noteworthy systems of Aristotle (see Aristotelian physics)\nand Ptolemy.<ref>{{cite book |last=Lawson |first=Russell M. |year=2004\n|title=Science in the ancient world: an encyclopedia |url=http://books.google.c-\nom/?id=1AY1ALzh9V0C&pg=PA30&lpg=PA30&dq=ancient+China+geocentric+astronomy#v=on-\nepage&q=ancient%20China%20geocentric%20astronomy&f=false |pages=29–30 |publisher=ABC-\nCLIO |accessdate=2009-10-02 |isbn=1-85109-534-9}}</ref>\n\nTwo commonly made observations supported the idea that Earth was the center of\nthe Universe. The first observation was that the stars, the sun, and planets\nappear to revolve around Earth each day, making Earth the center of that system.\nFurther, every star was on a \"stellar\" or \"celestial\" sphere, of which the earth\nwas the center, that rotated each day, using a line through the north and south\npole as an axis. The stars closest to the equator appeared to rise and fall the\ngreatest distance, but each star circled back to its rising point each\nday.<ref>Thomas S. Kuhn, The Copernican Revolution, pp. 5&ndash;20</ref> The\nsecond common notion supporting the geocentric model was that the Earth does not\nseem to move from the perspective of an Earth bound observer, and that it is\nsolid, stable, and unmoving. In other words, it is completely at rest.\n\nThe geocentric model was usually combined with a spherical Earth by ancient\nRoman and medieval philosophers. It is not the same as the older flat Earth\nmodel implied in some mythology, as was the case with the biblical and\npostbiblical Latin cosmology.<ref>The Egyptian universe was substantially\nsimilar to the Babylonian universe; it was pictured as a rectangular box with a\nnorth-south orientation and with a slightly concave surface, with Egypt in the\ncenter. 'A good idea of the similarly primitive state of Hebrew astronomy can be\ngained from Biblical writings, such as the Genesis creation story and the\nvarious Psalms that extol the firmament, the stars, the sun, and the earth. The\nHebrews saw the earth as an almost flat surface consisting of a solid and a\nliquid part, and the sky as the realm of light in which heavenly bodies move.'\nThe earth rested on cornerstones and could not be moved except by Jehovah (as in\nan earthquake). According to the Hebrews, the sun and the moon were only a short\ndistance from one another. - How to cite this article: MLA (Modern Language\nAssociation) style: \"Cosmology.\" Encyclopedia Americana.

The Earth is\nusually described as a disk encircled by water. Interestingly, cosmological and\nmetaphysical speculations were not to be cultivated in public nor were they to\nbe committed to writing. Rather, they were considered as \"secrets of the Torah\nnot to be passed on to all and sundry\" (Ketubot 112a). While study of God's\ncreation was not prohibited, speculations about \"what is above, what is beneath,\nwhat is before, and what is after\" (Mishnah Hagigah: 2) were restricted to the\nintellectual elite.

'Hebrew cosmology pictured a flat earth, over which\nwas a dome-shaped firmament, supported above the earth by mountains, and\nsurrounded by waters.' Holes or sluices (windows, Gen. 7: 11) allowed the water\nto fall as rain. The firmament was the heavens in which God set the sun (Ps. 19:\n4) and the stars (Gen. 1: 14) on the fourth day of the creation. There was more\nwater under the earth (Gen. 1: 7) and during the Flood the two great oceans\njoined up and covered the earth; sheol was at the bottom of the earth (Isa. 14:\n9; Num. 16: 30).” How to cite this entry: “firmament”, “Dictionary of the\nBible”, W. R. F. Browning, Oxford University Press, 1997. Oxford Reference\nOnline. </ref><ref> 'The cosmographical structure assumed by this text is the\nancient, traditional flat earth model that was common throughout the Near East\nand that persisted in Jewish tradition because of its place in the religiously\nauthoritative biblical materials.' - “The Early History Of Heaven”, J. Edward\nWright, Oxford University Press 2000, p.155 </ref><ref> “The term \"firmament\"\n(רקיע- rāqîa') denotes the atmosphere between the heavenly realm and the earth\n(Gen. 1:6-7, 20) where the celestial bodies move (Gen. 1:14-17). It can also be\nused as a synonym for \"heaven\" (Gen. 1:8; Ps. 19:2). This \"firmament is part of\nthe heavenly structure whether it is the equivalent of \"heaven/sky\" or is what\nseparates it from the earth. […] The ancient Israelites also used more\ndescriptive terms for how God created the celestial realm, and based on the\ncollection of these more specific and illustrative terms, I would propose that\nthey had two basic ideas of the composition of the heavenly realm. First is the\nidea that 'the heavenly realm was imagined as a vast cosmic canopy. The verb\nused to describe metaphorically how God stretched out this canopy over earth is\nהטנ (nātāh) \"stretch out,\" or \"spread.\"' \"I made the earth, and created\nhumankind upon it; it was my hands that stretched out the heavens, and I\ncommanded all their host (Isa. 45:12).\" In the Bible this verb is used to\ndescribe the stretching out (pitching) of a tent. Since the texts that mention\nthe stretching out of the sky are typically drawing on creation imagery, it\nseems that the figure intends to suggest that the heavens are Yahweh's cosmic\ntent. One can imagine ancient Israelites gazing up to the stars and comparing\nthe canopy of the sky to the roofs of the tents under which they lived. In fact,\nif one were to look up at the ceiling of a dark tent with small holes in the\nroof during the daytime, the roof, with the sunlight shining through the holes,\nwould look very much like the night sky with all its stars. The second image of\nthe material composition of the heavenly realm involves ' a firm substance. The\nterm רקיע (răqîa'), typically translated \"firmament,\" indicates the expanse\nabove the earth. The root רקע means \"stamp out\" or \"forge.\" The idea of a solid,\nforged surface fits well with Ezekiel 1 where God's throne rests upon the רקיע\n(răqîa').' According to Genesis 1, the רקיע(rāqîa') is the sphere of the\ncelestial bodies (Gen. 1:6-8, 14-17; cf. ben Sira 43:8). It may be that some\nimagined the עיקר to be a firm substance on which the celestial bodies rode\nduring their daily journeys across the sky.” - “The Early History Of Heaven”, J.\nEdward Wright, Oxford University Press 2000, pp. 55-56: </ref><ref> 'In the\ncourse of the Second Temple Period Jews, and eventually Christians, began to\ndescribe the universe in new terms. The model of the universe inherited form the\nHebrew Bible and the Ancient Near East of a flat earth completely surrounded by\nwater with a heavenly realm of the gods arching above from horizon to horizon'\nbecame obsolete. In the past the heavenly realm was for gods only. It was the\nplace where all events on earth were determined by the gods, and their decisions\nwere irrevocable. The gulf between the gods and humans could not have been\ngreater. The evolution of Jewish cosmography in the course of the Second Temple\nPeriod followed developments in Hellenistic astronomy. - “The Early History Of\nHeaven”, J. Edward Wright, Oxford University Press 2000, p.201 </ref><ref> What\nis described in Genesis 1:1 to 2:3 was the commonly accepted structure of the\nuniverse from at least late in the second millennium BCE to the fourth or third\ncentury BCE. It represents a coherent model for the experiences of the people of\nMesopotamia through that period. It reflects a world-view that made sense of\nwater coming from the sky and the ground as well as the regular apparent\nmovements of the stars, sun, moon, and planets. There is a clear understanding\nof the restrictions on breeding between different species of animals and of the\nway in which human beings had gained control over what were, by then, domestic\nanimals. There is also recognition of the ability of humans to change the\nenvironment in which they lived. This same understanding occurred also in the\ngreat creation stories of Mesopotamia; 'these stories formed the basis for the\nJewish theological reflections of the Hebrew Scriptures concerning the creation\nof the world.' The Jewish priests and theologians who constructed the narrative\ntook accepted ideas about the structure of the world and reflected theologically\non them in the light of their experience and faith. There was never any clash\nbetween Jewish and Babylonian people about the structure of the world, but only\nabout who was responsible for it and its ultimate theological meaning. 'The\nenvisaged structure is simple: Earth was seen as being situated in the middle of\na great volume of water, with water both above and below Earth. A great dome was\nthought to be set above Earth (like an inverted glass bowl), maintaining the\nwater above Earth in its place. Earth was pictured as resting on foundations\nthat go down into the deep. These foundations secured the stability of the land\nas something that is not floating on the water and so could not be tossed about\nby wind and wave. The waters surrounding Earth were thought to have been\ngathered together in their place. The stars, sun, moon, and planets moved in\ntheir allotted paths across the great dome above Earth, with their movements\ndefining the months, seasons, and year.' - Citation source (MLA 7th Edition): p.\n253 in \"Biblical Geology.\" Encyclopedia of Geology.

Almost all ancient cultures developed cosmological\nstories to explain the basic features of the cosmos: Earth and its inhabitants,\nsky, sea, sun, moon, and stars. For example, for the Babylonians, the creation\nof the universe was seen as born from a primeval pair of human-like gods. In\nearly Egyptian cosmology, eclipses were explained as the moon being swallowed\ntemporarily by a sow or as the sun being attacked by a serpent. 'For the early\nHebrews, whose account is preserved in the biblical book of Genesis, a single\nGod created the universe in stages within the relatively recent past. Such pre-\nscientific cosmologies tended to assume a flat Earth, a finite past, ongoing\nactive interference by deities or spirits in the cosmic order, and stars and\nplanets (visible to the naked eye only as points of light) that were different\nin nature from Earth.' - Citation source (MLA 7th Edition), Applebaum, Wilbur.\n\"Astronomy and Cosmology: Cosmology.\" Scientific Thought: In Context.

The geocentric model held sway into the\nearly modern age, but from the late 16th century onward was gradually superseded\nby the heliocentric model of Copernicus, Galileo and Kepler. However, the\ntransition between these two theories met much resistance, not only from\nChristian theologians, who were reluctant to reject a theory that was in\nagreement with Bible passages (e.g. \"Sun, stand you still upon Gibeon\", Joshua\n10:12 - King James 2000 Bible), but also from those who saw geocentrism as an\naccepted consensus that could not be subverted by a new, unknown theory.\n",
