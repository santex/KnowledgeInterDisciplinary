Plant sap is\nnot to be confused with latex or resin; it is a separate substance, separately\nproduced, and with different components and functions.\n\n'Xylem sap' consists primarily of a watery solution of hormones, mineral\nelements and other nutrients. Transport of sap in xylem is characterized by\nmovement from the roots toward the leaves. Over the past century, there has\nbeen some controversy regarding the mechanism of xylem sap transport; today,\nmost plant scientists agree that the cohesion-tension theory best explains\nthis process.\n\n'Phloem sap' consists primarily of water, with sugars, hormones, and mineral\nelements dissolved in it. It flows from where carbohydrates are produced or\nstored to where they are used. The pressure flow hypothesis proposes a mechanism\nfor phloem sap transport.
