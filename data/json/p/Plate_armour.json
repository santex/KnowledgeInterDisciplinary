{"cursor":"26526","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n (r. 1548â1569)]]\n\n'Plate armour' is a historical type of personal armour made from iron or steel\nplates. While there are early predecessors such the Roman-era lorica segmentata,\nfull plate armour developed in Europe during the Late Middle Ages, especially in\nthe context of the Hundred Years' War, from the coat of plates worn over mail\nsuits during the 13th century. In Europe plate armour reached its peak in the\nlate 15th and 16th centuries, with the full suits of Gothic plate armour worn on\nthe battlefields of the Burgundian and Italian Wars. The most heavily armoured\ntroops of the period were heavy cavalry such as the gendarmes and early\ncuirassiers, but the infantry troops of the Swiss mercenaries and the\nlandsknechts also took to wearing lighter suits of \"three quarters\" plate\narmour, leaving the lower legs unprotected. The use of plate armour declined in\nthe 17th century, but remained common both among the nobility and for the\ncuirassiers throughout the European wars of religion. After 1650, plate armour\nwas mostly reduced to the simple breastplate (cuirass) worn by cuirassiers. This\nwas due to the development of the flintlock musket which could penetrate armour\nat a considerable distance, severely reducing the payoff from the investment in\nfull plate armour. For infantry, the breastplate gained renewed importance with\nthe development of shrapnel in the late 18th century. The use of steel plates\nsewn into flak jacket dates to World War II, replaced by more modern materials\nsuch as fibre-reinforced plastic since the 1950s. It is a common misconception\nthat the plate armour of European soldiers adversely affected mobility in a\nsignificant manner, but in fact plate armour was less heavy and featured more\neven weight distribution than a full complement of a modern firefighter's gear.\n\n","linknr":454,"url":"Plate_armour","recorded":1362484312,"links":49,"instances":["heraldry","medieval","polearm","japanese_matchlock","gloves","weaponry","1356","club","plate_armour","armour","armour","helmet","historical"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Medieval
