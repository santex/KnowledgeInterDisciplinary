While there\nis much overlap between prediction and forecast, a prediction may be a statement\nthat some outcome is expected, while a forecast is more specific, and may cover\na range of possible outcomes.\n\nAlthough guaranteed information about the future is in many cases impossible,\nprediction is necessary to allow plans to be made about possible developments;\nHoward H.
