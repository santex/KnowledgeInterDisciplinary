{"cursor":"43723","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Polyploid' cells and organisms are those containing more than two paired\n(homologous) sets of chromosomes. Most eukaryotic species are diploid, meaning\nthey have two sets of chromosomes â one set inherited from each parent. However\n'polyploidy' is found in some organisms and is especially common in plants. In\naddition, polyploidy also occurs in some tissues of animals who are otherwise\ndiploid, such as human muscle tissues. This is\nknown as 'endopolyploidy'. (Monoploid organisms also occur; a monoploid has only\none set of chromosomes. These include the vast majority of prokaryotes.)\n\nPolyploidy refers to a numerical change in a whole set of chromosomes. Organisms\nin which a particular chromosome, or chromosome segment, is under- or\noverrepresented are said to be aneuploid (from the Greek words meaning \"not,\"\n\"good,\" and \"fold\"). Therefore the distinction between aneuploidy and polyploidy\nis that aneuploidy refers to a numerical change in part of the chromosome set,\nwhereas polyploidy refers to a numerical change in the whole set of\nchromosomes.\n\nPolyploidy may occur due to abnormal cell division, either during mitosis, or\ncommonly during metaphase I in meiosis.\n\nPolyploidy occurs in some animals, such as goldfish, salmon, and\nsalamanders, but is especially common among ferns and flowering plants (see\n[[Hibiscus rosa-sinensis]]), including both wild and cultivated species. Wheat,\nfor example, after millennia of hybridization and modification by humans, has\nstrains that are 'diploid' (two sets of chromosomes), 'tetraploid' (four sets of\nchromosomes) with the common name of durum or macaroni wheat, and 'hexaploid'\n(six sets of chromosomes) with the common name of bread wheat. Many\nagriculturally important plants of the genus [[Brassica]] are also tetraploids.\nPolyploidization is a mechanism of sympatric speciation because polyploids are\nusually unable to interbreed with their diploid ancestors.\n\nPolyploidy can be induced in plants and cell cultures by some chemicals: the\nbest known is colchicine, which can result in chromosome doubling, though its\nuse may have other less obvious consequences as well. Oryzalin also will double\nthe existing chromosome content.\n","linknr":837,"url":"Polyploidy","recorded":1362483558,"links":54,"instances":["evolution","genetics","vegetable","biology","genetics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Classical genetics","Speciation"],"headings":["Polyploid types","Polyploidy in animals","Polyploidy in plants","Polyploidy in fungi","Polyploidy in the Chromalveolata","Terminology","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/Haploid%2C_diploid_%2Ctriploid_and_tetraploid.svg/220px-Haploid%2C_diploid_%2Ctriploid_and_tetraploid.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/04/Polyploidization.svg/220px-Polyploidization.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/2f/Polyploidy_in_fungi2.pdf/page1-220px-Polyploidy_in_fungi2.pdf.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a8/Polyploidy_in_fungi.pdf/page1-220px-Polyploidy_in_fungi.pdf.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/PaleopolyploidyTree.jpg/300px-PaleopolyploidyTree.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["hybrid","biology"],["imprinting","genetics"],["leek","vegetable"],["hybrid","biology"],["chimera","genetics"],["lineage","evolution"]],"members":["lineage","imprinting","leek","hybrid","chimera"],"related":["Biological_cell","Organism","Homologous_chromosome","Chromosomes","Eukaryote","Diploid","Muscle","Ploidy","Prokaryotes","Aneuploidy","Cell_division","Mitosis","Meiosis","Animal","Goldfish","Salmon","Salamander","Fern","Plant","Species","Wheat","Hybrid_(biology)","Durum","Sympatric_speciation","Cell_culture","Colchicine","Oryzalin","Cell_nucleus","Parthenocarpy","Phylum","Tardigrada","Salmonidae","Wheat","Kiwifruit","Sturgeon","Dahlias","Fragaria","Flatworm","Leech","Brine_shrimp","Parthenogenesis","Mole_salamanders","Kleptogenesis","Spermatophore","Mammals","Prenatal","Octodontidae","Rodent","Argentina","Desert","Plains_Viscacha-Rat","Rat","Guinea_pig","Chinchilla","Andes","Har_Swarup","John_Gurdon","J._B._S._Haldane","Cloning","Shinya_Yamanaka","Aneuploidy","Polyspermy","Miscarriage","Mixoploidy","Diploid","Digyny","Diandry","Fertilization","Oocyte","Polar_body","Oocyte","Miscarriage","Phenotype","Placenta","Fetus","Haploid","Fetus","Adrenal","Hypoplasia","Placenta","Hydatidiform_mole","Imprinting_(genetics)","Prenatal_diagnosis","Mixoploidy","Meiosis","Gamete","Zygote","Paleopolyploidy","Angiosperm","Heterosis","Speciation","Epigenetic","Conifers","Tree","Sequoia_sempervirens","Triticale","Rye","Apple","Banana","Citrus","Ginger","Watermelon","Apple","Durum","Macaroni","Wheat","Cotton","Potato","Cabbage","Leek_(vegetable)","Tobacco","Peanut","Kinnow","Pelargonium","Chrysanthemum","Wheat","Triticale","Oat","Kiwifruit","Strawberry","Dahlia","Pansies","Sugar_cane","Tulip","Lily","Daylilies","Kinnow","Fungus","Baker","Mushroom","Hybrid_(biology)","Hybrid_speciation","Chromosome","Basidiomycota","Chimera_(genetics)","Transcriptome","Phenotypic","Natural_selection","Adaptation","Speciation","Taxon","Oomycetes","Algae","Fucales","Diatoms","Alveolata","Genome","Gametes","Brassicas","Triangle_of_U","Paleopolyploidy","Lineage_(evolution)","Mutation","DNA_sequencing","Baker's_yeast","Rice","Evolution","Ancestor","Vertebrates","Human","Teleost","Fishes","Angiosperms","Flowering_plants","Eukaryote","Chromosome","Eukaryote","Species","Cytopathology","Cytogenetics","Eukaryotes","DNA_replication","Transposons","Mitosis","Meiosis","Gametogenesis","Genetic_recombination","Haplotypes","Meiosis","Genetic_recombination","Chromosome","Karyotype","Paleopolyploidy","Polyploid_complex","Polysomy","Speciation","Sympatry","The_Evolution_of_the_Genome","The_Evolution_of_the_Genome","The_Evolution_of_the_Genome"]}
