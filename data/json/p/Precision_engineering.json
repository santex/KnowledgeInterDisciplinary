NIST Manufacturing Engineering\n(2008).[http://www.mel.nist.gov/programs/pbookweb.pdf NIST Programs of the\nManufacturing Engineering Laboratory]. March 2008. ]] 'Precision\nengineering' is a subdiscipline of electrical engineering, software engineering,\nelectronics engineering, mechanical engineering, and optical engineering\nconcerned with designing machines, fixtures, and other structures that have\nexceptionally low tolerances, are repeatable, and are stable over time. These\napproaches have applications in machine tools, MEMS, NEMS, optoelectronics\ndesign, and many other fields.\n","linknr":116,"url":"Precision_engineering","recorded":1362480376,"links":16,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.mel.nist.gov/programs/pbookweb.pdf"],"categories":["Mechanical engineering"],"headings":["Overview","Technical Societies","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/03/NIST_Precision_engineering_research.jpg/280px-NIST_Precision_engineering_research.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/62/PD-icon.svg/12px-PD-icon.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Electrical_engineering","Software_engineering","Electronics_engineering","Mechanical_engineering","Optical_engineering","Tolerances","Machine_tool","Microelectromechanical_systems","Nanoelectromechanical_systems","Optoelectronics","American_Society_for_Precision_Engineering","Abbe_error","Accuracy_and_precision","Flexure_bearing","Kinematic_coupling","Measurement_uncertainty","Kinematic_determinacy"]}
