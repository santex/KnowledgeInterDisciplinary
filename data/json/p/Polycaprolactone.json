Polycaprolactones impart good water, oil, solvent and chlorine\nresistance to the polyurethane produced.\n\nThis polymer is often used as an additive for resins to improve their processing\ncharacteristics and their end use properties (e.g., impact resistance). Being\ncompatible with a range of other materials, PCL can be mixed with starch to\nlower its cost and increase biodegradability or it can be added as a polymeric\nplasticizer to PVC.\n\nPolycaprolactone is also used for splinting, modeling, and as a feedstock for\nprototyping systems such as a RepRap, where it is used for Fused Filament\nFabrication (similar to the Stratasys' Fused Deposition Modeling or FDM\ntechnique).\n","linknr":170,"url":"Polycaprolactone","recorded":1362505990,"links":22,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Polyesters","Biodegradable plastics","Plasticizers","Thermoplastics"],"headings":["Synthesis","Biomedical applications","Hobbyist and prototyping","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ab/Polycaprolactone_structure.png/100px-Polycaprolactone_structure.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/Pcl_synthesis.png/400px-Pcl_synthesis.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/Shapelock_bike_light.png/220px-Shapelock_bike_light.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Carbon","Hydrogen","Oxygen","Biodegradable","Polyester","Melting_point","Glass_transition_temperature","Polyurethane","Polyurethane","Toughness","Starch","Plasticizer","Polyvinyl_chloride","RepRap","Stratasys","Fused_Deposition_Modeling","Ring-opening_polymerization","Caprolactone","Catalyst","Hydrolysis","Ester","Biomaterial","Polylactide","Food_and_Drug_Administration","Drug_delivery","Surgical_suture","Brand","Adhesion_barrier","Tissue_engineering","GBR_membrane","Amphiphilic","Copolymers","Polymersome","Targeted_drug_delivery","Toluene","Root_canal","Gutta-percha","Physical_property","Rapid_prototyping","Silicone","Fimo","Silly_Putty","Sellotape","Duct_Tape","Sugru"]}
