In eukaryotes, they are located in the nucleus and the\ncytoplasm. The main function of the proteasome is to\ndegrade unneeded or damaged proteins by proteolysis, a chemical reaction that\nbreaks peptide bonds. Enzymes that carry out such reactions are called\nproteases. Proteasomes are part of a major mechanism by which cells regulate the\nconcentration of particular proteins and degrade misfolded proteins. The\ndegradation process yields peptides of about seven to eight amino acids long,\nwhich can then be further degraded into shorter amino acid sequences and used in\nsynthesizing new proteins. Proteins are tagged for\ndegradation with a small protein called ubiquitin. The tagging reaction is\ncatalyzed by enzymes called ubiquitin ligases. Once a protein is tagged with a\nsingle ubiquitin molecule, this is a signal to other ligases to attach\nadditional ubiquitin molecules. The result is a polyubiquitin chain that is\nbound by the proteasome, allowing it to degrade the tagged protein.\n\nIn structure, the proteasome is a cylindrical complex containing a \"core\" of\nfour stacked rings forming a central pore. Each ring is composed of seven\nindividual proteins. The inner two rings are made of seven Î² subunits that\ncontain three to seven protease active sites. These sites are located on the\ninterior surface of the rings, so that the target protein must enter the central\npore before it is degraded. The outer two rings each contain seven Î± subunits\nwhose function is to maintain a \"gate\" through which proteins enter the barrel.\nThese Î± subunits are controlled by binding to \"cap\" structures or regulatory\nparticles that recognize polyubiquitin tags attached to protein substrates and\ninitiate the degradation process. The overall system of ubiquitination and\nproteasomal degradation is known as the ubiquitin-proteasome system.\n\nThe proteasomal degradation pathway is essential for many cellular processes,\nincluding the cell cycle, the regulation of gene expression, and responses to\noxidative stress. The importance of proteolytic degradation inside cells and the\nrole of ubiquitin in proteolytic pathways was acknowledged in the award of the\n2004 Nobel Prize in Chemistry to Aaron Ciechanover, Avram Hershko and Irwin\nRose.\n","linknr":1174,"url":"Proteasome","recorded":1362486551,"links":53,"instances":["biochemistry","protein","pharmacology","protein","genetics","biochemistry","protein_and_supramolecular","protein","genetics","genetics","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Proteins","Protein
