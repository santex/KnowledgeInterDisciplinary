This work was completed by Fred Sanger and his team in\n1977. In 1962, Walter Fiers and Robert Sinsheimer had already\ndemonstrated the physical, covalently closed circularity of phi X 174\nDNA. Nobel prize winner Arthur Kornberg used phi X 174 as a model to\nfirst prove that DNA synthesized in a test tube by purified enzymes could\nproduce all the features of a natural virus, ushering in the age of synthetic\nbiology National Library of Medicine Profiles in Science.

The Î¦X174 virus particle has also\nbeen successfully assembled in vitro. Recently, Ã¸X174 was used as a\nmodel show how its highly overlapped genome can be fully decompressed and still\nremain functional.\n","linknr":163,"url":"Phi_X_174","recorded":1362505194,"links":18,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Bacteriophages"],"headings":["Virology","Notes","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/PhiX174.jpg/180px-PhiX174.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Bacteriophage","Genome","Fred_Sanger","Walter_Fiers","Arthur_Kornberg","Craig_Venter","Bacteriophage","DNA","Nucleotide","Protein","GC-content","Lysis","DNA_sequencing","Bacteriophage_MS2"]}
