F. Utter and D. B. Keech. Since then it has been found in a wide variety of\nprokaryotes and eukaryotes including fungi, bacteria, plants, and animals. In mammals, PC plays a crucial role in\ngluconeogenesis and lipogenesis, in the biosynthesis of neurotransmitters, and\nin glucose-induced insulin secretion by pancreatic islets. Oxaloacetate produced\nby PC is an important intermediate, which is used in these biosynthetic\npathways. In mammals, PC is expressed in a tissue-\nspecific manner, with its activity found to be highest in the liver and kidney\n(gluconeogenic tissues), in adipose tissue and lactating mammary gland\n(lipogenic tissues), and in pancreatic islets. Activity is moderate in brain,\nheart and adrenal gland, and least in white blood cells and skin\nfibroblasts.\n","linknr":925,"url":"Pyruvate_carboxylase","recorded":1362502974,"links":131,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["EC 6.4.1","Moonlighting proteins"],"headings":["Structure","Reaction mechanism","Role in gluconeogenesis","Clinical significance","Interactive pathway map","References","External links","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2e/Pyruvate_Carboxylase_fromPDB_2QF7.png/220px-Pyruvate_Carboxylase_fromPDB_2QF7.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3f/Pyruvic-acid-2D-skeletal.png/120px-Pyruvic-acid-2D-skeletal.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/55/Oxaloacetic_acid.png/120px-Oxaloacetic_acid.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/Pyruvate_Carboxylase_2QF7%2C_sswilson7.png/200px-Pyruvate_Carboxylase_2QF7%2C_sswilson7.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ab/Pyruvate_carboxylase_3HO8%2C_sswilson7.png/200px-Pyruvate_carboxylase_3HO8%2C_sswilson7.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/Mechanism_of_Pyruvate_Carboxylase%2C_5-15-2010%2C_sswilson7.png/300px-Mechanism_of_Pyruvate_Carboxylase%2C_5-15-2010%2C_sswilson7.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/14/TCACycle_WP78.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/14/TCACycle_WP78.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6b/Magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Enzyme","Ligase","Catalyzes","Carboxylation","Pyruvate","Oxaloacetate","Pyruvic_acid","Oxaloacetic_acid","Anaplerotic_reactions","Protein","Biotin","Magnesium","Manganese","Western_Reserve_University","Neurotransmitter","Electron_microscopy","Proteolysis","Biotin","Carbon_dioxide","Acetyl-CoA","Adenosine_triphosphate","Acetyl-CoA","Enol","Oxaloacetate","Gluconeogenesis","Phosphoenolpyruvate","Pyruvate","Oxaloacetate","Hydrolysis","Adenosine_triphosphate","Phosphoenolpyruvate_carboxykinase","Cytosol","Mitochondria","Malic_acid","Malate_dehydrogenase","Glucagon","Glucocorticoid","Insulin","Hexose","Anaplerotic_reactions","Citric_acid_cycle","Carbohydrate_metabolisim","Lipid_metabolism","Pyruvate_cycling","Glucose","Insulin","Diabetes_mellitus_type_2","Beta_cell","Beta-cell","Beta-cell","Pyruvate_carboxylase_deficiency","Lactic_acidosis","Lactic_acid","Pyruvate","Gluconeogenesis","Oxaloacetate","Blood_sugar","Hypoglycemia","Pyruvate_carboxylase_deficiency"]}
