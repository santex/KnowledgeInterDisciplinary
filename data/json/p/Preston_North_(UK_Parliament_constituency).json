The constituency was created by the House of Commons (Redistribution of\nSeats) Act 1949 for the 1950 general election by division of the former two-seat\nPreston constituency, and abolished for the 1983 general election. Some of the\nconstituency's former territory was then incorporated within a new single-seat\nPreston constituency, and parts of Preston North became elements within Fylde\nand Ribble Valley.\n\nThe modern Preston is a safe seat for Labour, but historically Preston North was\none of the most marginal constituencies in the country.\n","linknr":230,"url":"Preston_North_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","recorded":1375075267,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Preston_North_(UK_Parliament_constituency)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Preston_North_(UK_Parliament_constituency)&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Preston_North_(UK_Parliament_constituency)&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Template:Citation_needed","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/Borough_constituency","/wiki/House_of_Commons_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Ceremonial_counties_of_England","/wiki/Lancashire","/wiki/Preston,_Lancashire","/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1950","/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1983","/wiki/Preston_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Fylde_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Ribble_Valley_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Preston_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/United_Kingdom_constituencies","/wiki/Lancashire","/wiki/Member_of_Parliament","/wiki/House_of_Commons_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/House_of_Commons_(Redistribution_of_Seats)_Act_1949","/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1950","/wiki/Preston_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1983","/wiki/Preston_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Fylde_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Ribble_Valley_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Preston_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)","#Boundaries","#Members_of_Parliament","#Election_results","#See_also","#References","/w/index.php?title=Preston_North_(UK_Parliament_constituency)&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Preston_North_(UK_Parliament_constituency)&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1950","/wiki/Julian_Amery","/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)","/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1966","/wiki/Ronald_Atkins","/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)","/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1970","/wiki/Mary_Holt","/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)","/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_February_1974","/wiki/Ronald_Atkins","/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)","/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1979","/wiki/Robert_Atkins_(politician)","/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)","/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1983","/wiki/Preston_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/w/index.php?title=Preston_North_(UK_Parliament_constituency)&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1979","/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)","/wiki/Robert_Atkins_(politician)","/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)","/wiki/Ronald_Atkins","/wiki/Liberal_Party_(UK)","/wiki/National_Front_(UK)","/wiki/Voter_turnout","/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)","/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)","/wiki/Swing_(politics)","/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_October_1974","/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)","/wiki/Ronald_Atkins","/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)","/wiki/Mary_Holt","/wiki/Liberal_Party_(UK)","/wiki/Campaign_for_a_More_Prosperous_Britain","/wiki/Voter_turnout","/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)","/wiki/Swing_(politics)","/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_February_1974","/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)","/wiki/Ronald_Atkins","/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)","/wiki/Mary_Holt","/wiki/Liberal_Party_(UK)","/wiki/Voter_turnout","/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)","/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)","/wiki/Swing_(politics)","/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1970","/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)","/wiki/Mary_Holt","/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)","/wiki/Ronald_Atkins","/wiki/Liberal_Party_(UK)","/wiki/Voter_turnout","/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)","/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)","/wiki/Swing_(politics)","/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1966","/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)","/wiki/Ronald_Atkins","/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)","/wiki/Julian_Amery","/wiki/Voter_turnout","/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)","/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)","/wiki/Swing_(politics)","/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1964","/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)","/wiki/Julian_Amery","/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)","/wiki/Voter_turnout","/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)","/wiki/Swing_(politics)","/wiki/United_Kin
