US Environmental (July 24,\n2007), [http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/about/index.htm What is a pesticide?]\nepa.gov. Retrieved on September 15, 2007. They are a class of biocide. The\nmost common use of pesticides is as plant protection products (also known as\ncrop protection products), which in general protect plants from damaging\ninfluences such as weeds, diseases or insects. This use of pesticides is so\ncommon that the term pesticide is often treated as synonymous with plant\nprotection product, although it is in fact a broader term, as pesticides are\nalso used for non-agricultural purposes. A pesticide is generally a chemical or\nbiological agent (such as a virus, bacterium, antimicrobial or disinfectant)\nthat through its effect deters, incapacitates, kills or otherwise discourages\npests. Target pests can include insects, plant pathogens, weeds, molluscs,\nbirds, mammals, fish, nematodes (roundworms), and microbes that destroy\nproperty, cause nuisance, spread disease or are vectors for disease. Although\nthere are human benefits to the use of pesticides, some also have drawbacks,\nsuch as potential toxicity to humans and other animals. According to the\nStockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants, 9 of the 12 most\ndangerous and persistent organic chemicals are pesticides. Pesticides are\ncategorized into four main substituent chemicals: herbicides; fungicides;\ninsecticides and bactericides.
