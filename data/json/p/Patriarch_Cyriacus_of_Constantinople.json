{"cursor":"4843","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Cyriacus' was the thirtieth Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople (595â606).\nHe was previously presbyter and steward, oikonomos, of the great church at\nConstantinople ([[Chronicon Paschale]], p. 378). Gregory the Great\nreceived the legates bearing the synodal letters which announced his\nconsecration, partly from a desire not to disturb the peace of the church, and\npartly from the personal respect which he entertained for Cyriac; but in his\nreply he warned him against the sin of causing divisions in the church, clearly\nalluding to the use of the term oecumenical bishop (Gregory, Ep. lib. vii. 4,\nPatrologia Latina lxxvii. 853). The personal feelings of Gregory towards Cyriac\nappear most friendly.\n\nCyriacus did not attend to the entreaties of Gregory that he would abstain from\nusing the title, for Gregory wrote afterwards both to him and to the emperor\nMaurice, declaring that he could not allow his legates to remain in communion\nwith Cyriac as long as he retained it. In the latter of these letters he\ncompares the assumption of the title to the sin of Antichrist, since both\nexhibit a spirit of lawless pride. \"Quisquis se universalem sacerdotem vocat,\nvel vocari desiderat, in elatione sua Antichristum praecurrit\" (whosoever calls\nhimself universal priest, or desires to be called so, is the forerunner of the\nAntichrist) (Gregory Ep. 28, 30). In a letter to Anastasius of Antioch, who had\nwritten to him to remonstrate against disturbing the peace of the church,\nGregory defends his conduct on the ground of the injury which Cyriac had done to\nall other patriarchs by the assumption of the title, and reminds Anastasius that\nnot only heretics but heresiarchs had before this been patriarchs of\nConstantinople. He also deprecates the use of the term on more general grounds\n(Ep. 24). In spite of all this Cyriacus was firm in his retention of the title,\nand appears to have summoned, or to have meditated summoning, a council to\nauthorize its use. For in 599 Gregory wrote to Eusebius of Thessalonica and some\nother bishops, stating that he had heard they were about to be summoned to a\ncouncil at Constantinople, and most urgently entreating them to yield neither to\nforce nor to persuasion, but to be steadfast in their refusal to recognize the\noffensive title (ib. lib. ix. 68 in Patr. Lat.).\n\nCyriacus appears to have shared in that unpopularity of the emperor Maurice\nwhich caused his deposition and death (Theophanes Chronicle, A.M. 6094; Niceph.\nCallis. H. E. xviii. 40; Theophylact. Hist. viii. 9). He still, however, had\ninfluence enough to exact from Phocas at his coronation a confession of the\northodox faith and a pledge not to disturb the church (Theophanes Chronicle,\nA.M. 6094). He also nobly resisted the attempt of Phocas to drag the empress\nConstantina and her daughters from their sanctuary in a church of Constantinople\n(ibid., A.M. 6098).\n\nPerhaps some resentment at this opposition to his will may have induced Phocas\nto accede more readily to the claims of Pope Boniface III that Rome should be\nconsidered to be the head of all the church, in exclusion of the claims of\nConstantinople to the oecumenical bishopric (Vita Bonifacii III, in Labbe, Acta\nConcil. t. v. 1615).\n\nCyriac died in 606, and was interred in the church of the Holy Apostles\n(Chronicon Paschale, p. 381). He appears to have been a man of remarkable\npiety and earnestness, able to win the esteem of all parties. He built a church\ndedicated to the [[theotokos]] in a street of Constantinople called Diaconissa\n(Theophanes Chronicle, A.M. 6090; Niceph. Callis. H. E. xviii. 42).\n","linknr":114,"url":"Patriarch_Cyriacus_of_Constantinople","recorded":1375067322,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Patriarch_Cyriacus_II_of_Constantinople&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Patriarch_Cyriacus_II_of_Constantinople&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","/wiki/Patriarch_Cyriacus_II_of_Constantinople","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","/w/index.php?title=Patriarch_Cyriacus_of_Constantinople&redirect=no","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Ecumenical_Patriarch_of_Constantinople","/wiki/Constantinople","/wiki/Chronicon_Paschale","/wiki/Gregory_the_Great","/wiki/Patrologia_Latina","/wiki/Maurice_(emperor)","/wiki/Anastasius_of_Antioch","//toolserver.org/%7Edispenser/cgi-bin/dab_solver.py?page=Patriarch_Cyriacus_II_of_Constantinople&editintro=Template:Disambiguation_needed/editintro&client=Template:Dn","/w/index.php?title=Eusebius_of_Thessalonica&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Maurice_(emperor)","/wiki/Theophanes_the_Confessor","/wiki/Phocas","/wiki/Constantina_(empress)","/wiki/Pope_Boniface_III","/wiki/Philippe_Labbe","/wiki/Church_of_the_Holy_Apostles","/wiki/Theotokos","/w/index.php?title=Patriarch_Cyriacus_II_of_Constantinople&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/File:Wikisource-logo.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/12px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png","/wiki/Public_domain","/wiki/Henry_Wace_(Anglican_priest)","//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Dictionary_of_Christian_Biography_and_Literature_to_the_End_of_the_Sixth_Century/Cyriac,_patriarch_of_Constantinople","/wiki/Dictionary_of_Christian_Biography_and_Literature_to_the_End_of_the_Sixth_Century","/wiki/Orthodox_Christianity","/wiki/John_IV_of_Constantinople","/wiki/List_of_Constantinople_patriarchs","/wiki/Thomas_I_of_Constantinople","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Patriarch_Cyriacus_II_of_Constantinople&oldid=559917829","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:606_deaths","/wiki/Category:Burials_at_the_Church_of_the_Holy_Apostles","/wiki/Category:Ecumenical_Patriarchs_of_Constantinople","/wiki/Category:6th-century_bishops","/wiki/Category:7th-century_archbishops","/wiki/Category:6th-century_Byzantine_people","/wiki/Category:7th-century_Byzantine_people","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_links_needing_disambiguation_from_June_2011","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_incorporating_a_citation_from_the_DCBL_with_Wikisource_reference","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_incorporating_text_from_the_DCBL","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/wiki/Category:Year_of_birth_unknown","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Patriarch+Cyriacus+II+of+Constantinople&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Patriarch+Cyriacus+II+of+Constantinople","/wiki/Patriarch_Cyriacus_II_of_Constantinople","/wiki/Talk:Patriarch_Cyriacus_II_of_Constantinople","#","/wiki/Patriarch_Cyriacus_II_of_Constantinople","/w/index.php?title=Patriarch_Cyriacus_II_of_Constantinople&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Patriarch_Cyriacus_II_of_Constantinople&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Patriarch_Cyriacus_II_of_Constantinople","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Patriarch_Cyriacus_II_of_Constantinople","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Patriarch_Cyriacus_II_of_Constantinople&oldid=559917829","/w/index.php?title=Patriarch_Cyriacus_II_of_Constantinople&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1272843","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Patriarch_Cyriacus_II_of_Constantinople&id=559917829","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Patriarch+Cyriacus+II+of+Const
