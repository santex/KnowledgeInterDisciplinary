Pricing factors are manufacturing cost, market place,\ncompetition, market condition, and quality of product. Pricing is also a key\nvariable in microeconomic price allocation theory. Pricing is a fundamental\naspect of financial modeling and is one of the four Ps of the marketing mix. The\nother three aspects are product, promotion, and place. Price is the only revenue\ngenerating element amongst the four Ps, the rest being cost centers.\n\nPricing is the manual or automatic process of applying prices to purchase and\nsales orders, based on factors such as: a fixed amount, quantity break,\npromotion or sales campaign, specific vendor quote, price prevailing on entry,\nshipment or invoice date, combination of multiple orders or lines, and many\nothers. Automated systems require more setup and maintenance but may prevent\npricing errors. The needs of the consumer can be converted into demand only if\nthe consumer has the willingness and capacity to buy the product. Thus pricing\nis very important in marketing.\n","linknr":437,"url":"Pricing","recorded":1362483702,"links":38,"instances":["marketing","business","marketing","marketing","publisher","business","economics","business"],"pdf":["http://orgprints.org/16980/1/16980.pdf"],"categories":["Pricing|*","Competition (economics)","Marketing"],"headings":["Questions involved in pricing","What a price should do","Terminology","Nine laws of price sensitivity and consumer psychology","Approaches","Pricing tactics","Pricing mistakes","Methods","References","External links and further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e0/Xbox_360_FF_XIII_Special_Ed._bundle_price_tag_at_Target%2C_Tanforan.JPG/220px-Xbox_360_FF_XIII_Special_Ed._bundle_price_tag_at_Target%2C_Tanforan.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Wikibooks-logo-en-noslogan.svg/40px-Wikibooks-logo-en-noslogan.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["distribution","business"],["cost_center","business"],["product","business"],["service","economics"],["positioning","marketing"],["promotion","marketing"],["geo","marketing"],["free_press","publisher"]],"members":["promotion","cost_center","positioning","geo","free_press","product","service","distribution"],"related":["Manufacturing_cost","Microeconomic","Financial_modeling","Four_Ps","Marketing_mix","Distribution_(business)","Cost_center_(business)","Product_(business)","Service_(economics)","Pricing_objectives","Profit_maximization","Fixed_price","Cost-plus_pricing","Value-based_pricing","Rate_of_return_pricing","Competitor_indexing","Zone_pricing","Quantity_discounts","Price_skimming","Penetration_pricing","Psychological_pricing","Sticker_shock","Price_elasticity_of_demand","Real-time_pricing","Price_discrimination","Yield_management","Price_points","Price_floor","Production_factors","Transfer_pricing","Price_wars","Joint_product_pricing","Barter","Positioning_(marketing)","Marketing_mix","Advertising","Promotion_(marketing)","Economic_surplus","Five_and_dime","Price_points","Inflation","Loss_leader","Twinkies","Rolex","Bentley","Price_skimming","Price_discrimination","Yield_management","Price_points","Psychological_pricing","Product_bundling","Penetration_pricing","Value-based_pricing","Geo_(marketing)","Thomas_Nagle","Reed_Holden","Lever","Free_Press_(publisher)","Micromarketing","Microbrands","Microsegments","Cost-plus_pricing","Cost_the_limit_of_price","Group_buy","Options_pricing","Pay_what_you_want","Price_elasticity_of_demand","Price_system","Price_umbrella","Product_life_cycle_management","Product_sabotage","Psychological_pricing","Purchasing_power","Suggested_retail_price","Target_pricing","Time-based_pricing","Value_pricing","William_Poundstone"]}
