{"cursor":"9960","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nThe 'Paleozoic' (or 'Palaeozoic') 'Era' (from the Greek palaios (ÏÎ±Î»Î±Î¹ÏÏ), \"old\"\nand zoe (Î¶ÏÎ®), \"life\", meaning \"ancient life\") is the earliest of three geologic\neras of the Phanerozoic Eon, spanning from roughly (ICS, 2004). It is the\nlongest of the Phanerozoic eras, and is subdivided into six geologic periods\n(from oldest to youngest): the Cambrian, Ordovician, Silurian, Devonian,\nCarboniferous, and Permian. The Paleozoic comes after the Neoproterozoic Era of\nthe Proterozoic Eon, and is followed by the Mesozoic Era.\n\nThe Paleozoic was a time of dramatic geological, climatic, and evolutionary\nchange. The Cambrian Period witnessed the most rapid and widespread\ndiversification of life in Earth's history, known as the Cambrian explosion, in\nwhich most modern phyla first appeared. Fish, arthropods, amphibians and\nreptiles all evolved during the Paleozoic. Life began in the ocean but\neventually transitioned onto land, and by the late Paleozoic, it was dominated\nby various forms of organisms. Great forests of primitive plants covered the\ncontinents, many of which formed the coal beds of Europe and eastern North\nAmerica. Towards the end of the era, large, sophisticated reptiles were dominant\nand the first modern plants (conifers) appeared.\n\nThe Paleozoic Era ended with the largest mass extinction in Earth's history, the\nPermianâTriassic extinction event. The effects of this catastrophe were so\ndevastating that it took life on land 30 million years into the Mesozoic to\nrecover.\nRecovery of life in the sea may have been much faster. url=http://www.economist.com/node/16524904\n","linknr":498,"url":"Paleozoic","recorded":1362372854,"links":81,"instances":["geology","geology","geology"],"pdf":["http://journals.royalsociety.org/content/qq5un1810k7605h5/fulltext.pdf","http://journals.royalsociety.org/content/qq5un1810k7605h5/fulltext.pdf","http://www.stratigraphy.org/ics%20chart/ChronostratChart2012.pdf"],"categories":["Geological history of Earth","Paleozoic|"],"headings":["Geology","Climate","Flora","Fauna","See also","References and further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/Blakey_500moll.jpg/220px-Blakey_500moll.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/ba/Devonianscene-green.jpg/220px-Devonianscene-green.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["era","geology"],["eon","geology"],["period","geology"]],"members":["eon","period","era"],"related":["Geology","Era_(geology)","Phanerozoic","Eon_(geology)","Period_(geology)","Cambrian","Ordovician","Silurian","Devonian_period","Carboniferous","Permian","Neoproterozoic","Proterozoic_Eon","Mesozoic_Era","Cambrian","Cambrian_explosion","Phylum","Fish","Arthropod","Amphibian","Reptile","Forest","Coal","Europe","North_America","Reptile","Conifer","Mass_extinction","Earth's_history","Permian–Triassic_extinction_event","North_America","Sedimentary_basin","Precambrian","Canada","Ordovician_Period","Acadian_Mountains","Appalachian_Mountains","Coal","Carboniferous_Period","Paleoclimatology","Glacier","Central_Africa","Gondwanaland","Australia","Pangaea","Urals","Tasmania","Supercontinent","Pannotia","Supercontinent","Pangaea","Early_Palaeozoic_Icehouse","Sea_level_rise","Gondwana","South_Pole","Baltica","Laurentia","Oxygen","Carbon_dioxide","Mississippian","Carboniferous","Lopingian","Permian_extinction","Silurian","Devonian","Lycopsid","Euramerica","Carboniferous_Rainforest_Collapse","Invertebrate","Geologic_timescale","Precambrian","Cenozoic","Mesozoic"]}
