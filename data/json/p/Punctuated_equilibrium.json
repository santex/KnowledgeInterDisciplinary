When significant evolutionary change occurs, the\nhypothesis proposes that it is generally restricted to rare and geologically\nrapid events of branching speciation called cladogenesis. Cladogenesis is the\nprocess by which a species splits into two distinct species, rather than one\nspecies gradually transforming into another. Gould,\nStephen Jay, & Eldredge, Niles (1977).

In this\nview, evolution is seen as generally smooth and continuous. In 1972,\npaleontologists Niles Eldredge and Stephen Jay Gould published a landmark paper\ndeveloping this theory and called it punctuated equilibria. Eldredge, Niles and S. J. Gould (1972).\n[http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/ridley/classictexts/eldredge.asp \"Punctuated\nequilibria: an alternative to phyletic gradualism\"] In T.J.M. Schopf, ed.,\nModels in Paleobiology.
