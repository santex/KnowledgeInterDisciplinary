{"cursor":"57157","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n'Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins' ('PCDD's), or simply 'dioxins', are a group of\norganic polyhalogenated compounds that are significant environmental pollutants.\nThey are commonly but inaccurately referred to as dioxins for simplicity,\nbecause every PCDD molecule contains a dioxin skeletal structure as the central\nring. This gives the molecule a dibenzo-''p''-dioxin ring system. Members of the\nPCDD family bioaccumulate in humans and wildlife because of their lipophilic\nproperties, and may cause developmental disturbances and cancer.\n\nDioxins occur as by-products in the manufacture of some organochlorines, in the\nincineration of chlorine-containing substances such as PVC (polyvinyl chloride),\nin the chlorine bleaching of paper, and from natural sources such as volcanoes\nand forest fires. There have been many incidents\nof dioxin pollution resulting from industrial emissions and accidents; the\nearliest such incidents were in the mid 19th century during the Industrial\nRevolution.\n\nThe word \"dioxins\" may also refer to other similarly acting chlorinated\ncompounds (see Dioxins and dioxin-like compounds).\n","linknr":884,"url":"Polychlorinated_dibenzodioxins","recorded":1362506156,"links":73,"instances":["manhattan","container","symptom","chemistry"],"pdf":["http://ec.europa.eu/environment/dioxin/pdf/task6.pdf","http://ec.europa.eu/environment/dioxin/pdf/task6.pdf","http://ec.europa.eu/food/committees/regulatory/scfcah/animal_health/presentations/1112012011_dioxin_germany.pdf","http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0003/97032/4.3.-Persistant-Organic-Pollutantsm-EDITED_layouted_V2.pdf","http://www.itrust.de/btfi/pdf/1990-14-06-393.pdf","http://www.itrust.de/btfi/pdf/1990-14-06-393.pdf","http://www.ipen.org/ipepweb1/egg/HotspotReports/Usti_eggsreport.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20061231143828/http://www.roche.com/com_his_sev-e.pdf","http://www.roche.com/com_his_sev-e.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20061231143828/http://www.roche.com/com_his_sev-e.pdf","http://www.agriculture.gov.ie/media/migration/publications/2010/DioxinReport211209revised190110.pdf","http://www.tarantosociale.org/tarantosociale/docs/2000.pdf","http://www.tarantosociale.org/tarantosociale/docs/2000.pdf","http://ec.europa.eu/food/food/chemicalsafety/contaminants/dioxin_germany_information_note_en.pdf","http://www.who.int/entity/ipcs/publications/en/exe-sum-final.pdf"],"categories":["Organochlorides","IARC
