{"cursor":"16488","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Project A119', also known as \"'A Study of Lunar Research Flights'\", was a top-\nsecret plan developed in 1958 by the United States Air Force. The aim of the\nproject was to detonate a nuclear bomb on the Moon to boost public morale in the\nUnited States after the Soviet Union took an early lead in the Space Race. The\nexistence of the project was revealed in 2000 by a former executive at the\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), Leonard Reiffel, who led\nthe project in 1958. A young Carl Sagan was part of the team responsible for\npredicting the effects of a nuclear explosion in low gravity.\n\nProject A119 was never carried out, primarily because a moon landing would be a\nmuch more acceptable achievement in the eyes of the American public. The project\ndocuments remained secret for nearly 45 years, and despite Reiffel's\nrevelations, the United States government has never officially recognized its\ninvolvement in the study.\n","linknr":301,"url":"Project_A119","recorded":1362268032,"links":26,"instances":["solar","nuclear_warhead"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Cold War history of the United States","Exploration of the Moon","Nuclear weapons program of the United States","Secret military programs"],"headings":["Background","Project","Consequences","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/94/Symbol_support_vote.svg/15px-Symbol_support_vote.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/67/Study_of_Lunar_Research_Flights_-_Vol_I_-_Cover.jpg/220px-Study_of_Lunar_Research_Flights_-_Vol_I_-_Cover.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/82/ComputerHotline_-_Lune_%28by%29_%285%29.jpg/220px-ComputerHotline_-_Lune_%28by%29_%285%29.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/be/Carl_Sagan_Planetary_Society.JPG/170px-Carl_Sagan_Planetary_Society.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["terminator","solar"],["w25","nuclear_warhead"]],"members":["terminator","w25"],"related":["United_States_Air_Force","Nuclear_bomb","Moon","Soviet_Union","Space_Race","NASA","Leonard_Reiffel","Carl_Sagan","Moon_landing","Cold_War","Soviet_Union","Space_Race","Sputnik_1","Project_Vanguard","Sputnik_crisis","United_States","Explorer_1","DARPA","NASA","IIT_Research_Institute","Illinois_Institute_of_Technology","United_States_Air_Force","United_States_Secret_Service","October_Revolution","November_1957_lunar_eclipse","Terminator_(solar)","Edward_Teller","Leonard_Reiffel","Gerard_Kuiper","Carl_Sagan","Tellerâ€“Ulam_design","W25_(nuclear_warhead)","TNT_equivalent","Nuclear_weapon_yield","Little_Boy","Hiroshima","Intercontinental_ballistic_missile","Nuclear_fallout","Colonization_of_the_Moon","Far_side_of_the_Moon","Partial_Nuclear_Test_Ban_Treaty","Outer_Space_Treaty","High-altitude_nuclear_explosion","Operation_Hardtack_I","Operation_Argus","Operation_Dominic_I_and_II","The_K_Project","Apollo_11","University_of_California,_Berkeley","Miller_Institute","United_States_National_Research_Council","Freedom_of_information_in_the_United_States","David_Lowry","Neil_Armstrong"]}
