{"cursor":"31118","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"This is a list of 'Members of the [[Parliament of Australia|Australian\nParliament]] who have served in both the [[Australian Senate|Senate]] and the\n[[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]'.\n\nSection 43 of the Constitution of Australia says: \"A member of either House of\nthe Parliament shall be incapable of being chosen or of sitting as a member of\nthe other House\".\n\nConsequently, a member of one house who wishes to transfer to the other house\nmust resign from the first house before the election or appointment to the\nother house. A person may simultaneously stand for election to both houses, and\nif successful in both bids, must choose which house he or she will be a member\nof. No person has ever successfully stood for election to both houses at the\nsame time.\n\nThe following list comprises 41 men and 4 women. Of these:\n* 27 people were members of the House of Representatives before joining\n  the Senate\n* 18 people were members of the Senate before joining the House of\n  Representatives.\n\nThe first person to have been a member of both Houses was James McColl\n(Victoria), on 1 January 1907. All the other states and territories are\nrepresented in the list, the first person from each being:\n* Queensland: William Higgs, 13 April 1910\n* South Australia: William Story, 5 May 1917\n* New South Wales: Josiah Thomas, 1 July 1917\n* Tasmania: David O'Keefe, 16 December 1922\n* Western Australia: Thomas Marwick, 21 December 1940\n* Northern Territory: Grant Tambling, 11 July 1987\n* Australian Capital Territory: Bob McMullan, 2 March 1996.\n\nThe first woman to have been a member of both Houses was Kathy Sullivan (Qld),\non 1 December 1984.\n\nOnly 2 people have gone from one House to another and later returned to the\nfirst House:\n* Jack Duncan-Hughes, House of Representatives 1922â28, Senate 1931â38, House of\n  Representatives 1940â43\n* Sir Philip McBride, House of Representatives 1931â37, Senate 1937â44, House of\n  Representatives 1946â58.\n\nNo member of this list has yet served the Parliament for an aggregate period of\n30 years or more. The longest-serving person who has been a member of both\nHouses was Grant Chapman, who was in the Senate for 20 years 356 days, and in\nthe House of Representatives for 7 years 83 days, a total of 28 years 74 days.\nThe shortest-serving was Thomas Marwick (1 year 65 days in the Senate; 2 years\n244 days in the House of Representatives; a total of 3 years 309 days).\n\nIn the present Parliament, two senators (David Fawcett and Michael Ronaldson)\nwere previously members of the House of Representatives, and one member of the\nHouse of Representatives (Bronwyn Bishop) was previously a senator.\n\nNo person has ever represented one state or territory in one House and a\ndifferent state or territory in the other House, although various attempts have\nbeen made. One possible future example of this is current Queensland Senator\nBarnaby Joyce who has been selected by the National Party to contest the seat of\nNew England in New South Wales at the 2013 election. http://www.news.com.au/national-news/barnaby-joycewins-\npreselection-for-lower-house-seat-of-new-england/story-fncynjr2-\n1226619700846\n\nIncidentally, no person has ever represented more than one state or territory in\nthe Senate; but there are a number of members who represented different states\nor territories in the House of Representatives during their career.\n","linknr":570,"url":"People_who_have_served_in_both_Houses_of_the_Australian_Parliament","recorded":1375058858,"links":["/w/index.php?title=List_of_people_who_have_served_in_both_Houses_of_the_Australian_Parliament&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=List_of_people_who_have_served_in_both_Houses_of_the_Australian_Parliament&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","/wiki/List_of_people_who_have_served_in_both_Houses_of_the_Australian_Parliament","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","/w/index.php?title=People_who_have_served_in_both_Houses_of_the_Australian_Parliament&redirect=no","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Parliament_of_Australia","/wiki/Australian_Senate","/wiki/Australian_House_of_Representatives","/wiki/Constitution_of_Australia","/wiki/James_McColl_(Australian_politician)","/wiki/William_Higgs","/wiki/William_Story_(Australian_politician)","/wiki/Josiah_Thomas","/wiki/David_O%27Keefe_(Australian_politician)","/wiki/Thomas_Marwick","/wiki/Grant_Tambling","/wiki/Bob_McMullan","/wiki/Kathy_Sullivan_(Australian_politician)","/wiki/Jack_Duncan-Hughes","/wiki/Philip_McBride","/wiki/Members_of_the_Australian_Parliament_who_have_served_for_at_least_30_years","/wiki/Grant_Chapman","/wiki/Thomas_Marwick","/wiki/David_Fawcett","/wiki/Michael_Ronaldson","/wiki/Bronwyn_Bishop","/wiki/Barnaby_Joyce","/wiki/National_Party_of_Australia","/wiki/Division_of_New_England","/wiki/Australian_federal_election,_2013","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Members_of_the_Australian_House_of_Representatives_who_have_represented_more_than_one_state_or_territory","/w/index.php?title=List_of_people_who_have_served_in_both_Houses_of_the_Australian_Parliament&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Percy_Abbott_(Australian_politician)","/wiki/Australian_federal_election,_1925","#cite_note-def-2","/wiki/New_South_Wales","/wiki/Australian_federal_election,_1913","/wiki/Australian_federal_election,_1919","#cite_note-ret-3","/wiki/Division_of_New_England","/wiki/Oliver_Badman","#cite_note-res-4","/wiki/South_Australia","/wiki/Australian_federal_election,_1937","/wiki/Australian_federal_election,_1943","#cite_note-def-2","/wiki/Division_of_Grey","/wiki/Michael_Baume","#cite_note-res-4","/wiki/Australian_federal_election,_1975","/wiki/Australian_federal_election,_1983","#cite_note-def-2","/wiki/Division_of_Macarthur","/wiki/Robert_Best_(Australian_politician)","/wiki/Australian_federal_election,_1901","#cite_note-def-2","/wiki/Victoria_(Australia)","#cite_note-by-5","/wiki/Australian_federal_election,_1922","#cite_note-def-2","/wiki/Division_of_Kooyong","/wiki/Bronwyn_Bishop","/wiki/Australian_federal_election,_1987","#cite_note-res-4","#cite_note-by-5","/wiki/Division_of_Mackellar","/wiki/Fred_Chaney","/wiki/Australian_federal_election,_1974","#cite_note-res-4","/wiki/Western_Australia","/wiki/Australian_federal_election,_1990","/wiki/Australian_federal_election,_1993","#cite_note-ret-3","/wiki/Division_of_Pearce","/wiki/Grant_Chapman","/wiki/Australian_federal_election,_1987","/wiki/Australian_federal_election,_2007","#cite_note-def-2","/wiki/Australian_federal_election,_1975","/wiki/Australian_federal_election,_1983","#cite_note-def-2","/wiki/Division_of_Kingston","/wiki/Don_Chipp","#cite_note-res-4","#cite_note-by-5","/wiki/Australian_federal_election,_1969","#cite_note-trans-6","/wiki/Australian_federal_election,_1977","#cite_note-ret-3","/wiki/Division_of_Higinbotham","/wiki/Division_of_Hotham","/wiki/John_Coates_(Australian_politician)","#cite_note-res-4","/wiki/Tasmania","/wiki/Australian_federal_election,_1972","/wiki/Australian_federal_election,_1975","#cite_note-def-2","/wiki/Division_of_Denison","/wiki/Dick_Dein","#cite_note-def-2","/wiki/Australian_federal_election,_1931","/wiki/Australian_federal_election,_1934","#cite_note-ret-3","/wiki/Division_of_Lang","/wiki/Jack_Duncan-Hughes","/wiki/Australian_federal_election,_1931","#cite_note-ret-3","/wiki/Australian_federal_election,_1922","/wiki/Australian_federal_election,_1940","/wiki/Australian_federal_election,_1928","#cite_note-def-2","/wiki/Australian_federal_election,_1943","#cite_note-def-2","/wiki/Division_of_Boothby","/wiki/Division_of_Wakefield","/wiki/Gareth_Evans_(politician)","#cite_note-res-4","/wiki/Australian_federal_election,_1996","#cite_note-res-4","/wiki/Division_of_Holt","
