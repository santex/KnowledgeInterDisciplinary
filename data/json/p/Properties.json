Depending on\nthe nature of the property, an owner of property has the right to consume, sell,\nrent, mortgage, transfer, exchange or destroy it, or to exclude others from\ndoing these things.\n\nThe Restatement (First) of Property defines Property as any thing, tangible or\nintangible whereby a legal relationship between persons and the State enforces a\npossessory interest or legal title in that thing. This mediating relationship\nbetween individual, property and state is called as property regimes.\nPellissery, Sony (2012) Emerging Property Regimes In India: What It Holds\nFor the Future of Socio-Economic Rights? IRMA Working Paper 234\n\nImportant widely recognized types of property include real property (the\ncombination of land and any improvements to or on the land), personal property\n(physical possessions belonging to a person), private property (property owned\nby legal persons or business entities), public property (state owned or publicly\nowned and available possessions) and intellectual property (exclusive rights\nover artistic creations, inventions, etc.), although the latter is not always as\nwidely recognized or enforced. Anti-copyright advocates and other critics of\nintellectual property dispute the concept of intellectual\nproperty.[http://praxeology.net/anticopyright.htm]. A title, or a right of\nownership, establishes the relation between the property and other persons,\nassuring the owner the right to dispose of the property as the owner sees fit.\n","linknr":1073,"url":"Properties","recorded":1362555175,"links":81,"instances":["philosopher","virtue","property","polity","norm","author","finance","economics","philosophy","property","economics","economist","sociology"],"pdf":["http://www.basc.org.uk/media/2001_definition_of_sporting_rights.pdf","http://www.law.yale.edu/documents/pdf/Ellickson_Property_in_Land.pdf"],"categories":["Economic
