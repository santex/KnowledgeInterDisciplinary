{"cursor":"10521","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Pathological demand avoidance' (PDA) is a pattern of difficulties\ncharacterized as \"an obsessional avoidance of the ordinary demands of life\ncoupled with a degree of sociability that allowed social manipulation as a\nmajor skill\". It is proposed as a syndrome through the\nclinical work of UK-based child psychologist Elizabeth Newson. Newson proposed it to be a specific pervasive developmental disorder\n(PDD) within the PDD \"family\" which is now loosely termed the Autism\nspectrum.\n\nPDA is not part of the current American Psychiatric Association's manual of\nmental disorders DSM-\nIV, http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/dsm4TRclassification.htm or the World Health Organisation's manual ICD-\n10, http://www.who.int/classifications/icd/en nor is it part of the\nproposed revision, DSM-5. http://www.dsm5.org/Pages/Default.aspx Many\nclinicians are sceptical about the diagnosis and discuss whether this is a\nseparate condition or whether the behaviours found in PDA can be explained as a\nform of other disorders, for instance, attachment disorder, personality disorder\nor a female form of autism. However PDA has gained a degree of\nrecognition and acceptance from some clinicians as a diagnosis, sufficient that\nthe National Autistic Society (a UK autism charity) produced a leaflet entitled\n'What is PDA?' 'What is PDA?' - National Autistic Society (UK) http://www.autism.org.uk/about-autism/related-conditions/pda-pathological-\ndemand-avoidance-syndrome.aspx after recognising the disorder in 2008.\n","linknr":197,"url":"Pathological_demand_avoidance","recorded":1364198759,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Pathological_demand_avoidance&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Pathological_demand_avoidance&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pathological_demand_avoidance&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Template:Citation_needed","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","#cite_note-Newson-1","/wiki/Syndrome","#cite_note-Newson-1","/wiki/Pervasive_developmental_disorder","/wiki/Autism_spectrum","#cite_note-Newson-1","/wiki/American_Psychiatric_Association","/wiki/DSM-IV","#cite_note-2","/wiki/World_Health_Organisation","/wiki/ICD-10","#cite_note-3","/wiki/DSM-5","#cite_note-4","/wiki/Attachment_disorder","/wiki/Personality_disorder","#cite_note-5","#cite_note-6","#Characteristics","#Cause","#Diagnostic_criteria","#Who_diagnoses_it.3F","#Early_history","#Recognition","#Guidelines_for_management","#Support_group","#Book","#References","#Further_reading","/w/index.php?title=Pathological_demand_avoidance&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Jekyll_and_Hyde","/w/index.php?title=Pathological_demand_avoidance&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Autism","/wiki/Asperger_syndrome","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view","/wiki/Talk:Pathological_demand_avoidance","/w/index.php?title=Pathological_demand_avoidance&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/Autism_spectrum","/wiki/Theory_of_mind","/wiki/Psychological_manipulation","/wiki/Developmental_milestones","/wiki/Social_identity","/wiki/Shame","/wiki/Role_play","/wiki/Language_delay","/wiki/Autism_spectrum","#cite_note-7","#cite_note-8","/wiki/Lorna_Wing","/w/index.php?title=Judith_Gould_(psychologist)&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Pathological_demand_avoidance&action=edit&section=4","http://www.norsaca.org.uk/","#Recognition","/wiki/CAMHS","/w/index.php?title=Pathological_demand_avoidance&action=edit&section=5","/wiki/Autism","/wiki/Asperger_Syndrome","/wiki/PDD-NOS","/wiki/Pervasive_Developmental_Disorder_-_Not_Otherwise_Specified","#cite_note-9","#cite_note-10","#cite_note-11","#cite_note-12","/w/index.php?title=Pathological_demand_avoidance&action=edit&section=6","http://www.bild.org.uk/03journals_gap.htm","http://www.bild.org.uk/index.html","http://www.norsaca.org.uk/docs/Publications/PDA%20Pubs/1.9.pdf","http://www.autism.org.uk/","#cite_note-13","http://www.autism.org.uk/about-autism/related-conditions/pda-pathological-demand-avoidance-syndrome.aspx","http://www.autism.org.uk/asperger","http://www.autism.org.uk/about-autism/autism-and-asperger-syndrome-an-introduction/what-is-autism.aspx","/w/index.php?title=Pathological_demand_avoidance&action=edit&section=7","/w/index.php?title=Pathological_demand_avoidance&action=edit&section=8","http://ccgi.pdacontact.org.uk/forum/","/w/index.php?title=Pathological_demand_avoidance&action=edit&section=9","http://www.jkp.com/","http://www.jkp.com/search/index.php?s=understanding+PDA","/wiki/Special:BookSources/9781849050746","http://www.jkp.com/blog/2011/09/interview-understanding-pathological-demand-avoidance-syndrome-in-children/","/w/index.php?title=Pathological_demand_avoidance&action=edit&section=10","#cite_ref-Newson_1-0","#cite_ref-Newson_1-1","#cite_ref-Newson_1-2","http://adc.bmj.com/content/88/7/595.abstract","/wiki/Digital_object_identifier","http://dx.doi.org/10.1136%2Fadc.88.7.595","/wiki/PubMed_Central","//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1763174","/wiki/PubMed_Identifier","//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12818906","#cite_ref-2","http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/dsm4TRclassification.htm","#cite_ref-3","http://www.who.int/classifications/icd/en","#cite_ref-4","http://www.dsm5.org/Pages/Default.aspx","#cite_ref-5","http://www.aettraininghubs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/5.2-strategies-for-teaching-pupils-with-PDA.pdf","http://www.aettraininghubs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/5.2-strategies-for-teaching-pupils-with-PDA.pdf","#cite_ref-6","http://www.autism.org.uk/about-autism/related-conditions/pda-pathological-deman
