{"cursor":"7334","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nA 'pennon' was one of the principal three varieties of flags carried during\nthe Middle Ages (the other two were the banner and the standard).\n'Pennoncells' and 'streamers' or 'pendants' are minor varieties of this style\nof flag. The pennon is a flag resembling the guidon in shape, but only half\nthe size. It does not contain any coat of arms, but only crests, mottos and\nheraldic and ornamental devices.\n\nPennon comes from the Latin penna meaning \"a wing\" or \"a feather\". It was\nsometimes pointed, but more generally forked or swallow-tailed at the end. In\nthe 11th century, the pennon was generally square, one end being decorated with\nthe addition of pointed tongues or streamers, somewhat similar to the oriflamme.\nDuring the reign of Henry III, the pennon acquired the distinctive swallow-tail,\nor the single-pointed shape. Another version of the single-pointed pennon was\nintroduced in the 13th century. In shape this was a scalene triangle, obtained\nby cutting diagonally the vertically oblong banner.\n\n.]] The pennon was a purely personal ensign. It was essentially the flag of\nthe knight bachelor, as apart from the knight banneret, carried by him on his\nlance, displaying his personal armorial bearings, and set out so that they\nstood in correct position when he couched his lance for charging. A manuscript\nof the 16th century (Hari. 2358) in the British Museum, which gives detailed\nparticulars as to the size, shape and bearings of the standards, banners,\npennons and pennoncells, says \"a pennon must be two yards and a half long,\nmade round at the end, and contain the arms of the owner,\" and warns that\n\"from a standard or streamer a man may flee but not from his banner or pennon\nbearing his arms.\" A pennoncell (or penselle) was a diminutive pennon carried\nby the esquires.\n\nPennons were also used for any special ceremonial occasion, and more\nparticularly at state funerals. For instance, there were \"XII doz. penselles\"\namong the items that figured at the funeral of the Duke of Norfolk in 1554, and\nin the description of the lord mayor's procession in 1555, it reads \"two goodly\npennes (state barges) decked with flags and streamers, and a 1000 penselles.\"\nAmong the items that ran the total cost of the funeral of Oliver Cromwell up to\nan enormous sum of money, we find mention of 30 dozen of pennoncells a foot long\nand costing 20 shillings a dozen, and 20 dozen of the same kind of flags at 12\nshillings a dozen. \"For the solemnization of the funeral, no less than the\nsum of sixty thousand pounds was allotted to defray the expence\" .\n\n'' which sank in 1545. Here they have a cross of Saint George at the hoist and\nthe white and green heraldic colours of the House of Tudor along the rest of its\nlength. Illustration from the Anthony Roll.]] , also known as Harry Hotspur.]]\nThe streamer, so called in Tudor days but now better known as the pennant or\npendant, was a long, tapering flag, which it was directed \"shall stand in the\ntop of a ship or in the forecastle, and therein be put no arms, but the man's\ncognisance or device, and may be of length 20, 30, 40 or , and is slit as well\nas a guidon or standard\". Among the fittings of the ship that took Beauchamp,\nEarl of Warwick, to France in the reign of Henry VII was a \"great streamer for\nthe ship in length [and] in breadth\".\n\n's commissioning pennant.]] Besides the white ensign, ships commissioned in the\nRoyal Navy fly a long streamer from the maintopgallant masthead. This, which is\ncalled a pennant, is in fact the sign of command, and it is first hoisted when a\ncaptain commissions his ship. The pennant, which was really the old\n\"pennoncell\", was of three colours for the whole of its length, and towards the\nend left separate in two or three tails, and so continued until the end of the\nNapoleonic Wars. Now, however the pennant is a long white streamer with the St\nGeorge's cross in the inner portion close to the mast. Pennants have been\ncarried by men-of-war from the earliest times, prior to 1653 at the yard-arm,\nbut since that date at the maintopgallant masthead. There are other navies that\nalso fly pennant in a similar manner (see pennant (commissioning)).\n\n's Commissioning Pennant.]] The commissioning pennant in ships may end in a\npoint, but they can also be forked, in which case it is also called a\nbanderole. \"1. A long narrow flag, with cleft end, flying from the mast-\nheads of ships, carried in battle, etc.\" \n\nPennants are also associated with American sports teams, such as Major League\nBaseball and college sports teams. In Australian rules football, a pennant is\nawarded to the winner of major competitions. For many years, this was the only\nprize given. As a result, a League Championship is often referred to as a\n\"pennant,\" as in, \"The Giants win the Pennant!\" And in Australian football, a\npremiership can also be referred to as a \"flag.\"\n","linknr":195,"url":"Pennon","recorded":1374965452,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Pennon&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Pennon&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Ambox_globe_content.svg/48px-Ambox_globe_content.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Countering_systemic_bias","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pennon&action=edit","/wiki/Talk:Pennon","/wiki/File:Pennant_of_shipping_control_(East_Germany).svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/Pennant_of_shipping_control_%28East_Germany%29.svg/220px-Pennant_of_shipping_control_%28East_Germany%29.svg.png","/wiki/File:Pennant_of_shipping_control_(East_Germany).svg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Flag","/wiki/Middle_Ages","/wiki/Banner","/wiki/Heraldic_flag#Standard","#cite_note-FOOTNOTESwinburne1911456-1","/wiki/Guidon_(heraldic_flag)","/wiki/Crest_(heraldry)","/wiki/Motto","/wiki/Heraldic","/wiki/Wing","/wiki/Feather","/wiki/Oriflamme","/wiki/Henry_III_of_England","/wiki/Scalene_triangle","/wiki/File:Pennon_of_James_Douglas,_Earl_of_Moray_from_Otterburn_001.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/Pennon_of_James_Douglas%2C_Earl_of_Moray_from_Otterburn_001.jpg/200px-Pennon_of_James_Douglas%2C_Earl_of_Moray_from_Otterburn_001.jpg","/wiki/File:Pennon_of_James_Douglas,_Earl_of_Moray_from_Otterburn_001.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Battle_of_Otterburn","/wiki/Ensign","/wiki/Knight_bachelor","/wiki/Knight_banneret","/wiki/Armorial_bearings","/wiki/British_Museum","/w/index.php?title=Standard_(flag)&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Banner","/wiki/Esquire","#cite_note-FOOTNOTESwinburne1911456-1","/wiki/Duke_of_Norfolk","/wiki/Lord_Mayor_of_London","/wiki/Oliver_Cromwell","#cite_note-FOOTNOTESwinburne1911456.2C457-2","#cite_note-3","/wiki/File:AnthonyRoll-2_Mary_Rose.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5d/AnthonyRoll-2_Mary_Rose.jpg/220px-AnthonyRoll-2_Mary_Rose.jpg","/wiki/File:AnthonyRoll-2_Mary_Rose.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Mary_Rose","/wiki/St_George%27s_Cross","/wiki/House_of_Tudor","/wiki/Anthony_Roll","/wiki/File:Pennon_of_Sir_Henry_(Hotspur)_Percy,_Battle_of_Otterburn.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/69/Pennon_of_Sir_Henry_%28Hotspur%29_Percy%2C_Battle_of_Otterburn.jpg/200px-Pennon_of_Sir_Henry_%28Hotspur%29_Percy%2C_Battle_of_Otterburn.jpg","/wiki/File:Pennon_of_Sir_Henry_(Hotspur)_Percy,_Battle_of_Otterburn.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Henry_Percy_(Hotspur)","/wiki/Tudor_period","/wiki/Pennant","/wiki/Forecastle","/wiki/Heraldic_badge","/wiki/Coat_of_arms","#cite_note-FOOTNOTESwinburne1911458-4","/wiki/Beauchamp","/wiki/Earl_of_Warwick","/wiki/France","/wiki/Henry_VII_of_England","#cite_note-FOOTNOTESwinburne1911458-4","/wiki/File:Royal_Navy_commissioning_pennant_(with_outline).svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/Royal_Navy_commissioning_pennant_%28with_outline%29.svg/220px-Royal_Navy_commissioning_pennant_%28with_outline%29.svg.png","/wiki/File:Royal_Navy_commissioning_pennant_(with_outline).svg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Royal_Navy","/wiki/Pennant_(commissioning)","/wiki/Napoleonic_Wars","#cite_note-FOOTNOTESwinburne1911459-5","/wiki/Pennant_(commissioning)","/wiki/File:US_Coast_Guard_Commissioning_Pennant.gif","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/US_Coast_Guard_Commissioning_Pennant.gif/220px-US_Coast_Guard_Commissioning_Pennant.gif","/wiki/File:US_Coast_Guard_Commissioning_Pennant.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/US_Coast_Guard","/wiki/Banderole","#cite_note-6","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/Major_League_Baseball","/wiki/College","/wiki/Australian_rules_football","/wiki/San_Francisco_Giants","/w/index.php?title=Pennon&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Campaign_streamer","/wiki/Heraldic_standard","/wiki/Household_pennants_of_Finland","/w/index.php?title=Pennon&action=edit&se
