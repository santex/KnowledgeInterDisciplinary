In photometry, the radiant power\nat each wavelength is weighted by a luminosity function that models human\nbrightness sensitivity. Typically, this weighting function is the photopic\nsensitivity function, although the scotopic function or other functions may also\nbe applied in the same way.\n","linknr":330,"url":"Photometry_(optics)","recorded":1362481351,"links":44,"instances":["luminance","astronomy","unit"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Photometry|","Lighting"],"headings":["Photometry and the eye","Photometric quantities","Photometric measurement techniques","Non-SI photometry units","See also","Notes","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a0/Luminosity.png/420px-Luminosity.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["lumen","unit"],["stilb","luminance"],["photometry","astronomy"]],"members":["stilb","photometry","lumen"],"related":["Measurement","Light","Radiometry","Radiant_energy","Luminosity_function","Photopic_vision","Scotopic_vision","Human_eye","Wavelength","Visible_light","Photopic_vision","Scotopic_vision","Mesopic_vision","Infrared","Ultraviolet","Lumen_(unit)","Candela","Laser_pointer","Luminance","Radiance","Luminous_flux","Radiant_flux","Luminous_intensity","Radiant_intensity","Watt","Incandescent_bulb","Infrared","Compact_fluorescent_lamp","Steradian","Point_source","Nanometre","Photodetector","Photometer","Photocell","Goniophotometer","Footlambert","Millilambert","Stilb_(luminance)","Foot-candle","Phot","Reflectivity","List_of_light_sources","Photometry_(astronomy)","Spectrometer","Radiometer"]}
