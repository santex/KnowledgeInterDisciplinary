{"cursor":"2869","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Polyketides' are secondary metabolites from bacteria, fungi, plants, and\nanimals. Polyketides are usually biosynthesized through the decarboxylative\ncondensation of malonyl-CoA derived extender units in a similar process to fatty\nacid synthesis (a Claisen condensation).  The\npolyketide chains produced by a minimal polyketide synthase are often further\nderivitized and modified into bioactive natural products.\n\nPolyketides are structurally a very diverse family of natural products with\ndiverse biological activities and pharmacological properties. They are broadly\ndivided into three classes: type I polyketides (often macrolides produced by\nmultimodular megasynthases), type II polyketides (often aromatic molecules\nproduced by the iterative action of dissociated enzymes), and type III\npolyketides (often small aromatic molecules produced by fungal species).\nPolyketide antibiotics, antifungals, cytostatics, anticholesteremic,\nantiparasitics, coccidiostats, animal growth promoters and natural insecticides\nare in commercial use.\n","linknr":160,"url":"Polyketides","recorded":1362509792,"links":24,"instances":["chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Polyketide antibiotics","NADH dehydrogenase inhibitors","Plant toxin insecticides"],"headings":["Examples","Biosynthesis","See also","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["derivative","chemistry"]],"members":["derivative"],"related":["Secondary_metabolites","Bacterium","Fungi","Plant","Animal","Biosynthesis","Decarboxylase","Condensation_reaction","Malonyl-CoA","Claisen_condensation","Polyketide_synthase","Derivative_(chemistry)","Natural_product","Macrolides","Multimodular_megasynthase","Antibiotic","Antifungal_medication","Cytostatic","Anticholesteremic","Antiparasitics","Coccidiostat","Growth_factor","Insecticide","Macrolide","Pikromycin","Antibiotic","Erythromycin","Clarithromycin","Azithromycin","Immunosuppressant","Tacrolimus","Radicicol","HSP90","Polyene","Antibiotic","Amphotericin","Tetracycline","Antibiotic","Acetogenin","Bullatacin","Squamocin","Molvizarin","Uvaricin","Annonacin","Discodermolide","Aflatoxin","Usnic_acid","Polyketide_synthase","Enzyme","Esterase","Nonribosomal_peptide"]}
