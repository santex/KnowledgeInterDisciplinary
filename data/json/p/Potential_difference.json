[http://electrochem.cwru.edu/ed/dict.htm#v08 \"Voltage\"],\nElectrochemistry Encyclopedia Voltage is equal to the work which would\nhave to be done, per unit charge, against a static electric field to move the\ncharge between two points. A voltage may represent either a source of energy\n(electromotive force), or it may represent lost, used, or stored energy\n(potential drop). A voltmeter can be used to measure the voltage (or potential\ndifference) between two points in a system; usually a common reference potential\nsuch as the ground of the system is used as one of the points. Voltage can be\ncaused by static electric fields, by electric current through a magnetic field,\nby time-varying magnetic fields, or a combination of all three. Demetrius T.\nParis and F.
