{"cursor":"8504","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nA 'puddle' is a small accumulation of liquid, usually water, on a surface. It\ncan form either by pooling in a depression on the surface, or by surface tension\nupon a flat surface. Puddles are usually formed from rain water or from\nirrigation.\n\nA puddle is generally small enough for an adult to step over, shallow enough to\nwalk through, and too small to traverse in a boat or raft. Puddles can be a\nsource of fascination for children. Small wildlife may be attracted to puddles.\n","linknr":325,"url":"Puddle","recorded":1362371927,"links":43,"instances":["metallurgy","hydrology","hydrology","fluid_mechanics","meteorology"],"pdf":["http://peabody.research.yale.edu/jls/pdfs/1980s/1982/1982-36(3)161-Adler.pdf"],"categories":["Bodies of water","Springs (hydrology)","Limnology","Habitats","Bird feeding","Ecological restoration"],"headings":["Natural puddles and wildlife","Effects on transport","Physics","History","Recreation","Puddle theory","See also","Notes","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/Luzha_Garage.jpg/225px-Luzha_Garage.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8e/Exploring_new_continents_1200728.JPG/225px-Exploring_new_continents_1200728.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/Puddle.jpg/220px-Puddle.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Sacred_lotus_Nelumbo_nucifera.jpg/160px-Sacred_lotus_Nelumbo_nucifera.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["precipitation","meteorology"],["seep","hydrology"],["spring","hydrology"],["splash","fluid_mechanics"],["cant","road/rail"],["washington","u.s._state"],["puddling","engineering"],["puddling","metallurgy"],["seep","hydrology"],["spring","hydrology"]],"members":["puddling","spring","seep","splash","precipitation","cant","washington"],"related":["Liquid","Surface_tension","Rain","Irrigation","Boat","Raft","Natural_landscape","Habitat","Precipitation_(meteorology)","Seep_(hydrology)","Spring_(hydrology)","Butterfly","Mud-puddling","Nutrient","Salt","Amino_acid","Swallow","Loam","Cement","Intensive_farming","Urban_sprawl","Climate_change","Bird","Tadpoles","Mosquito","Bird_bath","Wildlife_garden","Garden_ornament","Restoration_ecology","Riparian","Grasses","Wildflower","Rain","Splash_(fluid_mechanics)","Pedestrian","Potholes","Ice","Evaporation","Cant_(road/rail)","Storm_drain","Aquifer","Standing_water","Pollution","Mosquito","Malaria","West_Nile_Virus","Physics","Liquid","Solid","Cobblestone","Pothole","Seattle","Washington_(U.S._state)","Walter_Raleigh","Queen_Elizabeth_I","Mud","Chivalry","Doctor_Foster","Douglas_Adams","Fine-tuned_Universe","Richard_Dawkins","Mud-puddling","Puddling_(engineering)","Puddling_(metallurgy)","Rill","Seep_(hydrology)","Spring_(hydrology)"]}
