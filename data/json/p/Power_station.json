{"cursor":"30102","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n]]\n\nA '[[Power (physics)|power]] station' (also referred to as a 'generating\nstation', 'power plant', 'powerhouse' or 'generating plant') is an industrial\nfacility for the generation of electric power. At the center of nearly all power\nstations is a generator, a rotating machine that converts mechanical power into\nelectrical power by creating relative motion between a magnetic field and a\nconductor. The energy source harnessed to turn the generator varies widely. It\ndepends chiefly on which fuels are easily available, cheap enough and on the\ntypes of technology that the power company has access to. Most power stations in\nthe world burn fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas to generate\nelectricity, and some use nuclear power, but there is an increasing use of\ncleaner renewable sources such as solar, wind, wave and hydroelectric. Central\npower stations produce AC power, after a brief Battle of Currents in the 19th\ncentury demonstrated the advantages of AC distribution.\n","linknr":543,"url":"Power_station","recorded":1362372090,"links":76,"instances":["water","mechanical","electrical","london"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Chemical engineering","Power
