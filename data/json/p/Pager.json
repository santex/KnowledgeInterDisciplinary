These systems can\nrange from a restaurant system with a single low-power transmitter, to a\nnationwide system with thousands of high-power base stations.\n\nThe first practical paging service was launched in 1950 for physicians in the\nNew York City area. Physicians paid US$12 per month for the service and carried\na (6 oz) pager that would receive phone messages within (25 mi) of a\nsingle transmitter tower. The system was manufactured by the 'Reevesound\nCompany' and operated by 'Telanswerphone'.

However, by the mid-1990's, as\ncellular technologies became cheaper and more widely available, advanced\nservices began to displace paging as a commercial product. Today, pagers exist\nlargely as niche products, finding preferential use in critical applications\nsuch as hospitals and public safety where their simplicity, high reliability,\nand low cost represent a significant advantage.
