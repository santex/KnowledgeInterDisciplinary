The basic activity of this brain region is considered\nto be orchestration of thoughts and actions in accordance with internal\ngoals.\n\nThe most typical psychological term for functions carried out by the prefrontal\ncortex area is executive function. Executive function relates to abilities to\ndifferentiate among conflicting thoughts, determine good and bad, better and\nbest, same and different, future consequences of current activities, working\ntoward a defined goal, prediction of outcomes, expectation based on actions, and\nsocial \"control\" (the ability to suppress urges that, if not suppressed, could\nlead to socially unacceptable outcomes).\n\nMany authors have indicated an integral link between a person's personality and\nthe functions of the prefrontal cortex.\n","linknr":633,"url":"Prefrontal_cortex","recorded":1362373305,"links":35,"instances":["mood","emotion"],"pdf":["http://www.thepsychologist.org.uk/archive/archive_home.cfm/volumeID_21-editionID_164-ArticleID_1399-getfile_getPDF/thepsychologist%5C0908look.pdf","http://www.thepsychologist.org.uk/archive/archive_home.cfm/volumeID_21-editionID_164-ArticleID_1399-getfile_getPDF/thepsychologist%5C0908look.pdf","http://socrates.berkeley.edu/~shimlab/2000_Shimamura_DynFilter.pdf","http://socrates.berkeley.edu/~shimlab/2000_Shimamura_DynFilter.pdf"],"categories":["Cerebrum"],"headings":["Definition","Etymology","Subdivisions","Interconnections","Studies","Executive Functions","Other disorders","Image","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/59/Gray726-Brodman-prefrontal.svg/300px-Gray726-Brodman-prefrontal.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/Brodmann_area_10_animation_small.gif/120px-Brodmann_area_10_animation_small.gif","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/Brodmann_area_10_frontal.jpg/120px-Brodmann_area_10_frontal.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7c/Brodmann_area_10_lateral.jpg/120px-Brodmann_area_10_lateral.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f2/Brodmann_area_10_medial.jpg/120px-Brodmann_area_10_medial.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["depression","mood"],["guilt","emotion"]],"members":["depression","guilt"],"related":["Brodmann_areas","Frontal_lobe","Superior_frontal_gyrus","Middle_frontal_gyrus","Inferior_frontal_gyrus","Anterior_cerebral_artery","Middle_cerebral_artery","Superior_sagittal_sinus","Anterior","Frontal_lobes","Brain","Primary_motor_cortex","Premotor_cortex","Psychology","Executive_system","Mediodorsal_nucleus","Cytoarchitectonics","Cerebral_cortex","Gyrus_rectus","Gyrus","Rostralis","Alfred_Walter_Campbell","Grafton_Elliot_Smith","Korbinian_Brodmann","Constantin_von_Economo","Georg_N._Koskinas","Carlyle_F._Jacobsen","Medial_dorsal_nucleus","Thalamus","Joaquin_Fuster","David_Ferrier","Prefrontal_bone","Orbitofrontal_cortex","Ventromedial_prefrontal_cortex","Phineas_Gage","Antonio_Damasio","Penguin_Putman_Pub.","Schizophrenia","Bipolar_disorder","ADHD","Guanfacine","Alpha-2A_adrenergic_receptor","HCN_channel","Interference_theory","Magnetoencephalography","Joaquin_Fuster","Patricia_Goldman-Rakic","Executive_functions","Wisconsin_Card_Sorting_Test","Neuroimaging","Attention_Deficit_Hyperactivity_Disorder","Schizophrenia","Depression_(mood)","Bipolar_disorder","Stressor","Suicide","Criminal","Antisocial_personality_disorder","Drug_addict","Guilt_(emotion)","Reality","Sentience","Brodmann_area_10","Attention_versus_memory_in_prefrontal_cortex","Self-model_theory_of_subjectivity"]}
