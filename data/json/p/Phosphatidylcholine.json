{"cursor":"13812","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Phosphatidylcholines' (PC) are a class of phospholipids that incorporate\ncholine as a headgroup. They are a major component of biological membranes and\ncan be easily obtained from a variety of readily available sources such as egg\nyolk or soy beans from which they are mechanically extracted or chemically\nextracted using hexane. They are also a member of the lecithin group of yellow-\nbrownish fatty substances occurring in animal and plant tissues. While\nphosphatidylcholines are found in all plant and animal cells, they are absent in\nthe membranes of some prokaryotes, such as Escherichia coli. Purified Phosphatidylcholine is produced commercially\nby companies like Lipoid, VAV Life Sciences, Avanti Polar etc.\n\nThe name \"lecithin\" was originally defined from the Greek lekithos (Î»ÎµÎºÎ¹Î¸Î¿Ï,\negg yolk) by Theodore Nicolas Gobley, a French chemist and pharmacist of the\nmid-19th century, who applied it to the egg yolk phosphatidylcholine that he\nidentified in 1847 and finally completely described from a chemical structural\npoint of view in 1874. Phosphatidylcholines are such a major component of\nlecithin that in some contexts the terms are sometimes used as synonyms.\nHowever, lecithin extract consists of a mixture of phosphatidylcholine and\nother compounds. It is also used along with sodium taurocholate for simulating\nfed- and fasted-state biorelevant media in dissolution studies of highly-\nlipophilic drugs.\n","linknr":1086,"url":"Phosphatidylcholine","recorded":1362569043,"links":36,"instances":["medicine"],"pdf":["http://www.freepatentsonline.com/4764508.pdf","http://www.freepatentsonline.com/20120189677.pdf"],"categories":["Phospholipids"],"headings":["Function","Structure and physical properties","Possible health benefits","Possible health risks","See also","Additional images","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylcholine.svg/300px-1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylcholine.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/83/Membrane_lipids.png/114px-Membrane_lipids.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c8/Choline_metabolism-en.svg/120px-Choline_metabolism-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/Phosphatidate2.png/120px-Phosphatidate2.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/Choline-skeletal.png/120px-Choline-skeletal.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["chronic","medicine"]],"members":["chronic"],"related":["Phospholipid","Choline","Biological_membrane","Egg_yolk","Soy","Hexane","Lecithin","Escherichia_coli","VAV_Life_Sciences","Greek_language","Theodore_Nicolas_Gobley","Taurocholic_acid","Lipophilicity","Cell_membrane","Phosphatidylcholine_transfer_protein","Cell_signalling","Saturated_fatty_acid","Unsaturated_fatty_acid","Phospholipase_D","Phosphatidate","Choline","Cytosol","Dementia","Systematic_review","Clinical_trials","Hepatitis_A","Hepatitis_B","Hepatitis_C","Chronic_(medicine)","Injection_lipolysis","Liposuction","Clinical_trials","Delayed_release","Catabolism","Atherosclerosis","Choline","Trimethylamine_oxide","Betaine","CDP_choline","Lysophosphatidylcholine","Theodore_Nicolas_Gobley","Saturated_fatty_acid","Unsaturated_fatty_acid","Membrane_lipids","Phosphatidic_acid","Choline"]}
