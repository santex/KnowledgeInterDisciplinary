It is the result of a tree or tree-like\nplants having completely transitioned to stone by the process of\npermineralization. All the organic materials have been replaced with minerals\n(mostly a silicate, such as quartz), while retaining the original structure of\nthe stem tissue. Unlike other types of fossils which are typically impressions\nor compressions, petrified wood is a three-dimensional representation of the\noriginal organic material. The petrifaction process occurs underground, when\nwood becomes buried under sediment and is initially preserved due to a lack of\noxygen which inhibits aerobic decomposition. Mineral-laden water flowing through\nthe sediment deposits minerals in the plant's cells; as the plant's lignin and\ncellulose decay, a stone mould forms in its place.\n\nIn general, stem tissue takes less than 100 years to petrify . The organic\nmatter needs to become petrified before it decomposes\ncompletely.
