{"cursor":"7139","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In epidemiology, the 'prevalence' or 'prevalence proportion' is the proportion\nof a population found to have a condition (typically a disease or a risk factor\nsuch as smoking or seat-belt use). It is arrived at by comparing the number of\npeople found to have the condition with the total number of people studied, and\nis usually expressed as a fraction, as a percentage or as the number of cases\nper 10,000 or 100,000 people. \"Point prevalence\" is the proportion of a\npopulation that has the condition at a specific point in time. \"Period\nprevalence\" is the proportion of a population that has the condition at some\ntime during a given period (\"12-month prevalence\", etc), and includes people who\nalready have the condition at the start of the study period as well as those who\nacquire it during that period. \"Lifetime prevalence\" (LTP) is the proportion of\na population that at some point in their life (up to the time of assessment)\nhave experienced the condition. \n\nPrevalence estimates are used by epidemiologists, health care providers,\ngovernment agencies and insurers. Prevalence is contrasted with incidence, which\nis a measure of new cases arising in a population over a given period (month,\nyear, etc.).\n","linknr":218,"url":"Prevalence","recorded":1362480351,"links":36,"instances":["tests","psychiatrist","epidemiology","tests"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Epidemiology","Medical statistics","Statistical ratios"],"headings":["Examples and utility","Limitations","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["incidence","epidemiology"],["incidence","epidemiology"],["robert_spitzer","psychiatrist"],["sensitivity","tests"],["specificity","tests"]],"members":["sensitivity","robert_spitzer","incidence","specificity"],"related":["Epidemiology","Incidence_(epidemiology)","Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention","Incidence_(epidemiology)","HIV","Chickenpox","Syndrome","Robert_Spitzer_(psychiatrist)","Columbia_University","Diagnostic_criteria","Medical_diagnosis","Sensitivity_(tests)","Specificity_(tests)","ROC_curve","Area_under_the_curve","Receiver_operating_characteristic","Type_I_and_type_II_errors","Type_I_and_type_II_errors","Positive_predictive_value","False_positive","Denominator_data","Rare_disease"]}
