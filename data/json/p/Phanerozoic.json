It covers roughly 542 million years () and goes back to the time when\ndiverse hard-shelled animals first appeared. Its name derives from the Ancient\nGreek words and , meaning visible life, since it was once believed that life\nbegan in the Cambrian, the first period of this eon. The time before the\nPhanerozoic, called the [[Precambrian]] supereon, is now divided into the\nHadean, Archaean and Proterozoic eons.\n\nThe time span of the Phanerozoic includes the rapid emergence of a number of\nanimal phyla; the evolution of these phyla into diverse forms; the emergence and\ndevelopment of complex plants; the evolution of fish; the emergence of insects\nand tetrapods; and the development of modern faunas. During this time span\ntectonic forces caused the continents to move and eventually collect into a\nsingle landmass known as Pangaea, which then separated into the current\ncontinental landmasses.\n","linknr":525,"url":"Phanerozoic","recorded":1362510548,"links":71,"instances":["geology","biology","geology"],"pdf":["http://www.stratigraphy.org/ics%20chart/ChronostratChart2012.pdf"],"categories":["Geological history of Earth","Geologic time scale","Phanerozoic|"],"headings":["Timing","Biodiversity","See also","Notes","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4d/Phanerozoic_Biodiversity.svg/300px-Phanerozoic_Biodiversity.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["eon","geology"],["phylum","biology"],["era","geology"]],"members":["eon","phylum","era"],"related":["British_English","Eon_(geology)","Geologic_timescale","Animal","Life","Ancient_Greek","Cambrian","Geological_period","Hadean","Archean","Proterozoic","Phylum_(biology)","Evolution","Evolutionary_history_of_plants","Evolution_of_fish","Phylogeny_of_insects","Evolution_of_tetrapods","Plate_tectonics","Pangaea","Proterozoic","Metazoa","Fossil","Taxon","Geologist","Paleontologist","Trilobite","Archaeocyatha","Coral","Small_shelly_fauna","Era_(geology)","Paleozoic","Mesozoic","Cenozoic","Hyperbolic_growth","Demography","Macrosociology","Exponential_growth","Logistic_distribution","Population_biology","Fossil","Positive_feedback","Negative_feedback","World_population","Geologic_time_scale","Paleoclimatology","Plate_tectonics"]}
