{"cursor":"4048","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n'The Prospect of Whitby' is a historic public house on the banks of the Thames\nat Wapping in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets. It lays claim to being the\nsite of the oldest riverside tavern, dating from around 1520. It was formerly\nknown as the Devilâs Tavern, on account of its dubious reputation. Before that\nit was officially called \"The Pelican\". All that remains from the buildingâs\nearliest period is the 400 year old stone floor. In former times it was a\nmeeting place for sailors, smugglers, cut-throats and footpads. Sir Hugh\nWilloughby sailed from here in 1533 in a disastrous attempt to discover the North-\nEast Passage to China.\n\nIn the 17th century, it became the hostelry of choice of \"Hanging\" Judge\nJeffreys, scourge of the Monmouth Rebellion. He lived nearby and a noose hangs\nby a window, commemorating his custom. He was chased by anti-Royalists into the\nnearby Town of Ramsgate, captured and taken to the Tower for his own safety.\nAccording to legend, criminals would be tied up to the posts at low tide and\nleft there to drown when the tide came in. Execution Dock was actually by\nWapping Old Stairs and generally used for pirates.

Writers Charles\nDickens and Samuel Pepys are known to have paused to sup here.\n\nFollowing a fire in the early 19th century, the tavern was rebuilt and renamed\nThe Prospect of Whitby, after a Tyne collier that used to berth next to the pub.\nThe Prospect was listed Grade II in December 1950. accessed 9 December\n2008\n\n\n\nOn the opposite side of the road (Wapping Wall) is the Wapping Hydraulic Power\nStation, now an arts centre and restaurant.\n\nThe public house features briefly in an episode of [[Only Fools And Horses]].\nWhen Uncle Albert goes missing in one episode, Del Boy and Rodney travel\naround London looking for him. Nicholas Lyndhurst is shown in one scene\nwalking out of the pub. There is also a scene from the 1956 film [[D-Day the\nSixth of June]] starring Robert Taylor and Richard Todd where Taylor's\ncharacter is seen with Dana Wynter's character having drinks together during\nthe Second World War in London.\n\nIn the comic book [[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]], Mina Harker pauses\nin front of the public house and says it brings back memories. She is referring\nto the beaching of the Demeter at Whitby in the novel [[Dracula]].\n\nThis pub is also featured in [[Jean Bruller|Vercors]]'s novel Les Animaux\ndÃ©naturÃ©s (translated variously into English as You Shall Know Them, Borderline,\nand The Murder of the Missing Link).\n","linknr":137,"url":"Prospect_of_Whitby","recorded":1374966100,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Prospect_of_Whitby&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Prospect_of_Whitby&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Wapping_prospect_of_whitby_1.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/67/Wapping_prospect_of_whitby_1.jpg/220px-Wapping_prospect_of_whitby_1.jpg","/wiki/File:Wapping_prospect_of_whitby_1.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Public_house","/wiki/River_Thames","/wiki/Wapping","/wiki/London_Borough_of_Tower_Hamlets","/wiki/Tavern","/wiki/Sailor","/wiki/Smuggler","/wiki/Footpad","/wiki/Hugh_Willoughby_(sea_captain)","/wiki/North-East_Passage","/wiki/China","/wiki/Hanging","/wiki/Judge_Jeffreys","/wiki/Monmouth_Rebellion","/wiki/Tower_of_London","/wiki/Execution_Dock","#cite_note-brit-1","/wiki/J._M._W._Turner","/wiki/James_McNeill_Whistler","/wiki/Charles_Dickens","/wiki/Samuel_Pepys","#cite_note-brit-1","/wiki/Collier_(ship_type)","/wiki/Listed_building","#cite_note-2","/wiki/File:Prospect_of_Whitby_(street_view).JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/Prospect_of_Whitby_%28street_view%29.JPG/220px-Prospect_of_Whitby_%28street_view%29.JPG","/wiki/File:Prospect_of_Whitby_(street_view).JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Wapping_Wall","/wiki/Wapping_Hydraulic_Power_Station","/wiki/Only_Fools_And_Horses","/wiki/Nicholas_Lyndhurst","/wiki/D-Day_the_Sixth_of_June","/wiki/Robert_Taylor_(actor)","/wiki/Richard_Todd","/wiki/Dana_Wynter","/wiki/Second_World_War","/wiki/The_League_of_Extraordinary_Gentlemen","/wiki/Mina_Harker","/wiki/Whitby","/wiki/Dracula","/wiki/Jean_Bruller","/w/index.php?title=Prospect_of_Whitby&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-brit_1-0","#cite_ref-brit_1-1","http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=45082","#cite_ref-2","http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/Details/Default.aspx?id=206332","/wiki/Images_of_England","/wiki/English_Heritage","/w/index.php?title=Prospect_of_Whitby&action=edit&section=2","http://www.pubs.com/main_site/pub_details.php?pub_id=183","/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system","//tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Prospect_of_Whitby&params=51_30_25.56_N_0_3_4.15_W_type:landmark_scale:3000","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Prospect_of_Whitby&oldid=541668687","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Grade_II_listed_buildings_in_London","/wiki/Category:Buildings_and_structures_in_Tower_Hamlets","/wiki/Category:Public_houses_in_London","/wiki/Category:Restaurants_in_London","/wiki/Category:History_of_Tower_Hamlets","/wiki/Category:Buildings_and_structures_on_the_River_Thames","/wiki/Category:Visitor_attractions_in_Tower_Hamlets","/wiki/Category:Grade_II_listed_public_houses","/wiki/Category:16th-century_establishments_in_England","/wiki/Category:Use_dmy_dates_from_August_2012","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Prospect+of+Whitby&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Prospect+of+Whitby","/wiki/Prospect_of_Whitby","/wiki/Talk:Prospect_of_Whitby","#","/wiki/Prospect_of_Whitby","/w/index.php?title=Prospect_of_Whitby&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Prospect_of_Whitby&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Prospect_of_Whitby","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Prospect_of_Whitby","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Prospect_of_Whitby&oldid=541668687","/w/index.php?title=Prospect_of_Whitby&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3924088
