This distinguishes descriptive\nknowledge from what is commonly known as \"know-how\", or procedural knowledge\n(the knowledge of how, and especially how best, to perform some task), and\n\"knowing of\", or knowledge by acquaintance (the knowledge of something's\nexistence).\n\nThe difference between knowledge and beliefs is as follows:. A belief is an\ninternal thought or memory which exists in one's mind. Most people accept that\nfor a belief to be knowledge it must be, at least, true and justified. The\nGettier problem in philosophy is the question of whether there are any other\nrequirements before a belief can be accepted as knowledge.\n\nThe article Knowledge (philosophy) discusses the view of philosophers on how one\ncan tell which beliefs constitute actual knowledge.\n","linknr":307,"url":"Propositional_knowledge","recorded":1362690141,"links":20,"instances":["knowledge","philosophy","logic","spiritual","theology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Knowledge","Semantics","Concepts in epistemology"],"headings":["Acquiring knowledge","Types of knowledge","Knowledge in various disciplines","Situated knowledge","Issues","Non-scientific methods","Practical limits for obtaining knowledge","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["knowledge","philosophy"],["intuition","knowledge"],["enlightenment","spiritual"],["light","theology"],["specialization","logic"]],"members":["intuition","knowledge","specialization","enlightenment","light"],"related":["Knowledge","Procedural_knowledge","Knowledge_by_acquaintance","Belief","Thought","Memory","Mind","Truth","Theory_of_justification","Gettier_problem","Knowledge_(philosophy)","Opinion","Reason","Logic","Logical_argument","Mathematical_proof","Scientific_method","Trial_and_error","Algorithm","Experience","Intuition_(knowledge)","Appeal_to_authority","Testimony","Witness","Observing","Language","Culture","Tradition","Bohm_Dialogue","Enlightenment_(spiritual)","Meditation","Bodhi","Light_(theology)","Prayer","Revelation","Empirical_knowledge","Isaac_Newton","Standing_on_the_shoulders_of_giants","Robert_Hooke","Logic","Theory","Verification_theory","Experiment","General_semantics","Scientist","Scientific_method","Experiment","Falsifiability","Peer_review","Scientific_theory","Civil_engineer","Statics","Physics","Specialization_(logic)","Dan_Schechtman","History","Archeology","Napoleon","Battle_of_Waterloo","Gebhard_Leberecht_von_Bl√ºcher","Starting_condition","Teleology","Social_science","Historical_interpretation","Primary_source","Historical_revisionism","Truth","Philosopher","Social_science","History","Ludwig_Wittgenstein","Aphorism","Philosophy_of_action","Logic","Postmodernists","Social_constructionism","Deconstruction","Logic","Science","Roger_Bacon","Alchemy","Astrology","Philosophy","Science","Data","Descriptive_science","Epistemology","Information","Information_theory","Inquiry","Instructional_capital","Knowledge","Knowledge_management","Knowledge_tagging","Knowledge_transfer","Normative_science","Procedural_knowledge","Semiotic_information_theory","Tacit_knowledge","Truth","Understanding","Wisdom"]}
