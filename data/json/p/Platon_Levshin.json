{"cursor":"6219","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n'Plato II' or 'Platon II' (29 June 1737 – 11 November 1812) was the\nMetropolitan of Moscow from 1775 to 1812. He personifies the Age of\nEnlightenment in the Russian Orthodox Church.\n\nHe was born at Chashnikovo near Moscow as Platon Levshin () in the family of a\npsalmodist, and was educated at the seminary and the Slavic Greek Latin Academy\nof Moscow. In 1757 he was appointed instructor in Greek and rhetoric at the\nlatter institution, and became distinguished as a pulpit orator. Within the year\nhe was called to be instructor in rhetoric at the Troitse-Sergiyeva Lavra near\nMoscow. Here he became a monk, adopting the name of Platon, and in 1761 was made\nrector of the seminary of the monastery. A sermon preached by him in October\n1762, produced so favorable an impression on the Empress Catherine II that she\nsummoned him to court to be the religious instructor of the eight-year-old heir\napparent, Paul Petrovitch. Here he came into close contact with Voltaire and the\nencyclopedists, but without injury either to his faith or his character.\n\nPlaton remained at the Russian court, winning the admiration of even Voltaire,\nuntil the marriage of the heir apparent to Maria Feodorovna, daughter of Duke\nEugene of WÃ¼rttemberg, in 1773. During this time he published, for the use of\nhis royal pupil, his Orthodox Doctrine: or, A short Compend of Christian\nTheology (Moscow, 1765), in which the influence of Western thought, and even of\nrationalism, may be distinctly traced. At the same time, Roman Catholic\ndoctrines are mercilessly attacked, while the Lutheran tenet of ubiquity and the\nReformed theory of predestination also receive their share of criticism. This\ncatechism was followed, a year later, by the Exhortation of the Orthodox Eastern\nCatholic Church of Christ to her former Children, now on the Road to Schism,\npleading, though with scant success, for lenient treatment of dissenters from\nthe Orthodox Church.\n\nIn 1768 Platon became a member of the Holy Synod, and in 1770 was made bishop of\nTver, though he still remained at St. Petersburg, finally being the religious\ninstructor of the new grand duchess. In 1775 he was enthroned archbishop of\nMoscow, and throughout the reigns of Catherine II, Paul, and Alexander I\ndiligently promoted the religious, moral, intellectual, and material welfare of\nhis archdiocese, maintaining meanwhile an unceasing literary activity.\n\nIn 1775 he issued a catechism for the use of the clergy, and in 1776 a short\ncatechism for children, as well as one in the form of a dialogue, while his\nbrief history of the Russian Church (1777) is the first systematic treatise of\nits kind in the Russian language. In 1787 Platon reluctantly consented to become\nmetropolitan of Moscow. He visited the city but seldom, however, passing the\nwinter in the Troitsky monastery and the summer in the Pererva Monastery close\nto Moscow. Here he supervised personally the studies of the seminarians, who\nincluded three destined to succeed him as archbishop of Moscow.\n\nCompared to his predecessors, Platon was rather lenient towards the Old\nBelievers and allowed them to establish their first chapels in Moscow, notably\nthe Preobrazhenskoe cemetery. He also formalized the arrangement, known as\nEdinoverie, earlier introduced by Archbishop Nikephoros of Slaviansk, that\nallowed Old Believer communities to join the established church, while\nmaintaining their traditional form of worship. Vladimir\nKarpets, [http://www.pravaya.ru/faith/118/2777 What is Edinoverie?] \n\nIt was Platon who crowned both Paul (1797) and Alexander I (1801); but despite\nhis close and cordial relations with the court he preserved to the last his\nfirmness and his independence. Shortly before his death he aided in preparing\nthe way for the foundation of the Russian Bible Society which was established in\nthe year in which he died. Shortly before his death, Platon was evacuated from\nMoscow, which was about to be surrendered to Napoleon.\n\nThe collected works of Platon were published at Moscow in twenty volumes in\n1779â1807, the greater portion of these writings being sermons, of which there\nare about 500. An abridged English translation of Platon's catechism was\nprepared from a Greek version of the Russian original (London, 1867), and his\nsermon preached at the request of the empress to celebrate the victory of Chesma\nalso appeared in English (London, 1770).\n","linknr":156,"url":"Platon_Levshin","recorded":1375077473,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Platon_Levshin&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Platon_Levshin&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/PLATO_(computer_system)","/wiki/File:Plato_II.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/Plato_II.jpg/220px-Plato_II.jpg","/wiki/File:Plato_II.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Metropolitan_bishop","/wiki/Moscow","/wiki/Russian_Enlightenment","/wiki/Russian_Orthodox_Church","/wiki/Russian_language","/wiki/Psalm","/wiki/Slavic_Greek_Latin_Academy","/wiki/Greek_language","/wiki/Rhetoric","/wiki/Troitse-Sergiyeva_Lavra","/wiki/Catherine_the_Great","/wiki/Paul_I_of_Russia","/wiki/Voltaire","/wiki/Encyclopedist","/wiki/Heir_apparent","/wiki/Maria_Feodorovna_(Sophie_Dorothea_of_W%C3%BCrttemberg)","/wiki/Friedrich_II_Eugen,_Duke_of_W%C3%BCrttemberg","/wiki/Roman_Catholic","/wiki/Lutheran","/wiki/Predestination","/wiki/Orthodox_Church","/wiki/Holy_Synod","/wiki/Tver","/wiki/St._Petersburg","/wiki/Alexander_I_of_Russia","/wiki/Catechism","/wiki/Troitsky_monastery","/wiki/Pererva_Monastery","/wiki/Old_Believers","/wiki/Moscow","/wiki/Preobrazhenskoe_cemetery","/wiki/Edinoverie","/wiki/Nikephoros_Theotokis","/wiki/Slaviansk","#cite_note-karpets-1","/wiki/Russian_Bible_Society","/wiki/Moscow","/wiki/Napoleon","/wiki/Battle_of_Chesma","/w/index.php?title=Platon_Levshin&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/File:PD-icon.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/62/PD-icon.svg/12px-PD-icon.svg.png","/wiki/Public_domain","/wiki/New_Schaff%E2%80%93Herzog_Encyclopedia_of_Religious_Knowledge#External_links","/wiki/New_Schaff%E2%80%93Herzog_Encyclopedia_of_Religious_Knowledge","/wiki/File:Wikisource-logo.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/12px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png","//en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Platon,_Levshin","/wiki/Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica_Eleventh_Edition","/wiki/File:PD-icon.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/62/PD-icon.svg/12px-PD-icon.svg.png","/wiki/Public_domain","/wiki/Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica_Eleventh_Edition","/w/index.php?title=Platon_Levshin&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-karpets_1-0","http://www.pravaya.ru/faith/118/2777","/w/index.php?title=Platon_Levshin&action=edit&section=3","http://platon.bogoslov.ru","http://www.krotov.info/spravki/persons/18person/1812.html","/wiki/Alexander_Men","http://www.rulex.ru/01160379.htm","/wiki/Orthodox_Christianity","/w/index.php?title=Samouel_of_Krutitsy&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/List_of_Metropolitans_and_Patriarchs_of_Moscow","/w/index.php?title=Avgustin&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Platon_Levshin&oldid=541322741","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Russian_theologians","/wiki/Category:Metropolitans_and_Patriarchs_of_Moscow","/wiki/Category:1737_births","/wiki/Category:1812_deaths","/wiki/Category:18th-century_Eastern_Orthodox_bishops","/wiki/Category:19th-century_Eastern_Orthodox_bishops","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_Russian-language_external_links","/wiki/Category:Articles_containing_Russian-language_text","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_incorporating_a_citation_from_the_Schaff-Herzog_with_no_title_parameter","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_incorporating_text_from_the_Schaff-Herzog","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_incorporating_a_citation_from_the_1911_Encyclopaedia_Britannica_with_an_unnamed_parameter","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_incorporating_a_citation_from_the_1911_Encyclopaedia_Britannica_with_no_article_parameter","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_incorporating_text_from_the_1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Platon+Levshin&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Platon+Levshin","/wiki/Platon_Levshin","/wiki/Talk:Platon_Levshin","#","/wiki/Platon_Levshin","/w/index.php?title=Platon_Levshin&action=edit","/w/index.ph
