Examples include the works of Shakespeare and\nBeethoven, The King James Bible, most of the early silent films, the formulae of\nNewtonian physics, and the patents on powered flight.\nThe term is not normally applied to situations when the creator of a work\nretains residual rights, in which case use of the work is referred to as \"under\nlicense\" or with permission.\n\nIn informal usage, the public domain consists of works that are publicly\navailable; while according to the formal definition it consists of works that\nare unavailable for private ownership or are available for public use. As rights are country-based and vary, a work may be\nsubject to rights in one country and not in another. Some rights depend on\nregistrations with a country-by-country basis, and the absence of\nregistration in a particular country, if required, implies public domain\nstatus in that country.\n\nPublic Domain is one of the traditional safety valves in copyright law.\n","linknr":572,"url":"Public_domain","recorded":1362561113,"links":95,"instances":["academic"],"pdf":["http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ01.pdf","http://www.sunsteinlaw.com/media/2012_01%20Copyright_Chart.pdf","http://mises.org/books/against.pdf"],"categories":["Public domain|","Copyright law","Intellectual property law"],"headings":["History","Definition","Value","Relationship with derivative works","Relationship with the Information Society","Perpetual copyright","Application to copyrightable works","Patents","Trademarks","Public domain calculators","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/41/NewtonsPrincipia.jpg/220px-NewtonsPrincipia.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f5/Konchog-wangdu.jpeg/220px-Konchog-wangdu.jpeg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/6e/Marcel_Duchamp_Mona_Lisa_LHOOQ.jpg/150px-Marcel_Duchamp_Mona_Lisa_LHOOQ.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["james_boyle","academic"]],"members":["james_boyle"],"related":["Intellectual_property","Shakespeare","Ludwig_van_Beethoven","King_James_Bible","Silent_Film","Newtonian_physics","Patents","Powered_flight","Private_ownership","Traditional_safety_valves","Copyright_law","Copyright_law","Statute_of_Anne","Copyright_term","Alfred_de_Vigny","Copyright","Patents","Trademarks","Pamela_Samuelson","Kangyur","James_Boyle_(academic)","Public_property","Private_property","Copyright_exceptions","Fair_use","Public_sphere","Commons","Pamela_Samuelson","Mona_Lisa","Derivative_works","Translations","Musical_arrangements","Dramatizations","Frances_Hodgson_Burnett","Tom_Stoppard","Troma_Entertainment","Marcel_Duchamp","Leonardo_Da_Vinci","Bernt_Hugenholtz","Lucie_Guibault","Personal_data","Nucleic_acid_sequence","Idea","Intellectual_property","Contract_law","Crown_copyright","Authorized_King_James_Version","J._M._Barrie","Great_Ormond_Street_Hospital","Idea","Idea-expression_divide","The_Bible","Archimedes","Translation","United_States","List_of_countries'_copyright_length","Directive_harmonizing_the_term_of_copyright_protection","Work_of_the_United_States_Government","Building_codes","Melville_Nimmer","Trademark","Genericized_trademark","Bayer","Hormel","Genericized_trademark","Europeana","European_Union","Berne_Convention_for_the_Protection_of_Literary_and_Artistic_Works","Copyfraud","Copyleft","Copyright_status_of_work_by_the_U.S._government","Copyright_Term_Extension_Act","Creative_Commons","Center_for_the_Study_of_the_Public_Domain","Duke_University_Law_School","Eldred_v._Ashcroft","Fair_dealing","Free_software","Limitations_and_exceptions_to_copyright","List_of_countries'_copyright_length","List_of_films_in_the_public_domain_in_the_United_States","Orphan_works","Public_Domain_Day","Public_Domain_Enhancement_Act","Public_domain_film","Public_domain_image_resources","Public_domain_in_the_United_States","Public_domain_music","Public_domain_software","Rule_of_the_shorter_term","Europeana"]}
