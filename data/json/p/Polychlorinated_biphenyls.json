The chemical\nformula for a PCB is C 12 H10-x Cl x. 130 of the\n209 different PCB arrangements and orientations are used commercially. Mahan, M. (1998, May 4). Are pcbs\nstill a problem in the great lakes?. Retrieved from\nhttp://www.cevl.msu.edu/~long/pcb.htm\n\nPCBs were widely used as dielectric and coolant fluids, for example in\ntransformers, capacitors, and electric motors. Due to PCBs' environmental\ntoxicity and classification as a persistent organic pollutant, PCB production\nwas banned by the United States Congress in 1979 and by the Stockholm Convention\non Persistent Organic Pollutants in 2001.

Therefore, the current maximum\ncontaminant level as stated by the EPA for PCBs in drinking water systems is 0.5\nppb. US EPA: Safewater (8/05/2009). Consumer factsheet on polychlorinated\nbiphenyls.
