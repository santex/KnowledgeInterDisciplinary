The term polypropylene glycol or 'PPG' is\nreserved for low to medium range molar mass polymer when the nature of the end-\ngroup, which is usually a hydroxyl group, still matters. The term \"oxide\" is\nused for high molar mass polymer when end-groups no longer affect polymer\nproperties. In 2003, 60% of the annual production of propylene oxide of\n6.6Ã—10 6 tonnes was converted into the polymer.
