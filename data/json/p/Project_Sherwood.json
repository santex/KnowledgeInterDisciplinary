It was funded under the Atoms for Peace\ninitiative during the administration of President Dwight D. Eisenhower.\nThe name Sherwood was suggested by Paul McDaniel, Deputy Director of the\nAtomic Energy Commission(AEC), as a play on the fact that funding for\nresearch at a facility known as the Hood Building was ârobbed to pay\nFriar Tuckâ, a reference to the British physicist and fusion researcher\nJames L. Tuck. Bromberg, Joan Lisa (1982) Fusion: Science, Politics,\nand the Invention of a New Energy Source MIT Press, Cambridge,\nMassachusetts, [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ECOvgg7b3MQC&pg=PA97\np. 44], ISBN 0-262-02180-3\n\nThe program was a secret but nonmilitary spin off of work begun in Project\nMatterhorn where the goal of fusion reactors had been to generate neutrons for\nconverting uranium to plutonium and to provide a source of tritium for\nthermonuclear weapons. But the prospect of turning cheap and inexhaustible\nhydrogen into inexpensive power captured the imagination of Lewis Strauss, the\nAEC chairman from 1953 to 1958, who believed fusion reactors could generate\nelectricity âtoo cheap to meterâ. Pfau, Richard (1984) No Sacrifice Too\nGreat: The Life of Lewis L. Strauss University Press of Virginia,\nCharlottesville, Virginia, [http://www.amazon.com/dp/0813910382 p. 187, ISBN 978-0-8139-1038-\n3] Under Strauss the program was reorganized and its funding and staffing\nincreased dramatically. At its peak Project Sherwood had a budget of $23 million\nper year and retained more than 500 scientists. Pfau, p. 209\n\nResearch centered on three plasma confinement designs; the stellarator headed\nby Lyman Spitzer at the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory, the toroidal\npinch or Perhapsatron led by James Tuck at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory\nand the magnetic mirror devices at the Livermore National Laboratory led by\nRichard F. Post.\n\nBy June, 1954 a preliminary study had been completed for a full scale \"Model D\"\nstellarator that would be over 500 feet long and produce 5,000 MW of electricity\nat a capital cost of $209 per kilowatt. Bromberg, p. 47\n\nHowever, each concept would encounter unanticipated problems in the form of\nplasma instabilities that prevented the requisite temperatures and pressures\nfrom being achieved and it eventually became clear sustained hydrogen fusion\nwould not be quickly developed. Strauss left AEC in 1958 and his successor\ndid not share Strauss' enthusiasm for fusion research. Consequently, Project\nSherwood was relegated from a crash program to one that concentrated on\nbasic research.\n","linknr":106,"url":"Project_Sherwood","recorded":1374861094,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Project_Sherwood&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Project_Sherwood&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/Nuclear_fusion","/wiki/Atoms_for_Peace","/wiki/Dwight_D._Eisenhower","/wiki/United_States_Atomic_Energy_Commission","/wiki/James_L._Tuck","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Project_Matterhorn","/wiki/Thermonuclear_weapon","/wiki/Lewis_Strauss","/wiki/Too_cheap_to_meter","#cite_note-2","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Stellarator","/wiki/Lyman_Spitzer","/wiki/Princeton_Plasma_Physics_Laboratory","/wiki/Perhapsatron","/wiki/James_L._Tuck","/wiki/Oak_Ridge_National_Laboratory","/wiki/Magnetic_mirror","/wiki/Livermore_National_Laboratory","/wiki/Richard_F._Post","#cite_note-4","/w/index.php?title=Project_Sherwood&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ECOvgg7b3MQC&pg=PA97","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0262021803","#cite_ref-2","http://www.amazon.com/dp/0813910382","#cite_ref-3","#cite_ref-4","/w/index.php?title=Project_Sherwood&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Timeline_of_nuclear_fusion","/wiki/Stellarator","/wiki/Magnetic_mirror","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Project_Sherwood&oldid=561766477","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Engineering_projects","/wiki/Category:Nuclear_fusion","/wiki/Category:Nuclear_history_of_the_United_States","/wiki/Category:Atoms_for_Peace","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Project+Sherwood&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Project+Sherwood","/wiki/Project_Sherwood","/wiki/Talk:Project_Sherwood","#","/wiki/Project_Sherwood","/w/index.php?title=Project_Sherwood&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Project_Sherwood&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Project_Sherwood","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Project_Sherwood","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Project_Sherwood&oldid=561766477","/w/index.php?title=Project_Sherwood&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7249318","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Project_Sherwood&id=561766477","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Project+Sherwood","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Project+Sherwood&oldid=561766477&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Project_Sherwood&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7249318#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Sherwood","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Engineering
