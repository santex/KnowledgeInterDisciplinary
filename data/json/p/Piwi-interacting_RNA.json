Lau, The Coming of Age for Piwi Proteins.\nMolecular Cell, 2007. 26(5): p. 603-609. piRNAs form RNA-protein complexes\nthrough interactions with piwi proteins. These piRNA complexes have been linked\nto both epigenetic and post-transcriptional gene silencing of retrotransposons\nand other genetic elements in germ line cells, particularly those in\nspermatogenesis.

They are distinct from microRNA (miRNA) in size (26â31\nnt rather than 21â24 nt), lack of sequence conservation, and increased\ncomplexity.\n\nIt remains unclear how piRNAs are generated, but potential methods have been\nsuggested, and it is certain their biogenesis pathway is distinct from miRNA and\nsiRNA, while rasiRNAs are a piRNA subspecies.
