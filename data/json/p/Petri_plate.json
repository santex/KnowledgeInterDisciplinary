Ralf Reski (1998): Development, genetics and molecular\nbiology of mosses. Botanica Acta 111, pp 1â15. It was named after German\nbacteriologist Julius Richard\nPetri, [http://education.yahoo.com/reference/dictionary/entry/Petri+dish\nPetri dish] in the American Heritage Dictionary who invented it when\nworking as an assistant to Robert Koch. Glass Petri dishes can be reused by\nsterilization (for example, in an autoclave or by dry heating in a hot air oven\nat 160 Â°C for one hour). For experiments where cross-contamination from one\nexperiment to the next can become a problem, plastic Petri dishes are often used\nas disposables.\n\nModern Petri dishes often have rings on the lids and bases, which allow them to\nbe stacked so that they do not slide off one another. Multiple dishes can also\nbe incorporated into one plastic container to create what is called a \"multi-\nwell plate\". Petri dishes are usually used to culture bacteria.\n","linknr":261,"url":"Petri_plate","recorded":1362484285,"links":52,"instances":["microbiology","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Laboratory glassware","Microbiology equipment"],"headings":["Microbiology","Other uses","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8e/Szalka_petriego.jpg/220px-Szalka_petriego.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/93/Agar_plate_with_colonies.jpg/220px-Agar_plate_with_colonies.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/07/Physcomitrella_growing_on_agar_plates.jpg/220px-Physcomitrella_growing_on_agar_plates.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cell","biology"],["sterilization","microbiology"]],"members":["sterilization","cell"],"related":["Glass","Plastic","Cylindrical","Microbiologist","Microbiological_culture","Cell_(biology)","Ralf_Reski","Germany","Julius_Richard_Petri","American_Heritage_Dictionary","Robert_Koch","Sterilization_(microbiology)","Autoclave","Disposables","Agar","Growth_medium","Agar_plate","Microbiological_culture","Agar","Nutrients","Blood","Salts","Carbohydrates","Dyes","Amino_acid","Antibiotic","Inoculation","Axenic","Cell_culture"]}
