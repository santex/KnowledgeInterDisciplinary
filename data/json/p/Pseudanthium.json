{"cursor":"6504","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nA 'pseudanthium' (Greek for \"false flower\") or 'flower head' is a special type\nof inflorescence, in which several flowers are\ngrouped together to form a flower-like structure. The real flowers are generally\nsmall and greatly reduced, but can sometimes be quite large (as in the sunflower\nflower head). Pseudanthia take various forms. The individual flowers of a\npseudanthium can be called florets.\n\nPseudanthia are characteristic of the daisy and sunflower family (Asteraceae),\nwhose flowers are differentiated into ray and disk flowers, unique to this\nfamily. The disk flowers in the center of the pseudanthium are actinomorphic and\nthe corolla is fused into a tube. Flowers on the periphery are zygomorphic and\nthe corolla has one large lobe (the so-called \"petals\" of a daisy are individual\nray flowers, for example). Either ray or disk flowers may be absent in some\nplants: [[Senecio vulgaris]] lacks ray flowers\nand [[Taraxacum officinale]] lacks disk flowers. The pseudanthium has a whorl of bracts below the\nflowers, forming an involucre.\n\nIn all cases, a pseudanthium (inflorescence) is superficially indistinguishable\nfrom a flower, but closer inspection of its anatomy will reveal that it is\ncomposed of multiple flowers. Thus, the pseudanthium represents an evolutionary\nconvergence of the inflorescence to a reduced reproductive unit that may\nfunction in '[[pollination]]' like a single flower, at least in plants that are\nanimal pollinated.\n","linknr":192,"url":"Pseudanthium","recorded":1362482843,"links":21,"instances":["flower","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Plant morphology"],"headings":["Related terms","Plant families","Gallery","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/Flower_July_2011-2_1_cropped.jpg/200px-Flower_July_2011-2_1_cropped.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Spathiphyllum_cochlearispathum_RTBG.jpg/150px-Spathiphyllum_cochlearispathum_RTBG.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/17/Hoofdje.jpg/120px-Hoofdje.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d5/Bellis_perennis_white_%28aka%29.jpg/120px-Bellis_perennis_white_%28aka%29.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a3/Flower_head.jpg/120px-Flower_head.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/11/Hieracium_2007-1.jpg/120px-Hieracium_2007-1.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/EricameriaNauseosa_8691.JPG/85px-EricameriaNauseosa_8691.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["family","biology"],["corolla","flower"]],"members":["corolla","family"],"related":["Inflorescence","Flower","Sunflower","Family_(biology)","Asteraceae","Ray_flower","Disk_flower","Actinomorphic","Corolla_(flower)","Zygomorphic","Bract","Involucral_bract","Sphagnum","Apiaceae","Araceae","Spadix","Asteraceae","Campanulaceae","Centrolepidaceae","Cornaceae","Cyperaceae","Dipsacaceae","Euphorbiaceae","Cyathium","Eriocaulaceae","Hamamelidaceae","Moraceae","Poaceae","Pontederiaceae","Proteaceae","Rubiaceae","Saururaceae","Hydatellaceae","Lemnaceae","Pandanaceae","Triuridaceae","Phyllanthaceae","Common_daisy","Sunflower","Rubber_rabbitbrush"]}
