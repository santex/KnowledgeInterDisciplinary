{"cursor":"6967","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Palladium hydride' is metallic palladium that contains a substantial quantity\nof hydrogen within its crystal lattice. Despite its name, it is not an ionic\nhydride but rather an alloy of palladium with metallic hydrogen. At room\ntemperature, palladium hydrides may contain two crystalline phases, Î± and Î²\n(sometimes called Î±'). Pure Î± phase exists at x  0.58; intermediate x values correspond to Î±-Î² mixtures. [http://www.msm.cam.ac.uk/mmc/people/jw476/pdh.html Phase diagram for\nPalladium-Hydrogen System]\n\nHydrogen absorption by palladium is reversible and therefore has been\ninvestigated for hydrogen storage. Palladium\nelectrodes have been used in some cold fusion experiments, under the hypothesis\nthat the hydrogen could be \"squeezed\" between the palladium atoms to help them\nfuse at lower temperatures than would otherwise be required. A great number of\nresearch labs in the United States, Italy, Japan, Israel, Korea, China and\nelsewhere claim to have observed cold fusion in palladium deuteride (heavy\nhydrogen version of palladium hydride).\n","linknr":169,"url":"Palladium_hydride","recorded":1362374918,"links":17,"instances":["chemist"],"pdf":["http://www.heraphysics.it/PhysC388p571.pdf","http://www.heraphysics.it/PhysC388p571.pdf","http://144.206.159.178/FT/537/584536/12434643.pdf","http://144.206.159.178/FT/537/584536/12434643.pdf","http://www.platinummetalsreview.com/pdf/pmr-v27-i4-157-169.pdf"],"categories":["Palladium compounds","Metal hydrides","Inorganic compounds"],"headings":["History","Chemical structure and properties","Uses of palladium hydride","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["thomas_graham","chemist"]],"members":["thomas_graham"],"related":["Palladium","Hydrogen","Crystal_lattice","Hydride","Alloy","Metallic_hydrogen","Hydrogen_storage","Cold_fusion","Thomas_Graham_(chemist)","Close-packing","Angstrom","Neutron_diffraction","Octahedron","Scanning_tunnelling_microscopy","Hydrogen_atom","Deuterium","Hydrogen_sensor"]}
