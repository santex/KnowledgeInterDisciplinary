      "text" : "\n\n\n'Political economy' was the original term used for studying production, buying,\nand selling, and their relations with law, custom, and government, as well as\nwith the distribution of national income and wealth. Political economy\noriginated in moral philosophy. It was developed in the 18th century as the\nstudy of the economies of states, or [[Polity|polities]], hence the term\npolitical economy.\n\nIn the late 19th century, the term [[economics]] came to replace political\neconomy, coinciding with publication of an influential textbook by Alfred\nMarshall in 1890.<ref>Marshall, Alfred. (1890) [[Principles of Economics\n(Marshall)|Principles of Economics]].</ref> Earlier, William Stanley Jevons, a\nproponent of mathematical methods applied to the subject, advocated economics\nfor brevity and with the hope of the term becoming \"the recognised name of a\nscience.\"<ref>Jevons, W. Stanley. The Theory of Political Economy, 1879, 2nd ed.\n[http://books.google.com/books?id=aYcBAAAAQAAJ&printsec=find&pg=PR14=onepage&q&-\nf=false#v=onepage&q&f=false p. xiv.]</ref><ref name=\"Groenwegen\">Groenwegen,\nPeter. (1987 [2008]). \"'political economy' and 'economics'\", [[The New Palgrave:\nA Dictionary of Economics]], v. 3, pp. 905-06. [Pp.&nbsp;904–07.]</ref>\n\nToday, political economy, where it is not used as a synonym for economics, may\nrefer to very different things, including Marxian analysis, applied public-\nchoice approaches emanating from the Chicago school and the Virginia school, or\nsimply the advice given by economists to the government or public on general\neconomic policy or on specific proposals.<ref name=\"Groenwegen\"/> A rapidly\ngrowing mainstream literature from the 1970s has expanded beyond the model of\neconomic policy in which planners maximize utility of a representative\nindividual toward examining how political forces affect the choice of economic\npolicies, especially as to distributional conflicts and political\ninstitutions.<ref name=\"Alesina\">Alesina, Alberto F.
