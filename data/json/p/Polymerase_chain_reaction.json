{"cursor":"44891","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nThe 'polymerase chain reaction' ('PCR') is a biochemical technology in molecular\nbiology to amplify a single or a few copies of a piece of DNA across several\norders of magnitude, generating thousands to millions of copies of a particular\nDNA sequence.\n\nDeveloped in 1983 by Kary Mullis, PCR is\nnow a common and often indispensable technique used in medical and biological\nresearch labs for a variety of applications. These include DNA cloning for sequencing, DNA-based\nphylogeny, or functional analysis of genes; the diagnosis of hereditary\ndiseases; the identification of genetic fingerprints (used in forensic sciences\nand paternity testing); and the detection and diagnosis of infectious diseases.\nIn 1993, Mullis was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry along with Michael\nSmith for his work on PCR. [http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1993/mullis-\nlecture.html Kary Mullis Nobel Lecture, December 8, 1993]\n\nThe method relies on thermal cycling, consisting of cycles of repeated heating\nand cooling of the reaction for DNA melting and enzymatic replication of the\nDNA. Primers (short DNA fragments) containing sequences complementary to the\ntarget region along with a DNA polymerase (after which the method is named) are\nkey components to enable selective and repeated amplification. As PCR\nprogresses, the DNA generated is itself used as a template for replication,\nsetting in motion a chain reaction in which the DNA template is exponentially\namplified. PCR can be extensively modified to perform a wide array of genetic\nmanipulations.\n\nAlmost all PCR applications employ a heat-stable DNA polymerase, such as Taq\npolymerase, an enzyme originally isolated from the bacterium [[Thermus\naquaticus]]. This DNA polymerase enzymatically assembles a new DNA strand from\nDNA building-blocks, the nucleotides, by using single-stranded DNA as a template\nand DNA oligonucleotides (also called DNA primers), which are required for\ninitiation of DNA synthesis. The vast majority of PCR methods use thermal\ncycling, i.e., alternately heating and cooling the PCR sample to a defined\nseries of temperature steps. These thermal cycling steps are necessary first to\nphysically separate the two strands in a DNA double helix at a high temperature\nin a process called DNA melting. At a lower temperature, each strand is then\nused as the template in DNA synthesis by the DNA polymerase to selectively\namplify the target DNA. The selectivity of PCR results from the use of primers\nthat are complementary to the DNA region targeted for amplification under\nspecific thermal cycling conditions.\n","linknr":691,"url":"Polymerase_chain_reaction","recorded":1362580698,"links":78,"instances":["molecular_biology","molecular_biology","molecular_biology","biology","chemist","united_states"],"pdf":["http://www.lab-rech-associatives.com/pdf/Utiliser%20la%20Topologie%20de%20l'ADN.pdf","http://www.lab-rech-associatives.com/pdf/Utiliser%20la%20Topologie%20de%20l'ADN.pdf"],"categories":["Molecular
