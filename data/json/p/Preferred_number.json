{"cursor":"19861","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nIn industrial design, 'preferred numbers' (also called 'preferred values') are\nstandard guidelines for choosing exact product dimensions within a given set of\nconstraints. Product developers must choose numerous lengths, distances,\ndiameters, volumes, and other characteristic quantities. While all of these\nchoices are constrained by considerations of functionality, usability,\ncompatibility, safety or cost, there usually remains considerable leeway in the\nexact choice for many dimensions.\n\nPreferred numbers serve two purposes:\n# Using them increases the probability of compatibility between objects designed\n# at different times by different people. In other words, it is one tactic among\n# many in standardization, whether within a company or within an industry, and\n# it is usually desirable in industrial contexts. (The opposite motive can also\n# apply, if it is in a manufacturer's financial interest: for example,\n# manufacturers of consumer products often have a financial interest in lack of\n# compatibility, in planned obsolescence, and in selling name-brand and model-\n# specific replacement parts.) They are chosen such that when a product is\n# manufactured in many different sizes, these will end up roughly equally spaced\n# on a logarithmic scale. They therefore help to minimize the number of\n# different sizes that need to be manufactured or kept in stock.\n","linknr":547,"url":"Preferred_number","recorded":1362567389,"links":32,"instances":["concert_a","log_scale","electrical","currency"],"pdf":["http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/site/en/consleg/1975/L/01975L0106-20040501-en.pdf","http://europa.eu/eur-lex/en/consleg/pdf/1975/en_1975L0106_do_001.pdf"],"categories":["Numbers","Industrial design","Logarithmic scales of measurement"],"headings":["{{anchor|ISO 3|R5 series|R10 series|R20 series|R40 series|R80 series}} Renard numbers","Rail gauges","1-2-5 series","{{anchor|IEC 60063}} E series","Buildings","Paper documents, envelopes, and drawing pens","Computer engineering","Retail packaging","Music","Photography","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/0/2/f0241a5bda9c883a7952bdc1e0409390.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/E12-reeks.png/150px-E12-reeks.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/E12_values_graph.svg/250px-E12_values_graph.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/Preferred_values_05_Pengo.svg/250px-Preferred_values_05_Pengo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/9/0/890bf0639fecb2a2572f2f236da5f41f.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["decade","log_scale"],["denomination","currency"],["fuse","electrical"],["a440","concert_a"],["pitch","music#history_of_pitch_standards_in_western_music"]],"members":["a440","decade","pitch","fuse","denomination"],"related":["Industrial_design","Quantities","Standardization","Planned_obsolescence","Logarithmic_scale","Charles_Renard","International_standard","ISO_3","Geometric_sequence","Relative_error","SI","Metre","Kilometre","Yard","Mile","Rail_gauge","Irish_gauge","Wengernalpbahn","Decade_(log_scale)","International_standard","Denomination_(currency)","Currencies","Canadian_quarter","United_States_quarter","Dutch_gulden","Aruban_florin","Netherlands_Antillean_gulden","Surinamese_dollar","Iraqi_dinar","Jordanian_dinar","Lebanese_pound","Syrian_pound","Seychellois_rupee","Resistors","Electronics","International_Electrotechnical_Commission","Resistor","Capacitor","Inductor","Zener_diodes","Fuse_(electrical)","IEC_60228","Mental_arithmetic","Decimetre","Metric_foot","International_Organization_for_Standardization","British_Standards","Paper_size","Square_root","Georg_Christoph_Lichtenberg","ISO_216","Computer_graphic","Raster_graphics","JPEG","MPEG","Aspect_ratio","Trombone","Theremin","Twelve-tone_equal_temperament","A440_(Concert_A)","Tuning_system","F-number","Film_speed","DX_encoding","Shutter_speed","ISO_3","International_Organization_for_Standardization","ISO_17","ISO_497","ISO_2848","ISO/TR_8389","IEC_60063","International_Electrotechnical_Commission","75/106/EEC","BS_2045","British_Standards_Institution","BS_2488","ANSI_Z17.1"]}
