The party existed from 1920 until 1958.\n\nGounaris developed the party from the Nationalist Party (Komma Ethnikofronon) in\nOctober 1920, after his return from exile in Corsica. Gounaris and his\nparliamentary candidates campaigned for withdrawal of the Greek Army from Asia\nMinor where it occupied as part of the Treaty of SevrÃ¨s in the aftermath of\nWorld War I. The party was triumphant in the 1920 Greek general election and\nformed successive governments under Gounaris, Nikolaos Stratos and Petros\nProtopapadakis.\n\nHowever, it failed to live up to its promise to bring the troops back home and\nbecame more entangled in Asia Minor than their Liberal Party predecessors. To\ncomplicate matters further, after the death of King Alexander on October 25,\n1920, it brought back exiled Constantine I which cost Greece the support of her\nformer Entente Allies. Defeat in the Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922) and the\nsubsequent Asia Minor disaster put an end to its rule as Greek military leaders\noverthrew the government they viewed as responsible for the national\ncatastrophe.\n\nIts leaders, including Dimitrios Gounaris, were executed after a short trial and\nthe party suffered great losses in the following elections. Nevertheless, it\nreturned to power, in 1933 under the leadership of Panagis Tsaldaris\nand in 1935 played a leading part in the restoration of monarchy with the return\nof King George II.\n\nAfter Panagis Tsaldaris's death in 1936, Konstantinos Tsaldaris led the party\nand in the legislative elections of 1946 it achieved a huge victory.\nThe party supported the restoration of George II in the plebiscite of 1946,\nduring a period of fierce civil conflict. Nevertheless, Konstantinos Tsaldaris\nresigned, in order that a government of national unity (centre-liberals and\nconservatives) could be formed under the leadership of the Liberal politician\nThemistoklis Sophoulis. This government with the participation of both the\nPeople's Party and the Liberal Party led the country during the civil war.\n\nThe People's party remained the dominant power of the right until 1950, but, in\n1951, the Greek Rally party of retired General Alexandros Papagos swept the\nelection and the People's Party was placed on the margin of Greek politics.\n\nThe party participated for the last time in Greek elections in 1958 and it was\nthen dissolved by its last leader, Konstantinos Tsaldaris. Its supporters had\nalready been absorbed by the National Radical Union of Constantine Karamanlis,\nthe successor of the Greek Rally.\n","linknr":141,"url":"People's_Party_(Greece)","recorded":1375082480,"links":["/w/index.php?title=People%27s_Party_(Greece)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=People%27s_Party_(Greece)&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=People%27s_Party_(Greece)&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Template:Citation_needed","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/Dimitrios_Gounaris","/wiki/Nationalist_Party_(Greece)","/wiki/National_Radical_Union","/wiki/List_of_political_ideologies","/wiki/Monarchism","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Conservatism","/wiki/Venizelism","/wiki/Liberalism","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Political_spectrum","/wiki/Right-wing_politics","/wiki/Politics_of_Greece","/wiki/List_of_political_parties_in_Greece","/wiki/Elections_in_Greece","/wiki/Greek_language","/wiki/Conservatism","/wiki/Greece","/wiki/Dimitrios_Gounaris","/wiki/Eleftherios_Venizelos","/wiki/Liberal_Party_(Greece)","/wiki/Nationalist_Party_(Greece)","/wiki/Corsica","/wiki/Asia_Minor","/wiki/Treaty_of_Sevr%C3%A8s","/wiki/World_War_I","/wiki/Greek_legislative_election,_1920","/wiki/Nikolaos_Stratos","/wiki/Petros_Protopapadakis","/wiki/Alexander_of_Greece","/wiki/Constantine_I_of_Greece","/wiki/Greco-Turkish_War_(1919-1922)","/wiki/Dimitrios_Gounaris","/wiki/Panagis_Tsaldaris","#cite_note-3","/wiki/George_II_of_Greece","/wiki/Panagis_Tsaldaris","/wiki/Konstantinos_Tsaldaris","/wiki/Greek_legislative_election,_1946","#cite_note-4","/wiki/George_II_of_Greece","/wiki/Greek_plebiscite,_1946","/wiki/Konstantinos_Tsaldaris","/wiki/Themistoklis_Sophoulis","/wiki/Liberal_Party_(Greece)","/wiki/Greek_legislative_election,_1950","/wiki/Greek_legislative_election,_1951","/wiki/Greek_Rally","/wiki/Alexandros_Papagos","/wiki/Elections_in_Greece","/wiki/Greek_legislative_election,_1958","/wiki/Konstantinos_Tsaldaris","/wiki/National_Radical_Union","/wiki/Greek_Rally","/w/index.php?title=People%27s_Party_(Greece)&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","#cite_ref-2","#cite_ref-3","#cite_ref-4","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=People%27s_Party_(Greece)&oldid=560657690","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Political_parties_established_in_1920","/wiki/Category:Conservative_parties_in_Greece","/wiki/Category:1920_establishments_in_Greece","/wiki/Category:Monarchist_parties_in_Greece","/wiki/Category:Articles_needing_additional_references_from_June_2013","/wiki/Category:All_articles_needing_additional_references","/wiki/Category:Articles_containing_Greek-language_text","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=People%27s+Party+%28Greece%29&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=People%27s+Party+%28Greece%29","/wiki/People%27s_Party_(Greece)","/wiki/Talk:People%27s_Party_(Greece)","#","/wiki/People%27s_Party_(Greece)","/w/index.php?title=People%27s_Party_(Greece)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=People%27s_Party_(Greece)&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/People%27s_Party_(Greece)","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/People%27s_Party_(Greece)","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=People%27s_Party_(Greece)&oldid=560657690","/w/index.php?title=People%27s_Party_(Greece)&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q782419","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=People%27s_Party_%28Greece%29&id=560657690","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=People%27s+Party+%28Greece%29","/w/index.php?title=S
