An introductory essay written\nby a different person is a [[foreword]] and precedes an author's preface. The\npreface often closes with acknowledgements of those who assisted in the\nliterary work.\n\nA preface generally covers the story of how the book came into being, or\nhow the idea for the book was developed; this is often followed by thanks\nand acknowledgments to people who were helpful to the author during the\ntime of writing.\n\nA preface is usually signed (and the date and place of writing often follow the\ntypeset signature); a foreword by another person is always signed. Information\nessential to the main text is generally placed in a set of explanatory notes, or\nperhaps in an \"Introduction\" that may be paginated with Arabic numerals, rather\nthan in the preface. The term preface can also mean any preliminary or\nintroductory statement. It is sometimes abbreviated pref.\n\nPreface comes from the Latin, meaning either \"spoken before\" (prae + fatia) or\n\"made before\" (prae + factum). While the former source of the word could have\npreface meaning the same as prologue, the latter strongly implies an\nintroduction written before the body of the book. With this meaning of stated\nintention, British publishing up to at least the middle of the twentieth century\ndistinguished between preface and introduction.\n","title":"preface","headings":["Further reading"]},"micro-relation":["1: Adjectival_form","1: Book","1: Literature","1: Arabic_numerals"]}
