The\nterrain of western China is rugged and elevated, with the Himalaya, Karakoram,\nPamir and Tian Shan mountain ranges separating China from South and Central\nAsia. The Yangtze and Yellow Rivers, the third- and sixth-longest in the world,\nhave their sources in the Tibetan Plateau and continue to the densely populated\neastern seaboard. China's coastline along the Pacific Ocean is long and is\nbounded by the Bohai, Yellow, East and South China Seas.\n\nThe ancient Chinese civilization – one of the world's earliest – flourished in\nthe fertile basin of the Yellow River in the North China Plain. For millennia,\nChina's political system was based on hereditary monarchies, known as dynasties,\nbeginning with the semi-mythological Xia of the Yellow River basin (c. 2000\nBCE). Since 221 BCE, when the Qin Dynasty first conquered several states to form\na Chinese empire, the country has expanded, fractured and been reformed numerous\ntimes. The Republic of China overthrew the last dynasty in 1911, and ruled the\nChinese mainland until 1949. After the defeat of the Empire of Japan in World\nWar II, the Communist Party defeated the nationalist Kuomintang in mainland\nChina and established the People's Republic of China in Beijing on 1 October\n1949, while the Kuomintang relocated the ROC government to Taipei. The ROC's\njurisdiction is now limited to Taiwan and several outlying islands, including\nPenghu, Kinmen and Matsu, and it now receives limited diplomatic recognition.\n\nSince the introduction of economic reforms in 1978, China has become the world's\nfastest-growing major economy. As of 2013, it is the world's second-largest\neconomy by both nominal total GDP and purchasing power parity (PPP), and is also\nthe world's largest exporter and importer of goods.<ref\nname=ChinaBiggestTrader></ref> China is a recognized nuclear weapons state and\nhas the world's largest standing army, with the second-largest defense budget.\nThe PRC has been a United Nations member since 1971, when it replaced the ROC as\na permanent member of the U.N. Security Council. China is also a member of\nnumerous formal and informal multilateral organizations, including the WTO,\nAPEC, BRICS, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, the BCIM and the G-20.
