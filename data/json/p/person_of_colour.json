      "text" : "'Person of color' (plural: 'people of color'; 'persons of color') is a term used\nprimarily in the United States to describe any person who is not white. The term\nis meant to be inclusive among non-white groups, emphasizing common experiences\nof racism. People of color was introduced as a preferable replacement to both\nnon-white and [[minority group|minority]], which are also inclusive, because it\nframes the subject positively; non-white defines people in terms of what they\nare not (white), and minority frequently carries a subordinate\nconnotation.<ref></ref> Style guides for writing from American\nHeritage,<ref></ref> the Stanford Graduate School of Business,<ref></ref> Mount\nHolyoke College,<ref></ref> recommend the term over these alternatives. It may\nalso be used with other collective categories of people such as students of\ncolor, men of color and women of color. People of Color typically refer to\npeople of African, Asian, Hispanic and/or Latino, and Native American heritage.\nIt may also be used to refer to mixed-race people.\n\nThe untranslated English term has also seen some limited usage among Germans of\ncolor, especially when stressing the postcolonial perspective,<ref>Kien Nghi Ha,\nNicola Lauré al-Samarai, Sheila Mysorekar (Hg.)
