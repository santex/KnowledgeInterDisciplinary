{"cursor":"1869","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nThe 'phyllosphere' is a term used in microbiology to refer to leaf surfaces or\ntotal above-ground surfaces of a plant as a habitat for microorganisms. The below-\nground microbial habitats (i.e. the thin-volume of soil surrounding root or\nsubterranean stem surfaces) are referred to as the rhizosphere and laimosphere,\nrespectively. All plants are host to a numerous and diverse community of\nmicroorganisms including bacteria, fungi, and yeasts. Some are beneficial to the\nplant, others function as plant pathogens and may damage the host plant or even\nkill it. However, the majority of bacterial colonists on any given plant have no\ndetectable effect on plant growth or function.\n\nResearch into the characteristics of microbial life in the phyllosphere is of\ngreat commercial importance to the agricultural industry for two reasons. First,\nunderstanding the survival of plant disease-causing bacteria and fungi is vital\nfor developing new ways to control their spread. Second, there has been a recent\nrise in the number of food poisoning cases associated with fruit and vegetables\ncontaminated with bacteria, such as [[Salmonella]] and [[E. coli O157:H7]]. This\nis particularly true of fresh fruits and salads which are not cooked prior to\nconsumption. Preventing these outbreaks by developing better decontamination\nstrategies is important to protect public health.\n","linknr":93,"url":"Phyllosphere","recorded":1362505712,"links":13,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Microbiology terms","Botany"],"headings":["External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Microbiology","Microorganisms","Rhizosphere","Laimosphere","Bacteria","Fungi","Yeasts","Plant_pathogen"]}
