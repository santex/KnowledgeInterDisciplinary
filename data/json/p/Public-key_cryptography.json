The shared secret can be used, for instance, as\nthe key for a symmetric cipher.]]\n\n'Public-key cryptography' refers to a cryptographic system requiring two\nseparate keys, one of which is secret and one of which is public. Although\ndifferent, the two parts of the key pair are mathematically linked. One key\nlocks or encrypts the plaintext, and the other unlocks or decrypts the\nciphertext. Neither key can perform both functions by itself. The public key may\nbe published without compromising security, while the private key must not be\nrevealed to anyone not authorized to read the messages.\n\nPublic-key cryptography uses asymmetric key algorithms and can also be referred\nto by the more generic term \"asymmetric key cryptography.\" The algorithms used\nfor public key cryptography are based on mathematical relationships (the most\nnotable ones being the integer factorization and discrete logarithm problems)\nthat presumably have no efficient solution. Although it is computationally easy\nfor the intended recipient to generate the public and private keys, to decrypt\nthe message using the private key, and easy for the sender to encrypt the\nmessage using the public key, it is extremely difficult (or effectively\nimpossible) for anyone to derive the private key, based only on their knowledge\nof the public key. This is why, unlike symmetric key algorithms, a public key\nalgorithm does not require a secure initial exchange of one (or more) secret\nkeys between the sender and receiver. The use of these algorithms also allows\nthe authenticity of a message to be checked by creating a digital signature of\nthe message using the private key, which can then be verified by using the\npublic key. In practice, only a hash of the message is typically encrypted for\nsignature verification purposes.\n\nPublic-key cryptography is widely used. It is an approach used by many\ncryptographic algorithms and cryptosystems. It underpins such Internet standards\nas Transport Layer Security (TLS), PGP, and GPG. There are three primary kinds\nof public key systems: public key distribution systems, digital signature\nsystems, and public key cryptosystems, which can perform both public key\ndistribution and digital signature services. DiffieâHellman key exchange is the\nmost widely used public key distribution system, while the Digital Signature\nAlgorithm is the most widely used digital signature system.\n","linknr":448,"url":"Public-key_cryptography","recorded":1362554373,"links":53,"instances":["cryptography","device","algorithm","protocol","cryptography","cryptography"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Public-key
