In Classical\nantiquity, the Presocratic philosophers were called 'physiologoi' (in English,\nphysical or natural philosophers). William Keith Chambers Guthrie, The\nPresocratic Tradition from Parmenides to Democritus, p. 13, ISBN 0-317-66577-\n4. Diogenes LaÃ«rtius divides the physiologoi into two groups, Ionian and\nItaliote, led by Anaximander and Pythagoras, respectively. Franco Orsucci,\nChanging Mind: Transitions in Natural and Artificial Environments, p. 14, ISBN\n981-238-027-2.\n\nHermann Diels popularized the term pre-socratic in Die Fragmente der\nVorsokratiker (The Fragments of the Pre-Socratics) in 1903. However, the term\npre-Sokratic was in use as early as George Grote's Plato and the Other\nCompanions of Sokrates in 1865. Major analyses of pre-Socratic thought have been\nmade by Gregory Vlastos, Jonathan Barnes, and Friedrich Nietzsche in his\n[[Philosophy in the Tragic Age of the Greeks]].\n\nIt may sometimes be difficult to determine the actual line of argument some\nPresocratics used in supporting their particular views. While most of them\nproduced significant texts, none of the texts has survived in complete form. All\nthat is available are quotations by later philosophers (often biased) and\nhistorians, and the occasional textual fragment.\n\nThe Presocratic philosophers rejected traditional mythological explanations of\nthe phenomena they saw around them in favor of more rational explanations. These\nphilosophers asked questions about \"the essence of things\": Eduard Feller,\nOutlines of the History of Greek Philosophy (1955). p. 323.\n\n*From where does everything come? *From what is everything created? *How do we\nexplain the plurality of things found in nature? *How might we describe nature\nmathematically?\n\nOthers concentrated on defining problems and paradoxes that became the basis for\nlater mathematical, scientific and philosophic study.\n\nLater philosophers rejected many of the answers the early Greek philosophers\nprovided, but continued to place importance on their questions. Furthermore, the\ncosmologies proposed by them have been updated by later developments in science.\n","linknr":653,"url":"Pre-Socratics","recorded":1362582417,"links":62,"instances":["classicist","classicist"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Presocratic philosophy|*","History of philosophy","Natural philosophy","History of science","History of ideas"],"headings":["History","Other early Greek thinkers","Legacy","Editions","References","External links","Notes"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d1/Sanzio_01_cropped.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Presocratic_graph.svg/500px-Presocratic_graph.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["john_burnet","classicist"],["kathleen_freeman","classicist"]],"members":["john_burnet","kathleen_freeman"],"related":["Greek_philosophy","Socrates","Classical_antiquity","Natural_philosopher","W._K._C._Guthrie","Diogenes_Laërtius","Ionians","Italiotes","Anaximander","Pythagoras","Hermann_Diels","George_Grote","Gregory_Vlastos","Jonathan_Barnes","Friedrich_Nietzsche","Phenomenon","Cosmology","Science","Intellectual","Myth","Aristotle","Plutarch","Diogenes_Laërtius","Stobaeus","Simplicius_of_Cilicia","Clement_of_Alexandria","Hippolytus_of_Rome","Miletus","Thales","Anaximander","Anaximenes_of_Miletus","Pythagoras","Italy","Philolaus","Alcmaeon_of_Croton","Archytas","Heraclitus","Classical_element","Xenophanes","Parmenides","Zeno_of_Elea","Melissus","Empedocles","Classical_elements","Anaxagoras","Leucippus","Democritus","Diogenes_of_Apollonia","Milesian_school","Protagoras","Gorgias","Hippias","Prodicus","Seven_Sages_of_Greece","Philosophy","Seven_Sages_of_Greece","Solon","Chilon_of_Sparta","Thales","Bias_of_Priene","Cleobulus_of_Rhodes","Pittacus_of_Mitylene","Periander","Aristeas","Proconnesus","Pherecydes_of_Syros","Anacharsis","Karl_Marx","Nietzsche","Human,_All_Too_Human","Karl_Popper","John_Burnet_(classicist)","Giorgio_Colli","G._E._R._Lloyd","Geoffrey_Kirk","John_Raven","Cambridge_University_Press","Hermann_Diels","Walther_Kranz","Kathleen_Freeman_(classicist)"]}
