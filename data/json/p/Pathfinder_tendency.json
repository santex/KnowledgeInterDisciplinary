The current is also known as the International\nCommunist League, although this term is not widely used, and can cause confusion\nwith other organizations of the same name. The Communist Leagues, even those in\nnon-English speaking countries, sell the publication of the SWP, [[The\nMilitant]].\n","linknr":122,"url":"Pathfinder_tendency","recorded":1362675198,"links":14,"instances":["canada","sweden","usa"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Trotskyist political internationals","Book publishing companies of the United States","Political book publishing companies"],"headings":["History","International manifestations","See also","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/72/Pathlogo.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["socialist_workers_party","united_states"],["fourth_international","post-reunification"],["revolutionary_workers_league","canada"],["communist_league","australia"],["communist_league","uk,_1988"],["communist_league","canada"],["communist_league","iceland"],["communist_league","new_zealand"],["communist_league","sweden"],["socialist_workers_party","usa"]],"members":["revolutionary_workers_league","communist_league","socialist_workers_party","fourth_international"],"related":["Trotskyist","Socialist_Workers_Party_(United_States)","Cuban_Revolution","Cuban_Communist_Party","Fourth_International_(Post-Reunification)","Trotskyism","Permanent_Revolution","Cuban_Communist_Party","Frente_Sandinista_de_Liberaci√≥n_Nacional","Revolutionary_Workers_League_(Canada)","Socialist_Action_League","World_Federation_of_Democratic_Youth","Communist_League_(Australia)","Communist_League_(UK,_1988)","Communist_League_(Canada)","Communist_League_(Iceland)","Communist_League_(New_Zealand)","Communist_League_(Sweden)","Socialist_Workers_Party_(USA)","Pathfinder_Mural"]}
