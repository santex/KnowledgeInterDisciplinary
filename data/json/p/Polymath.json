In less formal terms, a\n polymath (or polymathic person) may simply be someone who is very\n knowledgeable. Most ancient scientists were polymaths by today's\n standards. The term was first used in the seventeenth century but\n the related term, polyhistor, is an ancient term with similar meaning.\n\nThe common term Renaissance man has been used historically to describe polymaths\nor persons who aspired to be polymaths. [http://encarta.msn.com/encnet/feat-\nures/dictionary/DictionaryResults.aspx?refid=1861738117 Encarta\ndictionary]. The concept emerged from the numerous great thinkers of that\nera who excelled in multiple fields of the arts and science, including Leonardo\nda Vinci, Michelangelo, Galileo Galilei, Nicolaus Copernicus and Michael\nServetus [http://michaelservetusresearch.com/ENGLISH/index.html Michael\nServetus Research] Website on the anatomical, pharmacological, theological,\ngrammatical, poetical, cartographical, astronomical and translational works by\nMichael Servetus. . The emergence of these thinkers was attributed to the\nthen rising notion in Renaissance Italy expressed by one of its most\naccomplished representatives, Leon Battista Alberti (1404â1472): that \"a man can\ndo all things if he will\". [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/497891/Renaissance-\nman] His concept embodied the basic tenets of Renaissance humanism, which\nconsidered humans empowered and limitless in their capacities for development,\nand it led to the notion that people should embrace all knowledge and develop\ntheir capacities as fully as possible. The term applies to the gifted people of\nthe Renaissance who sought to develop skills in all areas of knowledge, in\nphysical development, in social accomplishments, and in the arts, in contrast to\nthe vast majority of people of that age, who were not well educated. This\ntemporarily limited term entered the lexicon during the twentieth century and\nhas been applied to great thinkers living before and after the Renaissance such\nas Aristotle, Avicenna, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Benjamin Franklin and Isaac\nNewton. Terms such as polyhistor, polymath or even universal genius are\nsometimes employed as synonyms to the term.\n","linknr":314,"url":"Polymath","recorded":1362508901,"links":60,"instances":["person","form_of_address","novel","ethics"],"pdf":["http://www.oup.co.uk/pdf/0-19-815248-5.pdf","http://www.oup.co.uk/pdf/0-19-815248-5.pdf"],"categories":["Giftedness","Age of Enlightenment","Renaissance","Thought"],"headings":["Related terms","Polymath and polyhistor compared","Notable polymaths","Other uses of \"polymath\"","See also","References and notes","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/Leonardo_da_Vinci_-_Self-Portrait_-_WGA12798.jpg/125px-Leonardo_da_Vinci_-_Self-Portrait_-_WGA12798.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Hildegard.jpg/125px-Hildegard.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/40/Shen_Kua.JPG/125px-Shen_Kua.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/Nuvola_apps_bookcase.svg/16px-Nuvola_apps_bookcase.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["ideal","ethics"],["master","form_of_address"],["flow","psychology#applications"],["polyglot","person"],["polymath","novel"]],"members":["polyglot","master","flow","polymath","ideal"],"related":["Leonardo_da_Vinci","Michelangelo","Galileo_Galilei","Nicolaus_Copernicus","Michael_Servetus","Renaissance_Italy","Leon_Battista_Alberti","Renaissance_humanism","Gifted","Aristotle","Avicenna","Johann_Wolfgang_von_Goethe","Benjamin_Franklin","Isaac_Newton","Latin_language","Italian_language","Renaissance","Jack_of_all_trades","Jack_of_all_trades,_master_of_none","Amateur","Leonardo_da_Vinci","Genius","Renaissance","Education","Humanism","Gentleman","Courtier","Language","Musical_instrument","Poetry","Ideal_(ethics)","University","Science","Philosophy","Theology","Master_(form_of_address)","Carpenter","Baldassare_Castiglione","Sprezzatura","China","Confucius","Leon_Battista_Alberti","Islamic_Golden_Age","Dictionary","Synonym","Thomas_Moore","Project_Gutenberg","Alexander_Polyhistor","Etymological","Greek_language","Inquiry","Narrative","Erudition","Proto-Indo-European_language","Heuristics","Song_Dynasty","Benjamin_Howard_Baker","Maxwell_Woosnam","Rolf_Harris","Competent_man","List_of_people_who_have_been_called_a_\"polymath\"","Opsimath","Philomath","Polyglot_(person)","Polymath_(novel)","Polymatheia","Greek_mythology"]}
