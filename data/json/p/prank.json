Practical jokes differ from confidence tricks or\nhoaxes in that the victim finds out, or is let in on the joke, rather than being\nfooled into handing over money or other valuables. Practical jokes or pranks are\ngenerally lighthearted, reversible and non-permanent, and aim to make the victim\nfeel foolish or victimised to a degree, but may also involve cruelty verging on\nbullying if performed without appropriate finesse.\n\nThe term \"practical\" refers to the fact that the joke consists of someone doing\nsomething physical, instead of a verbal or written joke. For example, the joker\nwho is setting up and performing the practical joke might hang a bucket of water\nabove a doorway and rig the bucket using pulleys so when the door opens the\nbucket dumps the water. The joker would then wait for the victim to walk through\nthe doorway and be drenched by the bucket of water. Objects can also be used in\npractical jokes, like fake vomit, chewing gum bugs, exploding cigars, stink\nbombs, costumes and whoopee cushions. In Western culture, April Fools' Day<ref\nname=EconJape></ref> is a day traditionally dedicated to performing practical\njokes. A person who performs a practical joke is called a practical joker.<ref\nname=\"dictionary.reference.com\"/> The most common cases of practical jokes are\nencountered inside offices, usually to surprise co-workers. Covering the\ncomputer accessories with Jell-O, wrapping the desk with Christmas paper or\naluminium foil or filling it with balloons are just some examples of office\npranks.<ref></ref>\n","title":"Practical%20joke","headings":["Famous practical jokes","Criticism","Books","Movies","Radio","Television","People","Fictional characters","See also","References"]},"micro-relation":["2: Practical_joke_device","2: H._Allen_Smith","2: Merry_Pranksters","2: Yippies","2: The_Yes_Men","2: SS","1: MIT","1: Confidence_trick","1: Hoax","1: Cruelty","1: Bullying","1: Door","1: Fake_vomit","1: Chewing_gum_bug","1: Exploding_cigar","1: Stink_bomb","1: Costume","1: Whoopee_cushion","1: April_Fools'_Day","1: Playwright","1: Charles_MacArthur","1: Bohemianism","1: Waldo_Peirce","1: Paris","1: Turtle","1: Concierge","1: Roald_Dahl","1: University_of_British_Columbia","1: Cambridge_University","1: Austin_7","1: Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology","1: Hacks_at_the_Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology","1: Peter_Funk","1: Justin_Geste","1: Tim_Nyberg","1: Zug.com","1: V._Vale","1: Peter_Van_Der_Linden","1: Loiter_Squad","1: Alan_Abel","1: Theo_Angelopoulos","1: Ken_Babbs","1: Jeremy_Beadle","1: Jello_Biafra","1: Cyrus_Broacha","1: George_Clooney","1: Sacha_Baron_Cohen","1: Dimebag_Darrell","1: Rio_Ferdinand","1: Richard_Feynman","1: Nobel_prize","1: Allen_Funt","1: Rémi_Gaillard","1: George_Gamow","1: Mel_Gibson#Prankster","1: Eddie_Gossling","1: Tom_Green","1: Owen_Hart","1: Curt_Hennig","1: Abbie_Hoffman","1: Andy_Kaufman","1: Kip_Kay","1: Ken_Kesey","1: Jimmy_Kimmel","1: Ashton_Kutcher","1: Punk'd","1: Tom_Mabe","1: Monochrom","1: Odd_Future","1: Keith_Moon","1: Publicity_stunt","1: Camille_Paglia","1: Janoskians","1: Stunts","1: Sean_Penn","1: Penn_&_Teller","1: Jon_Richardson","1: Darren_Simpson","1: Joey_Skaggs","1: Culture_jammer","1: Vivian_Stanshall","1: Bonzo_Dog_Doo-Dah_Band","1: Carl_Switzer","1: Hugh_Troy","1: Cornell","1: Dick_Tuck","1: Richard_Nixon","1: Darryl_F._Zanuck","1: Anton_LaVey","1: Al_Bundy","1: Alex_Russo","1: What's_with_Andy?","1: BJ_Hunnicutt","1: CBS","1: Sitcom","1: Bart_Simpson","1: Characters_of_Watchmen#The_Comedian","1: David_Brent","1: Dean_Winchester","1: Emil_i_Lönneberga","1: Astrid_Lindgren","1: Hawkeye_Pierce","1: Jim_Halpert","1: The_Joker","1: DC_Comics","1: List_of_The_Smurfs_characters","1: Naruto_Uzumaki","1: Masashi_Kishimoto","1: Megan_Parker","1: Drake_and_Josh","1: Pinkie_Pie","1: Sheldon_Cooper","1: Tim_Canterbury","1: Trapper_John_McIntyre","1: Valentina_La_Paz#Valentina_La_Paz","1: Dumbledore's_Army#Fred_and_George_Weasley","1: Hermann_Fegelein","1: Obergruppenführer","1: Thomas_Kretschmann","1: Heinrich_Himmler","1: Reichsführer","1: Ulrich_Noethen","1: Felicity_Merriman","1: Dreadnought_hoax","1: Gag_name","1: List_of_practical_joke_topics","1: Pieing","1: Pranknet","1: Prank_call","1: School_prank","1: Senior_prank","1: Snipe_hunt","1: Student_prank"]}
