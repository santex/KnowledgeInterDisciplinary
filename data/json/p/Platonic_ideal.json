See W D Ross, Plato's Theory of\nIdeas (1951) and [http://www.philosophyprofessor.com/philosophies/platos-theory-of-\nforms.php this] reference site. The name of this aspect of Plato's thought is not\nmodern and has not been extracted from certain dialogues by modern scholars. The\nterm was used at least as early as Diogenes Laertius, who called it (Plato's)\n\"Theory of Forms:\" ...., Plato uses many different words for what is\ntraditionally called form in English translations and idea in German and Latin\ntranslations (Cicero). These include idÃ©a, morphÄ, eÃ®dos, and parÃ¡deigma, but\nalso gÃ©nos, phÃ½sis, and [[Ousia|ousÃ­a]]. He also uses expressions such as to x\nauto, \"the x itself\" or kath' auto \"in itself\". See Christian SchÃ¤fer:\nIdee/Form/Gestalt/Wesen, in Platon-Lexikon, Darmstadt 2007, p. 157.\nasserts that non-material abstract (but substantial) forms (or ideas) , and not the material world of change known to us through sensation, possess\nthe highest and most fundamental kind of reality. Forms (usually given a\ncapital F) were properties or essences of things, treated as non-material\nabstract, but substantial, entities. They were eternal, changeless, supremely\nreal, and independent of ordinary objects that had their being and properties by\n'participating' in them. [http://www.philosophyprofessor.com/philosophies/platos-theory-of-\nforms.php Plato's theory of forms (or ideas)] When used in this sense, the\nword form is often capitalized. \"Chapter 28:\nForm\" of The Great Ideas: A Synopticon of Great Books of the Western World (Vol.\nII). Encyclopaedia Britannica (1952), p. 526â542. This source states that Form\nor Idea get capitalized according to this convention when they refer \"to that\nwhich is separate from the characteristics of material things and from the ideas\nin our mind.\" Plato speaks of these entities only through the characters\n(primarily Socrates) of his dialogues who sometimes suggest that these Forms are\nthe only true objects of study that can provide us with genuine knowledge; thus\neven apart from the very controversial status of the theory, Plato's own views\nare much in doubt. Plato spoke of Forms in formulating a possible\nsolution to the problem of universals.\n","linknr":482,"url":"Platonic_ideal","recorded":1362567821,"links":33,"instances":["knowledge","metaphysics","philosophy","dialogue","dialogue","metaphysics","lawgiver","metaphysics"],"pdf":["http://www.bloomu.edu/departments/philosophy/pages/content/hales/articlepdf/thirdman.pdf","http://www.bloomu.edu/departments/philosophy/pages/content/hales/articlepdf/thirdman.pdf","http://www.stanford.edu/group/dualist/vol4/pdfs/durham.pdf","http://www.stanford.edu/group/dualist/vol4/pdfs/durham.pdf"],"categories":["Platonism","Epistemological theories","Natural philosophy","Metaphysical theories","Form"],"headings":["Forms","Evidence of Forms","Criticisms of Platonic Forms","Dialogues that discuss Forms","See also","Notes","Bibliography","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/Plato-raphael.jpg/100px-Plato-raphael.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/12px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["matter","philosophy"],["parmenides","dialogue"],["type","metaphysics"],["property","metaphysics"],["universal","metaphysics"],["draco","lawgiver"],["intuition","knowledge"],["cratylus","dialogue"],["parmenides","dialogue"]],"members":["intuition","universal","matter","cratylus","parmenides","type","draco","property"],"related":["Plato","Diogenes_Laertius","Ousia","Allegory_of_the_cave","Platonic_realism","Problem_of_universals","Indo-European","Homer","Pre-Socratic_philosophy","Thales","Substance_theory","Hylomorphism","Greek_language","Latin","Matter_(philosophy)","The_problem_of_universals","Parmenides_(dialogue)","Plato","Allegory_of_the_cave","Archetype","Type_(metaphysics)","Property_(metaphysics)","Universal_(metaphysics)","Allegory_of_the_cave","Iris_Murdoch","Abstract_objects","American_Heritage_Dictionary","Draco_(lawgiver)","Solon","Asclepius","Intuition_(knowledge)","Aristotle","Heraclitus","Perfection","Cratylus_(dialogue)","Parmenides_(dialogue)","Third_man_argument","Aristotle","Infinite_regress","Representative_realism","Insight","Phaedo","Science","Aristophanes","Hylomorphism","Metempsychosis","Epistemology","Metaphor_of_the_sun","Allegory_of_the_cave","Law","The_Good","Truth","Justice","Third_man_argument","Actual_infinity","Dreamtime","Dunamis","Energeia","Entelechy","Hexis","Jungian_archetypes","Nominalism","Plotinus","Potential_infinity","Problem_of_universals"]}
