Historically,\n  protists were treated as a biological kingdom formally called the 'Protista',\n  and included mostly unicellular organisms that did not fit into the other\n  kingdoms. Molecular information has been used to redefine this group in modern\n  taxonomy as diverse and often distantly related phyla. The group of protists\n  is now considered to mean diverse phyla that are not closely related through\n  evolution and have different life cycles, trophic levels, modes of locomotion,\n  and cellular structures.\" Besides their relatively simple levels of organization, the protists\n  do not have much in common.\n  They are unicellular, or they are multicellular without specialized tissues,\n  and this simple cellular organization distinguishes the protists from other\n  eukaryotes, such as fungi, animals and plants.\n\nThe term protista was first used by Ernst Haeckel in 1866. Protists were\ntraditionally subdivided into several groups based on similarities to the\n\"higher\" kingdoms: the unicellular \"animal-like\" protozoa, the \"plant-like\"\nprotophyta (mostly unicellular algae), and the \"fungus-like\" slime molds and\nwater molds. These traditional subdivisions, largely based on superficial\ncommonalities, have been replaced by classifications based on phylogenetics\n(evolutionary relatedness among organisms). However, the older terms are\nstill used as informal names to describe the morphology and ecology of\nvarious protists.\n\nProtists live in almost any environment that contains liquid water. Many\nprotists, such as the algae, are photosynthetic and are vital primary producers\nin ecosystems, particularly in the ocean as part of the plankton. Other\nprotists, such as the Kinetoplastids and Apicomplexa, are responsible for a\nrange of serious human diseases, such as malaria and sleeping sickness.\n","linknr":557,"url":"Protists","recorded":1362509316,"links":105,"instances":["biologist","biology","biology","epidemiology","biology"],"pdf":["http://www.im.microbios.org/08december99/03%20Scamardella.pdf","http://www.im.microbios.org/08december99/03%20Scamardella.pdf","http://www.springerlink.com/index/LW54T61737212643.pdf","http://www.springerlink.com/index/LW54T61737212643.pdf","http://www.cladocera.de/protozoa/stechmann_2003_cb.pdf","http://www.cladocera.de/protozoa/stechmann_2003_cb.pdf"],"categories":["Eukaryotes","Protista|"],"headings":["Classification","Metabolism","Reproduction","Role as pathogens","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/Padlock-silver.svg/20px-Padlock-silver.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/24/Protist_collage.jpg/250px-Protist_collage.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Wikispecies-logo.svg/34px-Wikispecies-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["kingdom","biology"],["tissue","biology"],["morphology","biology"],["john_hogg","biologist"],["vector","epidemiology"]],"members":["john_hogg","kingdom","tissue","vector","morphology"],"related":["Neoproterozoic","Ernst_Haeckel","Heterokont","Haptophyte","Cryptomonad","Dinoflagellate","Apicomplexa","Ciliate","Euglenozoa","Percolozoa","Metamonad","Radiolaria","Foraminifera","Cercozoa","Red_alga","Glaucophyta","Amoebozoa","Choanozoa","Fungi","Plantae","Animalia","Eukaryote","Microorganism","Kingdom_(biology)","Unicellular_organism","Organism","Taxonomy","Phylum","Biological_life_cycle","Trophic","Motility","Multicellular_organism","Tissue_(biology)","Fungi","Animal","Plant","Ernst_Haeckel","Protozoa","Protophyta","Algae","Slime_mold","Water_mold","Biological_classification","Phylogenetics","Evolution","Morphology_(biology)","Ecology","Algae","Photosynthesis","Primary_producer","Plankton","Kinetoplastid","Apicomplexa","Malaria","African_trypanosomiasis","Georg_August_Goldfuss","Ciliate","Coral","Foraminifera","Amoebae","John_Hogg_(biologist)","Ernst_Haeckel","Herbert_Copeland","Bacteria","Nucleated","Eukaryote","Diatom","Green_algae","Fungi","Fungi","Animalia","Plantae","Prokaryote","Monera","Molecular_phylogenetic","Clade","Heterotroph","Monophyly","Ultrastructure","Biochemistry","Genetics","Paraphyletic","Excavate","Chromalveolate","Haptophyte","Cryptomonad","Flagellates","Filter_feeding","Cell_membrane","Vacuole","Endocytosis","Phagocytosis","Pinocytosis","Phototroph","Algae","Dinoflagellate","Euglena","Organotroph","Apicomplexa","Trypanosomes","Amoeboid","Sexual_reproduction","Asexual_reproduction","Animals","Plants","Malaria","Late_blight","Agricultural_Research_Service","Argentina","Phoridae","Vector_(epidemiology)","Protistology"]}
