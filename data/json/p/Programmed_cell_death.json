For example,\nthe differentiation of fingers and toes in a developing human embryo occurs\nbecause cells between the fingers apoptose; the result is that the digits are\nseparate. PCD serves fundamental functions during both plant and metazoa\n(multicellular animals) tissue development. Apoptosis and autophagy are both\nforms of programmed cell death, however necrosis is a non-physiological process\nthat occurs as a result of infection or injury.\n\nNecrosis is the death of a cell caused by external factors such as trauma or\ninfection and occurs in several different forms, not a form of PCD as\npreviously stated.\n","linknr":698,"url":"Programmed_cell_death","recorded":1362483806,"links":28,"instances":["biology","physiology","cellular","biology","cell_biology","biology","journal","biology","journal","biology"],"pdf":["http://elfosscientiae.cigb.edu.cu/PDFs/BA/2006/23/1/BA002301RV001-010.pdf","http://elfosscientiae.cigb.edu.cu/PDFs/BA/2006/23/1/BA002301RV001-010.pdf"],"categories":["Programmed
