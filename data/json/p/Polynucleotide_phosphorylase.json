PDB 1e3p.\n}} 'Polynucleotide Phosphorylase' ('PNPase') is a bifunctional enzyme with a\nphosphorolytic 3' to 5' exoribonuclease activity and a 3'-terminal\noligonucleotide polymerase activity. It is\ninvolved on mRNA processing and degradation in bacteria, plants, and in humans.\n\nIn humans, the enzyme is encoded by the gene. In its active form, the protein\nforms a ring structure consisting of three PNPase molecules. Each PNPase\nmolecule consists of two RNase PH domains, an S1 RNA binding domain and a K-\nhomology domain. The protein is present in bacteria and in the chloroplasts and mitochondria of some\neukaryotic cells. In eukaryotes and archaea, a structurally and evolutionary\nrelated complex exists, called the ''exosome''.\n\nThe same abbreviation (PNPase) is also used for another, otherwise unrelated\nenzyme, Purine nucleoside phosphorylase.\n","linknr":435,"url":"Polynucleotide_phosphorylase","recorded":1362374395,"links":17,"instances":["animal_test"],"pdf":["http://www.landesbioscience.com/journals/cc/article/sarkarCC5-10.pdf","http://www.landesbioscience.com/journals/cc/article/sarkarCC5-10.pdf"],"categories":["Ribonucleases","EC 2.7.7","Genes mutated in mice"],"headings":["Model organisms","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/83/Crystal_structure_1E3P.jpg/220px-Crystal_structure_1E3P.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["open_field","animal_test"]],"members":["open_field"],"related":["Proteinâ€“protein_interaction","Enzyme","Phosphorolysis","Exoribonuclease","Oligonucleotide","Polymerase","MRNA_processing","RNase_PH","Protein_K","Bacteria","Chloroplasts","Mitochondria","Eukaryotic","Eukaryote","Archaea","Exosome_complex","Purine_nucleoside_phosphorylase","Homozygote","Recessive","Open_Field_(animal_test)","Hot_plate_test","Dysmorphology","Indirect_calorimetry","Glucose_tolerance_test","Auditory_brainstem_response","Dual-energy_X-ray_absorptiometry","Radiography","Clinical_chemistry","Blood_plasma","Immunoglobulin","Haematology","Peripheral_blood_lymphocyte","Micronucleus_test","Model_organism","Knockout_mouse","International_Knockout_Mouse_Consortium","Phenotypic_screen","Mutant","Homozygous","Mutant","Weaning","Heterozygous"]}
