{"cursor":"14702","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Photographic processing' is the chemical means by which photographic film and\npaper is treated after photographic exposure to produce a negative or positive\nimage. Photographic processing transforms the latent image into a visible image,\nmakes this permanent and renders it insensitive to light.\n\nAll processes based upon the gelatin-silver process are similar, regardless of\nthe film or paper's manufacturer. Exceptional variations include instant films\nsuch as Polaroid and thermally developed films. Kodachrome required Kodak's\nproprietary K-14 process. Kodachrome film production ceased in 2009, and K-14\nprocessing is no longer available as of December 30, 2010. Ilfochrome\nmaterials use the dye destruction process.\n","linknr":450,"url":"Photographic_development","recorded":1362477545,"links":33,"instances":["photography"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Science of photography","Photographic processes|"],"headings":["Common processes","Further processing","Processing apparatus","Environmental and safety issues","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e5/Light_trap_tank.jpg/200px-Light_trap_tank.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["fogging","photography"],["fogging","photography"]],"members":["fogging"],"related":["Photographic_film","Photographic_paper","Photographic_exposure","Image","Latent_image","Gelatin-silver","Polaroid_Corporation","Kodachrome","Kodak","K-14_process","Ilfochrome","Dye_destruction","Gelatin","Photographic_developer","Stop_bath","Acetic_acid","Citric_acid","Water","Photographic_fixer","Silver_halide","Hypo_clear","Non-ionic","Wetting_agent","Hard_water","Dodging_and_burning","Film_scanner","Fogging_(photography)","Chromogenic","Dye_couplers","C-41_process","RA-4_process","Halide","Kodachrome","E-6_process","Dye_couplers","Formaldehyde","Glutaraldehyde","Selenium","Sulfur","Aesthetics","Photographic_print_toning","Silver_selenide","Sepia_tone","Silver_sulphide","Oxidizing_agent","Hydrochloric_acid","Potassium_dichromate","Pastel","Camera","Developing_tank","Darkroom","Stand_development","Chemical_oxygen_demand","Biochemical_oxygen_demand","Ozone","Peroxide","Aeration","Thiosulfate","Silver_sulfide","EDTA","DTPA","Nitrilotriacetic_acid","Borate","Chelation","Surfactant","Potassium_ferricyanide","Cyanide","Potassium_dichromate","Hexavalent_chromium","Permanganate","Borate","Borax","Boric_acid","Hydroxylation","Benzene","Mutagen","Ascorbic_acid","List_of_photographic_processes","Fogging_(photography)","Darkroom","Cross_processing","British_Journal"]}
