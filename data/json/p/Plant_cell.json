Their distinctive features include:\n\n* A large central vacuole, a water-filled volume enclosed by a membrane known as\n  the [[tonoplast]] JA Raven (1997) The vacuole: a cost-benefit\n  analysis. Advances in Botanical Research 25, 59â86 RA Leigh and D Sanders (1997) Advances in Botanical\n  Research, Vol 25: The Plant Vacuole. Academic Press, California and London.\n  ISBN 0-12-441870-8 that maintains the cell's turgor, controls movement\n  of molecules between the cytosol and sap, stores useful material and digests\n  waste proteins and organelles.\n\n* A cell wall composed of cellulose and hemicellulose, pectin and in many cases\n  lignin, is secreted by the protoplast on the outside of the cell membrane.\n  This contrasts with the cell walls of fungi (which are made of chitin), and of\n  bacteria, which are made of peptidoglycan.\n\n* Specialized cell-to-cell communication pathways known as plasmodesmata, Oparka, KJ (1993) Signalling via plasmodesmata-the neglected\n  pathway. Seminars in Cell Biology 4, 131â138 pores in the primary cell\n  wall through which the plasmalemma and endoplasmic reticulum Hepler, PK (1982) Endoplasmic reticulum in the formation of the\n  cell plate and plasmodesmata. Protoplasma 111, 121â133 of adjacent cells\n  are continuous.\n\n* Plastids, the most notable being the chloroplast, which contains chlorophyll,\n  a green-colored pigment that absorbs sunlight, and allows the plant to make\n  its own food in the process known as photosynthesis. Other types of plastids\n  are the amyloplasts, specialized for starch storage, elaioplasts specialized\n  for fat storage, and chromoplasts specialized for synthesis and storage of\n  pigments. As in mitochondria, which have a genome encoding 37 genes, Anderson S, Bankier AT, et al. (1981) Sequence and\n  organization of the human mitochondrial genome.
