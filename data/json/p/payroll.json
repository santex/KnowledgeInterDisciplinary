In accounting,\npayroll refers to the amount paid to employees for services they provided\nduring a certain period of time. Payroll plays a major role in a company for\nseveral reasons.\n\nFrom an accounting perspective, payroll is crucial because payroll and payroll\ntaxes considerably affect the net income of most companies and they are subject\nto laws and regulations (e.g. in the US payroll is subject to federal and state\nregulations). From an ethics in business viewpoint payroll is a critical\ndepartment as employees are responsive to payroll errors and irregularities:\ngood employee morale requires payroll to be paid timely and accurately. The\nprimary mission of the payroll department is to ensure that all employees are\npaid accurately and timely with the correct withholdings and deductions, and to\nensure the withholdings and deductions are remitted in a timely manner. This\nincludes salary payments, tax withholdings, and deductions from a paycheck.\n",
