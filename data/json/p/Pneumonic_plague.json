It is\nmore virulent and rare than bubonic plague. The difference between the versions\nof plague is simply the location of the infection in the body; the bubonic\nplague is an infection of the lymphatic system, the pneumonic plague is an\ninfection of the respiratory system, and the septicemic plague is an infection\nin the blood stream.\n\nTypically, pneumonic form is due to a spread from infection of an initial\nbubonic form. Primary pneumonic plague results from inhalation of fine infective\ndroplets and can be transmitted from human to human without involvement of fleas\nor animals.
