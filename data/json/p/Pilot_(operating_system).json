Pilot was written in the Mesa programming language,\ntotalling about 24,000 lines of code. {{cite paper\n  | last = Lampson first = Butler W. authorlink = Butler Lampson coauthors =\n  | David D.

Pilot combined virtual\nmemory and file storage into one subsystem, and used the manager/kernel\narchitecture for managing the system and its resources. Its designers considered\na non-preemptive multitasking model, but later chose a preemptive system based\non monitors.\n\nPilot was used as the operating system for the Xerox Star workstation.\n","linknr":118,"url":"Pilot_(operating_system)","recorded":1362576171,"links":16,"instances":["computer_science","programming_language","company","synchronization"],"pdf":["http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/%7Ebrewer/cs262/Mesa.pdf","http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/%7Ebrewer/cs262/Mesa.pdf"],"categories":["Xerox|Pilot","History of humanâ€“computer interaction","Proprietary operating systems","1981 introductions"],"headings":["Further reading","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0a/Copland_organization.svg/50px-Copland_organization.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["parc","company"],["mesa","programming_language"],["parc","company"],["mesa","programming_language"],["kernel","computer_science"],["monitor","synchronization"]],"members":["kernel","mesa","parc","monitor"],"related":["PARC_(company)","Xerox_Star","Graphical_user_interface","Mesa_(programming_language)","English_language","Computer_multitasking","Operating_system","PARC_(company)","Mesa_(programming_language)","Programming_language","Source_lines_of_code","Inter-process_communication","Virtual_memory","Kernel_(computer_science)","Monitor_(synchronization)","Xerox_Star","Timeline_of_operating_systems"]}
