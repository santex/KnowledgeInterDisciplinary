{"cursor":"3403","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Points', sometimes also called a \"'discount point'\", are a form of pre-paid\ninterest. One point equals one percent of the loan amount. By charging a\nborrower points, a lender effectively increases the yield on the loan above the\namount of the stated interest rate. Borrowers can offer to pay a lender points\nas a method to reduce the interest rate on the loan, thus obtaining a lower\nmonthly payment in exchange for this up-front payment. For each point purchased,\nthe loan rate is typically reduced by 1/8% (0.125%).\n\nPaying Points represent a calculated gamble on the part of the buyer. There will\nbe a specific point in the timeline of the loan where the money spent to buy\ndown the interest rate will be equal to the money saved by making reduced loan\npayments resulting from the lower interest rate on the loan.\n\nSelling the property or refinancing prior to this break-even point will result\nin a net financial loss for the buyer while keeping the loan for longer than\nthis break-even point will result in a net financial savings for the buyer. The\nlonger you keep the property financed under the loan with purchased points, the\nmore the money spent on the points will pay off. Accordingly, if the intention\nis to buy and sell the property or refinance in a rapid fashion, buying points\nis actually going to end up costing more than just paying the loan at the higher\ninterest rate.\n\nPoints may also be purchased to reduce the monthly payment for the purpose of\nqualifying for a loan. Loan qualification based on monthly income versus the\nmonthly loan payment may sometimes only be achievable by reducing the monthly\npayment through the purchasing of points to buy down the interest rate, thereby\nreducing the monthly loan payment.\n\nDiscount points may be different from origination fee or broker fee. Discount\npoints are always used to buy down the interest rates, while origination fees\nsometimes are fees the lender charges for the loan or sometimes just another\nname for buying down the interest rate. Origination fee and discount points are\nboth items listed under lender-charges on the HUD-1 Settlement Statement.\n\nThe difference in savings over the life of the loan can make paying points a\nbenefit to the borrower. If you intend to stay in your home for an extended\nperiod of time, it may be worthwhile to pay additional points in order to obtain\na lower interest rate. Any significant changes in fees should be re-disclosed in\nthe final good faith estimate (GFE).\n\nAlso directly related to points is the concept of the 'no closing cost loan'. If\npoints are paid to acquire a loan, it is impossible at the same time for a\nbroker bank or lender to make a premium for a higher rate. When premium is\nearned by making the note rate higher, this premium is sometimes used to pay the\nclosing costs.\n","linknr":90,"url":"Point_(mortgage)","recorded":1363368917,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Point_(mortgage)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Point_(mortgage)&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/Point_(disambiguation)","/wiki/Interest","/wiki/Loan","/wiki/Interest_rate","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Origination_fee","/w/index.php?title=Broker_fee&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/HUD-1_Settlement_Statement","/wiki/Good_faith_estimate","/wiki/No_closing_cost_loan","/w/index.php?title=Point_(mortgage)&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","http://www.ginniemae.gov/4_home/closing_cost.asp?section=YPTH","http://www.ginniemae.gov/4_home/closing_cost.asp?section=YPTH","/w/index.php?title=Point_(mortgage)&action=edit&section=2","http://www.irs.gov/publications/p936/ar02.html#en_US_publink100037108","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Point_(mortgage)&oldid=540925348","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Mortgage","/wiki/Category:Mathematical_finance","/wiki/Category:Interest","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Point+%28mortgage%29&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Point+%28mortgage%29","/wiki/Point_(mortgage)","/wiki/Talk:Point_(mortgage)","#","/wiki/Point_(mortgage)","/w/index.php?title=Point_(mortgage)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Point_(mortgage)&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Point_(mortgage)","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Point_(mortgage)","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Point_(mortgage)&oldid=540925348","/w/index.php?title=Point_(mortgage)&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Point_%28mortgage%29&id=540925348","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Point+%28mortgage%29","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Point+%28mortgage%29&oldid=540925348&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Point_(mortgage)&printable=yes","//de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disagio","//kk.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%94%D0%B8%D0%B7%D0%B0%D0%B6%D0%B8%D0%BE","//nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disagio","//ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%94%D0%B8%D0%B7%D0%B0%D0%B6%D0%B8%D0%BE","//uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%94%D0%B8%D0%B7%D0%B0%D0%B6%D1%96%D0%BE","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:ItemByTitle/enwiki/Point
