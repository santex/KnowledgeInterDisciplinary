{"cursor":"1293","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Predictive inference' is an approach to statistical inference that emphasizes\nthe prediction of future observations based on past observations.\n\nInitially, predictive inference was based on observable parameters and it was\nthe main purpose of studying probability, but it fell out of favor in the 20th\ncentury due to a new parametric approach pioneered by Bruno de Finetti. The\napproach modeled phenomena as a physical system observed with error (e.g.,\ncelestial mechanics). De Finetti's idea of exchangeabilityâ-that future\nobservations should behave like past observationsâ-came to the attention of the\nEnglish-speaking world with the 1974 translation from French of his 1937\nbook, De Finetti (1974) Foresight: its Logical Laws, Its Subjective Sources\n(French: La PrÃ©vision: ses lois logiques, ses sources subjectives)  and\nhas since been propounded by such statisticians as Seymour Geisser.
