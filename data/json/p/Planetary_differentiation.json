{"cursor":"8183","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nIn planetary science, 'planetary differentiation' is the process of separating\nout different constituents of a planetary body as a consequence of their\nphysical or chemical behaviour, where the body develops into compositionally\ndistinct layers; the denser materials of a planet sink to the center, while less\ndense materials rise to the surface. Such a process tends to create a core and\nmantle. Sometimes a chemically distinct crust forms on top of the mantle. The\nprocess of planetary differentiation has occurred on planets, dwarf planets, the\nasteroid 4 Vesta, and natural satellites (such as the Moon).\n","linknr":210,"url":"Planetary_differentiation","recorded":1362268774,"links":29,"instances":["geology","astrophysics","geology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Planetary science"],"headings":["Heating","Chemical differentiation","Physical differentiation","Density differences on Earth","Theories of core formation"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Earth-crust-cutaway-english.svg/220px-Earth-crust-cutaway-english.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["mantle","geology"],["crust","geology"],["accretion","astrophysics"],["mantle","geology"],["mantle","geology"],["crust","geology"],["mantle","geology"],["mantle","geology"]],"members":["mantle","accretion","crust"],"related":["Planetary_science","Density","Planet","Planetary_core","Mantle_(geology)","Crust_(geology)","Dwarf_planet","4_Vesta","Natural_satellite","Moon","Sun","Solar_nebula","Hydrogen","Helium","Solar_wind","Radiation_pressure","Protoplanet","Radioactive","Radioactive_decay","Planet","Meteorite","Asteroid","Accretion_(astrophysics)","Chemical_reaction","Density","Earth","Iron","Continental_crust","Mantle_(geology)","Hydrocarbons","Methane","Water","Carbon_dioxide","Fractionation","Uranium","Silicate","Density","Siderophile_element","Metal_alloy","Chalcophile","Planetary_core","Talc","Mantle_(geology)","Crust_(geology)","Hydrosphere","Atmosphere","Diapir","Salt_dome","Granite","Serpentinite","Mantle_(geology)","Subduction_zone","Mud_volcano","Basalt","Potassium","Rare_earth_element","Phosphorus","KREEP","Uranium","Thorium","Lunar_magma_ocean","Magma","Partial_melting","Mantle_(geology)","Igneous_rock","Thermophoresis","Thermophoresis","Magma_chamber","Earth","Moon","Earth","Iron_catastrophe","Rain-out_model"]}
