{"cursor":"9005","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Phagocytosis' ( (phagein) |to devour||, (kytos) |cell||-osis|process}}) is the\ncellular process of engulfing solid particles by the cell membrane to form an\ninternal phagosome by phagocytes and protists. Phagocytosis was revealed by [http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1908/mechnikov-\nbio.html Ilya Mechnikov] in 1882. Phagocytosis is a specific form of endocytosis\ninvolving the vesicular internalization of solids such as bacteria, and is,\ntherefore, distinct from other forms of endocytosis such as the vesicular\ninternalization of various liquids. Phagocytosis is involved in the acquisition\nof nutrients for some cells, and, in the immune system, it is a major mechanism\nused to remove pathogens and cell debris. Bacteria, dead tissue cells, and small\nmineral particles are all examples of objects that may be phagocytosed.\n\nThe process is homologous to eating only at the level of single-celled\norganisms; in multicellular animals, the process has been adapted to eliminate\ndebris and pathogens, as opposed to taking in fuel for cellular processes,\nexcept in the case of the animal Trichoplax.\n","linknr":288,"url":"Phagocytosis","recorded":1362512986,"links":53,"instances":["biology","biology","biology"],"pdf":["http://www.colorado.edu/intphys/iphy3700/vitCHemila92.pdf"],"categories":["Cellular processes","Articles containing video clips"],"headings":["In immune system","In apoptosis","In protists","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/ba/Phagocytosis_in_three_steps.png/250px-Phagocytosis_in_three_steps.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f2/Neutrophil_with_anthrax_copy.jpg/220px-Neutrophil_with_anthrax_copy.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cf/Trophozoites_of_Entamoeba_histolytica_with_ingested_erythrocytes.JPG/220px-Trophozoites_of_Entamoeba_histolytica_with_ingested_erythrocytes.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cell","biology"],["vesicle","biology"],["homology","biology"]],"members":["vesicle","homology","cell"],"related":["Cell_(biology)","Cell_membrane","Phagosome","Phagocytes","Protists","Endocytosis","Vesicle_(biology)","Bacteria","Immune_system","Pathogen","Homology_(biology)","Trichoplax","Bacillus_anthracis","Pathogen-associated_molecular_pattern","NF-ÎºB","Opsonin","C3b","Antibody","Lysosome","NADPH","Reactive_oxygen_species","Hydrogen_peroxide","Myeloperoxidase","Hypochlorite","Defensin","Lysozyme","Lactoferrin","Phagocyte","Dendritic_cell","Apoptosis","Efferocytosis","Calreticulin","Phosphatidylserine","Annexin_A1","LDL","Thrombospondin_1","Gas-6","MFG-E8","CD36","Alpha-v_beta-3","Protist","Osmotrophic","Amoeba","Pseudopod","Red_blood_cell","Ciliate","Cytostome","Phagosome","Lysosome","Enzyme","Phagolysosome","Cytosol","Mixotrophy","Phototrophic","Antigen_presenting_cell","Antigen_presentation","Pinocytosis","Phagocyte","Emperipolesis","Exocytosis","Endocytosis","Residual_body","Active_Transport","Paracytophagy"]}
