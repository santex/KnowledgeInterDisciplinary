{"cursor":"1461","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nThe 'phosphagens' are energy storage compounds, also known as high-energy\nphosphate compounds, are chiefly found in muscular tissue in animals. They allow\na high-energy phosphate pool to be maintained in a concentration range, which,\nif it all were ATP, would create problems due to the ATP consuming reactions in\nthese tissues. As muscle tissues can have sudden demands for lots of energy;\nthese compounds can maintain a reserve of high-energy phosphates that can be\nused as needed, to provide the energy that could not be immediately supplied by\nglycolysis or oxidative phosphorylation. Phosphagens supply immediate but\nlimited energy.\n\nThe actual biomolecule used as a phosphagen is dependent on the organism. The\nmajority of animals use arginine/phosphoarginine as phosphagens; however, the\nphylum Chordata (i.e., animals with spinal cords) use creatine. Creatine\nphosphate, or phosphocreatine, is made from ATP by the enzyme creatine kinase in\na reversible reaction:\n\n* Creatine + ATP \\leftrightarrow creatine phosphate + ADP (this\n  reaction is Mg ++ -dependent)\n\nHowever, annelids (segmented worms) use a set of unique phosphagens; for\nexample, earthworms use the compound lombricine.\n","linknr":93,"url":"Phosphagen","recorded":1362372440,"links":12,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Biomolecules","Metabolism","Phosphates"],"headings":[],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/1/b/1/1b18a4c4fc578ef4cfd1cc0eb0daa473.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["High-energy_phosphate","Muscle","Animal","Adenosine_triphosphate","Adenosine_triphosphate","Glycolysis","Oxidative_phosphorylation","Biomolecule","Chordata","Creatine","Creatine_phosphate","Creatine_phosphate","Creatine_kinase","Annelids","Lombricine"]}
