The enzyme is biotin dependent. The product of\nthe reaction is (S)-methylmalonyl CoA. Propionyl CoA is the end product of\nmetabolism of odd-chain fatty acids, and is also a metabolite of most methyl-\nbranched fatty acids. It is also the main metabolite of valine, and together\nwith acetyl-CoA, is a metabolite of isoleucine, as well as a methionine\nmetabolite. Propionyl-CoA is thus of great importance as a glucose precursor.\n(S)-Methylmalonyl-CoA is not directly utilizable by animals; it is acted on by a\nracemase to give (R)-methylmalonyl-CoA. The latter is converted by methylmalonyl-\nCoA mutase (one of a very few Vitamin B 12 dependent enzymes) to give\nsuccinyl-CoA. The latter is converted to oxaloacetate and then malate in the\nKrebs cycle. Export of malate into the cytosol leads to formation of\noxaloacetate, phosphoenol pyruvate, and other gluconeogenic intermediates.\n\n: ATP + propanoyl-CoA + HCO 3-  ADP + phosphate +\n: (S)-methylmalonyl-CoA\n\nIt has been classified both as a ligase and a lyase.\n","linknr":693,"url":"Propionyl-CoA_carboxylase","recorded":1362502974,"links":22,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["EC 6.4.1"],"headings":["Enzyme Structure","Enzyme Mechanism","Isozymes","Pathology","Regulation","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Nihms213291f1.jpg/220px-Nihms213291f1.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c1/Nihms213291f3.jpg/220px-Nihms213291f3.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/11/Labeled_PCC_Mechanism.pdf/page1-220px-Labeled_PCC_Mechanism.pdf.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Carboxylation","Propionyl_CoA","Mitochondrial_matrix","Biotin","Methylmalonyl_CoA","Propionyl_CoA","Acetyl-CoA","Methionine","Propionyl-CoA","Glucose","Succinyl-CoA","Oxaloacetate","Malate","Krebs_cycle","Malate","Oxaloacetate","Phosphoenol_pyruvate","Ligase","Lyase","Biotin_carboxylase","Biotin","Beta_barrel","Carboxylation","Propionyl-CoA","Oxyanion_hole","Site-directed_mutagenesis","Phenylglyoxal","Adenosine_triphosphate","Michaelisâ€“Menten_kinetics","Isoelectric_point","Carbanion","Isozyme","Propionic_acidemia","Carbamazepine","Chaperonin","Glucokinase","Anaplerotic_reactions","Propionic_acidemia"]}
