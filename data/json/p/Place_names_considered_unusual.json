{"cursor":"3959","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Unusual place names' are names for cities, towns, and other regions which are\nconsidered non-ordinary in some manner. Examples would be place names that are\nalso swear words, inadvertently humorous words, or highly charged words in\nanother language, such as Fucking, Austria; Hell, Norway; Hell, Grand Cayman\n(Cayman Islands); Dildo Island, Canada ; or Condom, Gers\n(France).\n\nAnother example is names which are offensive, due to their no longer being\nacceptable, often through historic changes in what is\ntolerated. There is no commonly\ndefined measure for what makes a place name unusual, though unorthodox spelling\nor pronunciation, short or long names, and names derived from unusual sources,\nsuch as Truth or Consequences, New Mexico, are often seen as unusual, especially\nby people outside the culture which named them.\n\n\n","linknr":121,"url":"Place_names_considered_unusual","recorded":1362560275,"links":16,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Place names","Lists of things considered unusual"],"headings":["See also","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Fucking,_Austria","Hell,_Norway","Hell,_Grand_Cayman","Cayman_Islands","Dildo_Island","Canada","Condom,_Gers","List_of_short_place_names","List_of_long_place_names","Truth_or_Consequences,_New_Mexico","Toponymy"]}
