So, for\nexample, when a theory defines the concept of a relation, then a predicate is\nsimply the characteristic function or the indicator function of a relation.\nHowever, not all theories have relations, or are founded on set theory, and so\none must be careful with the proper definition and semantic interpretation of a\npredicate.\n","linknr":425,"url":"Predicate_(mathematical_logic)","recorded":1362683973,"links":30,"instances":["mathematics","mathematics","probability_theory"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Predicate logic","Propositional calculus","Basic concepts in set theory","Fuzzy logic","Mathematical logic"],"headings":["Simplified overview","Formal definition","See also","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["relation","mathematics"],["function","mathematics"],["characteristic_function","probability_theory"]],"members":["function","relation","characteristic_function"],"related":["Mathematics","Boolean-valued_function","Relation_(mathematics)","Indicator_function","Indicator_function","Set_theory","Property","Property","Propositional_function","Propositional_logic","Propositional_variable","Arity","First-order_logic","Set_theory","Indicator_function","Indicator_function","Function_(mathematics)","Truth_value","Set-builder_notation","Autoepistemic_logic","Law_of_excluded_middle","Fuzzy_logic","Characteristic_function_(probability_theory)","Probability_distribution","Free_variables_and_bound_variables","Predicate_functor_logic","Truthbearer","Multigrade_predicate"]}
