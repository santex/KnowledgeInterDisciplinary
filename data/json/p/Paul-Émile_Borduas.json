He was also an activist for the\nseparation of church and state, especially for art, in Quebec.\n\nBorduas was born on November the first, 1905, in Saint-Hilaire, Quebec (a small\nvillage 50 kilometers from MontrÃ©al). He was the fourth child of Magloire\nBorduas and Ãva Perrault. As a child he engaged in bricolage - his first known\nartistic activity. He received five years of formal elementary school education,\n(which ended at the age of twelve) and some private lessons from a village\nresident. Fortuitously, Borduas met Ozias Leduc in the winter of 1921-\n1922, and Leduc agreed to take the young artist under his wing. At the age of\nsixteen he became an apprentice to Ozias Leduc, who was a church painter and\ndecorator. Leduc provided Borduas with a basic artistic training, teaching him\nhow to restore and decorate churches. Leduc arranged for Borduas' instruction at\nthe Ãcole Technique, in 1919, in Sherbrooke, QuÃ©bec. In 1923, assisted by a\nscholarship Leduc had secured for him, he enrolled in the Ãcole des Beaux-Arts\nde MontrÃ©al, continuing to work for Leduc at the same time. He received prizes\nfor his paintings at both of these institutions. Despite discord between Borduas\nand the school administration, he continued his studies at Leduc's\nurgings..\n\nUpon graduation in 1927 Borduas was hired by the MontrÃ©al Catholic School Board\nas a high school art teacher. In January 1929 he began studies at the Ateliers\nd'Art SacrÃ© in Paris, which he left to pursue church decoration work of\nRambucourt, in the Meuse Valley, with Pierre Dubois in April. He returned to Saint-\nHilaire in June 1930 (his funds being depleted), began teaching part-time, and\nin 1933 returned to teaching high school for the Catholic School Board of\nMontrÃ©al. In 1937 Borduas began teaching at l'Ãcole du Meuble. This was an\nimportant time in Borduas' life: Â«by meeting young men of his own generation\nwith the same tastes and the same need for action, he finally discovered a\nstimulating intellectual and social environmentÂ».\n\nIn 1938 he encountered John Lyman, a MontrÃ©al painter and critic, at the first\nexhibition of one of Borduas' paintings. Lyman encouraged Borduas' involvement\nwith the Contemporary Arts Society, and in January 1938 he was elected vice-\npresident of this group. In 1941 he resumed painting after several years of\nstudy and teaching, during which time he and a group of students had met\nregularly to discuss recent trends in European art. His first abstract paintings\ndate from this year, and in April 1942 he exhibited forty-five gouaches inspired\nby the abstract surrealism of Joan MirÃ³. He became increasingly involved with\nabout a dozen of his students, and they became known collectively as the [[Les\nAutomatistes|Automatistes]] for their attempts to paint with pure psychic\nautomatism as per the writings of AndrÃ© Breton. In January 1946, the first group\nexhibit of Borduas and his students was held in New York City, followed in April\nby an exhibit in Montreal. This was the first exhibit by a group of abstract\npainters in Canada. A second Montreal exhibit followed in\nFebruaryâMarch 1947. A critic, responding to this exhibit, coined the name\n\"Automatists\" for the group, after Borduas' painting Automatisme 1.47.\n\nBorduas wrote [[Refus Global]] (or \"Global Refusal\", anglicized) in late 1947-\nearly 1948. It was disseminated in a folder that contained other Automatists'\nwritings. This piece was originally intended to accompany an Automatist showing,\nhowever it was actually distributed alone. \"Global Refusal\" served as an\nimportant manifesto that advocated the separation of church and state in Quebec,\nespecially for the arts. In it Borduas \"denounces the forces of oppression that\nhad made of Quebec a suffocating environment. hostile to both individual and\ncollective creativity\".  We foresee a future in which man\nis freed from useless chains, to realize a plenitude of individual gifts, in\nnecessary unpredictability, spontaneity and resplendent anarchy. Until then,\nwithout surrender or rest, in community of feeling with those who thirst for\nbetter life, without fear of set-backs, in encouragement or persecution, we\nshall pursue in joy our overwhelming need for liberation. \n\n\nThe manifesto has been considered to be one of the primary causes of the\nQuiet Revolution in Quebec. Four hundred copies went on sale August 9, 1948.\nBorduas was dismissed from l'Ãcole du Meuble on September 2 as a direct\nresult of his involvement in this social critique. Even those who had tired\nof the repressive Duplessis rÃ©gime, and advocated great social changes in\nQuÃ©bec, were reluctant to back Borduas' thorough condemnation of the\nCatholic Church —such a central influence on the French\nCanadian populace.\n\nBorduas was ostracized, he was unable to attain employment and this was\nnecessarily problematic as he was a father. He decided to take matters into his\nown hands. Borduas produced another piece in his defence, Â«Projections\nLibÃ©rantesÂ» (Â«Liberating ProjectionsÂ»), which he completed in February\n1949. Unfortunately, this more moderate composition, which clearly\ncommunicated Borduas' intentions in releasing Â«Refus GlobalÂ», was not\nenthusiastically received by the public or the presses.\n\nIn 1955 he moved back to Paris where he died of a heart attack in 1960.\n\nIn May 2012 his painting Froissement Multicolore sold for $663,750 at auction,\nsurpassing the artist's previous auction price record by $150,000.\n\n","linknr":186,"url":"Paul-Émile_Borduas","recorded":1375083040,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Paul-%C3%89mile_Borduas&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Paul-%C3%89mile_Borduas&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:Footnotes","/wiki/Wikipedia:External_links","/wiki/File:Paul-%C3%89mile_Borduas.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/88/Paul-%C3%89mile_Borduas.JPG/150px-Paul-%C3%89mile_Borduas.JPG","/wiki/Les_Automatistes","/wiki/Joan_Mir%C3%B3","/wiki/File:Paul-Emile_Borduas.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/Paul-Emile_Borduas.JPG/220px-Paul-Emile_Borduas.JPG","/wiki/File:Paul-Emile_Borduas.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf8/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/File:Place_Paul-Emile-Borduas.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Place_Paul-Emile-Borduas.JPG/220px-Place_Paul-Emile-Borduas.JPG","/wiki/File:Place_Paul-Emile-Borduas.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf8/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/File:Composition_11_Borduas.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5d/Composition_11_Borduas.jpg/220px-Composition_11_Borduas.jpg","/wiki/File:Composition_11_Borduas.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf8/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Mus%C3%A9e_des_beaux-arts_de_Montr%C3%A9al","/wiki/Canada","/wiki/Painting","/wiki/Abstract_art","/wiki/Quebec","/w/index.php?title=Saint-Hilaire,_Quebec&action=edit&redlink=1","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Ozias_Leduc","/wiki/%C3%89cole_des_Beaux-Arts_de_Montr%C3%A9al","#cite_note-2","#cite_note-3","/wiki/John_Goodwin_Lyman","/w/index.php?title=Contemporary_Arts_Society&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Joan_Mir%C3%B3","/wiki/Les_Automatistes","/wiki/Andr%C3%A9_Breton","#cite_note-4","/wiki/Refus_Global","#cite_note-5","#cite_note-6","/wiki/Quiet_Revolution","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","#cite_note-7","#cite_note-8","#cite_note-9","#cite_note-10","/w/index.php?title=Paul-%C3%89mile_Borduas&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Paul-%C3%89mile_Borduas&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Prix_du_Qu%C3%A9bec","/wiki/Prix_Paul-%C3%89mile-Borduas","#cite_note-11","/wiki/Prix_Condorcet","/wiki/Refus_Global","/w/index.php?title=Paul-%C3%89mile_Borduas&action=edit&section=3","#cite_ref-1","/w/index.php?title=Template:Gagnon&action=edit&redlink=1","#cite_ref-2","/w/index.php?title=Template:Gagnon&action=edit&redlink=1","#cite_ref-3","/w/index.php?title=Template:Gagnon&action=edit&redlink=1","#cite_ref-4","#CITEREFReid1988","#cite_ref-5","/w/index.php?title=Template:Gagnon&action=edit&redlink=1","#cite_ref-6","/w/index.php?title=Template:Borduas_in_Gagnon&action=edit&redlink=1","#cite_ref-7","/w/index.php?title=Template:%C3%89thier-Blais&action=edit&redlink=1","#cite_ref-8","/w/index.php?title=Template:Borduas_in_Gagnon&action=edit&redlink=1","#cite_ref-9","http://www.cbc.ca/news/arts/story/2012/05/25/sothebys-canadian-art-records.html","/wiki/CBC_News","#cite_ref-10","http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2012/canadian-art-t00140/lot.15.html","/w/index.php?title=Sotheby%27s_Canada&action=edit&redlink=1","#cite_ref-11","http://data4.collectionscanada.gc.ca/netacgi/nph-brs?s1=(art.TITP.)+Or+(art.TITI.+And+null.B742.)&l=20&d=STMP&p=1&u=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/archivianet/02011702_e.html&r=3&f=G&Sect1=STMP","/w/index.php?title=Paul-%C3%89mile_Borduas&action=edit&section=4","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0-19-540663-X","/w/index.php?title=Paul-%C3%89mile_Borduas&action=edit&section=5","http://cybermuse.gallery.ca/cybermuse/search/artist_work_e.jsp?iartistid=599","http://cybermuse.gallery.ca/","http://classic-web.archive.org/web/20080309121009/http://www.artotheque.ca/image/refus-a.html","/wiki/Refus_Global","http://www.dantaylor.com/pages/frenchrefusglobal.html","http://www.dantaylor.com/pages/refusglobal.html","http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&id_nbr=7995","http://www.godardgallery.com/borduas.htm","http://www.agora.qc.ca/mot.nsf/Dossiers/Paul-Emile_Borduas","http://www.mta.ca/faculty/arts/canadian_stud
