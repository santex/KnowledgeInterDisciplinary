      "text" : "In philosophy, 'particulars' are concrete entities existing in space and time\nas opposed to abstractions. There are, however, theories of [[abstract\nparticulars]] or [[Trope (philosophy)|tropes]]. For example, Socrates is a\nparticular (there's only one Socrates-the-teacher-of-Plato and one cannot make\ncopies of him, e.g., by cloning him, without introducing new, distinct\nparticulars). Redness, by contrast, is not a particular, because it is\nabstract and multiply instantiated (my bicycle, this apple, and that woman's\nhair are all red).\n\nSybil Wolfram<ref>Sybil Wolfram, Philosophical Logic, Routledge, London and New\nYouk, 1989, ISBN 0-415-02317-3, page 55</ref> writes <blockquote> Particulars\ninclude only individuals of a certain kind: as a first approximation individuals\nwith a definite place in space and time, such as persons and material objects or\nevents, or which must be identified through such individuals, like smiles or\nthoughts. </blockquote> Some terms are used by philosophers with a rough-and-\nready idea of their meaning. This can occur if there is lack of agreement about\nthe best definition of the term. In formulating a solution to the problem of\nuniversals, the term 'particular' can be used to describe the particular\ninstance of redness of a certain apple as opposed to the 'universal' 'redness'\n(being abstract). See also type-token distinction\n\nThe term particular is also used as a modern equivalent of the Aristotelian\nnotion of individual substance. Used in this sense, particular can mean any\nconcrete (individual) entity, irrespective of whether it is spatial and\ntemporal or not.\n",
