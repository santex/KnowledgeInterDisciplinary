{"cursor":"3759","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Phosphate glass' is a class of optical glasses composed of metaphosphates of\nvarious metals. Instead of SiO 2 in silicate glasses, the glass\nforming substrate is P 2O 5.\n\nP 2O 5 crystallizes in at least four forms. The most\nfamiliar polymorph (see figure) comprises molecules of\nP 4O 10 . The other polymorphs are polymeric, but in each\ncase the phosphorus atoms are bound by a tetrahedron of oxygen atoms, one of\nwhich forms a terminal P=O bond. The O-form adopts a layered structure\nconsisting of interconnected P 6O 6 rings, not unlike the\nstructure adopted by certain polysilicates.\n\n\nPhosphate glasses are highly resistant to hydrofluoric acid. With addition of\niron oxide, they act as efficient heat absorbers.\n\nIron phosphate and lead iron phosphate glass are alternatives to borosilicate\nglass for immobilization of radioactive waste.\n\nPhosphate glasses can be advantageous over silica glasses for optical fibers\nwith high concentration of doping rare earth ions.\n\nA mix of fluoride glass and phosphate glass is fluorophosphate glass.\n\nSilver-containing phosphate glass is used in phosphate glass dosimeters. It\nemits fluorescent light when irradiated by ultraviolet light, when previously\nexposed to ionizing radiation, in an amount proportional to the dose.\n\nSome phosphate glasses are bio-compatible and water-soluble and are suited for\nuse as degradable tissue and bone scaffolds within the human body.\n","linknr":134,"url":"Phosphate_glass","recorded":1362481728,"links":22,"instances":["materials_science"],"pdf":["http://glass-fracture.org/Documents/166%20%202nd%20phos,%20jncs%20288%202001.pdf","http://glass-fracture.org/Documents/166%20%202nd%20phos,%20jncs%20288%202001.pdf","http://www.pnl.gov/main/publications/external/technical_reports/PNNL-14251.pdf","http://www.pnl.gov/main/publications/external/technical_reports/PNNL-14251.pdf","http://glass-fracture.org/Documents/166%20%202nd%20phos,%20jncs%20288%202001.pdf","http://glass-fracture.org/Documents/166%20%202nd%20phos,%20jncs%20288%202001.pdf"],"categories":["Glass compositions","Phosphates"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/Phosphorus-pentoxide-3D-balls.png/220px-Phosphorus-pentoxide-3D-balls.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/74/Lens_triplet.svg/36px-Lens_triplet.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["polymorphism","materials_science"]],"members":["polymorphism"],"related":["Glass","Metaphosphate","Silicon_dioxide","Silicate_glass","Phosphorus_pentoxide","Polymorphism_(materials_science)","Silicate","Hydrofluoric_acid","Iron_oxide","Borosilicate_glass","Radioactive_waste","Optical_fiber","Fluoride_glass","Fluorophosphate_glass","Silver","Phosphate_glass_dosimeter","Ionizing_radiation"]}
