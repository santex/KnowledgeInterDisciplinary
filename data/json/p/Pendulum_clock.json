The advantage of a pendulum for timekeeping is that it is a\nharmonic oscillator; it swings back and forth in a precise time interval\ndependent on its length, and resists swinging at other rates. From its invention\nin 1656 by Christiaan Huygens until the 1930s, the pendulum clock was the\nworld's most precise timekeeper, accounting for its widespread use. {{cite\nbook |last=Milham |first=Willis I. |title=Time and Timekeepers |year=1945\n|publisher=MacMillan |location=New York |isbn=0-7808-0008-7}}, p.330,\n334 {{cite journal |last=Marrison |first=Warren |title=The Evolution\nof the Quartz Crystal Clock |journal=Bell System Technical Journal |year=1948\n|volume=27 |pages=510â588 |url=http://www.ieee-\nuffc.org/freqcontrol/marrison/Marrison.html}} Pendulum clocks must be\nstationary to operate; any motion or accelerations will affect the motion of the\npendulum, causing inaccuracies, so other mechanisms must be used in portable\ntimepieces. They are now kept mostly for their decorative and antique value.\n","linknr":361,"url":"Pendulum_clock","recorded":1362575444,"links":54,"instances":["clockmaker","clockwork","horology","element","horology","horology","physics","ethnic_group_and_nation","horology"],"pdf":["http://web.archive.org/web/20080410084732/http://www.physics.gatech.edu/research/schatz/pubs/royclocks2.pdf","http://www.physics.gatech.edu/research/schatz/pubs/royclocks2.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20080410084732/http://www.physics.gatech.edu/research/schatz/pubs/royclocks2.pdf","http://tf.nist.gov/timefreq/general/pdf/1485.pdf","http://tf.nist.gov/timefreq/general/pdf/1485.pdf","http://web.mit.edu/biophysics/papers/NATURENV2009.pdf","http://web.mit.edu/biophysics/papers/NATURENV2009.pdf"],"categories":["Clocks","Horology","Pendulums","Dutch inventions","Obsolete technologies"],"headings":["History","Mechanism","Gravity-swing pendulum","Torsion pendulum","Escapement","Time Indication","Styles","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8c/Galileo_Pendulum_Clock.jpg/138px-Galileo_Pendulum_Clock.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/28/GB-3-Gew-Pendeluhr_%28Luekk%29.jpg/110px-GB-3-Gew-Pendeluhr_%28Luekk%29.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/17/Huygens_first_pendulum_clock_-_front_view.png/120px-Huygens_first_pendulum_clock_-_front_view.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/Huygens_first_pendulum_clock.png/112px-Huygens_first_pendulum_clock.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9f/Edward_East_winged_lantern_clock.jpg/170px-Edward_East_winged_lantern_clock.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/19/Rivaz_marine_clock_circa_1750.jpg/220px-Rivaz_marine_clock_circa_1750.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b5/Old_Pendulum_clock.jpg/220px-Old_Pendulum_clock.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/3/0/530d07694da5d4fa1ecf8979e7699d79.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a3/Ansonia_Clock_Co.jpg/220px-Ansonia_Clock_Co.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["dutch","ethnic_group_and_nation"],["movement","clockwork"],["isochronous","horology"],["george_graham","clockmaker"],["george_graham","clockmaker"],["wheel_train","horology"],["complication","horology"],["repeater","horology"],["bob","physics"],["mercury","element"],["wheel_train","horology"]],"members":["george_graham","movement","complication","mercury","repeater","wheel_train","bob","dutch","isochronous"],"related":["Galileo_Galilei","Clock","Pendulum","Time","Harmonic_oscillator","Christiaan_Huygens","Acceleration","Antique","Dutch_(ethnic_group_and_nation)","Christiaan_Huygens","Salomon_Coster","Galileo_Galilei","Frequency","Harmonic_oscillator","Verge_and_foliot","Verge_escapement","Verge_escapement","Frequency","Movement_(clockwork)","Isochronous_(horology)","Anchor_escapement","Seconds_pendulum","Longcase_clock","Horological","Deadbeat_escapement","George_Graham_(clockmaker)","Thermal_expansion","George_Graham_(clockmaker)","Gridiron_pendulum","John_Harrison","Clockmaker","Industrial_Revolution","Celestial_navigation","Time_signal","NIST","Riefler_escapement","Shortt-Synchronome_clock","Quartz_clock","Quartz_clock","Electric_clock","Electric_power_grid","Edward_Thomas_Hall","National_Watch_and_Clock_Museum","Mainspring","Gear_train","Wheel_train_(horology)","Escapement","Clock_face","Complication_(horology)","Striking_clock","Westminster_quarters","Moon_phase","Equation_of_time","Repeater_(horology)","Master_clock","Solenoid","Magnetic_force","Switch","Photodetector","Quartz_clock","Quartz_crystal","Frequency","Gravitational_acceleration","Bob_(physics)","George_Graham","Mercury_(element)","Gridiron_pendulum","John_Harrison","Zinc","Brass","Steel","Invar","Fused_silica","Spirit_level","Watch_timing_machine","Torsion_pendulum_clock","Gear","Grasshopper_escapement","Remontoire","Phototube","Electromagnet","Vacuum","W.H._Shortt","Shortt-Synchronome_clock","Clock_face","Wheel_train_(horology)","Status_symbol","Antique","Act_of_Parliament_clock","Banjo_clock","Bracket_clock","Cartel_clock","Cuckoo_clock","Longcase_clock","Lantern_clock","Mantel_clock","Master_clock","Ogee","Schoolhouse_regulator","Shortt-Synchronome_clock","Turret_clock","Steam_clock","Odd_sympathy"]}
