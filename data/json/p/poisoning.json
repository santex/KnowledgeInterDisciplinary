The skull and\ncrossbones has long been a standard symbol for poison.]] In the context of\nbiology, 'poisons' are substances that cause disturbances to\norganisms, usually by chemical reaction or other activity on the\nmolecular scale, when a sufficient quantity is absorbed by an organism. The\nfields of medicine (particularly veterinary) and zoology often distinguish a\npoison from a toxin, and from a venom. Toxins are poisons produced by some\nbiological function in nature, and venoms are usually defined as toxins that are\ninjected by a bite or sting to cause their effect, while other poisons are\ngenerally defined as substances absorbed through epithelial linings such as the\nskin or gut.\n","linknr":627,"url":"poisoning","recorded":1362898864,"links":88,"instances":["element","biology","pharmacology","circulatory","poison","chemistry","poison"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Poisons|","Execution
