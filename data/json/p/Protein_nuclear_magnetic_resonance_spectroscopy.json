{"cursor":"30893","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of proteins' (usually abbreviated\n'protein NMR') is a field of structural biology in which NMR spectroscopy is\nused to obtain information about the structure and dynamics of proteins. The\nfield was pioneered by Richard R. Ernst and Kurt WÃ¼thrich, [http://www.nature.com/nsmb/journal/v8/n11/full/nsb1101-\n923.html] among others. Protein NMR techniques are continually being used\nand improved in both academia and the biotech industry. Structure determination\nby NMR spectroscopy usually consists of several following phases, each using a\nseparate set of highly specialized techniques. The sample is prepared,\nresonances are assigned, restraints are generated and a structure is calculated\nand validated.\n","linknr":379,"url":"Protein_nuclear_magnetic_resonance_spectroscopy","recorded":1362544404,"links":22,"instances":["chemistry","software","protein","software","unit","nmr"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Protein methods","Biophysics","Protein structure","Nuclear magnetic resonance"],"headings":["Sample preparation","Data collection","Resonance assignment","Restraint generation","Hydrogen–deuterium exchange","Structure calculation","Structure Validation","Dynamics","NMR spectroscopy on large proteins","Automation of the process","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/NMR_sample.JPG/220px-NMR_sample.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/72/Tocsycosy.jpg/200px-Tocsycosy.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/41/Hncahncoca.jpg/200px-Hncahncoca.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d0/RDC_and_protein_structure.png/300px-RDC_and_protein_structure.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/04/Ensemble_of_NMR_structures.jpg/300px-Ensemble_of_NMR_structures.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["mole","unit"],["residue","chemistry"],["aria","software"],["cyana","software"],["chaperone","protein"],["relaxation","nmr"]],"members":["residue","aria","chaperone","cyana","mole","relaxation"],"related":["Structural_biology","NMR_spectroscopy","Richard_R._Ernst","Kurt_Wüthrich","Academia","Biotechnology","Protein_purification","Mole_(unit)","Protein_expression","Recombinant_DNA","Genetic_engineering","Protein_expression","Isotope","Isotopic_labeling","Buffer_solution","NMR_tube","Chemical_shift","Radiofrequency","Pulse_sequence","Chemical_shift","Heteronuclear_single_quantum_correlation","Proline","Tryptophan","Chemical_conformation","Chemical_shift","Sequential_walking","Isotopic_labeling","Methionine","Correlation_spectroscopy","Nuclear_Overhauser_effect","Amino_acid","Residue_(chemistry)","Overlap","Triple-resonance_nuclear_magnetic_resonance_spectroscopy","HNCO_experiment","HNCACO_experiment","HNCA_experiment","HNCOCA_experiment","HNCACB_experiment","CBCACONH_experiment","NOESY","Angstroms","UNIO","CYANA","ARIA_(software)","Ramachandran_plot","Karplus_equation","J-coupling","Bacteriophage","Bicelle","Polyacrylamide_gel","Residual_dipolar_coupling","Solid-state_nuclear_magnetic_resonance","Deuterium","CYANA_(Software)","XPLOR-NIH","Accuracy_and_precision","Accuracy_and_precision","Variance","WHAT_IF_software","CheShift","Nuclear_magnetic_resonance","Protein","Magnetic_fields","Nitrogen-15","HSQC","Nitrogen-15","Carbon-13","Deuterium","TROSY","Deuterium","Chaperone_(protein)","GroEL","Structural_genomics","NMR_spectroscopy","Nuclear_magnetic_resonance","Nuclear_magnetic_resonance_spectroscopy_of_carbohydrates","Nuclear_magnetic_resonance_spectroscopy_of_nucleic_acids","Protein_crystallization","Protein_dynamics","Relaxation_(NMR)","X-ray_crystallography"]}
