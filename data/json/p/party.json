A party will typically\nfeature food and beverages, and often music and dancing as well.\n\nSome parties are held in honor of a specific person, day, or event, such as a\nbirthday party, a Super Bowl party, or a St. Patrick’s Day party. Parties of\nthis kind are often called \"celebrations\". A party is not necessarily a private\noccasion. Public parties are sometimes held in restaurants, pubs, beer gardens,\nnightclubs or bars, and people attending such parties may be charged an\nadmission fee by the host.\n",
