The sensory\nreceptors cover the skin and epithelia, skeletal muscles, bones and joints,\ninternal organs, and the cardiovascular system.\n\nWhile 'touch' Also called 'tactile perception', 'tactual perception',\n'tactition', or 'haptic perception'. The adjectival forms are \"tactile\",\n\"somatosensory\", \"tactual\", and \"haptic\". is considered one of the five\ntraditional senses, the impression of touch is formed from several modalities.\nIn medicine, the colloquial term \"touch\" is usually replaced with \"'somatic\nsenses'\" to better reflect the variety of mechanisms involved.\n\nSomatic senses are sometimes referred to as 'somesthetic senses', with the\nunderstanding that somesthesis includes touch, proprioception and (depending on\nusage) also haptic perception.\n\nThe system reacts to diverse stimuli using different receptors:\nthermoreceptors, nociceptors, mechanoreceptors and chemoreceptors. Transmission\nof information from the receptors passes via sensory nerves through tracts in\nthe spinal cord and into the brain. Processing primarily occurs in the primary\nsomatosensory area in the parietal lobe of the cerebral cortex. was devised by\nWilder Penfield. ]] At its simplest, the system works when activity in a\nsensory neuron is triggered by a specific stimulus such as heat; this signal\neventually passes to an area in the brain uniquely attributed to that area on\nthe bodyâthis allows the processed stimulus to be felt at the correct location.\nThe point-to-point mapping of the body surfaces in the brain is called a\nhomunculus and is essential in the creation of a body image. This brain-surface\n(\"cortical\") map is not immutable, however. Dramatic shifts can occur in\nresponse to stroke or injury.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"physical_contact","recorded":1363582108,"links":[],"instances":["symptom","physiology","anatomy"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Somatic sensory system|"],"headings":["Anatomy","Fine touch and Crude touch","Physiology","Diseases and disorders","Technology","See also","Notes","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["organ","anatomy"],["stimulus","physiology"],["aura","symptom"]],"members":["aura","stimulus","organ"],"related":["Sensory_system","Sensory_modality","Temperature","Proprioception","Nociception","Sensory_receptors","Skin","Epithelia","Skeletal_muscle","Bone","Joint","Organ_(anatomy)","Cardiovascular_system","Adjectival_form","Sense","Stimulus_(physiology)","Thermoreceptors","Nociceptors","Mechanoreceptors","Chemoreceptors","Sensory_nerve","Spinal_cord","Postcentral_gyrus","Parietal_lobe","Cerebral_cortex","Wilder_Penfield","Neuron","Sensory_transduction","Homunculus","Body_image","Mammal","Vertebrates","Sensory_receptors","Afferent_nerve_fiber","Neurons","Central_nervous_system","Cell_body","Dorsal_root_ganglion","Spinal_nerve","Trigeminal_ganglion","Cranial_nerves","Cell_body","Axons","Decussate","Spinal_cord","Brainstem","Axons","Neurones","Thalamus","Ventral_posterior_nucleus","Reticular_activating_system","Cerebellum","Cell_body","Postcentral_gyrus","Parietal_lobe","Sensory_receptors","Mechanoreceptors","Nociceptors","Pain_sensation","Central_nervous_system","Neurones","Neurones","Sensory_modality","Neurones","Myelinated","Neurones","Receptive_field","Brain","Brain","Postcentral_gyrus","Cerebral_cortex","Dorsal_column-medial_lemniscus_pathway","Ventral_spinothalamic_tract","Human_position","Cerebellum","Ventral_spinocerebellar_tract","Dorsal_spinocerebellar_tract","Somatosensory","Neurons","Spinal_cord","Reflexes","Postcentral_gyrus","Parietal_lobe","Brodmann_area","Receptive_field","Somatotopic_arrangement","Homunculus","Sensory_homunculus","Human_brain","Human_back","Proprioception","Cerebellum","Touch","Crude_touch","Posterior_column-medial_lemniscus_pathway","Cerebral_cortex","Spinothalamic_tract","Posterior_column-medial_lemniscus_pathway","Free_nerve_ending","Mechanoreceptor","Mechanoreceptor","Chemoreceptor","Vibration","Micrometre","Pacinian_corpuscle","Depolarisation","Action_potential","Action_potential","Spinal_cord","Peripheral_neuropathy","Numbness","Paresthesia","Aura_(symptom)","Epileptic_seizure","Jacksonian_seizure","Astereognosis","Haptic_technology","Speech_therapy","Allochiria","Cell_signalling","Cellular_Cognition","Muscle_spindle","Special_senses","Vibratese","Somatosensory_Rehabilitation_of_Pain","Two-point_discrimination","Phantom_limb"]}
