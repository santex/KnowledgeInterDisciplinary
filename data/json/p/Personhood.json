Defining personhood is a\ncontroversial topic in philosophy and law, and is closely tied to legal and\npolitical concepts of citizenship, equality, and liberty. According to law, only\na natural person or legal personality has rights, protections, privileges,\nresponsibilities, and legal liability. \"Where it is more than simply a\nsynonym for 'human being', 'person' figures primarily in moral and legal\ndiscourse. A person is a being with a certain moral status, or a bearer of\nrights. But underlying the moral status, as its condition, are certain\ncapacities. A person is a being who has a sense of self, has a notion of the\nfuture and the past, can hold values, make choices; in short, can adopt life-\nplans. At least, a person must be the kind of being who is in principle capable\nof all this, however damaged these capacities may be in practice.\" Charles\nTaylor, \"The Concept of a Person\", Philosophical Papers. Volume 1. Cambridge:\nCambridge University Press, 1985, 97.\n\nPersonhood continues to be a topic of international debate, and has been\nquestioned during the abolition of slavery and the fight for women's rights, in\ndebates about abortion, fetal rights and reproductive rights, in animal rights\nactivism, as well as in debates about corporate\npersonhood.
