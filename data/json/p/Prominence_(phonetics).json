{"cursor":"2120","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n'Accent' is the phonetic 'prominence' given to a particular syllable in a word,\nor to a particular word within a phrase. When this prominence is produced\nthrough greater dynamic force, typically signaled by a combination of amplitude\n(volume), syllable or vowel length, full articulation of the vowel, and a non-\ndistinctive change in pitch, the result is called [[stress accent]], dynamic\naccent, or simply stress; when it is produced through pitch alone, it is called\n[[pitch accent]]; and when it is produced through length alone it is called\n[[quantitative accent]]. English has stress accent.\n\nA prominent syllable or word is said to be accented or tonic; the latter term\ndoes not imply that it carries phonemic tone. Other syllables or words are said\nto be unaccented or atonic. Syllables are frequently said to be in pretonic or\npost-tonic position; certain phonological rules apply specifically to such\npositions. For instance, in American English, /t/ and /d/ are flapped in post-\ntonic position.\n\nSome languages combine stress accent and pitch accent, in that accented\nsyllables are both dynamically prominent and may have more than one tone, while\nunstressed syllables do not carry tone. An example of this is Serbo-Croatian\naccent. Such systems are typically called accent or pitch accent, as the latter\nterm is not well defined.\n","linknr":165,"url":"Prominence_(phonetics)","recorded":1362575634,"links":40,"instances":["music"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Phonetics","Stress (linguistics)","Phonology","Poetic rhythm"],"headings":[],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/6c/Wiki_letter_w.svg/44px-Wiki_letter_w.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dc/Linguistics_stub.svg/40px-Linguistics_stub.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["pitch","music"]],"members":["pitch"],"related":["Phrase","Loudness","Vowel_length","Pitch_(music)","Phonemic_tone","Flap_consonant","Serbo-Croatian_accent"]}
