During the expansion, simplifications such\nas grouping of like terms or cancellations of terms may also be applied. Instead\nof multiplications, the expansion steps could also involve replacing powers of a\nsum of terms by the equivalent expression obtained from the binomial formula;\nthis is a shortened form of what would happen if the power were treated as a\nrepeated multiplication, and expanded repeatedly. It is customary to reintroduce\npowers in the final result when terms involve products of identical symbols.\n\nSimple examples of polynomial expansions are the well known rules\n: (x+y)^2=x^2+2xy+y^2 (x+y)(x-y)=x^2-y^2\nwhen used from left to right. A more general single-step expansion will\nintroduce all products of a term of one of the sums being multiplied with a term\nof the other:\n: (a+b+c+d)(x+y+z)=ax+ay+az+bx+by+bz+cx+cy+cz+dx+dy+dz\nAn expansion which involves multiple nested rewrite steps is that of working out\na Horner scheme to the (expanded) polynomial it defines, for instance\n: 1+x(-3+x(4+x(0+x(-12+x\\cdot 2))))=1-3x+4x^2-12x^4+2x^5 .\n\nThe opposite process of trying to write an expanded polynomial as a product is\ncalled polynomial factorization.\n","linknr":114,"url":"Polynomial_expansion","recorded":1362575811,"links":19,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.math.uakron.edu/~dpstory/tutorial/mptii/lesson05.pdf"],"categories":["Polynomials"],"headings":["Expansion of a polynomial written in factored form","Expansion of (x+y)<sup>'''n'''</sup>","See also","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/math/2/4/d/24d19fc6597c0514733f19f30f8c538a.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/f/6/4f6b07f273617ba0079b636b6d1b43d8.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/6/2/8/6289b9151f430ea1eb616ec41b7baedd.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/2/b/a/2bacc5cdcfe9449c09c75bdb5bd0a76b.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/e/9/0e92f472a547201347c3c95ef0a1397d.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/d/0/5d0ba8901ee22fb9d677e89da7c1ebb5.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/9/1/e91f073573b31326c17188b4b9e59bd0.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/c/2/4/c24df2d74ffd0270cb49c25c491ed0bb.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/9/1/591716256c12b5043e0dbb940d78ff69.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/Rubik%27s_cube_v3.svg/40px-Rubik%27s_cube_v3.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Mathematics","Distributive_property","Polynomial_expression","Binomial_formula","Horner_scheme","Polynomial_factorization","Binomial","FOIL_rule","Pascal's_triangle","Polynomial_factorization","Factorization","University_of_Akron"]}
