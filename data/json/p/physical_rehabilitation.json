In\naddition to clinical practice, other activities encompassed in the physical\ntherapy profession include research, education, consultation, and\nadministration. Definitions and licensing requirements in the United States vary\namong jurisdictions, as each state has enacted its own physical therapy practice\nact defining the profession within its jurisdiction, but the American Physical\nTherapy Association (APTA) has also drafted a model definition in order to limit\nthis variation, and the APTA is also responsible for accrediting physical\ntherapy education curricula throughout the United States of America. In many\nsettings, physical therapy services may be provided alongside, or in conjunction\nwith, other medical or rehabilitation services.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"physical_rehabilitation","recorded":1363582109,"links":[],"instances":["title"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Rehabilitation team","Health sciences","Rehabilitation medicine","Healthcare occupations","Physical therapy|*","Sports medicine","Therapy","Physical exercise","Manipulative therapy","Hospital departments","Allied health professions","Massage therapy"],"headings":["Overview","History of physical therapy","Education","Employment","Specialty areas","See also","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["doctor","title"]],"members":["doctor"],"related":["Health_care","United_States","Physical_therapy_practice_act","American_Physical_Therapy_Association","Physical_therapy_education","United_States_of_America","Medicine","Physical_medicine_and_rehabilitation","Occupational_therapists","Medical_history","Physical_examination","Medical_diagnosis","Electromyograms","Independent_medical_examination","National_Archives_and_Records_Administration","Hippocrates","Galenus","Massage","Manual_therapy","Hydrotherapy","Orthopedics","Gymnasticon","Gout","Per_Henrik_Ling","Massage","Joint_manipulation","Exercise","Reed_College","American_Physical_Therapy_Association","Polio","Exercise","International_Federation_of_Orthopaedic_Manipulative_Physical_Therapists","U.S._state","Physical_therapy_practice_act","Doctor_of_Physical_Therapy","Master_of_Physical_Therapy","Bachelor's_degree","Commission_on_Accreditation_in_Physical_Therapy_Education","List_of_Physical_Therapy_Schools_in_the_United_States","Diploma_of_Collegial_Studies","Associate_degree","Associate_degree","Diploma_of_Collegial_Studies","Collège_Montmorency","Dawson_College","Cégep_Marie-Victorin","Montreal","Bachelor's_degree","Physiotherapy","Kinesiology","Exercise_Science","Occupational_therapy","Université_de_Montréal","Université_de_Sherbrooke","College_education_in_Quebec","United_States_Department_of_Labor","Bureau_of_Labor_Statistics","American_Board_of_Physical_Therapy_Specialties","Respiratory_practitioner","Cystic_fibrosis","Heart_attacks","Coronary_bypass_surgery","Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease","Pulmonary_fibrosis","Electromyography","Arthritis","Osteoporosis","Cancer","Alzheimer's_disease","Urinary_incontinence","Integumentary_system","Neurological_disorder","Charcot-Marie-Tooth_disease","Amyotrophic_lateral_sclerosis","Cerebral_palsy","Multiple_sclerosis","Parkinson's_disease","Stroke","Activities_of_daily_living","Musculoskeletal_system","Dry_needling","Exercise","Electrical_muscle_stimulation","Cryotherapy","Iontophoresis","Electrotherapy","Stimulus_modality","Sonography","Spina_bifida","Torticollis","American_Board_of_Physical_Therapy_Specialties","American_Physical_Therapy_Association","Doctor_of_Physical_Therapy","Doctor_(title)","Joint_manipulation","List_of_exercise_prescription_software","Occupational_therapy"]}
