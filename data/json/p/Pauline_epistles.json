Among these letters are\nsome of the earliest extant Christian documents. They provide an insight into\nthe beliefs and controversies of early Christianity and, as part of the canon of\nthe New Testament, they have also been, and continue to be, foundational to\nChristian theology and Christian ethics. The Epistle to the Hebrews was also\nanciently attributed to Paul, but does not bear his name.\n\nThe Pauline epistles are usually placed between the Book of Acts and the General\nepistles.
