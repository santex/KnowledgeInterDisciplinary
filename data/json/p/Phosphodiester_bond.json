{"cursor":"3434","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n molecule {U} (previously mistaken as U for uracil) and two molecules of\n Adenine {A}). ]]\n\nA 'phosphodiester bond' is a group of strong covalent bonds between a\nphosphate group and two 5-carbon ring carbohydrates (pentoses) over two ester\nbonds. Phosphodiester bonds are essential to all known life, as they make up\nthe backbone of each helical strand of DNA. In DNA and RNA, the phosphodiester\nbond is the linkage between the 3' carbon atom of one sugar molecule and the\n5' carbon atom of another; the sugar molecules being deoxyribose in DNA and\nribose in RNA.\n\nThe phosphate groups in the phosphodiester bond are negatively charged. Because\nthe phosphate groups have a pK a near 0, they are negatively charged\nat pH 7. This repulsion forces the phosphates to take opposite sides of the DNA\nstrands and is neutralized by proteins (histones), metal ions such as magnesium,\nand polyamines.\n\nIn order for the phosphodiester bond to be formed and the nucleotides to be\njoined, the tri-phosphate or di-phosphate forms of the nucleotide building-\nblocks are broken apart to give off energy required to drive the enzyme-\ncatalyzed reaction.\n\nHydrolysis of phosphodiester bonds can be catalyzed by the action of\nphosphodiesterases, which play an important role in repairing DNA sequences.\n\nIn biological systems, phosphodiester bonds joining the pentose groups of\nribonucleic acids can be broken through alkaline hydrolysis, in which the 2'\nhydroxyl group acts as a nucleophile in this intramolecular displacement,\nproducing a 2',3'-cyclic monophosphate derivative that, upon further hydrolysis,\nyields a mixture of 2'- and 3'-monophosphates. Deoxyribonucleic acids, lacking a\n2'-OH, are stable under similar (basic) conditions.\n\nPhosphodiester bonds are also found in O-phosphonolipids\n(phospholipids).\n","linknr":144,"url":"Phosphodiester_bond","recorded":1362508132,"links":32,"instances":["molecular_biology","dna"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Organophosphates","Chemical bonding","Molecular biology","Biology and pharmacology of chemical elements"],"headings":["Enzyme activity","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/Phosphodiester_Bond_Diagram.svg/200px-Phosphodiester_Bond_Diagram.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["directionality","molecular_biology"],["directionality","molecular_biology"],["nick","dna"]],"members":["directionality","nick"],"related":["Adenine","Covalent_bond","Phosphate_group","Carbohydrate","Pentose","Ester","DNA","RNA","Directionality_(molecular_biology)","Directionality_(molecular_biology)","Deoxyribose","Ribose","Acid_dissociation_constant","Histones","Polyamine","Nucleotide","Enzyme","Phosphodiesterase","Ribonucleic_acid","Alkaline_hydrolysis","Hydroxyl","Nucleophile","Phospholipids","Phosphodiesterase","Phosphodiesterase_inhibitor","DNA_replication","DNA","Adenosine_triphosphate","Teichoic_acid","DNase_I","PDE5","Nick_(DNA)"]}
