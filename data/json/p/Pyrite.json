This mineral's metallic luster and pale brass-yellow hue have\nearned it the nickname 'fool's gold' because of its superficial resemblance to\ngold. The color has also led to the nicknames 'brass', 'brazzle' and 'Brazil',\nprimarily used to refer to pyrite found in coal. Julia A. Jackson, James\nMehl and Klaus Neuendorf, [http://books.google.com/books?id=SfnSesBc-\nRgC&lpg=PA82&pg=PA82 Glossary of Geology], American Geological Institute (2005)\np. 82. Albert H.

The name pyrite is derived\nfrom the Greek ÏÏÏÎ¯ÏÎ·Ï (puritÄs), \"of fire\" or \"in fire\", [http://www.perse-\nus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dpuri%2Fths1\nÏÏÏÎ¯ÏÎ·Ï], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on\nPerseus in turn from ÏÏÏ (pur), \"fire\".

James Dwight Dana, Edward Salisbury Dana,\n[http://books.google.com/books?id=lHS7AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA86 Descriptive Mineralogy,\n6th Ed.], Wiley, New York (1911) p. 86. By Georgius Agricola's time, the\nterm had become a generic term for all of the sulfide minerals. Herbert\nClark Hoover and Lou Henry Hoover, translators of Georgius Agricola, [De Re\nMetallica], The Mining Magazine, London (1912; Dover reprint, 1950); see\nfootnote, p. 112.\n\nPyrite is usually found associated with other sulfides or oxides in quartz\nveins, sedimentary rock, and metamorphic rock, as well as in coal beds, and as a\nreplacement mineral in fossils. Despite being nicknamed fool's gold, pyrite is\nsometimes found in association with small quantities of gold. Gold and arsenic\noccur as a coupled substitution in the pyrite structure. In the Carlinâtype gold\ndeposits, arsenian pyrite contains up to 0.37 wt% gold. M. E.
