{"cursor":"5840","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n{{infobox record label\n | name = Portrait Records image_name = Portrait logo.png image_size = parent =\n | Sony Music Entertainment founded = 1976 status = Active distributor = Sony\n | Masterworks genre = Classical music country = USA\n}}\n\n'Portrait Records' was a sister label of Epic Records and later of Columbia\nRecords. Cyndi Lauper and Sade signed with Portrait, but their contracts were\nabsorbed by Epic after that incarnation of the label was shuttered.\n\nPortrait began in 1976 as a sister label of Epic; its initial signings were Joan\nBaez, Burton Cummings, and the McCrarys. Cummings' \"Stand Tall\" was the lead-off\nsingle. Baez's [[Blowin' Away]] album and the McCrarys' self-titled debut bowed\nin early 1977. The label design was similar to that of Columbia's singles;\ndesign on it was in grey tones, while the logo was handwritten orange with a red\noutline. This was also the launch of Epic/Portrait/Associated (EPA) under the\nCBS moniker.\n\nOne of the signings the label had was the band Heart. The band had been signed\nwith Mushroom Records, but left after a dispute in advertising their [[Dreamboat\nAnnie]] album. The print ads led some fans to think that the sisters Ann and\nNancy Wilson were lesbians. Portrait snatched the group up quickly, releasing\nthe single \"Barracuda\" before [[Little Queen]] was to hit the shelves. The\nMcCrarys also scored big with \"You\".\n\nBy 1979, however, Epic was looking to consolidate some of its low-end producing\nlabels and, for a short time, Portrait and Epic had both names on the same\nlabel. In 1980, only Heart was picked up from Portrait, which then took a three-\nyear hiatus.\n\nBaez left the label after the release of her 1979 [[Honest Lullaby]] album; she\nlater admitted in her 1987 memoir, And a Voice to Sing With, that she regretted\nsigning with the label, describing her having left her previous label (A&M) for\nPortrait as \"the stupidest career move I ever made\".\n\nIn 1982, the label was relaunched again tapping into the New Wave scene and\nother music not gaining any airplay. It signed artists such as Altered Images,\nAldo Nova, Accept, Arc Angel, Hawaiian Pups, The Elvis Brothers, Eddy Grant,\nOrion the Hunter, The Producers, Saga, and Peter Baumann (formerly of Tangerine\nDream). The label was completely black but the red logo stayed intact. Portrait\nstruck gold again with the signings of Cyndi Lauper and Sade, both in 1983.\nAmericans wouldn't get Sade until a year later. Aldo Nova did make some headway\nwith the songs \"Fantasy\" and \"Monkey on Your Back\" from his [[Subject...Aldo\nNova]] album. Saga also found success with the songs \"On the Loose\" and \"Wind\nHim Up\", which would gain the band gold and platinum albums worldwide. In 1985,\nBritish singer Toyah released her album [[Minx (Toyah album)|Minx]] on the\nPortrait label.\n\nBy the end of 1986, the only act making money on this label was Lauper. Her\nalbum [[True Colors (Cyndi Lauper album)|True Colors]] went platinum, but it\nwasn't enough to keep the label afloat. At the end of 1986, Portrait was\nshuttered again.\n\nIn 1988, the label re-emerged once more but as a contemporary jazz outfit, with\nsignings as diverse as Stanley Clarke, Ornette Coleman, Prime Time and Japanese\nimport T-Square. The logo changed dramatically. This time the label had two: the\nprimary one was a painted P with the word \"portrait\" in a red block, while the\nsecondary one was an outline drawing of a woman. This one was gone by 1990.\n\nEpic did try to make the label work two more times: in 1992, it was trying to do\njazz collections, and in 1999, it was relaunched through Columbia Records as a\nhard-rock/metal label, signing Ratt, Cinderella, Great White, the Union\nUnderground, and Mars Electric. In 2000, Iron Maiden signed with Portrait in\nconjunction with Columbia Records in the US. Finally, after trying so hard to\nkeep it afloat, Portrait dissolved in 2002 after the US release of Iron Maiden's\n[[Rock in Rio (album)|Rock in Rio]] album.\n\nIn late 2012, Sony Masterworks reactivated the label as a classical music\nimprint with its first artist, The Piano Guys on the newly relaunched imprint.\n","linknr":184,"url":"Portrait_Records","recorded":1375085359,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Portrait_Records&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Portrait_Records&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Portrait_Records&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/File:Portrait_logo.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/53/Portrait_logo.png/180px-Portrait_logo.png","/wiki/Sony_Music_Entertainment","/wiki/Sony_Masterworks","/wiki/USA","/wiki/Record_label","/wiki/Epic_Records","/wiki/Columbia_Records","/wiki/Cyndi_Lauper","/wiki/Sade_(band)","/wiki/1976_in_music","/wiki/Joan_Baez","/wiki/Burton_Cummings","/wiki/The_McCrarys","/wiki/Blowin%27_Away","/wiki/Columbia_Records","/wiki/Heart_(band)","/wiki/Mushroom_Records_(Canada)","/wiki/Advertising","/wiki/Dreamboat_Annie","/wiki/Ann_Wilson","/wiki/Nancy_Wilson_(guitarist)","/wiki/Lesbian","/wiki/Barracuda_(song)","/wiki/Little_Queen","/wiki/Honest_Lullaby","/wiki/A%26M_Records","/wiki/New_Wave_music","/wiki/Altered_Images","/wiki/Aldo_Nova","/wiki/Accept_(band)","/wiki/Arc_Angel_(band)","/wiki/Hawaiian_Pups","/wiki/The_Elvis_Brothers","/wiki/Eddy_Grant","/wiki/Orion_the_Hunter_(band)","/wiki/The_Producers_(band)","/wiki/Saga_(band)","/wiki/Peter_Baumann","/wiki/Tangerine_Dream","/wiki/Cyndi_Lauper","/wiki/Sade_(band)","/wiki/Subject...Aldo_Nova","/wiki/Toyah_Willcox","/wiki/Minx_(Toyah_album)","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/wiki/True_Colors_(Cyndi_Lauper_album)","/wiki/Music_recording_sales_certification","/wiki/Jazz","/wiki/Stanley_Clarke","/wiki/Ornette_Coleman","/wiki/Japan","/wiki/T-Square","/wiki/Columbia_Records","/wiki/Ratt","/wiki/Cinderella_(band)","/wiki/Great_White","/wiki/The_Union_Underground","/wiki/Mars_Electric","/wiki/Iron_Maiden","/wiki/Columbia_Records","/wiki/Rock_in_Rio_(album)","/wiki/Sony_Masterworks","/wiki/The_Piano_Guys","#Artists","#Under_Epic","#Under_Columbia","#Under_Sony_Masterworks","#References","#See_also","/w/index.php?title=Portrait_Records&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Portrait_Records&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Burton_Cummings","/wiki/Heart_(band)","/wiki/Cyndi_Lauper","/wiki/Eddy_Grant","/wiki/Sade_(band)","/wiki/Joan_Baez","#cite_note-Joan_Baez_.27And_a_Voice_to_Sing_With:_A_Memoir.27-1","/wiki/Toyah_Willcox","#cite_note-2","/w/index.php?title=Portrait_Records&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/Cinderella_(band)","/wiki/Great_White_(band)","/wiki/Ratt","/w/index.php?title=Portrait_Records&action=edit&section=4","/wiki/The_Piano_Guys","/w/index.php?title=Portrait_Records&action=edit&section=5","#cite_ref-Joan_Baez_.27And_a_Voice_to_Sing_With:_A_Memoir.27_1-0","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0-7126-1827-9","#cite_ref-2","http://www.discogs.com/Toyah-Minx/master/105190","/w/index.php?title=Portrait_Records&action=edit&section=6","/wiki/List_of_record_labels","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Portrait_Records&oldid=565417076","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:American_record_labels","/wiki/Category:Record_labels_established_in_1976","/wiki/Category:Record_labels_disestablished_in_2002","/wiki/Category:Rock_record_labels","/wiki/Category:Pop_record_labels","/wiki/Category:Columbia_Records","/wiki/Category:Epic_Records","/wiki/Category:1976_establishments_in_the_United_States","/wiki/Category:Articles_lacking_sources_from_December_2009","/wiki/Category:All_articles_lacking_sources","/wiki/Category:All_articles_with_unsourced_statements","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_unsourced_statements_from_November_2012","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Portrait+Records&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Portrait+Records","/wiki/Portrait_Records","/wiki/Talk:Portrait_Records","#","/wiki/Portrait_Records","/w/index.php?title=Portrait_Records&action=edit","/w/index.p
