With that year's Act of\nUnion, the Kingdom of Scotland and the Kingdom of England were combined into the\nKingdom of Great Britain, and a new Peerage of Great Britain was introduced in\nwhich subsequent titles were granted.\n\nAfter the Union, the old Scottish Peers elected 16 representative peers to sit\nin the House of Lords. The Peerage Act 1963 allowed all Scottish Peers to sit in\nthe House of Lords, a right which was lost along with all other hereditary peers\nafter the passage of the House of Lords Act 1999. Unlike most other peerage\ntitles, many Scottish titles can pass through female lines, and in the case of\ndaughters only, these pass to the eldest daughter rather than go into abeyance.\nUnlike other British peerages, Scottish peerages can be inherited by or through\na person who was not legitimate at birth provided that his parents married later. [http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1967/dec/05/legitimation-\nscotland-bill-hl Earl of Dundee quoted in Hansard: LEGITIMATION (SCOTLAND) BILL\n[H.L.]]\n\nThe ranks of the Scottish Peerage are Duke, Marquess, Earl, Viscount, Lord of\nParliament (lord baron). Scottish Viscounts differ from those of the other\nPeerages (of England, Great Britain, Ireland and the United Kingdom) in using of\nin their title, as in 'ViscountofOxfuird'. Though this is the theoretical form,\nmost Viscounts drop the \"of\". The Viscount of Arbuthnott and to a lesser extent\nthe Viscount of Oxfuird still actively use of. Scottish Peers had the right to\nsit in the Parliament of Scotland.\n\nScottish Barons rank below Lords of Parliament, and, while noble, are not\nconventionally considered peerage titles; unlike others, the title can be\nhereditary, bought and sold.\n\nIn the following table of the Peerage of Scotland as it currently stands, each\npeer's highest titles in each of the other Peerages (if any) are also listed.\n","linknr":445,"url":"Peerage_of_Scotland","recorded":1375075886,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Peerage_of_Scotland&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Peerage_of_Scotland&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Peerage_of_Scotland&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Template:Citation_needed","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/Category:Peerage","/wiki/Peerage","/wiki/File:Ermine_Robe_(Heraldry).svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/40/Ermine_Robe_%28Heraldry%29.svg/90px-Ermine_Robe_%28Heraldry%29.svg.png","/wiki/Duke","/wiki/Duke","/wiki/Marquess","/wiki/Marquess","/wiki/Earl","/wiki/Earl","/wiki/Viscount","/wiki/Viscount","/wiki/Baron","/wiki/Baron","/wiki/Hereditary_peers","/wiki/Life_peers","/wiki/Representative_peer","/wiki/Peerage_of_England","/wiki/Peerage_of_Ireland","/wiki/Peerage_of_Great_Britain","/wiki/Peerage_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/History_of_the_Peerage","/wiki/Privilege_of_Peerage","/wiki/House_of_Lords","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/Royal_Coat_of_Arms_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg/16px-Royal_Coat_of_Arms_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png","/wiki/Portal:British_politics","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/ae/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg/16px-Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png","/wiki/Portal:United_Kingdom","/wiki/Template:Peerage","/wiki/Template_talk:Peerage","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Peerage&action=edit","/wiki/Scottish_Gaelic_language","/wiki/Scots_language","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/wiki/Peerage","/wiki/Kingdom_of_Scotland","/wiki/Act_of_Union_1707","/wiki/Kingdom_of_England","/wiki/Kingdom_of_Great_Britain","/wiki/Peerage_of_Great_Britain","/wiki/Representative_peer","/wiki/House_of_Lords","/wiki/Peerage_Act_1963","/wiki/House_of_Lords_Act_1999","/wiki/Abeyance","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Duke","/wiki/Marquess","/wiki/Earl","/wiki/Viscount","/wiki/Lord_of_Parliament","/wiki/Parliament_of_Scotland","/wiki/Scottish_Barony#Scotland","#Dukes_in_the_Peerage_of_Scotland","#Marquesses_in_the_Peerage_of_Scotland","#Earls_and_Countesses_in_the_Peerage_of_Scotland","#Viscounts_in_the_Peerage_of_Scotland","#Lords_of_Parliament_and_Ladies_in_the_Peerage_of_Scotland","#See_also","#References","/w/index.php?title=Peerage_of_Scotland&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Duke_of_Rothesay","/wiki/Prince_of_Wales","/wiki/Duke_of_Cornwall","/wiki/Duke_of_Hamilton","/wiki/Duke_of_Brandon","/wiki/Duke_of_Buccleuch","/wiki/Duke_of_Queensberry","/wiki/Earl_of_Doncaster","/wiki/Duke_of_Lennox","/wiki/Duke_of_Richmond","/wiki/Duke_of_Gordon","/wiki/Duke_of_Argyll","/wiki/Baron_Sundridge","/wiki/Baron_Hamilton_of_Hameldon","/wiki/Duke_of_Argyll","/wiki/Duke_of_Atholl","/wiki/Duke_of_Montrose","/wiki/Duke_of_Roxburghe","/wiki/Earl_Innes","/w/index.php?title=Peerage_of_Scotland&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Marquess_of_Huntly","/wiki/Baron_Meldrum","/wiki/Marquess_of_Queensberry","/wiki/Marquess_of_Tweeddale","/wiki/Baron_Tweeddale","/wiki/Marquess_of_Lothian","/wiki/Baron_Ker","/w/index.php?title=Peerage_of_Scotland&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/Earl_of_Sutherland","/wiki/Earl_of_Crawford","/wiki/Earl_of_Balcarres","/wiki/Baron_Wigan","/wiki/Baron_Balniel","/wiki/Earl_of_Mar","/wiki/Earl_of_Erroll","/wiki/Earl_of_Rothes","/wiki/Earl_of_Morton","/wiki/Earl_of_Buchan","/wiki/Baron_Erskine","/wiki/Earl_of_Eglinton","/wiki/Earl_of_Winton","/wiki/Earl_of_Cassilis","/wiki/Marquess_of_Ailsa","/wiki/Earl_of_Caithness","/wiki/Earl_of_Mar","/wiki/Earl_of_Kellie","/wiki/Baron_Erskine_of_Alloa_Tower","/wiki/Earl_of_Moray","/w/index.php?title=Baron_Stuart&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Earl_of_Home","/wiki/Earl_of_Perth","/wiki/Earl_of_Abercorn","/wiki/Duke_of_Abercorn","/wiki/Marquess_of_Abercorn","/wiki/Earl_of_Strathmore_and_Kinghorne","/wiki/Earl_of_Strathmore_and_Kinghorne","/wiki/Earl_of_Haddington","/wiki/Earl_of_Galloway","/wiki/Baron_Stewart","/wiki/Earl_of_Lauderdale","/wiki/Earl_of_Lindsay","/wiki/Earl_of_Loudoun","/wiki/Earl_of_Kinnoull","/w/index.php?title=Bar
