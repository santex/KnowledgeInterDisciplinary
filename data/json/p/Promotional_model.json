A vast majority of\n promotional models typically tend to be attractive in physical appearance. They\n serve to provide information about the product or service and make it appealing\n to consumers. While the length of interaction may be short, the promotional\n model delivers a live experience that reflects on the product or service he or\n she is representing.\n\nThis form of marketing touches fewer consumers for the cost than traditional\nadvertising media (such as print, radio, and television); however the consumer's\nperception of a brand, product, service, or company, is often more profoundly\naffected by a live person-to-person experience. The influence of this type of\nmarketing may be more enduring as well. Promotional models often interact with\nmany people at once to maximize quantitative influence on consumer demand. The\nresponsibilities of the promotional model depend on the particular marketing\ncampaign being carrying out, and may include:\n* increasing product awareness\n* providing product information\n* creating an association in the consumer's mind between the product or brand\n  and a particular idea (natural beauty, classic heritage, edgy sex appeal,\n  reliability)\n* handing items to consumers, such as a sample of the product itself, a small\n  gift, or printed information\n\nMarketing campaigns that make use of promotional models may take place in stores\nor shopping malls, at tradeshows, special promotional events, clubs, or even at\noutdoor public spaces. They are often planned at high traffic locations to reach\nas many consumers as possible, or at venues at which a particular type of target\nconsumer is expected to be present.\n\nChanging social and business standards have resulted in a decrease in the use of\npromotional models in both the construction industry and automobile trade\nshows.\n","linknr":334,"url":"Promotional_model","recorded":1362374833,"links":33,"instances":["person"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Entertainment occupations","Marketing","Modeling","Brand management"],"headings":["Spokesmodel","Trade show model","Convention model","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/CBOSS_girls_%40_3GSM.jpg/220px-CBOSS_girls_%40_3GSM.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/07/GameLady.JPG/220px-GameLady.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fb/GameLady3.JPG/220px-GameLady3.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/Formula_One_LG_Girls_-_2009_Turkish_Grand_Prix.jpg/220px-Formula_One_LG_Girls_-_2009_Turkish_Grand_Prix.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/Top-gear-import-model.JPG/220px-Top-gear-import-model.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/Atam-models-1.JPG/150px-Atam-models-1.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["model","person"],["model","person"]],"members":["model"],"related":["Mobile_World_Congress","Ilsan","South_Korea","Model_(person)","Consumer_demand","Advertising_media","Marketing_campaign","Retailing","Shopping_mall","Tradeshow","Seoul","South_Korea","Model_(person)","Brand","Advertisement","Brand_ambassador","Marlboro_Man","Freelancer","Race_queen","Colloquial","Paddock_girls","Video_game_industry","PAX","PAX_East","Eurogamer_Expo","Eurogamer","Kotaku","Electronic_Entertainment_Expo","Brand_ambassador","Celebrity_endorser","Race_queen","Clarion_Girl","Ring_girl","Pseudo-model"]}
