Schulz, which ran from October 2, 1950, to February\n13, 2000, continuing in reruns afterward. The strip is the most popular and\ninfluential in the history of the comic strip, with 17,897 strips published in\nall,<ref name=Bethune>\"The man who recalled everything,\" Macleans, October 22,\n2007.</ref> making it \"arguably the longest story ever told by one human being\",\naccording to Robert Thompson of Syracuse University. At its peak, Peanuts ran in\nover 2,600 newspapers, with a readership of 355 million in 75 countries, and was\ntranslated into 21 languages.<ref>\"Saying Goodbye: Friends and family eulogize\ncartoonist Charles Schulz\" February 22, 2000 Pamela J.

The holiday\nspecials remain popular and are currently broadcast on ABC in the United States\nduring the corresponding seasons. The Peanuts franchise met acclaim in theatre,\nwith the stage musical [[You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown]] being a successful\nand often-performed production.\n\nPeanuts has been described as \"the most shining example of the American success\nstory in the comic strip field\"; this is ironic, given its theme is \"the great\nAmerican unsuccess story.\" The main character, Charlie Brown, is meek, nervous\nand lacks self-confidence. He is unable to fly a kite, win a baseball game or\nkick a football.<ref>The World Encyclopedia of Comics, edited by Maurice Horn,\npublished in 1977 by Avon Books</ref>\n",
