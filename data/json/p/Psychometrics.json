The field is\nprimarily concerned with the construction and validation of measurement\ninstruments such as questionnaires, tests, and personality assessments.\n\nIt involves two major research tasks, namely: (i) the construction of\ninstruments and procedures for measurement; and (ii) the development and\nrefinement of theoretical approaches to measurement. Those who practice\npsychometrics are known as psychometricians. All psychometricians possess a\nspecific psychometric qualification, and while many are clinical psychologists,\nothers work as human resources or learning and development professionals.\n","linknr":538,"url":"Psychometrics","recorded":1362480356,"links":57,"instances":["statistics","student_assessment","trait","statistics","statistics","social_sciences","business","politics"],"pdf":["http://psychology.tamu.edu/Faculty/blanton/bj.2006.arbitrary.pdf"],"categories":["Psychometrics|","Applied psychology","Branches of psychology","Educational assessment and evaluation","Educational psychology","Educational research","Psychological testing"],"headings":["Origins and background","Definition of measurement in the social sciences","Instruments and procedures","Theoretical approaches","Standards of quality","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Psi2.svg/40px-Psi2.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Psi2.svg/16px-Psi2.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/Wikiversity-logo.svg/40px-Wikiversity-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["test","student_assessment"],["intelligence","trait"],["intelligence","trait"],["path_analysis","statistics"],["reliability","psychometric"],["validity","statistics"],["validity","statistics"],["reliability","statistics"],["quality","business"],["diversity","politics"],["test","student_assessment"],["scale","social_sciences"]],"members":["reliability","test","intelligence","validity","path_analysis","scale","quality","diversity"],"related":["Psychological","Measurement","Educational_measurement","Questionnaire","Test_(student_assessment)","Human_resources","Learning_and_development","Charles_Darwin","Sir_Francis_Galton","Intelligence_(trait)","Francis_Galton","Anthropometric","Psychophysics","J.E._Herbart","E.H._Weber","L._L._Thurstone","Law_of_comparative_judgment","Ernst_Heinrich_Weber","Gustav_Fechner","Factor_analysis","Leopold_Szondi","Leopold_Szondi","Academic_achievement","Physical_sciences","Karl_Pearson","Henry_F._Kaiser","Carl_Brigham","L._L._Thurstone","Georg_Rasch","Eugene_Galanter","Johnson_O'Connor","Frederic_M._Lord","Ledyard_R_Tucker","Arthur_Jensen","David_Andrich","Stanley_Smith_Stevens","Levels_of_measurement","Covariance_matrix","Rasch_model","Intelligence_(trait)","Stanford-Binet_IQ_test","Alfred_Binet","General_intelligence_factor","Rasch_model","Minnesota_Multiphasic_Personality_Inventory","Big_five_personality_traits","Personality_and_Preference_Inventory","Myers-Briggs_Type_Indicator","Likert_scale","Classical_test_theory","Item_response_theory","Rasch_model","Factor_analysis","Multidimensional_scaling","Data_clustering","Structural_equation_modeling","Path_analysis_(statistics)","Reliability_(psychometric)","Validity_(statistics)","Pearson_product-moment_correlation_coefficient","Spearman–Brown_prediction_formula","Cronbach's_α","Intra-class_correlation","Latent_trait","Validity_(statistics)","Reliability_(statistics)","Quality_(business)","Standards_organization","Justice","Right","Moral_responsibility","Diversity_(politics)","Language","Disability","Psychological_testing","Test_(student_assessment)","Employment","Professional_certification","Program_evaluation","Standardized_testing_and_public_policy","Evaluation","Educational_evaluation","Joint_Committee_on_Standards_for_Educational_Evaluation","Aptitude","Classical_test_theory","Concept_inventory","Cronbach's_alpha","Educational_assessment","Educational_psychology","Historiometry","Item_response_theory","List_of_psychometric_software","Operationalisation","Quantitative_psychology","Rasch_model","Scale_(social_sciences)","School_counselor","School_Psychological_Examiner","School_psychology","Standardized_test"]}
