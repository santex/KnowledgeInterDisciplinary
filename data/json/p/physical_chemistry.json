{"cursor":"13730","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Physical chemistry' is the study of macroscopic, atomic, subatomic, and\nparticulate phenomena in chemical systems in terms of laws and concepts of\nphysics. It applies the principles, practices and concepts of physics such as\nmotion, energy, force, time, thermodynamics, quantum chemistry, statistical\nmechanics and dynamics, equilibrium.\n\nPhysical chemistry, in contrast to chemical physics, is predominantly (but not\nalways) a macroscopic or supra-molecular science, as the majority of the\nprinciples on which physical chemistry was founded, are concepts related to the\nbulk rather than on molecular/atomic structure alone. For example, chemical\nequilibrium, and colloids.\n\nSome of the relationships that physical chemistry strives to resolve include the\neffects of: #Intermolecular forces that act upon the physical properties of\nmaterials (plasticity, tensile strength, surface tension in liquids). #Reaction\nkinetics on the rate of a reaction. #The identity of ions and the electrical\nconductivity of materials. #Surface chemistry and electrochemistry of\nmembranes. #Interaction of one body with another in terms of\nquantities of heat and work called thermodynamics. #Transfer of heat between a\nchemical system and its surroundings during change of phase or chemical reaction\ntaking place called thermochemistry #Study of colligative properties of number\nof species present in solution. #Number of phases, number of components and\ndegree of freedom (or variance) can be correlated with one another with help of\nphase rule. #Reactions of electrochemical cells.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"physical_chemistry","recorded":1363582104,"links":[],"instances":["journal","physics","physics","chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Physical chemistry|*"],"headings":["Key concepts","History","Journals","Branches and related topics","See also","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["motion","physics"],["plasticity","physics"],["product","chemistry"],["molecular_physics","journal"]],"members":["molecular_physics","plasticity","motion","product"],"related":["Physics","Physics","Motion_(physics)","Energy","Force","Time","Thermodynamics","Quantum_chemistry","Statistical_mechanics","Analytical_dynamics","Equilibrium","Chemical_physics","Chemical_equilibrium","Colloids","Intermolecular_forces","Plasticity_(physics)","Tensile_strength","Surface_tension","Liquid","Chemical_kinetics","Reaction_rate","Surface_chemistry","Electrochemistry","Cell_membrane","Heat","Work","Thermodynamics","Phase","Chemical_reaction","Thermochemistry","Colligative_properties","Phase_rule","Electrochemical_cells","Chemical_species","Atoms","Chemical_bond","Chemical_reactions","Atomic_nucleus","Quantum_chemistry","Quantum_mechanics","Spectroscopy","Electromagnetic_radiation","Chemical_thermodynamics","Combustion_engine","Thermal_expansion_coefficient","Entropy","Pressure","Gas","Liquid","Quasi-equilibrium","Non-equilibrium_thermodynamics","Thermodynamic_equilibrium","Reversible_process","Chemical_kinetics","Reagent","Product_(chemistry)","Transition_state","Thermodynamic_free_energy","Elementary_reaction","Catalysts","Avogadro_constant","Statistical_mechanics","Mikhail_Lomonosov","Petersburg_University","Chemical_thermodynamics","Electrolyte","Chemical_kinetics","Josiah_Willard_Gibbs","Gibbs_free_energy","Chemical_potential","Gibbs_phase_rule","On_the_Equilibrium_of_Heterogeneous_Substances","Enthalpy","Heike_Kamerlingh_Onnes","Macromolecular","Scientific_journal","Wilhelm_Ostwald","Jacobus_Henricus_van_'t_Hoff","Svante_August_Arrhenius","Nobel_Prize_in_Chemistry","Statistical_mechanics","Colloid","Surface_chemistry","Irving_Langmuir","Quantum_mechanics","Quantum_chemistry","Linus_Pauling","Spectroscopy","Infrared_spectroscopy","Microwave_spectroscopy","EPR_spectroscopy","NMR_spectroscopy","Nuclear_chemistry","Astrochemistry","Group_contribution_method","Lydersen_method","Joback_method","Benson_group_increment_theory","QSPR","QSAR","Zeitschrift_f√ºr_Physikalische_Chemie","Journal_of_Physical_Chemistry_A","Physical_Chemistry_Chemical_Physics","Faraday_Transactions","Macromolecular_Chemistry_and_Physics","Annual_Review_of_Physical_Chemistry","Molecular_Physics_(journal)","Journal_of_Physical_Organic_Chemistry","Journal_of_Physical_Chemistry_B","ChemPhysChem","Journal_of_Physical_Chemistry_C","Journal_of_Physical_Chemistry_Letters","Annales_de_chimie_et_de_physique","Thermochemistry","Chemical_kinetics","Quantum_chemistry","Electrochemistry","Photochemistry","Surface_chemistry","Solid-state_chemistry","Spectroscopy","Biophysical_chemistry","Materials_science","Physical_organic_chemistry","Micromeritics"]}
