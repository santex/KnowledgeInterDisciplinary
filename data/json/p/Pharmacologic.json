More specifically,\nit is the study of the interactions that occur between a living organism and\nchemicals that affect normal or abnormal biochemical function. If substances\nhave medicinal properties, they are considered pharmaceuticals. The field\nencompasses drug composition and properties, synthesis and drug design,\nmolecular and cellular mechanisms, organ/systems mechanisms, signal\ntransduction/cellular communication, molecular diagnostics, interactions,\ntoxicology, chemical biology, therapy, and medical applications and\nantipathogenic capabilities. The two main areas of pharmacology are\npharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics. The former studies the effects of the\ndrug on biological systems, and the latter the effects of biological systems on\nthe drug. In broad terms, pharmacodynamics discusses the chemicals with\nbiological receptors, and pharmacokinetics discusses the absorption,\ndistribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) of chemicals from the biological\nsystems. Pharmacology is not synonymous with pharmacy and the two terms are\nfrequently confused. Pharmacology, a biomedical science, deals with the\nresearch, discovery, and characterization of chemicals which show biological\neffects and the elucidation of cellular and organismal function in relation to\nthese chemicals. Pharmacology, to many of its practitioners, is bluntly phrased\nas \"Biology with Significance or Purpose\". In contrast, pharmacy, a health\nservices profession, is concerned with application of the principles learned\nfrom pharmacology in its clinical settings; whether it be in a dispensing or\nclinical care role. In either field, the primary contrast between the two are\ntheir distinctions between direct-patient care, for pharmacy practice, and the\nscience-oriented research field, driven by pharmacology.\n\nDioscorides' [[De Materia Medica]] is often said to be the oldest and most\nvaluable work in the history of pharmacology.

ISBN 0-415-28033-8 Pharmacology as a scientific discipline\ndid not further advance until the mid-19th century amid the great biomedical\nresurgence of that period. Before the second half of\nthe nineteenth century, the remarkable potency and specificity of the actions of\ndrugs such as morphine, quinine and digitalis were explained vaguely and with\nreference to extraordinary chemical powers and affinities to certain organs or\ntissues. The first pharmacology department was set up by\nRudolf Buchheim in 1847, in recognition of the need to understand how\ntherapeutic drugs and poisons produced their effects.\n\nEarly pharmacologists focused on natural substances, mainly plant extracts.\nPharmacology developed in the 19th century as a biomedical science that applied\nthe principles of scientific experimentation to therapeutic contexts. Today Pharmacologists harness the power of genetics, molecular\nbiology, chemistry, and other advanced tools to transform information about\nmolecular mechanisms and targets into therapies directed against disease,\ndefects or pathogens, and create methods for preventative care, diagnostics, and\nultimately personalized medicine.\n","linknr":895,"url":"Pharmacologic","recorded":1362508923,"links":79,"instances":["pdma","biochemistry","origins_of_technical_term","digestive","pharmacology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Pharmacology|","Biochemistry"],"headings":["Divisions","Scientific background","Medicine development and safety testing","Drug legislation and safety","Education","See also","Footnotes","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8f/Pharmacologyprism.jpg/220px-Pharmacologyprism.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5f/Tabletten.JPG/32px-Tabletten.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Symbol_book_class2.svg/16px-Symbol_book_class2.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/12px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg/16px-Portal-puzzle.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg/16px-Wikiquote-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["receptor","biochemistry"],["receptor","biochemistry"],["absorption","digestive"],["distribution","pharmacology"],["prescription_drug_marketing_act","pdma"],["placebo","origins_of_technical_term"],["prescription_drug_marketing_act","pdma"]],"members":["prescription_drug_marketing_act","receptor","placebo","absorption","distribution"],"related":["Metabolism","Ancient_Greek","Biology","Drug","Medication","Pharmaceutical_drug","Drug","Drug_interaction","Toxicology","Chemical_biology","Pharmacodynamics","Pharmacokinetics","Pharmacodynamics","Receptor_(biochemistry)","Pharmacokinetics","Pharmacy","Pharmacy","Pedanius_Dioscorides","CRC_Press","Clinical_pharmacology","Middle_Ages","Avicenna","Peter_of_Spain","William_Withering","CRC_Press","Morphine","Quinine","Digitalis","Rudolf_Buchheim","Gene–environment_interaction","Environmental_science","Medicine","Environmental_damage","Environmental_remediation","Aquatic_ecosystem","Illegal_drugs","Carcinogens","Biodegradability","Cell_biology","Biochemistry","Receptor_(biochemistry)","Metabolic_pathway","Pharmacokinetics","Half-life","Volume_of_distribution","Pharmacodynamics","Toxic","Absorption_(digestive)","Human_skin","Intestine","Oral_mucosa","Distribution_(pharmacology)","Drug_metabolism","Excretion","Therapeutic_drug_monitoring","Warfarin","Antiepileptic","Aminoglycoside","Antibiotics","Cancer","Tumor","Drug_development","Medicine","Economical","Political","Consumer","United_States","Food_and_Drug_Administration","Technical_standard","United_States_Pharmacopoeia","European_Union","Body","European_Medicines_Agency","European_Pharmacopoeia","United_States","Food_and_Drug_Administration","Therapeutic_effect","Prescription_Drug_Marketing_Act_(PDMA)","Medicines_and_Healthcare_products_Regulatory_Agency","Certain_safety_factor","Cosmeceuticals","Crude_drugs","Nicholas_Culpeper","Drug_design","Drug_Discovery_Hit_to_Lead","Drug_metabolism","Enzyme_inhibitor","Herbalism","History_of_pharmacy","International_Union_of_Basic_and_Clinical_Pharmacology","Inverse_benefit_law","List_of_abbreviations_used_in_medical_prescriptions","List_of_pharmaceutical_companies","List_of_withdrawn_drugs","Medical_School","Medicare_Part_D","Medication","Medicinal_chemistry","Neuropharmacology","Neuropsychopharmacology","Pharmaceutical_company","Pharmaceutical_formulation","Pharmaceuticals_and_personal_care_products_in_the_environment","Pharmacognosy","Pharmacopoeia","Pharmacotherapy","Pharmakeia","Pharmakos","Placebo_(origins_of_technical_term)","Prescription_drug","Prescription_Drug_Marketing_Act_(PDMA)","Psychopharmacology","Traditional_Chinese_Medicine"]}
