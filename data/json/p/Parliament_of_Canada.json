Formally, the body\nconsists of the Canadian monarchârepresented by a viceroy, the governor\ngeneralâthe Senate, and the House of Commons, each element having its own\nofficers and organization. The governor general summons and appoints each of the\n105 members of the upper house on the advice of the Prime Minister of Canada,\nwhile the 308 members of the lower house are directly elected by eligible voters\nin the Canadian populace, with each Member of Parliament representing a single\nelectoral district, commonly referred to as a riding.\n\nBy constitutional convention, the House of Commons is the dominant branch of\nparliament, the Senate and Crown rarely opposing its will. The Senate thus\nreviews legislation from a less partisan standpoint, and the monarch and viceroy\nprovide the necessary Royal Assent to make bills into law and summon, prorogue,\nand dissolve parliament in order to call an election, as well as reading the\nThrone Speech. The current parliament, summoned by Governor General David\nJohnston on 2 June 2011, is the 41st since Confederation.\n","linknr":1081,"url":"Parliament_of_Canada","recorded":1362559995,"links":70,"instances":["heraldry","canada","canada","politics","canada","canada","canada","government","canada","canada","1763","parliamentary_procedure","canada","proposed_law","constitutional"],"pdf":["http://www.pch.gc.ca/pgm/ceem-cced/fr-rf/crnCdn/crn_mpls-eng.pdf","http://www.pch.gc.ca/pgm/ceem-cced/fr-rf/crnCdn/crn_mpls-eng.pdf","http://www2.parl.gc.ca/Sites/LOP/Infoparl/2/4/02n4_79e.pdf","http://www2.parl.gc.ca/Sites/LOP/Infoparl/2/4/02n4_79e.pdf","http://www.gazette.gc.ca/rp-pr/p1/2008/2008-01-12/pdf/g1-14202.pdf","http://www.gazette.gc.ca/rp-pr/p1/2008/2008-01-12/pdf/g1-14202.pdf"],"categories":["1867
