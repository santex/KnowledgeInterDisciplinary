{"cursor":"11173","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Precipitation hardening', also called 'age hardening', is a heat treatment\ntechnique used to increase the yield strength of malleable materials, including\nmost structural alloys of aluminium, magnesium, nickel, titanium, and some\nstainless steels. In superalloys, it is known to cause yield strength anomaly\nproviding excellent high temperature strength.\n\nPrecipitation hardening relies on changes in solid solubility with temperature\nto produce fine particles of an impurity phase, which impede the movement of\ndislocations, or defects in a crystal's lattice. Since dislocations are often\nthe dominant carriers of plasticity, this serves to harden the material. The\nimpurities play the same role as the particle substances in particle-reinforced\ncomposite materials. Just as the formation of ice in air can produce clouds,\nsnow, or hail, depending upon the thermal history of a given portion of the\natmosphere, precipitation in solids can produce many different sizes of\nparticles, which have radically different properties. Unlike ordinary tempering,\nalloys must be kept at elevated temperature for hours to allow precipitation to\ntake place. This time delay is called 'aging'. Solution treatment and aging is\nsometimes abbreviated \"STA\" in metals specs and certs.\n\nNote that two different heat treatments involving precipitates can alter the\nstrength of a material: solution heat treating and precipitation heat treating.\nSolid solution strengthening involves formation of a single-phase solid solution\nvia quenching. Precipitation heat treating involves the addition of impurity\nparticles to increase a material's strength. W.D. Callister.\nFundamentals of Materials Science and Engineering, 2nd ed. Wiley & Sons. pp.\n252. Precipitation hardening via precipitation heat treatment is the main\ntopic of discussion in this article.\n","linknr":185,"url":"Precipitation_hardening","recorded":1362672854,"links":24,"instances":["matter","metallurgy","physics","chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Strengthening mechanisms of materials","Metal heat treatments"],"headings":["Kinetics versus thermodynamics","Alloy design","Theory","Governing Equations","Some precipitation hardening materials","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/f/7/ff724c3e29777f6e3db74b7f3a9e27f0.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/6/3/4/6347e3052b9a766294498017955bd25e.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/e/6/5e6ffd4189678b2ac78159a49652811d.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/d/5/0/d505ea53bf6629d335a4d8f2033f55ab.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/1/a/81a69207104f00baaabd6f84cafd15a0.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/b/4/4b43b0aee35624cd95b910189b3dc231.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/3/3/4/334de1ea38b615839e4ee6b65ee1b103.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/9/2/e/92eb5ffee6ae2fec3ad71c777531578f.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/d/2/0/d20caec3b48a1eef164cb4ca81ba2587.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/b/4/4b43b0aee35624cd95b910189b3dc231.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/d/2/5/d2591efe5f24c584a5808629282bfcab.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/1/a/81a69207104f00baaabd6f84cafd15a0.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/d/f/c/dfcf28d0734569a6a693bc8194de62bf.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/9/2/e/92eb5ffee6ae2fec3ad71c777531578f.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/d/2/0/d20caec3b48a1eef164cb4ca81ba2587.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/b/4/4b43b0aee35624cd95b910189b3dc231.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b9/Strengthening_new.svg/281px-Strengthening_new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["phase","matter"],["plasticity","physics"],["precipitation","chemistry"],["annealing","metallurgy"]],"members":["phase","annealing","plasticity","precipitation"],"related":["Heat_treatment","Malleable","Aluminium","Magnesium","Nickel","Titanium","Stainless_steel","Superalloys","Yield_strength_anomaly","Solubility","Temperature","Phase_(matter)","Dislocation","Crystal","Crystal_structure","Plasticity_(physics)","Precipitation_(chemistry)","Tempering","Specification","Product_certification","Solid_solution_strengthening","Supersaturation","Nucleation","Chemical_kinetics","Surface_energy","Solubility_equilibrium","Thermodynamics","Diffusion","Phase_diagram","Annealing_(metallurgy)","Copper","Vanadium","Grain_refinement","Corrosion","Rivets","Dry_ice","Burgers_vector","2024_aluminium_alloy","Y_alloy","Hiduminium","6061_aluminium_alloy","7075_aluminium_alloy","Unified_numbering_system","Maraging_steel","Inconel","Ren√©_41","Waspaloy","Alfred_Wilm","Strength_of_Materials","Strengthening_mechanisms_of_materials","Metallurgy","Superalloy"]}
