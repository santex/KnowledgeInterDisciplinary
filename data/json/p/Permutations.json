{"cursor":"47959","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nIn mathematics, the notion of 'permutation' is used with several slightly\ndifferent meanings, all related to the act of 'permuting' (rearranging) objects\nor values. Informally, a permutation of a set of objects is an arrangement of\nthose objects into a particular order. For example, there are six permutations\nof the set {1,2,3}, namely (1,2,3), (1,3,2), (2,1,3), (2,3,1), (3,1,2), and\n(3,2,1). One might define an anagram of a word as a permutation of its letters.\nThe study of permutations in this sense generally belongs to the field of\ncombinatorics.\n\nThe number of permutations of n distinct objects is , which is commonly denoted\nas \"n factorial\" and written \"n!\".\n\nPermutations occur, in more or less prominent ways, in almost every domain of\nmathematics. They often arise when different orderings on certain finite sets\nare considered, possibly only because one wants to ignore such orderings and\nneeds to know how many configurations are thus identified. For similar reasons\npermutations arise in the study of sorting algorithms in computer science.\n\nIn algebra and particularly in group theory, a permutation of a set S is defined\nas a bijection from S to itself (i.e., a map for which every element of S occurs\nexactly once as image value). This is related to the rearrangement of S in which\neach element s takes the place of the corresponding f(s). The collection of such\npermutations form a symmetric group. The key to its structure is the possibility\nto compose permutations: performing two given rearrangements in succession\ndefines a third rearrangement, the composition. Permutations may ''act'' on\ncomposite objects by rearranging their components, or by certain replacements\n(substitutions) of symbols.\n\nIn elementary combinatorics, the name \"permutations and combinations\" often\nrefers to two related problems, both counting possibilities to select k distinct\nelements from a set of n elements, where for k-permutations the order of\nselection is taken into account, but for k-combinations it is ignored. However\nk-permutations (also known as partial permutations) do not correspond to\npermutations as discussed in this article (unless k = n).\n","linknr":418,"url":"Permutations","recorded":1362898693,"links":68,"instances":["mathematics","mathematics","mathematics","mathematics","group_theory","symmetric_group","computer_science","mathematics","mathematics","mathematics","algebra","combinatorics","permutation","mathematics","number_theory","mathematics"],"pdf":["http://h20331.www2.hp.com/Hpsub/downloads/50gProbability-Rearranging_items.pdf"],"categories":["Abstract
