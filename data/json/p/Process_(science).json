Therefore, all\nsciences analyze and model processes.\n\nProcesses are always properties of dynamic systems; they are characterized by\nsuch system attributes as variables and parameters. Every process model has\ndistinguished input and output variables, and it can be autonomous or\ncontrolled.\n\nThe recognition of a process is an arbitrary subjective mental operation/event\nbecause it depends on different circumstances: the observer's goal, perception\nand conceptualization tools.\n\nThere are numerous taxonomies of processes, and, roughly speaking, they are\ndivided into: continuous and discrete, stable and not stable, convergent or not\nconvergent, cyclic and not cyclic, linear and not linear. They are grouped\naccording to the name of the domain in which they are analyzed.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Process_(science)","recorded":1362478001,"links":0,"instances":["mathematics","biology","biology","physics","abstract","biology","goal","physics","biochemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Systems theory"],"headings":["Some examples of physical, technological and biological processes","See also"],"image":[],"tags":[["variable","mathematics"],["model","abstract"],["objective","goal"],["reflection","physics"],["sublimation","physics"],["fermentation","biochemistry"],["human_development","biology"],["hybrid","biology"],["metamorphosis","biology"]],"members":["variable","human_development","metamorphosis","sublimation","model","hybrid","objective","reflection","fermentation"],"related":["Science","Scientific_method","System","Variable_(mathematics)","Parameter","Model_(abstract)","Output","Autonomous","Scientific_control","Objective_(goal)","Perception","Taxonomy","Combustion","Crystallization","Centrifugation","Diffraction","Diffusion","Dispersion","Distillation","Electrolysis","Electrophoresis","Emulsification","Evaporation","Hydrolysis","Nuclear_fission","Nuclear_fusion","Oxidation","Phosphorescence","Pyrolysis","Redox","Reflection_(physics)","Refraction","Scattering","Sedimentation","Sublimation_(physics)","Childbirth","Cell_division","Fermentation_(biochemistry)","Fertilization","Germination","Human_development_(biology)","Geotropism","Heliotropism","Hybrid_(biology)","Metamorphosis_(biology)","Photosynthesis","Transpiration","Stochastic_process","Cognitive_process","Mental_process","Process_group","Process_modeling","Process_ontology"]}
