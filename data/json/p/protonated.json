Some ions and molecules can undergo more\nthan one protonation and are labeled polybasic, which is true of many biological\nmacromolecules. Protonation and deprotonation occur in most acid-base reactions;\nthey are the core of most acid-base reaction theories. A Bronsted-Lowry acid is\ndefined as a chemical substance that protonates another substance. Upon\nprotonating a substrate, the mass and the charge of the species each increase by\none unit. Protonating or deprotonating a molecule or ion alters many chemical\nproperties beyond the change in the charge and mass: hydrophilicity, reduction\npotential, optical properties, among others. Protonation is also an essential\nstep in certain analytical procedures such as electrospray mass spectrometry.\n","linknr":129,"url":"protonated","recorded":1362566007,"links":26,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Chemical reactions","Reaction mechanisms"],"headings":["Rates of protonation and deprotonation","Reversibility and catalysis","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/math/d/3/8/d389ed20d91e6a626c020fe97f54dd8a.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/d/b/fdbb9761d702151b72224985303c59f7.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/1/c/9/1c9a9639ca0091da92c1781b7120c034.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/7/d/47da5e461dee120b8a05f5f0bb652735.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Atom","Molecule","Ion","Water","Sulfuric_acid","Isobutene","Carbocation","Ammonia","Ammonium_chloride","Hydrogen_chloride","Stoichiometry","Catalysis","Macromolecule","Acid-base_reaction","Brønsted-Lowry_acid-base_theory","Chemical_substance","Hydrophile","Reduction_potential","Ultraviolet-visible_spectroscopy","Mass_spectrometry","Reaction_rate","Isomerization","Alkene","Serine_hydrolase","Deprotonation","Molecular_autoionization","Acid_dissociation_constant"]}
