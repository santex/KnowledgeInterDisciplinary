{"cursor":"5395","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Perdigon' or 'Perdigo' (fl. 1190–1212 Aubrey,\n18. ) was a troubadour from LespÃ©ron LespÃ©ron, a small town, is\nidentified with the canton of Coucouron, LargentiÃ¨re, ArdÃ¨che. in the\nGabales, diocese of GÃ©vaudan, modern LozÃ¨re. Egan, 83.\nFourteen of his works survive, including three [[Canso (song)|cansos]] with\nmelodies. Aubrey, 19. He was respected and admired by\ncontemporaries, judging by the widespread inclusion of his work in chansonniers\nand in citations by other troubadours.\n\nThough his biography is made confounding by contradicting statements in his\n[[Vida (Occitan literary form)|vida]] and allusions in his and others' poems,\nPerdigon's status as a jongleur from youth and an accomplished fiddler is well-\nattested in contemporary works (by him and others) and manuscript illustrations\ndepicting him with his fiddle. Perdigon travelled widely\nand was patronised by Dalfi d'Alvernha, the Baux, Probably Guillem des Baux\n(Aubrey, 218). Peter II of Aragon, and Barral of Marseille. His service to the latter provides an early definite date for\nhis career, as Barral died in 1192 and Perdigon composed a canso—which\nsurvives with music—for him.\n\nAccording to his vida, Perdigon was the son of a poor fisherman who excelled\nthrough his \"wit and inventiveness\" to honour and fame, be clothed and\neventually armed, knighted, and granted land and rent by Dalfi d'Alvernha. After this period of his life, which is said to have lasted a\nlong time, the manuscripts of his vida diverge. According to one version, death\ndeprived him of his friends, male and female, and so he lost his position and\nentered a Cistercian monastery, where he died. That he entered a Cistercian monastery has received some\nsupport from two of his more sombre works.\n\n\n\nAccording to another version of his vida, he became a strong opponent of\nCatharism and supported the Albigensian Crusade. He is\nsaid to have accompanied Guillem des Baux, Folquet de Marselha, and the Abbot of\nCÃ®teaux to Rome to oppose Raymond VI of Toulouse after the latter's\nexcommunication in 1208. The author of the vida blames Perdigon for \"[bringing]\nabout and [arranging] all these deeds.\" Egan, 84. The\nbiographer further claims that Perdigon sang to the populace to encourage the\nCrusade and even boasted of humiliating Peter II of Aragon—a former patron\n\"who had clothed him\"—who died at the Battle of Muret.\nFor this reason he became despised and lost all his friends in the war: Simon de\nMontfort, Guillem des Baux, This personage was the Prince of Orange, but it\nwas probably a similarly named Uc des Baux with whom Perdigon was acquainted\n(Egan, 84). and many others. In the end his suzerain,\nDalfi d'Alvernha, abandoned him, confiscated his land, and sent him away. The\nbiographer claims that he went to Lambert de Monteil and begged to be entered\ninto the Cistercian monastery of \"Silvabela\", but the author incorrectly\nbelieves Lambert to be the son-in-law of Guillem des Baux and the monastery\nSilvabela (\"beautiful forest\") never existed. He died in the\nmonastery.\n\nAmong Perdigon's surviving songs is a [[torneyamen]] with Raimbaut de Vaqueiras\nand Ademar de Peiteus. Aubrey, 231. Unusually for the period,\nPerdigon, along with Aimeric de Peguilhan, through-composed his\nmelodies. Aubrey, 169.\n\nA recently published book,The Life, Poetry, and Music of the ProvenÃ§al\nTroubadour Perdigon (NY: Mellen Press, 2013) written by Luisa Marina PerdigÃ³,\nprovides annotated translations of the troubadour's cansos from the ProvenÃ§al\ninto English and Spanish, studies his poems and melodies in-depth, establishes\nPerdigon as an important influence in other European writers of the period, and\ndiscusses his vidas.\n","linknr":171,"url":"Perdigon","recorded":1375077343,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Perdigon&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Perdigon&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:BnF_ms._854_fol._49_-_Perdigon_(1).jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5d/BnF_ms._854_fol._49_-_Perdigon_%281%29.jpg/170px-BnF_ms._854_fol._49_-_Perdigon_%281%29.jpg","/wiki/File:BnF_ms._854_fol._49_-_Perdigon_(1).jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf8/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Floruit","#cite_note-Aubrey18-2","/wiki/Troubadour","#cite_note-3","/w/index.php?title=Diocese_of_G%C3%A9vaudan&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Loz%C3%A8re","#cite_note-Egan83-4","/wiki/Canso_(song)","#cite_note-Aubrey19-5","/wiki/Chansonnier","#cite_note-Aubrey19-5","/wiki/Vida_(Occitan_literary_form)","/wiki/Jongleur","#cite_note-Aubrey18-2","/wiki/Dalfi_d%27Alvernha","/wiki/Baux","#cite_note-6","/wiki/Peter_II_of_Aragon","/wiki/Barral_of_Marseille","#cite_note-Aubrey18-2","#cite_note-Aubrey18-2","#cite_note-Egan83-4","/wiki/Cistercian","#cite_note-Egan83-4","#cite_note-Aubrey19-5","#cite_note-Egan83-4","/wiki/File:BnF_ms._12473_fol._36_-_Perdigon_(1).jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/BnF_ms._12473_fol._36_-_Perdigon_%281%29.jpg/170px-BnF_ms._12473_fol._36_-_Perdigon_%281%29.jpg","/wiki/File:BnF_ms._12473_fol._36_-_Perdigon_(1).jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf8/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Catharism","/wiki/Albigensian_Crusade","#cite_note-Aubrey19-5","/wiki/Guillem_des_Baux","/wiki/Folquet_de_Marselha","/wiki/Abbot_of_C%C3%AEteaux","/wiki/Rome","/wiki/Raymond_VI_of_Toulouse","#cite_note-Egan84-7","/wiki/Peter_II_of_Aragon","/wiki/Battle_of_Muret","#cite_note-Egan84-7","/wiki/Simon_de_Montfort,_5th_Earl_of_Leicester","#cite_note-8","#cite_note-Egan84-7","#cite_note-Egan84-7","/wiki/Torneyamen","/wiki/Raimbaut_de_Vaqueiras","/wiki/Ademar_de_Peiteus","#cite_note-9","/wiki/Aimeric_de_Peguilhan","/wiki/Through-composed","#cite_note-10","/w/index.php?title=Luisa_Marina_Perdig%C3%B3&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Perdigon&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0253213894","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0824094379","/w/index.php?title=Perdigon&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-1","#cite_ref-Aubrey18_2-0","#cite_ref-Aubrey18_2-1","#cite_ref-Aubrey18_2-2","#cite_ref-Aubrey18_2-3","#cite_ref-3","/wiki/Coucouron","/wiki/Largenti%C3%A8re","/wiki/Ard%C3%A8che","#cite_ref-Egan83_4-0","#cite_ref-Egan83_4-1","#cite_ref-Egan83_4-2","#cite_ref-Egan83_4-3","#cite_ref-Aubrey19_5-0","#cite_ref-Aubrey19_5-1","#cite_ref-Aubrey19_5-2","#cite_ref-Aubrey19_5-3","#cite_ref-6","#cite_ref-Egan84_7-0","#cite_ref-Egan84_7-1","#cite_ref-Egan84_7-2","#cite_ref-Egan84_7-3","#cite_ref-8","/wiki/Prince_of_Orange","/w/index.php?title=Uc_des_Baux&action=edit&redlink=1","#cite_ref-9","#cite_ref-10","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Perdigon&oldid=560046032","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Troubadours","/wiki/Category:Medieval_poets","/wiki/Category:Occitan_poets","/wiki/Category:Cistercians","/wiki/Category:People_of_the_Albigensian_Crusade","/wiki/Category:12th-century_births","/wiki/Category:13th-century_deaths","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Perdigon&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Perdigon","/wiki/Perdigon","/wiki/Talk:Perdigon","#","/wiki/Perdigon","/w/index.php?title=Perdigon&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Perdigon&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org
