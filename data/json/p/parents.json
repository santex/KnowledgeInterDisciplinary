In\nhumans, a parent is of a child (where \"child\" refers to offspring, not\nnecessarily age). Biological parents consist of the male who sired the child and\nthe female who gave birth to the child. In all human societies, the biological\nmother and father are both responsible for raising their young. However, some\nparents may not be biologically related to their children. An adoptive parent is\none who nurtures and raises the offspring of the biological parents but is not\nactually biologically related to the child. Children without adoptive parents\ncan be raised by their grandparents or other family members.\n\nA parent can also be elaborated as an ancestor removed one generation. With the\nusage of IVF, it is possible to have more than two biological parents.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-\n23079276 UK government backs three-person IVF] retrieved 30 June 2013</ref>\n","title":"Parent","headings":["Biological and non-biological parentage","Biological parents and parental testing","=Sperm/egg donation and surrogate mothers","Foster care and adoption","Step-parents","Child abuse and infanticide","Parental investment and parent–offspring conflict","Mother","Father","Grandparent","Parent–offspring conflict","Optimal gender mix","See also","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["3: Mother","2: Offspring","2: Gene","2: Childbirth","2: Pregnancy","2: Egg_donation","2: Enzyme","2: Parenting","2: Father","2: Parental_investment","2: LGBT_parenting","1: Latin","1: Sexual_reproduction","1: Birth","1: Adoptive","1: Ancestor","1: Generation","1: Sociology_of_fatherhood","1: Personal_relationship","1: Reproduction","1: Step-mother","1: Foster_parent","1: Fathers'_rights_movement","1: Embryo_transfer","1: List_of_Mendelian_traits_in_humans","1: Earlobe","1: Widow's_peak","1: Cleft_chin","1: Dominance_relationship","1: Genetic_fingerprinting","1: Blood_type","1: Protein","1: Human_leukocyte_antigen","1: Polymerase_chain_reaction","1: Restriction_fragment_length_polymorphism","1: Child","1: Male","1: Adjective","1: Verb","1: Genetic_chimera","1: Incest","1: Pedigree_collapse","1: Evolutionary_conflict","1: Sibling","1: Robert_Trivers","1: Gene-centered_view_of_evolution","1: Bird","1: Siblicide","1: Fetus","1: Placenta","1: Hormone","1: Insulin","1: Family","1: Nuclear_family","1: Adoption","1: Shared_parenting","1: Step-families","1: Bateman's_principle","1: Limiting_resource","1: Borderline_personality_disorder#Borderline_parents","1: Child_abuse","1: Cinderella_effect","1: Sperm_donation","1: Infant","1: Narcissistic_parents","1: Non-paternity_event","1: Parental_abuse_by_children","1: Parents_bullying_teachers","1: Paternal_bond","1: Reciprocal_socialization","1: Surrogate_mother","1: Teachers_bullying_parents","1: Roman_Catholic"]}
