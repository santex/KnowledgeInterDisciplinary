sequences","Articles containing proofs"],"text":"\nA 'prime number' (or a 'prime') is a natural number greater than 1 that has no\npositive divisors other than 1 and itself. A natural number greater than 1 that\nis not a prime number is called a composite number. For example, 5 is prime\nbecause only 1 and 5 evenly divide it, whereas 6 is composite because it has the\ndivisors 2 and 3 in addition to 1 and 6. The fundamental theorem of arithmetic\nestablishes the central role of primes in number theory: any integer greater\nthan 1 can be expressed as a product of primes that is unique up to ordering.\nThe uniqueness in this theorem requires excluding 1 as a prime because one can\ninclude arbitrarily many copies of 1 in any factorization, e.g., 3, 1 &times; 3,\n1 &times; 1 &times; 3, etc. are all valid factorizations of 3.\n\nThe property of being prime is called primality. A simple but slow method of\nverifying the primality of a given number n is known as trial division. It\nconsists of testing whether n is a multiple of any integer between 2 and\n<math>\\sqrt{n}</math>. Algorithms that are much more efficient than trial\ndivision have been devised to test the primality of large numbers. Particularly\nfast methods are available for numbers of special forms, such as Mersenne\nnumbers. , the largest known prime number has 17,425,170 decimal digits.\n\nThere are infinitely many primes, as demonstrated by Euclid around 300 BC. There\nis no known useful formula that sets apart all of the prime numbers from\ncomposites. However, the distribution of primes, that is to say, the statistical\nbehaviour of primes in the large, can be modeled. The first result in that\ndirection is the prime number theorem, proven at the end of the 19th century,\nwhich says that the probability that a given, randomly chosen number is prime is\ninversely proportional to its number of digits, or to the logarithm of n.\n\nMany questions around prime numbers remain open, such as Goldbach's conjecture,\nwhich proposes that every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the\nsum of two primes, and the twin prime conjecture, which says that there are\ninfinitely many pairs of primes whose difference is 2. Such questions spurred\nthe development of various branches of number theory, focusing on analytic or\nalgebraic aspects of numbers. Primes are used in several routines in information\ntechnology, such as public-key cryptography, which makes use of properties such\nas the difficulty of factoring large numbers into their prime factors. Prime\nnumbers give rise to various generalizations in other mathematical domains,\nmainly algebra, such as prime elements and prime ideals.\n","title":"Prime%20number","headings":["Definition and
