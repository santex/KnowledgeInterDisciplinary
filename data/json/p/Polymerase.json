{"cursor":"1959","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"]] A 'polymerase' is an enzyme (EC 2.7.7.6/7/19/48/49) whose central biological\nfunction is the synthesis of polymers of nucleic acids. DNA polymerase and RNA\npolymerase are used to assemble DNA and RNA molecules, respectively, generally\nby copying a DNA or RNA template strand using base-pairing interactions.\n\nIt is an accident of history that the enzymes responsible for the generation of\nother biopolymers are not also referred to as polymerases. For example, the\nenzymatic complex that assembles amino acids into proteins is termed the\nribosome, rather than \"protein polymerase\".\n\nOne particular polymerase, from the thermophilic bacterium, [[Thermus\naquaticus]] (Taq) (PDB\n[http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/cgi/explore.cgi?pid=288631034363198&pdbId=1BGX 1BGX],\nEC 2.7.7.7) is of vital commercial importance due to its use in the polymerase\nchain reaction, a widely used technique of molecular biology.\n\nOther well-known polymerases include:\n\n*Terminal Deoxynucleotidyl Transferase (TDT), which lends diversity to antibody\nheavy chains\n\n*Reverse Transcriptase, an enzyme used by RNA retroviruses like HIV, which is\nused to create a complementary strand to the preexisting strand of viral RNA\nbefore it can be integrated into the DNA of the host cell. It is also a major\ntarget for antiviral drugs.\n","linknr":415,"url":"Polymerase","recorded":1362508164,"links":27,"instances":["biology","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["EC 2.7.7","Enzymes"],"headings":["See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Taq_polimerase.png/220px-Taq_polimerase.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["host","biology"],["cell","biology"]],"members":["cell","host"],"related":["Enzyme","Polymer","Nucleic_acid","DNA_polymerase","RNA_polymerase","DNA","RNA","Base_pair","Biopolymer","Ribosome","Thermophile","Bacteria","Protein_data_bank","Polymerase_chain_reaction","Molecular_biology","Terminal_Deoxynucleotidyl_Transferase","Reverse_Transcriptase","RNA","Retrovirus","HIV","RNA","DNA","Host_(biology)","Cell_(biology)","DNA_polymerase","DNA_polymerase_I","DNA_polymerase_II","DNA_polymerase_III_holoenzyme","DNA_Polymerase_IV","SOS_response","RNA_polymerase","RNA_polymerase_I","RNA_polymerase_II","RNA_polymerase_III","T7_RNA_polymerase"]}
