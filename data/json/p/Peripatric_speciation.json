{"cursor":"2857","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n, peripatric, parapatric and sympatric speciation.]] 'Peripatric' and\n'peripatry' are terms from biogeography, referring to organisms whose ranges are\nclosely adjacent but do not overlap, being separated where these organisms do\nnot occur â€“ for example on an oceanic island compared to the mainland.\nSuch organisms are usually closely related (e.g. sister species), their\ndistribution being the result of 'peripatric speciation'.\n\nPeripatric speciation is a form of speciation, the formation of new species\nthrough evolution. In this form, new species are formed in isolated peripheral\npopulations; this is similar to allopatric speciation in that populations are\nisolated and prevented from exchanging genes. However, peripatric speciation,\nunlike allopatric speciation, proposes that one of the populations is much\nsmaller than the other. One possible consequence of peripatric speciation is\nthat a geographically widespread ancestral species becomes paraphyletic, thereby\nbecoming a paraspecies. The concept of a paraspecies is therefore a logical\nconsequence of the Evolutionary Species Concept, by which one species give rise\nto a daughter species. The evolution of the polar bear from the brown bear is a\nwell-documented example of a living species that gave rise to another living\nspecies through the evolution of a population located at the margin of the\nancestral species' range. http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Polar_bears_related_t-\no_extinct_Irish_bears,_DNA_study_shows http://www.sciencedirect.com/s-\ncience/article/pii/S0960982211006452\n\nPeripatric speciation was originally proposed by Ernst Mayr, and is related to\nthe founder effect, because small living populations may undergo selection\nbottlenecks. Genetic drift is often proposed to play a significant\nrole in peripatric speciation.\n","linknr":309,"url":"Peripatric_speciation","recorded":1362483538,"links":25,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Ecology","Evolutionary biology","Speciation","Scientific classification","Taxonomy"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/CollapsedtreeLabels-simplified.svg/200px-CollapsedtreeLabels-simplified.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/Tree_of_life.svg/16px-Tree_of_life.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/Office-book.svg/16px-Office-book.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/53/Speciation_modes.svg/300px-Speciation_modes.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Parapatric_speciation","Sympatric_speciation","Speciation","Biogeography","Organism","Sister_species","Speciation","Species","Evolution","Allopatric_speciation","Paraphyletic","Paraspecies","Species","Polar_bear","Brown_bear","Ernst_Mayr","Founder_effect","Genetic_drift"]}
