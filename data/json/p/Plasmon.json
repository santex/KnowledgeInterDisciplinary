{"cursor":"13975","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In physics, a 'plasmon' is a quantum of plasma oscillation. The plasmon is a\nquasiparticle resulting from the quantization of plasma oscillations just as\nphotons and phonons are quantizations of electromagnetic and mechanical\nvibrations, respectively (although the photon is an elementary particle, not a\nquasiparticle). Thus, plasmons are collective oscillations of the free electron\ngas density, for example, at optical frequencies. Plasmons can couple with a\nphoton to create another quasiparticle called a plasma polariton.\n\nSince plasmons are the quantization of classical plasma oscillations, most of\ntheir properties can be derived directly from Maxwell's equations.\n","linknr":435,"url":"Plasmon","recorded":1362510042,"links":38,"instances":["physics_articles","physics","physics","electromagnetic_radiation"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Plasma physics","Quasiparticles"],"headings":["Explanation","Surface plasmons","Possible applications","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/math/d/c/d/dcdada5a200d2f63658596eb36b541ae.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/b/8/7b8b965ad4bca0e41ab51de7b31363a1.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/1/6/e1671797c52e15f763380b45e841ec32.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/6/f/8/6f8f57715090da2632453988d9a1501b.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/c/2/2/c224f6cb978d975f587c4a2f9e1db179.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/9/d/f/9dfd055ef1683b053f1b5bf9ed6dbbb4.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/4/8/8488fc7d3b7bd0ef8a88ee3aea8ada01.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/GothicRayonnantRose003.jpg/220px-GothicRayonnantRose003.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg/16px-Portal-puzzle.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["quantization","physics"],["plasma","physics"],["quantization","physics"],["absorption","electromagnetic_radiation"],["list_of_plasma","physics_articles"]],"members":["list_of_plasma","plasma","quantization","absorption"],"related":["Physics","Quantum","Plasma_oscillation","Quasiparticle","Quantization_(physics)","Plasma_(physics)","Photon","Phonon","Elementary_particle","Polariton","Maxwell's_equations","Oscillation","Free_electron","Ion","Metal","Electric_field","Electron","Plasma_frequency","Energy","Electrical_resistance","Damping","Quantization_(physics)","Optical","Metal","Light","Plasma_frequency","Electric_field_screening","Electric_field","Ultraviolet","Copper","Physical_Review","Gold","Valence_band","John_Wiley_&_Sons","John_Wiley_&_Sons","Free_electron_model","Conduction_electron","Elementary_charge","Electron_mass","Permittivity_of_free_space","Planck_constant","Plasmon_frequency","Surface_plasmon","Polariton","Dielectric_constant","Surface_Enhanced_Raman_Spectroscopy","Diffraction_grating","Robert_W._Wood","Surface_plasmon_resonance","Biochemist","Enzyme","Stained_glass","Rose_window","Notre-Dame_de_Paris","Colloid","Stained_glass","Microwave_radiation","Nanometer","Adsorption","Molecular_sensor","Casein","Absorption_(electromagnetic_radiation)","Microprocessor","THz","GHz","Transistor","Plasmonster","Plasmonic_nanolithography","Lithography","Colloid","Protein","Biacore","L'Or√©al","Organic_light-emitting_diode","KAIST","ElectroIQ","Holograms","Surface_plasmon_resonance","Waves_in_plasmas","Plasma_oscillation","Spinplasmonics","Transformation_optics","Extraordinary_optical_transmission","Phonon","List_of_plasma_(physics)_articles","Slashdot"]}
