The term was coined by Otto Neurath in a\nseries of early twentieth century essays on the subject, in which he wrote:\n\n:\"According to physicalism, the language of physics is the universal language of\n:science and, consequently, any knowledge can be brought back to the statements\n:on the physical objects.\" {{cite book\n| author= Keith, J.F. title = Integrationalism: Essays on the rationale of\n| abundance publisher = Createspace year = 2010 isbn = 1-4528-5893-4 url = http://books.google.com.br/books?id=dgOinwwR-\n| FoC&pg=PA12&dq=%22According+to+physicalism,+the+language%22#v=onepage&q=%22Ac-\n| cording%20to%20physicalism%2C%20the%20language%22&f=false\n}}, p. 12.\n\nIn contemporary philosophy, physicalism is most frequently associated with the\nmind-body problem in philosophy of mind, regarding which physicalism holds that\nall that has been ascribed to \"mind\" is more correctly ascribed to \"brain\" or\nthe activity of the brain. Physicalism is also called \"materialism\", but the\nterm \"physicalism\" is preferable because it has evolved with the physical\nsciences to incorporate far more sophisticated notions of physicality than\nmatter, for example wave/particle relationships and non-material forces produced\nby particles.\n\nThe related position of methodological naturalism says that philosophy and\nscience should at least operate under the assumptions of natural sciences (and\nthus physicalism). Physicalism is a strong form of metaphysical\nnaturalism.\n\nThe ontology of physicalism ultimately includes whatever is described by\nphysics â not just matter but energy, space, time, physical forces,\nstructure, physical processes, information, state, etc. Because it claims\nthat only physical things exist, physicalism is generally a form of\nontological monism.\n","linknr":762,"url":"Physicalism","recorded":1362585294,"links":52,"instances":["philosopher","philosophy_of_time","philosopher","philosophy","computer_science"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Mind–body problem","Monism","Materialism","Metaphysical theories","Theories of mind","Physicalism","Metaphysics of mind"],"headings":["Reductive and non-reductive physicalism","Reductive physicalism","Non-reductive physicalism","Strawsonian physicalism","Arguments for physicalism","Arguments against physicalism","Jaegwon Kim's argument against non-reductivism","Further divisions of physicalism","See also","Notes","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/Crystal_Clear_app_kedit.svg/40px-Crystal_Clear_app_kedit.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/Socrates.png/18px-Socrates.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg/16px-Portal-puzzle.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/People_icon.svg/16px-People_icon.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["state","computer_science"],["donald_davidson","philosopher"],["michael_lockwood","philosopher"],["exclusion_principle","philosophy"],["presentism","philosophy_of_time"]],"members":["michael_lockwood","presentism","donald_davidson","exclusion_principle","state"],"related":["Philosophical_theory","Exists","Physical_properties","Otto_Neurath","Contemporary_philosophy","Mind-body_problem","Philosophy_of_mind","Materialism","Physical_science","Methodological_naturalism","Metaphysical_naturalism","Physics","Matter","Energy","Space","Time","Forces","Structure","Physical_process","Physical_information","State_(computer_science)","Monism","Reductionism","Supervenience","Causality","Modal_realism","Epiphenomenalism","Type_physicalism","Hilary_Putnam","Multiple_realizability","Physics","Ontological_reductionism","Eliminativism","Philosophy_of_mind","Mental_event","Correlation","Ullin_Place","E._G._Boring","Epistemology","Logical_positivism","Phenomenalism","Gottlob_Frege","Sense","Reference","Herbert_Feigl","J.J.C._Smart","Ludwig_Wittgenstein","J.L._Austin","Logical_behaviorism","Donald_Davidson_(philosopher)","Supervenience","Philip_Kitcher","Elliott_Sober","Alexander_Rosenberg","Action_potential","C-fibres","Anomalous_monism","Particular","Logical_consequence","Emergentism","Dualism","Monistic","Materialism","Panpsychist","Monistic_idealist","Einstein","Stephen_Hawking","Kant","Noumenal","Galen_Strawson","Michael_Lockwood_(philosopher)","Bertrand_russell","Exclusion_principle_(philosophy)","Epiphenomenalism","Methodological_naturalism","Qualia","Frank_Cameron_Jackson","Mary's_room","Lawrence_Nemerow","David_Kellogg_Lewis","Thought_experiment","Organisms","Consciousness","Qualia","Zombie","David_Chalmers","Qualia","Daniel_Dennett","Health","Jaegwon_Kim","Jaegwon_Kim","A_priori_and_a_posteriori","Helmuth_Plessner","Logical_truth","Stanford_Encyclopedia_of_Philosophy","Materialism","Monism","Ontological_pluralism","Presentism_(philosophy_of_time)"]}
