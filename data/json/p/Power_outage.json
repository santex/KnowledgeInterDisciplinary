{"cursor":"12866","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\nA 'power outage' (also 'power cut', 'blackout', or 'power failure') is a short-\nor long-term loss of the electric power to an area.\n\nThere are many causes of power failures in an electricity network. Examples of\nthese causes include faults at power stations, damage to electric transmission\nlines, substations or other parts of the distribution system, a short circuit,\nor the overloading of electricity mains.\n\nPower failures are particularly critical at sites where the environment and\npublic safety are at risk. Institutions such as hospitals, sewage treatment\nplants, mines, and the like will usually have backup power sources such as\nstandby generators, which will automatically start up when electrical power is\nlost. Other critical systems, such as telecommunications, are also required to\nhave emergency power. Telephone exchange rooms usually have arrays of lead-acid\nbatteries for backup and also a socket for connecting a generator during\nextended periods of outage.\n","linknr":293,"url":"Power_outage","recorded":1362485860,"links":43,"instances":["electronics","electricity","electricity","electrical"],"pdf":["http://ffden-2.phys.uaf.edu/HICSS2002-paper2.pdf","http://eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu/~dobson/PAPERS/carrerasHICSS00.pdf","http://www.cigre-c1-forum.org/Noticeboard_files/Unruly_grids.pdf","http://www.cigre-c1-forum.org/Noticeboard_files/Unruly_grids.pdf","http://chaos1.la.asu.edu/~yclai/papers/PRE_02_ML_3.pdf"],"categories":["Electric power blackouts|"],"headings":["Types of power outage","Protecting the power system from outages","Protecting computer systems from power outages","Restoring power after a wide-area outage","Blackout inevitability and electric sustainability","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/be/Crossed_wires.JPG/300px-Crossed_wires.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/68/PowerOutageBlackout.svg/220px-PowerOutageBlackout.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/84/PowerOutageDropout.svg/220px-PowerOutageDropout.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/14/Crystal_energy.svg/29px-Crystal_energy.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/24/Wikinews-logo.svg/40px-Wikinews-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["brownout","electricity"],["grid","electricity"],["fuse","electrical"],["bootstrapping","electronics"]],"members":["bootstrapping","grid","brownout","fuse"],"related":["Electric_power","Power_station","Electric_power_transmission","Electrical_substation","Electricity_distribution","Short_circuit","Hospital","Sanitary_sewer","Mining","Emergency_power_system","Telecommunications","Lead-acid_batteries","Transient_fault","Brownout_(electricity)","Volt","Power_station","Grid_(electricity)","Protective_relay","Fuse_(electrical)","Cascading_failure","Electrical_grid","Uninterruptible_power_supply","Surge_protector","Black_start","Bootstrapping_(electronics)","Electric_power_transmission","List_of_power_outages","Power_grid","Self-organized_criticality","Electric_Power_Research_Institute","Smart_grid","Phasor_measurement_unit","High-voltage_direct_current","Wide_area_synchronous_grid","Cascading_failure","Cascading_failure","List_of_power_outages","Brittle_Power","Energy_conservation","NaFIRS","Outage_management_system","Renewable_energy","Rolling_blackout","Uninterruptible_power_supply","Smart_grid","Electromagnetic_pulse"]}
