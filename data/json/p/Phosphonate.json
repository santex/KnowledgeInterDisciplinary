{"cursor":"8791","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Phosphonates' or 'phosphonic acids' are organic compounds containing C-\nPO(OH) 2 or C-PO(OR) 2 groups (where R=alkyl, aryl).\nBisphosphonates were first synthesized in 1897 by Von Baeyer and Hofmann. An\nexample of such a bisphosphonate is HEDP (Etidronic acid or Didronel). Since the\nwork of Schwarzenbach in 1949, phosphonic acids are known as effective chelating\nagents. The introduction of an amine group into the molecule to obtain -NH 2-C-\nPO(OH) 2 increases the metal binding abilities of the phosphonate.\nExamples for such compounds are NTMP, EDTMP and DTPMP. These common phosphonates\nare the structure analogues to the well-known aminopolycarboxylates NTA, EDTA,\nand DTPA. The stability of the metal complexes increases with increasing number\nof phosphonic acid groups. Phosphonates are highly water-soluble while the\nphosphonic acids are only sparingly soluble. Phosphonates are not volatile and\nare poorly soluble in organic solvents.\n","linknr":258,"url":"Phosphonate","recorded":1362372496,"links":30,"instances":["chemist"],"pdf":["http://www.arkat-usa.org/ark/journal/2006/I10_General/1838/06-1838EP%20as%20published%20mainmanuscript.pdf","http://www.arkat-usa.org/ark/journal/2006/I10_General/1838/06-1838EP%20as%20published%20mainmanuscript.pdf"],"categories":["Functional groups","Phosphonates|*","Phosphonic acids|*","Chelating agents"],"headings":["Chemistry","Occurrence in nature","Uses","Toxicology","Biodegradation","Environmental behavior","Phosphonate compounds","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/db/Phosphonate.png/220px-Phosphonate.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/2-aminoethylphosphonate.png/200px-2-aminoethylphosphonate.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["fritz_hofmann","chemist"]],"members":["fritz_hofmann"],"related":["Alkyl","Aryl","Bisphosphonates","Von_Baeyer","Fritz_Hofmann_(chemist)","Etidronic_acid","Gerold_Schwarzenbach","Chelating_agent","Amine","Nitrilotriacetic_acid","EDTA","Michaelisâ€“Arbuzov_reaction","Condensation_reaction","Benzaldehyde","Aniline","Trimethyl_phosphite","Copper_triflate","One-pot_synthesis","Organic_synthesis","Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons_reaction","Chelating_agent","Samarium-153-ethylene_diamine_tetramethylene_phosphonate","Sudden_oak_death","Bioconcentration_factor","DMMP","Etidronic_acid","ATMP","EDTMP","DTPMP","Organophosphorus","Phosphine","Phosphine_oxide","Phosphinite","Phosphonite","Phosphite","Phosphinate","Phosphate"]}
