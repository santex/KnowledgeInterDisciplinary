The film was written, directed, and\nproduced by Shane Carruth and was completed on a budget of $7,000. Carruth graduated from college with a degree in mathematics and is\na former engineer. Primer is of note for its extremely low\nbudget, experimental plot structure, philosophical implications, and complex\ntechnical dialogue, which Carruth chose not to simplify for the sake of the\naudience. One reviewer said that \"anybody who claims he fully understands what's\ngoing on in Primer after seeing it just once is either a savant or a liar.\" The film collected the Grand Jury Prize at Sundance in\n2004 before securing a limited release in the United States, and has since\ngained a cult following.\n","linknr":350,"url":"Primer_(film)","recorded":1362544541,"links":33,"instances":["actor"],"pdf":["http://web.archive.org/web/20080414031313/http://www.sundance.org/festival/press_industry/pdf/Sundance+Film+Festival+Awards+1985-2007.pdf","http://sundance.org/festival/press_industry/pdf/Sundance%20Film%20Festival%20Awards%201985-2007.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20080414031313/http://www.sundance.org/festival/press_industry/pdf/Sundance+Film+Festival+Awards+1985-2007.pdf","http://www.nobleworld.biz/images/Gendler.pdf","http://www.jgoodwin.net/academic/papers/primer.pdf"],"categories":["American films","American science fiction films","Alfred P.
