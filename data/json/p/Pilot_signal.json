The receiver doubles the frequency of the pilot tone and uses it as a\nphase reference to demodulate the stereo information.\n\nIf no 19 kHz pilot tone is present, then any signals in the 25-53 kHz range\nare ignored by a stereo receiver. A guard band of Â±4 kHz (15-23 kHz) protects\nthe pilot tone from interference from the baseband audio signal (50 Hz-15 kHz)\nand from the lower sideband of the double sideband stereo information (23-53\nkHz). The third harmonic of the pilot (19×3, or 57 kHz) is used for\nRadio Data System.\n\nIn AM stereo, the bandwidth is too narrow to accommodate subcarriers, so the\nmodulation itself is changed, and the pilot tone is infrasonic (below the normal\nhearing range, instead of above it).\n\nIn color television, the color burst placed between each pair of video fields is\nthe pilot signal to indicate that there are color subcarriers present.\n\nIn the NTSC television system, a pilot tone of 15.734 kHz is used to indicate\nthe presence of MTS stereo.\n\nIn some analog video formats (Frequency modulation is the standard method for\nrecording the luminance part of the signal, and is used to record a composite\nvideo signal in Direct colour systems), e.g. Video 2000 and some Hi-band formats\na pilot tone is added to the signal to detect and correct timebase errors.\n\nNote: Sometimes it is necessary to employ several independent pilot frequencies.\n      Most radio relay systems use radio or continuity pilots of their own but\n      transmit also the pilot frequencies belonging to the carrier frequency\n      multiplex system.\n","linknr":117,"url":"Pilot_signal","recorded":1362576171,"links":14,"instances":["signal_processing","sense","telecommunication"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Telecommunications techniques","Synchronization"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ec/Frequency_Spectrum_FM-Radio.gif/220px-Frequency_Spectrum_FM-Radio.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf8/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/62/PD-icon.svg/12px-PD-icon.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["signalling","telecommunication"],["bandwidth","signal_processing"],["hearing","sense"]],"members":["bandwidth","hearing","signalling"],"related":["Telecommunication","Signalling_(telecommunication)","Frequency","Communications_system","Equalization","Synchronization","Reference","FM_stereo","Broadcasting","KHz","Stereophonic","Harmonic","Guard_band","Adjacent-channel_interference","Baseband","Audio_frequency","Sideband","Double_sideband","Radio_Data_System","AM_stereo","Bandwidth_(signal_processing)","Narrowband","Modulation","Infrasound","Hearing_(sense)","Color_television","Color_burst","Video_frame","NTSC","Multichannel_television_sound","Video_2000","Timebase_correction","Radio_relay","Carrier_wave"]}
