      "text" : "\n.]]\n\n'Paradise' is a religious or metaphysical term for a place in which existence is\npositive, harmonious and eternal. It is conceptually a counter-image of the\nsupposed miseries of human civilization, and in paradise there is only peace,\nprosperity, and happiness. Paradise is a place of contentment, but it is not\nnecessarily a land of luxury and idleness. Paradise is often described as a\n\"higher place\", the holiest place, in contrast to this world, or underworlds\nsuch as Hell.\n\nParadisaical notions are cross-cultural, often laden with pastoral imagery, and\nmay be cosmogonical or eschatological or both. In eschatological contexts,\nparadise is imagined as an abode of the virtuous dead. In Christian and Islamic\nunderstanding, Heaven is a paradisaical relief, evident for example in the\nGospel of Luke when Jesus tells a penitent criminal crucified alongside him that\nthey will be together in paradise. In old Egyptian beliefs, the otherworld is\nAaru, the reed-fields of ideal hunting and fishing grounds where the dead lived\nafter judgment. For the Celts, it was the Fortunate Isle of Mag Mell. For the\nclassical Greeks, the Elysian fields was a paradisaical land of plenty where the\nheroic and righteous dead hoped to spend eternity. The Vedic Indians held that\nthe physical body was destroyed by fire but recreated and reunited in the Third\nHeaven in a state of bliss. In the Zoroastrian Avesta, the \"Best Existence\"<!--\nvahišta.ahu- --> and the \"House of Song\"<!-- garō.dəmāma- --> are places of the\nrighteous dead. On the other hand, in cosmological contexts 'paradise' describes\nthe world before it was tainted by evil. So for example, the Abrahamic faiths\nassociate paradise with the Garden of Eden, that is, the perfect state of the\nworld prior to the fall from grace, and the perfect state that will be restored\nin the World to Come.\n\nThe concept is a topos' in art and literature, particularly of the pre-\nEnlightenment era, a well-known representative of which is John Milton's\n[[Paradise Lost]]. A paradise should not be confused with a utopia, which is an\nalternative society.\n",
