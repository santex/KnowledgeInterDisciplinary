{"cursor":"95982","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" Geological periods are annotated (by abbreviation and colour) above. The\nPermianâTriassic extinction event is the most significant event for marine\ngenera, with just over 50% (according to this source) failing to survive.\n([[:Image:Extinction intensity.svg|source and image info]])}} The\n'PermianâTriassic' ('PâTr') 'extinction event', informally known as the 'Great\nDying', was an extinction event that occurred 252.28 Ma (million\nyears) ago, forming the boundary between the Permian and\nTriassic geologic periods, as well as the Paleozoic and Mesozoic eras. It is the\nEarth's most severe known extinction event, with up to 96% of all marine\nspecies and 70% of terrestrial vertebrate species\nbecoming extinct. It is the only\nknown mass extinction of insects. Some 57% of all families and 83% of all genera became\nextinct. Because so much biodiversity was lost, the recovery of life on Earth\ntook significantly longer than after any other extinction event, possibly up to 10 million years.\n\nResearchers have variously suggested that there were from one to three distinct\npulses, or phases, of extinction. There are several proposed\nmechanisms for the extinctions; the earlier phase was likely due to gradual\nenvironmental change, while the latter phase has been argued to be due to a\ncatastrophic event. Suggested mechanisms for the latter include large or\nmultiple bolide impact events, increased volcanism, coal/gas fires and\nexplosions from the Siberian Traps,  and\nsudden release of methane clathrate from the sea floor; gradual changes include\nsea-level change, anoxia, increasing aridity, and a shift in ocean circulation\ndriven by climate change.\n","linknr":1485,"url":"Permo-Triassic_extinction_event","recorded":1362372802,"links":79,"instances":["reference_date","canada","ecology","environmental","zoology","biology"],"pdf":["http://journals.royalsociety.org/content/qq5un1810k7605h5/fulltext.pdf","http://journals.royalsociety.org/content/qq5un1810k7605h5/fulltext.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20071025225841/http://nmnaturalhistory.org/pdf_files/TJB.pdf","http://nmnaturalhistory.org/pdf_files/TJB.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20071025225841/http://nmnaturalhistory.org/pdf_files/TJB.pdf","http://www.geochem.geos.vt.edu/bgep/pubs/Chapter_11_Knoll.pdf","http://www.geochem.geos.vt.edu/bgep/pubs/Chapter_11_Knoll.pdf","http://pangea.stanford.edu/~jlpayne/Knoll%20et%20al%202007%20EPSL%20Permian%20Triassic%20paleophysiology.pdf","http://pangea.stanford.edu/~jlpayne/Knoll%20et%20al%202007%20EPSL%20Permian%20Triassic%20paleophysiology.pdf","http://www.nasmus.co.za/PALAEO/jbotha/pdfs/Botha%20and%20Smith%202007.pdf","http://www.nasmus.co.za/PALAEO/jbotha/pdfs/Botha%20and%20Smith%202007.pdf","http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2005/pdf/2358.pdf","http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2005/pdf/2358.pdf","http://www.le.ac.uk/gl/ads/SiberianTraps/Documents/White2002-P-Tr-whodunit.pdf","http://www.le.ac.uk/gl/ads/SiberianTraps/Documents/White2002-P-Tr-whodunit.pdf","http://www.le.ac.uk/gl/ads/SiberianTraps/PDF%20Files/The%20Siberian%20Traps%20and%20the%20End-Permian%20mass.pdf","http://www.le.ac.uk/gl/ads/SiberianTraps/PDF%20Files/The%20Siberian%20Traps%20and%20the%20End-Permian%20mass.pdf","http://www.le.ac.uk/gl/ads/SiberianTraps/PDF%20Files/Reichow%20et%20al.%202009.pdf","http://www.le.ac.uk/gl/ads/SiberianTraps/PDF%20Files/Reichow%20et%20al.%202009.pdf","http://digitallibrary.amnh.org/dspace/bitstream/2246/2673/1/N2465.pdf","http://digitallibrary.amnh.org/dspace/bitstream/2246/2673/1/N2465.pdf"],"categories":["Extinction
