{"cursor":"13877","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'phosphatase' is an enzyme that removes a phosphate group from its substrate\nby hydrolysing phosphoric acid monoesters into a phosphate ion and a molecule\nwith a free hydroxyl group (see dephosphorylation). This action is directly\nopposite to that of phosphorylases and kinases, which attach phosphate groups to\ntheir substrates by using energetic molecules like ATP. A common phosphatase in\nmany organisms is alkaline phosphatase.\n\nProtein phosphorylation is the most common and important form of reversible\nprotein posttranslational modification (PTM), with up to 30% of all proteins\nbeing phosphorylated at any given time. Protein kinases (PKs) are the effectors\nof phosphorylation and catalyse the transfer of a Î³-phosphate from ATP to\nspecific amino acids on proteins. Several hundred PKs exist in mammals and are\nclassified into distinct super-families. Proteins are phosphorylated\npredominantly on Ser, Thr and Tyr residues, which account for 86, 12 and 2%\nrespectively of the phosphoproteome, at least in mammals. In contrast, protein\nphosphatases (PPs) are the primary effectors of dephosphorylation and can be\ngrouped into three main classes based on sequence, structure and catalytic\nfunction. The largest class of PPs is the phosphoprotein phosphatase (PPP)\nfamily comprising PP1, PP2A, PP2B, PP4, PP5, PP6 and PP7, and the protein\nphosphatase Mg 2+ - or Mn 2+ -dependent (PPM) family, composed\nprimarily of PP2C. The protein Tyr phosphatase (PTP) super-family forms the\nsecond group, and the aspartate-based protein phosphatases the third.\n","linknr":398,"url":"Phosphatase","recorded":1362666714,"links":31,"instances":["biochemistry","gene"],"pdf":[],"categories":["EC 3.1.3","Protein structure"],"headings":["Mechanism","Sub-types","Physiological relevance","Learning and memory","Protein phosphatases","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/Phosmech.png/300px-Phosmech.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/6c/Wiki_letter_w.svg/23px-Wiki_letter_w.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["substrate","biochemistry"],["pten","gene"]],"members":["substrate","pten"],"related":["Enzyme","Phosphate_group","Substrate_(biochemistry)","Hydrolysis","Phosphoric_acid","Ester","Phosphate","Ion","Hydroxyl","Dephosphorylation","Phosphorylase","Kinase","Phosphorylation","Adenosine_triphosphate","Alkaline_phosphatase","Protein_kinases","Cysteine","Nucleophile","Phosphorus","Amino_acid","Magnesium","Manganese","Iron","Zinc","Nucleophile","Phosphorus","Tyrosine","PTP1B","Serine","Threonine","PPP2CA","DUSP1","DUSP28","Histidine","PTEN_(gene)","Kinases","Phosphorylases","Signal_transduction","Cyclin_dependent_kinase","Phosphate","Signal_transduction","Hydrolysis","Acid_salt","Endonuclease/Exonuclease/phosphatase_family"]}
