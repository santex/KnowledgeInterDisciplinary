As the word\nsuggests, it combines the knowledge of pharmacology and of genomics. It is the\ntechnology that deals with the influence of genetic variation on drug response\nin patients by correlating gene expression or single-nucleotide polymorphisms\nwith a drug's efficacy or toxicity. By doing so,\npharmacogenomics aims to develop rational means to optimize drug therapy, with\nrespect to the patients' genotype, to ensure maximum efficacy with minimal\nadverse effects. Such approaches promise the\nadvent of \"personalized medicine\"; in which drugs and drug combinations are\noptimized for each individual's unique genetic makeup.\n","linknr":254,"url":"Pharmacogenomics","recorded":1362503607,"links":28,"instances":["medicine","mood"],"pdf":["http://www.fda.gov/downloads/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm126957.pdf","http://www.fda.gov/downloads/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm126957.pdf"],"categories":["Genomics","Pharmacology","Pharmacy"],"headings":["Drug metabolism","Applications","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/Merge-arrows.svg/50px-Merge-arrows.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/Open_Access_logo_PLoS_transparent.svg/8px-Open_Access_logo_PLoS_transparent.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["adverse_effect","medicine"],["depression","mood"]],"members":["adverse_effect","depression"],"related":["Pharmacology","Genomics","Genetics","Gene_expression","Single-nucleotide_polymorphism","Efficacy","Toxicity","Genotype","Adverse_effect_(medicine)","Personalized_medicine","Cytochrome_P450","Enzymes","Codeine","Clopidogrel","Tamoxifen","Warfarin","Dihydropyrimidine_dehydrogenase_deficiency","5-FU","Capecitabine","Irinotecan","6-mercaptopurine","Gemcitabine","Cytarabine","Cancer","Cardiovascular_disorders","Depression_(mood)","Bipolar_disorder","Attention_deficit_disorder","HIV","Tuberculosis","Asthma","Diabetes","Cancer_treatment","Cancer_drugs","KRAS","Cetuximab","Epidermal_growth_factor_receptor","Gefitinib","Cardio_vascular_disorder","Warfarin","Clopidogrel","Beta_blocker","Statin","Genomics","Pharmacogenetics","Toxicogenomics","Clinomics","Genetic_engineering","Race_and_health"]}
