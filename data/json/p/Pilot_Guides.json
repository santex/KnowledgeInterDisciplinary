The British series was inspired\nby the Lonely Planet travelbooks and began airing in 1994. Globe Trekker is\nbroadcast in over 40 countries across six continents.\n\nEach episode features a host, called a traveller, who travels with a camera crew\nto a countryâoften, a relatively exotic localeâand experiences the sights,\nsounds, and culture that the location has to offer. Special episodes feature in-\ndepth city, beach, dive, shopping, history, festival, and food guides.\n\nThe show often goes far beyond popular tourist destinations in order to give\nviewers a more authentic look at local culture. Presenters usually participate\nin different aspects of regional life, such as attending a traditional wedding\nor visiting a mining community. They address the viewer directly, acting as tourists-turned-\ntour guides, but are also filmed interacting with locals and discovering\ninteresting locations in (mostly) unrehearsed sequences. Globe Trekker also\nsometimes includes brief interviews with backpackers who share tips on\nindependent travel in that particular country.\n","linknr":169,"url":"Pilot_Guides","recorded":1362576262,"links":19,"instances":["traveller","uk","travel","aus","producer","musician","comedian"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Travel television series","1994 television series debuts","1990s American television series","2000s American television series","2010s American television series","English-language television series"],"headings":["Production details","Presenters","Episodes","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/ab/Globe_Trekker_logo.jpg/260px-Globe_Trekker_logo.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["ian_wright","traveller"],["travel_channel","uk"],["discovery_travel_&_living","aus"],["backpacking","travel"],["ian_ritchie","producer"],["jesper_mattsson","musician"],["holly_morris","author,_tv_producer-host"],["alex_riley","comedian"],["ian_wright","traveller"]],"members":["ian_wright","travel_channel","backpacking","holly_morris","ian_ritchie","jesper_mattsson","alex_riley"],"related":["Ian_Wright_(traveller)","Justine_Shapiro","Megan_McCormick","Channel_4","PBS","OLN","Travel_Channel","Travel_Channel_(UK)","Discovery_Travel_&_Living_(Aus)","TVOntario","NYCTV","Israel_Broadcasting_Authority","DR2","NRK2","Australia","Thailand","Canada","Adventure_travel","Television_series","United_Kingdom","Lonely_Planet","Camera_crew","City","Beach","Scuba_diving","Shopping","History","Festival","Food","Backpacking_(travel)","Episode","Research","Film_editing","Post-production","Film_crew","Camera_operator","Utility_sound_technician","Television_producer","Television_director","Driving","Aviator","Ian_Ritchie_(producer)","Michael_Conn","Colin_Winston-Fletcher","Makoto_Sakamoto","Jesper_Mattsson_(musician)","Stephen_Luscombe","Pandit_Dinesh","Christina_Chang","Bradley_Cooper","Andrew_Daddo","Tyler_Florence","Zay_Harding","Padma_Lakshmi","Megan_McCormick","Holly_Morris_(Author,_TV_Producer-Host)","Alex_Riley_(comedian)","Justine_Shapiro","Adela_Úcar","Ian_Wright_(traveller)"]}
