{"cursor":"1181","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nIn Mechanics lien law a Preliminary Notice (also known as a Notice to Owner,\nMaterialmens Notice to Owner, Notice of Furnishing, Contractor/Subcontractors\nNotice to Owner, and others) is a notice sent by the contractor, subcontractor,\nmaterialmen, equipment lessors or other parties to a construction project not to\ncreate a Mechanics lien but rather to establish a right to file a [[Mechanics\nlien]]. The distinction is important. If the Preliminary Notice is sent but the\nclaimant's bill is paid the Preliminary Notice has no further legal effect.\nHowever, if the bill is not paid the claimant may now file a Mechanics lien on\nthe owner's property. Most states do not allow the filing of a Mechanics lien\nwithout claimants being able to prove they first sent a Preliminary Notice.\n\nIn the United States about forty states now require some form of a Preliminary\nNotice to the owner and general contractor of a construction project. Most forms\nfor the process can be obtained from local office supply stores, and a few\ncomputer programs exist to handle the process on a nationwide basis.\n","linknr":80,"url":"Preliminary_Notice","recorded":1362900367,"links":12,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Property law"],"headings":[],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Mechanics_lien","Mechanics_lien","Mechanics_lien","Mechanics_lien"]}
