ICD10 = ICD9 =\n}}\n\nA 'prion' in the Scrapie form (PrP Sc )  is an infectious\nagent composed of protein in a misfolded form. This is\nthe central idea of the Prion Hypothesis, which remains debated. This\nwould be in contrast to all other known infectious agents\n(virus/bacteria/fungus/parasite) which must contain nucleic acids (either DNA,\nRNA, or both). The word prion, coined in 1982 by Stanley B. Prusiner, is derived\nfrom the words protein and infection. Prions are\nresponsible for the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies in a variety of\nmammals, including bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE, also known as \"mad cow\ndisease\") in cattle and CreutzfeldtâJakob disease (CJD) in humans. All known\nprion diseases affect the structure of the brain or other neural tissue and all\nare currently untreatable and universally fatal.\n\nPrions propagate by transmitting a misfolded protein state. When a prion enters\na healthy organism, it induces existing, properly folded proteins to convert\ninto the disease-associated, prion form; the prion acts as a template to guide\nthe misfolding of more proteins into prion form. These newly formed prions can\nthen go on to convert more proteins themselves; this triggers a chain reaction\nthat produces large amounts of the prion form. All known prions\ninduce the formation of an amyloid fold, in which the protein polymerises into\nan aggregate consisting of tightly packed beta sheets. Amyloid aggregates are\nfibrils, growing at their ends, and replicating when breakage causes two growing\nends to become four growing ends. The incubation period of prion diseases is\ndetermined by the exponential growth rate associated with prion replication,\nwhich is a balance between the linear growth and the breakage of aggregates. (Note that the propagation of the prion depends on the\npresence of normally folded protein in which the prion can induce misfolding;\nanimals which do not express the normal form of the prion protein cannot develop\nnor transmit the disease.)\n\nThis altered structure is extremely stable and accumulates in infected tissue,\ncausing tissue damage and cell death. This structural stability means\nthat prions are resistant to denaturation by chemical and physical agents,\nmaking disposal and containment of these particles difficult. Prions come in\ndifferent strains, each with a slightly different structure, and most of the\ntime, strains breed true. Prion replication is nevertheless subject to\noccasional epimutation and then natural selection just like other forms of\nreplication. However, the number of possible distinct prion strains\nis likely far smaller than the number of possible DNA sequences, so evolution\ntakes place within a limited space.\n\nAll known mammalian prion diseases are caused by the so-called prion protein,\nPrP. The endogenous, properly folded, form is denoted PrP C (for\n'C'ommon or 'C'ellular) while the disease-linked, misfolded form is denoted\nPrP Sc (for '''''Sc'''rapie'', after one of the diseases first linked\nto prions and neurodegeneration.) The precise\nstructure of the prion is not known, though they can be formed by combining\nPrP C, polyadenylic acid, and lipids in a Protein Misfolding Cyclic\nAmplification (PMCA) reaction.\n\nProteins showing prion-type behavior are also found in some fungi, which has\nbeen useful in helping to understand mammalian prions. Fungal prions do not\nappear to cause disease in their hosts.\n","linknr":1144,"url":"Prion","recorded":1362483891,"links":86,"instances":["disease","sofia","biology","biology","biochemistry"],"pdf":["http://www3.kfu.edu.sa/sjournal/eng/pdffiles/b526.pdf","http://www3.kfu.edu.sa/sjournal/eng/pdffiles/b526.pdf","https://www.sgm.ac.uk/pubs/micro_today/pdf/081010.pdf","https://www.sgm.ac.uk/pubs/micro_today/pdf/081010.pdf","http://www.bionosis.com/news/Bionosis%20PrioNet%20Poster.pdf","http://www.bionosis.com/news/Bionosis%20PrioNet%20Poster.pdf"],"categories":["Prions|","Genetics","Proteins","Amyloidosis"],"headings":["Discovery","Structure","Prion
