Plays are performed at a variety of levels, from Broadway,\nOff-Broadway, regional theater, to Community theatre, as well a University or\nschool productions. There are rare dramatists, notably George Bernard Shaw, who\nhave had little preference whether their plays were performed or read. The term\n\"play\" can refer to both the written works of playwrights and to their complete\ntheatrical performance. [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/play\n\"Play\"]: Dictionary.com website.
