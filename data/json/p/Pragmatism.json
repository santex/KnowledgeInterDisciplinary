{"cursor":"80663","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n'Pragmatism' is a philosophical tradition centered on the linking of practice\nand theory. It describes a process where theory is extracted from practice, and\napplied back to practice to form what is called intelligent practice. Important\npositions characteristic of pragmatism include instrumentalism, radical\nempiricism, verificationism, conceptual relativity, and fallibilism. There is\ngeneral consensus among pragmatists that philosophy should take the methods and\ninsights of modern science into account. Charles\nSanders Peirce (and his pragmatic maxim) deserves most of the credit for\npragmatism, along with later twentieth century\ncontributors, William James and John Dewey.

Quine and Wilfrid Sellars\nused a revised pragmatism to criticize logical positivism in the 1960s. Another\nbrand of pragmatism, known sometimes as neopragmatism, gained influence through\nRichard Rorty, the most influential of the late twentieth century pragmatists.\nContemporary pragmatism may be broadly divided into a strict analytic tradition\nand a \"neo-classical\" pragmatism (such as Susan Haack) that adheres to the work\nof Peirce, James, and Dewey.
