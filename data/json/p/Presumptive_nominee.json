{"cursor":"5296","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In United States politics, the 'presumptive nominee' is a political candidate\nwho is assured of his or her party's nomination, but has not yet been formally\nnominated. A candidate may be considered a presumptive nominee after all other\nmajor competitors have dropped out and it is considered unlikely that the\ncandidate will withdraw, be usurped, or be otherwise removed from the race.\n\nThe presumptive nominee is the candidate who has not yet received the formal\nnomination of his or her political party at the party's nominating convention,\nbut who has acquired enough delegate commitments through the primary elections\nand caucuses to be assured â barring unforeseen events â of the eventual\nnomination at the convention. Sabato, Larry; Ernst, Howard R.  The\nterm is applicable to the candidate's selected running mate as well. The term is\napplied widely on the national level, notably in regard to the U.S. presidential\nnominating conventions, as well as at the statewide level. Wiessler, David\n(March 4, 2008) [http://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUSN0446485720080304\n\"FACTBOX: Presidential political terms\"], Reuters.com. Retrieved December 1,\n2009.\n\nDifferent news organizations declare a person the presumptive nominee based on\ntheir own standards. Not all news organizations use the term, other phrases such\nas 'apparent nominee' and 'presumed nominee' have been used. Zimmer, Ben\n(June 10, 2008) [http://www.visualthesaurus.com/cm/wordroutes/1423/ \"The\nPresumptive Nominee, I Presume?\"], Thinkmap Visual Thesaurus. Retrieved December\n1, 2009.\n\nIn the U.S. presidential elections, the selection of delegates has been\nincreasingly shifted earlier in the process to produce a presumptive nominee as\nearly as possible, even in the presence of many strong candidates. The rise of\nSuper Tuesday in the 1980s has led to the emergence of a presumptive nominee in\nboth major parties by early March in all recent elections with the exception of\n2008, when a spirited contest between Democratic Party candidates Hillary Rodham\nClinton and Barack Obama made it impossible for Obama to secure enough delegates\nto become the presumptive nominee until early June. George W. Bush and Al Gore\nwere the presumptive nominees of their respective parties after Super Tuesday in\n2000, Raasch, Chuck. (March 7, 2000)\n[http://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/e1323.htm November contest looks like Gore\nvs. Bush], Gannett News Service. USA Today. and John Kerry was referred to\nas the presumptive nominee for the Democratic Party by May 2004. (May 5,\n2004) [http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/03/12/main/index.html Kerry strikes\nback at Bush on ads], CNN. In May 2012, the Republican National Committee\nformally declared Mitt Romney the presumptive nominee for the Republican Party\nprior to his having received the minimum number of pledged delegates needed to\nclinch the nomination.\n\nIn presidential elections when an incumbent is seeking reelection, the incumbent\nis traditionally his or her party's presumptive nominee. Recent examples include\nRonald Reagan in 1984, Bill Clinton in 1996, George W. Bush in 2004, and Barack\nObama in 2012. However, a strong challenger or a President with low approval\nratings can negate that status: examples in recent history include Republican\nPresident Gerald Ford, who faced a challenge from Reagan in 1976, and Democratic\nPresident Jimmy Carter, challenged by Ted Kennedy in 1980. Despite such\nhistorical precedences, it is traditionally frowned upon for a candidate to\nchallenge an incumbent for the party nomination.\n","linknr":129,"url":"Presumptive_nominee","recorded":1363130129,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Presumptive_nominee&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Presumptive_nominee&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","/favicon.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/Politics_of_the_United_States","/wiki/Candidate","/wiki/Nomination","/wiki/Usurper","/wiki/Political_party","/wiki/United_States_presidential_nominating_convention","/wiki/Primary_election","/wiki/Caucus","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Running_mate","/wiki/U.S._state","#cite_note-2","#cite_note-3","/wiki/United_States_presidential_election","/wiki/Super_Tuesday","/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_2008","/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)_presidential_primaries,_2008","/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)","/wiki/Hillary_Rodham_Clinton","/wiki/Barack_Obama","/wiki/George_W._Bush","/wiki/Al_Gore","/wiki/Super_Tuesday","/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_2000","#cite_note-4","/wiki/John_Kerry","/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)_presidential_primaries,_2004","#cite_note-5","/wiki/Republican_National_Committee","/wiki/Mitt_Romney","#cite_note-6","/wiki/Incumbent","/wiki/Ronald_Reagan","/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1984","/wiki/Bill_Clinton","/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1996","/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_2004","/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_2012","/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)","/wiki/Gerald_Ford","/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)_presidential_primaries,_1976","/wiki/Jimmy_Carter","/wiki/Ted_Kennedy","/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)_presidential_primaries,_1980","/w/index.php?title=Presumptive_nominee&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","/wiki/Larry_Sabato","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0-8160-5875-X,_9780816058754","#cite_ref-2","http://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUSN0446485720080304","#cite_ref-3","/wiki/Ben_Zimmer","http://www.visualthesaurus.com/cm/wordroutes/1423/","#cite_ref-4","http://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/e1323.htm","#cite_ref-5","http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/03/12/main/index.html","#cite_ref-6","http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-pn-rnc-officially-names-mitt-romney-the-partys-presumptive-nominee-20120425,0,790798.story?track=rss&utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+latimes%2Fnews%2Fpolitics+(L.A.+Times+-+Politics)","/wiki/Los_Angeles_Times","http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-pn-rnc-officially-names-mitt-romney-the-partys-presumptive-nominee-20120425,0,790798.story?track=rss&utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+latimes%2Fnews%2Fpolitics+(L.A.+Times+-+Politics)","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Presumptive_nominee&oldid=532084018","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:United_States_presidential_elections_terminology","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Presumptive+nominee&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Presumptive+nominee","/wiki/Presumptive_nominee","/wiki/Talk:Presumptive_nominee","#","/wiki/Presumptive_nominee","/w/index.php?title=Presumptive_nominee&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Presumptive_nominee&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Presumptive_nominee","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Presumptive_nominee","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Presumptive_nominee&oldid=532084018","/w/index.php?title=Presumptive_nominee&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Presumptive_nominee&id=532084018","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Presumptive+nominee","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Presumptive+nominee&oldid=532084018&writer=rl","/
