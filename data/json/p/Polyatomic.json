Areas coloured red\n are lower in energy than areas coloured yellow.]]\n\nA 'polyatomic ion', also known as a 'molecular ion', is a charged species (ion)\ncomposed of two or more atoms covalently bonded or of a metal complex that can\nbe considered to be acting as a single unit in the context of acid and base\nchemistry or in the formation of salts. The prefix \"poly-\" means \"many,\" in\nGreek, but even ions of two atoms are commonly referred to as polyatomic. In\nolder literature, a polyatomic ion is also referred to as a '[[radical\n(chemistry)|radical]]', and less commonly, as a 'radical group'. In contemporary\nusage, the term radical refers to free radicals that are (not necessarily\ncharged) species with an unpaired electron.\n\nFor example, a hydroxide ion is made of one oxygen atom and one hydrogen atom:\nits chemical formula is () â . It has a charge of â1. An ammonium ion\nis made up of one nitrogen atom and four hydrogen atoms: Its chemical formula is\n() +. It has charge of +1.\n\nA polyatomic ion can often be considered as the conjugate acid or conjugate base\nof a neutral molecule. For example, the sulfate anion, 2â , is derived\nfrom H 2SO 4, which can be regarded as SO 3 +\nH 2O.\n","linknr":192,"url":"Polyatomic","recorded":1362897180,"links":29,"instances":["element","chemistry","chemistry","chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Ions"],"headings":["Nomenclature","Examples of common polyatomic ions","See also","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/Nitrate-ion-elpot.png/200px-Nitrate-ion-elpot.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8e/Chloride-ion-3D-vdW.png/50px-Chloride-ion-3D-vdW.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/Hypochlorite-ion-3D-vdW.png/70px-Hypochlorite-ion-3D-vdW.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Chlorite-ion-3D-vdW.png/70px-Chlorite-ion-3D-vdW.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/75/Chlorate-ion-3D-vdW.png/70px-Chlorate-ion-3D-vdW.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/Perchlorate-ion-3D-vdW.png/70px-Perchlorate-ion-3D-vdW.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["complex","chemistry"],["base","chemistry"],["salt","chemistry"],["mercury","element"],["salt","chemistry"]],"members":["mercury","salt","base","complex"],"related":["Nitrate_ion","Nitrogen","Oxygen","Chemical_species","Ion","Covalent_bond","Complex_(chemistry)","Acid","Base_(chemistry)","Chemistry","Salt_(chemistry)","Free_radical","Hydroxide","Elementary_charge","Ammonium","Conjugate_acid","Sulfate","Sulfuric_acid","Sulfur_trioxide","Water","Oxide","Nonmetal","Sulfate","Chlorine","Oxyanion","Chloride","Hypochlorite","Chlorite","Chlorate","Perchlorate","Anion","Acetate","Acetylide","Benzoate","Carbonate","Chromate_and_dichromate","Citrate","Cyanide","Hypochlorite","Chlorite","Chlorate","Perchlorate","Chromate_and_dichromate","Dihydrogen_phosphate","Bicarbonate","Bisulfate","Bicarbonate","Hydroxide","Nitrite","Nitrate","Peroxide","Permanganate","Phosphate","Sulfite","Sulfate","Cation","Ammonium","Phosphonium","Hydronium","Fluoronium","Mercury_(element)","Tropylium_cation","Monatomic_ion","Salt_(chemistry)","Mass_spectrometry","Hydrogen_peroxide","Molecule","Dihydrogen_cation","Protein_Data_Bank"]}
