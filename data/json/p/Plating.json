{"cursor":"15035","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n'Plating' is a surface covering in which a metal is deposited on a conductive\nsurface. Plating has been done for hundreds of years, but it is also critical\nfor modern technology. Plating is used to decorate objects, for corrosion\ninhibition, to improve solderability, to harden, to improve wearability, to\nreduce friction, to improve paint adhesion, to alter conductivity, for radiation\nshielding, and for other purposes. Jewelery typically uses plating to give a\nsilver or gold finish. '[[Thin-film deposition]] has plated objects as small as\nan atom' (Citation needed), therefore plating finds uses in nanotechnology.\n\nThere are several plating methods, and many variations. In one method, a solid\nsurface is covered with a metal sheet, and then heat and pressure are applied to\nfuse them (a version of this is Sheffield plate). Other plating techniques\ninclude vapor deposition under vacuum and sputter deposition. Recently, plating\noften refers to using liquids. Metallizing refers to coating metal on non-\nmetallic objects.\n","linknr":386,"url":"Plating","recorded":1362484284,"links":28,"instances":["corrosion"],"pdf":["http://www.schnarr.eu/en/files/SCHNARR_EN_Kanigen.pdf","http://nanomatetech.com/Download/Eco-friendly-coating-FastenerInt'l-2009-10.pdf"],"categories":["Coatings","Industrial processes","Metal plating|","Thin film deposition"],"headings":["Electroplating","Electroless plating","Specific cases","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/KeilwerthAltoSax.JPG/220px-KeilwerthAltoSax.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["red_plague","corrosion"]],"members":["red_plague"],"related":["Metal","Conductive","Jewelery","Silver","Gold","Nanotechnology","Sheffield_plate","Vapor_deposition","Vacuum","Sputter_deposition","Metallizing","Ion","Electrons","Anode","Soluble","Insoluble","Cathode","Catalytic","Galvanization","Aqueous_solution","Hydrogen","Sodium_hypophosphite","Electroless_nickel_plating","Angel_gilding","Gold_plating","Copper","Corrosion","Electrical_connector","Printed_circuit_board","Barrier_metal","Electrical_resistance","Skin_effect","Variable_capacitor","Audiophile","Humidity","Galvanic_corrosion","Red_plague_(corrosion)","Cutlery","Sheffield_Plate","Tollens'_reagent","Tollens'_reagent","Aldehyde","Sulfuric_acid","Electroplating","Chromium","Nickel","Mirror","Friction","Zinc","Oxidation","Zinc_oxide","Iron_oxide","Aluminum","Stainless_steel","Oxide","Tin","Ferrous","Nonferrous","Food_processing","Ductility","Steel","Electronics","Lead","ROHS","Solid_solution_strengthening","Precipitation_hardening","Heat_treatment","Metal_matrix_composite","Tungsten_carbide","Silicon_carbide","Chromium_carbide","Cadmium","Cadmium_poisoning","Malleability","Stick-slip","Torque","Lubricity","Polytetrafluoroethylene","Anodization","Hull_cell","Mechanical_plating","Organic_Solderability_Preservative"]}
