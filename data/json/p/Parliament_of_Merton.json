Merton), sometimes also known as the 'Ancient Statute of Merton', is\nconsidered to be the first English\nstatute, [http://83.1911encyclopedia.org/S/ST/STATUTE.htm Statute -\nLoveToKnow 1911 ] and is printed as the first\nstatute in [[The Statutes of the Realm]].\n\nThe statute's terms were agreed at Merton between Henry III [http://chi.gospelcom.net/DAILYF/2002/05/daily-05-03-\n2002.shtml May 3: Merton Priory; Christian History Institute ] and the barons of England in the 20th year of Henry's reign\n(1235). It was another instance, along with the Magna Carta twenty years\npreviously, of the struggle between the barons and the king to limit the\nlatter's rights.\n\nAmongst its provisions, the statute allowed a Lord of the Manor to enclose\ncommon land (provided that sufficient pasture remained for his tenants), and\nset out when and how manorial lords could assert rights over waste land,\nwoods, and pastures against their\ntenants. [http://www.bopcris.ac.uk/bop1700/ref13697.html BopCris].\nIt quickly became a basis for English common law, developing and clarifying\nlegal concepts of\nownership, [http://www.bilderberg.org/land/levitcus.htm Returning land\nto its rightful owner ] and was one of the\nEnglish statutes carried over into the law of the Lordship of Ireland.\n\nIn January 1550, in Edward VI's reign, long after the Statute had fallen out of\nuse, it was revived under John Dudley, the Duke of Northumberland, to enable\nlords to enclose their land at their own discretion â out of keeping with the\ntraditional Tudor anti-enclosure attitude.\n\nThe Statute also dealt with illegitimacy [http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/-\nprod/web/common.nsf/key/HistoryBeforeEuropeanSettlement Resources - 1788 -\nBefore European Settlement ]. â stating that He\nis a bastard that is born before the marriage of his parents. It also dealt with\nwomen's rights â dowries (A woman shall recover damages in a writ of dower), and\nwidows' right to bequeath land (Widows may bequeath the crop of their\nlands). http://djs.state.md.us/megafile/msa/speccol/sc2900/sc2908-\n/000001/000143/html/am143--262.html\n\nChapter 4 of this statute was the Commons Act 1236.\n\nChapters 1 and 2 and 9 were repealed for the Republic of Ireland by\n[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1965/en/act/pub/0027/sec0008.html section 8] of,\nand Part I of [http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1965/en/act/pub/0027/sched2.html\nSchedule 2] to, the Succession Act 1965, subject to the savings in\n[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1965/en/act/pub/0027/sec0009.html section 9] of\nthat Act.
