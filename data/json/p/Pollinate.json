Its two gametes travel down the\ntube to where the gametophyte(s) containing the female gametes are held within\nthe carpel. One nucleus fuses with the polar bodies to produce the endosperm\ntissues, and the other with the ovum to produce the embryo Fritsch, Felix\nEugene; Salisbury, Edward James; An introduction to the structure and\nreproduction of plants.

Publisher:\nJones & Bartlett, 2008 ISBN 978-0-7637-5345-0 Hence the term: \"double\nfertilization\".\n\nIn gymnosperms the ovule is not contained in a carpel, but exposed on the\nsurface of a dedicated support organ such as the scale of a cone, so that the\npenetration of carpel tissue is unnecessary. Details of the process vary\naccording to the division of Gymnosperms in question.\n\nThe receptive part of the carpel is called a [[carpel|stigma]] in the flowers of\nangiosperms. The receptive part of the gymnosperm ovule is called the\n[[micropyle]]. Pollination is a necessary step in the reproduction of flowering\nplants, resulting in the production of offspring that are genetically diverse.\n\nThe study of pollination brings together many disciplines, such as botany,\nhorticulture, entomology, and ecology. The pollination process as an interaction\nbetween flower and vector was first addressed in the 18th century by Christian\nKonrad Sprengel. It is important in horticulture and agriculture, because\nfruiting is dependent on fertilisation, which is the result of pollination.\n","linknr":519,"url":"Pollinate","recorded":1362509363,"links":80,"instances":["agriculture","biology","beekeeping","biology","botanist","barrier","science","biology","fruit","biology","ecology","honeybee"],"pdf":["http://www.fs.fed.us/wildflowers/pollinators/documents/factsheet_pollinator.pdf"],"categories":["Pollination","Horticulture
