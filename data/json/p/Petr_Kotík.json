{"cursor":"8485","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Petr Kotik' (surname originally 'KotÃ­k') (b. January 27, 1942 in Prague) is a\ncomposer, conductor and flutist living in New York City. He was educated in\nEurope (Prague Conservatory, graduated 1961; Vienna Music Academy, graduated\n1966; AMU Prague, graduated 1969). From 1960 to 1963, Kotik studied composition\nprivately with Jan RychlÃ­k in Prague, and from 1963 to 1966 at the Music Academy\nin Vienna with Karl Schieske, Hans Jelinek, and Friedrich Cerha. In Prague, he\nfounded and directed Musica Viva Pragensis (1961â64) and the QUAX Ensemble\n(1966â69). He came to the United States in 1969 at the invitation of Lukas Foss\nand Lejaren Hiller to join the Center for Creative and Performing Arts at the\nUniversity at Buffalo.\n\nSince 1983, Kotik has been living in New York City. Kotik is the founder and\nArtistic Director of the S.E.M. Ensemble,\nbased in New York City, which presents both chamber and orchestra concerts.\nKotik has received numerous commissions and composition grants, from the\nNational Endowment for the Arts, among others, and in 1996, he received the\nprestigious composition award from Foundation for Contemporary Arts. He is also\nknown for his realization of the complete musical works of Marcel Duchamp.\n\nWith the S.E.M. Ensemble (which he founded in 1970), Kotik has for many years\nactively promoted the work of other (mostly American) composers sharing a\nstylistic affinity with his own work, giving frequent performances as conductor\nand performer with the group as well as its larger version, the Orchestra of the\nS.E.M. Ensemble.\n\nKotik's music is composed in the minimal vein, with works often being of long\nduration and featuring slow tempi and quiet dynamics. Though his works feature\ninnumerable gradual, slight changes, giving them a seemingly static quality, his\nharmonies, however, are more complex than those employed by many other American\nminimal composers, and his musical process is not as apparent to the listener\nas, for example, in the works of Steve Reich or Philip Glass. Further, Kotik\ndoes not draw as heavily on jazz or rock in his works as do many of his American\ncolleagues (though, like Steve Reich, he is quite interested in Medieval music\nand often integrates Medieval compositional techniques into his works). These\nqualities set Kotik's music apart from American minimal trends, giving his music\na decidedly European character more similar in outlook to, for example, that of\nHungarian minimalists such as ZoltÃ¡n Jeney, LÃ¡szlÃ³ SÃ¡ry, or LÃ¡szlÃ³ Vidovszky.\n\nAmong Kotik's best known works is the six-hour opera Many Many Women (1976â78),\nbased on a text by Gertrude Stein, for whose work, appropriately, Kotik has a\nspecial affinity.\n\nAs a performer, Kotik has been an active chamber musician throughout much of his\nlife. Until 1992, Kotik did not have the slightest interest in orchestra. That\nchanged in 1992, when he conducted Atlas Eclipticalis by John Cage with the 86-\npiece Orchestra of the S.E.M. Ensemble in Tribute to John Cage at Carnegie Hall,\nwith David Tudor as the soloist. Since then, Kotik has been organizing large-\nscale events, expanding the S.E.M. Ensemble into The Orchestra of the S.E.M.\nEnsemble, and encouraging and commissioning other composers to write for\norchestra. In 1999, after conducting Gruppen by Karlheinz Stockhausen, Kotik\ninitiated a project of compositions for 3 orchestras and commissioned the\ncreation of new 3-orchestra works by Alvin Lucier, Christian Wolff, Martin\nSmolka, Phill Niblock and Olga Neuwirth. In 2001, Kotik founded the biennial\nOstrava Days, an Institute and Festival of New Music in Ostrava, Czech Republic.\nThis three-week program, one of the largest in existence, focuses on works for\norchestra, with 2 resident orchestras and number of resident composers, chamber\nmusic groups and soloists.\n\nAlthough Kotik entered the conservatory at the age of 14, he only began\ncomposing in his late teens. This was due to his lack of interest in classical\nharmony, a tendency shared with other composers such as Christian Wolff and John\nCage. As a composer, Kotik is essentially self-taught, in spite of his education\nin composition fundamentals in Prague and Vienna. His technique has very little\nto do with commonly-used compositional methods.\n\nKotik's compositional system can be compared to a game in which the use of\ncontrolled chance is balanced by conscious decision-making. The two alternate,\none influencing the other. In this way Kotik triggers unpredictable processes\nwhile the work progresses in the envisioned direction. In recent years, Kotik\nhas relied increasingly on intuitive gestures. The strategies and limitations\nKotik imposes on chance, along with intuitive decisions, are at the root of his\ncompositional process.\n\nAmong Kotik's best-known compositions are Music for 3 (1964) for piano and 2\nstrings; Spontano (1964) for piano and ensemble (composed for Frederic Rzewski);\nKontrabandt (1967), a live electronic work commissioned by the WDR Electronic\nMusic Studio; Many Many Women (1975â78) on a text by Gertrude Stein; and Letters\nto Olga (1988â91) on a text by VÃ¡clav Havel. His orchestra pieces include:\nQuiescent Form (1994â96); the one-hour long Music in Two Movements (1998â2002);\nVariations for 3 Orchestras (2002â2005); and Spheres and Attraction (2005â2006)\nfor 2 voices, string quartet and percussion on a text by R. Buckminster Fuller.\n\n\"Kotikâs massive and too modestly named Fragment (1st movement of Music in\nTwo Movements), which he conducted with his SEM Orchestra gives me sufficient\npretext to voice the overdue sentiment that he is one of the best composers\nworking today...among those writing abstract works for ensembles of\nunconventional instruments, Kotik stands very near the top and possibly at\nthe top. He produced some of the most durable, though still little-known\nmusical monuments of the post-Cage 70s, and his output has been amazingly\nconsistent in quality.â (New York music critic and composer Kyle Gann, The\nVillage Voice 1998).\n\nKotik's music is available on the Labor, Dog w/a Bone and Ear-Rational labels.\n\nHe is married to the curator and art historian Charlotta Kotik, great-\ngranddaughter of TomÃ¡Å¡ Garrigue Masaryk, and has a son, Tomas (Tom), who is a\nNew York-based sculptor. His other son, Jan Jakub Kotik, was born in 1972 and\ndied of cancer in 2007.\n","linknr":153,"url":"Petr_Kotík","recorded":1375067793,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Petr_Kotik&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Petr_Kotik&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","/wiki/Petr_Kotik","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","/w/index.php?title=Petr_Kot%C3%ADk&redirect=no","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:What_Wikipedia_is_not#PUBLISHER","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Petr_Kotik&action=edit","/wiki/Wikipedia:Encyclopedic_style","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Avoid_peacock_terms","/wiki/Prague","/wiki/Composer","/wiki/New_York_City","/wiki/Prague_Conservatory","/wiki/Jan_Rychl%C3%ADk","/wiki/Friedrich_Cerha","/wiki/Lukas_Foss","/wiki/Lejaren_Hiller","/wiki/University_at_Buffalo,_The_State_University_of_New_York","#cite_note-Ross_NYT-1","#cite_note-2","/wiki/S.E.M._Ensemble","/wiki/National_Endowment_for_the_Arts","/wiki/Foundation_for_Contemporary_Arts","/wiki/Marcel_Duchamp","/wiki/Minimalist_music","/wiki/Process_music","/wiki/Steve_Reich","/wiki/Philip_Glass","/wiki/Jazz","/wiki/Rock_and_roll","/wiki/Medieval_music","/wiki/Zolt%C3%A1n_Jeney","/wiki/L%C3%A1szl%C3%B3_S%C3%A1ry","/wiki/L%C3%A1szl%C3%B3_Vidovszky","/wiki/Gertrude_Stein","/wiki/John_Cage","/wiki/Carnegie_Hall","/wiki/David_Tudor","/wiki/Karlheinz_Stockhausen","/wiki/Alvin_Lucier","/wiki/Christian_Wolff_(composer)","/wiki/Martin_Smolka","/wiki/Phill_Niblock","/wiki/Olga_Neuwirth","/w/index.php?title=Ostrava_Days&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Ostrava","/wiki/Frederic_Rzewski","/wiki/Gertrude_Stein","/wiki/V%C3%A1clav_Havel","/wiki/R._Buckminster_Fuller","/wiki/Kyle_Gann","/wiki/The_Village_Voice","/wiki/Tom%C3%A1%C5%A1_Garrigue_Masaryk","/wiki/Jan_Jakub_Kot%C3%ADk","/w/index.php?title=Petr_Kotik&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-Ross_NYT_1-0","http://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/01/arts/music-review-czechs-celebrate-traditions-of-the-other-classical-crucible.html?pagewanted=1","#cite_ref-2","http://www.newmusicostrava.cz/en/press-reviews/sounds-like-now-59?akce=ostravske-dny&rok=2009","/w/index.php?title=Petr_Kotik&action=edit&section=2","http://www.pkotik.com/","http://www.musica.cz/skladatele/kotik-petr.html","http://www.semensemble.org/","http://www.ocnmh.cz/","http://www.moderecords.com/profiles/petrkotik.html","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/84045985","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Petr_Kotik&oldid=542629117","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1942_births","/wiki/Category:20th-century_classical_composers","/wiki/Category:21st-century_classical_composers","/wiki/Category:Czech_composers","/wiki/Category:Living_people","/wiki/Category:University_at_Buffalo_alumni","/wiki/Category:Contemporary_classical_music_performers","/wiki/Category:University_of_Music_and_Performing_Arts,_Vienna_alumni","/wiki/Category:Prague_Conservatory_alumni","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_needing_style_editing_from_June_2010","/wiki/Category:All_articles_needing_style_editing","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_peacock_terms_from_June_2010","/wiki/Category:All_articles_with_peacock_terms","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Petr+Kotik&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Petr+Kotik","/wiki/Petr_Kotik","/wiki/Talk:Petr_Kotik","#","/wiki/Petr_Kotik","/w/index.php?title=Petr_Kotik&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Petr_Kotik&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wik
