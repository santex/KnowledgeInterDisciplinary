{"cursor":"21041","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Proteolysis' is the breakdown of proteins into smaller polypeptides or amino\nacids. This generally occurs by the hydrolysis of the peptide bond, and is most\ncommonly achieved by cellular enzymes called proteases, but may also occur by\nintramolecular digestion, as well as by non-enzymatic methods such as the action\nof mineral acids and heat.\n\nProteolysis in organisms serves many purposes; for example, digestive enzymes\nbreak down proteins in food to provide amino acids for the organism, while\nproteolytic processing of polypeptide chain after its synthesis may be necessary\nfor the production of an active protein. It is also important in the regulation\nof some physiological and cellular processes, as well as preventing the\naccumulation of unwanted or abnormal proteins in cells.\n","linknr":502,"url":"Proteolysis","recorded":1362666637,"links":34,"instances":["proteomics","biology","biotechnology","biology"],"pdf":["http://pt7mdv.ceingebi.unam.mx/computo/pdfs/ubiquita/enfermedades.pdf","http://pt7mdv.ceingebi.unam.mx/computo/pdfs/ubiquita/enfermedades.pdf"],"categories":["Posttranslational modification","Metabolism","EC 3.4"],"headings":["Post-translational proteolytic processing","Protein degradation","Proteolysis in cellular regulation","Regulatory domains in proteolysis","Proteolysis and diseases","Non-enzymatic proteolysis","Laboratory applications","Venoms","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/54/Proteaosome_1fnt_side.png/150px-Proteaosome_1fnt_side.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["translation","biology"],["virus","biology"],["protein_expression","biotechnology"],["protomap","proteomics"]],"members":["protomap","translation","protein_expression","virus"],"related":["Protein","Polypeptide","Amino_acids","Peptide_bond","Enzyme","Protease","Digestive_enzymes","Translation_(biology)","Protein_biosynthesis","N-terminal","Methionine","Signal_peptide","Proprotein","Albumin","FMet","Prokaryotes","Eukaryotes","N-end_rule","Signal_peptide","Cell_membrane","Pro-opiomelanocortin","Virus_(biology)","Polycistronic","Zymogen","Proenzyme","Prehormone","Insulin","Disulphide_bonds","Trypsinogen","Trypsin","Blood_clotting_cascade","Complement_system","Immune_response","Lysosome","Ubiquitin","Proteasome","Autophagy","Cathepsins","Ornithine_decarboxylase","Actin","Myosin","Haemoglobin","Erythrocyte","N-end_rule","Proline","Glutamine","Serine","Threonine","PEST_sequence","Asparagine","Cystein","Histidine","Digestion","Digestive_enzymes","Pepsin","Trypsin","Chymotrypsin","Elastase","Carboxypeptidase","Aminopeptidase","Dipeptidase","Arginine","Lysine","Phenylalanine","Tyrosine","Tryptophan","Pepsin","Pepsinogen","Pancreas","Trypsin","Chymotrypsin","Trypsinogen","Enterokinase","Mucosa","Duodenum","Subtilisin","Protease-activated_receptor","Cyclins","Kinase","Mitosis","Cell_cycle","Anaphase","Caspase","Apoptosis","Apoptosome","Granzyme_B","Tumor_necrosis_factor_receptor","Prothrombin","Factor_IX","Factor_X","Factor_VIII","Protein_C","Calpain","Kringle_domain","Prothrombin","Pancreatitis","Pancreas","Diabetes_mellitus","Rheumatoid_arthritis","Alzheimer","Muscular_dystrophy","Malignancy","Cyanogen_bromide","Tryptophan","Aspartyl","Cysteinyl","Asparagin","Trifluoroacetic_acid","Formic_acid","Mineral_acids","Ribonuclease_A","Sulphuric_acid","Fusion_protein","Protein_tag","Protein_expression_(biotechnology)","Protein_purification","Thrombin","Enterokinase","TEV_protease","Proteinase_K","Urea","Sodium_dodecyl_sulfate","Nucleic_acids","Nuclease","DNA_polymerase_I","Subtilisin","Klenow_fragment","In-gel_digestion","Proteins","Gel_electrophoresis","Mass_spectrometry","Proteomics","Liquid_chromatography-mass_spectrometry","Snake","Cytotoxin","Hemotoxin","Myotoxin","Hemorrhage","Proteolytic_enzyme","The_Proteolysis_Map","Protomap_(proteomics)","Proteasome","In-gel_digestion"]}
