{"cursor":"46306","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" tests (13 April 1955).]]\n\n'Public health' is \"the science and art of preventing disease, prolonging life\nand promoting health through the organized efforts and informed choices of\nsociety, organizations, public and private, communities and individuals\" (1920,\nC.E.A. Winslow). It is concerned with threats to health based on\npopulation health analysis. The population in question can be as small as a\nhandful of people or as large as all the inhabitants of several continents (for\ninstance, in the case of a pandemic). The dimensions of health can encompass \"a\nstate of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the\nabsence of disease or infirmity\", as defined by the United Nations' World Health\nOrganization. [http://www.who.int/suggestions/faq/en/ Frequently asked\nquestions] from the \"Preamble to the Constitution of the World Health\nOrganization\" as adopted by the International Health Conference, 1946\nPublic health incorporates the interdisciplinary approaches of epidemiology,\nbiostatistics and health services. Environmental health, community health,\nbehavioral health, health economics, public policy, insurance medicine and\noccupational health (respectively occupational medicine) are other important\nsubfields.\n\nThe focus of public health intervention is to improve health and quality of life\nthrough the prevention and treatment of disease and other physical and mental\nhealth conditions, through surveillance of cases and the promotion of healthy\nbehaviors. Promotion of hand washing and breastfeeding, delivery of\nvaccinations, and distribution of condoms to control the spread of sexually\ntransmitted diseases are examples of common public health measures.\n\nModern public health practice requires multidisciplinary teams of professionals\nincluding physicians specializing in public health/community medicine/infectious\ndisease, epidemiologists, biostatisticians, public health nurses, medical\nmicrobiologists, environmental health officers / public health inspectors,\ndental hygienists, dietitians and nutritionists, veterinarians, public health\nengineers, public health lawyers, sociologists, community development workers,\ncommunications experts, and others.\n","linknr":770,"url":"Public_Health","recorded":1362505335,"links":70,"instances":["physician","epidemiology","public_health"],"pdf":["http://governmentfutures.com/images/stories/documents/PublicHealth2-0NotesPRINT.pdf","http://governmentfutures.com/images/stories/documents/PublicHealth2-0NotesPRINT.pdf","http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/PDF/wk/mm4850.pdf","http://www.deltaomega.org/documents/WelchRose.pdf","http://www.deltaomega.org/documents/WelchRose.pdf","http://www.ceph.org/pdf/Master_List.pdf","http://www.ceph.org/pdf/Master_List.pdf"],"categories":["Public
