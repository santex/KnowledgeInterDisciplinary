Pragmatism is a rejection of the idea that the function of thought is to\ndescribe, represent, or mirror reality. Instead, pragmatists develop their\nphilosophy around the idea that the function of thought is as an instrument or\ntool for prediction, action, and problem solving. Pragmatists contend that most\nphilosophical topics--such as the nature of knowledge, language, concepts,\nmeaning, belief, and science--are all best viewed in terms of their practical\nuses and successes rather than in terms of representative accuracy.\n\nA few of the various but interrelated positions often characteristic of\nphilosophers working from a pragmatist approach include:\n\n*Anti-representationalism; any view in philosophy of language that rejects\nanalyzing the semantic meaning of propositions, mental states, and statements in\nterms of a correspondence or representational relationship and instead analyzes\nsemantic meaning in terms of notions like dispositions to action, inferential\nrelationships, and/or functional roles (e.g. behaviorism and inferentialism).\nNot to be confused with pragmatics, a sub-field of linguistics with no relation\nto philosophical pragmatism.\n\n*Coherentist theory of justification; a rejection of the epistemological claim\nthat all knowledge and justified belief rest ultimately on a foundation of\nnoninferential knowledge or justified belief. Coherentists hold that\njustification is solely a function of some relationship between beliefs, none of\nwhich are privileged beliefs in the way maintained by foundationalists theories\nof justification.\n\n*Deflationary or pragmatist theories of truth; the former is the epistemological\nclaim that assertions that predicate truth of a statement do not attribute a\nproperty called truth to such a statement while the later is the epistemological\nclaim that assertions that predicate truth of a statement attribute the property\nof useful-to-believe to such a statement.\n\n*Empiricism; the broad epistemological assertion that knowledge comes only or\nprimarily from sensory experience; contrary to rationalism.\n\n*Fallibilism; the epistemological principle that human beings could be wrong\nabout their beliefs, expectations, or their understanding of the world, and yet\nstill be justified in holding their incorrect beliefs.\n\n*Instrumentalism; the view in the philosophy of science that a scientific\nconcept or theory should be evaluated by how effectively it explains and\npredicts phenomena, as opposed to how accurately it describes objective reality.\n\n*Pluralism; a view in metaphysics and epistemology that there is more than one\nsound way to conceptualize the world and its content.\n\n*Verificationism; the view that a statement or question is only legitimate if\nthere is some way to determine whether the statement is true or false, or what\nthe answer to the question is.\n\nCharles Sanders Peirce (and his pragmatic maxim) deserves much of the credit for\npragmatism,<ref name=\"HaackLane2006\">{{cite book| author1=Susan\nHaack|author2=Robert Edwin Lane|title=Pragmatism, old & new: selected writings|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=f-\nDWAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=12 February 2011|date=11 April 2006| publisher=Prometheus\nBooks|isbn=978-1-59102-359-3|pages=18–67}}</ref> along with later twentieth\ncentury contributors, William James and John Dewey.<ref\nname=\"BiestaBurbules\">Biesta, G.J.J. & Burbules,\nN. (2003). Pragmatism and educational research. Lanham, MD: Rowman and\n   Littlefield.</ref> Pragmatism enjoyed renewed attention after\nO. V. O. Quine and Wilfrid Sellars used a revised pragmatism to criticize\n   logical positivism in the 1960s. Inspired by the work of Quine and Sellars, a\n   brand of pragmatism known sometimes as neopragmatism gained influence through\n   Richard Rorty, the most influential of the late twentieth century pragmatists\n   along with Hilary Putnam and Robert Brandom. Contemporary pragmatism may be\n   broadly divided into a strict analytic tradition and a \"neo-classical\"\n   pragmatism (such as Susan Haack) that adheres to the work of Peirce, James,\n   and Dewey.\n\nThe word pragmatism derives from Greek πρᾶγμα (pragma), \"deed, act\",<ref>\n[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext\n%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dpra%3Dgma πρᾶγμα], Henry George Liddell,\nRobert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus</ref> which comes from πράσσω\n(prassō), \"to pass over, to practise, to\nachieve\".<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus\n%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dpra%2Fssw πράσσω], Henry George\nLiddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus</ref> The word\n\"Pragmatism\" as a piece of technical terminology in philosophy refers to a\nspecific set of associated philosophical views originating in the late twentieth-\ncentury. However, the phrase is often confused with \"pragmatism\" in the context\nof politics (which refers to politics or diplomacy based primarily on practical\nconsiderations, rather than ideological notions.) and with a non- technical use\nof \"pragmatism\" in ordinary contexts referring to dealing with matters in one's\nlife realistically and in a way that is based on practical rather than abstract\nconsiderations.\n","title":"Pragmatism","headings":["Origins","Summary","Central pragmatist tenets","Pragmatism in other fields of philosophy","Analytical, neoclassical, and
