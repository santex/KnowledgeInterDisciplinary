{"cursor":"16109","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Primitive reflexes' are reflex actions originating in the central nervous\nsystem that are exhibited by normal infants, but not neurologically intact\nadults, in response to particular stimuli. These reflexes disappear or are\ninhibited by the frontal lobes as a child moves through normal child\ndevelopment. These primitive reflexes are also called 'infantile',\n'infant' or 'newborn reflexes'.\n\nOlder children and adults with atypical neurology (e.g. people with cerebral\npalsy) may retain these reflexes and primitive reflexes may reappear in adults.\nReappearance may be attributed to certain neurological conditions including, but\nnot limited to, dementia, traumatic lesions, and strokes.\nAn individual with cerebral palsy and typical intelligence can learn to suppress\nthese reflexes, but the reflex might resurface under certain conditions (i.e.\nduring extreme startle reaction). Reflexes may also be limited to those areas\naffected by the atypical neurology, (i.e. individuals with cerebral palsy that\nonly affects their legs retaining the Babinski reflex but having normal speech);\nfor those individuals with hemiplegia, the reflex may be seen in the foot on the\naffected side only.\n\nPrimitive reflexes are primarily tested with suspected brain injury for the\npurpose of assessing frontal lobe functioning. If they are not being suppressed\nproperly they are called frontal release signs. Atypical primitive reflexes are\nalso being researched as potential early warning signs of autistic spectrum\ndisorders.\n","linknr":354,"url":"Primitive_reflexes","recorded":1362483462,"links":29,"instances":["physiology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Reflexes","Pediatrics"],"headings":["Adaptive value of reflexes","Moro reflex","Walking/stepping reflex","Rooting reflex","Sucking reflex","Tonic neck reflex","Palmar grasp reflex","Plantar reflex","Galant reflex","Swimming reflex","Babkin reflex","Other primitive reflexes tested in adults","Primitive reflexes in high-risk newborns","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/58/Moro_reflex.jpg/200px-Moro_reflex.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/bf/Walking_reflex.jpg/80px-Walking_reflex.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/44/Rooting.jpg/100px-Rooting.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f1/Tonic.jpg/150px-Tonic.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/98/Grasp.jpg/90px-Grasp.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["stimulus","physiology"]],"members":["stimulus"],"related":["Reflex_action","Central_nervous_system","Infants","Stimulus_(physiology)","Frontal_lobe","Child_development","Neurology","Cerebral_palsy","Dementia","Lesion","Stroke","Startle_reaction","Plantar_reflex","Hemiplegia","Acquired_brain_injury","Frontal_release_signs","Autism","Startle_reaction","Moro_reflex","Pediatrician","Ernst_Moro","Central_nervous_system","Birth_trauma","Clavicle_fracture","Brachial_plexus","Erb's_palsy","Paralysis","Walk","Developmental_psychology","Breastfeeding","Developmental_psychology","Mammal","Nipple","Areola","Upper_motor_neuron","Developmental_psychology","Palmar_grasp","Joseph_Babinski","Myelination","Corticospinal_tract","Johann_Susman_Galant","Water_intoxication","Neurologist","Boris_Babkin","Frontal_release_signs","Palmomental_reflex","Snout_reflex","Glabellar_reflex","Apgar_score"]}
