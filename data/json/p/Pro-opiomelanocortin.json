POMC is synthesized from the 285-amino acid long polypeptide\nprecursor, pre-pro-opiomelanocortin (pre-POMC), by the removal of a 44-amino\nacid long signal peptide sequence during translation.\n\nThe POMC gene is located on chromosome 2p23.3. The POMC gene is expressed in\nboth the anterior and intermediate lobes of the pituitary gland. This gene\nencodes a 285-amino acid polypeptide hormone precursor that undergoes extensive,\ntissue-specific, post-translational processing via cleavage by subtilisin-like\nenzymes known as prohormone convertases. The encoded protein is synthesized\nmainly in corticotroph cells of the anterior pituitary where four cleavage sites\nare used; adrenocorticotrophin (ACTH), essential for normal steroidogenesis and\nthe maintenance of normal adrenal weight, and Î²-lipotropin are the major end\nproducts. However, there are at least eight potential cleavage sites within the\npolypeptide precursor and, depending on tissue type and the available\nconvertases, processing may yield as many as ten biologically active peptides\ninvolved in diverse cellular functions. Cleavage sites consist of the sequences,\nArg-Lys, Lys-Arg or Lys-Lys. Enzymes responsible for processing of POMC peptides\ninclude prohormone convertase 1 (PC1), prohormone convertase 2 (PC2),\ncarboxypeptidase E (CPE), peptidyl Î±-amidating monooxygenase (PAM), ''N''-\nacetyltransferase (N-AT), and prolylcarboxypeptidase (PRCP).\n\nThe processing of POMC involves glycosylations, acetylations, and extensive\nproteolytic cleavage at sites shown to contain regions of basic protein\nsequences. However, the proteases that recognize these cleavage sites are tissue-\nspecific. In some tissues, including the hypothalamus, placenta, and epithelium,\nall cleavage sites may be used, giving rise to peptides with roles in pain and\nenergy homeostasis, melanocyte stimulation, and immune modulation. These include\nseveral distinct melanotropins, lipotropins, and endorphins that are contained\nwithin the adrenocorticotrophin and Î²-lipotropin peptides.\n\nMutations in this gene have been associated with early onset obesity, adrenal\ninsufficiency, and red hair pigmentation. Alternatively spliced transcript\nvariants encoding the same protein have been described.\n","linknr":529,"url":"Pro-opiomelanocortin","recorded":1362484352,"links":25,"instances":["biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Neuropeptides","Neuroendocrinology"],"headings":["Production","Derivatives","Function","Interactions","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/71/PBB_GE_POMC_205720_at_tn.png/250px-PBB_GE_POMC_205720_at_tn.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/62/PD-icon.svg/12px-PD-icon.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["vesicle","biology"]],"members":["vesicle"],"related":["Polypeptide","Amino_acid","Subtilisin","Proprotein_convertase","Corticotrope","Pituitary","Adrenocorticotropic_hormone","Steroidogenesis","Lipotropin","Prohormone_convertase_1","Prohormone_convertase_2","Carboxypeptidase_E","Peptidylglycine_alpha-amidating_monooxygenase","N-acetyltransferase","PRCP","Hypothalamus","Placenta","Epithelium","Homeostasis","Melanocyte","Melanotropin","Lipotropin","Endorphin","Obesity","Adrenal_insufficiency","Red_hair","Pigmentation","Corticotrope","Anterior_pituitary","Melanotrope","Intermediate_lobe","Pituitary","Arcuate_nucleus","Hypothalamus","Dorsomedial_hypothalamus","Brainstem","Melanocytes","Peptides","N-Terminal_peptide_of_proopiomelanocortin","Melanocyte-stimulating_hormone","Corticotropin","Melanocyte-stimulating_hormone","Corticotropin-like_intermediate_peptide","Lipotropin","Melanocyte-stimulating_hormone","Beta-endorphin","Met-Enkephalin","Β-endorphin","Proenkephalin_A","Melanocyte-stimulating_hormone","Vesicle_(biology)","Exocytosis","Appetite","Human_sexual_activity","Melanin","Glucocorticoids","Adrenal_cortex","Β-endorphin","Opioid_peptides","Protein-protein_interaction","Melanocortin_4_receptor","Melanocortin","Afamelanotide","Melanotan_II"]}
