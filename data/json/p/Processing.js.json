It allows web\nbrowsers to display animations, visual applications, games and other graphical\nrich content without the need for a Java applet or Flash plugin.\n\nProcessing.js uses JavaScript to render 2D and 3D content on the HTML canvas\nelement, and is supported by browsers that have implemented this element (the\nlatest versions of Mozilla Firefox, Opera, Internet Explorer 9, Safari and\nGoogle Chrome).\n\nThe development of Processing.js was begun by John Resig and then picked-up by\nstudents at Seneca College after its initial release in 2008. A team of students\nfinished the port of Processing.js, fixing more than 900 bugs, shipping 12\nreleases, and creating a vibrant community in the process. The project was done\nthrough a partnership between the Mozilla Foundation and Seneca College, led by\nDavid Humphrey, Al MacDonald, and Corban Brook. The students continue to\nmaintain the project today.\n","linknr":149,"url":"Processing.js","recorded":1362477424,"links":13,"instances":["web_browser","web_browser","programming_language"],"pdf":[],"categories":["JavaScript visualization toolkits","Free computer libraries","JavaScript libraries"],"headings":["Use","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/59/Processing_Logo_Clipped.svg/180px-Processing_Logo_Clipped.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c1/Computer-aj_aj_ashton_01.svg/28px-Computer-aj_aj_ashton_01.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["processing","programming_language"],["opera","web_browser"],["safari","web_browser"]],"members":["safari","opera","processing"],"related":["John_Resig","JavaScript","Web_application_framework","MIT_License","JavaScript","Processing_(programming_language)","Java_applet","Flash_plugin","Canvas_element","Firefox","Opera_(web_browser)","Internet_Explorer_9","Safari_(web_browser)","Google_Chrome","John_Resig","Seneca_College","Mozilla_Foundation","Seneca_College","D3.js","JavaScript_InfoVis_Toolkit","Protovis","O'Reilly_Media","John_Wiley_&_Sons","O'Reilly_Media"]}
