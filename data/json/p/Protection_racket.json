{"cursor":"7023","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'protection racket' is an extortion scheme whereby a criminal group or\nindividual coerces a victim (usually a business) to pay money, supposedly for\nprotection services against violence or property damage. Racketeers coerce\nreticent potential victims into buying \"protection\" by demonstrating what will\nhappen if they don'tâthey damage the victims' property. In most cases, the\nracketeers do not actually protect their client from anything but the racketeers\nthemselves, and their \"protection\" is merely extortion. However, if their victim\nis seriously threatened by a third party, sometimes gangsters will protect their\nsource of revenue.\n\nLegitimate businesses are not the only victims of protection racketeers. Other\ncriminals are also targeted, since they cannot ask police to stop the extortion.\nHowever, for that same reason, criminals sometimes actively seek to buy this\n\"protection\".\n","linknr":157,"url":"Protection_racket","recorded":1362543354,"links":16,"instances":["crime","extortion"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Extortion","Organized crime terminology"],"headings":["Territorial monopolies","Providing genuine protection","Real-world examples","Government protection rackets","See also","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["pizzo","extortion"],["racket","crime"]],"members":["racket","pizzo"],"related":["Extortion","Coercion","Racketeer","Sicilian_Mafia","Scottish_Marches","Border_Reivers","Blackmail","Alphonse_Gangitano","Sicily","Palermo","Mafia","Ciudad_Juárez","Mexican_Drug_War","Post-Soviet_Russia","United_Kingdom","Kray_twins","East_End_of_London","Bribery","Extortion","Money_trail","Regulatory_capture","Bribe_Payers_Index","Bid_rigging","Conflict_of_interest","Extortion","FBI","Foreign_Corrupt_Practices_Act","Influence_peddling","Jury_tampering","Lobbying","Match_fixing","Money_trail","Organized_crime","Pay_to_Play","Pizzo_(extortion)","Political_corruption","Principal–agent_problem","Racket_(crime)","Revolutionary_tax","Taxation_as_theft","Transparency_International"]}
