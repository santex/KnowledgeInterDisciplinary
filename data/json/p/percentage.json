arithmetic","Fractions"],"text":"\nIn mathematics, a 'percentage' is a number or ratio as a fraction of 100. It is\noften denoted using the percent sign, “%”, or the abbreviation “pct.”\n\nFor example, 45% (read as “forty-five percent”) is equal to 45/100, or 0.45. A\nrelated system which expresses a number as a fraction of 1,000 uses the terms\n\"per mil\" and \"millage\". Percentages are used to express how large/small one\nquantity is, relative to another quantity. The first quantity usually represents\na part of, or a change in, the second quantity, which should be greater than\nzero. For example, an increase of $&nbsp;0.15 on a price of $&nbsp;2.50 is an\nincrease by a fraction of 0.15/2.50 = 0.06. Expressed as a percentage, this is\ntherefore a 6% increase. The word 'percent' means 'out of 100' or 'per 100'.\n\nAlthough percentages are usually used to express numbers between zero and one,\nany ratio can be expressed as a percentage. For instance, 111% is 1.11 and\n&minus;0.35% is &minus;0.0035. Although this is technically inaccurate as per\nthe definition of percent, an alternative wording in terms of a change in an\nobserved value is “an increase/decrease by a factor of...””\n","title":"percentage","headings":["History","Calculations","Percentage increase and decrease","Word and symbol","Related units","Other uses","Practical applications","See also","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["2: Ratio","2: Percent_sign","2: Percentage_point","1: Mathematics","1: Decimals","1: Per_mil","1: Ancient_Rome","1: Augustus","1: Middle_Ages","1: Percentage_sign","1: Conditional_probability","1: Percent_difference#Percentage_change","1: Interest_rate","1: British_English","1: American_English","1: Hansard","1: Latin","1: Dog_Latin","1: French_language","1: Ancient_Greece","1: The_Chicago_Manual_of_Style","1: University_of_Chicago_Press","1: International_System_of_Units","1: ISO_31-0","1: International_Bureau_of_Weights_and_Measures","1: International_Organization_for_Standardization","1: Permille","1: Basis_point","1: Per_cent_mille","1: Parts-per_notation","1: Concentration","1: Per-unit_system","1: Phoenix_Suns","1: Shaquille_O'Neal","1: NBA","1: Field_goal_percentage","1: Winning_percentage","1: Batting_average","1: Road","1: Rail_tracks","1: Baker_percentage","1: Volume_percent","1: Annual_percentage_rate","1: Percent_difference","1: Percentage_change","1: Khan_Academy"]}
