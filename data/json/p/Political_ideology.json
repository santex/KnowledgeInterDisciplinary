{"cursor":"13399","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nThis is a 'list of political ideologies'. Many political parties base their\npolitical action and election program on an ideology. In social studies, a\n'political ideology' is a certain ethical set of ideals, principles, doctrines,\nmyths or symbols of a social movement, institution, class, and or large group\nthat explains how society should work, and offers some political and cultural\nblueprint for a certain social order. A political ideology largely concerns\nitself with how to allocate power and to what ends it should be used. Some\nparties follow a certain ideology very closely, while others may take broad\ninspiration from a group of related ideologies without specifically embracing\nany one of them. The popularity of an ideology is in part due to the influence\nof moral entrepreneurs, who sometimes act in their own interests. Political idd\nad political action committee are in a form related\n\nPolitical ideologies have two dimensions:\n#'Goals': How society should be organized. 'Methods': The most appropriate way\n#to achieve this goal.\n\nAn ideology is a collection of ideas. Typically, each ideology contains certain\nideas on what it considers to be the best form of government (e.g. democracy,\nautocracy, etc.), and the best economic system (e.g. capitalism, socialism,\netc.). Sometimes the same word is used to identify both an ideology and one of\nits main ideas. For instance, \"socialism\" may refer to an economic system, or it\nmay refer to an ideology which supports that economic system.\n\nIdeologies also identify themselves by their position on the political spectrum\n(such as the left, the centre or the right), though this is very often\ncontroversial. Finally, ideologies can be distinguished from political\nstrategies (e.g. populism) and from single issues that a party may be built\naround (e.g. opposition to European integration or the legalization of\nmarijuana).\n\nThe following list attempts to divide the ideologies found in practical\npolitical life into a number of groups; each group contains ideologies that are\nrelated to each other. The headers refer to names of the best-known ideologies\nin each group. The names of the headers do not necessarily imply some\nhierarchical order or that one ideology evolved out of the other. They are\nmerely noting the fact that the ideologies in question are practically,\nhistorically and ideologically related to each other. Note that one ideology can\nbelong to several groups, and there is sometimes considerable overlap between\nrelated ideologies. Also, keep in mind that the meaning of a political label can\ndiffer between countries and that parties often subscribe to a combination of\nideologies.\n\nThe list is strictly alphabetical. Thus, placing one ideology before another\ndoes not imply that the first is more important or popular than the second.\n","linknr":656,"url":"Political_ideology","recorded":1362574379,"links":33,"instances":["historical","economic_theory","sociology","ethics","politics","international_relations","politics","ayn_rand"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Political
