The letters B and b represent genes for colour and the\n pictures show the resultant flowers.]] A 'phenotype' (from Greek phainein, 'to\n show' + typos, 'type') is the composite of an organism's observable\n characteristics or traits, such as its morphology, development, biochemical or\n physiological properties, phenology, behavior, and products of behavior (such\n as a bird's nest). Phenotypes result from the expression of an organism's genes\n as well as the influence of environmental factors and the interactions between\n the two. When two or more clearly different phenotypes exist in the same\n population of a species, it is called polymorph.\n\nThe genotype of an organism is the inherited instructions it carries within its\ngenetic code. Not all organisms with the same genotype look or act the same way\nbecause appearance and behavior are modified by environmental and developmental\nconditions. Likewise, not all organisms that look alike necessarily have the\nsame genotype.\n\nThis genotype-phenotype distinction was proposed by Wilhelm Johannsen in 1911 to\nmake clear the difference between an organism's heredity and what that heredity\nproduces.<ref></ref><ref></ref> The distinction is similar to that proposed by\nAugust Weismann, who distinguished between germ plasm (heredity) and somatic\ncells (the body). The Genotype-Phenotype concept should not be confused with\nFrancis Crick's central dogma of molecular biology, which is a statement about\nthe directionality of molecular sequential information flowing from DNA to\nprotein, and not the reverse.\n",
