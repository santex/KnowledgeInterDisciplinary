{"cursor":"19052","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" are used to show the sign of a number.]]\n\n\nIn mathematics, the word 'sign' refers to the property of being positive or\nnegative. Every nonzero real number is either positive or negative, and\ntherefore has a sign. Zero itself is signless, although in some contexts it\nmakes sense to consider a signed zero. In addition to its application to real\nnumbers, the word sign is used throughout mathematics to indicate aspects of\nmathematical objects that resemble positivity and negativity, such as the sign\nof a permutation.\n\nThe word sign is also sometimes used to refer to various mathematical symbols,\nsuch as the plus and minus symbols and the multiplication symbol. See the table\nof mathematical symbols for more information on signs and symbols in\nmathematics.\n","linknr":203,"url":"Positive_and_negative_numbers","recorded":1362372574,"links":26,"instances":["programming","mathematics","mathematics","mathematics","vector","algebra"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Elementary arithmetic","Numbers"],"headings":["Sign of a number","Sign function","Meanings of sign"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c5/PlusMinus.svg/150px-PlusMinus.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/Signum_function.svg/200px-Signum_function.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/c/f/5cf6a9d12f1371026747fda87e131a95.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/d/f/c/dfc1d6fb12e0f808a0aea0ac489b884c.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1f/Yhvyvczsa7.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/2/2/a/22a9eb645e708a1ae524b53bb3302a3a.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/Number-line.gif/600px-Number-line.gif","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/VFPt_dipole_electric.svg/220px-VFPt_dipole_electric.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["0","number"],["inequality","mathematics"],["negation","algebra"],["0","number"],["negation","algebra"],["function","mathematics"],["displacement","vector"],["variable","programming"],["measure","mathematics"]],"members":["variable","function","measure","inequality","displacement","negation"],"related":["Mathematics","Negative_number","Real_number","0_(number)","Signed_zero","Parity_of_a_permutation","Symbol","Plus_and_minus_signs","Multiplication_sign","Table_of_mathematical_symbols","Real_number","Inequality_(mathematics)","Negative_number","Arithmetic","Plus_and_minus_signs","Algebra","Negation_(algebra)","Absolute_value","0_(number)","Negation_(algebra)","Signed_number_representations","Computing","Signed_zero","Calculus","Mathematical_analysis","Limit","Absolute_value","Function_(mathematics)","Absolute_value","Unit_circle","Counterclockwise","Clockwise","Angle","Rotation","Clockwise","Mathematics","Axis_of_rotation","Right-hand_rule","Finite_difference","Calculus","Derivative","Monotonic_function","Analytic_geometry","Physics","Number_line","Linear_motion","Displacement_(vector)","Velocity","Cartesian_plane","Euclidean_vector","Vector_component","Most_significant_bit","Computing","Variable_(programming)","Bit","Two's_complement","Signed_number_representation","Parity_of_a_permutation","Graph_theory","Signed_graph","Mathematical_analysis","Signed_measure","Measure_(mathematics)","Signed-digit_representation","Signed_area","Signed_volume","Determinant","Physics","Electric_charge","Proton","Electron"]}
