In 2006, five additional\nshorter episodes were made in association with the BBC and were available to\nwatch online at AtomFilms until it was absorbed into Comedy Central. All Pib and\nPog episodes can now be seen on YouTube as of August 2012.\n\nThe animation is set up like a typical pre-school programme, introduced by a soft-\nspoken narrator who translates what the characters say to the audience. However,\nas the show goes on, it gradually turns into a black comedy where the characters\nattempt to harm each other constantly - like shooting each other in the stomach\nwith guns, kicking each other in the buttocks, sticking each other's heads in\nconcentrated sulphuric acid, sawing each other in half and blowing each other up\nwith cannons. After the show has finished, the \"actors\" (the same characters\nwith a more worn-out expression) break character and reveal themselves to be\nmuch older and grumpier than the characters they portray.\n\nThe characters were later used in an advertising campaign for Dairylea\nproducts on UK television, and made a cameo in the eighth episode of [[Rex the\nRunt]].
