Johnson 2010. p. 105. is a movement in archaeological theory\nthat emphasizes the subjectivity of archaeological interpretations. Despite\nhaving a vague series of similarities, post-processualism consists of \"very\ndiverse strands of thought coalesced into a loose cluster of\ntraditions\". Johnson 1999. p. 101. Within the post-processualist\nmovement, a wide variety of theoretical viewpoints have been embraced, including\nstructuralism and Neo-Marxism, as have a variety of different archaeological\ntechniques, such as phenomenology.\n\nThe post-processual movement originated in the United Kingdom during the late\n1970s and early 1980s, pioneered by archaeologists such as Ian Hodder, Daniel\nMiller, Christopher Tilley and Peter Ucko, who were influenced by French Marxist\nanthropology, postmodernism and similar trends in sociocultural anthropology.\nParallel developments soon followed in the United States. Initially post-\nprocessualism was primarily a reaction to and critique of processual\narchaeology, a paradigm developed in the 1960s by 'New Archaeologists' such as\nLewis Binford, and which had become dominant in Anglophone archaeology by the\n1970s. Post-processualism was heavily critical of a key tenet of processualism,\nnamely its assertion that archaeological interpretations could, if the\nscientific method was applied, come to completely objective conclusions. Post-\nprocessualists also criticized previous archaeological work for overemphasizing\nmaterialist interpretations of the past and being ethically and politically\nirresponsible.\n\nIn the United States, archaeologists widely see post-processualism as an\naccompaniment to the processual movement, while in the United Kingdom, they\nremain largely thought of as separate and opposing theoretical movements.\nIn other parts of the world, post-processualism has made less of an impact\non archaeological thought.

Various\narchaeologists have criticized post-processual archaeology, for a variety\nof reasons.\n","linknr":360,"url":"Post-processual_archaeology","recorded":1362480860,"links":19,"instances":["anthropologist","archaeologist","philosophy","philosophy","archaeology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Archaeological theory","Postmodern theory"],"headings":["Approach to archaeology","Understanding past societies","Marginalised archaeologies","History","Criticism","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/Marx_old.jpg/90px-Marx_old.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/Anthony_Giddens_at_the_Progressive_Governance_Converence%2C_Budapest%2C_Hungary%2C_2004_October.jpg/103px-Anthony_Giddens_at_the_Progressive_Governance_Converence%2C_Budapest%2C_Hungary%2C_2004_October.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["phenomenology","archaeology"],["objectivity","philosophy"],["objectivity","philosophy"],["daniel_miller","anthropologist"],["michael_shanks","archaeologist"],["agency","philosophy"]],"members":["daniel_miller","michael_shanks","objectivity","agency","phenomenology"],"related":["Archaeological_theory","Subjectivity","Structuralism","Neo-Marxism","Archaeology","Phenomenology_(archaeology)","Ian_Hodder","Daniel_Miller","Christopher_Tilley","Peter_Ucko","Marxism","Anthropology","Postmodernism","Cultural_anthropology","Processual_archaeology","Lewis_Binford","Scientific_method","Objectivity_(philosophy)","Materialist","Positivism","Scientific_method","Objectivity_(philosophy)","Subjective","Daniel_Miller_(anthropologist)","Chris_Tilley","Social_injustice","Second_world","Third_world","Ian_Hodder","Racism","Colonialism","World_Archaeological_Congress","Michael_Shanks_(archaeologist)","Christopher_Tilley","Peter_Ucko","Materialism","Culture-historical_archaeology","Idealism","Ideology","Religion","Mike_Parker_Pearson","Landscape","Hunter-gatherer","Structuralism","Claude_Lévi-Strauss","André_Leroi-Gourhan","Neolithic_Europe","Agency_(philosophy)","Culture-historical_archaeology","Anthony_Giddens,_Baron_Giddens","Structuration","Karl_Marx","Class_conflict","Marxist_archaeology","Julian_Thomas","Cultural_determinism","Feminist_archaeology","Second_wave_feminism","Ian_Hodder","University_of_Sheffield","Structural_anthropology","Bruce_Trigger","Marxism","Structuralism","Postmodernism","Comparative_literature","Literary_criticism","Culture_studies","New_cultural_anthropology","Boasian_anthropology","Ian_Hodder","British_Iron_Age","Roman_Britain","Scientific_method","Cambridge_University","Cambridge_University_Press","Lewis_Binford","United_States","Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas","Gender","Class_system","Historical_archaeology","Colin_Renfrew","Paul_Bahn","Postmodern"]}
