The report concluded that the quality of social housing needed to\nbe improved to match the rise in living standards and made a number of\nrecommendations. The Committee took a functional approach to determining space\nstandards in the home by considering what furniture was needed in rooms, the\nspace needed to use the furniture and move around it, and the space needed for\nnormal, household activities.\n\nOut of the report came the 'Parker Morris Standards', set out in the Ministry of\nHousing's \"Design Bulletin 6 â Space in the Home\". This provided typical\ndimensions for the typical items of furniture for which the dwelling designer\nshould allow space, and provided anthropometric data about the space needed to\nuse and move about furniture.\n\nIn 1967 these space standards became mandatory for all housing built in new\ntowns, extended to all council housing in 1969, although they had by then\nalready been adopted by many local councils. The mandatory nature of the\nstandards was ended by the Local Government, Planning and Land Act 1980, as\nconcerns grew over the cost of housing and, generally, public spending.\n\nAmong the standards are that:\n* In one, two and three bedroom dwellings, one flushing toilet is required, and\n  it may be in the bathroom.\n* A semi-detached or end-of-terrace house for 4 people should have a net floor\n  area of 72 square metres.\n* A dwelling for three or more people should have enclosed storage space for the\n  kitchen of 2.3 cubic metres.\n* Dwellings should be fitted with heating systems that maintain the kitchen and\n  circulation space at 13 degrees Celsius, and the living and dining spaces at\n  18 Â°C, when the external temperature is â1 Â°C.\n\nIn the private sector the Parker Morris Standards influenced the 1967 and\nsubsequent standards set by the National House Builders' Registration Council,\nnow the National House Building Council, but were not adopted as written.\nHowever it is widely felt that most public and private sector housing being\nbuilt today fails to meet the Parker Morris standards for floor and storage\nspace, and this led to a decision in 2008 by the former government agency\nEnglish Partnerships to re-introduce minimum standards that are 10% more\ngenerous than those of Parker Morris for developments on its own\nland.\n\nSubsequently, The Office of the Mayor of London has also opted to move to adopt\na Design Guide for Housing within the city which will be 10% more generous than\nthe Parker Morris Standards. This guide was published on 19 August 2010 and will\nbe implemented from April 2011.\n","linknr":98,"url":"Parker_Morris_Committee","recorded":1363544838,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Parker_Morris_Committee&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Parker_Morris_Committee&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/Public_housing#United_Kingdom","/wiki/Anthropometric","/wiki/New_town","/wiki/Council_house","/wiki/Local_Government","/wiki/Public_spending","/wiki/Flushing_toilet","/wiki/Terrace_house","/wiki/National_House_Building_Council","/wiki/English_Partnerships","#cite_note-1","#cite_note-2","/w/index.php?title=Parker_Morris_Committee&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","http://www.bdonline.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=426&storycode=3098967&c=1","http://www.bdonline.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=426&storycode=3098967&c=1","#cite_ref-2","http://www.london.gov.uk/who-runs-london/mayor/publications/housing/london-housing-design-guide","/wiki/Greater_London_Authority","http://www.london.gov.uk/who-runs-london/mayor/publications/housing/london-housing-design-guide","http://www.tsoshop.co.uk/bookstore.asp?Action=Book&ProductId=9780117501263","/wiki/Her_Majesty%27s_Stationery_Office","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0-11-750126-3","http://www.tsoshop.co.uk/bookstore.asp?Action=Book&ProductId=9780117501263","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Special:BookSources/1-86134-263-2","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Special:BookSources/1-4051-3505-0","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parker_Morris_Committee&oldid=484888404","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Reports_of_the_United_Kingdom_government","/wiki/Category:Public_housing_in_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Category:1961_in_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Category:Use_British_English_from_September_2011","/wiki/Category:Use_dmy_dates_from_September_2011","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Parker+Morris+Committee&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Parker+Morris+Committee","/wiki/Parker_Morris_Committee","/wiki/Talk:Parker_Morris_Committee","#","/wiki/Parker_Morris_Committee","/w/index.php?title=Parker_Morris_Committee&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Parker_Morris_Committee&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Parker_Morris_Committee","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Parker_Morris_Committee","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Parker_Morris_Committee&oldid=484888404","/w/index.php?title=Parker_Morris_Committee&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Parker_Morris_Committee&id=484888404","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Parker+Morris+Committee","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Parker+Morris+Committee&oldid=484888404&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Parker_Morris_Committee&printable=yes","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parker_Morris_Committee","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=skins.vector&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","/w/index.php?title=MediaWiki:Gadget-ReferenceTooltips.js&action=raw&ctype=text/javascript&508635914","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.ph
