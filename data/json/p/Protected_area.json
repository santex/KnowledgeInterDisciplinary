There\nare several kinds of protected areas, which vary by level of protection\ndepending on the enabling laws of each country or the regulations of the\ninternational organisations involved. The term \"protected area\" also includes\nMarine Protected Areas, the boundaries of which will include some area of ocean.\nThere are over 161,000 protected areas in the world (as of October\n2010) [http://www.protectedplanet.net/search/ Protected Planet] with\nmore added daily, representing between 10 and 15 percent of the world's land\nsurface area.

They are the\ncornerstones of virtually all national and international conservation\nstrategies. They are areas set aside to maintain functioning natural ecosystems,\nto act as refuges for species and to maintain ecological processes that cannot\nsurvive in most intensely managed landscapes and seascapes. Protected areas act\nas benchmarks against which we understand human interactions with the natural\nworld. Today they are often the only hope we have of stopping many threatened or\nendangered species from becoming extinct. Dudley, N. (ed.)
