{"cursor":"49609","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Piezoelectricity' () is the electric charge that accumulates in certain solid\nmaterials (notably crystals, certain ceramics, and biological matter such as\nbone, DNA and various proteins) in response\nto applied mechanical stress. The word piezoelectricity means electricity\nresulting from pressure. It is derived from the Greek piezo or piezein\n(ÏÎ¹Î­Î¶ÎµÎ¹Î½), which means to squeeze or press, and electric or electron (), which\nstands for amber, an ancient source of electric charge.\nPiezoelectricity was discovered in 1880 by French physicists Jacques and Pierre\nCurie. \n\nThe piezoelectric effect is understood as the linear electromechanical\ninteraction between the mechanical and the electrical state in crystalline\nmaterials with no inversion symmetry.\nThe piezoelectric effect is a reversible process in that materials exhibiting\nthe direct piezoelectric effect (the internal generation of electrical charge\nresulting from an applied mechanical force) also exhibit the reverse\npiezoelectric effect (the internal generation of a mechanical strain resulting\nfrom an applied electrical field). For example, lead zirconate titanate crystals\nwill generate measurable piezoelectricity when their static structure is\ndeformed by about 0.1% of the original dimension. Conversely, those same\ncrystals will change about 0.1% of their static dimension when an external\nelectric field is applied to the material. The inverse piezoelectric effect is\nused in production of ultrasonic sound waves.\n\nPiezoelectricity is found in useful applications such as the production and\ndetection of sound, generation of high voltages, electronic frequency\ngeneration, microbalances, and ultrafine focusing of optical assemblies. It is\nalso the basis of a number of scientific instrumental techniques with atomic\nresolution, the scanning probe microscopies such as STM, AFM, MTA, SNOM, etc.,\nand everyday uses such as acting as the ignition source for cigarette lighters\nand push-start propane barbecues.\n","linknr":687,"url":"Piezoelectric","recorded":1362509978,"links":65,"instances":["radio","physics","company","piezoelectricity","mathematics","crystalline","materials_science","waves","physics","phenomenon","music_technology","geometric","structure"],"pdf":["http://www.mariobirkholz.de/ZPB1995b.pdf","http://www.mariobirkholz.de/ZPB1995b.pdf","http://rruff.geo.arizona.edu/doclib/MinMag/Volume_43/43-326-237.pdf","http://rruff.geo.arizona.edu/doclib/MinMag/Volume_43/43-326-237.pdf"],"categories":["Condensed
