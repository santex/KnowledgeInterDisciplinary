If RNA is trapped inside, the system can use\nthe RNA or select for it.\n\nA protobiont is an aggregate of abiotically produced organic molecules\nsurrounded by a membrane or a membrane-like structure. Protobionts exhibit some\nof the properties associated with life, including simple reproduction,\nmetabolism and excitability, as well as the maintenance of an internal chemical\nenvironment different from that of their surroundings. It has been suggested\nthat they are a key step in the origin of life on earth. Experiments by Sidney\nW. Fox and Aleksandr Oparin have demonstrated that they may be formed\nspontaneously, in conditions similar to the environment thought to exist on an\nearly Earth. These experiments formed liposomes and microspheres, which have\nmembrane structure similar to the phospholipid bilayer found in cells.\n\nNanobes or nanobacteria, being too small to be functional living organisms, may\nbe an example of naturally occurring protobionts.\n","linknr":129,"url":"Protobiont","recorded":1362483858,"links":25,"instances":["biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Origin of life","Molecular biology"],"headings":["See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/AlphaHelixSection.svg/40px-AlphaHelixSection.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cell","biology"]],"members":["cell"],"related":["Prokaryotic_cell","RNA","Abiogenesis","Membrane","Life","Reproduction","Metabolism","Origin_of_life","Sidney_W._Fox","Aleksandr_Oparin","Liposome","Microspheres","Membrane_structure","Phospholipid_bilayer","Cell_(biology)","Nanobe","Nanobacteria","Abiogenesis","Prokaryote","Liposome"]}
