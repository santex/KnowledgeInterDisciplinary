{"cursor":"2894","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nIn biochemistry, a 'dimer' is a macromolecular complex formed by two, usually\nnon-covalently bound, macromolecules like proteins or nucleic acids. It is a\nquaternary structure of a protein.\n\nA homo-dimer would be formed by two identical molecules (process called\n'homodimerization'). A hetero-dimer would be formed by two different\nmacromolecules (process called 'heterodimerization').\n\nMost dimers in biochemistry are not connected by covalent bonds. An example of a\nnon-covalent heterodimer would be the enzyme reverse transcriptase, which is\ncomposed of two different amino acid chains. An\nexception is dimers that are linked by disulfide bridges such as the homodimeric\nprotein NEMO.\n\nSome proteins contain specialized domains to ensure dimerization\n(dimerization domains).\n","linknr":132,"url":"Protein_dimer","recorded":1362481095,"links":16,"instances":["chemistry","chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Proteins","Dimers (chemistry)"],"headings":["Examples","References","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ce/Galactose-1-phosphate_uridylyltransferase_1GUP.png/220px-Galactose-1-phosphate_uridylyltransferase_1GUP.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/AlphaHelixSection.svg/40px-AlphaHelixSection.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["complex","chemistry"],["dimer","chemistry"]],"members":["dimer","complex"],"related":["Biochemistry","Complex_(chemistry)","Covalent_bond","Macromolecule","Protein","Nucleic_acid","Protein_quaternary_structure","Molecule","Covalent_bond","Reverse_transcriptase","Amino_acid","Disulfide_bridge","IKBKG","Antibody","Receptor_tyrosine_kinase","Transcription_factor","Leucine_zipper","Nuclear_receptor","14-3-3_protein","G_protein-coupled_receptor","G_protein","Kinesin","Triosephosphateisomerase","Alcohol_dehydrogenase","Factor_XI","Factor_XIII","Toll-like_receptor","Fibrin","Dimer_(chemistry)","Protein_trimer","Oligomer","ProtCID"]}
