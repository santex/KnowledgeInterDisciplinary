{"cursor":"1311","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" at Franklin Fountain in Philadelphia holds up his phosphate bottle.]]\n 'Phosphate soda' is a type of beverage in which phosphoric acid is included to\n give a tangy or sour taste. These beverages became popular among men in the\n 1870s in the United States, and phospate beverages were made with fruit\n flavorings, egg, malt, or wine. In the 1900s, the beverages became popular with\n both genders, and fruit-flavoured phosphate sodas were served at soda\n fountains, before losing popularity to ice cream beverages in the 1930s. Phosphoric acid is used in many bottled soft drinks,\n including Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola, making them essentially phosphate sodas.\n","linknr":87,"url":"Phosphate_soda","recorded":1362372491,"links":11,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Phosphates","Soft drinks"],"headings":["References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dc/Soda_jerk_with_bottle_of_phosphoric_acid%2C_Franklin_Fountain%2C_Philadelphia%2C_Pennsylvania_-_20110501.jpg/250px-Soda_jerk_with_bottle_of_phosphoric_acid%2C_Franklin_Fountain%2C_Philadelphia%2C_Pennsylvania_-_20110501.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Franklin_Fountain","Phosphoric_acid","Malt","Soda_fountain","Coca-Cola","Pepsi-Cola"]}
