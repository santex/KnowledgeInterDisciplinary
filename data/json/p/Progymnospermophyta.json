They have been treated formally at the rank\nof division 'Progymnospermophyta' or class 'Progymnospermopsida' (as opposite).\nThe stratigraphically oldest known examples belong to the Middle Devonian order\nthe Aneurophytales, with forms such as Protopteridium, in which the vegetative\norgans consisted of relatively loose clusters of axes.

In more advanced aneurophytaleans such as\nAneurophyton these vegetative organs started to look rather more like\nfronds, Serlin, B. S. & Banks, H. P.

In Late Devonian times, another group\nof progymnosperms gave rise to the first really large trees known as\n[[Archaeopteris]].\n\nOther characteristics: *Vascular cambium with unlimited growth potential is\npresent as well as xylem and phloem. *Ancestors of the earliest seed plants as\nwell as the first true trees.  *Strong monopodial growth is exhibited.  *Some were\nheterosporous but others were homosporous.\n","linknr":145,"url":"Progymnospermophyta","recorded":1362477100,"links":26,"instances":["botany"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Devonian life","Plants"],"headings":["References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/86/Archaeopteris.JPG/220px-Archaeopteris.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a6/Dahlia_redoute.JPG/30px-Dahlia_redoute.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Psaronius.jpg/40px-Psaronius.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["rank","botany"]],"members":["rank"],"related":["Aneurophytales","Protopityales","Archaeopteridales","Trimerophyte","Gymnosperms","Rank_(botany)","Pteridosperm","Lyginopteridales","Vascular_cambium","Xylem","Phloem","Seed_plant","Conifer","Spruce","Monopodial_growth","Macrophyll","Heterosporous","Homosporous"]}
