However, peas are considered to be a vegetable in cooking.\nThe name is also used to describe other edible seeds from the Fabaceae such as\nthe pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan), the cowpea (Vigna unguiculata), and the seeds\nfrom several species of [[Lathyrus]].\n\nP. sativum is an annual plant, with a life cycle of one year. It is a cool\n   season crop grown in many parts of the world; planting can take place from\n   winter to early summer depending on location. The average pea weighs between\n   0.1 and 0.36 grams. [http://www.hort.purdue.ed-\n   u/newcrop/cropfactsheets/pea.html Pea] The immature peas (and in 'snow\n   peas' the tender pod as well) are used as a vegetable, fresh, frozen or\n   canned; varieties of the species typically called 'field peas' are grown to\n   produce dry peas like the split pea shelled from the matured pod. These are\n   the basis of pease porridge and pea soup, staples of medieval cuisine; in\n   Europe, consuming fresh immature green peas was an innovation of Early\n   Modern cuisine.\n\nThe wild pea is restricted to the Mediterranean basin and the Near East. The\nearliest archaeological finds of peas date from the neolithic era of current\nSyria, Turkey and Jordan. In Egypt, early finds date from ca. 4800â4400 BC\nin the Nile delta area, and from ca. 3800â3600 BC in Upper Egypt. The pea\nwas also present in Georgia in the 5th millennium BC. Farther east, the finds\nare younger. Peas were present in Afghanistan ca. 2000 BC, in Harappa,\nPakistan, and in northwest India in 2250â1750 BC. In the second half of the\n2nd millennium BC, this pulse crop appears in the Gangetic basin and southern\nIndia. Zohary, Daniel and Hopf, Maria (2000).
