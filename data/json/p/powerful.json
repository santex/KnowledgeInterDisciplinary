The term authority is often used for power perceived as legitimate by\nthe social structure. Power can be seen as evil or unjust, but the exercise of\npower is accepted as endemic to humans as social beings. In the corporate\nenvironment, power is often expressed as upward or downward. With downward\npower, a company's superior influences subordinates. When a company exerts\nupward power, it is the subordinates who influence the decisions of the leader\n(Greiner & Schein, 1988).\n\nThe use of power need not involve coercion (force or the threat of force). At\none extreme, it more closely resembles what everyday English-speakers call\ninfluence, although some authors make a distinction between power and influence\n– the means by which power is used (Handy, C. 1993 Understanding Organisations).\n\nMuch of the recent sociological debate on power revolves around the issue of the\nenabling nature of power. A comprehensive account of power can be found in\nSteven Lukes Power: A Radical View where he discusses the three dimensions of\npower. Thus, power can be seen as various forms of constraint on human action,\nbut also as that which makes action possible, although in a limited scope. Much\nof this debate is related to the works of the French philosopher Michel Foucault\n(1926–1984), who, following the Italian political philosopher Niccolò\nMachiavelli (1469–1527), sees power as \"a complex strategic situation in a given\nsociety social setting\".<ref>Foucault, Michel, Power/Knowledge, Pantheon Books,\nNew York, 1980.</ref> Being deeply structural, his concept involves both\nconstraint and enablement. For a purely enabling (and voluntaristic) concept of\npower see the works of Anthony Giddens.\n","title":"Power%20%28social%20and%20political%29","headings":["Sources","Tactics","Psychological research","Theories","See also","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["3: Social_influence","3: Italy","2: Authority","2: Coercion","2: Sociology","2: Steven_Lukes","2: Niccolò_Machiavelli","2: Charisma","2: Knowledge","2: Violence","2: Psychological_manipulation","2: Antonio_Gramsci","1: Politics","1: Social_science","1: Social_structure","1: Justice","1: Leader","1: English_language","1: Social_action","1: France","1: Michel_Foucault","1: Anthony_Giddens","1: Democracy","1: Social_class","1: Expertise","1: Desiderius_Erasmus","1: Persuasion","1: Subliminal_stimuli","1: Celebrity","1: Religion","1: Group_dynamics","1: Public_relations","1: Tradition","1: John_Kenneth_Galbraith","1: Aggressive","1: Bullying","1: Machiavellians","1: Sociologists","1: Personal_relationship","1: Bystander_effect","1: Self-serving","1: Physical","1: Verbal_abuse","1: Emotional_abuse","1: Sexual_abuse","1: Financial_abuse","1: John_R._P._French","1: Bertram_Raven","1: Images_of_Organization","1: Penguin_Books","1: Uniform","1: Loyalty","1: Interpersonal_skills","1: Nationalism","1: Patriotism","1: Expert","1: Coercive","1: Game_theory","1: Neoclassical_economics","1: Rational_choice_theory","1: Keith_Dowding","1: Marxism","1: Cultural_hegemony","1: Ideology","1: Capitalism","1: Nation-state","1: The_Prince","1: Communist","1: Western_Europe","1: Russia","1: Centaur","1: Wesley_Newcomb_Hohfeld","1: Louis_Althusser","1: Stewart_Clegg","1: Alvin_Toffler","1: Wealth","1: Benevolent_dictator","1: Industrial_Revolution","1: Industrialist","1: Financier","1: Gene_Sharp","1: Étienne_de_La_Boétie","1: From_dictatorship_to_democracy","1: Slobodan_Milosevic","1: Arab_Spring","1: Björn_Kraus","1: Epistemology","1: Constructivist_epistemology","1: Max_Weber","1: Feminism","1: Whites","1: Heterosexual","1: Male","1: Gender_identity","1: Disability","1: Anti-globalization_movement","1: Gilles_Deleuze","1: Thomas_Hobbes","1: Friedrich_Nietzsche","1: Will_to_power","1: Psychology","1: Alfred_Adler","1: Freudian","1: Human_sexuality","1: Control_freak","1: Empire_building","1: Flipism","1: Foucault/Habermas_debate","1: Leadership","1: Organizational_culture","1: Petty_authority","1: Power_harassment","1: Power_politics","1: Principle_of_least_interest","1: Social_control","1: Social_dominance_theory","1: VDM_Verlag"]}
