{"cursor":"41851","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nIn sports leagues, 'promotion and relegation' is a process where teams are\ntransferred between two divisions based on their performance for the completed\nseason. The best-ranked teams in the lower division are promoted to the division\nabove, and the worst-ranked teams in the higher division are relegated to the\ndivision below. In some leagues play-offs or qualifying rounds are also used to\ndetermine rankings. This process can continue through several levels, with teams\nbeing exchanged between levels 1 and 2, levels 2 and 3, levels 3 and 4, and so\non. During the season, teams that are high enough in the table that they would\nqualify for promotion are sometimes said to be in the promotion zone, and those\nat the bottom are in the relegation zone (or, colloquially, the drop\nzone).\n\nThe number of teams exchanged between the divisions is normally identical.\nExceptions occur when the higher division wishes to change the size of its\nmembership, or has lost one or more of its clubs (to financial insolvency, for\nexample) and wishes to restore its previous membership size, in which case fewer\nteams may be relegated from that division, or more accepted for promotion from\nthe division below. Such variations will almost inevitably cause a \"knock-on\"\neffect through the lower divisions. For example, in 1995 the Premier League\nvoted to reduce its numbers by two and achieved the desired change by relegating\nfour teams instead of the usual three, whilst allowing only two promotions from\nFootball League Division One.\n\nThe system is said to be the defining characteristic of the \"European\" form of\nprofessional sports league organization. Promotion and relegation have the\neffect of allowing the maintenance of a hierarchy of leagues and/or divisions,\naccording to the relative strength of their teams. They also maintain the\nimportance of games played by many low-ranked teams near the end of the season,\nwhich may be at risk of relegation. In contrast, a low-ranked U.S./Canadian\nteam's final games serve little purpose, and in fact losing may be beneficial to\nsuch teams, yielding a better position in the next year's draft.\n\nAlthough not intrinsic to the system, problems can occur due to the differing\nmonetary payouts and revenue-generating potential different divisions provide to\ntheir clubs. For example, financial hardship has sometimes occurred in leagues\nwhere clubs do not reduce their wage bill once relegated. This usually occurs\nfor one of two reasons: first, the club can't move underperforming players on,\nor second, the club is gambling on being promoted back straight away and is\nprepared to take a financial loss for one or two seasons to do so. Some leagues\n(most notably English football's Premier League) offer \"parachute payments\" to\nits relegated teams for the following\nyear(s). [http://football.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,,1837801,00.html\n\"Football\"], The Guardian. Article discusses the financial disparity between the\nPremier League and the Football League] The payouts are higher than the\nprize money received by some non-relegated teams and are designed to soften the\nfinancial hit that clubs take whilst dropping out of the Premier League.\nHowever, in many cases these parachute payments just serve to inflate the costs\nof competing for promotion among the lower division clubs.\n\nIn some countries and at certain levels, teams in-line for promotion may have to\nsatisfy certain non-playing conditions in order to be accepted by the higher\nleague, such as financial solvency, stadium capacity, and facilities. If these\nare not satisfied, a lower-ranked team may be promoted in their place, or a team\nin the league above may be saved from relegation.\n\nIn sports such as bandy, ice hockey and floorball, the concept of promotion and\nrelegation is used also for the World Championships, as well as the Athletics\nEuropean Cup.\n\nAn alternate system of league organisation which is used in the U.S., Canada and\nAustralia is a closed model which always has the same teams playing, with\noccasional admission of expansion teams.\n","linknr":554,"url":"Promotion_and_relegation","recorded":1362668029,"links":28,"instances":["region","football","jeddah","19th_century","2011","football_team","sports","ncaa","ncaa","greece","football_team","ncaa","sports"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Association
