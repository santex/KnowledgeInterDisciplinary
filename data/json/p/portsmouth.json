Portsmouth is notable for being the United Kingdom's\nonly island city; it is located mainly on Portsea Island.<ref></ref> It is\nsituated south west from London and south east of Southampton.\n\nAs a significant naval port for centuries, Portsmouth is home to the world's\noldest dry dock still in use and also home to some famous ships, including HMS\n''Warrior'', the Tudor carrack [[Mary Rose]] and Lord Nelson's flagship, HMS\n''Victory''. Although smaller than in its heyday, the naval base remains a major\ndockyard and base for the Royal Navy and Royal Marine Commandos whose\nHeadquarters resides there. There is also a thriving commercial ferryport\nserving destinations on the continent for freight and passenger traffic. The\nCity of Portsmouth and Portsmouth Football Club are both nicknamed 'Pompey'. It\nis also well known for being 'the most haunted place in Hampshire'.\n\nThe Spinnaker Tower is a striking recent addition to the city's skyline. It can\nbe found in the redeveloped former HMS ''Vernon'', formerly a shore\nestablishment or 'stone frigate' of the Royal Navy, now an area of retail\noutlets, restaurants, clubs and bars now known as Gunwharf Quays.\n\nThe City of Portsmouth has a population of 207,100 and is the only city in\nEngland with a greater population density () than London (). The Portsmouth\nUrban Area, which includes Fareham, Portchester, Gosport and Havant, is the 13th\nlargest urban area in the United Kingdom and the largest in Hampshire, with an\nestimated 520,000 residents according to the 2011 Census. Portsmouth combines\nwith Southampton to form a single metropolitan area with a population over a\nmillion, one of the United Kingdom's most populous metropolitan areas.<ref\nname=\"espon\"></ref>\n","title":"portsmouth","headings":["History","Geography and climate","Demographics","Government and politics","Economy","Culture","Nightlife","Popular
