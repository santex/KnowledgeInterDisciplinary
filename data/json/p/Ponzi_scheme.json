{"cursor":"9835","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n, the namesake of the scheme]]\n\nA 'Ponzi scheme' is a fraudulent investment operation that pays returns to its\ninvestors from their own money or the money paid by subsequent investors, rather\nthan from profit earned by the individual or organization running the operation.\nThe Ponzi scheme usually entices new investors by offering higher returns than\nother investments, in the form of short-term returns that are either abnormally\nhigh or unusually consistent. Perpetuation of the high returns requires an ever-\nincreasing flow of money from new investors to keep the scheme going.\n\nThe system is destined to collapse because the earnings, if any, are less than\nthe payments to investors. Usually, the scheme is interrupted by legal\nauthorities before it collapses because a Ponzi scheme is suspected or because\nthe promoter is selling unregistered securities. As more investors become\ninvolved, the likelihood of the scheme coming to the attention of authorities\nincreases.\n\nThe scheme is named after Charles Ponzi, who became notorious for\nusing the technique in 1920. Ponzi did not invent the scheme (for\nexample, Charles Dickens' 1844 novel [[Martin Chuzzlewit]] and 1857 novel\n[[Little Dorrit]] each described such a scheme), but his operation\ntook in so much money that it was the first to become known throughout the\nUnited States. Ponzi's original scheme was based on the arbitrage of\ninternational reply coupons for postage stamps; however, he soon diverted\ninvestors' money to make payments to earlier investors and himself.\n","linknr":304,"url":"Ponzi_scheme","recorded":1362540539,"links":44,"instances":["finance","stock_market","finance"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Pyramid and Ponzi schemes|","Confidence tricks"],"headings":["Characteristics","Unraveling of a Ponzi scheme","Similar schemes","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0a/Ponzi.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["hedge","finance"],["intrinsic_value","finance"],["bucket_shop","stock_market"]],"members":["intrinsic_value","bucket_shop","hedge"],"related":["Fraud","Investment","Securities","Charles_Ponzi","Arbitrage","International_reply_coupon","Hedge_(finance)","Futures_contract","High-yield_investment_program","Offshore_investment","Hedge_funds","Allen_Stanford","Insolvency","Liquidity_crisis","Bank_run","Madoff_investment_scandal","Global_financial_crisis_of_2008","Pyramid_scheme","Economic_bubble","Stock_bubble","Real_estate_bubble","Tulip_mania","Greater_fool_theory","Intrinsic_value_(finance)","List_of_Ponzi_schemes","Bucket_shop_(stock_market)","Get-rich-quick_scheme","Matrix_scheme","White-collar_crime"]}
