The host may be an\nanimal (including humans), a plant, or even another microorganism. http://w-\nww.medterms.com/script/main/art. http://www.metapathogen.com\n\nThere are several substrates including pathways whereby pathogens can invade a\nhost. The principal pathways have different episodic time frames, but soil\ncontamination has the longest or most persistent potential for harboring a\npathogen. Diseases caused by organisms in humans are known as pathogenic\ndiseases. Some of the diseases that a pathogen can cause are smallpox,\ninfluenza, mumps, measles, chickenpox, ebola, and rubella.\n\nNot all pathogens are necessarily undesirable to humans. In entomology,\npathogens are one of the \"Three P's\" (predators, pathogens and parasitoids) that\nserve as natural or introduced biological controls to suppress arthropod pest\npopulations. sharmen\n","linknr":265,"url":"Pathogenic","recorded":1362508921,"links":66,"instances":["organism","biology"],"pdf":["http://www.d.umn.edu/~rhicks1/diversity/Pronunciation%20Guide.pdf"],"categories":["Infectious diseases"],"headings":["Types of pathogen","Virulence","Transmission","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["host","biology"],["pest","organism"]],"members":["pest","host"],"related":["Microorganism","Virus","Bacterium","Prion","Fungus","Disease","Host_(biology)","Animal","Humans","Plant","Soil_contamination","Entomology","Predator","Parasitoids","Biological_control","Arthropod","Pest_(organism)","Adenoviridae","Picornaviridae","Herpesviridae","Hepadnaviridae","Flaviviridae","Retroviridae","Orthomyxoviridae","Paramyxoviridae","Papovaviridae","Polyomavirus","Rhabdoviridae","Togaviridae","Saprophyte","Protists","Helminths","Nucleic_acid","Scrapie","Bovine_spongiform_encephalopathy","Creutzfeldt–Jakob_disease","Koch's_postulates","Stanley_B._Prusiner","Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_or_Medicine","Virulence","Physical_fitness","Horizontal_transmission","Vertical_transmission","Evolutionary_medicine","Optimal_virulence","Ecological_competence","Emerging_Pathogens_Institute","Human_pathogen","List_of_human_diseases_associated_with_infectious_pathogens"]}
