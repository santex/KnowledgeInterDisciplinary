Any explicit\naccount of perception requires a commitment to one of a variety of ontological\nor metaphysical views. Philosophers distinguish internalist accounts, which\nassume that perceptions of objects, and knowledge or beliefs about them, are\naspects of an individual's mind, and externalist accounts, which state that they\nconstitute real aspects of the world external to the individual. cf. http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/perception-\nepisprob/ BonJour, Laurence (2007): Epistemological Problems of Perception.\nStanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, accessed 1.9.2010. The position of\nnaÃ¯ve realism â the 'everyday' impression of physical objects constituting what\nis perceived â is to some extent contradicted by the occurrence of perceptual\nillusions and hallucinations cf. http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/perception-\nproblem/ Crane, Tim (2005): The Problem of Perception.
