Shorter molecules move\nfaster and migrate farther than longer ones because shorter molecules migrate\nmore easily through the pores of the gel. This phenomenon is called\nsieving. Sambrook J, Russel DW (2001). Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory\nManual 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press. Cold Spring Harbor,\nNY. Proteins are separated by charge in agarose because the pores of the\ngel are too large to sieve proteins. Gel electrophoresis can also be used for\nseparation of nanoparticles.\n\nGel electrophoresis uses a gel as an anticonvective medium and/or sieving medium\nduring electrophoresis, the movement of a charged particle in an electrical\nfield. Gels suppress the thermal convection caused by application of the\nelectric field, and can also act as a sieving medium, retarding the passage of\nmolecules; gels can also simply serve to maintain the finished separation, so\nthat a post electrophoresis stain can be applied. DNA Gel\nelectrophoresis is usually performed for analytical purposes, often after\namplification of DNA via PCR, but may be used as a preparative technique prior\nto use of other methods such as mass spectrometry, RFLP, PCR, cloning, DNA\nsequencing, or Southern blotting for further characterization.\n","linknr":507,"url":"Polyacrylamide_gel_electrophoresis","recorded":1362551556,"links":44,"instances":["chemistry","fastpp","biology","biology","biochemistry"],"pdf":["http://www.cc.ahs.chula.ac.th/Molmed/DNA%20electro%27s%20conductive%20media.pdf","http://www.cc.ahs.chula.ac.th/Molmed/DNA%20electro%27s%20conductive%20media.pdf","http://probes.invitrogen.com/media/pis/mp07567.pdf","http://probes.invitrogen.com/media/pis/mp33100.pdf"],"categories":["Protein
