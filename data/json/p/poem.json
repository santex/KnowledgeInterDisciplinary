Ancient attempts to define poetry, such as Aristotle's [[Poetics\n(Aristotle)|Poetics]], focused on the uses of speech in rhetoric, drama, song\nand comedy. Later attempts concentrated on features such as repetition, verse\nform and rhyme, and emphasized the aesthetics which distinguish poetry from more\nobjectively-informative, prosaic forms of writing. From the mid-20th century,\npoetry has sometimes been more generally regarded as a fundamental creative act\nemploying language.\n\nPoetry uses forms and conventions to suggest differential interpretation to\nwords, or to evoke emotive responses. Devices such as assonance, alliteration,\nonomatopoeia and rhythm are sometimes used to achieve musical or incantatory\neffects. The use of ambiguity, symbolism, irony and other stylistic elements of\npoetic diction often leaves a poem open to multiple interpretations. Similarly,\nmetaphor, simile and metonymy<ref></ref> create a resonance between otherwise\ndisparate images—a layering of meanings, forming connections previously not\nperceived. Kindred forms of resonance may exist, between individual verses, in\ntheir patterns of rhyme or rhythm.\n\nSome poetry types are specific to particular cultures and genres and respond to\ncharacteristics of the language in which the poet writes. Readers accustomed to\nidentifying poetry with Dante, Goethe, Mickiewicz and Rumi may think of it as\nwritten in lines based on rhyme and regular meter; there are, however,\ntraditions, such as Biblical poetry, that use other means to create rhythm and\neuphony. Much modern poetry reflects a critique of poetic tradition,<ref></ref>\nplaying with and testing, among other things, the principle of euphony itself,\nsometimes altogether forgoing rhyme or set rhythm.<ref></ref><ref></ref> In\ntoday's increasingly globalized world, poets often adapt forms, styles and\ntechniques from diverse cultures and languages.\n",
