and vegetables (i.e. meats, grains, oats,\netc. are sometimes considered as produce.) More specifically, the term \"produce\"\noften implies that the products are and generally in the same state as where\nthey were harvested. In supermarkets the term is also used to refer to the\nsection where fruit and vegetables are kept. Produce is the main product sold by\ngreengrocers, farmers' markets, and fruit markets.\n\nIn some parts of the world, including the United States, produce is marked\nwith small stickers bearing price look-up codes. These four or five digit\ncodes are a standardized system intended to aid checkout and inventory control\nin produce markets.\n","title":"produce","headings":["Seasonal produce","See also","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["2: Strawberries","2: Winter_squash","1: Barcelona","1: Farm","1: Crop","1: Fruit","1: Vegetable","1: Harvest","1: Supermarket","1: Greengrocer","1: Farmers'_market","1: Sticker","1: Price_look-up_codes","1: Numerical_digit","1: Standardization","1: Seasonality","1: Region","1: Season","1: Tropics","1: Apricot","1: Cherries","1: Pea","1: Cabbage","1: Watercress","1: Artichoke","1: Asparagus","1: Avocado","1: New_potatoes","1: Rhubarb","1: Berry","1: Blackberry","1: Blueberry","1: Raspberry","1: Nectarine","1: Peach","1: Melon","1: Beet","1: Maize","1: Cucumber","1: Eggplant","1: Green_bean","1: Tomato","1: Zucchini","1: Apple","1: Cranberry","1: Grape","1: Ficus","1: Pear","1: Pomegranate","1: Cultivar","1: Wild_cabbage","1: Broccoli","1: Brussels_sprout","1: Cauliflower","1: Collard","1: Kale","1: Root_vegetable","1: Garlic","1: Ginger","1: Parsnip","1: Turnip","1: Acorn_squash","1: Butternut_squash","1: Pumpkin","1: Citrus","1: Clementine","1: Grapefruit","1: Lemon","1: Leek","1: Radicchio","1: Rutabaga","1: Radish","1: Onion","1: Lettuce","1: Spinach","1: Subtropical_climate","1: Food_industry","1: Food_labeling_regulations","1: Food_traceability","1: Geography_of_food","1: Produce_traceability"]}
