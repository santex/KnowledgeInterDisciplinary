Pharming can be conducted either by\nchanging the hosts file on a victim's computer or by exploitation of a\nvulnerability in DNS server software. DNS servers are computers responsible for\nresolving Internet names into their real IP addresses. Compromised DNS servers\nare sometimes referred to as \"poisoned\". Pharming requires unprotected access to\ntarget a computer, such as altering a customer's home computer, rather than a\ncorporate business server.\n\nThe term \"pharming\" is a neologism based on the words \"farming\" and \"phishing\".\nPhishing is a type of social-engineering attack to obtain access credentials,\nsuch as user names and passwords. In recent years, both pharming and phishing\nhave been used to gain information for online identity theft. Pharming has\nbecome of major concern to businesses hosting ecommerce and online banking\nwebsites. Sophisticated measures known as anti-pharming are required to protect\nagainst this serious threat. Antivirus software and spyware removal software\ncannot protect against pharming.\n","linknr":186,"url":"pharm","recorded":1362668951,"links":34,"instances":["computer","isp","computing","computer_security","telecommunication","computer_security"],"pdf":["http://www.ngssoftware.com/papers/ThePharmingGuide.pdf"],"categories":["Malware","Computer security exploits"],"headings":["Pharming vulnerability at home","Instances of pharming","Controversy over the use of the term","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["exploit","computer_security"],["vulnerability","computing"],["social_engineering","computer_security"],["threat","computer"],["vulnerability","computing"],["panix","isp"],["security_service","telecommunication"]],"members":["threat","panix","vulnerability","exploit","security_service","social_engineering"],"related":["Attacker","Website","Hosts_file","Exploit_(computer_security)","Vulnerability_(computing)","Domain_name_system","Software","IP_address","DNS_cache_poisoning","Neologism","Phishing","Social_engineering_(computer_security)","Authentication","User_name","Password","Online_identity_theft","Ecommerce","Online_banking","Anti-pharming","Threat_(computer)","Antivirus_software","Spyware_removal_software","Desktop_computer","Network_router","Local_Area_Network","Embedded_software","Firmware","Internet_Service_Provider","JavaScript","Man_in_the_middle_attack","Wireless_router","Vulnerability_(computing)","Dictionary_attack","Panix_(ISP)","Domain_hijacking","Australia","Symantec","Anti-Phishing_Working_Group","Phillip_Hallam-Baker","Marketing","Neologism","Security_service_(telecommunication)","DNS_cache_poisoning","IT_risk","Mutual_authentication","Page_hijacking","Trusteer"]}
