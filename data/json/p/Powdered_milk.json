{"cursor":"9209","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n'Powdered milk' or 'dried milk' is a manufactured dairy product made by\nevaporating milk to dryness. One purpose of drying milk is to preserve it; milk\npowder has a far longer shelf life than liquid milk and does not need to be\nrefrigerated, due to its low moisture content. Another purpose is to reduce its\nbulk for economy of transportation. Powdered milk and dairy products include\nsuch items as dry whole milk, nonfat dry milk, dry buttermilk, dry whey products\nand dry dairy blends. Many dairy products exported conform to standards laid out\nin Codex Alimentarius.\n\nPowdered milk is used for food and health (nutrition), and atypically also in\nbiotechnology (saturating agent).\n","linknr":254,"url":"Powdered_milk","recorded":1362580835,"links":43,"instances":["medicine","food","biology","biology"],"pdf":["http://www.nzic.org.nz/ChemProcesses/dairy/3C.pdf","http://www.interchim.fr/ft/7/768701.pdf"],"categories":["Convenience foods","Dried foods","Granular materials","Milk","Russian inventions"],"headings":["History and manufacture","Food and health uses","Use in biotechnology","See also","Notes","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8b/PowderedMilk.jpg/220px-PowderedMilk.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c8/Milk_powder_Incolac.jpg/220px-Milk_powder_Incolac.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["drying","food"],["insufflation","medicine"],["blot","biology"],["blotto","biology"]],"members":["insufflation","drying","blot","blotto"],"related":["Dairy_product","Milk","Drying_(food)","Shelf_life","Refrigeration","Whey","Codex_Alimentarius","Nutrition","Biotechnology","Marco_Polo","Mongols","Tatar","Kublai_Khan","Charles_Scribner's_Sons","Otto_Frederick_Hunziker","Spray_drying","Skimmed_milk","Pasteurization","Evaporator","Drum_drying","Caramelization","Freeze_drying","Bulk_density","Infant_formula","Confectionery","Caramel_candy","Rasgulla","Chum_chum","World_Food_Programme","Fallout_shelters","Survivalism","Hiking","Cocaine","Filmmaking","Theatrical_property","Insufflation_(medicine)","Potable_water","Amino_acids","Protein","Vitamins","Dietary_mineral","Lactose","Oxysterols","Free_radicals","Atherosclerosis","Powdered_eggs","Nido","Nestl√©","Belgomilk","FrieslandCampina","2008_Chinese_milk_scandal","Melamine","Adulterant","Sanlu","Infant_formula","Blot_(biology)","Nitrocellulose","PVDF","Nylon","Interchim","Blotto_(biology)","Protein","Casein","Baked_milk","Convenience_food","Coconut_milk_powder","Condensed_milk","Evaporated_milk","Scalded_milk"]}
