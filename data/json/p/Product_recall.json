{"cursor":"28949","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nA 'product recall' is a request to return to the maker a batch or an entire\nproduction run of a product, usually due to the discovery of safety issues. The\nrecall is an effort to limit liability for corporate negligence (which can cause\ncostly legal penalties) and to improve or avoid damage to publicity. Recalls are\ncostly to a company because they often entail replacing the recalled product or\npaying for damage caused by use, although possibly less costly than\nconsequential costs caused by damage to brand name and reduced trust in the\nmanufacturer.\n\nA country's consumer protection laws will have specific requirements in regard\nto product recalls. Such regulations may include how much of the cost the maker\nwill have to bear, situations in which a recall is compulsory (usually because\nthe risk is big enough), or penalties for failure to recall. The firm may also\ninitiate a recall voluntarily, perhaps subject to the same regulations as if the\nrecall were compulsory.\n","linknr":444,"url":"Product_recall","recorded":1362891076,"links":24,"instances":["microarchitecture","mechanical"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Product recalls|","Corporate scandals","Product liability"],"headings":["General steps to a product recall","Highlights of  major product recalls (1959-2012)","Product recall agencies by country","Recalls by Industry","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Ambox_globe_content.svg/48px-Ambox_globe_content.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["p5","microarchitecture"],["bearing","mechanical"]],"members":["p5","bearing"],"related":["Returning","Negligence","Publicity","Consumer_protection","Hotline","Website","General_Motors","1982_Chicago_Tylenol_murders","1986_Excedrin_Tampering","Cyanide","Stella_Nickell","Intel","P5_(microarchitecture)","Pentium_FDIV_bug","Burger_King","Burger_King_Pokemon_container_recall","Poke_Balls","Ford_Motor_Company","Firestone_Tire_and_Rubber_Company","Ford_Explorer","Sport_utility_vehicle","CEO","Jacques_Nasser","Firestone_vs_Ford_Motor_Company_controversy","Australia","Pan_Pharmaceuticals","Receivership","United_Kingdom","Canada","Sudan_I","Worcester_sauce","Ford_Power_Stroke_engine","Ford_Super_Duty","Ford_Excursion","Ford_Econoline","Republic_of_Ireland","United_Kingdom","Sony","Dell","Sony","Apple_Computer","United_States","Panasonic_Corporation","Toshiba","IBM","Lenovo","Hitachi,_Ltd.","Fujitsu","Sharp_Corporation","Lenovo","Sanyo","Menu_Foods","2007_pet_food_recalls","Ford_Motor_Company","Ford_Super_Duty","Hangzhou,_China","Ford_Motor_Company","Lead_Poisoning","Lead_Paint","Gerber_Products_Company","Rice_cereal","Nokia","Panasonic_Corporation","Topps_Meat_Company","Elizabeth,_New_Jersey","Honda_Motor_Company","Alltrade_Tools","Pharmaceutical_companies","Cough_medicine","Drug_overdose","Bindeez","1,4-Butanediol","1,5-pentanediol","Anesthetic","Gamma-Hydroxybutyric_acid","Sand_castle","Paricon","L._L._Bean","Curious_George","Doll","Lead_Poisoning","Hallmark/Westland_Meat_Pagacking_Company","Malt-O-Meal","Puffed_Rice","Puffed_Wheat","Salmonella","Malaysia","Automotive","Proton_Savvy","Bearing_(mechanical)","Maple_Leaf_Foods","2008_Canadian_listeriosis_outbreak","Sony","VAIO","Peanut_Corporation_of_America","Peanut_butter","Food_and_Drug_Administration","Setton_Pistachio","Terra_Bella,_California","Pistachio","Nestle's","Chocolate_chip_cookie","Toyota","Accelerator","Johnson_&_Johnson","McNeil_Consumer_Healthcare","Maytag","McDonalds","Shrek_Forever_After","Cadmium_poisoning","Kellogg's","Wright_County_Egg","Galt,_Iowa","Salmonella","Fisher_Price","Similac","Food_and_Drug_Administration","Nature's_Promise","IKEA","Honda","Medical_device","Diana_Zuckerman","National_Research_Center_for_Women_and_Families","Cleveland_Clinic","Food_and_Drug_Administration","National_Beef_Packing_Company","Tyson_Fresh_Meats","Tyson_Foods","Ground_Beef","E._coli","Frescolina","Ricotta_salata_cheese","2012_peanut_butter_recall","New_England_Compounding_Center","New_England_Compounding_Center_meningitis_outbreak","Kenny's_farmhouse","Nestle","Australian_Competition_and_Consumer_Commission","Health_Canada","Canadian_Food_Inspection_Agency","Transport_Canada","Germany","Germany","National_Consumer_Agency","Ireland","Medicines_and_Healthcare_products_Regulatory_Agency","Trading_Standards_Institute","Vehicle_and_Operator_Services_Agency","US_Coast_Guard","Consumer_Product_Safety_Commission","United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency","Federal_Aviation_Administration","Food_and_Drug_Administration","United_States_Department_of_Agriculture","National_Highway_Traffic_Safety_Administration","Financial_crisis","Warranty","Toy_safety","Lead_poisoning","Contamination_control","Track_and_trace"]}
