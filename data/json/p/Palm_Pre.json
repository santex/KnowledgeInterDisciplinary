The smartphone was the first to use\nPalm's Linux based mobile operating system, webOS. The\nPre functions as a camera phone, a portable media player, and has location and\nnavigation capabilities. The Pre also serves as a personal information manager,\nhas a number of communication and collaboration applications, and has Bluetooth\nand Wi-Fi connectivity built-in.\n\nThe Pre was launched in the United States of America on June 6, 2009 with\nSprint, and later in Canada with Bell Mobility. A GSM version of the original\nPre was launched later in 2009 on a number of networks in Europe and in Mexico.\nA revised model, the Palm Pre Plus, which doubled the available memory and\ninternal storage, was launched on January 25, 2010, for Verizon Wireless and\nlater released on AT&T Mobility on May 16, 2010. The third generation of Palm\nPre, the Palm Pre 2, which uses HP webOS 2.0 was announced October 2010. The\nPalm Pre became the fastest selling phone in Sprint's history.\n","linknr":661,"url":"Palm_Pre","recorded":1362897032,"links":30,"instances":["photography"],"pdf":[],"categories":["2009 introductions","GPS navigation devices","Linux-based devices","Palm mobile phones","HP WebOS devices","HP WebOS","Palm, Inc.","QWERTY mobile phones","Smartphones","Multi-touch mobile phones"],"headings":["History and availability","Internal hardware","Developer Mode","Software","Information gathering by Palm","Reception","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/Palm_Pre.jpg/220px-Palm_Pre.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/Touchstone_Palm.JPG/220px-Touchstone_Palm.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/Newpalmlogo.svg/100px-Newpalmlogo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/86/XO_Motherboard.png/100px-XO_Motherboard.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["flash","photography#modern_flash_technology"],["flash","photography"]],"members":["flash"],"related":["Palm,_Inc.","Smartphone","Sprint_Nextel","Bell_Mobility","Telefónica_Europe","Movistar","Verizon_Wireless","Palm_webOS","Volt","MAh","Lithium-ion_battery","Hertz","Underclocking","Texas_Instruments","OMAP_3430","ARM_architecture","PowerVR","Flash_memory","Gigabyte","Megabyte","Double_data_rate","Dynamic_random_access_memory","Double_data_rate","Dynamic_random_access_memory","Pixel","HVGA","Liquid_crystal_display","Multi-touch","Touchscreen","Low-key_lighting","Accelerometer","LED","Depth_of_field","Geotagging","Wi-Fi","802.11b/g","MicroUSB","Assisted_GPS","Dual_band","CDMA2000","Quad_band","GSM","GSM_frequency_ranges","General_Packet_Radio_Service","Enhanced_Data_Rates_for_GSM_Evolution","Dual_band","Universal_Mobile_Telecommunications_System","UMTS_frequency_bands","High-Speed_Downlink_Packet_Access","Palm_Pre_2","Palm_Pixi","Multimedia","Smartphone","Palm,_Inc.","Multi-touch","Linux","Mobile_operating_system","WebOS","Camera_phone","Portable_media_player","GPS","Personal_information_manager","Bluetooth","Wi-Fi","United_States_of_America","Sprint_Nextel","Bell_Mobility","GSM","RAM","Verizon_Wireless","AT&T_Mobility","Palm_Pre_2","Palm_Inc","Consumer_Electronics_Show","Texas_Instruments_OMAP","Sprint_Nextel","CDMA2000","IPhone","User_interface","Patent_infringement","Apple_Inc.","Timothy_D._Cook","Intellectual_Property","Patent","Verizon_Wireless","Dan_Hesse","Telefónica_Europe","Chief_operating_officer","Dennis_Strigl","Telcel","Palm_Pre_Plus","Pixi_Plus","Pixi_Plus","AT&T","US$","Gorilla_glass","Texas_Instruments_OMAP","ARM_architecture","PowerVR","Underclock","HVGA","Liquid-crystal_display","QWERTY_keyboard","Accelerometer","Ambient_light_sensor","Proximity_sensor","Digital_camera","LED","Flash_(photography)","EVDO","UMTS","HSDPA","IEEE_802.11g-2003","A-GPS","Turn-by-turn_navigation","Assisted_GPS","Verizon_Wireless","MicroUSB","Tethering","Gigabyte","Flash_storage","Flash_memory_card","Gigabyte","Flash_storage","Universal_serial_bus","Wireless_charging","Electromagnetic_induction","Konami_Code","WebOS","Linux","Palm_OS","Computer_multitasking","Multi-touch","Virtual_keyboard","Gmail","Yahoo!","LinkedIn","Microsoft_Outlook","ActiveSync","Cloud_computing","Data_synchronization","Palm_Desktop","Microsoft_Outlook","IBM_Lotus_Notes","Mark/Space,_Inc.","Macintosh","Chapura","WebOS","Debian","CNET","Consumer_Electronics_Show","Swan_song","Mobile_device","OMAP"]}
