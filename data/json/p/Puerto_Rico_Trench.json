The purple sea floor at the center of the view is\nthe Puerto Rico trench, the deepest part of the Atlantic Ocean and the\nCaribbean Sea.]]\n\nThe 'Puerto Rico Trench' is an oceanic trench located on the boundary between\nthe Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. The trench is associated with a\ncomplex transition between the subduction zone, to the south along the Lesser\nAntilles island arc, and the major transform fault zone or plate boundary, which\nextends west between Cuba and Hispaniola through the Cayman Trench to the coast\nof Central America. Scientific studies have concluded that an earthquake\noccurring along this fault zone could generate a significant tsunami.\n\nThe island of Puerto Rico lies immediately to the south of the fault zone and\nthe trench. The trench is long and has a maximum depth of at Milwaukee Deep,\nwhich is the deepest point in the Atlantic Ocean and the deepest point not in\nthe Pacific Ocean. It suffered a tsunami soon after the earthquake of 1918.\n","linknr":236,"url":"Puerto_Rico_Trench","recorded":1362505558,"links":36,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/fs141-00/fs141-00.pdf","http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/fs141-00/fs141-00.pdf"],"categories":["Geography of Puerto Rico","Geology of Puerto Rico","Geology of the Caribbean","Natural history of the Caribbean","Oceanic trenches of the Atlantic Ocean","Oceanic trenches of the Caribbean Sea","Physical oceanography"],"headings":["Geology","Public awareness","Earthquake history","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4e/Caribbean-map.gif/300px-Caribbean-map.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e2/Atlantic-trench.JPG/300px-Atlantic-trench.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/PRtrenchlocation.jpg/300px-PRtrenchlocation.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/28/Flag_of_Puerto_Rico.svg/32px-Flag_of_Puerto_Rico.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/6b/Terrestrial_globe.svg/29px-Terrestrial_globe.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Oceanic_trench","Caribbean_Sea","Atlantic_Ocean","Subduction_zone","Lesser_Antilles","Island_arc","Transform_fault","Cuba","Hispaniola","Cayman_Trench","Central_America","Tsunami","Puerto_Rico","Milwaukee_Deep","Pacific_Ocean","Tectonic_plate","Subduction","Caribbean_Plate","North_American_Plate","Volcano","South_America","United_States_Virgin_Islands","British_Virgin_Islands","Dominican_Republic","Earthquake","Tsunami","Puerto_Rico","2004_Indian_Ocean_earthquake","Indian_Ocean","United_States","Tsunami_warning_system","United_States_Geological_Survey","1918_Puerto_Rico_Earthquake","Tsunami","Santo_Domingo","Dominican_Republic","Cayey,_Puerto_Rico","Salinas,_Puerto_Rico","Anegada_Trough","Mona_Canyon","Plate_tectonics","Mariana_Trench"]}
