The term proteomics was first\ncoined in 1997 to make an analogy with genomics, the study of the\ngenes. The word proteome is a blend of 'prote'in and gen'ome', and was coined by\nMarc Wilkins in 1994 while working on the concept as a PhD student. [http://www.babs.unsw.edu.au/directory.php?personnelID=12\nUNSW Staff Bio: Professor Marc Wilkins] The proteome is the entire\ncomplement of proteins, including the modifications\nmade to a particular set of proteins, produced by an organism or system. This\nwill vary with time and distinct requirements, or stresses, that a cell or\norganism undergoes. Proteomics is an interdisciplinary formed on the basis of\nthe research and development of the Human Genome Project, is also an emerging\nscientific research and exploration of the proteome research from the overall\nlevel of intracellular protein composition, structure, and its own unique\nactivity patterns. It is an important component of functional genomics.\n\nWhile proteomics generally refers to the large-scale experimental analysis of\nproteins, it is often specifically used for protein purification and mass\nspectrometry.\n","linknr":587,"url":"Proteomics","recorded":1362507613,"links":51,"instances":["geneticist","medicine","proteomics","fastpp"],"pdf":["http://psb.stanford.edu/psb-online/proceedings/psb08/alterovitz.pdf","http://psb.stanford.edu/psb-online/proceedings/psb08/alterovitz.pdf","http://www.allhands.org.uk/2005/proceedings/papers/525.pdf"],"categories":["Proteomics|","Genomics","Bioinformatics","Proteins"],"headings":["Complexity of the problem","Limitations of genomics and proteomics studies","Methods of studying proteins","Establishing proteinâ€“protein interactions","Practical applications of proteomics","See also","References","Bibliography","External links","({{NoMoreLinks}})",""],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/Protein_pattern_analyzer.jpg/300px-Protein_pattern_analyzer.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Wikibooks-logo-en-noslogan.svg/40px-Wikibooks-logo-en-noslogan.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/Wikiversity-logo.svg/40px-Wikiversity-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["marc_wilkins","geneticist"],["protomap","proteomics"],["fast_parallel_proteolysis","fastpp"],["biomarker","medicine"],["biomarker","medicine"]],"members":["marc_wilkins","biomarker","protomap","fast_parallel_proteolysis"],"related":["Mass_spectrometry","Protein","Protein_structure","Functional_genomics","Metabolic_pathways","Biological_cell","Genomics","Gene","Blend","Marc_Wilkins_(geneticist)","Proteome","Transcriptomics","Phosphorylation","Enzymes","Cell_signaling","Serine","Threonine","Kinase","Tyrosine","Kinases","Ubiquitin","E3_ubiquitin_ligase","Biochemistry","Phosphorylation","Ubiquitination","Methylation","Acetylation","Glycosylation","Oxidation","Nitrosylation","MRNA","Phosphoproteomics","Glycoproteomics","Alternative_splicing","ELISA","Mass_Spectrometric_Immunoassay","SISCAPA","Antibody","Phosphorylated","Sugar","Glycosylation","Lectins","Two-dimensional_gel_electrophoresis","Protomap_(proteomics)","SDS-PAGE","Shotgun_proteomics","Proteolysis","Post_translational_modification","Antibodies","Biochemistry","Cell_biology","ELISA","Matrix-assisted_laser_desorption/ionization","Electrospray_ionization","Fast_parallel_proteolysis_(FASTpp)","E._coli","Cancer","Point_mutations","Fetal_protein","Whole_blood","Neonate","Biomarker_(medicine)","Biomarker_(medicine)","Cell_signaling","Two-hybrid_screening","Protein_microarray","Immunoaffinity_chromatography","Mass_spectrometry","Dual_polarisation_interferometry","Microscale_Thermophoresis","Western_blot","Immunohistochemical_staining","Enzyme_linked_immunosorbent_assay","Mass_spectrometry","Secretomics","Secretory_protein","Proteogenomics","Mass_spectrometry","Activity_based_proteomics","Bioinformatics","Bottom-up_proteomics","Cytomics","Functional_genomics","Genomics","Immunomics","Immunoproteomics","Lipidomics","List_of_biological_databases","List_of_omics_topics_in_biology","Metabolomics","PEGylation","Phosphoproteomics","Proteogenomics","Proteomic_chemistry","Secretomics","Shotgun_proteomics","Top-down_proteomics","Systems_biology","Transcriptomics","Yeast_two-hybrid_system","Human_Protein_Reference_Database","National_Center_for_Biotechnology_Information","Protein_Data_Bank","Protein_Information_Resource","Proteomics_Identifications_Database","Proteopedia","Swiss-Prot","UniProt","European_Bioinformatics_Institute","Netherlands_Proteomics_Centre"]}
