{"cursor":"22594","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\nA 'plasmid' is a small DNA molecule that is physically separate from, and can\nreplicate independently of, chromosomal DNA within a cell. Most commonly found\nas small circular, double-stranded DNA molecules in bacteria, plasmids are\nsometimes present in archaea and eukaryotic organisms. In nature, plasmids carry\ngenes that may benefit survival of the organism (e.g. antibiotic resistance),\nand can frequently be transmitted from one bacterium to another (even of another\nspecies) via horizontal gene transfer. Artificial plasmids are widely used as\nvectors in molecular cloning, serving to drive the replication of recombinant\nDNA sequences within host organisms.\n\nPlasmid sizes vary from 1 to over 1,000 kbp. The number of identical plasmids in\na single cell can range anywhere from one to thousands under some circumstances.\nPlasmids can be considered part of the mobilome because they are often\nassociated with conjugation, a mechanism of horizontal gene transfer.\n\nThe term plasmid was first introduced by the American molecular biologist Joshua\nLederberg in 1952.\n\nPlasmids are considered [[replicon (genetics)|replicon]]s, capable of\nreplicating autonomously within a suitable host. Plasmids can be found in all\nthree major domains: Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya. Similar\nto viruses, plasmids are not considered by some to be a form of life.\nUnlike viruses, plasmids are naked DNA and do not encode genes necessary to\nencase the genetic material for transfer to a new host, though some classes of\nplasmids encode the sex pilus necessary for their own transfer. Plasmid host-to-\nhost transfer requires direct mechanical transfer by conjugation, or changes in\nincipient host gene expression allowing the intentional uptake of the genetic\nelement by transformation. Microbial transformation with plasmid DNA is neither\nparasitic nor symbiotic in nature, because each implies the presence of an\nindependent species living in a commensal or detrimental state with the host\norganism. Rather, plasmids provide a mechanism for horizontal gene transfer\nwithin a population of microbes and typically provide a selective advantage\nunder a given environmental state. Plasmids may carry genes that provide\nresistance to naturally occurring antibiotics in a competitive environmental\nniche, or the proteins produced may act as toxins under similar circumstances.\nPlasmids can also provide bacteria with the ability to fix nitrogen or to\ndegrade recalcitrant organic compounds that provide an advantage when nutrients\nare scarce.\n","linknr":371,"url":"Plasmids","recorded":1362501048,"links":71,"instances":["biology","biology","genetics","molecular_biology"],"pdf":["http://www.gtmb.org/VOL6A/GTMBVOL6APDF/INDIVIDUAL/03%20%20Bode.pdf","http://www.gtmb.org/VOL6A/GTMBVOL6APDF/INDIVIDUAL/03%20%20Bode.pdf","http://www.gtmb.org/VOL10B/INDIVIDUAL/25.%20Nehlsen%20et%20al,%20233-244.pdf","http://www.gtmb.org/VOL10B/INDIVIDUAL/25.%20Nehlsen%20et%20al,%20233-244.pdf","http://www.biomedcentral.com/content/pdf/1472-6750-10-20.pdf","http://www.biomedcentral.com/content/pdf/1472-6750-10-20.pdf"],"categories":["Molecular biology","Mobile genetic elements","Molecular biology techniques","Gene delivery"],"headings":["Vectors","Applications","Episomes","Types","Plasmid maintenance","Yeast plasmids","Plasmid DNA extraction","Conformations","Simulation of plasmids","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cf/Plasmid_%28english%29.svg/300px-Plasmid_%28english%29.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/Plasmid_replication_%28english%29.svg/400px-Plasmid_replication_%28english%29.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/Conjugation.svg/250px-Conjugation.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/DNA_Under_electron_microscope_Image_3576B-PH.jpg/220px-DNA_Under_electron_microscope_Image_3576B-PH.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/10/Plasmid_emNL.jpg/220px-Plasmid_emNL.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/6c/Wiki_letter_w.svg/44px-Wiki_letter_w.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["vector","molecular_biology"],["cell","biology"],["domain","biology"],["transformation","genetics"],["vector","molecular_biology"]],"members":["domain","cell","transformation","vector"],"related":["DNA","GDNA","Bacteria","Archaea","Eukaryote","Antibiotic_resistance","Horizontal_gene_transfer","Vector_(molecular_biology)","Molecular_cloning","Recombinant_DNA","Base_pair","Cell_(biology)","Mobilome","Bacterial_conjugation","Horizontal_gene_transfer","United_States","Molecular_biology","Joshua_Lederberg","Domain_(biology)","Archaea","Bacteria","Eukarya","Virus","Pilus","Bacterial_conjugation","Transformation_(genetics)","Antibiotics","Toxin","Nitrogen_fixation","Chromosome","Genetic_engineering","Vector_(molecular_biology)","Multiple_cloning_site","Restriction_sites","Lysis","Alkaline_lysis","Insulin","Antibiotic","Base_pair","Lambda_phage","Cosmid","Bacterial_artificial_chromosome","Yeast_artificial_chromosome","Adeno-associated_virus","Zinc_finger_nucleases","Isogenic_human_disease_models","Gene_therapy","Gene","Chromosome","Genome","Zinc_finger_nuclease","Homologous_recombination","Herpesviridae","Adenoviruses","Polyomavirus","Double_minute","Poxvirus","Rolling_circle","Epstein-Barr_virus","Kaposi's_sarcoma-associated_herpesvirus","Oncogenes","Lytic_cycle","Innate_immunity","Bacterial_conjugation","F-plasmid","Bacterial_conjugation","Antibiotic","Poison","Bacteriocin","Protein","Toluene","Salicylic_acid","Pathogen","Cell_division","Partition_system","Hok/sok_system","Poison","Antidote","Literature","Plasmid_preparation","Restriction_digest","Electrophoresis","Extension_cord","Restriction_digest","Gel_electrophoresis","Molecular_biology","Bioinformatics","Software","DNA","Restriction_enzymes","Geneious","Vector_NTI","Bacterial_artificial_chromosome","Triparental_mating","Transposon","Bacteriophage","Provirus","Segrosome"]}
