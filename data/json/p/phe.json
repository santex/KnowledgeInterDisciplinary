This\nessential amino acid is classified as nonpolar because of the hydrophobic nature\nof the benzyl side chain. <small>L</small>-Phenylalanine (LPA) is an\nelectrically neutral amino acid, one of the twenty common amino acids used to\nbiochemically form proteins, coded for by DNA. The codons for <small>L</small>-\nphenylalanine are UUU and UUC. Phenylalanine is a precursor for tyrosine, the\nmonoamine signaling molecules dopamine, norepinephrine (noradrenaline), and\nepinephrine (adrenaline), and the skin pigment melanin.\n\nPhenylalanine is found naturally in the breast milk of mammals. It is used in\nthe manufacture of food and drink products and sold as a nutritional supplement\nfor its reputed analgesic and antidepressant effects. It is a direct precursor\nto the neuromodulator phenylethylamine, a commonly used dietary supplement.\n","title":"phenylalanine","headings":["Other biological roles","Phenylketonuria","<small>D</small>-, <small>L</small>- and <small>DL</small>-phenylalanine","Commercial synthesis","History","See also","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["4: Phenylketonuria","3: Tyrosine","3: Dopamine","3: Norepinephrine","2: Amino_acid","2: Epinephrine","2: Analgesic","2: Antidepressant","2: Bloodâbrain_barrier","2: Aspartame","2: Glycine","2: NMDA_receptor","2: Genome","1: Chemical_formula","1: Essential_amino_acid","1: Nonpolar","1: Hydrophobic","1: Benzyl","1: Protein","1: DNA","1: Codons","1: Monoamine","1: Pigment","1: Melanin","1: Phenylethylamine","1: L-DOPA","1: Catecholamines","1: Tryptophan","1: Serotonin","1: Flavonoid_biosynthesis","1: Lignan","1: Cinnamic_acid","1: Phenylalanine_ammonia-lyase","1: Hyperphenylalaninemia","1: Coenzyme","1: Biopterin","1: Macaques","1: Stereoisomer","1: Organic_synthesis","1: Enantiomer","1: Racemic","1: Protein_biosynthesis","1: Processed_food","1: Pharmacological_activity","1: Enkephalin","1: Chemical_decomposition","1: Enzyme","1: Carboxypeptidase_A","1: Protein_precursor","1: Neurotransmitters","1: Portal_circulation","1: Systemic_circulation","1: Urine","1: Competitive_antagonist","1: Glutamate","1: AMPA_receptor","1: Schild_regression","1: Neurotransmitter","1: Glutamatergic","1: Synapses","1: Hippocampus","1: Cerebral_cortex","1: IC50","1: Aromatic_amino_acid","1: Genetic_engineering","1: Genes","1: Empirical_formula","1: Lupinus_luteus","1: Emil_Erlenmeyer","1: Phenylacetaldehyde","1: Codon","1: J._Heinrich_Matthaei","1: Marshall_W._Nirenberg","1: RNA","1: Uracil","1: Proteome","1: Hyperphenylalanemia"]}
