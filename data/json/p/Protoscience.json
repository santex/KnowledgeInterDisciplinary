[http://www.phy.syr.edu/courses/modules/PSEUDO/moller.html\nQuestions to help distinguish a pseudoscience from a protoscience (a new science\ntrying to establish its legitimacy)]. Adapted from \"BCS Debates a Qi Gong\nMaster,\" Rational Enquirer, Vol 6, No. 4, Apr 94 Protoscience is\ndistinguished from pseudoscience by its standard practices of good science, such\nas a willingness to be disproven by new evidence, or to be replaced by a more\npredictive theory. Compare fringe science, which is considered highly\nspeculative or even strongly refuted. Some protosciences go on to\nbecome an accepted part of mainstream science. [http://www2.fiu.edu/~mizrachs/truzzi.html Reflections on the reception\nof unconventional claims in science], newsletter Center for Frontier Sciences,\nTemple University (1990).\n\nAll sciences would have qualified as protosciences before the Age of\nEnlightenment, since the scientific method still hadn't been developed, and\nthere was no structured way to prove legitimacy. A standard example is alchemy,\nwhich from the 18th century became chemistry, or pre-modern astrology which from\nthe 17th century became astronomy.\n","recorded":1362124696,"portal":[],"list":[],"links":"289","instances":["physics","soil_study"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Scientific method"],"headings":["Definitions","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"tags":[["plasma","physics"],["pedology","soil_study"]],"image":["http://en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","http://bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","http://bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"related":["Philosophy_of_science","Pseudoscience","Fringe_science","Scientific_consensus","Temple_University","Age_of_Enlightenment","Scientific_method","Alchemy","Chemistry","Astrology","Astronomy","Philosopher_of_chemistry","General_relativity","String_theory","Karl_Popper","Imre_Lakatos","Thomas_Kuhn","Hypothesis","Methodical_culturalism","Obsolete_scientific_theories","Pathological_science","List_of_topics_characterized_as_pseudoscience","History_of_science","Philosophy_of_science"],"members":["plasma","pedology"],"book":[]}
