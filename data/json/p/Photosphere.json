The term itself is derived from Ancient\nGreek roots, Ïá¿¶Ï, ÏÏÏÏÏ/phos, photos meaning \"light\" and ÏÏÎ±á¿ÏÎ±/sphaira\nmeaning \"sphere\", in reference to the fact that it is a spherical surface that\nis perceived to emit light. It extends into a star's surface until the plasma\nbecomes opaque, equivalent to an optical depth of approximately\n2/3. {{cite book\n| author=Carroll and Ostlie year=1996 title=Modern Astrophysics publisher=Addison-\n| Wesley location= id=}}\nIn other words, a photosphere is the deepest region of a luminous object,\nusually a star, that is transparent to photons of certain wavelengths.\n","linknr":427,"url":"Photosphere","recorded":1362669287,"links":58,"instances":["physics","solar_physics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Stellar astronomy","Sun","Light sources"],"headings":["Effective temperature","The Sun","Other layers","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/Sun_Atmosphere_Temperature_and_Density_SkyLab.jpg/300px-Sun_Atmosphere_Temperature_and_Density_SkyLab.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d9/Yohkohimage.gif/155px-Yohkohimage.gif","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5f/He1523a.jpg/15px-He1523a.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["plasma","physics"],["orders_of_magnitude","density#-4"],["granule","solar_physics"]],"members":["plasma","orders_of_magnitude","granule"],"related":["Astronomical_object","Ancient_Greek","Plasma_(physics)","Optical_depth","Stefan–Boltzmann_law","Thermal_equilibrium","Plane_parallel_geometry","Eddington_approximation","Neutron_star","Sun","Star","Kelvin","Density","Kilogram","Cubic_meter","Convection_cell","Granule_(solar_physics)","Kilometer","Chromosphere","H-alpha","Corona","Solar_flare","Sunspot"]}
