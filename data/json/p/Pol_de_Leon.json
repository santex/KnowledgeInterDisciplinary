Paul Aurelian was held to have died in 575 at\nthe age of 140 years, after having been assisted in his labours by three\nsuccessive coadjutors, which suggests several Pauls have been mixed up. Gilbert\nHunter Doble thought he might be the same man as Saint Paulinus of Wales.\n","linknr":185,"url":"Pol_de_Leon","recorded":1362564652,"links":26,"instances":["vestment"],"pdf":[],"categories":["6th-century deaths","Breton bishops","Medieval Breton saints","People from Glamorgan","Medieval Welsh saints","6th-century bishops","6th-century Christian saints","Medieval Cornish saints","Medieval French saints","Early Middle Ages"],"headings":["Family","Career","Paulinus of Wales","See also","References","Sources"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/Etole_de_Saint_Paul_Aur%C3%A9lien.jpg/200px-Etole_de_Saint_Paul_Aur%C3%A9lien.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/3a/Thegonnec_-_St_Pol.jpg/200px-Thegonnec_-_St_Pol.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/48/Gloriole_blur.svg/32px-Gloriole_blur.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/79/P_christianity.svg/31px-P_christianity.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7d/Flag_of_Brittany.svg/32px-Flag_of_Brittany.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["stole","vestment"]],"members":["stole"],"related":["Anglicanism","Roman_Catholic_Church","Stole_(vestment)","Breton_language","Latin","Welsh_people","See_of_Léon","Seven_founder_saints_of_Brittany","Gilbert_Hunter_Doble","Hagiography","Wrmonoc","Landévennec","Penychen","Glamorgan","Juthwara","Sativola","Llancarfan","Gwynllyw","Cantref","Gwynllwg","Glywys","Illtud","Llantwit_Major","Caldey_Island","Samson_of_Dol","Gildas","Monastery","Finistère","Ushant","Île_de_Batz","Saint-Pol-de-Léon","Childebert_I","Christian_vegetarianism","Île_de_Batz","Relic","Fleury_Abbey","Feast_day","G._H._Doble","Carmarthenshire","Wales","Hermit","Whitland","Llandovery","Saint_David","Teilo","Synod_of_Brefi","Paul,_Cornwall","Caeo","Carmarthenshire","Carmarthen_Museum","Early_Middle_Ages","Gilbert_Hunter_Doble","Gilbert_Hunter_Doble","Truro"]}
