Pith is composed of soft, spongy parenchyma cells, which store and\n transport nutrients throughout the plant. In eudicots, pith is located in the\n center of the stem. In monocots, it extends also into flowering stems and\n roots. The pith is encircled by a ring of xylem; outside followed by a ring\n of phloem.\n\nWhile new pith growth is usually white or pale in color, as the tissue ages it\ncommonly darkens to a deeper brown color. In trees pith is generally present in\nyoung growth, but in the trunk and older branches the pith often gets replaced -\nin great part - by xylem. In some plants, the pith in the middle of the stem may\ndry out and disintegrate, resulting in a hollow stem. A few plants, such as\nwalnuts, have distinctive chambered pith with numerous short cavities (See image\nat bottom right). The cells in the peripheral parts of the pith may, in some\nplants, develop to be different from cells in the rest of the pith. This layer\nof cells is then called the perimedullary region of the pithamus. An example of\nthis can be observed in Hedera helix, a species of ivy.\n\nThe term pith is also used to refer to the pale, spongy inner layer of the rind\n- more properly called mesocarp or albedo - of citrus fruits (such as oranges)\nand other hesperidia. The word comes from the Old English word piÃ¾a, meaning\nsubstance, akin to Middle Dutch pitt, meaning the pit of a fruit.\n\nThe pith of the sola or other similar plants is used to make the pith\nhelmet.

There is an easy primitive process of\nstarch extraction from sago pith that leaches away a sufficient amount of the\ntoxins and thus only the starch component is consumed. The form of the starch\nafter processing is similar to tapioca.\n","linknr":130,"url":"Pith","recorded":1362485725,"links":26,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Plant physiology","Plant morphology","Plant anatomy"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/72/Elder_pith.jpg/250px-Elder_pith.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c1/Walnut_pith.jpg/250px-Walnut_pith.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0b/Taxus_wood.jpg/250px-Taxus_wood.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Wood","Plant_stem","Vascular_plant","Parenchyma","Eudicot","Monocot","Xylem","Phloem","Tree","Xylem","Walnut","Ivy","Mesocarp","Citrus","Hesperidium","Old_English","Middle_Dutch","Aeschynomene_aspera","Pith_helmet","Sago","Melanesia","Micronesia","Tapioca"]}
