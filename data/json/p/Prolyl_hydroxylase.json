The systematic\nname of this enzyme class is 'procollagen-L-proline,2-oxoglutarate:oxygen\noxidoreductase (4-hydroxylating)'. Other names in common use include\n'protocollagen hydroxylase', 'proline hydroxylase', 'proline,2-oxoglutarate 4-\ndioxygenase', 'collagen proline hydroxylase', 'hydroxylase, collagen proline',\n'peptidyl proline hydroxylase', 'proline protocollagen hydroxylase', 'proline,\n2-oxoglutarate dioxygenase', 'prolyl hydroxylase', 'prolylprotocollagen\ndioxygenase', 'prolylprotocollagen hydroxylase', 'protocollagen proline 4-\nhydroxylase', 'protocollagen proline dioxygenase', 'protocollagen proline\nhydroxylase', 'protocollagen prolyl hydroxylase', 'prolyl 4-hydroxylase', 'prolyl-glycyl-\npeptide, 2-oxoglutarate:oxygen oxidoreductase,', '4-hydroxylating', and 'procollagen-\nproline 4-dioxygenase'. This enzyme participates in arginine and proline\nmetabolism. It has 2 cofactors: iron, and Ascorbate.\n","linknr":547,"url":"Prolyl_hydroxylase","recorded":1362481933,"links":21,"instances":["biochemistry","biochemistry","chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Human 2OG oxygenases","EC 1.14.11","Iron enzymes","Ascorbate enzymes","Enzymes of known structure"],"headings":["Structural studies","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/b/e/ebe1915c432cf9c372b4ecfe36ff1fa2.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["substrate","biochemistry"],["product","chemistry"],["cofactor","biochemistry"]],"members":["cofactor","substrate","product"],"related":["Enzymology","Enzyme","Catalysis","Chemical_reaction","Substrate_(biochemistry)","Procollagen_L-proline","2-oxoglutarate","Oxygen","Product_(chemistry)","Procollagen_trans-4-hydroxy-L-proline","Succinate","Carbon_dioxide","Oxidoreductase","Arginine_and_proline_metabolism","Cofactor_(biochemistry)","Iron","Ascorbate","Tertiary_structure","Protein_Data_Bank","PROSITE"]}
