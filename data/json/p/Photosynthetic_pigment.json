The reason that there are so many pigments is that each\nabsorbs light more efficiently in a different part of the electromagnetic\nspectrum. Chlorophyll a absorbs well at a wavelength of about 400-450 nm and at\n650-700 nm; chlorophyll b at 450-500 nm and at 600-650 nm. Xanthophyll absorbs\nwell at 400-530 nm. However, none of the pigments absorbs well in the green-\nyellow region, which is responsible for the abundant green we see in nature.\n[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHGAWlGd0NI Link to video] of CCM300 portable\nchorophyll content meter being used to measure cholorophyll content of small\nsamples.\n\nBacteria Like plants, the cyanobacteria use water as an electron donor for\nphotosynthesis and therefore liberate oxygen; they also use chlorophyll as a\npigment. In addition, most cyanobacteria use phycobiliproteins, water soluble\npigments which occur in the cytoplasm of the chloroplast, to capture light\nenergy and pass it on to the chlorophylls. (Some cyanobacteria, the\nprochlorophytes, use chlorophyll b instead of phycobilin.) It is thought that\nthe chloroplasts in plants and algae all evolved from cyanobacteria.\n\nSeveral other groups of bacteria use the bacteriochlorophyll pigments (similar\nto the chlorophylls) for photosynthesis. Unlike the cyanobacteria, these\nbacteria do not produce oxygen; they typically use hydrogen sulfide rather than\nwater as the electron donor.\n\nRecently, a very different pigment has been found in some marine Î³-\nproteobacteria: proteorhodopsin. It is similar to and probably originated from\nbacteriorhodopsin (see below under archaea).\n\nAlgae Green algae, red algae and glaucophytes all use chlorophylls. Red algae\nand glaucophytes also use phycobiliproteins, but green algae do not.\n\nArchaea Halobacteria use the pigment bacteriorhodopsin which acts directly as a\nproton pump when exposed to light.\n\nReferences\n","linknr":127,"url":"Photosynthetic_pigment","recorded":1362893168,"links":19,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.fao.org/ag/agn/jecfa-additives/specs/Monograph1/Additive-128.pdf"],"categories":["Photosynthetic pigments|"],"headings":["Plants","Bacteria","Algae","Archaea","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Plant","Carotene","Xanthophyll","Phaeophytin","Phaeophytin","Chlorophyll_a","Chlorophyll","Electromagnetic_spectrum","Cyanobacteria","Oxygen","Phycobiliprotein","Bacteriochlorophyll","Hydrogen_sulfide","Proteobacteria","Proteorhodopsin","Green_algae","Red_algae","Glaucophyte","Phycobiliprotein","Halobacteria","Bacteriorhodopsin","Proton_pump"]}
