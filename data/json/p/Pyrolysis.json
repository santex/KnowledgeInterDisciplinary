It involves the simultaneous\nchange of chemical composition and physical phase, and is irreversible. The word\nis coined from the Greek-derived elements pyro \"fire\" and [[lysis]]\n\"separating\".\n\nPyrolysis is a case of thermolysis, and is most commonly used for organic\nmaterials, being, therefore, one of the processes involved in charring. The\npyrolysis of wood, which starts at , [http://virtual.vtt.fi/virt-\nual/innofirewood/stateoftheart/database/burning/burning.html Burning of wood],\nInnoFireWood's website. Accessed on 2010-02-06. occurs for example in\nfires where solid fuels are burning or when vegetation comes into contact with\nlava in volcanic eruptions. In general, pyrolysis of organic substances produces\ngas and liquid products and leaves a solid residue richer in carbon content,\nchar. Extreme pyrolysis, which leaves mostly carbon as the residue, is called\ncarbonization.\n\nThe process is used heavily in the chemical industry, for example, to produce\ncharcoal, activated carbon, methanol, and other chemicals from wood, to convert\nethylene dichloride into vinyl chloride to make PVC, to produce coke from coal,\nto convert biomass into syngas and biochar, to turn waste into safely disposable\nsubstances, and for transforming medium-weight hydrocarbons from oil into\nlighter ones like gasoline. These specialized uses of pyrolysis may be called\nvarious names, such as dry distillation, destructive distillation, or cracking.\n\nPyrolysis also plays an important role in several cooking procedures, such as\nbaking, frying, grilling, and caramelizing. In addition, it is a tool of\nchemical analysis, for example, in mass spectrometry and in carbon-14 dating.\nIndeed, many important chemical substances, such as phosphorus and sulfuric\nacid, were first obtained by this process. Pyrolysis has been assumed to take\nplace during catagenesis, the conversion of buried organic matter to fossil\nfuels. It is also the basis of pyrography. In their embalming process, the\nancient Egyptians used a mixture of substances, including methanol, which they\nobtained from the pyrolysis of wood.\n\nPyrolysis differs from other high-temperature processes like combustion and\nhydrolysis in that it usually does not involve reactions with oxygen, water, or\nany other reagents. In practice, it is not possible to achieve a completely oxygen-\nfree atmosphere. Because some oxygen is present in any pyrolysis system, a small\namount of oxidation occurs.\n\nThe term has also been applied to the decomposition of organic material in the\npresence of superheated water or steam (hydrous pyrolysis), for example, in the\nsteam cracking of oil.\n","linknr":423,"url":"Pyrolysis","recorded":1362500036,"links":55,"instances":["food","geology","chemistry","fuel","cooking"],"pdf":["http://www.thw.ctw.utwente.nl/research/Fuelconv/bramer.pdf","http://www.alexmarshall.me.uk/index_files/documents/CIWM.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20061218035002/http://www.geagroup.com/imperia/md/content/presse/2005.11.30_presentation_dr_plass_e.pdf","http://www.geagroup.com/imperia/md/content/presse/2005.11.30_presentation_dr_plass_e.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20061218035002/http://www.geagroup.com/imperia/md/content/presse/2005.11.30_presentation_dr_plass_e.pdf"],"categories":["Pyrolysis","Organic reactions","Chemical engineering","Chemical processes","Industrial processes","Oil shale technology","Biodegradable waste management","Waste treatment technology","Fire protection"],"headings":["Occurrence and uses","Processes","Industrial sources","Chemistry","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/d9/Pyrolysis.svg/220px-Pyrolysis.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/15px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["coke","fuel"],["cracking","chemistry"],["catagenesis","geology"],["fiber","food"],["basting","cooking"],["coke","fuel"],["cracking","chemistry"]],"members":["fiber","catagenesis","cracking","coke","basting"],"related":["Thermochemical","Decomposition","Organic_matter","Oxygen","Chemical_composition","Greek_language","Morpheme","Thermolysis","Organic_compound","Charring","Volcanic_eruption","Char","Carbon","Carbonization","Chemical_industry","Charcoal","Activated_carbon","Methanol","Ethylene_dichloride","Vinyl_chloride","PVC","Coke_(fuel)","Coal","Biomass","Syngas","Biochar","Hydrocarbon","Petroleum","Lighter","Gasoline","Dry_distillation","Destructive_distillation","Cracking_(chemistry)","Cooking","Baking","Frying","Grilling","Caramelizing","Chemical_analysis","Pyrolysis_gas_chromatography_mass_spectrometry","Carbon-14_dating","Phosphorus","Sulfuric_acid","Catagenesis_(geology)","Kerogen","Fossil_fuels","Pyrography","Combustion","Hydrolysis","Oxygen","Superheated_water","Hydrous_pyrolysis","Steam_cracking","Combustion","Plastic","Smouldering","Char","Charcoal","Fire_safety","Firefighting","Carbohydrate","Sugar","Starch","Fiber_(food)","Protein","Maillard_reaction","Lipids","Acrolein","Ignition_temperature","Flamb√©","Ethyl_alcohol","Boiling","Pressure_cooker","Hydrolysis","Boiling_point","Lipids","Vegetable_oil","Suet","Basting_(cooking)","Fat","Barley_tea","Coffee","Peanut","Almond","Nutrition","Spoilage","Caramel","Confectionery","Caramel_coloring","Food_coloring","Soft_drink","Sawdust","Wood_ash","Pollution","Xylem","Nutshell","Peach","Endocarp","Activated_carbon","Adsorption","Terra_preta","Indigenous_peoples_of_Brazil","Amazon_basin","Biochar","Soil_structure","Ecology","Micronutrient","Selenium","Manure","Sewage","Disinfect","Water_table","Carbon_dioxide_sink","Mitigation_of_global_warming","Coal","Coke_(fuel)","Metallurgy","Steelmaking","Carbon_fiber","Polymer","Rayon","Polyacrylonitrile","Electric_lamp","Joseph_Wilson_Swan","Thomas_Edison","Cotton","Bamboo","Pyrolytic_carbon","Artificial_heart_valve","Biomass","National_Non-Food_Crops_Centre","Switchgrass","Miscanthus_giganteus","Lignocellulosic_biomass","Diesel_fuel","Pyrolysis_oil","Flash_pyrolysis","Crude_oil","Hydrous_pyrolysis","Manure-derived_synthetic_crude_oil","Thermal_depolymerization","Diesel_fuel","Endothermic","Heat_transfer","Auger","Lurgi_process","Gasification","Ablation","Cyclonic_separation","Fluidization","Dynamotive","Vacuum","Boiling_point","Organic_chemistry","2-Furonitrile","Organic_matter","Thermal_treatment","Refuse","Mechanical_biological_treatment","Anaerobic_digestion","Chartered_Institute_of_Wastes_Management","Syngas","Biochar","Fires","Fire_protection_engineering","Passive_fire_protection","Carbon","Lignocellulosic_biomass","Cracking_(chemistry)","Destructive_distillation","Dextrin","Dry_distillation","Gasification","Karrick_process","Pyrolytic_coating","Torrefaction","Wood_gas","Thermolysis"]}
