{"cursor":"66201","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n'Psychotherapy' is a general term referring to therapeutic interaction or\ntreatment contracted between a trained professional and a client, patient,\nfamily, couple, or group. The problems addressed are psychological in nature and\nof no specific kind or degree, but rather depend on the specialty of the\npractitioner.\n\nPsychotherapy aims to increase the individual's sense of his/her own well-being.\nPsychotherapists employ a range of techniques based on experiential relationship\nbuilding, dialogue, communication and behavior change that are designed to\nimprove the mental health of a client or patient, or to improve group\nrelationships (such as in a family).\n\nPsychotherapy may also be performed by practitioners with a number of different\nqualifications, including psychiatry, clinical psychology, counseling\npsychology, clinical or psychiatric social work, mental health counseling,\nmarriage and family therapy, rehabilitation counseling, school counseling, play\ntherapy, music therapy, art therapy, drama therapy, dance/movement therapy,\noccupational therapy, psychiatric nursing, psychoanalysis and those from other\npsychotherapies. It may be legally regulated, voluntarily regulated or\nunregulated, depending on the jurisdiction. Requirements of these professions\nvary, but often require graduate school and supervised clinical experience.\nPsychotherapy in Europe is increasingly being seen as an independent profession,\nrather than being restricted to being practiced only by psychologists and\npsychiatrists as is stipulated in some countries.\n","linknr":1093,"url":"Psychotherapy","recorded":1362582371,"links":119,"instances":["psychology","psychology","therapy","psychology","activity","psychology","psychologist","psychiatrist","sociology","psychology"],"pdf":["http://www.lenus.ie/hse/bitstream/10147/121474/1/DropoutRelatedfactorsPSI.pdf","http://www.psico.unifi.it/upload/sub/Tirocinio/L56-1989.pdf","http://www.psico.unifi.it/upload/sub/Tirocinio/L56-1989.pdf","http://webspace.qmul.ac.uk/spriebe//publications/2006/2006_The_provision_of_psychotherapy-an_international_comparison.pdf","http://webspace.qmul.ac.uk/spriebe//publications/2006/2006_The_provision_of_psychotherapy-an_international_comparison.pdf","http://www.kcl.ac.uk/sspp/departments/management/news/StatutoryRegulation1.pdf","http://www.kcl.ac.uk/sspp/departments/management/news/StatutoryRegulation1.pdf","http://pavilionjournals.metapress.com/index/P83X3Q14J6J5187J.pdf","http://pavilionjournals.metapress.com/index/P83X3Q14J6J5187J.pdf"],"categories":["Articles
