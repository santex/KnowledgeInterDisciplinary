These orbitals share a nodal plane which passes through both of the\ninvolved nuclei.\n\n\nThe Greek letter 'Ï' in their name refers to p orbitals, since the orbital\nsymmetry of the pi bond is the same as that of the p orbital when seen down\nthe bond axis. P orbitals usually engage in this sort of bonding. D orbitals\nalso engage in pi bonding, and form part of the basis for metal-metal\nmultiple bonding.\n\nPi bonds are usually weaker than sigma bonds. From the perspective of\nquantum mechanics, this bond's weakness is explained by significantly less\noverlap between the component p-orbitals due to their parallel orientation.\nThis is contrasted by sigma bonds which form bonding orbitals directly\nbetween the nucleus of the bonding atoms. Resulting in greater overlap and a\nstrong sigma bond.\n\nPi bonds result from overlap of atomic orbitals that are in contact through two\nareas of overlap. Pi-bonds are more diffuse bonds than the sigma bonds.\nElectrons in pi bonds are sometimes referred to as 'pi electrons'. Molecular\nfragments joined by a pi bond cannot rotate about that bond without breaking the\npi bond, because rotation involves destroying the parallel orientation of the\nconstituent p orbitals.\n\nFor homonuclear diatomic molecules, bonding Ï molecular orbitals have no nodal\nplanes that pass between the bonded atoms. The corresponding ''anti''bonding, or\nÏ* (\"pi-star\") molecular orbital, is defined by the presence of an additional\nnodal plane between these two bonded atoms.\n","linknr":211,"url":"Pi_bond","recorded":1362665093,"links":42,"instances":["physics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Chemical bonding"],"headings":["Multiple bonds","Special cases","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/11/Electron_orbitals.svg/350px-Electron_orbitals.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/Pi-Bond.svg/220px-Pi-Bond.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/68/Ethane-staggered-CRC-MW-dimensions-2D.png/170px-Ethane-staggered-CRC-MW-dimensions-2D.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3b/Ethylene-CRC-MW-dimensions-2D.png/160px-Ethylene-CRC-MW-dimensions-2D.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Acetylene-CRC-IR-dimensions-2D.png/150px-Acetylene-CRC-IR-dimensions-2D.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["node","physics"]],"members":["node"],"related":["Chemistry","Covalent_bond","Chemical_bond","Atomic_orbital","Node_(physics)","Atomic_nucleus","P_orbital","Quintuple_bond","Sigma_bond","Quantum_mechanics","Sigma_bond","Sigma_bond","Homonuclear_molecule","Diatomic_molecule","Molecular_orbital","Antibond","Double_bond","Ethylene","Triple_bond","Acetylene","Quadruple_bond","Transition_metal","Delta_bond","Bond_length","Picometer","Ethane","Ethane","Ethylene","Acetylene","Metal_complex","Alkyne","Alkene","Dicarbon","Orbital_overlap","Chemical_Communications","Aromatic_interaction","Delta_bond","Molecular_geometry","Pi_interaction"]}
