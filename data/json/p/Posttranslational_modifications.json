{"cursor":"14063","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Posttranslational modification' (PTM) is a step in protein biosynthesis.\nProteins are created by ribosomes translating mRNA into polypeptide chains.\nThese polypeptide chains undergo PTM, (such as folding, cutting and other\nprocesses), before becoming the mature protein product.\n\n\n\nA protein (also called a polypeptide) is a chain of amino acids. During\nprotein synthesis, 20 different amino acids can be incorporated to become a\nprotein. After translation, the posttranslational modification of amino\nacids extends the range of functions of the protein by attaching it to\nother biochemical functional groups (such as acetate, phosphate, various\nlipids and carbohydrates), changing the chemical nature of an amino acid\n(e.g. citrullination), or making structural changes (e.g. formation of\ndisulfide bridges).\n\nAlso, enzymes may remove amino acids from the amino end of the protein, or cut\nthe peptide chain in the middle. For instance, the peptide hormone insulin is\ncut twice after disulfide bonds are formed, and a propeptide is removed from the\nmiddle of the chain; the resulting protein consists of two polypeptide chains\nconnected by disulfide bonds. Also, most nascent polypeptides start with the\namino acid methionine because the \"start\" codon on mRNA also codes for this\namino acid. This amino acid is usually taken off during post-translational\nmodification.\n\nOther modifications, like phosphorylation, are part of common mechanisms for\ncontrolling the behavior of a protein, for instance activating or inactivating\nan enzyme.\n\nPost-translational modification of proteins is detected by mass spectrometry or\nEastern blotting.\n","linknr":763,"url":"Posttranslational_modifications","recorded":1362486556,"links":37,"instances":["biology","genetics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Gene expression","Protein structure","Protein biosynthesis","Posttranslational modification|","Cell biology"],"headings":["PTMs involving addition of functional groups","PTMs involving addition of other proteins or peptides","PTMs involving changing the chemical nature of amino acids","PTMs involving structural changes","Post-translational modification statistics","Case examples","External links","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/25/Insulinpath.png/250px-Insulinpath.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/53/GeneticCode22.svg/300px-GeneticCode22.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["translation","biology"],["transcription","genetics"]],"members":["translation","transcription"],"related":["Protein_biosynthesis","Ribosomes","Translation_(biology)","MRNA","Polypeptide","Amino_acid","Functional_group","Acetate","Phosphate","Lipid","Carbohydrate","Citrullination","Disulfide_bridge","Enzyme","N-terminal_end","Hormone","Insulin","Propeptide","Methionine","Codon","MRNA","Phosphorylation","Mass_spectrometry","Eastern_blotting","Myristoylation","Myristate","Palmitoylation","Palmitate","Isoprenylation","Prenylation","Isoprenoid","Farnesol","Geranylgeraniol","Farnesylation","Geranylgeranylation","Glypiation","GPI_anchor","Lipoylation","Lipoate","Flavin_group","Flavin_mononucleotide","FAD","Heme_C","Thioether","Cystein","Phosphopantetheinylation","Coenzyme_A","Retinylidene","Schiff_base","Diphthamide","EEF2","Ethanolamine_phosphoglycerol","Eukaryotic_translation_elongation_factor_1_alpha_1","Hypusine","EIF5A","AIF5A","Acylation","Esters","Amides","Thioesters","Acetylation","Acetyl","N-terminus","Lysine","Deacetylation","Formylation","Alkylation","Alkyl","Methyl","Ethyl_group","Methylation","Methyl","Lysine","Arginine","Demethylation","Amide","Amidation","Amino_acid","Arginylation","TRNA","Polyglutamylation","Glutamic_acid","Tubulin_polyglutamylase","Polyglycylation","Glycine","Tubulin","Butyrylation","Gamma-carboxylation","Vitamin_K","Glycosylation","Glycosyl","Arginine","Asparagine","Cysteine","Hydroxylysine","Serine","Threonine","Tyrosine","Tryptophan","Glycoprotein","Glycation","Polysialic_acid","NCAM","Malonylation","Protein_hydroxylation","Iodination","Thyroglobulin","ADP-ribosylation","ADP-ribosylation","Oxidation","Phosphate_ester","Phosphoramidate","Phosphorylation","Phosphate","Serine","Threonine","Tyrosine","Histidine","Adenylylation","Adenylyl","Tyrosine","Histidine","Lysine","Propionylation","Pyroglutamate","S-glutathionylation","S-nitrosylation","Succinylation","Succinyl","Lysine","Tyrosine_sulfation","Tyrosine","Selenoylation","Selenium","Selenoproteins","Glycation","Biotinylation","Lysine","Pegylation","Covalent","SUMOylation","Covalent","SUMO_protein","Ubiquitin","Covalent","Neddylation","Pupylation","Covalent","Prokaryotic_ubiquitin-like_protein","Citrullination","Arginine","Citrulline","Deamidation","Glutamine","Glutamic_acid","Asparagine","Aspartic_acid","Eliminylation","Alkene","Elimination_reaction","Phosphothreonine","Phosphoserine","Dehydration_reaction","Threonine","Serine","Decarboxylation","Cysteine","Carbamylation","Lysine","Homocitrulline","Disulfide_bridge","Cysteine","Proteolytic_cleavage","Racemization","Proline","Prolyl_isomerase","Disulfide_bridge","Insulin","Histone","Transcription_(genetics)","RNA_polymerase_control_by_chromatin_structure","RNA_polymerase_II","DcGO"]}
