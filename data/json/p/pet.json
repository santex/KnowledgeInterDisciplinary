The most popular pets are\nnoted for their attractive appearances and their loyal or playful personalities.\nTheir pedigree may also be a factor.\n\nIn some cases pets may also provide their owners with benefits, such as\nproviding companionship to elderly adults who do not have adequate social\ninteraction with other people. While some people believe in the physical and emotional\nbenefits of owning a pet, scientists are currently working to verify these ideas\nwith medical studies. There is now a\nmedically-approved class of \"therapy animals,\" mostly dogs, that are brought to\nvisit confined humans. Pet therapy utilizes trained animals and handlers to\nachieve specific physical, social, cognitive, and emotional goals with\npatients. Walking a dog can provide both the owner and the dog with\nexercise, fresh air, and social interaction.\n\nThe most popular pets are dogs and cats, but there are also rodent pets, such as\ngerbils, hamsters, chinchillas, fancy rats, and guinea pigs; avian pets, such as\ncanaries, parakeets, and parrots; reptile pets, such as turtles, lizards and\nsnakes; and aquatic pets, such as tropical fish and frogs.\n\nThe keeping of animals as pets can raise concerns in regard to animal welfare.\nIn particular, overpopulation is cited as a problem, as is the breeding and\ntreatment of animals. \"[http://www.peta.org/about/why-peta/pets.aspx Animal\nRights Uncompromised: 'Pets']\", People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.\nRetrieved September 21, 2012. In some cases, people can view the keeping\nof animals as akin to slavery.\n","linknr":735,"url":"pet","recorded":1362904279,"links":72,"instances":["animal","pets","insect","fish","animal","accident","fish"],"pdf":["http://www.therapydogs.org/documents/Therapy%20Dogs%20in%20the%20Long.pdf","http://www.therapydogs.org/documents/Therapy%20Dogs%20in%20the%20Long.pdf","https://www.aaaht.com/members/documents/PressRelease-PetSurvey-November15.pdf","https://www.aaaht.com/members/documents/PressRelease-PetSurvey-November15.pdf","http://www.therapydogs.org/documents/Therapy%20Dogs%20in%20the%20Long.pdf","http://www.therapydogs.org/documents/Therapy%20Dogs%20in%20the%20Long.pdf","http://www.hsus.org/web-files/PDF/hsp/soa_ii_chap02.pdf"],"categories":["Pets|","Humanâ€“animal
