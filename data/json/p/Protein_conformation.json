{"cursor":"14288","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n'Protein structure' is the biomolecular structure of a protein molecule. Each\nprotein is a polymer â specifically a polypeptide â that is a sequence formed\nfrom 20 possible L-Î±-amino acids (also referred to as residues). By convention,\na chain under 40 residues is often identified as a peptide, rather than a\nprotein. To be able to perform their biological function, proteins fold into one\nor more specific spatial conformations, driven by a number of non-covalent\ninteractions such as hydrogen bonding, ionic interactions, Van der Waals forces,\nand hydrophobic packing. To understand the functions of proteins at a molecular\nlevel, it is often necessary to determine their three-dimensional structure.\nThis is the topic of the scientific field of structural biology, which employs\ntechniques such as X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, and dual\npolarisation interferometry to determine the structure of proteins.\n\nProtein structures range in size from tens to several thousand residues  Proteins are classified by their physical size as\nnanoparticles (definition: 1â100 nm). Very large aggregates can be formed\nfrom protein subunits: for example, many thousand actin molecules assemble into\na microfilament.\n\nA protein may undergo reversible structural changes in performing its\nbiological function. The alternative structures of the same protein are\nreferred to as different conformations, and transitions between them are called\nconformational changes.\n","linknr":416,"url":"Protein_conformation","recorded":1362371354,"links":42,"instances":["protein_sequence","fastpp","genetics","protein","protein_and_supramolecular","chemistry"],"pdf":["http://scop.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/scop/ref/1995-jmb-scop.pdf","http://scop.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/scop/ref/1995-jmb-scop.pdf"],"categories":["Protein structure|"],"headings":["Levels of protein structure","Domains, motifs, and folds in protein structure","Protein folding","Protein structure determination","Structure classification","Computational prediction of protein structure","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/Protein_structure.png/350px-Protein_structure.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c9/Main_protein_structure_levels_en.svg/250px-Main_protein_structure_levels_en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/75/Alpha_helix.png/100px-Alpha_helix.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/19/Domain_Homology.png/220px-Domain_Homology.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["transcription","genetics"],["chirality","chemistry"],["salt_bridge","protein_and_supramolecular"],["chimera","protein"],["fast_parallel_proteolysis","fastpp"],["threading","protein_sequence"]],"members":["threading","fast_parallel_proteolysis","transcription","chimera","salt_bridge","chirality"],"related":["Biomolecular_structure","Protein","Polymer","Polypeptide","Amino_acid","Peptide","Covalent","Hydrogen_bonding","Ionic_interaction","Van_der_Waals_forces","Hydrophobic","Structural_biology","X-ray_crystallography","Protein_NMR","Dual_polarisation_interferometry","Nanoparticle","Protein_subunit","Actin","Microfilament","Conformational_isomerism","Conformational_change","Primary_structure","Covalent_bond","Peptide_bond","Protein_biosynthesis","Polypeptide_chain","Nucleotide","DNA","Transcription_(genetics)","MRNA","Edman_degradation","Genetic_code","Proline","Chirality_(chemistry)","Isomer","Mnemonic","Secondary_structure","Alpha_helix","Beta_strand","Beta_sheets","Linus_Pauling","Hydrogen_bonds","Ramachandran_plot","Random_coil","Supersecondary_structure","Tertiary_structure","Hydrophobic_interactions","Hydrophobic_residues","Salt_bridge_(protein_and_supramolecular)","Disulfide_bond","Disulfide_bond","Symmetry_group","Hemoglobin","Protein_folding","Gene","Gene_family","Calmodulin","Genetic_engineering","Chimera_(protein)","Secondary_structure","Helix-turn-helix","Helix_bundle","Beta-barrel","Rossman_fold","Structural_Classification_of_Proteins","Eukaryote","Protein_folding","Random_coil","Protein_Data_Bank","X-ray_crystallography","Infer","Protein_NMR","Circular_dichroism","Cryo-electron_microscopy","Proteolysis","Fast_parallel_proteolysis_(FASTpp)","Structural_Classification_of_Proteins","CATH","Protein_sequence","Threading_(protein_sequence)","Homology_modeling","NIH","PDBWiki","Structural_genomics"]}
