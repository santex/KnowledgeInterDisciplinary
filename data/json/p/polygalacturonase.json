{"cursor":"4484","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Polygalacturonase' (PG) is an enzyme produced in plants which is involved in\nthe ripening process, and by some bacteria and fungi which are involved in the\nrotting process. PGs degrades polygalacturonan present in the cell walls of\nplants by hydrolysis of the glycosidic bonds that link galacturonic acid\nresidues. Polygalacturonan is a significant carbohydrate component of the pectin\nnetwork that comprises plant cell walls. Jones, T. M., Anderson, A. J., and\nAlbersheim, P. (1972) Hostpathogen interactions IV, Studies on the polysaccharide-\ndegrading enzymes secreted by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici, Physiol.\nPlant Pathol. 2, 153-166. The activity of the endogenous plant PGs work to\nsoften and sweeten fruit during the ripening process. Similarly, phytopathogens\nuse PGs as a means to weaken the pectin network, so that a host of digestive\nenzymes can be excreted into the plant host to acquire nutrients.\n","linknr":113,"url":"polygalacturonase","recorded":1362513094,"links":11,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["EC 3.2.1"],"headings":["Structure","Inhibition","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Enzyme","Hydrolysis","Glycosidic_bonds","Pectin","X-ray_crystallography","Leucine-rich_repeat"]}
