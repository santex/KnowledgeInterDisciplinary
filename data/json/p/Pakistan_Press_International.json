The name was changed in 1968. It was first\nstarted by Mr. Muzzam Ali, the Chief Editor of Associated Press of Pakistan\n(APP). The agency objective was to provide competition to APP's monopoly. It\nbegan its service by hand, only in Karachi. PPA also built up a network of\ncorrespondents in the smaller cities and towns in Pakistan. This was in contrast\nto APP, which had coverage in a limited number of large cities. For foreign news\nthe agency signed up with the Agence France-Presse (AFP) in 1957, and a year\nlater became the first Asian partner of DPA. PPA also posted a correspondent in\nthe Middle East, an area of special interest to Pakistani newspapers.\n\nIn 1958, the agency installed the teleprinters in the offices of its clients. By\n1960, PPI had subscribers in all the major newspapers centers of Pakistan,\nnamely Karachi, Lahore, Rawalpindi and Dacca.\n","linknr":93,"url":"Pakistan_Press_International","recorded":1362670410,"links":12,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Companies based in Karachi","News agencies based in Pakistan","Pakistani media"],"headings":["External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["News_agency","Associated_Press_of_Pakistan","Karachi","Pakistan","Agence_France-Presse","Middle_East","Lahore","Rawalpindi","Dacca"]}
