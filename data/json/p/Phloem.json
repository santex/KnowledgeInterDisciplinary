In trees, the phloem is the\ninnermost layer of the bark, hence the name, derived from the Greek word\n(phloos) meaning \"bark\". The phloem is concerned mainly with the transport of\nsoluble organic material made during photosynthesis. This is called\ntranslocation.\n","linknr":264,"url":"Phloem","recorded":1362482711,"links":55,"instances":["plant","botany","botany"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Plant anatomy","Plant physiology","Tissues"],"headings":["Structure","Function","Origin","Nutritional use","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/92/Stem-histology-cross-section-tag.svg/250px-Stem-histology-cross-section-tag.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Stem-cross-section2.jpg/220px-Stem-cross-section2.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/10/Phloem_and_Xylem_in_stem.svg/220px-Phloem_and_Xylem_in_stem.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/Detaching_inner_bark_of_pine.jpg/220px-Detaching_inner_bark_of_pine.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cortex","botany"],["epidermis","botany"],["sap","plant"]],"members":["sap","epidermis","cortex"],"related":["Pith","Protoxylem","Xylem","Sclerenchyma","Bast_fibre","Cortex_(botany)","Epidermis_(botany)","Vascular_plant","Biological_tissue","Nutrient","Photosynthate","Sucrose","Tree","Bark","Greek_language","Photosynthesis","Fibres","Parenchyma","Plant_cell","Ribosomes","Mitochondria","Cytoplasm","Apoplast","Symplast","Parenchyma","Fibres","Sclereid","Secondary_cell_wall","Tension","Xylem","Sap_(plant)","Sugar","Tuber","Pressure_flow_hypothesis","Ernst_Münch","Root","Meristem","Leaf","Seed","Fruit","Hydrostatic_pressure","Active_transport","Osmosis","Polymer_trap_mechanism","Robert_Turgeon","Raffinose","Oligosaccharides","Molecule","Amino_acid","Hormone","Messenger_RNA","Sieve_tube_element","Xylem","Carbon_dioxide_sink","Meristem","Vascular_cambium","Apical_meristem","Procambium","Apocynaceae","Convolvulaceae","Cucurbitaceae","Solanaceae","Myrtaceae","Asteraceae","Amaranthaceae","Nyctaginaceae","Salvadoraceae","Pine","Finland","Famine","Finnish_famine_of_1866-1868","Finnish_language","Rye","Buttermilk","Silver_birch","Apical_dominance","Xylem"]}
