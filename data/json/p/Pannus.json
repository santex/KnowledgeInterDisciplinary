Pannus may grow in a tumor-like fashion, as in joints where it may erode\narticular cartilage and bone.\n\nThe term pannus is often used incorrectly to refer to a panniculus (a hanging\nflap of tissue), though pannus can also refer to panniculus adiposus.\n","linknr":99,"url":"Pannus","recorded":1362484962,"links":14,"instances":["medical"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Medical terminology","Pathology"],"headings":["Pannus in rheumatoid arthritis","Pannus in ophthalmology"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["hypoxia","medical"]],"members":["hypoxia"],"related":["Granulation_tissue","Rheumatoid_arthritis","Prosthetic_heart_valve","Panniculus","Panniculus_adiposus","Rheumatoid_arthritis","Joint","Bone","Cartilage","Ophthalmology","Cornea","Blood_vessel","Hypoxia_(medical)","Contact_lenses","Stem_cell","Aniridia","Peritomy"]}
