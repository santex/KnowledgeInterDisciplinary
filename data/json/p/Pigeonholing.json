{"cursor":"1859","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Pigeonholing' is any process that attempts to classify disparate entities into\na small number of categories (usually, mutually exclusive ones).\n\nThe term usually carries connotations of criticism, implying that the\nclassification scheme referred to inadequately reflects the entities being\nsorted, or that it is based on stereotypes.\n\nCommon failings of pigeonholing schemes include:\n\n*Categories are poorly defined (often because they are subjective). *Entities\nmay be suited to more than one category. Example: rhubarb is both 'poisonous'\nand 'edible'. *Entities may not fit into any available category. Example: asking\nsomebody from Washington, DC which state they live in. *Entities may change over\ntime, so they no longer fit the category in which they have been placed.\nExample: certain species of fish may change from male to female during their\nlife. *Attempting to discretize properties that would be better viewed as a\ncontinuum. Example: attempting to sort people into 'introverted' and\n'extroverted'. *Criteria used to categorize entities do not accurately predict\nthe properties ascribed to those categories. Example: relying on astrological\nsign as a guide to someone's personality.\n","linknr":107,"url":"Pigeonholing","recorded":1362891047,"links":16,"instances":["theory"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Social psychology","Stereotypes"],"headings":["See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/TooManyPigeons.jpg/220px-TooManyPigeons.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["continuum","theory"]],"members":["continuum"],"related":["Stereotype","Subjectivity","Rhubarb","Washington,_DC","Fish","Continuum_(theory)","Extraversion_and_introversion","Astrological_sign","Archetype","Labelling","Pigeonhole_principle"]}
