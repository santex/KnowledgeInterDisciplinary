{"cursor":"32923","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The 'narrative mode' (also known as the 'mode of narration') is the set of\nmethods the author of a literary, theatrical, cinematic, or musical story uses\nto convey the plot to the audience. 'Narration', the process of presenting the\nnarrative, occurs because of the narrative mode. It encompasses several\noverlapping areas, most importantly 'narrative point-of-view', which determines\nthrough whose perspective the story is viewed and 'narrative voice', which\ndetermines a set of consistent features regarding the way through which the\nstory is communicated to the audience.\n\nThe narrator may be a fictive person devised by the author as a stand-alone\nentity, or may even be a character. The narrator is considered participant if an\nactual character in the story, and nonparticipant if only an implied character,\nor a sort of omniscient or semi-omniscient being who does not take part in the\nstory but only relates it to the audience.\n\nThe narrative mode encompasses not only who tells the story, but also how the\nstory is described or expressed (for example, by using stream of consciousness\nor unreliable narration).\n","linknr":471,"url":"Point_of_view_(literature)","recorded":1362893308,"links":24,"instances":["band","narrative","arts","philosophy","narrative_mode","literary_technique","sherlock_holmes"],"pdf":["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7d/%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%88%DB%8C.pdf","http://signbook.persiangig.com/document/literature/theory/raavi1.pdf","http://signbook.persiangig.com/document/literature/theory/raavi1.pdf"],"categories":["Fiction","Style (fiction)","Point of view","Narratology","Literary concepts","Descriptive technique"],"headings":["Narrative point of view","Narrative voice","Narrative time","Other narrative modes","Further reading","Notes"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["stream_of_consciousness","narrative_mode"],["character","arts"],["flashback","narrative"],["queen","band"],["john_watson","sherlock_holmes"],["one_flew_over_the_cuckoo%27s_nest","novel#main_characters"],["objectivity","philosophy"],["exposition","literary_technique"]],"members":["queen","flashback","character","objectivity","stream_of_consciousness","exposition","john_watson"],"related":["Author","Narrative","Audience","Narrator","Stream_of_consciousness_(narrative_mode)","Unreliable_narrator","Narrator","Character_(arts)","Protagonist","Omnisicent","Story_within_a_story","Focal_character","Protagonist","Ernest_Hemingway","Maxim_Gorky","William_Faulkner","Jeffrey_Eugenides","Joan_Chase","Kate_Walbert","Isaac_Asimov","Joshua_Ferris","Protagonist","Lemuel_Gulliver","Dr._Watson","Emily_Brontë","Joseph_Conrad","Autobiography","Jim_Carroll","Kurt_Vonnegut","Umberto_Eco","Mark_Haddon","Markus_Zusak","Death","Alice_Sebold","Choose_Your_Own_Adventure","Fighting_Fantasy","Iain_Banks","Jay_McInerney","Homestuck","Andrew_Hussie","Grammatical_person","Second-person","Entity","Protagonist","Omniscient","Harry_Potter_series","A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire","The_Heroes_of_Olympus","Epistolary_novel","Mary_Shelley","Bram_Stoker","C._S._Lewis","Helen_Fielding","Robert_Louis_Stevenson","Charles_Dickens","Vladimir_Nabokov","William_Faulkner","Flashback_(narrative)","Robert_Cormier","Carlos_Fuentes","Protagonist","Cristina_García","Margaret_Atwood","Queen_(band)","Focal_character","John_Watson_(Sherlock_Holmes)","Tell-Tale_Heart","Nelly_Dean","Emily_Brontë","Ken_Kesey","Holden_Caulfield","Agatha_Christie","Michael_Marshall_Smith","John_Shade","Vladimir_Nabokov","Satire","Mary_Shelley","Bram_Stoker","Pierre_Choderlos_de_Laclos","Protagonist","James_Joyce","Nathaniel_Hawthorne","Ernest_Hemingway","Focal_character","Protagonist","Antagonist","Objectivity_(philosophy)","Ernest_Hemingway","Jane_Austen","Leo_Tolstoy","Charles_Dickens","George_Eliot","J._R._R._Tolkien","Lemony_Snicket","Philip_Pullman","Unreliable_narrator","Grammatical_tense","English_Language","Chinese_Language","Italian_Language","Portuguese_Language","Present","Historical_present","Hunger_Games","Suzanne_Collins","Prophecy","Exposition_(literary_technique)","Argumentation","Description","Narration","Rhetorical_modes","Marking_scheme","National_Curriculum_assessment","England","Narrative","Film","Video_game","Virtual_camera_system","Horror_film","Antagonist","First-person_shooter","3D_computer_graphics","Interactive_fiction","Zork"]}
