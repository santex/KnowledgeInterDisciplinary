This is to say that every human\nbeing has a unique contribution of ideas to the society. However, a more\ngenerally accepted interpretation in academia is that a philosopher is one who\nhas attained a Ph.D. in philosophy, teaches philosophy, has published literature\nin a field of philosophy in a peer-reviewed journal, or is widely accepted by\nother philosophers as a philosopher.\n","linknr":176,"url":"Philosopher","recorded":1362483102,"links":37,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Humanities occupations","Philosophers|"],"headings":["Education","Motivation","Differences with scientists","Women in Philosophy","Prizes in Philosophy","Quotations about Philosophers","See also","Notes","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/Plato_Silanion_Musei_Capitolini_MC1377.jpg/220px-Plato_Silanion_Musei_Capitolini_MC1377.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Wikiquote-logo-en.svg/40px-Wikiquote-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/Socrates.png/18px-Socrates.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Wikiquote-logo-en.svg/40px-Wikiquote-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Person","Knowledge","Philosophy","List_of_unsolved_problems_in_philosophy","Aesthetics","Ethics","Epistemology","Logic","Metaphysics","Social","Political_philosophy","Human","Humanism","Concept","Society","Academia","Doctor_of_Philosophy","Peer_review","Undergraduate_education","Postgraduate_education","Natural_science","Truth_claim","Empiricism","Proposition","Thought_experiment","Argument","Judith_Butler","Marilyn_McCord_Adams","Patricia_Churchland","Susan_Haack","Avicenna_Prize","Kyoto_Prize_in_Arts_and_Philosophy","Rolf_Schock_Prizes","A._J._Ayer","Karl_Marx","Bertrand_Russell","Søren_Kierkegaard","Avicenna","Plato","Aristotle","Confucius","Thomas_Aquinas","René_Descartes","David_Hume","Immanuel_Kant","Georg_Wilhelm_Friedrich_Hegel","Søren_Kierkegaard","Friedrich_Nietzsche","Willard_Van_Orman_Quine","Jacques_Derrida","List_of_female_philosophers","List_of_philosophers"]}
