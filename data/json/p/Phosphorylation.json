{"cursor":"21963","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" residue]] 'Phosphorylation' is the addition of a phosphate (PO 43-\n ) group to a protein or other organic molecule. Phosphorylation turns\n many protein enzymes on and off, thereby altering their function and activity.\n Protein phosphorylation is one type of post-translational modification.\n\nProtein phosphorylation in particular plays a significant role in a wide range\nof cellular processes. Its prominent role in biochemistry is the subject of a\nvery large body of research (as of March 2012, the Medline database returns\nnearly 200,000 articles on the subject, largely on protein phosphorylation).\n","linknr":484,"url":"Phosphorylation","recorded":1362508161,"links":52,"instances":["biochemistry","protein","gene"],"pdf":["http://www.jbc.org/cgi/reprint/2/1/127.pdf","http://www.jbc.org/cgi/reprint/2/1/127.pdf","http://www.jbc.org/cgi/reprint/98/1/109.pdf","http://www.jbc.org/cgi/reprint/98/1/109.pdf","http://www.jbc.org/cgi/reprint/211/2/969.pdf","http://www.jbc.org/cgi/reprint/211/2/969.pdf","http://jcs.biologists.org/cgi/reprint/113/18/3141.pdf","http://jcs.biologists.org/cgi/reprint/113/18/3141.pdf"],"categories":["Cell biology","Cell signaling","Phosphorus","Posttranslational modification"],"headings":["Protein phosphorylation","Other kinds","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/Phosphorylated_serine.png/220px-Phosphorylated_serine.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9d/PTM-phosphorylation-example-jepoirrier.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["receptor","biochemistry"],["receptor","biochemistry"],["p53","protein"],["src","gene"]],"members":["receptor","p53","src"],"related":["Phosphate","Protein","Posttranslational_modification","Biochemistry","Medline","Phoebus_Levene","Vitellin","Casein","Prokaryote","Eukaryote","Protein_kinase","Phosphatase","Enzyme","Receptor_(biochemistry)","Protein_structure","Enzyme","Receptor_(biochemistry)","Serine","Threonine","Tyrosine","Histidine","Serine","Threonine","Tyrosine","Histidine","Arginine","Lysine","P53_(protein)","P53","Signal_transduction","Retina","Biological_thermodynamics","Na+/K+-ATPase","Osmoregulation","Enzyme_Inhibitor","GSK-3","AKT","Src_(gene)","Protein-protein_interaction","Protein_domain","NADPH_oxidase","Phagocyte","Ubiquitin","Proteasome","Ubiquitin","Cellular_signaling","Cellular_signaling","Phosphoproteomics","Proteomics","Mass_spectrometry","Proteomics","Epidermal_growth_factor","Lymphocyte","AKT","AKT","Amino_acid","Serine","Threonine","Tyrosine","Antibodies","Histidine","Aspartate","Prokaryotes","Two-component_regulatory_system","Eukaryotes","Antibodies","Antibodies","Two-dimensional_gel_electrophoresis","Microscale_Thermophoresis","FÃ¶rster_resonance_energy_transfer","Adenosine_triphosphate","Mitochondrion","Adenosine_diphosphate","Oxidative_phosphorylation","Substrate-level_phosphorylation","Glycolysis","Photophosphorylation","Chloroplast","Sugar","Catabolism","Moiety_conservation","Phosida"]}
