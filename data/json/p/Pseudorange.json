Knowing the satellites' orbital parameters, these positions can be\ncalculated for any point in time. The pseudoranges of each satellite are\nobtained by multiplying the speed of light by the time the signal has taken from\nthe satellite to the receiver. As there are accuracy errors in the time\nmeasured, the term pseudo-ranges is used rather than ranges for such distances.\n","linknr":101,"url":"Pseudorange","recorded":1362674572,"links":19,"instances":["gps"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Navigation","Geodesy"],"headings":["Pseudorange and time error estimation","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/a/7/5a72f1304af0783657605aed0e38201a.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/5/0/450b1a4f20c1a48f6a962e82dd4b7578.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["dilution_of_precision","gps"]],"members":["dilution_of_precision"],"related":["Satellite","Global_Positioning_System","Orbital_parameters","Speed_of_light","Quartz","Quartz_clock","Trilateration","Error_propagation","Least_squares","Geodesy","Dilution_of_precision_(GPS)"]}
