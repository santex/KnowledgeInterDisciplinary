Phenyl groups are closely\nrelated to benzene. Phenyl groups have six carbon atoms bonded together in a\nhexagonal planar ring, five of which are bonded to individual hydrogen atoms,\nwith the remaining carbon bonded to a substituent. Phenyl groups are pervasive\nin organic chemistry. March, J. âAdvanced Organic Chemistryâ 4th\nEd. J. Wiley and Sons, 1992: New York. ISBN 0-471-60180-2. Although often\ndepicted with alternating double and single bonds, phenyl groups are chemically\naromatic and show nearly equal bond lengths between carbon atoms in the\nring. \"Virtual Textbook of Organic Chemistry:\nAromaticity\".
