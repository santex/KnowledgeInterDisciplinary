''Top''': The gene is\nessentially turned off. There is no lactose to inhibit the repressor, so the\nrepressor binds to the operator, which obstructs the RNA polymerase from binding\nto the promoter and making lactase. 'Bottom': The gene is turned on. Lactose is\ninhibiting the repressor, allowing the RNA polymerase to bind with the promoter,\nand express the genes, which synthesize lactase. Eventually, the lactase will\ndigest all of the lactose, until there is none to bind to the repressor. The\nrepressor will then bind to the operator, stopping the manufacture of lactase.]]\n\nIn genetics, a 'promoter' is a region of DNA that initiates transcription of a\nparticular gene. Promoters are located near the genes they transcribe, on the\nsame strand and upstream on the DNA (towards the 3' region of the anti-sense\nstrand, also called template strand and non-coding strand). Promoters can be\nabout 100â1000 base pairs long.\n","linknr":544,"url":"Promoter_(genetics)","recorded":1362666933,"links":55,"instances":["dna","genetics","genetics","journal","genetics","genetics","genetics","dna"],"pdf":["http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~roded/courses/bnet-a06/lec11.pdf","http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~roded/courses/bnet-a06/lec11.pdf","http://www.biomedcentral.com/content/pdf/1471-2164-13-512.pdf","http://www.biomedcentral.com/content/pdf/1471-2164-13-512.pdf"],"categories":["Gene expression"],"headings":["Overview","Identification of relative location","Promoter elements","Subgenomic promoters","Detection of promoters","Evolutionary change","Binding","Diseases associated with aberrant promoter function","Canonical sequences and wild-type","Diseases that may be associated with promoter variations","Constitutive vs regulated promoters","Use of the word promoter","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/22/Lac_Operon.svg/250px-Lac_Operon.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2e/Ten_classes_of_eukaryotic_promoters_and_their_representative_K-DNA_patterns.jpg/220px-Ten_classes_of_eukaryotic_promoters_and_their_representative_K-DNA_patterns.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["transcription","genetics"],["upstream_and_downstream","dna"],["activator","genetics"],["enhancer","genetics"],["silencer","dna"],["insulator","genetics"],["coactivator","genetics"],["activator","genetics"],["nature","journal"]],"members":["upstream_and_downstream","coactivator","transcription","nature","enhancer","insulator","activator","silencer"],"related":["Genetics","DNA","Transcription_(genetics)","Gene","Upstream_and_downstream_(DNA)","3'","Anti-sense_strand","Template_strand","Non-coding_strand","Base_pairs","RNA_polymerase","Response_elements","Transcription_factors","Activator_(genetics)","Repressor","Bacteria","RNA_polymerase","Sigma_factor","DNA_binding_site","Eukaryotes","RNA_polymerase_II","Enhancer_(genetics)","Silencer_(DNA)","Insulator_(genetics)","Transcription_start_site","Transcription_start_site","RNA_polymerase","RNA_polymerase_I","Ribosomal_RNA","RNA_polymerase_II","Messenger_RNA","RNA_polymerase_III","TRNA","TATA_box","Transcription_factor_binding_site","Distal_promoter","Bacteria","Transcription_start_site","Consensus_sequence","Consensus_sequence","Consensus_sequence","Sigma-70","Eukaryotic","Tata_box","Consensus_sequence","General_transcription_factor","TATA-binding_protein","B_recognition_element","General_transcription_factor","TFIIB","Transcription_factors","E-box","Basic_helix-loop-helix","BMAL1-Clock","CMyc","DNA","Genes","Mammal","Genome","Gene_Ontology","Microarray","Methylation","RNA_polymerase","Chromatin","Nucleosomes","Transcription_factors","Chaperone_proteins","Mitochondrial_gene","Housekeeping_gene","Cancer","Somatic","Oncogenes","TATA_box","CCAAT_box","Sequence_motif","GABPA","YY1","MRNA","Luciferase","Non-coding_RNAs","RNA_Polymerase_II","Gene_prediction","Evolutionary_biology","Allan_Wilson","RNAP","OMIM","Diseases","List_of_diseases","Mutation","Transcription_factor","Coactivator_(genetics)","Pharmacogenomics","Cancer","Chimeric_gene","Chromosomal_translocation","Canonical_sequence","Proto-oncogene","C-myc","G-quadruplex","Transcription_factors","Asthma","Beta_thalassemia","Rubinstein-Taybi_syndrome","Regulation_of_gene_expression","Isopropyl_%CE%B2-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside","Regulation_of_gene_expression","Transcription_factor","Activator_(genetics)","Repressor","Operon","Glossary_of_gene_expression_terms","Gene_expression","Nature_(journal)"]}
