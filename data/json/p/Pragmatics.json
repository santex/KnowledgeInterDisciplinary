Pragmatics encompasses speech act theory,\nconversational implicature, talk in interaction and other approaches to language\nbehavior in philosophy, sociology, linguistics and anthropology. Mey, Jacob L. (1993) Pragmatics: An Introduction. Oxford: Blackwell\n(2nd ed. 2001). Unlike semantics, which examines meaning that is\nconventional or \"coded\" in a given language, pragmatics studies how the\ntransmission of meaning depends not only on structural and linguistic knowledge\n(e.g., grammar, lexicon, etc.) of the speaker and listener, but also on the\ncontext of the utterance, any pre-existing knowledge about those involved, the\ninferred intent of the speaker, and other factors. {{cite web\n  | last = Shaozhong first = Liu title = What is pragmatics? url =\n  | http://www.gxnu.edu.cn/Personal/szliu/definition.html accessdate = 18\n  | March 2009}}\n In this respect, pragmatics explains how language users are able to\novercome apparent ambiguity, since meaning relies on the manner, place, time\netc. of an utterance.\n\nThe ability to understand another speaker's intended meaning is called pragmatic\ncompetence.
