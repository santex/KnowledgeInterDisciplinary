{"cursor":"6230","size":14,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":", also called nonpoint source pollution, from a farm field in Iowa, United\nStates during a rain storm. Topsoil as well as farm fertilizers and other\npotential pollutants run off unprotected farm fields when heavy rains occur.]]\n\nA 'pollutant' is a substance or energy introduced into the environment that has\nundesired effects, or adversely affects the usefulness of a resource. A\npollutant may cause long- or short-term damage by changing the growth rate of\nplant or animal species, or by interfering with human amenities, comfort,\nhealth, or property values. Some pollutants are biodegradable and therefore will\nnot persist in the environment in the long term. However the degradation\nproducts of some pollutants are themselves polluting such as the products DDE\nand DDD produced from degradation of DDT.\n","linknr":181,"url":"Pollutant","recorded":1362510327,"links":25,"instances":["biophysical","united_states","chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Pollutants|","Toxicology"],"headings":["Different types of pollutants by absorptive capacity","Zones of influence","Regulation","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/95/Runoff_of_soil_%26_fertilizer.jpg/220px-Runoff_of_soil_%26_fertilizer.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/Office-book.svg/30px-Office-book.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["environment","biophysical"],["heavy_metal","chemistry"],["clean_air_act","united_states"]],"members":["environment","clean_air_act","heavy_metal"],"related":["Nonpoint_source_pollution","Biodegradable","Environment_(biophysical)","DDT","Absorptive_capacity","Stock_pollutants","Persistent_synthetic_chemicals","Biodegradable","Heavy_metals","Fund_pollutants","Heavy_metal_(chemistry)","Persistent_organic_pollutant","Environmental_Persistent_Pharmaceutical_Pollutant","Polycyclic_aromatic_hydrocarbon","Volatile_organic_compound","Environmental_xenobiotic","Local_pollutants","Regional_pollutants","Surface_pollutants","Global_pollutants","Atmosphere","Stockholm_Convention_on_Persistent_Organic_Pollutants","Pollutant_Release_and_Transfer_Register","European_Pollutant_Emission_Register","European_Union","Clean_Air_Act_(United_States)","National_Ambient_Air_Quality_Standards","National_Emissions_Standards_for_Hazardous_Air_Pollutants","Environmental_Protection_Agency","Clean_Water_Act","Sewage_treatment","U.S._states","Resource_Conservation_and_Recovery_Act","Municipal_solid_waste","Hazardous_waste","Underground_storage_tank","Conventional_pollutant","List_of_environmental_issues","Pollutant_Standards_Index"]}
