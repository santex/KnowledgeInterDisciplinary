They typically have a thick, orange or yellow shell, creased from the\n stem to the bottom, containing the seeds and pulp. Pumpkins are widely grown\n for commercial use, and are used both in food and recreation. Pumpkin pie, for\n instance, is a traditional part of Thanksgiving meals in the United States, and\n pumpkins are frequently carved as decorations around Halloween. A pumpkin that\n has a little face carved in it and hollowed out and decorated with candles\n inside is known as a jack o'lantern; these are often used at Halloween, for\n example, to decorate windows.\n\nIn Australian English, the name 'pumpkin' generally refers to the broader\ncategory called winter squash in North America.\n",
