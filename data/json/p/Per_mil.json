It is written with (Windows: ALT+0137), which looks like a percent\nsign (%) with an extra zero at the end. It can be seen as a stylized form of the\nthree zeros in the denominator although it originates from an alteration of the\npercent sign.\n\n with a 20â° grade, which equates to 2%]] The term is so rarely used in English\n that major dictionaries do not agree on the spelling or pronunciation (even\n within one kind of English) and often do not list the other variants or do not\n even have an entry (for example Longman, and\n Macmillan). The term is\n very common in most other languages, for example in expressing blood alcohol\n content, which is usually expressed in percent in English-speaking\n countries.\n\nA per mil is defined as:\n:1â° = 10 â3 = = 0.001 = 0.1% 1% = 10â°\n\nA per mil should not be confused with ppm (commonly pronounced \"parts per\nmillion\").
