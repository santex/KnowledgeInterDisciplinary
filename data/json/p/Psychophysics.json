Psychophysics has been\ndescribed as \"the scientific study of the relation between stimulus and\nsensation\" or, more completely, as \"the analysis\nof perceptual processes by studying the effect on a subject's experience or\nbehaviour of systematically varying the properties of a stimulus along one or\nmore physical dimensions\".\n\n'Psychophysics' also refers to a general class of methods that can be applied to\nstudy a perceptual system. Modern applications tend to rely heavily on ideal\nobserver analysis and signal detection theory.\n\nPsychophysics has important practical applications. For example, in the study of\ndigital signal processing psychophysics has informed the development of models\nand methods of lossy compression. These models explain why humans perceive very\nlittle loss of signal quality when audio and video signals are formatted using\nlossy compression.\n","linknr":558,"url":"Psychophysics","recorded":1362480357,"links":56,"instances":["medicine","sense","physiology"],"pdf":["http://www.saylor.org/content/krantz_sensation/Experiencing_Sensation_and_Perception.pdf"],"categories":["Neuroscience","Cognitive psychology","Branches of psychology","Psychophysics|"],"headings":["History","Thresholds","Experimentation","Notes","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Psi2.svg/40px-Psi2.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Psi2.svg/16px-Psi2.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["stimulus","physiology"],["blinding","medicine"],["hearing","sense"]],"members":["blinding","hearing","stimulus"],"related":["Stimulus_(physiology)","Ideal_observer_analysis","Detection_theory","Digital_signal_processing","Lossy_compression","Gustav_Fechner","Ernst_Heinrich_Weber","Science","Wilhelm_Wundt","Charles_Sanders_Peirce","Joseph_Jastrow","Blinding_(medicine)","Repeated_measures_design","Pragmatism","Human_perception","Joseph_Jastrow","G._Stanley_Hall","Detection_theory","Stanley_Smith_Stevens","Power_law","Likert_scale","Alhazen","Senses","Visual_perception","Hearing_(sense)","Somatosensory_system","Skin","Barostat","Taste","Olfaction","Sense_of_time","Two-alternative_forced_choice","Habituation","Georg_von_Békésy","Psychometric_function","Psychometric_function","Stevens'_power_law","Likert"]}
