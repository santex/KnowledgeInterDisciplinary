Signals from spectrum have been assigned hydrogen\n atom groups (a through j) from the structure shown at upper left.]] 'Proton\n NMR' (also 'Hydrogen-1 NMR', or ' 1H NMR') is the application of\n nuclear magnetic resonance in NMR spectroscopy with respect to hydrogen-1\n nuclei within the molecules of a substance, in order to determine the structure\n of its molecules. R. M. Silverstein, G. C. Bassler and T. C. Morrill,\n Spectrometric Identification of Organic Compounds, 5th Ed., Wiley,\n '1991'. In samples where natural hydrogen (H) is used, practically all of\n the hydrogen consists of the isotope 1 H (hydrogen-1; i.e. having a\n proton for a nucleus). A full 1 H atom is called protium.\n\nSimple NMR spectra are recorded in solution, and solvent protons must not be\nallowed to interfere. Deuterated (deuterium = 2 H, often symbolized as\nD) solvents especially for use in NMR are preferred, e.g. deuterated water,\nD 2O, deuterated acetone, (CD 3) 2CO, deuterated\nmethanol, CD 3OD, deuterated dimethyl sulfoxide,\n(CD 3) 2SO, and deuterated chloroform, CDCl 3.\nHowever, a solvent without hydrogen, such as carbon tetrachloride,\nCCl 4 or carbon disulphide, CS 2, may also be used.\n\nHistorically, deuterated solvents were supplied with a small amount (typically\n0.1%) of tetramethylsilane (TMS) as an internal standard for calibrating the\nchemical shifts of each analyte proton. TMS is a tetrahedral molecule, with all\nprotons being chemically equivalent, giving one single signal, used to define a\nchemical shift = 0 ppm. It is volatile, making sample recovery easy as well.\nModern spectrometers are able to reference spectra based on the residual proton\nin the solvent (e.g. the CHCl 3, 0.01% in 99.99% CDCl 3).\nDeuterated solvents are now commonly supplied without TMS.\n\nDeuterated solvents permit the use of deuterium frequency-field lock (also known\nas deuterium lock or field lock) to offset the effect of the natural drift of\nthe NMR's magnetic field B_0 . In order to provide deuterium lock,\nthe NMR constantly monitors the deuterium signal resonance frequency from the\nsolvent and makes changes to the B_0 to keep the resonance\nfrequency constant. Additionally, the deuterium signal may be used to\naccurately define 0 ppm as the resonant frequency of the lock solvent and the\ndifference between the lock solvent and 0 ppm (TMS) are well known.\n\nProton NMR spectra of most organic compounds are characterized by chemical\nshifts in the range +14 to -4 ppm and by spin-spin coupling between protons.\nThe integration curve for each proton reflects the abundance of the\nindividual protons.\n\nSimple molecules have simple spectra. The spectrum of ethyl chloride\nconsists of a triplet at 1.5 ppm and a quartet at 3.5 ppm in a 3:2 ratio.\nThe spectrum of benzene consists of a single peak at 7.2 ppm due to the\ndiamagnetic ring current.\n\nTogether with Carbon-13 NMR, proton NMR is a powerful tool for molecular\nstructure characterization.\n","linknr":211,"url":"Proton_NMR","recorded":1362544404,"links":18,"instances":["chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Nuclear magnetic resonance","Spectroscopy"],"headings":["Chemical shifts","Spin-spin couplings","Carbon satellites and spinning sidebands","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c4/Menthol_Proton_Spectrum.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf7/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/c/2/c/c2c5bcd61609fef3c206d68b0945ee08.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/c/2/c/c2c5bcd61609fef3c206d68b0945ee08.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/80/1H_NMR_Ethyl_Acetate_Coupling_shown.png/450px-1H_NMR_Ethyl_Acetate_Coupling_shown.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf7/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/90/J-Coupling-simple-multiplets.gif","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e2/J-Coupling-complex-multiplets.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["volatility","chemistry"]],"members":["volatility"],"related":["Enantiomer","Chemical_shift","Hydrogen","Chemical_structure","Nuclear_magnetic_resonance","NMR_spectroscopy","Hydrogen-1","Atomic_nucleus","Molecules","Hydrogen","Isotope","Proton","Hydrogen-1","Solution","Solvent","Deuterium","Heavy_water","Acetone","Methanol","Deuterated_dimethyl_sulfoxide","Deuterated_chloroform","Carbon_tetrachloride","Carbon_disulphide","Tetramethylsilane","Internal_standard","Chemical_shift","Tetrahedral_molecular_geometry","Volatility_(chemistry)","Chemical_shift","Spin-spin_coupling","Integral","Ethyl_chloride","Benzene","Diamagnetic_ring_current","Carbon-13_NMR","Chemical_shift","Parts_per_million","Solvent","Temperature","Magnetic_field","Functional_groups","Orbital_hybridisation","Electronic_effect","Hydroxyl","Carboxylate","Alkoxy","Nitro_compound","Halogen","Hydrogen","Aliphatic","Carbon","Carbonyl_group","Olefin","Aromatic_ring","Amino","Sulfhydryl","Heavy_water","Deuterium","Hydrogen-1","Acidic","Methanol","Chemical_shift","Hydrogen","Acetate","Ethyl_group","Chemical_shift","Spin-spin_coupling","Chemical_bond","Magnetic_field","Hertz","J-coupling","Hertz","Chemical_shift","Pascal's_triangle","Carbon-13","Carbon-13_NMR_satellite","Satellite","Spinning_sidebands","NMR_tube","Mass_spectrometry","Pople_Notation"]}
