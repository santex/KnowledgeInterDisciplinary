Markers use an expanding gas, such as\ncarbon dioxide (CO 2) or compressed air, to propel paintballs through\nthe barrel. The term \"marker\" is derived from its original use as a means for\nforestry personnel and ranchers to mark trees and wandering\ncattle.\n\nThe muzzle velocity of paintball markers is approximately . While greater muzzle\nvelocity is possible, it has been ruled unsafe for use on most commercial\npaintball fields. When paintballs hit an object at high speed they\nhave potential to cause damage; a paintball colliding with human skin may cause\nbruising or further tissue damage. However, the damage depends on the\npaintball's velocity, its impact angle, and which part of the body it hits.\nBecause of the potential for soft tissue damage, players must wear masks to\nprotect the eyes, mouth, and ears when barrel blocking devices are not in place.\n\nMost paintball markers have four main components: the body, hopper, gas system\n(or air tank), and barrel.\n","linknr":316,"url":"Paintball_marker","recorded":1362671385,"links":24,"instances":["firearms","paintball_marker","firearms","paintball","paintball_marker","paintball","electricity","firearm","firearm","paintball_marker"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Paintball markers|*","Pneumatic weapons","Air guns|","Rifles","Recreational weapons"],"headings":["Marker types","Marker body","Loaders","Propellant system","Barrels","Firing and trigger modes","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5a/Ego08.jpg/250px-Ego08.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/39/PaintBallMarker.jpg/250px-PaintBallMarker.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/07/Woman_with_Spyder-like_paintball_marker_participating_in_paintball_match.jpg/220px-Woman_with_Spyder-like_paintball_marker_participating_in_paintball_match.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/87/CO2_Canister.jpg/325px-CO2_Canister.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["bolt","firearm"],["trigger","firearms"],["sear","firearm"],["inline_blowback","paintball"],["angel","paintball"],["bushmaster_2000","paintball_marker"],["shocker","paintball_marker"],["ion","paintball_marker"],["battery","electricity"],["magazine","firearms"]],"members":["magazine","bushmaster_2000","trigger","inline_blowback","shocker","angel","battery","sear","bolt","ion"],"related":["Paintball","Carbon_dioxide","Compressed_air","Cattle","Electropneumatic_paintball_marker","Speedball","Stock_paintball","Woodsball","Bolt_(firearm)","Valve","Aluminium","Milling_machine","Anodizing","High_Pressure_Air","Woodsball","Trigger_(firearms)","Microswitch","Hall_effect_sensor","Sear_(firearm)","Solenoid","Open_bolt","Closed_bolt","Inline_blowback_(paintball)","Poppet_valve","Poppet_valve","Hydraulic_ram","Angel_(paintball)","Planet_Eclipse_Ego","Bob_Long_Intimidator","Bushmaster_2000_(paintball_marker)","Directional_control_valve","O-ring","Dye_Matrix","Shocker_(paintball_marker)","Ion_(paintball_marker)","Battery_(electricity)","Stock_paintball","Light_emitting_diode","Photodetector","Phototransistor","Photodiode","Tippmann","Impeller","Magazine_(firearms)","Woodsball_marksman","Radio_frequency","Carbon_dioxide","Propane","Airsoft","Carbon_dioxide","Powerlet","Nitrogen","Carbon_fiber","Solenoid_valve","Diesel_engine","Propane","Tippmann_C3","Kingman_Group","Caliber","Diameter","Semi-automatic_firearm","Electronics","Pump_action","Pump_action_shotgun","Tippmann","List_of_paintball_markers","Paintball_equipment","Paintball_pistol","Stock_paintball"]}
