The first Proton\nrocket was launched in 1965 and the launch system is still in use as of 2012,\nwhich makes it one of the most successful heavy boosters in the history of\nspaceflight. All Protons are built at the Khrunichev plant in Moscow, and then\ntransported for launch to the Baikonur Cosmodrome, where they are brought to the\nlaunch pad horizontally and then raised into vertical position for\nlaunch.\n\nLike many Soviet boosters, the names of recurring payloads became associated\nwith their launchers. Thus the moniker \"Proton\" originates from a series of\nlarge scientific Proton satellites, which were among the rocket's first\npayloads. It is also known as the 'D-1'/'D-1e' or 'SL-12'/'SL-13'.\n\nLaunch capacity to low Earth orbit is about . Geostationary transfer capacity is\nabout . Commercial launches are marketed by International Launch Services (ILS).\nIn a typical launch of a commercial communications satellite destined for\ngeostationary orbit, a Proton M/Briz-M can place a spacecraft with mass at\nseparation of into an orbit with an apogee of , a perigee of and an inclination\nof 19.7Â°.\n","linknr":595,"url":"Proton_(rocket)","recorded":1362267889,"links":51,"instances":["rocket","iss_module","unit","rocket_family","rocket_family"],"pdf":["http://www.ilslaunch.com/sites/default/files/pdf/ILS%20Proton%20Brochure.pdf"],"categories":["1967 in spaceflight","1971 in spaceflight","1972 in spaceflight","1973 in spaceflight","Space launch vehicles of Russia","Soviet inventions","Russian inventions","Universal Rocket (rocket family)","Space launch vehicles of the Soviet Union"],"headings":["History","Proton 8K82K","Proton-M","Launches","Future developments","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/14/Proton_Zvezda_crop.jpg/270px-Proton_Zvezda_crop.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/On_the_launch_pad.jpg/220px-On_the_launch_pad.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/Launch_Vehicle_%22Verticalization%22%2C_Proton-M.jpg/300px-Launch_Vehicle_%22Verticalization%22%2C_Proton-M.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/RocketSunIcon.svg/28px-RocketSunIcon.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["newton","unit"],["zvezda","iss_module"],["titan","rocket_family"],["soyuz","rocket_family"],["angara","rocket"]],"members":["angara","zvezda","newton","titan","soyuz"],"related":["Khrunichev","Geostationary_transfer_orbit","Baikonur_Cosmodrome","Baikonur_Cosmodrome_Site_200","Baikonur_Cosmodrome_Site_81","Salyut_6","Salyut_7","Mir","International_Space_Station","ViaSat-1","Newton_(unit)","Dinitrogen_tetroxide","UDMH","RD-275","RD-0210","RD-0211","Dinitrogen_tetroxide","UDMH","RD-0212","Dinitrogen_tetroxide","UDMH","RD-58M","LOX","RP-1","Expendable_launch_system","Russia","Rocket","Khrunichev","Baikonur_Cosmodrome","Proton_satellite","Low_Earth_orbit","International_Launch_Services","Geostationary_orbit","ICBM","TNT_equivalent","Nuclear_weapon","Warhead","Launch_vehicle","Vladimir_Chelomei","Sergei_Korolev","N1_rocket","Zond","Saturn_V","Expendable_launch_system","Energia","Titan_IV","Mir","Circumlunar","Apollo_8","Salyut","Mir","Zarya","Zvezda_(ISS_module)","International_Space_Station","Mars","Venus","Halley's_Comet","Satellite","International_Launch_Services","SES_S.A.","Astra_1F","Communications_satellite","GRAU_index","UDMH","Nitrogen_tetroxide","Hypergolic","Titan_(rocket_family)","Titan_III","Titan_IV","Long_March_2_rocket_family","Long_March_4_rocket_family","Tsyklon","Kosmos-3","Kosmos-3M","Ariane_4","Cryogenic_fuel","Block_D","Geostationary_orbit","Geostationary_transfer_orbit","Briz-M","Block_D","Block_DM","Angara_rocket","Cryogenic_fuel","Atlas_V","RP-1","Soyuz_(rocket_family)","Metric_ton","Comparison_of_orbital_launchers_families","Comparison_of_orbital_launch_systems","Delta_IV","Atlas_V","Ariane_5","Long_March_5","Angara_(rocket)","Falcon_9","H-IIA"]}
