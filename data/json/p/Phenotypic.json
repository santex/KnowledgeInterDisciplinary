{"cursor":"11023","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n of individuals within the bivalve mollusk species [[Donax variabilis]] show\n diverse coloration and patterning in their phenotypes]]\n\nA 'phenotype' (from Greek phainein, 'to show' + typos, 'type') is the composite\nof an organism's observable characteristics or traits, such as its morphology,\ndevelopment, biochemical or physiological properties, phenology, behavior, and\nproducts of behavior (such as a bird's nest). Phenotypes result from the\nexpression of an organism's genes as well as the influence of environmental\nfactors and the interactions between the two.\n\nThe genotype of an organism is the inherited instructions it carries within its\ngenetic code. Not all organisms with the same genotype look or act the same way\nbecause appearance and behavior are modified by environmental and developmental\nconditions. Likewise, not all organisms that look alike necessarily have the\nsame genotype.\n\nThis genotype-phenotype distinction was proposed by Wilhelm Johannsen in 1911 to\nmake clear the difference between an organism's heredity and what that heredity\nproduces. The distinction is similar to that proposed by\nAugust Weismann, who distinguished between germ plasm (heredity) and somatic\ncells (the body). The Genotype-Phenotype concept should not be confused with\nFrancis Crick's central dogma of molecular biology, which is a statement about\nthe directionality of molecular sequential information flowing from DNA to\nprotein, and not the reverse.\n","linknr":287,"url":"Phenotypic","recorded":1362373516,"links":61,"instances":["biology","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Classical genetics","Polymorphism"],"headings":["Difficulties in definition","Phenotypic variation","Phenome and phenomics","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/Coquina_variation3.jpg/250px-Coquina_variation3.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Biston.betularia.7200.jpg/250px-Biston.betularia.7200.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/db/Biston.betularia.f.carbonaria.7209.jpg/250px-Biston.betularia.f.carbonaria.7209.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["trait","biology"],["morphology","biology"]],"members":["trait","morphology"],"related":["Bivalve","Mollusca","Organism","Trait_(biology)","Morphology_(biology)","Developmental_biology","Phenology","Behavior","Genotype","Genotype-phenotype_distinction","Wilhelm_Johannsen","Heredity","August_Weismann","Germ_plasm","Somatic_cells","Francis_Crick","Central_dogma_of_molecular_biology","Genotype","Molecules","Western_blot","Human_blood_group_systems","Knockout_mouse","Genetic_diversity","Evolution","Natural_selection","Ecophenotypic_variation","Habitat","Sweden","Cliff","Inflorescence","Dune","Ommatidia","Cloning","Silent_mutations","Guanine","Cytosine","GC_content","DNA-DNA_hybridization","Adenine","Thymine","Richard_Dawkins","Beaver","Gene","Incisor","Endophenotype","Genotype"]}
