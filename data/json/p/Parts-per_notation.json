Since these fractions are quantity-per-quantity\nmeasures, they are pure numbers with no associated units of measurement.\nCommonly used are 'ppm' (parts-per-million, ), 'ppb' (parts-per-billion, ),\n'ppt' (parts-per-trillion, ) and 'ppq' (parts-per-quadrillion, ).\n","linknr":304,"url":"Parts-per_notation","recorded":1362374813,"links":52,"instances":["materials_science","mathematics","number"],"pdf":["http://www.iupac.org/publications/pac/1995/pdf/6708x1377.pdf","http://www.iupac.org/publications/pac/1995/pdf/6708x1377.pdf","http://www.bipm.org/utils/common/pdf/CCU16.pdf"],"categories":["Analytical chemistry","Chemical nomenclature","Dimensionless numbers","Environmental chemistry","Mathematical terminology","Measurement","Metrics","Physical constants","Units of measurement"],"headings":["Overview","Parts-per expressions","Criticism","SI-compliant expressions","Uno","Improper applications of parts-per notation","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Image-Olympic_Pool_Munich_1972%2C_color_adj.jpg/307px-Image-Olympic_Pool_Munich_1972%2C_color_adj.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["fraction","mathematics"],["1000000000","number"],["strain","materials_science"]],"members":["strain","fraction","1000000000"],"related":["Science","Engineering","Dimensionless_quantity","Mole_fraction","Mass_fraction","Fraction_(mathematics)","Units_of_measurement","Chemistry","Mass_fraction","Gram","Physics","Engineering","Micrometre","Metre","Celsius","Standard_deviation","Laser_rangefinder","Accuracy_and_precision","Granularity","Dimensionless_quantity","Quotient","Coefficient","Percent","Coefficient_of_thermal_expansion","Brass","Micrometre","Inch","United_States_customary_units","Fahrenheit","Metering_pump","Gallon","Cubic_metre","Chemical_shift","Nuclear_magnetic_resonance_spectroscopy","Uranium","Percent","Milliliter","Permille","Permyriad","Finance","Basis_point","Liter","44-gallon_drum","Century","Olympic-size_swimming_pool","Empire_State_Building","Age_of_the_Earth","Polychlorinated_dibenzodioxins","United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency","International_Bureau_of_Weights_and_Measures","France","International_System_of_Units","Percentage","International_Organization_for_Standardization","International_Union_of_Pure_and_Applied_Physics","Names_of_large_numbers","Long_and_short_scales","English_language","Names_of_large_numbers","Million","Long_and_short_scales","1000000000_(number)","National_Institute_of_Standards_and_Technology","Mass_fraction","Mole_fraction","CFC-11","Electrochemistry","Chemical_engineering","Strain_(materials_science)","Centi-","Milli-","Micro-","Nano-","Pico-","Temperature_coefficient","Dimensionless_quantity","Quotient","Coefficient","International_Union_of_Pure_and_Applied_Physics","SI_prefix","International_Committee_for_Weights_and_Measures","Standards_organization","Radon","Curie","Litre","Particulate","Stepper_motor","Litre","Litre","Technical_writing","International_Bureau_of_Weights_and_Measures","International_Committee_for_Weights_and_Measures","International_Electrotechnical_Commission","International_Organization_for_Standardization","International_System_of_Units","Long_and_short_scales","Mass_fraction","Mole_fraction","Names_of_large_numbers","National_Institute_of_Standards_and_Technology","Percentage","Permille","Basis_point","SI_prefix"]}
