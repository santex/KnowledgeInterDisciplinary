Some cards have\nrecognized legal status; others merely indicate that the bearer is a practicing\njournalist. The nature of the benefits is determined by the type of issuing\nagency, of which there are three major categories: news organizations, law-\nenforcement agencies, and event organizers (usually for a specific single affair\nlike a corporate press conference). Each type of card grants different\nauthorizations, thus it is often necessary or desirable for reporters to hold\nmultiple press passes simultaneously. {{cite web\n  | last = Gulker first = Christian H. title = untitled work = publisher =\n  | Gulker.com date = url = http://www.gulker.com/photos/2003/press_passes.png\n  | format = doi = accessdate = 2007-05-07}}\n","linknr":308,"url":"Press_pass","recorded":1362670125,"links":32,"instances":["admission","country_subdivision"],"pdf":["http://www.supplysideshow.com/west/6a1presspass.pdf","http://www.supplysideshow.com/west/6a1presspass.pdf","https://www.diahome.org/DIAHome/AboutDIA/Resources/Docs/DIAPressPassFinal.pdf","https://www.diahome.org/DIAHome/AboutDIA/Resources/Docs/DIAPressPassFinal.pdf"],"categories":["Reporting","Business documents"],"headings":["Law-enforcement cards","Event-specific","News agency cards","Fake cards","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/Press_pass.jpg/200px-Press_pass.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/MRpresspass.jpg/220px-MRpresspass.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/10/Wikinews_creds-_Press_Pass_to_2005_WTO.jpg/220px-Wikinews_creds-_Press_Pass_to_2005_WTO.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/Bryan1900press.JPG/220px-Bryan1900press.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/15/Wikinews_press_pass.png/220px-Wikinews_press_pass.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/94/Symbol_support_vote.svg/15px-Symbol_support_vote.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["state","country_subdivision"],["ticket","admission"]],"members":["ticket","state"],"related":["Journalist","Legal","News_organization","Police","Press_conference","City","County","State_(country_subdivision)","Breaking_news","Crime_scene","Hat_band","Interview","Reporter","Columnist","Editing","Editorial","Freelance_writer","Bloggers","Parking","Parking_violation","Residential_zoned_parking","Parking_meter","Fire_hydrant","Crosswalk","Bus_stop","Disabled_parking_permit","Taxi_cab","Tradeshow","Festival","Award_show","Academic_conference","Mass_media","Publishing","Chairman","Sales","Blogging","Trade_show","Press_kit","MSNBC","Interview","Very_Important_Person","School","Stadium","Press_box","Ticket_(admission)","Industry_analyst","Freelance_journalist","National_Writers_Union","Professional_Publishers_Association","Public_Relations_Society_of_America","Restaurant","Theater","Sporting_events","Concert","Political_rally","Computer","Computer_printer","Counterfeit","Signature","Laminate"]}
