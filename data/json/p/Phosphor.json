Somewhat confusingly, this includes both phosphorescent\nmaterials, which show a slow decay in brightness (>1ms), and fluorescent\nmaterials, where the emission decay takes place over tens of nanoseconds.\nPhosphorescent materials are known for their use in radar screens and glow-in-the-\ndark toys, whereas fluorescent materials are common in CRT and plasma video\ndisplay screens, sensors, and white LEDs.\n\nPhosphors are often transition metal compounds or rare earth compounds of\nvarious types. The most common uses of phosphors are in CRT displays and\nfluorescent lights. CRT phosphors were standardized beginning around World War\nII and designated by the letter \"P\" followed by a number.\n\nPhosphorus, the chemical element named for its light-emitting behavior, emits\nlight due to chemiluminescence, not phosphorescence, hence it is not\na phosphor.\n","linknr":508,"url":"Phosphor","recorded":1362555074,"links":30,"instances":["phosphor","chemistry","vision","color","physics"],"pdf":["http://www.iop.org/EJ/article/1468-6996/8/7-8/A08/STAM_8_7-8_A08.pdf","http://www.iop.org/EJ/article/1468-6996/8/7-8/A08/STAM_8_7-8_A08.pdf","http://www.iop.org/EJ/article/1468-6996/8/7-8/A09/STAM_8_7-8_A09.pdf","http://www.iop.org/EJ/article/1468-6996/8/7-8/A09/STAM_8_7-8_A09.pdf","http://www.bunkerofdoom.com/tubes/crt/crt_phosphor_research.pdf","http://www.bunkerofdoom.com/tubes/crt/crt_phosphor_research.pdf"],"categories":["Luminescence","Lighting","Display
