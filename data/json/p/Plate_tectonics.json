{"cursor":"92427","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n, deep in Earth's mantle. It is thought that much of the plate initially went\nunder North America (particularly the western United States and southwest\nCanada) at a very shallow angle, creating much of the mountainous terrain in the\narea (particularly the southern Rocky Mountains).]]\n\n'Plate tectonics' (from the Late Latin tectonicus, from the \"pertaining to\nbuilding\") is a scientific theory that describes the large-scale motions of\nEarth's lithosphere. The model builds on the concepts of continental drift,\ndeveloped during the first decades of the 20th century. It was accepted by the\ngeoscientific community after the concepts of seafloor spreading were developed\nin the late 1950s and early 1960s.\n\nThe lithosphere is broken up into tectonic plates. On Earth, there are seven or\neight major plates (depending on how they are defined) and many minor plates.\nWhere plates meet, their relative motion determines the type of boundary:\nconvergent, divergent, or transform. Earthquakes, volcanic activity, mountain-\nbuilding, and oceanic trench formation occur along these plate boundaries. The\nlateral relative movement of the plates typically varies from zero to\n100Â mm annually.\n\nTectonic plates are composed of oceanic lithosphere and thicker continental\nlithosphere, each topped by its own kind of crust. Along convergent boundaries,\nsubduction carries plates into the mantle; the material lost is roughly balanced\nby the formation of new (oceanic) crust along divergent margins by seafloor\nspreading. In this way, the total surface of the globe remains the same. This\nprediction of plate tectonics is also referred to as the conveyor belt\nprinciple. Earlier theories (that still have some supporters) proposed gradual\nshrinking (contraction) or gradual expansion of the globe.\n\nTectonic plates are able to move because the Earth's lithosphere has a higher\nstrength and lower density than the underlying asthenosphere. Lateral density\nvariations in the mantle result in convection. Plate movement is thought to be\ndriven by a combination of the motion of the seafloor away from the spreading\nridge (due to variations in topography and density of the crust, which result in\ndifferences in gravitational forces) and drag, downward suction, at the\nsubduction zones. Another explanation lies in the different forces generated by\nthe rotation of the globe and the tidal forces of the Sun and the Moon. The\nrelative importance of each of these factors is unclear, and is still subject to\ndebate (see also below).\n","linknr":1343,"url":"Plate_tectonics","recorded":1362484287,"links":138,"instances":["geophysicist","moon","geology","geology","supercontinent","geology","geology","geology","physics"],"pdf":["http://www.geo.arizona.edu/Paleomag/book/chap10.pdf","http://www.geo.arizona.edu/Paleomag/book/chap10.pdf","http://www.mantleplumes.org/WebDocuments/Hess1962.pdf","http://www.mantleplumes.org/WebDocuments/Hess1962.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20080216095932/http://www.gl.rhul.ac.uk/searg/publications/books/biogeography/biogeog_pdfs/Moss_Wilson.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20080216095932/http://www.gl.rhul.ac.uk/searg/publications/books/biogeography/biogeog_pdfs/Moss_Wilson.pdf","http://www.geodynamics.no/guest/Torsvik_SteinbergerGraasteinen12.pdf","http://www.geodynamics.no/guest/Torsvik_SteinbergerGraasteinen12.pdf","http://www.tos.org/oceanography/issues/issue_archive/issue_pdfs/8_1/8.1_korgen.pdf","http://www.tos.org/oceanography/issues/issue_archive/issue_pdfs/8_1/8.1_korgen.pdf","http://www.mantleplumes.org/WebDocuments/Morgan1968.pdf","http://www.mantleplumes.org/WebDocuments/Morgan1968.pdf","http://www.stephan-mueller-spec-publ-ser.net/2/171/2002/smsps-2-171-2002.pdf","http://www.stephan-mueller-spec-publ-ser.net/2/171/2002/smsps-2-171-2002.pdf","http://szseminar.asu.edu/readings/Rev_Geophys_Spence_1987.pdf","http://szseminar.asu.edu/readings/Rev_Geophys_Spence_1987.pdf","http://www.tos.org/oceanography/issues/issue_archive/issue_pdfs/16_3/16.3_spiess.pdf","http://www.tos.org/oceanography/issues/issue_archive/issue_pdfs/16_3/16.3_spiess.pdf","http://www.gps.caltech.edu/~gurnis/Papers/2010_Torsvik_etal_EPSL.pdf","http://www.gps.caltech.edu/~gurnis/Papers/2010_Torsvik_etal_EPSL.pdf","http://epic.awi.de/Publications/Polarforsch2005_1_3.pdf","http://epic.awi.de/Publications/Polarforsch2005_1_3.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20100806140625/http://www.rpi.edu/~mccafr/plates/reading/wilson_1965.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20100806140625/http://www.rpi.edu/~mccafr/plates/reading/wilson_1965.pdf","http://www.geology.cwu.edu/facstaff/huerta/g501/pdf/Wilson1966.pdf","http://www.geology.cwu.edu/facstaff/huerta/g501/pdf/Wilson1966.pdf"],"categories":["Plate
