{"cursor":"10636","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Power system protection' is a branch of electrical power engineering that deals\nwith the protection of electrical power systems from faults through the\nisolation of faulted parts from the rest of the electrical network. The\nobjective of a protection scheme is to keep the power system stable by isolating\nonly the components that are under fault, whilst leaving as much of the network\nas possible still in operation. Thus, protection schemes must apply a very and\npessimistic approach to clearing system faults. For this reason, the technology\nand philosophies utilized in protection schemes can often be old and well-\nestablished because they must be very reliable.\n","linknr":144,"url":"Power_system_protection","recorded":1362543350,"links":27,"instances":["electricity","electricity","electrical","ac_power","power_engineering"],"pdf":["http://www.nyiso.com/public/webdocs/documents/manuals/operations/System_Protection_Manual.pdf","http://www.nyiso.com/public/webdocs/documents/manuals/operations/System_Protection_Manual.pdf","http://www.nerc.com/files/Glossary_12Feb08.pdf","http://www.nerc.com/files/Glossary_12Feb08.pdf","http://www.geindustrial.com/pm/notes/artsci/artsci.pdf","http://www.geindustrial.com/pm/notes/artsci/artsci.pdf"],"categories":["Power engineering"],"headings":["Components","Protective devices","Types of protection","Coordination","Disturbance monitoring equipment","Performance measures","See also","Notes","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c2/Protective_relay.jpg/150px-Protective_relay.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf8/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["fault","power_engineering"],["grid","electricity"],["battery","electricity"],["fuse","electrical"],["fault","power_engineering"],["network_analyzer","ac_power"]],"members":["battery","grid","fuse","network_analyzer","fault"],"related":["Power_engineering","Fault_(power_engineering)","Grid_(electricity)","Protective_relay","Circuit_breaker","Battery_(electricity)","Fuse_(electrical)","Electrical_faults","Protective_relay","Alternator","Transformer","Fault_(power_engineering)","Network_analyzer_(AC_power)","Prospective_short_circuit_current"]}
