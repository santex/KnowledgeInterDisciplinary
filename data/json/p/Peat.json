One of the\nmost common components is [[Sphagnum]] moss, although many other plants can\ncontribute. Soils that contain mostly peat are known as a histosol. Peat forms\nin wetland conditions, where flooding obstructs flows of oxygen from the\natmosphere, reducing rates of decomposition. Keddy, P.A. 2010. Wetland\nEcology: Principles and Conservation (2nd edition). Cambridge University Press,\nCambridge, UK. 497 p. Chapter 1.\n\nMires, particularly bogs, are the most important source of peat, Gorham, E. (1957). The development of peatlands.\nQuarterly Review of Biology, 32, 145â66. but other less common wetland\ntypes also deposit peat, including fens, pocosins, and peat swamp forests. Other\nwords for lands dominated by peat include moors, or muskegs. Landscapes covered\nin peat also have specific kinds of plants, particularly Sphagnum moss,\nEricaceous shrubs, and sedges (see bog for more information on this aspect of\npeat). Since organic matter accumulates over thousands of years, peat deposits\nalso provide records of past vegetation and climates stored in plant remains,\nparticularly pollen. Hence they allow humans to reconstruct past environments\nand changes in human land use. Keddy, P.A. 2010. Wetland Ecology: Principles\nand Conservation (2nd edition). Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK. 497\np. 323-325\n\nPeat is harvested as an important source of fuel in certain parts of the world.\nBy volume, there are about 4 trillion mÂ³ of peat in the world covering a\ntotal of around 2% of global land area (about 3 million kmÂ²), containing\nabout 8 billion terajoules of energy.\n\nPeat is not generally regarded as a renewable source of energy, due to its\nextraction rate in industrialized countries far exceeding its slow regrowth rate\nof 1mm per year, Keddy, P.A. 2010. Wetland Ecology:\nPrinciples and Conservation (2nd edition). Cambridge University Press,\nCambridge, UK. 497 p. Chapter 7. and as it is also reported that peat\nregrowth takes place only in 30-40% of peatlands. http://www.eurosaiwgea.or-\ng/Activitiesandmeetings/OtherEUROSAIWGEAmeetings/Documents/Estonia_energy.pdf It is for these reasons that the UN does not classify peat as 'renewable'\nbut as a fossil fuel. http://www.un-documents.net/ocf-07.htm Today's primary\nsources of energy are mainly non-renewable: natural gas, oil, coal, peat, and\nconventional nuclear power. There are also renewable sources, including wood,\nplants, dung, falling water, geothermal sources, solar, tidal, wind, and wave\nenergy, as well as human and animal muscle-power. Nuclear reactors that produce\ntheir own fuel ('breeders') and eventually fusion reactors are also in this\ncategory. Similarly the IPCC do not classify peat amongst renewable\nbiomass or biofuels, due to the length of time for peat to re-accumulate after\nharvesting, but as a fossil fuel.
