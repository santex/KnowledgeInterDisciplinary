{"cursor":"1126","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In electrochemistry, 'polarization' is an effect that counteracts and lowers the\nefficiency of electrochemical processes. The mechanism is typically depletion of\nreagents causing concentration gradients in boundary layers or the formation of\ncompounds partly passivating the electrode surfaces and having the effect\n(depending on conditions) of decreasing the output voltage of batteries,\nincreasing the voltage required by electrolysis cells or lowering currents. It\nis a type of kinetic deviation from equilibrium conditions. It is usually\ndistinguished from overpotential.\n\nAs an electrochemical phenomenon it is of importance for corrosion, typically\nlowering corrosion rates. Increasing polarization of either the cathode or anode\n- usually by using corrosion inhibitors - helps reducing the corrosion rate.\nTypes Of Polarization:- Activation-reaction at metal-electrolyte\n\nConcentration-diffusion in elctrolyte\n","linknr":93,"url":"Polarization_(electrochemistry)","recorded":1362903828,"links":18,"instances":["chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Electrochemistry"],"headings":[],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/Chem_template.svg/32px-Chem_template.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["passivation","chemistry"]],"members":["passivation"],"related":["Electrochemistry","Reagent","Concentration_gradient","Boundary_layer","Passivation_(chemistry)","Electrode","Voltage","Electrolysis","Electric_current","Electrochemical_kinetics","Overpotential","Corrosion"]}
