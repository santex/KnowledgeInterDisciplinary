The\nnovel won the Locus Award for Best Novel in 2002, {{cite web\n| url = http://www.worldswithoutend.com/books_year_index.asp?year=2002 title =\n| 2002 Award Winners & Nominees work = Worlds Without End accessdate=2009-07-30\n}} was shortlisted for the Nebula Award in 2001, {{cite web\n| url = http://www.worldswithoutend.com/books_year_index.asp?year=2001 title =\n| 2001 Award Winners & Nominees work = Worlds Without End accessdate=2009-07-30\n}} and received nominations for the Hugo, Campbell, and Clarke Awards in\n2002.\n\nPassage follows the efforts of Joanna Lander, a research psychologist, to\nunderstand the phenomenon of near-death experiences (or NDEs) by interviewing\nhospital patients after they are revived following clinical death. Her work with\nDr. Richard Wright, a neurologist who has discovered a way to chemically induce\nan artificial NDE and conduct an \"RIPT\" brain scan during the experience, leads\nher to the discovery of the biological purpose of NDEs. Science fiction scholar\nGary K. Wolfe writes, \"Willis tries something truly astonishing: without\nresorting to supernaturalism on the one hand or clinical reportage on the other,\nwithout forgoing her central metaphor, she seeks to lift the veil on what\nactually happens inside a dying mind.\" Through Lander's\nwork, Dr. Wright is able to develop a medicine that brings patients back from\nclinical death.\n\nThe novel contains enlightening discussions of various disasters, including the\n[[RMS Titanic]], the Hartford circus fire, the Hindenburg disaster, the 1883\neruption of Krakatoa, the Boston Molasses Disaster, and, almost as prominently\nas the Titanic, the sinking of the [[USS Yorktown (CV-5)|USS Yorktown]]. (Willis\nhas written extensively in several novels about events in World War II.)\n","linknr":361,"url":"Passage_(2001_novel)","recorded":1362674704,"links":17,"instances":["literature","website"],"pdf":[],"categories":["2001 novels","Novels by Connie Willis","American science fiction novels","Near-death experiences"],"headings":["Background","Plot summary","Characters","Style","References to pop culture","Reception","Publication history","Notes","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/7e/ConnieWillis_Passage.jpg/200px-ConnieWillis_Passage.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["epigraph","literature"],["salon","website"]],"members":["epigraph","salon"],"related":["Connie_Willis","United_States","English_language","Science_fiction_novel","Bantam_Books","Hardcover","Paperback","Science_fiction","Novel","Connie_Willis","Locus_Award","Nebula_Award","Hugo_Award","John_W._Campbell_Memorial_Award","Arthur_C._Clarke_Award","Near-death_experience","Clinical_death","Neuroimaging","Gary_K._Wolfe","Hartford_circus_fire","Hindenburg_disaster","1883_eruption_of_Krakatoa","Boston_Molasses_Disaster","World_War_II","Near-death_studies","Scientific_evidence","Charlatan","Angel","Electroencephalography","Leading_question","Methodology","Alzheimer's_disease","Ventricular_fibrillation","Coma","White_Star_Line","Last_words","SOS","Absent-mindedness","Sherlock_Holmes","Cafeteria","Police_officer","Denzel_Washington","Morgue","United_States_Navy","Cardiomyopathy","Ventricular_fibrillation","Atrial_fibrillation","Hartford_circus_fire","Alzheimer's_disease","Caregiver","Madcap_comedy","Metaphor","Last_words","Epigraph_(literature)","Johann_Wolfgang_von_Goethe","Charles_Frohman","J._M._Barrie","Emily_Dickinson","Karl_Wallenda","Gary_K._Wolfe","Hospital","Maze","Architecture","John_Edward","Self-help","Salon_(website)","SF_Site","The_A.V._Club","The_Three_Stooges"]}
