He was running his own internet business from his father's home in\nSt Neots, Cambridgeshire, most recent accounts filed at Companies House showed\nhis business had a turnover of Â£49,000.\n\nMacrae had been operating various Internet based businesses since 1998, starting\nwith an offer made on several USENET groups for an automatic e-mail sending\nprogram (Macrae has since denied being the poster of the messages). Among the\nbusinesses he founded were the Internet Service Providers True Hosting, Expert\nHosting and Dot Com Avenue. These businesses promised unrealistic up-times, when\nin fact they were frequently unavailable. When working with customers, Macrae\nused a number of aliases, most notably 'David Jarvis', and would claim to be\npersons from various departments of the companies; in fact, however, Macrae's\nbusinesses were operated solely by Macrae himself.\n\nIt was during his time running True Hosting that he earned the sobriquet\n'Weaselboy' from an irate customer, whom Macrae had continued billing for web\nhosting after she had tried repeatedly to cancel services.\n\nUnder the business name EU Registry Services, Macrae had offered thousands of\ne-mail and website names in the .eu Top Level Domain when he had no right to do\nso. When Nominet warned him about his activities, he threatened to attack their\nservers.[http://www.nominet.org.uk/disputes/courtcases/macrae/] He was accused\nof his activities in 2004, and on November 16, 2005 it was announced in the\npress that Macrae had been sentenced to jail for six years.\n\nIn February 2006 he was found guilty of threatening to kill police officers and\nblow up the Cambridgeshire force's headquarters in a letter to his solicitor\nfrom his prison cell. Judge Nicholas Coleman said: \"I am deeply concerned about\nwhat this man claims he is going to do on his release.\"\n\nHe ordered Francis-Macrae undergo psychiatric reports before sentencing.\n\nIn June 2006 he was given an additional 12 months sentence for making threats\nagainst the police, and made subject to an ASBO.\n\nIn October 2006, Peterborough Crown Court was told that the Crown Prosecution\nService is attempting to seek out and confiscate more than Â£1 million. Francis-\nMacrae disrupted the hearing by screaming âIâm innocentâ, âthis is a sham,â and\nâal-Qaedaâ, repeatedly as loud as he could. [http://www.peterboroughtoday.co.uk-\n/ViewArticle2.aspx?SectionID=845&ArticleID=1823248]\n\nIn February 2008 he was ordered to pay back Â£562,000 or face an additional 3\nyears in jail. Police had traced a Harrods Safe deposit box belonging to him,\nbut all it contained were bricks, a mocking handwritten note with a smiley face\nand ten pounds. [http://www.peterboroughtoday.co.uk/news/Net-fraudster-must-pay-\nback.3809192.jp]\n\nWhile Macrae has been accused of several other illegal or illegitimate\npractices, including spamming and sending false letters under other ISPs' names\nto clients of said companies claiming that services were to be transferred to\nanother company (owned by Macrae), the full extent of his actions are not known\nto the authorities.\n","linknr":111,"url":"Peter_Francis-Macrae","recorded":1364045237,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Peter_Francis-Macrae&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Peter_Francis-Macrae&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/Spammer","/wiki/Fraud","/wiki/Blackmail","/wiki/St_Neots","/wiki/Cambridgeshire","/wiki/Companies_House","/wiki/Revenue","/wiki/%C2%A3","/wiki/USENET","/wiki/Internet_Service_Provider","/wiki/Top_Level_Domain","/wiki/Nominet","http://www.nominet.org.uk/disputes/courtcases/macrae/","/wiki/Mass_media","/wiki/Cambridgeshire_Police","/wiki/ASBO","/wiki/Peterborough","/wiki/Crown_Court","/wiki/Crown_Prosecution_Service","/wiki/Confiscate","/wiki/Pound_sterling","http://www.peterboroughtoday.co.uk/ViewArticle2.aspx?SectionID=845&ArticleID=1823248","/wiki/Harrods","/wiki/Safe_deposit_box","/wiki/Smiley","http://www.peterboroughtoday.co.uk/news/Net-fraudster-must-pay-back.3809192.jp","/wiki/Spam","/w/index.php?title=Peter_Francis-Macrae&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/BBC_News","http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/cambridgeshire/4442772.stm","/wiki/Slashdot","http://it.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/11/17/1647229&tid=111&tid=123","/wiki/ZDNet","http://news.zdnet.co.uk/0,39020330,39237311,00.htm","http://www.peterboroughtoday.co.uk/ViewArticle2.aspx?SectionID=845&ArticleID=1823248","http://www.nominet.org.uk/disputes/courtcases/macrae/","http://www.timesonline.co.uk","http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article1021107.ece","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Peter_Francis-Macrae&oldid=532987627","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:English_fraudsters","/wiki/Category:English_criminals","/wiki/Category:1982_births","/wiki/Category:Living_people","/wiki/Category:British_computer_criminals","/wiki/Category:People_from_St_Neots","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Peter+Francis-Macrae&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Peter+Francis-Macrae","/wiki/Peter_Francis-Macrae","/wiki/Talk:Peter_Francis-Macrae","#","/wiki/Peter_Francis-Macrae","/w/index.php?title=Peter_Francis-Macrae&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Peter_Francis-Macrae&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Peter_Francis-Macrae","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Peter_Francis-Macrae","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Peter_Francis-Macrae&oldid=532987627","/w/index.php?title=Peter_Francis-Macrae&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Peter_Francis-Macrae&id=532987627","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Peter+Francis-Macrae","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Peter+Francis-Macrae&oldid=532987627&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Peter_Francis-Macrae&printable=yes","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Francis-Macrae","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=skins.vector&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","/w/index.php?title=MediaWiki:Gadget-ReferenceTooltips.js&action=raw&ctype=text
