{"cursor":"4395","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Paias Wingti' (born 2 February 1951) is a Papua New Guinean political figure.\nHe served as the third Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea between 1985 and 1988,\nand again from 1992 to 1994.\n\nWingti is a member of the Jika Tribe of the Western Highlands province. While\ndoing his final year in Economics at the University of Papua New Guinea, he\nstood for election in 1977, winning to become a member of the Hagen Open in the\ncountry's National Parliament. In 1985, as leader of the People's Democratic\nMovement (which had broken away from the Pangu Party), he became the youngest\nPrime Minister in the Commonwealth when Michael Somare lost a confidence vote.\nJulius Chan, who would himself become Prime Minister, served as his deputy. He\nwas made a Privy Councillor in 1987.\n\nIn 1987 Wingti returned to power with a slender majority of three votes. He\nannounced a more independent foreign policy, attempting to enhance relations\nwith the Soviet Union, U.S., Japan and China. He lost a motion of confidence in\n1988 with changes in the shifting coalition and was succeeded by Rabbie Namaliu,\nthe new leader of the Pangu Party, but Wingti returned for a further two-year\nstint in 1992. His second term was marked by an escalation of unrest in\nBougainville and he was ousted by Julius Chan in August 1994. Wingti continued\nto represent the Western Highlands in the National Parliament of Papua New\nGuinea, although he switched from the local Hagen constituency to the provincial-\nlevel electorate in 1995.\n\nWingti served as the governor of Western Highlands Province from 1995 to 1997,\nwhen he was defeated for re-election by Father Robert Lak. He returned to\nparliament in 2002, defeating Lak to regain his seat and the governorship. He\nsubsequently won back the leadership of the People's Democratic Movement from\nMekere Morauta, who had taken over after his defeat, in 2007. However, he was\ndefeated in his bid for re-election at the 2007 election, losing to former\nstudent activist Tom Olga, largely as a result of the new preferential voting\nsystem.[http://www.theage.com.au/news/World/Paias-Wingti-loses-seat-in-PNG-\nelections/2007/08/07/1186252667808.html]. Wingti, along with fellow former Prime\nMinister Rabbie Namaliu, were the most high-profile losers of the election.\nAdditionally, Wingti lost the governorship of West Highlands Province to Olga.\nThe PDM also suffered a major defeat in the election, losing several seats. He\nnominated to contest the July 2012 general elections and defeated Tom Olga by\n112640 votes to 89195, a difference of 23445 votes and elected Governor of\nWestern Highlands Province. He was one of the three former Prime Ministers who\nbacked Peter O'Neil to be retained as Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea at\nParliament House on August 3, 2012.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{{Persondata \n| NAME
