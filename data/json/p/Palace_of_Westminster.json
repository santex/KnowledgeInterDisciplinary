Its name, which derives from the neighbouring Westminster Abbey, may\nrefer to either of two structures: the Old Palace, a medieval building complex\nthat was destroyed by fire in 1834, and its replacement New Palace that stands\ntoday. For ceremonial purposes, the palace retains its original style and status\nas a royal residence.\n\nThe first royal palace was built on the site in the eleventh century, and\nWestminster was the primary London residence of the Kings of England until a\nfire destroyed much of the complex in 1512. After that, it served as the home of\nParliament, which had been meeting there since the thirteenth century, and the\nseat of the Royal Courts of Justice, based in and around Westminster Hall. In\n1834, an even greater fire ravaged the heavily rebuilt Houses of Parliament, and\nthe only structures of significance to survive were Westminster Hall, the\nCloisters of St Stephen's, the Chapel of St Mary Undercroft and the Jewel Tower.\n\nThe subsequent competition for the reconstruction of the Palace was won by\narchitect Charles Barry and his design for a building in the Perpendicular\nGothic style. The remains of the Old Palace (with the exception of the\ndetached Jewel Tower) were incorporated in its much larger replacement, which\ncontains over 1,100 rooms organised symmetrically around two series of\ncourtyards. Part of the New Palace's area of was reclaimed from the Thames,\nwhich is the setting of its principal faÃ§ade, the river front. Barry was\nassisted by Augustus W. N. Pugin, a leading authority on Gothic architecture\nand style, who provided designs for the decoration and furnishings of the\nPalace. Construction started in 1840 and lasted for thirty years, suffering\ngreat delays and cost overruns, as well as the death of both leading\narchitects; works for the interior decoration continued intermittently well\ninto the twentieth century. Major conservation work has been carried out\nsince, due to the effects of London's air pollution, and extensive repairs\ntook place after the Second World War, including the reconstruction of the\nCommons Chamber following its bombing in 1941.\n\nThe Palace is one of the centres of political life in the United Kingdom;\n\"Westminster\" has become a metonym for the UK Parliament, and the Westminster\nsystem of government has taken its name after it. The Elizabeth Tower, in\nparticular, which is often referred to by the name of its main bell, \"Big Ben\",\nis an iconic landmark of London and the United Kingdom in general, one of the\nmost popular tourist attractions in the city and an emblem of parliamentary\ndemocracy. The Palace of Westminster has been a Grade I listed building since\n1970 and part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1987.\n","linknr":1993,"url":"Palace_of_Westminster","recorded":1362484583,"links":143,"instances":["united_kingdom","artist","vote","architect","architect","vault","architecture","statue","british_army","architecture","england","monet","england","london","london_underground","uk","london","united_kingdom","uk","sculptor"],"pdf":["http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons-information-office/g03.pdf","http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons-information-office/g03.pdf","http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons-information-office/g13.pdf","http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons-information-office/g13.pdf","http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons-information-office/g11.pdf","http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons-information-office/g11.pdf","http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons-information-office/g12.pdf","http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons-information-office/g12.pdf","http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/briefings/snpc-04474.pdf","http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/briefings/snpc-04474.pdf","http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons-information-office/g19.pdf","http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons-information-office/g19.pdf","http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons-information-office/g08.pdf","http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons-information-office/g08.pdf","http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons-information-office/g07.pdf","http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons-information-office/g07.pdf","http://www.parliament.uk/documents/upload/privilege-police-090914.pdf","http://www.parliament.uk/documents/upload/privilege-police-090914.pdf"],"categories":["Palace
