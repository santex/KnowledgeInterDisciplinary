The structure comprised three fabric layers and incorporated a window\nand a zipper to allow the astronaut to enter and exit the ball. The ball enabled\none crew member to curl up inside and don an oxygen mask and hold a carbon\ndioxide scrubber/oxygen supply device with one hour worth of oxygen. The ball\nwould have been connected by an umbilical to the shuttle to supply air until the\nairlock depressurized. The rescue ball containing the crew member would have\nbeen carried to the rescue shuttle by a space suited astronaut.\n","linknr":79,"url":"Personal_Rescue_Enclosure","recorded":1362897031,"links":12,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Space Shuttle program","Rescue equipment"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/04/Nasarescueball.jpg/200px-Nasarescueball.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Space_Shuttle","Astronaut"]}
