{"cursor":"2965","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Proton emission' (also known as proton radioactivity) is a type of radioactive\ndecay in which a proton is ejected from a nucleus. Proton emission can occur\nfrom high-lying excited states in a nucleus following a beta decay, in which\ncase the process is known as beta-delayed proton emission, or can occur from the\nground state (or a low-lying isomer) of very proton-rich nuclei, in which case\nthe process is very similar to alpha decay. For a proton to escape a nucleus,\nthe proton separation energy must be negative - the proton is therefore unbound,\nand tunnels out of the nucleus in a finite time. Proton emission is not seen in\nnaturally occurring isotopes; proton emitters can be produced via nuclear\nreactions, usually utilising some kind of particle accelerator.\n\nAlthough prompt (i.e. not beta-delayed) proton emission was observed from an\nisomer in cobalt-53 as early as 1969, no other proton-emitting states were found\nuntil 1981, when the proton radioactive ground states of lutetium-151 and thulium-\n147 were observed at experiments at the GSI in West Germany. Research in the\nfield flourished after this breakthrough, and to date more than 25 isotopes have\nbeen found to exhibit proton emission. The study of proton emission has aided\nthe understanding of nuclear deformation, masses and structure, and it is a\nwonderfully pure example of quantum tunneling.\n\nIn 2002, the simultaneous emission of two protons was observed from the nucleus\niron-45 in experiments at GSI and GANIL (Grand AccÃ©lÃ©rateur National d'Ions\nLourds, near Caen). In 2005 it was experimentally determined (at the same\nfacility) that zinc-54 can also undergo double proton decay.\n","linknr":143,"url":"Proton_emission","recorded":1362375504,"links":21,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Nuclear physics","Radioactivity"],"headings":["See also","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1f/Zerfallsschema.png/300px-Zerfallsschema.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Queryensdf.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Proton","Atomic_nucleus","Beta_decay","Nuclear_isomer","Alpha_decay","Quantum_tunneling","Nuclear_reaction","Particle_accelerator","Gesellschaft_für_Schwerionenforschung","Quantum_tunneling","Gesellschaft_für_Schwerionenforschung","GANIL","Caen","Zinc","Proton_drip_line","Diproton","Free_neutron","Neutron_emission"]}
