It\nconsists of a collection of interviews. Derrida talks about his earlier works\nand their relationships. He said that his 1962 essay, [[Edmund Husserl's Origin\nof Geometry: An Introduction]], already contained many elements of his thought,\nthat would be further elaborated later. He added: \"that essay can be read as the\nother side (recto or verso, as you wish) of [[Speech and\nPhenomena]].\"<ref>Positions Eng. 1981, p. 5.</ref>\n\n\nOn the relationship between his three foundational works of 1967, Derrida\nexplained: \" Speech and Phenomena is perhaps the essay which I like most.\nDoubtless I could have bound it as a long note to one or the other of the other\ntwo works. [[Of Grammatology]] refers to it and economizes its development. But\nin a classical philosophical architecture, Speech... would come first: in it is\nposed, at a point which appears juridically decisive for reasons that I cannot\nexplain here, the question of the privilege of the voice and of phonetic writing\nin their relationship to the entire history of the West, such as this history\ncan be represented by the history of metaphysics and metaphysics in its most\nmodern, critical and vigilant form: Husserl's transcendental\nphenomenology.\"<ref>Positions Eng. 1981, pp. 4-5</ref>\n","title":"positions","headings":["Contents","Notes","Editions"]},"micro-relation":["1: Jacques_Derrida","1: Husserl","1: Henri_Ronse","1: Julia_Kristeva","1: Jean-Louis_Houdebine","1: Guy_Scarpetta","1: Lucette_Finas","1: Les_Éditions_de_Minuit","1: Alan_Bass"]}
