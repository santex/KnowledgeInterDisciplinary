Platelets are a\nnatural source of growth factors. They circulate in the blood of mammals and are\ninvolved in hemostasis, leading to the formation of blood clots.\n\nIf the number of platelets is too low, excessive bleeding can occur. However, if\nthe number of platelets is too high, blood clots can form (thrombosis), which\nmay obstruct blood vessels and result in such events as a stroke, myocardial\ninfarction, pulmonary embolism or the blockage of blood vessels to other parts\nof the body, such as the extremities of the arms or legs.  An abnormality\nor disease of the platelets is called a thrombocytopathy, {{cite book |last\n= Maton |first = Anthea |coauthors = Jean Hopkins, Charles William McLaughlin,\nSusan Johnson, Maryanna Quon Warner, David LaHart, Jill D.

(thrombocytopenia), a decrease in function of platelets\n(thrombasthenia), or an increase in the number of platelets (thrombocytosis).\nThere are disorders that reduce the number of platelets, such as heparin-induced\nthrombocytopenia (HIT) or thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) that\ntypically cause thromboses, or clots, instead of bleeding.\n\nPlatelets release a multitude of growth factors including platelet-derived\ngrowth factor (PDGF), a potent chemotactic agent, and TGF beta, which stimulates\nthe deposition of extracellular matrix.  Both of these growth factors have\nbeen shown to play a significant role in the repair and regeneration of\nconnective tissues.  Other healing-associated growth factors produced by\nplatelets include basic fibroblast growth factor, insulin-like growth factor 1,\nplatelet-derived epidermal growth factor, and vascular endothelial growth\nfactor.  Local application of these factors in increased concentrations\nthrough Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) has been used as an adjunct to wound healing\nfor several decades.\n","linknr":864,"url":"Platelet","recorded":1362482979,"links":81,"instances":["biochemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Blood
