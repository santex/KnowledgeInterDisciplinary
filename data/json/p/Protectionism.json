{"cursor":"25204","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n'Protectionism' is the economic policy of restraining trade between states\nthrough methods such as tariffs on imported goods, restrictive quotas, and a\nvariety of other government regulations designed to allow (according to\nproponents) \"fair competition\" between imports and goods and services produced\ndomestically.\n\nThis policy contrasts with free trade, where government barriers to trade are\nkept to a minimum. In recent years, it has become closely aligned with anti-\nglobalization. The term is mostly used in the context of economics, where\n'protectionism' refers to policies or doctrines which protect businesses and\nworkers within a country by restricting or regulating trade with foreign\nnations.\n","linknr":493,"url":"Protectionism","recorded":1362543358,"links":65,"instances":["pricing_policy","economics"],"pdf":["http://www.economics.harvard.edu/faculty/mankiw/files/Smart%20Taxes.pdf","http://www.economics.harvard.edu/faculty/mankiw/files/Smart%20Taxes.pdf","http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/spn/2010/spn1007.pdf","http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/growing.pdf"],"categories":["Economic ideologies","Protectionism|"],"headings":["Protectionist policies","History","Arguments for protectionism","Arguments against protectionism","Current world trends","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Emblem-money.svg/16px-Emblem-money.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/d2/Abandon_Free_Trade.jpg/220px-Abandon_Free_Trade.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8b/SingaporePort1.JPG/150px-SingaporePort1.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/12px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["dumping","pricing_policy"],["american_school","economics"]],"members":["dumping","american_school"],"related":["Economic_policy","Trade","Tariff","Import_quota","Import","Free_trade","Anti-globalization","Economics","Smoot-Hawley_Tariff_Act","Floating_exchange_rate","Food_safety","Dumping_(pricing_policy)","Exchange_rate","Foreign_exchange_market","Trade_balance","Inflation","Patent","Peter_Drahos","Berne_Convention_for_the_Protection_of_Literary_and_Artistic_Works","Immigration","Labor_certification","Jagdish_Bhagwati","Copyright","Free_Trade","Wilkins_Micawber","Great_Depression","Mercantilism","Trade_balance","Import_substitution","Adam_Smith","Free_to_Choose","Paul_Krugman","Comparative_advantage","Ha-Joon_Chang","Friedrich_List","Comparative_advantage","Herman_Daly","Ecological_economics","Paul_Craig_Roberts","Value_Added_Tax","Infant_industries","Economies_of_scale","Laissez-faire","Collective_bargaining","Child_labor","Competition_law","Environmental_protection","Equal_opportunity","Intellectual_property","Minimum_wage","Occupational_safety_and_health","Economist","Comparative_advantage","Deadweight_loss","Stephen_P._Magee","Milton_Friedman","Paul_Krugman","Alan_Greenspan","Federal_Reserve","World_War_I","World_War_II","Frédéric_Bastiat","European_Union","World_War_II","First_World","World_Trade_Organization","Common_Agricultural_Policy","G20","Washington,_D.C.","American_School_(economics)","Buy_American_Act","Henry_C._Carey","Digital_Millennium_Copyright_Act","Economic_patriotism","Free_trade_debate","Alexander_Hamilton","Friedrich_List","Lobbying","Not_Invented_Here","Project_Labor_Agreement","Protected_Geographical_Status","Protection_or_Free_Trade","Rent_seeking","Voluntary_Export_Restraint","Washington_Consensus","WTO","Protectionism_in_the_United_States"]}
