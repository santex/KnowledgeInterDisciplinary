In most cases, the absence of a\n  well-laid plan can have adverse effects: for example, a non-robust project\n  plan can cost the organization time and money.

For instance, there is a close relationship between the short- and long-\nterm categories and the strategic and operational categories.\n\nIt is common for less formal plans to be created as abstract ideas, and remain\nin that form as they are maintained and put to use. More formal plans as used\nfor business and military purposes, while initially created with and as an\nabstract thought, are likely to be written down, drawn up or otherwise stored in\na form that is accessible to multiple people across time and space. This allows\nmore reliable collaboration in the execution of the plan.\n","linknr":193,"url":"Plans","recorded":1362668058,"links":23,"instances":["geometry","goal"],"pdf":["http://www.forecastingprinciples.com/paperpdf/Value%20of%20Formal%20Planning.pdf","http://www.forecastingprinciples.com/paperpdf/Value%20of%20Formal%20Planning.pdf"],"categories":["Management","Operations research","Project management","Thought","Intention","Problem solving","Planning"],"headings":["Plan topics","Examples of plans","Quotations","See also","External links","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["objective","goal"],["plane","geometry"]],"members":["plane","objective"],"related":["Objective_(goal)","Strategy","Modal_logic","Set","Goal","Space","Plane_(geometry)","Topology","Topography","Map","Project","Diplomacy","Career","Economic_development","Military","Combat","Business","Ad-hoc","Planning","Roadmap","Task_list","Government","Legislation","Regulation","Five-Year_Plans_for_the_National_Economy_of_the_Soviet_Union","Soviet_Union","Urban_planning","Transportation_planning","Land_use","Zoning","Top-down_planning","Systems_thinking","Top-down_model","Psychology","Game_theory","Communication","Information_theory","Logic","Science","Individual","Mind","Personal_organizer","Corporation","Project_manager","Engineer","Industrial_designer","Architectural_plan","Business_plan","Fragplan","Health_plan","Marketing_plan","Project_plan","Plan_de_Ayala","Plan_de_Casa_Mata","Treaty_of_Córdoba","Plan_de_Iguala","Plan_de_San_Luis_Potosí","Site_plan","Schlieffen_Plan","Five-Year_Plans_for_the_National_Economy_of_the_Soviet_Union","Soviet_Union","Marshall_Plan","2003_invasion_of_Iraq","Winston_Churchill","Dwight_D._Eisenhower","Helmuth_von_Moltke_the_Elder","George_S._Patton","Automated_planning","Critical_path_method","PDCA","PERT","Planned_unit_development","Roadmap","Strategy","Military_tactics"]}
