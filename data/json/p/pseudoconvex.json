Pseudoconvex sets are important, as\nthey allow for classification of domains of holomorphy.\n\nLet\n\n:<math>G\\subset {\\mathbb{C}}^n</math>\n\nbe a domain, that is, an open connected subset. One says that <math>G</math> is\npseudoconvex (or [[Friedrich Hartogs|Hartogs]] pseudoconvex) if there exists a\ncontinuous plurisubharmonic function <math>\\varphi</math> on <math>G</math> such\nthat the set\n\n:<math>\\{ z \\in G \\mid \\varphi(z) < x \\}</math>\n\nis a relatively compact subset of <math>G</math> for all real numbers\n<math>x.</math> In other words, a domain is pseudoconvex if <math>G</math> has a\ncontinuous plurisubharmonic exhaustion function. Every (geometrically) convex\nset is pseudoconvex.\n\nWhen <math>G</math> has a <math>C^2</math> (twice continuously differentiable)\nboundary, this notion is the same as Levi pseudoconvexity, which is easier to\nwork with. More specifically, with a <math>C^2</math> boundary, it can be shown\nthat <math>G</math> has a defining function; i.e., that there exists <math>\\rho:\n\\mathbb{C}^n \\to \\mathbb{R} </math> which is <math>C^2</math> so that\n<math>G=\\{\\rho <0 \\}</math>, and <math>\\partial G =\\{\\rho =0\\}</math>.
