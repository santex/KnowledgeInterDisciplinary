{"cursor":"1524","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'program' is a list of instructions written in a programming language that is\nused to control the behavior of a machine, often a computer (in this case it is\nknown as a computer program).\n\nNote that 'program' (not 'programme') is the standard spelling for this sense of\nthe word in all versions of English.\n\nExamples of programs include:\n\n*The sequence of cards used by a Jacquard loom to produce a given pattern within\nweaved cloth. Invented in 1801, it used holes in punched cards to represent\nsewing loom arm movements in order to generate decorative patterns\nautomatically.\n\n*A file containing a list of instructions to be executed by a computer.\n\n* Barrels, punched cards and music rolls encoding music to be played by player\n  pianos, fairground organs, barrel organs and music boxes.\n\nThe execution of a program is a series of actions following the instructions it\ncontains. Each instruction produces effects that alter the state of the machine\naccording to its predefined meaning.\n\nWhile some machines are called 'programmable', for example a Programmable\nthermostat or a musical synthesizer, they are in fact just devices which allow\ntheir users to select among a fixed set of a variety of options, rather than\nbeing controlled by programs written in a language (be it textual, visual or\notherwise).\n","linknr":92,"url":"Program_(machine)","recorded":1362667147,"links":15,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Computing terminology"],"headings":[],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d7/Computer.svg/30px-Computer.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Programming_language","Machine","Computer","Computer_program","Punched_card","Jacquard_loom","Cloth","Computer_file","Music_roll","Player_piano","Fairground_organ","Barrel_organ","Musical_box","Programmable_thermostat","Synthesizer"]}
