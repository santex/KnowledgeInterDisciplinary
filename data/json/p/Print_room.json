Most large print rooms have an example of this print]] A 'print\n room' is either a room or industrial building where printing takes place, or a\n room in an art gallery or museum, where a collection of old master and modern\n prints, usually together with drawings, watercolours and photographs, are held\n and viewed. The latter meaning is the subject of this article. A further\n meaning is a room decorated by pasting prints onto the wall in a quasi-collage\n style to form a sort of wallpaper, an 18th century fashion, of which several\n examples survive. One of the largest, though atypically the prints are cut out\n around shapes, that are pasted well spaced apart, is at The Vyne, Basingstoke,\n Hampshire.
