{"cursor":"9860","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" (Viagra), the prototypical PDE5 inhibitor]]\n\nA 'phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor', often shortened to 'PDE5 inhibitor', is\na drug used to block the degradative action of phosphodiesterase type 5 on\ncyclic GMP in the smooth muscle cells lining the blood vessels supplying the\ncorpus cavernosum of the penis. These drugs are used in the treatment of\nerectile dysfunction, and were the first effective oral treatment available for\nthe condition. Because PDE5 is also present in the arterial wall smooth muscle\nwithin the lungs, PDE5 inhibitors have also been explored for the treatment of\npulmonary hypertension, a disease in which blood vessels in the lungs become\noverloaded with fluid, usually as a result of failure of the left ventricle of\nthe heart.\n","linknr":335,"url":"PDE5_inhibitors","recorded":1362511146,"links":16,"instances":["united_states","pharmacology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["PDE5 inhibitors|*"],"headings":["Indications","Contraindications","Adverse reactions","Drug interactions","Examples","Mechanism of action","Notes","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/Sildenafil.png/220px-Sildenafil.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["food_and_drug_administration","united_states"],["protease_inhibitor","pharmacology"]],"members":["food_and_drug_administration","protease_inhibitor"],"related":["Medication","Phosphodiesterase","Cyclic_GMP","Smooth_muscle","Corpus_cavernosum","Penis","Erectile_dysfunction","PDE5","Smooth_muscle","Lung","Pulmonary_hypertension","Sildenafil","Tadalafil","Vardenafil","Angina_pectoris","Neurogenesis","Stroke","Nitrate","Australian_Medicines_Handbook","Adverse_drug_reaction","Headache","Dyspepsia","Food_and_Drug_Administration_(United_States)","Deafness","Cytochrome_P450_oxidase","CYP3A4","Protease_inhibitor_(pharmacology)","Ketoconazole","Itraconazole","Avanafil","Lodenafil","Mirodenafil","Sildenafil","Tadalafil","Vardenafil","Udenafil","Zaprinast","Icariin","Epimedium_grandiflorum","Xanthoparmelia","Nitric_oxide","Corpus_cavernosum","Guanylate_cyclase","Cyclic_guanosine_monophosphate","Smooth_muscle","Phosphodiesterase"]}
