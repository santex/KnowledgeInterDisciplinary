{"cursor":"24026","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":".]] While a page is a\ncomparatively low-ranking servant, a 'Page of Honour' is a ceremonial position\nin the Royal Household of the Sovereign of the United Kingdom. It requires\nattendance on state occasions, but does not now involve the daily duties which\nwere once attached to the office of page. The only physical activity involved is\nusually carrying the long of the Queen's dress.\n\nIt is usually a distinction granted to teenage sons of members of the nobility\nand gentry, and especially of senior members of the Royal Household. Pages of\nHonour feature in British Coronations, the State Opening of Parliament, and\nother ceremonies.\n","linknr":505,"url":"Page_of_Honour","recorded":1362551505,"links":23,"instances":["page_of_honour","servant","courtier","colonel","british_army_officer","clothing","british_army_officer","courtier","page","lieutenant","page","politician","page_of_honour","page_of_honour","former_page_of_honour","british_army_officer","british_army_officer","courtier"],"pdf":["http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/24506/pages/5367/page.pdf"],"categories":["Court
