{"cursor":"10055","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nThe 'pyrethrins' are a pair of natural organic compounds normally derived from\n[[Chrysanthemum cinerariifolium]] that have potent insecticidal activity.\nPyrethrins are neurotoxins that attack the nervous systems of all insects. When\npresent in amounts not fatal to insects, they still appear to have an insect\nrepellent effect. Pyrethrins are gradually replacing organophosphates and\norganochlorides as the pesticide of first choice. They are non-persistent, being\nbiodegradable, and break down on exposure to light or oxygen. The chemical\nstructure of pyrethrins inspired the production of a variety of synthetic\ninsecticides called pyrethroids such as bifenthrin, permethrin, and\ncypermethrin.\n","linknr":402,"url":"Pyrethrin","recorded":1362373076,"links":29,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://npic.orst.edu/factsheets/pyrethrins.pdf","http://www.mcs-america.org/ama.pdf"],"categories":["Pyrethroids","Plant toxin insecticides","Biological pest control","Pest control","Insecticides"],"headings":["History and biosynthesis","Production","As an insecticide","Toxicity","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/03/Pyrethrin.svg/250px-Pyrethrin.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/CCPaseRxn%27.png/320px-CCPaseRxn%27.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Organic_compound","Neurotoxin","Insect","Insect_repellent","Organophosphate","Organochloride","Biodegradable","Pyrethroid","Bifenthrin","Permethrin","Cypermethrin","Perennial_plant","Pyrethrum","Insecticide","Hermann_Staudinger","Lavoslav_Ružička","Pyrethrin_I","Pyrethrin_II","Esters","Cyclopropane","Chrysanthemic_acid","Pyrethroid","Biosynthesis","Terpenoid","Dimethylallyl_pyrophosphate","Chrysanthemyl_diphosphate_synthase","Kenya","Croatia","Dalmatia","Organic_solvent","Supercritical_carbon_dioxide","Insecticide","Piperonyl_butoxide","Insect_repellent","United_States_Department_of_Agriculture","Hydrolyzed","Permethrin","Pyrethroids","Chemical_synthesis","Piperonyl_butoxide","Persian_powder","Pyrethroid","Permethrin","Pyrethrum"]}
