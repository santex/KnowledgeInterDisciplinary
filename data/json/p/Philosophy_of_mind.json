Phrenology was\n among the first attempts to correlate mental functions with specific parts of\n the brain.]]\n\n'Philosophy of mind' is a branch of philosophy that studies the nature of the\nmind, mental events, mental functions, mental properties, consciousness, and\ntheir relationship to the physical body, particularly the brain. The mind-body\nproblem, i.e. the relationship of the mind to the body, is commonly seen as one\nkey issue in philosophy of mind, although there are other issues concerning the\nnature of the mind that do not involve its relation to the physical body, such\nas how consciousness is possible and the nature of particular mental states.

New York: Oxford University Press. 2010 Macpherson, F. & Haddock, A., editors, Disjunctivism: Perception,\nAction, Knowledge, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2008.\n\nDualism and monism are the two major schools of thought that attempt to resolve\nthe mind-body problem. Dualism can be traced back to Plato, {{cite book\n | author = Plato editor = E.A. Duke, W.F. Hicken, W.S.M. Nicoll, D.B. Robinson,\n | J.C.G. Strachan title = Phaedo edition = year = 1995 publisher = Clarendon\n | Press location = id = isbn = 1-4065-4150-8\n }} and the Sankhya and Yoga schools of Hindu philosophy, {{cite web | url=http://www.experiencefestival.com/a/Sankhya/id/23117\n| title=Sankhya:Hindu philosophy: The Sankhya| author=Sri Swami\n| Sivananda}} but it was most precisely formulated by RenÃ© Descartes in\n| the 17th century. Substance Dualists argue that the mind\n| is an independently existing substance, whereas Property Dualists maintain\n| that the mind is a group of independent properties that emerge from and cannot\n| be reduced to the brain, but that it is not a distinct substance. Hart, W.D. (1996) \"Dualism\", in Samuel Guttenplan (org) A Companion\n| to the Philosophy of Mind, Blackwell, Oxford, 265-7.\n\nMonism is the position that mind and body are not ontologically distinct kinds\nof entities. This view was first advocated in Western philosophy by Parmenides\nin the 5th century BC and was later espoused by the 17th century rationalist\nBaruch Spinoza. Spinoza, Baruch (1670) [[Tractatus Theologico-\nPoliticus]] (A Theologico-Political Treatise). Physicalists argue that\nonly the entities postulated by physical theory exist, and that the mind will\neventually be explained in terms of these entities as physical theory continues\nto evolve. Idealists maintain that the mind is all that exists and that the\nexternal world is either mental itself, or an illusion created by the mind.\nNeutral monists such as Ernst Mach and William James argue that events in the\nworld can be thought of as either mental (psychological) or physical depending\non the network of relationships into which they enter, and dual-aspect monists\nsuch as Spinoza adhere to the position that there is some other, neutral\nsubstance, and that both matter and mind are properties of this unknown\nsubstance. The most common monisms in the 20th and 21st centuries have all been\nvariations of physicalism; these positions include behaviorism, the type\nidentity theory, anomalous monism and functionalism. Kim, J., \"Mind-\nBody Problem\", Oxford Companion to Philosophy. Ted Honderich (ed.).\nOxford:Oxford University Press. 1995.\n\nMost modern philosophers of mind adopt either a reductive or non-reductive\nphysicalist position, maintaining in their different ways that the mind is not\nsomething separate from the body. These approaches have been\nparticularly influential in the sciences, especially in the fields of\nsociobiology, computer science, evolutionary psychology and the various\nneurosciences. Pinel, J.

ISBN Other philosophers, however, adopt a non-physicalist position\nthat challenges the notion that the mind is a purely physical
