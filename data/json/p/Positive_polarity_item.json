{"cursor":"8038","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In linguistics, a 'polarity item' is a lexical item that can appear only in\nenvironments associated with a particular grammatical polarity â affirmative or\nnegative. A polarity item that appears in affirmative (positive) contexts is\ncalled a 'positive polarity item' (PPI), and one that appears in negative\ncontexts is a 'negative polarity item' (NPI).\n\nThe environment in which a polarity item is permitted to appear is called a\n\"'licensing context'\". In the simplest case, an affirmative statement provides a\nlicensing context for a PPI, while negation provides a licensing context for an\nNPI. However there are many complications, and not all polarity items of a given\ntype need necessarily have exactly the same set of licensing contexts.\n","linknr":131,"url":"Positive_polarity_item","recorded":1362670411,"links":12,"instances":["linguistics","grammar","grammar","linguistics"],"pdf":["http://semarch.linguistics.fas.nyu.edu/Archive/WM0ZTVhZ/handbookpaper.pdf"],"categories":["Logic","Grammar"],"headings":["Polarity items in English","Determination of licensing contexts","See also","Notes","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["affirmative","linguistics"],["antecedent","grammar"],["conjunction","grammar"],["complement","linguistics"]],"members":["affirmative","conjunction","antecedent","complement"],"related":["Linguistics","Lexical_item","Grammatical_polarity","Affirmative_(linguistics)","English_grammar","Double_negative","Double_negative","Otto_Jespersen","Edward_Klima","Gilles_Fauconnier","Downward_entailing","Fauconnier–Ladusaw_hypothesis","Grammatical_particle","Quantifier","Antecedent_(grammar)","Indicative_conditional","Question","Restrictor","Conjunction_(grammar)","Comparative","Superlative","Subjunctive","Complement_(linguistics)","Imperative_mood","Nonveridicality","Frans_Zwarts","Downward_entailing","Idiom","Grammatical_polarity"]}
