Page is often credited with being the first\nband to bring synthpop music to Sweden. Their music and band members\n(particularly Eddie Bengtsson) influenced many subsequent Swedish synthpop acts,\nincluding Elegant Machinery, S.P.O.C.K, Sista Mannen PÃ¥ Jorden and KieTheVez.\n\nFormed in 1980 by Eddie Bengtsson and Marina Schiptjenko, soon joined by Anders\nEliasson, the band quickly gained underground cult-status releasing many singles\nsuch as Dansande man, Som skjuten ur en kanon, BlÃ¥ fÃ¶tter and Som en vind.\nThough most of their important influential work was released in the 1980s their\nfirst album, the self titled Page, was released in 1991. Page continued\nreleasing music throughout the 90's but is still most fondly remembered in the\nSwedish synthpop scene for their early singles, especially Dansande Man. Though\nthe band has never officially disbanded, it has been remarkably quiet since a\nperformance at SEMA (Swedish Electronic Music Awards) in 1999 when the band\npromised nothing new would ever be released under the name Page. However, a\ncompilation covering their two decades of work was released in 2000.\n\nAfter a decade of silence, in 2010 Page released an album of newly recorded\nmaterial called Nu, and performed two tracks live on Swedish TV show\n[[Nyhetsmorgon]] in May 2010. The album reached number 34 on the official\nSwedish album chart, Sverigetopplistan, following its release. Page performed at\nthe ElectriXmas events in MalmÃ¶ in 2012 and 2012, along with other selected\nshows. The latter appearance was part of a special performance by participants\nin the Friends of Electronically Yours album project, which was organised to\nraise money for charity.\n","linknr":109,"url":"Page_(band)","recorded":1362551520,"links":16,"instances":["band"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Swedish pop music groups","Synthpop groups"],"headings":["Discography","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/29/MusicalnotesSweden.svg/40px-MusicalnotesSweden.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["bwo","band"]],"members":["bwo"],"related":["Stockholm","Sweden","Synthpop","BWO_(band)","Marina_Schiptjenko","Eddie_Bengtsson","Anders_Eliasson","Sweden","Synthpop","Elegant_Machinery","S.P.O.C.K","Sista_Mannen_På_Jorden","Kiethevez","Marina_Schiptjenko"]}
