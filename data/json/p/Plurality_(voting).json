In other\nwords, in an election contested by more than two candidates, plurality occurs\nwhen one candidate receives the most votes but not necessarily more than half\nof the votes, while in a majority election a candidate wins if they receive\nover half of the votes. When no candidate receives a majority in the first\nround of voting, a two-round system or ranked voting system can be used to\nchoose a winner.\n\nSystems allowing plurality election are more vulnerable to corruption using the\nspoiler effect than systems which require a majority.
