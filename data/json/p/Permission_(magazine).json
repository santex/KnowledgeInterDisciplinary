Begun in\n1992 in Chicago by Jayson Elliot, the first issue appeared as a newsprint\n'zine, with a mix of articles about bands (such as Alien Sex Fiend and Young\nGods), amateur poetry, disturbing comics (such as a Scott Warren piece on\nserial killer Ed Gein), and fiction by local industrial musicians such as Jim\nMarcus (Die Warzaw).\n\nAs the industrial and gothic scenes peaked in the US during the early and mid-\nnineties, Permission grew rapidly, putting out ten issues at the rate of about\ntwo or three per year. Prior to Permission, the pre-eminent goth magazine had\nbeen [[Propaganda (magazine)|Propaganda]]; but its fan base began to stagnate\njust as Permission's began to grow. While Propaganda and its emulators (Ghastly,\nCarpe Noctem, Dark Angel, etc.) reflected a serious, almost dogmatic approach to\ngoth, Permission took a more jumbled, even humorous approach. Though it was\nprone to slip into self-importance from time to time as well, regular features\nlike \"Why'd You Get Kicked Out of Denny's?\" or \"Science Geek\" kept things light.\nEvery issue had comics in back, and readers were more likely to find a pin-up of\nprofessional wrestler The Undertaker than gothic makeup tips.\n\nPublishing in the days before the Web, Permission was, along with related\npublication [[IndustrialnatioN]], a primary source for reviews of goth and\nindustrial music. A typical issue would contain between one and two hundred\nalbum reviews. The writing quality was varied; though the features themselves\ncould be insightful.\n\nPermission's music coverage in the '90s reads like a guide to industrial/goth,\nfrom Skinny Puppy and KMFDM to Human Drama and Kommunity FK, and was known for\nits irreverent photography. Legendary Pink Dots wore giant toy hats in a photo\nbooth. Sheep on Drugs were given tiny birds and toy mushrooms. Thrill Kill Kult\nwas splayed across the hood of a flaming '70s conversion van. Pigface appeared\nas just an iron and a blender.\n\nA compilation album released by Permission was titled \"TV Terror: Felching A\nDead Horse\" and featured covers of television theme songs played by some of the\ndarkest, loudest bands of the time. The album had the distinction of being the\ncatalyst for the first use of the word \"felch\" on national television, when Kurt\nLoder reported its release on MTV News.\n\nThe magazine's creator Jayson Elliot was busy in the goth industrial scene, and\noften travelled to throw Permission parties or tour with bands. In 1994, he\nmanaged Procession, the \"world gothic tour\" featuring goth bands from four\ncountries traveling around the United States. While turnout was heavy for the\ntour, a series of mishaps and conflicts left him soured on the scene. Moving the\nmagazine to San Francisco in 1995, Permission continued to grow, though as its\ncirculation increased, Jayson took the direction further and further from its\npunk/goth/industrial origins. By 1997, the magazine had reached its peak of\npopularity, with over forty thousand readers, but the strain of running the\nmagazine and his own disaffection with the scene led Jayson to cease publication\nat the end of that year.\n\nIn 2004, Permission re-formed in New York City, again under Jayson Elliot's\ndirection. The magazine re-launched with an entirely new direction and design,\nmuch like [[Details (magazine)|Details]] magazine in the 1980s did, without\nreferencing the past. Now a fashion and lifestyle magazine, Permission bills\nitself as \"life + style for emerging artists\", and focuses on up-and-comers in\nall the creative fields.\n","linknr":129,"url":"Permission_(magazine)","recorded":1363414458,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Permission_(magazine)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Permission_(magazine)&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/Permission_(disambiguation)","/wiki/Permission","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Permission_(magazine)&action=edit","/wiki/Talk:Permission_(magazine)","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:TONE","/wiki/Wikipedia:Guide_to_writing_better_articles","/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Permission_(magazine)&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability","/wiki/Wikipedia:Identifying_reliable_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:Merge","/wiki/Wikipedia:Redirect","/wiki/Wikipedia:Deletion_policy","http://www.google.com/search?as_eq=wikipedia&q=%22Permission+%28magazine%29%22&num=50","http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Permission+%28magazine%29%22&tbm=nws&tbs=ar:1","http://www.google.com/search?tbs=bks:1&q=%22Permission+%28magazine%29%22","http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22Permission+%28magazine%29%22","http://www.jstor.org/action/doBasicSearch?Query=%22Permission+%28magazine%29%22&acc=on&wc=on","http://images.google.com/images?safe=off&as_rights=(cc_publicdomain%7ccc_attribute%7ccc_sharealike%7ccc_noncommercial%7ccc_nonderived)&q=%22Permission+%28magazine%29%22","/wiki/File:Pperrete.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/0a/Pperrete.jpg","/wiki/Goth_subculture","/wiki/Zine","/wiki/Alien_Sex_Fiend","/wiki/Young_Gods","/wiki/Ed_Gein","/wiki/Industrial_music","/wiki/Goth_subculture","/wiki/Propaganda_(magazine)","/wiki/Denny%27s","/wiki/The_Undertaker","/wiki/WWW","/wiki/IndustrialnatioN","/wiki/Skinny_Puppy","/wiki/KMFDM","/wiki/Human_Drama","/wiki/Kommunity_FK","/wiki/Legendary_Pink_Dots","/wiki/Sheep_on_Drugs","/wiki/Thrill_Kill_Kult","/wiki/Pigface","/wiki/Iron","/wiki/Blender_(device)","/wiki/Felching","/wiki/Kurt_Loder","/wiki/MTV_News","/wiki/San_Francisco","/wiki/Details_(magazine)","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Permission_(magazine)&oldid=541784567","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Goth_subculture","/wiki/Category:American_music_magazines","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_needing_style_editing_from_December_2007","/wiki/Category:All_articles_needing_style_editing","/wiki/Category:Articles_lacking_sources_from_January_2008","/wiki/Category:All_articles_lacking_sources","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_topics_of_unclear_notability_from_August_2012","/wiki/Category:All_articles_with_topics_of_unclear_notability","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Permission+%28magazine%29&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Permission+%28magazine%29","/wiki/Permission_(magazine)","/wiki/Talk:Permission_(magazine)","#","/wiki/Permission_(magazine)","/w/index.php?title=Permission_(magazine)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Permission_(magazine)&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Permission_(magazine)","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Permission_(magazine)","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Permission_(magazine)&oldid=541784567","/w/index.php?title=Permission_(magazine)&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Perm
