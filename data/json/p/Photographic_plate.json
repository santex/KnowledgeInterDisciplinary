A light-sensitive emulsion of silver salts was applied to a 'glass\nplate'. This form of photographic material largely faded from the consumer\nmarket in the early years of the 20th century, as more convenient and less\nfragile films were introduced. However, photographic plates were still in use by\nsome photography businesses until the 1970s, [http://www.harrowphotos.com Harrow Photos -\nHills & Saunders Photography Business - Glass plates used until the 1970s]\nand were in wide use by the professional astronomical community as late as the\n1990s. Such plates respond to ~2% of light received. Glass plates were far\nsuperior to film for research-quality imaging because they were extremely stable\nand less likely to bend or distort, especially in large-format frames for wide-\nfield imaging.\n\nEarly plates used the very inconvenient wet collodion process which was replaced\nlate in the 19th century by gelatin dry plates.\n","linknr":178,"url":"Photographic_plate","recorded":1362484286,"links":29,"instances":["moon","moon"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Photography equipment","Particle detectors","X-ray instrumentation","Medical imaging","Radiography"],"headings":["Scientific uses","Medical imaging","Decline","Preservation","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/04/AGFA_glas.jpg/220px-AGFA_glas.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/34/Femme-au-chien_neg.jpg/220px-Femme-au-chien_neg.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["phoebe","moon"],["charon","moon"]],"members":["phoebe","charon"],"related":["Photographic_film","Emulsion","Silver","Astronomy","Photographic_film","Collodion_process","Dry_plate","Astronomical_survey","Palomar_Observatory","National_Geographic_Society_â€“_Palomar_Observatory_Sky_Survey","Schmidt_telescope","Timeline_of_astronomical_maps,_catalogs,_and_surveys","Declination","Observatory","Harvard_College_Observatory","Sonneberg_Observatory","Variable_star","Minor_planet","Max_Wolf","323_Brucia","Natural_satellite","Phoebe_(moon)","Pluto","Blink_comparator","Charon_(moon)","Eastman_Kodak","Astrography","Astronomical_spectroscopy","Astrometry","Digital_imaging","High-energy_physics","Ionizing_radiation","Victor_Franz_Hess","Cosmic_radiation","Balloon","X-ray","Medical_imaging","Material_science","Image_plate","X-ray_detector","Charge-coupled_device","Digital_image_processing","Image_resolution","Pisgah_Astronomical_Research_Institute","Camera","Film_base"]}
