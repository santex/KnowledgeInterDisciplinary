A parent drug or chemical that\nwas previously non-toxic may be called a 'protoxin'.\n\nToxication may involve: \n   Changing the physicochemical properties to cause a change in the\n       microenvironment\n  Increasing the potency of a compound\n Conversion of the compound into: \n    Electrophile\n     Free radical\n    Nucleophile\n   Redox-active reactant   \n\nWhile toxication is generally undesirable, in certain cases it is required for\nthe [[in vivo]] conversion of a prodrug or chemical to a metabolite with desired\npharmacological or toxicological activity. Codeine is an example of a prodrug,\nwhich is metabolized in the body to the opiate known as morphine.\n","linknr":96,"url":"Protoxin","recorded":1362503833,"links":10,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Pharmacology","Biodegradation"],"headings":["Examples","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Metabolism","Medication","Chemical","Prodrug","Codeine","Opiate","Morphine","Methanol","CNS_depressant","Formic_acid","Formaldehyde","Acidosis","Optic_nerve","Paracetamol","Hepatotoxicity","NAPQI","Cytochrome_P450_oxidase","32p-postlabeling"]}
