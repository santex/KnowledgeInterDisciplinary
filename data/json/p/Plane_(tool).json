{"cursor":"15358","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nA hand 'plane' is a tool for shaping wood. When powered by electricity, the tool\nmay be called a planer. Planes are used to flatten, reduce the thickness of, and\nimpart a smooth surface to a rough piece of lumber or timber. Planing is used to\nproduce horizontal, vertical, or inclined flat surfaces on workpieces usually\ntoo large for shaping. Special types of planes are designed to cut joints or\ndecorative mouldings.\n\nHand planes are generally the combination of a cutting edge, such as a sharpened\nmetal plate, attached to a firm body, that when moved over a wood surface, take\nup relatively uniform shavings, by nature of the body riding on the 'high spots'\nin the wood, and also by providing a relatively constant angle to the cutting\nedge, render the planed surface very smooth. A cutter which extends below the\nbottom surface, or 'sole', of the plane slices off shavings of wood. A large,\nflat sole on a plane guides the cutter to remove only the highest parts of an\nimperfect surface, until, after several passes, the surface is flat and smooth.\n\nThough most planes are pushed across a piece of wood, holding it with one or\nboth hands, Japanese planes are pulled toward the body, not pushed away.\n\nWoodworking machinery that perform the same function as hand planes include\nthe jointer and the thickness planer, also called a thicknesser. When rough\nlumber is reduced to dimensional lumber, a large electric motor or internal\ncombustion engine will drive a thickness planer that removes excess wood to\ncreate a uniform, smooth surface on all four sides of the lumber and may also\nplane the edges.\n","linknr":643,"url":"Plane_(tool)","recorded":1362666272,"links":61,"instances":["mechanical_device","inventor","decorative","disambiguation"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Planes|","Woodworking hand tools","Articles containing video clips"],"headings":["History","Parts of a plane","Types of planes","Using a plane","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/Mergefrom.svg/50px-Mergefrom.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e3/Kanna2.gif","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1f/MaryRose-planes2.JPG/220px-MaryRose-planes2.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/Plane_parts.jpg/300px-Plane_parts.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/44/Bench_plane_iron.jpg/200px-Bench_plane_iron.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4e/Hoevl.jpg/200px-Hoevl.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c1/Strug_gladzik.jpg/200px-Strug_gladzik.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/Stanley_transitional_jointer_plane.jpg/200px-Stanley_transitional_jointer_plane.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/Stanley_55_01.jpg/200px-Stanley_55_01.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/97/Strug_wybierak.jpg/200px-Strug_wybierak.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9b/Fingerhoevle.jpg/200px-Fingerhoevle.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/With-grain.PNG/250px-With-grain.PNG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Against-grain.PNG/250px-Against-grain.PNG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["molding","decorative"],["wedge","mechanical_device"],["molding","decorative"],["leonard_bailey","inventor"],["planer","disambiguation"]],"members":["wedge","leonard_bailey","molding","planer"],"related":["Tool","Wood","Lumber","Woodworking_joints","Molding_(decorative)","Japanese_plane","Woodworking_machinery","Jointer","Thickness_planer","Lumber","Dimensional_lumber","Electric_motor","Internal_combustion_engine","Mortise_and_tenon","Mallet","Pompeii","Ancient_Rome","United_Kingdom","Germany","Iron","Blade","Wedge_(mechanical_device)","Cologne","Bronze","Molding_(decorative)","Newstead","Egypt","Adze","Leonard_Bailey_(inventor)","Stanley_Works","Bailey_plane","Justus_Traut","Bedrock_plane","Popular_Science","Ductile_iron","Bronze","Stanley_Black_&_Decker","Bedrock_plane","Lie-Nielsen_Toolworks","Block_plane","Wood","Wood_grain","Card_scraper","Planer_(disambiguation)","Shooting_board","Stanley_Works","Millers_Falls_Company","Cheese_slicer"]}
