{"cursor":"65078","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nA 'protein domain' is a conserved part of a given protein sequence and structure\nthat can evolve, function, and exist independently of the rest of the protein\nchain. Each domain forms a compact three-dimensional structure and often can be\nindependently stable and folded. Many proteins consist of several structural\ndomains. One domain may appear in a variety of different proteins. Molecular\nevolution uses domains as building blocks and these may be recombined in\ndifferent arrangements to create proteins with different functions. Domains vary\nin length from between about 25 amino acids up to 500 amino acids in length. The\nshortest domains such as zinc fingers are stabilized by metal ions or disulfide\nbridges. Domains often form functional units, such as the calcium-binding EF\nhand domain of calmodulin. Because they are independently stable, domains can be\n\"swapped\" by genetic engineering between one protein and another to make\nchimeric proteins.\n","linknr":1167,"url":"Protein_dynamics","recorded":1362509715,"links":33,"instances":["chemistry","biology","protein"],"pdf":["http://www.biochem.wisc.edu/courses/biochem704/Reading/Levinthal1968.pdf","http://www.biochem.wisc.edu/courses/biochem704/Reading/Levinthal1968.pdf"],"categories":["Protein structure","Protein domains"],"headings":["Background","Domains are units of protein structure","Domains as evolutionary modules","Multidomain proteins","Domains are autonomous folding units","Domains and protein flexibility","Domain definition from structural co-ordinates","See also","References","Key papers","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/Pyruvate_kinase_protein_domains.png/250px-Pyruvate_kinase_protein_domains.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/19/Domain_Homology.png/220px-Domain_Homology.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["chimera","protein"],["residue","chemistry"],["ptdins(3p"],["ptdins(4p"],["ptdins(3,4p2"],["ptdins(4,5p2"],["ptdins(3,4,5p3"],["promotor","biology"]],"members":["residue","promotor","chimera"],"related":["Tertiary_structure","Biological_evolution","Protein_folding","Molecular_evolution","Protein","Zinc_fingers","EF-hand","Calmodulin","Genetic_engineering","Chimera_(protein)","Lysozyme","Papain","Immunoglobulins","Protein_structure","Pyruvate_kinase","Enzyme","TIM_barrel","Protein_primary_structure","Protein","Residue_(chemistry)","Protein_secondary_structure","Alpha_helix","Beta_sheet","Protein_structure","Supersecondary_structure","Structural_motif","Structural_alignment","Protein_tertiary_structure","CATH","Protein_quaternary_structure","Archaea","Bacteria","Eukarya","Molecular_evolution","Protein_Data_Bank","Phosphoribosylamine-glycine_ligase","AIR_synthetase","GAR_transformylase","Evolution","Homologous_recombination","DNA_polymerase","Domine_Database","Titin","Chymotrypsin","Serine_protease","Kinesin","ABC_transporters","Christian_B._Anfinsen","Levinthal_paradox","Folding_funnel","Conformational_change","Database_of_Molecular_Motions","David_J_E_Callaway","Neutron_spin_echo","Pyruvate_phosphate_dikinase","Cα-Cα_distance_map","Cα-Cα_distance","Dendrogram","Shoshana_Wodak","Families_of_structurally_similar_proteins","Armadillo_repeats","BZIP_domain","Eukaryote","Protein_dimer","Arginine","Lysine","Cadherin_repeats","Cell_adhesion","Death_effector_domain","Caspase","Protease","Apoptosis","EF_hand","Helix-turn-helix","Structural_motif","Structural_domain","Signaling_protein","Calmodulin","Troponin-C","Immunoglobulin_superfamily","Amino_acid","Beta_sheet","Cysteine","Amino_acid","Cell_adhesion","Immune_system","Phosphotyrosine-binding_domain","Src_homology_2_domain-containing","IRS-1","NPXpY","Insulin","Pleckstrin_homology_domain","Phosphoinositide","PtdIns(3)P","PtdIns(4)P","PtdIns(3,4)P2","PtdIns(4,5)P2","PtdIns(3,4,5)P3","Src_homology_2_domain","Oncogene","Tyrosine_kinase","SH3_domain","Zinc_finger","Transcription_factor","Promotor_(biology)","Binding_domain","Short_linear_motif","Protein","Protein_structure","Protein_structure_prediction","Protein_structure_prediction_software","Protein_family","Structural_biology","Structural_Classification_of_Proteins","CATH"]}
