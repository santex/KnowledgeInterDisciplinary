{"cursor":"20176","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Predictive medicine' is a field of medicine that entails predicting the\nprobability of disease and instituting preventive measures in order to either\nprevent the disease altogether or significantly decrease its impact upon the\npatient (such as by preventing mortality or limiting\nmorbidity). http://wistechnology.com/articles/1296/ While different\nprediction methodologies exist, such as genomics, proteomics, and cytomics, the\nmost fundamental way to predict future disease is based on genetics. Although\nproteomics and cytomics allow for the early detection of disease, much of the\ntime those detect biological markers that exist because a disease process has\nalready started. However, comprehensive genetic testing (such as through the use\nof DNA arrays or full genome sequencing) allows for the estimation of disease\nrisk years to decades before any disease even exists, or even whether a healthy\nfetus is at higher risk for developing a disease in adolescence or adulthood.\nIndividuals who are more susceptible to disease in the future can be offered\nlifestyle advice or medication with the aim of preventing the predicted illness.\nCurrent genetic testing guidelines supported by the health care professionals\ndiscourage purely predictive genetic testing of minors until they are competent\nto understand the relevancy of genetic screening so as to allow them to\nparticipate in the decision about whether or not it is appropriate for\nthem. Genetic screening of newborns and children in the field of\npredictive medicine is deemed appropriate if there is a compelling clinical\nreason to do so, such as the availability of prevention or treatment as a child\nthat would prevent future disease.\n","linknr":377,"url":"Predictive_medicine","recorded":1362484788,"links":17,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://content.karger.com/produktedb/produkte.asp?DOI=CMG2001004002077&typ=pdf","http://content.karger.com/produktedb/produkte.asp?DOI=CMG2001004002077&typ=pdf"],"categories":["Medical specialties"],"headings":["The Goal","Examples of Predictive Medicine","Health Benefits","Limitations of Predictive Medicine","Ethics and Law","Literature Resources","Practitioners of Predictive Medicine","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Medicine","Disease","Death","Morbidity","Genomics","Proteomics","Cytomics","DNA_array","Full_genome_sequencing","Fetus","Genetic_screening","Dermatologist","Internist","Melanoma","EKG","Cardiologist","Cardiac_arrhythmia","MRIs","Mamograms","Breast_cancer","Association_studies","Mutation","BRCA1","Estrogen_positive_breast_cancer","Sporadic_breast_cancer","Factor_V","Blood_clots","Deep_vein_thrombosis","Myriad_Genetics","BRCA2","Newborn_screening","Phenylketonuria","Congenital","Hypothyroidism","Breast_cancer","Diagnostic_testing","Blood_pressure","Urinalysis","Biopsies","Medical_bioinformatics","Prenatal_testing","Embryo","Abortion","Ultrasonography","Placenta","Chorionic_villus_sampling","Carrier_testing","Preconception_testing","Glaucoma","Diabetes_mellitus","Hypertension","Myocardial_infarction","Cystic_fibrosis","Alleles","Protein","Smoking","Infection","Pollution","Health_Insurance_Portability_and_Accountability_Act","Genetic_Information_Nondiscrimination_Act","Kaiser_Family_Foundation","Brandon_Colby","Sergei_Grinkov","David_Bloom","NFL","Brandon_Colby","Newborn_screening","Full_genome_sequencing","Personalized_medicine","Molecular_imaging","Theranostics","The_Singularity"]}
