{"cursor":"5173","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" pair]] In biology, a 'pair bond' is the strong affinity that develops in some\n species between a pair consisting of a male and female, or in some cases as a\n same-sex pairing, potentially leading to producing offspring and/or a life-long\n bond. Pair-bonding is a term coined in the 1940s that is frequently\n used in sociobiology and evolutionary psychology circles. The term often\n implies either a lifelong socially monogamous relationship or a stage of mating\n interaction in socially monogamous species. It is sometimes used in reference\n to human relationships.\n\nMonogamous voles, such as prairie voles, have significantly greater density and\ndistribution of vasopressin receptors in their brain when compared to polygamous\nvoles. These differences are located in the ventral forebrain and the dopamine-\nmediated reward pathway.\n\nBoth vasopressin and dopamine act in this region to coordinate rewarding\nactivities such as mating, and regulate selective affiliation. These species\nspecific differences have shown to correlate with social behaviors, and in\nmonogamous prairie voles are important for facilitation of pair bonding.\n","linknr":142,"url":"Pair_bond","recorded":1362373743,"links":14,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Articles with inconsistent citation formats","Ethology","Animal sexuality"],"headings":["Varieties","Examples","See also","References","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/76/Two_Gannets_edit_2.jpg/240px-Two_Gannets_edit_2.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/Schakale_Kreuzkap_02.jpg/220px-Schakale_Kreuzkap_02.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Biology","Species","Male","Female","Homosexual_behavior_in_animals","Sociobiology","Evolutionary_psychology","Socially_monogamous","Vole","Prairie_vole","Vasopressin","Dopamine","Reward_pathway","Monogamous","Cuckold","Gibbon","Swinging","Bank_swallow","University_of_Florida","Gobies","Monogamous_pairing_in_animals","Breeding_pair","Human_bonding","Monogamy","Affectional_bond","Animal_sexuality","R/K_selection_theory"]}
