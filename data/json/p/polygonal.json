These segments are called its edges or sides, and the points where\ntwo edges meet are the polygon's [[Vertex (geometry)|vertices]] (singular:\nvertex) or corners. The interior of the polygon is sometimes called its body. An\n'n-gon' is a polygon with n sides. A polygon is a 2-dimensional example of the\nmore general polytope in any number of dimensions.\n\nThe word \"polygon\" derives from the Greek πολύς (polús) \"much\", \"many\" and γωνία\n(gōnía) \"corner\", \"angle\", or γόνυ (gónu) \"knee\".<ref>,\n[http://books.google.com/books?id=t1SS5S9IBqUC&pg=PA404 Extract of page\n404]</ref>\n\nThe basic geometrical notion has been adapted in various ways to suit particular\npurposes. Mathematicians are often concerned only with the bounding closed\npolygonal chain and with '[[simple polygon]]s' which do not self-intersect, and\nthey often define a polygon accordingly. A polygonal boundary may be allowed to\nintersect itself, creating '[[star polygon]]s'. Geometrically two edges meeting\nat a corner are required to form an angle that is not straight (180°);\notherwise, the line segments may be considered parts of a single edge; however\nmathematically, such corners may sometimes be allowed. These and other\ngeneralizations of polygons are described below.\n","title":"Polygon","headings":["Classification","Properties","Generalizations of polygons","Naming polygons","History","Polygons in nature","Polygons in computer graphics","See also","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["4: Star_polygon","4: Pentagram","4: Regular_polygon","3: Greek_language","3: Simple_polygon","3: Apeirogon","3: Pentagon","3: Hexagon","2: Shape","2: Polytope","2: Hilbert_space","2: Symmetry_orbit","2: Polyhedron","2: Triangle","2: Quadrilateral","2: Nonagon","2: Heptagon","2: Constructible_polygon","2: Computer_graphics","1: Geometry","1: Line_segment","1: Polygonal_chain","1: Branko_Grünbaum","1: Complex_number","1: Circle","1: Circumcircle","1: Inscribed_circle","1: Euclidean_geometry","1: Radian","1: Kepler-Poinsot_polyhedron","1: Supplementary_angle","1: Winding_number","1: Area","1: Centroid","1: Absolute_value","1: Shoelace_formula","1: Carl_Friedrich_Gauss","1: Green's_theorem","1: Exterior_angle","1: Pick's_theorem","1: Isoperimetric_inequality","1: Bolyai-Gerwien_theorem","1: Apothem","1: Complex_polygon","1: Line_of_symmetry","1: Abstract_polytope","1: Partially_ordered_set","1: Spherical_polygon","1: Hosohedron","1: Dihedron","1: Petrie_polygon","1: Late_Latin","1: Numerical_prefix","1: Mathematician","1: Numeral_system","1: Formula","1: Henagon","1: Digon","1: Compass_and_straightedge","1: Neusis_construction","1: Octagon","1: Enneagon","1: Decagon","1: Hendecagon","1: Angle_trisector","1: Dodecagon","1: Tridecagon","1: Tetradecagon","1: Pentadecagon","1: Hexadecagon","1: Heptadecagon","1: Octadecagon","1: Enneadecagon","1: Icosagon","1: Triacontagon","1: Hectogon","1: Hectometer","1: Chiliagon","1: René_Descartes","1: Immanuel_Kant","1: David_Hume","1: Myriagon","1: Megagon","1: Higher_alkanes","1: MathWorld","1: Complex_polytope","1: Northern_Ireland","1: Geology","1: Quasicrystal","1: Lava","1: Basalt","1: Giant's_Causeway","1: Ireland","1: Devil's_Postpile","1: California","1: Southeast_Asia","1: Honeycomb","1: Bee","1: Sea_star","1: Echinoderm","1: Sea_urchin","1: Jellyfish","1: Ctenophore","1: Carambola","1: Isaac_Newton","1: Lagrangian_point","1: Trojan_asteroid","1: Computational_geometry","1: Point_in_polygon","1: Boolean_operations_on_polygons","1: Cyclic_polygon","1: Geometric_shape","1: Golygon","1: Polygon_soup","1: Polygon_triangulation","1: Polyform","1: Synthetic_geometry","1: Tessellation","1: Tiling_puzzle","1: Coxeter"]}
