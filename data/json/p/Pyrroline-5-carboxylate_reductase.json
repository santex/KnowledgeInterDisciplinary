The systematic name\nof this enzyme class is 'L-proline:NAD(P)+ 5-oxidoreductase'. Other names in\ncommon use include 'proline oxidase', 'L-proline oxidase', '1-pyrroline-5-\ncarboxylate reductase', 'NADPH-L-Delta1-pyrroline carboxylic acid reductase',\nand 'L-proline-NAD(P)+ 5-oxidoreductase'. This enzyme participates in arginine\nand proline metabolism.\n","linknr":313,"url":"Pyrroline-5-carboxylate_reductase","recorded":1362481909,"links":16,"instances":["biochemistry","chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["EC 1.5.1","NADPH-dependent enzymes","NADH-dependent enzymes","Enzymes of known structure"],"headings":["Structural studies","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/b/e/ebe1915c432cf9c372b4ecfe36ff1fa2.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["substrate","biochemistry"],["product","chemistry"]],"members":["substrate","product"],"related":["Enzymology","Enzyme","Catalysis","Chemical_reaction","Substrate_(biochemistry)","L-proline","Nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide","Nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_phosphate","Product_(chemistry)","1-Pyrroline-5-carboxylic_acid","Nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide","Nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_phosphate","Hydrogen_ion","Oxidoreductase","Arginine","Proline","Tertiary_structure","Protein_Data_Bank"]}
