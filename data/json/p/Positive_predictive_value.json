{"cursor":"8315","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nIn statistics and diagnostic testing, the 'positive predictive value', or\n'precision rate' is the proportion of positive test results that are true\npositives (such as correct diagnoses). It is a critical measure of the\nperformance of a diagnostic method, as it reflects the probability that a\npositive test reflects the underlying condition being tested for. Its value\ndoes however depend on the prevalence of the outcome of interest, which may be\nunknown for a particular target population. The PPV can be derived using\nBayes' theorem.\n\nAlthough sometimes used synonymously, a positive predictive value generally\nrefers to what is established by control groups, while a post-test probability\nrather refers to a probability for an individual. Still, if the individual's pre-\ntest probability of the target condition is the same as the prevalence in the\ncontrol group used to establish the positive predictive value, the two are\nnumerically equal.\n","linknr":165,"url":"Positive_predictive_value","recorded":1362481398,"links":19,"instances":["information_retrieval","information_retrieval"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Biostatistics","Statistical ratios","Categorical data","Summary statistics for contingency tables"],"headings":["Definition","Worked example","Problems with positive predictive value","See also","References and notes"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/Merge-arrows.svg/50px-Merge-arrows.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/d/c/b/dcb747480c28dbf3a491fe7eba26aed8.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/b/8/5/b8577f58047076c8977757f872aab1b7.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["relevance","information_retrieval"],["gain","information_retrieval"]],"members":["gain","relevance"],"related":["Statistics","Diagnostic_testing","True_positive","Prevalence","Bayes'_theorem","Pre-_and_post-test_probability","Pre-test_probability","Negative_predictive_value","Sensitivity_and_specificity","Cross-sectional_study","Prevalence","Case-control_study","Fecal_occult_blood","Negative_predictive_value","Likelihood_ratios_in_diagnostic_testing","Pre-test_probability","Post-test_probabilities","Likelihood_ratios_in_diagnostic_testing","Binary_classification","Sensitivity_and_specificity","Negative_predictive_value","False_discovery_rate","Relevance_(information_retrieval)","Receiver-operator_characteristic","Gain_(information_retrieval)","Diagnostic_odds_ratio"]}
