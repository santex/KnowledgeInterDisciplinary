It was discovered\nin 1836 by Theodor Schwann who also coined its name from the Greek word pepsis,\nmeaning digestion (peptein: to digest). It was the first enzyme to be discovered, and, in 1929, it became one\nof the first enzymes to be crystallized, by John H. Northrop. Pepsin is a digestive protease, a member of the\naspartate protease family. {{cite web | title=Enzyme entry 3.4.23.1 | url=http://www.expasy.org/cgi-\nbin/nicezyme.pl?3.4.23.1\n| accessdate=2008-12-14}}\n\nPepsin is one of three principal protein-degrading, or proteolytic, enzymes in\nthe digestive system, the other two being chymotrypsin and trypsin. The three\nenzymes were among the first to be isolated in crystalline form. During the\nprocess of digestion, these enzymes, each of which is specialized in severing\nlinks between particular types of amino acids, collaborate to break down dietary\nproteins into their components, i.e., peptides and amino acids, which can be\nreadily absorbed by the intestinal lining. Pepsin is most efficient in cleaving\npeptide bonds between hydrophobic and preferably aromatic amino acids such as\nphenylalanine, tryptophan, and tyrosine.\n","linknr":682,"url":"Pepsin","recorded":1362504683,"links":49,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["EC 3.4.23","Peptidase","Stomach"],"headings":["History","Precursor","Activity and stability","In laryngopharyngeal reflux","Storage","Inhibitors","Applications","Genes","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/1PSO.png/220px-1PSO.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Pepstatin","Enzyme","Zymogen","Gastric_chief_cell","Stomach","Protein","Peptides","Theodor_Schwann","Greek_language","Digestion","John_H._Northrop","Digestive_system","Protease","Aspartate_protease","Enzymes","Chymotrypsin","Trypsin","Amino_acid","Peptide_bond","Hydrophobe","Aromaticity","Phenylalanine","Tryptophan","Tyrosine","Theodor_Schwann","Protein_expression","Zymogen","Primary_structure","Amino_acid","Chief_cell","Hydrochloric_acid","Parietal_cell","Gastrin","Vagus_nerve","Autocatalytic","Phenylalanine","Tryptophan","Tyrosine","Insulin","Duodenum","Laryngopharyngeal_reflux","Laryngopharyngeal_reflux","Rennet","Beemans_gum","Chewing_gum","Pepsi-Cola","Antibody","PGA5","PGA5","Gastricsin","Gastricsin","Chymotrypsin","Trypsin","MEROPS"]}
