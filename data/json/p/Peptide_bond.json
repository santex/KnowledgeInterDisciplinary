{"cursor":"6148","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nA 'peptide bond' ('amide bond') is a covalent chemical bond formed between two\nmolecules when the carboxyl group of one molecule reacts with the amino group of\nthe other molecule, causing the release of a molecule of water (H 2O),\nhence the process is a dehydration synthesis reaction (also known as a\ncondensation reaction), and usually occurs between amino acids. The resulting\nC(O)NH bond is called a peptide bond, and the resulting molecule is an amide.\nThe four-atom functional group -C(=O)NH- is called a 'peptide link'.\nPolypeptides and proteins are chains of amino acids held together by peptide\nbonds, as is the backbone of PNA.\n\n\n\nA peptide bond can only be broken by amide hydrolysis (the adding of water). The\npeptide bonds in proteins are metastable, meaning that in the presence of water\nthey will break spontaneously, releasing 8â16 kilojoule/mol (2â4 kcal/mol)\nMartin RB.

In living organisms, the process\nis facilitated by enzymes. Living organisms also employ enzymes to form peptide\nbonds; this process requires free energy.
