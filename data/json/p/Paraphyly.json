In phylogenetics (a subfield of biology) and in\n linguistics, a group is said to be 'paraphyletic' if it consists of all the\n descendants of the last common ancestor of the group's members minus a small\n number of monophyletic groups of descendants, typically just one or two such\n groups. For example, the group of reptiles, as traditionally defined, is\n paraphyletic: it contains the last common ancestor of the reptilesâincluding\n the extant reptiles as well as the extinct mammal-like reptilesâalong with all\n descendants of that ancestor except for mammals and birds.\n","linknr":389,"url":"Paraphyly","recorded":1362372763,"links":48,"instances":["biology"],"pdf":["http://www.umbc.edu/biosci/Faculty/OmlandLabWebpage/NewPages/papers/FunkOmlandARev.pdf","http://www.umbc.edu/biosci/Faculty/OmlandLabWebpage/NewPages/papers/FunkOmlandARev.pdf"],"categories":["Phylogenetics"],"headings":["Phylogenetics","Linguistics","Notes","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/Traditional_Reptilia.jpg/360px-Traditional_Reptilia.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/97/Monophyly%2C_paraphyly%2C_polyphyly.png/360px-Monophyly%2C_paraphyly%2C_polyphyly.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["kingdom","biology"]],"members":["kingdom"],"related":["Amniote","Phylogenetics","Biology","Linguistics","Most_recent_common_ancestor_","Monophyly_","Synapsid_","Primate","Loris","Tarsier","Clade","Anagenesis","Cladistics","Kingdom_(biology)","Vertebrate","Flowering_plant","Dicotyledon","Monocotyledon","ICBN","Angiosperm","Monocot","Dicot","Artiodactyla","Even-toed_ungulate","Cetacea","ICZN_Code","Reptile","Aves","Mammal","ICZN_Code","Mammal-like_reptiles","Diapsida","Alfred_Romer","Prokaryotes","Eukaryotes","Bacteria","Archaea","Edouard_Chatton","International_Code_of_Nomenclature_for_algae,_fungi,_and_plants_","ICNB","Osteichthyes","Actinopterygii","Sarcopterygii","Tetrapod","Dicotyledon","Monocotyledoneae","Angiospermae","Even-toed_ungulate","Cetacea","Cetartiodactyla","Reptile","Mammal","Bird","Amniota","Lizard","Snake","Squamate","Prokaryote","Eukaryota","Organism","Osteichthyes_","Tetrapoda","Euteleostomi","Pelycosaur","Therapsida","Synapsid","Monkey","Hominoidea","Simian","Plagiaulacida","Cimolodonta","Arginbaataridae","Multituberculata","Invertebrate","Vertebrate","Animal","Gymnosperm","Flowering_plants_","Spermatophyte","Fish","Tetrapod","Vertebrate","Prosimian","Simian","Primates","Crustacean","Hexapoda","Tetraconata","Neogene","Even-toed_ungulate_","Cetacea","Prokaryote","Eukaryotes","Evolutionary_grade","The_Ancestor's_Tale","Vivipary","Southern_Water_Skink_","Pelycosaur","Porpoise","Shark","Dorsal_fin","Mesozoic","Amphibious_fish","Convergent_evolution","Flightless_bird","Quadrupedalism_","Archosaur","Bipedalism_","Historical_linguistics","Cladistics","Formosan_languages","Austronesian_languages","Malayo-Polynesian_languages","Taiwan","Australian_National_University"]}
