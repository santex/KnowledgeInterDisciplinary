{"cursor":"4361","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"During the Middle Ages, the 'proprietary church' (Latin ecclesia propria, German\nEigenkirche) was a church, abbey or cloister built on private ground by a feudal\nlord, over which he retained proprietary interests, especially the right of what\nin English law is \"advowson\", that of nominating the ecclesiastic personnel. In\na small parish church this right may be trivial, but in the German territories\nof Otto the Great it was an essential check and control on the church, through\nwhich the Holy Roman Emperor largely ruled.\n\nIn the later Roman Empire the church had been centrally organized: all\nmonasteries and churches within a diocese, including their personnel and their\nproperties, were under the jurisdiction of the local bishop. Ulrich Stutz has\ndemonstrated that the institution of the proprietary church existed particularly\nin areas that had never been Roman, among the Irish and the Slavs, and in the\nEastern Roman Empire, but the proprietary church is best known in Germany, where\nthe Grundherr, the land lord who had founded the church on his property and\nendowed it from his lands, maintained the right of investiture, as he was the\n[[advocatus]] (German [[Vogt]]) of the fief, and responsible for its security\nand good order. In the 9th and 10th centuries the establishment of proprietary\nchurches in Germany swelled to their maximum. The layman who held the position\nwas a lay abbot. The altar was the legal anchor to which the structures, the\nland, the rights and ties were attached. Uta-Renate Blumenthal, The\nInvestiture Controversy: Church and Monarchy from the Ninth to the Twelfth\nCentury, 1988:5.  The proprietor and his heirs retained unabated legal\nrights to the ground on behalf of the saint whose relics lay beneath the altar.\n\"He could sell, lend or lease the altar, leave it to his heirs, use it for\ndower, or mortgage it, provided that a church, once dedicated, continued to be\nused as a church.\" Blumenthal 1988:5. The proprietary right could be\ngranted away or otherwise alienated, even for a sum of money, which compromised\nthe position of the spiritual community that it contained. In such a situation,\nsimony, the outright purchase of an ecclesiastic position through payment or\nbarter, was an ever-present problem, one that was attacked over and over in all\nthe synods of the 11th and early 12th century Gregorian reforms, and fuelled the\nInvestiture Controversy.\n\nWithin the Carolingian empire, the rules concerning proprietary churches had\nbeen expressly formulated in the ninth century, at the reforming councils of\n808, under Charlemagne and of 818/9, under Louis the Pious. Then proprietary\nchurches had been officially recognized, but the capitulations identify some of\nthe associated excesses, for it was agreed that the proprietor should not\nappoint nor depose priests without the assent of the bishop, nor appoint unfree\npersons. Every church was to be provided with a manse and its garden that were\nfree of seigneurial dues, where the priest could support himself, providing\nspiritual services. The rights of proprietarial founders were also delimited and\nprotected, for the bishop could not refuse to ordain a suitable candidate; the\nlegislation also protected the founder's right over proprietary abbeys to\nappoint a member of the founding family. Blumenthal 1988:5.\n\nThe Royal peculiars have remained proprietary churches until today.\n","linknr":112,"url":"Proprietary_church","recorded":1364150846,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Proprietary_church&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Proprietary_church&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/Middle_Ages","/wiki/Abbey","/wiki/Cloister","/wiki/Feudal","/wiki/Advowson","/wiki/Otto_the_Great","/wiki/Holy_Roman_Emperor","/wiki/Monastery","/wiki/Diocese","/wiki/Investiture","/wiki/Advocatus","/wiki/Vogt","/wiki/Lay_abbot","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Dower","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Simony","/wiki/Synods","/wiki/Gregorian_reform","/wiki/Investiture_Controversy","/wiki/Carolingian_empire","/wiki/Charlemagne","/wiki/Louis_the_Pious","/wiki/Serfdom","/wiki/Manse","/wiki/Abbey","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Royal_peculiars","/w/index.php?title=Proprietary_church&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","#cite_ref-2","#cite_ref-3","/w/index.php?title=Proprietary_church&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Proprietary_chapel","/w/index.php?title=Proprietary_church&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/Special:BookSources/3511006678","/wiki/Special:BookSources/3511000912","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Proprietary_church&oldid=540679422","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Middle_Ages","/wiki/Category:Feudalism","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Proprietary+church&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Proprietary+church","/wiki/Proprietary_church","/wiki/Talk:Proprietary_church","#","/wiki/Proprietary_church","/w/index.php?title=Proprietary_church&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Proprietary_church&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Proprietary_church","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Proprietary_church","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Proprietary_church&oldid=540679422","/w/index.php?title=Proprietary_church&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Proprietary_church&id=540679422","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Proprietary+church","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Proprietary+church&oldid=540679422&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Proprietary_church&printable=yes","//cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vlastnick%C3%BD_kostel","//de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenkirche","//fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89glise_propri%C3%A9taire","//it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiesa_proprietaria","//nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenkerk","//ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%A7%81%E6%9C%89%E6%95%99%E4%BC%9A%E5%88%B6","//ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A7%D0%B0%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%8F_%D1%86%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8C","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:ItemByTitle/enwiki/Proprietary
