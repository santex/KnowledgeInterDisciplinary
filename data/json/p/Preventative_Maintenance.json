This may be by preventing the failure before it actually\noccurs which Planned Maintenance and Condition Based Maintenance help to\nachieve. It is designed to preserve and restore equipment reliability by\nreplacing worn components before they actually fail. Preventive maintenance\nactivities include partial or complete overhauls at specified periods, oil\nchanges, lubrication and so on. In addition, workers can record equipment\ndeterioration so they know to replace or repair worn parts before they cause\nsystem failure. The ideal preventive maintenance program would prevent all\nequipment failure before it occurs.\n\nThere is a controversy of sorts regarding the propriety of the usage\nâpreventative.â Michael Quinion, [http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-\npre3.htm PREVENTATIVE OR PREVENTIVE], World Wide Words.
