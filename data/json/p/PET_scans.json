The system\n detects pairs of gamma rays emitted indirectly by a positron-emitting\n radionuclide (tracer), which is introduced into the body on a biologically\n active molecule. Three-dimensional images of tracer concentration within the\n body are then constructed by computer analysis. In modern scanners, three\n dimensional imaging is often accomplished with the aid of a CT X-ray scan\n performed on the patient during the same session, in the same machine.\n\nIf the biologically active molecule chosen for PET is FDG, an analogue of\nglucose, the concentrations of tracer imaged then give tissue metabolic\nactivity, in terms of regional glucose uptake. Use of this tracer to explore the\npossibility of cancer metastasis (i.e., spreading to other sites) is the most\ncommon type of PET scan in standard medical care (90% of current scans).\nHowever, on a minority basis, many other radiotracers are used in PET to image\nthe tissue concentration of many other types of molecules of interest.\n","recorded":1362123987,"portal":[],"list":[],"links":"642","instances":["18f","pet","geometry","chemistry","journal","journal","biochemistry","unit","medical"],"pdf":["http://www.nuclearonline.org/PI/Cardiogen.pdf","http://www.jneurosci.org/content/21/24/RC189.full.pdf","http://www.jneurosci.org/content/21/24/RC189.full.pdf","http://www.ans.org/pubs/magazines/nn/docs/2000-1-3.pdf"],"categories":["3d
