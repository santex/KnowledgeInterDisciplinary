Privately, however, the CIA and President\nDwight D. Eisenhower were aware of progress being made by the Soviets on Sputnik\nfrom secret spy plane imagery. PBS.org - NOVA:Sputnik Declassified\nTogether with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), ABMA built [[Explorer 1]] in\n84 days and launched it on January 31, 1958. Before work was completed, however,\nthe Soviet Union launched a second satellite, [[Sputnik 2]], on November 3,\n1957. Meanwhile, the spectacular televised failure of [[Vanguard TV3]] on\nDecember 6, 1957 deepened American dismay over the country's position in the\nSpace Race.\n\nOn March 17, 1958, [[Vanguard 1]] became the second artificial satellite\nsuccessfully placed in Earth orbit by the United States. It was the first solar-\npowered satellite. Just 152 mm (6 in) in diameter and weighing just\n1.4 kg (3 lb), Vanguard 1 was described by then-Soviet Premier Nikita\nKhrushchev as, \"The grapefruit satellite.\" \n\nVanguard 1 is the oldest artificial satellite still in space, as Vanguard's\npredecessors, Sputnik 1, Sputnik 2, and Explorer 1, have fallen out of orbit.\n","linknr":336,"url":"Project_Vanguard","recorded":1362267790,"links":30,"instances":["electricity","element","rocket","rocket","mass","rocket"],"pdf":["http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19740072500_1974072500.pdf"],"categories":["NASA programs","Rockets and missiles"],"headings":["Project history","The Navy's project","Accomplishments","Launch history","Notes","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Vanguard_rocket_vanguard1_satellite.jpg/220px-Vanguard_rocket_vanguard1_satellite.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e0/Vanguard_TV3.jpg/220px-Vanguard_TV3.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f5/Vanguard_rocket_exlodes.jpg/220px-Vanguard_rocket_exlodes.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["viking","rocket"],["redstone","rocket"],["mercury","element"],["battery","electricity"],["r-7","rocket"],["pound","mass"]],"members":["battery","mercury","viking","pound","redstone"],"related":["United_States","Naval_Research_Laboratory","Satellite","Earth","Orbit","Vanguard_rocket","Launch_vehicle","Cape_Canaveral_Air_Force_Station","Sputnik_crisis","Explorer_program","Army_Ballistic_Missile_Agency","Dwight_D._Eisenhower","Jet_Propulsion_Laboratory","Space_Race","Solar_energy","Soviet_Premier","Nikita_Khrushchev","American_Rocket_Society","Milton_W._Rosen","Viking_(rocket)","General_Electric","Alan_T._Waterman","National_Science_Foundation","International_Geophysical_Year","United_States_Air_Force","United_States_Army","United_States_Navy","Army_Ballistic_Missile_Agency","Wernher_von_Braun","Redstone_(rocket)","Juno_I","Atlas_ICBM","Rocket","Viking_rocket","Aerobee_rocket","Jet_Propulsion_Laboratory","United_States_Department_of_Defense","DOD_Committee_on_Special_Capabilities","International_Geophysical_Year","Science","Experiment","Sounding_rocket","Air_rights","Naval_Research_Laboratory","National_Science_Foundation","NASA","Mercury_(element)","Battery_(electricity)","Hermetically_sealed","Solar_cell","Minitrack","Army_Corps_of_Engineers","Air_Force_Space_Surveillance_System","Soviet_Union","United_States_Secretary_of_Defense","Neil_H._McElroy","United_States_Army","Juno_I","National_Air_and_Space_Museum","R-7_(rocket)","Apogee","Perigee","NASA","Goddard_Space_Flight_Center","Earth","Micrometeorite","North_Pole","South_Pole","Solar_cell","Pluto","Jupiter-C","R-7_Semyorka","Suborbital","Vanguard_TV3","Pound_(mass)","Ounce","Vanguard_rocket","Explorer_program","Sputnik_program","Sputnik_crisis"]}
