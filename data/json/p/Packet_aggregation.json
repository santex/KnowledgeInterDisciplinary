{"cursor":"1185","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In a packet-based communications network, 'packet aggregation' is the process of\njoining multiple packets together into a single transmission unit, in order to\nreduce the overhead associated with each transmission.\n\nPacket aggregation is useful in situations where each transmission unit may have\nsignificant overhead (preambles, headers, cyclic redundancy check, etc.) or\nwhere the expected packet size is small compared to the maximum amount of\ninformation that can be transmitted.\n\nIn a communication system based on a layered OSI model, packet aggregation may\nbe responsible for joining multiple MSDUs into a single MPDU that can be\ndelivered to the physical layer as a single unit for transmission.\n\nThe ITU-T G.hn standard, which provides a way to create a high-speed (up to 1\nGigabit/s) Local area network using existing home wiring (power lines, phone\nlines and coaxial cables), is an example of a protocol that employs packet\naggregation to increase efficiency.\n","linknr":80,"url":"Packet_aggregation","recorded":1362482978,"links":10,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Packets (information technology)"],"headings":["See also"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Syncword","Cyclic_redundancy_check","OSI_model","MSDU","MPDU","Physical_layer","ITU-T","G.hn","Local_area_network","Power_line_communication","Ethernet_over_coax","Packet_segmentation","Frame_aggregation"]}
