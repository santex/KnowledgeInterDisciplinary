The address of a pixel corresponds to its\n physical coordinates. LCD pixels are manufactured in a two-dimensional grid,\n and are often represented using dots or squares, but CRT pixels correspond to\n their timing mechanisms and sweep rates.\n\nEach pixel is a sample of an original image; more samples typically provide more\naccurate representations of the original. The intensity of each pixel is\nvariable. In color image systems, a color is typically represented by three or\nfour component intensities such as red, green, and blue, or cyan, magenta,\nyellow, and black.\n\nIn some contexts (such as descriptions of camera sensors), the term pixel is\nused to refer to a single scalar element of a multi-component representation\n(more precisely called a photosite in the camera sensor context, although the\nneologism [[wikt:sensel|sensel]] is sometimes used to describe the elements of a\ndigital camera's sensor),<ref></ref> while in others the term may refer to the\nentire set of such component intensities for a spatial position. In color\nsystems that use chroma subsampling, the multi-component concept of a pixel can\nbecome difficult to apply, since the intensity measures for the different color\ncomponents correspond to different spatial areas in such a representation.\n\nThe word pixel is based on a contraction of pix (\"pictures\") and el (for\n\"element\"); similar formations with el&nbsp; for \"element\" include the words\nvoxel<ref name=\"JF\">{{cite book\n  | last = Foley | first = James D. coauthors = Andries van Dam, John F.
