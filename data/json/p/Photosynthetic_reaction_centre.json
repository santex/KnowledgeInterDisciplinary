{"cursor":"20872","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nA 'photosynthetic reaction centre' (or 'photosynthetic reaction center') is a\ncomplex of several proteins, pigments and other co-factors assembled together to\nexecute the primary energy conversion reactions of photosynthesis. Molecular\nexcitations, either originating directly from sunlight or transferred as\nexcitation energy via light-harvesting antenna systems, give rise to electron\ntransfer reactions along a series of protein-bound co-factors. These co-factors\nare light-absorbing molecules (also named chromophores or pigments) such as\nchlorophyll and phaeophytin, as well as quinones. The energy of the photon is\nused to promote an electron to a higher molecular energy level of a pigment. The\nfree energy created is then used to reduce a chain of nearby electron acceptors,\nwhich have subsequently higher redox-potentials. These electron transfer steps\nare the initial phase of a series of energy conversion reactions, ultimately\nresulting in the production of chemical energy during photosynthesis.\n","linknr":315,"url":"Photosynthetic_reaction_centre","recorded":1362897871,"links":22,"instances":["chemistry","biology","fluid"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Light reactions","Photosynthesis","Integral membrane proteins"],"headings":["Transforming light energy into charge separation","Bacteria","Green plants","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f6/Photoarrange.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/2c/Reactprotdatbnk.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/First_satge_sbep2.svg/500px-First_satge_sbep2.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a1/Photosystem-II_2AXT.PNG/500px-Photosystem-II_2AXT.PNG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/b/d/0bda73b860b3215bb97060e84f251fc8.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/44/PSII_new_design.svg/200px-PSII_new_design.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/1/0/810e2d49a36913670a03a711abf63a7c.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["homology","biology"],["stroma","fluid"],["dimer","chemistry"]],"members":["dimer","homology","stroma"],"related":["Photosynthesis","Fluorescence_resonance_energy_transfer","Light-harvesting_complex","Electron_transfer","Chromophore","Biological_pigments","Chlorophyll","Pheophytin","Quinones","Photon","Electron","Excited_state","Thermodynamic_free_energy","Electron_acceptor","Redox_potential","Electron_transfer","Photosynthesis","Plant","Algae","Bacteria","Evolution","Homology_(biology)","Light-harvesting_complex","Photosystem_I","Photosystem_II","Light-harvesting_complex","Polypeptide_chain","Fluorescence_resonance_energy_transfer","Light-harvesting_complex","Electron","Electron_transport_chain","Photon","Energy_level","Reduction_potential","Pheophytin","Quinone","Plastoquinone","Cytochrome_b6f_complex","Ferredoxin","NADPH","Protons","Chloroplast","Stroma_(fluid)","Thylakoid_lumen","Thylakoid_membrane","Adenosine_triphosphate","ATP_synthase","Calvin_cycle","Roderick_Clayton","Hartmut_Michel","Johann_Deisenhofer","Robert_Huber","Nobel_Prize_in_Chemistry","Photosynthetic_reaction_center_protein_family","Lipid_bilayer","Alpha_helices","Bacteriochlorophyll","Bacteriophaeophytin","Quinone","Infrared","Dimer_(chemistry)","Periplasm","Charge_separation","Heat","Redox_reaction","Coenzyme_Q_-_cytochrome_c_reductase","Joseph_Priestley","Mouse","Jan_Ingenhousz","Phlogiston_theory","Photosystem_II","Photosynthetic_reaction_center_protein_family","Catalyst","Photolysis","Atmosphere","Martin_David_Kamen","Stable_isotope","Manganese","Ions","Bacteriochlorophyll","P680","Photoinduced_charge_separation","Electric_charge","Oxidant","Water","Calcium","Chlorine","Tyrosine","Cytochrome_b6f_complex","Plastocyanin","Copper","Photosystem_I","P700","Wavelength","Plastocyanin","Z-scheme","Redox","Light-harvesting_complex","Photosynthesis","Photosystem","Phycobilisome","Photosynthetic_reaction_center_protein_family"]}
