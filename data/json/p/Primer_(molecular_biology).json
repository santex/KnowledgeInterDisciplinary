{"cursor":"10346","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nA 'primer' is a strand of nucleic acid that serves as a starting point for DNA\nsynthesis. They are required for DNA replication because the enzymes that\ncatalyze this process, DNA polymerases, can only add new nucleotides to an\nexisting strand of DNA. The polymerase starts replication at the 3'-end of the\nprimer, and copies the opposite strand.\n\nIn most cases of natural DNA replication, the primer for DNA synthesis and\nreplication is a short strand of RNA (which can be made ''de novo'').\n\nMany of the laboratory techniques of biochemistry and molecular biology that\ninvolve DNA polymerase, such as DNA sequencing and the polymerase chain reaction\n(PCR), require DNA primers. These primers are usually short, chemically\nsynthesized oligonucleotides, with a length of about twenty bases. They are\nhybridized to a target DNA, which is then copied by the polymerase.\n","linknr":392,"url":"Primer_(molecular_biology)","recorded":1362544513,"links":40,"instances":["molecular_biology","dna","molecular_biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Molecular biology","DNA replication"],"headings":["Mechanism ''in vivo''","Uses of synthetic primers","PCR primer design","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8f/DNA_replication_en.svg/300px-DNA_replication_en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["directionality","molecular_biology"],["upstream_and_downstream","dna"],["sense","molecular_biology"]],"members":["directionality","upstream_and_downstream","sense"],"related":["Nucleic_acid","DNA_replication","Enzyme","DNA_polymerase","Nucleotides","Directionality_(molecular_biology)","DNA","RNA","De_novo_synthesis","Biochemistry","Molecular_biology","DNA_sequencing","Polymerase_chain_reaction","Oligonucleotide_synthesis","Oligonucleotides","Nucleic_acid_hybridization","DNA_polymerase_III","Okazaki_fragment","Primase","Hydroxyl","DNA_polymerase_I","DNA_polymerase_Î´","Eukaryotes","Prokaryotes","Deoxyribonucleotides","DNA_ligase","Upstream_and_downstream_(DNA)","Endonuclease_1","Replication_protein_A","Dna2_nuclease","HIV","Reverse_transcription","Reverse_transcriptase","Sense_(molecular_biology)","DNA_sequencing","Polymerase_chain_reaction","BLAST","National_Center_for_Biotechnology_Information","Beacon_Designer","In_silico_PCR","TA_cloning","Gene","Organism","Protein_sequence","Codon","Amino_acid","Amino_acid","Isoleucine","Adenine","Thymine","Adenine","Thymine","Cytosine","Genetic_code","Codon","Degenerate_bases","Touchdown_PCR","GenBank","Oligonucleotide_synthesis"]}
