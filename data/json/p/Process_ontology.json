A formal process ontology is an\nontology in the knowledge domain of processes. Often such ontologies take\nadvantage of the benefits of an upper ontology. Planning software can be used to\nperform plan generation based on the formal description of the process and its\nconstraints. Numerous efforts have been made to define a process/planning\nontology.\n\nIn philosophy, a 'process ontology' refers to a universal model of the structure\nof the world as an ordered wholeness. Such ontologies are\nFundamental Ontologies, in contrast to the so-called Applied Ontologies.\nFundamental ontologies do not claim to be accessible to any empirical proof in\nitself, but to be a structural design pattern, out of which empirical phenomena\ncan be explained and put together consistently. Throughout Western history, the\ndominating fundamental ontology is the so-called substance theory. However,\nfundamental process ontologies are becoming more important in recent times,\nbecause the progress in the discovery of the foundations of physics spurred the\ndevelopment of a basic concept able to integrate such boundary notions as\n\"Energy,\" \"Object,\" and those of the physical dimensions of space and time.\n","linknr":232,"url":"Process_ontology","recorded":1362477416,"links":36,"instances":["information_science","philosophy","information_science","philosophy"],"pdf":["http://www.loa-cnr.it/Papers/D07_v21a.pdf","http://www.loa-cnr.it/Papers/D07_v21a.pdf","http://www.loa-cnr.it/Papers/D07_v21a.pdf","http://www.loa-cnr.it/Papers/D07_v21a.pdf","http://www.aiai.ed.ac.uk/~stuart/Papers/plan01-ws.pdf","http://www.aiai.ed.ac.uk/~stuart/Papers/plan01-ws.pdf","http://www.aiai.ed.ac.uk/~stuart/Papers/ekaw02-aitken-curtis.pdf","http://www.aiai.ed.ac.uk/~stuart/Papers/ekaw02-aitken-curtis.pdf","http://www.ip-super.org/res/Deliverables/M12/D1.1.pdf","http://www.ip-super.org/res/Deliverables/M12/D1.1.pdf","http://www.ip-super.org/res/Deliverables/M36/D1.5.pdf","http://www.ip-super.org/res/Deliverables/M36/D1.5.pdf","http://www.loa-cnr.it/Papers/D07_v21a.pdf","http://www.loa-cnr.it/Papers/D07_v21a.pdf","http://www.loa-cnr.it/Papers/D18.pdf","http://www.loa-cnr.it/Papers/D18.pdf","http://www.deri.ie/fileadmin/documents/DERI-TR-2008-04-01.pdf","http://www.deri.ie/fileadmin/documents/DERI-TR-2008-04-01.pdf","http://www.onto-med.de/publications/2010/gfo-basic-principles.pdf","http://www.onto-med.de/publications/2010/gfo-basic-principles.pdf","http://www.m3pe.org/deliverables/process-ontology.pdf","http://www.m3pe.org/deliverables/process-ontology.pdf","http://www.m3pe.org/publications/m3po.pdf","http://www.m3pe.org/publications/m3po.pdf","http://www.m3pe.org/publications/m3pl_sbpm2006.pdf","http://www.m3pe.org/publications/m3pl_sbpm2006.pdf"],"categories":["Ontology (information science)","Business process","Automated planning and scheduling"],"headings":["Processes","Ontologies","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["ontology","information_science"],["upper_ontology","information_science"],["object","philosophy"],["upper_ontology","information_science#dolce_and_dns"],["upper_ontology","information_science#dolce_and_dns"],["upper_ontology","information_science#general_formal_ontology_.28gfo.29"],["process","philosophy"],["upper_ontology","information_science"]],"members":["ontology","object","upper_ontology","process"],"related":["Computer_science","Ontology_(information_science)","Upper_ontology_(information_science)","Automated_planning_and_scheduling","Process_philosophy","Fundamental_ontology","Applied_ontology","Empirical","Phenomena","Substance_theory","Energy","Object_(philosophy)","Space","Time","Workflow","Sequence_of_events","Business_process","Timestamp","Web_Services_Modeling_Language","OCML","XPDL","Web_Ontology_Language","Web_Services_Modeling_Language","Process_Specification_Language","RosettaNet","Suggested_Upper_Merged_Ontology","Eclass","Web_Services_Modeling_Language","Process_Specification_Language","XPDL","Process_Specification_Language","YAWL","BPEL","WS-CDL","Automated_planning_and_scheduling","Business_process","Manufacturing_process_management","Process_management","Process_(philosophy)","Sequence_of_events","Systems_theory","Upper_ontology_(information_science)"]}
