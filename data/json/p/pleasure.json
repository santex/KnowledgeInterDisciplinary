It includes more\nspecific mental states such as happiness, entertainment, enjoyment, ecstasy,\nand euphoria. In psychology, the pleasure principle describes pleasure as a\npositive feedback mechanism, motivating the organism to recreate in the\nfuture the situation which it has just found pleasurable. According to this\ntheory, organisms are similarly motivated to avoid situations that have\ncaused pain in the past.\n\nThe experience of pleasure is subjective and different individuals will\nexperience different kinds and amounts of pleasure in the same situation. Many\npleasurable experiences are associated with satisfying basic biological drives,\nsuch as eating, exercise, sex or defecation. Other pleasurable experiences are\nassociated with social experiences and social drives, such as the experiences of\naccomplishment, recognition, and service. The appreciation of cultural artifacts\nand activities such as art, music, and literature is often pleasurable.\n\nIn recent years, significant progress has been made in understanding the brain\nmechanisms underlying pleasure.<ref></ref> One of the key discoveries was made\nby Kent C. Berridge who has shown that pleasure is not a unitary experience.\nRather, pleasure consists of multiple brain processes including liking, wanting\nand learning subserved by distinct yet partially overlapping brain\nnetworks.<ref>Berridge, K.C., Kringelbach, M.L. (2008) Affective neuroscience of\npleasure: Reward in humans and other animals. Psychopharmacology 199, 457-\n80.</ref> In particular, this research has been helped by the use of objective\npleasure-elicited reactions in humans and other animals such as the behavioral\n‘liking’/‘disliking’ facial expressions to tastes that are homologous between\nhumans and many other mammals.<ref name=\"face\">[http://www.lsa.umich.edu/psych/-\nresearch&labs/berridge/VideoIndex.htm Videos of Pleasure-elicited\nReactions.]</ref>\n\nRecreational drug use can be pleasurable: some drugs, illicit and otherwise,\ndirectly create euphoria in the human brain when ingested. The mind's natural\ntendency to seek out more of this feeling (as described by the pleasure\nprinciple) can lead to dependence and addiction. Berridge and Robinson have\nproposed that addiction results from drugs hijacking the ‘wanting’ system\nthrough a sensitization of the mesolimbic dopamine system.<ref>Robinson, T.E.,\nBerridge, K.C. 1993 The neural basis of drug craving: an incentive-sensitization\ntheory of addiction.
