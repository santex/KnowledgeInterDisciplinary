Alternative expert review indicates there is insufficient\nscientific evidence for supplemental probiotics having a benefit.\n\nLactic acid bacteria (LAB) and bifidobacteria are the most common types of\nmicrobes used as probiotics, but certain yeasts and bacilli may also be used.\nProbiotics are commonly consumed as part of fermented foods with specially added\nactive live cultures, such as in yogurt, soy yogurt, or as dietary supplements.\nProbiotics are also delivered in fecal transplants, in which stool from a\nhealthy donor is delivered like a suppository to an infected patient.

Metchnikoff, E. 1907. Essais\noptimistes. Paris. The prolongation of life. Optimistic studies. Translated and\nedited by P. Chalmers Mitchell. London: Heinemann, 1907. Studies are\nexamining whether probiotics affect mechanisms of intestinal inflammation, diarrhea, urogenital infections or allergies. Through 2012,\nhowever, in all cases proposed as health claims to the European Food Safety\nAuthority, the scientific evidence remains insufficient to prove a cause and\neffect relationship between consumption of probiotic products and any health\nbenefit.\n\nWhen a person takes antibiotics, both the harmful bacteria and the beneficial\nbacteria are killed. A reduction of beneficial bacteria can lead to digestive\nproblems, such as diarrhea, yeast infections and urinary tract infections. The\npossibility that supplemental probiotics affect such digestive issues is\nunknown, and remains under study.
