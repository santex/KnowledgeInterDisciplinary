Polystyrene can be rigid or foamed. General\npurpose polystyrene is clear, hard and brittle. It is a very inexpensive resin\nper unit weight. It is a rather poor barrier to oxygen and water vapor and has\nrelatively low melting point. Polystyrene is one of the\nmost widely used plastics, the scale of its production being several billion\nkilograms per year. Polystyrene can be naturally transparent,\nbut can be colored with colorants. Uses include protective packaging (such as\npacking peanuts and CD and DVD cases), containers (such as \"clamshells\"), lids,\nbottles, trays, tumblers, and disposable cutlery.\n\nAs a thermoplastic polymer, polystyrene is in a solid (glassy) state at room\ntemperature but flows if heated above about 100 Â°C, its glass transition\ntemperature. It becomes rigid again when cooled. This temperature behavior is\nexploited for molding and extrusion, since it can be cast into molds with\nfine detail.\n\nIt is very slow to biodegrade and therefore a focus of controversy, since it is\noften abundant as a form of litter in the outdoor environment, particularly\nalong shores and waterways especially in its foam form.\n","linknr":661,"url":"Polystyrene","recorded":1362688729,"links":70,"instances":["physics","biophysical","optics","physical","chemistry","process","unit","chemistry"],"pdf":["http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/ToxProfiles/tp53-c1-b.pdf","http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/ToxProfiles/tp53-c1-b.pdf","http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/ntp/ohat/styrene/Styrene_Monograph.pdf","http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/ntp/ohat/styrene/Styrene_Monograph.pdf","http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/jres/096/6/V96-6.pdf"],"categories":["Insulators","Building
