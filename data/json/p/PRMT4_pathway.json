PRMT4 binds to\nthe classes of transcriptional activators known as p160 and CBP/p300.

Proc Natl Acad Sci\nU S A. 2005 Nov 8;102(45):16321-6 The modiï¬ed forms of these proteins are\ninvolved in stimulation of gene expression via steroid hormone receptors.\nSigniï¬cantly, PRMT4 methylates core histones H3 and H4, which are also targets\nof the histone acetylase activity of CBP/p300 coactivators. PRMT4 recruitment of\nchromatin by binding to coactivators increases histone methylation and enhances\nthe accessibility of promoter regions for transcription. Methylation of the\ntranscriptional coactivator CBP by PRMT4 inhibits binding to CREB and thereby\npartitions the limited cellular pool of CBP for steroid hormone receptor\ninteraction.\n","linknr":106,"url":"PRMT4_pathway","recorded":1362481200,"links":11,"instances":["biology","genetics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Gene expression"],"headings":["References","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/3d/PRMTpathway.jpg/400px-PRMTpathway.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["promoter","biology"],["transcription","genetics"]],"members":["promoter","transcription"],"related":["Arginine","Methyltransferase","Methylation","Arginine","Proteins","Transcriptional","Transcriptional","Proteins","Gene_expression","Hormone_receptor","Histone","Histone","Chromatin","Histone","Methylation","Promoter_(biology)","Transcription_(genetics)","Methylation","Transcriptional","Steroid_hormone","DNA_methyltransferase","Nucleosome","Histone","Histone-Modifying_Enzymes","Chromatin","Diet_and_cancer"]}
