{"cursor":"8564","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" of dendrite growth.]] The science of 'pattern formation' deals with the\n visible, (statistically) orderly outcomes of self-organization and the common\n principles behind similar patterns in nature.\n\nIn developmental biology, pattern formation refers to the generation of complex\norganizations of cell fates in space and time. Pattern formation is controlled\nby genes. The role of genes in pattern formation is best understood in the anterior-\nposterior patterning of embryos from the model organism Drosophila melanogaster\n(fruit fly).\n","linknr":227,"url":"Pattern_formation","recorded":1362482704,"links":15,"instances":["group","crystal","computer_graphics"],"pdf":["http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~aw/pdf/texture.pdf"],"categories":["Developmental biology"],"headings":["Examples","Analysis","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/67/Homebrew_reaction_diffusion_example_512iter.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/c/0/6/c065bf563b140dd266fa770a78d42a1f.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/f/2/0f2ed5bdd101e0ca28a9b2716ddc9d42.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/a/5/6/a56b142191daaecbc491fdaf7ad4fb16.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/2/3/f234d0db83f1b280277a38ad8fe2d097.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["dendrite","crystal"],["texture","computer_graphics"],["lattice","group"]],"members":["lattice","dendrite","texture"],"related":["Dendrite","Statistically","Self-organization","Patterns_in_nature","Cell_fate_determination","Animal_markings","Phyllotaxis","Tonotopy","Lotka–Volterra_equation","Patterns_in_nature","Cell_fate_determination","Morphogen","Cell_signaling","French_flag_model","Insect","Tiger_bush","Reaction–diffusion_system","Belousov–Zhabotinsky_reaction","Liesegang_rings","Bénard_cell","Laser","Cloud","Dendrite_(crystal)","Freezing","Liquid_crystal","Sphere_packing","Finite_state_machine","Texture_(computer_graphics)","Shader","3D_modeling","Kai's_Power_Tools","Reaction–diffusion_system","Image_embossing","Edge_detection","Computer_simulation","Reaction-diffusion","MClone","Partial_differential_equation","Swift–Hohenberg_equation","Nonlinear_system","Differential_operator","Lattice_(group)","Ordinary_differential_equation","Dynamical_system","Bifurcation_theory","Convection","Rayleigh-Bénard","Hysteresis","Mathematica","Fractal","Morphogenesis","Reaction–diffusion_system","Regional_specification","Embryogenesis","Embryo","Model_organism","Drosophila_embryogenesis","Tagmosis","Projective_Geometry","Gradient_Pattern_Analysis","Lee_Segel","MClone","Three-phase_traffic_theory","TexRD"]}
