{"cursor":"3012","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Pilot' ( (PaÄ­lot) was a Russian icebreaker, the world's first steam-powered and\nmetal-ship icebreaker of modern type.\n\nPilot had originally been built as a steam-powered propeller tug. It had the bow\naltered to achieve an ice-clearing capability (20Â° raise from keel line).\nConversion had been done in 1864 under an order of its owner, the local merchant\nMikhail Britnev. This allowed the Pilot to push itself on the top of the ice and\nconsequently break it. It's said that M.O. Britnev fashioned the bow of his ship\nafter the shape of old wooden Pomor boats (kochs), which had been navigating icy\nwaters of the White Sea and Barents Sea for centuries.\n\nThe Pilot was used between 1864-1890 for navigation in the Gulf of Finland\nbetween Kronstadt and Oranienbaum thus extending the summer navigation season by\nseveral weeks. Inspired by the success of the Pilot, Mikhail Britnev built a\nsecond similar vessel \"Boy\" (\"Battle\" in Russian) in 1875 and a third \"Booy\"\n(\"Buoy\" in Russian) in 1889.\n\nThe cold winter of 1870â1871 led to the international recognition of Britnev's\ndesign. That year the Elbe River and the port of Hamburg froze, which caused a\nprolonged halt of navigation and huge commercial losses. In such circumstances,\nGermans purchased the Pilot's design from Britnev for some 300\nrubles.

Thus the German\nEisbrecher I appeared in 1871, and other European countries soon\nfollowed the suit.\n\nWith its rounded shape and strong metal hull, Pilot had all the main features\npresent in the modern icebreakers, therefore it is often considered the first\ntrue icebreaker. Another contender for this title is icebreaker [[Icebreaker\nYermak|Yermak]], built in England for Russia according to the design of Admiral\nStepan Makarov and under his supervision. Makarov borrowed the main principles\nfrom Pilot and applied them for creation of the first polar icebreaker, which\nwas able to run over and crush pack ice.\n","linknr":109,"url":"Pilot_(icebreaker)","recorded":1362576210,"links":14,"instances":["ship","boat","ship"],"pdf":["http://filologdirect.narod.ru/history/2006_04_03.pdf"],"categories":["Russian inventions","Icebreakers of Russia"],"headings":["Literature","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2b/1976._%D0%9B%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BB_%D0%9F%D0%B0%D0%B9%D0%BB%D0%BE%D1%82.jpg/250px-1976._%D0%9B%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BB_%D0%9F%D0%B0%D0%B9%D0%BB%D0%BE%D1%82.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["hull","ship"],["bow","ship"],["koch","boat"]],"members":["bow","koch","hull"],"related":["Russia","Icebreaker","Hull_(ship)","Tug","Bow_(ship)","Mikhail_Britnev","Pomors","Koch_(boat)","White_Sea","Barents_Sea","Gulf_of_Finland","Kronstadt","Oranienbaum,_Russia","Russian_language","Elbe_River","Hamburg","Ruble","England","Russia","Stepan_Makarov","Pack_ice"]}
