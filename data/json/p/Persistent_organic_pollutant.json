{"cursor":"9426","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Persistent organic pollutants' ('POP's) are organic compounds that are\nresistant to environmental degradation through chemical, biological, and\nphotolytic processes. Because of this, they have been\nobserved to persist in the environment, to be capable of long-range transport,\nbioaccumulate in human and animal tissue, biomagnify in food chains, and to have potential significant impacts on human health and\nthe environment.\n\nMany POPs are currently or were in the past used as pesticides. Others are used\nin industrial processes and in the production of a range of goods such as\nsolvents, polyvinyl chloride, and pharmaceuticals. There are\na few natural sources of POPs, but most POPs are created by humans in industrial\nprocesses, either intentionally or as byproducts.\n","linknr":348,"url":"Persistent_organic_pollutant","recorded":1362512272,"links":36,"instances":["biophysical","chemistry","meteorology"],"pdf":["http://www.chem.unep.ch/pops/ritter/en/ritteren.pdf","http://www.chem.unep.ch/pops/ritter/en/ritteren.pdf","http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2010/9789241501101_eng.pdf"],"categories":["Pollutants","Biodegradable waste management","Environmental effects of pesticides"],"headings":["Compounds","Chemical properties","Long-range transport","Health effects","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8d/Map_of_Stockholm_Convention_on_Persistent_Organic_Pollutants.svg/275px-Map_of_Stockholm_Convention_on_Persistent_Organic_Pollutants.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/Hazardous-pesticide.jpg/140px-Hazardous-pesticide.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["environment","biophysical"],["volatility","chemistry"],["environment","biophysical"],["precipitation","meteorology"]],"members":["environment","volatility","precipitation"],"related":["Environmental_degradation","Chemical_decomposition","Biodegradation","Photolysis","Environment_(biophysical)","Bioaccumulate","Biological_tissue","Biomagnification","Food_chain","Human_health","Pesticide","Solvent","Polyvinyl_chloride","Pharmaceutical","United_Nations_Environment_Programme","Aldrin","Chlordane","DDT","Dieldrin","Endrin","Heptachlor","Hexachlorobenzene","Mirex","Polychlorinated_biphenyls","Polychlorinated_dibenzodioxins","Dibenzofuran","Toxaphene","Carcinogen","Polycyclic_aromatic_hydrocarbons","Brominated_flame-retardant","Organometallic_compound","Tributyltin","Solubility","Volatility_(chemistry)","Molecular_mass","Environment_(biophysical)","Halogenated","Chlorine","Lipid_bilayer","Bioaccumulation","Fatty_tissue","Atmospheric_particulate_matter","Food_web","Atmosphere","Antarctica","Polychlorinated_biphenyl","Precipitation_(meteorology)","Endocrine_system","Reproductive_system","Immune_system","Cancer","Breast_cancer","Bioavailability","Blood_serum","Diabetes","DDT","Dioxins_and_dioxin-like_compounds","Polychlorinated_biphenyl","Chlordane","Insulin_resistance","Animal_fat","Obesity","United_States_Department_of_Veterans_Affairs","Diabetes_mellitus_type_2","Agent_Orange","2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzodioxin","Vietnam_War","Aarhus_Protocol_on_Persistent_Organic_Pollutants","Center_for_International_Environmental_Law","International_POPs_Elimination_Network","Silent_Spring","Stockholm_Convention_on_Persistent_Organic_Pollutants","Environmental_Persistent_Pharmaceutical_Pollutant","Polychlorinated_biphenyl"]}
