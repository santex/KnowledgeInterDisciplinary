{"cursor":"25512","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Pellet fuels' are heating fuels made from compressed biomass. 'Wood pellets'\nare the most common type. A form of wood fuel, wood pellets are generally made\nfrom compacted sawdust or other wastes from sawmilling and other wood products\nmanufacture, . Other woody biomass sources include palm kernel shell,\ncoconut shell, and whole-tree removal or tree tops and branches leftover after\nlogging and which otherwise help replenish soil nutrients. As well\ngrasses can also be pelletized, creating 'grass pellets'. Pellets are\nmanufactured in several types and grades as fuels for electric power plants,\nhomes, and other applications in between. Pellets are\nextremely dense and can be produced with a low moisture content (below 10%) that\nallows them to be burned with a very high combustion efficiency.\n\nFurther, their regular geometry and small size allow automatic feeding with very\nfine calibration. They can be fed to a burner by auger feeding or by pneumatic\nconveying. Their high density also permits compact storage and rational\ntransport over long distance. They can be conveniently blown from a tanker to a\nstorage bunker or silo on a customer's premises.\n\nA broad range of pellet stoves, central heating furnaces, and other heating\nappliances have been developed and marketed since 1993. With the surge in the\nprice of fossil fuels since 2005, the demand for pellet heating has increased in\nEurope and North America, and a sizable industry is emerging. According to the\nInternational Energy Agency Task 40, wood pellet production has more than\ndoubled between 2006 and 2010 to over 14 million tons. In a 2012 report, the Biomass Energy Resource Center\nsays that it expects wood pellet production in North America to double again in\nthe next five years.\n","linknr":592,"url":"Pellet_fuel","recorded":1362500126,"links":72,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.eubia.org/uploads/media/VTT_Eija_Alakangas-_01.pdf","http://www.eubia.org/uploads/media/VTT_Eija_Alakangas-_01.pdf","http://www.manomet.org/sites/manomet.org/files/Manomet_Biomass_Report_Full_LoRez.pdf","http://www.bioenergytrade.org/downloads/t40-global-wood-pellet-market-study_final.pdf","http://www.bioenergytrade.org/downloads/t40-global-wood-pellet-market-study_final.pdf","http://www.biomasscenter.org/images/stories/2012prez_frederick.pdf","http://www.biomasscenter.org/images/stories/2012prez_frederick.pdf","http://bioenergy.illinois.edu/news/biomass/06Fuller_cpm.pdf","http://bioenergy.illinois.edu/news/biomass/06Fuller_cpm.pdf","http://fwci.com/publications/tech_papers/files/TP_CFB_08_05.pdf","http://www.forgreenheat.org/blog/An%20environmental%20impact%20assessment%20of%20exported%20wood%20pellets%20from%20Canada%20to%20Europe.pdf","http://www.biomasscenter.org/images/stories/2012prez_sherman.pdf","http://www.biomasscenter.org/images/stories/2012prez_sherman.pdf","http://www.biomasscenter.org/images/stories/2012prez_bissex.pdf","http://www.biomasscenter.org/images/stories/2012prez_bissex.pdf","http://www.biomasscenter.org/images/stories/BERC_2010_annual_report.pdf","http://www.biomasscenter.org/images/stories/BERC_2010_annual_report.pdf","http://www.catf.us/resources/whitepapers/files/201007-Review_of_the_Manomet_Biomass_Sustainability_and_Carbon_Policy_Study.pdf","http://www.futuremetrics.net/papers/Manomet%20Got%20it%20Backwards.pdf","http://www.futuremetrics.net/papers/Response%20to%20Manomet%20Comments.pdf","http://sustainability.williams.edu/files/2011/02/BillMoomaw-Biomass.pdf","http://www.dovetailinc.org/files/DovetailLCABioenergy0711.pdf","http://wilderness.org/files/BIOENERGY-COMMUNITY-BIOMASS-DEFINITION-PRINCIPLES.pdf","http://www.fpl.fs.fed.us/documnts/fplrp/fpl_rp656.pdf","http://thewoodcoaladvocacycouncil.com/images/stories/Development_European_Pellets_Market.pdf","http://www.erec-renewables.org/fileadmin/erec_docs/Projcet_Documents/RESTMAC/Pellets_small_scale_heat.pdf","http://www.eeca.govt.nz/eeca-library/renewable-energy/bioenergy/report/new-bioenergy-options-for-nz-04.pdf","http://www.eeca.govt.nz/eeca-library/renewable-energy/bioenergy/report/new-bioenergy-options-for-nz-04.pdf","http://www.ces.purdue.edu/extmedia/FNR/FNR-254.pdf","http://www.ces.purdue.edu/extmedia/FNR/FNR-254.pdf"],"categories":["Wood fuel"],"headings":["Production","Pellet stove operation","Energy output and efficiency","Air pollution emissions","Global warming","Sustainability","Cost","Usage by region","Other uses","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0c/Pellets_hand.jpg/220px-Pellets_hand.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wood-pellet_heater.jpg/220px-Wood-pellet_heater.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Sugarcane_field.jpg/120px-Sugarcane_field.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/12px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Wood_fuel","Sawdust","Sawmill","Palm_kernel","Coconut","Grasses","Pellet_stove","Fossil_fuel","International_Energy_Agency","Task_40","Hammer_mill","Wood_pellet_press","Lignin","Distillers_grains","Vancouver","Stockholm","DIN_51731","Melamine_resin","United_States","Pellet_Fuels_Institute","Coal","Pellet_baskets","Energy","MWh","Tonne","Pellet_stove","Boiler","Hydronic","Nitrogen_oxide","Sulfur_dioxide","Volatile_organic_compound","Atmospheric_particulate_matter","Pellet_stove","PM2.5","Natural_gas","Biogas","Electrostatic_precipitator","Cyclonic_separation","Baghouse","Manomet_Center_for_Conservation_Sciences","Sweden","Italy","Germany","Austria","Denmark","Finland","Pellet_stoves","New_Zealand","Solid_fuel","Renewable_heat","Pellet_mill","Pellet_stove","Woodchips","Firelog","Biochar"]}
