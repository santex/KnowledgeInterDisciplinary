Their name comes\nfrom the Greek phagein, \"to eat\" or \"devour\", and \"-cyte\", the suffix in biology\ndenoting \"cell\", from the Greek kutos, \"hollow vessel\". They\nare essential for fighting infections and for subsequent immunity. Phagocytes are important throughout the animal kingdom and are highly developed within vertebrates.\nOne litre of human blood contains about six billion white blood cells  (a type of phagocyte). Phagocytes were first discovered in 1882 by\nIlya Ilyich Mechnikov while he was studying starfish larvae.

Mechnikov was awarded the 1908 Nobel Prize in Physiology\nor Medicine for his discovery. Phagocytes occur in many\nspecies; some amoebae behave like macrophage phagocytes, which suggests that\nphagocytes appeared early in the evolution of life. Janeway, Chapter: [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?h-\nighlight=phagocytes,evolution&rid=imm.section.2367#2368 Evolution of the innate\nimmune system.] retrieved on March 20, 2009\n\nPhagocytes of humans and other animals are called \"professional\" or \"non-\nprofessional\" depending on how effective they are at phagocytosis. The professional phagocytes include cells called\nneutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, and mast cells. and  The main difference between professional and non-\nprofessional phagocytes is that the professional phagocytes have molecules\ncalled receptors on their surfaces that can detect harmful objects, such as\nbacteria, that are not normally found in the body.\nPhagocytes are crucial in fighting infections, as well as in maintaining healthy\ntissues by removing dead and dying cells that have reached the end of their\nlifespan.\n\nDuring an infection, chemical signals attract phagocytes to places where the\npathogen has invaded the body. These chemicals may come from bacteria or from\nother phagocytes already present. The phagocytes move by a method called\nchemotaxis. When phagocytes come into contact with bacteria, the receptors on\nthe phagocyte's surface will bind to them. This binding will lead to the\nengulfing of the bacteria by the phagocyte. Some phagocytes\nkill the ingested pathogen with oxidants and nitric oxide. After phagocytosis, macrophages and dendritic cells can\nalso participate in antigen presentation, a process in which a phagocyte moves\nparts of the ingested material back to its surface. This material is then\ndisplayed to other cells of the immune system. Some phagocytes then travel to\nthe body's lymph nodes and display the material to white blood cells called\nlymphocytes. This process is important in building immunity.

evade attacks by phagocytes.\n","linknr":1451,"url":"Phagocytes","recorded":1362568081,"links":65,"instances":["blood_vessel","bacteriology","anatomy","cell_biology","gene","biochemistry","streptococcus","medical","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Leukocytes"],"headings":["History","Phagocytosis","Methods
