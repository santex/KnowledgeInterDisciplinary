{"cursor":"17862","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n, Poland]] A 'pond' is a body of standing water, either natural or man-made,\nthat is usually smaller than a lake. They may arise naturally in floodplains as\npart of a river system, or they may be somewhat isolated depressions (examples\ninclude vernal pools and prairie potholes). Usually they contain shallow water\nwith marsh and aquatic plants and animals. A few animals also make\nponds, including both alligators and beavers. The type of life in a pond is\ngenerally determined by a combination of factors including water level regime\n(particularly depth and duration of flooding) and nutrient levels, but other\nfactors may also be important, including presence or absence of shading by\ntrees, presence or absence of streams, effects of grazing animals, and\nsalinity.\n\nHumans also make ponds. A wide variety of man-made bodies of water are\nclassified as ponds. Some ponds are created specifically for habitat\nrestoration, including water treatment. Others, like water gardens, water\nfeatures and koi ponds are designed for aesthetic ornamentation as landscape or\narchitectural features. Fish ponds are designed for commercial fish breeding,\nand solar ponds designed to store thermal energy.\n\nStanding bodies of water such as puddles, ponds, and lakes are often categorized\nseparately from flowing water courses, such as a brook, creek, stream or river.\n","linknr":571,"url":"Pond","recorded":1362500451,"links":71,"instances":["newton","india","geology"],"pdf":["http://www.geog.cam.ac.uk/research/projects/flobar2/reports/final/flobar2.pdf","http://www.on.ec.gc.ca/wildlife/docs/pdf/habitatframework-e.pdf"],"categories":["Fluvial landforms","Habitats","Ponds|","Bodies of water"],"headings":["Technical definitions","Formation","Characteristics","Conservation and management","Nomenclature","Uses","Examples","See also","References","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/Staw_naturalny.JPG/360px-Staw_naturalny.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cc/Lily_Pond_at_the_Lake_Palace%2C_Udaipur.jpg/220px-Lily_Pond_at_the_Lake_Palace%2C_Udaipur.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/Claude_Monet_-_Water_Lilies_-_1906%2C_Ryerson.jpg/220px-Claude_Monet_-_Water_Lilies_-_1906%2C_Ryerson.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b1/Niagara_Falls_Garden_2005.JPG/220px-Niagara_Falls_Garden_2005.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/1c/Winter_December_2007_with_Pond.jpg/220px-Winter_December_2007_with_Pond.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Sacred_lotus_Nelumbo_nucifera.jpg/160px-Sacred_lotus_Nelumbo_nucifera.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/Estuary-mouth.jpg/140px-Estuary-mouth.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/Maldivesfish2.jpg/140px-Maldivesfish2.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["crystal_lake","newton"],["depression","geology"],["punjab","india"]],"members":["crystal_lake","punjab","depression"],"related":["Poland","Body_of_water","Water_stagnation","Lake","Water_garden","Fish_pond","Solar_pond","Puddle","Udaipur","India","Limnology","Hydrobiology","Ramsar_Convention","Hectare","Acre","Walden_Pond","Concord,_Massachusetts","Middlesex_Fells_Reservation","Crystal_Lake_(Newton)","Depression_(geology)","Amazon_River","Glacier","Prairie_pothole","Amphibian","Beaver","Alligator","Serial_imagery","Water_Lilies","Wetland","Vernal_pond","Mississippi_Gopher_Frog","Waterfall","Stew_pond","Mill_pond","English_language","United_States","Minnesota","Surface_runoff","Scotland","Loch","Playas","Hindu","Medieval","Europe","Monastery","Castle","Fish_pond","East_Asia","Japan","Koi","Treatment_pond","Reservoir","Punjabi_language","Punjab_(India)","Bovinae","Village","Human_swimming","Antonelli_Pond","California","USA","Big_Pond,_Nova_Scotia","Bullough's_Pond","Massachusetts","USA","Christian_Pond","Wyoming","USA","Hampstead_Ponds","England","Milicz_Ponds","Poland","Oguni-numa_Pond","Japan","Pete's_Pond","Botswana","Ro≈æmberk_Pond","Czech_Republic","Walden_Pond","Henry_David_Thoreau","Cypress_dome"]}
