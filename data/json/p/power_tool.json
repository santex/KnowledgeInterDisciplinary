      "text" : "\n\n\nA 'power tool' is a tool that is actuated by an additional power source and\nmechanism other than the solely manual labour used with hand tools. The most\ncommon types of power tools use electric motors. Internal combustion engines and\ncompressed air are also commonly used. Other power sources include steam\nengines, direct burning of fuels and propellants,<ref>e.g. in powder-actuated\ntools</ref> or even natural power sources like wind or moving water. Tools\ndirectly driven by animal power are not generally considered power tools.\n\nPower tools are used in industry, in construction, in the garden, for housework\ntasks such as cooking, cleaning, and around the house for purposes of driving\n(fasteners), drilling, cutting, shaping, sanding, grinding, routing, polishing,\npainting, heating and more.\n\nPower tools are classified as either stationary or portable, where portable\nmeans hand-held. Portable power tools have obvious advantages in mobility.\nStationary power tools however often have advantages in speed and\naccuracy,<ref>A typical table saw for instance not only cuts faster than a\nregular hand saw, but the cuts are smoother, straighter and more square than\nwhat is normally achievable with a hand-held power saw.</ref> and some\nstationary power tools can produce objects that cannot be made in any other\nway.<ref>e.g. lathes produce truly round objects</ref> Stationary power tools\nfor metalworking are usually called [[machine tools]]. The term machine tool is\nnot usually applied to stationary power tools for woodworking, although such\nusage is occasionally heard, and in some cases, such as drill presses and bench\ngrinders, exactly the same tool is used for both woodworking and metalworking.\n\nThe term power tool is also sometimes used as a buzzword, meaning a technique\nfor greatly simplifying a complex or difficult task.\n",
