Of the world's 20 largest companies, 15 are state-owned companies.]] , 2009.]]\n  The 'petroleum industry' includes the global processes of exploration,\n  extraction, refining, transporting (often by oil tankers and pipelines), and\n  marketing petroleum products. The largest volume products of the industry are\n  fuel oil and gasoline (petrol). Petroleum (oil) is also the raw material for\n  many chemical products, including pharmaceuticals, solvents, fertilizers,\n  pesticides, and plastics. The industry is usually divided into three major\n  components: upstream, midstream and downstream. Midstream operations are\n  usually included in the downstream category.\n\nPetroleum is vital to many industries, and is of importance to the maintenance\nof industrial civilization in its current configuration, and thus is a critical\nconcern for many nations. Oil accounts for a large percentage of the worldâs\nenergy consumption, ranging from as low of 32% for Europe and Asia, up to a high\nof 53% for the Middle East.\n\nOther geographic regionsâ consumption patterns are as follows: South and Central\nAmerica (44%), Africa (41%), and North America (40%). The world consumes 30\nbillion barrels (4.8 kmÂ³) of oil per year, with developed nations being the\nlargest consumers. The United States consumed 25% of the oil produced in\n2007. \"The World Factbook\". 'Country Comparison - Oil Consumption'. Found at\nhttps://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-\nfactbook/rankorder/2174rank.html The production, distribution, refining,\nand retailing of petroleum taken as a whole represents the world's largest\nindustry in terms of dollar value.\n\nGovernments such as the United States government provide a heavy public subsidy\nto petroleum companies, with major tax breaks at virtually every stage of oil\nexploration and extraction, including for the costs of oil field leases and\ndrilling equipment.
