The enzyme was discovered in 1974 in\nextracts of the fungus Engyodontium album (formerly Tritirachium album). Proteinase K is able to digest native keratin (hair), hence,\nthe name \"Proteinase K\". The predominant site of cleavage is the peptide bond\nadjacent to the carboxyl group of aliphatic and aromatic amino acids with\nblocked alpha amino groups. It is commonly used for its broad specificity. This\nenzyme belongs to Peptidase family S8. The molecular weight of Proteinase K is\n28,900 daltons (28.9 kDa).\n","linknr":190,"url":"Proteinase_K","recorded":1362484500,"links":18,"instances":["biochemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Biochemistry methods","EC 3.4.21"],"headings":["Enzyme activity","Applications","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/PDB_1pek_EBI.jpg/220px-PDB_1pek_EBI.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["denaturation","biochemistry"]],"members":["denaturation"],"related":["Serine_protease","Fungus","Keratin","Aliphatic","Aromatic","Amino_acids","EDTA","PH","Sodium_dodecyl_sulfate","Guanidinium_chloride","Guanidinium_thiocyanate","Urea","Trichloroacetic_acid","AEBSF","PMSF","Diisopropyl_fluorophosphate","Guanidinium_chloride","Guanidinium_thiocyanate","Urea","Sodium_lauroyl_sarcosinate","Triton_X-100","Polysorbate_20","Sodium_dodecyl_sulfate","Citrate","Iodoacetic_acid","EDTA","Polysorbate_20","Triton_X-100","Guanidinium_chloride","Polysorbate_20","Triton_X-100","Guanidinium_chloride","Sodium_lauroyl_sarcosinate","Polysorbate_20","Triton_X-100","Molecular_biology","Nucleic_acid","Nuclease","Denaturation_(biochemistry)","Sodium_dodecyl_sulfate","Urea","Chelating","EDTA","Sulfhydryl","Trypsin","Chymotrypsin","Peptide","Enzyme_inhibitor"]}
