In contrast to regular opinions, a per curiam does not list\nthe individual judge responsible for authoring the decision,\nbut minority dissenting and concurring decisions are signed. For examples,\nsee Bobby v. Van Hook and Michigan v. Fisher\n\nPer curiams are not the only type of decision that can reflect the opinion of\nthe court. Other types of decisions can also reflect the opinion of the entire\ncourt, such as unanimous decisions, in which the opinion of the court is\nexpressed with an author listed.
