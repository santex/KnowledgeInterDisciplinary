{"cursor":"4773","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nThe 'People's National Congress Party' is a political party in Papua New\nGuinea. Its former leader Bill Skate served as prime minister from 1997 to 1999\nand as speaker of Parliament from 2002 to 2004. Skate died in 2006 and the\nparty is now led by Peter OâNeill. PNC originated from the National Capital\nDistrict where former leader(late Bill Skate) was the Governor of NCD and the\nParliamentary Member.\n\nAt the National General elections, 15-29 June 2002, the party won 2 of 109\nseats. At the 2007 election, the party won 4 seats. It became a member of the\ncoalition government led by Michael Somareâs National Alliance, and received\ntwo cabinet positions. [http://www.pacificmagazine.net/news/2007/08/30/temu-is-pngs-new-deputy-\nprime-minister]\n\nFollowing that on or about August 2 2011, nine years after holding power and\nruling PNG the National Alliance coalition government led by Sir Micheal Thomas\nSomare was toppled by the PNC Party led, Peter O'Neill coalition with Belden\nNamah PNG Party Leader, and Parliament Speaker Jeffery Nape, who master minded\nan unprecedented move and called for the sacking of the Prime Minister Sir\nMicheal Somare and the re-election of a new Prime Minister. Peter O'Neill was\nthereafter elected Prime Minister on technicalities of the PNG Constitution.\nThis resulted in a political impasse between the O'Neill-Namah Led coalition\nmajority and the Somare led-minority. The nation underwent some very trying\nmoments and held its breath as one crisis after another unfolded and continued\ninfighting and political maneuvering and countless court actions piled up\nagainst the two political groups. The police force was divided, and the defense\nforce was divided and there was an event of a possible military coup and mutiny,\nfollowed by a police mutiny and public demonstrations funded by the various\ninterest parties, while all along the clock ticked to a count down to the\nlooming National General Elections for 2012. The Party won 27 seats and was\ninvited by the Governor General through its Public Officer(Secretary General)\nJonathan. O'ata on August 1st 2012, to form Government, hence the 9th Parliament\nwas formed and Peter O'Neill was once again elected Prime Minister proper\nthrough the mastering of more candidates and been the largest political party\nwith more members to win the national general elections of 2012. PNC Party\nhowever in the 9th Parliament did not assume its relations with the PNG Party\nled by Belden Namaha and was forced to consolidate its numbers with its\npolitical rivals who were none other than the National Alliance led by Sir\nMicheal Somare, the Peoples Progress Party, led by Sir Julius Chan, former Prime\nMinister, the Peoples Democratic Movement, led by former Prime Minister Pius\nWingti. The Opposition of the 9th Parliament is now led by Belden Namah and 11\nMPs. (Citations for the above can be viewed in the two dailies, Post Couriers\nand the National Newspapers from and in between the periods of August 2011, June\n2012, as the two dailies continuously reported on a daily basis on the latest\ndevelopments regarding the political impasse).\n\nPNC post elections- August 2012, National general Elections.\n\nPNC Party Led by Party Leader, Peter.O'Neill and Deputy Party Leader Job.Pomat\nManus Open MP, fared very well in the National General Elections with its Free\nEducation and Free Health Policy platform and won 25 seats nationwide. In the\n9th Parliament PNC holds 12 Ministries as well as the Deputy Speaker position\nand the Prime Minister post, held by Peter O'Neill the PNC Party\nLeader.Unfortunately for Job Pomat he lost his Manus Open seat to another\ncontender, and was subsequently replaced as Deputy Party Leader by Mao Zeming MP\nfor Tewa Siassi Open.\n\nPNC Pre-Election Part Officials and Executives included, Simon Korua(President),\nGarret Kising(Vice President), and Jonathan. O'ata(Secretary General), all were\nelected in the PNC National Congress held in Goroka Late February 2012 and early\nApril 2012, which was fully attended by many interested public participants and\nformally registered members numbering close to (5) Five Thousand people. The\ncurrent Registrar of Political Parties Dr Gelu was present and accompanied by Dr\nDavid Kavanamur (Advisor and former Chairman of Government Task Force)among the\nmany dignitaries that accompanied the PNG Party Leader Hon Peter O'Neill, who\nwas then widely recognized as the Prime Minister of Papua New
