Organisms that cause infectious disease include fungi,\noomycetes, bacteria, viruses, viroids, virus-like organisms, phytoplasmas,\nprotozoa, nematodes and parasitic plants. Not included are ectoparasites like\ninsects, mites, vertebrate, or other pests that affect plant health by\nconsumption of plant tissues. Plant pathology also involves the study of\npathogen identification, disease etiology, disease cycles, economic impact,\nplant disease epidemiology, plant disease resistance, how plant diseases affect\nhumans and animals, pathosystem genetics, and management of plant diseases.\n","linknr":470,"url":"Plant_pathology","recorded":1362505704,"links":62,"instances":["botany","biology","epidemiology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Phytopathology|","Plant pathogens and diseases|*","Agronomy","Pathology"],"headings":["Common pathogenic infection methods","''Plant pathogens''","Physiological plant disorders","Epidemiology","Disease resistance","Management","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ad/Black_rot_lifecycle.tif/lossy-page1-220px-Black_rot_lifecycle.tif.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/07/Powdery_mildew.JPG/220px-Powdery_mildew.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ae/Rice_blast.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9e/Agrobacteriumgall.jpg/220px-Agrobacteriumgall.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/87/Vitis_vinifera_phytoplasma.jpg/220px-Vitis_vinifera_phytoplasma.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/26/Tobacco_mosaic_virus_symptoms_tobacco.jpg/220px-Tobacco_mosaic_virus_symptoms_tobacco.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e0/Nematode_nodules.jpg/200px-Nematode_nodules.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c2/Tobacco_mosaic_virus_symptoms_orchid.jpg/224px-Tobacco_mosaic_virus_symptoms_orchid.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/Maler_der_Grabkammer_des_Sennudem_001.jpg/160px-Maler_der_Grabkammer_des_Sennudem_001.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["race","biology"],["vector","epidemiology"],["stunt","botany"]],"members":["stunt","race","vector"],"related":["Plant","Pathogens","Fungi","Oomycetes","Bacteria","Viruses","Viroids","Phytoplasmas","Protozoa","Nematodes","Parasitic_plants","Insects","Mites","Vertebrate","Plant_defense_against_herbivory","Plant_disease_epidemiology","Plant_disease_resistance","Cell_wall","Type_three_secretion_system","Ascomycetes","Basidiomycetes","Sexual_reproduction","Asexual_reproduction","Spores","Saprotroph","Soil","Fungicides","Race_(biology)","Evolution","Oomycetes","Genus","Phytophthora_infestans","Sudden_oak_death","Root_rot","Great_Irish_Famine","Bacterial_Plant_Pathogen","Bacteria","Saprotrophic","Sub-tropical","Tropical","Soft_rot","Auxin","Xylem","Pathogenicity_factors","Quorum_sensing","Burkholderia","Proteobacteria","Pseudomonas_tomato","Mycoplasmas","Mollicutes","Genomes","Insects","Phloem","Plant_virus","Asymptomatic","Crop_yield","Perennial_plant","RNA","Genome","RNA","DNA","Proteins","Replicase","Movement_protein","Plasmodesmata","Vector_(epidemiology)","Insect","Aphid","Fungi","Nematodes","Protozoa","Beet_leafhopper","Curly_top","Nematodes","Root","Tropical","Subtropical","Crops","Protozoa","Zoospores","Viruses","Root_hair","Root","Mistletoe","Cuscuta","Drought","Frost","Snow","Hail","Flood","Nutrient","Sodium_chloride","Gypsum","Wind","Hurricane","Tornado","Lightning","Wildfire","Soil","Pollution","Sodium_chloride","Herbicide","Vandalism","The_Australian_Quarantine_and_Inspection_Service","Pesticide_application","Crop_rotation","Australasian_Plant_Pathology_Society","American_Phytopathological_Society","British_Society_for_Plant_Pathology","Burl","Common_names_of_plant_diseases","Disease_resistance_in_fruit_and_vegetables","Forest_pathology","Fungicide","Gene-for-gene_relationship","Global_Plant_Clinic","Glossary_of_phytopathology","Herbivory","Inducible_plant_defenses_against_herbivory","International_Society_for_Plant_Pathology","List_of_phytopathology_journals","Microbial_inoculant","Mycology","Pesticide","Plant_defense_against_herbivory","Plant_disease_forecasting","QoI","Phytoplasma","Strobilurin","Stunt_(botany)"]}
