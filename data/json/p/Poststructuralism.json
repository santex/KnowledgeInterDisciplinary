A major theme of poststructuralism is instability in the\nhuman sciences, due to the complexity of humans themselves and the impossibility\nof fully escaping structures in order to study them.\n\nPost-structuralism is a response to structuralism. Structuralism is an\nintellectual movement developed in Europe from the early to mid-20th century. It\nargued that human culture may be understood by means of a structureâmodeled on\nlanguage (i.e., structural linguistics)âthat differs from concrete reality and\nfrom abstract ideasâa \"third order\" that mediates between the two.

Los Angeles and New York: Semiotext(e), 2004. 170-192. ISBN\n1-58435-018-0. p.171-173. Post-structuralist authors all present different\ncritiques of structuralism, but common themes include the rejection of the self-\nsufficiency of the structures that structuralism posits and an interrogation of\nthe binary oppositions that constitute those structures. Craig, Edward, ed.\n1998. Routledge Encyclopaedia of Philosophy. Vol. 7 (Nihilism to Quantum\nmechanics). London and New York: Routledge. ISBN 0-415-18712-5. p.597.\nWriters whose work is often characterised as post-structuralist include Jacques\nDerrida, Michel Foucault, Gilles Deleuze, Judith Butler, Jacques Lacan, and\nJulia Kristeva.\n\nThe movement is closely related to postmodernism. As with structuralism,\nantihumanism is often a central tenet. Existential phenomenology is a\nsignificant influence; Colin Davis has argued that post-structuralists might\njust as accurately be called \"post-phenomenologists\". Davis, Colin;\n\"Levinas: An Introduction\"; p8; 2006; Continuum, London. Some commentators\nhave criticized poststructuralism for being radically relativistic or\nnihilistic; others have objected to its extremity and linguistic complexity.\nOthers see it as a threat to traditional values or professional scholarly\nstandards. Many theorists who have been called \"post-structuralist\" have\nrejected the label. Harrison, Paul; 2006; \"Post-structuralist Theories\"; pp122-\n135 in Aitken, S. and Valentine, G.
