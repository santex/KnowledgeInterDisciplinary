{"cursor":"17429","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n near Deer Lodge, Montana.]]\n\nA 'ranch' is an area of landscape, including various structures, given primarily\nto the practice of 'ranching', the practice of raising grazing livestock such as\ncattle or sheep for meat or wool. The word most often applies to livestock-\nraising operations in the western United States and Canada, though there are\nranches in other areas. People who own or operate a ranch are called 'ranchers',\nor 'stockgrowers'. Ranching is also a method used to raise less common livestock\nsuch as elk, American bison or even ostrich, emu, and alpacas.\n\nRanches generally consist of large areas, but may be of nearly any size. In the\nwestern United States, many ranches are a combination of privately owned land\nsupplemented by grazing leases on land under the control of the federal Bureau\nof Land Management. If the ranch includes arable or irrigated land, the ranch\nmay also engage in a limited amount of farming, raising crops for feeding the\nanimals, such as hay and feed grains.\n\nRanches that cater exclusively to tourists are called guest ranches or,\ncolloquially, \"dude ranches.\" Most working ranches do not cater to guests,\nthough they may allow private hunters or outfitters onto their property to hunt\nnative wildlife. However, in recent years, a few struggling smaller operations\nhave added some dude ranch features, such as horseback rides, cattle drives or\nguided hunting, in an attempt to bring in additional income. Ranching is part of\nthe iconography of the \"Wild West\" as seen in Western movies and rodeos.\n","linknr":328,"url":"Ranching","recorded":1362501642,"links":38,"instances":["trainee","province","new_zealand_agriculture","profession","buildings","australia"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Cowboy culture","Livestock","Ranches|"],"headings":["Ranch occupations","Origins of ranching","History in North America","Ranching in South America","Ranches outside the Americas","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c5/Grant-Kohrs_Ranch.jpg/350px-Grant-Kohrs_Ranch.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/28/RanchOklahoma.ws.jpg/700px-RanchOklahoma.ws.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e6/Colorado._Round_up_on_the_Cimarron.jpg/200px-Colorado._Round_up_on_the_Cimarron.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/99/Chinook2.gif/200px-Chinook2.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f2/Dehesa_Boyal._Bollullos_Par_del_Condado_%28Huelva%29.jpg/200px-Dehesa_Boyal._Bollullos_Par_del_Condado_%28Huelva%29.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["wrangler","profession"],["salamanca","province"],["station","australian_agriculture"],["stockman","australia"],["jackaroo","trainee"],["station","new_zealand_agriculture"],["homestead","buildings"]],"members":["jackaroo","salamanca","station","wrangler","homestead","stockman"],"related":["Deer_Lodge","Montana","Landscape","Grazing","Livestock","Cattle","Sheep","United_States","Canada","Livestock","Elk","American_bison","Ostrich","Emu","Alpaca","Bureau_of_Land_Management","Arable_land","Farm","Hay","Guest_ranch","Colloquialism","Hunter","Outfitter","Iconography","Western_movies","Rodeo","Wrangler_(profession)","Cowboy","Spain","Reconquista","Spanish_nobility","Military_order","Kingdom_of_Castile","Reconquista","Mesta","Castilla-La_Mancha","Extremadura","Andalusia","Conquistador","Americas","Cattle","Hacienda","Jalisco","Salamanca_(province)","Cowboy","Cimarron,_Colorado","United_States","Europe","Vaquero","Deep_Hollow_Ranch","New_York_City","Montauk,_New_York","Native_Americans_in_the_United_States","American_Revolution","Prairie","Desert","Mexico","United_States","Open_range","American_bison","Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas","Livestock_branding","Texas","American_Civil_War","Farm","Homestead_Act","Farm","Barbed_wire","Great_Plains","Agriculture","Overgrazing","Tragedy_of_the_commons","Public_lands","American_bison","Hawaii","George_Vancouver","Pai`ea_Kamehameha","Ox","Kamehameha_II","Kamehameha_III","California","Mexico","Cowboy","Native_Hawaiians","Hawaiianize","Argentina","Estancias","Brazil","Fazendas","South_America","Ecuador","Colombia","Hacienda","Latin_America","Pampas","South_America","Minas_Gerais","Semi-arid_Pampas","Argentina","Gaucho","Argentina","Brazil","Uruguay","Pantanal","Brazil","Deforestation","Rain_forest","Slash_and_burn","Indigenous_peoples","Bullfighting","British_Isles","Cattle","Medieval","Cattle","Bocage","United_Kingdom","Europe","Australia","Station_(Australian_agriculture)","Cattle_station","Sheep_station","Rangeland","Outback","Stockman_(Australia)","Jackaroo_(trainee)","Cowboy","Anna_Creek_station","Sidney_Kidman","New_Zealand","Station_(New_Zealand_agriculture)","Animal_husbandry","Cowboy","Farm","Guest_ranch","Homestead_(buildings)","Horse","Hunting","List_of_Ranches_and_Stations","Movie_ranch","Pastoralism","Ranch-style_house","Rangeland","Judy_Blunt","George_F._Ellis","National_Park_Service"]}
