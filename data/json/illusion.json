Though illusions distort reality,\nthey are generally shared by most people.<ref>Solso, R. L. (2001). Cognitive\npsychology (6th ed.). Boston: Allyn and Bacon. ISBN 0-205-30937-2</ref>\nIllusions may occur with any of the human senses, but visual illusions (optical\nillusions), are the most well- known and understood. The emphasis on visual\nillusions occurs because vision often dominates the other senses. For example,\nindividuals watching a ventriloquist will perceive the voice is coming from the\ndummy since they are able to see the dummy mouth the words.<ref>McGurk,Hj. &\nMacDonald, J.(1976). \"Hearing lips and seeing voices\", Nature 264, 746-\n748.</ref> Some illusions are based on general assumptions the brain makes\nduring perception. These assumptions are made using organizational principles\n(e.g., Gestalt theory), an individual's capacity for depth perception and motion\nperception, and perceptual constancy. Other illusions occur because of\nbiological sensory structures within the human body or conditions outside of the\nbody within oneâ€™s physical environment.\n\nThe term illusion refers to a specific form of sensory distortion. Unlike a\nhallucination, which is a distortion in the absence of a stimulus, an illusion\ndescribes a misinterpretation of a true sensation. For example, hearing voices\nregardless of the environment would be a hallucination, whereas hearing voices\nin the sound of running water (or other auditory source) would be an illusion.\n\nMimes are known for a repertoire of illusions that are created by physical\nmeans. The mime artist creates an illusion of acting upon or being acted upon by\nan unseen object. These illusions exploit the audience's assumptions about the\nphysical world. Well-known examples include \"walls\", \"climbing stairs\",\n\"leaning\", \"descending ladders\", and \"pulling and pushing\".\n",
