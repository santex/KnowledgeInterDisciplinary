The remit of the Committee is to examine the\nexpenditure, administration and policy of the Department for Education and any\nassociated public bodies.\n\nThe Children, Schools and Families Select Committee was formed after the\nDepartment for Children, Schools and Families was set up on 6 November 2007. The\nnew department was formed after the disbanding of the former Department for\nEducation and Skills. It works in close collaboration with the Department for\nInnovation, Universities and Skills. It was renamed after the Department was\nrenamed the Department for Education without any change in ministerial\nresponsibilities. The current Secretary of State for Education is The Rt Hon.\nMichael Gove MP.\n","linknr":244,"url":"Education_Select_Committee","recorded":1375067214,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Education_Select_Committee&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Education_Select_Committee&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Select_Committee_(Westminster_System)","/wiki/British_House_of_Commons","/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Department_for_Education_(United_Kingdom)","/wiki/Department_for_Innovation,_Universities_and_Skills","/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_Education","/wiki/The_Right_Honourable","/wiki/Michael_Gove","/wiki/Member_of_Parliament","#Membership","#Changes","#See_also","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Education_Select_Committee&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Graham_Stuart_(UK_politician)","/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)","/wiki/Beverley_and_Holderness_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Neil_Carmichael_(Conservative_politician)","/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)","/wiki/Stroud_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Alex_Cunningham","/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)","/wiki/Stockton_North_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Bill_Esterson","/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)","/wiki/Sefton_Central_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Pat_Glass","/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)","/wiki/North_West_Durham_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Charlotte_Leslie","/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)","/wiki/Bristol_North_West_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Siobhain_McDonagh","/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)","/wiki/Mitcham_and_Morden_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Ian_Mearns","/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)","/wiki/Gateshead_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Chris_Skidmore","/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)","/wiki/Kingswood_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/David_Ward_(politician)","/wiki/Liberal_Democrats","/wiki/Bradford_East_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Craig_Whittaker","/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)","/wiki/Calder_Valley_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/education-committee/membership/","/w/index.php?title=Education_Select_Committee&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Committee_of_Selection_(House_of_Commons)","/wiki/Conor_Burns","/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)","/wiki/Bournemouth_West_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Neil_Carmichael_(Conservative_politician)","/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)","/wiki/Stroud_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm101102/debtext/101102-0004.htm#1011036000005","/wiki/Liz_Kendall","/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)","/wiki/Leicester_West_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Bill_Esterson","/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)","/wiki/Sefton_Central_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Nic_Dakin","/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)","/wiki/Scunthorpe_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Alex_Cunningham","/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)","/wiki/Stockton_North_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm111107/debtext/111107-0004.htm#1111082000006","/wiki/Tessa_Munt","/wiki/Liberal_Democrats","/wiki/Wells_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/David_Ward_(politician)","/wiki/Liberal_Democrats","/wiki/Bradford_East_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120611/debtext/120611-0004.htm#12061130000007","/wiki/Lisa_Nandy","/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)","/wiki/Wigan_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Siobhain_McDonagh","/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)","/wiki/Mitcham_and_Morden_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120910/debtext/120910-0003.htm#12091035000004","/wiki/Damian_Hinds","/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)","/wiki/East_Hampshire_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Chris_Skidmore","/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)","/wiki/Kingswood_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121105/debtext/121105-0004.htm#12110555000004","/w/index.php?title=Education_Select_Committee&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/List_of_Committees_of_the_United_Kingdom_Parliament","/w/index.php?title=Education_Select_Committee&action=edit&section=4","http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/education-committee/","/wiki/Template:UKParliamentCom
