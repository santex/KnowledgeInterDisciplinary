{"cursor":"5723","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nOn a sword, the 'crossguard' (or cross-guard, also known as quillons a\nquillon is \"either of the two arms forming the cross-guard\" (OED). The term\narises in Middle French in the late 16th century, and is adopted in English only\nin the 19th century. ), is a bar of metal at right angles to the blade,\nplaced between the blade and the hilt. The crossguard develops in the European\nsword around the 10th century for the protection of the wielder's hand. The\nearliest forms are seen in late Viking swords, and it becomes a standard feature\nof the Norman sword of the 11th century and of the knightly arming sword\nthroughout the high and late medieval period. Early crossgards were straight\nmetal bars, sometimes tapering towards the outer ends. While this simple type\nwas never discontinued, more elaborate forms developed alongside it in the\ncourse of the Middle Ages. The crossguard could be waisted or bent in the 12th\nand 13th century. Beginning in the 13th or 14th century, swords were almost\nuniversally fitted with a so-called chappe or rain-guard, a piece of leather\nfitted to the crossguard. The purpose of this leather is not entirely clear, but\nit seems to have originated as a part of the scabbard, functioning as a lid when\nthe sword was in the scabbard. The rainguard presumably originated in the\n13th century but did not become universal until the 14th. Oakeshott (Archaeology\nof Weapons, 1960, p. 229) is aware of one preserved specimen of c. 1250. The\nmain problem in researching the development of this feature is the fact that it\nis lost to decomposition in all swords recovered archaeologically. Note that the\nterm \"rain-guard\" is modern, and reflects the hypothesis that the purpose was to\nprotect the sword in the scabbard. It is possible that the function of this\nfeature developed to offer added hand-protection to the wielder, or\nalternatively into a mostly decorative addition to the cross-guard. Oakeshott\n(1964) uses chappe, which may be the historical term, but which is ambiguous as\nit is merely a French word for \"cap\" and is also used for the part of the\nscabbard known in English as chape. But Oakeshott also embraces the \"rainguard\"\nhypothesis explicitly in his European weapons and armour: from the Renaissance\nto the industrial revolution (1980), where he talks about how the metal sheath-\ncovers of early modern swords are derived from the medieval chappe (\"A feature\nwhich many of these swords have is a solid sheath-cover made of metal attached\nto the underside of the hilt, ... to keep rain from reaching the blade, like the\nold 'chappe' or rainguard of previous centuries\", p. 135) In the 14th to\n15th century, many more elaborate forms were tried. A feature of such late\nmedieval forms is the cusp or Ã©cusson, a protrusion of the crossguard in the\ncenter where it is fitted on the blade. Also from the 14th century, the leather\nchappe is sometimes replaced with a metal sheet. An early example of this is a\nsword dated to c. 1320-40 kept at Glasgow Museum. A later example is the \"Monza\nsword\" of Estore Visconti (early 15th century), where the rain-guard is of\nsilver and decorated with a floral motif.\n\nAfter the end of the Middle Ages, swords evolved into lighter, faster duelling\nweapons, and the crossguard became more elaborate, forming first quillons and\nthen, through the addition of guard branches, the basket hilt, which offered\nmore protection to the fencer's hand.\n\nEwart Oakeshott in chapter 4 of his The Sword in the Age of Chivalry (1964)\nclassifies medieval cross-guards into twelve types:\n\n# a plain horizontal bar, tapering towards the end. This is the basic shape\n# found from the late Viking era through the 17th century. waisted type, popular\n# in the 15th century. a relatively short bar with rectancular cross-section.\n# Popular during 1150-1250 and again during 1380-1430. the terminals of the bar\n# are bent towards the blade. \"bow tie\" style with widened and flattened\n# terminals. a curved or bent variant of type 5. the bar has a flat cross-\n# section and is bent towards the blade; popular in the 14th century. bent\n# terminals as in style 4, but a more elaborate form with a hexagonal cross-\n# section of the part fitted around the tang and a pronounced Ã©cusson, popular\n# in the late medieval period. an elaborate late medieval type with the bar bent\n# towards the blade and a flat diamond or V shaped cross-section and a\n# pronounced Ã©cusson. the arms of the bar taper towards the hilt rather than\n# away from it; mostly also with a pronounced Ã©cusson. knobbed terminals, with\n# round or rectangular cross-section, popular during the 15th to 16th centuries\n# the bar curves strongly in the horizontal plane, forming an S-shape; this type\n# dates to the end of the medieval period and is transitional to the early\n# modern quillon types.\n\nThe medieval dagger in the 14th and 15th century also adopted a variant with\nquillons, styled after the hilt of a sword. Quillon-daggers remained popular in\nthe 16th century, after the sword type it resembled had fallen out of\nuse.
