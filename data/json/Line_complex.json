{"cursor":"1607","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In algebraic geometry, a 'line complex' is a 3-fold given by the intersection of\nthe Grassmannian G(2, 4) (embedded in projective space P 5 by\nPlÃ¼cker coordinates) with a hypersurface. It is called a line complex because\npoints of G(2, 4) correspond to lines in P 3, so a line complex\ncan be thought of as a 3-dimensional family of lines in P 3. The\n'linear line complex' and 'quadric line complex' are the cases when the\nhypersurface has degree 1 or 2; they are both rational varieties.\n","linknr":90,"url":"Line_complex","recorded":1362372531,"links":10,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Algebraic varieties","Threefolds"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Algebraic_geometry","Plücker_coordinates","Rational_varieties"]}
