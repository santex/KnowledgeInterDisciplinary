{"cursor":"3961","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Advance' (pronounced with the stress on the first syllable) is an\nunincorporated community located in Davie County, North Carolina. It has a total\nland area of and is located along NC 801 and US 158 just south of Bermuda Run\nnear the western bank of the Yadkin River. Advance is a part of the Piedmont\nTriad and is home to Shady Grove Elementary School. Neighboring communities and\nmunicipalities include: Bermuda Run, Mocksville, Hillsdale, and Yadkin College.\n\n\nName origin Various accounts exist for the origin of the town's name. Some\nsuggest the name was derived from the name of a popular resident and freed\nslave, Addington Vance. Other accounts suggest the community was named by\nresidents who hoped that with the addition of a post office, the community\nwould advance. Yet another possibility is that the town was named after the\nConfederate blockade steamer \"Advance\", which was commonly referred to as\nthe AD Vance.\n\n\nEncompassing Communities While Advance remains unincorporated, it is recognized\nby the US Postal Service under zip code 27006. The common area of Advance\nactually blankets several smaller unincorporated communities that are not\nrecognized by the postal service:\n\nBixby Cornatzer Farmington (south of Spillman Road) Fork Church Fulton Hillsdale\nShady Grove Smith Grove\n\n\n\nProgress The Advance population has grown at an accelerated pace within the past\n10 years, with Advance evolving from a rural community into a more suburban\nbedroom community of Clemmons and Winston-Salem.
