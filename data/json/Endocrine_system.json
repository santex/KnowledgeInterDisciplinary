{"cursor":"36492","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The 'endocrine system' is the system of glands, each of which secretes different\ntypes of hormones directly into the bloodstream (some of which are transported\nalong nerve tracts) to maintain homeostasis. The endocrine system is in contrast\nto the exocrine system, which secretes its chemicals using ducts. The word\nendocrine derives from the Greek words \"endo\" meaning inside, within, and\n\"crinis\" for secrete. The endocrine system is an information signal system like\nthe nervous system, yet its effects and mechanism are classifiably different.\nThe endocrine system's effects are slow to initiate, and prolonged in their\nresponse, lasting from a few hours up to weeks. The nervous system sends\ninformation very quickly, and responses are generally short lived. Hormones are\nsubstances (chemical mediators) released from endocrine tissue into the\nbloodstream where they travel to target tissue and generate a response. Hormones\nregulate various human functions, including metabolism, growth and development,\ntissue function, sleep, and mood. The field of study dealing with the endocrine\nsystem and its disorders is endocrinology, a branch of internal medicine.\n\nFeatures of endocrine glands are, in general, their ductless nature, their\nvascularity, and usually the presence of intracellular vacuoles or granules\nstoring their hormones. In contrast, exocrine glands, such as salivary glands,\nsweat glands, and glands within the gastrointestinal tract, tend to be much less\nvascular and have ducts or a hollow lumen.\n\nIn addition to the specialised endocrine organs mentioned above, many other\norgans that are part of other body systems, such as the kidney, liver, heart and\ngonads, have secondary endocrine functions. For example the kidney secretes\nendocrine hormones such as erythropoietin and renin.\n\nThe endocrine system is made of a series of glands that produce chemicals called\nhormones. A number of glands that signal each other in sequence are usually\nreferred to as an axis, for example, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.\n","linknr":1369,"url":"Endocrine_system","recorded":1362567637,"links":107,"instances":["childbirth","biology","anatomy","psychology","biology","biology","anatomy"],"pdf":["http://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jsmr/41/1/35/_pdf","http://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jsmr/41/1/35/_pdf","http://cfids-cab.org/cfs-inform/Neuroendocrin/tsigos.chrousos02.pdf","http://cfids-cab.org/cfs-inform/Neuroendocrin/tsigos.chrousos02.pdf","http://joe.endocrinology-journals.org/content/190/3/555.full.pdf","http://joe.endocrinology-journals.org/content/190/3/555.full.pdf","http://wurtmanlab.mit.edu/static/pdf/151.pdf","http://wurtmanlab.mit.edu/static/pdf/151.pdf"],"categories":["Endocrine
