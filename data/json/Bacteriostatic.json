{"cursor":"2654","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'bacteriostatic agent' or 'bacteriostat', abbreviated 'Bstatic', is a\nbiological or chemical agent that stops bacteria from reproducing, while not\nnecessarily harming them otherwise. Depending on their application,\nbacteriostatic antibiotics, disinfectants, antiseptics and preservatives can be\ndistinguished. Upon removal of the bacteriostat, the bacteria usually start to\ngrow again. This is in contrast to bactericides, which kill bacteria.\n\nBacteriostats are often used in plastics to prevent growth of bacteria on\nsurfaces. Bacteriostats commonly used in laboratory work include sodium azide\n(which is acutely toxic) and thiomersal (which is a mutagen in mammalian cells).\n","linknr":193,"url":"Bacteriostatic","recorded":1362500963,"links":31,"instances":["medicine"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Antibiotics"],"headings":["Bacteriostatic antibiotics","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/Amoxicillin-3D-vdW.png/50px-Amoxicillin-3D-vdW.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["sulfonamide","medicine"]],"members":["sulfonamide"],"related":["Bacteria","Antibiotic","Disinfectant","Antiseptic","Preservative","Bactericide","Plastic","Sodium_azide","Thiomersal","Bacteria","Protein","DNA","Metabolism","Bacteriocidal","Tetracyclines","Sulfonamide_(medicine)","Spectinomycin","Trimethoprim","Chloramphenicol","Macrolides","Lincosamides","List_of_antibiotics","Oligodynamic_effect"]}
