Unlike an IP camera (which uses a direct connection using\nethernet or Wi-Fi), a webcam is generally connected by a USB cable, FireWire\ncable, or similar cable.\n\nTheir most popular use is the establishment of video links, permitting computers\nto act as videophones or videoconference stations. The common use as a video\ncamera for the World Wide Web gave the webcam its name. Other popular uses\ninclude security surveillance, computer vision, video broadcasting, and for\nrecording social videos.\n\nWebcams are known for their low manufacturing cost and flexibility, Solomon\nNegash, Michael E.
