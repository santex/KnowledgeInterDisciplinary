biology"],"text":"\n\n\n'An adaptation', also called an 'adaptive trait', in biology is a trait with a\ncurrent functional role in the life history of an organism that is maintained\nand evolved by means of natural selection. 'Adaptation' refers to both the\ncurrent state of being adapted and to the dynamic evolutionary process that\nleads to the adaptation. Adaptations contribute to the fitness and survival of\nindividuals. Organisms face a succession of environmental challenges as they\ngrow and develop and are equipped with an adaptive plasticity as the phenotype\nof traits develop in response to the imposed conditions. The developmental norm\nof reaction for any given trait is essential to the correction of adaptation as\nit affords a kind of biological insurance or resilience to varying environments.\n","title":"Adaptation","headings":["General principles","Brief history","Types of adaptations","Shifts in function","Related issues","Function and teleonomy","See also","References"]},"micro-relation":["3: Phenotypic_plasticity","3: Mimicry","2: Natural_selection","2: Phenotype","2: Speciation","2: Symbiosis","2: Physiological","2: Temperature_regulation","2: Theodosius_Dobzhansky","2: Genotype","2: Aristotle","2: Charles_Darwin","2: Alfred_Russel_Wallace","2: Henry_Walter_Bates","2: Extinction","2: Genetic_variability","2: Leigh_Van_Valen","2: Co-evolution","2: Coleoptera","2: Hymenoptera","2: Adaptive_radiation","1: Phenotypic_trait","1: Evolution","1: Ontogeny","1: Norm_of_reaction","1: Parasite","1: Liver_fluke","1: Biological_life_cycle","1: Darwin's_finches","1: Cladogenesis","1: Geographical_isolation","1: Cichlid","1: Polyploidy","1: Eukaryote","1: Ecological_niche","1: Comparative_anatomy","1: Behaviour","1: Instincts","1: Learning","1: Neuropsychology","1: Mating","1: Animal_communication","1: Venom","1: Phototropism","1: Developmental_biology","1: Ions","1: Homeostasis","1: Habitat","1: Population_genetics","1: Heritable","1: Californian_redwood","1: Relict","1: Elliott_Sober","1: Malthusian_parameter","1: Transplant_experiment","1: Empedocles","1: Natural_theology","1: Adrian_Desmond","1: William_Paley","1: Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz","1: Best_of_all_possible_worlds","1: Voltaire","1: David_Hume","1: Robert_Knox","1: Lamarck","1: Inheritance_of_acquired_traits","1: Étienne_Geoffroy_Saint-Hilaire","1: Gregor_Mendel","1: William_Charles_Wells","1: Sir_William_Lawrence,_1st_Baronet","1: August_Weismann","1: Georges-Louis_Leclerc,_Comte_de_Buffon","1: E.B._Ford","1: Climate","1: Invasive_species","1: Punctuated_equilibrium","1: Purine","1: RNA_world_hypothesis","1: Physiology","1: Ecosystem","1: Red_Queen's_Hypothesis","1: Pollination","1: Co-extinction","1: Infection","1: Pollination_syndrome","1: Predator-prey","1: Diptera","1: Angiosperm","1: Cretaceous","1: Nectaries","1: Butterflies","1: Batesian_mimicry","1: Hover-fly","1: Wasps","1: Bees","1: Fritz_Müller","1: Müllerian_mimicry","1: Genetics","1: Evolutionary_developmental_biology","1: University_College_London","1: Vertebrates","1: Brain_function","1: Immune_system","1: Flowering_plants","1: Angiosperms","1: Clade","1: Monophyletic","1: Ectoparasites","1: Irish_elk","1: Deer","1: Allometric","1: Last_glacial_period","1: Camouflage","1: Caucasian_Salamander","1: Gold-striped_salamander","1: Brooks","1: Larvae","1: Fire_salamander","1: Peacock","1: Sexual_selection","1: Foetus","1: Pelvis","1: Bipedal","1: Neanderthals","1: Polyploid","1: White_Leghorn","1: Fowl","1: Vitamin_B","1: Diploid","1: Eukaryotes","1: Sexual_reproduction","1: Heterozygotes","1: Salvador_Luria","1: Max_Delbrück","1: Luria-Delbruck_experiment","1: Evolution_of_mammalian_auditory_ossicles","1: Synapsid","1: Neil_Shubin","1: Feathered_dinosaurs#List_of_dinosaur_genera_with_preserved_feathers","1: Pleiotropic","1: Maladaptation","1: Vestigial","1: Mutations","1: Wisdom_teeth","1: Intestinal_parasite","1: Sewall_Wright","1: Fitness_landscape","1: Parasitism","1: Pollinator","1: Food_chain","1: Bumblebees","1: Gradualism","1: Koalas","1: Eucalyptus","1: Giant_panda","1: Bamboo","1: Rat","1: Crab","1: Red_blood_cell","1: Fecundity","1: Flatfish","1: Cephalopods","1: Chameleons","1: Penguins","1: Ostrich","1: Teleonomy","1: Teleology","1: Probabilistic_logic","1: Colin_Pittendrigh","1: George_Gaylord_Simpson","1: Cybernetics","1: Self-organising_systems","1: Ernst_Mayr","1: George_C._Williams","1: Jacques_Monod","1: Ernest_Nagel","1: David_Hull","1: J.B.S._Haldane","1: Co-adaptation","1: Ecological_trap","1: Evolutionary_physiology","1: Evolvability","1: Exaptation","1: Experimental_evolution","1: Intragenomic_conflict","1: Non-Darwinian_Adaptation"]}
