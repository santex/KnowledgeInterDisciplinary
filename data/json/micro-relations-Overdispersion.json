This necessitates an assessment of the fit\nof the chosen model. It is usually possible to choose the model parameters in\nsuch a way that the theoretical population mean of the model is approximately\nequal to the sample mean. However, especially for simple models with few\nparameters, theoretical predictions may not match empirical observations for\nhigher moments. When the observed variance is higher than the variance of a\ntheoretical model, 'overdispersion' has occurred. Conversely, 'underdispersion'\nmeans that there was less variation in the data than predicted. Overdispersion\nis a very common feature in applied data analysis because in practice,\npopulations are frequently heterogeneous contrary to the assumptions implicit\nwithin widely used simple parametric models.\n","linknr":140,"url":"Overdispersion","recorded":1362482986,"links":12,"instances":["mathematics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Data analysis","Point processes","Spatial data analysis"],"headings":["Examples","Differences in terminology between disciplines","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["moment","mathematics"]],"members":["moment"],"related":["Statistics","Statistical_dispersion","Statistics","Parametric_model","Goodness_of_fit","Population_mean","Sample_mean","Moment_(mathematics)","Variance","Heterogeneous","Poisson_distribution","Poisson_regression","Count_data","Negative_binomial_distribution","Gamma_distribution","Binomial_distribution","Triversâ€“Willard_hypothesis","Beta-binomial_model","Random_effects_model","Beta_distribution","Bernoulli_distribution","Normal_distribution","Logistic_regression","Multilevel_model","Logistic_regression","Normal_distribution","Statistical_survey","Margin_of_error","Sampling_error","Meta-analysis","Study_heterogeneity","Sampling_bias","Mixture_distribution","Opinion_poll","Biological_science","Parasitology","Ecology","Parasitology","Demography","Unobserved_heterogeneity","Index_of_dispersion","Planet_Math"]}
