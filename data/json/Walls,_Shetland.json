Cf VÃ¡gar and VÃ¡gur in the Faroe Islands), is a settlement on the south\nside of West Mainland, Shetland Islands, at the head of Vaila Sound and\nsheltered even from southerly storms by the islands of Linga and Vaila.\n\nA little to the east of the centre of the village is the marina, making this a\npopular base for leisure sailors. The fishing vessels that are still based in\nWalls tend to use the pier a few hundred yards along the west side of Vaila\nSound. This is also the terminus for the ferry service to the island of Foula,\nsome distance out into the Atlantic from Shetland's Mainland.\n\nToday it is home to the dialect children's writer Iris Sandison, also secretary\nto the local history group.\n\nWaas has long been famed for its annual Agricultural Show.
