Health and social care policy and funding are the\nresponsibility of the Health and Social Care Directorates of the Scottish\nGovernment. The current Cabinet Secretary for Health and Well-being is Alex Neil\nand the head of staff is the Director-General Health and Social Care and Chief\nExecutive of NHSScotland, Derek Feeley.\n\nNHS Scotland had an operating budget of Â£11.35 billion in 2010-11, funding the\nemployment of approximately 140,000 staff, including more than 47,500 nurses,\nmidwives and health visitors and over 3,800 consultants. In addition, there are\nalso more than 12,000 doctors, family practitioners and allied health\nprofessionals, including dentists, opticians and community pharmacists, who\noperate as independent contractors providing a range of services within the NHS\nin return for fees and\nallowances. [http://www.show.scot.nhs.uk/introduction.aspx About the NHS in\nScotland] NHS Scotland\n\nHealth and social care are devolved issues in the United Kingdom and the the\nseparate public healthcare bodies of Scotland, England and Wales are each\ncommonly referred to as \"National Health Service\". The NHS in Scotland was\ncreated as an administratively separate organisation in 1948 under the\nministerial oversight of the Scottish Office, before being politically devolved\nin 1999. This separation of powers and financing tends to be hidden from the\ngeneral public due to the co-ordination and co-operation where cross-border\nemergency care is involved.\n","linknr":290,"url":"NHS_Scotland","recorded":1375078338,"links":["/w/index.php?title=NHS_Scotland&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=NHS_Scotland&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:NHS_Scotland.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/37/NHS_Scotland.png/180px-NHS_Scotland.png","/wiki/File:Wfm_victoria_quay.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/Wfm_victoria_quay.jpg/180px-Wfm_victoria_quay.jpg","/wiki/Victoria_Quay,_Scotland","/wiki/Highlands_and_Islands_Medical_Service","/wiki/Emergency_Hospital_Service_(Scotland)","/wiki/Scottish_Government","/wiki/St_Andrew%27s_House","/wiki/Edinburgh","/wiki/Pound_sterling","/wiki/Alex_Neil_(politician)","/wiki/Cabinet_Secretary_for_Health_and_Well-being","/wiki/Shona_Robison","/wiki/Minister_for_Commonwealth_Games_and_Sport","/wiki/Michael_Matheson_(politician)","/wiki/Minister_for_Public_Health","/wiki/Health_and_Social_Care_Directorates","/wiki/Healthcare_Improvement_Scotland","/wiki/NHS_24","/wiki/NHS_Health_Scotland","/wiki/NHS_National_Services_Scotland","/wiki/NHS_National_Waiting_Times_Centre","/wiki/Scottish_Ambulance_Service","/wiki/State_Hospitals_Board_for_Scotland","/wiki/National_Health_Service_(Scotland)_Act_1947","/w/index.php?title=National_Health_Service_(Scotland)_Act_1972&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=National_Health_Service_(Scotland)_Act_1978&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=National_Health_Service_Reform_(Scotland)_Act_2004&action=edit&redlink=1","http://www.scotland.gov.uk/About/Performance/purposestratobjs","http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Government/local-government/delperf/SOA","http://www.show.scot.nhs.uk/","/wiki/Publicly-funded_health_care","/wiki/Scotland","/wiki/Healthcare_in_Scotland","/wiki/Social_care_in_Scotland","/wiki/Health_and_Social_Care_Directorates","/wiki/Scottish_Government","/wiki/Cabinet_Secretary_for_Health_and_Well-being","/wiki/Alex_Neil_(politician)","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Pound_sterling","/wiki/Midwives","/wiki/Health_visitor","/wiki/Consultant_(medicine)","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Reserved_and_excepted_matters","/wiki/National_Health_Service_(England)","/wiki/NHS_Wales","/wiki/National_Health_Service","/wiki/Scottish_Office","/wiki/Anglo-Scottish_border","#Origins_and_history","#Before_1948","#Health_Boards","#Elections_to_Health_Boards","#Former_Health_Boards","#Special_Health_Boards","#Other_divisions","#Central_Register","#Patient_identification","#Overseeing_and_representative_bodies","#Quality_of_healthcare","#Recent_developments","#See_also","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=NHS_Scotland&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/National_Health_Service_(Scotland)_Act_1947","/w/index.php?title=National_Health_Service_(Scotland)_Act_1978&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Highlands_and_Islands_Medical_Service","/w/index.php?title=NHS_Scotland&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Highlands_and_Islands_Medical_Service","#cite_note-3","/w/index.php?title=NHS_Scotland&action=edit&section=3","/w/index.php?title=NHS_Scotland&action=edit&section=4","/wiki/Scottish_Government","#cite_note-4","/wiki/NHS_Ayrshire_and_Arran","/wiki/NHS_Borders","/wiki/NHS_Dumfries_and_Galloway","/wiki/NHS_Western_Isles","/wiki/Scottish_Gaelic","/wiki/NHS_Fife","/wiki/NHS_Forth_Valley","/wiki/NHS_Grampian","/wiki/NHS_Greater_Glasgow_and_Clyde","/wiki/NHS_Highland","/wiki/NHS_Lanarkshire","/wiki/NHS_Lothian","/wiki/NHS_Orkney","/wiki/NHS_Shetland","/wiki/NHS_Tayside","/wiki/NHS24","/wiki/File:NHS_Health_Boards.PNG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/NHS_Health_Boards.PNG/300px-NHS_Health_Boards.PNG","/wiki/File:NHS_Health_Boards.PNG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/w/index.php?title=NHS_Scotland&action=edit&section=5","/wiki/NHS_Argyll_and_Clyde","/wiki/Argyll_and_Bute","/w/index.php?title=NHS_Scotland&action=edit&section=6","/wiki/NHS_Health_Scotland","#cite_note-5","/wiki/Healthcare_Improvement_Scotland","#cite_note-6","/wiki/Scottish_Ambulance_Service","#cite_note-7","/wiki/Golden_Jubilee_Hospital","#cite_note-8","#cite_note-9","#cite_note-10","/wiki/State_Hospital_for_Scotland_and_Northern_Ireland","/wiki/NHS24","#cite_note-11","/wiki/NHS_Educ
