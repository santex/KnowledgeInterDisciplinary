Adhesives come from either\nnatural or synthetic sources. The types of materials that can be bonded are vast\nbut adhesives are especially useful for bonding thin materials. Adhesives cure\n(harden) by either evaporating a solvent or by chemical reactions that occur\nbetween two or more constituents.

General\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial\nChemistry 2010, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. \n\nAdhesives are useful for joining thin or dissimilar materials, minimizing\nweight, and providing a vibration-damping\njoint. [http://www.sintef.no/content/page1____5411.aspx ] A\ndisadvantage of most adhesives is that most do not form an instantaneous joint,\nunlike many other joining processes, because the adhesive needs time to\ncure.\n\nThe earliest known date for a simple glue is 200,000 BC\nand for a compound glue 70,000 BC.\n","linknr":386,"url":"Adhesive","recorded":1362512356,"links":72,"instances":["chemistry","matter","tool","chemistry","plastic","food_processing","chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Adhesives|","Art materials","1750 introductions","Packaging materials"],"headings":["History","Economic importance","Types","Application","Mechanisms of adhesion","Failure of the adhesive joint","Design of adhesive joints","Shelf life","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5d/AdhesivesForHouseUse004.jpg/220px-AdhesivesForHouseUse004.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/MVC-013F.jpg/200px-MVC-013F.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/AdhesiveFractures.svg/550px-AdhesiveFractures.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/Fracture_modes_v2.svg/350px-Fracture_modes_v2.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["curing","chemistry"],["rendering","food_processing"],["phase","matter"],["formica","plastic"],["clamp","tool"],["precipitation","chemistry"],["base","chemistry"]],"members":["base","phase","clamp","precipitation","formica","rendering","curing"],"related":["Liquid","Adhesion","Chemical_synthesis","Curing_(chemistry)","Spear","Birch-tar","Hafting","Sibudu_Cave","Ochre","Ötzi_the_Iceman","Animal_glue","Rendering_(food_processing)","Babylon","Egyptians","Animal_glue","Ivory","Papyrus","Mongols","Native_Americans_in_the_United_States","Spruce","Birch_bark","Canoe","Middle_Ages","Parchment","Gold_leaf","Isinglass","Casein","Casein","Wood_glue","Grocery_bag","Inventory_turnover","Emerging_country","Chemical_reaction","Phase_(matter)","Polymer","Solvent","Rubber_cement","Polyvinyl_acetate","Van_der_Waals_force","Cross-link","Molecular_mass","Acrylate","Laminate","Formica_(plastic)","Footwear","Natural_rubber","Polychloroprene","Strain_crystallization","Artificial_turf","Clamp_(tool)","Thermoplastic","Ethylene-vinyl_acetate","Procter_&_Gamble","Radiation","Heat","Moisture","Polyimide","Starch","Dextrin","Animal_glue","Bioadhesives","Corrugated_board","Paper_bag","Masonite","Lignin","Medium-density_fiberboard","Albumen","Plywood","Animal_glue","Luthier","Precipitation_(chemistry)","Milk","Protein","Acetic_acid","Vinegar","Curd","Base_(chemistry)","Sodium_bicarbonate","Elastomer","Thermoplastics","Emulsion","Thermosetting_plastic","Epoxy","Polyurethane","Cyanoacrylate","Acrylic_resin","Post-it_notes","Karlsons_klister","Caulk_gun","Chemical_bond","Van_der_Waals_forces","Oreo","Fracture_mechanics","Stress_concentration","Strain_energy_release_rate","Adhesive_surface_forces","Glue_stick","Sealant","Wood_glue"]}
