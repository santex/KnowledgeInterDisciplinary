It was produced mainly for the Japanese domestic\nmarketâalthough both new and used models were exported from Japanâmaking it a\nfairly hard-to-find scooter. It was available in red or black only, both with\ngold wheels.\n\nThe FC50 was powered by a single cylinder petrol two-stroke engine that was\nliquid cooled, making it one of the most powerful in its class. The small\nradiator was fitted behind the grill between the two headlights. It featured 12-\nvolt electric start and CVT transmission; the transmission changed from low to\nhigh at around 5500 rpm. It had an automatic centrifugal clutch that engaged\ngradually from 3000 rpm.\n\nIt was made to carry only one person at a time and had no provisions for a\npassenger. It featured V-TACS; this was a small valve in the exhaust port that\nwas operated (closed to activate) by a lever via the rider's left heel. Many\nother larger two-stroke engines use a similar system although most are engaged\nautomatically by electric servos. V-TACS gave it more power from 5500 rpm (but\nit also made less power if engaged at rpm under 5500 rpm).\n\nAn expansion chamber and tuned length exhaust were fitted from factory although\nthey were only \"average\" in design. Top speed was about 60 km/h @ 11,000\nrpm. Both front and back brakes were drum brakes.\n\nThe dash had dials to show rpm, speed, engine temperature and fuel level. A\nsmall set of lights on the rpm dial illuminated when V-tacs was engaged; other\nlights on the dash lit up for turn signal, oil low (two-stroke oil) and high\nbeam (head lights). A small light on the speed dial flashed when speed exceeded\n35 km/h.\n\n File:Honda FC50 1.jpg File:Honda FC50 3.jpg File:Honda FC50
