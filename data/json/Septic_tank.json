(Other components,\ntypically mandated and/or restricted by local governments, optionally include\npumps, alarms, sand filters, and clarified liquid effluent disposal means such\nas a septic drain field, ponds, natural stone fiber filter plants or peat moss\nbeds.) Septic systems are a type of On-Site Sewage Facility (OSSF). In North\nAmerica, approximately 25% of the population relies on septic tanks; this can\ninclude suburbs and small towns as well as rural areas (Indianapolis is an\nexample of a large city where many of the city's neighborhoods are still on\nseparate septic systems). In Europe, they are in general limited to rural areas\nonly. Since a septic system requires a drainfield that uses a lot of land area,\nthey are not suitable for densely built cities.\n\nThe term \"septic\" refers to the anaerobic bacterial environment that develops\nin the tank which decomposes or mineralizes the waste discharged into the tank.\nSeptic tanks can be coupled with other onsite wastewater treatment units such\nas biofilters or aerobic systems involving artificial forced\naeration. {{cite web\n| url = http://www.agwt.org/info/septicsystems.htm title = Septic Systems for\n| Waste Water Disposal publisher = American Ground Water Trust accessdate =\n| 2008-05-20\n}}\n\nPeriodic preventive maintenance is required to remove the irreducible solids\nthat settle and gradually fill the tank, reducing its efficiency. In most\njurisdictions this maintenance is required by law, yet often not enforced.\nAccording to the Environmental Protection Agency, in the United States it is the\nhome owner's responsibility to maintain their septic\nsystem. http://www.epa.gov/owm/septic/pubs/homeowner_guide_long.pdf\nThose who disregard the requirement will eventually be faced with extremely\ncostly repairs when solids escape the tank and destroy the clarified liquid\neffluent disposal means. A properly maintained system, on the other hand, can\nlast for decades or possibly even a lifetime.\n","linknr":310,"url":"Septic_tank","recorded":1362500520,"links":47,"instances":["land","waste","biochemistry"],"pdf":["http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/static/documents/Business/Technical_guidance_sewage_effluent.pdf","http://www.epa.gov/owm/septic/pubs/homeowner_guide_long.pdf","http://www.epa.gov/etv/pubs/600s07004.pdf","http://www.epa.gov/npdespub/pubs/homeowner_guide_long_customize.pdf"],"categories":["Sewerage infrastructure","Storage tanks"],"headings":["Description","Potential problems","Environmental issues","Regulations","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/74/Septic_tank_not_in_ground.jpg/220px-Septic_tank_not_in_ground.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/Septic_tank.jpg/220px-Septic_tank.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/Septic_tank_EN.svg/220px-Septic_tank_EN.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/24/Landpeople_s_cc8.PNG/220px-Landpeople_s_cc8.PNG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["fermentation","biochemistry"],["subdivision","land"],["blackwater","waste"]],"members":["subdivision","blackwater","fermentation"],"related":["Sewage_treatment","Sand_filter","Septic_drain_field","Sphagnum","OSSF","North_America","Suburbs","Rural","Indianapolis","Drainfield","Anaerobic_digestion","Onsite_sewage_facility","Biofilters","Aeration","Preventive_maintenance","Wastewater","Septic_drain_field","Leach_field","Percolation_test","Percolation","Soil","Groundwater","Evaporation","Root","Plant","Transpiration","Weeping_tile","Leach_field","Pump","Imhoff_tank","Effluent","Garbage_disposal","Silver_nitrate","Flood","Biofilm","Nitrogen","Algal_blooms","Sulfate","Hydrogen_sulfide","Odor","Toxic","Methane","Nitrate","Nitro_compound","Ammonia","Fermentation_(biochemistry)","Carbon_dioxide","Methane","Redox","Phosphates","Cyanobacteria","Septic_drain_field","Eutrophication","Subdivision_(land)","Blackwater_(waste)","Bioreactor","Cesspit","Drain-waste-vent_system","Ecological_sanitation","Effluent_sewer","Grease_interceptor","Latrine","Mound_system","Outhouse","Percolation_test","Pit_toilet","Sanitary_sewer","Sepsis","Septage"]}
