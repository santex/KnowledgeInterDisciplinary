{"cursor":"4102","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Survival' is the Progressive / Symphonic rock project of Dutch multi-\ninstrumentalist and composer Jack Langevelt. A huge fan of the Seventies\nSymphonic Rock (a.o. Trace, Emerson, Lake & Palmer, Ekseption, The Nice) and\nadmirer of the deceased Dutch keyboardist Rick van der Linden. Survival existed\nas a band between 1981 and 1997, although Jack continued making music under the\nname Survival. Recently Survival has been reactivated and in 2008 they released\ntheir first official album Crusader on Musea Records.\n\nJack Langevelt was born on the fifth of August 1954 in Rotterdam, Holland. In\nhis early childhood he had warm feelings for Classical music ( a.o. Bach,\nMozart, Chopin). After hearing Air (by Ekseption) he fell in love with the music\nof Rick van der Linden. Ekseption, Trace, The Nice and Emerson, Lake & Palmer\nwere his major influences. This Symphonic Music highlighted his favourite\ninstruments: Hammond organ and piano. After he had some piano lessons, he\nstudied at the Rotterdam School of Arts (1971). At the same time he started his\nmusical career as a drummer in various groups and styles. In 1980 he switched to\nhis first love: keyboard playing in Symphonic Rock Music. He formed his own\ngroup Survival. With this group (1981â1997) he developed his ideas in his own\ncompositions which were a of classical, rock and jazz music. In 1997 Survival\nsplit up, but Jack continued making music under his name and the name Survival.\nFor two years Jack developed a more intuitive style of music, played and\ncomposed only by himself. The result was the album The Final Chapter(1999). For\nthe next two years he was occupied creating his own Recording Studio (BJT\nStudio's). With this studio he saw no limitations anymore for creating,\ncomposing and producing his music on a level that was more to his satisfaction.\nWith the help of vocalist Linda Maarseveen and guitar players David Dexter (from\nthe UK), Mario Roelofsen (Purple Rainbow) and Jan Peter Eerenberg (Thijs van\nLeer Band) he recorded more than 30 songs. As a result he made 2\nProgressive/Symphonic/Classic rock albums: Con Brio and Montgisard (self-\nreleased).\n\nThe album Crusader, officially released by Musea in 2008, is the final and\nuncompromised result of all this work.\n","linknr":107,"url":"Survival_(band)","recorded":1363376535,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Survival_(band)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Survival_(band)&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/Progressive_rock","/wiki/Symphonic_rock","/wiki/Trace_(band)","/wiki/Emerson,_Lake_%26_Palmer","/wiki/Ekseption","/wiki/The_Nice","/wiki/Rick_van_der_Linden","/wiki/Musea_Records","/wiki/Rotterdam","/wiki/Holland","/wiki/Classical_music","/wiki/Bach","/wiki/Mozart","/wiki/Chopin","/wiki/Ekseption","/wiki/Rick_van_der_Linden","/wiki/Ekseption","/wiki/Trace_(band)","/wiki/The_Nice","/wiki/Emerson,_Lake_%26_Palmer","/wiki/Hammond_organ","//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/synthesis","/wiki/Classic_rock","/wiki/Musea","#Albums","#Members","#Former_members","#External_links","#References","/w/index.php?title=Survival_(band)&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Survival_(band)&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Synthesizers","/wiki/Mellotron","/w/index.php?title=Survival_(band)&action=edit&section=3","/w/index.php?title=Survival_(band)&action=edit&section=4","http://www.progarchives.com/artist.asp?id=5794","http://www.dprp.net/reviews/200926.php#survival","http://www.proggnosis.com/PGArtist.asp?AID=7668","/w/index.php?title=Survival_(band)&action=edit&section=5","http://www.survivalmusic.webs.com","http://www.myspace.com/survival2","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Survival_(band)&oldid=481313027","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Dutch_rock_music_groups","/wiki/Category:Dutch_progressive_rock_groups","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Survival+%28band%29&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Survival+%28band%29","/wiki/Survival_(band)","/wiki/Talk:Survival_(band)","#","/wiki/Survival_(band)","/w/index.php?title=Survival_(band)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Survival_(band)&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Survival_(band)","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Survival_(band)","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Survival_(band)&oldid=481313027","/w/index.php?title=Survival_(band)&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Survival_%28band%29&id=481313027","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Survival+%28band%29","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Survival+%28band%29&oldid=481313027&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Survival_(band)&printable=yes","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_(band)","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=skins.vector&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","/w/index.php?title=MediaWiki:Gadget-ReferenceTooltips.js&action=raw&ctype=text/javascript&508635914","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":["band"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Dutch
