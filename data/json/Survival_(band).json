{"cursor":"4213","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Survival' is the Progressive / Symphonic rock project of Dutch multi-\ninstrumentalist and composer Jack Langevelt. A huge fan of the Seventies\nSymphonic Rock (a.o. Trace, Emerson, Lake & Palmer, Ekseption, The Nice) and\nadmirer of the deceased Dutch keyboardist Rick van der Linden. Survival existed\nas a band between 1981 and 1997, although Jack continued making music under the\nname Survival. Recently Survival has been reactivated and in 2008 they released\ntheir first official album Crusader on Musea Records.\n\nJack Langevelt was born on the fifth of August 1954 in Rotterdam, the\nNetherlands. In his early childhood he had warm feelings for Classical music (\na.o. Bach, Mozart, Chopin). After hearing Air (by Ekseption) he fell in love\nwith the music of Rick van der Linden. Ekseption, Trace, The Nice and Emerson,\nLake & Palmer were his major influences. This Symphonic Music highlighted his\nfavourite instruments: Hammond organ and piano. After he had some piano lessons,\nhe studied at the Rotterdam School of Arts (1971). At the same time he started\nhis musical career as a drummer in various groups and styles. In 1980 he\nswitched to his first love: keyboard playing in Symphonic Rock Music. He formed\nhis own group Survival. With this group (1981â1997) he developed his ideas in\nhis own compositions which were a of classical, rock and jazz music. In 1997\nSurvival split up, but Jack continued making music under his name and the name\nSurvival. For two years Jack developed a more intuitive style of music, played\nand composed only by himself. The result was the album The Final Chapter(1999).\nFor the next two years he was occupied creating his own Recording Studio (BJT\nStudio's). With this studio he saw no limitations anymore for creating,\ncomposing and producing his music on a level that was more to his satisfaction.\nWith the help of vocalist Linda Maarseveen and guitar players David Dexter (from\nthe UK), Mario Roelofsen (Purple Rainbow) and Jan Peter Eerenberg (Thijs van\nLeer Band) he recorded more than 30 songs. As a result he made 2\nProgressive/Symphonic/Classic rock albums: Con Brio and Montgisard (self-\nreleased).\n\nThe album Crusader, officially released by Musea in 2008, is the final and\nuncompromised result of all this work.\n","linknr":111,"url":"Survival_(band)","recorded":1374863763,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Survival_(band)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Survival_(band)&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Progressive_rock","/wiki/Symphonic_rock","/wiki/Trace_(band)","/wiki/Emerson,_Lake_%26_Palmer","/wiki/Ekseption","/wiki/The_Nice","/wiki/Rick_van_der_Linden","/wiki/Musea_Records","/wiki/Rotterdam","/wiki/Netherlands","/wiki/Classical_music","/wiki/Bach","/wiki/Mozart","/wiki/Chopin","/wiki/Ekseption","/wiki/Rick_van_der_Linden","/wiki/Ekseption","/wiki/Trace_(band)","/wiki/The_Nice","/wiki/Emerson,_Lake_%26_Palmer","/wiki/Hammond_organ","//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/synthesis","/wiki/Classic_rock","/wiki/Musea","#Albums","#Members","#Former_members","#External_links","#References","/w/index.php?title=Survival_(band)&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Survival_(band)&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Synthesizers","/wiki/Mellotron","/w/index.php?title=Survival_(band)&action=edit&section=3","/w/index.php?title=Survival_(band)&action=edit&section=4","http://www.progarchives.com/artist.asp?id=5794","http://www.dprp.net/reviews/200926.php#survival","http://www.proggnosis.com/PGArtist.asp?AID=7668","/w/index.php?title=Survival_(band)&action=edit&section=5","http://www.survival2.webs.com","http://www.survivalmusic.webs.com","http://www.myspace.com/survival2","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Survival_(band)&oldid=547376829","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Dutch_rock_music_groups","/wiki/Category:Dutch_progressive_rock_groups","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Survival+%28band%29&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Survival+%28band%29","/wiki/Survival_(band)","/wiki/Talk:Survival_(band)","#","/wiki/Survival_(band)","/w/index.php?title=Survival_(band)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Survival_(band)&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Survival_(band)","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Survival_(band)","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Survival_(band)&oldid=547376829","/w/index.php?title=Survival_(band)&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7647169","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Survival_%28band%29&id=547376829","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Survival+%28band%29","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Survival+%28band%29&oldid=547376829&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Survival_(band)&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7647169#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_(band)","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":["band"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Dutch
