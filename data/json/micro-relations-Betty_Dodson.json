Dodson held the first one-woman show of erotic art\nat the Wickersham Gallery in New York City in 1968. She left the art world to\nteach sex to women. She is widely known as a pioneer in women's, and to a\nsomewhat lesser extent men's, sexual liberation, having sold more than 1 million\ncopies of her first book, Sex for One. Much of her fame has come from her work\nnot only advocating masturbation, but conducting workshops for more than 30\nyears in which groups of about 10 or more women (and at least once a group of\nmen) would talk, explore their own bodies, and masturbate together. She hosted a\nPublic-access television cable television program in New York City in the early\n80's, and conducted her workshop - a dozen or so nude women discussing and\npracticing masturbation - on TV. Her website called \"Betty Dodson's Genital\nGallery\" shows many films of masturbation and intercourse, with close-up views\nof genitals.\n\nDodson's books include Liberating Masturbation, a self-published book that\nbecame a feminist classic. Sex for One: The Joy of Self-Loving and Orgasms for\nTwo: the Joy of Partnersex. She also produced four videos: Selfloving: Portrait\nof a Sexual Seminar, Celebrating Orgasm: Women's Private Selfloving Sessions,\nViva la Vulva; Women's Sex Organs Revealed and ''The Orgasm Doctor\": Two Private\nHands-on Sex Coaching Sessions.\n\nShe is a founder of the pro-sex feminist movement, having left behind the more\ntraditional feminist movement because she considered it , antisexual and over-\npoliticized. Dodson considers too much is made of sexual labels and embraces\nthem all by calling herself a heterosexual, bisexual lesbian. She looks forward\nto the day we can all be just \"sexual.\" Dodson, Betty (June 26, 2005), [http://dodsonandross.com/sexfeature/we-are-all-quite-\nqueer We Are All Quite Queer], Bettydodson.com.
