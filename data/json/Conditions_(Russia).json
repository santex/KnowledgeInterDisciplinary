When the Empress returned to\nRussia, she revoked her approval of the Conditions and dissolved the Supreme\nPrivy Council on the 20th of February. The members of the Council were removed\nfrom government and exiled or repressed paving the way for Anna to become an\nabsolute monarch in the model of her uncle Peter the Great.\n\nThe Conditions acted as a constitution binding the monarch in relation to:\n* Declarations of War.\n* Signing of Treaties.\n* Imposing new taxes.\n* Appointing officers to ranks higher than Polkovnik (Colonel).\n* Depriving and granting estates.\n* Appointing to the court ranks.\n* Using of public revenues.\n\nNone of these powers could be exercised by the monarch, under the Conditions,\nwithout the approval of the Supreme Privy Council.
