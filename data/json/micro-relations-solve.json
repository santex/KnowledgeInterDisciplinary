He pillaged in the Baltic Sea and at night they made shore in the\nhundred of Lofond/Lovund (perhaps LovÃ¶n or the Lagunda Hundred) where they\nsurrounded a house and set it on fire killing everybody inside. In the house\nthere was a feast where the Swedish king Ãsten was invited. Then SÃ¶lve and his\nmen arrived in Sigtuna (Old Sigtuna) and declared that the Swedes had to accept\nhim as king. The Swedes refused and fought SÃ¶lve for eleven days until they\nlost. SÃ¶lve then ruled Sweden until the Swedes rebelled and killed him.\n\nHistoria Norwegiae only relates that the Geats burnt Ãsten and his people to\ndeath inside his house.\n\nSÃ¶lvi also appears in [[Half's saga]], of which there is a version from the year\n1300. This saga relates that SÃ¶lvi was the son of HÃ¶gne the rich of NÃ¦rÃ¸y fyrir\nNaumundalsminni in Norway and that he was the brother of Hild the Slender.\nSÃ¶lvi's brother-in-law, Hjorleiv, was the king of Hordaland and Rogaland and\nHjorleiv killed Hreidar, the king of Zealand. Then Hjorleiv put SÃ¶lvi as the\njarl of Zealand. Later in the saga, SÃ¶lvi is no longer the jarl of Zealand, but\nthe king of Sweden. Hjorleiv had a son named Half (after whom the saga is\nnamed), and after the Norwegian king Asmund had killed Half, a couple of his\nchampions go to Sweden and king SÃ¶lvi (til svÃ­Ã¾jÃ³Ã°ar ; fÃ³ru Ã¾eir ... Ã¡ fund\nSÃ¶lva konungs) (see also Gard Agdi).\n\nSÃ¶lvi is also mentioned in a few other sources, but none of them relate of his\nDanish and Swedish dominions.\n\nHe was succeeded by Ingvar of the Swedish royal dynasty, the House of Yngling.\n","linknr":226,"url":"solve","recorded":1362900101,"links":17,"instances":["denmark","division","title"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Viking warriors","Semi-legendary kings of Sweden","7th-century rulers in Europe"],"headings":["Primary sources","Secondary sources"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Thor%27s_hammer%2C_Sk%C3%A5ne.svg/125px-Thor%27s_hammer%2C_Sk%C3%A5ne.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["hundred","division"],["zealand","denmark"],["jarl","title"]],"members":["zealand","hundred","jarl"],"related":["Sea-king","Sweden","Östen","Hall","Heimskringla","Högne_of_Njardö","Nærøy","Jutland","Historia_Norvegiae","Geatish","Baltic_Sea","Hundred_(division)","Lovön","Lagunda_Hundred","Östen","Old_Sigtuna","Nærøy","Norway","Hordaland","Rogaland","Zealand_(Denmark)","Jarl_(title)","Gard_Agdi","Ingvar","House_of_Yngling","Ynglingatal","Ynglinga_saga","Heimskringla","Historia_Norvegiæ","Halfs_saga"]}
