This includes Members of Parliament,\nPeers, lobbyists, researchers, secretaries, civil servants, lobby correspondents\nand leader writers for newspapers and is so named because Parliament is located\nin Westminster, London.\n\nA similar situation occurs in the United States, where the governmental culture\nin and around Washington DC is sometimes known as the 'Washington Bubble' or\nmore often '[[Inside the Beltway]]'. More recently, in Scotland, there has been\na development of a \"Holyrood bubble\", as the Scottish Parliament is in the\nHolyrood district of Edinburgh.\n\nA recent example of the characterization includes Peter Hain speaking in the\nHouse on 29 January 2004: \"All broadcasters, the whole coverage of\npolitics, the Westminster bubble that we as politicians of the Government and\nOpposition occupy together with the Westminster lobby; together we are all\nconducting politics in a way that is turning off voters, listeners, readers and\nwatchers by the million.\"\n\nIn July the previous year he had described it in a newspaper article as:\n\n \"That politically incestuous world occupied by politicians,\ngovernment and opposition, together with the media. Politicians, news\nbroadcasters and journalists now form a 'political class' which is in a frenzied\nworld of its own, divorced from the people, and which is turning off viewers,\nlisteners and readers from politics by the million.\". \n\nIn November 2003 Conservative Party Leader Michael Howard indicated on the\nday of his appointment that he wished to be a \"leader outside the\nWestminster Bubble.\"\n","linknr":98,"url":"Westminster_Bubble","recorded":1362480536,"links":12,"instances":["uk"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Media and communications in Westminster","Political terms in the United Kingdom"],"headings":["External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["conservative_party","uk"]],"members":["conservative_party"],"related":["Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom","Member_of_Parliament","House_of_Lords","Her_Majesty's_Civil_Service","Lobby_correspondent","Leader_writer","City_of_Westminster","London","United_States","Washington_DC","Scotland","Scottish_Parliament","Holyrood,_Edinburgh","Edinburgh","Peter_Hain","Conservative_Party_(UK)","Michael_Howard","The_Times"]}
