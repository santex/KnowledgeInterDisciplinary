{"cursor":"77620","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n'Sociocultural evolution(ism)' is an umbrella term for theories of 'cultural\nevolution' and social evolution, describing how cultures and societies have\nchanged over time. Note that \"sociocultural evolution\" is not an equivalent of\n\"sociocultural development\" (unified processes of differentiation and\nintegration involving increases in sociocultural complexity), as sociocultural\nevolution also encompasses sociocultural transformations accompanied by\ndecreases of complexity (degeneration) as well as ones not accompanied by any\nsignificant changes of sociocultural complexity (cladogenesis). Thus, 'sociocultural evolution' can be defined as \"the\nprocess by which structural reorganization is affected through time, eventually\nproducing a form or structure which is qualitatively different from the\nancestral form.\"\n\nMost 19th-century and some 20th-century approaches aimed to provide models for\nthe evolution of humankind as a whole, arguing that different societies are at\ndifferent stages of social development. The most comprehensive attempt to\ndevelop a general theory of social evolution centering on the development of socio-\ncultural systems was done by Talcott Parsons on a scale which included a theory\nof world-history. Another attempt both on a less systematic scale was attempted\nby World System approach.\n\nMany of the more recent 20th-century approaches focus on changes specific to\nindividual societies and reject the idea of directional change, or social\nprogress. Most archaeologists and cultural anthropologists work within the\nframework of modern theories of sociocultural evolution. Modern approaches to\nsociocultural evolution include neoevolutionism, sociobiology, the theory of\nmodernization and the theory of postindustrial society.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Sociocultural_evolution","recorded":1372152548,"links":[],"instances":["academic","philosopher","internet","polity","sociology","economics","sociology","philosopher","anthropologist","sociology","history","military","personal_and_cultural","anthropologist","economics","bureaucratic","weapon","sociology","anthropology","political_science"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Sociocultural
