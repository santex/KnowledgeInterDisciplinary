In the Second World War, he commanded the Scots Guards and was\nmentioned in despatches, reaching the rank of Captain. In 1951, he was called\nto the Bar from Gray's Inn and was made a Queen's Counsel in 1962, and a\nBencher in 1976. He was Lord of Session under the judiciary title 'Lord Keith'\nfrom 1971 to 1997.\n\nOn 10 January 1977, he was appointed Lord of Appeal in Ordinary and was made\nadditionally a life peer with the title 'Baron Keith of Kinkel', of Strathummel\nin the District of Perth and Kinross, following in the footsteps of his father,\nLord Keith of Avonholm. One year before he had been invested to the Privy\nCouncil. In 1996, he retired as Lord of Appeal and in 1997, he was awarded the\nKnight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire. It was humorously said\nwithin legal circles that wherever there was a negligence case, Lord Keith would\nalways say 'no' to damages.\n\nLord Keith was a special guest of the 20th Tactical Fighter Wing Judge Advocate\nOffice at RAF Upper Heyford, England. To celebrate Law Day 1981, with the United\nStates Air Force 20th TFW Legal Department, Lord Keith provided an insightful\ndefense of the Common Law thrust to protect the Rights of the Individual.\n\nIn 1955 he married Alison Brown, now Lady Keith of Kinkel; they had four sons\nand a daughter, Deborah. The family lived at Loch Tummel, near Pitlochry,\nPerthshire.\n\nLord Keith died in 2002.\n","linknr":135,"url":"Henry_Keith,_Baron_Keith_of_Kinkel","recorded":1375075976,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Henry_Keith,_Baron_Keith_of_Kinkel&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Henry_Keith,_Baron_Keith_of_Kinkel&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Order_of_the_British_Empire","/wiki/Privy_Council_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Scotland","/wiki/James_Keith,_Baron_Keith_of_Avonholm","/wiki/Edinburgh_Academy","/wiki/Magdalen_College,_Oxford","/wiki/Master_of_Arts_(Oxbridge)","/wiki/University_of_Edinburgh","/wiki/Bachelor_of_Law","/wiki/Second_World_War","/wiki/Scots_Guards","/wiki/Mentioned_in_despatches","/wiki/Captain_(British_Army_and_Royal_Marines)","/wiki/Called_to_the_Bar","/wiki/Gray%27s_Inn","/wiki/Queen%27s_Counsel","/wiki/Bencher","/wiki/Court_of_Session","/wiki/Lord_of_Appeal_in_Ordinary","/wiki/Life_peer","/wiki/Perth_and_Kinross","/wiki/James_Keith,_Baron_Keith_of_Avonholm","/wiki/Privy_Council","/wiki/Order_of_the_British_Empire","/wiki/Loch_Tummel","/wiki/Pitlochry","/w/index.php?title=Henry_Keith,_Baron_Keith_of_Kinkel&action=edit&section=1","http://www.leighrayment.com/","/wiki/Wikipedia:V#SELF","/wiki/Wikipedia:NOTRS","http://www.burkes-peerage.net/sites/Contents/book/UK/FHP/Peerage/fhp-KEITHOFKINKEL.asp","/wiki/Wikipedia:Link_rot","http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1398494/Lord-Keith-of-Kinkel.html","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","/wiki/File:Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/ae/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg/30px-Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png","/wiki/File:Scale_of_justice.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/57/Scale_of_justice.svg/20px-Scale_of_justice.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Henry_Keith,_Baron_Keith_of_Kinkel&action=edit","/wiki/Template:UK-law-bio-stub","/w/index.php?title=Template_talk:UK-law-bio-stub&action=edit&redlink=1","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:UK-law-bio-stub&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Henry_Keith,_Baron_Keith_of_Kinkel&oldid=552299009","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1922_births","/wiki/Category:2002_deaths","/wiki/Category:Knights_Grand_Cross_of_the_Order_of_the_British_Empire","/wiki/Category:Law_lords","/wiki/Category:Senior_Lords_of_Appeal_in_Ordinary","/wiki/Category:Members_of_the_Privy_Council_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Category:Scots_Guards_officers","/wiki/Category:Members_of_the_Judicial_Committee_of_the_Privy_Council","/wiki/Category:People_educated_at_Edinburgh_Academy","/wiki/Category:British_Army_personnel_of_World_War_II","/wiki/Category:Alumni_of_Magdalen_College,_Oxford","/wiki/Category:Alumni_of_the_University_of_Edinburgh","/wiki/Category:Members_of_Gray%27s_Inn","/wiki/Category:British_Queen%27s_Counsel","/wiki/Category:Queen%27s_Counsel_1901%E2%80%932000","/wiki/Category:British_law_biography_stubs","/wiki/Category:Use_dmy_dates_from_April_2012","/wiki/Category:Accuracy_disputes_from_February_2012","/wiki/Category:All_pages_needing_factual_verification","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_needing_factual_verification_from_February_2012","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_incorporating_an_LRPP_template_without_an_unnamed_parameter","/wiki/Category:All_articles_with_dead_external_links","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_dead_external_links_from_October_2010","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Henry+Keith%2C+Baron+Keith+of+Kinkel&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Henry+Keith%2C+Baron+Keith+of+Kinkel","/wiki/Henry_Keith,_Baron_Keith_of_Kinkel","/wiki/Talk:Henry_Keith,_Baron_Keith_of_Kinkel","#","/wiki/Henry_Keith,_Baron_Keith_of_Kinkel","/w/index.php?title=Henry_Keith,_Baron_Keith_of_Kinkel&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Henry_Keith,_Baron_Keith_of_Kinkel&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random
