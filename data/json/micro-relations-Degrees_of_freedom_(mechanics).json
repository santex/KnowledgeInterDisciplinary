{"cursor":"12038","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" In mechanics, the 'degree of freedom' (DOF) of a\nmechanical system is the number of independent parameters that define its\nconfiguration. It is the number of parameters that determine the state of a\nphysical system and is important to the analysis of systems of bodies in\nmechanical engineering, aeronautical engineering, robotics, and structural\nengineering.\n\nThe position of a single car (engine) moving along a track has one degree of\nfreedom, because the position of the car is defined by the distance along the\ntrack. A train of rigid cars connected by hinges to an engine still has only one\ndegree of freedom because the positions of the cars behind the engine are\nconstrained by the shape of the track.\n\nAn automobile with highly stiff suspension can be considered to be a rigid body\ntraveling on a plane (a flat, two-dimensional space). This body has three\nindependent degrees of freedom consisting of two components of translation and\none angle of rotation. Skidding or drifting is a good example of an automobile's\nthree independent degrees of freedom.\n\nThe position of a rigid body in space is defined by three components of\ntranslation and three components of rotation, which means that it has six\ndegrees of freedom.\n\nThe Exact constraint mechanical design method manages the degrees of freedom to\nneither underconstrain nor overconstrain a device. http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mechanical-engineering/2-76-multi-scale-\nsystem-design-fall-2004/readings/reading_l3.pdf\n","linknr":178,"url":"Degrees_of_freedom_(mechanics)","recorded":1362565415,"links":40,"instances":["mechanical","physics","motorsports","physics_and_chemistry","radio"],"pdf":["http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mechanical-engineering/2-76-multi-scale-system-design-fall-2004/readings/reading_l3.pdf","http://www.pomorci.com/Zanimljivosti/Ship's%20movements%20at%20sea.pdf","http://www.ingegneriameccanica.org/papers/detc2005-84109.pdf"],"categories":["Mechanics","Robot kinematics","Rigid bodies"],"headings":["Motions and dimensions","Six Degrees of Freedom","Mobility formula","Electrical engineering","References","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/Brosen_shipsmovemensonthewave.svg/250px-Brosen_shipsmovemensonthewave.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/54/Flight_dynamics_with_text.png/250px-Flight_dynamics_with_text.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/b/9/1/b911d28baf3175c30151234a9e0b8c33.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/8/b/f8b92859eae203c904accf454a773d9b.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/3/e/83eea1eb3b6388256babebf86c0e45a1.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/6/d/f/6df3c01015aac66ad8ad6bc7c706b707.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/c/a/ecadd296f8ee9f669eceb28147b42e3f.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/c/2/8c222d32a643cdabb502043adaa2ad23.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/e/d/7ed2f98e5dedfad50a8a541af239e266.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9b/Robot_arm_model_1.png/300px-Robot_arm_model_1.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["drifting","motorsports"],["translation","physics"],["so(n"],["linkage","mechanical"],["linkage","mechanical"],["antenna","radio"],["degrees_of_freedom","physics_and_chemistry"]],"members":["linkage","translation","drifting","degrees_of_freedom","antenna"],"related":["Classical_mechanics","Mechanical_system","Mechanical_engineering","Aerospace_engineering","Robotics","Structural_engineering","Drifting_(motorsports)","Translation_(physics)","Rotation","Exact_constraint","Rigid_body","Affine_transformation","SO(n)","Six_degrees_of_freedom","Flight_dynamics","Flight_dynamics","Flight_dynamics","Linkage_(mechanical)","Four-bar_linkage","Linkage_(mechanical)","Kinematic_chain","Joint","Robotics","Biomechanics","Satellites","Electrical_engineering","Phased_array","Antenna_(radio)","Beamforming","Radar","Gimbal_lock","Kinematics","Kinematic_pair","Degrees_of_freedom_(physics_and_chemistry)"]}
