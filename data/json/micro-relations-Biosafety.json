{"cursor":"6152","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Biosafety' is the prevention of large-scale loss of biological integrity,\nfocusing both on ecology and human health.\n\nBiosafety is related to several fields:\n\n*In ecology (referring to imported life forms from beyond ecoregion borders),\n*In agriculture (reducing the risk of alien viral or transgenic genes, or prions\nsuch as BSE/\"MadCow\", reducing the risk of food bacterial contamination) *In\nmedicine (referring to organs or tissues from biological origin, or genetic\ntherapy products, virus; levels of lab containment protocols measured as 1, 2,\n3, 4 in rising order of danger), *In chemistry (i.e., nitrates in water, PCB\nlevels affecting fertility) and *In exobiology (i.e., NASA's policy for\ncontaining alien microbes that may exist on space samples - sometimes called\n\"biosafety level 5\").\n\nThe international Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety deals primarily with the\nagricultural definition but many advocacy groups seek to expand it to include\npost-genetic threats: new molecules, artificial life forms, and even robots\nwhich may compete directly in the natural food chain.\n\nBiosafety in agriculture, chemistry, medicine, exobiology and beyond will likely\nrequire application of the precautionary principle, and a new definition focused\non the biological nature of the threatened organism rather than the nature of\nthe threat.\n\nWhen biological warfare or new, currently hypothetical, threats (i.e., robots,\nnew artificial bacteria) are considered, biosafety precautions are generally not\nsufficient. The new field of biosecurity addresses these complex threats.\n\nBiosafety level refers to the stringency of biocontainment precautions deemed\nnecessary by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for laboratory\nwork with infectious materials.\n\nTypically, institutions that experiment with or create potentially harmful\nbiological material will have a committee or board of supervisors that is in\ncharge of the institutions biosafety. They create and monitor the biosafety\nstandards that must be met by labs in order to prevent the accidental release of\npotentially destructive biological material.\n","linknr":144,"url":"Biosafety","recorded":1362505917,"links":23,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.cbd.int/doc/press/presskits/bs/cpbs-unep-cbd-en.pdf","http://www.cbd.int/doc/press/presskits/bs/cpbs-unep-cbd-en.pdf","http://www.ffb.uni-karlsruhe.de/download/IMK_Ber._Nr._149_Kunkelmann_Brandschutz_in_Genlaboren_Teil_1-240.pdf"],"categories":["Genetic engineering","Bioethics","Risk"],"headings":["Biosafety in synthetic biology","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Wikibooks-logo-en-noslogan.svg/40px-Wikibooks-logo-en-noslogan.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Biological_integrity","Ecology","Human_health","Ecology","Ecoregion","Agriculture","Medicine","Biocontainment","Chemistry","Exobiology","Biosafety_level","Cartagena_Protocol_on_Biosafety","Precautionary_principle","Biological_warfare","Biosecurity","Biosafety_level","Biocontainment","Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention","ETC_Group","Quarantine","European_BioSafety_Association","Safe_trade"]}
