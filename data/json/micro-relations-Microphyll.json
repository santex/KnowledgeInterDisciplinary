In the\ndiscipline's 200+ year history, certain concepts have become entrenched, even\nthough improved understanding has threatened the foundations upon which they are\nbased. The traditional definition of microphylls and megaphylls will be\ndiscussed in this article for simplicity; their merits will be discussed later.\n\nTraditionally, a 'microphyll' is \"an appendage supplied by a single, unbranched\nvein\". {{cite journal\n | author = Kaplan, D.R. year = 2001 title = The Science of Plant Morphology:\n | Definition, History, and Role in Modern Biology journal = American Journal of\n | Botany volume = 88 issue = 10 pages = 1711â1741\n\n | doi = 10.2307/3558347 jstor=3558347 pmid = 21669604\n}} Despite their name, microphylls are not always small; those of\n[[IsoÃ«tes]] can reach 20â100 centimetres in length, and the extinct\n[[Lepidodendron]] bore microphylls over a metre long. In the classical concept\nof a microphyll, this vein emerges from the protostele, without leaving a leaf\ngap. Leaf gaps are small areas above the node of some leaves where there is no\nvascular tissue, as it has all been diverted to the leaf. Megaphylls are\ncharacterised by multiple venation. By this definition, the Psilotopsids,\nLycopods and [[Equisetum]] have microphylls, as all extant individuals only bear\na single vascular trace in each leaf. {{cite book\n | author = Gifford E.M. & Foster, A.S. year = 1989 title = Morphology and\n | evolution of vascular plants publisher = WH Freeman, New York, USA\n}}\n","linknr":142,"url":"Microphyll","recorded":1362482752,"links":16,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Plant physiology","Plant anatomy"],"headings":["Evolution of leaves: Microphylls and Megaphylls","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/Vein_sceleton_hydrangea_ies.jpg/220px-Vein_sceleton_hydrangea_ies.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2b/Illustration_Isoetes_lacustris0.jpg/220px-Illustration_Isoetes_lacustris0.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/Psilotum.jpg/220px-Psilotum.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Stele","Psilotopsida","Club_mosses","Enation","Zosterophyll","Telome","Gymnosperm","Psilotum"]}
