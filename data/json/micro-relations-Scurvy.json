The chemical name for vitamin\nC, ascorbic acid, is derived from the Latin name of scurvy, scorbutus, which\nalso provides the adjective 'scorbutic' (\"of, characterized by or having to do\nwith scurvy\"). Scurvy often presents itself initially as symptoms of malaise and\nlethargy, followed by formation of spots on the skin, spongy gums, and bleeding\nfrom the mucous membranes. Spots are most abundant on the thighs and legs, and a\nperson with the ailment looks pale, feels depressed, and is partially\nimmobilized. As scurvy advances, there can be open, suppurating wounds, loss of\nteeth, jaundice, fever, neuropathy and death.\n\nScurvy was at one time common among sailors, pirates and others aboard ships at\nsea longer than perishable fruits and vegetables could be stored (subsisting\ninstead only on cured and salted meats and dried grains) and by soldiers\nsimilarly deprived of these foods for extended periods. It was described by\nHippocrates (c. 460 BCâc. 380 BC), and herbal cures for scurvy have been known\nin many native cultures since prehistory. Scurvy was one of the limiting factors\nof marine travel, often killing large numbers of the passengers and crew on long-\ndistance voyages . This became a significant issue in Europe from the beginning\nof the modern era in the Age of Discovery in the 15th century, continuing to\nplay a significant role through World War I in the 20th century.\n\nWhile today scurvy is known to be caused by a nutritional deficiency, until the\nisolation of vitamin C and direct evidence of its link to scurvy in 1932,\nnumerous theories and treatments were proposed, often on little or no\nexperimental data. This inconsistency is attributed to the lack of vitamin C as\na distinct concept, an inability to reliably link different foods (notably\npresent in fresh citrus, watercress, and organ meat) to scurvy. An additional\nconcept required to understand scurvy was the degradation of vitamin C by\nexposure to air and copper and other transition metal salts such as those of\niron, thus changing the links of foods to scurvy over time.\n\nTreatment by fresh food, particularly citrus fruit, was periodically\nimplemented, as it had been since antiquity. However until the 1930s, treatment\nwas inconsistent, with many ineffective treatments used into the 20th century.\nIt was a Scottish surgeon in the Royal Navy, James Lind who first proved it\ncould be treated with citrus fruit in experiments he described in his 1753 book,\nA Treatise of the Scurvy, though his advice was not\nimplemented by the Royal Navy for several decades .\n\nIn infants, scurvy is sometimes referred to as 'Barlow's disease,' named after\nSir Thomas Barlow, a British physician who described it.\nHowever, Barlow's disease may also refer to mitral valve prolapse. Other eponyms\nfor scurvy include 'Moeller's disease' and 'Cheadle's disease'.\n\nScurvy does not occur in most animals because they can synthesize their own\nvitamin C. However, humans and other higher primates (the simians - monkeys\nand apes - and tarsiers), guinea pigs, most or all bats, and some species of\nbirds and fish lack an enzyme (L-gulonolactone oxidase) necessary for such\nsynthesis and must obtain vitamin C through their diet. Vitamin C is\nwidespread in plant tissues, with particularly high concentrations occurring\nin citrus fruits (oranges, lemons, limes, grapefruits), tomatoes, potatoes,\ncabbages, and green peppers.\n","linknr":629,"url":"Scurvy","recorded":1362481938,"links":69,"instances":["medicine","physician","fruit","food_preservation","drink","1867","1801","fruit"],"pdf":["http://www.who.int//mipfiles/2299/MIP_01_APR_SDE_3.en.pdf","http://www.who.int//mipfiles/2299/MIP_01_APR_SDE_3.en.pdf"],"categories":["Animal diseases","Vitamin deficiencies","Nutritional anemias"],"headings":["Cause","Pathogenesis","Symptoms","Prevention","Treatment","Prognosis","History","In other animals","See also","References","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/Padlock-silver.svg/20px-Padlock-silver.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/Scorbutic_gums.jpg/230px-Scorbutic_gums.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f2/JamesLind.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c8/A_case_of_Scurvy_journal_of_Henry_Walsh_Mahon.jpg/220px-A_case_of_Scurvy_journal_of_Henry_Walsh_Mahon.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["curing","food_preservation"],["james_lind","physician"],["thomas_barlow","medicine"],["orange","fruit"],["lime","citrus_aurantifolia"],["james_lind","physician"],["siege_of_alexandria","1801"],["squash","drink"],["merchant_shipping_act","1867"],["lime","fruit"]],"members":["thomas_barlow","james_lind","orange","curing","squash","merchant_shipping_act","siege_of_alexandria","lime"],"related":["Interdental_papilla","Vitamin_C","Collagen","Mucous_membrane","Suppuration","Sailor","Pirate","Curing_(food_preservation)","Salted_meat","Grain","Hippocrates","Age_of_Discovery","Transition_metal","Scottish_people","Royal_Navy","James_Lind_(physician)","Citrus_fruit","Thomas_Barlow_(medicine)","Physician","Mitral_valve_prolapse","Simian","Tarsier","L-gulonolactone_oxidase","Pasteurization","Breast_milk","Malnutrition","Beriberi","Pellagra","Ascorbic_acid","Hydroxylation","Amidation","Collagen","Prolyl_hydroxylase","Lysyl_hydroxylase","Proline","Lysine","Hydroxyproline","Hydroxylysine","Malaise","Lethargy","Myalgia","Carnitine","Petechiae","Gum_disease","Sjögren's_syndrome","Jaundice","Edema","Neuropathy","Orange_(fruit)","Lemons","Vitamin_C","Blackcurrants","Guava","Kiwifruit","Papaya","Tomatoes","Bell_peppers","Strawberries","Carrots","Broccoli","Potatoes","Cabbage","Spinach","Paprika","Pickled","Lemon_juice","Candy","Soft_drink","Liver","Muktuk","Oysters","Adrenal_medulla","Hippocrates","Crusades","Vasco_de_Gama","Jacques_Cartier","Saint_Lawrence_River","Thuja","Sailor","Richard_Hawkins","John_Woodall","British_East_India_Company","Sulfuric_acid","Gloucestershire","Leiden","Johann_Bachstrom","Lemon","Lime_(Citrus_aurantifolia)","Ration","Rum","Grog","Edward_Vernon","Vitamin_C","James_Lind_(physician)","Clinical_trial","George_Anson,_1st_Baron_Anson","Seven_Years'_War","James_Cook","HM_Bark_Endeavour","Sauerkraut","Wort","Alessandro_Malaspina","Guam","Spanish_Empire","American_Revolution","Sick_and_Hurt_Board","Gilbert_Blane","Napoleonic_Wars","Battle_of_Trafalgar","Napoleon","Siege_of_Alexandria_(1801)","Dominique-Jean_Larrey","Horse_meat","Béraud","Musée_des_Familles","Squash_(drink)","Rose's_lime_juice","Merchant_Shipping_Act_(1867)","Royal_Navy","Merchant_Navy","Lime_(fruit)","Limey","Arctic","Robert_Falcon_Scott","Antarctic","Vilhjalmur_Stefansson","Bellevue_Hospital","Ross_Sea","Axel_Holst","Theodor_Frølich","Norway","Beriberi","Pigeon","Guinea_pig","Hungary","Biochemist","Szent-Györgyi","Nobel_Prize","Hexuronic_acid","Antioxidant","Adrenal_cortex","Charles_Glen_King","University_of_Pittsburgh","Chiroptera","Primate","Haplorrhini","Strepsirrhini","Lemur","Lorises","Potto","Galago","Caviidae","Capybara","Guinea_pig","List_of_cutaneous_conditions","Cambridge_University_Press"]}
