{"cursor":"6754","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'On Physical Lines of Force' is a famous four-part paper written by James Clerk\nMaxwell published between 1861 and 1862. http://www.manhattanrarebooks-\nscience.com/maxwell.lines.of.force.htm In it, Maxwell derived the\nequations of electromagnetism in conjunction with a \"sea\" of \"molecular\nvortices\" which he used to model Faraday's lines of force. Maxwell had studied\nand commented on the field of electricity and magnetism as early as 1855/6 when\n'On Faraday's lines of\nforce' [http://www.blazelabs.com/On%20Faraday's%20Lines%20of%20Force.pdf On\nFaradayâs Lines of Forceâ byJames Clerk Maxwell 1855] was read to the\nCambridge Philosophical Society. Maxwell made an analogy between the density of\nthis medium and the magnetic permeability, as well as an analogy between the\ntransverse elasticity and the dielectric constant, and using the results of a\nprior experiment by Wilhelm Eduard Weber and Rudolf Kohlrausch performed in\n1856, he established a connection between the speed of light and the speed of\npropagation of waves in this medium.\n\nThe paper ushered in a new era of classical electrodynamics and catalyzed\nfurther progress in the mathematical field of vector calculus. Because of this,\nit is considered one of the most historically significant publications in the\nfield of physics and of science in general, comparable with Einstein's [[Annus\nMirabilis papers]] and Newton's [[PhilosophiÃ¦ Naturalis Principia\nMathematica|Principia Mathematica]].\n","linknr":151,"url":"On_Physical_Lines_of_Force","recorded":1362485607,"links":13,"instances":["journal"],"pdf":["http://www.blazelabs.com/On%20Faraday's%20Lines%20of%20Force.pdf"],"categories":["Physics papers","History of physics","1861 in science","1862 in science","Works originally published in Philosophical Magazine"],"headings":["Motivations","Impact","See also","References","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/math/3/c/1/3c11bec2b5fe4b3ce1901bdf87b2742e.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/Office-book.svg/30px-Office-book.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["science","journal"]],"members":["science"],"related":["James_Clerk_Maxwell","Maxwell's_equations","Molecule","Vortex","Cambridge_Philosophical_Society","Weber–Kohlrausch_Leyden_jar_experiment","Wilhelm_Eduard_Weber","Rudolf_Kohlrausch","Vector_calculus","Wilhelm_Eduard_Weber","Rudolf_Kohlrausch","Leyden_jar","Electric_charge","Electrostatics","Electrodynamics","Isaac_Newton","Speed_of_sound","Speed_of_light","Hippolyte_Fizeau","Dictionary_of_Scientific_Biography","Charles_Scribner's_Sons","Displacement_current","Ampère's_circuital_law","A_Dynamical_Theory_of_the_Electromagnetic_Field","Electromagnetic_wave_equation","Maxwell's_equations","Oliver_Heaviside","Nabla_symbol","William_Rowan_Hamilton","Albert_Einstein","Science_(journal)","Richard_Feynman","W._W._Norton_&_Company","Maxwell's_equations","Philosophical_Magazine","John_Wiley_&_Sons","Encyclopædia_Britannica_Ninth_Edition"]}
