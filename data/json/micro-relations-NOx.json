{"cursor":"16067","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n'NO x' is a generic term for mono-nitrogen oxides NO and\nNO 2 (nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide). They are produced from the\nreaction of nitrogen and oxygen gases in the air during combustion, especially\nat high temperatures. In areas of high motor vehicle traffic, such as in large\ncities, the amount of nitrogen oxides emitted into the atmosphere as air\npollution can be significant. NO x gases are formed everywhere where\nthere is combustion â like in an engine. In atmospheric chemistry, the term\nmeans the total concentration of NO and NO 2. NO x react to\nform smog and acid rain. NO x are also central to the formation of\ntropospheric ozone.\n\nNO x should not be confused with nitrous oxide (N 2O),\nwhich is a greenhouse gas and has many uses as an oxidizer, an anesthetic, and\na food additive.\n\n'NO y' (reactive, odd nitrogen) is defined as the sum of\nNO x plus the compounds produced from the oxidation of NO x\nwhich include nitric acid.\n","linknr":246,"url":"NOx","recorded":1362500085,"links":17,"instances":["soil","engines","chemistry"],"pdf":["http://web.archive.org/web/20080716063437/http://www.epa.gov/air/urbanair/nox/noxfldr.pdf","http://www.epa.gov/air/urbanair/nox/noxfldr.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20080716063437/http://www.epa.gov/air/urbanair/nox/noxfldr.pdf"],"categories":["Oxides","Pollutants","Smog"],"headings":["Formation and reactions","Sources","Health effects","Regulation and emission control technologies","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["fertilization","soil"],["radical","chemistry"],["water_injection","engines"]],"members":["fertilization","water_injection","radical"],"related":["Nitric_oxide","Nitrogen_dioxide","Nitrogen","Oxygen","Combustion","Air_pollution","Atmospheric_chemistry","Smog","Acid_rain","Tropospheric_ozone","Nitrous_oxide","Greenhouse_gas","Nitrous","Anesthetic","Food_additive","Odd_molecule","Nitric_acid","Endothermic","Oxide","Internal_combustion_engine","Boiler","Atmospheric_chemistry","Chemical_equilibrium","Sunshine","Ozone","Nitric_oxide","Nitrogen_dioxide","Volatile_organic_compound","Smog","Asthma","Nitric_acid","Acid_rain","Nitric_oxide","Oxidize","Tropospheric","Ozone","Nitrate","Nitric_oxide","Thunderstorm","Lightning","Agricultural","Fertilization_(soil)","Nitrogen_fixing","Nitrogen_fixation","Combustion","Residence_time","Yakov_Borisovich_Zel'dovich","Radical_(chemistry)","Charring","Nitrogen_monohydride","Hydrogen_cyanide","Dihydrogen_cyanide","Cyano","Ammonia","Nitric_acid","Emphysema","Bronchitis","Volatile_organic_compounds","Ozone","Ozone_layer","Ultraviolet_light","Photolysis","Nitrous_oxide","Nitroarenes","Nitrosamines","Nitrate_radical","Mutations","United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency","Department_for_Environment,_Food_and_Rural_Affairs","Flameless_oxidation","FLOX","Staged_combustion","LO-NOx_burner","Water_injection_(engines)","Selective_catalytic_reduction","Selective_non-catalytic_reduction","Exhaust_gas_recirculation","Catalytic_converter","Automobile_emissions_control"]}
