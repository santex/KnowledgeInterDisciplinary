{"cursor":"4697","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Fort Simple' was built in Topeka, Kansas, as a result of Maj. Gen. Sterling\nPrice's Missouri Raid in the late summer and fall of 1864 (see Price's Raid).\nTopeka had become the permanent capital of the State of Kansas in 1861, but no\nfortifications had been built to protect the city from guerrilla bands, which\nroamed eastern Kansas. Even the raid and massacre in August 1863 in Lawrence,\nKansas (see Lawrence Massacre), did not result in a fort being built to protect\nthe capital, although plans had been made to build one by July 1864. Maj.\nGen. Samuel R. Curtis, report, The War of the Rebellion (Washington: Government\nPrinting Office, 1883), Series I, Vol. XLI, Part II, p. 102.\n\nOn October 8, 1864, Gov. Thomas Carney called the state militia to defend Kansas\nagainst Price's Confederates. The 2nd Regiment, based in Shawnee County (where\nTopeka was located), was sent to western Missouri to meet Price's force. A group\nof 292 men were also organized into a home regiment to guard Topeka. The men\npossessed one cannon, probably a mountain howitzer (see Mountain gun). Fry\nGiles, Thirty Years in Topeka: a Historical Sketch (Topeka: Capper Special\nServices, 1960), 1960 ed., p. 129.\n\nThe home regiment, led by Maj. Andrew Stark, built a stockade in the middle of\nthe intersection of 6th and Kansas Avenues and two sets of trenches on the east\nside of town. The stockade, which until after the Civil War had no name, was in\nthe Topeka business district. Someone after the War called the structure Fort\nSimple and the name stuck. Both 6th and Kansas Avenues were wide streets and\nKansas Avenue was at the top of a ridge that ran from 5th to 11th Streets.\nTherefore the view from the fort commanded the surrounding countryside. The\ntemporary State Capitol was on Kansas Avenue just north of 5th\nStreet. Giles, pp. 129-30; George A. Root, \"Fort Folly--Fort Simple Topeka,\"\ninterview with Freeman Sardou, December 4, 1917, Topeka, p. 1 (from the\nManuscript Div. of the Kansas State Historical Society, Topeka); \"Echoes of\nPrice's Raid,\" The Topeka State Journal, November 2, 1934, p. 7; William C.\nPollard, Jr., \"Forts and Military Posts in Kansas: 1854-1865\" (Ph.D.\ndissertation, Faith Baptist College and Seminary, 1997), p. 67 (a copy can be\nfound in the Manuscript Div. of the KSHS, Topeka).\n\nSimple was a circular stockade. The walls consisted of cottonwood logs sixteen\nfeet long and split in half. The bark side faced the fort's outside. The logs\nwere driven into the ground until only the top ten feet of them stood above\nground. Fort Simple was forty to fifty feet in diameter. A flagpole in the\ncenter of the fort was erected.\n\nThe mountain howitzer was kept inside the fort and a port was cut in the east,\nwest, south and north sides to allow it to be moved and fired. Notches for\nrifles were located completely around the fort. George A. Root claimed two\nnotches were cut between each erect log, so one man could fire standing while\nanother could fire kneeling. A wooden gate on the fort's west side was the only\nentrance to Fort Simple. No part of this fort had a roof, so it was completely\nopen to the weather. Root, p. 1; \"Once Stockade Now Busy Spot in Topeka,\"\nTopeka Daily Capital, August 18, 1940, p. 17B.\n\nThe home battalion guarded Topeka while the rest of the 2nd Regiment was east\nengaging Price's men. On October 23, in the evening, news reached Topeka that\nthe Union forces had been crushed in the Battle of Westport, waged in what is\nnow part of Kansas City. The entire city was in a state of panic and 350 armed\nmen manned the trenches and Fort Simple through the night, expected an attack.\nIn the morning a lone horseman raced into Topeka with the news that Price, not\nthe Union forces, had been defeated.\n\nThe fort was used to defend Topeka until almost the end of the Civil War. In\nApril and July 1865 the Topeka city council took actions to make the fort appear\nmore attractive, since it was no longer used. In April 1867 it was decided Fort\nSimple had become an unsightly relic and it was torn down. In 1929 a bronze\ntablet was laid on the southwest corner of the intersection to honor Fort\nSimple's memory. In 1995 this tablet was removed during construction and not\nreplaced.
