Preferences have a (continuous) utility representation so\nlong as they are transitive, complete, and continuous.\n\nUtility is usually applied by economists in such constructs as the indifference\ncurve, which plot the combination of commodities that an individual or a society\nwould accept to maintain a given level of satisfaction. Individual utility and\nsocial utility can be construed as the value of a utility function and a social\nwelfare function respectively. When coupled with production or commodity\nconstraints, under some assumptions, these functions can be used to analyze\nPareto efficiency, such as illustrated by Edgeworth boxes in contract curves.\nSuch efficiency is a central concept in welfare economics.\n\nIn finance, utility is applied to generate an individual's price for an asset\ncalled the indifference price. Utility functions are also related to risk\nmeasures, with the most common example being the entropic risk measure.\n","title":"utility","headings":["Quantifying utility","Cardinal and ordinal utility","Expected utility","Money","Discussion and criticism","See also","References","Further reading","External links"]},"micro-relation":["2: Economics","2: Cardinal_utility","2: Constant_elasticity_of_substitution","2: Exponential_utility","1: Indifference_curve","1: Social_welfare_function","1: Pareto_efficiency","1: Edgeworth_box","1: Contract_curve","1: Welfare_economics","1: Finance","1: Asset","1: Indifference_price","1: Risk_measure","1: Entropic_risk_measure","1: Paul_Samuelson","1: Ordinal_utility","1: Neoclassical_economics","1: Up_to","1: Preference","1: Microeconomics","1: If_and_only_if","1: Quasilinear_utility","1: Homothetic_preferences","1: Lexicographic_preferences","1: Nicolaus_I_Bernoulli","1: Daniel_Bernoulli","1: St._Petersburg_paradox","1: Risk_aversion","1: John_von_Neumann","1: Oskar_Morgenstern","1: Game_theory","1: Law_of_diminishing_returns","1: Preference_relation","1: Generalized_expected_utility","1: Constant_relative_risk_aversion","1: Constant_absolute_risk_aversion","1: Bounded_function","1: Economists","1: Decision_theory","1: Rational_choice_theory","1: Concave_function","1: Diminishing_marginal_utility","1: Joan_Robinson","1: Evolutionary_psychology"]}
