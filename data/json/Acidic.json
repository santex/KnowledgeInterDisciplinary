{"cursor":"32879","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n, a typical metal, reacting with hydrochloric acid, a typical acid]] An\n'acid' (from the Latin acidus/acÄre meaning sour [http://www.merriam-\nwebster.com/dictionary/acid Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary:\nacid] ) is a substance which reacts with a base. Commonly, acids can be\nidentified as tasting sour, reacting with metals such as calcium, and bases\nlike sodium carbonate. Aqueous acids have a pH under 7, with acidity\nincreasing the lower the pH. Chemicals or substances having the property of\nan acid are said to be 'acidic'.\n\nCommon examples of acids include acetic acid (in vinegar), sulfuric acid (used\nin car batteries), and tartaric acid (used in baking). As these three examples\nshow, acids can be solutions, liquids, or solids. Gases such as hydrogen\nchloride can be acids as well when dissolved in water. Strong acids and some\nconcentrated weak acids are corrosive, but there are exceptions such as\ncarboranes and boric acid.\n\nThere are three common definitions for acids: the Arrhenius definition, the BrÃ¸nsted-\nLowry definition, and the Lewis definition. The Arrhenius definition states that\nacids are substances which increase the concentration of hydronium ions\n(H 3O +) in solution. The BrÃ¸nsted-Lowry definition is an\nexpansion: an acid is a substance which can act as a proton donor. Most acids\nencountered in everyday life are aqueous solutions, or can be dissolved in\nwater, and these two definitions are most relevant. The reason why pHs of acids\nare less than 7 is that the concentration of hydronium ions is greater than\n10 â7 moles per liter. Since pH is defined as the negative logarithm\nof the concentration of hydronium ions, acids thus have pHs of less than 7. By\nthe BrÃ¸nsted-Lowry definition, any compound which can easily be deprotonated can\nbe considered an acid. Examples include alcohols and amines which contain O-H or\nN-H fragments.\n\nIn chemistry, the Lewis definition of acidity is frequently encountered. Lewis\nacids are electron-pair acceptors. Examples of Lewis acids include all metal\ncations, and electron-deficient molecules such as boron trifluoride and\naluminium trichloride. Hydronium ions are acids according to all three\ndefinitions. Interestingly, although alcohols and amines can be BrÃ¸nsted-Lowry\nacids as mentioned above, they can also function as Lewis bases due to the lone\npairs of electrons on their oxygen and nitrogen atoms.\n","linknr":567,"url":"Acidic","recorded":1362372412,"links":128,"instances":["chemistry","chemistry","metal","physiology","chemistry","glassware","chemistry","unit","chemistry"],"pdf":["http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic776365.files/lecture%2017.pdf"],"categories":["Acids|","Acid-base
