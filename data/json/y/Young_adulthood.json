A 'young/prime adult', according to Erik\nErikson's stages of human development, is generally a person in the age range of\n20 to 40, whereas an adolescent is a person aging from 13 to\n19, although definitions and opinions vary. The young\nadult stage in human development precedes middle adulthood. A person in the\nmiddle adulthood stage ages from 40 to 64. In maturity, a person is 65 years old\nor older.
