{"cursor":"10011","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\n]] An 'egg yolk' is a part of an egg which feeds the developing embryo. The egg\nyolk is suspended in the egg white (known alternatively as albumen or\nglair/glaire) by one or two spiral bands of tissue called the chalazae. Prior to\nfertilization, the yolk together with the germinal disc is a single cell, one of\nthe few single cells that can be seen by the naked eye.\n\nAs a food, yolks are a major source of vitamins and minerals. They contain all\nof the egg's fat and cholesterol, and about one-half of the protein. If left\nintact while cooking fried eggs, the yellow yolk surrounded by a flat blob of\nwhites creates the distinctive sunny-side up form of the food. Mixing the two\ncomponents together before frying results in the pale yellow form found in\nomelettes and scrambled eggs.\n","linknr":310,"url":"Yolk","recorded":1362503001,"links":63,"instances":["poultry","biology","food"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Eggs"],"headings":["Uses","Composition of chicken egg yolk","Yolk proteins","Double-yolk eggs","Yolkless eggs","Yolk color","Gallery","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/Raw_egg.jpg/220px-Raw_egg.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2b/Red_Yolk_C.jpg/120px-Red_Yolk_C.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/cd/Double_egg_yolk.jpg/120px-Double_egg_yolk.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Wikibooks-logo-en-noslogan.svg/40px-Wikibooks-logo-en-noslogan.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["egg","biology"],["cell","biology"],["egg","food"],["bantam","poultry"]],"members":["bantam","cell","egg"],"related":["Egg_(biology)","Embryo","Chalaza","Germinal_disc","Cell_(biology)","Egg_(food)","Vitamin","Fat","Cholesterol","Protein","Fried_egg","Omelette","Scrambled_eggs","Separating_eggs","Mayonnaise","Custard","Hollandaise_sauce","Tempera","Agar_plate","Antibody","IgY","Passive_immunity","Advocaat","Eggnog","Egg_oil","Choline","Cholesterol","Vitamin_A","Vitamin_D","Vitamin_E","Vitamin_K","Oleic_acid","Linoleic_acid","Palmitoleic_acid","Î‘-Linolenic_acid","Palmitic_acid","Stearic_acid","Myristic_acid","Lecithin","Egg_oil","Lutein","Zeaxanthin","Carotenoids","Xanthophyll","Phosvitin","Calcium","Iron","Phosphorilation","Heredity","Buff_Orpington","Bantam_(poultry)","Guineafowl","Coturnix","Cock_egg","Exploratorium","Society_of_Painters_in_Tempera"]}
