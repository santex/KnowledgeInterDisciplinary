'Youth development' overall is the physical, social, and\nemotional processes that occur during the adolescent period, from ages 10 until\n24 years. Simply speaking, it is the process through which young people acquire\nthe cognitive, social, and emotional skills and abilities required to navigate\nlife ([http://www.extension.umn.edu/distribution/youthdevelopment/DA6715.html\nUniversity of Minnesota Extension Center for Youth Development]). Although the\nword 'youth' can be used synonymously with 'child', 'adolescent', or 'young\nperson', the phrase 'youth development' or 'positive youth development' is\nusually used in the scientific literature and by practitioners who work with\nyouth to refer to programs designed to optimize these processes. It\nis distinguished from 'child development' or 'adolescent development' in its\nfocus on the active promotion of optimal human development, rather than on the\nscientific study of age related change.\n","linknr":178,"url":"Youth_development","recorded":1362477545,"links":12,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.wtgrantfoundation.org/File%20Library/Publications/Maximizing-Mentoring-Booklet.pdf"],"categories":["Youth development organizations","Youth|D"],"headings":["Importance of youth development","Key characteristics","Practices and current directions","Using positive youth development","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Youth","Adult","Child_development","Boys_and_Girls_Clubs_of_America","Ecological_Systems_Theory","Richard_M._Lerner","Forum_for_Youth_Investment","The_European_Knowledge_Centre_for_Youth_Policy","Australian_Clearinghouse_for_Youth_Studies","Administration_for_Children_and_Families","U.S._Department_of_Health_and_Human_Services","Peace_Corps","Community_youth_development","Community_Psychology"]}
