It is equal to 3 feet or 36 inches. Under an agreement in 1959 between\nAustralia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, the United Kingdom and the United\nStates, the yard (known as the \"international yard\" in the United States) was\nlegally defined to be exactly 0.9144 metres.<ref name=\"Astin\">A.
