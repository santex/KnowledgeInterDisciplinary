{"cursor":"28610","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n at the Tower of London in England]] 'Yeoman' refers chiefly to a free man\n owning his own farm, especially from the Elizabethan era to the 17th century.\n Work requiring a great deal of effort or labour, such as would be done by a\n yeoman farmer, came to be described as 'yeoman's work'. Thus yeoman\n became associated with hard toil.\n\nYeoman was also a rank or position in a noble household, with titles such as\nYeoman of the Chamber, Yeoman of the Crown, Yeoman Usher, and King's Yeoman.\nMost of these, including the Yeomen of the Guard, had the duty of protecting the\nsovereign and other dignitaries as a bodyguard, and carrying out various duties\nfor the sovereign as assigned to his office.\n\nIn modern British usage, yeoman may specifically refer to\n* a member of a reserve military unit called a yeomanry, similar to the militia,\n  traditionally raised from moderately wealthy commoners in England and Wales,\n  and today part of the Territorial Army;\n* a member of the Yeomen of the Guard\n* a member of the Yeomen Warders of the Tower of London\n* a non-commissioned officer usually with the rank of staff sergeant or Warrant\n  Officer Class 1 in the Royal Corps of Signals in the British Army, an\n  appointment achieved upon completion of a 14-month technical course.\n\nIn the United States Navy and United States Coast Guard, a yeoman is a rating\nusually with secretarial, clerical, payroll or other administrative duties. The\nfirst women in the U.S. Navy were Yeomen in World War I. http://www.npc.nav-\ny.mil/Enlisted/CommunityManagers/Administration/Yeoman.htm\n\nIn the Royal Navy, the Royal Canadian Navy, the Royal Australian Navy, and other\nmaritime forces which follow British naval tradition, a Yeoman of Signals is a\nsignalling and tactical communications petty officer.\n","linknr":421,"url":"Yeoman_farmer","recorded":1362374977,"links":33,"instances":["region","servant","class","historic","military","title","division","country_subdivision","united_kingdom","law","christianity","unit","f","class"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Agrarianism","History
