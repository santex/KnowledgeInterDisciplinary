Researchers have used it to gather information about\nthe biology of the eukaryotic cell and ultimately human biology.<ref\nname=Ostergaard/> Other species of yeasts, such as [[Candida albicans]], are\nopportunistic pathogens and can cause infections in humans. Yeasts have recently\nbeen used to generate electricity in microbial fuel cells,<ref\nname=\"YeastRef3\"/> and produce ethanol for the biofuel industry.\n\nYeasts do not form a single taxonomic or phylogenetic grouping. The term \"yeast\"\nis often taken as a synonym for Saccharomyces cerevisiae,<ref\nname=Kurtzman1994/> but the phylogenetic diversity of yeasts is shown by their\nplacement in two separate phyla: the Ascomycota and the Basidiomycota.
