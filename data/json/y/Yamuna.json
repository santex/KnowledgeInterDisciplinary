Originating\n from the Yamunotri Glacier at a height of 6,387 metres on the south western\n slopes of Banderpooch peaks in the Lower Himalayas in Uttarakhand, it travels a\n total length of and has a drainage system of , 40.2% of the entire Ganges\n Basin, before merging with the Ganges at Triveni Sangam, Allahabad, the site\n for the Kumbha Mela every twelve years.\n\nIt crosses several states, Uttarakhand, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, passing by\nHimachal Pradesh and later Delhi, and meets several of its tributaries on the\nway, including Tons, its largest and longest tributary in Uttarakhand, Chambal,\nwhich has its own large basin, followed by Sindh, the Betwa, and Ken. Most\nimportantly it creates the highly fertile alluvial, Yamuna-Ganges Doab region\nbetween itself and the Ganges in the Indo-Gangetic plain. Nearly 57 million\npeople depend on the Yamuna waters. With an annual flow of about 10,000 cubic\nbillion metres (cbm) and usage of 4,400 cbm (of which irrigation constitutes 96\nper cent), the river accounts for more than 70 per cent of Delhiâs water\nsupplies. Just like the Ganges, the Yamuna too is highly venerated in Hinduism\nand worshipped as goddess Yamuna, throughout its course. In Hindu mythology, she\nis the daughter of Sun God, Surya, and sister of Yama, the God of Death, hence\nalso known as Yami and according to popular legends, bathing in its sacred\nwaters frees one from the torments of death.\n\nThe water of Yamuna is of \"reasonably good quality\" through its length from\nYamunotri in the Himalayas to Wazirabad in Delhi, about 375 km, where the\ndischarge of waste water through 15 drains between Wazirabad barrage and Okhla\nbarrage renders the river severely polluted after Wazirabad in Delhi. One\nofficial describes the river as a \"sewage drain\" with biochemical oxygen demand\n(BOD) values ranging from 14 to 28 mg/l and high coliform\ncontent. There are three main sources of pollution in the river,\nnamely households and municipal disposal sites, soil erosion resulting from\ndeforestation occurring to make way for agriculture along with resulting\nchemical wash-off from fertilizers, herbicides, and pesticides and run-off from\ncommercial activity and industrial sites.\n","linknr":976,"url":"Yamuna","recorded":1362481880,"links":92,"instances":["time","uttarakhand","hinduism","geomorphology","disambiguation","india"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Yamuna
