{"cursor":"1585","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'H2A histone family, member B3' is a protein that in humans is encoded by the\nH2AFB3 gene.\n\nHistones are basic nuclear proteins that are responsible for the nucleosome\nstructure of the chromosomal fiber in eukaryotes. Nucleosomes consist of\napproximately 146 bp of DNA wrapped around a histone octamer composed of pairs\nof each of the four core histones (H2A, H2B, H3, and H4). The chromatin fiber is\nfurther compacted through the interaction of a linker histone, H1, with the DNA\nbetween the nucleosomes to form higher order chromatin structures. This gene\nencodes a member of the histone H2A family. This gene is part of a region that\nis repeated three times on chromosome X, once in intron 22 of the F8 gene and\ntwice closer to the Xq telomere. This record represents the most telomeric copy.\n[provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008].\n","linknr":167,"url":"H2AFB3","recorded":1362481029,"links":22,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":[],"headings":["References","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/DNA_stub.png/40px-DNA_stub.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Protein","Gene"]}
