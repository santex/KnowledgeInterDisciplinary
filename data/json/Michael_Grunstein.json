He did his post-doctoral\ntraining at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California, where he invented the\ncolony hybridization screening technique for recombinant DNAs in David Hogness'\nlaboratory.\n\nSoon after coming to UCLA in 1975, Grunstein pioneered the genetic analysis of\nhistones in yeast and showed for the first time that histones are regulators of\ngene activity in living cells. His studies were among the most influential to\ncounter the prevailing belief in the 1980s that eukaryotic genes, like\npreviously studied bacterial genes, were predominantly subjected to\ntranscriptional activation. His laboratory's studies provided inspiration for\nthe eukaryotic histone code and underlie the modern study of epigenetics.\n\nHe received the Massry Prize in 2003 (with Roger Kornberg and David Allis). In\nApril 2008, Grunstein was elected into the National Academy of Sciences.\n","linknr":143,"url":"Michael_Grunstein","recorded":1362481133,"links":19,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["1946 births","Living people","American biologists","Jewish American scientists","McGill University alumni","Alumni of the University of Edinburgh","University of California, Los Angeles faculty","Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences","American people of Romanian descent"],"headings":["See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f3/Mgrunstein.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Romania","Biological_Chemistry","David_Geffen_School_of_Medicine_at_UCLA","McGill_University","University_of_Edinburgh","Romania","Biological_Chemistry","David_Geffen_School_of_Medicine_at_UCLA","Bachelor_of_Science","McGill_University","Montreal","PhD","University_of_Edinburgh","Scotland","Post-doctoral","Stanford_University","Palo_Alto,_California","Recombinant_DNA","UCLA","Histone","Yeast","Living_cells","Histone_code","Epigenetics","Roger_Kornberg","David_Allis","United_States_National_Academy_of_Sciences","List_of_members_of_the_National_Academy_of_Sciences","University_of_California,_Los_Angeles"]}
