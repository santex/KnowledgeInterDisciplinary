The term comes from the Greek psílōsis (\"smoothing, thinning\nout\") and is related to the name of the smooth breathing (ψιλή ), the sign for\nthe absence of initial in a word. Dialects that have lost are called 'psilotic'.\n\nThe linguistic phenomenon is comparable to that of h-dropping in dialects of\nModern English, and to the development by which /h/ was lost in late Latin.\n",
