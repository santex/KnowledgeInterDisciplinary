{"cursor":"71166","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n and Kappa Alpha Order fraternities at Bowling Green State University.]]\n\n'Fraternities and sororities' (from the Latin words {{lang|la|frater}} and\n{{lang|la|soror}}, meaning \"brother\" and \"sister\" respectively) are fraternal\nsocial organizations for undergraduate students. The term refers mainly to such\norganizations at colleges and universities in the United States, although it is\nalso applied to analogous European groups also known as corporations. Similar,\nbut less common, organizations also exist for secondary school students. In\nmodern usage, the term \"Greek letter organization\" is often synonymous in North\nAmerica, with the terms \"fraternity\" and \"sorority\".\n\nTypically, Greek letter organizations are sex-based initiatory organizations.\nMembership is typically considered active during the undergraduate years only,\nalthough a notable exception to this rule are historically black, Latino, Asian,\nand multicultural organizations, in which active membership continues, and into\nwhich members are often initiated long after the completion of their\nundergraduate degrees. As with Freemasonry, Greek letter organizations may\nsometimes be considered mutual aid societies, providing academic and social\nactivities. Some groups also maintain a chapter house, providing residential and\ndining facilities for members.\n","linknr":782,"url":"Fraternities_and_sororities","recorded":1362477138,"links":33,"instances":["university","social","tv_series","wesleyan","new_york","politician","film","university","west_virginia","education","film","sar","tv_series","spanking","fraternity"],"pdf":["http://eric.ed.gov/PDFS/ED381054.pdf","http://www.fraternityadvisors.org/Uploads/PublicDocuments/Oracle_vol2_iss2_Pascarella.pdf","http://new.oberlin.edu/students/policies/2011-2012/0-OberlinRulesRegs2011_12.pdf","http://new.oberlin.edu/students/policies/2011-2012/0-OberlinRulesRegs2011_12.pdf"],"categories":["Fraternities
