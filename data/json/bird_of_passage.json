      "text" : "\n during autumn migration]]\n\n\n'Bird migration' is the regular seasonal movement, often north and south along a\nflyway between breeding and wintering grounds, undertaken by many species of\nbirds. Migration, which carries high costs in predation and mortality, including\nfrom hunting by humans, is driven primarily by availability of food. Migration\noccurs mainly in the Northern Hemisphere where birds are funnelled on to\nspecific routes by natural barriers such as the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nHistorically, migration has been recorded as much as 3,000 years ago by Ancient\nGreek authors including Homer and Aristotle, and in the Book of Job, for species\nsuch as storks, Turtle Doves, and swallows. More recently, Johannes Leche began\nrecording dates of arrivals of spring migrants in Finland in 1749, and\nscientific studies have used techniques including bird ringing and satellite\ntracking. Threats to migratory birds have grown with habitat destruction\nespecially of stopover and wintering sites, as well as structures such as power\nlines and wind farms.\n\nThe Arctic Tern holds the long-distance migration record for birds, travelling\nbetween Arctic breeding grounds and the Antarctic each year. Some species of\ntubenoses (Procellariiformes) such as albatrosses circle the earth, flying over\nthe southern oceans, while others such as Manx Shearwaters migrate between their\nnorthern breeding grounds and the southern ocean. Shorter migrations are common,\nincluding altitudinal migrations on mountains such as the Andes and Himalayas.\n\nThe timing of migration is controlled primarily by changes in day length.\nMigrating birds navigate using celestial cues from the sun and stars, the\nearth's magnetic field, and probably also mental maps. Migration has\ndeveloped independently in different groups of birds and does not appear to\nrequire genetic change; some birds have acquired migratory behaviour since\nthe last ice age.\n",
