[http://www.iom.edu/About-IOM.aspx iom.edu About]\nThe IOM is part of the United States National Academies, which also includes:\n* National Academy of Sciences (NAS)\n* National Academy of Engineering (NAE)\n* National Research Council (NRC)\n\nIts purpose is to provide national advice on issues relating to biomedical\nscience, medicine, and health, and its mission to serve as adviser to the nation\nto improve health. It works outside the framework of the U.S. federal government\nto provide independent guidance and analysis and relies on a volunteer workforce\nof scientists and other experts, operating under a rigorous, formal peer-review\nsystem. The Institute provides unbiased, evidence-based, and authoritative\ninformation and advice concerning health and science policy to policy-makers,\nprofessionals, leaders in every sector of society, and the public at large.\n\nAs a national academy, new members of the organization are elected annually\nby current members, based on their distinguished and continuing\nachievements in a field relevant to the IOM's mission as well as for their\nwillingness to participate actively in its work. The President of the IOM\nis Dr. Harvey V. Fineberg, M.D., Ph.D.; the Executive Officer is Dr. Judith\nA.
