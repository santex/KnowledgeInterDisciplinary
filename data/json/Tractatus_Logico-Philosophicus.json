It was an ambitious project: to\nidentify the relationship between language and reality and to define the limits\nof science. TLP 4.113 It is recognized as a significant philosophical\nwork of the twentieth century. G. E. Moore originally suggested the work's Latin\ntitle as homage to [[Theologico-Political Treatise|Tractatus Theologico-\nPoliticus]] by Baruch Spinoza. Nils-Eric Sahlin, The Philosophy of F. P.\nRamsey (1990), p. 227.\n\nWittgenstein wrote the notes for Tractatus while he was a soldier during World\nWar I and completed it when a prisoner of war at Como and later Cassino in\nAugust 1918. Monk p.158 It was first published in German in 1921 as\nLogisch-Philosophische Abhandlung. Tractatus was influential chiefly amongst the\nlogical positivists of the Vienna Circle, such as Rudolf Carnap and Friedrich\nWaismann. Bertrand Russell's article \"The Philosophy of Logical Atomism\" is\npresented as a working out of ideas that he had learnt from\nWittgenstein. Bertrand Russell (1918), \"The Philosophy of Logical Atomism\".\nThe Monist. p. 177, as published, for example in [http://www.hist-\nanalytic.com/RussellLAfacts.pdf Bertrand Russell (Robert Charles Marsh ed.)\nLogic and Knowledge] Accessed 2010-01-29.\n\nTractatus employs a notoriously austere and succinct literary style. The work\ncontains almost no arguments as such, but, rather, consists of declarative\nstatements which are meant to be self-evident. The statements are hierarchically\nnumbered, with seven basic propositions at the primary level (numbered 1â7),\nwith each sub-level being a comment on or elaboration of the statement at the\nnext higher level (e.g., 1, 1.1, 1.11, 1.12).\n\nWittgenstein's later works, notably the posthumously published [[Philosophical\nInvestigations]], criticised many of the ideas in Tractatus.\n","recorded":1362124409,"portal":[],"list":[],"links":"447","instances":["linguistics","information_science","logic","mathematics","linguistics","semiotics","philosophy","mathematics","linguistics","philosopher","software","dialogue","logic","computer","philosophy","wittgenstein","philosophy","philosopher","film","philosophy"],"pdf":["http://www.hist-analytic.com/RussellLAfacts.pdf"],"categories":["1921 books","Analytic philosophy literature","Books by Ludwig Wittgenstein","Cognitive science literature","Contemporary philosophy","Logic books","Philosophical logic","Philosophy books","Philosophy of language literature","Prison writings"],"headings":["Main theses","Reception and influence","Editions","Notes","References","External links"],"tags":[["projection","mathematics__"],["tautology","logic"],["transcendence","philosophy"],["projection","mathematics"],["tautology","logic"],["transcendence","philosophy"],["form_of_life","philosophy"],["zettel","wittgenstein"],["david_edmonds","philosopher"],["wittgenstein","film"],["ontology","information_science"],["watson","computer"],["siri","software"],["cratylus","dialogue"],["donald_davidson","philosopher"],["meaning","linguistics"],["set","mathematics"],["class","philosophy"],["property","philosophy"],["sign","semiotics"],["sentence","linguistics"],["statement","logic"],["formal_semantics","linguistics"]],"image":["http://en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Tractatus_title_page_1922_Harcourt.png","http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/Tractatus_title_page_1922_Harcourt.png/200px-Tractatus_title_page_1922_Harcourt.png","http://upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/1/a/01a3cf5f91211db95ef402b4bd20508b.png","http://upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/1/a/01a3cf5f91211db95ef402b4bd20508b.png","http://upload.wikimedia.org/math/c/7/6/c767dfc14d86e58aaba49bb378cb6c96.png","http://upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/3/8/038c206fe2ad462e2e72b2e7a6d95a8f.png","http://upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/0/d/50db13a0df17827a45c41930956d2eeb.png","http://upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/3/8/038c206fe2ad462e2e72b2e7a6d95a8f.png","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Penrose_triangle.svg","http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f4/Penrose_triangle.svg/200px-Penrose_triangle.svg.png","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Penrose_triangle.svg","http://bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Socrates.png","http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/Socrates.png/18px-Socrates.png","http://bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","http://bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"related":["Frank_P._Ramsey","C.K._Ogden","Ludwig_Wittgenstein","Weimar_Germany","German_language","Latin","Philosopher","Ludwig_Wittgenstein","G._E._Moore","Latin","Baruch_Spinoza","World_War_I","Como","Cassino","Logical_Positivism","Vienna_Circle","Rudolf_Carnap","Friedrich_Waismann","Bertrand_Russell","Proposition","Truth_function","Logical","Geometric","Projection_(mathematics)__","Truth_tables","Truth_conditions","Semantic","William_Kneale","Logical_equivalence","Tautology_(logic)","Logical_consequence","Deductive","Sheffer_stroke","Theorem","Henry_M._Sheffer","Sheffer_stroke","Transcendence_(philosophy)","Ethics","Aesthetics","Arthur_Schopenhauer","Aphorisms","Old_Testament","Jesus_ben_Sirach","Sirach","Thomas_Aquinas","Problem_of_religious_language","Fergus_Gordon_Kerr","Roman_Catholic","Order_of_Preachers","Saint_Dominic","Picture_theory_of_language","Bertrand_Russell","Theory_of_descriptions","Anthony_Kenny","Chess","English_language","Charles_Kay_Ogden","Cambridge","Mathematician","Philosopher","Frank_P._Ramsey","Vienna_Circle","Rudolf_Carnap","Moritz_Schlick","James_F._Conant","St._Martins_Press","New_Wittgenstein","Poetry","Rabindranath_Tagore","Peter_Forgacs","Wilhelm_Ostwald","Bertrand_Russell","G._E._Moore","F._P._Ramsey","David_Pears","Georg_Henrik_von_Wright","Ray_Monk"],"members":["meaning","ontology","statement","projection","formal_semantics","sign","property","set","sentence","david_edmonds","siri","cratylus","tautology","watson","form_of_life","zettel","class","donald_davidson","wittgenstein","transcendence"],"book":[]}
