From an engineering point of view, a particular car model\nis usually defined and/or constrained by the use of a particular car\nchassis/bodywork combination or the same monocoque, although sometimes this is\nnot the case, and the model represents a marketing segment.\n\nA model may also be referred to as a '[[nameplate]]', specifically when\nreferring to the product from the point of view of the manufacturer, especially\na model over time. For example, the Chevrolet Suburban is the oldest automobile\nnameplate in continuous production, dating to 1934 (1935 model year), while the\nChrysler New Yorker was (until its demise in 1996) the oldest North American car\nnameplate. \"Nameplate\" is also sometimes used more loosely, however, to refer to\na brand or division of larger company (e.g., GMC), rather than a specific model.\n\nThis engineering frame may have derivatives, giving rise to more than one body\nstyle for a particular car model. For example, the same model can be offered as\na four-door sedan (saloon), a two-door coupÃ©, a station wagon (estate), or even\nas a folding-roof convertible, all derived from essentially the same engineering\nframe. An example of this is the BMW 3-series.\n\nFully specifying an automobile can involve many levels of detail, most\nbasically:\n* Manufacturer (company)\n* Model (brand, product name)\n* Model year and often further:\n* Body style (e.g., 2-door, 4-door)\n* Trim level (often denoted by lettering after the model name)\n* Individual options (e.g., a sunroof) Traditionally in North America,\n  especially in police reports, automobiles are specified by \"make, model, year\"\n  â manufacturer, product, and model year, as in a \"2000 Toyota Camry\" (year\n  often placed first).\n","linknr":197,"url":"Car_model","recorded":1362374828,"links":18,"instances":["automobile","automobile","2009","car","international"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Automotive industry"],"headings":["Mechanical internals","Marketing","Regional variations","Trim levels","Model years","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/33/Three_body_styles_with_pillars_and_boxes.png/220px-Three_body_styles_with_pillars_and_boxes.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["sedan","automobile"],["rover","car"],["ford_focus","international"],["w211#avantgarde_edition","2009"],["facelift","automotive"],["facelift","automobile"]],"members":["facelift","sedan","rover","ford_focus"],"related":["Three-box_styling","Three-box_styling","Three-box_styling","Model_range","Ford_Focus","Marque","Chassis","Coachwork","Monocoque","Chevrolet_Suburban","Chrysler_New_Yorker","Body_style","Sedan_(automobile)","Coupé","Station_wagon","BMW_3-series","Badge_engineering","Volkswagen_Golf","Volkswagen_Jetta","Mitsubishi_Pajero","Manual_transmission","Automatic_transmission","Manumatic","Continuous_variable_transmission","Semi-automatic_transmission","Dual_clutch_transmission","SUV","Moonroof","Electronic_stability_control","Toyota_Camry","Classic_Edition","Luxury_Edition","XLE","Extra_Luxury_Edition","Renault_Scénic","Mitsubishi_Lancer_Evolution","Rally_Sport","Grand_Sport_Rally","Special_Edition","Mitsubishi_Racing","GT-A","Grand_Touring-_Automatic","BMW_M","Ford","Rover_(car)","Grand_tourer","Ford_Focus_(international)","Special_edition","Luxury_Edition","Model_year","Facelift_(automotive)","Renault_19","Renault_Mégane","Volkswagen_Golf","Chevrolet_Corvette","Automaker","Facelift_(automobile)","Marque","Automotive_package","Model_year","Badge_engineering"]}
