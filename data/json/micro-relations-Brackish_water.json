{"cursor":"11686","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Brackish water' or 'briny water' is water that has more salinity than fresh\nwater, but not as much as seawater. It may result from mixing of seawater with\nfresh water, as in estuaries, or it may occur in brackish fossil aquifers. The\nword comes from the Middle Dutch root \",\" meaning \"salty\". Certain human\nactivities can produce brackish water, in particular certain civil engineering\nprojects such as dikes and the flooding of coastal marshland to produce brackish\nwater pools for freshwater prawn farming. Brackish water is also the primary\nwaste product of the salinity gradient power process. Because brackish water is\nhostile to the growth of most terrestrial plant species, without appropriate\nmanagement it is damaging to the environment (see article on shrimp farms).\n\nTechnically, brackish water contains between 0.5 and 30 grams of salt per\nlitreâmore often expressed as 0.5 to 30 parts per thousand (ppt or â°). Thus,\nbrackish covers a range of salinity regimes and is not considered a precisely\ndefined condition. It is characteristic of many brackish surface waters that\ntheir salinity can vary considerably over space and/or time.\n","linknr":334,"url":"Brackish_water","recorded":1362372248,"links":53,"instances":["fish","fish","florida","louisiana","fish"],"pdf":["http://www.springerlink.com/content/p2q719335u606034/fulltext.pdf"],"categories":["Liquid water","Aquatic ecology"],"headings":["Brackish water habitats","Notable brackish bodies of water (by type, in alphabetical order)","See also","References","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d7/Monodactylus_argenteus.JPG/220px-Monodactylus_argenteus.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9b/Chilka_lake.png/200px-Chilka_lake.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["pike","fish"],["mullet","fish"],["smelt","fish"],["lake_charles","louisiana"],["lake_monroe","florida"]],"members":["smelt","pike","lake_monroe","lake_charles","mullet"],"related":["Salinity","Fresh_water","Seawater","Estuary","Shrimp_farms","Salt","Estuary","River_Thames","London","Teddington","Battersea","Rutilus","Common_dace","Carp","Perch","Pike_(fish)","Thames_Estuary","Gravesend,_Kent","Euryhaline","Flounder","European_seabass","Mullet_(fish)","Smelt_(fish)","North_Sea","Stenohaline","Ecological_succession","Ecosystem","Fish_migration","Salmon","Eel","Herring","Plaice","Atlantic_salmon","Parasitism","Sea_lice","Mangrove_swamp","Mudskippers","Archer_fish","Lutjanidae","Halfbeak","Tarpon","Saltwater_crocodile","American_crocodile","Proboscis_monkey","Diamondback_terrapin","Crab-eating_Frog","Mosquitoes","Sundarbans","Pichavaram","Bay_of_Bengal","Baltic_Sea","North_Sea","Confluence","Pleistocene","Cod","Caspian_Sea","Caspian_seal","Sturgeon","Caviar","Black_Sea","Anoxic_event","Mediterranean","Brackish_marsh","Baltic_Sea","Black_Sea","Caspian_Sea","India","Lake_Charles_(Louisiana)","Lake_Charles,_Louisiana","Louisiana","United_States","Chilka_Lake","Odisha","India","Issyk_Kul","Kyrgyzstan","Dominican_Republic","Lake_Maracaibo","Zulia_State","Venezuela","Lake_Monroe_(Florida)","Florida","Pangong_Tso","Ladakh","Jammu_and_Kashmir","India","Lake_Van","Kildin_Island","Murmansk","Russia","Loch_Long","Loch_of_Stenness","Burgas_Lakes","Bulgarian_Black_Sea_Coast","Lagoon","Dorset","England","Kaliveli_Lake","Tamil_Nadu","India","Kerala_Backwaters","Lagos_Lagoon","Lake_Pontchartrain","New_Orleans,_Louisiana","Louisiana","United_States","Pulicat_Lake","Chennai","India","Rann_of_Kutch","India","Pakistan","Rhône_River","France","Camargue","Widewater","Land-locked","Lagoon","Lancing,_West_Sussex","England","Lagoa_dos_Patos","Rio_Grande_do_Sul","Brazil","Amazon_River","Atlantic_Ocean","Chesapeake_Bay","Maryland","Virginia","Susquehanna_River","Delaware_Bay","Delaware_River","New_Jersey","Delaware","Hudson_River","New_York","New_Jersey","United_States","East_River","Harlem_River","New_York","Lingding_Yang","Guangdong","People's_Republic_of_China","Port_Royal_Sound","South_Carolina","Río_de_la_Plata","Argentina","Uruguay","Saint_Lawrence_River","Saguenay_River","Quebec_City","Saguenay,_Quebec","San_Francisco_Bay","San_Pablo_Bay","San_Francisco","California","U.S.","Thames_Estuary","England","Biosalinity","Brackish_water_aquarium","Desalination","Permian_Sea"]}
