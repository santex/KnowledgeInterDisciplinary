This is not the way this word is usually used in\nphilosophy. However, the two uses are related. Normally, when two people\nverbally disagree with each other, each person attempts to convince the other\nthat his or her viewpoint is the right one. Unless he or she merely results to\nname calling or threats, he or she typically presents an argument for his or her\nposition, in the sense described above.
