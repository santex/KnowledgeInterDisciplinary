Individuals receiving two\nrecessive alleles will be diagnosed with Cystic fibrosis. It is generally\naccepted that inherited genotype, transmitted epigenetic factors, and non-\nhereditary environmental variation contribute to the phenotype of an individual.\n\nNon-hereditary DNA mutations are not classically understood as representing the\nindividual's genotype. Hence, scientists and physicians sometimes talk for\nexample about the (geno)type of a particular cancer, that is the genotype of the\ndisease as distinct from the diseased.\n","title":"genotype","headings":["Genotype and genomic sequence","Genotype and Mendelian inheritance","Genotype and mathematics","Determining genotype","See also","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["4: Allele","2: Phenotype","1: Genetics","1: Recessive","1: Cystic_fibrosis","1: Epigenetic","1: Hereditary","1: DNA","1: Physicians","1: Cancer","1: Gene","1: Polyploid","1: Homozygous","1: Heterozygous","1: Genetic_disorder","1: Haemophilia","1: Zygosity","1: Dominant_allele","1: Genetic_carrier","1: Biology","1: Computer_science","1: Genetic_programming","1: Evolutionary_algorithm","1: Evolution","1: Mathematics","1: Assay","1: PCR","1: Restriction_digest","1: Allele_specific_oligonucleotide","1: DNA_sequencing","1: Nucleic_acid_hybridization","1: DNA_microarrays","1: Restriction_fragment_length_polymorphism","1: Terminal_restriction_fragment_length_polymorphism","1: Amplified_fragment_length_polymorphism","1: Multiplex_ligation-dependent_probe_amplification","1: Microsatellite_instability","1: Aneuploidy","1: Loss_of_heterozygosity","1: Cancer_cell","1: Colon_cancer","1: Breast_cancer","1: Cervical_cancer","1: Down_syndrome","1: Endophenotype"]}
