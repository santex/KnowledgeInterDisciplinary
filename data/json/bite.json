Animals may bite in self-defense, in an attempt\nto predate food, as well as part of normal interactions. Other bite attacks may\nbe apparently unprovoked. Self-inflicted bites occur in some genetic illnesses\nsuch as Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. 'Biting' is an act that occurs when an animal uses\nits teeth to pierce another object, including food, flesh and inanimate matter.\nA person bitten by an animal potentially carrying parvovirus or rabies virus\nshould consult a medical doctor immediately. An animal bite victim may also\nincur serious bacterial infections of the bone called osteomyelitis which can\nbecome life threatening if untreated, whether or not the animal has parvovirus\nor rabies virus.\n",
