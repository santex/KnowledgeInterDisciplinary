It is governed by\na board, which is assisted by the Chief Executive (currently Sam Younger) and an\nexecutive team. Suzi Leather, DBE was appointed\nChair of the Commission's board on 1 August 2006, after being chair of the Human\nFertilisation and Embryology Authority and the School Food Trust. Geraldine Peacock, CBE was Chief Charity Commissioner\n(as previous chairs of the Commission have been known) from 2003 to 2006, and\nChair-designate from 8 July 2004 to 2006.\n\nIt has four sites in London, Taunton, Liverpool and Newport. The commission's\nwebsite lists the latest accounts submitted by charities in England and Wales.\n","linknr":231,"url":"Charity_Commission","recorded":1364141014,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Charity_Commission_for_England_and_Wales&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Charity_Commission_for_England_and_Wales&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","/wiki/Charity_Commission_for_England_and_Wales","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","/w/index.php?title=Charity_Commission&redirect=no","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/Charities_Commission_(disambiguation)","/wiki/File:Charity_Commission_Logo.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/82/Charity_Commission_Logo.png","/wiki/Non-ministerial_government_department","/wiki/England_and_Wales","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Non-ministerial_government_department","http://www.charitycommission.gov.uk/","/wiki/Non-ministerial_government_department","/wiki/Charitable_organization","/wiki/England_and_Wales","/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Quango","/wiki/Sam_Younger","#cite_note-CCGovernance-2","/wiki/Suzi_Leather","/wiki/Order_of_the_British_Empire","/wiki/Human_Fertilisation_and_Embryology_Authority","/wiki/School_Food_Trust","#cite_note-SuziLeather-3","/wiki/Geraldine_Peacock","/wiki/Order_of_the_British_Empire","/wiki/London","/wiki/Taunton","/wiki/Liverpool","/wiki/Newport","#Exempt_charities","#Charities_operating_across_other_national_borders_within_the_United_Kingdom","#Regulatory_action","#History_of_the_Charity_Commission","#See_also","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Charity_Commission_for_England_and_Wales&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Exempt_charity","#cite_note-4","#cite_note-5","/w/index.php?title=Charity_Commission_for_England_and_Wales&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Scotland","/wiki/Office_of_the_Scottish_Charity_Regulator","/wiki/Northern_Ireland","/wiki/Charity_Commission_for_Northern_Ireland","/w/index.php?title=Voluntary_and_Community_Unit&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Department_for_Social_Development","/wiki/Northern_Ireland_Executive","/w/index.php?title=Charity_Commission_for_England_and_Wales&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/Casework","/wiki/Statutory_law","/wiki/The_Atlantic_Bridge","#cite_note-6","#cite_note-7","/wiki/Public_Administration_Select_Committee","/wiki/Charlie_Elphicke","/wiki/Conservative","/wiki/Dover","#cite_note-8","#cite_note-9","/w/index.php?title=Charity_Commission_for_England_and_Wales&action=edit&section=4","/wiki/Charitable_trusts_in_English_law#Charity_Commission","/w/index.php?title=Charitable_Trusts_Act_1853&action=edit&redlink=1","#cite_note-10","#cite_note-11","/wiki/Charities_Act_2006","#cite_note-12","/w/index.php?title=Charity_Commission_for_England_and_Wales&action=edit&section=5","/wiki/Charities_Act_2006","/wiki/Intelligent_Giving","/wiki/GuideStar","/w/index.php?title=Charity_Commission_for_England_and_Wales&action=edit&section=6","#cite_ref-1","http://www.charitycommission.gov.uk/About_us/About_the_Commission/Annual_report/managing_resources.aspx","http://www.charitycommission.gov.uk/About_us/About_the_Commission/Annual_report/managing_resources.aspx","#cite_ref-CCGovernance_2-0","http://www.charitycommission.gov.uk/tcc/govframe.asp","http://www.charitycommission.gov.uk/tcc/govframe.asp","#cite_ref-SuziLeather_3-0","http://www.charity-commission.gov.uk/About_us/About_the_Commission/commissioners.aspx#1","http://www.charity-commission.gov.uk/About_us/About_the_Commission/commissioners.aspx#1","#cite_ref-4","http://www.uk-charities-act-1993.co.uk/s-E","#cite_ref-5","http://www.charity-commission.gov.uk/Publications/cc23.aspx","#cite_ref-6","http://www.civilsociety.co.uk/governance/news/content/10701/commission_to_scrap_regulatory_compliance_cases","#cite_ref-7","http://www.civilsociety.co.uk/governance/news/content/10740/atlantic_bridge-style_investigations_were_unlawful_say_charity_lawyers","#cite_ref-8","http://www.thirdsector.co.uk/news/1157267/mp-says-charity-commission-refusal-grant-plymouth-brethren-charitable-status-suppression-religion","#cite_ref-9","http://www.christian.org.uk/news/charity-commission-accused-of-suppressing-christianity","#cite_ref-10","http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/catalogue/DisplayCatalogueDetails.asp?CATID=944&CATLN=2&FullDetails=True&j=1","http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/catalogue/DisplayCatalogueDetails.asp?CATID=944&CATLN=2&FullDeta
