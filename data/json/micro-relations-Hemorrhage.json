Bleeding can occur internally, where\nblood leaks from blood vessels inside the body, or externally, either through a\nnatural opening such as the mouth, nose, ear, urethra, vagina or anus, or\nthrough a break in the skin. Desanguination is a massive blood loss, and the\ncomplete loss of blood is referred to as exsanguination. Typically, a\nhealthy person can endure a loss of 10â15% of the total blood volume without\nserious medical difficulties, and blood donation typically takes 8â10% of the\ndonor's blood volume.\n","linknr":398,"url":"Hemorrhage","recorded":1362484535,"links":68,"instances":["circulatory","skin","human","medicine"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Medical emergencies","Blood"],"headings":["Classification","Causes","See also","Footnotes"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e6/Bleeding_finger.jpg/230px-Bleeding_finger.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/Eye_hemorrhage.jpg/220px-Eye_hemorrhage.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/94/Linitis_plastica_2.jpg/220px-Linitis_plastica_2.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/03/Pulmonary_haemorrhage_-_high_mag.jpg/220px-Pulmonary_haemorrhage_-_high_mag.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["mouth","human"],["saline","medicine"],["shock","circulatory"],["epidermis","skin"]],"members":["shock","epidermis","mouth","saline"],"related":["Blood","Circulatory_system","Blood_vessel","Mouth_(human)","Human_nose","Ear","Urethra","Vagina","Anus","Human_skin","Desanguination","Exsanguination","Sequela","Blood_donation","LASIK","Hemosiderin","Alveolar_macrophage","Pulmonary_hemorrhage","H&E_stain","Advanced_trauma_life_support","Fluid_resuscitation","Vasoconstriction","Saline_(medicine)","Lactated_Ringer's_solution","Blood_transfusion","Blood_pressure","Heart_rate","Shock_(circulatory)","Capillary_refill","Hypovolemia","Circulatory_system","World_Health_Organization","Hematemesis","Hemoptysis","Hematochezia","Hematuria","Intracranial_hemorrhage","Cerebral_hemorrhage","Intracerebral_hemorrhage","Hemorrhagic_stroke","Subarachnoid_hemorrhage","Subarachnoid_space","Arteriovenous_malformation","Pulmonary_hemorrhage","Vaginal_bleeding","Postpartum_hemorrhage","Breakthrough_bleeding","Polycystic_ovary_syndrome","Transvaginal_oocyte_retrieval","Upper_gastrointestinal_bleed","Wound","Epidermis_(skin)","Scalpel","Medical_procedure","Blood_vessel","Blood_pressure","Clotting_factors","Aneurysms","Aortic_dissection","Arteriovenous_malformation","Vasculitides","Helicobacter_pylori","Brain_abscess","Brain_tumor","Blood_coagulation","Hemostasis","Hemostasis","Platelets","Blood_coagulation","Platelets","Non-steroidal_anti-inflammatory_drugs","Platelets","Coagulation","Hemophilia_A","Hemophilia_B","Autoimmune","Von_Willebrand_disease","Warfarin","Vitamin_K","Fresh_frozen_plasma","Factor_VIII","Anaesthesia_Trauma_and_Critical_Care","Aneurysm","Autohaemorrhaging","Coagulation","Exsanguination","Hematophagy","Hemophilia"]}
