It is the 58th\nlargest island in the United States and the third largest on the East Coast of\nthe United States. It is also the largest island not connected to mainland by a\nbridge or tunnel on the East Coast of the United States.\n\nIt is located in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, as a part of Dukes County,\nwhich also includes Cuttyhunk and the other Elizabeth Islands, as well as the\nisland of Nomans Land, which is both a US Wildlife preserve, as well as a US\nNaval practice bombing range which continues to be controversial. The Vineyard\nwas also home to one of the earliest known deaf communities in the United\nStates; consequently, a special sign language, Martha's Vineyard Sign Language\n(MVSL), developed on the island.\n\nThe estimated year-round population is 15,000 residents; however, the summer\npopulation can swell to over 100,000 people. About 56% of the Vineyardâs 14,621\nhomes are seasonally occupied. http://www.mvcommission.org/doc.php/Populati-\non%20and%20Housing%20Profile.pdf?id=614\n\nMartha's Vineyard is primarily known as a summer colony, and is accessible only\nby boat and air. However, its year-round population has grown considerably since\nthe 1960s. A study by the Martha's Vineyard Commission found that the cost of\nliving on the island is 60 percent higher than the national average and housing\nprices are 96 percent higher.
