{"cursor":"13142","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"]] ]] A 'prostaglandin' is any member of a group of lipid compounds that are\nderived enzymatically from fatty acids and have important functions in the\nanimal body. Every prostaglandin contains 20 carbon atoms, including a 5-\ncarbon ring.\n\nThey are mediators and have a variety of strong physiological effects, such as\nregulating the contraction and relaxation of smooth muscle tissue. Prostaglandins are not endocrine hormones, but autocrine or paracrine,\nwhich are locally acting messenger molecules. They differ from hormones in that\nthey are not produced at a discrete site but in many places throughout the human\nbody. Also, their target cells are present in the immediate vicinity of the site\nof their secretion (of which there are many).\n\nThe prostaglandins, together with the thromboxanes and prostacyclins, form the\nprostanoid class of fatty acid derivatives, a subclass of eicosanoids.\n","linknr":849,"url":"Prostaglandins","recorded":1362508322,"links":56,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.springerlink.com/content/g602m231xpw85226/fulltext.pdf","http://www.springerlink.com/content/g602m231xpw85226/fulltext.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20080227041626/http://www.michvma.org/documents/MVC+Proceedings/Labonde2.pdf","http://www.michvma.org/documents/MVC%20Proceedings/Labonde2.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20080227041626/http://www.michvma.org/documents/MVC+Proceedings/Labonde2.pdf"],"categories":["Prostaglandins|"],"headings":["History and name","Biochemistry","Function","Types","Role in pharmacology","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/07/Prostaglandin_E1.svg/220px-Prostaglandin_E1.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3f/Prostacyclin-2D-skeletal.png/220px-Prostacyclin-2D-skeletal.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/40/Eicosanoid_synthesis.svg/300px-Eicosanoid_synthesis.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Lipid","Fatty_acid","Animal","Carbon","Physiology","Hormone","Autocrine","Paracrine","Secretion","Thromboxane","Prostacyclin","Prostanoid","Eicosanoid","Prostate_gland","Seminal_fluid","Physiology","Ulf_von_Euler","Seminal_vesicles","Total_synthesis","Prostaglandin_F2alpha","Prostaglandin_E2","E._J._Corey","Japan_Prize","Aspirin","Biochemist","Sune_K._Bergstr√∂m","Bengt_I._Samuelsson","John_R._Vane","Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_or_Medicine","Autocrine","Paracrine","Platelet","Endothelium","Uterus","Mast_cell","Essential_fatty_acid","Arachidonic_acid","Diacylglycerol","Phospholipase_A2","Cyclooxygenase","Lipoxygenase","Leukotriene","Thromboxane","Prostacyclin","Leukocyte","Macrophage","Prostaglandin_transporter","Multidrug_resistance_protein_4","ATP-binding_cassette_transporter","Cyclooxygenase","Blood_vessels","Stomach","Kidneys","Inflammation","Prostaglandin_E_synthase","Lipocalin","Prostaglandin_D_synthase","Thromboxane-A_synthase","Prostaglandin-F_synthase","Prostaglandin_receptor","G-protein-coupled_receptor","PGD2","Smooth_muscle","Platelet","Neuron","Calcium","Hormone","Cell_growth","Hypothalamus","Fever","Mesangial","Glomerulus","Kidney","Glomerular_filtration_rate","Parietal_cells","Stomach","Paracrine","Autocrine","Prostaglandin_I2","Prostaglandin_E2","Prostaglandin_F2alpha","Prostaglandin_receptor","Vasodilation","Platelet_aggregation","Bronchodilation","Bronchoconstriction","GI_tract","Smooth_muscle","Bronchodilation","GI_tract","Smooth_muscle","Vasodilation","Stomach","Stomach","Mucus","Uterus","GI_tract","Smooth_muscle","Lipolysis","Autonomous_ns","Neurotransmitters","Hyperalgesia","Fever","Uterus","Bronchoconstriction","NSAID","Corticosteroids","COX-2_selective_inhibitors","Cyclopentenone_prostaglandin","Inflammation","Childbirth","Abortion","Mifepristone","Patent_ductus_arteriosus","Cyanotic_heart_defect","Peptic_ulcer","Vasodilation","Raynaud's_phenomenon","Ischemia","Pulmonary_hypertension","Glaucoma","Bimatoprost","Erectile_dysfunction","Alprostadil","Egg_bound","Birds","Eyelash","Eyebrow"]}
