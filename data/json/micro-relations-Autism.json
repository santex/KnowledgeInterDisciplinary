The\ndiagnostic criteria require that symptoms become apparent before a child is\nthree years old. Autism affects information\nprocessing in the brain by altering how nerve cells and their synapses connect\nand organize; how this occurs is not well understood. It is one\nof three recognized disorders in the autism spectrum (ASDs), the other two being\nAsperger syndrome, which lacks delays in cognitive development and language, and\npervasive developmental disorder, not otherwise specified (commonly abbreviated\nas PDD-NOS), which is diagnosed when the full set of criteria for autism or\nAsperger syndrome are not met.\n\nAutism has a strong genetic basis, although the genetics of autism are complex\nand it is unclear whether ASD is explained more by rare mutations, or by rare\ncombinations of common genetic variants. In rare cases,\nautism is strongly associated with agents that cause birth defects. Controversies surround other proposed environmental causes, such as\nheavy metals, pesticides or childhood vaccines; the vaccine\nhypotheses are biologically implausible and lack convincing scientific\nevidence. The prevalence of autism is about 1â2\nper 1,000 people worldwide, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n(CDC) report 11 per 1,000 children in the United States are diagnosed with ASD\nas of 2008. The\nnumber of people diagnosed with autism has increased dramatically since the\n1980s, partly due to changes in diagnostic practice; the question of whether\nactual prevalence has increased is unresolved.\n\nParents usually notice signs in the first two years of their child's life. The signs usually develop gradually, but some autistic children first\ndevelop more normally and then regress. Early behavioral\nor cognitive intervention can help autistic children gain self-care, social, and\ncommunication skills. Although there is no known cure, there have been reported cases of children who recovered. Not many children with autism live independently after reaching\nadulthood, though some become successful. An autistic culture\nhas developed, with some individuals seeking a cure and others believing autism\nshould be accepted as a difference and not treated as a disorder.\n","linknr":2222,"url":"Autism","recorded":1362511117,"links":136,"instances":["biological","psychology","genetics","medicine","tests","medicine","medicine","tests","biology","chemistry"],"pdf":["http://idea.library.drexel.edu/bitstream/1860/2632/1/2006175339.pdf","http://www.waisman.wisc.edu/family/pubs/Autism/2007%20siblings_autism_life-course.pdf","http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/reprint/154/2/185.pdf","http://www.thepsychologist.org.uk/archive/archive_home.cfm/volumeID_12-editionID_46-ArticleID_133-getfile_getPDF/thepsychologist/psy_11_99_p540-547_happe.pdf","http://autismresearchcentre.com/docs/papers/2006_BC_Neuropsychophamacology.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20120513020615/http://autismresearchcentre.com/docs/papers/2006_BC_Neuropsychophamacology.pdf","http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/358/1431/459.full.pdf","http://autismresearchcentre.com/docs/papers/2009_BC_nyas.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20120513020626/http://autismresearchcentre.com/docs/papers/2009_BC_nyas.pdf","http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/~lds/pdfs/spelke2005.pdf","http://www.racgp.org.au/afp/200709/200709angley.pdf","http://psych.wisc.edu/lang/pdf/Dawson_AutisticLearning.pdf"],"categories":["Autism|","Communication
