Stachowicz, J.\nJ. 2001. Mutualism, facilitation, and the structure of ecological communities.\nBioScience 51: 235-246. Facilitations can be categorized as mutualisms, in\nwhich both species benefit, or commensalisms, in which one species benefits and\nthe other is unaffected. Much of classic ecological theory (e.g., natural\nselection, niche separation, metapopulation dynamics) has focused on negative\ninteractions such as predation and competition, but positive interactions\n(facilitation) are receiving increasing focus in ecological research.
