{"cursor":"5474","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A sailboat 'broaches' when its heading suddenly changes towards the wind due\nto wind/sail interactions for which the rudder cannot compensate. This causes\nthe boat to roll dangerously and if not controlled may lead to a capsize. This\nhappens when the aerodynamic force on the rig greatly exceeds the hydrodynamic\nforce on the hull, due to a sudden increase in wind strength or turbulent sea\nconditions. In small boats and dinghies, broaching can lead to a death roll.\nIn larger boats broaching can lay the mast horizontal, putting both rig and\ncrew at risk. It can be particularly dangerous when racing other boats at\nclose quarters.\n\nBroaching most typically happens when a boat is on a broad reach with spinnaker\nset and there is an overpowering weather helm. This may\nbe due to excessive heeling, swell that causes the rudder to be partially lifted\nout of the water, or because the stem digs into a wave causing a strong lateral\nforce. The boat will come quickly across the wind with too much sail set. It can\nalso happen on a close reach where it is typically precipitated by sudden\nwaves. With an inattentive helmsman it can be a consequence of a\ngybe, which can be a dangerous manoeuvre even when performed under controlled\ncircumstances. When it happens unexpectedly and the helm isn't corrected, the\nheading of the boat may veer into the wind causing a broach.\n\nAlso when sailing on a dead downwind run an inexperienced or inattentive sailor\ncan easily misjudge the real strength of the wind since the boat speed subtracts\ndirectly from the true wind speed and this makes the apparent wind less. In\naddition the sea conditions also falsely seem milder on this point of sail as\ndeveloping white caps are shielded from view by the back of the waves and are\nless apparent. When changing course in a brisk wind from a run to a reach or a\nbeat, a sailboat that seemed under control can instantly become over-canvassed\nand in danger of a sudden broach.\n\nOne of the less obvious causes of broaching is an oscillation developed when\nrunning downwind. When running dead downwind, the sails are\nset with an angle of attack of nearly 90 degrees to the wind. The high angle of\nattack causes turbulent bubbles to form on the leeward side of the sail, and\nwhen there is insufficient attached flow to keep these bubbles attached to the\nsail, they separate. The sudden separation of a turbulent bubble drops the lift\nof the sail to nearly nothing, which causes the boat to rock slightly. At angles\nof attack near 90 degrees, lift can generate on the leech, or trailing edge of\nthe sail. As the boat rocks due to separation of turbulent bubbles, a\nconstructive interference is formed, as bubbles begin to shed from alternating\nsides of the sail. Once started, the oscillation builds quickly, especially in\nmodern ultra-light displacement centerboard boats, which lack the damping\neffects of a large keel. Once this oscillation reaches a certain point, the\nextreme change in heel angle will cause the boat to broach. Spinnakers generate\nlift from the top, rather than the side, and thus they are less prone to this\nform of broaching than other modern sail types. Square rigged vessels also\ngenerate lift from the tops of their sails, which in fact, combined with the\nlarge keels they traditionally use, makes them immune to this type of broaching.\n\nAnother cause of broaching is encountered in heavy seas and high winds. If the\nbow of the yacht is not kept pointed into the waves, then the waves will push\nthe bow aside, turning the boat side-on to the waves. Once side-on to the waves,\nthe waves will roll the yacht side to side violently, causing severe discomfort\nto the crew, and the yacht may broach and may even capsize. Since a sailing ship\ncannot steer unless the sails are providing forward motion, and since heavy seas\nare most often from the same direction as the wind, a sea anchor may be used at\nthe bow in extreme weather to keep the bow pointed into the wind and waves.\n\nThe key to stopping or rescuing a broach is to depower the sails at the first\nopportunity. This may be done by releasing the main or jib sheet by a foot or\nmore or by releasing the boom vang (kicking strap) which will spill wind out of\nthe top of the mainsail. The main means of preventing a broach is to ensure that\nthe amount of sail set is reduced to suit the sailing conditions.\n","linknr":130,"url":"Broach_(sailing)","recorded":1374546739,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Broach_(sailing)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Broach_(sailing)&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Broaching.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1f/Broaching.jpg/200px-Broaching.jpg","/wiki/File:Broaching.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf6/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Course_(navigation)","/wiki/Wind","/wiki/Sail","/wiki/Rudder","/wiki/Capsize","/wiki/Death_roll","/wiki/Broad_reach","/wiki/Weather_helm","#cite_note-colgate-1","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Gybe","/wiki/Downwind","/wiki/Wind_speed","/wiki/Apparent_wind","/wiki/Reach","/wiki/Over-canvassed","/wiki/Oscillation","/wiki/Points_of_sail","#cite_note-colgate-1","/wiki/Centerboard","/wiki/Keel","/wiki/Spinnaker","/wiki/Square_rig","/wiki/Sea_anchor","/wiki/Boom_vang","/w/index.php?title=Broach_(sailing)&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-colgate_1-0","#cite_ref-colgate_1-1","#cite_ref-2","http://www.nytimes.com/1988/07/11/sports/guide-to-avoid-broaching.html","/w/index.php?title=Broach_(sailing)&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Template:Sailing_manoeuvres","/wiki/Template_talk:Sailing_manoeuvres","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Sailing_manoeuvres&action=edit","/wiki/Capsizing","/wiki/Points_of_sail","/wiki/Death_roll","/wiki/Jibe","/wiki/Chinese_gybe","/wiki/Heaving_to","/wiki/Heeling_(sailing)","/wiki/Hiking_(sailing)","/wiki/Points_of_sail#In_irons","/wiki/Jibe","/wiki/Planing_(sailing)","/wiki/Points_of_sail","/wiki/Points_of_sail","/wiki/Reefing","/wiki/Rounding_up","/wiki/Tacking_(sailing)","/wiki/Trapeze_(sailing)","/wiki/Turtling_(sailing)","/wiki/Jibe","/wiki/File:Beating_an_upwind_course.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/32/Beating_an_upwind_course.svg/54px-Beating_an_upwind_course.svg.png","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Broach_(sailing)&oldid=548418750","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Sailing_manoeuvres","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Broach+%28sailing%29&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Broach+%28sailing%29","/wiki/Broach_(sailing)","/wiki/Talk:Broach_(sailing)","#","/wiki/Broach_(sailing)","/w/index.php?title=Broach_(sailing)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Broach_(sailing)&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Broach_(sailing)","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Broach_(sailing)","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Broach_(sailing)&oldid=548418750","/w/index.php?title=Broach_(sailing)&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1462549","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Broach_%28sailing%29&id=548418750","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Broach+%28sailing%29","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Broach+%28sailing%29&oldid=548418750&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Broach_(sailing)&printable=yes","//de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonnenschuss","//ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%91%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%87%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B3","//sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broach","//uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%91%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%87%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B3","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1462549#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en
