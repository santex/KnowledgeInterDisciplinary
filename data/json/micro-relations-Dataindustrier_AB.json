{"cursor":"6801","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Dataindustrier AB' (literal translation: computer industries shareholding\ncompany) or 'DIAB' was a Swedish computer engineering and manufacturing firm,\nfounded in 1970 by Lars Karlsson and active in the 1970s through 1990s. The\ncompany's first product was a board-based computer centered around a specific\nbus named Data Board 4680. This unit was used for automatic control in several\nSwedish industries as would be almost all of DIAB's computers. DIAB is mostly\nknown for engineering the ABC 80, the first Swedish home computer, manufactured\nby Luxor AB.\n\nThey would subsequently develop all the ABC-models (ABC 800, ABC 1600 and ABC\n9000) before rebranding their own make of the ABC 9000 as DIAB DS-90 and develop\na series of Unix-compatible computers, using code licensed from AT&T Version 5\nUnix release, but with a unique in-house kernel using the brand name DNIX. DIAB\nwould continue to provide OEM services past Luxor AB, the most prominent\nprobably being the entire Unix server product line from Cromemco.\n\nThe compiler technology developed by Tomas Evensen at DIAB was bought by Wind\nRiver Systems and was renamed to the \"Wind River Compiler\". Further information\nabout the Wind River Compiler can be found at the\n[http://www.windriver.com/products/development_suite/wind_river_compiler/ Wind\nRiver Compiler product home page].\n\nThe Unix computer support and customers was acquired by Bull Computer in 1990\nending the history of the company.\n","linknr":152,"url":"Dataindustrier_AB","recorded":1362581106,"links":12,"instances":["computing","artist"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Defunct companies of Sweden","Defunct computer companies"],"headings":["Product line","Periphials","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["kernel","computer_science"],["kernel","computing"],["richard_hamilton","artist"]],"members":["kernel","richard_hamilton"],"related":["Sweden","Automatic_control","ABC_80","Home_computer","Luxor_AB","Unix","AT&T","Version_5_Unix","Kernel_(computer_science)","DNIX","Original_equipment_manufacturer","Cromemco","Tomas_Evensen","Wind_River_Systems","Groupe_Bull","Microprocessor","Intel_4004","Motorola_6800","Zilog_Z80","ABC_80","ABC_800","RAM_disk","Compact_Cassette","EIA-422","1983","UNIX","DIAB_DS90","Motorola_68000","DNIX","UNIX_System_V","AT&T_Corporation","Industrial_control_system","Real-time_operating_system","Kernel_(computing)","ABC_1200","Motorola_68010","Motorola_68020","Motorola_68030","Motorola_68040","1990","Groupe_Bull","ABC_1600","ABC_9000","DNIX","Motorola_68010","Motorola_68020","Motorola_68030","Richard_Hamilton_(artist)","Motorola_68040","Motorola_68030","Motorola_68040","Original_equipment_manufacturer","Cromemco","DNIX","Ohio_Scientific","Norsk_Data","ISC_Systems_Corporation","Swedish_language"]}
