{"cursor":"2751","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Wild type' (or 'wildtype' abbreviated wt) refers to the phenotype of the\ntypical form of a species as it occurs in nature. Originally, the wild type was\nconceptualized as a product of the standard, \"normal\" allele at a locus, in\ncontrast to that produced by a non-standard, \"mutant\" allele. It is now\nappreciated that most or all gene loci exist in a variety of allelic forms,\nwhich vary in frequency throughout the geographic range of a species, and that a\nuniform wild type does not exist. In general, however, the most prevalent allele\nâ e.g., the one with the highest gene frequency - is the one deemed as wild\ntype.\n\nThe concept of wild type is useful in some experimental organisms such as fruit\nflies [[Drosophila melanogaster]], in which the standard phenotypes for features\nsuch as eye color or shape and wing form are known to be altered by particular\ngene mutations that produce distinctive phenotypes, such as \"apricot\" \"bar eyes\"\nor \"vestigial wings\". Wild-type alleles are indicated with a \"+\" superscript,\nfor example B + and vg + for round eyes and full-size wings,\nrespectively.\n","linknr":116,"url":"Wild-type","recorded":1362484002,"links":26,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Classical genetics"],"headings":["See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/DNA_stub.png/40px-DNA_stub.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Phenotype","Species","Allele","Mutant","Frequency","Gene","Mutations","Genotype","Phenotype","Crop_wild_relative"]}
