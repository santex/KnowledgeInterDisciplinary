It derives from the Latin {{lang|la|mille}}, thousand,\nand {{lang|la|annus}}, year. It is often, but not necessarily, related to a\nparticular dating system.\n\nSometimes, it is used specifically for periods of thousand years that begin at\nthe starting point (initial reference point) of the calendar in consideration\n(typically the year \"1\"), or in later years that are whole number multiples of a\nthousand years after it. The term can also refer to an interval of time\nbeginning on any date. Frequently in the latter case (and sometimes also in the\nformer) it may have religious or theological implications (see millenarianism).\nSometimes in use, such an interval called a \"millennium\" might be interpreted\nless precisely, i.e., not always being exactly 1000&nbsp;years long. It could\nbe, for example, 1050, 1500, etc.\n","title":"millennium","headings":["Counting years","Debate over millennium celebrations","See also","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["2: Millenarianism","2: Ordinal_number","2: ISO_8601","1: Latin","1: Calendar","1: Gregorian_calendar","1: Date_and_time_notation_by_country","1: ISO_8601_usage","1: Astronomical_year_numbering","1: Cardinal_number","1: Arthur_C._Clarke","1: Analogy","1: Reuters","1: Utopia","1: Y2K_bug","1: Odometer","1: Stephen_Jay_Gould","1: Dionysius_Exiguus","1: Douglas_Adams","1: Australian_Prime_Minister","1: John_Howard","1: Jerry_Seinfeld","1: Zero","1: Edward_Gorey","1: Buzzword","1: Spiegel_Online","1: List_of_calendars","1: Decade","1: Century","1: Millennialism","1: Millennium_bug","1: Millennium_Dome","1: Third_millennium","1: White_House_Millennium_Council"]}
