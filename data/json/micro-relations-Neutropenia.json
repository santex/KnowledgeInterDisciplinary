Neutrophils usually make up 50-70% of\ncirculating white blood cells and serve as the primary defense against\ninfections by destroying bacteria in the blood. Hence, patients with neutropenia\nare more susceptible to bacterial infections and, without prompt medical\nattention, the condition may become life-threatening (neutropenic sepsis).\n\nNeutropenia can be acute or chronic depending on the duration of the illness. A\npatient has chronic neutropenia if the condition lasts for longer than three\nmonths. It is sometimes used interchangeably with the term leukopenia (\"deficit\nin the number of white blood cells\"), as neutrophils are the most abundant\nleukocytes, but neutropenia is more properly considered a subset of leukopenia\nas a whole.\n\nThere are numerous causes of neutropenia that can roughly be divided between\neither problems in the production of the cells by the bone marrow and\ndestruction of the cells elsewhere in the body. Treatment depends on the nature\nof the cause, and emphasis is placed on the prevention and treatment of\ninfection.\n","linknr":272,"url":"Neutropenia","recorded":1362504369,"links":27,"instances":["medical","medicine","medical"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Monocyte and granulocyte disorders"],"headings":["Classification","Signs and symptoms","Diagnosis","Causes","Therapy","History","Diet","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/Neutropenia.JPG/230px-Neutropenia.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg/20px-Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["acute","medical"],["chronic","medicine"],["swelling","medical"]],"members":["swelling","chronic","acute"],"related":["Blood_film","Latin_language","Prefix","Greek_language","Suffix","Granulocyte_disorder","Neutrophil","White_blood_cell","Infection","Bacteria","Blood","Neutropenic_sepsis","Acute_(medical)","Chronic_(medicine)","Leukopenia","Bone_marrow","Absolute_neutrophil_count","Microliter","Infection","Sepsis","Pus","Fever","Infections","Oral_ulcer","Diarrhea","Burning_sensation_when_urinating","Swelling_(medical)","Sore_throat","Full_blood_count","Bone_marrow_biopsy","Cyclic_neutropenia","Autoantibody","Systemic_lupus_erythematosus","Vitamin_B12","Folate","Paroxysmal_nocturnal_hemoglobinuria","Bone_marrow","Aplastic_anemia","Arsenic_poisoning","Cancer","Blood_cancers","Hereditary_disorder","Kostmann_syndrome","Cyclic_neutropenia","Radiation","Vitamin_B12","Folate","Copper_in_health","Autoimmune_neutropenia","Chemotherapy","Dialysis","Flecainide","Viral_infection","Morning_pseudoneutropenia","Granulocyte-colony_stimulating_factor","Filgrastim","Leukemia","Aplastic_anemia","Pancytopenia","Thrombocytopenia"]}
