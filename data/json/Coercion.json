In law, coercion is codified as the duress\ncrime. Such actions are used as leverage, to force the victim to act in the\ndesired way. Coercion may involve the actual infliction of physical pain/injury\nor psychological harm in order to enhance the credibility of a threat. The\nthreat of further harm may lead to the cooperation or obedience of the person\nbeing coerced. Torture is one of the most extreme examples of coercion i.e.\nsevere pain is inflicted until the victim provides the desired response.\n","linknr":478,"url":"Coercion","recorded":1362544171,"links":39,"instances":["contemporary","social_and_political","human_behavior"],"pdf":["http://ptw.uchicago.edu/Anderson02.pdf"],"categories":["Abuse","Bullying","Authority","Legal terms","Psychological abuse","Psychological manipulation"],"headings":["Overview","Aims","Scope","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["obedience","human_behavior"],["cynicism","contemporary"],["power","social_and_political"]],"members":["cynicism","power","obedience"],"related":["Threat","Intimidation","Duress","Credibility","Co-operation","Obedience_(human_behavior)","Torture","Political_freedom","Firing_squad","Discipline","International_Security","Emotional_blackmail","Coercive_persuasion","People’s_Republic_of_China","Robert_Jay_Lifton","Group_psychotherapy","Formal_logic","Marxism-Leninism","Plea_bargain","Creed","Peer_pressure","Sociology_of_religion","Pledge_of_Allegiance","Cynicism_(contemporary)","Social_philosophy","Political_philosophy","Totalitarian","Maoist","Soviet_Union","Stalinist","Fascist","Nazism","Italy","Germany","Political","Giovanni_Gentile","Rule_of_law","Iceland","Middle_Ages","Frederic_William_Maitland","Socialist","Fascist","Taking_Children_Seriously","Free_will","Bullying","Conscription","Duress","Fear_mongering","Interrogation","Mind_control","Power_(social_and_political)","Propaganda","Throffer"]}
