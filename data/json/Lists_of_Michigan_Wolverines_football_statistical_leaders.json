{"cursor":"45112","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"]] ]] ]] The 'lists of Michigan Wolverines football statistical leaders'\nidentify individual statistical leaders of the Michigan Wolverines football\nprogram in various offensive categories, including passing, rushing, and\nreceptions. Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season\nand career leaders in yardage, number (receptions, rushes or passes), and\ntouchdowns. The Michigan Wolverines football program is a college football team\nthat represents the University of Michigan in the National Collegiate Athletic\nAssociation's Big Ten Conference.\n\n'Passing leaders'. Michigan's career leader in passing yardage is Chad Henne\nwith 9,715 passing yards from 2004 to 2007. Henne also holds the career records\nin completions (828) and touchdown passes (87). John Navarre holds the records\nfor passing yards in a single season (3,331) and single game (489), both records\nhaving been set during the 2003 season. Tom Brady holds the school's record for\nmost completions in a game, having completed 34 passes against Alabama in the\n2000 Orange Bowl.\n\n'Rushing leaders'. Michigan's career leader in rushing yards is Mike Hart with\n5,040 rushing yards from 2004 to 2007. Hart also holds the career record with\n1,050 carries. Tim Biakabutuka holds the single season record with 1,818 rushing\nyards during the 1995 season. Ron Johnson holds the single game record with 347\nrushing yards in a game against Wisconsin during the 1967 season. Willie Heston,\nwho played on Fielding H. Yost's \"Point-a-Minute\" teams from 1901 to 1904, holds\nthe career record for rushing touchdowns with 72. Albert Herrnstein holds the\nrecords for most rushing touchdowns in a season (26) and in a single game (7),\nhaving set those records for the 1902 team.\n\n'Receiving leaders'. Michigan receiving records are dominated by Braylon Edwards\nwho played for Michigan from 2001 to 2004. He holds the records for most\nreceiving yards in a career (3,541) and season (1,330 in 2004), the records for\nmost receptions in a career (252) and season (97 in 2004), and the record for\nmost career touchdown reception (39). Heisman Trophy winner Desmond Howard holds\nthe single season record with 19 touchdown passes during the 1991 season.\nMichigan's single game receiving records are held by Roy Roundtree (246\nreceiving yards against Illinois in 2010), Marquise Walker (15 receptions\nagainst Ohio State in 2001), and Derrick Alexander (four touchdown catches\nagainst Minnesota in 1992).\n\n'Historical caveats'. Although Michigan began competing in intercollegiate\nfootball in 1879, the school's official statistical database only\ntracks offensive statistics since 1949. The tracking of\ndefensive statistics dates back to an even shorter period of time and is not\ncovered within the scope of this article.\n\nBecause the official database commences in 1949, many statistical achievements\nare overlooked in these lists. For example, Dick Rifenburg's career receiving\nstatistics are not included in the official database despite the fact that his\n16 career and eight single-season touchdowns were recognized as school records\nuntil 1980.\n\nWhere pre-1949 records are available from reliable sources, they have been\nincluded below with yellow shading. Because there is no complete database of\npre-1949 records, such records are incomplete and may not be considered\n\"official\" records.\n\nWith playing seasons extending progressively from relatively short four-games\nseasons in the 19th century to the current 12-game regular seasons, conference\nchampionship games, and bowl games, and with players being eligible\nto play four years of college football starting in 1972, the lists\ntend to be dominated by more recent players. __NOTOC__\n\n{| class=\"toc\"\n! colspan=2 |Table of contents\n|- width=50px|'[[#Passing|Passing]]'\n|\nYardage â¢
