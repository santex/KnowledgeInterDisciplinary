[http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=length\nPrinceton.edu] In other contexts \"length\" is the measured dimension of an\nobject. For example it is possible to cut a length of a wire which is shorter\nthan wire thickness.\n\nLength may be distinguished from height, which is vertical extent, and width or\nbreadth, which are the distance from side to side, measuring across the object\nat right angles to the length. Length is a measure of one dimension, whereas\narea is a measure of two dimensions (length squared) and volume is a measure of\nthree dimensions (length cubed). In most systems of measurement, the unit of\nlength is a fundamental unit, from which other units are defined.\n\n length of one kilometre is equivalent to the imperial measurement of\n 0.62137 miles.]]\n","linknr":219,"url":"Width","recorded":1362564864,"links":95,"instances":["length"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Length|"],"headings":["History","Units","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/Scale_kilometres_miles.svg/220px-Scale_kilometres_miles.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["orders_of_magnitude","length"]],"members":["orders_of_magnitude"],"related":["Dimension","Wire","Thickness","Height","Area","Volume","Dimensions","Measurement_system","Fundamental_unit","Kilometre","Imperial_measurement","Mile","Cubit","Albert_Einstein","Special_Relativity","Distance","Units_of_measurement","Measurement","Unit_of_length","International_System_of_Units","SI_base_unit","Speed_of_light","U.S._customary_units","Imperial_system_of_units","Astronomy","Dimension","Distance","Orders_of_magnitude_(length)","Reciprocal_length","Smoot","Unit_of_length"]}
