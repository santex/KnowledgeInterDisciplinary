The first is a vague sense of harmonious and beautiful proportion\nand balance. For example, Aristotle\nascribed spherical shape to the heavenly bodies, attributing this formally\ndefined geometric measure of symmetry to the natural order and perfection of\nthe cosmos. The second is an exact mathematical \"patterned self-\nsimilarity\" that can be demonstrated with the rules of a formal system, such\nas geometry or physics.\n\nAlthough these two meanings of \"symmetry\" can sometimes be told apart, they are\nrelated, so they are here discussed together. Weyl 1982\n\nMathematical symmetry may be observed\n\n* with respect to the passage of time;\n* as a spatial relationship;\n* through geometric transformations such as scaling, reflection, and rotation;\n* through other kinds of functional transformations; For example, operations\n  such as moving across a regularly patterned tile floor or rotating an eight-\n  sided vase, or complex transformations of equations or in the way music is\n  played. and\n* as an aspect of abstract objects, theoretic models, language, music and even\n  knowledge itself. See, e.g., {{cite book |title =\n  Symmetry And Complexity: The Spirit and Beauty of Nonlinear Science |first =\n  Klaus |last = Mainzer |publisher = World Scientific |year = 2005 |isbn = 981-256-192-\n  7 }} Symmetric objects can be material, such as a person, crystal,\n  quilt, floor tiles, or molecule, or it can be an abstract structure such as a\n  mathematical equation or a series of tones (music).\n\nThis article describes these notions of symmetry from four perspectives. The\nfirst is symmetry in geometry, which is the most familiar type of symmetry for\nmany people. The second is the more general meaning of symmetry in mathematics\nas a whole. The third describes symmetry as it relates to science and\ntechnology. In this context, symmetries underlie some of the most profound\nresults found in modern physics, including aspects of space and time. The fourth\ndiscusses symmetry in the humanities, covering its rich and varied use in\nhistory, architecture, art, and religion.\n\nThe opposite of symmetry is asymmetry.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"symmetry","recorded":1363384970,"links":[],"instances":["architecture","geometry","music","mathematics","music","device","geometry","music","music","geometry","mathematics","geometry","music","geometry","mathematics","music","music","geometry","mathematics","mathematics","music","geometry","mathematics","mathematics","mathematics","geometry","music","social_psychology","biology","physics","music","visual_arts"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Symmetry|*"],"headings":["In
