Its affiliation overseas is the [http://www.iycs.org International\nYoung Catholic Students (IYCS)], also known as [http://www.iycsasia.org\nInternational Young Christian Students in Asia] that follows the methodology of\nCardinal Joseph Cardijn, the 'see-judge-act methodology'. Known to be the first\nstudent religious organization in the Philippines and presently known all over\nthe Philippines through local dioceses and catholic schools (public & private\nhigh schools).\n\nIt is defined as an organized group of students striving to become a community\nof disciples of Jesus Christ by being evangelized and evangelizing. As a\nmovement for, by and with the students, the method of Cardinal Joseph Cardijn's\nSee-Judge-Act is used in the movement's actions, activities and programs. The\nSee-Judge-Act is not just a method but a way of life for the SCAns, thus,\ncalling it the Review of Life that happens more often in the a small group of\nstudents called cells. Cell is the basic unit of the movement. This is the most\nimportant structure in SCA since it is in the cells where Review of Life is\nexercised. Without cell meetings, SCA ceases to operate. It is the lifeblood of\nthe movement.\n\nEvery three years, the leaders shall meet in a National Conference, the highest\nthe decision making body of the movement. It is in this body that the National\nCoordinating Council shall be elected to a three-year term, comprising a Cluster\nCoordinator together with a College Representative and a High School\nRepresentative. The National Coordinating Council (NCC) shall meet twice a year\nto help monitor the implementation of the programs and policies approved by the\nNational Conference. The National Secretariat comprising the Executive Director,\nExecutive Secretary and the Liaison Officers for each region (Luzon, Visayas and\nMindanao) shall spearhead in running the programs, with the help of the National\nFormation Team.\n\nAt present, there are about 300 universities, colleges and secondary schools\naffiliated with the Student Catholic Action.\n","linknr":107,"url":"Student_Catholic_Action","recorded":1364236851,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Student_Catholic_Action&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Student_Catholic_Action&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/File:Scaam.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c0/Scaam.JPG/220px-Scaam.JPG","/wiki/File:Scaam.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Philippines","http://www.iycs.org","http://www.iycsasia.org","/wiki/Joseph_Cardijn","#History","#The_Logo","#Archdiocese_of_Manila","#Presence_of_Student_Catholic_Action_in_the_Different_Arch.2Fdioceses","#Affiliations","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Student_Catholic_Action&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Pax_Romana_ICMICA/MIIC","/w/index.php?title=Student_Catholic_Action&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/File:Scap.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/33/Scap.jpg/220px-Scap.jpg","/wiki/File:Scap.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Luzon","/wiki/Visayas","/wiki/Mindanao","/w/index.php?title=Student_Catholic_Action&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/File:Sca_logo.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/ed/Sca_logo.jpg/150px-Sca_logo.jpg","/w/index.php?title=Student_Catholic_Action&action=edit&section=4","/w/index.php?title=Student_Catholic_Action&action=edit&section=5","/w/index.php?title=Student_Catholic_Action&action=edit&section=6","http://www.scaphilippines.com","http://www.iycs.org","http://www.iycsasia.org","http://www.scaphilippines.multiply.com","http://www.studentcatholicaction.blogspot.com/","http://mseuf.edu.ph/content/view/278/1174/","http://www.hnu-sca.8m.com","http://www.ubcmsca.webs.com","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Student_Catholic_Action&oldid=519180742","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Roman_Catholic_Church_in_the_Philippines","/wiki/Category:Student_religious_organizations_in_the_Philippines","/wiki/Category:Roman_Catholic_Church_organizations","/wiki/Category:Youth_empowerment_organizations","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Student+Catholic+Action&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Student+Catholic+Action","/wiki/Student_Catholic_Action","/wiki/Talk:Student_Catholic_Action","#","/wiki/Student_Catholic_Action","/w/index.php?title=Student_Catholic_Action&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Student_Catholic_Action&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Student_Catholic_Action","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Student_Catholic_Action","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Student_Catholic_Action&oldid=519180742","/w/index.php?title=Student_Catholic_Action&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Student_Catholic_Action&id=519180742","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Student+Catholic+Action","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Student+Catholic+Action&oldid=519180742&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Student_Catholic_Action&printable=yes","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_Catholic_Action","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/common/images/powere
