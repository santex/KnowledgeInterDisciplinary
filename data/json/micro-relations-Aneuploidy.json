An extra or missing chromosome is a common cause of\ngenetic disorders (birth defects). Some cancer cells also have abnormal numbers\nof chromosomes. Aneuploidy occurs during cell division when the\nchromosomes do not separate properly between the two cells. Chromosome\nabnormalities occur in 1 of 160 live births.This generally happens when\ncytokinesis starts occurring while karyokinesis is still under the process. Most\ncases of aneuploidy result in termination of the developing fetus, but there can\nbe cases of live birth; the most common extra chromosomes among live births are\n21, 18 and 13.\n\nDifferent species have different numbers of normal chromosomes and thus the term\n\"aneuploidy\" refers to the chromosome number being different for that species.\n","linknr":513,"url":"Aneuploidy","recorded":1362902702,"links":43,"instances":["genetics","biology"],"pdf":["http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/1097-0169(200010)47:2%3C81::AID-CM1%3E3.0.CO;2-%23/pdf","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/1097-0169(200010)47:2%3C81::AID-CM1%3E3.0.CO;2-%23/pdf","http://www.reproductivegenetics.com/docs/aneuploidy_pamphlet.pdf"],"categories":["Cytogenetics","Chromosomal abnormalities"],"headings":["Chromosomes","Terminology","Mechanisms","Somatic mosaicism in the nervous system","Somatic mosaicism in cancer","Partial aneuploidy","Aneuploidogens","Diagnosis","Types","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4f/Human_male_karyotpe.gif","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/cf/Trisomy_Detection_in_GeneMarker.jpg/220px-Trisomy_Detection_in_GeneMarker.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cell","biology"],["deletion","genetics"]],"members":["deletion","cell"],"related":["Chromosome","Chromosome_abnormality","Genetic_disorder","Cell_division","Chromosome_21","Chromosome_18","Chromosome_13","List_of_number_of_chromosomes_of_various_organisms","Cell_(biology)","Red_blood_cell","Haploid","Gametes","Chromosomes","Autosomes","Karyotype","Sex_chromosomes","X_chromosomes","X_chromosome","Y_chromosome","Meiosis","Autosome","Trisomy_16","Edwards_syndrome","Trisomy_13","Mosaicism","Tumorigenesis","Haploid","Euploid","Deletion_(genetics)","Sex_chromosome","Turner_syndrome","Ploidy","Uniparental_disomy","Chromosome","Chromosome_21","Down_syndrome","Trisomy_18","Trisomy_13","Triple_X_syndrome","Klinefelter's_syndrome","XYY_syndrome","XXXX_syndrome","XXYY_syndrome","49,_XXXXX","49_XXXXY_syndrome","XYYYY","Mitotic_checkpoint","Mitotic_plate","Disjoint_set","Kinetochore","Mitotic_spindle","Multipolar_spindles","Spindle_pole","Cancer","Chronic_lymphocytic_leukemia","Acute_myeloid_leukemia","Chromosome_instability_syndrome","Carcinogenesis","Chromosomal_translocation","X-ray","Colchicine","QPCR","Short_Tandem_Repeat","Karyotyping","Chromosomes","Fluorescence_In_Situ_Hybridization","Quantitative_Polymerase_Chain_Reaction","Short_Tandem_Repeat","Real-time_PCR","Comparative_Genomic_Hybridization","Amniocentesis","Chorionic_villus_sampling","Prenatal_diagnosis","Turner's_Syndrome","XY_sex_determination_system","XXX_syndrome","48,_XXXX","XXXXX","XY_sex_determination_system","Klinefelter_syndrome","XXXY","XXXXY","XXXXXY","XYY_syndrome","XXYY_syndrome","XXXYY","XXXXYY","XXXXXYY","XYYY","XXYYY","XXXYYY","XXXXYYY","XXXXXYYY","XYYYY","XXYYYY","XXXYYYY","XXXXYYYY","XXXXXYYYY","XYYYYY","XXYYYYY","XXXYYYYY","XXXXYYYYY","XXXXXYYYYY","Trisomy_1","Trisomy_2","Trisomy_3","Wolf-Hirschhorn_syndrome","Trisomy_4","Cri_du_chat","Chromosome_5q_deletion_syndrome","Trisomy_5","Trisomy_6","Williams_syndrome","Trisomy_7","Warkany_syndrome_2","Trisomy_9","Trisomy_10","Jacobsen_syndrome","Trisomy_11","Trisomy_12","Patau_syndrome","Trisomy_14","Angelman_syndrome","Praderâ€“Willi_syndrome","Trisomy_15","Trisomy_16","Miller-Dieker_syndrome","Smith-Magenis_syndrome","Trisomy_17","18q_deletion_syndrome","Edwards_syndrome","Trisomy_19","Trisomy_20","Down_syndrome","DiGeorge_syndrome","Cat_eye_syndrome","Trisomy_22","Ploidy","Polyploidy","Chromosome_abnormalities","Edward's_Syndrome","Down_Syndrome"]}
