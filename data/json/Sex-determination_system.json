{"cursor":"27888","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'sex-determination system' is a biological system that determines the\ndevelopment of sexual characteristics in an organism. Most sexual organisms have\ntwo sexes. Occasionally there are hermaphrodites in place of one or both sexes.\nThere are also some species that are only one sex due to parthenogenesis, the\nact of a female reproducing without fertilization. In many cases, sex\ndetermination is genetic: males and females have different alleles or even\ndifferent genes that specify their sexual morphology. In animals this is often\naccompanied by chromosomal differences. Determination genetically is generally\nthrough chromosome combinations of XY, ZW, XO, ZO, or haplodiploid. Sexual\ndifferentiation is generally started by a main gene, a sex locus, then a\nmultitude of other genes follow in a domino effect. In other cases sex is\ndetermined by environmental variables (such as temperature) or social variables\n(the size of an organism relative to other members of its population).\nEnvironmental sex determination occurred before genetic; it is thought that a\ntemperature-dependent reptile was the common ancestor to sex chromosomes. Some\nspecies do not have a set sex, and instead change it based on certain cues. The\ndetails of some sex-determination systems are not yet fully understood.\n","linknr":524,"url":"Sex-determination_system","recorded":1362373495,"links":41,"instances":["human"],"pdf":["http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/early/2011/01/04/rsbl.2010.1126.full.pdf","http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/early/2011/01/04/rsbl.2010.1126.full.pdf","http://www.seaturtle.org/PDF/TorresMaldonado_2002_Ge.pdf","http://www.seaturtle.org/PDF/TorresMaldonado_2002_Ge.pdf","http://www.public.iastate.edu/~fjanzen/pdf/01EvolEcolRes.pdf","http://www.public.iastate.edu/~fjanzen/pdf/01EvolEcolRes.pdf"],"categories":["Sex-determination systems|","Epigenetics","Sex"],"headings":["Origin of sex chromosomes","Chromosomal determination","Non-genetic sex-determination systems","See also","References","Bibliography"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0c/PAR.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a9/Drosophila_XY_sex-determination.svg/220px-Drosophila_XY_sex-determination.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/Critique_of_the_Theory_of_Evolution_Fig_060.jpg/220px-Critique_of_the_Theory_of_Evolution_Fig_060.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d5/Haplodiploid-sex-determination-system3.png/220px-Haplodiploid-sex-determination-system3.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/Alligator.jpg/220px-Alligator.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/Office-book.svg/30px-Office-book.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["sex_determination_and_differentiation","human"]],"members":["sex_determination_and_differentiation"],"related":["Biology","Sex","Organism","Gender","Hermaphrodite","Parthenogenesis","Allele","Gene","Comparative_anatomy","Chromosome","XY_sex_determination_system","ZW_sex-determination_system","XO_sex-determination_system","ZO_sex-determination_system","Haplodiploid","Ecosystem","Temperature-dependent_sex_determination","Reptile","Ancestor","DMRT1","Autosome","Lepidosauria","Archosauromorpha","SOX3","SRY","Chromosomal_inversion","Homologous_chromosome","X_chromosome","Y_chromosome","Pseudoautosomal_region","Medaka","Allosome","SRY","Drosophila_melanogaster","XXY","Testosterone","Anti-m√ºllerian_hormone","Estrogen","DAX1","Adrenal_hypoplasia_congenita","SOX9","FOXL2","Mammal","Monotreme","Rodent","Arvicolinae","Eutherian","Orthoptera","Cockroach","Shrew","Nematode","XOL-1_Switch_protein_N-terminal_domain","Chromosomes","Lepidoptera","Haplodiploidy","Hymenoptera","Ant","Bee","Haploid","Diploid","Eusociality","Kin_selection","Spermatheca","Alligator","Tuatara","Sex_ratio","Nile_Tilapia","Skink","Agamidae","Snail","Sex_reversal","Clown_fish","Boa_constrictor","Komodo_dragon","Arthropod","Swordtail_fish","Chironomidae","Platypus","Zebrafish","Platyfish","Clarence_Erwin_McClung","Testis-determining_factor","Maternal_influence_on_sex_determination","Protandry","Tetrahymena","Sex_determination_and_differentiation_(human)","Sex_organ","Secondary_sex_characteristic"]}
