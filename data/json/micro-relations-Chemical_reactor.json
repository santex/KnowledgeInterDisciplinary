{"cursor":"9952","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nIn chemical engineering, 'chemical reactors' are vessels designed to contain\nchemical reactions. One example is a pressure reactor. The design of a chemical\nreactor deals with multiple aspects of chemical engineering. Chemical engineers\ndesign reactors to maximize net present value for the given reaction. Designers\nensure that the reaction proceeds with the highest efficiency towards the\ndesired output product, producing the highest yield of product while requiring\nthe least amount of money to purchase and operate. Normal operating expenses\ninclude energy input, energy removal, raw material costs, labor, etc. Energy\nchanges can come in the form of heating or cooling, pumping to increase\npressure, frictional pressure loss (such as pressure drop across a 90Â° elbow or\nan orifice plate), agitation, etc.\n\nChemical reaction engineering is the branch of chemical engineering which\ndeals with chemical reactors and their design, especially by application of\nchemical kinetics.\n","linknr":211,"url":"Chemical_reactor","recorded":1362501831,"links":35,"instances":["in_vessel","chemical_engineering","chemical_engineering","process_engineering"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Chemical reactors"],"headings":["Overview","Types","See also","External links","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/5c/Batch_reactor.2.jpg/180px-Batch_reactor.2.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/0e/Final_half_coil_vessel.JPG/180px-Final_half_coil_vessel.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b9/Chemical_reactor_CSTR_AISI_316.JPG/350px-Chemical_reactor_CSTR_AISI_316.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3b/Pipe-PFR.svg/350px-Pipe-PFR.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["steady-state","chemical_engineering"],["transient_state","chemical_engineering"],["mixing","process_engineering"],["baffle","in_vessel"],["mixing","process_engineering"]],"members":["baffle","transient_state","mixing"],"related":["Chemical_engineering","Chemical_reaction","Pressure_reactor","Chemical_engineering","Orifice_plate","Chemical_reaction_engineering","Chemical_kinetics","Laminar_flow_reactor","Steady-state_(chemical_engineering)","Transient_state_(chemical_engineering)","Reagent","Catalyst","Batch_reactor","Continuous_stirred-tank_reactor_model","Plug_flow_reactor_model","Packed_bed","Catalyst","Fluidized_bed","Fluidized_bed_reactor","Exothermic","Endothermic","Impeller","Mixing_(process_engineering)","Baffle_(in_vessel)","Impeller","Mixing_(process_engineering)","Volumetric_flow_rate","Chemical_kinetics","Percent","Capital_investment","Infinity","Perfect_mixing","Pump","Gradient","Plug_flow","Distillation","Haber_process","Oscillation","Laminar_flow","Reynolds_number","Sintering","Coking","Catalytic_converter","Chemical_engineering","Mass_transfer","Mass_balance","Membrane_reactor","Le_Chatelier's_principle","Heat_transfer","Chemical_kinetics","Thermodynamics","Fluidized_bed_reactor","Chemical_looping_combustion","Bioreactor","Laminar_flow_reactor","Octave_Levenspiel"]}
