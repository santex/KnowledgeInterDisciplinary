{"cursor":"9769","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nIn linguistics, 'inalienable possession' refers to the linguistic properties of\ncertain nouns or nominal affixes based on their always being possessed. The\nsemantic underpinning is that entities like body parts and relatives do not\nexist apart from a possessor. For example, a hand implies (someone's) hand, even\nif it is severed from the whole body. Likewise, a father implies (someone's)\nfather. Such entities are inalienably possessed. Other things, like most\nartifacts and objects in nature, may be possessed or not. When these latter\ntypes of entities are possessed, the possession is 'alienable'. Generally\nspeaking, alienable possession is used for tangible things which you might cease\nto own or possess at some point, such as trade (e.g., \"my money\"), whereas\ninalienable possession refers to a perpetual relationship which cannot be\nreadily severed (e.g., \"my mother\"). Many languages reflect this distinction,\nalthough in different ways. {{cite web\n| url = http://wals.info/feature/description/59 title = Possessive\n| Classification work = World Atlas of Language Structures author = Johanna\n| Nichols and Balthasar Bickel accessdate = 2011-03-06\n}}\n","linknr":156,"url":"Inalienable_possession","recorded":1362570330,"links":15,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://semanticsarchive.net/Archive/WYxOTc5M/barker-possessives.pdf"],"categories":["Grammatical cases","Linguistics"],"headings":["Examples","As an example of a possessive class system","Variation between languages","External links","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Linguistics","Noun","Nominal","Semantic","World_Atlas_of_Language_Structures","World_Atlas_of_Language_Structures","Obligatory_possession","Ojibwe_language","Algonquian_languages","Great_Lakes","Obligatory_possession","World_Atlas_of_Language_Structures","Dholuo","Luo_language","Nilo-Saharan","Kenya","Tanzania","Construct_state","Hawaiian_language","Indo-European_languages","Definite_article","Double_possessive","English_language","AnÃªm_language","Papua_New_Guinea","World_Atlas_of_Language_Structures","Grammatical_construction","Noun_classes","French_language","Grammatical_gender","German_language","Bernd_Heine","Semantic","Morpho-syntactic","Morphophonological","World_Atlas_of_Language_Structures"]}
