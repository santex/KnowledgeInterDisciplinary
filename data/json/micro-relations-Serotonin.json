Biochemically derived from tryptophan, serotonin is primarily\nfound in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, platelets, and in the central nervous\nsystem (CNS) of animals including humans. It is popularly thought to be a\ncontributor to feelings of well-being and happiness.\n\nApproximately 90% of the human body's total serotonin is located in the\nenterochromaffin cells in the alimentary canal (gut), where it is used to\nregulate intestinal movements.\nThe remainder is synthesized in serotonergic neurons of the CNS, where it has\nvarious functions. These include the regulation of mood, appetite, and sleep.\nSerotonin also has some cognitive functions, including memory and learning.\nModulation of serotonin at synapses is thought to be a major action of several\nclasses of pharmacological antidepressants.\n\nSerotonin secreted from the enterochromaffin cells eventually finds its way out\nof tissues into the blood. There, it is actively taken up by blood platelets,\nwhich store it. When the platelets bind to a clot, they disgorge serotonin,\nwhere it serves as a vasoconstrictor and helps to regulate hemostasis and blood\nclotting. Serotonin also is a growth factor for some types of cells, which may\ngive it a role in wound healing.\n\nSerotonin is mainly metabolized to 5-HIAA, chiefly by the liver. Metabolism\ninvolves first oxidation by monoamine oxidase to the corresponding aldehyde.\nThis is followed by oxidation by aldehyde dehydrogenase to 5-HIAA, the indole\nacetic acid derivative. The latter is then excreted by the kidneys. One type of\ntumor, called carcinoid, sometimes secretes large amounts of serotonin into the\nblood, which causes various forms of the carcinoid syndrome of flushing,\ndiarrhea, and heart problems. Because of serotonin's growth-promoting effect on\ncardiac myocytes, persons with serotonin-secreting carcinoid may suffer a right\nheart (tricuspid) valve disease syndrome, caused by proliferation of myocytes\nonto the valve.\n\nIn addition to animals, serotonin is found in fungi and plants. Serotonin's presence in insect venoms and plant\nspines serves to cause pain, which is a side effect of serotonin injection.\nSerotonin is produced by pathogenic amoebae, and its effect on the gut causes\ndiarrhea. Its widespread presence in many seeds and fruits may serve to\nstimulate the digestive tract into expelling the seeds.\n","linknr":2373,"url":"Serotonin","recorded":1362510953,"links":86,"instances":["biochemistry","biology","psychology","anatomy","zoology"],"pdf":["http://userpage.fu-berlin.de/~hpertz/Presentation001.pdf","http://userpage.fu-berlin.de/~hpertz/Presentation001.pdf"],"categories":["Serotonin","Natural
