This in turn comes from Latin, also fuga,\nwhich is itself related to both fugere (\"to flee\") and fugare (\"to\nchase\"). \"Fugue, n.\" The Concise Oxford English Dictionary, eleventh\nedition, revised, ed. Catherine Soanes and Angus Stevenson (Oxford and New York:\nOxford University Press, 2006).  The adjectival form is fugal. \"Fugal,\nadj.\" The Concise Oxford English Dictionary, eleventh edition, revised, ed.\nCatherine Soanes and Angus Stevenson (Oxford and New York: Oxford University\nPress, 2006).  Variants include fughetta (literally, \"a small fugue\") and\nfugato (a passage in fugal style within another work that is not a fugue).\n\nA fugue usually has three sections: an exposition, a development, and a\nrecapitulation containing the return of the subject in the fugue's tonic key,\nthough not all fugues have a recapitulation. Bruce Benward, Music in Theory\nand Practice, 3rd ed. Vol. 2 (Dubuque: Wm. C. Brown Publishers, 1985), 45. ISBN\n0-697-03633-2. In the Middle Ages, the term was widely used to denote any\nworks in canonic style; by the Renaissance, it had come to denote specifically\nimitative works. \"Fugue [Fr. fugue; Ger. Fuge; Lat., It., Sp., fuga].\" The\nHarvard Dictionary of Music (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 2003), \nSince the 17th century, for discussion of the changing use of the term\nthroughout Western music history. the term fugue has described what is\ncommonly regarded as the most fully developed procedure of imitative\ncounterpoint. Leonard G. Ratner, Classic\nMusic: Expression, Form, and Style (London: Collier Macmillan Publishers, 1980),\n263.\n\nMost fugues open with a short main theme, the subject, AndrÃ© GÃ©dalge,\nTreatise on Fugue, trans. A. Levin (Mattapan: Gamut Music Company, 1964),\n7. which then sounds successively in each voice (after the first voice is\nfinished stating the subject, a second voice repeats the subject at a different\npitch, and other voices repeat in the same way); when each voice has entered,\nthe exposition is complete. This is often followed by a connecting passage, or\nepisode, developed from previously heard material; further \"entries\" of the\nsubject then are heard in related keys. Episodes (if applicable) and entries are\nusually alternated until the \"final entry\" of the subject, by which point the\nmusic has returned to the opening key, or tonic, which is often followed by\nclosing material, the coda. \"Fugue\", The Concise Oxford\nDictionary of Music, fourth edition, ed. Michael Kennedy (Oxford and New York:\nOxford University Press, 1996). ISBN 0-19-280037-X  In this sense, a fugue is a style of composition, rather than a\nfixed structure.\n\nThe form evolved during the 18th century from several earlier types of\ncontrapuntal compositions, such as imitative ricercars, capriccios, canzonas,\nand fantasias. The famous fugue composer Johann\nSebastian Bach (1685â1750) shaped his own works after those of Johann Jakob\nFroberger (1616â1667), Johann Pachelbel (1653â1706), Girolamo Frescobaldi\n(1583â1643), Dieterich Buxtehude (c. 1637â1707), and other composers. With the decline of sophisticated styles at the end of the\nbaroque period, the fugue's central role waned, eventually giving way as sonata\nform and the symphony orchestra rose to a dominant position. Nevertheless, composers continued to write and study fugues for various\npurposes; they appear in the works of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756â1791) and Ludwig van Beethoven (1770â1827), as\nwell as modern composers such as Dmitri Shostakovich (1906â1975).\n","linknr":715,"url":"fugal","recorded":1362513122,"links":82,"instances":["music","music","music","music","music","music","music","haydn","rachmaninoff","music","music","haydn","musicologist","haydn","haydn","haydn","pianist","music","haydn","mozart","music","rachmaninoff","music","musical_composition","music_critic","music","music","music","music","beethoven","shostakovich","haydn","music"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Fugues|","Polyphonic
