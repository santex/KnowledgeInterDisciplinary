First Aid for the USMLE Step 1, 2011\nThis can render the resulting protein nonfunctional . Such mutations are responsible for diseases such as\nEpidermolysis bullosa, sickle-cell disease, and SOD1 mediated ALS .\n\nFor example, in the most common variant of sickle-cell disease, the 20th\nnucleotide of the gene for the beta chain of hemoglobin found on chromosome 11\nis erroneously changed from the codon GAG (for glutamic acid) to GUG (which\ncodes valine). Thus, the 6th amino acid is incorrectly substituted (after the\ninitial methionine amino acid is removed) and the protein is significantly\naltered to cause the sickle-cell disease.\n[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim/141900#141900Variants0243 OMIM\n141900.0243]\n\nNot all missense mutations lead to appreciable protein changes. An amino acid\nmay be replaced by an amino acid of very similar chemical properties, in which\ncase, the protein may still function normally; this is termed a neutral,\n\"quiet\", \"silent\" or conservative mutation. Alternatively, the amino acid\nsubstitution could occur in a region of the protein which does not significantly\naffect the protein secondary structure or function. When an amino acid may be\nencoded by more than one codon (so-called \"degenerate coding\") a mutation in a\ncodon may not produce any change in translation; this would be a synonymous\nmutation (a form of silent mutation) and not a missense mutation.\n\nA special type of missense mutation that results in truncation of code is the\nnonsense mutation.\n","linknr":160,"url":"Missense_mutation","recorded":1362483985,"links":23,"instances":["fastpp"],"pdf":["http://www.molecular-cancer.com/content/pdf/1476-4598-10-101.pdf"],"categories":["Mutation"],"headings":["Experimental analysis","References","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/DNA_stub.png/40px-DNA_stub.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["fast_parallel_proteolysis","fastpp"]],"members":["fast_parallel_proteolysis"],"related":["Genetics","Point_mutation","Codon","Amino_acid","Amino_acid","Stop_codon","Nonsense_mutations","Protein","Epidermolysis_bullosa","Sickle-cell_disease","Superoxide_dismutase","Amyotrophic_lateral_sclerosis","Nucleotide","Beta_chain","Hemoglobin","Chromosome","Codon","Glutamic_acid","Valine","Synonymous_mutation","Silent_mutation","Nonsense_mutation","Fast_parallel_proteolysis_(FASTpp)"]}
