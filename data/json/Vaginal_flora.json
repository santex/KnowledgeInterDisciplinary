The amount and type of bacteria present\nhave significant implications for a woman's overall health. The primary\ncolonizing bacteria of a healthy individual are of the genus\nlactobacillus, such as [[Lactobacillus acidophilus|L. acidophilus]]\nand [[Lactobacillus doderlein|L. doderlein]], and the lactic acid they produce\n(some species produce hydrogen peroxide or antibiotic), in combination with\nfluids secreted during sexual arousal, are greatly responsible for the\ncharacteristic scent associated with the vaginal area.\n","linknr":130,"url":"Vaginal_flora","recorded":1362501005,"links":22,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Bacteriology","Bacteria","Health","Feminine hygiene"],"headings":["Menstruation","Disease prevention","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7d/Lactobacillus_sp_01.png/150px-Lactobacillus_sp_01.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Albert_Döderlein","Lactobacillus","Lactic_acid","Sexual_arousal","Menstruation","Tampon","Bacterial_vaginosis","Yeast_infections","Ecological_niche","Urethra","Bacterial_vaginosis","Human_flora","Human_microbiome_project","Skin_flora"]}
