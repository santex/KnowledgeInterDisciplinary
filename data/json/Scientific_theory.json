[http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=6024&page=2 National\nAcademy of Sciences], 1999 [http://www.aaas.org/news/press_room/evolution/qanda.shtml AAAS\nEvolution Resources] Scientists create scientific theories from hypotheses\nthat have been corroborated through the scientific method, then gather evidence\nto test their accuracy. As with all forms of scientific knowledge, scientific\ntheories are inductive in nature and do not make apodictic propositions;\ninstead, they aim for predictive and explanatory force. [http://www.project2061.org/publications/sfaa/online/chap1.htm\nAmerican Association for the Advancement of Science, Project 2061]\n\nThe strength of a scientific theory is related to the diversity of phenomena it\ncan explain, which is measured by its ability to make falsifiable predictions\nwith respect to those phenomena. Theories are improved as more evidence is\ngathered, so that accuracy in prediction improves over time. Scientists use\ntheories as a foundation to gain further scientific knowledge, as well as to\naccomplish goals such as inventing technology or curing disease.\n\nScientific theories are the most reliable, rigorous, and comprehensive form of\nscientific knowledge. This is significantly different\nfrom the word \"theory\" in common usage, which implies that something is\nunsubstantiated or\nspeculative.
