Bassist Mark Hoppus and guitarist Tom DeLonge share\nsongwriting credits on the track.\n\nThe band picked the song as the first single because it was representative of\nthe transition the band had undergone since Take Off Your Pants and Jacket. The song became a critical and commercial success, peaking at\nnumber two on the ''Billboard'' Modern Rock Tracks chart and later certified\ngold by the Recording Industry Association of America. The single's success was\nwidened with the release of its accompanying video, which was frequently played\non music television channels.\n\nMany music journalists, upon release of the song, cited it as a standout track\nfrom the album. True to the evolution of the band, the song is seen as a\ntransition to a more mature style, lyrical and musical, than many of their\nprevious releases. The song can be found on the bandâs [[Greatest Hits (Blink-\n182 album)|Greatest Hits]].\n","linknr":337,"url":"Feeling_This","recorded":1362677314,"links":25,"instances":["magazine","tv_channel","album","music"],"pdf":[],"categories":["2003 singles","Blink-182 songs","Music videos directed by David LaChapelle","Singles certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America","Songs written by Tom DeLonge","Songs written by Mark Hoppus"],"headings":["Background","Composition","Chart success and live history","In popular culture","Music video","Track listing","Chart performance","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e4/Blink-182_-_Feeling_This_cover.jpg/220px-Blink-182_-_Feeling_This_cover.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/87/Gnome-mime-sound-openclipart.svg/50px-Gnome-mime-sound-openclipart.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["blink-182","album"],["i_miss_you","blink-182_song"],["billboard","magazine"],["key","music"],["billboard","magazine"],["spike","tv_channel"],["carousel","blink-182_song"]],"members":["billboard","spike","carousel","key","i_miss_you"],"related":["Blink-182","Blink-182_(album)","CD_single","Gramophone_record","Pop_punk","Alternative_rock","Geffen_Records","Mark_Hoppus","Tom_DeLonge","Jerry_Finn","Recording_Industry_Association_of_America","I_Won't_Be_Home_for_Christmas","I_Miss_You_(Blink-182_song)","Pop_punk","Blink-182","Mark_Hoppus","Tom_DeLonge","Billboard_(magazine)","Modern_Rock_Tracks","RIAA_certification","Recording_Industry_Association_of_America","San_Diego","Flanging","Geffen_Records","Pop_punk","Key_(music)","E_major","Time_signature","Common_time","Tempo","Beats_per_minute","ITunes","Billboard_(magazine)","Modern_Rock_Tracks","United_Kingdom","Spike_(TV_channel)","Spike_Video_Game_Awards","Richard_Cheese","Dystopia","Alexander_Cappelli","David_LaChapelle","Gibson_Guitar_Corporation","Guitar","Fender_Mark_Hoppus_Jazz_Bass","The_Rock_Show","Blink-182","The_Rock_Show","Carousel_(Blink-182_song)","Irish_Recording_Music_Association","Mega_Top_100","The_Official_Charts_Company","Hot_100","Modern_Rock_Tracks"]}
