{"cursor":"2109","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Simultaneity' is the property of two events happening at the same time in at\nleast one frame of reference. The word derives from the Latin simul, at the same\ntime (see sem-1 in Indo-European Roots) plus the suffix -taneous, abstracted\nfrom spontaneous (which in turn comes directly from\nLatin ).\n\nThe noun simult means a supernatural coincidence, two or more divinely inspired\nevents that occur at or near the same period of time that are related to each\nother in both noticeable and unnoticeable characteristics.\n\n* In econometrics, it arises when one or more of the explanatory variables is\n  jointly determined with the dependent variable, typically through an\n  equilibrium mechanism.\n* In criminal law, for a criminal violation to be established, it usually must\n  be shown that there was simultaneity of actus reus and mens rea.\n* In mathematics, a system of equations or a set of simultaneous equations share\n  variables; a solution is a set of variable values for which all these\n  equations are satisfied together.\n* In music, see Simultaneity (music).\n* In physics, see Relativity of simultaneity.\n* In marketing, simultaneity is one of the characteristics of a service which\n  differentiates it from a product. It refers to the idea that the production\n  and consumption of a service occur simultaneously, making it impossible to\n  produce and store a service prior to consumption.\n","linknr":112,"url":"simultaneously","recorded":1362555169,"links":17,"instances":["music","mathematics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Time"],"headings":["See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["set","mathematics"],["simultaneity","music"]],"members":["simultaneity","set"],"related":["Properties","Time","Frame_of_reference","Latin","Coincidence","Hierophany","Pre-established_harmony","Econometrics","Explanatory_variables","Dependent_variable","Economic_equilibrium","Criminal_law","Concurrence","Actus_reus","Mens_rea","Mathematics","Set_(mathematics)","Simultaneous_equations","Music","Simultaneity_(music)","Relativity_of_simultaneity","Marketing","Synchronicity","Non-simultaneity"]}
