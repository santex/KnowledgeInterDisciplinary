{"cursor":"39876","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Prepositions' (or more generally 'adpositions', see below) are a grammatically\ndistinct class of words whose most central members characteristically express\nspatial relations (such as the English words in, under, toward) or serve to mark\nvarious syntactic functions and semantic roles (such as the English words of,\nfor). Huddleston & Pullum (2002), chapter 7. In that the primary\nfunction is relational, a preposition typically combines with another\nconstituent (called its complement) to form a prepositional phrase, relating the\ncomplement to the context in which the phrase occurs.\n\nThe word preposition comes from Latin, a language in which such a word is\nusually placed before its complement. (Thus it is pre-positioned.) English is\nanother such language. In many languages (e.g. Urdu, Turkish, Hindi, Korean and\nJapanese), the words with this grammatical function come after, not before, the\ncomplement. Such words are then commonly called 'postpositions'. Similarly,\n'circumpositions' consist of two parts that appear on both sides of the\ncomplement. The technical term used to refer collectively to prepositions,\npostpositions, and circumpositions is 'adposition'. Some linguists use the word\n\"preposition\" instead of \"adposition\" for all three cases. An example is\nHuddleston & Pullum (2002) (\"CGEL\"), whose choice of terms is discussed on p.\n602.\n\nSome examples of English prepositions (marked as 'bold') as used in phrases are:\n* as an adjunct (locative, temporal, etc.) to a {noun} (marked within\n  curly brackets) ** the {weather} 'in' May ** {cheese} 'from' France\n  'with' live bacteria\n* as an adjunct (locative, temporal, etc.) to a {verb} ** {sleep} 'throughout'\n  the winter ** {danced} 'atop' the tables 'for' hours\n* as an adjunct (locative, temporal, etc.) to an {adjective} ** {happy} 'for'\n  them ** {sick} 'until' recently\n\n\n\nAdpositions perform many of the same functions as case markings, but adpositions\nare syntactic elements, while case markings are morphological elements.\n","linknr":503,"url":"Preposition_and_postposition","recorded":1362566889,"links":73,"instances":["linguistics","linguistics","grammar","linguistics","linguistics","linguistics","linguistics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Syntax","Parts of speech"],"headings":["Definitional issues","Properties","Classification","Overlaps with other categories","Word choice","See also","Notes","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["constituent","linguistics"],["morphology","linguistics"],["complement","linguistics"],["sentence","linguistics"],["copula","linguistics"],["predicate","grammar"],["complement","linguistics"],["complement","linguistics"],["possession","linguistics"]],"members":["sentence","constituent","predicate","possession","complement","copula","morphology"],"related":["Part_of_speech","Constituent_(linguistics)","Adpositional_phrase","Urdu_language","Turkish_language","Hindi_language","Korean_language","Japanese_language","List_of_English_prepositions","Noun","Verb","Adjective","Grammatical_case","Morphology_(linguistics)","Complement_(linguistics)","Noun_phrase","Determiner_phrase","Gerund","World_Atlas_of_Language_Structures","Grammatical_case","Uninflected_word","Inflected_preposition","Morpheme","Closed_class","Syntax","English_language","North_Germanic_languages","Swedish_language","Niger–Congo_languages","List_of_common_English_usage_misconceptions","Winston_Churchill","Grammaticalization","German_language","Duden","German_language","French_language","Polish_language","Chinese_language","Finnish_language","Turkish_language","Latin_language","Linguistic_typology","Sentence_(linguistics)","Subject–object–verb","Adjective","Preposition_stranding","French_language","German_language","Noun_case","Dutch_language","Standard_Chinese","French_language","Swedish_language","Kurdish_language","Nominal_clause","Elliptical_construction","Russian_language","Spanish_language","Copula_(linguistics)","Predicate_(grammar)","Grammatical_case","Complement_(linguistics)","Casally_modulated_preposition","Accusative","Dative","Telic","Telic","Complement_(linguistics)","Telic","Verb_phrase","Possession_(linguistics)","Grammatical_voice","Adverb","Grammatical_particle","Dutch_language","German_Language","Complementizer","Complementizer","Coverb","Chinese_language","Standard_Chinese","Grammatical_case","Instrumental_case","Latin_language","Latin_language","Japanese_language","Korean_language","Turkish_language","Finnish_language","Vowel_harmony","Otto_Jespersen","Agglutinative_language","Isolating_language","Sanskrit","Ambiguity","Instrumental_case","Indo-European_languages","Grammatical_gender","Grammatical_number","Noun","Grammatical_modifier","American_English","Spanish_language","Portuguese_language","Casally_modulated_prepositions","Japanese_particles","List_of_English_prepositions","Old_English_prepositions","Relational_noun","Spanish_prepositions"]}
