It does this\n by utilizing frequencies that are not used by a voice telephone call. ANSI\n T1.413-1998 \"Network and Customer Installation Interfaces â Asymmetric Digital\n Subscriber Line (ADSL) Metallic Interface.\" (American National Standards\n Institute 1998) A splitter, or DSL filter, allows a single telephone\n connection to be used for both ADSL service and voice calls at the same time.\n ADSL can generally only be distributed over short distances from the telephone\n exchange (the last mile), typically less than , Data and Computer\n Communications, William Stallings, ISBN 0-13-243310-9, ISBN 978-0-13-243310-\n 5 but has been known to exceed if the originally laid wire gauge allows\n for further distribution.\n\nAt the telephone exchange the line generally terminates at a digital subscriber\nline access multiplexer (DSLAM) where another frequency splitter separates the\nvoice band signal for the conventional phone network. Data carried by the ADSL\nare typically routed over the telephone company's data network and eventually\nreach a conventional Internet Protocol network.\n","linknr":333,"url":"Asymmetric_Digital_Subscriber_Line","recorded":1362554373,"links":68,"instances":["networking","computing","electronics","engineering","networking","telecommunications"],"pdf":[],"categories":["ITU-T recommendations","Digital subscriber line","Internet terminology"],"headings":["Overview","Operation","Installation problems","Transport protocols","ADSL standards","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/ADSL_router_with_Wi-Fi_%28802.11_b-g%29.jpg/220px-ADSL_router_with_Wi-Fi_%28802.11_b-g%29.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/87/ADSL_frequency_plan.svg/220px-ADSL_frequency_plan.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e1/ADSL_spectrum_Fritz_Box_Fon_WLAN.png/220px-ADSL_spectrum_Fritz_Box_Fon_WLAN.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/ADSL_annex_overview.svg/600px-ADSL_annex_overview.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["signal","electronics"],["bandwidth","computing"],["downstream","networking"],["upstream","networking"],["duplex","telecommunications"],["upstream","networking"],["downstream","networking"],["latency","engineering"]],"members":["upstream","bandwidth","signal","latency","downstream","duplex"],"related":["Digital_subscriber_line","Copper","Telephone_line","Voiceband","Modem","Telephone_call","DSL_filter","Telephone_exchange","Last_mile","Wire_gauge","Digital_subscriber_line_access_multiplexer","Signal_(electronics)","Telecommunications_network","Telephone_company","Internet_Protocol","Symmetric_digital_subscriber_line","Bandwidth_(computing)","Bit_rate","Downstream_(networking)","Upstream_(networking)","Internet_access","Download","Crosstalk","Leased_line","Duplex_(telecommunications)","Time-division_duplex","Upstream_(networking)","Downstream_(networking)","POTS","KHz","Orthogonal_frequency-division_multiplexing","DSL_modem","Signal-to-noise_ratio","Telephone_exchange","AM_broadcasting","Signal-to-noise_ratio","Point-to-Point_Protocol_over_ATM","Modulation","VDSL","Carrierless_Amplitude_Phase_Modulation","Orthogonal_frequency-division_multiplexing","Interleaving","Burst_noise","Reed–Solomon_codeword","Forward_error_correction","Latency_(engineering)","Round-trip-time","Plain_old_telephone_service","RedCARE","DSL_filter","Demarcation_point","Electronic_filter","DSL_filter","Attenuation","Repetitive_Electrical_Impulse_Noise","STM-1","Synchronous_Digital_Hierarchy","Asynchronous_Transfer_Mode","Packet_Transfer_Mode","PPPoA","PPPoE","Transmission_Control_Protocol","Internet_Protocol","OSI_model","Internet","ANSI_T1.413_Issue_2","ITU_G.992.1","G.DMT","ITU_G.992.1_Annex_A","ITU_G.992.1_Annex_B","ITU_G.992.2","G.Lite","ITU_G.992.3","ITU_G.992.3_Annex_J","ITU_G.992.3_Annex_L","ITU_G.992.4","ITU_G.992.5","ITU_G.992.5_Annex_M","Broadband_Internet_access","Digital_subscriber_line_access_multiplexer","ADSL_loop_extender","Low-pass_filter","ADSL_splitter","Symmetric_Digital_Subscriber_Line","Rate-Adaptive_Digital_Subscriber_Line","Flat_rate","Attenuation_distortion","List_of_device_bandwidths","Single-pair_high-speed_digital_subscriber_line"]}
