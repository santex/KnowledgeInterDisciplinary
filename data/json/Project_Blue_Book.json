      "text" : "'Project Blue Book' was one of a series of systematic studies of unidentified\nflying objects (UFOs) conducted by the United States Air Force. Started in 1952,\nit was the second revival of such a study (the first two of its kind being\nProjects Sign and Grudge). A termination order was given for the study in\nDecember 1969, and all activity under its auspices ceased in January 1970.<!--\nsee research by Brad Sparks in \"the end\" below to support 1970 date-->\n\nProject Blue Book had two goals:\n# to determine if UFOs were a threat to national security, and to scientifically\n# analyze UFO-related data.\nThousands of UFO reports were collected, analyzed and filed. As the result of\nthe [[Condon Report]] (1968), which concluded there was nothing anomalous about\nUFOs, Project Blue Book was ordered shut down in December 1969 and the Air Force\ncontinues to provide the following summary of its investigations:\n\n{{blockquote| #No UFO reported, investigated and evaluated by the Air Force was\never an indication of threat to our national security; #There was no evidence\nsubmitted to or discovered by the Air Force that sightings categorized as\n\"unidentified\" represented technological developments or principles beyond the\nrange of modern scientific knowledge; and #There was no evidence indicating that\nsightings categorized as \"unidentified\" were extraterrestrial vehicles.<ref>[ht-\ntp://www.af.mil/information/factsheets/factsheet_print.asp?fsID=188&page=1\n\"UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS AND AIR FORCE PROJECT BLUE BOOK\"] URL accessed\nFebruary 21, 2010</ref>}}\n\nBy the time Project Blue Book ended, it had collected 12,618 UFO reports, and\nconcluded that most of them were misidentifications of natural phenomena\n(clouds, stars, etc.) or conventional aircraft. According to the National\nReconnaissance Office a number of the reports could be explained by flights of\nthe formerly secret reconnaissance planes U-2 and A-12.<ref></ref> A small\npercentage of UFO reports were classified as unexplained, even after stringent\nanalysis. The UFO reports were archived and are available under the Freedom of\nInformation Act, but names and other personal information of all witnesses have\nbeen changed.\n",
