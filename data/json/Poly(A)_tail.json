{"cursor":"49770","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Polyadenylation' is the addition of a 'poly(A) tail' to an RNA molecule. The\npoly(A) tail consists of multiple adenosine monophosphates; in other words, it\nis a stretch of RNA that has only adenine bases. In eukaryotes, polyadenylation\nis part of the process that produces mature messenger RNA (mRNA) for\ntranslation. It, therefore, forms part of the larger process of gene expression.\n\nThe process of polyadenylation begins as the transcription of a gene finishes,\nor terminates. The 3'-most segment of the newly-made RNA is first cleaved off by\na set of proteins; these proteins then synthesize the poly(A) tail at the RNA's\n3' end. In some genes, these proteins may add a poly(A) tail at any one of\nseveral possible sites. Therefore, polyadenylation can produce more than one\ntranscript from a single gene (alternative polyadenylation), similar to\nalternative splicing.\n\nThe poly(A) tail is important for the nuclear export, translation, and stability\nof mRNA. The tail is shortened over time, and, when it is short enough, the mRNA\nis enzymatically degraded. However, in a few cell types,\nmRNAs with short poly(A) tails are stored for later activation by re-\npolyadenylation in the cytosol. In contrast, when\npolyadenylation occurs in bacteria, it promotes RNA degradation. This\nis also sometimes the case for eukaryotic non-coding RNAs.\n","linknr":994,"url":"Poly(A)_tail","recorded":1362374300,"links":30,"instances":["biology","molecular_biology","svlpa","biology","genetics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Gene expression","RNA"],"headings":["Background on RNA","Nuclear polyadenylation","Cytoplasmic polyadenylation","Tagging for degradation in eukaryotes","In prokaryotes and organelles","Evolution","History","See also","References","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/ba/MRNA_structure.svg/430px-MRNA_structure.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f4/RNA_chemical_structure_adenine.JPG/220px-RNA_chemical_structure_adenine.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Alternative_polyadenylation.svg/350px-Alternative_polyadenylation.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/0c/Bacterial_PNPase_and_polyadenylation.svg/290px-Bacterial_PNPase_and_polyadenylation.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/94/Symbol_support_vote.svg/15px-Symbol_support_vote.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["translation","biology"],["transcription","genetics"],["transcription","genetics#termination"],["directionality","molecular_biology"],["transcription","genetics"],["translation","biology"],["poly(a-binding_protein"],["translation","biology"],["domain","biology"],["simian_virus_40_late_polyadenylation_signal","svlpa"]],"members":["domain","directionality","simian_virus_40_late_polyadenylation_signal","translation","transcription"],"related":["RNA","Adenosine_monophosphate","Adenine","Eukaryote","Messenger_RNA","Translation_(biology)","Gene_expression","Transcription_(genetics)","Gene","Directionality_(molecular_biology)","Protein_complex","Alternative_splicing","Non-coding_RNA","Adenine","Cytosine","Guanine","Uracil","Transcription_(genetics)","DNA","Translation_(biology)","Cytoplasm","Histone","Histone_3'_UTR_stem-loop","MicroRNA","Long_noncoding_RNA","Regulation_of_gene_expression","Xist","X_chromosome_inactivation","Cleavage_and_polyadenylation_specificity_factor","Cleavage_stimulatory_factor","Polynucleotide_adenylyltransferase","PABPN1","Cleavage_factor","Cleavage_factor","RNA_polymerase_II","Precursor_mRNA","Polyadenylate_polymerase","Adenosine_monophosphate","Adenosine_triphosphate","Pyrophosphate","Nucleotide","Spliceosome","Intron","Poly(A)-binding_protein","Exosome_complex","Eukaryotic_initiation_factor","40S","Somatic_cell","Oocyte","Egg_activation","PARN","5'_cap","3'_end","Three_prime_untranslated_region","MicroRNA","CSTF2","Cleavage_stimulatory_factor","Macrophage","Lipopolysaccharide","Lysozyme","Tumor_necrosis_factor-alpha","DNA_methylation","Germ_line","Embryogenesis","Chemical_synapse","Neuron","Translation_(biology)","Long-term_potentiation","Cleavage_and_polyadenylation_specificity_factor","CPEB","PUM1","Non-coding_RNA","Transfer_RNA","Ribosomal_RNA","Small_nuclear_RNA","SnoRNA","Saccharomyces_cerevisiae","TRAMP_complex","Exosome_complex","Degradosome","Secondary_structure","Trypanosomatid","Mitochondrion","Polynucleotide_phosphorylase","Plastid","Archaea","Exosome_complex","Domain_(biology)","Last_universal_ancestor","Polynucleotide_phosphorylase","Degradosome","Exosome_complex","Adenosine_diphosphate","Adenosine_triphosphate","TRNT1","Transfer_RNA","Polymerase","Archaea","Cyanobacteria","Enzyme","Simian_virus_40_late_polyadenylation_signal_(SVLPA)"]}
