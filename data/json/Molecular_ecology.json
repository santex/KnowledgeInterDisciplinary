{"cursor":"2649","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"for|the scientific journal|Molecular Ecology}}\n\n'Molecular ecology' is a field of evolutionary biology that is concerned with\napplying molecular population genetics, molecular phylogenetics, and more\nrecently genomics to traditional ecological questions (e.g., species diagnosis,\nconservation and assessment of biodiversity, species-area relationships, and\nmany questions in behavioral ecology). It is virtually synonymous with the field\nof \"Ecological Genetics\" as pioneered by Theodosius Dobzhansky, E. B. Ford,\nGodfrey M. Hewitt and others. These fields are united in their attempt to study\ngenetic-based questions \"out in the field\" as opposed to the laboratory.\nMolecular ecology is related to the field of Conservation genetics.\n\nMethods frequently include using microsatellites to determine gene flow and\nhybridization between populations. The development of molecular ecology is also\nclosely related to the use of DNA microarrays, which allows for the simultaneous\nanalysis of the expression of thousands of different genes. real-time polymerase\nchain reaction may also be used to analyze gene expression as a result of\nchanges in environmental conditions or different response by differently adapted\nindividuals.\n","linknr":111,"url":"Molecular_ecology","recorded":1362503349,"links":17,"instances":["molecular_biology","biology","genetics","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Subfields of ecology","Molecular biology"],"headings":["Bacterial diversity","See also","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["microsatellite","genetics"],["hybrid","biology"],["strain","biology"],["primer","molecular_biology"]],"members":["primer","strain","microsatellite","hybrid"],"related":["Evolutionary_biology","Population_genetics","Genomics","Ecology","Theodosius_Dobzhansky","E._B._Ford","Godfrey_Hewitt","Conservation_genetics","Microsatellite_(genetics)","Hybrid_(biology)","Microarray","Real-time_polymerase_chain_reaction","Gene_expression","Microorganisms","Strain_(biology)","Polymerase_chain_reaction","DNA","Primer_(molecular_biology)","Plasmid","Temperature_gradient_gel_electrophoresis","Ecological_genetics"]}
