Raymond Ackerman was chairman until he\nstepped down in 2010. http://allafrica.com/stories/201003110609.html\nHe is also well known for his philanthropic activities. He purchased four stores\nfrom Jack Goldin in the sixties.\n\nAfter graduating from the University of Cape Town with a Bachelor of Commerce,\nhe joined the Greatermans group in the Ackermans division in 1951 at the age of\n20 as a trainee manager. Ackermans had been founded just after World War I by\nhis father Gus, but was sold to the Greatermans group in 1940.\n\nAckerman was eventually offered a position at Greatermans head office in\nJohannesburg. In the early 1950s, food retailing supermarkets first began to\nappear on the scene in South Africa. Norman Herber, chairman of Greatermans\ndecided to start a food retailer called Checkers. Ackerman was eventually put in\ncharge of Checkers, making a resounding success out the business.\n\nAckerman won the Outstanding Young South African award in 1965, along with Gary\nPlayer and by 1966, at the age of 35, he was the managing director of 85\nCheckers stores; however, he was fired in the same year. In response, using his\nseverance pay and a bank loan, Ackerman bought four stores in Cape Town trading\nunder the name Pick 'n Pay. Under his leadership, Pick 'n Pay eventually grew\ninto one of Africa's largest supermarket chains, with a thirty seven billion [http://www.pnp.taps-\nnodes.co.za/fin2006/store_income_statement.htm Store income statement]\nRand turnover (2006 figure) and more than 124 supermarkets, 14 hypermarkets and\n179 franchised outlets. The Pick 'n Pay Group employs more than 30 000 people in\nseveral Southern African countries and Australia.\n\nAckerman has fought many battles with the South African government (both pre-\nand post-1994) in his attempts to free up the highly regulated South African\nfuel industry.\n\nAckerman is married and has four children, all of whom are involved in the\nbusiness in various capacities. He received an honorary Doctorate in Law from\nRhodes University in 1986 and an honorary Doctorate in Commerce from the\nUniversity of Cape Town in 2001.\n\nHe was voted 79th in the Top 100 Great South Africans in 2004.\n\nAckerman, together with his wife Wendy were awarded the 2010 David\nRockefeller Bridging Leadership in Africa Award by The Synergos Institute\nSouthern Africa
