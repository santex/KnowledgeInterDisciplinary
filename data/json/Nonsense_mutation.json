{"cursor":"4767","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In genetics, a 'nonsense mutation' is a point mutation in a sequence of DNA that\nresults in a premature stop codon, or a nonsense codon in the transcribed mRNA,\nand in a truncated, incomplete, and usually nonfunctional protein product. It\ndiffers from a missense mutation, which is a point mutation where a single\nnucleotide is changed to cause substitution of a different amino acid. Some\ngenetic disorders, such as thalassemia and DMD, result from nonsense mutations.\n","linknr":163,"url":"Nonsense_mutation","recorded":1362483985,"links":21,"instances":["genetics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Mutation"],"headings":["Simple example","Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay","Pathology associated with nonsense mutations","See also","External links and references"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/72/Notable_mutations.svg/300px-Notable_mutations.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["transcription","genetics"]],"members":["transcription"],"related":["Genetics","Point_mutation","DNA_sequence","DNA","Stop_codon","Transcription_(genetics)","MRNA","Truncation","Protein","Missense_mutation","Amino_acid","Genetic_disorder","Thalassemia","Duchenne_muscular_dystrophy","Methionine","Threonine","Histidine","Arginine","Alanine","Arginine","Serine","Cytosine","Thymine","Methionine","Threonine","Histidine","Yeast","Nonsense-mediated_mRNA_decay","Amino_acids","Dystrophin","Duchenne_muscular_dystrophy","Cystic_fibrosis","Cystic_fibrosis_transmembrane_conductance_regulator","Duchenne_muscular_dystrophy","Beta_thalassaemia","Hurler_syndrome","PTC124","Nonsense_suppressor"]}
