A graduate of Kyoto University, he held numerous minor bureaucratic\nposts before becoming Minister of Education in the first Konoe cabinet (1937),\nand Home Minister in the Hiranuma Cabinet (1939). During the period from 1937 to\n1939 Kido adopted the conspirator's views and devoted himself to this policy\nwholeheartedly. As education minister he applied himself to the development of a\nwarlike spirit in Japan. He was active with Konoye to replace existing political\nparties with a single party to dominate all political action. Lord Keeper of the\nPrivy Seal (1940), he recommended to the Emperor that Fumimaro Konoe succeed\nMitsumasa Yonai for a second term as Prime Minister of Japan. In 1941, he\nrecommended that Hideki TÅjÅ become Prime Minister after Konoe.\n\nKido was also one of the more cautious advisors to the emperor at the beginning\nof World War II (because he feared the powers of western allies), and one of\nthe chief advocates of peace at the end (trying to ingratiate himself with the\nconquerors). Kido is known to have advised the emperor against attacking the\nDutch East Indies in 1941, explaining that such an attack might provoke the\nUnited States into war, and that any oil obtained by taking the East Indies\nwould still have to be transported, and would be subject to blockades and\nattacks by plane and submarine. Kido also claimed after the war that Emperor\nHirohito was never aware of the plans to attack Pearl Harbor until after the\nattack occurred. Four years later, at the end of the war, Kido is generally\ncredited with convincing the government to accept the Potsdam Declaration and\nsurrender. He also convinced the emperor that it would be necessary to deliver\na personal speech in order to ensure that all civilians and soldiers would\ncease fighting.\n\n, 1947]]\n\nKido was not only the chief advisor to the emperor; he was a major liaison\nbetween the emperor and the government, and a representative of the Japanese\ngovernment to the Allied Occupation Forces. He advised General MacArthur on many\naspects of the logistics surrounding the surrender, the end of the war, and the\nOccupation of Japan. One of his chief motives was consistently to protect the\nhonor of the emperor.\n\nIn the International Military Tribunal for the Far East held in Tokyo after the\nwar, Kido was charged as a Class A War Criminal. He initially attempted to plead\nguilty in order to protect the emperor by taking all responsibility for imperial\ndecisions advocating war unto himself. His personal diary, kept in detail since\n1930, was voluntarily turned over to the prosecution, and became a famous and\nimportant document in determining the internal workings of the Japanese\ngovernment during the war. However, none of the lengthy interrogations of Kido\nwere ever entered into direct evidence, and in his testimony as well as the\nparts of the diary released to the public, he never quoted the Emperor's exact\nwords. Kido was found guilty of Counts 1, 27, 29, 31, and 32, and was sentenced\nto life imprisonment in Sugamo Prison, Tokyo.\n\nIn 1951, as the Occupation of Japan was ending, Kido sent a message to the\nemperor, advising him as he had advised three years earlier, to accept\nresponsibility for the defeat and abdicate, at the end of the American\nOccupation. In addition, Kido opposed the idea of continuing to punish war\ncriminals under Japanese law after the end of the American Occupation. According\nto his diary, \"those called war criminals by the enemy's standards, especially\nthose in responsible positions, were all performing loyal duties, and to punish\nthem in the name of the emperor would be unbearable\" (Dower 477).\n\nIn 1953, due to health problems, Kido was released from prison. He lived the\nrest of his life in Oiso, and had a flat in Tokyo's Aoyama. He died at age 87 in\n1977. His grave is at the Tama Cemetery in Tokyo.\n\n{| cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"1\" valign=\"top\" align=\"center\"\n!colspan=4| Cabinet Positions held by Kido KÅichi:\n|-\n!Prime Minister !!
