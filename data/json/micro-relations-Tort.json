Eleventh Edition. Stevens.\n1982. p. 9 Tort law deals with situations where a person's behaviour has\nunfairly caused someone else to suffer loss or harm. A tort is not necessarily\nan illegal act but causes harm. The law allows anyone who is harmed to recover\ntheir loss. Tort law is different from criminal law, which deals with\nsituations where a person's actions cause harm to society in general. A claim\nin tort may be brought by anyone who has suffered loss after suing a civil law\nsuit. Criminal cases tend to be brought by the state, although private\nprosecutions are possible.\n\nTort law is also differentiated from equity, in which a petitioner complains of\na violation of some right. One who commits a tortious act is called a\n'tortfeasor'. The equivalent of tort in civil law jurisdictions is delict. Tort\nmay be defined as a personal injury; or as \"a civil action other than a breach\nof contract.\" [http://pearsonrowe.co.uk/accidents/personal-injury-\narticles/what-is-tort-law.html What is Tort Law?]. Pearson Rowe Solicitors.\nRetrieved 18 December 2011.\n\nA person who suffers a tortious injury is entitled to receive compensation for\n\"damages\", usually monetary, from the person or people responsible â or liable â\nfor those injuries. Tort law defines what is a legal injury and, therefore,\nwhether a person may be held liable for an injury they have caused. Legal\ninjuries are not limited to physical injuries. They may also include emotional,\neconomic, or reputational injuries as well as violations of privacy, property,\nor constitutional rights. Tort cases therefore comprise such varied topics as\nauto accidents, false imprisonment, defamation, product liability (for defective\nconsumer products), copyright infringement, and environmental pollution (toxic\ntorts), among many others.\n\nIn much of the common law world, the most prominent tort liability is\nnegligence. If the injured party can prove that the person believed to have\ncaused the injury acted negligently â that is, without taking reasonable care to\navoid injuring others â tort law will allow compensation.\n\nHowever, tort law also recognizes intentional torts, where a person has\nintentionally acted in a way that harms another, and \"strict liability\" or quasi-\ntort, which allows recovery under certain circumstances without the need to\ndemonstrate negligence.\n","linknr":466,"url":"Tort","recorded":1362572410,"links":38,"instances":["tort","scots_law","law","jewish_law","legal_system"],"pdf":["http://www.sfu.ca/~allen/CoaseJLE1960.pdf"],"categories":["Tort law|"],"headings":["Etymology","Categories","Liability, defenses, and remedies","Theory and reform","Overlap with criminal law","Legal jurisdiction","See also","Notes","Bibliography","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/Scale_of_justice_2.svg/70px-Scale_of_justice_2.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["equity","law"],["civil_law","legal_system"],["special_relationship","tort"],["delict","scots_law"],["damages","jewish_law"]],"members":["special_relationship","delict","equity","damages","civil_law"],"related":["Common_law","Civil_wrong","Glanville_Williams","Criminal_law","Private_prosecution","Equity_(law)","Civil_law_(legal_system)","Delict","Legal_liability","Auto_accidents","False_imprisonment","Defamation","Product_liability","Copyright_infringement","Toxic_torts","Common_law","Negligence","Quasi-tort","Middle_English","Anglo-Norman_language","Medieval_Latin","Latin","Torture","Libel","Slander","Workers'_compensation","Proximate_cause","Duty_of_care","Special_relationship_(tort)","Occupiers'_liability","Quasi-tort","Queen's_Bench","Free_market_environmentalism","Calculus_of_negligence","Injunction","Australian","Specific_performance","Defendant","Aggravated","Punitive_damages","Glanville_Williams","Risk","Ronald_Coase","Transaction_cost","P._S._Atiyah","New_Zealand","Command_Paper","U.S.","Anti-trust","Punitive_damages","Pure_economic_loss","English_law","Damages","Injunctive_relief","Incarceration","Legal_burden_of_proof","O._J._Simpson_murder_case","O._J._Simpson","Murder","Preponderance_of_the_evidence","Wrongful_death","Punitive_damages","Nuisance","Law_of_England_and_Wales","Common_law","Australian_tort_law","Canadian_tort_law","English_tort_law","Delict_(Scots_law)","United_States_tort_law","Irish_tort_law","Damages_(Jewish_law)","Israeli_law","British_Mandate_of_Palestine","Outline_of_tort_law","Index_of_tort_articles"]}
