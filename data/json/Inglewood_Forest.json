{"cursor":"3825","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Inglewood Forest' is the name now given on maps to a large tract of mainly\narable and dairy farm land with a few small woodland areas between Carlisle and\nPenrith in the English non-metropolitan county of Cumbria or ancient county of\nCumberland.\n\nSoon after the Norman conquest of England this area became a Royal Forest. The\nword forest in this sense did not necessarily mean a wooded area but one that\nwas set aside for hunting though several areas of Inglewood were heavily wooded.\nThe animals that were hunted in this area were mainly deer and wild boars.\n\nInglewood means the \"Wood of the English or Angles\": although Cumbria is usually\nthought of as a Celtic region, Angles did migrate here before the Viking\nInvasions and the rule of the area by the Scottish Kingdom of Strathclyde, and\nthe name suggests significant numbers had settled here.\n\nThe forest boundaries changed many times and included at one time most of the\nCumberland wards of Leath and Cumberland but the core or heart of the forest was\nthe parishes of Hesket-in-the-Forest, Skelton and Hutton-in-the-Forest.\n\nAndrew of Wyntoun's Orygynale Chronicle (written c.1420) places the forest as\nthe original setting of the Robin Hood legend, the following is taken from the\nchronicle: Joseph Bain (ed.), Calendar of documents relating to\nScotland, volume 2.\n\n:\"Lytil Jhon and Robyne Hude\n:Wayth-men ware commendyd gude :In'Yngil-wode' and Barnysdale :Thai oysyd all\nthis tyme thare trawale.\"\n\nThe forest ultimately belonged to the English Crown and was governed by the\nstrict Forest Law exercised by wardens. In the reign of Henry VIII the forest\nlaws were repealed and Inglewood ceased to be a Royal Forest although it is\nstill to this day marked on maps as such\".\n\nThe borough and city of Carlisle (the area within the city walls) was outside\nthe forest though Penrith was within it and was the main administrative centre\nand market town for the southern part of the region.\n\nThe manors of Penrith, Great Salkeld, Langwathby, Carlatton (not Carleton as it\nsometimes said to be), Castle Sowerby and Scotby were collectively known as the\nHonour of Penrith and were at first given to the Scottish crown in exchange for\nScotland giving up its claim to all of Cumberland. In 1272 King Alexander III\ncomplained that a William de Leyburne, the local seneschal, has unlawfully\nappropriated the manors' rents. Later Edward I took them for himself. Later they\npassed to the Neville family but came back to being Crown property during the\nWars of the Roses and remained so until the joint reign of William III and Mary\nII. The honour was also known as \"The Queen's Hames\" due to the fact the manors\nwere often given to a Queen consort on her marriage or at the death of the\nprevious consort. The last Queen consort to be Lady of the Manor or Honour was\nQueen Catharine of Braganza, consort of Charles II.\n","linknr":134,"url":"Inglewood_Forest","recorded":1374764783,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Inglewood_Forest&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Inglewood_Forest&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Royal.Forests.1327.1336.selected.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e9/Royal.Forests.1327.1336.selected.jpg/300px-Royal.Forests.1327.1336.selected.jpg","/wiki/Carlisle,_Cumbria","/wiki/Penrith,_Cumbria","/wiki/England","/wiki/Non-metropolitan_county","/wiki/Cumbria","/wiki/Cumberland","/wiki/Norman_conquest_of_England","/wiki/Royal_Forest","/wiki/Deer","/wiki/Boars","/wiki/Celt","/wiki/Angles","/wiki/Scotland","/wiki/Kingdom_of_Strathclyde","/wiki/Ward_(politics)","/wiki/Leath","/wiki/Cumberland_(ward)","/wiki/Hesket,_Cumbria","/wiki/Skelton,_Cumbria","/wiki/Hutton-in-the-Forest","/wiki/Andrew_of_Wyntoun","/wiki/Robin_Hood","#cite_note-Bain-1","#cite_note-Bain-1","/wiki/British_Crown","/wiki/Forest_Law","/wiki/Henry_VIII_of_England","#cite_note-Bain-1","/wiki/Market_town","/wiki/Manorialism","/wiki/Great_Salkeld","/wiki/Langwathby","/wiki/Carlatton","/wiki/Castle_Sowerby","/wiki/Scotby,_Cumbria","/wiki/Honour","/wiki/King_of_Scots","/wiki/Alexander_III_of_Scotland","/wiki/Edward_I_of_England","/wiki/Earl_of_Westmorland","/wiki/Wars_of_the_Roses","/wiki/William_III_of_England","/wiki/Mary_II_of_England","/wiki/Queen_consort","/wiki/Catharine_of_Braganza","/wiki/Charles_II_of_England","/w/index.php?title=Inglewood_Forest&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Clim_of_the_Clough","/wiki/Whinfell_Forest","/w/index.php?title=Inglewood_Forest&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-Bain_1-0","#cite_ref-Bain_1-1","#cite_ref-Bain_1-2","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Inglewood_Forest&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Template:Citation_needed","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system","//tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Inglewood_Forest&params=54_47_N_2_55_W_region:GB_type:forest_source:GNS-enwiki","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Inglewood_Forest&oldid=552203438","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Forests_and_woodlands_of_Cumbria","/wiki/Category:English_royal_forests","/wiki/Category:Articles_needing_additional_references_from_February_2007","/wiki/Category:All_articles_needing_additional_references","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Inglewood+Forest&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Inglewood+Forest","/wiki/Inglewood_Forest","/wiki/Talk:Inglewood_Forest","#","/wiki/Inglewood_Forest","/w/index.php?title=Inglewood_Forest&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Inglewood_Forest&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Inglewood_Forest","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Inglewood_Forest","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Inglewood_Forest&oldid=552203438","/w/index.php?title=Inglewood_Forest&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q11977232","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Inglewood_Forest&id=552203438","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Inglewood+Forest","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Inglewood+Forest&oldid=552203438&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Inglewood_Forest&printable=yes","//no.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inglewood_(England)","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q11977232#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-Sha
