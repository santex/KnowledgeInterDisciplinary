Before the arrival of printing, all documents and\n books were manuscripts. In publishing and academic contexts, a manuscript is\n the text submitted to the publisher or printer in preparation for publication,\n regardless of the format. Until recently a typescript prepared on a typewriter\n was usual, but today a digital file with a printout, prepared in manuscript\n format is most common.\n\nManuscripts are not defined by their contents, which may combine writing with\nmathematical calculations, maps, explanatory figures or illustrations.\nManuscripts may be in book form, scrolls or in codex format. Illuminated\nmanuscripts are enriched with pictures, border decorations, elaborately embossed\ninitial letters or full-page illustrations. They were written by earlier people.\n","title":"manuscript","headings":["Cultural background","Modern variations","European manuscript history","Preparing a manuscript","A sample of common genres of manuscripts","Different Scripts","Major US Repositories of Medieval Manuscripts","See also","External links","Work cited"]},"micro-relation":["3: Woodblock_printing","2: Illuminated_manuscript","2: Printing_press","2: Vellum","2: Papyrus","2: Dead_Sea_scrolls","2: Classical_antiquity","2: Latin","2: Digital_Scriptorium","1: History_of_the_Peloponnesian_War","1: Manuscript_format","1: Codex","1: Moveable_type","1: Birch_bark_document","1: Palm_leaf_manuscript","1: Paper","1: Scriptorium","1: Sarcophagus","1: Mummy","1: Midden","1: Oxyrhynchus","1: Nag_Hammadi_library","1: Tocharian_languages","1: Tarim_Basin","1: Villa_of_the_Papyri","1: Herculaneum","1: Diamond_Sutra","1: Textual_criticism#Stemmatics","1: Southeast_Asia","1: Intaglio_printing","1: Philippines","1: Dot-matrix_printer","1: Burma","1: Italy","1: Etruria","1: Bulgaria","1: Palaeography","1: Christian_era","1: Scriptio_continua","1: Greek_language","1: Majuscule","1: Lower_case","1: Hebrew_language","1: Uncial","1: Cursive","1: Library_science","1: High_Middle_Ages","1: Late_Middle_Ages","1: Late_Antiquity","1: Parchment","1: Egypt","1: Paper_quire#Quire","1: The_Bible","1: Book_of_hours","1: Illuminated_manuscripts","1: Christian_prayer","1: Psalms#The_Psalms_in_Christian_worship","1: Initials","1: Merovingian_script","1: Abbey_of_Luxeuil","1: Columba","1: Caroline_minuscule","1: Calligraphy","1: Europe","1: Latin_alphabet","1: Holy_Roman_Empire","1: Carolingian_Renaissance","1: Tours","1: The_Morgan_Library_&_Museum","1: Beinecke_Rare_Book_and_Manuscript_Library","1: Walters_Art_Museum","1: Houghton_Library","1: Huntington_Library","1: Newberry_Library","1: Cornell_University_Library","1: Armenian_Illuminated_manuscript","1: Dead_Sea_Scrolls","1: GenkÅ_yÅshi","1: Gospel_Book","1: List_of_Hiberno-Saxon_illustrated_manuscripts","1: Manuscript_culture","1: Music_manuscript","1: Palm-leaf_manuscript","1: Preservation_of_Illuminated_Manuscripts","1: Voynich_manuscript","1: Sarasvati_Mahal_Library"]}
