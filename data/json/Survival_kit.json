Military aircraft, lifeboats, and spacecraft\nare equipped with survival kits.\n\nSurvival kits, in a variety of sizes, contain supplies and tools to provide a\nperson with basic shelter against the elements, help them keep warm, meet their\nhealth and first aid needs, provide food and water, signal to rescuers, and\nassist them in finding their way back to help. Supplies in a survival kit\nnormally contain a knife (often a Swiss army knife or a multi-tool), matches,\ntinder, first aid kit, bandana, fish hooks, sewing kit, and a flashlight.\n\nCivilians such as forestry workers, surveyors, or bush pilots, who work in\nremote locations or in regions with extreme climate conditions may also be\nequipped with survival kits. Disaster supplies are also kept on hand by those\nwho live in areas prone to earthquakes or other natural disasters. For the\naverage citizen to practice disaster preparedness, some towns will have survival\nstores to keep survival supplies in stock.\n\nThe American Red Cross recommends an emergency preparedness kit that is easy to\ncarry and use in the event of an emergency or disaster.\n","linknr":304,"url":"Survival_kit","recorded":1362539573,"links":32,"instances":["electricity","color","bottle","shipboard","tool","color","pyrotechnic"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Survival equipment|","Disaster preparedness"],"headings":["General contents","Lifeboat survival kits","Military kits","Mini survival kits","Vehicle kits","Natural disasters","Bug-out bags","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/be/Moscow_Polytechnical_Museum%2C_cosmonaut%27s_survival_kit.jpg/220px-Moscow_Polytechnical_Museum%2C_cosmonaut%27s_survival_kit.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/US_Navy_070801-N-3136P-009_Aircrew_Survival_Equipmentman_Airmans_Jessica_Lockhart_%28left%29%2C_and_Rudy_Inzunza_inventory_a_C-2A_Greyhound%27s_life_raft_kit_in_USS_Kitty_Hawk_%28CV_63%29_paraloft_shop.jpg/220px-thumbnail.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/Signal_mirror_2x3_plastic_USMC.jpg/220px-Signal_mirror_2x3_plastic_USMC.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2b/Bow_Saw_%28PSF%29.jpg/220px-Bow_Saw_%28PSF%29.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/75/Portable_stove.jpg/220px-Portable_stove.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Fire_Making_Survival_Kit.jpg/220px-Fire_Making_Survival_Kit.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["lifeboat","shipboard"],["canteen","bottle"],["orange","color"],["chartreuse","color"],["lifeboat","shipboard"],["flare","pyrotechnic"],["battery","electricity"],["firearm","tool"]],"members":["battery","chartreuse","canteen","lifeboat","firearm","orange","flare"],"related":["Survival_skills","Military_aircraft","Lifeboat_(shipboard)","Spacecraft","Swiss_army_knife","Multi-tool","Tinder","First_aid_kit","Flashlight","Survival_store","Space_blanket","Poncho","Bivvy_bag","Tarpaulin","Trash_bag","Ferrocerium","Fire_striker","Fire_piston","Solar_Spark_Lighter","Lighter","Cotton_ball","Petroleum_jelly","Catalytic_heater","Canteen_(bottle)","First_aid_kits","Bandage","Adhesive_bandage","Gauze","Tweezers","Scalpel","Antibiotic","Epinephrine","Antihistamines","Rubbing_alcohol","Surgical_suture","Surgical_stapler","Oxytetracycline","Aspirin","Oral_rehydration_therapy","Sunscreen","Canned_food","Meal,_Ready-to-Eat","Gillnetting","Whistle","LED_light","Distress_signal","Laser_pointer","Orange_(color)","Chartreuse_(color)","Trail_maps","Nautical_chart","Survival_manual","Knife","Multitool","Swiss_Army_knife","Parachute_cord","Tarpaulin","Hatchet","Machete","Liquefied_petroleum_gas","Billycan","Japanese_saw","Backsaw","Solar_charger","Lifeboat_(shipboard)","Personal_flotation_device","Fire_extinguisher","First_aid_kit","Compass","EPIRB","Flare_(pyrotechnic)","Laser_pointer","Corner_reflector","Lantern","Transceiver","Ham_Radio","AM_broadcasting","FM_broadcasting","GPS_navigation_device","Rainwater","Desalination","Hatchet","Ladder","Sea_anchor","Bilge_pump","Bucket","Survival_radio","Sea_Water_Still","Mini_survival_kits","Altoids","Power_inverter","KA-BAR","Fire_extinguisher","Water_purification","Glove","First_aid_kit","Photo","Personal_identification","Insurance","Driver's_license","Flashlight","Battery_(electricity)","Goggles","Water","Gallon","National_Oceanic_and_Atmospheric_Administration","First_aid_kit","Food","Survivalism","Bothy_bag","Community_Emergency_Response_Team","Firearm_(tool)","Hiking_equipment","Mini_survival_kit","Survival_skills","Survivalism","Ten_essentials","American_Red_Cross","Federal_Emergency_Management_Agency"]}
