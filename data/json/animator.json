Animators can work in a variety of fields\nincluding film, television, video games, and the internet. Usually, an animation\npiece requires the collaboration of several animators. The methods of creating\nthe images or frames for an animation piece depends on the animators' artistic\nstyles and their field.\n\nOther artists who contribute to animated cartoons, but who are 'not' animators,\ninclude layout artists (who design the backgrounds, lighting, and camera\nangles), storyboard artists (who draw panels of the action from the script), and\nbackground artists (who paint the \"scenery\"). Moreover, voice actors and\nmusicians, among other talent, may be added as necessary to give the animation\nadditional depth.\n",
