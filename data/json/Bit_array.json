{"cursor":"17671","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nA 'bit array' (also known as 'bitmap', 'bitset', 'bit string', or 'bit vector')\nis an array data structure that compactly stores bits. It can be used to\nimplement a simple set data structure. A bit array is effective at exploiting\nbit-level parallelism in hardware to perform operations quickly. A typical bit\narray stores kw bits, where w is the number of bits in the unit of storage, such\nas a byte or word, and k is some nonnegative integer. If w does not divide the\nnumber of bits to be stored, some space is wasted due to internal fragmentation.\n","linknr":258,"url":"Bit_array","recorded":1362540260,"links":18,"instances":["verification_language","computing","programming_language","programming_language","parallel_computing","set_theory","electronics","computing","programming_language","computer_architecture","programming_language","set_theory","set_theory"],"pdf":["http://www.gotw.ca/publications/N1185.pdf","http://www.gotw.ca/publications/N1211.pdf"],"categories":["Arrays","Bit data structures"],"headings":["Definition","Basic operations","More complex operations","Compression","Advantages and disadvantages","Applications","Language support","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["word","computer_architecture"],["fragmentation","computing"],["word","computer_architecture"],["union","set_theory"],["intersection","set_theory"],["complement","set_theory"],["vectorization","parallel_computing"],["page","computing"],["c","programming_language"],["java","programming_language"],["haskell","programming_language"],["ruby","programming_language"],["flip-flop","electronics"],["e","verification_language"]],"members":["e","page","java","ruby","vectorization","complement","fragmentation","c","word","haskell","intersection","union"],"related":["Array_data_structure","Bit","Set_data_structure","Byte","Word_(computer_architecture)","Fragmentation_(computing)","Word_(computer_architecture)","Bitwise_operation","Bitwise_negation","Union_(set_theory)","Intersection_(set_theory)","Complement_(set_theory)","Locality_of_reference","Hamming_weight","Counting_sort","Find_first_one","Priority_queue","Find_first_set","Run-length_encoding","Vectorization_(parallel_computing)","Data_cache","Judy_array","Trie","Bloom_filter","Priority_queue","Linux_kernel","Page_(computing)","Inode","Raster_graphics","Color_depth","Bloom_filter","Set_data_structure","Hash_table","Succinct_data_structure","Data_compression","Huffman_coding","Information_retrieval","Posting_list","Unary_coding","Golomb_coding","C_(programming_language)","X11","C++","Standard_Template_Library","Partial_template_specialization","Proxy_pattern","Boost_C++_Libraries","D_programming_language","Java_(programming_language)","Enumerated_type",".NET_Framework","Standard_ML","Haskell_(programming_language)","Perl","Ruby_(programming_language)","Core_Foundation","PL/I","VHDL","Verilog","SystemVerilog","Flip-flop_(electronics)","OpenVera","E_(verification_language)","SystemVerilog","Bit_field","Bitboard","Bitmap_index","Binary_numeral_system","Bitstream"]}
