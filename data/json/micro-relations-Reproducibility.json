Reproducibility is part of the precision of a test\nmethod. ASTM E177\n\nReproducibility also refers to the ability of an entire experiment or study to\nbe reproduced, or by someone else working independently. It is one of the main\nprinciples of the scientific method. The result values are said to be\ncommensurate if they are obtained (in distinct experimental trials) according to\nthe same reproducible experimental description and procedure. The basic idea can\nbe seen in Aristotle's dictum that there is no scientific knowledge of the\nindividual, where the word used for individual in Greek had the connotation of\nthe idiosyncratic, or wholly isolated occurrence. Thus all knowledge, all\nscience, necessarily involves the formation of general concepts and the\ninvocation of their corresponding symbols in language (cf. Turner).\n","linknr":178,"url":"Reproducibility","recorded":1362480293,"links":26,"instances":["statistics","logic"],"pdf":["http://www.iupac.org/goldbook/R05305.pdf"],"categories":["Measurement","Philosophy of science","Psychometrics","Scientific method","Tests","Validity (statistics)"],"headings":["Reproducible data","Reproducible research","Noteworthy irreproducible results","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["replication","statistics"],["tautology","logic"]],"members":["replication","tautology"],"related":["Replication_(statistics)","Accuracy_and_precision","Test_method","Experiment","Scientific_method","Aristotle","Standard_deviation","Jon_Claerbout","David_Donoho","John_P._A._Ioannidis","Cloning","Protoscience","Hideyo_Noguchi","Syphilis","University_of_Utah","Cold_fusion","Electrolysis","Heavy_water","Palladium","Cathode","Deuterium","Science_by_press_conference","Nikola_Tesla","Wireless_energy_transfer","Wardenclyffe_Tower","Shoreham,_New_York","Accuracy","ANOVA_gauge_R&R","Contingency","Corroboration","Falsifiability","Hypothesis","Measurement_uncertainty","Pathological_science","Pseudoscience","Scientific_method","Tautology_(logic)","Testability","International_Union_of_Pure_and_Applied_Chemistry"]}
