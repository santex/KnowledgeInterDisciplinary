In the most frequently\nassociated instance of the term, a partnership is formed between one or more\nbusinesses in which partners (owners) co-labor to achieve and share profits and\nlosses (see business partners). Partnerships exist within, and across, sectors.\nNon-profit, religious, and political organizations may partner together to\nincrease the likelihood of each achieving their mission and to amplify their\nreach. In what is usually called an alliance, governments may partner to achieve\ntheir national interests, sometimes against allied governments who hold contrary\ninterests, such as occurred during World War II and the Cold War. In education,\naccrediting agencies increasingly evaluate schools by the level and quality of\ntheir partnerships with other schools and a variety of other entities across\nsocietal sectors. Partnerships also occur at personal levels, such as when two\nor more individuals agree to domicile together, while other partnerships are not\nonly personal but private, known only to the involved parties.\n\nPartnerships present the involved parties with special challenges that must be\nnavigated unto agreement. Overarching goals, levels of give-and-take, areas of\nresponsibility, lines of authority and succession, how success is evaluated and\ndistributed, and often a variety of other factors must all be negotiated. Once\nagreement is reached, the partnership is typically enforceable by civil law,\nespecially if well documented. Partners who wish to make their agreement\naffirmatively explicit and enforceable typically draw up Articles of\nPartnership. It is common for information about formally partnered entities to\nbe made public, such as through a press release, a newspaper ad, or public\nrecords laws.\n\nWhile partnerships stand to amplify mutual interests and success, some are\nconsidered ethically problematic. When a politician, for example, partners with\na corporation to advance the corporation's interest in exchange for some\nbenefit, a conflict of interest results. Outcomes for the public good may\nsuffer. While technically legal in some jurisdictions, such practice is broadly\nviewed negatively or as corruption.\n\nGovernmentally recognized partnerships may enjoy special benefits in tax\npolicies. Among developed countries, for example, business partnerships are\noften favored over corporations in taxation policy, since dividend taxes only\noccur on profits before they are distributed to the partners. However, depending\non the partnership structure and the jurisdiction in which it operates, owners\nof a partnership may be exposed to greater personal liability than they would as\nshareholders of a corporation. In such countries, partnerships are often\nregulated via anti-trust laws, so as to inhibit monopolistic practices and\nfoster free market competition. Enforcement of the laws, however, is often\nwidely variable. Domestic partnerships recognized by governments typically enjoy\ntax benefits, as well.\n","linknr":385,"url":"Partnership","recorded":1362585324,"links":32,"instances":["usa","common_law"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Partnerships|","Business law","Types of business entity"],"headings":["Definition in civil law","Common law","Islamic Law","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["civil_law","common_law"],["partnership_taxation","usa"]],"members":["partnership_taxation","civil_law"],"related":["Social_animal","Business_entity","Interest","Organization","School","Government","Business_partners","Non-profit_organization","Faith-based_organization","Political_organization","Alliance","World_War_II","Cold_War","Education","Educational_accreditation","Domestic_partnership","Succession_planning","Civil_law_(common_law)","Articles_of_Partnership","Conflict_of_interest","Public_good","Corruption","Tax_policy","Corporation","Dividend_tax","Jurisdiction","Personal_liability","Shareholder","Anti-trust","Monopoly","Market_economy","Contract","Partnership_agreement","Jurisdiction","Contract","Entity","General_Partnership","Limited_Partnership","Limited_liability_partnership","Tokumei_kumiai","Corporation","Mochibun_kaisha","Common_law","General_partnership","Limited_partnership","Limited_liability","Limited_liability_partnership","Strict_liability","Joint_liability","Joint_and_several_liability","Constitution_Act,_1867","General_partnership","Limited_partnership","Limited_liability_partnership","National_Conference_of_Commissioners_on_Uniform_State_Laws","Uniform_Partnership_Act","Uniform_Limited_Partnership_Act","Partnership_taxation_(USA)","Internal_Revenue_Code","Sharia","Islamic_economic_jurisprudence","Limited_partnership","Islamic_Golden_Age","Islamic_economics_in_the_world","Trading_company","Big_business","Contract","Bills_of_exchange","International_trade","Brill_Publishers","Consortium","Business_partnering","Corporation","Equity_partner","General_partnership","Joint_venture","Keiretsu","Limited_liability_partnership","Limited_partnership","Partnership_accounting","Partnership_taxation","Strategic_Alliance","Types_of_business_entity","Business_Concept"]}
