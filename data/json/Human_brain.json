Large animals such as\nwhales and elephants have larger brains in absolute terms, but when measured\nusing the encephalization quotient which compensates for body size, the human\nbrain is almost twice as large as the brain of the bottlenose dolphin, and three\ntimes as large as the brain of a chimpanzee. Much of the expansion comes from\nthe part of the brain called the cerebral cortex, especially the frontal lobes,\nwhich are associated with executive functions such as self-control, planning,\nreasoning, and abstract thought. The portion of the cerebral cortex devoted to\nvision is also greatly enlarged in humans.\n\nThe human cerebral cortex is a thick layer of neural tissue that covers most of\nthe brain. This layer is folded in a way that increases the amount of surface\nthat can fit into the volume available. The pattern of folds is similar across\nindividuals, although there are many small variations. The cortex is divided\ninto four \"lobes\", called the frontal lobe, parietal lobe, temporal lobe, and\noccipital lobe. (Some classification systems also include a limbic lobe and\ntreat the insular cortex as a lobe.) Within each lobe are numerous cortical\nareas, each associated with a particular function such as vision, motor control,\nlanguage, etc. The left and right sides of the cortex are broadly similar in\nshape, and most cortical areas are replicated on both sides. Some areas, though,\nshow strong lateralization, particularly areas that are involved in language. In\nmost people, the left hemisphere is \"dominant\" for language, with the right\nhemisphere playing only a minor role. There are other functions, such as\nspatiotemporal reasoning, for which the right hemisphere is usually dominant.\n\nDespite being protected by the thick bones of the skull, suspended in\ncerebrospinal fluid, and isolated from the bloodstream by the bloodâbrain\nbarrier, the human brain is susceptible to many types of damage and disease. The\nmost common forms of physical damage are closed head injuries such as a blow to\nthe head, a stroke, or poisoning by a variety of chemicals that can act as\nneurotoxins. Infection of the brain, though serious, is rare due to the\nbiological barriers which protect it. The human brain is also susceptible to\ndegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and\nAlzheimer's disease. A number of psychiatric conditions, such as schizophrenia\nand depression, are thought to be associated with brain dysfunctions, although\nthe nature of such brain anomalies is not well understood.\n\nScientifically, the techniques that are used to study the human brain differ in\nimportant ways from those that are used to study other animal species. On the\none hand, invasive techniques such as inserting electrodes into the brain, or\ndisabling parts of the brain in order to examine the effect on behavior, can be\nused with non-human species, but for ethical reasons, are generally not\nperformed with humans. On the other hand, humans are the only subjects who can\nrespond to complex verbal instructions. Thus, it is often possible to use non-\ninvasive techniques such as functional neuroimaging or EEG recording more\nproductively with humans than with non-humans. Furthermore, some of the most\nimportant topics, such as language, can hardly be studied at all except in\nhumans. In many cases, human and non-human studies form essential complements to\neach other. Individual brain cells can only be studied in non-humans; complex\ncognitive tasks can only be studied in humans. Combining the two sources of\ninformation to yield a complete functional understanding of the human brain is\nan ongoing challenge for neuroscience.\n","linknr":1808,"url":"Human_brain","recorded":1362373701,"links":76,"instances":["neuroanatomy","anatomy","linguistics","philosophy_of_mind","disease","neuroanatomy","brain","anatomy"],"pdf":["http://www.medbio.info/Horn/PDF%20files/integration_of_metabolism%20v4.pdf"],"categories":["Brain"],"headings":["Structure","Cognition","Lateralization","Development","Evolution","Sources
