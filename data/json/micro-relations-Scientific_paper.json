{"cursor":"34360","size":15,"audio":[],"cat":[],"tmpl":[],"currentlang":"en","linknr":301,"url":"Scientific_paper","article":"\n\n\n'Academic publishing' describes the subfield of publishing which distributes\nacademic research and scholarship. Most academic work is published in journal\narticle, book or thesis form. The part of academic written output that is not\nformally published but merely printed up or posted on the Internet is often\ncalled the \"grey literature\". Most scientific and scholarly journals, and many\nacademic and scholarly books, though not all, are based on some form of peer\nreview or editorial refereeing to qualify texts for publication. Peer review\nquality and selectivity standards vary greatly from journal to journal,\npublisher to publisher, and field to field.\n\nMost established academic disciplines have their own journals and other outlets\nfor publication, although many academic journals are somewhat interdisciplinary,\nand publish work from several distinct fields or subfields. There is also a\ntendency for existing journals to divide into specialized sections as the field\nitself becomes more specialized. Along with the variation in review and\npublication procedures, the kinds of publications that are accepted as\ncontributions to knowledge or research differ greatly among fields and\nsubfields.\n\nAcademic publishing is undergoing major changes, as it makes the transition from\nthe print to the electronic format. Business models are different in the\nelectronic environment. Since the early 1990s, licensing of electronic\nresources, particularly journals, has been very common. Currently, an important\ntrend, particularly with respect to scholarly journals, is open access via the\nInternet. There are two main forms of open access: open access publishing, in\nwhich a whole journal (or book) or individual articles are made available free\nfor all on the web by the publisher at the time of publication (sometimes, but\nnot always, for an extra publication fee paid by the author or the author's\ninstitution or funder); and open access self-archiving, in which authors\nthemselves make a copy of their published articles available free for all on the\nweb.\n","recorded":1362124353,"portal":[],"list":[],"links":"302","instances":["academic_document","author","books","academic_publishing","summary","economics","publishing"],"pdf":["http://www.stratongina.net/files/50millionArifJinhaFinal.pdf","http://www.stratongina.net/files/50millionArifJinhaFinal.pdf","http://www.arl.org/bm~doc/arlstat05.pdf","http://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/ideas/pdf/armstrong2/peerpaper.pdf","http://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/ideas/pdf/armstrong2/peerpaper.pdf","http://www.elearning.au.edu/phdelm/wordpress/wp-content/themes/phdelm/research-concept-paper-guideline.pdf","http://www.science-metrix.com/30years-Paper.pdf","http://www.berr.gov.uk/files/file27330.pdf","http://www.berr.gov.uk/files/file27330.pdf","http://www.dti.gov.uk/files/file27330.pdf","http://www.dti.gov.uk/files/file27330.pdf"],"categories":["Academic
