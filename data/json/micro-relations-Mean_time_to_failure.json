Jones, James V., Integrated\nLogistics Support Handbook, page 4.2 MTBF can be calculated as the\narithmetic mean (average) time between failures of a system. The MTBF is\ntypically part of a model that assumes the failed system is immediately repaired\n(mean time to repair, or MTTR), as a part of a renewal process. This is in\ncontrast to the mean time to failure (MTTF), which measures average time to\nfailures with the modeling assumption that the failed system is not repaired\n(infinite repair rate).\n\nThe definition of MTBF depends on the definition of what is considered a system\nfailure. For complex, repairable systems, failures are considered to be those\nout of design conditions which place the system out of service and into a state\nfor repair. Failures which occur that can be left or maintained in an\nunrepaired condition, and do not place the system out of service, are not\nconsidered failures under this definition.
