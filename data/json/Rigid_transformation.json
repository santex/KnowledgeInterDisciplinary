{"cursor":"7489","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In mathematics, a 'rigid transformation' (isometry) of a vector space preserves\ndistances between every pair of points.\n\n \n\n Rigid transformations of the plane R 2, space R 3, or\nreal n-dimensional space R n are termed a 'Euclidean transformation'\nbecause they form the basis of Euclidean geometry. .\n\nThe Rigid transformations include rotations, translations, reflections, or their\ncombination. Sometimes reflections are excluded from the definition of a rigid\ntransformation by imposing that the transformation also preserve the handedness\nof figures in the Euclidean space (a reflection would not preserve handedness;\nfor instance, it would transform a left hand into a right hand). To avoid\nambiguity, this smaller class of transformations is known as 'proper rigid\ntransformations' (informally, also known as 'roto-translations'). In general,\nany proper rigid transformation can be decomposed as a rotation followed by a\ntranslation, while any rigid transformation can be decomposed as an improper\nrotation followed by a translation (or as a sequence of reflections).\n\nAny object will keep the same shape and size after a proper rigid\ntransformation, but not after an improper one.\n\nAll rigid transformations are affine transformations. Rigid transformations\nwhich involve a translation are not linear transformations. Not all\ntransformations are rigid transformations. An example is a shear, which changes\ntwo axes in different ways, or a similarity transformation, which preserves\nangles but not lengths. The set of all (proper and improper) rigid\ntransformations is a group called the Euclidean group, denoted E(n) for n-\ndimensional Euclidean spaces). The set of proper rigid transformation is called\nspecial Euclidean group, denoted SE(n).\n\nIn mechanics, proper rigid transformations in a 3-dimensional Euclidean space,\ndenoted SE(3), are used to represent the linear and angular displacement of\nrigid bodies.\n","linknr":122,"url":"Rigid_transformation","recorded":1362892911,"links":10,"instances":["mathematics","mathematics","mathematics","mathematics","geometry","vector","mathematics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Functions and mappings"],"headings":["Distance formula","Translations and Linear Transformations","Formal definition","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/math/9/d/b/9db98b213f3a89d21e8794c7a04090ca.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/1/a/0/1a0e3e017e8a6725dcff5c72d5ac841b.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/a/b/9/ab91e9c2798c691dcdbfdcb05ff81ff4.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/b/d/fbd710717640af2716da382c9133f942.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/4/0/440ec0ba370a7a60c5bc81fc73f7ae04.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/3/3/e33ba37d4d0f5b66201c2c7eaf89be51.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/1/9/f19131257d7a5b72e1d8b73a531f3952.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/3/3/b/33b65cc4afe8ce691729685dab5c3dd2.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/2/9/d/29d91f5e64595c4cb8af055773a1e237.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["rotation","mathematics"],["translation","mathematics"],["reflection","mathematics"],["orientation","mathematics"],["shear","mathematics"],["group","mathematics"],["displacement","vector"],["translation","geometry"],["group","mathematics"],["rotation","mathematics"]],"members":["rotation","group","shear","orientation","translation","displacement","reflection"],"related":["Isometry","Rotation_(mathematics)","Translation_(mathematics)","Reflection_(mathematics)","Orientation_(mathematics)","Shape","Affine_transformations","Linear_transformation","Shear_(mathematics)","Similarity_transformation","Group_(mathematics)","Euclidean_group","Mechanics","Displacement_(vector)","Angular_displacement","Rigid_body","Metric_space","Scalar_product","Translation_(geometry)","Group_(mathematics)","Orthogonal_matrix","Lie_group","Orthogonal_transformation","Determinant","Rotation_(mathematics)"]}
