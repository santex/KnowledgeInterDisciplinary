The song, though seemingly\nupbeat, contains dark lyrics. Corgan wrote the song about a day in which he was\nhaving suicidal thoughts, exemplified by the reference to self-mutilation in the\nchorus. However, the contrast between the grim subject matter of the song and\nthe soft instrumental part during the verses, coupled with use of irony in the\nlyrics, left many listeners unaware of the song's tale of depression and\ndesperation. The song alternates between quiet, dreamy verses and loud choruses\nwith layered, distorted guitar.\n\n\"Today\" was released in September 1993 as the second single from the band's\nsecond album and major label debut, [[Siamese Dream]]. Although Corgan opted for\nthe lead single from the album to be the opening track, \"Cherub Rock\", \"Today\"\nand its follow-up \"Disarm\" are credited in Allmusic for popularizing the band\nand \"sen[ding] [Siamese Dream] into the stratosphere.\" \"Today\" has\nbeen generally well received by critics, and in an article about the song in\n[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]] it was described as having \"achieved a remarkable\nstatus as one of the defining songs of its generation, perfectly mirroring the\nfractured alienation of American youth in the 1990s.\"\n","linknr":548,"url":"Today_(The_Smashing_Pumpkins_song)","recorded":1362584451,"links":26,"instances":["music","guitar","band","music","band","music"],"pdf":[],"categories":["The Smashing Pumpkins songs","1993 singles","Music videos directed by Stéphane Sednaoui","Songs about suicide","Songs written by Billy Corgan","Virgin Records singles","Songs produced by Billy Corgan","Songs produced by Butch Vig"],"headings":["Background and recording","Composition and lyrics","Music video","Reception","Other releases","Sales chart positions","Track listings","Personnel","Accolades","Footnotes","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e0/SmashingPumpkins-Today.jpg/220px-SmashingPumpkins-Today.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/62/TodayIntro.JPG/300px-TodayIntro.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/87/Gnome-mime-sound-openclipart.svg/50px-Gnome-mime-sound-openclipart.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8c/Todaypromo.jpg/220px-Todaypromo.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e7/Cscr-featured.svg/15px-Cscr-featured.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["distortion","guitar"],["nirvana","band"],["demo","music"],["dynamics","music"],["song_structure","popular_music#verse"],["my_bloody_valentine","band"],["sampling","music"]],"members":["demo","distortion","song_structure","nirvana","sampling","my_bloody_valentine","dynamics"],"related":["The_Smashing_Pumpkins","Siamese_Dream","Gramophone_record","12-inch_single","Cassette_single","Compact_Disc_single","Alternative_rock","Virgin_Records","Billy_Corgan","Butch_Vig","Cherub_Rock","Disarm","Alternative_rock","The_Smashing_Pumpkins","Billy_Corgan","Suicide","Self-mutilation","Irony","Clinical_depression","Distortion_(guitar)","Major_label","Opening_track","Cherub_Rock","Disarm","Allmusic","Nirvana_(band)","Jimmy_Chamberlin","Drug_addiction","Heroin","James_Iha","D'arcy_Wretzky","Billy_Corgan","Clinical_depression","Writer's_block","Atlanta","Demo_(music)","Butch_Vig","Chord_progression","Riff","Virgin_Records","Cherub_Rock","Musical_key","E-flat_major","Standard_tuning","Semitone","Dynamics_(music)","Refrain","Pentatonic","The_Cure","My_Bloody_Valentine_(band)","Barre_chords","Roland_RE-201","Irony","Rock_ballad","Disarm","James_Iha","Music_video","Stéphane_Sednaoui","MTV","Comic_book","Ice_cream_van","Cowboy","Ned_Raggett","Allmusic","Robert_Christgau","Modern_Rock_Tracks","Mainstream_Rock_Tracks","BBC","Box_set","Chicago,_Illinois","Bootleg_recording","Acoustic_music","Time_capsule","MTV","Cover_version","Tribute_album","Dance_music","Industrial_music","Soul_music","Solomon_Burke","Motown_Sound","Armor_for_Sleep","Sampling_(music)","Hip_hop_music","Dragon_Ash","Grateful_Days","Modern_Rock_Tracks","Mainstream_Rock_Tracks","UK_Singles_Chart","Canadian_Singles_Chart","Jimmy_Chamberlin","Drum_kit","Billy_Corgan","Guitar","Singing","Record_producer","James_Iha","Guitar","Butch_Vig","D'arcy_Wretzky","Bass_guitar"]}
