The producer is Allan Johnston who worked as a teacher of children\nwith special needs before joining the BBC in 1989. It is designed to introduce\nchildren to Makaton signing, and is specifically aimed at children with delayed\nlearning and communication difficulties. It is aired on the CBeebies channel and\nin the past was also broadcast as part of the CBeebies programme strand on BBC\nOne and BBC Two).\n\nThe name of the programme derives from the idea that all children, irrespective\nof their position on the learning spectrum, are special.\n\nIt is presented by Justin Fletcher and features various other characters (also\nplayed by Justin) and clips of disabled children. Justin speaks as well as\nsigning, and a spoken narrative is provided over the clips of children.\n\nThe characters played by Justin (other than himself) are the Tumble Family: Mr\nTumble, an adult who himself displays delayed learning and communication\ndifficulties, Grandad Tumble and Baby Tumble. Other members of the Tumble family\nto have made appearances include two Aunts - Polly and Suki (as in the popular\nnursery rhyme \"Polly Put the Kettle On\"), Lord Tumble and King Tumble.\n\nThere format of the show has evolved considerably since the original series. In\n2012, a new series, \"Something Special - We're All Friends\" started, introducing\nsome minor changes to the \"Out and About\" format. This format change has also\nincluded a change in location, and introduced the Tumble Tapp, a tablet computer\nshowing the \"special things\" to look for.\n","linknr":247,"url":"Mr_Tumble","recorded":1364121355,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Something_Special_(TV_series)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Something_Special_(TV_series)&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","/wiki/Something_Special_(TV_series)","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","/w/index.php?title=Mr_Tumble&redirect=no","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/File:Somethingspecial1.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/dd/Somethingspecial1.JPG","/wiki/Children%27s_television_series","/wiki/Justin_Fletcher","/wiki/CBeebies","http://www.bbc.co.uk/cbeebies/somethingspecial/","/wiki/BBC","/wiki/Makaton","/wiki/CBeebies","/wiki/BBC_One","/wiki/BBC_Two","/wiki/Justin_Fletcher","/wiki/Polly_Put_the_Kettle_On","#Series_1_.282005.29_and_2_.282006.29","#Series_1_episode_list","#Series_2_episode_list","#Series_3_.22Out_and_About.22_.282008.29","#Series_3_episode_list","#Mr_Tumble_shorts_.282009.29","#Series_5.2C_6_and_7_Out_and_About_.282010-2012.29","#Series_5_episode_list.5B5.5D","#Series_6_episode_list","#Series_7_episode_list","#Series_8_.28Something_Special_-_We.27re_all_friends.29_.282012-2013.29","#Series_8_.28Something_Special_-_We.27re_all_friends.29_episode_list.5B7.5D","#Allegations_of_indecent_sign-language","#Awards","#Video_and_DVD_Releases","#Video","#DVD","#External_links","#References","/w/index.php?title=Something_Special_(TV_series)&action=edit&section=1","#cite_note-1","/w/index.php?title=Something_Special_(TV_series)&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Mandeville_Upper_School","/w/index.php?title=Oakleigh_School&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Sensory_garden","/w/index.php?title=Something_Special_(TV_series)&action=edit&section=3","/w/index.php?title=Something_Special_(TV_series)&action=edit&section=4","/wiki/Cliff_Richard","/wiki/Guy_Fletcher_(songwriter)","/w/index.php?title=Something_Special_(TV_series)&action=edit&section=5","/wiki/Mount_Snowdon","/wiki/Wokingham","/wiki/Dorset","/wiki/Hydrotherapy","/wiki/Corfe_Castle,_Dorset","/wiki/Swanage_Railway","/wiki/Dorset","/wiki/Craven_Cottage","/wiki/Fulham_F.C.","/wiki/Craven_Cottage","/wiki/New_Forest","/wiki/Carrickfergus_Castle","/wiki/Dundonald","/wiki/Belfast","/wiki/Weymouth_Harbour,_Dorset","/wiki/Enniskillen","/w/index.php?title=Something_Special_(TV_series)&action=edit&section=6","/w/index.php?title=Something_Special_(TV_series)&action=edit&section=7","#cite_note-bbc-pr-8mar2010-2","/wiki/Porlock","/wiki/Somerset","#cite_note-3","#cite_note-4","/w/index.php?title=Something_Special_(TV_series)&action=edit&section=8","#cite_note-5","/wiki/Bembridge_Airport","/wiki/Isle_of_Wight","/wiki/Manchester","/wiki/Double-decker_bus","/wiki/Garden_centre","/wiki/Isle_of_Wight","/wiki/Chairlift","/wiki/Alum_Bay","/wiki/The_Needles","/wiki/Funfair#Sidestalls_and_games","/wiki/Sheffield_Children%27s_Hospital","/wiki/Houseboat","/wiki/Norfolk_Broads","/wiki/Horning","/wiki/Leisure_centre","//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/float","/wiki/Bouncy_castle","/wiki/Sports_day","/wiki/Egg_and_spoon_race","/wiki/Trophy","/wiki/Egg_cup","/wiki/Amazon_World_Zoo","/wiki/Musical_statues","/wiki/Musical_bumps","/wiki/Hide-and-seek","/wiki/Animal_sanctuary","/wiki/Berkshire","/wiki/Bushey_Heath","/wiki/Asda","/wiki/Shopping_cart","/wiki/Frogmore,_Devon","/wiki/Butterfly_World,_Isle_of_Wight","/wiki/Caf%C3%A9","/wiki/Video_camera","/w/index.php?title=Something_Special_(TV_series)&action=edit&section=9","/w/index.php?title=Something_Special_(TV_series)&action=edit&section=10","/w/index.php?title=Something_Special_(TV_series)&action=edit&section=11","#cite_note-6","/w/index.php?title=Something_Special_(TV_series)&action=edit&section=12","#cite_note-7","/wiki/Sandcastle_Water_Park_(Blackpool)","/w/index.php?title=Something_Special_(TV_series)&action=edit&section=13","/wiki/Royal_National_Institute_for_the_Deaf","/wiki/Fuck","/wiki/British_Sign_Language","/wiki/Makaton","#cite_note-8","/wiki/Countdown_with_Keith_Olberman","/wiki/MSNBC","#cite_note-9","/w/index.php?title=Something_Special_(TV_series)&action=edit&section=14","/wiki/Royal_Television_Society","#cite_note-rts-2004-10","/wiki/BAFTA_Children%27s_Awards","#cite_note-bafta-2005-11","/wiki/BAFTA_Children%27s_Awards","#cite_note-bafta-2007-12","/wiki/BAFTA_Children%27s_Awards","#cite_note-bafta-2008-13","
