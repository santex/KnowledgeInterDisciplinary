During the plague of hail (Exodus ), the barley was said to be aviv\n  and the flax giv`ol.\n* The month in the Hebrew calendar when the barley has reached or passed this\n  stage ( ) is called Aviv, or the \"month of the aviv\": the seventh of the\n  Jewish civil year, and the first of the Biblical ecclesiastical year. It\n  begins about the time of the Northern spring equinox (March 21). Since the\n  Babylonian captivity, this month has mainly been called Nisan ( ). On the\n  sixteenth day of the month, harvest was begun by gathering a sheaf of\n  barley, which was offered as a sacrifice to God (), when the Temple in\n  Jerusalem existed.\n* \"Aviv\" accordingly also means spring, one of the four seasons. Thus the major\n  modern Israeli city of Tel Aviv means \"Spring Hill\".<ref></ref>\n\n* Since Passover is always celebrated on 15â€“21 (or 22 outside Israel) Nisan,\n  near the beginning of spring, \"Holiday of Aviv\" (Pesach or Passover Is always\n  on the 14th of Nisan. The 1st day of Chag ha Matzoh or The Feast of Unleavened\n  Bread is always the dayafter that, the 15th of Nisan. See: Leviticus 23:5,6) (\n  ) is an additional name for Passover.\n* Aviv is also a Hebrew male given name (the female equivalent is Aviva) that\n  may refer to: ** Aviv Geffen, an Israeli rock musician, singer, songwriter **\n  Aviv Maayan, an Israeli-Welsh professional wrestler\n","title":"aviv","headings":["References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["2: Barley","2: Passover","1: Hebrew_language","1: Cereal","1: Book_of_Exodus","1: Flax","1: Hebrew_calendar","1: Northern_spring_equinox","1: Babylonian_captivity","1: Nisan","1: Names_of_God_in_Judaism","1: Temple_in_Jerusalem","1: Seasons","1: Israel","1: Tel_Aviv","1: Aviv_Geffen","1: Aviv_Maayan"]}
