The term Tao means \"way\", \"path\" or\n\"principle\", and can also be found in Chinese philosophies and religions other\nthan Taoism. In Taoism, however, Tao denotes something that is both the source\nand the driving force behind everything that exists. It is ultimately ineffable:\n\"The Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao.\"\n\nThe keystone work of literature in Taoism is the [[Tao Te Ching]], a concise and\nambiguous book containing teachings attributed to Laozi (). Together with the\nwritings of Zhuangzi, these texts build the philosophical foundation of Taoism.\nThis philosophical Taoism, individualistic by nature, is not institutionalized.\nInstitutionalized forms, however, evolved over time in the shape of a number of\ndifferent schools, often integrating beliefs and practices that even pre-dated\nthe keystone texts â as, for example, the theories of the School of Naturalists,\nwhich synthesized the concepts of yin-yang and the Five Elements. Taoist schools\ntraditionally feature reverence for Laozi, immortals or ancestors, along with a\nvariety of divination and exorcism rituals, and practices for achieving ecstasy,\nlongevity or immortality.\n\nTaoist propriety and ethics may vary depending on the particular school, but\nin general tends to emphasize wu-wei (action through non-action),\n\"naturalness\", simplicity, spontaneity, and the Three Treasures: compassion,\nmoderation, and humility.\n\nTaoism has had profound influence on Chinese culture in the course of the\ncenturies, and clerics of institutionalised Taoism () usually take care to note\ndistinction between their ritual tradition and the customs and practices found\nin Chinese folk religion as these distinctions sometimes appear blurred. Chinese\nalchemy (especially neidan), Chinese astrology, Zen Buddhism, several martial\narts, Traditional Chinese medicine, feng shui, and many styles of qigong have\nbeen intertwined with Taoism throughout history. Beyond China, Taoism also had\ninfluence on surrounding societies in Asia.\n\nAfter Laozi and Zhuangzi the literature of Taoism grew steadily and used to be\ncompiled in form of a canon â the Daozang, which was at times published at the\nbehest of the emperor. Throughout Chinese history, Taoism was several times\nnominated as state religion. After the 17th century, however, it fell much from\nfavor. Like all other religious activity, Taoism was suppressed in the first\ndecades of the People's Republic of China (and even persecuted during the\nCultural Revolution), but continued to be practised in Taiwan. Today, it is one\nof five religions recognized in the PRC, and although it does not travel readily\nfrom its Asian roots, claims adherents in a number of societies.
