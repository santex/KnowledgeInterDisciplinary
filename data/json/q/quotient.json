The quotient further is expressed as the number of times the divisor\ndivides into the dividend, e.g. 3 divides 2 times into 6. A quotient can also\nmean just the integer part of the result of dividing two integers. For example,\nthe quotient of 13 and 5 would be 2 while the remainder would be 3. For more,\nsee the Euclidean division.\n\nIn more abstract branches of mathematics, the word quotient is often used to\ndescribe sets, spaces, or algebraic structures whose elements are the\nequivalence classes of some equivalence relation on another set, space, or\nalgebraic structure.
