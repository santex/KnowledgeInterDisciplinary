The values\nQ, P and R are often taken to be real numbers or complex numbers, but in fact,\na quadric may be defined over any ring. In general, the locus of zeros of a\nset of polynomials is known as an algebraic variety, and is studied in the\nbranch of algebraic geometry.\n\nA quadric is thus an example of an algebraic variety. For the projective theory\nsee quadric (projective geometry).\n",
