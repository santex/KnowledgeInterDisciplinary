{"cursor":"32183","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"''' ]] 'Vitamin B 6' is a water-soluble vitamin and is part of the\nvitamin B complex group. Several forms of the vitamin are known, but pyridoxal\nphosphate (PLP) is the active form and is a cofactor in many reactions of amino\nacid metabolism, including transamination, deamination, and decarboxylation. PLP\nalso is necessary for the enzymatic reaction governing the release of glucose\nfrom glycogen.\n","linknr":547,"url":"Vitamin_B6","recorded":1362575231,"links":54,"instances":["biochemistry","fruit"],"pdf":["http://www.jbc.org/content/161/1/311.full.pdf","http://www.jbc.org/content/161/1/311.full.pdf","http://www.racgp.org.au/Content/NavigationMenu/Publications/AustralianFamilyPhys/2007issues/afp200710/200710angley.pdf","http://www.racgp.org.au/Content/NavigationMenu/Publications/AustralianFamilyPhys/2007issues/afp200710/200710angley.pdf"],"categories":["B vitamins","Cofactors"],"headings":["History","Forms","Functions","Metabolic functions","Dietary reference intakes","Food sources","Absorption and excretion","Deficiencies","Toxicity","Oncology","Preventive roles and therapeutic uses","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/Pyridoxal-phosphate.svg/220px-Pyridoxal-phosphate.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/Pyridoxine_structure_ver2.svg/220px-Pyridoxine_structure_ver2.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cofactor","biochemistry"],["nut","fruit"]],"members":["cofactor","nut"],"related":["Vitamin","Vitamin_B","Pyridoxal_phosphate","Cofactor_(biochemistry)","Amino_acid","Glucose","Glycogen","Pyridine","Pyridoxal_phosphate","Pyridoxine","Pyridoxal","Pyridoxal_phosphate","Pyridoxamine","Catabolism","Macronutrient","Neurotransmitter","Histamine","Hemoglobin","Gene_expression","Methionine","Cysteine","Selenomethionine","Selenohomocysteine","Hydrogen_selenide","Tryptophan","Niacin","Histidine","Histamine","Tryptophan","Serotonin","Glutamate","Gamma-aminobutyric_acid","L-DOPA","Dopamine","Gluconeogenesis","Sphingolipids","Ceramide","Neurotransmitters","Serotonin","Dopamine","Epinephrine","Norepinephrine","Gamma-aminobutyric_acid","Histamine","ALA_synthase","Meat","Vegetable","Nut_(fruit)","Banana","Dried_milk","Cereal_germ","Aleurone","Jejunum","Ileum","Pyridoxal_phosphate","Pyridoxamine_phosphate","Alkaline_phosphatase","Pyridoxine_deficiency","Seborrhoeic_dermatitis","Atrophic_glossitis","Mouth_ulcer","Angular_cheilitis","Conjunctivitis","Intertrigo","Somnolence","Neuropathy","Coenzyme","Pyridoxal_phosphate","Tryptophan","Niacin","Xanthurenic_acid","Transsulfuration","Methionine","Cysteine","Transaminase","Glycogen_phosphorylase","Gluconeogenesis","Type_1_diabetes","Corticosteroid","Pyridoxine","Dorsal_root_ganglia","Neuropathy","Hyperoxaluria","Morning_sickness","Dream","Tryptophan","Serotonin","Lucid_dreaming","Parkinson's_disease","Homocysteine","Magnesium","Alternative_medicine","Autism","Randomised_control_trial","Attention_deficit_disorder","Carpal_tunnel_syndrome","PMS","PMDD","Clinical_depression","WebMD","Creighton_University","Hangover","Morning_sickness","Diuretic","Pyridoxal_phosphate","Colon_cancer","National_Institutes_of_Health","University_of_Parma"]}
