In a career which\nlasted from January 1960 through November 1963 he ran sixty-one times and won\ntwenty-one races. As a two-year-old he ran twenty-one times, emerging as one of\nthe best juveniles in America with a series of important victories late in the\nseason including the Garden State Futurity. At three he was the best of his\ngeneration in the United States, winning several major stakes races including\nthe Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes and being unanimously voted U.S.\nChampion Three-Year-Old Colt\n\nRacing as a four-year-old, his early form was disappointing but he returned to\nhis best with wins in the Metropolitan Handicap, Monmouth Handicap and the\nWhitney Stakes to establish himself as one of the leaders of an exceptionally\nstrong handicap division headed by Kelso. In October he became one of the few\nAmerican champions to race in Europe when he contested the Prix de l'Arc de\nTriomphe. In the same year he became the fourth horse, after Citation, Nashua\nand Round Table to earn $1M in prize money.\n\nAfter spending several months at stud he returned to racing in 1963, when the\nhighlight of his season was a win in the Trenton Handicap. He then returned to\nstud where he had limited success as a sire of winners. Trained by the outspoken\nand unconventional Jack Price, Carry Back's modest beginnings and exciting, come-from-\nbehind racing style made him one of the most popular racehorses of his era.\n","linknr":779,"url":"Carry_Back","recorded":1362666955,"links":14,"instances":["horse","horse","horse","horse","horse","mass","horse","horse","jockey","horse","horse","horse","horse","horse","horse","horse","horse","horse","horse","united_states","horse","horse","horse"],"pdf":[],"categories":["1958
