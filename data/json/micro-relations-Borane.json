The\nboranes comprise a large group of compounds with the generic formula of\nB xH y. These compounds do not occur in nature. Many of the\nboranes readily oxidise on contact with air, some violently. The parent member\nBH 3 is called borane, but it is known only in the gaseous state, and\ndimerises to form diborane, B 2H 6. The larger boranes all\nconsist of boron clusters that are polyhedral, some of which exist as isomers.\nFor example, isomers of B 20 H26 are based on the fusion of\ntwo 10-atom clusters.\n\nThe most important boranes are diborane B 2H 6, pentaborane\nB 5H 9, and decaborane B 10 H14 .\n\nThe development of the chemistry of boron hydrides led to new experimental\ntechniques and theoretical concepts. Boron hydrides have been studied as\npotential fuels, for rockets and for automotive uses.\n\nOver the past several decades, the scope of boron hydride chemistry has grown to\ninclude cages containing atoms other than boron, such as carbon in the\ncarboranes and metals in the metallaboranes, wherein one or more boron atoms are\nsubstituted by metal atoms.\n","linknr":233,"url":"Borane","recorded":1362512668,"links":41,"instances":["chemistry"],"pdf":["http://www.foia.cia.gov/docs/DOC_0001465813/DOC_0001465813.pdf","http://www.foia.cia.gov/docs/DOC_0001465813/DOC_0001465813.pdf","http://incolor.inebraska.com/hwolfe/history/sr71.pdf"],"categories":["Boranes"],"headings":["Generic formula of boranes","Naming conventions","Cluster types","Bonding in boranes","Chemistry of boranes","History","General references","Footnotes"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/58/Borane-3D-balls.png/200px-Borane-3D-balls.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d9/Diborane-3D-balls-A.png/200px-Diborane-3D-balls-A.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cf/Diborane-3D-balls.png/120px-Diborane-3D-balls.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2d/Tetraborane-3D-balls.png/120px-Tetraborane-3D-balls.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/19/Pentaborane-3D-balls.png/120px-Pentaborane-3D-balls.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d3/Decaborane-3D-balls.png/120px-Decaborane-3D-balls.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/97/Dodecaborane-3D-balls.png/115px-Dodecaborane-3D-balls.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["dimer","chemistry"]],"members":["dimer"],"related":["Boron","Hydrogen","Dimer_(chemistry)","Diborane","Cluster_chemistry","Polyhedra","Isomer","Diborane","Pentaborane","Decaborane","Carborane","International_Union_of_Pure_and_Applied_Chemistry_nomenclature","International_Union_of_Pure_and_Applied_Chemistry_nomenclature","Tetraborane","Deltahedron","Snub_disphenoid","Deltahedron","NMR_spectroscopy","Diborane","Tetraborane","Pentaborane","Decaborane","Caesium_dodecaborate","Electron_deficiency","Covalent_bond","Trigonal_planar","Molecular_symmetry","Diborane","Diborane","William_Lipscomb","Three-center_two-electron_bond","Polyhedral_skeletal_electron_pair_theory","Molecular_orbital","Polyhedral_skeletal_electron_pair_theory","Kenneth_Wade","Four-center_two-electron_bond","Diamagnetism","Pyrophoricity","Pentaborane","Decaborane","Diborane","Diborane","Boron_trifluoride","Electrophile","Nucleophilic","Lewis_base","Deprotonation","Borohydride","Alkyne","Cluster_chemistry","Ligand","Coordination_compound","Hapticity","Zeise's_salt","Carborane","Cluster_chemistry","List_of_famous_Germany_people","List_of_chemists","Alfred_Stock","Alfred_Stock","Cluster_chemistry","William_Nunn_Lipscomb","William_Nunn_Lipscomb","Nobel_prize","Polyhedral_skeletal_electron_pair_theory","Uranium_borohydride","Hermann_Irving_Schlesinger","Reagent","Organic_synthesis","Herbert_C._Brown","Sodium_borohydride","Aldehyde","Ketone","Alcohol","Nobel_prize","Zip_fuel","XB-70_Valkyrie","Triethylborane","SR-71_Blackbird"]}
