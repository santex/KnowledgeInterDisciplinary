Bouton, M. E. (2007)\nLearning and Behavior Sunderland, MA: Sinauer The term \"latent inhibition\"\ndates back to Lubow and Moore (1959). The LI effect is \"latent\" in that it is\nnot exhibited in the stimulus pre-exposure phase, but rather in the subsequent\ntest phase. \"Inhibition\", here, simply connotes that the effect is expressed in\nterms of relatively poor learning. The LI effect is extremely robust, appearing\nin all mammalian species that have been tested and across many different\nlearning paradigms, thereby suggesting some adaptive advantages, such as\nprotecting the organism from associating irrelevant stimuli with other, more\nimportant, events.\n","linknr":178,"url":"Latent_inhibition","recorded":1362668430,"links":19,"instances":["neuroscience","psychology"],"pdf":["http://www.nidsci.org/pdf/carson-peterson-higgins.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20071129121745/http://www.nidsci.org/pdf/carson-peterson-higgins.pdf"],"categories":["Neuropsychology","Creativity","Behavioral concepts","Learning","Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder","Personality traits"],"headings":["Theories","Variation","Physiology","Pathology","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["stimulus","psychology"],["salience","neuroscience"]],"members":["salience","stimulus"],"related":["Classical_conditioning","Stimulus_(psychology)","Creativity","Awareness","Psychosis","Creativity","Intelligence","Autistic","Neurotransmitter","Dopamine","Agonist","Ventral_tegmental_area","Brain","Neurotransmitters","Glutamate","Serotonin","Acetylcholine","Mental_disorder","Personality_trait","Genetic_predisposition","Education","Highly_sensitive_person","Genius","Salience_(neuroscience)"]}
