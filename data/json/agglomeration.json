      "text" : "\n\n, the world's largest urban agglomeration, with 38.4 million people.]] urban\nagglomeration, viewed at dusk.]] In the study of human settlements, an ' urban\nagglomeration' is an extended city or town area comprising the built-up area of\na central place (usually a [[municipality]]) and any suburbs linked by\ncontinuous urban area. INSEE, the French Statistical Institute, uses the term\n[[unité urbaine]], which means continuous urbanized area. However, because of\ndifferences in definitions of what does and does not constitute an\n\"agglomeration\", as well as variations and limitations in statistical or\ngeographical methodology, it can be problematic to compare different\nagglomerations around the world. It may not be clear, for instance, whether an\narea should be considered to be a satellite and part of an agglomeration, or a\ndistinct entity in itself.\n\nThe term \"agglomeration\" is also linked to \"conurbation\", which is a more\nspecific term for large urban clusters where the built-up zones of influence of\ndistinct cities or towns are connected by continuous built-up development\n([[Essen]] - [[Dortmund]] and others in the Rhine-Ruhr district), even in\ndifferent regions, states or countries, ([[Lille]] - [[Kortrijk]] in France and\nBelgium). Each city or town in a conurbation may nevertheless continue to act as\nan independent focus for a substantial part of the area. urban agglomeration is\nthe San Diego-Tijuana metropolitan area, creating a trans-border conurbation\nbetween the western United States and Mexico, respectively.]]\n",
