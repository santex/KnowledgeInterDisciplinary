[http://www.wwnorton.com/college/music/jazz/ch/02/outline.aspx Jazz:\nCollege Edition: Chapter 2: Jazz Form and improvisation | Jazz: W. W. Norton\nStudySpace] ]]\n\nThe 'thirty-two-bar form', often called 'AABA' from the musical form or order in\nwhich its melodies occur, also 'ballad form', Boyd, Jack (1991).\nEncore!: A Guide to Enjoying Music, p.31. ISBN 978-0-87484-862-5. \"It is\nsometimes called ballad form because so many of our popular ballads, middle-of-the-\nroad popular songs, and Country Western songs use this form.\" is common in\nTin Pan Alley songs and later popular music including rock, pop and jazz. Though\nit resembles the ternary form of the operatic da capo aria its popularity\ndeclined and \"there were few instances of it in any type of popular music until\nthe late teens\" of the 20th century. It became \"the principal form\" of American\npopular song around 1925â1926, . Examples include \"Deck the\nHalls\". with AABA form consisting of the chorus or the\nentirety of many songs in the early twentieth century. Benward & Saker\n(2003). Music: In Theory and Practice, Vol. I, p.317-18. Seventh Edition. ISBN\n978-0-07-294262-0. \"The popular chorus form is often referred to as a quaternary\nform, because it usually consists of four phrases.\"\n\nSome Tin Pan Alley songs composed as numbers for musicals precede the main tune\nwith a \"sectional verse\" that is usually sixteen bars long. The verse\nestablishes the background and mood of the number, and is musically\nundistinguished in order to highlight the attractions of the main tune. The main\ntune is called the refrain or chorus. The sectional verse is often omitted from\nmodern performances, and thus the refrain is often the only section remembered\nand heard.\n\nIn the refrain, the A section or verse forms the main melody and is harmonically\nclosed with a cadence on the \"home\" or tonic chord. The B section or 'middle\neight' is also often referred to as the [[bridge (music)|bridge]] and sometimes\nas the release. Benward & Saker (2003), p.318. In it a\nsimple modulation is commonly found and at its end it remains harmonically open,\noften ending on the unresolved dominant chord of the home key and so preparing\nfor the return of the verse. .\n\n\"In this form, the musical structure of each chorus is made up of\nfour eight-bar sections, in an AABA pattern... Thousands of Tin Pan Alley tunes\nshare this scheme and Adorno is quite justified in arguing that to listeners of\nthe time it would be totally predictable.\" . \n\nThirty-two-bar form was often used in rock in the 1950s and '60s, after which\nverse-chorus form became more prevalent. Examples include: *George Gershwin \"I\nGot Rhythm\" *Jerry Lee Lewis' \"Great Balls of Fire\"\n(1957) *The Everly Brothers' \"All I Have to Do Is Dream\"\n(1958) *The Shirelles' \"Will You Love Me Tomorrow\"\n(1960) *The Beach Boys' \"Surfer Girl\" (1963)\n\n 's \"Crazy\" chorus: each\nphrase is eight bars. Benward & Saker (2003), p.122 & 318. ]]\n\nThough more prevalent in the first half of the twentieth century, many\ncontemporary songs show similarity to the form, such as \"Memory\", from Cats,\nwhich features expanded form through the B and A sections repeated in new\nkeys. Songwriters such as the Brill Building and Lennon-\nMcCartney also used modified or extended thirty-two-bar forms, often modifying\nthe number of measures in individual or all sections. The Beatles (\"From Me to\nYou\" (1963) and \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\" (1963)), like many others, would\nextend the form with an instrumental section, second bridge, break or reprise of\nthe introduction, etc., and another return to the main theme. Introductions and\ncodas also extended the form. In \"Down Mexico Way\" \"the A sections â¦ are doubled\nin length, to sixteen barsâbut this affects the overall scheme only\nmarginally\". . 'Compound AABA form' found in The\nPolice's \"Every Breath You Take\" (1983), features a thirty-two-bar section, a\ncontrasting bridge and then a repeat of the thirty-two-bar section, making a\ncompound of ABA and AABA form: AABACAABA: a form of rondo. Other examples\ninclude: *Boston's \"More Than a Feeling\" (1976) .\n*Righteous Brothers' \"You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'\" (1964)\n*Led Zeppelin's \"Whole Lotta Love\" (1969) *The Rolling Stones's\n\"Brown Sugar\" (1971) *Tom Petty's \"Refugee\" (1979)\n","linknr":268,"url":"Thirty-two-bar_form","recorded":1363183419,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Thirty-two-bar_form&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Thirty-two-bar_form&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/Ballad#Ballad_form","/wiki/File:Judy_Garland_in_The_Wizard_of_Oz_trailer.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/Judy_Garland_in_The_Wizard_of_Oz_trailer.jpg/225px-Judy_Garland_in_The_Wizard_of_Oz_trailer.jpg","/wiki/File:Judy_Garland_in_The_Wizard_of_Oz_trailer.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Over_the_Rainbow","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Musical_form","#cite_note-Boyd-2","/wiki/Tin_Pan_Alley","/wiki/Rock_and_roll","/wiki/Pop_music","/wiki/Jazz","/wiki/Ternary_form","/wiki/Opera","/wiki/Da_capo_aria","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Deck_the_Halls","#cite_note-Boyd-2","#cite_note-4","/wiki/Tin_Pan_Alley","/wiki/Section_(music)","/wiki/Bar_(music)","/wiki/Refrain","/wiki/Verse_(popular_music)","/wiki/Cadence_(music)","/wiki/Bridge_(music)","#cite_note-B.26S318-5","/wiki/Modulation_(music)","/wiki/Dominant_(music)","#cite_note-6","/wiki/Theodor_W._Adorno","#cite_note-7","/wiki/Verse-chorus_form","/wiki/George_Gershwin","/wiki/I_Got_Rhythm","#cite_note-Covach-8","/wiki/Jerry_Lee_Lewis","/wiki/Great_Balls_of_Fire","#cite_note-Covach-8","/wiki/The_Everly_Brothers","/wiki/All_I_Have_to_Do_Is_Dream","#cite_note-Covach-8","/wiki/The_Shirelles","/wiki/Will_You_Love_Me_Tomorrow","#cite_note-Covach-8","/wiki/The_Beach_Boys","/wiki/Surfer_Girl_(song)","#cite_note-Covach-8","/wiki/File:Willie_Nelson_-_Crazy_AABA.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a0/Willie_Nelson_-_Crazy_AABA.png/500px-Willie_Nelson_-_Crazy_AABA.png","/wiki/File:Willie_Nelson_-_Crazy_AABA.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Willie_Nelson","/wiki/Crazy_(Willie_Nelson_song)","/wiki/Phrase_(music)","#cite_note-B.26S-9","/wiki/File:Willie_Nelson_-_Crazy_AABA.mid","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/Loudspeaker.svg/11px-Loudspeaker.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/52/Willie_Nelson_-_Crazy_AABA.mid","/wiki/Wikipedia:Media_help","/wiki/File:Willie_Nelson_-_Crazy_AABA.mid","#cite_note-B.26S318-5","/wiki/Brill_Building","/wiki/Lennon-McCartney","/wiki/The_Beatles","/wiki/From_Me_to_You","/wiki/I_Want_to_Hold_Your_Hand","#cite_note-Covach-8","/wiki/The_Police","/wiki/Every_Breath_You_Take","/wiki/Rondo","/wiki/Boston_(band)","/wiki/More_Than_a_Feeling","#cite_note-C74-10","/wiki/Righteous_Brothers","/wiki/You%27ve_Lost_That_Lovin%27_Feelin%27","#cite_note-C74-10","/wiki/Led_Zeppelin","/wiki/Whole_Lotta_Love","#cite_note-C74-10","/wiki/The_Rolling_Stones","/wiki/Brown_Sugar_(song)","#cite_note-C74-10","/wiki/Tom_Petty","/wiki/Refugee_(Tom_Petty_and_the_Heartbreakers_song)","#cite_note-C74-10","/w/index.php?title=Thirty-two-bar_form&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Bridge_(music)","/wiki/Music_theory","#cite_note-Music-11","/wiki/Tonic_(music)","/wiki/Dominant_(music)","/wiki/Subdominant","#cite_note-12","/wiki/Major_and_minor","/wiki/Key_(music)","/wiki/Modulation_(music)","#cite_note-Music-11","/wiki/Melody","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/wiki/Chord_(music)","/wiki/Bar_(music)","/wiki/Solo_(music)","/wiki/Hook_(music)","/w/index.php?title=Thirty-two-bar_form&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-1","http://www.wwnorton.com/college/music/jazz/ch/02/outline.aspx","#cite_ref-Boyd_2-0","#cite_ref-Boyd_2-1","/wiki/Special:BookSources/9780874848625","#cite_ref-3","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0-19-501445-6","#cite_ref-4","/wiki/Special:BookSources/9780072942620","#cite_ref-B.26S318_5-0","#cite_ref-B.26S318_5-1","#cite_ref-6","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0-19-517010-5","#cite_ref-7","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0-335-15275-9","#cite_ref-Covach_8-0","#cite_ref-Covach_8-1","#cite_ref-Covach_8-2","#cite_ref-Covach_8-3","#cite_ref-Covach_8-4","#cite_ref-Covach_8-5","#cite_ref-B.26S_9-0","#cite_ref-C74_10-0","#cite_ref-C74_10-1","#cite_ref-C74_10-2","#cite_ref-C74_10-3","#cite_ref-C74_10-4","#cite_ref-Music_11
