Library of Congress Thomas Jefferson Building, Washington,\nD.C.]] 'Imagination', also called the faculty of 'imagining', is the ability to\nform new images and sensations that are not perceived through sight, hearing, or\nother senses. Imagination helps make knowledge applicable in solving problems\nand is fundamental to integrating experience and the learning process Norman 2000 pp. 1-2 Brian Sutton-\nSmith 1988, p. 22 Archibald MacLeish 1970, p. 887 Kieran Egan 1992, pp. 50 A basic\ntraining for imagination is listening to storytelling (narrative), Northrop Frye 1963, p. 49 in which the exactness\nof the chosen words is the fundamental factor to \"evoke worlds\". As noted by\nGiovanni Pascoli It is a whole cycle of image formation or any sensation\nwhich may be described as \"hidden\" as it takes place without anyone else's\nknowledge. A person may imagine according to his mood, it may be good or bad\ndepending on the situation. Some people imagine in a state of tension or\ngloominess in order to calm themselves. It is accepted as the innate ability and\nprocess of inventing partial or complete personal realms within the mind from\nelements derived from sense perceptions of the shared world. The term is\ntechnically used in psychology for the process of reviving in the mind, percepts\nof objects formerly given in sense perception. Since this use of the term\nconflicts with that of ordinary language, some psychologists have preferred to\ndescribe this process as \"\" or \"\" or to speak of it as \"reproductive\" as opposed\nto \"productive\" or \"constructive\" imagination. Imagined images are seen with the\n\"mind's eye\".\n\nImagination can also be expressed through stories such as fairy tales or\nfantasies.\n\nChildren often use narratives or pretend play in order to exercise their\nimagination. When children develop fantasy they play at two levels: first, they\nuse role playing to act out what they have developed with their imagination, and\nat the second level they play again with their make-believe situation by acting\nas if what they have developed is an actual reality that already exists in\nnarrative myth.\n","linknr":334,"url":"Imagination","recorded":1362668059,"links":62,"instances":["educationist"],"pdf":["http://www.fupress.com/Archivio/pdf/3622.pdf"],"categories":["Imagination|","Cognition","Mental processes"],"headings":["Description","Psychology of imagination","Imagination and memory","Imagination and perception","Imagination vs. belief","Imagination as a reality","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/28/Imagination-Warner-Highsmith.jpeg/200px-Imagination-Warner-Highsmith.jpeg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/Nicolas_P._Rougier%27s_rendering_of_the_human_brain.png/32px-Nicolas_P._Rougier%27s_rendering_of_the_human_brain.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/62/PD-icon.svg/12px-PD-icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Wikiquote-logo-en.svg/40px-Wikiquote-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/38px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["kieran_egan","educationist"],["kieran_egan","educationist"]],"members":["kieran_egan"],"related":["Thomas_Jefferson_Building","Learning_process","Brian_Sutton-Smith","Archibald_MacLeish","Kieran_Egan_(educationist)","Storytelling","Narrative","Northrop_Frye","Giovanni_Pascoli","Cognitive_process","Psychology","Mind","Perception","Language","Mind's_eye","Fairy_tale","Fantasy","Narrative","Fantasy","Role_playing","Myth","Fairy_tale","Fiction","Verisimilitude","Fantasy","Science_fiction","Object_of_the_mind","Imaginary_world","Albert_Einstein","Probability","Insanity","Scientific_method","Hypothesis","Creativity","Ruth_M.J._Byrne","Counterfactual_thinking","Jean_Piaget","Perception","Belief","Nocebo","Hypnosis","Altered_state_of_consciousness","Meditation","Psychosis","Buddhist","Australian_Aborigines","Dreamtime","Pleasure","Suffering","Fear","Psychosomatic_illness","Folie_a_deux","Art","Creativity","Fantasy","Fictional_countries","Idea","Truth","Mimesis","Imagination_inflation","Kieran_Egan_(educationist)","PDF","Kendall_Walton","John_Sallis","Richard_Kearney","Kendall_Walton","John_Sallis","John_Sallis","Richard_Kearney","Richard_Kearney","Open_Directory_Project"]}
