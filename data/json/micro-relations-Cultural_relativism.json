Boas first articulated the idea\nin 1887: \"...civilization is not something absolute, but ... is relative, and\n... our ideas and conceptions are true only so far as our civilization\ngoes.\" Franz Boas 1887 \"Museums of Ethnology and their classification\"\nScience 9: 589 However, Boas did not coin the term.\n\nThe first use of the term recorded in the Dictionary was by philosopher and\nsocial theorist Alain Locke in 1924 to describe Robert Lowie's \"extreme cultural\nrelativism\", found in the latter's 1917 book Culture and\nEthnology. \"cultural, adj. and n.\", OED Online, Sept 2009, Oxford University\nPress, http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50055630 , citing Locke's article\n\"The Concept of Race as Applied to Social Culture\", Howard Review 1 (1924): pp.\n290-299. The term became common among anthropologists after Boas' death in\n1942, to express their synthesis of a number of ideas Boas had developed. Boas\nbelieved that the sweep of cultures, to be found in connection with any sub\nspecies, is so vast and pervasive that there cannot be a relationship between\nculture and race. http://www.utpa.edu/faculty/mglazer/theory/cultural_relat-\nivism.htm Cultural relativism involves specific epistemological and\nmethodological claims. Whether or not these claims necessitate a specific\nethical stance is a matter of debate. This principle should not be confused with\nmoral relativism.\n","linknr":416,"url":"Cultural_relativism","recorded":1362480932,"links":39,"instances":["classification_of_humans"],"pdf":["http://www.upr-info.org/IMG/pdf/blackburn_upr_cultural_relativism.09.2011.pdf","http://www.yorku.ca/jarvie/online_publications/CultRel.pdf"],"categories":["Cultural anthropology","Relativism","Majority–minority relations"],"headings":["Epistemological origins","As a methodological and heuristic device","As a critical device","Comparison to moral relativism","Current debates","Use by nations","See also","References","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/22/Da_Vinci_Vitruve_Luc_Viatour.jpg/180px-Da_Vinci_Vitruve_Luc_Viatour.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/da/Moai_Easter_Island_InvMH-35-61-1.jpg/10px-Moai_Easter_Island_InvMH-35-61-1.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["race","classification_of_humans"]],"members":["race"],"related":["Axiom","Anthropology","Franz_Boas","Alain_Locke","Robert_Lowie","Race_(classification_of_humans)","Epistemology","Ethics","Moral_relativism","Age_of_Enlightenment","Philosophy","Immanuel_Kant","Johann_Gottfried_Herder","Culture","Wilhelm_von_Humboldt","Sociologist","William_Graham_Sumner","Ethnocentrism","Physics","Geography","Linguistic_relativity","Melville_Herskovits","Phoneme","Edward_Sapir","Karl_Pearson","Ernst_Mach","Henri_Poincaré","William_James","John_Dewey","Robert_Lowie","Ethnography","Ethnology","Charles_Darwin","Alfred_Kroeber","Sociology","Psychology","Ruth_Benedict","Heuristic","John_Cook","Moral_relativism","Ruth_Benedict","Margaret_Mead","Clyde_Kluckhohn","United_Nations","Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights","Alfred_Kroeber","Robert_Lowie","Columbia_University","William_Frankena","Cultural_imperialism","Cold_War","Stanley_Diamond","Anthropology","Michel_de_Montaigne","George_W._Stocking,_Jr.","Clifford_Geertz","Talking_past_each_other","Alfred_Kroeber","Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights","Universal_Periodic_Review","China","Viet_Nam","Myanmar","Cuba","Iran","Islamic","Sharia","Yemen","Iran","Pakistan","Malaysia","Mexico","Indonesia","Colombia","Emotivism","Ethnocentrism","Global_justice","Historical_particularism","Intercultural_competence","Moral_purchasing","Moral_relativism","Relativism","Situational_ethics","Xenocentrism","How_to_Observe_Morals_and_Manners","James_Rachels","Roger_Sandall"]}
