The stable balance of attractive and repulsive forces\nbetween atoms when they share electrons is known as covalent bonding.\nFor many molecules, the sharing of electrons allows each atom to attain the\nequivalent of a full outer shell, corresponding to a stable electronic\nconfiguration.\n\nCovalent bonding includes many kinds of interaction, including Ï-bonding, Ï-\nbonding, metal-to-metal bonding, agostic interactions, and\nthree-center two-electron bonds.

Tarr âInorganic Chemistryâ 3rd Ed, Pearson/Prentice Hall\npublisher, ISBN 0-13-035471-6. The term covalent bond dates from 1939. Merriam-\nWebster â Collegiate Dictionary (2000). The prefix co- means jointly,\nassociated in action, partnered to a lesser degree, etc.; thus a \"co-valent\nbond\", in essence, means that the atoms share \"valence\", such as is discussed in\nvalence bond theory. In the molecule H 2, the hydrogen atoms share the\ntwo electrons via covalent bonding. Covalent Bonds, http://hyperphysics.phy-\nastr.gsu.edu/hbase/chemical/bond.html Covalency is greatest between atoms\nof similar electronegativities. Thus, covalent bonding does not necessarily\nrequire the two atoms be of the same elements, only that they be of comparable\nelectronegativity. Although covalent bonding entails sharing of electrons, it is\nnot necessarily delocalized.\n","linknr":299,"url":"Covalent","recorded":1362484106,"links":73,"instances":["chemistry","chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Chemical bonding"],"headings":["History","Physical properties of covalent compounds (polar and non-polar)","Polarity of covalent bonds","Subdivision of covalent bonds","See also","References","Sources","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/Padlock-silver.svg/20px-Padlock-silver.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/19/Covalent_bond_hydrogen.svg/400px-Covalent_bond_hydrogen.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/17/Covalent.svg/200px-Covalent.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["valence","chemistry"],["resonance","chemistry"]],"members":["valence","resonance"],"related":["Chemical_bond","Electron","Atom","Sigma_bond","Pi_bond","Agostic_interaction","Three-center_two-electron_bond","Merriam-Webster","Valence_(chemistry)","Valence_bond_theory","Electronegativity","Delocalized_electron","Lewis_structure","Irving_Langmuir","Gilbert_N._Lewis","Double_bond","Triple_bond","Octet_rule","Quantum_mechanics","Walter_Heitler","Fritz_London","Molecular_hydrogen","Atomic_orbitals","Polar_covalent_bond","Ethanol","Iodine","Graphite","Diamond","Quartz","Resistivity","Electronegativity","Carlton,_Victoria","Metallic_bonding","Bonding_in_solids","Linear_combination_of_atomic_orbitals_molecular_orbital_method","Orbital_hybridisation","Hydrogen_bond","Noncovalent_bonding","Disulfide_bond","Ionic_bond","Covalent_radius","Resonance_(chemistry)","Bond_order","Shared_pair"]}
