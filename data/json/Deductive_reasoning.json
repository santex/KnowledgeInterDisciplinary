If all premises are true,\nthe terms are clear, and the rules of deductive logic are followed, then the\nconclusion reached is necessarily true.\n\nDeductive reasoning (top-down logic) contrasts with inductive reasoning (bottom-\nup logic) in the following way: In deductive reasoning, a conclusion is reached\nfrom general statements, but in inductive reasoning the conclusion is reached\nfrom specific examples. (Note, however, that the inductive reasoning mentioned\nhere is not the same as induction used in mathematical proofs - mathematical\ninduction is actually a form of deductive reasoning.)\n","linknr":740,"url":"Deductive_reasoning","recorded":1362485279,"links":62,"instances":["logic"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Deductive reasoning","Problem solving","Reasoning"],"headings":["Simple Example","Law of Detachment","Law of Syllogism","Deductive Logic: Validity and Soundness","Hume's Skepticism","Deductive reasoning and Education","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/Logical_connectives_Hasse_diagram.svg/20px-Logical_connectives_Hasse_diagram.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["argument","logic"],["argument","logic"]],"members":["argument"],"related":["Reasoning","Argument_(logic)","Premise","Conclusion","Unambiguous","Logic","Logical_necessity","Inductive_reasoning","Inductive_reasoning","Mathematical_induction","Mathematical_induction","Material_conditional","Syllogism","Premise","Term_logic","Term_logic","Aristotle","Propositional_calculus","Predicate_logic","Inductive_reasoning","David_Hume","Inductive_reasoning","Problem_of_induction","Theory_of_justification","Mathematical_proof","Argument_(logic)","Logic","Mathematical_logic","Abductive_reasoning","Analogy","Closed_world_assumption","Correspondence_theory_of_truth","Defeasible_reasoning","Decision_making","Decision_theory","Fallacy","Geometry","Hypothetico-deductive_method","Inquiry","Mathematical_induction","Inductive_reasoning","Inference","Logical_consequence","Natural_deduction","Propositional_calculus","Retroductive_reasoning","Scientific_method","Soundness","Syllogism","Vincent_F._Hendricks","Philip_Johnson-Laird","Ruth_M._J._Byrne"]}
