      "text" : "\n\n\n\n'Meat' is animal flesh that is eaten as food.<ref name=\"Lawrie\"></ref> Humans\nare omnivorous, and have hunted and killed animals for meat since prehistoric\ntimes. The advent of civilization allowed the domestication of animals such as\nchickens, sheep, pigs and cattle, and eventually their use in meat production on\nan industrial scale.\n\nMeat is mainly composed of water and protein, and is usually eaten together with\nother food. Some types are edible raw (e.g., beef or tuna steaks ), but is\nnormally eaten after it has been cooked and seasoned or processed in a variety\nof ways (e.g., curing or smoking). Unprocessed meat will spoil within hours or\ndays. Spoilage is caused by the practically unavoidable infection and subsequent\ndecomposition of meat by bacteria and fungi, which are borne by the animal\nitself, by the people handling the meat, and by their implements.\n\nMeat consumption varies worldwide, depending on cultural or religious\npreferences, as well as economic conditions. Vegetarians choose not to eat meat\nbecause of ethical, environmental, religious or health concerns that are\nassociated with meat production and consumption.\n\nMost often, \"meat\" refers to skeletal muscle and associated fat and other\ntissues, but it may also describe other edible tissues such as offal.<ref\nname=\"Lawrie\" /> Conversely, \"meat\" is sometimes also used in a more restrictive\nsense â€“ the flesh of mammalian species (pigs, cattle, lambs, etc.) raised and\nprepared for human consumption, to the exclusion of fish and other seafood,\npoultry, and other animals.\n",
