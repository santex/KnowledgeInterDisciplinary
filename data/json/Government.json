{"cursor":"65482","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\n\nA 'government' is the system by which a state or community is\ngoverned. In British English (and that of the Commonwealth of\nNations), a government more narrowly refers to the particular executive in\ncontrol of a state at a given time âknown in American English as an\n[[administration (government)#United States|administration]]. In American\nEnglish, government refers to the larger system by which any state is\norganized. Furthermore, government is occasionally used in English as\na synonym for [[governance]].\n\nIn the case of its broad definition, government normally consists of\nlegislators, administrators, and arbitrators. Government is the means by which\nstate policy is enforced, as well as the mechanism for determining the policy of\nthe state. A form of government, or form of state governance, refers to the set\nof political systems and institutions that make up the organisation of a\nspecific government.\n\nStates are served by a continuous succession of different\ngovernments. Each successive government is composed of a body of\nindividuals who control and exercise control over political decision-making.\nTheir function is to make and enforce laws and arbitrate conflicts. In some\nsocieties, this group is often a self-perpetuating or hereditary class. In other\nsocieties, such as democracies, the political roles remain, but there is\nfrequent turnover of the people actually filling the positions.\n\nGovernment of any kind currently affects every human activity in many important\nways. For this reason, political scientists generally argue that government\nshould not be studied by itself; but should be studied along with anthropology,\neconomics, history, philosophy, science, and sociology.\n","linknr":1201,"url":"Government","recorded":1362477351,"links":162,"instances":["united_states","political_philosophy","government","polity","fantasy","social_and_political","collective_executive","social","mythology"],"pdf":["http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/2023/SWP-1353-09057784.pdf","http://www.systemicpeace.org/GlobalReport2011.pdf","http://www.systemicpeace.org/GlobalReport2011.pdf","http://www.international-alert.org/sites/default/files/publications/MDG.pdf","http://www.international-alert.org/sites/default/files/publications/MDG.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20130203172511/http://www.freedomhouse.org/sites/default/files/FIW%202013%20Booklet.pdf","http://www.freedomhouse.org/sites/default/files/FIW%202013%20Booklet.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20130203172511/http://www.freedomhouse.org/sites/default/files/FIW%202013%20Booklet.pdf"],"categories":["Forms
