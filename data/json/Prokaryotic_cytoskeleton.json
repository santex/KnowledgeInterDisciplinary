The prokaryotic cytoskeletal elements are matched with their\neukaryotic homologue and hypothesized cellular function. ]]\n\nThe 'prokaryotic cytoskeleton' is the collective name for all structural\nfilaments in prokaryotes. It was once thought that prokaryotic cells did not\npossess cytoskeletons, but advances in visualization technology and structure\ndetermination led to the discovery of filaments in these cells in the early\n1990s. Not only have analogues for all major\ncytoskeletal proteins in eukaryotes been found in prokaryotes, cytoskeletal\nproteins with no known eukaryotic homologues have also been\ndiscovered. Cytoskeletal elements play essential roles in cell\ndivision, protection, shape determination, and polarity determination in various\nprokaryotes. \n","linknr":669,"url":"Prokaryotic_cytoskeleton","recorded":1362483770,"links":19,"instances":["biology"],"pdf":["http://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/SS/Lowe_J/group/PDF/annrev2006.pdf","http://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/SS/Lowe_J/group/PDF/annrev2006.pdf"],"categories":["Cell anatomy","Cytoskeleton"],"headings":["FtsZ","MreB","Crescentin","ParM and SopA","MinCDE system","Bactofilin","Crenactin","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/20/Prokaryotic_Cytoskeleton.png/350px-Prokaryotic_Cytoskeleton.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["analogy","biology"]],"members":["analogy"],"related":["Protein_filament","Prokaryotes","Cytoskeleton","Analogy_(biology)","Eukaryotes","Cell_division","FtsZ","Cell_division","Cytokinesis","Septum","Cytokinesis","Actin","Tubulin","Primary_structure","Monomeric","Guanosine_triphosphate","Tubulin","Antibiotic","MreB","Actin","Primary_structure","Cytoplasmic_membrane","Peptidoglycan","Septum","Crescentin","Intermediate_filaments","Keratin_19","Lamin","ParM","Actin","Tubulin","Dynamic_instability","Plasmid","DNA-binding_protein","Tubulin","Mitotic_spindle","Kinetochore","Centromere","Chromosome","Plasmid","Kinetochore","Centromere","Septum","Bacilli","Prokaryotes","Cytoskeleton","Protein_filament","Cell_division","Cytokinesis"]}
