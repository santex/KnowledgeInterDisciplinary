{"cursor":"8115","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The '1978 [[NBA Playoffs]]' was the postseason tournament of the National\nBasketball Association's 1977-78 season. The tournament concluded with the\nEastern Conference champion Washington Bullets defeating the Western Conference\nchampion Seattle SuperSonics 4 games to 3 in the NBA Finals. Wes Unseld was\nnamed NBA Finals MVP. To date, it remains the only NBA title that the Washington\nBullets have ever won.\n\nIt was the third NBA Finals appearance and first title for the Bullets, founded\nin 1961. The Sonics made the Finals for the first time in their 11-year\nexistence. This would be the first of two straight meetings in the Finals\nbetween the Bullets and Sonics, with Seattle winning the title the next year.\n\nThis was the first time since the expansion of the playoff field to 10 teams in\n1975 that neither conference champion had the benefit of a first-round bye by\nbeing one of the top two teams in the conference during the regular season. The\n1979 Finals rematch between the Sonics and Bullets took place with both teams as\nthe #1 seed in their respective conference.\n\nThe Denver Nuggets, one of the four former American Basketball Association teams\nto join the NBA the previous season, became the first of them to win an NBA\nplayoff series, defeating the Milwaukee Bucks in a 7-game conference semifinal.\n","linknr":201,"url":"1978_NBA_Playoffs","recorded":1375078617,"links":["/w/index.php?title=1978_NBA_Playoffs&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=1978_NBA_Playoffs&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/National_Basketball_Association","/wiki/1977%E2%80%9378_NBA_season","/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)","/wiki/Washington_Bullets","/wiki/Western_Conference_(NBA)","/wiki/Seattle_SuperSonics","/wiki/1978_NBA_Finals","/wiki/Wes_Unseld","/wiki/Bill_Russell_NBA_Finals_Most_Valuable_Player_Award","/wiki/Washington_Bullets","/wiki/1975_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/Denver_Nuggets","/wiki/American_Basketball_Association","/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks","#Bracket","#Western_Conference","#Eastern_Conference","#NBA_Finals","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=1978_NBA_Playoffs&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=1978_NBA_Playoffs&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Seattle_SuperSonics","/wiki/Phoenix_Suns","/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks","/wiki/Seattle_SuperSonics","/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers","/wiki/Portland_Trail_Blazers","/wiki/Seattle_SuperSonics","/wiki/Denver_Nuggets","/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks","/wiki/Denver_Nuggets","/wiki/Seattle_SuperSonics","/w/index.php?title=1978_NBA_Playoffs&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/Washington_Bullets","/wiki/Washington_Bullets","/wiki/Atlanta_Hawks","/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers","/wiki/New_York_Knicks","/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers","/wiki/New_York_Knicks","/wiki/San_Antonio_Spurs","/wiki/Washington_Bullets","/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers","/wiki/Washington_Bullets","/w/index.php?title=1978_NBA_Playoffs&action=edit&section=4","/wiki/1978_NBA_Finals","/wiki/Washington_Bullets","/wiki/Seattle_SuperSonics","/wiki/2012-2013_NBA_season","/w/index.php?title=1978_NBA_Playoffs&action=edit&section=5","http://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/NBA_1978.html","/wiki/Template:NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/Template_talk:NBA_Playoffs","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:NBA_Playoffs&action=edit","/wiki/NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals","/wiki/NBA_Finals","/wiki/NBA_60_Greatest_Playoff_Moments","/wiki/List_of_NBA_game_sevens","/wiki/List_of_NBA_franchise_post-season_streaks","/wiki/List_of_NBA_franchise_post-season_droughts","/wiki/WNBA_Playoffs","/wiki/1947_BAA_Playoffs","/wiki/1948_BAA_Playoffs","/wiki/1949_BAA_Playoffs","/wiki/1950_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/1951_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/1952_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/1953_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/1954_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/1955_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/1956_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/1957_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/1958_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/1959_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/1960_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/1961_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/1962_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/1963_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/1964_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/1965_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/1966_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/1967_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/1968_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/1969_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/1970_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/1971_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/1972_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/1973_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/1974_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/1975_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/1976_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/1977_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/1979_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/1980_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/1981_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/1982_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/1983_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/1984_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/1985_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/1986_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/1987_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/1988_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/1989_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/1990_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/1991_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/1992_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/1993_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/1994_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/1995_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/1996_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/1997_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/1998_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/1999_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/2000_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/2001_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/2002_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/2003_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/2004_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/2005_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/2006_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/2007_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/2008_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/2009_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/2010_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/2011_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/2012_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/2013_NBA_Playoffs","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=1978_NBA_Playoffs&oldid=560608145","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:National_Basketball_Association_playoffs","/wiki/Category:1978_in_basketball","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=1978+NBA+Playoffs&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Spec
