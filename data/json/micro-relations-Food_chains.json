A food chain differs from\na food web, because the complex polyphagous network of feeding relations are\naggregated into trophic species and the chain only follows linear monophagous\npathways. A common metric used to quantify food web trophic structure is food\nchain length. In its simplest form, the length of a chain is the number of links\nbetween a trophic consumer and the base of the web and the mean chain length of\nan entire web is the arithmetic average of the lengths of all chains in a food\nweb.\n\nFood chains were first introduced by the African-Arab scientist and philosopher\nAl-Jahiz in the 9th century and later popularized in a book published in 1927 by\nCharles Elton, which also introduced the food web concept.\n","linknr":465,"url":"Food_chains","recorded":1362511453,"links":80,"instances":["food_chain"],"pdf":["http://spider.allegheny.edu/employee/M/mostrofs/mywebfiles/Bio330/Bio330Readings/briand_and_cohen.pdf","http://spider.allegheny.edu/employee/M/mostrofs/mywebfiles/Bio330/Bio330Readings/briand_and_cohen.pdf","http://cas.bellarmine.edu/tietjen/Secret/PlantGenome/General%20Model%20for%20Food%20WEb%20Structure.pdf","http://cas.bellarmine.edu/tietjen/Secret/PlantGenome/General%20Model%20for%20Food%20WEb%20Structure.pdf","http://www.vliz.be/imisdocs/publications/72841.pdf","http://www.vliz.be/imisdocs/publications/72841.pdf","http://www.d.umn.edu/~thrabik/Vander%20Zanden%20et%20al.%201999.pdf","http://www.d.umn.edu/~thrabik/Vander%20Zanden%20et%20al.%201999.pdf","http://www.d.umn.edu/~thrabik/Vander%20Zanden%20et%20al.%201999.pdf","http://www.d.umn.edu/~thrabik/Vander%20Zanden%20et%20al.%201999.pdf"],"categories":["Trophic ecology","Systems ecology"],"headings":["Food chain length","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/Food_chain.jpg/160px-Food_chain.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/Chesapeake_Waterbird_Food_Web.jpg/220px-Chesapeake_Waterbird_Food_Web.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Earth_flag_PD.jpg/32px-Earth_flag_PD.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b3/FoodWeb.jpg/140px-FoodWeb.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Genomics_GTL_Program_Payoffs.jpg/140px-Genomics_GTL_Program_Payoffs.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["consumers","food_chain"]],"members":["consumers"],"related":["Northern_pike","Perch","Common_Bleak","Shrimp","Food_web","Trophic_species","Polyphagous","Monophagous","Al-Jahiz","Chesapeake_Bay","Continuous_variable","Biological_organisation","Trophic_level","Ecologist","Ecotoxicology","Biomagnification","Environmental_contaminant","Autotroph","Consumers_(food_chain)","Trophic_pyramid","Predator-prey_interaction"]}
