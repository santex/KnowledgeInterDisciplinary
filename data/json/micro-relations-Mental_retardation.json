It has historically been defined as\nan Intelligence Quotient score under 70. Once focused almost entirely on\ncognition, the definition now includes both a component relating to mental\nfunctioning and one relating to individuals' functional skills in their\nenvironment. As a result, a person with a below-average intelligence quotient\nmay not be considered mentally retarded. 'Syndromic mental retardation' is\nintellectual deficits associated with other medical and behavioral signs and\nsymptoms. Non-syndromic mental retardation refers to intellectual deficits that\nappear without other abnormalities.\n\nThe terms used for this condition are subject to a process called the euphemism\ntreadmill. This means that whatever term is chosen for this condition, it\neventually becomes perceived as an insult. The terms mental retardation and\nmentally retarded were invented in the middle of the 20th century to replace the\nprevious set of terms, which were deemed to have become offensive. By the end of the 20th century,\nthese terms themselves have come to be widely seen as disparaging and\npolitically incorrect and in need of replacement. {{cite book |author=Cummings, Nicholas A.; Rogers H.

In the future, the ICD-11 is expected to replace\nthe term mental retardation with intellectual disability, and the DSM-5 is\nexpected to replace it with intellectual developmental disorder. {{Cite
