It developed through the spread\nof Greek following the conquests of Alexander the Great in the 4th century BC,\nand served as the common lingua franca of much of the Mediterranean region and\nthe Middle East during the following centuries. Based mainly on Attic and\nrelated Ionic speech forms, with various admixtures brought about through\ndialect levelling with other varieties, KoinÃ© Greek\ndisplayed a wide spectrum of different styles, ranging from more conservative\nliterary forms to the spoken vernaculars of the time. As the dominant\nlanguage of the Byzantine Empire it developed further into Medieval Greek, the\nmain ancestor of Modern Greek.\n\nLiterary KoinÃ© was the medium of much of post-classical Greek literary and\nscholarly writing, such as the works of Plutarch and Polybius. KoinÃ© is also the language of the Christian New Testament, of\nthe Septuagint (the 3rd century BC Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible), and\nof most early Christian theological writing by the Church Fathers. In this\ncontext, KoinÃ© Greek is also known as \"Biblical\", \"New Testament\" or\n\"patristic Greek\".
