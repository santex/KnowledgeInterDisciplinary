{"cursor":"2511","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Sir Thomas Kent' (c.1460-1511) was an Irish judge who held office as Chief\nBaron of the Irish Exchequer.\n\nHe was born in Drogheda; like most Irish judges of the time he belonged to the\nAnglo-Irish gentry of the Pale. The family came from Kent to County Meath in the\nthirteenth century. Sir William Darcy, Vice-Treasurer of Ireland, was his\ncousin. Kenny, Colum The King's Inns and the Kingdom of Ireland Irish\nAcademic Press Dublin 1992 p.21\n\nKent and Darcy were in Dublin in 1482-3, studying law. The King's Inn was not\nfounded until the next century, but some rudimentary form of legal education\nexisted. Darcy many years later recalled that he and Kent lodged with John\nEstrete, the deputy Chief Baron, to study those legal texts, notably the\nTreatise on Tenures of Thomas de Littleton, necessary to proceed to the English\nInns of Court and qualify as a barrister. Kenny p.22 On holidays they\nwent to the home of Philip Bermingham, the Lord Chief Justice of Ireland, to\nstudy dancing and the harp; these were not simply recreations but part of a\nyoung lawyer's education. Kent then proceeded to London; most likely he went to\nLincoln's Inn, where his cousin enrolled in 1485. Kenny p.22\n\nIn 1495 Kent was appointed to a minor official post, Escheator of the Exchequer\nof Ireland. In 1496-7 he was appointed Serjeant. Hart, A.R. The King's\nSerjeants at law in Ireland Four Courts Press Dublin 2000 p.25 The\nappointment suggests that Kent was a protÃ©gÃ© of Gerald FitzGerald, 8th Earl of\nKildare, who had been restored to favour after a period of disgrace, and had\nobtained from King Henry VII the right to appoint all judges and law officers\nexcept the Lord Chancellor of Ireland. Hart believes that Kent's appointment\nmarks a return to the practice of appointing Irish- born judges, whereas after\nthe Lambert Simnel rebellion the practice had been to appoint judges of English\nbirth. Hart p.25\n\nKent was appointed Chief Baron in 1504 and knighted in 1509; he died in\n1511. Ball,F.
