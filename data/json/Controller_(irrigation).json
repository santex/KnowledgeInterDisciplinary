{"cursor":"3820","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nAn 'irrigation controller' is a device to operate automatic irrigation systems\nsuch as lawn sprinklers and drip irrigation systems. Most controllers have a\nmeans of setting the frequency of irrigation, the start time, and the duration\nof watering. Some controllers have additional features such as multiple programs\nto allow different watering frequencies for different types of plants, rain\ndelay settings, input terminals for sensors such as rain and freeze sensors,\nsoil moisture sensors, weather data, remote operation, etc.\n\nThere are two basic types of controllers, electric and hydraulic. Most automatic\nirrigation valves are diaphragm valves in which the water above the diaphragm\nmust be discharged for the valve to open. In a hydraulic system, the controller\nand valves are connected via small plastic tubes approximately 4 mm (Â¼ in)\nin diameter. The controller opens the tube connected to the valve, allowing that\nvalve to open.\n\nMost newer systems employ electromechanical or electronic controllers. In this\nscenario, the controller is connected to an electrical circuit that operates a\nsolenoid attached to each valve (solenoid valve). When the solenoid is actuated,\nthe water above the diaphragm is relieved and the valve opens.\n\nAlthough sophisticated controllers that allow irrigation schedules to be\nautomatically adjusted according to the weather have been available for many\nyears, until recently these controllers were out of reach of the average\nconsumer. One type is evapotranspiration controllers or \"ET controllers\".\nSeveral manufacturers are now producing controllers that can be automatically\nupdated by either a simple weather sensor, via a pager that receives a daily\nupdate from a network of local weather stations, or through soil moisture\nsensors. One company has also introduced a product that gathers information from\nthe internet to update the watering schedule. [http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/technology/2008/07/cyber-rain-\nwate.html Los Angeles Times] With approximately half of potable water in\nurban areas being used for irrigation , and many homeowners either not taking\nthe time to regularly adjust the programming on their controllers or simply not\nknowing how, these \"smart controllers\" have been shown to be helpful in\nachieving water conservation .\n\nThere are broadly two categories of irrigation controllers: domestic ones for\ngardening applications, and professional controllers for more demanding\nagricultural applications. While most domestic (gardening) controllers can only\nopen/close zones based on a time duration, without any feedback from the\nirrigation process, professional irrigation controllers can irrigate based on\nvolume (quantities defined in cubic meters / Gallons), receive feedback from the\nprocess, and react to actual events happening during the process.\n\nFor example, the typical professional controller will calculate the actual flow\nrate running in the system when a specific zone is operated, compare this to a\npre-configured required amount, and adjust the irrigation process if deviation\nfrom the zone's flow rate is detected; This mechanism is called \"Flow\nmonitoring\", and can prevent irrigation when a burst is occurring in the main\nline or in the zone's hydraulic components. The controller can also alert the\noperator locally via its interface, or remotely by sending an SMS or a message\nto a central control.\n\nThe use of smart professional irrigation controllers is constantly increasing as\nthe shortage of water does.\n","linknr":101,"url":"Controller_(irrigation)","recorded":1363491985,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Controller_(irrigation)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Controller_(irrigation)&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Controller_(irrigation)&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Template:Citation_needed","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/Irrigation","/wiki/Lawn_sprinkler","/wiki/Drip_irrigation","/wiki/Rain_sensor","/wiki/Soil_moisture_sensors","/wiki/Electric","/wiki/Hydraulic","/wiki/Diaphragm_valve","/wiki/Solenoid","/wiki/Solenoid_valve","/wiki/Evapotranspiration","/wiki/Manufacturer","/wiki/Weather","/wiki/Pager","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Potable","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/wiki/Water_conservation","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/wiki/SMS","/w/index.php?title=Controller_(irrigation)&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Timer","/w/index.php?title=Controller_(irrigation)&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-1","http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/technology/2008/07/cyber-rain-wate.html","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Controller_(irrigation)&oldid=514391609","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Gardening_aids","/wiki/Category:Irrigation","/wiki/Category:Articles_needing_additional_references_from_April_2011","/wiki/Category:All_articles_needing_additional_references","/wiki/Category:All_articles_with_unsourced_statements","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_unsourced_statements_from_October_2008","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Controller+%28irrigation%29&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Controller+%28irrigation%29","/wiki/Controller_(irrigation)","/wiki/Talk:Controller_(irrigation)","#","/wiki/Controller_(irrigation)","/w/index.php?title=Controller_(irrigation)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Controller_(irrigation)&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Controller_(irrigation)","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Controller_(irrigation)","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Controller_(irrigation)&oldid=514391609","/w/index.php?title=Controller_(irrigation)&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Controller_%28irrigation%29&id=514391609","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Controller+%28irrigation%29","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Controller+%28irrigation%29&oldid=514391609&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Controller_(irrigation)&printable=yes","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controller_(irrigation)","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=skins.vector&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","/w/index.php?title=MediaWiki:Gadget-ReferenceTooltips.js&action=raw&ctype=text/javascript&508635914","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Gardening
