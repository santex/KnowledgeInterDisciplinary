{"cursor":"6715","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nIn Greek mythology 'Ino' ( [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=P-\nerseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D*%29inw%2F Henry George Liddell. Robert\nScott. A Greek-English Lexicon] ) was a mortal queen of Thebes, who after\nher death and transfiguration was worshiped as a goddess under her epithet\nLeucothea, the \"white goddess.\" Alcman called her \"Queen of the Sea\"\n(Î¸Î±Î»Î±ÏÏÎ¿Î¼Î­Î´Î¿ÏÏÎ±), Alcman, fragment 83. which, if not hyperbole, would\nmake her a doublet of Amphitrite.\n\nIn her mortal self, Ino, the second wife of the Minyan king Athamas, the mother\nof Learches and Melicertes, daughter of Cadmus and Harmonia Hesiod, who\ncalls her only Ino, lists her among the \"glorious offspring\" of unions between a\nmortal and a goddess ([[Theogony]]. 975f). and stepmother of Phrixus and\nHelle, was one of the three sisters of Semele, the mortal woman of the house of\nCadmus who gave birth to Dionysus. The three sisters were Agave, AutonoÃ« and\nIno, who was a surrogate for the divine nurses of Dionysus: \"Ino was a\nprimordial Dionysian woman, nurse to the god and a divine maenad\" (Kerenyi\n1976:246).\n\nMaenads were reputed to tear their own children limb from limb in their madness.\nIn the back-story to the heroic tale of Jason and the Golden Fleece, Phrixus and\nHelle, twin children of Athamas and Nephele, were hated by their stepmother,\nIno. Ino hatched a devious plot to get rid of the twins, roasting all the crop\nseeds of Boeotia so they would not grow. [[Bibliotheke]] i.9.1; \"it is\npossible, however\", Kerenyi suggests (The Gods of the Greeks p 264) \"that\noriginally she did not cause the seed-corn to be roasted, but introduced the\npractice of roasting corn in general.\" The local farmers, frightened of\nfamine, asked a nearby oracle for assistance. Ino bribed the men sent to the\noracle to lie and tell the others that the oracle required the sacrifice of\nPhrixus. Athamas reluctantly agreed. Before he was killed though, Phrixus and\nHelle were rescued by a flying golden ram sent by Nephele, their natural mother.\nHelle fell off the ram into the Hellespont (which was named after her, meaning\nSea of Helle) and drowned, but Phrixus survived all the way to Colchis, where\nKing Aeetes took him in and treated him kindly, giving Phrixus his daughter,\nChalciope, in marriage. In gratitude, Phrixus gave the king the golden fleece of\nthe ram, which Aeetes hung in a tree in his kingdom.\n\nLater, Ino raised Dionysus, her nephew, son of her sister Semele, Local\ntradition sited the suckling of Dionysus at Brasiai in Laconia. (Kerenyi\n1951:264). causing Hera's intense jealousy. In vengeance, Hera struck\nAthamas with insanity. Athamas went mad, slew one of his sons, Learchus,\nthinking he was a ram, and set out in frenzied pursuit of Ino. To escape him Ino\nthrew herself into the sea with her son Melicertes. Both were afterwards\nworshipped as marine divinities, Ino as Leucothea (\"the white goddess\"),\nMelicertes as Palaemon. Alternatively, Ino was also stricken with insanity and\nkilled Melicertes by boiling him in a cauldron, then took the cauldron and\njumped into the sea with it. A sympathetic Zeus did not want Ino to die, and\ntransfigured her and Melicertes as Leucothea and Palaemon.\n\nThe story of Ino, Athamas and Melicertes is relevant also in the context of two\nlarger themes. Ino, daughter of Cadmus and\nHarmonia, had an end just as tragic as her siblings: Semele died while pregnant\nwith Zeus' child, killed by her own pride and lack of trust in her lover; Agave\nkilled her own son, King Pentheus, while struck with Dionysian madness, and\nActaeon, son of Autonoe, the third sibling, was torn apart by his own hunting\ndogs. Also, the insanity of Ino and Athamas, who hunted his own son Learchos as\na stag and slew him, can be explained as a result of their contact with\nDionysus, whose presence can cause insanity. None can escape the powers of\nDionysus, the god of wine. Euripides took up the tale in [[The Bacchae]],\nexplaining their madness in Dionysiac terms, as a result of their having\ninitially resisted belief in the god's divinity.\n\nWhen Athamas returned to his second wife, Ino, Themisto (his third wife) sought\nrevenge by dressing her children in white clothing and Ino's in black and\ndirecting the murder of the children in black. Ino switched their clothes\nwithout Themisto knowing and she killed her own children.\n\nTransformed into the goddess Leucothea, Ino also represents one of the many\nsources of divine aid to Odysseus in the [[Odyssey]] (5:333ff), her earliest\nappearance in literature. Homer calls her \"Ino-Leocothea of the beautiful ankles\n[ÎºÎ±Î»Î»Î¯ÏÏÏÏÎ¿Ï], daughter of Cadmus, who was once a mortal speaking with the\ntongue of men, but now in the salt sea-waters has received honor at the hands of\nthe gods\". Providing Odysseus with a veil and telling him to discard his cloak\nand raft, she instructs him how he can entrust himself to the waves and succeed\nin reaching land and eventually Ithaca.\n\nIn historical times, a sisterhood of maenads of Thebes in the service of\nDionysus traced their descent in the female line from Ino; we know this because\nan inscription at Magnesia on the Maeander summoned three maenads from Thebes,\nfrom the house of Ino, to direct the new mysteries of Dionysus at Magnesia\n(Burkert 1992:44).\n","linknr":243,"url":"Ino_(Greek_Mythology)","recorded":1374523171,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Ino_(Greek_mythology)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Ino_(Greek_mythology)&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","/wiki/Ino_(Greek_mythology)","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","/w/index.php?title=Ino_(Greek_Mythology)&redirect=no","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Death_Pentheus_Louvre_G445.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3c/Death_Pentheus_Louvre_G445.jpg/240px-Death_Pentheus_Louvre_G445.jpg","/wiki/File:Death_Pentheus_Louvre_G445.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Greek_mythology","/wiki/Help:IPA_for_English","/wiki/Help:IPA_for_English#Key","/wiki/Help:IPA_for_English#Key","/wiki/Help:IPA_for_English#Key","/wiki/Help:IPA_for_English#Key","/wiki/Help:IPA_for_English","/wiki/Greek_language","/wiki/Help:IPA_for_Greek","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Thebes_(Greece)","/wiki/Epithet","/wiki/Leucothea","/wiki/Alcman","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Amphitrite","/wiki/Minyans","/wiki/Athamas","/wiki/Learches","/wiki/Melicertes","/wiki/Cadmus","/wiki/Harmonia_(Greek_goddess)","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Phrixus","/wiki/Helle_(mythology)","/wiki/Semele","/wiki/Dionysus","/wiki/Agave_(mythology)","/wiki/Autono%C3%AB","/wiki/Dionysus","/wiki/Maenad","/wiki/Back-story","/wiki/Argonautica","/wiki/Nephele","/wiki/Boeotia","#cite_note-4","/wiki/Oracle","/wiki/Hellespont","/wiki/Colchis","/wiki/Aeetes","/wiki/Chalciope","/wiki/Golden_fleece","/wiki/Dionysus","/wiki/Semele","#cite_note-5","/wiki/Hera","/wiki/Hera","/wiki/Athamas","/wiki/Learchus","/wiki/Melicertes","/wiki/Leucothea","/wiki/Palaemon","/wiki/Zeus","/wiki/Leucothea","/wiki/Palaemon","/wiki/Athamas","/wiki/Melicertes","/wiki/Cadmus","/wiki/Harmonia_(Greek_goddess)","/wiki/Semele","/wiki/Zeus","/wiki/Agave_(mythology)","/wiki/Pentheus","/wiki/Actaeon","/wiki/Autonoe","/wiki/Learchos","/wiki/Euripides","/wiki/The_Bacchae","/wiki/Themisto","/wiki/Odysseus","/wiki/Odyssey","/wiki/Maenad","/wiki/Magnesia_on_the_Maeander","/w/index.php?title=Ino_(Greek_mythology)&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D*%29inw%2F","#cite_ref-2","#cite_ref-3","/wiki/Hesiod","/wiki/Theogony","#cite_ref-4","/wiki/Bibliotheke","#cite_ref-5","/wiki/Laconia","/w/index.php?title=Ino_(Greek_mythology)&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0-7141-2255-6","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0892367423","/wiki/Walter_Burkert","/wiki/Karl_Kerenyi","/wiki/Achaeans_(Homer)","/wiki/Genealogy","/wiki/Greek_mythology","/wiki/Inachus","/wiki/Meliae","/wiki/Zeus","/wiki/Io_(mythology)","/wiki/Phoroneus","/wiki/Epaphus","/wiki/Memphis_(mythology)","/wiki/Libya_(mythology)","/wiki/Poseidon","/wiki/Belus_(Egyptian)","/wiki/Achiroe","/wiki/Agenor","/wiki/Telephassa","/wiki/Danaus","/wiki/Pieria_(mythology)","/wiki/Aegyptus","/wiki/Cadmus","/wiki/Cilix","/wiki/Europa_(mythology)","/wiki/Phoenix_(son_of_Agenor)","/wiki/Hypermnestra","/wiki/Lynceus","/wiki/Harmonia_(mythology)","/wiki/Zeus","/wiki/Polydorus_(son_of_Cadmus)","/wiki/Sparta_(mythology)","/wiki/Lacedaemon_(mythology)","/wiki/Ocalea_(mythology)","/wiki/Abas_(son_of_Lynceus)","/wiki/Agave_(mythology)","/wiki/Sarpedon","/wiki/Rhadamanthus","/wiki/Autono%C3%AB","/wiki/Eurydice_of_Argos","/wiki/Acrisius","/wiki/Minos","/wiki/Zeus","/wiki/Dana%C3%AB","/wiki/Semele","/wiki/Zeus","/wiki/Perseus","/wiki/Dionysus","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Ino","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ino_(Greek_mythology)&oldid=549224150","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Queens_in_Greek_mythology","/wiki/Category:Theban_mythology","/wiki/Category:Articles_containing_Greek-language_text","/wiki/Category:Commons_category_with_local_link_same_as_on_Wikidata","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Ino+%28Greek+mythology%29&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Ino+%28Greek+mythology%29","/wiki/Ino_(Greek_mythology)","/wiki/Talk:Ino_(Greek_mythology)
