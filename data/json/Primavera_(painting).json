Painted ca. 1482, the painting is\ndescribed in Culture & Values (2009) as \"[o]ne of the most popular paintings in\nWestern art\". It is also, according to Botticelli, Primavera (1998), \"one of the\nmost written about, and most controversial paintings in the world.\" While most\ncritics agree that the painting, depicting a group of mythological figures in a\ngarden, is allegorical for the lush growth of Spring, other meanings have also\nbeen explored. Among them, the work is sometimes cited as illustrating the ideal\nof Neoplatonic love. The painting itself carries no title and was first called\nLa Primavera by the art historian Giorgio Vasari who saw it at Villa Castello,\njust outside Florence, in 1550.\n\nThe history of the painting is not certainly known, though it seems to have\nbeen commissioned by one of the Medici family. It contains elements of Ovid\nand Lucretius and may have been inspired by a poem by Poliziano. Since 1919\nthe painting has been part of the collection of the Uffizi Gallery in\nFlorence, Italy.\n","linknr":367,"url":"Primavera_(painting)","recorded":1362575255,"links":42,"instances":["art","mythology","mythology","world_war_ii","mythology","mythology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["1482 paintings","Botticelli paintings in the Uffizi","Paintings of Venus","Spring (season)"],"headings":["Composition","Themes","History","Notes","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3c/Botticelli-primavera.jpg/345px-Botticelli-primavera.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/28/Primavera_03.jpg/220px-Primavera_03.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/Pallasetlecentaure.jpg/200px-Pallasetlecentaure.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/10/Sandro_Botticelli_041.jpg/220px-Sandro_Botticelli_041.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e0/Primavera_04.jpg/133px-Primavera_04.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ab/Primavera_05.jpg/136px-Primavera_05.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ad/Sandro_Botticelli_039.jpg/148px-Sandro_Botticelli_039.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Nuvola_apps_kaboodle.svg/30px-Nuvola_apps_kaboodle.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Nuvola_apps_kaboodle.svg/16px-Nuvola_apps_kaboodle.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["venus","mythology"],["uranus","mythology"],["mercury","mythology"],["mars","mythology"],["giuliano_de'_medici","1453–1478"],["lorenzo_de'_medici","1463–1503"],["giuliano_de'_medici","1453–1478"],["italian_campaign","world_war_ii"],["restoration","art"]],"members":["restoration","uranus","mercury","italian_campaign","mars","venus"],"related":["Tempera","Panel_painting","Renaissance","Sandro_Botticelli","Mythological","Allegory","Neoplatonism","Giorgio_Vasari","Villa_Castello","House_of_Medici","Ovid","Lucretius","Poliziano","Uffizi_Gallery","Florence","Italy","Cupid","Charites","Zephyrus","Chloris","Ovid","Chlorophyll","Venus_(mythology)","Myrtus","Hesiod","Uranus_(mythology)","Charites","Cupid","Mercury_(mythology)","Caduceus","Mars_(mythology)","SmARThistory","Marsilio_Ficino","Pallas_Athena","Centaur","Giuliano_de'_Medici_(1453–1478)","Lorenzo_de'_Medici","Lorenzo_de'_Medici_(1463–1503)","Pope_Clement_VII","Pope","Giuliano_de'_Medici_(1453–1478)","Lorenzo_di_Pierfrancesco_de'_Medici","Simonetta_Vespucci","De_rerum_natura","Italian_Campaign_(World_War_II)","Restoration_(art)"]}
