The bonding between metal and ligand generally involves formal donation\nof one or more of the ligand's electron pairs. The nature of metal-ligand\nbonding can range from covalent to ionic. Furthermore, the metal-ligand bond\norder can range from one to three. Ligands are viewed as Lewis bases, although\nrare cases are known involving Lewis acidic \"ligand.\" {{Cite book\n| isbn = 0-471-19957-5, 9780471199571 pages = 1355 last = Cotton first = Frank\n| Albert coauthors = Geoffrey Wilkinson, Carlos A.

Ligands in\na complex dictate the reactivity of the central atom, including ligand\nsubstitution rates, the reactivity of the ligands themselves, and redox. Ligand\nselection is a critical consideration in many practical areas, including\nbioinorganic and medicinal chemistry, homogeneous catalysis, and environmental\nchemistry.\n\nLigands are classified in many ways: their charge, their size (bulk), the\nidentity of the coordinating atom(s), and the number of electrons donated to\nthe metal (denticity or hapticity). The size of a ligand is indicated by its\ncone angle.\n","linknr":389,"url":"Ligand","recorded":1362512670,"links":44,"instances":["chemist","by_field_strength","ligand","chemistry","chemistry","chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Coordination chemistry","Chemical bonding","Ligands|*"],"headings":["History","Strong field and weak field ligands","Classification of ligands as L and X","Polydentate and polyhapto ligand motifs and nomenclature","Ligand motifs","Specialized ligand types","Common ligands","Ligand exchange","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/41/HCo%28CO%294-3D-balls.png/180px-HCo%28CO%294-3D-balls.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/Metal-EDTA.svg/120px-Metal-EDTA.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/CoA6Cl3.png/120px-CoA6Cl3.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["reactivity","chemistry"],["copper(ii_sulfate"],["chirality","chemistry"],["ligand#examples_of_common_ligands","by_field_strength"],["malcolm_green","chemist"],["resonance","chemistry"],["1,2-bis(diphenylphosphinoethane"],["1,1-bis(diphenylphosphinomethane"],["oxo","ligand"],["tris(2-aminoethylamine"]],"members":["malcolm_green","oxo","resonance","chirality","reactivity"],"related":["Coordination_chemistry","Ion","Molecule","Functional_group","Metal","Coordination_complex","Electron_pair","Covalent_bond","Bond_order","Lewis_acids_and_bases","Lewis_acids_and_bases","Metal","Metalloid","Reactivity_(chemistry)","Redox","Bioinorganic_chemistry","Medicinal_chemistry","Homogeneous_catalysis","Environmental_chemistry","Denticity","Hapticity","Ligand_cone_angle","Coordination_complex","Copper(II)_sulfate","Alfred_Werner","Alfred_Stock","Ammine","Hexol","Chirality_(chemistry)","HOMO/LUMO","HSAB_theory","Aufbau_principle","Hund's_rule","Octahedral","Crystal_field_theory","Spectrochemical_series","Coordination_number","Color","Ground_state","Tanabe-Sugano_diagram","Electron_density","Organometallic_chemistry","Malcolm_Green_(chemist)","Amine","Phosphine","Carbon_monoxide","Alkene","Vaska's_complex","Oxidative_addition","EDTA","Cyclopentadienyl","Κ","Lone_pair","Bite_angle","Ethylenediamine","EDTA","Bite_angle","Denticity","Chelate_effect","Entropy","Heme","Iron","Porphyrin","Dimethylglyoxime","Η","Butadiene","Coordination_sphere","Anionic","Counterion","Coordination_compound","Thiocyanate","Linkage_isomerism","Coordination_polymer","Carbonate","Metal_ligand_multiple_bond","Lone_pair","Bond_order","Bond_angle","Hydroformylation","Resonance_(chemistry)","Halide","Pseudohalide","Ammonia","Carbon_monoxide","Properties_of_water","Alkoxide","Carboxylate","Ether","Thioether","Amine","Phosphine","Cone_angle","Silane","Hydrocarbon","Dihydrogen","Agostic_interaction","Non-innocent_ligand","Ligand","Iodide","Denticity","Bromide","Sulfide","Thiocyanate","Chloride","Nitrate","Azide","Fluoride","Hydroxide","Oxalate","Properties_of_water","Nitrite","Isothiocyanate","Acetonitrile","Pyridine","Ammonia","Ethylenediamine","2,2'-Bipyridine","Phenanthroline","Nitrite","Triphenylphosphine","Cyanide","Carbon_monoxide","Acetylacetone","Alkene","Benzene","1,2-Bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane","1,1-Bis(diphenylphosphino)methane","Corrole","Crown_ether","Cryptand","Cryptate","Cyclopentadienyl_complex","Diethylenetriamine","Dimethylglyoxime","EDTA","EGTA","Glycine","Heme","Nitrosyl","Oxo_(ligand)","Pyrazine","Scorpionate_ligand","Sulfite","Terpyridine","Triazacyclononane","Tricyclohexylphosphine","Triethylenetetramine","Trimethylphosphine","Tris(2-aminoethyl)amine","Terpyridine","Tropylium","Carbon_dioxide","Metal_carbon_dioxide_complex","Chemical_reaction","Ligand_dependent_pathway","Associative_substitution","Dissociative_substitution","Nucleophilic_abstraction","Crystal_field_theory","Ligand_dependent_pathway","Ligand_field_theory","Ligand_isomerism","Coordination_chemistry","Inorganic_chemistry","Tanabe-Sugano_diagram","Spectrochemical_series","Bridging_carbonyl","Josiphos_ligands"]}
