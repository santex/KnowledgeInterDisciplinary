{"cursor":"11598","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n shrub in flower.]] shrubbery in Sheringham Park.]]\n\nA 'shrub' is distinguished from a tree by its multiple stems and shorter height,\nusually under 6 m (20Â ft) tall. Plants of many species may grow either into\nshrubs or trees, depending on their growing conditions. Small, low shrubs,\ngenerally less than 2 m tall, such as lavender, periwinkle and most small garden\nvarieties of roses, are often termed '[[subshrub]]s' or 'bushes'.\n\nAn area of cultivated shrubs in a park or garden is known as a shrubbery. When\nclipped as topiary, suitable species or varieties of shrubs develop dense\nfoliage and many small leafy branches growing close together. Many shrubs\nrespond well to renewal pruning, in which hard cutting back to a 'stool' results\nin long new stems known as \"canes\". Other shrubs respond better to selective\npruning to reveal their structure and character.\n\nShrubs in common garden practice are generally broad-leaved plants, though some\nsmaller conifers such as Mountain Pine and Common Juniper are also shrubby in\nstructure. Species that grow into a shrubby habit may be either deciduous or\nevergreen.\n","linknr":626,"url":"Shrub","recorded":1362480605,"links":83,"instances":["shrub","plant","biology","plant","ecology","plant","genus","plant","plant","shrub"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Plants","Plant morphology","Shrubs|","Lists of plants|Shrub"],"headings":["Shrubs as a botanical structural form","List of shrubs (bushes)","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e0/Cytisus_scoparius2.jpg/250px-Cytisus_scoparius2.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/78/Sheringham_Park_1.JPG/250px-Sheringham_Park_1.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["canopy","biology"],["dominance","ecology"],["broom","shrub"],["daphne","plant"],["dracaena","plant"],["ephedra","genus"],["spindle","shrub"],["broom","shrub"],["hebe","plant"],["hyssopus","plant"],["pieris","plant"]],"members":["broom","hebe","canopy","pieris","dominance","daphne","ephedra","dracaena","hyssopus","spindle"],"related":["Sheringham_Park","Tree","Height","Lavender","Vinca","Rose","Plant_cultivation","Park","Garden","Shrubbery","Topiary","Foliage","Branch","Pruning","Living_stump","Plant_stem","Flowering_plant","Pinophyta","Mountain_Pine","Common_Juniper","Deciduous","Evergreen","Ecology","Canopy_(biology)","Plant_life-form","Australia","Dominance_(ecology)","Species","Abelia","Actinidia","Aloe","Angelica_Tree","Aralia_spinosa","Bearberry","Manzanita","Chokeberry","Sagebrush","Aucuba","Barberry","Bougainvillea","Brugmansia","Buddleja","Buxus","Mescalbean","Beautyberry","Sweetshrub","Camellia","Tea","Pea-tree","Carpenteria","Blue_Spiraea","Moss-heather","Ceanothus","Hardy_Plumbago","Mountain-mahogany","Japanese_Quince","Fernbush","Leatherleaf","Wintersweet","Fringe-tree","Mexican-orange_Blossom","Rockrose","Clerodendrum","Summersweet","Pepperbush","Glory_Pea","Colletia","Bladder_Senna","Sweetfern","Dogwood","Winter-hazel","Cotoneaster","Cliffrose","Crataegus","Crinodendron","Broom_(shrub)","Heath","Alexandrian_Laurel","Daphne_(plant)","Decaisnea","Shrubby_Cinquefoil","Tree_poppy","Desfontainea","Deutzia","Bush_Honeysuckle","Dipelta","Dracaena_(plant)","Winter's_Bark","Mountain_Avens","Paper_Bush","Elaeagnus","Chilean_Firebush","Crowberry","Pagoda_Bush","Ephedra_(genus)","Trailing_Arbutus","Heath","Loquat","Escallonia","Eucryphia","Spindle_(shrub)","Pearl_Bush","Apache_plume","Fatsia","Forsythia","Fothergilla","Franklinia","Flannelbush","Fuchsia","Silk-tassel","Salal","Huckleberry","Broom_(shrub)","Loblolly-bay","Grevillea","Griselinia","Hakea","Silverbell","Rockrose","Witch-hazel","Hebe_(plant)","Hedera","Rockrose","Hibiscus","Sea-buckthorn","Lacebark","Creambush","Hudsonia","Hydrangea","Hypericum_calycinum","Hyssopus_(plant)","Holly","Star_Anise","Indigo_plant","Sweetspire","Cliffbush","Jasmine","Juniper","Mountain-laurel","Beautybush","Crape-myrtle","Copihue","Lantana","Lavender","Tree_Mallow","Ledum","Leitneria","Bush_Clover","Doghobble","Leycesteria","Privet","Spicebush","Twinflower","Honeysuckle","Lupin","Boxthorn","Magnolia","Mahonia","Acerola","Menziesia","Microcachrys","Bayberry","Myricaria","Myrtus","Neillia","Oleander","Daisy_Bush","Osmanthus","Pachysandra","Peony","Russian_Sage","Jerusalem_Sage","Photinia","Ninebark","Pieris_(plant)","Pistachio","Pistacia_lentiscus","Pittosporum","Leadwort","Milkwort","Prunus","Antelope_Bush","Firethorn","Quassia","Oak","Quillay","Tawheowheo","Buckthorn","Rhododendron","Azalea","Sumac","Ribes","Tree_poppy","Rose","Rosemary","Bramble","Rue","Willow","Salvia","Elderberry","Lavender_Cotton","Senecio","Jojoba","Skimmia","Smilax","Kowhai","Sorbaria","Spanish_Broom","Spiraea","Bladdernut","Stephanandra","Snowberry","Lilac","Tamarix","Waratah","Arborvitae","Thyme","Gorse","Turkestan_elm_-_Wonder_Hedge","Mexican_Buckeye","Bilberry","Blueberry","Cranberry","Vervain","Viburnum","Vinca","Mistletoe","Weigela","Yellowroot","Yucca","Yucca_brevifolia","Shrubbery","Shrubland"]}
