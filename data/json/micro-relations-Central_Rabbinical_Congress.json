It is identified with the most conservative wings of Haredi\nJudaism in America.\n\nIn 1953, Rabbi Joel Teitelbaum founded the association.\n\nThe CRC has close relations with the Edah HaChareidis of Jerusalem, and can be\nclosely compared to it, representing the same conservative wings of the Haredi\nworld that the Edah represents in Jerusalem. In the past, both institutions were\nheaded by the Satmar Rebbes, Rabbis Joel Teitelbaum and Moshe Teitelbaum.

[http://www.thejewishweek.com/news/newscontent.php3?artid=11412 The\nJewish Week]\n\nIn 1986 the CRC publicized the following declaration: It is our duty\nto denounce those who invoke the name of the Almighty in vain. It is our holy\nobligation and our moral responsibility to call on them: Stop using these\nfalsehoods and heresies to justify yourselves and your misdeeds. The Jewish\nfaith, as transmitted by the Almighty to our forefathers has not and will never\ncountenance the zionist and nationalistic doctrines of the state of Israel.\nThese false doctrines are compounded of atheism and anti-religious zionism,\nideologies alien to Judaism. Let them not be misrepresented to the world as\nJewish.
