that is, if one ball stops dead after the collision, the other ball\nwill continue away with all the momentum. If the moving ball continues or is\ndeflected then both balls will carry a portion of the momentum from the\ncollision, |unit=kg&nbsp;m/s or N s |symbols='p'}}\n\n\nIn classical mechanics, 'linear momentum' or 'translational momentum' (pl.\nmomenta; SI unit kg&nbsp;m/s, or equivalently, N&nbsp;s) is the product of the\nmass and velocity of an object. For example, a heavy truck moving fast has a\nlarge momentum—it takes a large and prolonged force to get the truck up to this\nspeed, and it takes a large and prolonged force to bring it to a stop\nafterwards. If the truck were lighter, or moving more slowly, then it would have\nless momentum.\n\nLike velocity, linear momentum is a vector quantity, possessing a direction as\nwell as a magnitude:\n:<math>\\mathbf{p} = m \\mathbf{v}.</math>\nLinear momentum is also a conserved quantity, meaning that if a closed system is\nnot affected by external forces, its total linear momentum cannot change. In\nclassical mechanics, conservation of linear momentum is implied by Newton's\nlaws; but it also holds in special relativity (with a modified formula) and,\nwith appropriate definitions, a (generalized) linear momentum conservation law\nholds in electrodynamics, quantum mechanics, quantum field theory, and general\nrelativity.\n","title":"momentum","headings":["Newtonian mechanics","Generalized coordinates","Relativistic mechanics","Classical electromagnetism","Quantum mechanics","Deformable bodies and fluids","History of the concept","See also","Notes","References","Further reading","External links"]},"micro-relation":["4: Kinetic_energy","3: Hamiltonian_mechanics","2: Classical_mechanics","2: Mass","2: Velocity","2: Euclidean_vector","2: Closed_system","2: Quantum_mechanics","2: Galilean_transformation","2: Galilean_invariance","2: Rocket","2: Variable-mass_system","2: Potential_energy","2: Speed_of_light","2: Imaginary_unit","2: Magnetic_field","2: Lorentz_force#Lorentz_force_and_analytical_mechanics","1: Conservation_of_linear_momentum","1: Plural","1: SI","1: Kilogram","1: Meters_per_second","1: Second","1: Newton's_laws","1: Special_relativity","1: Conservation_law","1: Electrodynamics","1: Quantum_field_theory","1: General_relativity","1: Momentum#Multiple_dimensions","1: SI_units","1: Center_of_mass","1: Euler's_laws_of_motion","1: Newton's_second_law","1: Acceleration","1: Newton's_laws_of_motion","1: Collision","1: Theory_of_relativity","1: Classical_electromagnetism","1: Frame_of_reference","1: Center_of_mass_frame","1: Gravity_assist","1: Pool_billiards","1: Stiffness","1: Dissipation","1: Heat","1: Sound","1: Traffic_collisions","1: FranckâHertz_experiment","1: Particle_accelerator","1: Coefficient_of_restitution","1: Explosion","1: Star","1: Cartesian_coordinates","1: Angular_momentum","1: Lagrangian_mechanics","1: EulerâLagrange_equation","1: Symmetry","1: Canonical_conjugate","1: Noether's_theorem","1: Absolute_time_and_space","1: Special_theory_of_relativity","1: Lorentz_transformation","1: Lorentz_factor","1: Invariant_mass","1: Four-vector","1: Proper_time","1: Metric_signature","1: Minkowski_space","1: Scalar_product","1: Covariance_and_contravariance_of_vectors","1: Four-momentum","1: Mass-energy_equivalence","1: Law_of_action_and_reaction","1: Maxwell's_equations","1: Electric_field","1: Vacuum_permeability","1: Poynting_vector","1: Maxwell_stress_tensor","1: Gaussian_units","1: Magnetization","1: Generalized_momentum","1: Electric_potential","1: Vector_potential","1: Relativistic_mechanics","1: Lagrangian","1: Time_derivative","1: Electric_charge","1: Momentum#Electromagnetism","1: Dot_product","1: Electromagnetic_field","1: Commutator","1: Levi-Civita_symbol","1: Wave_function","1: Werner_Heisenberg","1: Uncertainty_principle","1: Conjugate_variables","1: Gradient","1: Reduced_Planck_constant","1: Momentum_space","1: Matter_wave","1: Electromagnetic_radiation","1: Light","1: Ultraviolet","1: Radio_waves","1: Photons","1: Solar_sail","1: Dielectric","1: AbrahamâMinkowski_controversy","1: Fluid_dynamics","1: Solid_mechanics","1: Continuum_mechanics","1: Fluid_parcel","1: Hydrostatic_equilibrium","1: Gravitational_acceleration","1: Pressure","1: Material_derivative","1: Advection","1: Shear_stress","1: Strain_rate","1: Viscosity","1: Flux","1: Incompressible_flow","1: Newtonian_fluid","1: NavierâStokes_equations","1: Cauchy_stress_tensor","1: Cauchy_momentum_equation","1: Body_force","1: Oxford_University_Press","1: Viscosity#Types_of_viscosity","1: Wave","1: Acoustic_wave_equation","1: Speed_of_sound","1: P-wave","1: S-waves","1: John_Philoponus","1: Aristotle","1: Avicenna","1: Air_resistance","1: Aydin_Sayili","1: Peter_Olivi","1: Jean_Buridan","1: Theory_of_impetus","1: RenÃ©_Descartes","1: Galileo","1: Italian_language","1: John_Wallis","1: Crystal_momentum","1: Galilean_cannon","1: Momentum_transfer","1: Planck_momentum"]}
