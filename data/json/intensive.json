Intensives are usually lexical formations, but there may be\na regular process for forming intensives from a root. Intensive formations, for\nexample, existed in Proto-Indo-European, and in many of the Semitic languages.\n\nIn Classical Arabic, Form II (faʿʿal-a) can form intensives, in addition to\ncausatives, while form IV (afʿal-a) forms only causatives. Hebrew has a similar\ndistinction between the pi`el (intensive) and hiph`il (causative) binyans.\n\nLatin had verbal prefixes e- and per- that could be more or less freely added\nonto any verb and variously added such meanings as to put a great deal of effort\ninto doing something: ructa (burp), eructa (belch). When the same prefixes,\nespecially per, were added to adjectives, the resulting meaning was very X or\nextremely X.\n","title":"Intensive%20word%20form","headings":[]},"micro-relation":["1: Proto-Indo-European_language","1: Semitic","1: Classical_Arabic","1: Hebrew_language","1: Binyan","1: Latin"]}
