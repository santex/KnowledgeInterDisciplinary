Although all\nquarks are described in a similar way by the quantum chromodynamics, the bottom\nquark's large bare mass (around , a bit more than four\ntimes the mass of a proton), combined with low values of the CKM matrix elements\nV ub and V cb , gives it a distinctive signature that makes\nit relatively easy to identify experimentally (using a technique called B-\ntagging). Because three generations of quark are required for CP violation (see\nCKM matrix), mesons containing the bottom quark are the easiest particles to use\nto investigate the phenomenon; such experiments are being performed at the BaBar\nand Belle experiments. The bottom quark is also notable because it is a product\nin almost all top quark decays, and would be a frequent decay product for the\nHiggs boson if it is sufficiently light.\n\nThe bottom quark was theorized in 1973 by physicists Makoto Kobayashi and\nToshihide Maskawa to explain CP violation. {{cite journal\n|author=M.
