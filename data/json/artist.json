The common usage in both everyday speech and\nacademic discourse is a practitioner in the visual arts only. The term is often\nused in the entertainment business, especially in a business context, for\nmusicians and other performers (less often for actors). \"Artiste\" (the French\nfor artist) is a variant used in English only in this context. Use of the term\nto describe writers, for example, is certainly valid, but less common, and\nmostly restricted to contexts like criticism.\n",
