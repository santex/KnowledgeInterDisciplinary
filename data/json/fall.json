The actual lag varies with region. Some cultures regard the\nautumnal equinox as \"mid-autumn\", others with a longer lag treat it as the start\nof autumn.<ref></ref> Meteorologists (and most of the temperate countries in the\nsouthern hemisphere)<ref></ref> use a definition based on months, with autumn\nbeing September, October and November in the northern hemisphere,<ref></ref> and\nMarch, April and May in the southern hemisphere.\n\nIn North America, autumn is usually considered to start with the September\nequinox.<ref></ref> In traditional East Asian solar term, autumn starts on or\naround 8 August and ends on about 7 November. In Ireland, the autumn months\naccording to the national meteorological service, Met Éireann, are September,\nOctober and November. <ref name=\"met.ie\"></ref> However, according to the\nIrish Calendar which is based on ancient Gaelic traditions, autumn lasts\nthroughout the months of August, September, and October, or possibly a few\ndays later, depending on tradition. In Australia, autumn officially begins on\n1 March and ends 31 May<ref></ref> According to United States tradition,\nautumn runs from the day after Labor Day (i.e. the Tuesday following the first\nMonday of September) through Thanksgiving (i.e. the fourth Thursday in\nNovember), after which the holiday season that demarcates the unofficial\nbeginning of winter begins.\n","title":"Autumn","headings":["Etymology","Harvest association","Melancholy association","Other associations","Tourism","Paintings","Gallery","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["2: North_America","2: John_Keats","2: Pumpkin","2: Halloween","1: Temperate","1: Season","1: Summer","1: Winter","1: Northern_Hemisphere","1: Southern_Hemisphere","1: Night","1: Equinox","1: Temperate_countries","1: Solar_term","1: Ireland","1: Met_Éireann","1: Irish_Calendar","1: Gaelic_Ireland","1: Labor_Day","1: Christmas_and_holiday_season","1: Old_French","1: Modern_French","1: Latin","1: Shorter_Oxford_English_Dictionary","1: West_Germanic_language","1: Germanic_languages","1: Old_English_language","1: Old_Norse_language","1: Middle_English","1: Abscission","1: British_colonisation_of_the_Americas","1: Harvest","1: Harvest_festival","1: Thanksgiving","1: Sukkot","1: Moon_festival","1: Apple","1: Apple_cider","1: Melancholy","1: William_Butler_Yeats","1: Paul_Verlaine","1: Samhain","1: Microsoft_Encarta","1: American_football","1: Canadian_football","1: National_Football_League","1: College_football","1: Baseball","1: World_Series","1: Major_League_Baseball","1: Midseason_replacement","1: Nielsen_Ratings","1: First_day_of_school","1: Saraswati","1: Autumn_leaf_color","1: Deciduous","1: Foliage","1: Eastern_Asia","1: Korea","1: Europe","1: South_Island","1: Canada","1: New_England","1: Frederic_Edwin_Church","1: Museo_Thyssen-Bornemisza","1: John_Everett_Millais","1: Qian_Xuan","1: Giuseppe_Arcimboldo","1: Cherry","1: Oak","1: Vitosha","1: Maple"]}
