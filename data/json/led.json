are increasingly used for other lighting. Appearing\n as practical electronic components in 1962,<ref name=LemelsonMIT/> early LEDs\n emitted low-intensity red light, but modern versions are available across the\n visible, ultraviolet, and infrared wavelengths, with very high brightness.\n\nWhen a light-emitting diode is switched on, electrons are able to recombine with\nholes within the device, releasing energy in the form of photons. This effect is\ncalled electroluminescence and the color of the light (corresponding to the\nenergy of the photon) is determined by the energy band gap of the semiconductor.\nAn LED is often small in area (less than 1&nbsp;mm<sup>2</sup>), and integrated\noptical components may be used to shape its radiation pattern.<ref></ref> LEDs\npresent many advantages over incandescent light sources including lower energy\nconsumption, longer lifetime, improved physical robustness, smaller size, and\nfaster switching. However, LEDs powerful enough for room lighting are relatively\nexpensive and require more precise current and heat management than compact\nfluorescent lamp sources of comparable output.\n\nLight-emitting diodes are used in applications as diverse as aviation lighting,\ndigital microscopes, automotive lighting, advertising, general lighting, and\ntraffic signals. LEDs have allowed new text, video displays, and sensors to be\ndeveloped, while their high switching rates are also useful in advanced\ncommunications technology. Infrared LEDs are also used in the remote control\nunits of many commercial products including televisions, DVD players and other\ndomestic appliances. LEDs are also used in seven-segment display.\n","title":"Light-emitting%20diode","headings":["History","Technology","Colors and materials","Types","Considerations for use","Applications","See
