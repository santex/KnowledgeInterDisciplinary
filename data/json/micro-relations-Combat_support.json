{"cursor":"2396","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nIn the United States Army, the term 'combat support' refers to units that\nprovide fire support and operational assistance to combat elements. Combat\nsupport units provide specialized support functions to combat units in the areas\nof chemical warfare, combat engineering, intelligence, security, and\ncommunications.\n\nCombat support should not be confused with combat service support, which are\nunits which primarily provide logistical support by providing supply,\nmaintenance, transportation, health services, and other services required by the\nsoldiers of combat units to continue their missions in combat. Expressed another\nway, Combat Support units are focused on providing operational support to combat\nunits, while Combat Service Support units are focused on providing logistical\nsupport to combat units. Actual combat units are collectively referred to as\ncombat arms units; hence, all army units fall into the category of either combat\narms, combat support, or combat service support.\n\nWithin the U.S. Army, the combat support branches are the:\n\n* Chemical Corps\n* Corps of Engineers (i.e., General (not Combat) Engineering units)\n* Military Intelligence Corps\n* Military Police Corps\n* Signal Corps\n* Army Aviation (e.g., Battlefield Reconnaissance, Signals Intelligence, and\n  Assault Helicopter units)\n","linknr":118,"url":"Combat_support","recorded":1362535192,"links":23,"instances":["not_combat_engineering","united_states_army"],"pdf":[],"categories":["United States Army","Military tactics"],"headings":["Branch insignia","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Ambox_globe_content.svg/48px-Ambox_globe_content.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Chemical_Branch_Insignia.svg/160px-Chemical_Branch_Insignia.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8d/MI_Corps_Insignia.svg/132px-MI_Corps_Insignia.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/64/USAMPC-Branch-Insignia.png/160px-USAMPC-Branch-Insignia.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/Insignia_signal.svg/160px-Insignia_signal.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["general","not_combat_engineering"],["signal_corps","united_states_army"]],"members":["general","signal_corps"],"related":["United_States_Army","Combat_service_support","U.S._Army_Combat_Arms_Regimental_System","Chemical_Corps","United_States_Army_Corps_of_Engineers","General_(not_Combat)_Engineering","Military_Intelligence_Corps","United_States_Army_Military_Police_Corps","United_States_Army_Signal_Corps","Army_Aviation","United_States_Army_branch_insignia","Chemical_Corps","United_States_Army_branch_insignia","Military_Intelligence_Corps","United_States_Army_branch_insignia","United_States_Army_Military_Police_Corps","United_States_Army_branch_insignia","Signal_Corps_(United_States_Army)","Combat_Arms","Combat_service_support"]}
