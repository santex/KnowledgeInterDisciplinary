{"cursor":"3338","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n was a Japanese Christian pastor, theologian and critic of Meiji and\n TaishÅ periods.\n\nUemura was the eldest son of Tojuiro and Tei, of the family of hatamoto (rank of\nsamurai). His birth name was MichitarÅ. Though his family was wealthy, they fell\ninto bankruptcy at the time of the Meiji Restoration. He came into contact with\nChristianity when he went to Tokyo to study at Shubunkan and the preparatory\nschool run by James Hamilton Ballagh. In June, 1873 he was baptized at the\nYokohama Public Church by Ballagh. His parents and younger brothers were also\nbaptized later. Soon he decided to become an evangelist, studying at Brown\nPreparatory School and Icchi Shin Gakko (United Seminary). He was ordained in\n1880 and became the pastor of Shitaya (Toshimagaoka) church. In 1887 he\nestablished the church that would later become Fujimicho Church and served as\npastor there for the rest of his life. As an evangelist, his work included: 1.\nforming evangelical churches; 2. building up an acceptance of a theological way\nof thinking and the related training of evangelists; and 3. participation in\nwritten campaigns opposing many movements in Japanese society (especially the\nRescript on Education of 1890).\n\nIn a life of faith that began in the Public Church and moved to the Japan\nPresbyterian Church, he provided directional leadership to bring the Christian\nchurches together and help them become self-supporting and independent, based on\nan evangelical faith (Jesus as the Son of God incarnate, offering redemption\nthrough his death on the cross; the resurrection and ascension). Defying the\ninfluence of theological liberalism, he, as a professor at Meiji Gakuin, worked\nto solidify a faith with the above doctrine as its core. In addition,as one of\nthe founders of Tokyo Shingakusha (seminary), he took on the responsibility of\nthe theological education and training of evangelists. Through his own\npublications, such as Nihon-hyÅron (Japanese Criticism), Fukuin-shÅ«hÅ (The\nEvangelical Weekly) and others, he engaged in a wide range of literary criticism\non such subjects as politics, society, education and religion. His contributions\nin the areas of Bible translation (into Japanese), hymn editing, literary\ncriticism, and English literature are also of note. His health was greatly\ndamaged because of the strenuous effort he put into the reconstruction of\nFujimicho Church and Tokyo Shingakusha after they were devastated by the Great\nEarthquake of 1923. He died suddenly at his home in Kashiwagi, Tokyo. taken\nfrom Dictionary of Asian Christianity edited by Scott W. Sunquist.
