{"cursor":"11307","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Gang Resistance Education And Training', abbreviated 'G.R.E.A.T.', provides a\nschool-based, police officer instructed program that includes classroom\ninstruction and various learning activities, the use of law enforcement officers\nhaving several advantages. They have a wide range of experience in recognizing\nand combatting criminal behaviour, they have the ability to recognize gang\nmembers, they are equipped with a referral knowledge, and most importantly can\nbe a positive role model to students.\n\nThe instruction of life skills is the foundation of the program. In accordance\nwith a study by Dr. Esbensen in 2000, delinquency often serves as a precursor to\ngang involvement, the GREAT program the focuses on providing life skills to\nstudents to help them avoid delinquent behavior and resorting to violence to\nsolve problems. Communities need not have a gang problem in order to benefit\nfrom the program as its primary objective is prevention and is intended as an\nimmunization against delinquency, youth violence, and gang membership.\n\nThe program was originally administered by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and\nFirearms of the US Department of the Treasury, however, when the ATF was\ntransferred to the United States Department of Justice, it became administered\nby the Office of Justice Programs of the Bureau of Justice Assistance.\n","linknr":108,"url":"Gang_Resistance_Education_and_Training","recorded":1363471496,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Gang_Resistance_Education_and_Training&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Gang_Resistance_Education_and_Training&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/Police_officer","/wiki/Life_skills","/wiki/Bureau_of_Alcohol,_Tobacco_and_Firearms","/wiki/United_States_Department_of_the_Treasury","/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice","/wiki/Office_of_Justice_Programs","/wiki/Bureau_of_Justice_Assistance","#History","#The_Goal","#The_Curriculum","#Officer_Selection","#Recent_Program_Evaluation","#See_also","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Gang_Resistance_Education_and_Training&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona","/wiki/Arizona","/wiki/National_Institute_of_Justice","/w/index.php?title=Gang_Resistance_Education_and_Training&action=edit&section=2","#cite_note-1","/w/index.php?title=Gang_Resistance_Education_and_Training&action=edit&section=3","#cite_note-2","/w/index.php?title=Gang_Resistance_Education_and_Training&action=edit&section=4","#cite_note-3","/w/index.php?title=Gang_Resistance_Education_and_Training&action=edit&section=5","http://www.nationalgangcenter.gov/Content/Documents/GREAT-Evaluation-Draft-Dec-2010.pdf","#cite_note-4","/w/index.php?title=Gang_Resistance_Education_and_Training&action=edit&section=6","/wiki/Drug_Abuse_Resistance_Education","/w/index.php?title=Gang_Resistance_Education_and_Training&action=edit&section=7","#cite_ref-1","http://www.great-online.org","#cite_ref-2","http://www.great-online.org","#cite_ref-3","http://www.great-online.org","#cite_ref-4","http://www.nationalgangcenter.gov/Content/Documents/GREAT-Evaluation-Draft-Dec-2010.pdf","/w/index.php?title=Gang_Resistance_Education_and_Training&action=edit&section=8","http://www.great-online.org","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gang_Resistance_Education_and_Training&oldid=438558611","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Education_in_the_United_States","/wiki/Category:Law_enforcement_in_the_United_States","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Gang+Resistance+Education+and+Training&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Gang+Resistance+Education+and+Training","/wiki/Gang_Resistance_Education_and_Training","/wiki/Talk:Gang_Resistance_Education_and_Training","#","/wiki/Gang_Resistance_Education_and_Training","/w/index.php?title=Gang_Resistance_Education_and_Training&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Gang_Resistance_Education_and_Training&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Gang_Resistance_Education_and_Training","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Gang_Resistance_Education_and_Training","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Gang_Resistance_Education_and_Training&oldid=438558611","/w/index.php?title=Gang_Resistance_Education_and_Training&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Gang_Resistance_Education_and_Training&id=438558611","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Gang+Resistance+Education+and+Training","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Gang+Resistance+Education+and+Training&oldid=438558611&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Gang_Resistance_Education_and_Training&printable=yes","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikiped
