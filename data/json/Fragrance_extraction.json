{"cursor":"11092","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n, France for steam distillation]] 'Fragrance extraction' refers to the\nextraction of aromatic compounds from raw materials, using methods such as\ndistillation, solvent extraction, expression, or enfleurage. The results of the\nextracts are either essential oils, absolutes, concretes, or butters, depending\non the amount of waxes in the extracted product.\n\nTo a certain extent, all of these techniques tend to distort the odour of the\naromatic compounds obtained from the raw materials. Heat, chemical solvents, or\nexposure to oxygen in the extraction process denature the aromatic compounds,\neither changing their odour character or rendering them odourless.\n","linknr":181,"url":"Fragrance_extraction","recorded":1362669760,"links":13,"instances":["substance","fruit","chemistry","physics","extraction","biochemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Oils","Essential oils|","Aromatherapy","Perfumery","Flavor technology"],"headings":["Maceration/Solvent extraction","Distillation","Expression","Enfleurage","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/95/Fragonard_small_perfume_distillery.JPG/250px-Fragonard_small_perfume_distillery.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["absolute","substance"],["concrete","extraction"],["denaturation","biochemistry"],["sublimation","physics"],["critical_point","chemistry"],["absolute","substance"],["peel","fruit"],["denaturation","biochemistry"]],"members":["absolute","peel","critical_point","sublimation","concrete","denaturation"],"related":["Distillation","Solvent_extraction","Expression","Enfleurage","Essential_oil","Absolute_(substance)","Concrete_(extraction)","Wax","Aromatic","Hexane","Dimethyl_ether","Wax","Pigment","Denaturation_(biochemistry)","Lipophilic","Ethanol","Scent","Supercritical_carbon_dioxide","Carbon_dioxide","Supercritical_fluid","Sublimation_(physics)","Non-polar","Hydrophobic","Decaffeinated","Coffee","Critical_point_(chemistry)","Carbon_dioxide","Atmospheric_pressure","Alcohol","Aldehyde","Absolute_(substance)","Plant","Orange_blossom","Rose","Condensation","Flower","Leaf","Wood","Bark","Root","Seed","Peel_(fruit)","Alembic","Water","Florentine_flask","Hydrosol","Flower","Leaf","Plant_stem","Ylang-ylang","Cananga_odorata","Fractional_distillation","Pyrolysis","Amber","Wood","Birch","Fractionation_column","By-product","Distillation","Egypt","Nymphaeaceae","Tutankhamen","Alabaster","Ethanol","Enfleurage","Distillation","Denaturation_(biochemistry)","Enfleurage","Essential_oil","Perfume","Rose_oil"]}
