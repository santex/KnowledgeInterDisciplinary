An example of 19th-century greenhouse architecture]]\n\nA 'greenhouse' (also called a 'glasshouse') is a building in which plants are\ngrown. These structures range in size from small sheds to industrial-sized\nbuildings. A miniature greenhouse is known as a cold frame.\n\nA greenhouse is a structural building with different types of covering\nmaterials, such as a glass or plastic roof and frequently glass or plastic\nwalls; it heats up because incoming visible solar radiation (for which the glass\nis transparent) from the sun is absorbed by plants, soil, and other things\ninside the building. Air warmed by the heat from hot interior surfaces is\nretained in the building by the roof and wall. In addition, the warmed\nstructures and plants inside the greenhouse re-radiate some of their thermal\nenergy in the infrared spectrum, to which glass is partly opaque, so some of\nthis energy is also trapped inside the glasshouse. However, this latter process\nis a minor player compared with the former (convective) process. Thus, the\nprimary heating mechanism of a greenhouse is convection. This can be\ndemonstrated by opening a small window near the roof of a greenhouse: the\ntemperature drops considerably. This principle is the basis of the autovent\nautomatic cooling system. Thus, the glass used for a greenhouse works as a\nbarrier to air flow, and its effect is to trap energy within the greenhouse. The\nair that is warmed near the ground is prevented from rising indefinitely and\nflowing away.\n\nAlthough heat loss due to thermal conduction through the glass and other\nbuilding materials occurs, net energy (and therefore temperature) increases\ninside the greenhouse.\n","linknr":474,"url":"Greenhouse","recorded":1362373098,"links":79,"instances":["animal","architecture","stes","munich","greenhouse","mineral"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Greenhouses|","Agricultural
