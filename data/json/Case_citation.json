{"cursor":"60696","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":":.}}\n\n is the official reporter of the Supreme Court of the United States.]] 'Case\n citation' is the system used in many countries to identify the decisions in\n past court cases, either in special series of books called reporters or law\n reports, or in a 'neutral' form which will identify a decision wherever it was\n reported. Although case citations are formatted differently in different\n jurisdictions, they generally contain the same key information.\n\nA citation is: \"A reference to a legal precedent or authority, such as a case,\nstatute, or treatise, that either substantiates or contradicts a given position. Where cases are\npublished in paper form the citation will usually contain:\n* the title of the reports;\n* the volume number;\n* page number; and\n* year of decision.\n\nIn some report series, for example in England and Australia, the volumes are not\nnumbered independently of the year: thus the year and volume number (usually no\ngreater than 4) are required to identify which book of the series has the case\nreported within its covers. In citations of this type it is usual in these\njurisdictions for square brackets \"[year]\" to be applied to the year (which may\nnot be the year that the case was decided: for example, a case decided in\nDecember 2001 may have been reported in 2002).\n\nThe Internet brought with it the opportunity for courts to publish their\ndecisions on web sites. Decisions of many courts from all over the world can now\nbe found through the website WorldLII and its member\ninstitutes. [http://www.worldlii.org World Legal Information Institute (WorldLII) ]\n\nMost decisions of courts are not published in printed law reports. The expense\nof typesetting and publishing them has limited the printed law reports to\nsignificant cases. Internet publishing of court decisions resulted in a flood of\ninformation. The result was that a medium-neutral citation system had to be\nadopted. This usually contains the following information:\n* year of decision\n* the abbreviated title of the court; and\n* the decision number (not the court file number) Rather than utilizing page\n  numbers for pin-point references, which would depend upon particular printers\n  and browsers, pin-point quotes refer to paragraph numbers.\n","linknr":431,"url":"Case_citation","recorded":1362539391,"links":20,"instances":["sentencing","court","legal_system","law","statesman"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Case law|Citation","Legal citation","Legal research"],"headings":["Australia","Canada","Germany","India","New Zealand","Norway","The Philippines","United Kingdom","United States","See also","External links","Notes","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e2/Unitedstatesreports.jpg/250px-Unitedstatesreports.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/All_India_Reporter.jpg/220px-All_India_Reporter.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["reporter","law"],["civil_law","legal_system"],["criminal_appeal_reports","sentencing"],["reporter","law"],["alexander_j._dallas","statesman"],["docket","court"]],"members":["criminal_appeal_reports","docket","civil_law","reporter"],"related":["Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States","Court_case","Reporter_(law)","Law_report","Jurisdiction","England","Australia","Bracket","WorldLII","Non-publication","Australian_Guide_to_Legal_Citation","Melbourne_University_Law_Review","High_Court_of_Australia","Federal_Court_of_Australia","Family_Court_of_Australia","Federal_Magistrates_Court_of_Australia","Federal_Magistrates_Court_of_Australia","Administrative_Appeals_Tribunal","Supreme_Court_of_New_South_Wales","New_South_Wales_Court_of_Appeal","McGill_Guide","Reference_question","Canadian_Judicial_Council","Supreme_Court_of_Canada","Federal_Court_of_Canada","Tax_Court_of_Canada","Court_Martial_Appeal_Court_of_Canada","Federal_Constitutional_Court_of_Germany","Federal_Court_of_Justice_of_Germany","Penal_law","Private_law","Bundessozialgericht","Federal_Finance_Court_of_Germany","Federal_Labor_Court_of_Germany","Federal_Administrative_Court_of_Germany","New_Zealand_Court_of_Appeal","Supreme_Court_of_New_Zealand","Supreme_Court_of_New_Zealand","New_Zealand_Court_of_Appeal","Supreme_Court_of_Norway","Civil_law_(legal_system)","Supreme_Court_of_the_Philippines","Supreme_Court_of_the_Philippines","Philippine_Court_of_Appeals","England_and_Wales","England_and_Wales","Judicial_review","Law_Reports","All_England_Law_Reports","Cox's_Criminal_Cases","Criminal_Appeal_Reports","Archbold_Criminal_Pleading,_Evidence_and_Practice","Criminal_Appeal_Reports_(Sentencing)","The_Independent","Archbold_Criminal_Pleading,_Evidence_and_Practice","Solicitors_Journal","The_Times","Weekly_Law_Reports","Archbold_Criminal_Pleading,_Evidence_and_Practice","English_Reports","Revised_Reports","All_England_Law_Reports_Reprint","Nominate_reports","Scotland","CSIH","Plaintiff","Appellant","Petitioner","Supreme_court","Defendant","Appellee","Respondent","Petitioner","Respondent","Plaintiff","Defendant","Appellant","Appellee","Reporter_(law)","Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States","Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States","Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States_Reporter_of_Decisions","William_Cranch","William_Cranch","Alexander_J._Dallas_(statesman)","Henry_Wheaton","Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States_Reporter_of_Decisions","United_States_court_of_appeals","United_States_district_court","Thomson_West","D.C._Circuit","United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Third_Circuit","U.S._District_Court_for_the_Middle_District_of_Alabama","California_Supreme_Court","New_York_Court_of_Appeals","Illinois_Appellate_Court","Illinois_Supreme_Court","Thomson_West","California","Illinois","New_York","South_Dakota","Virginia_Court_of_Appeals","Florida_Supreme_Court","New_York_Court_of_Appeals","California","New_York","Product_liability","Reporter_of_decisions","Theron_Metcalf","George_Caines","Delaware","California_Court_of_Appeal","Precedent","U.S._District_Court_for_the_Southern_District_of_New_York","LexisNexis","Westlaw","Docket_(court)","U.S._Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Eighth_Circuit","U.S._District_Court_for_the_District_of_Connecticut","Kentucky","Federal_Rules_of_Appellate_Procedure","West_Publishing","U.S._Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Sixth_Circuit","Bryan_Garner","Stephen_Breyer","Richard_Posner","Public_domain","Bluebook","Law_review","Law_school","Westlaw","LexisNexis","Oxford_Standard_for_Citation_Of_Legal_Authorities","OSCOLA","Bluebook","Citator","German_legal_citation","Law_report","Legal_research"]}
