{"cursor":"19530","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Digital identity' is a psychological identity that prevails in the domains of\ncyberspace, and is defined as a set of data that uniquely describes a person or\na thing (sometimes referred to as subject or entity) and contains information\nabout the subject's relationships to other entities. The\nsocial identity that an internet user establishes through digital identities in\ncyberspace is referred to as online identity.\n\nA critical problem in cyberspace is knowing with whom you are interacting. In\nessence, the problem is that \"on the Internet, nobody knows you're a dog.\"\nCurrently there are no ways to precisely determine the identity of a person in\ndigital space. Even though there are attributes associated to a person's digital\nidentity, these attributes or even identities can be changed, masked or dumped\nand new ones created. Despite the fact that there are many authentication\nsystems and digital identifiers that try to address these problems, there is\nstill a need for a unified and verified identification system in cyberspace. Thus, there are issues of privacy and security related to\ndigital identity.\n","linknr":246,"url":"Digital_identity","recorded":1362902343,"links":20,"instances":["computer_science","organization","social_science"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Identity management","Identity","Digital technology","Federated identity","Computer access control"],"headings":["Related terms","Technical aspects","Security issues and privacy","Legal issues","Business aspects","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["identity","social_science"],["oasis","organization"],["ontology","computer_science"]],"members":["ontology","oasis","identity"],"related":["Identity_(social_science)","Cyberspace","Online_identity","On_the_Internet,_nobody_knows_you're_a_dog","Authentication","Privacy","Entity","Identity_attributes","Contextual_identity","Authentication","Bank_credit_card","Password","Encryption","Iris_scan","Handprinting","Voiceprint","Identity_theft","Biometrics","Domain_name","E-mail_address","Uniform_Resource_Identifier","Internationalized_Resource_Identifier","World_Wide_Web","OpenID","Light-Weight_Identity","Handle_System","Namespace","Distributed_computing","OASIS_(organization)","XRI","OpenID","I-name","Human_rights","Juristic_person","Ontology_(computer_science)","Cat","Animal","XML","Cultural_relativism","Folksonomy","Identity_entity","Blogosphere","Driver_and_Vehicle_Licensing_Agency","Privacy","Lightweight_Directory_Access_Protocol","X.500","IETF","International_Organization_for_Standardization","Identity_management","Identity_Assurance_Framework","Privacy","Pseudonymity","Identity_Cards_Act","Digital_footprint","E-Authentication","Federated_identity","Global_Trust_Center","Global_Trust_Council","Identity_2.0","Informational_self-determination","Quantum_cryptography","Social_map"]}
