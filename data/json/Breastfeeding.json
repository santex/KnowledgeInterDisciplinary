{"cursor":"132910","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":":''\"Suckling\" and \"nursing\" are synonyms. For other uses, see Nursing\n:(disambiguation) and Suckling (disambiguation)\n\n\n]]\n\n'Breastfeeding' is the feeding of an infant or young child with breast milk\ndirectly from female human breasts (i.e., via lactation) rather than from a baby\nbottle or other container. Babies have a sucking reflex that enables them to\nsuck and swallow milk. Many specialists recommend mothers exclusively breastfeed\nfor six months or more, without the addition of infant formula or solid food.\nThere are conflicting views about how long exclusive breastfeeding remains\nbeneficial to both mother and child.\n\nBreastfeeding was the rule in ancient times up to recent human history, and\nbabies were carried with the mother and fed as required. With 18th and 19th\ncentury industrialization in the Western world, mothers in many urban centers\nbegan despensing with breastfeeding due to work requirement in urban Europe.\nBreastfeeding declined significantly from 1900 to 1960, due to improved\nsanitation, nutritional technologies, and increasingly negative social attitudes\ntowards the practice. By the 1950s, the predominant attitude to\nbreastfeeding was that it was something practiced by the uneducated and those\nlacking temperment of lower classes. The practice was considered old-fashioned\nand \"a little disgusting\", left for those who could not afford infant formula\nand discouraged by medical practioners and media of the time. In\nfact, letters and editorials to the women's magazine Chatelaine from 1945 to as\nlate as 1995, regarded breastfeeding with a predominately negative attitude. However, since the middle 1960s there has been a steady resurgence\nin the practice of breastfeeding in Canada and the US, especially among more\neducated, affluent women.\n\nUnder modern heath care, human breast milk is considered the healthiest form of\nmilk for babies. Breastfeeding promotes health\nand helps to prevent disease. Experts agree that breastfeeding is beneficial and have\nconcerns about the effects of artificial formulas. Artificial feeding is\nassociated with more deaths from diarrhea in infants in both developing and\ndeveloped countries. There are few exceptions, such as\nwhen the mother is taking certain drugs or is infected with human T-lymphotropic\nvirus, or has active untreated tuberculosis. In developed countries with access\nto infant formula and clean drinking water, maternal HIV infection is an\nabsolute contraindication to breastfeeding (regardless of maternal HIV viral\nload or antiretroviral treatment) due to the risk for mother-to-child HIV\ntransmission.\n\nAfter the addition of solid food, mothers are advised to continue breastfeeding\nfor at least a year. The World Health Organization recommends nursing for at\nleast two years or more. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the American\nAcademy of Pediatrics (AAP) emphasize the value of breastfeeding for mothers as\nwell as children. Both recommend exclusive breastfeeding for the first six\nmonths of life. The AAP recommends that this be followed by supplemented\nbreastfeeding for at least one year, while WHO recommends that supplemented\nbreastfeeding continue two years or more.

artificial\nfeeding.\n","linknr":1749,"url":"Breastfeeding","recorded":1362372085,"links":107,"instances":["disambiguation","magazine","disambiguation"],"pdf":["http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2003/9241562218.pdf","http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2003/9241562218.pdf","http://www.ahrq.gov/downloads/pub/evidence/pdf/brfout/brfout.pdf","http://www.ahrq.gov/downloads/pub/evidence/pdf/brfout/brfout.pdf","http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2007/9789241595230_eng.pdf","http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2007/9789241595230_eng.pdf","http://apps.who.int/rhl/reviews/CD003519.pdf","http://pcij.org/blog/wp-docs/ao2006-0012.pdf","http://www.who.int/nutrition/databases/infantfeeding/countries/phl.pdf","http://congress.gov.ph/download/basic_15/HB00714.pdf","http://congress.gov.ph/download/basic_15/HB00714.pdf","http://surgeongeneral.gov/topics/breastfeeding/calltoactiontosupportbreastfeeding.pdf","http://www.womenshealth.gov/breastfeeding/SG_081508.pdf","http://www.womenshealth.gov/breastfeeding/SG_081508.pdf","http://www.bfmed.org/Resources/Download.aspx?filename=Protocol_11.pdf","http://www.surgeongeneral.gov/library/calls/breastfeeding/calltoactiontosupportbreastfeeding.pdf"],"categories":["Babycare","Breastfeeding|","Children's
