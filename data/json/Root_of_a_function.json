For example, consider the function Æ defined\nby the formula\n: f(x)=x^2-6x+9 \\,.\nÆ has a root at 3 since\n: f(3) = 3^2 - 6 \\cdot 3 + 9 = 0.\\ \n\nIf the function maps real numbers to real numbers, its zeros are the x-\ncoordinates of the points where its graph meets the ''x''-axis. An alternative\nname for such a point (x,0) in this context is an 'x-intercept'.\n\nThe concept of complex numbers was developed to handle the roots of cubic\nequations with negative discriminants (that is, those leading to expressions\ninvolving the square root of negative numbers). Complex numbers also occur as\nzeros of quadratic equations with negative discriminants.\n\nThe Riemann hypothesis, one of the most important unsolved problems in\nmathematics, concerns the location of the zeros of the Riemann zeta function.\n","linknr":155,"url":"Root_of_a_function","recorded":1362477267,"links":44,"instances":["mathematics","complex_analysis","mathematics","mathematics","complex_analysis"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Elementary mathematics","Functions and mappings","Zero"],"headings":["Computing roots","Polynomial roots","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/X-intercepts.svg/300px-X-intercepts.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6b/Magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/9/d/d/9dd4e461268c8034f5c8564e155c67a6.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/9/d/d/9dd4e461268c8034f5c8564e155c67a6.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/9/d/d/9dd4e461268c8034f5c8564e155c67a6.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/c/f/2/cf2a0cf2bbfaeadd8ba90f9013da2fc5.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/a/b/a/aba886f887a6a69509b3bb79a8d3f488.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/d/e/8/de8b5561bb4123fa701bc3c84468c025.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["function","mathematics"],["domain","mathematics"],["degree","mathematics"],["multiplicity","mathematics#multiplicity_of_a_root_of_a_polynomial"],["zero","complex_analysis"],["pole","complex_analysis"]],"members":["domain","pole","degree","function","multiplicity","zero"],"related":["Mathematics","Function_(mathematics)","Domain_(mathematics)","Real_number","Graph_of_a_function","X-axis","Complex_number","Cubic_equation","Discriminant","Negative_number","Riemann_hypothesis","Unsolved_problems_in_mathematics","Riemann_zeta_function","Polynomial_function","Approximation","Newton's_method","Degree_(mathematics)","Fundamental_theorem_of_algebra","Complex_conjugate","Vieta's_formulas","Zero_(complex_analysis)","Pole_(complex_analysis)","Sendov's_conjecture","Marden's_theorem"]}
