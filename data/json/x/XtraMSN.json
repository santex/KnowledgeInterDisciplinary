It was a joint venture between Yahoo!7 and Telecom New Zealand. Yahoo!7\nheld a 51 percent stake in the company and Telecom NZ held 49 percent. Because\nYahoo!7 is a 50/50 venture, Yahoo! proper was therefore a 25.5% owner of\nYahoo!Xtra. Telecom announced in April 2011 that it had sold its share to\nYahoo!7 and Yahoo!Xtra was rebranded as Yahoo!
