{"cursor":"30849","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Xist' (X-inactive specific transcript) is an RNA gene on the X chromosome of\nthe placental mammals that acts as major effector of the X inactivation\nprocess. It is a component of the ''Xic'' - X-\nchromosome inactivation centre - along with two other RNA genes\n([[Jpx (gene)|Jpx]] and [[Ftx (gene)|Ftx]]) and two protein genes (Tsx and\nCnbp2). The Xist RNA, a large (17 kb in humans) transcript, is expressed on the inactive chromosome\nand not on the active one. It is processed in a similar way to mRNAs, through\nsplicing and polyadenylation. However, it remains untranslated. It has been\nsuggested that this RNA gene evolved at least partly from a protein coding gene\nthat became a pseudogene. The inactive X chromosome is\ncoated with this transcript, which is essential for the inactivation.\nX chromosomes lacking Xist will not be inactivated, while duplication of the\nXist gene on another chromosome causes inactivation of that\nchromosome.\n","linknr":493,"url":"XIST_(gene)","recorded":1362374356,"links":14,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Non-coding RNA"],"headings":["Function","Gene location","Transcript Organization","X Inactivation Center (XIC)","Regulation factors of the Xist promoter","Dosage compensation","X inactivation cycle","Disease linkage","Interactions","See also","References","External links","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/22/Journal.pbio.1000276.g005.png/300px-Journal.pbio.1000276.g005.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Non-coding_RNA","X_chromosome","Eutheria","X_inactivation","Gene","RNA_splicing","Polyadenylation","Pseudogene","X-inactivation","Developmental_biology","X_chromosome","Dosage_compensation","Gene_expression","Alternative_splicing","Protein","Cell_nucleus","Epigenetics","Stem-loop","Cis-regulatory_element","Chromatin","Transcription_factor","Protein-protein_interaction","BRCA1","X-inactivation","Dosage_compensation","Tsix"]}
