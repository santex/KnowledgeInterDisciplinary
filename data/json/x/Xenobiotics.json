It can also cover substances\nwhich are present in much higher concentrations than are usual. Specifically,\ndrugs such as antibiotics are xenobiotics in humans because the human body does\nnot produce them itself, nor are they part of a normal diet.\n\nNatural compounds can also become xenobiotics if they are taken up by another\norganism, such as the uptake of natural human hormones by fish found downstream\nof sewage treatment plant outfalls, or the chemical defenses produced by some\norganisms as protection against predators.\n\nHowever, the term 'xenobiotics' is very often used in the context of pollutants\nsuch as dioxins and polychlorinated biphenyls and their effect on the biota,\nbecause xenobiotics are understood as substances foreign to an entire biological\nsystem, i.e. artificial substances, which did not exist in nature before their\nsynthesis by humans. The term xenobiotic is derived from the Greek words Î¾Î­Î½Î¿Ï\n(xenos) = foreigner, stranger and Î²Î¯Î¿Ï (bios, vios) = life, plus the Greek\nsuffix for adjectives -ÏÎ¹ÎºÏÏ, -Î®, -Ï (tic).\n","linknr":147,"url":"Xenobiotics","recorded":1362508984,"links":31,"instances":["anatomy","ecology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Microbiology terms"],"headings":["Xenobiotic metabolism","Xenobiotics in the environment","Inter-species organ transplantation","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["biota","ecology"],["organ","anatomy"]],"members":["organ","biota"],"related":["Chemical","Organism","Chemical_substance","Concentration","Medication","Antibiotic","Predator","Pollutant","Polychlorinated_dibenzodioxins","Polychlorinated_biphenyl","Biota_(ecology)","Cytochrome_P450","Evolution","Co-evolution","Tetrodotoxin","Rough-skinned_newt","Common_Garter_Snake","Evolutionary_arms_race","Ion_channel","Sewage_Treatment","Antibiotic","Natural_monopoly","Organochloride","Organ_(anatomy)","Organ_transplant","Species","Heart","Pig","Kidney","Immune"]}
