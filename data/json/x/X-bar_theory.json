{"cursor":"10984","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'X-bar theory' is a component of linguistic theory which attempts to identify\nsyntactic features presumably common to all those human languages that fit in a\npresupposed (1965) framework. The framework is described by J. Katz, P.\nPostal (1964), and Chomsky (1965). It claims that among their phrasal\ncategories, all those languages share certain structural similarities, including\none known as the \"X-bar\", which does not appear in traditional phrase structure\nrules for English or other natural languages. X-bar theory was first proposed by\nNoam Chomsky (1970) Chomsky, Noam (1970). Remarks on nominalization. In: R.\nJacobs and\nP. Rosenbaum (eds.) Reading in English Transformational Grammar, 184-221.\n   Waltham: Ginn. and further developed by Ray Jackendoff\n   (1977). An X-bar theoretic understanding of sentence structure is\n   possible in a constituency-based grammar only; it is not possible in a dependency-\n   based grammar.\n\nThe letter X is used to signify an arbitrary lexical category (part of speech);\nwhen analyzing a specific utterance, specific categories are assigned. Thus, the\nX may become an N for noun, a V for verb, an A for adjective, or a P for\npreposition.\n\nThe term X-bar is derived from the notation representing this structure.\nCertain structures are represented by X (an X with a bar over it). Because this is\ndifficult to typeset, this is often written as X′, using the prime\nsymbol. In English, however, this is still read as \"X bar\". The notation XP\nstands for X Phrase, and is equivalent to X-bar-bar (X with a double overbar),\nwritten X″, usually read aloud as X double bar.\n","linknr":178,"url":"X-bar_theory","recorded":1362565062,"links":23,"instances":["linguistics","grammar","linguistics","diacritic","linguistics","grammar","linguistics","symbol","grammar","linguistics"],"pdf":["http://kornai.com/Papers/xbarver.pdf"],"categories":["Syntactic relationships","Wikipedia articles with ASCII art"],"headings":["Core concepts","How the rules combine","A simple noun phrase","A full sentence","Substitution test","Reduction","Quantity of sentence structure","Endocentric structures only","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Xbarst1.svg/500px-Xbarst1.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["bar","diacritic"],["prime","symbol"],["determiner","linguistics"],["article","grammar"],["predicate","grammar"],["discontinuity","linguistics"],["inversion","linguistics"],["shifting","linguistics"],["head","linguistics"],["subject","grammar"],["predicate","grammar"]],"members":["head","subject","determiner","bar","shifting","predicate","discontinuity","prime","article","inversion"],"related":["Linguistics","Phrase_structure_rules","English_language","Natural_languages","Noam_Chomsky","Ray_Jackendoff","Phrase_structure_grammar","Dependency_grammar","Lexical_category","Noun","Verb","Adjective","Preposition","Bar_(diacritic)","Prime_(symbol)","ID/LP_grammar","Natural_language","Natural_language_processing","Parse_tree","Determiner_(linguistics)","Article_(grammar)","Determiner_phrase","Word_order","Transformational_grammar","Inflectional_phrase","Predicate_(grammar)","Head-driven_phrase_structure_grammar","Tim_Stowell","Andras_Kornai","Geoffrey_Pullum","Richard_Kayne","Antisymmetry","Noam_Chomsky","Discontinuity_(linguistics)","Government_and_Binding_Theory","Lexical_Functional_Grammar","Inversion_(linguistics)","Shifting_(linguistics)","Generative_grammar","Endocentric","Endocentric","Head_(linguistics)","Subject_(grammar)","Predicate_(grammar)","Verb_phrase","Dependency_grammar","Linguistics","Minimalist_syntax","Phrase_structure_rules","Syntax","Sentence_diagram"]}
