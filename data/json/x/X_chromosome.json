Bottom:\n  Same nucleus stained with DAPI and recorded with a CCD camera. The Barr body\n  is indicated by the arrow, it identifies the inactive X (Xi). ]] The 'X\n  chromosome' is one of the two sex-determining chromosomes in many animal\n  species, including mammals (the other is the Y chromosome) and is found in\n  both males and females. It is a part of the XY sex-determination system and X0\n  sex-determination system. The 'X' chromosome was named for its unique\n  properties by early researchers, which resulted in the naming of its\n  counterpart 'Y' chromosome, for the next letter in the alphabet, after it was\n  discovered later. {{cite web\n| url = http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/01/science/01angi.html title = For\n| Motherly X Chromosome, Gender Is Only the Beginning last = Angier first =\n| Natalie publisher = New York Times date = 2007-05-01 accessdate = 2007-05-\n| 01}}\n","linknr":259,"url":"X_chromosome","recorded":1362676051,"links":49,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Chromosomes|Chromosome X","Cytogenetics"],"headings":["In humans","Role in diseases","Discovery","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fb/Chromosome_X.svg/125px-Chromosome_X.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f5/Sd4hi-unten-crop.jpg/220px-Sd4hi-unten-crop.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/68/Chromosome_X_Etude_Inactivation_X.PNG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Confocal_laser_scanning_microscopy","DAPI","Charge-coupled_device","Sex_determination_system","Chromosome","Y_chromosome","XY_sex-determination_system","X0_sex-determination_system","Base_pairs","DNA","Y_chromosome","Genes","Genetic_disorder","Mutation","Embryo","Ovum","Spermatozoon","X-inactivation","Lyonization","Barr_body","Barr_body","Euchromatin","Y_chromosome","Testis","Klinefelter_syndrome","Testosterone","IQ","Intellectual_disability","Triple_X_syndrome","IQ","IQ","XXXX_syndrome","XXXXX_syndrome","Turner_syndrome","Monosomy","XX_male_syndrome","X-linked_endothelial_corneal_dystrophy","Lisch_epithelial_corneal_dystrophy","Megalocornea","Hermann_Henking","Firebug","Mitosis","Staining","Clarence_Erwin_McClung","Y_chromosome","X_inactivation","Sex_linkage","List_of_X-STR_markers"]}
