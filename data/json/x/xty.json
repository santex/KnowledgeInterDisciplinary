Consequentially, Christians commonly refer to\nJesus as Christ or Messiah.\n\nThe foundation of Christian theology is expressed in the early ecumenical creeds\nwhich contain claims predominantly accepted by followers of the Christian faith.\nThese professions state that Jesus suffered, died, was buried, and was\nsubsequently resurrected from the dead in order to grant eternal life to those\nwho believe in him and trust him for the remission of their sins.
