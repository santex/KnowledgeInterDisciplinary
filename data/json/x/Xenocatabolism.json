{"cursor":"1438","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n'Xenocatabolism' is a concept in bioremediation that was introduced by Dr.\nAubrey de Grey on May 29, 2007, at the Googleplex Google TechTalks. Dr. de Grey\nposited that there are microbes that feed on substances such as amyloid,\ncholesterol and other related substances in places that are full of human\nremains, such as graveyards. This was based on the microbial infallibility\nhypothesis. He states that \"the biomedical approach would be to identify the\ngenetic basis for that capacity, and to put one or two genes into ourselves,\nthereby enhancing our own ability to break things down, and to thereby get rid\nof things that we cannot naturally break down.\" In order to add\ncredibility the concept, de Grey created an experiment using soil from a\ngraveyard and took the bacteria from it. He used lipofuscin, \"one of the major\nthings that accumulates indigestibly in the body\" - which some of the bacteria\nbroke down, giving some credit to the concept.\n","linknr":100,"url":"Xenocatabolism","recorded":1362507374,"links":12,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Bioremediation"],"headings":["See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Concept","Bioremediation","Aubrey_de_Grey","Googleplex","Google_TechTalks","Microbes","Amyloid","Cholesterol","Human","Body","Graveyards","Microbial_infallibility_hypothesis","Biomedical","Genes","Soil","Bacteria","Lipofuscin","Aubrey_de_Grey","Biogerontology"]}
