{"cursor":"14760","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Xerography' (or 'electrophotography') is a dry photocopying technique invented\nby Chester Carlson in 1938, for which he was awarded on October 6, 1942. Carlson\noriginally called his invention electrophotography. It was later renamed\nxerographyâfrom the Greek roots xeros \"dry\" and -graphia \"writing\"âto emphasize\nthat, unlike reproduction techniques then in use such as cyanotype, this process\nused no liquid chemicals.\n\nCarlson's innovation combined electrostatic printing with photography, unlike\nthe dry electrostatic printing process invented by Georg Christoph Lichtenberg\nin 1778. Carlson's original process was cumbersome, requiring several\nmanual processing steps with flat plates. It was almost 18 years before a fully\nautomated process was developed, the key breakthrough being use of a cylindrical\ndrum coated with selenium instead of a flat plate. This resulted in the first\ncommercial automatic copier, the Xerox 914, being released by Haloid/Xerox in\n1960. Before that year, Carlson had proposed his idea to more than a dozen\ncompanies, but none were interested. Xerography is now used in most photocopying\nmachines and in laser and LED printers.\n","linknr":195,"url":"Xerography","recorded":1362485729,"links":28,"instances":["geometry","linguistics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["1938 introductions","Non-impact printing","Electrostatics","American inventions"],"headings":["Xerographic process","Uses in animation","List of feature films using the xerography process","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c1/Xerographic_photocopy_process_en.svg/220px-Xerographic_photocopy_process_en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["root","linguistics"],["cylinder","geometry"]],"members":["cylinder","root"],"related":["Photocopier","Invention","Chester_Carlson","Greek_language","Root_(linguistics)","Cyanotype","Chemical","Photography","Electrostatic","Printing","Georg_Christoph_Lichtenberg","Cylinder_(geometry)","Selenium","Xerox_914","Xerox","Photocopying","Laser_printer","LED_printer","Photocopier","Laser_printer","Digital_press","Photocopier","Microform","Laser_printer","LED_printer","Amorphous_solid","Selenium","IBM_Corporation","Doped","Silicon_diode","Nitride","Electrostatic","Volts","Corona_discharge","Negative_charge","Electrons","Triboelectric","Offset_printing","CMYK","Xeikon","Mnemonic","Ub_Iwerks"]}
