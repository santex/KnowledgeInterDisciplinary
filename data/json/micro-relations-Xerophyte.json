Plants\nwith such morphological and physiological adaptations are called\nxeromorphic. âXeromorphicâ, The Cambridge Illustrated Glossary of\nBotanical Terms, Michael Hickey, Clive King, Cambridge University Press,\n2001\n","linknr":258,"url":"Xerophyte","recorded":1362482616,"links":50,"instances":["biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Drought-tolerant plants| Xerophyte","Botany terms","Plant morphology","Deserts and xeric shrublands","Desert flora| Xerophyte","Drought-tolerant trees| Xerophyte","Xerophiles"],"headings":["Introduction","Types of xerophytic plants","Importance of water conservation","Morphological adaptations","Physiological  adaptations","Modification of environment","Mechanism table","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/Joshua_Tree_NP_-_Joshua_Tree_2.jpg/200px-Joshua_Tree_NP_-_Joshua_Tree_2.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg/20px-Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3d/Cereus_peruvians_%28cropped%29.jpg/200px-Cereus_peruvians_%28cropped%29.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/Euphorbia-virosa.jpg/200px-Euphorbia-virosa.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["morphology","biology"]],"members":["morphology"],"related":["Greek_language","Plant","Arid","Desert","Morphology_(biology)","Physiology","Adaptation","Evaporation","Transpiration","Mesophytic","Cactus","Chaparral","Mediterranean_climate","Arctic","Succulent_plant","Cactaceae","Vestigiality","Bulb","Water_potential","Diffusion","Transpiration","Stomata","Turgor","Permanent_wilting_point","Stomata","Convergent_evolution","Convergent_evolution","Caudiciform","Marah_macrocarpus","Dioscorea_elephantipes","Surface_area","Thorns,_spines,_and_prickles","Barrel_cactus","Basal_rosette","Death_Valley","Tomentose","Epicuticular_wax","Ultraviolet_light","Reflectivity","Caudex","Caudiciform","Resins","Wax","Epicuticular_wax","Volatile_organic_compounds","Chaparral","Malosma_laurina","Dudleya_pulverulenta","Drought_deciduous","Photosynthesis","California_poppy","Leaf_litter","Opuntia","Pine","Tea_plant","CAM_photosynthesis","Bromeliads","Esparto_grass","Prosopis","Halophyte","Hydrophyte","International_Center_for_Agricultural_Research_in_the_Dry_Areas","International_Crops_Research_Institute_for_the_Semi-Arid_Tropics","Kinetic_Theory","Raunkiær_plant_life-form","Xeriscaping","Xerocole"]}
