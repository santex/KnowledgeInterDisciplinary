It is most commonly used in a formal sense in systems\nengineering, software engineering, or enterprise engineering. It is a statement\nthat identifies a necessary attribute, capability, characteristic, or quality of\na system for it to have value and utility to a customer, organisation, internal\nuser, or other stakeholder.\n\nIn the classical engineering approach, sets of requirements are used as inputs\ninto the design stages of product development. Requirements are also an\nimportant input into the verification process, since tests should trace back to\nspecific requirements. Requirements show what elements and functions are\nnecessary for the particular project. This is reflected in the waterfall model\nof the software life-cycle. However, when iterative methods of software\ndevelopment or agile methods are used, the system requirements are incrementally\ndeveloped in parallel with design and implementation.\n","title":"requirement","headings":["Origins of term","Product versus process requirements","Types of requirement","Characteristics of good requirements","Requirements analysis or requirements engineering","Documenting requirements","Changes in requirements","Issues","See also","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["4: Requirements_analysis","3: Agile_software_development","2: New_product_development","2: Business_requirements","2: Requirements_elicitation","2: Requirements_management","2: User_story","1: Process_optimization","1: Systems_engineering","1: Software_engineering","1: Enterprise_engineering","1: Waterfall_model","1: Iterative_and_incremental_development","1: Object-oriented_programming","1: International_Institute_of_Business_Analysis","1: A_Guide_to_the_Business_Analysis_Body_of_Knowledge","1: FURPS","1: Requirements_analysis#Types_of_Requirements","1: Business_case","1: User_requirements_document","1: Functional_requirements","1: Non-functional_requirements","1: Ilities","1: Implementation","1: Data_integrity","1: Traceability","1: Geocoding","1: Pair_programming","1: Avionics_software","1: DO-178B","1: Requirements_engineering","1: Feasibility_study","1: Software_inspection","1: Use_cases","1: User_stories","1: Change_control","1: Extreme_programming","1: Acceptance_test","1: Illusion","1: Software_requirements","1: Requirement_prioritization","1: Requirements_traceability","1: Shall_and_will#Technical_specifications","1: MoSCoW_Method"]}
