{"cursor":"21213","size":14,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\nA 'storey' (British English) or 'story' (American English) is any level part of\na building that could be used by people (for living, work, storage, recreation,\netc.). The plurals are 'storeys' and 'stories', respectively.\n\nThe terms 'floor', 'level', or 'deck' can also be used in this sense; except\nthat one may use \"ground floor\" and \"ground level\" for the floor closer to what\nis considered the ground or street level, whereas \"storey\" is commonly used only\nfor levels strictly above or below that\nlevel. [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/story] The words\n\"storey\" and \"floor\" also generally exclude levels of the building that have no\nroof, even if they are used by peopleâsuch as the terrace on the top roof of\nmany buildings.\n\nHouses commonly have only a few floors, often only one. Buildings are often\nclassified as low-rise, mid-rise, and high-rise according to how many levels\nthey contain; but these categories are not well-defined. The tallest skyscraper\nin the world, Burj Khalifa, has 163 floors. The tallest planned skyscraper, Sky\nCity, has 220 floors.\n\nThe height of each storey is based on the ceiling height of the rooms plus the\nthickness of the floors between each pain. Generally this is around 10 feet or 3\nmetres total, however it varies widely from just under this figure to well over\nit. Storeys within a building need not be all the same height — often the\nlobby is more spacious, for example. Higher levels may be smaller in area than\nthe ones beneath (a prominent feature of the Willis Tower).\n\nIn English, the 'principal floor' or 'main floor' of a house is the floor that\ncontains the chief apartments; it is usually the ground floor, or the floor\nabove. In Italy the main floor of a home is usually above the ground level, and\nmay be called the [[piano nobile]] (\"noble floor\").\n\nThe '[[attic]]' or '[[loft]]' is a storey just below the building's roof; its\nceiling is often pitched and/or at a different height than that of other\nfloors. A '[[penthouse apartment|penthouse]]' is a luxury apartment on the\ntopmost storey of a building. A '[[basement]]' is a storey below the main or\nground floor; the first (or only) basement of a home is also called the 'lower\nground floor'.\n\nSplit-level homes have floors that offset from each other by less than the\nheight of a full storey. A mezzanine, in particular, is typically a floor\nhalfway between the ground floor and the next higher floor. Homes with a split-\nlevel entry have the entire main floor raised half a story height above the\nstreet entrance level, and a basement that is half a storey below this level. In\nMacy's Herald Square, there is a \"one and a half\" floor between the first and\nsecond, this can be considered a split level floor.\n\nThere are also multi-storey car parks, also known as parking garages.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Storey","recorded":1362478022,"links":0,"instances":["building","room","linguistics","architecture","architecture"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Building","Identifiers","Floors"],"headings":["Numbering","Elevator buttons","Room numbering","See also","Notes","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["room","architecture"],["lobby","room"],["mezzanine","architecture"],["ordinal_number","linguistics"],["mezzanine","architecture"],["deck","building"]],"members":["deck","lobby","ordinal_number","room","mezzanine"],"related":["British_English","American_English","Building","Soil","Street","House","High-rise","Skyscraper","Burj_Khalifa","Sky_City","Height","Ceiling","Room_(architecture)","Floor","Lobby_(room)","Willis_Tower","Apartment","Italy","Split-level","Mezzanine_(architecture)","Macy's_Herald_Square","Multi-storey_car_park","Parking_garage","Floor","Numbering_scheme","Europe","United_States","Europe","Denmark","Scandinavia","Commonwealth_of_Nations","Singapore","Canada","British_Empire","Latin_America","Mexico","Brazil","France","Germany","Italy","Dutch_language","Spain","Brazil","Portugal","Hungary","Poland","Romania","Slovakia","Slovenia","Spain","English_language","Quebec","Mexico","Russia","Soviet_Union","Scandinavia","Denmark","Mexico","Chile","Peru","Asia","China","Hong_Kong","Japan","Singapore","Ordinal_number_(linguistics)","High-rise","Architect","Sweden","Stair","Thirteenth_floor","Superstition","Hong_Kong","Chinese_language","Chinese_character","China","Taiwan","Phonetic","Tetraphobia","Thirteenth_floor","Polish_language","Poland","Mezzanine_(architecture)","Five-pointed_star","United_States","Americans_with_Disabilities_Act_of_1990","Parking","Roof","Observation_deck","Toronto,_Ontario","Festival_Walk","Hong_Kong","Portugal","Deck_(building)","Floor","Mechanical_floor","Thirteenth_floor"]}
