He went to school in\nFermoy and graduated from the University of Dublin. Originally he intended to\nfollow his father's profession and studied medicine in Edinburgh; he later\ndecided on law and was called to the Bar in 1826 and became King's Counsel in\n1835. He represented Daniel O'Connell in the unsuccessful effort to prosecute\nhim in 1831.He was appointed Solicitor-General for Ireland in 1839 and elected\nto Parliament as member for Clonmel in the same year. He was Attorney-General\nfor Ireland from 1840 to 1841. In 1846 he was appointed Chief Baron of the Irish\nExchequer and held that office until his death - he was briefly considered for\nthe office of Lord Chancellor of Ireland in 1868.\n\nBoth Ball in The Judges in Ireland 1221-1921 Ball, F. Elrington The Judges\nin Ireland 1221-1921, John Murray, London, 1926 and Delaney in his\nbiography of Pigot's successor Christopher Palles Delaney, V.T.H.\nChristopher Palles, Allen Figgis, Dublin, 1960. praise Pigot highly as a\njudge of great intelligence, high principles and integrity; both agree that he\nhad one fault - his habit of inquiring into the most minute details of\nlitigation greatly prolonged the length of the hearing. Nonetheless Delaney\nnoted that a Pigot judgement is always a strong authority to have on one's side.\n\nQuestions were raised about his ability to perform his duties, but only on\nhealth grounds: in 1855 the Law Times named him as one of five senior judges\nalleged to be too old or ill to perform effectively, and noted that he had spent\nsix months in Spain for his health.
