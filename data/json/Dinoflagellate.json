Most are marine plankton, but they are common in\nfresh water habitats as well. Their populations are distributed depending on\ntemperature, salinity, or depth. Many dinoflagellates are known to be\nphotosynthetic, but a large fraction of these are in fact mixotrophic, combining\nphotosynthesis with ingestion of prey. Dinoflagellates are the\nlargest group of marine eukaryotes aside from the diatoms. Being primary\nproducers makes them an important part of the aquatic food chain. Some species,\nare endosymbionts of marine animals and play an important part in the biology of\ncoral reefs. Other dinoflagellates are colorless predators on other protozoa,\nand a few forms are parasitic (see for example [[Oodinium]], [[Pfiesteria]]).\nSome dinoflagellates produce resting stages, called dinoflagellate cysts or\ndinocysts, as part of their life cycles.\n\nDinoflagellates are considered to be protists, with their own division,\nDinoflagellata.

Micropaleontology Special Publication 7,\nSheridan Press, Hanover, Pennsylvania, USA.\n\nAbout 1,555 species of free-living marine dinoflagellates are currently\ndescribed. Another estimate suggests ca. 2000\nliving species, of which more than 1700 are marine and about 220 are from\nfreshwater. The latest estimates suggest a total of 2,294 living\ndinoflagellate species, which includes marine, freshwater and parasitic\ndinoflagellates.\n\nAn algal bloom of dinoflagellates can result in a visible coloration of the\nwater colloquially known as red tide.\n\nMany reviews have been written on dinoflagellates.
