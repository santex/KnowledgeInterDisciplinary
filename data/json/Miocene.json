{"cursor":"16694","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nThe 'Miocene' (symbol M I) is a geological epoch of the\nNeogene Period and extends from about (Ma). The Miocene was named by Sir Charles\nLyell. Its name comes from the Greek words ({{lang|grc-Latn|meiÅn}}, âlessâ) and\n({{lang|grc-Latn|kainos}}, ânewâ) and means \"less\nrecent\" because it has 18% fewer modern sea invertebrates than the Pliocene. The\nMiocene follows the Oligocene Epoch and is followed by the Pliocene Epoch. The\nMiocene is the first epoch of the Neogene Period.\n\nThe earth went from the Oligocene Epoch through the Miocene and into the\nPliocene as it cooled into a series of Ice Ages. The Miocene boundaries are not\nmarked by a single distinct global event but consist rather of regional\nboundaries between the warmer Oligocene and the cooler Pliocene.\n\nThe plants and animals of the Miocene were fairly modern. Mammals and birds were\nwell-established. Whales, seals, and kelp spread. The Miocene Epoch is of\nparticular interest to geologists and palaeoclimatologists as major phases of\nHimalayan Uplift had occurred during the Miocene Epoch affecting monsoonal\npatterns in Asia, which were interlinked with Northern Hemisphere\nglaciation.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Miocene","recorded":1372152272,"links":[],"instances":["animals","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Miocene|"],"headings":["Subdivisions","Paleogeography","Life","Oceans","Middle Miocene disruption","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["fauna","animals"],["family","biology"]],"members":["fauna","family"],"related":["Geologic_time_scale","Neogene","Sir_Charles_Lyell","Invertebrates","Pliocene","Oligocene","Pliocene","Neogene","Ice_Age","Faunal_stage","International_Commission_on_Stratigraphy","Messinian","Annum","Tortonian","Serravallian","Langhian","Burdigalian","Aquitanian_age","Calcite","Coccolithophore","Foraminifera","Pliocene","Oligocene","Continent","Continental_drift","South_America","North_America","Subduction_zone","Pacific_Ocean","Andes","Meso-American","North_America","Europe","East_Asia","Great_Plains","Argentina","India","Asia","Mountain_range","Tethys_Ocean","Africa","Eurasia","Turkey","Arabia","Mediterranean","Messinian_salinity_crisis","East_Africa","Tropical_rain_forest","Australia","Coevolution","Phytolith","Grasses","Herd_behavior","Ungulates","Hypsodont","Ecosystems","Cursorial_","Grazers","Predator","Grasslands","Mollisols_","Carbon_sequestration_in_terrestrial_ecosystems_","Greenhouse_gas_","Albedo","Evapotranspiration","Carbon_dioxide","C3_carbon_fixation","Evolutionary_radiation","Cycad","Fauna_(animals)","Nimravid","Entelodont","Oreodont","Pliocene","Canids","Raccoon","Horse","Beaver","Deer","Camel","Whale","Borophaginae","Gomphotheres","Three-toed_horse","Oceanic_dispersal","Phytolith","Hypsodont","Dabbling_duck","Plover","Typical_owl","Cockatoo","Crow","Family_(biology)","Ape","Old_World","Hominid","Brown_alga","Kelp","Otter","Fish","Invertebrate","Cetaceans","Sperm_whale","Caiman","False_gharial","India","Pinniped","Walrus","South_America","Piranhas","Children's_Museum_of_Indianapolis","Deep_Sea_Drilling_Program","Eocene","Middle_Miocene","Antarctic_Circumpolar_Current","Middle_Pliocene","Extinction","Langhian","Astaracian","Turolian","Vallesian","Geologic_Time_Scale","List_of_fossil_sites"]}
