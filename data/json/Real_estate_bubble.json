{"cursor":"31882","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"{{About|the general phenomenon of housing bubbles|housing bubbles in various\ncountries|Real estate bubble#Real estate bubbles in the 2000sbelow}}\n\nA 'real estate bubble' or 'property bubble' (or 'housing bubble' for\nresidential markets) is a type of economic bubble that occurs periodically in\nlocal or global real estate markets. It is characterized by rapid increases in\nvaluations of real property such as housing until they reach unsustainable\nlevels and then decline.\n\nThe questions of whether real estate bubbles can be identified and prevented,\nand whether they have broader macroeconomic significance are answered\ndifferently by schools of economic thought, as detailed below. The financial\ncrisis of 2007â2012 was related to the bursting of real estate bubbles around\nthe world, which had begun during the 2000s. Michael Simkovic,\n[http://ssrn.com/abstract=1924831 \"Competition and Crisis in Mortgage\nSecuritization\"]\n\nBubbles in housing markets are more critical than stock market bubbles.\nHistorically, equity price busts occur on average every 13 years, lasts for 2.5\nyears, and result in about 4 percent loss in GDP. Housing price busts are less\nfrequent, but last nearly twice as long and lead to output losses that are twice\nas large (IMF World Economic Outlook, 2003). A recent laboratory experimental\nstudy Ikromov, Nuridding and Abdullah Yavas, 2012a, Asset Characteristics\nand Boom and Bust Periods: An Experimental Study, Real Estate Economics, 40, 508-\n535. also shows that, compared to financial markets, real estate markets\ninvolve longer boom and bust periods.\n","linknr":525,"url":"Real_estate_bubble","recorded":1362480505,"links":44,"instances":["house","finance"],"pdf":["http://www.ntu.ac.uk/nbs/school/acad/afe/10710.pdf","http://www.cepr.net/documents/housing_indicators_2006_06.pdf","http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2004/02/pdf/chapter2.pdf","http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2003/01/pdf/chapter2.pdf","http://www.demographia.com/dhi.pdf","http://www.levy.org/pubs/sa%5Fjan%5F06.pdf","http://prices.kyero.com/files/2010/07/kyero-spanish-property-market-summary-q2-2010.pdf","http://cuer.sauder.ubc.ca/cma/data/ResidentialRealEstate/HousingPrices/housing-pri-vancouver.pdf"],"categories":["Real
