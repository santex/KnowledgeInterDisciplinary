{"cursor":"4327","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Pronuntiatio' was the discipline of delivering speeches in Western classical\nrhetoric. It is the one of five canons of classical rhetoric (the others being\ninventio, dispositio, elocutio, and memoria) that concern the crafting and\ndelivery of speeches. In literature the equivalent of ancient pronuntiatio is\nthe recitation of epics (Aris. Po. 26.2.). Heinrich Lausberg, David E.\nOrton, R. Dean Anderson, Handbook of literary rhetoric: a foundation for\nliterary study, BRILL, 1998, pp. 480\n\nAs with memoria, the canon that dealt with the memorization of speeches,\npronuntiatio was not extensively written about in Classical texts on rhetoric.\nIts importance declined even more, once the written word became the focus of\nrhetoric, although after the eighteenth century it again saw more interest in\nthe works of men such as Gilbert Austin. In public speaking today, it may be\nsomewhat over-emphasized, but that is probably more because other parts of\nrhetoric are downplayed.\n\nRhetoricians laid down guidelines on the use of the voice and gestures (actio)\nin the delivery of oratory. There were instructions on the proper modulation of\nthe voice (volume and pitch), as well as the phrasing, pace, and emphasis of\nspeech. Also covered were the physical aspects of oration: stance, gestures,\nposture, and facial expressions. There was also the concept of exercitatio (or\npractice exercises) that enabled speakers to both memorize their speeches and to\npractice their delivery.\n\nThis excerpt from Quintilian's Institutio oratoria provides an example of the\ntypes of advice provided by rhetoricians:\n\n:\"The head, being the chief member of the body, has a corresponding importance\n:in delivery, serving not merely to produce graceful effect, but to illustrate\n:our meaning as well. To secure grace it is essential that the head should be\n:carried naturally and erect. For a droop suggests humility, while if it be\n:thrown back it seems to express arrogance, if inclined to one side it gives an\n:impression of languor, while if it is held too stiffly and rigidly it appears\n:to indicate a rude and savage temper.\" (Institutio oratoria, XI iii 68-69,\n:translated by H. E. Butler, Loeb Classical Library, 1922)\n\nWhile the content, structure, and style of oration were (and continue to be) the\nmost important elements of oratory, there is no doubt that effective delivery\nenhances its persuasive power, and that poor delivery detracts greatly from its\nintended effect.\n\nDelivery is based on the technology of the times. During Cicero's time, delivery\nwas predominantly speaking. Written delivery developed because of the written\nlanguage, and now delivery is both spoken and written. Technology has taken away\nthe distinctions between written and oral delivery.\n\nWritten discourse did not become important until reading became more common.\nBecause the ancients did not use punctuation, their writing consisted of one\nlong stream of words called scriptio continua. During the editing process,\nmodern rhetors must go through three stages: correctness rule, formatting, and\npresentation. Writers face more problems than speakers because they must be\nconscious of spelling, punctuation, and grammar. Punctuation is useful in\nwritten discourse because it marks the end of a thought and allows the reader to\npause and process the information. Visual rhetoric focuses on images and how\nwords function as images. The delivery of ocular demonstration is the use of\nwords to produce mental images in the audience. Textual presentation allows the\nwriter to grab the reader's attention before actually reading the text based on\nthe appearance of the text. The invention of word processors has allowed writers\nto enhance the appearance of their text and use effects to put emphasis on\ncertain words or thoughts. Delivery refers not only to written or spoken\nlanguage, but also refers to photographs, paintings, or movies.
