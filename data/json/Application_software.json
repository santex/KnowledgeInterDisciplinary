GIMP is freely distributed software.]]\n\n'Application software' is all the computer software that causes a computer to\nperform useful tasks beyond the running of the computer itself. A specific\ninstance of such software is called a 'software application', 'application' or\n'app' .\n\nThe term is used to contrast such software with system software, which manages\nand integrates a computer's capabilities but does not directly perform tasks\nthat benefit the user. The system software serves the application, which in turn\nserves the user.\n\nExamples include enterprise software, accounting software, office suites,\ngraphics software and media players. Many application programs deal principally\nwith documents. Applications may be bundled with the computer and its system\nsoftware, or may be published separately.\n\nApplication software applies the power of a particular computing platform or\nsystem software to a particular purpose.\n\nSome applications are available in versions for several different platforms;\nothers have narrower requirements and are thus called, for example, a Geography\napplication for Windows or an Android application for education or Linux gaming.\nSometimes a new and popular application arises which only runs on one platform,\nincreasing the desirability of that platform. This is called a killer\napplication.\n","linknr":316,"url":"Application_software","recorded":1362671130,"links":65,"instances":["computing","finance","operating_system","application_software"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Application software|"],"headings":["Terminology","Application software classification","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/85/OpenOffice.org_Writer.png/275px-OpenOffice.org_Writer.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c8/GIMP_2.8_running_on_Ubuntu_12.04.png/275px-GIMP_2.8_running_on_Ubuntu_12.04.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/Wikiversity-logo.svg/40px-Wikiversity-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["media_player","application_software"],["android","operating_system"],["kernel","computing"],["media_player","application_software"],["clearing","finance"],["media_player","application_software"]],"members":["kernel","clearing","android","media_player"],"related":["OpenOffice.org","Open_source","Free_software","Computer_software","Software_application","System_software","Enterprise_software","Accounting_software","Office_suite","Graphics_software","Media_player_(application_software)","Document_file_format","Product_bundling","Computing_platform","Geographic_information_system","Microsoft_Windows","Android_(operating_system)","Educational_software","Linux_gaming","Killer_application","Information_technology","Computer_program","Operating_system","Utility_software","Programming_tool","Integrated_software","End-user_development","Email_filter","Operating_system","United_States_v._Microsoft","Antitrust","Internet_Explorer","Web_browser","Microsoft_Windows","GNU/Linux_naming_controversy","Linux_kernel","Kernel_(computing)","Embedded_system","VCR","DVD","Microwave_oven","Mobile_app","Smartphone","Tablet_computer","Vertical_application","Niche_product","Business_software","Microsoft_Office","OpenOffice.org","IWork","Supply_chain_management_software","Expense_management","Software_systems","Time_management","Media_player_(application_software)","Web_browser","Computer-aided_design","Computer-aided_engineering","Integrated_development_environment","Computing_platform","Operating_system","Cloud_computing","Web_2.0","Mobile_apps","Mobile_device","Command-line_interface","Graphical_user_interface","Software_calculator","Text_editor","Enterprise_resource_planning","Accounting_software","Project_management_software","Field_service_management","Contact_manager","Spreadsheet","Database","Document_automation","Word_processor","Desktop_publishing","Diagramming_software","Presentation_software","Email","Blog_software","Reservation_systems","Day_trading_software","Banking_software","Clearing_(finance)","Electronic_media","Web_browser","Media_player_(application_software)","Presentation_program","Digital_pet","Screen_saver","Video_game","Arcade_game","Video_game_console_emulator","Personal_computer_game","Console_game","Mobile_game","Reference_software","Workflow","Database_management_system","Digital_asset_management","Document_management","Geographic_information_system","Computer_simulator","Computational_science","Social_simulator","Military_simulation","Flight_simulator","Driving_simulator","Simulation_game","Vehicle_simulation_game","Image_organizer","3D_computer_graphics_software","Animation_software","Graphic_art_software","Image_editing","Raster_graphics_editor","Vector_graphics_editor","Video_editing_software","Digital_audio_workstation","Digital_audio_editor","Music_sequencer","Scorewriter","Hypermedia","HTML_editor","Game_development_tool","Engineering","Computer-aided_engineering","CAD","Finite_element_analysis","Software_engineering","Computer_language","Compiler","Integrated_development_environment","Program_testing","License_manager","Utility_software"]}
