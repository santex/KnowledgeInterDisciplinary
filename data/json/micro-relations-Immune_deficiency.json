Immunodeficiency may also decrease\ncancer immunosurveillance. Most cases of immunodeficiency are acquired\n(\"secondary\") but some people are born with defects in their immune system, or\nprimary immunodeficiency. Transplant patients take medications to suppress their\nimmune system as an anti-rejection measure, as do some patients suffering from\nan over-active immune system. A person who has an immunodeficiency of any kind\nis said to be 'immunocompromised'. An immunocompromised person may be\nparticularly vulnerable to opportunistic infections, in addition to normal\ninfections that could affect everyone.\n","linknr":624,"url":"Immune_deficiency","recorded":1362580156,"links":42,"instances":["medical"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Immunodeficiency|"],"headings":["Types","Immunodeficiency and autoimmunity","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["trauma","medical"]],"members":["trauma"],"related":["Immune_system","Infectious_disease","Cancer_immunosurveillance","Primary_immunodeficiency","Opportunistic_infection","Humoral_immune_deficiency","Hypogammaglobulinemia","Respiratory_infection","Agammaglobulinemia","T_cell_deficiency","Acquired_immune_deficiency_syndrome","Granulocyte","Granulocytopenia","Agranulocytosis","Neutrophil_granulocyte","Neutropenia","Chronic_granulomatous_disease","Asplenia","Spleen","Complement_deficiency","Complement_system","Severe_combined_immunodeficiency","Acquired_immune_deficiency_syndrome","Humoral_immune_deficiency","B_cell","Plasma_cell","Antibody","Primary_humoral_immune_deficiency","Multiple_myeloma","Chronic_lymphoid_leukemia","AIDS","T_cell_deficiency","T_cell","Hematopoietic_stem_cell_transplantation","Organ_transplant","AIDS","Cancer_chemotherapy","Lymphoma","Glucocorticoid","Intracellular_pathogen","Fungal_infection_in_animals","Neutropenia","Neutrophil_granulocyte","Chemotherapy","Bone_marrow_transplantation","Chronic_granulomatous_disease","Asplenia","Spleen","Splenectomy","Trauma_(medical)","Sickle-cell_anemia","Polysaccharide_encapsulated_bacteria","Pneumococcus","Meningococcus","Complement_deficiency","Complement_system","Rare_disease","Infection","Genetic_disorder","Autosomal_recessive","Sex_linkage","Lymphocyte","Granulocyte","Hematopoietic_stem_cell_transplantation","Immunosuppression","Malnutrition","Aging","Chemotherapy","Disease-modifying_antirheumatic_drug","Immunosuppressive_drug","Organ_transplant","Glucocorticoid","Immunosuppression","Cancer","Leukemia","Lymphoma","Multiple_myeloma","AIDS","HIV","T_helper_cell"]}
