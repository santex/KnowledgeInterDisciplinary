The solvent does the dissolving. The solution more or\nless takes on the characteristics of the solvent including its phase, and the\nsolvent is commonly the major fraction of the mixture. The concentration of a\nsolute in a solution is a measure of how much of that solute is dissolved in\nthe solvent.\n","linknr":620,"url":"Solute","recorded":1362374769,"links":67,"instances":["chemistry","chemistry","chemistry","chemistry","properties","element","matter","chemistry","chemistry","chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Solutions","Homogeneous chemical mixtures","Alchemical processes","Physical chemistry","Colloidal chemistry","Drug delivery devices","Dosage forms"],"headings":["Characteristics","Types","Solubility","Properties","Liquid","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/SaltInWaterSolutionLiquid.jpg/220px-SaltInWaterSolutionLiquid.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c6/3D_model_hydrogen_bonds_in_water.svg/150px-3D_model_hydrogen_bonds_in_water.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/Helmet_logo_for_Underwater_Diving_portal.png/20px-Helmet_logo_for_Underwater_Diving_portal.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/FlattenedRoundPills.jpg/58px-FlattenedRoundPills.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/Hexaaquatitanium%28III%29-solution.jpg/58px-Hexaaquatitanium%28III%29-solution.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/Inhaler.jpg/58px-Inhaler.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/Glycerin_suppositories.jpg/58px-Glycerin_suppositories.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/SPF15SunBlock.JPG/58px-SPF15SunBlock.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/Injection_Syringe_01.jpg/58px-Injection_Syringe_01.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/84/Nuvola_apps_filetypes_red.svg/52px-Nuvola_apps_filetypes_red.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/SpongeDiver.jpg/100px-SpongeDiver.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["homogeneous","chemistry"],["phase","matter"],["dissolution","chemistry"],["effervescence","chemistry"],["salt","chemistry"],["homogeneous","chemistry"],["suspension","chemistry"],["mercury","element"],["amalgam","chemistry"],["saturation","chemistry"],["water","properties"]],"members":["amalgam","salt","saturation","homogeneous","water","mercury","phase","dissolution","effervescence","suspension"],"related":["Table_salt","Sodium_chloride","Water","Chemistry","Homogeneous_(chemistry)","Mixture","Phase_(matter)","Dissolution_(chemistry)","Solvent","Concentration","State_of_matter","Gas","Air","Mixture","Liquid","Carbonated_water","Effervescence_(chemistry)","Sucrose","Sugar","Sodium_chloride","Salt","Salt_(chemistry)","Electrolyte","Ion","Homogeneous_(chemistry)","Colloid","Suspension_(chemistry)","Emulsion","Solid","Hydrogen","Palladium","Hydrogen_storage","Mercury_(element)","Gold","Amalgam_(chemistry)","Hexane","Paraffin_wax","Steel","Alloy","Bronze","Polymer","Plasticizer","Chemical_compound","Solubility","Entropy","Thermodynamic_free_energy","Saturation_(chemistry)","Temperature","Pressure","Supersaturated","Solubility","Exothermic","Enthalpy_of_solution","Surfactant","Melting_point","Boiling_point","Colligative_properties","Concentration","Ideal_solution","Linear_combination","Ethanol","Noble_gas","Chemical_polarity","Electric_dipole_moment","Hydrogen_bond","Protic","Water","Solvation","Electrolyte","Ethanol","Oil","Petroleum","Water_(properties)","Solvation","Molar_solution","Percentage_solution","Solubility_equilibrium","Stock_solution","Total_dissolved_solids","Upper_critical_solution_temperature","Lower_critical_solution_temperature","Coil-globule_transition"]}
