The same sense is expressed by emotions such as \"craving\" or\n\"hankering\". When a person desires something or someone, their sense of longing\nis excited by the enjoyment or the thought of the item or person, and they want\nto take actions to obtain their goal. The motivational aspect of desire has long\nbeen noted by philosophers; Hobbes (1588â1679) asserted that human desire is the\nfundamental motivation of all human action.\n\nIn Buddhism, for an individual to effect his or her liberation, the flow of sense-\ndesire must be cut completely; however, while training, he or she must work with\nmotivational processes based on skilfully applied desire. Steven Collins,\n''Selfless Persons: Thought and Imagery in Theravada Buddhism.\" Cambridge\nUniversity Press, 1982, page 251: \"In the end, the flowing streams of sense-\ndesire must be 'cut' or 'crossed' completely; nevertheless, for the duration of\nthe Path, a monk must perforce work with motivational and perceptual processes\nas they ordinarily are, that is to say, based on desire ... Thus, during mental\ntraining, the stream is not to be 'cut' immediately, but guided, like water\nalong viaducts. The meditative steadying of the mind by counting in- and out-\nbreaths (in the mindfulness of breathing) is compared to the steadying of a boat\nin 'a fierce current' by its rudder. The disturbance of the flow of a mountain\nstream by irrigation channels cut into its sides it used to illustrate the\nweakening of insight by the five 'hindrances'.\" The Buddha stated,\naccording to the early Buddhist scriptures, that monks should \"generate desire\"\nfor the sake of fostering skillful qualities and abandoning unskillful ones. Thanissaro Bhikkhu, \"The Wings to Awakening,\"\n[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/wings/index.html]. See\nspecifically [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/wings/part2.html#part2-\nc this section].\n\nWhile desires are often classified as emotions by laypersons, psychologists\noften describe desires as different from emotions; psychologists tend to argue\nthat desires arise from bodily structures, such as the stomach's need for food,\nwhereas emotions arise from a person's mental state. Marketing and advertising\ncompanies have used psychological research on how desire is stimulated to find\nmore effective ways to induce consumers to buy a given product or service. While\nsome advertising attempts to give buyers a sense of lack or wanting, other types\nof advertising create desire associating the product with desirable attributes,\neither by showing a celebrity or model with the product.\n\nThe theme of desire is at the core of the romance novel, which often create\ndrama by showing cases where human desire is impeded by social conventions,\nclass, or cultural barriers. As well, it is used in other literary genres, such\nas gothic novels such as [[Dracula]] by Bram Stoker, in which desire is mingled\nwith fear and dread. Poets ranging from Homer to Toni Morrison have dealt with\nthe themes of desire in their work. Just as desire is central to the written\nfiction genre of romance, it is the central theme of melodrama films, which use\nplots that appeal to the heightened emotions of the audience by showing \"crises\nof human emotion, failed romance or friendship\", in which desire is thwarted or\nunrequited.\n","linknr":332,"url":"Desire_(emotion)","recorded":1362668059,"links":25,"instances":["plato","heroic_literature","psychoanalysis"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Emotions","Philosophy of love","Personal life","Philosophy of sexuality","Marketing"],"headings":["In philosophy","Scientific perspectives","In marketing","In fiction, film, and art","Contemporary Spiritual Perspective","See also","References","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ce/Plutchik-wheel.svg/90px-Plutchik-wheel.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["romance","heroic_literature"],["the_republic","plato"],["desire","in_philosophy"],["desire","psychoanalysis"],["desire","in_philosophy"],["desire","psychoanalysis"]],"members":["the_republic","romance","desire"],"related":["Hobbes","Buddhism","Theravada","Five_hindrances","Gautama_Buddha","Pali_Canon","Marketing","Romance_(heroic_literature)","Bram_Stoker","Homer","Toni_Morrison","Melodrama","Plato","The_Republic_(Plato)","Aristotle","Hobbes","Spinoza","David_Hume","Kant","Hypothetical_imperative","Kant","Hegel","Buddhism","Tanha","Dukkha","Nirvana","Desire_(in_Philosophy)","Dopamine","Sigmund_Freud","Oedipus_Complex","Jacques_Lacan","Jouissance","Desire_(psychoanalysis)","Marketing","Gustave_Flaubert","Gabriel_Garcia_Marquez","Vladimir_Nabokov","Bram_Stoker","E.M._Forster","W.B._Yeats","T._S._Eliot","John_Donne","Carol_Ann_Duffy","Ted_Hughes","Wendy_Cope","Melodrama","Drama_film","Desire_(in_Philosophy)","Desire_(psychoanalysis)","Want"]}
