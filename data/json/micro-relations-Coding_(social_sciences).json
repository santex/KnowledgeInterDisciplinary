{"cursor":"3260","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Coding' refers to an analytical process in which data, in both quantitative\nform (such as questionnaires results) or qualitative (such as interview s) are\ncategorised to facilitate analysis.\n\nCoding means the transformation of data into a form understandable by computer\nsoftware. The classification of information is an important step in preparation\nof data for computer processing with statistical software.\n\nOne code should apply to only one category and categories should be\ncomprehensive. There should be clear guidelines for coders (individual who do\nthe coding) so that code is consistent.\n\nSome studies will employ multiple coders working independently on the same\ndate. This minimizes the chance of errors from coding and increases the\nreliability of data.\n","linknr":131,"url":"Coding_(social_sciences)","recorded":1362896636,"links":16,"instances":["statistics","programming_language","programming","software"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Research","Statistical data coding","Social statistics"],"headings":["Quantitative approach","Qualitative approach","Mixed methods","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/75/Science-symbol-2.svg/30px-Science-symbol-2.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["reliability","statistics"],["variable","programming"],["dap","software"],["r","programming_language"]],"members":["reliability","r","variable","dap"],"related":["Quantitative_research","Questionnaire","Qualitative_research","Interview","Data_transformation","Software","Information","Data","Computer","List_of_statistical_packages","Reliability_(statistics)","Levels_of_measurement","Variable_(programming)","Fieldwork","Open_question","Spreadsheets","Microsoft_Excel","PSPP","SPSS","DAP_(software)","SAS_System","MiniTab","Qualitative_research","Ethnography","Humanistic_geography","Phenomenological_psychology","Atlas.ti","QDA_Miner","NVivo","RQDA","R_(programming_language)","Graphical_User_Interface","Codebook"]}
