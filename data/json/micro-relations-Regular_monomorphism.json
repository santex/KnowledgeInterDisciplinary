A monomorphism from X to Y is often denoted with the\nnotation X \\hookrightarrow Y .\n\nIn the more general setting of category theory, a 'monomorphism' (also called a\n'monic morphism' or a 'mono') is a left-cancellative morphism, that is, an arrow\nsuch that, for all morphisms ,\n: f \\circ g_1 = f \\circ g_2 \\Rightarrow g_1 = g_2.\n\nMonomorphisms are a categorical generalization of injective functions (also\ncalled \"one-to-one functions\"); in some categories the notions coincide, but\nmonomorphisms are more general, as in the examples below.\n\nThe categorical dual of a monomorphism is an epimorphism, i.e. a monomorphism in\na category C is an epimorphism in the dual category C op . Every\nsection is a monomorphism, and every retraction is an epimorphism.\n","linknr":150,"url":"Regular_monomorphism","recorded":1362672082,"links":17,"instances":["mathematics","mathematics","mathematics","category_theory","group_theory","category_theory"],"pdf":["http://www.math.uu.nl/people/jvoosten/syllabi/catsmoeder.pdf"],"categories":["Morphisms"],"headings":["Relation to invertibility","Examples","Properties","Related concepts","Terminology","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/77/Monomorphism-01.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/d/6/0d6fce3812e2e24208c41cbadef80afd.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/a/1/5a113b60f8cb144f1959b87f7b37f347.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/3/5/9/359e3cc6ebb23fce09ef89a78ccc1626.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/1/2/a/12ab435bec248acfd089c2d286aa4916.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/3/6/d/36d91f0856e01d3b044bf395505f3516.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/0/2/50244d9493ae4c47de98d430e4c6b4de.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["section","category_theory"],["retract","category_theory"],["section","category_theory"],["group","mathematics"],["complement","group_theory"],["function","mathematics"],["equaliser","mathematics"]],"members":["equaliser","group","function","section","complement","retract"],"related":["Abstract_algebra","Universal_algebra","Injective_function","Homomorphism","Category_theory","Left-cancellative","Morphism","Injective_function","Categorical_dual","Epimorphism","Dual_category","Section_(category_theory)","Retract_(category_theory)","Section_(category_theory)","Group_(mathematics)","Complement_(group_theory)","Injective","Concrete_category","Function_(mathematics)","Category_of_sets","Injective","Free_object","Abelian_category","Divisible_group","Abelian_group","Group_homomorphism","Quotient_group","Topos","Epic_morphism","Equaliser_(mathematics)","Nicolas_Bourbaki","Saunders_Mac_Lane","Epimorphism","Embedding","Isomorphism","Subobject"]}
