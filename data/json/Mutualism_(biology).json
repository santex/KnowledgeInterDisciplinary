Pollination is a classic example of mutualism.]]\n\n'Mutualism' is the way two organisms of different species exist in a\nrelationship in which each individual benefits. Similar interactions within a\nspecies are known as co-operation. Mutualism can be contrasted with\ninterspecific competition, in which each species experiences reduced fitness,\nand exploitation, or parasitism, in which one species benefits at the expense of\nthe other. Mutualism is a type of symbiosis. Symbiosis is a broad category,\ndefined to include relationships that are mutualistic, parasitic, or commensal.\nMutualism is only one type.\n\nA well-known example of mutualism is the relationship between ungulates (such as\nBovines) and bacteria within their intestines. The ungulates benefit from the\ncellulase produced by the bacteria, which facilitates digestion; the bacteria\nbenefit from having a stable supply of nutrients in the host environment.\n\nMutualism plays a key part in ecology. For example, mutualistic interactions are\nvital for terrestrial ecosystem function as more than 48% of land plants rely on\nmycorrhizal relationships with fungi to provide them with inorganic compounds\nand trace elements. In addition, mutualism is thought to have driven the\nevolution of much of the biological diversity we see, such as flower forms\n(important for pollination mutualisms) and co-evolution between groups of\nspecies.

However mutualism has historically\nreceived less attention than other interactions such as predation and\nparasitism. Bronstein, JL. 1994. Our current understand of mutualism.\nQuarterly Review of Biology 69 (1): 31-51 March 1994 Begon, M., J.L.\nHarper, and C.R. Townsend. 1996. [[Ecology: individuals, populations, and\ncommunities]], Third Edition. Blackwell Science Ltd., Cambridge, Massachusetts,\nUSA.\n\nMeasuring the exact fitness benefit to the individuals in a mutualistic\nrelationship is not always straightforward, particularly when the individuals\ncan receive benefits from a variety of species, for example most plant-\npollinator mutualisms. It is therefore common to categorise mutualisms according\nto the closeness of the association, using terms such as obligate and\nfacultative. Defining \"closeness,\" however, is also problematic. It can refer to\nmutual dependency (the species cannot live without one another) or the\nbiological intimacy of the relationship in relation to physical closeness (e.g.,\none species living within the tissues of the other species).
