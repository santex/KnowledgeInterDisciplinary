Although the name\n\"chimpanzee\" is sometimes used to refer to both species together, it is usually\nunderstood as referring to the common chimpanzee, while Pan paniscus is usually\nreferred to as the bonobo.\n\nIt is distinguished by relatively long legs, pink lips, dark face and tail-tuft\nthrough adulthood, and parted long hair on its head. The bonobo is found in a\narea of the Congo Basin in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Central Africa.\nThe species is omnivorous and inhabits primary and secondary forests, including\nseasonally inundated swamp forests.\n\nThe bonobo is popularly known for its high levels of sexual behavior. Sex\nfunctions in conflict appeasement, affection, social status, excitement, and\nstress reduction. It occurs in virtually all partner combinations and in a\nvariety of positions. This is a factor in the lower levels of aggression seen in\nthe bonobo when compared to the common chimpanzee and other apes. Bonobos are\nperceived to be matriarchal; females tend to collectively dominate males by\nforming alliances and use sexuality to control males. A male's rank in the\nsocial hierarchy is often determined by his mother's rank.\n\nAlong with the common chimpanzee, the bonobo is the closest extant relative to\nhumans. Because the two species are not proficient swimmers, the formation of\nthe Congo River 1.5â2 million years ago possibly led to the speciation of the\nbonobo. They live south of the river, and thereby were separated from the\nancestors of the common chimpanzee, which live north of the river. There are no\nconcrete data on population numbers, but the estimate is between 29,500 and\n50,000 individuals. The species is listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List and\nis threatened by habitat destruction and human population growth and movement,\nthough commercial poaching is the most prominent threat. It typically lives 40\nyears in captivity, though its lifespan in the wild is unknown.\n","linknr":833,"url":"Bonobo","recorded":1362373752,"links":97,"instances":["human","ecology","subtribe","paris"],"pdf":["http://www.chrisherzfeld.com/userfiles/publications/BONOBO.pdf","http://www.chrisherzfeld.com/userfiles/publications/BONOBO.pdf","http://www.biozentrum.uni-wuerzburg.de/uploads/media/Bonobo_sex_01.pdf","http://www.biozentrum.uni-wuerzburg.de/uploads/media/Bonobo_sex_01.pdf","http://www.nagonline.net/HUSBANDRY/Diets%20pdf/Bonobo%20Nutrition.pdf","http://www.friendsofbonobos.org/images/newsnov09.pdf","http://watha.org/in-depth/EP176A.pdf"],"categories":["Animals
