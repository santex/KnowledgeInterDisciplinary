The American Heritage\nDictionary of the English Language. Fourth Edition. Houghton Mifflin Company:\n2000. McKean, Erin (ed.). The New Oxford American Dictionary. Second\nedition. Oxford University Press: 2005. The measured entity is generally\ncalled the 'analyte', or the 'measurand' or the 'target' of the assay. The\nassay usually aims to measure an intensive property of the analyte and express\nit in the relevant measurement unit (e.g. molarity, density, functional\nactivity in enzyme international units, degree of some effect in comparison to\na standard, etc.).\n\nIf the assay involves addition of exogenous reactants (the reagents), their\nquantities are kept fixed (or in excess) so that the quantity (and quality) of\nthe target is the only limiting factor for the reaction/assay process, and the\ndifference in the assay outcome is used to deduce the unknown quality or\nquantity of the target in question. Some assays (e.g., biochemical assays) may\nbe similar to or have overlap with chemical analysis and titration. But\ngenerally, assays involve biological material or phenomena which tend to be\nintrinsically more complex either in composition or in behavior or both. Thus\nreading of an assay may be quite noisy and may involve greater difficulties in\ninterpretation than an accurate chemical titration. On the other hand, older\ngeneration qualitative assays, especially bioassays, may be much more gross\nand less quantitative (e.g., counting death or dysfunction of an organism or\ncells in a population, or some descriptive change in some body part of a group\nof animals).\n\nIn modern practice, assays have become a routine part of medical, environmental,\npharmaceutical, forensic and many other businesses at various scales from\nindustrial to curbside or field level. Those assays that have very high\ncommercial demand have been well investigated in research and development\nsectors of professional industries and have gone through various generations of\ndevelopment of better and sophisticated assays that have become copyrighted\nintellectual properties through highly competitive process patenting. These kind\nof industrial scale assays are often done in well equipped laboratories and use\nhigh level of automation in organizing the procedure, right from ordering of an\nassay, to pre-analytic sample processing (sample collection, necessary\nmanipulations e.g. spinning for separation or other processes, aliquoting if\nnecessary, storage, retrieval, pipetting/aspiration etc.) and are generally\ntested in high thruput AutoAnalyzers and the results are verified, and\ntransmitted automatically back to the ordering service providers and the end\nusers. These are made possible through use of advanced Laboratory informatics\nsystem that interfaces with multiple computer terminals with end users as well\nas central servers and the physical autoanalyser instruments and other automata.\n","linknr":333,"url":"Assay","recorded":1362512424,"links":17,"instances":["optics","material","biology","assay","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Biochemistry","Laboratory techniques","Titration"],"headings":["Etymology","General steps of any assay","Assay types based on the targets being measured","Quality of an assay","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cell","biology"],["sample","material"],["agglutination","biology"],["agglutination","biology"],["cell","biology"],["photometry","optics"],["multiplex","assay"]],"members":["photometry","sample","cell","multiplex","agglutination"],"related":["Laboratory_medicine","Pharmacology","Environmental_biology","Molecular_biology","Drug","Biochemistry","Cell_(biology)","Organism","Sample_(material)","Intensive_and_extensive_properties","Molarity","Density","Exogenous","Analytical_chemistry","Intellectual_property","Process_patent","Medical_laboratory","AutoAnalyzer","Laboratory_informatics_system","Metallurgical_assay","Preanalytic","Post-analytic","Information","Information_transmission","Epitope_retrieval","Mass_Spectrometry","PCR","Base_pairing","PCR","DNA_polymerase","Band-pass","Blocking_reagent","Quencher","Multiplex_assay","Agglutination_(biology)","Von_Willebrand_disease","Von_Willebrand_Factor","Von_Willebrand_Factor","Ristocetin_Cofactor_assay","Formalin-fixed","Platelet","Ristocetin_Induced_Platelet_Aggregation","Absorbance","Chemiluminiscence","Photodiode","Photomultiplier_tube","Charge_coupled_device","Radioisotope","Radioimmunoassay","GM_counter","X-ray_plate","Photostimulated_luminescence","Polymerase_Chain_Reaction","Enzyme_Immuno_assay","Enzyme_linked_immunosorbent_assay","Virtual_Colony_Count","Laser","Fluorescent","Agglutination_(biology)","Thromboelastography","Flowcytometry","Coulter_principle","Amperometry","Voltametry","Coulometry","Osmometer","Viscometer","Ion_Selective_electrode","Interaction","Proteins","DNA","DNase_footprinting_assay","Filter_binding_assay","Gel_shift_assay","Bicinchoninic_acid_assay","Bradford_protein_assay","Lowry_protein_assay","Secretion_assay","Nuclear_run-on","Red_blood_cell","White_blood_cell","Blood_cell","Cell_culture","Cell_culture_assays","Chemical_compound","Cell_(biology)","MTT_assay","Sulforhodamine_B","CASY_cell_counting_technology","Coulter_counter","Electric_cell-substrate_impedance_sensing","Viability_assay","ATP_test","Ethidium_homodimer_assay","Bacteriological_water_analysis","Clonogenic_assay","MBAS_assay","Surfactant","Biomarker","Cell_biology","Luciferase","Coelenterazine","Carboxyfluorescein_succinimidyl_ester","Calcein","Immunostaining","Microscopy","Immunohistochemical_staining","Microplate","Photometry_(optics)","ELISPOT","FluoroSpot","Flow_cytometry","Immunostaining","Microscopy","Microplate","Molecular_biology","DNA_microarray","In_situ_hybridization","PCR","Computational_genomics","Transfection","Cell_fractionation","Immunoprecipitation","Migration_assay","Chemotaxis_assay","Secretion_assay","Apoptosis","DNA_laddering","Nicoletti_assay","Caspase","Annexin_V","Chemosensitivity_assay","Tetramer_assay","Gentamicin_protection_assay","Crude_oil_assay","HPCE-based_viral_titer_assay","Capillary_electrophoresis","Baculovirus","Titer","Trofile_assay","HIV_tropism","Plaque_assay","Virus","Viral_plaque","Antibody","Cytokine","ELISA","ELISPOT","Drug_test","Analytic_sensitivity","Functional_sensitivity","Analytic_specificity","Positive_predictive_value","Negative_predictive_value","Turn_around_time","Thruput","Quality_assurance","Method_validation","Callibration","Analytical_quality_control","Proficiency_testing","Accreditation","Licensing","Analytical_chemistry","MELISA","Multiplex_(assay)","Pharmaceutical_chemistry","Titration"]}
