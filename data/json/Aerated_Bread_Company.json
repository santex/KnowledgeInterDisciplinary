Its aim was to mass\nproduce healthy, additive-free breads using a new bread leavening technology\ninvented by the company's founder. Dauglish's system was a yeast-free, carbonic\nacid gas (i.e., carbon dioxide) method of bread making: \"Nothing but flour,\nwater, a little salt and gasâno sweat! It was liked by many.\" Rosling-\nBennett, Alfred. London and Londoners in the 1850s and 1860s. 1924. As quoted in\nJackson, Lee.
