{"cursor":"2299","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nIn the game of poker, a betting round is said to be 'closed' if no player will\nhave the right to raise in the round. Normally this occurs when a player calls,\nand the next player whose turn it is to act is the one who made the last raise,\nso he cannot raise further (this ends the betting round). The round can also\nsaid to be closed before it has actually ended if there are still players\nremaining to act, but they will not be entitled to raise either because the last\nraise was a sub-minimum all-in raise (see poker table stakes rules) or because\nthe limit (\"cap\") on allowed raises has been reached.\n\nThe term is also used to describe a category of poker game in which no cards\nheld by individual players are visible to any other player before the showdown.\nMost forms of draw poker are closed games (draw games with a rollout are an\nexception). Most forms of stud poker, in contrast, are open games, because some\nplayers' cards are dealt face up or are exposed during play (blind stud games\nare an exception). Most community card poker games like Texas hold 'em are\nconsidered closed as well, because the only cards exposed before showdown belong\nto everyone; the individual players' cards are never seen until showdown.\n","linknr":91,"url":"Closed_(poker)","recorded":1362552420,"links":12,"instances":["poker","poker","poker","poker","poker","poker"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Poker gameplay and terminology"],"headings":["Strategic implications"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["raise","poker"],["showdown","poker"],["rollout","poker"],["open","poker"],["river","poker"],["bluff","poker"]],"members":["open","rollout","river","bluff","showdown","raise"],"related":["Poker","Raise_(poker)","Poker_table_stakes_rules","Showdown_(poker)","Draw_poker","Rollout_(poker)","Stud_poker","Open_(poker)","Community_card_poker","Texas_hold_'em","Smooth_call","River_(poker)","Pot_odds","Bluff_(poker)"]}
