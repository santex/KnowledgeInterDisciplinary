It is also the site of the highest\ntonnage port in Australia.\n\nPort Hedland has a natural deep anchorage harbour which, as well as being the\nmain fuel and container receival point for the region, was seen as perfect for\nshipment of the iron ore being mined in the ranges located inland from the town.\nThe ore is moved by railway lines from four major iron ore deposits to the east\nand south of Port Hedland area. In August 2010 the port exported 13.6 million\ntonnes of iron ore. {{cite web|url=http://www.hellenicshippingnews.com/inde-\nx.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=120648&Itemid=79 |accessdate=15 September\n2010 |title=Port Hedland Aug iron ore exports fall 7.1 pct m/m |date=14\nSeptember 2010 }}\n\nOther major resource activities supported by the town include the offshore\nnatural gas fields, salt, manganese, and livestock. Grazing of cattle and sheep\nwas formerly a major revenue earner for the region but this has slowly declined.\nPort Hedland was also formerly the terminus for the WAGR Marble Bar Railway\nwhich serviced the gold mining area of Marble Bar.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Port_Hedland","recorded":1372152296,"links":[],"instances":["port_hedland","western_australia"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Port Hedland, Western Australia|","Mining towns in Western Australia","Port cities in Australia","Ports and harbours of Western Australia","Coastal towns in Western Australia"],"headings":["History","Geography and climate","Infrastructure","Fauna and Flora","Blackrock Stakes","See also","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["swan_river","western_australia"],["silver_star_cafe","port_hedland"]],"members":["silver_star_cafe","swan_river"],"related":["Australian_Western_Standard_Time","Electoral_district_of_Pilbara","Division_of_Durack","Perth","Pilbara_region_of_Western_Australia","South_Hedland,_Western_Australia","Port_of_Port_Hedland","Iron_ore","Railway","Natural_gas","Cattle","Sheep","Western_Australian_Government_Railways","Marble_Bar_Railway","Marble_Bar,_Western_Australia","Indigenous_Australians","Soakage","Dreamtime","Turning_basin","Swan_River_(Western_Australia)","Roebourne,_Western_Australia","Charles_Wedge","Cossack,_Western_Australia","Goldsworthy,_Western_Australia","Iron_ore","Mount_Whaleback","Newman,_Western_Australia","Vickers_Viscount","MacRobertson_Miller_Airlines","Indee_Station","Immigration_detention","Boat_people","BHP_Billiton","Tropical_cyclone","South_Hedland,_Western_Australia","Dampier_Salt","Rio_Tinto_Group","Flatback_Sea_Turtle","Indo-Pacific_bottlenose_dolphin","Humpback_dolphin","Australian_Snubfin_Dolphin","Port_Hedland_Saltworks_Important_Bird_Area","Red-necked_Stint","Sharp-tailed_Sandpiper","Dusky_Gerygone","Broad-billed_Sandpiper","Asian_Dowitcher","Curlew_Sandpiper","Red-necked_Avocet","Banded_Stilt","Oriental_Plover","Oriental_Pratincole","White-winged_Black_Tern","Australian_Bustard","Bush_Stone-curlew","Western_Bowerbird","Painted_Finch","Canary_White-eye","Mangroves","Whim_Creek","Iron_ore","Iron_ore","Don_Rhodes_Mining_and_Transport_Museum","Pilbara_historical_timeline","Pilbara_newspapers","Port_Hedland_International_Airport","Port_Hedland_Saltworks_Important_Bird_Area","Silver_Star_Cafe_(Port_Hedland)"]}
