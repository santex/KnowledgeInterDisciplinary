{"cursor":"3622","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nThe 'Express Payment System', more commonly known as the 'EPS', was the EFTPOS\nsystem originally of the ATM cards of Bank of the Philippine Islands and its\nsubsidiaries, BPI Family Savings Bank and BPI Direct Savings Bank. Today, it is\nthe EFTPOS system of the Expressnet interbank network in the Philippines. The\nsystem is the most popular EFTPOS system for ATM cardholders in the Philippines\nand is accepted nationwide. Rivals of the network include MegaLink's PayLink and\nthe similarly named BancNet Payment System (BPS).\n\nAlthough the Philippines is largely still a cash-based society, the EPS is\nslowly but surely getting widespread prominence. Since its launch, it has\nexpanded to be found in many stores nationwide and has since expanded from its\nroots with BPI, which also pioneered Expressnet. In fact, the EPS is no longer\nlimited to shopping: the EPS can also be used for things such as paying doctor's\nfees or paying for a haircut with the swipe of one's ATM card. Currently, there\nare more than 13,000 EPS merchants throughout the Philippines.\n\nIn 2005, the EPS expanded to include the ATM cards of Banco de Oro and Land\nBank of the Philippines, both Expressnet members. However, many EPS merchants\nclaim that their EPS terminal works only with BPI ATM cards or do not know how\nto use Banco de Oro or Landbank cards with the EPS terminal; this is because\nvirtually all EPS terminals are BPI terminals (Banco de Oro and Landbank EPS\nterminals debuted just recently). Also, Banco de Oro and Landbank ATM cards,\nunlike BPI ATM cards, cannot be directly swiped on an EPS terminal. In order to\nuse these cards, an EPS merchant must enter the number 7 on the main screen\nthen swipe the card to use these ATM cards. As of 2005, HSBC and its\nsubsidiary, HSBC Savings Bank, although both members of Expressnet, do not\nparticipate in the EPS system, meaning that HSBC and HSBC Savings Bank ATM\ncards cannot be used on an EPS terminal.\n\nIn addition to functioning as an ATM EFTPOS terminal, EPS terminals also accept\nBPI credit, debit and prepaid cards. However, these transactions are considered\nas BPI Express Credit transactions and not as EPS transactions.\n\nBanco de Oro has its own terminal independent of the EPS either branded under\nthe SM name or under its own name. Terminals under either name accept all Banco\nde Oro cards (Smarteller ATM card and derivatives, BDO Gift Card, BDO Cash Card\nand BDO credit cards) and have the functions of an EPS terminal. Terminals under\nthe SM name, however, have extended capabilities such as having the capabilities\nof an EPS, PayLink and BPS terminal (and even the ATM cards of non-affiliated\nbanks) all in one as well as the acceptance of other banks' credit, debit and\nprepaid cards.\n\nThe terminal can be found depending on the name. Terminals under the SM name can\nbe found in all SM stores, such as their supermarkets, department stores and\nstores such as Surplus Shop and Toy Kingdom. Terminals under the Banco de Oro\nname can be found in businesses that accept Banco de Oro cards before Banco de\nOro joined the EPS. Some merchants though still use the Banco de Oro terminal.\n","linknr":95,"url":"Express_Payment_System","recorded":1374546992,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Express_Payment_System&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Express_Payment_System&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:EPS_Merchants.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/6b/EPS_Merchants.png","/wiki/EFTPOS","/wiki/Automatic_teller_machine","/wiki/Bank_of_the_Philippine_Islands","/wiki/BPI_Direct_Savings_Bank","/wiki/Expressnet","/wiki/Interbank_network","/wiki/Philippines","/wiki/MegaLink","/wiki/BancNet_Payment_System","/wiki/Cash","/wiki/Society","/wiki/Bank_of_the_Philippine_Islands","/wiki/Banco_de_Oro","/wiki/Land_Bank_of_the_Philippines","/wiki/HSBC","/wiki/Credit_card","/wiki/Debit_card","/wiki/Stored-value_card","/wiki/SM_Prime_Holdings","/wiki/Toy_Kingdom","/w/index.php?title=Express_Payment_System&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Bank_of_the_Philippine_Islands","/wiki/Expressnet","/w/index.php?title=Express_Payment_System&action=edit&section=2","http://www.mybpimag.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=159&Itemid=189","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Express_Payment_System&oldid=461924611","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Payment_systems","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Express+Payment+System&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Express+Payment+System","/wiki/Express_Payment_System","/w/index.php?title=Talk:Express_Payment_System&action=edit&redlink=1","#","/wiki/Express_Payment_System","/w/index.php?title=Express_Payment_System&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Express_Payment_System&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Express_Payment_System","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Express_Payment_System","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Express_Payment_System&oldid=461924611","/w/index.php?title=Express_Payment_System&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5421674","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Express_Payment_System&id=461924611","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Express+Payment+System","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Express+Payment+System&oldid=461924611&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Express_Payment_System&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5421674#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Express_Payment_System","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Payment
