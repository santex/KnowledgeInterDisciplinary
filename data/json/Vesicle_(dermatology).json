{"cursor":"24286","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nA 'cutaneous condition' is any medical condition that affects the integumentary\nsystem â the organ system that encloses the body and includes skin, hair, nails,\nand related muscle and glands. The major function\nof this system is as a barrier against the external environment.\n\nConditions of the human integumentary system constitute a broad spectrum of\ndiseases, also known as dermatoses, as well as many nonpathologic states (like,\nin certain circumstances, melanonychia and racquet nails). While only a small number of skin\ndiseases account for most visits to the physician, thousands of skin conditions\nhave been described. Classification of these conditions\noften presents many nosological challenges, since underlying etiologies and\npathogenetics are often not known. Therefore, most current textbooks present a\nclassification based on location (for example, conditions of the mucous\nmembrane), morphology (chronic blistering conditions), etiology (skin conditions\nresulting from physical factors), and so on.\n\nClinically, the diagnosis of any particular skin condition is made by gathering\npertinent information regarding the presenting skin lesion(s), including the\nlocation (such as arms, head, legs), symptoms (pruritus, pain), duration (acute\nor chronic), arrangement (solitary, generalized, annular, linear), morphology\n(macules, papules, vesicles), and color (red, blue, brown, black, white,\nyellow). The diagnosis of many conditions often also\nrequires a skin biopsy which yields histologic information that can be correlated\nwith the clinical presentation and any laboratory data.\n","linknr":989,"url":"Vesicle_(dermatology)","recorded":1362560045,"links":34,"instances":["anatomy","dermatopathology","dermatology","target","medical","dermatopathology","dermatology","anatomy","skin"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Cutaneous conditions|"],"headings":["Where cutaneous conditions occur","Diseases of the skin","History","Approach to diagnoses","Histopathology","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/TrombiculosisSores.jpg/220px-TrombiculosisSores.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/Nodules.svg/220px-Nodules.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ab/Macule_and_Patch.svg/220px-Macule_and_Patch.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1e/Papule_and_Plaque.svg/220px-Papule_and_Plaque.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/Vesicles_and_Bulla.svg/220px-Vesicles_and_Bulla.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/Ulcers%2C_fissures%2C_and_erosions.svg/220px-Ulcers%2C_fissures%2C_and_erosions.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["nail","anatomy"],["epidermis","skin"],["lobe","anatomy"],["epidermis","skin"],["evanescent","dermatology"],["abrasion","medical"],["bullseye","target"],["evanescent","dermatology"],["exocytosis","dermatopathology"],["erosion","dermatopathology"],["ulcer","dermatology"]],"members":["nail","exocytosis","ulcer","bullseye","abrasion","erosion","evanescent","lobe","epidermis"],"related":["Medical_condition","Integumentary_system","Organ_system","Human_body","Skin","Hair","Nail_(anatomy)","Muscle","Glands","Melanonychia","Racquet_nails","Physician","Nosological","Pruritus","Papule","Skin_biopsy","Histologic","Epidermis_(skin)","Dermis","Subcutaneous_tissue","Glabrous_skin","Pilosebaceous_unit","Hair_follicle","Sebaceous_gland","Arrector_pili","Embryology","Ectoderm","Mesoderm","Epithelium","Stratum","Stratum_corneum","Stratum_lucidum","Stratum_granulosum","Stratum_spinosum","Stratum_germinativum","Diffusion","Keratinocyte","Melanocyte","Langerhans_cell","Merkel_cell","Papillary_dermis","Reticular_dermis","Rete_ridge","Collagen","Elastic_fiber","Ground_substance","Eccrine_gland","Apocrine_gland","Fascia","Panniculus_adiposus","Panniculus_carnosus","Adipocyte","Lobe_(anatomy)","Skin_infection","Skin_neoplasm","Skin_cancer","Geronimo_Mercuriali","Forlì","Italy","Serous","Seropurulent","Epidermis_(skin)","Evanescent_(dermatology)","Keratin","Abrasion_(medical)","Papillary_dermis","Herpes","Bullseye_(target)","Varicella_zoster_virus","Chicken_pox","Herpes_zoster","Measles","Blaschko's_lines","Blackhead","Confluency","Eczema","Evanescent_(dermatology)","Granuloma","Livedo","Purpura","Erythema","Poikiloderma","Hyperkeratosis","Parakeratosis","Hypergranulosis","Acanthosis","Papillomatosis","Dyskeratosis","Acantholysis","Spongiosis","Hydropic_swell","Exocytosis_(dermatopathology)","Vacuolization","Erosion_(dermatopathology)","Ulcer_(dermatology)","Lentigo","Dermatology","List_of_dermatologists","List_of_cutaneous_conditions"]}
