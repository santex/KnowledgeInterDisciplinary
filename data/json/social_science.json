      "text" : "\n\n\n'Social science' refers to the academic disciplines concerned with the society\nand the relationships of individuals within a society, which primarily rely on\nempirical approaches. It is commonly used as an umbrella term to refer to\nanthropology, economics, psychology and sociology. In a wider sense, it may\noften include humanities<ref name=oed>\"humanity\" 2.b, Oxford English Dictionary\n3rd Ed. (2003)</ref> such as archaeology, area studies, communication studies,\ncultural studies, folkloristics, history, law, linguistics, political science,\nand rhetoric. The term may however be used in the specific context of referring\nto the original science of society, established in 19th century, sociology\n(Latin: [[wiktionary:socius|socius]], \"companion\"; Greek , lógos, \"word\",\n\"knowledge\", \"study.\"). Émile Durkheim, Karl Marx and Max Weber are typically\ncited as the principal architects of modern social science by this\ndefinition.<ref>[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/weber/ Max Weber - Stanford\nEncyclopaedia of Philosophy]</ref>\n\nPositivist social scientists use methods resembling those of the natural\nsciences as tools for understanding society, and so define science in its\nstricter modern sense. Interpretivist social scientists, by contrast, may use\nsocial critique or symbolic interpretation rather than constructing empirically\nfalsifiable theories, and thus treat science in its broader sense. In modern\nacademic practice, researchers are often eclectic, using multiple methodologies\n(for instance, by combining the quantitative and qualitative techniques). The\nterm social research has also acquired a degree of autonomy as practitioners\nfrom various disciplines share in its aims and methods.\n",
