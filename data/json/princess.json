      "text" : "\n\n\n\n\n'Princess' is the feminine form of prince (from Latin [[princeps]], meaning\ncitizen). Most often, the term has been used for the consort of a prince or for\nthe daughters of a king or sovereign prince.\n\nFor many centuries, the title \"princess\" was not regularly used for a monarch's\ndaughter, who might simply be called \"Lady\" or a non-English equivalent. Old\nEnglish had no female equivalent of \"prince\", \"earl\", or any royal or noble\ntitle aside from queen. Royal women, or women of the nobility, were simply\naddressed or referred to as \"Lady\" or \"The Lady Firstname\" for a particularly\nhighborn woman.\n\nAs women slowly gained more autonomy and respect in European history, the title\nof princess became simply the female counterpart of prince; it does not\nnecessarily imply being merely married to a prince, she may be the unmarried\ndaughter of a monarch or other royal or noble of sufficient rank (king, queen,\nprince, grand duke, duke, or other). Further, a princess may be a hereditary\nsovereign, head of state in her own right.\n\nThe traditional meaning still applies in Europe in the sense that an untitled or\nat least non-royal woman who marries a prince will almost always become a\nprincess with the possibility of eventually becoming Queen Consort, in nations\nwhere that title exists; but a man who marries a princess will almost never\nbecome a prince, unless his wife is expected to inherit the higher title of\nQueen regnant. If that is the case, then on her inheritance of that sovereign\ntitle, he will often become a prince (or remain one if he was already a prince).\n\nIn many of Europe's royal families, a king would grant his heirs actual or\ntheoretical principalities to train them for future kingship or to give them\nsocial class. This practice has led over time to many people thinking that\n\"prince\" and \"princess\" are titles reserved for the immediate family of a king\nor queen. In fact, most princesses in history were not immediate members of a\nroyal family but rather women who married into it.\n",
