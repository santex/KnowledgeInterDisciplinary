It is the second-largest extant bird in the world by height, after\nits ratite relative, the ostrich. There are three subspecies of emus in\nAustralia. The emu is common over most of mainland Australia, although it avoids\nheavily populated areas, dense forest, and arid areas.<ref name=\"Davies2\" />\n\nThe soft-feathered, brown, flightless birds reach up to in height. They have\nlong thin necks and legs. Emus can travel great distances at a fast, economical\ntrot and, if necessary, can sprint at .<ref></ref> Their long legs allow them to\ntake strides of up to <ref name = \"Davies2\"></ref> They are opportunistically\nnomadic and may travel long distances to find food; they feed on a variety of\nplants and insects, but have been known to go for weeks without food. Emus\ningest stones, glass shards and bits of metal to grind food in the digestive\nsystem. They drink infrequently, but take in copious fluids when the opportunity\narises. Emus will sit in water and are also able to swim. They are curious birds\nwho are known to follow and watch other animals and humans. Emus do not sleep\ncontinuously at night but in several short stints sitting down.\n\nEmus use their strongly clawed feet as a defence mechanism. Their legs are among\nthe strongest of any animal, allowing them to rip metal wire fences. They are\nendowed with good eyesight and hearing, which allows them to detect predators in\nthe vicinity. The plumage varies regionally, matching the surrounding\nenvironment and improving its camouflage. The feather structure prevents heat\nfrom flowing into the skin, permitting Emus to be active during the midday heat.\nThey can tolerate a wide range of temperatures and thermoregulate effectively.\nMales and females are hard to distinguish visually, but can be differentiated by\nthe types of loud sounds they emit by manipulating an inflatable neck sac. Emus\nbreed in May and June and are not monogamous; fighting among females for a mate\nis common. Females can mate several times and lay several batches of eggs in one\nseason. The animals put on weight before the breeding season, and the male does\nmost of the incubation, losing significant weight during this time as he does\nnot eat. The eggs hatch after around eight weeks, and the young are nurtured by\ntheir fathers. They reach full size after around six months, but can remain with\ntheir family until the next breeding season half a year later. Emus can live\nbetween 10 and 20 years in the wild and are predated by dingos, eagles and\nhawks. They can jump and kick to avoid dingos, but against eagles and hawks,\nthey can only run and swerve.\n\nThe Tasmanian Emu and King Island Emu subspecies that previously inhabited\nTasmania and King Island became extinct after the European settlement of\nAustralia in 1788, and the distribution of the mainland subspecies has been\ninfluenced by human activities. Once common on the east coast, emus are now\nuncommon there; by contrast, the development of agriculture and the provision of\nwater for stock in the interior of the continent have increased the range of the\nemu in arid regions, and it is of Least Concern for conservation. They were a\nfood and fuel source for indigenous Australians and early European settlers.\nEmus are farmed for their meat, oil, and leather. Emu is a lean meat and while\nit is often claimed by marketers that the oil has anti-inflammatory and anti-\noxidative effects, this has not been scientifically verified in humans. The emu\nis an important cultural icon of Australia. It appears on the coat of arms,\nvarious coins, features prominently in Indigenous Australian mythology, and\nhundreds of places are named after the bird.\n",
