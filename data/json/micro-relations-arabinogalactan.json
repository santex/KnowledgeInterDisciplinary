Two classes of arabinogalactans are found in nature: plant\narabinogalactan and microbial arabinogalactan. In plants, it is a major\ncomponent of many gums, including gum arabic and gum gutti. It is often found\nattached to proteins, and the resulting arabinogalactan protein (AGP) functions\nas both an intercellular signaling molecule and a glue to seal plant wounds.\n\nThe microbial arabinogalactan is a major structural component of the\nmycobacterial cell wall.\n\n{{cite book\n| last = Esko first = Jeffrey D. authorlink = coauthors = Tamara L.
