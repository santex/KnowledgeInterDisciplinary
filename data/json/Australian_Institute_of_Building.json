It has chapter\noffices in Hong Kong and Singapore and had a chapter office in New Zealand until\nthe formation of the New Zealand Institute of Building in 1984. [http://www.aib.org.au/about/AIB-\nHistory.htm AIB Website]\n\nServing building professionals, it has helped create standards for professional\ncompetency and regulation of education standards for the various educational\nprograms related to its mission. It has played the lead role in the\nestablishment of all building and construction management undergraduate programs\noffered by Australian universities. Founded in 1951, incorporated in 1955 and\ngranted a Royal Charter in 1969, the Australian Institute of Building (AIB) is\nan association of building professionals, associate professionals and\ntechnicians engaged in building practice, teaching or research throughout\nAustralia and overseas.\n\nThe mission of AIB is to be a leading body of focus for the building industry,\nvalued for its services to its members, reflecting its ideals for education,\nstandards and ethics and the source of authoritative and visionary comment on\nbehalf of professionals in the industry. Its objectives are: to promote\nexcellence in the construction of buildings and just and honourable practices in\nthe conduct of business; to advance the study of Building and all kindred\nmatters, arts and sciences; to encourage the friendly exchange between members\nof knowledge in practical, technical and ethical subjects; and to uphold the\ndignity of the profession of Building and the status of the Institute.\n\nFollowing World War II the building industry was confronted with a huge\nprogramme of civil and commercial building. This called for improved\nproductivity, more intelligent use of resources available and the development of\nnew techniques and new material. Leaders of the industry appreciated that\nbuilding was developing from empirical craft processes to a technological\ndiscipline spanning physical sciences and involving construction techniques\nwhich were unknown in the early part of the 20th Century. Development in the\nscience of environment and building services had also added a new dimension to\nbuilding technology.\n\nAs building involved investment of public and private capital to a greater\nextent than any other commodity, rational, economic and efficient working was\nessential. Skill in the management of building work is as important as the\ntechnology itself. A trend to higher educational standards and a more positive\napproach to training executive and technical staff of Building organisations was\nclearly required.\n\nThe effect of this impact on the building industry was to highlight the\nneed for a professional body to promote efficiency and establish a high\nstandard of technological education for those engaged on the construction\nside of the industry.\n\nA 'Committee of Investigation' was set up in 1947 by a convention called by the\nthen Master Builders' Federation of Australia (MBFA) which, although firmly\nestablished since 1890, was not acceptable as a professional body because it was\nan employers' organisation. There was agreement that an Institute should be\nconstituted on professional lines to represent the construction side of the\nbuilding industry, and both the Royal Australian Institute of Architects (RAIA)\nand the Institution of Engineers Australia (IEAust) agreed to assist in\nselecting the foundation membership.\n\nThe Australian Institute of Builders was established in 1951 with a foundation\nmembership determined by a selection committee in each state, comprising two\nrepresentatives of the RAIA, one representative of the IEAust and two\nrepresentatives of the MBFA. The Foundation Members also included members of\nthe Building Diplomats Association of NSW, associated with the Sydney\nTechnical College.\n\nIn 23 November 1951 the Foundation Dinner was held in Sydney and the then Mr\nRobert Menzies, Prime Minister of Australia, was presented with a Certificate of\nHonorary Membership. The Institute was incorporated on 15 November 1955, granted\nArmorial Bearings on 20 August 1960 and incorporated by Royal Charter on 7\nOctober 1969, despite the protests of the CIOB(UK). It had, on 26 May 1967,\nchanged its name to The Australian Institute of Building (AIB).\n\nHaving established itself and received recognition accorded by a Royal Charter,\nthe Institute began to redefine its educational requirements at Licentiate and\nCorporate grade. It then set about ensuring that the then degree and certificate\ncourses in building which were available met the standards which the Institute\nrequired. From this has developed a course assessment/qualification\naccreditation system which has proven to be of great value to academic\ninstitutions and the industry.\n\nWhile graduates in building were recognised immediately by the private sector,\nrecognition in the public sector was harder to achieve. The breakthrough came in\n1977 with the recognition by the Public Service Board of Degrees in Building for\nthe positions of Project Manager Class 1-3, Area Manager Class 1-3 and\nConstruction Manager. Recognition of the AIB as a professional institute was\naccorded in the Commonwealth Gazette in March 1983. This approval, under the\nIndustrial Research and Development Incentives Act, recognises Corporate members\nof the Institute as professionally qualified.\n\nSince its establishment in 1968 the Australian Institute of Building Research\nand Education Foundation has funded developments in education and specific\nresearch projects. One of these projects determined the duties and\nresponsibilities of, and the levels of competence required by, professionals and\ntechnicians in the Building industry. In 1990 the AIB became an Associate of the\nInternational Council for Building Research (CIB). The AIB Papers, a journal of\nrefereed academic papers, has been published by the Institute since 1986.\n\nThe By-laws and Regulations were amended to allow for changes to grades of\nmember in 1981, 1992 and 1997.\n\nWith the Foundation of a New Zealand Institute of Building (NZIOB) in 1984, the\nNew Zealand Chapter of the AIB was closed down. The AIB continues to have a\nclose relationship with NZIOB.\n\nIn 1997 the AIB became a foundation member of the International Association for\nthe Professional Management of Construction (IAPMC).\n\nSo as to streamline management decisions, in 1996 the Council delegated most of\nits authority to an Executive Board of Management.\n\nPending development of industry wide competency based standards, the Institute\nproduced standards for its own membership purposes. These standards are also\nused for assessing applicants for the National Building Professionals Register\n(NBPR) which the AIB launched in 1997.\n\nA Hong Kong Chapter and Singapore Chapter were established in 1998, and AIB's\noverseas operations expanded considerably ten years later.\n\nAIB is also the convenor of the Australian Building and Construction Higher\nEducation Round Table, the peak body to bring together the construction industry\nand Australian universities.\n\nHRH Prince Philip is an Honorary Fellow.
