Founded\nas Pittsburgh Academy in 1787 on what was then the American frontier, Pitt is\none of the oldest continuously chartered institutions of higher education in the\nUnited States. Pitt evolved into the Western University of Pennsylvania with an\nalteration to its charter in 1819, and upon relocating to its current campus in\nthe Oakland neighborhood of Pittsburgh in 1908, the school received its current\nmoniker, the University of Pittsburgh. For most of its history Pitt was a\nprivate institution, until it became part of the Commonwealth System of Higher\nEducation in 1966.\n\nPitt has consistently placed in the top cluster of U.S. public research\nuniversities and among the overall top 25 research universities according to the\n[[Center for Measuring University Performance]],\nis listed as one of [[U.S. News & World Report]]'s top 20 public\nuniversities, and has been listed among the best\ncolleges for the quality of life of its students. Pitt has\nalso been named as a \"best value\" by various publications, and has\nappeared in multiple rankings of the world's top universities.\n\nPitt is among the nation's and world's most active research institutions as\nevidenced by its $899 million in annual research expenditures, its receipt\nof the fifth largest amount of federally sponsored research funding among U.S.\nuniversities, and its election as one of the 62 North American members of the\nAssociation of American Universities. Pitt and its medical school are also closely affiliated\nwith the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, one of the nation's leading\nacademic medical centers.\n\nPitt is popularly recognized for its centerpiece building, the Cathedral of\nLearning, for its central role in developing the first polio vaccine, and for\nfielding nationally competitive NCAA Division I athletic
