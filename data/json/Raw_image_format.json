Raw files are named so because they are not yet processed and therefore\nare not ready to be printed or edited with a bitmap graphics editor. Normally,\nthe image is processed by a raw converter in a wide-gamut internal colorspace\nwhere precise adjustments can be made before conversion to a \"positive\" file\nformat such as TIFF or JPEG for storage, printing, or further manipulation,\nwhich often encodes the image in a device-dependent colorspace. There are dozens\nif not hundreds of raw formats in use by different models of digital equipment\n(like cameras or film\nscanners). [http://www.cybercom.net/%7Edcoffin/dcraw/#i18n Decoding raw\ndigital photos in Linux ]\n\nRaw image files are sometimes called 'digital negatives', as they fulfill the\nsame role as negatives in film photography: that is, the negative is not\ndirectly usable as an image, but has all of the information needed to create an\nimage. Likewise, the process of converting a raw image file into a viewable\nformat is sometimes called developing a raw image, by analogy with the film\ndevelopment process used to convert photographic film into viewable prints. The\nselection of the final choice of image rendering is part of the process of white\nbalancing and color grading.\n\nLike a photographic negative, a raw digital image may have a wider dynamic range\nor color gamut than the eventual final image format, and it preserves most of\nthe information of the captured image. The purpose of raw image formats is to\nsave, with minimum loss of information, data obtained from the sensor, and the\nconditions surrounding the capturing of the image (the metadata).\n","linknr":712,"url":"Raw_image_format","recorded":1362538453,"links":48,"instances":["colour_theory","company","computing","company","file_format","optics","software","colour","vision","software_platform","software","data_format","image_processing","company","photography"],"pdf":["http://www.adobe.com/products/dng/pdfs/dng_spec_1_3_0_0.pdf","http://www.adobe.com/products/dng/pdfs/dng_spec.pdf","http://www.adobe.com/products/dng/pdfs/dng_spec.pdf","http://www.npes.org/pdf/TC130WG2N1363_Minutes-Beijing-Sept09.pdf","http://mysite.verizon.net/rajeevramanath/Research/pipeline-SPM-05.pdf","http://mysite.verizon.net/rajeevramanath/Research/pipeline-SPM-05.pdf","http://www.accidentalmark.com/research/tutorial/ICIP2008/Hirakawa08ICIPTutorial_Handout.pdf","http://www.accidentalmark.com/research/tutorial/ICIP2008/Hirakawa08ICIPTutorial_Handout.pdf","http://www.adobe.com/products/dng/pdfs/dng_spec.pdf","http://www.adobe.com/products/dng/pdfs/dng_spec.pdf","http://www.adobe.com/digitalimag/pdfs/understanding_digitalrawcapture.pdf"],"categories":["Graphics
