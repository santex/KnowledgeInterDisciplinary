{"cursor":"9434","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'National Assembly' is either a legislature, or the lower house of a bicameral\nlegislature in some countries. The best known National Assembly, and the first\nlegislature to be known by this title, was that established during the French\nRevolution in 1789, known as the [[National Assembly (French\nRevolution)|AssemblÃ©e nationale]]. Consequently, the name is particularly common\nin Francophone countries, but is also found in some Commonwealth countries. In\nGermany, a Nationalversammlung was elected following the revolutions of\n1848â1849 and 1918â1919, to be replaced by a permanent parliament (Reichstag)\nlater. The legislature of the Estado Novo regime in Portugal was known as the\nNational Assembly, while the Corporative Chamber was a purely advisory chamber.\n\nIt was also the name of the legislature during France's First Republic and the\nConsulate, and since 1946 has been the lower house of the French parliament,\nfirst under the Fourth Republic, and from 1958, the Fifth Republic. The national\nassembly was also defined in the Republic of China constitution. This is\ndifferent from the Legislative Yuan by the ROC constitution. In 2005, Taiwan\nrevised the constitution and national assembly becomes history.\n","linknr":373,"url":"National_Assembly","recorded":1362543847,"links":37,"instances":["portugal","political_meeting","disambiguation"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Legislatures"],"headings":["Unicameral
