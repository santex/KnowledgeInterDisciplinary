{"cursor":"33701","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n'Senses' are physiological capacities of organisms that provide data for\nperception. The senses and their operation, classification, and theory are\noverlapping topics studied by a variety of fields, most notably neuroscience,\ncognitive psychology (or cognitive science), and philosophy of perception. The\nnervous system has a specific sensory system or organ, dedicated to each sense.\n\nHuman beings have a multitude of senses. Sight (ophthalmoception), hearing\n(audioception), taste (gustaoception), smell (olfacoception or olfacception),\nand touch (tactioception) are the five traditionally recognized. While the\nability to detect other stimuli beyond those governed by the traditional senses\nexists, including temperature (thermoception), kinesthetic sense\n(proprioception), pain (nociception), balance (equilibrioception), acceleration\n(kinesthesioception), and various internal stimuli (e.g. the different\nchemoreceptors for detecting salt and carbon dioxide concentrations in the\nblood), only a small number of these can safely be classified as separate senses\nin and of themselves. What constitutes a sense is a matter of some debate,\nleading to difficulties in defining what exactly a sense is.\n\nAnimals also have receptors to sense the world around them, with degrees of\ncapability varying greatly between species. Humans have a comparatively weak\nsense of smell, while some animals may lack one or more of the traditional five\nsenses. Some animals may also intake and interpret sensory stimuli in very\ndifferent ways. Some species of animals are able to sense the world in a way\nthat humans cannot, with some species able to sense electrical and magnetic\nfields, and detect water pressure and currents.\n","linknr":611,"url":"Sense","recorded":1362479219,"links":71,"instances":["knowledge","human","ear","instrument","psychology","biology"],"pdf":["http://www.roblesdelatorre.com/gabriel/GR-IEEE-MM-2006.pdf"],"categories":["Perception","Sensory
