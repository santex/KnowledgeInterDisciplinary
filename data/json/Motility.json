{"cursor":"2701","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n'Motility' is a biological term which refers to the ability to move\nspontaneously and actively, consuming energy in the process. Most animals are\nmotile but the term applies to unicellular and simple multicellular organisms,\nas well as to some mechanisms of fluid flow in multicellular organs, in addition\nto animal locomotion. Motile marine animals are commonly called 'free-swimming'.\n\nThe opposite of motility is sessility.\n\nMotility may also refer to an organism's ability to move food through its\ndigestive tract, i.e., peristaltics (gut motility, intestinal motility, etc.). http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/179937-\noverview\n","linknr":151,"url":"Motility","recorded":1362676051,"links":31,"instances":["zoology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Physiology","Cell movement"],"headings":["Cellular-level motility","Movements","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Blue_morpho_butterfly.jpg/30px-Blue_morpho_butterfly.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["sessility","zoology"]],"members":["sessility"],"related":["Biology","Animal","Unicellular_organism","Multicellular_organism","Animal_locomotion","Marine_animal","Sessility_(zoology)","Peristaltics","Flagellar_motility","Spermatozoa","Flagellum","Amoeboid_movement","Gliding_motility","Swarming_motility","Chemotaxis","Thermotaxis","Phototaxis","Magnetotaxis","Galvanotaxis","Gravitaxis","Durotaxis","Haptotaxis","Biopolymer","Cell_migration"]}
