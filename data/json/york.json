city, situated at the confluence of the Rivers Ouse and Foss in North\nYorkshire, England. The city has a rich heritage and has provided the backdrop\nto major political events throughout much of its two millennia of existence. The\ncity offers a wealth of historic attractions, of which York Minster is the most\nprominent, and a variety of cultural and sporting activities.\n\nThe city was founded by the Romans in 71&nbsp;AD, under the name of Eboracum. It\nbecame in turn the capital of the Roman province of Britannia Inferior, and of\nthe kingdoms of Northumbria and Jorvik. In the Middle Ages, York grew as a major\nwool trading centre and became the capital of the northern ecclesiastical\nprovince of the Church of England, a role it has retained.<ref name =\n\"timeline\"/>\n\nIn the 19th&nbsp;century, York became a hub of the railway network and a\nconfectionery manufacturing centre. In recent decades, the economy of York has\nmoved from being dominated by its confectionery and railway-related industries\nto one that provides services. The University of York and health services have\nbecome major employers, whilst tourism has become an important element of the\nlocal economy.\n\nFrom 1996, the term City of York describes a unitary authority area which\nincludes rural areas beyond the old city boundaries. In 2001 the urban area had\na population of 137,505,<ref name=\"KS01\"> {{cite web |url = http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/census/census-2001-key-statistics/urban-areas-in-\nengland-and-wales/index.html
