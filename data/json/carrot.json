It has a crisp texture when fresh. The most\ncommonly eaten part of a carrot is a taproot, although the greens are sometimes\neaten as well. It is a domesticated form of the wild carrot Daucus carota,\nnative to Europe and southwestern Asia. The domestic carrot has been selectively\nbred for its greatly enlarged and more palatable, less woody-textured edible\ntaproot. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)\nreports that world production of carrots and turnips (these plants are combined\nby the FAO for reporting purposes) for calendar year 2011 was almost 35.658\nmillion tonnes. Almost half were grown in China.\n",
