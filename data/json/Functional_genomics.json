{"cursor":"11888","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Functional genomics' is a field of molecular biology that attempts to make use\nof the vast wealth of data produced by genomic projects (such as genome\nsequencing projects) to describe gene (and protein) functions and interactions.\nUnlike genomics, functional genomics focuses on the dynamic aspects such as gene\ntranscription, translation, and proteinâprotein interactions, as opposed to the\nstatic aspects of the genomic information such as DNA sequence or structures.\nFunctional genomics attempts to answer questions about the function of DNA at\nthe levels of genes, RNA transcripts, and protein products. A key characteristic\nof functional genomics studies is their genome-wide approach to these questions,\ngenerally involving high-throughput methods rather than a more traditional âgene-by-\ngeneâ approach. ]]\n","linknr":218,"url":"Functional_genomics","recorded":1362503545,"links":18,"instances":["biology","biology","genetics","assay"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Molecular biology","Genomics","Omics"],"headings":["Goals of functional genomics","Techniques and applications","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2a/DNA_microarray.svg/300px-DNA_microarray.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["transcription","genetics"],["translation","biology"],["polymorphism","biology"],["multiplex","assay"]],"members":["polymorphism","translation","transcription","multiplex"],"related":["Molecular_biology","Genome_project","Gene","Protein","Genomics","Transcription_(genetics)","Translation_(biology)","Protein–protein_interaction","DNA_sequence","Mutation","Polymorphism_(biology)","Single_nucleotide_polymorphism","Transcriptomics","Gene_expression","Proteomics","Protein_expression","Metabolomics","Multiplex_(assay)","Messenger_RNA","Protein","Biological_specimen","Nucleic_acid_hybridization","Reporter_gene","Affinity_purification","Mass_spectrometry","Peptide","Gene_knockout","Insertional_mutagenesis","Phenotype","Open_reading_frames","Polyadenylation","Bioinformatics","Data_clustering","Principal_component_analysis","Machine_learning","Artificial_neural_network","Support_vector_machine","Statistical_classification","Systems_biology","Structural_genomics","Comparative_genomics","Pharmacogenomics","MGED_Society","Epigenetics","Bioinformatics","Epistasis_and_functional_genomics","Protein_function_prediction"]}
