{"cursor":"16124","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n B group of hemoglobin. An iron (Fe) atom in the middle is shown in red,\n complexed to four interior nitrogen atoms shown in blue. ]] 'Porphyrins' are a\n group of organic compounds, many naturally occurring. One of the best-known\n porphyrins is heme, the pigment in red blood cells; heme is a cofactor of the\n protein hemoglobin. Porphyrins are heterocyclic macrocycles composed of four\n modified pyrrole subunits interconnected at their Î± carbon atoms via methine\n bridges (=CH-). Porphyrins are aromatic. That is, they obey HÃ¼ckel's rule for\n aromaticity, possessing 4n+2 Ï electrons (n=4 for the shortest cyclic path)\n delocalized over the macrocycle. Thus porphyrin macrocycles are highly\n conjugated systems. As a consequence, they typically have very intense\n absorption bands in the visible region and may be deeply colored; the name\n 'porphyrin' comes from a Greek word for [[purple]]. The macrocycle has 26 pi\n electrons in total. The parent porphyrin is porphine, and substituted porphines\n are called porphyrins. The specific porphyrin in 'heme B' (see Figure) is\n called '[[protoporphyrin IX]]' and has 4 methyl, two vinyl, and two propionic\n acid substituents at the indicated positions.\n","linknr":457,"url":"Porphyrin","recorded":1362896636,"links":44,"instances":["biochemistry","biochemistry","chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Biomolecules","Metabolism","Photosynthesis","Supramolecular chemistry","Chelating agents","Tetrapyrroles","Macrocycles"],"headings":["Complexes of porphyrins and related molecules","Natural formation","Synthesis","Applications","See also","Gallery","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/Porphyrin.svg/200px-Porphyrin.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4d/Heme.svg/250px-Heme.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a9/Heme_synthesis.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/Heme-Synthesis-Chemical-Details-Mirror.svg/600px-Heme-Synthesis-Chemical-Details-Mirror.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Tetratolylporphyrin.jpg/220px-Tetratolylporphyrin.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/H2TPPsyn.png/400px-H2TPPsyn.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/Host_Guest_Complex_Porphyrin_Sanders_AngewChemIntEdEngl_1995_1096.jpg/250px-Host_Guest_Complex_Porphyrin_Sanders_AngewChemIntEdEngl_1995_1096.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c8/H2TPP.png/120px-H2TPP.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0a/Meso-tetraphenylporphyrin_UV-vis.JPG/120px-Meso-tetraphenylporphyrin_UV-vis.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/Porfirina_activada_con_la_luz.svg/120px-Porfirina_activada_con_la_luz.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cofactor","biochemistry"],["complex","chemistry"],["substrate","biochemistry"]],"members":["cofactor","substrate","complex"],"related":["Iron","Nitrogen","Organic_compound","Heme","Blood_cell","Cofactor_(biochemistry)","Hemoglobin","Heterocyclic_compound","Macrocycle","Pyrrole","Methine","Aromaticity","Hückel's_rule","Conjugated_system","Greek_language","Pi_electrons","Porphine","Ligand","Metals","Complex_(chemistry)","Ion","Protein","Hemoglobin","Myoglobin","Oxygen","Cytochrome","Corrin","Chlorin","Bacteriochlorophyll","Cofactor_F430","Chlorin","Pyrroline","Chlorophyll","Bacteriochlorin","Photosynthetic","Bacteria","Crude_oil","Oil_shale","Abelsonite","Committed_step","Biosynthesis","Aminolevulinic_acid","Amino_acid","Glycine","Succinyl-CoA","Citric_acid_cycle","Porphobilinogen","Deamination","Hydroxymethyl_bilane","Hydrolysation","Uroporphyrinogen_III","Protoporphyrin_IX","Iron","OMIM","Porphyria","Mitochondrion","Enzyme","Substrate_(biochemistry)","Chromosome","Enzyme_Commission_number","OMIM","Porphyria","ALA_synthase","Glycine","Succinyl_CoA","ALA_dehydratase","Aminolevulinic_acid","ALA-Dehydratase_deficiency","Porphobilinogen_deaminase","Porphobilinogen","Acute_intermittent_porphyria","Uroporphyrinogen_III_synthase","Hydroxymethyl_bilane","Congenital_erythropoietic_porphyria","Uroporphyrinogen_III_decarboxylase","Uroporphyrinogen_III","Porphyria_cutanea_tarda","Coproporphyrinogen_III_oxidase","Coproporphyrinogen_III","Coproporphyria","Protoporphyrinogen_oxidase","Protoporphyrinogen_IX","Variegate_porphyria","Ferrochelatase","Protoporphyrin_IX","Erythropoietic_protoporphyria","Propionic_acid","Tetraphenylporphyrin","Aldehyde","P-toluenesulfonic_acid","Green_chemistry","Adsorb","Silica_gel","Microwave_chemistry","Gas_phase","Tetraphenylporphyrin","Organic_synthesis","Photodynamic_therapy","Macular_degeneration","Verteporfin","Molecular_electronics","Phthalocyanine","Dye-sensitized_solar_cells","Solar_conversion_efficiencies","Photovoltaic","Supramolecular_chemistry","Macrocycle","Organic_geochemistry","Nickel","Vanadyl","Porphyria","Heme","Cytochrome_P450","Chlorophyll","Corrole","Vitamin_B12","Cofactor_F430","Methyl_coenzyme_M_reductase","Phthalocyanine"]}
