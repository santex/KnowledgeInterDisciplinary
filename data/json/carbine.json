Many carbines are shortened versions of full rifles, firing\nthe same ammunition at a lower muzzle velocity due to a shorter barrel length.\n\nThe smaller size and lighter weight of carbines makes them easier to handle.\nThey are typically issued to high-mobility troops such as special-operations\nsoldiers and paratroopers, as well as to mounted, supply, or other non-infantry\npersonnel whose roles do not require full-sized rifles.\n",
