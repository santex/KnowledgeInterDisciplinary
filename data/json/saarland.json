With its capital at\nSaarbrücken, it has an area of 2,570&nbsp;km² and (as of 30 April 2012)\n1,012,000 inhabitants.<ref>[http://www.statistik-portal.de/Statistik-\nPortal/de_zs01_saa.asp Statistische Ämter des Bundes und der Länder]</ref> In\nterms of both area and population size it is – apart from the city-states of\nBerlin, Bremen and Hamburg – Germany's smallest federal state. The wealth of its\ncoal deposits and their large-scale industrial exploitation, coupled with its\nlocation on the border between France and Germany, have given the Saarland a\nunique history in modern times.\n\nPrior to its creation as the Territory of the Saar Basin by the League of\nNations after World War I, the Saarland (or simply \"the Saar\", as is frequently\nreferred to) did not exist as a unified entity. Until then, some parts of it had\nbeen Prussian while others belonged to Bavaria. The inhabitants voted to rejoin\nGermany in a plebiscite held in 1935.\n\nFrom 1947 to 1956 the Saarland was a French-occupied territory (the \"Saar\nProtectorate\") separate from the rest of Germany. Between 1950 and 1956,\nSaarland was a member of the Council of Europe. In 1955, in another plebiscite,\nthe inhabitants were offered independence, but voted instead for the territory\nto become a state of West Germany.\n\nFrom 1920 to 1935, and again from 1947 to 1959, the inhabitants of the Saarland\nused postage stamps issued specially for the territory; see postage stamps and\npostal history of the Saar for details.\n","title":"saarland","headings":["History","Geography","Religion","Politics","Economy","Education","Culture","Sports","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["4: Social_Democratic_Party_of_Germany","3: Germany","3: Saarbrücken","3: Bavaria","3: Luxembourg","2: German_language","2: Prussia","2: West_Germany","2: Rhine","2: Saar_River","2: Moselle","2: France","2: World_War_II","2: Saarland_University","2: French_language","2: Moselle_River","2: Minister-president","2: Annegret_Kramp-Karrenbauer","1: States_of_Germany","1: City-state","1: Berlin,_Germany","1: Hamburg","1: World_War_I","1: Council_of_Europe","1: Postage_stamp","1: Postage_stamps_and_postal_history_of_the_Saar","1: Celt","1: Treveri","1: Mediomatrici","1: Celtic_circular_wall_of_Otzenhausen","1: Roman_Empire","1: Belgica","1: Franks","1: Kingdom_of_the_Franks","1: Carolingian_Empire","1: Holy_Roman_Empire","1: Nassau-Saarbrücken","1: King_of_France","1: Saarlouis","1: French_Revolution","1: French_Republic","1: Mont-Tonnerre","1: Napoleon","1: Lower_Rhine_Province","1: Kingdom_of_Bavaria","1: Wilhelm,_Duke_of_Oldenburg","1: Napoleon_III","1: Franco-Prussian_War","1: Spicheren","1: German_Empire","1: United_Kingdom","1: Treaty_of_Versailles","1: Rhine_Province","1: Rhenish_Palatinate","1: League_of_Nations","1: National_Socialism","1: Saarland_status_referendum,_1935","1: Josef_Bürckel","1: German_Reich","1: Invasion_of_Poland","1: Saar_Offensive","1: Marches","1: Willi_Stöhr","1: Monnet_Plan","1: Ruhr_area","1: Saar_area","1: International_Authority_for_the_Ruhr","1: European_Coal_and_Steel_Community","1: Upper_Silesia","1: Restatement_of_Policy_on_Germany","1: United_States_Secretary_of_State","1: James_F._Byrnes","1: Morgenthau_plan","1: United_States","1: UK","1: Industrial_plans_for_Germany","1: Ernest_Bevin","1: Robert_Schuman","1: University_of_Nancy","1: Hochschule_für_Technik_und_Wirtschaft_des_Saarlandes","1: High_Commissioner","1: Paris_Pacts","1: Saar_Statute_referendum,_1955","1: Saar_Treaty","1: Fall_of_Communism","1: East_Germany","1: Saar_franc","1: Deutsche_Mark","1: English_language","1: SaarLorLux","1: Euroregion","1: Rhineland_Palatinate","1: Wallonia","1: Mettlach","1: Google_Maps","1: Rhineland-Palatinate","1: Tributary","1: List_of_places_in_Saarland","1: Merzig-Wadern","1: Saarpfalz","1: Germans","1: Catholic_Church","1: Roman_Catholic_Diocese_of_Trier","1: Roman_Catholic_Diocese_of_Speyer","1: Evangelical_Church_in_Germany","1: Landeskirche","1: Evangelical_Church_in_the_Rhineland","1: Evangelical_Church_of_the_Palatinate","1: Roman_Catholicism","1: Landtag_of_Saarland","1: Coalition","1: Saarland_state_election,_2012","1: Classical_liberalism","1: Bündnis_90/Die_Grünen","1: Grand_coalition","1: Heiko_Maas","1: Monika_Bachmann","1: Ulrich_Commerçon","1: Anke_Rehlinger","1: Andreas_Storm","1: Stephan_Toscani","1: Jürgen_Lennartz","1: List_of_Ministers-President_of_the_Saarland","1: Rhine_Franconian","1: Moselle_Franconian","1: Trier","1: Grammatical_gender","1: Grammatical_conjunction","1: Declension","1: Genitive","1: Dative_case","1: Pronoun","1: Accusative","1: Nominative","1: Diphthongs","1: Vowel","1: Saarland_national_football_team","1: 1954_FIFA_World_Cup","1: Germany_national_football_team","1: Norway_national_football_team","1: Saar_at_the_1952_Summer_Olympics","1: 1952_Summer_Olympics"]}
