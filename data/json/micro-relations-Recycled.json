Although similar in effect, the composting or other\nreuse of biodegradable wasteâsuch as food or garden wasteâis not typically\nconsidered recycling. Materials to be recycled are either\nbrought to a collection center or picked up from the curbside, then sorted,\ncleaned, and reprocessed into new materials bound for manufacturing.\n\nIn the strictest sense, recycling of a material would produce a fresh supply of\nthe same materialâfor example, used office paper would be converted into new\noffice paper, or used foamed polystyrene into new polystyrene. However, this is\noften difficult or too expensive (compared with producing the same product from\nraw materials or other sources), so \"recycling\" of many products or materials\ninvolves their '[[reuse]]' in producing different materials (e.g., paperboard)\ninstead. Another form of recycling is the '[[wiktionary:Salvage|salvage]]' of\ncertain materials from complex products, either due to their intrinsic value\n(e.g., lead from car batteries, or gold from computer components), or due to\ntheir hazardous nature (e.g., removal and reuse of mercury from various items).\nCritics dispute the net economic and environmental benefits of recycling over\nits costs, and suggest that proponents of recycling often make matters worse and\nsuffer from confirmation bias. Specifically, critics argue that the costs and\nenergy used in collection and transportation detract from (and outweigh) the\ncosts and energy saved in the production process; also that the jobs produced by\nthe recycling industry can be a poor trade for the jobs lost in logging, mining,\nand other industries associated with virgin production; and that materials such\nas paper pulp can only be recycled a few times before material degradation\nprevents further recycling. Proponents of recycling dispute each of these\nclaims, and the validity of arguments from both sides has led to enduring\ncontroversy.\n","linknr":1260,"url":"Recycled","recorded":1362898018,"links":117,"instances":["ecological","society","element","electricity","law","journalist","economics"],"pdf":["http://www.britishsoftdrinks.com/PDF/history.pdf","http://www.britishsoftdrinks.com/PDF/history.pdf","http://www.epa.gov/smm/wastewise/pubs/commonmats.pdf","http://www.epa.gov/smm/wastewise/pubs/commonmats.pdf","http://faculty.uml.edu/Nelson_Eby/89.215/Assignments/Mineral%20Identification.pdf","http://engineering.dartmouth.edu/~Benoit_R_Roisin/courses/engs171/Limits-to-Sustainability.pdf","http://engineering.dartmouth.edu/~Benoit_R_Roisin/courses/engs171/Limits-to-Sustainability.pdf","http://library.certh.gr/libfiles/PDF/GEN-PAPYR-508-RECOGNIZING-by-HUESEMANN-in-EST-V-37-ISS-13-PP-259A-260A-Y-2003.pdf","http://library.certh.gr/libfiles/PDF/GEN-PAPYR-508-RECOGNIZING-by-HUESEMANN-in-EST-V-37-ISS-13-PP-259A-260A-Y-2003.pdf","http://www.thaiscience.info/Article%20for%20ThaiScience/Article/4/Ts-4%20emergy%20indices%20and%20ratios%20for%20sustainable%20material%20cycles%20and%20recycle%20options.pdf","http://www.thaiscience.info/Article%20for%20ThaiScience/Article/4/Ts-4%20emergy%20indices%20and%20ratios%20for%20sustainable%20material%20cycles%20and%20recycle%20options.pdf","http://webpages.uncc.edu/~ytong1/courses/Environmental%20Systems/class%2001/Decker_et_al_2000.pdf","http://www1.eere.energy.gov/industry/aluminum/pdfs/aluminum.pdf","http://www1.eere.energy.gov/industry/aluminum/pdfs/aluminum.pdf","http://web.mit.edu/ebm/www/Publications/IEEE_2011_int_trade_sahni.pdf","http://web.mit.edu/ebm/www/Publications/IEEE_2011_int_trade_sahni.pdf","http://www.mdpi.com/2078-1547/2/4/73/pdf","http://www.mdpi.com/2078-1547/2/4/73/pdf","http://sociology.uoregon.edu/faculty/foster/International%20Journal%20of%20Comparative%20Sociology-2009-Clark-311-34-2.pdf","http://sociology.uoregon.edu/faculty/foster/International%20Journal%20of%20Comparative%20Sociology-2009-Clark-311-34-2.pdf","http://www.blakealcott.org/pdf/sdarticle.pdf","http://www.blakealcott.org/pdf/sdarticle.pdf","http://www.epa.gov/msw/pubs/cok.pdf","http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/silica/780398.pdf","http://ewasteguide.info/files/Sepulveda_2010_EIAR_0_0.pdf","http://ewasteguide.info/files/Sepulveda_2010_EIAR_0_0.pdf","http://www.sfgov.org/site/uploadedfiles/police/stations/ParkStation/2007/07feb08%20park%20newsletter.pdf"],"categories":["Recycling|","Waste
