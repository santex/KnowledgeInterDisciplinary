'Shipbuilders', also\ncalled 'shipwrights', follow a specialized occupation that traces its roots to\nbefore recorded history.\n\nShipbuilding and ship repairs, both commercial and military, are referred to as\n\"naval engineering\". The construction of boats is a similar activity called\nboat building.\n\nThe dismantling of ships is called ship breaking.<!--spacing, please do\nnot remove-->\n",
