It requires the Environmental Protection Agency\n(EPA) to develop and enforce regulations to protect the public from airborne\ncontaminants known to be hazardous to human health. The 1963 version of the\nlegislation established a research program, expanded in 1967. Major amendments\nto the law, requiring regulatory controls for air pollution, passed in 1970,\n1977 and 1990.\n\nThe 1970 amendments greatly expanded the federal mandate, requiring\ncomprehensive federal and state regulations for both stationary (industrial)\npollution sources and mobile sources. It also significantly expanded federal\nenforcement.\n\nThe 1990 amendments addressed acid rain, ozone depletion and toxic air\npollution, established a national permits program for stationary sources, and\nincreased enforcement authority. The amendments also established new auto\ngasoline reformulation requirements, set Reid vapor pressure (RVP) standards to\ncontrol evaporative emissions from gasoline, and mandated new gasoline\nformulations sold from May to September in many states.\n\nThe Clean Air Act was the first major environmental law in the United States to\ninclude a provision for citizen suits. Numerous state and local governments have\nenacted similar legislation, either implementing federal programs or filling in\nlocally important gaps in federal programs.\n","linknr":535,"url":"Clean_Air_Act_(United_States)","recorded":1362508795,"links":31,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.epa.gov/ttn/nsr/gen/wkshpman.pdf","http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d09554.pdf","http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d09554.pdf","http://www.biodiesel.org/resources/reportsdatabase/reports/gen/19980301_GEN-044.pdf","http://www.biodiesel.org/resources/reportsdatabase/reports/gen/19980301_GEN-044.pdf","http://www.epa.gov/air/oaqps/permits/permitupdate/permits.pdf","http://www.epa.gov/air/sect812/feb11/fullreport.pdf","http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/Downloads/ghgemissions/508_Complete_GHG_1990_2008.pdf"],"categories":["Climate change in the United States","Air pollution in the United States","United States federal environmental legislation","1970 in law","1990 in law","88th United States Congress","1963 in the environment"],"headings":["Components of Air Pollution Prevention and Control","History","Roles of the federal government and states","Interstate air pollution","Leak detection and repair","Application to greenhouse gas emissions","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/Great_Seal_of_the_United_States_%28obverse%29.svg/140px-Great_Seal_of_the_United_States_%28obverse%29.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/45/US-overall-nonattainment-2007-06.png/300px-US-overall-nonattainment-2007-06.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg/20px-Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/15px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["clean_air_act","united_states#title_vi_-_stratospheric_ozone_protection"],["clean_air_act","united_states#proposed_endangerment_finding_related_to_the_clean_air_act_202.28a.29"]],"members":["clean_air_act"],"related":["Lyndon_B._Johnson","United_States_federal_law","Air_pollution","United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency","Regulation","Mobile_source_air_pollution","Acid_rain","Ozone_depletion","Reid_vapor_pressure","Environmental_law","Citizen_suit","Acetaldehyde","Benzene","Chloroform","Phenol","Selenium","Cadmium","Arsenic","Carbon_monoxide","Volatile_organic_compounds","Nitrogen","Coal","Ozone","Ultraviolet","UVB","Stratosphere","Oxygen","Freon","Chlorofluorocarbons","Montreal_Protocol","National_Ambient_Air_Quality_Standards","Exhaust_gas","Motorcycles","Leaded_gasoline","OPEC","1973_energy_crisis","1979_energy_crisis","Khazzoom-Brookes_Postulate","Jevons_paradox","Benzene","Formaldehyde","Butadienes","Cancer","Smog","Seattle","Denver","San_Francisco","Climate_Action_Plan","Greenhouse","International_Civil_Aviation_Organization","Carbon_dioxide","Secretary_of_Transportation","Nitrogen_oxide","Hydrocarbons","Carbon_monoxide","Sulfur_dioxide","Photochemicals","Natural_gas","Petroleum","Ozone","California","Nitrogen_oxides","Sulfur_dioxide","Ozone_layer","Ultraviolet","Ozone_depletion_potential","Montreal_Protocol","United_States_Congress","Public_Health_Service","National_Ambient_Air_Quality_Standards","Carbon_monoxide","Nitrogen_dioxide","Atmospheric_particulate_matter","Hydrocarbon","Photochemical_smog","State_Implementation_Plan","New_Source_Performance_Standard","National_Emissions_Standards_for_Hazardous_Air_Pollutants","Edmund_Muskie","Toyota_Motor_Corp","Air_Pollution_Control_Act","Air_quality_law","Environmental_Protection_Agency","Lead","Tropospheric_ozone","Smog","Atmospheric_particulate_matter","Soot","Clinton_administration","Nondelegation_principle","U.S._Supreme_Court","U.S._state","Power_plant","Chemical_plant","State_Implementation_Plan","Regulations","Rhode_Island","Pollution_control","Pollution","Research","Engineering","Metropolitan_Planning_Organizations","Federal_Highway_Administration","Federal_Transit_Administration","San_Joaquin_Valley","The_Clean_Air_Campaign","Metropolitan_areas","Acid_Rain_Program","Emissions_trading","Sulfur_dioxide","Volatile_organic_compound","Greenhouse_gas","Regulation_of_Greenhouse_Gases_Under_the_Clean_Air_Act","The_Center_for_Clean_Air_Policy","Environmental_policy_of_the_United_States","Emission_standards","Emissions_trading","Startups,_shutdowns,_and_malfunctions","Commission_on_Risk_Assessment_and_Risk_Management","Alan_Carlin"]}
