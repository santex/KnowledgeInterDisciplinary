Aerodynamics is a\n subfield of fluid dynamics and gas dynamics, with much theory shared between\n them. Aerodynamics is often used synonymously with gas dynamics, with the\n difference being that gas dynamics applies to all gases.\n","linknr":730,"url":"Aerodynamics","recorded":1362477242,"links":81,"instances":["fluid_mechanics","force","hvac","kcl","physics","fluid_dynamics","infinitesimal","thermodynamics","physics","fluid_dynamics"],"pdf":["http://www.aeronautics.nasa.gov/fap/OnAerialNavigationPt1.pdf","http://www.aeronautics.nasa.gov/fap/OnAerialNavigationPt2.pdf","http://www.aeronautics.nasa.gov/fap/OnAerialNavigationPt3.pdf","http://www.public.iastate.edu/~huhui/paper/2007/AIAA-2007-0483.pdf"],"categories":["Aerospace
