[http://www.communities.gov.uk/index.asp?id=1124377 Department for\nCommunities and Local Government: Fire & Resilience - Retained Duty System\n(accessed 23 April 07)] [http://www.communities.gov.uk/pub-\n/421/TheFireandRescueServiceRetainedDutySystemPDF1430Kb_id1124421.pdf ODPM: The\nFire and Rescue service Retained Duty System - A review of recruitment and\nretention challenges, pub TSO, Feb 2005 (see p28 Terminology)]\n\nWhen required to answer an emergency call, retained firefighters are summoned to\nthe fire station by a radio pager (also known as a \"bleeper\"). Once at the\nstation, the crews staff the fire engine and proceed to the incident.\n\nBecause of this, retained firefighters are required to live or work near to the\nfire station they serve. This allows them to respond to emergencies within\nacceptable and strict attendance time targets set out by each fire service.\n\nRetained firefighters are employed and trained by the applicable local\nauthority fire and rescue service covering the particular county or area in\nwhich they serve.\n\nTypically, retained firefighters are employed in rural areas or in large\nvillages or small towns. They provide cover to 90% of the area of the UK - there\nare 14,000 in England and Wales. Department for Communities and\nLocal Government: Fire & resilience - Retained Duty System (accessed 23 April\n07) Of the approximately 8,500 operational firefighters in Scotland, about\n32% are\nretained.

[http://www.communities.gov.uk/index.asp?id=1124377 Department\nfor Communities and Local Government: Fire & Resilience - Retained Duty System\np56, sec 5.22(accessed 23 April 07)]\n\nUnlike volunteer firefighters, retained firefighters receive an annual \"retainer\nfee\" and are paid on a \"per emergency call\" basis. The Fire Brigades Union (FBU)\nand the Retained Firefighters' Union (RFU) represent the interests of retained\nfirefighters across the country.\n","linknr":130,"url":"retained","recorded":1363413642,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Retained_firefighter&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Retained_firefighter&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","/wiki/Retained_firefighter","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","/w/index.php?title=Retained&redirect=no","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/United_Kingdom","/wiki/Ireland","/wiki/Firefighter","#cite_note-rds-1","#cite_note-rep-2","/wiki/Local_authority","/wiki/Fire_service_in_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/England_and_Wales","#cite_note-rds-1","/wiki/Scotland","#cite_note-3","/wiki/London_Fire_Brigade","/wiki/West_Midlands_Fire_Service","#cite_note-4","#cite_note-5","/wiki/Volunteer_fire_department","/wiki/Fire_Brigades_Union","/wiki/Retained_Firefighters%27_Union","#Emergency_response","#Role_within_the_community","#Training_and_competency","#Other_duties","#References","#See_also","/w/index.php?title=Retained_firefighter&action=edit&section=1","#cite_note-rep-2","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/wiki/Ireland","/wiki/Cork_(city)","/wiki/Dublin","/wiki/United_States","/w/index.php?title=Retained_firefighter&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/w/index.php?title=Retained_firefighter&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/Self-contained_breathing_apparatus","/wiki/HAZMAT","/wiki/Road_traffic_collision","/wiki/Emergency_medical_technician","/wiki/Office_of_the_Deputy_Prime_Minister","#cite_note-rep3-6","/w/index.php?title=Retained_firefighter&action=edit&section=4","/wiki/Fire_Service_Co-Responder","/w/index.php?title=Retained_firefighter&action=edit&section=5","#cite_ref-rds_1-0","#cite_ref-rds_1-1","http://www.communities.gov.uk/index.asp?id=1124377","#cite_ref-rep_2-0","#cite_ref-rep_2-1","http://www.communities.gov.uk/pub/421/TheFireandRescueServiceRetainedDutySystemPDF1430Kb_id1124421.pdf","#cite_ref-3","http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2002/04/14468/2215","#cite_ref-4","/wiki/Sedgley","#cite_ref-5","http://www.communities.gov.uk/index.asp?id=1124377","#cite_ref-rep3_6-0","http://www.communities.gov.uk/pub/421/TheFireandRescueServiceRetainedDutySystemPDF1430Kb_id1124421.pdf","/w/index.php?title=Retained_firefighter&action=edit&section=6","/wiki/Fire_services_in_the_United_Kingdom","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Retained_firefighter&oldid=525626177","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Fire_and_rescue_service_organisation_in_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Category:All_articles_with_unsourced_statements","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_unsourced_statements_from_April_2007","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_unsourced_statements_from_May_2007","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Retained+firefighter&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Retained+firefighter","/wiki/Retained_firefighter","/wiki/Talk:Retained_firefighter","#","/wiki/Retained_firefighter","/w/index.php?title=Retained_firefighter&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Retained_firefighter&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Retained_firefighter","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Retained_firefighter","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Retained_firefighter&oldid=525626177","/w/index.php?title=Retained_firefighter&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Retained_firefighter&id=525626177","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Retained+firefighter","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Retained+firefighter&oldid=525626177&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Retained_firefighter&printable=yes","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediaf
