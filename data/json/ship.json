      "text" : "\n\n full-rigged ship ''Amerigo Vespucci'' in New York Harbor, 1976]] Since the end\n of the age of sail a 'ship' has been any large buoyant watercraft. Ships are\n generally distinguished from boats based on size and cargo or passenger\n capacity. Ships are used on lakes, seas, and rivers for a variety of\n activities, such as the transport of people or goods, fishing, entertainment,\n public safety, and warfare. Historically, a \"ship\" was a vessel with sails\n rigged in a specific manner.\n\nShips and boats have developed alongside humanity. In armed conflict and in\ndaily life they have become an integral part of modern commercial and military\nsystems. Fishing boats are used by millions of fishermen throughout the world.\nMilitary forces operate vessels for combat and to transport and support forces\nashore. Commercial vessels, nearly 35,000 in number, carried 7.4&nbsp;billion\ntons of cargo in 2007.<ref name=\"unctad07x\">UNCTAD 2007, p. x and p. 32.</ref>\nTotal number of ships(with IMO number) as of 2011 is about 104,304.<ref>http://shippingresearch.wordpress.com/2012/07/31/how-many-ships-\nare-there-in-the-world/</ref>\n\nShips were a key in history's great explorations and scientific and\ntechnological development. Navigators such as Zheng He spread such inventions\nas the compass and gunpowder. Ships have been used for such purposes as\ncolonization and the slave trade, and have served scientific, cultural, and\nhumanitarian needs. After the 16th century, new crops that had come from and to\nthe Americas via the European seafarers significantly contributed to the\nworld's population growth.<ref>\"[http://www.learnnc.org/lp/editions/nchist-\ntwoworlds/1866 The Columbian Exchange]\".
