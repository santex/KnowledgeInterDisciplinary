{"cursor":"9306","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\n, the sky father of Greco-Roman mythology]]\n\nThe sky has important religious significance. Most polytheistic religions have a\ndeity or deities whose portfolio includes or is even limited to the sky or the\nheavens. While there are often multiple sky deities, sometimes this position is\nreserved for a deity who is conceived as reigning over the others, or at least\nis one of the most powerful. When the main sky deity was seen as feminine, she\noften held the title of the \"Queen of Heaven.\" Ancient sky goddesses who held\nthe title \"Queen of Heaven\" included Isis, Astarte, Ishtar, and Inanna. (The\ntitle was later applied to the Virgin Mary, along with various other features\nand attributes of ancient pagan goddesses.)\n\nAnother common conception is that of a complementary polarity between Earth and\nsky that may be ascribed genders as a mated pair. In some religions this takes\nthe form of a Sky father and an Earth mother, while in other religions the mated\ncouple are a sky goddess and an earth god. (For example, Nut and Geb in ancient\nEgypt.) In still other religions, there is a main pair of deities who rule the\nsky as husband and wife (for example, Zeus and Hera in ancient Greece), while a\ndifferent pair of deities (e.g., Hades and Persephone) rule the Earth and/or\nchthonic realms. Along similar lines, some scholars of religion hold that\nJehovah or Yahweh, the monotheistic deity of the Jewish bible, originally had a\nwife who was most likely the sky goddess Asherah. (See The Hebrew Goddess.) In\nsome contemporary religions, the divine pair of sky deities are known as the\n\"Heavenly Father\" and the \"Heavenly Mother.\"\n","linknr":361,"url":"Sky_deity","recorded":1368995462,"links":["/w/index.php?title=List_of_sky_deities&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=List_of_sky_deities&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","/wiki/List_of_sky_deities","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","/w/index.php?title=Sky_deity&redirect=no","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_sky_deities&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/Spirit_Air","/wiki/Spirits_of_the_Air,_Gremlins_of_the_Clouds","/wiki/Spirit_in_the_Sky","/wiki/Spirits_in_the_Sky","/wiki/File:IngresJupiterAndThetis.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/14/IngresJupiterAndThetis.jpg/220px-IngresJupiterAndThetis.jpg","/wiki/File:IngresJupiterAndThetis.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf3/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Jupiter_(mythology)","/wiki/Sky_father","/wiki/Sky","/wiki/Polytheistic","/wiki/Major_religious_groups","/wiki/Deity","/wiki/Heaven","/wiki/Queen_of_Heaven_(antiquity)","/wiki/Sky_father","/wiki/Earth_mother","/wiki/Asherah","/wiki/The_Hebrew_Goddess","/wiki/Heavenly_Mother","#Africa","#Egyptian_mythology","#Sub_Saharan_mythology","#Ancient_Near_East","#Ancient_Semitic_Mythology","#Hurrian_mythology","#Mesopotamian_mythology","#Armenian_mythology","#Europe","#Basque_mythology","#Celtic_mythology","#Etruscan_mythology","#Finnish_mythology","#Greek_mythology","#Roman_mythology","#Sami_mythology","#Slavic_mythology","#Thracian_mythology","#South_Asia","#East_and_Southeast_Asia","#Chinese_mythology","#Japanese_mythology","#M.C4.81ori_mythology","#Thai_and_Lao_Mythology","#Central_Asia","#Turkic_mythology","#Udmurt_mythology","#Americas","#Arctic","#Aztec_mythology","#Inca_Mythology","#Maya_mythology","#Native_American_mythology","#Australia_and_Oceania","#Australia","#Oceania_mythology","#See_also","/w/index.php?title=List_of_sky_deities&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=List_of_sky_deities&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Amun","/wiki/Anhur","/wiki/Hathor","/wiki/Horus","/wiki/Mehet-Weret","/wiki/Nut_(goddess)","/wiki/Shu_(Egyptian_deity)","/w/index.php?title=List_of_sky_deities&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/Acham%C3%A1n","/wiki/Guanches","/wiki/Achuhucanac","/wiki/Badessy","/wiki/Haitian_Vodou","/wiki/Denka","/wiki/Dinka","/wiki/Khonvoum","/wiki/Mbuti","/wiki/Pygmy","/wiki/Mulungu","/wiki/Nyamwezi","/wiki/Numakulla","/wiki/Olorun","/wiki/Shango","/wiki/Yoruba_religion","/wiki/Umvelinqangi","/wiki/Zulu_people","/wiki/Utixo","/wiki/Khoikhoi","/wiki/Xamaba","/w/index.php?title=Heikum&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/South_Africa","/w/index.php?title=List_of_sky_deities&action=edit&section=4","/w/index.php?title=List_of_sky_deities&action=edit&section=5","/wiki/Hadad","/wiki/Yahweh_(Canaanite_deity)","/wiki/Canaanite_religion","/w/index.php?title=List_of_sky_deities&action=edit&section=6","/wiki/Hepit","/wiki/Teshub","/w/index.php?title=List_of_sky_deities&action=edit&section=7","/wiki/An_(goddess)","/wiki/Anshar","/wiki/Anu","/wiki/Beelshamen","/wiki/Enlil","/w/index.php?title=List_of_sky_deities&action=edit&section=8","/wiki/Barsamin","/w/index.php?title=List_of_sky_deities&action=edit&section=9","/w/index.php?title=List_of_sky_deities&action=edit&section=10","/wiki/Aide_(deity)","/w/index.php?title=List_of_sky_deities&action=edit&section=11","/wiki/Latobius","/wiki/Taranis","/w/index.php?title=List_of_sky_deities&action=edit&section=12","/wiki/Ani_(god)","/wiki/Tinia","/w/index.php?title=List_of_sky_deities&action=edit&section=13","/wiki/Ilmatar","/wiki/Jumala","/wiki/Perkele","/wiki/Ukko","/w/index.php?title=List_of_sky_deities&action=edit&section=14","/wiki/Aether_(mythology)","/wiki/Chaos_(mythology)","/wiki/Hera","/wiki/Iris_(mythology)","/wiki/Nephelai","/wiki/Theia","/wiki/Uranus_(mythology)","/wiki/Zeus","/wiki/Mount_Olympus","/w/index.php?title=List_of_sky_deities&action=edit&section=15","/wiki/Caelus","/wiki/Uranus_(mythology)","/wiki/Jupiter_(mythology)","/wiki/Zeus","/w/index.php?title=List_of_sky_deities&action=edit&section=16","/
