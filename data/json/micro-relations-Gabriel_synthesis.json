(Review)\n\nThe Gabriel reaction has since been generalized to include the alkylation of\nsulfonamides and imides, followed by deprotection, to obtain amines (see\n#Alternative Gabriel reagents).\n\nThe utility of the method is based on the fact that the alkylation of ammonia is\nan unselective and inefficient route to amines in the laboratory (on an\nindustrial scale, the alkylation of ammonia is, however, widely employed). The\nconjugate base of ammonia, sodium amide (NaNH 2), is more basic than\nit is nucleophilic. In fact, sodium amide is used to deliberately obtain the\ndehydrohalogenation product.\n","linknr":153,"url":"Gabriel_synthesis","recorded":1362371450,"links":24,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Substitution reactions","Name reactions"],"headings":["Traditional Gabriel synthesis","Alternative Gabriel reagents","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e2/Gabriel_Synthesis_Scheme.png/500px-Gabriel_Synthesis_Scheme.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8f/Gabriel_synthesis_mechanism.png/600px-Gabriel_synthesis_mechanism.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Siegmund_Gabriel","Chemical_reaction","Alkyl_halide","Amine","Potassium_phthalimide","Chemische_Berichte","J._Am._Chem._Soc.","Angew._Chem._Int._Ed._Engl.","Alkylation","Ammonia","Sodium_amide","Sodium_amide","Dehydrohalogenation","Phthalimide","Alkyl_halide","Acid","Hydrolysis","J._Org._Chem.","Ethanol","Hydrazine","Amine","Phthalimide","Tetrahedron_Lett.","Saccharin","Alkyl_halides"]}
