Founded in Ottawa in 1995 by the husband and wife\nteam of Keenan Wellar and Julie Kingstone, LiveWorkPlay was originally known as\nthe Keen Learning Centre for Youth and then the Special Needs Network. http://strategis.ic.gc.ca/cgi-\nbin/sc_mrksv/corpdir/dataOnline/corpns_re?company_select=3127281\n\nSoon after its founding as a resource centre, the organization evolved and\nbegan offering supports and services related to housing, employment, and\ncommunity participation. In 2001 the name was changed to LiveWorkPlay to\nfocus on the organization's goal of promoting full participation and decision-\nmaking with regard to living situations, work, and\nplay. http://www.liveworkplay.ca/node/322 In 2011 the organization\nadopted a revised vision, values, and mission: \"Helping the community\nwelcome people with intellectual disabilities to live, work, and play as\nvalued citizens.\" http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QO309OzM3-E\n\nIn an effort to better share best practices and connect with organizations\nacross the province LiveWorkPlay joined Community
