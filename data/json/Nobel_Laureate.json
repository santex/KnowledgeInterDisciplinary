They were\n established by the 1895 will of Alfred Nobel, which dictates that the awards\n should be administered by the Nobel Foundation. Each recipient, or \"laureate\",\n receives a gold medal, a diploma, and a sum of money, which is decided by the\n Nobel Foundation, yearly. Another prize, the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic\n Sciences, was established in 1968 by the Sveriges Riksbank, the central bank of\n Sweden, for contributors to the field of economics.\n\nEach prize is awarded by a separate committee; the Royal Swedish Academy of\nSciences awards the Prizes in Physics, Chemistry, and Economics, the Karolinska\nInstitute awards the Prize in Physiology or Medicine, and the Norwegian Nobel\nCommittee awards the Prize in Peace. Each recipient receives a medal,\na diploma and a monetary award that has varied throughout the years. In 1901, the recipients of the first Nobel Prizes\nwere given 150,782 SEK, which is equal to 7,731,004 SEK in December 2007. In\n2008, the winners were awarded a prize amount of 10,000,000 SEK. The\nawards are presented in Stockholm in an annual ceremony on December 10, the\nanniversary of Nobel's death.\n\nAs of 2011, 826 individuals and 20 organizations have been awarded a Nobel\nPrize, including 69 winners of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic\nSciences. Four Nobel laureates were not permitted by their\ngovernments to accept the Nobel Prize. Adolf Hitler forbade three Germans,\nRichard Kuhn (Chemistry, 1938), Adolf Butenandt (Chemistry, 1939), and Gerhard\nDomagk (Physiology or Medicine, 1939), from accepting their Nobel Prizes, and\nthe government of the Soviet Union pressured Boris Pasternak (Literature, 1958)\nto decline his award. Two Nobel laureates, Jean-Paul Sartre (Literature, 1964)\nand LÃª Ãá»©c Thá» (Peace, 1973), declined the award; Sartre declined the award as\nhe declined all official honors, and LÃª declined the award due to the situation\nVietnam was in at the time.\n\nSix laureates have received more than one prize; of the six, the International\nCommittee of the Red Cross has received the Nobel Peace Prize three times, more\nthan any other. Among the 826 Nobel laureates, 43\nhave been women; the first woman to win a Nobel Prize was Marie Curie, who won\nthe Nobel Prize in Physics in 1903. She was\nalso the first person (male or female) to win two Nobel Prizes, the second being\nthe Nobel Prize in Chemistry, awarded in 1911.\n\nIn years in which the Nobel Prize is not awarded due to external events or a\nlack of nominations, the prize money is returned to the funds delegated to the\nrelevant prize. The Nobel Prize was not awarded\nbetween 1940 and 1942 due to the outbreak of World War II.\n","linknr":1175,"url":"Nobel_Laureate","recorded":1362480446,"links":59,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Lists of awards","Lists of inventions or discoveries","Nobel laureates|*","Lists of Nobel laureates|"],"headings":["Laureates","Notes","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/Padlock-silver.svg/20px-Padlock-silver.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/ed/Nobel_Prize.png/220px-Nobel_Prize.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e7/Cscr-featured.svg/14px-Cscr-featured.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Nobel_Prize","Royal_Swedish_Academy_of_Sciences","Swedish_Academy","Karolinska_Institute","Norwegian_Nobel_Committee","Nobel_Prize_in_Chemistry","Nobel_Prize_in_Physics","Nobel_Prize_in_Literature","Nobel_Peace_Prize","Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_or_Medicine","Alfred_Nobel","Nobel_Foundation","Diploma","Nobel_Memorial_Prize_in_Economic_Sciences","Sveriges_Riksbank","Central_bank","Sweden","Swedish_krona","Stockholm","Nobel_Memorial_Prize_in_Economic_Sciences","Adolf_Hitler","Richard_Kuhn","Adolf_Butenandt","Gerhard_Domagk","Soviet_Union","Boris_Pasternak","Jean-Paul_Sartre","Le_Duc_Tho","International_Committee_of_the_Red_Cross","Nobel_Peace_Prize","Marie_Curie","World_War&nbsp;II","List_of_Nobel_laureates_in_Physics","List_of_Nobel_laureates_in_Chemistry","List_of_Nobel_laureates_in_Physiology_or_Medicine","List_of_Nobel_laureates_in_Literature","List_of_Nobel_Peace_Prize_laureates","List_of_Nobel_laureates_in_Economics","Institut_de_Droit_International","International_Peace_Bureau","International_Committee_of_the_Red_Cross","Office_international_Nansen_pour_les_réfugiés","International_Committee_of_the_Red_Cross","Quaker_Peace_and_Social_Witness","American_Friends_Service_Committee","United_Nations_High_Commissioner_for_Refugees","International_Committee_of_the_Red_Cross","International_Federation_of_Red_Cross_and_Red_Crescent_Societies","UNICEF","International_Labour_Organization","Amnesty_International","United_Nations_High_Commissioner_for_Refugees","International_Physicians_for_the_Prevention_of_Nuclear_War","United_Nations_peacekeeping","Pugwash_Conferences_on_Science_and_World_Affairs","International_Campaign_to_Ban_Landmines","Médecins_Sans_Frontières","United_Nations","International_Atomic_Energy_Agency","Grameen_Bank","Intergovernmental_Panel_on_Climate_Change","List_of_Nobel_laureates_in_Physics","List_of_Nobel_laureates_in_Chemistry","List_of_Nobel_laureates_in_Physiology_or_Medicine","List_of_Nobel_laureates_in_Literature","List_of_Nobel_Peace_Prize_laureates","List_of_Nobel_laureates_in_Economics","Richard_Kuhn","Adolf_Butenandt","Gerhard_Domagk","Mohandas_Karamchand_Gandhi","Boris_Pasternak","Soviet_Union","Jean-Paul_Sartre","Le_Duc_Tho","Paris_Peace_Accords","Vietnam_War","Liu_Xiaobo","List_of_Nobel_laureates_by_country","List_of_Nobel_laureates_by_university_affiliation","Nobel_Prize_laureates_by_secondary_school_affiliation"]}
