This is\nthe opposite of hypothyroidism ('sluggish thyroid'), which is the reduced\nproduction and secretion of T3 and/or T4.\nHyperthyroidism is a type of thyrotoxicosis, a hypermetabolic clinical syndrome\nwhich occurs when there are elevated serum levels of T3 and/or\nT4.

Walter Siegenthaler: Differential Diagnosis in Internal\nMedicine: From Symptom to Diagnosis, p.485: Thieme.\n\nWhile hyperthyroidism may cause thyrotoxicosis they are not synonymous medical\nconditions; some patients may develop thyrotoxicosis as a result of\ninflammation of the thyroid gland (thyroiditis), which may cause the release of\nexcessive thyroid hormone already stored in the gland but does not cause\naccelerated hormone production. Thyrotoxicosis may also occur by the ingestion\nof excessive amounts of exogenous thyroid hormone in the form of thyroid\nhormone supplements such as the most widely used supplement levothyroxine or\nself-induced); it is also known by other terms such as exogenous\nthyrotoxicosis, alimentary thyrotoxicosis or occult factitial\nthyrotoxicosis.\n\nDisease management and therapy differ for thyrotoxicosis caused by\nhyperthyroidism and thyrotoxicosis caused by other conditions.
