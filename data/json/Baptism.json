While in some places and in\ncertain circumstances total immersion very likely was practiced, all the\nevidence (and there is much more) points to baptism in most cases by partial\nimmersion, or affusion (dunking of the head or pouring water over the head,\ntypically when the baptizand was standing in the baptismal pool). Here the words\nof St. John Chrysostom might be noted: \"It is as in a tomb that we immerse our\nheads in the waterâ¦ then when we lift our heads back the new man comes forth\"\n(On John 25.2, PG 59:151). In a word, while early Christians were very attentive\nto symbolism relating to baptism (cf. the funerary shape of the baptistry\nbuilding; the steps, typically three, for descending and rising from the font;\nthe iconography relating to regeneration, etc.), they show few signs of\npreoccupation with total immersion. (Father John Erickson in St Vladimir's\nTheological Quarterly, 41, 77 (1997), quoted in [http://www.byzcath.org/forums/-\nubbthreads.php/topics/301619/11/specific%20Orthodox%20disagreement The Byzantine\nForum]) Other common forms of baptism\nnow in use include pouring water three times on the forehead.\n\nMartyrdom was identified early in Church history as \"baptism by blood\", enabling\nmartyrs who had not been baptized by water to be saved. Later, the Catholic\nChurch identified a baptism of desire, by which those preparing for baptism who\ndie before actually receiving the sacrament are considered saved. As evidenced also in the common Christian practice of\ninfant baptism, baptism was universally seen by Christians as in some sense\nnecessary for salvation, until Huldrych Zwingli in the 16th century denied its\nnecessity.\n\nToday, some Christians, particularly Quakers and the Salvation Army, do not see\nbaptism as necessary, and do not practice the rite. Among those that do,\ndifferences can be found in the manner and mode of baptizing and in the\nunderstanding of the significance of the rite. Most Christians baptize \"in the\nname of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit\" (following the Great\nCommission), but some baptize in Jesus' name only. Most Christians baptize\ninfants; Out of a total of about 2,100,000,000 Christians ([http://www.numberof.net/number-of-christians-in-the-world-\n2/ Number of Christians in the World,]\n[http://www.religioustolerance.org/worldrel.htm Ontario Consultants on Religious\nTolerance)], infant baptism is in use in the Catholic Church (1,100,000,000),\nthe Eastern Orthodox Church (225,000,000), most of the 77,000,000 members of the\nAnglican Communion, Lutherans and others ([http://www.adherents.com/adh_rb.html\nReligious Bodies of the World with at Least 1 Million Adherents;]\n[http://www.adherents.com/adh_branches.html#Christianity Major Denominational\nFamilies of Christianity).] See also [http://www.zpub.com/un/pope/relig.html\nWorldwide Adherents of All Religions by Six Continental Areas, Mid-1995]\nmany others hold that only believerâs baptism is true baptism. Some insist on\nsubmersion or at least partial immersion of the person who is baptized, others\nconsider that any form of washing by water, as long as the water flows on the\nhead, is sufficient. The term \"baptism\" has also been used to refer to any\nceremony, trial, or experience by which a person is initiated, purified, or\ngiven a name âsee Other initiation
