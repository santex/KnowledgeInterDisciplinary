The original model had a formatted\ncapacity of 5 MB and connected to a special interface card that plugged into an\nApple III slot. In 1983 Apple offered a ProFile interface card for the Apple II,\nwith software support for ProDOS and Apple Pascal.\n\nAlso in 1983, Apple introduced the Lisa computer, which was normally sold with a\nProFile. The ProFile could be connected to the built-in parallel port of the\nLisa, or to a port of an optional dual-port parallel interface card. Up to three\nsuch interface cards could be installed, so in principle up to seven ProFile\ndrives could be used on a Lisa.\n\nThe 5 MB ProFile was Apple's first hard drive, and was introduced in September\n1981 at a price of US$ 3499. Later a 10 MB model was offered, but required an\nupgraded PROM/interface card to recognize the additional 5MB.\n\nInternally, the ProFile consisted of a bare Seagate ST-506 stepper motor drive\nand mechanism, without the usual Seagate electronics, a digital and an analog\ncircuit board designed and manufactured by Apple, and a power supply.\n\nLater Lisa models could be configured with an internal 10 MB \"Widget\" voice-coil\ndrive with a proprietary controller designed and built entirely by Apple, but\nthe Widget was never offered as an external product for use with other Apple\ncomputers.\n\nApple did not offer another hard drive until it released the Hard Disk 20\ndesigned specifically for the Macintosh 512K in September 1985 which could not\nbe used on the Apple II or III families, or Lisa series. The ProFile could not\nbe used on the Macintosh or the Apple IIc computer (for which Apple never\noffered an external hard disk drive of any kind).\n\nBy September 1986, the ProFile would be superseded by the introduction of the\nfirst cross-platform Hard Disk 20SC SCSI-based drive for the Macintosh and\ninterface card for the Apple II family (excluding the IIc series, which had no\nSCSI interface of any kind) and Lisa/XL series.\n","linknr":331,"url":"Apple_ProFile","recorded":1362675885,"links":19,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Apple II family|ProFile","Apple II peripherals","Apple Inc. peripherals","Hard disk drives"],"headings":[],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/Apple_Lisa.jpg/220px-Apple_Lisa.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c3/Microelectronics_stub.svg/40px-Microelectronics_stub.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Hard_drive","Apple_Computer","Apple_III","Personal_computer","Megabyte","Apple_II","ProDOS","Apple_Pascal","Apple_Lisa","US$","Programmable_read-only_memory","Seagate_Technology","ST-506","Apple_Widget","Voice_coil","Hard_Disk_20","Macintosh_512K","Apple_IIc","Hard_Disk_20SC"]}
