The structure is also known as a\n'hairpin' or 'hairpin loop.' It occurs when two regions of the same strand,\nusually complementary in nucleotide sequence when read in opposite directions,\nbase-pair to form a double helix that ends in an unpaired loop. The resulting\nstructure is a key building block of many RNA secondary structures.\n","linknr":147,"url":"Hairpin_loop","recorded":1362374283,"links":23,"instances":["genetics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["RNA","DNA"],"headings":["Formation and stability","Structural contexts","Example","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3f/Stem-loop.svg/336px-Stem-loop.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["translation","genetics"]],"members":["translation"],"related":["Base_pair","DNA","RNA","Nucleotide","Guanine","Cytosine","Hydrogen_bond","Adenine","Uracil","Pi_bond","Aromatic","Steric_effects","Pseudoknot","Tetraloop","MicroRNA","Transfer_RNA","Codon","Translation_(genetics)","Pseudoknot","Ribozyme","Hammerhead_ribozyme","Hammerhead_ribozyme","Ribosome_binding_site","Initiation","Translation","Prokaryote","Rho-independent_transcription_termination","MRNA","RNA_polymerase","5'_end","3'_end","Dyad_symmetry","Inverted_repeat","Palindromic_sequence","Repeat_sequences"]}
