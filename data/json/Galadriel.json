Tolkien, appearing in his Middle-\nearth legendarium. She appears in [[The Lord of the Rings]], [[The\nSilmarillion]], and [[Unfinished Tales]].\n\nShe was a royal Elf of both the Noldor and the Teleri, being a grandchild of\nboth King FinwÃ« and King OlwÃ«, and was also close kin of King IngwÃ« of the\nVanyar through her grandmother Indis. She was one of the leaders in the\nrebellion of the Noldor and their flight from Valinor during the First Age, and\nshe was the only prominent Noldo to return at the end of the Third Age. Towards\nthe end of her stay in Middle-earth she was co-ruler of LothlÃ³rien with her\nhusband, Lord Celeborn, and was referred to variously as the 'Lady of LÃ³rien',\nthe 'Lady of the [[Galadhrim]]', the 'Lady of Light', or the 'Lady of the Golden\nWood'. Her daughter CelebrÃ­an was the wife of Elrond and mother of Arwen,\nElladan and Elrohir.\n\nTolkien describes Galadriel as \"the mightiest and fairest of all the Elves that\nremained in Middle-earth\" (after the death of Gil-galad) \"Of the Rings of\nPower and the Third Age\" in The Silmarillion (1977, Houghton Mifflin), p.\n298. and the \"greatest of elven women\". \"Appendix B: The Tale of\nYears\" of [[The Return of the King]], volume 3 of The Lord of the Rings.\n","linknr":544,"url":"Galadriel","recorded":1362484757,"links":47,"instances":["1981_radio_series","arts","song","musician"],"pdf":[],"categories":["High Elves","Fictional nobility","Characters in The Lord of the Rings","Characters in The Silmarillion","Middle-earth rulers","Noldor","Teleri","Fictional telepaths","Fictional princesses","Fictional characters introduced in 1954"],"headings":["Literature","Adaptations","Legacy in music","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/25/Lotr-2-2652-galadriel.jpg/200px-Lotr-2-2652-galadriel.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/cb/Galadriel.jpg/200px-Galadriel.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/Arda.Tengwar.svg/18px-Arda.Tengwar.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["elf","middle-earth"],["character","arts"],["elf","middle-earth"],["vala","middle-earth"],["exiles","middle-earth"],["lindon","middle-earth"],["nandor","middle-earth"],["amroth","middle-earth"],["lindon","middle-earth"],["nandor","middle-earth"],["moria","middle-earth"],["gimli","middle-earth"],["eldar","middle-earth"],["dwarf","middle-earth"],["the_lord_of_the_rings","1981_radio_series"],["shire","middle-earth"],["john_lees","musician"],["into_the_west","song"],["magic","middle-earth"]],"members":["the_lord_of_the_rings","nandor","lindon","eldar","elf","magic","character","amroth","moria","shire","into_the_west","exiles","vala","gimli","john_lees","dwarf"],"related":["Galadhrim","Elf_(Middle-earth)","Character_(arts)","J.R.R._Tolkien","Middle-earth","Tolkien's_legendarium","Elf_(Middle-earth)","Noldor","Teleri","Finwë","Olwë","Ingwë","Vanyar","Indis","Lothlórien","Celeborn","Celebrían","Elrond","Arwen","Elladan_and_Elrohir","Gil-galad","Of_the_Rings_of_Power_and_the_Third_Age","Finarfin","Noldor","Eärwen","Lúthien","Finrod_Felagund","Angrod","Aegnor","Valinor","Years_of_the_Trees","Indis","Aman","Fëanor","Kinslaying_at_Alqualondë","Beleriand","Nargothrond","Thingol","Melian","Doriath","Vala_(Middle-earth)","Exiles_(Middle-earth)","Undying_Lands","One_Ring","Alqualondë","Olwë","Beleriand","Helcaraxë","Battles_of_Beleriand","Beleriand","War_of_Wrath","Lindon_(Middle-earth)","Fiefdom","Gil-galad","Eregion","Nandor_(Middle-earth)","Anduin","Celebrimbor","Amroth_(Middle-earth)","Númenor","Tar-Aldarion","Gil-galad","Lindon_(Middle-earth)","Lothlórien","Celebrían","Elrond","Half-elven","Rivendell","Celeborn","Elladan","Elrohir","Arwen_Undómiel","Reunited_Kingdom","Gondor","Arnor","Second_Age","Rings_of_Power","Sauron","Aulë","Dol_Amroth","War_of_the_Last_Alliance","One_Ring","Third_Age","Nandor_(Middle-earth)","Silvan_Elves","Mirkwood","Moria_(Middle-earth)","Caras_Galadhon","Boromir","Frodo_Baggins","Dominion_of_Men","Gandalf","Gwaihir","Istari","War_of_the_Ring","Dol_Guldur","Lúthien","Tol_Sirion","First_Age","Belegaer","Gandalf","Ring-bearers","Bilbo_Baggins","Sindarin","Telerin","Quenya","Sindarin","Wood-elves","Dúnedain","Quenya","Tirion","Two_Trees","Laurelin","Telperion","Fëanor","Silmaril","Gimli_(Middle-earth)","Eldar_(Middle-earth)","Finarfin","Finrod_Felagund","Dwarf_(Middle-earth)","Peter_Jackson","Annette_Crosbie","Ralph_Bakshi","1978_in_film","BBC_Radio","The_Lord_of_the_Rings_(1981_radio_series)","Trilogy","Cate_Blanchett","War_of_the_Last_Alliance","Telepathy","Elrond","Shire_(Middle-earth)","Boromir","Denethor","Gondor","Aragorn","The_Hobbit_film_project","Rebecca_Jackson_Mendoza","Toronto,_Canada","Drury_Lane","Laura_Michelle_Kelly","Namárië","Quenya","Blessed_Realm","Valar","Valinor","Donald_Swann","Gregorian_chant","Barclay_James_Harvest","John_Lees_(musician)","John_Lennon","Epiphone_Casino","Terry_Britten","Cliff_Richard","Sally_Oldfield","Ross_Ryan","Fran_Walsh","Howard_Shore","Annie_Lennox","Into_the_West_(song)","Annie_Lennox","Belegaer","Yulia_Townsend","Will_Martin","House_of_Finarfin","Magic_(Middle-earth)","White_Council"]}
