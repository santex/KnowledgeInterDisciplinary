{"cursor":"10819","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In general, electrophiles are positively charged species that are attracted to\nan electron rich centre. In chemistry, an 'electrophile' (literally electron-\nlover) is a reagent attracted to electrons that participates in a chemical\nreaction by accepting an electron pair in order to bond to a nucleophile.\nBecause electrophiles accept electrons, they are Lewis acids (see acid-base\nreaction theories). Most electrophiles are positively charged, have an atom that\ncarries a partial positive charge, or have an atom that does not have an octet\nof electrons.\n\nThe electrophiles are attacked by the most electron-populated part of one\nnucleophile. The electrophiles frequently seen in the organic syntheses are\ncations such as H + and NO +, polarized neutral molecules\nsuch as HCl, alkyl halides, acyl halides, and carbonyl compounds, polarizable\nneutral molecules such as Cl 2 and Br 2, oxidizing agents\nsuch as organic peracids, chemical species that do not satisfy the octet rule\nsuch as carbenes and radicals, and some lewis acids such as BH 3\nand DIBAL.\n","linknr":237,"url":"Electrophile","recorded":1362559115,"links":33,"instances":["element","chemistry","chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Physical organic chemistry"],"headings":["Electrophiles in organic chemistry","Electrophilicity scale","Superelectrophiles","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9b/Electrophilic_addition_of_Br2.png/410px-Electrophilic_addition_of_Br2.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/eb/Electrophilic_addition_of_HCl.png/390px-Electrophilic_addition_of_HCl.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/Electrophilic_reaction_of_sulfuric_acid_with_ethene.png/580px-Electrophilic_reaction_of_sulfuric_acid_with_ethene.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/b/5/0/b50b3dd6831c45768945ff3fad196841.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/a/2/4/a24251a8311e1e142582c1dd34750e74.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/d/7/7/d770ed7061d0265e8cac05d7418a76e6.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/7/e/07e381e60696bcbd7f8de650fb750719.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/1/5/3/153fc2a5a0a49d52dda62d96ae0a293f.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/c/3/f/c3f97a4420c67227501e8aa037c1c616.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["radical","chemistry"],["vicinal","chemistry"],["mercury","element"]],"members":["mercury","vicinal","radical"],"related":["Chemistry","Reagent","Electron","Electron_pair","Chemical_bond","Nucleophile","Lewis_acid","Acid-base_reaction_theories","Electric_charge","Nucleophile","Organic_synthesis","Cations","Hydrogen_ion","Nitrosonium","Hydrogen_chloride","Alkyl_halide","Acyl_halide","Carbonyl_compound","Chlorine","Bromine","Oxidizing_agent","Peracid","Octet_rule","Carbene","Radical_(chemistry)","Borane","Diisobutylaluminium_hydride","Electrophilic_addition","Alkenes","Hydrogenation","Electrophilic_addition","Hydration_reaction","Halogen_addition_reaction","Titration","Ethene","Bromine","1,2-Dibromoethane","Pi-complex","Bromonium_ion","Vicinal_(chemistry)","Antiperiplanar","Iodine","Chlorine","Sulfenyl","Mercury_(element)","Dichlorocarbene","Carbenium_ion","Hydrohalogenation","Stereoselectivity","Markovnikov's_rule","Hydrogen_fluoride","Hydration_reaction","Sulfuric_acid","Catalyst","Carbocation","Ethanol","Fluorine","Chlorine","Bromine","Iodine","Hypochlorite","Sulfur_dioxide","Carbon_disulfide","Benzene","Sodium","Chem._Rev.","Robert_Parr","J._Am._Chem._Soc.","Omega","Electronegativity","Chemical_hardness","Electric_power","Electrical_resistance","Ohm","Voltage","Free_radical","Tert-butyl","Superacid","George_A._Olah","J._Am._Chem._Soc.","Acetic_acid","Boron_trifluoride","Isobutane","Hydrofluoric_acid","Superacid","Reactive_intermediate","Methane","Nitromethane","Nitronium_tetrafluoroborate","Fluorosulfuric_acid","Nitronium_ion","Selectfluor","J._Org._Chem.","Nucleophile"]}
