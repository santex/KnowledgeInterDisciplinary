The structure of these molecules is frequently decomposed into primary\nstructure, secondary structure, tertiary structure, and quaternary structure.\nThe scaffold for this structure is provided by secondary structural elements\nwhich are hydrogen bonds within the molecule. This leads to several recognizable\n\"domains\" of protein structure and nucleic acid structure, including secondary\nstructure like hairpin loops, bulges and internal loops for nucleic acids, and\nalpha helices and beta sheets for proteins.\n\nThe terms primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structure were first\ncoined by Kaj Ulrik LinderstrÃ¸m-Lang in his 1951 Lane Medical Lectures at\nStanford University.\n","linknr":397,"url":"Tertiary_structure","recorded":1362512498,"links":23,"instances":["file_format","biology","protein"],"pdf":["http://www.nature.com/nature/dna50/franklingosling.pdf","http://www.nature.com/nature/dna50/franklingosling.pdf","http://www.nature.com/nature/dna50/wilkins.pdf","http://www.nature.com/nature/dna50/wilkins.pdf"],"categories":["Biomolecules"],"headings":["Primary structure","Secondary structure","Tertiary structure","Quaternary structure","Structure determination","Structure prediction","Design","Other biomolecules","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/Protein_structure.png/500px-Protein_structure.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf8/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/TRNA_all2.png/250px-TRNA_all2.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf8/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7c/TRNA_structure_space.png/220px-TRNA_structure_space.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf8/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg/20px-Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["dssp","protein"],["protein_data_bank","file_format"],["homology","biology"]],"members":["protein_data_bank","homology","dssp"],"related":["Protein","DNA","RNA","Hydrogen_bond","Protein_structure","Nucleic_acid_structure","Hairpin_loop","Alpha_helix","Beta_sheet","Kaj_Ulrik_Linderstrøm-Lang","Stanford_University","Biochemistry","Stereochemistry","Biopolymer","Molecule","DNA","RNA","Protein","Monomer","Nucleotide_sequence","Peptide_sequence","Sequence_motif","SnoRNA","LSm","U1_spliceosomal_RNA","U2_spliceosomal_RNA","U4_spliceosomal_RNA","U5_spliceosomal_RNA","U6_spliceosomal_RNA","U12_minor_spliceosomal_RNA","Small_nucleolar_RNA_U3","Shine-Dalgarno_sequence","Kozak_consensus_sequence","RNA_polymerase_III","Biochemistry","Structural_biology","Biopolymer","Protein","Nucleic_acid","Hydrogen_bond","DSSP_(protein)","Dihedral_angle","Ramachandran_plot","Differential_geometry","Curvature","Torsion","Protein_Data_Bank_(file_format)","Basepair","Tetraloop","Pseudoknot","Stem-loop","Intrinsic_termination","Transfer_RNA","Nucleic_acid_structure_determination","Nucleic_acid_structure_prediction","List_of_RNA_structure_prediction_software","Biochemistry","Molecular_biology","Protein","Macromolecule","Primary_structure","Amino_acid","Nucleotide","Biochemistry","Protein_folding","Protein","Chromatin","Histone","Ribosome","Spliceosome","NMR_spectroscopy","X-ray_crystallography","X-ray_scattering_techniques","Patterson_function","Bessel_function","Paracrystalline","Fourier_transform","Molecular_model","Protein","Amino_acid","Nucleic_acid","Nucleobase","Bioinformatics","Theoretical_chemistry","Medicine","Drug_design","Biotechnology","Enzymes","CASP","Bioinformatics","Secondary_structure","Base_pair","Hydrogen_bond","Base_stacking","Nearest-neighbor_thermodynamic_parameters","Homology_(biology)","Evolution","Nucleotide","NP-complete","Polysaccharide","Polyphenol","Lipid","Non-coding_RNA","List_of_RNA_structure_prediction_software","List_of_nucleic_acid_simulation_software"]}
