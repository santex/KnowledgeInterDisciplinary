{"cursor":"3752","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Sharif Khan' is a retired professional squash player. He is widely considered\nto be one of the all-time great players of hardball squash (a North American\nvariant of squash played with a faster-moving ball and on slightly smaller\ncourts than the international \"softball\" squash game). He was the dominant\nplayer on the hardball squash circuit throughout the 1970s. Sharif was born in\nPakistan, and is the son of the legendary squash player Hashim Khan (who\ndominated the international squash game in the 1950s).\n\nSharif is the eldest of Hashim Khan's 12 children. At the age of 11, he was\nawarded a squash scholarship at Millfield School in Somerset, England. Despite\nhaving almost no knowledge of the English language when he arrived, he\nperformed well academically also developed into an outstanding squash player\nwho, by 1962, had won every public school title open to him including the\npublic schools under-15 championship (three times), the public schools under-16\nchampionship, the Evans Cup, and the Drysdale Cup (considered at the time to be\nthe unofficial world junior championship). At the age of 13 he also captured\nthe Somerset County Men's A title. In the two years after he left Millfield,\nSharif won the West of England title, the East of England title, the Surrey\nOpen and the Scottish Amateur title. In 1970, he reached the semi-finals of the\nBritish Open (which was considered to be the effective world championship of\nthe sport at the time).\n\nKhan's greatest achievements came on the North American hardball squash circuit.\nHe settled in Canada in 1968, and came to dominate the professional hardball\nsquash circuit for well over a decade. He captured every major North American\nhardball title, and won the North American Open (the most prestigious hardball\ntitle at the time) a record 12 times in 13 years between 1969 and 1981 (he\nreached the final 15 consecutive times between 1968 and 1982). He also won the\nUS Professional Championships nine times in ten years between 1970 and 1979.\n\nIn winning his final North American open title in 1981, Sharif beat his younger\nbrother Aziz Khan in the final. Three other brothers, Gulmast, Liaqat Ali\n(\"Charlie\"), and Salim (\"Sam\"), also competed in top-level hardball squash.\n\nSince retiring from top-level competition, Khan has remained actively involved\nin coaching and promoting squash, and has continued to play in veterans' events.\nIn 2004, Khan became the first non-US citizen to be inducted into to the United\nStates Squash Racquets Association Hall of Fame.\n","linknr":96,"url":"Sharif_Khan","recorded":1375080501,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Sharif_Khan&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Sharif_Khan&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Squash_(sport)","/wiki/Wikipedia:Avoid_weasel_words","/wiki/Hardball_squash","/wiki/North_America","/wiki/Pakistan","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/wiki/Hashim_Khan","/wiki/Millfield","/wiki/Somerset","/wiki/England","/wiki/British_Open_Squash_Championships","/wiki/Canada","/wiki/United_States_Open_(squash)","/wiki/Tournament_of_Champions_(squash)","/wiki/Aziz_Khan_(squash_player)","/wiki/U.S._Squash","/w/index.php?title=Sharif_Khan&action=edit&section=1","http://www.squashtalk.com/pakistan/khanstory2.htm","http://www.squashtalk.com/pakistan/diner_khan3.htm","http://www.squashtalk.com/html/columns/diner-2001-6a.htm","http://www.pakpositive.com/2004/10/21/sharif-khan-becomes-first-non-american-to-enter-us-squash-hall-of-fame/","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sharif_Khan&oldid=550284225","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Pakistani_squash_players","/wiki/Category:People_educated_at_Millfield","/wiki/Category:Living_people","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_specifically_marked_weasel-worded_phrases_from_January_2010","/wiki/Category:All_articles_with_unsourced_statements","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_unsourced_statements_from_January_2010","/wiki/Category:Year_of_birth_missing_(living_people)","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Sharif+Khan&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Sharif+Khan","/wiki/Sharif_Khan","/wiki/Talk:Sharif_Khan","#","/wiki/Sharif_Khan","/w/index.php?title=Sharif_Khan&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Sharif_Khan&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Sharif_Khan","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Sharif_Khan","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Sharif_Khan&oldid=550284225","/w/index.php?title=Sharif_Khan&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7489666","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Sharif_Khan&id=550284225","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Sharif+Khan","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Sharif+Khan&oldid=550284225&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Sharif_Khan&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7489666#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharif_Khan","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":["squash_player","squash","sport","squash"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Pakistani
