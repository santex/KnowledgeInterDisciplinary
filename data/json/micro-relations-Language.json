The\nscientific study of language is called linguistics. Any estimate of the precise\nnumber of languages in the world depends on a partly arbitrary distinction\nbetween languages and dialects. However, estimates vary between 6,000 and 7,000\nlanguages in number. Natural languages are spoken or signed, but any language\ncan be encoded into secondary media using auditory, visual, or tactile stimuli,\nfor example, in graphic writing, braille, or whistling. This is because human\nlanguage is modality-independent. When used as a general concept, \"language\" may\nrefer to the cognitive ability to learn and use systems of complex\ncommunication, or to describe the set of rules that makes up these systems, or\nthe set of utterances that can be produced from those rules. All languages rely\non the process of semiosis to relate signs with particular meanings. Oral and\nsign languages contain a phonological system that governs how symbols are used\nto form sequences known as words or morphemes, and a syntactic system that\ngoverns how words and morphemes are combined to form phrases and utterances.\n\nHuman language is unique because it has the properties of productivity,\nrecursivity, and displacement, and because it relies entirely on social\nconvention and learning. Its complex structure therefore affords a much wider\nrange of possible expressions and uses than any known system of animal\ncommunication. Language is thought to have originated when early hominins\nstarted gradually changing their primate communication systems, acquiring the\nability to form a theory of other minds and a shared intentionality.\n\nThis development is sometimes thought to have coincided with an increase in\nbrain volume, and many linguists see the structures of language as having\nevolved to serve specific communicative and social functions. Language is\nprocessed in many different locations in the human brain, but especially in\nBroca's and Wernicke's areas. Humans acquire language through social interaction\nin early childhood, and children generally speak fluently when they are\napproximately three years old. The use of language is deeply entrenched in human\nculture. Therefore, in addition to its strictly communicative uses, language\nalso has many social and cultural uses, such as signifying group identity,\nsocial stratification, as well as for social grooming and entertainment.\n\nLanguages evolve and diversify over time, and the history of their evolution can\nbe reconstructed by comparing modern languages to determine which traits their\nancestral languages must have had in order for the later stages to have\noccurred. A group of languages that descend from a common ancestor is known as a\nlanguage family. The languages that are most spoken in the world today belong to\nthe Indo-European family, which includes languages such as English, Spanish,\nPortuguese, Russian, and Hindi; the Sino-Tibetan languages, which include\nMandarin Chinese, Cantonese, and many others; Semitic languages, which include\nArabic, Amharic, and Hebrew; and the Bantu languages, which include Swahili,\nZulu, Shona, and hundreds of other languages spoken throughout Africa. The\ngeneral consensus is that between 50 and 90% of languages spoken today will\nprobably have become extinct by the year 2100.\n","linknr":1959,"url":"Language","recorded":1362565569,"links":253,"instances":["grammar","linguistics","script","linguistics","linguistics","semiotics","linguistics","grammar","grammar","grammar","linguistics","physiology","linguistics","semiotics","semiotics","linguistics","linguistics","gorilla","linguistics","grammar","biology","phonetics","linguistics","sociolinguistics","social_science","case","linguistics","philologist","linguistics","linguistics","linguistics"],"pdf":["http://www.isc.cnrs.fr/FN_chapter1.pdf","http://www.isc.cnrs.fr/FN_chapter1.pdf"],"categories":["Human
