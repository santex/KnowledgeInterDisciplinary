{"cursor":"6214","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Amperometry' in chemistry and biochemistry is detection of ions in a solution\nbased on electric current or changes in electric current.\n\nAmperometry is used in electrophysiology to study vesicle release events using a\ncarbon fiber electrode. Unlike patch clamp techniques, the electrode used for\namperometry is not inserted into or attached to the cell, but brought in close\nproximity of the cell. The measurements from the electrode originate from an\noxidizing reaction of a vesicle cargo released into the medium. Another\ntechnique used to measure vesicle release is capacitive measurements.\n","linknr":139,"url":"Amperometry","recorded":1362481292,"links":10,"instances":["medicine","biology","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Electrophysiology"],"headings":["History","Detection Methods","Principle","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cell","biology"],["tissue","biology"],["implant","medicine"]],"members":["implant","tissue","cell"],"related":["Chemistry","Biochemistry","Electrophysiology","Synaptic_vesicle","Patch_clamp","Electrode","Cell_(biology)","Redox","Capacitance","Electrochemistry","Ion_chromatography","Electrode","Carbohydrates","Amines","Sulfur","Neurotransmitter","Electrochemistry","Tissue_(biology)","Electric_current","Implant_(medicine)","Striatum","Chromaffin_cell","Catecholamine","Direct_current","Electrodes","Effluent","Cyanide","Sulfide","Hydrazine"]}
