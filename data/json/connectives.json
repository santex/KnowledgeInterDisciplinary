Also commonly, negation is considered to be a 'unary\nconnective'.\n\nLogical connectives along with quantifiers are the two main types of logical\nconstants used in formal systems such as propositional logic and predicate\nlogic. Semantics of a logical connective is often, but not always, presented as\na truth function.\n","title":"Logical%20connective","headings":["In language","Common logical connectives","Properties","Order of precedence","Computer science","See also","Notes","References","Further reading","External links"]},"micro-relation":["7: Material_conditional","5: Logical_conjunction","4: Negation","4: Truth_function","4: Logical_biconditional","3: Logical_disjunction","3: Exclusive_or","3: Classical_logic","3: Giuseppe_Peano","3: Elementary_algebra","2: Logical_constant","2: Sheffer_stroke","2: Logical_NOR","2: Truth","2: Contradiction","2: Converse_implication","2: Bertrand_Russell","2: Moses_Schönfinkel","2: George_Boole","2: Charles_Sanders_Peirce","2: David_Hilbert","2: Alfred_Tarski","2: Gerhard_Gentzen","2: Boolean_function","2: Truth_value","2: Truth_table","2: Validity","2: Logic_gate","2: Stanford_Encyclopedia_of_Philosophy","1: Logic","1: Word","1: Formal_language","1: Natural_language","1: Operand","1: Quantifier","1: Formal_system","1: Propositional_logic","1: Predicate_logic","1: Grammatical_conjunction","1: Well-formed_formula","1: Arity","1: Truth_function#Table_of_binary_truth_functions","1: Arend_Heyting","1: Heyting","1: Gottlob_Frege","1: Begriffsschrift","1: Boolean_ring","1: Two-element_Boolean_algebra","1: Jan_Łukasiewicz","1: Logical_equivalence","1: Syntactic_sugar","1: Binary_numeral_system","1: Functionally_complete","1: Truth_function#Functional_completeness","1: Axiom","1: Intuitionistic_logic","1: Many-valued_logic","1: Order_of_operations","1: Digital_circuit","1: DRAM","1: Logical_nand","1: Logical_nor","1: Truth_function#Computer_science","1: Bit_array","1: Bitwise_operation","1: Computer_programming","1: Lazy_evaluation","1: Constructive_mathematics","1: Boolean_domain","1: Boolean_logic","1: Boolean-valued_function","1: List_of_Boolean_algebra_topics","1: Modal_operator","1: Propositional_calculus","1: Józef_Maria_Bocheński","1: Abstract_algebraic_logic"]}
