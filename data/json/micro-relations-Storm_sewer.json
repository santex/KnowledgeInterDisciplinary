Storm drains vary in design\nfrom small residential dry wells to large municipal systems. They are fed by\nstreet gutters on most motorways, freeways and other busy roads, as well as\ntowns in areas which experience heavy rainfall, flooding and coastal towns which\nexperience regular storms. Many storm drainage systems are designed to drain the\nstorm water, untreated, into rivers or streams.\n","linknr":464,"url":"Storm_sewer","recorded":1362372145,"links":50,"instances":["hydrology","geographical_feature"],"pdf":["http://www.mdt2center.umd.edu/newsletter/archives/technotes-spring-09.pdf","http://www.mdt2center.umd.edu/newsletter/archives/technotes-spring-09.pdf","http://depts.washington.edu/cwws/Research/Reports/permeableparking.pdf","http://www.epa.gov/nrmrl/pubs/600ja99275/600ja99275.pdf","http://www.epa.gov/npdes/pubs/owm0111.pdf"],"categories":["Drainage","Environmental
