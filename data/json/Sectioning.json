{"cursor":"51497","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Involuntary commitment' or 'civil commitment' is a legal process through which\nan individual with symptoms of severe mental illness is court-ordered into\ntreatment in a hospital (inpatient) or in the community (outpatient).\n\nCriteria for civil commitment are established by law, which varies between\nnations, in the U.S., from state to state, and in Canada, from province to\nprovince. Commitment proceedings often follow a period of emergency\nhospitalization during which an individual with acute psychiatric symptoms is\nconfined for a relatively short duration (e.g. 72 hours) in a treatment facility\nfor evaluation and stabilization by mental health professionals â who may then\ndetermine whether further civil commitment is appropriate or necessary. If civil\ncommitment proceedings follow, the evaluation is presented in a formal court\nhearing where testimony and other evidence may also be submitted. The subject of\nthe hearing is typically entitled to legal counsel and may challenge a\ncommitment order through habeas corpus rules. }}.\n\nHistorically, until the first third of the twentieth century or later in most\njurisdictions, all committals to public psychiatric facilities and most\ncommittals to private ones were involuntary. Since then, there have been\nalternating trends towards the abolition or substantial reduction of involuntary\ncommitment, a trend known as \"deinstitutionalisation.\"\n","linknr":529,"url":"Sectioning","recorded":1362671741,"links":41,"instances":["finland","law","psychiatric_patient","involuntary_psychiatric_hold","united_states","city","city","care_and_treatment_act"],"pdf":["http://www.equalrightstrust.org/ertdocumentbank/UN_Resolution_on_protection_of_persons_with_mental_illness.pdf","http://www.texasbar.com/Content/NavigationMenu/ForThePublic/FreeLegalInformation/FamilyLaw/CommittedtoHealingInvoluntaryCommitmentProcedures.pdf","http://www.texasbar.com/Content/NavigationMenu/ForThePublic/FreeLegalInformation/FamilyLaw/CommittedtoHealingInvoluntaryCommitmentProcedures.pdf","http://www.jaapl.org/cgi/reprint/36/4/443.pdf","http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/09pdf/08-1224.pdf","http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/09pdf/08-1224.pdf","http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/649001p.pdf","http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/649001p.pdf","http://www.equalrightstrust.org/ertdocumentbank/UN_Resolution_on_protection_of_persons_with_mental_illness.pdf"],"categories":["Anti-psychiatry","Medical
