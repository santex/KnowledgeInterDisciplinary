He holds a Bachelor of Science degree from the University of Waterloo.\nFrom 1975 until 1979, he worked as a presenter at the Ontario Science Centre.\nIn 1979, he helped found the Toronto-based comedy troupe The\nFrantics. They were heard on their CBC Radio show [[Frantic Times]]\nand their short-lived television series, Four on the Floor. He can be seen as\nBill on [[The Red Green Show]].\n\nHis first job was as a Demonstrator at the Ontario Science Centre. As well as presenting shows on Lasers, Electricity,\nCryogenics, etc., Rick developed numerous original programs, science plays and\nexhibits that combined information, humour and entertainment.\n\nIn 1979 he plunged into show biz full time as a member of The Frantics comedy\ntroupe. For the next 8 years they created and performed hundreds of live\nappearances, 150 radio shows, several albums, a half dozen hit stage shows and\nthe groundbreaking TV series Four On The Floor. In 2003, the Frantics came out\nof retirement and again performed on stage and television.\n\nIn 1989, Green became âCommander Rickâ, the writer and host of TVOâs speculative\nfiction news magazine series [[Prisoners of Gravity]].\n\nAt the same time, Rick joined Steve Smith to co-create [[The Red Green\nShow]]. He wrote & performed in the show for 11 seasons as the bumbling\noutdoorsman Bill. [[The Red Green Show]] has spun off books (which Rick co-\nwrote and illustrated), DVDâs, CDs and more. It remains Canadaâs longest-\nrunning comedy series.\n\nIn 1999, Green created [[History Bites]]. The Separatists has been nominated for\na Canadian Screenwriters Award. In 2004, Rick was named by the Ontario History\nTeachers as their âPerson of the Yearâ. Based on the success of [[History\nBites]], Green was invited to become a member of the advisory board for the\nHistori.ca foundation in 2003.\n\nGreen was diagnosed as having attention deficit disorder, after one of his\nchildren was found to have it. In 2009\nGreen wrote and directed the documentary about Attention Deficit Hyperactivity\nDisorder in adults, entitled ADD & Loving it?! The film, featuring fellow\ncomedian Patrick McKenna won a New York Festivals Silver Award and earned Rick\nthe CAMH Foundation Transforming Lives Award for 2009. The two largest ADHD\nadvocacy groups in America, CHADD and ADD, have both endorsed the film,\nsomething they have never done with any book, film or program until now. Green\nis currently co-writing a book with Dr. Umesh Jain of CAMH entitled, ADD Stole\nMy Car Keys.\n\nHis projects have won Gemini Awards, ACTRA Awards, New York Festival Awards, and\nvarious educational awards. His material has been performed by talented actors\nsuch as Jim Carrey, Gordon Pinsent, David Steinberg, Graham Chapman, Colin\nMochrie, Graham Greene, Eric Stoltz, and Martin Short. In 2004 he wrote Kim\nCattrallâs HBO special, Sexual Intelligence.\n\nIn September 2007, Green was honoured by the University of Waterloo, as one of\nthe top 50 Alumni of the past 50 years.\n","linknr":150,"url":"Rick_Green","recorded":1375065328,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Rick_Green&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Rick_Green&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Rick_Green_(disambiguation)","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Biographies_of_living_persons","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability","/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources","/wiki/Defamation","/wiki/File:Rick-green.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/Rick-green.jpg/150px-Rick-green.jpg","/wiki/Toronto","/wiki/Ontario","/wiki/Canada","/wiki/Canada","/wiki/Comedian","/wiki/University_of_Waterloo","/wiki/The_Frantics_(comedy)","#cite_note-1","/wiki/CBC_Radio","/wiki/Frantic_Times","/wiki/The_Red_Green_Show","/wiki/Ontario_Science_Centre","#cite_note-Read-2","/wiki/The_Frantics_(comedy)","/wiki/TVOntario","/wiki/Prisoners_of_Gravity","/wiki/Steve_Smith_(comedian)","/wiki/The_Red_Green_Show","/wiki/The_Red_Green_Show","/wiki/History_Bites","/wiki/History_Bites","/wiki/Attention_deficit_disorder","#cite_note-Goddard-3","#cite_note-4","/wiki/Attention_Deficit_Hyperactivity_Disorder","/wiki/ADD_%26_Loving_it","/wiki/Patrick_McKenna","/wiki/Centre_for_Addiction_and_Mental_Health","/wiki/Gemini_Awards","/wiki/ACTRA_Awards","/wiki/Jim_Carrey","/wiki/Gordon_Pinsent","/wiki/David_Steinberg","/wiki/Graham_Chapman","/wiki/Colin_Mochrie","/wiki/Graham_Greene","/wiki/Eric_Stoltz","/wiki/Martin_Short","/wiki/Kim_Cattrall","/wiki/HBO","/wiki/University_of_Waterloo","/w/index.php?title=Rick_Green&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","http://www.zuza.com/news-story/46113-frantic-reunion-promises-big-laughs/","/wiki/City_Centre_Mirror","#cite_ref-Read_2-0","http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=EqJlAAAAIBAJ&sjid=oIwNAAAAIBAJ&dq=rick-green%20science%20centre&pg=4657%2C86805","#cite_ref-Goddard_3-0","http://www.webcitation.org/6A8dpJhnR","/wiki/Toronto_Star","http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/article/632723","#cite_ref-4","http://www.webcitation.org/6A8dyLtKU","http://totallyadd.com/about/the-team/","/w/index.php?title=Rick_Green&action=edit&section=2","http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0338279/","/wiki/Internet_Movie_Database","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/16473050","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","/wiki/Toronto","/wiki/Ontario","/wiki/Canada","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rick_Green&oldid=563025049","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1953_births","/wiki/Category:Canadian_television_comedians","/wiki/Category:Living_people","/wiki/Category:University_of_Waterloo_alumni","/wiki/Category:People_with_attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder","/wiki/Category:BLP_articles_lacking_sources_from_August_2012","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_hCards","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Rick+Green&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Rick+Green","/wiki/Rick_Green","/wiki/Talk:Rick_Green","#","/wiki/Rick_Green","/w/index.php?title=Rick_Green&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Rick_Green&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Rick_Green","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Rick_Green","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Rick_Green&oldid=563025049","/w/index.php?title=Rick_Green&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3431549","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Rick_Green&id=563025049","/w/index.php?
