Many such craters are\npresent at the Nevada Test Site, which is no longer in use for nuclear testing.\n\nSubsidence craters are created as the roof of the cavity caused by the\nexplosion collapses. This causes the surface to depress into a sink (which\nsubsidence craters are sometimes called). It is possible for further collapse\nto occur from the sink into the explosion chamber. When this collapse reaches\nthe surface, and the chamber is exposed atmospherically to the surface, it is\nreferred to as a chimney.\n\nIt is at the point that a chimney is formed through which radioactive fallout\nmay reach the surface. At the Nevada Test Site, depths of were used for tests.\n\n Sulky explosion.]] When the material above the explosion is solid rock, then a\n mound may be formed by broken rock that has a greater volume. This type of\n mound has been called \"retarc\", \"crater\" spelled backwards.\n\nWhen a drilling oil well encounters high-pressured gas which cannot be contained\neither by the weight of the drilling mud or by blow-out preventers, the\nresulting violent eruption can create a large crater which can swallow up a\ndrilling rig. This phenomenon is called \"cratering\" in oil field slang.\n","linknr":111,"url":"Subsidence_crater","recorded":1362900474,"links":17,"instances":["nuclear_test","mining","geology","nuclear_test"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Nuclear tests","Underground nuclear explosive tests|","Craters"],"headings":["Gallery","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/Huron_King_Crater_2.jpg/220px-Huron_King_Crater_2.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Whetstone_Sulky_001.jpg/220px-Whetstone_Sulky_001.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c2/Subsidence_craters_at_the_nevada_test_site.jpg/120px-Subsidence_craters_at_the_nevada_test_site.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/Subsidence_crater_in_formation.ogv/120px--Subsidence_crater_in_formation.ogv.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["depression","geology"],["chagan","nuclear_test"],["sedan","nuclear_test"],["glory_hole","mining"]],"members":["chagan","glory_hole","depression","sedan"],"related":["TNT_equivalent","Depression_(geology)","Underground_nuclear_testing","Nevada_Test_Site","Explosion","Nuclear_fallout","Nevada_Test_Site","Underground_nuclear_testing","Chagan_(nuclear_test)","Sedan_(nuclear_test)","Camouflet","Glory_hole_(mining)","Block_caving"]}
