C.Michael Hogan. 2010.\n[http://www.eoearth.org/article/Bacteria?topic=49480 Bacteria. Encyclopedia of\nEarth. eds. Sidney Draggan and C.J. Cleveland, National Council for Science and\nthe Environment, Washington DC] The name \"endospore\" is suggestive of a\nspore or seed-like form (endo means within), but it is not a true spore (i.e.,\nnot an offspring). It is a stripped-down, dormant form to which the bacterium\ncan reduce itself. Endospore formation is usually triggered by a lack of\nnutrients, and usually occurs in Gram-positive bacteria. In endospore formation,\nthe bacterium divides within its cell wall. One side then engulfs the other.\nEndospores enable bacteria to lie dormant for extended periods, even centuries.\nRevival of spores millions of years old has been claimed. Cano RJ, Borucki\nMK (1995) Revival and identification of bacterial spores in 25- to 40-million-year-\nold Dominican amber. Science '268': 1060-1064.  When the environment\nbecomes more favorable, the endospore can reactivate itself to the vegetative\nstate. Most types of bacteria cannot change to the endospore form. Examples of\nbacteria that can form endospores include [[Bacillus]] and\n[[Clostridium]].\n\nThe endospore consists of the bacterium's DNA and part of its cytoplasm,\nsurrounded by a very tough outer coating.\n\nEndospores can survive without nutrients. They are resistant to ultraviolet\nradiation, desiccation, high temperature, extreme freezing and chemical\ndisinfectants. According to scientist Dr. Steinn Sigurdsson, \"There are viable\nbacterial spores that have been found that are 40 million years old on Earth -\nand we know they're very hardened to radiation.\"\nCommon anti-bacterial agents that work by destroying vegetative cell walls do\nnot affect endospores. Endospores are commonly found in soil and water, where\nthey may survive for long periods of time.\n\nSome classes of bacteria can turn into exospores, also known as microbial cysts,\ninstead of endospores. Exospores and endospores are two kinds of \"hibernating\"\nor dormant stages seen in some classes of microorganisms.\n","linknr":367,"url":"Endospore","recorded":1362483359,"links":40,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Bacteriology"],"headings":["Structure","Location","Formation and destruction","Reactivation","Importance","Endospore-forming bacteria","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/Bacillus_subtilis_Spore.jpg/220px-Bacillus_subtilis_Spore.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Bakterien_Sporen.png/260px-Bakterien_Sporen.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Dormancy","Firmicute","Spore","Gram-positive_bacteria","Bacteria","Environment","Ultraviolet_radiation","Microbial_cyst","Sieve","Lysozyme","Molecules","Enzymes","Germination","Peptidoglycan","Protoplast","DNA","Chromatin","Ribosome","Enzymes","Calcium","Dipicolinic_acid","DNA","Moeller_stain","Schaeffer-Fulton_stain","Tetanus","Endosporulation","DNA","Plasma_membrane","Alcohols","Quaternary_ammonium_compounds","Detergents","Alkylation","Ethylene_oxide","Sodium_hypochlorite","Autoclave","Tyndallization","Ionising_radiation","X-ray","Gamma_ray","Cellular_differentiation","Model_organism","Gene_expression","Transcription_factor","Sigma_factor","RNA_polymerase","2001_anthrax_attacks","Anoxybacillus","Sporangium"]}
