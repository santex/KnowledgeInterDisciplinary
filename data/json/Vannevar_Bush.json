His office was considered one of the\nkey factors in winning the war. He is also known in engineering for his work on\nanalog computers, for founding Raytheon, and for the memex, an adjustable\nmicrofilm viewer with a structure analogous to that of the World Wide Web. In\n1945, Bush published [[As We May Think]] in which he predicted that \"wholly new\nforms of encyclopedias will appear, ready made with a mesh of associative trails\nrunning through them, ready to be dropped into the memex and there\namplified\". The memex influenced generations of\ncomputer scientists, who drew inspiration from its vision of the future.\n\nFor his master's thesis, Bush invented and patented a \"profile tracer\", a\nmapping device for assisting surveyors. It was the first of a string of\ninventions. He joined the Department of Electrical Engineering at MIT in 1919,\nand founded the company now known as Raytheon in 1922. Starting in 1927, Bush\nconstructed a differential analyzer, an analog computer with some digital\ncomponents that could solve differential equations with as many as 18\nindependent variables. An offshoot of the work at MIT by Bush and others was the\nbeginning of digital circuit design theory. Bush became Vice President of MIT\nand Dean of the MIT School of Engineering in 1932, and president of the Carnegie\nInstitution of Washington in 1938.\n\nBush was appointed to the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) in\n1938, and soon became its chairman. As Chairman of the National Defense Research\nCommittee (NDRC), and later Director of the Office of Scientific Research and\nDevelopment (OSRD), Bush coordinated the activities of some six thousand leading\nAmerican scientists in the application of science to warfare. Bush was a well-\nknown policymaker and public intellectual during World War II, when he was in\neffect the first presidential science advisor. As head of NDRC and OSRD, he\ninitiated the Manhattan Project, and ensured that it received top priority from\nthe highest levels of government. In Science, The Endless Frontier, his 1945\nreport to the President of the United States, Bush called for an expansion of\ngovernment support for science, and he pressed for the creation of the National\nScience Foundation.\n","recorded":1362124570,"portal":[],"list":[],"links":"1161","instances":["united_states","journal","nuclear_test","information_science","biologist","archaeologist","computing","united_states","computer_scientist","engineer","magazine","united_states","software","engineer","world_war_ii","biochemist","computer","mathematician","biochemist","united_states","psychologist","newspaper","scientist","general","chemist","geophysicist","flying_bomb","mit"],"pdf":["http://books.nap.edu/html/biomems/vbush.pdf","http://books.nap.edu/html/biomems/vbush.pdf","http://www.nasonline.org/publications/biographical-memoirs/memoir-pdfs/bush-vannevar.pdf"],"categories":["1890
