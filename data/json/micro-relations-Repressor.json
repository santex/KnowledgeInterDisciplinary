''Top''': The gene is\nessentially turned off. There is no lactose to inhibit the repressor, so the\nrepressor binds to the operator, which obstructs the RNA polymerase from binding\nto the promoter and making lactase. 'Bottom': The gene is turned on. Lactose is\ninhibiting the repressor, allowing the RNA polymerase to bind with the promoter,\nand express the genes, which synthesize lactase. Eventually, the lactase will\ndigest all of the lactose, until there is none to bind to the repressor. The\nrepressor will then bind to the operator, stopping the manufacture of lactase.]]\n\n\n\nIn molecular genetics, a 'repressor' is a DNA-binding protein that regulates the\nexpression of one or more genes by binding to the operator and blocking the\nattachment of RNA polymerase to the promoter, thus preventing transcription of\nthe genes. This blocking of expression is called 'repression'.\n\nRepressor proteins are coded for by regulator genes. Repressor proteins then\nattach to a DNA segment known as the operator. By binding to the operator, the\nrepressor protein prevents the RNA polymerase from creating messenger RNA.\n","linknr":235,"url":"Repressor","recorded":1362373938,"links":20,"instances":["biochemistry","biology","genetics","biology","biochemistry","biology","genetics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Gene expression"],"headings":["Function","Examples","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/22/Lac_Operon.svg/300px-Lac_Operon.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["operator","biology"],["transcription","genetics"],["inducer","biology"],["promoter","genetics"],["antiparallel","biochemistry"],["operator","biology"],["cofactor","biochemistry"],["promoter","biology"],["activator","genetics"]],"members":["cofactor","operator","activator","inducer","antiparallel","promoter","transcription"],"related":["Molecular_genetics","DNA-binding_protein","Gene_expression","Operator_(biology)","Transcription_(genetics)","Regulator_gene","DNA","RNA_polymerase","Messenger_RNA","Inducer_(biology)","Corepressor","Trp_repressor","Promoter_(genetics)","RNA_polymerase","Inducer","Allolactose","Methionine","MetJ","DNA","Homodimer","Monomers","Beta_ribbon","Alpha_helix","Antiparallel_(biochemistry)","Beta-sheet","Operator_(biology)","Protein_dimer","Palindrome","Dyad_symmetry","Pyrimidine-purine","DNA_supercoil","Phosphodiester","Cofactor_(biochemistry)","S-Adenosyl_methionine","Promoter_(biology)","Activator_(genetics)","Operon","Regulation_of_gene_expression","Transcription_factor","Lac_repressor","P300/CBP","Glossary_of_gene_expression_terms"]}
