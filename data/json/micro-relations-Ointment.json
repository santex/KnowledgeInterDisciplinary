{"cursor":"14545","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nA 'topical medication' is a medication that is applied to body surfaces such as\nthe skin or mucous membranes to treat ailments via a large range of classes\nincluding but not limited to creams, foams, gels, lotions and ointments.\n\nTopical medications differ from many other types of drugs because mishandling\nthem can lead to certain complications in a patient or administrator of the\ndrug.\n\nMany topical medications are epicutaneous, meaning that they are applied\ndirectly to the skin. Topical medications may also be inhalational, such as\nasthma medications, or applied to the surface of tissues other than the skin,\nsuch as eye drops applied to the conjunctiva, or ear drops placed in the ear, or\nmedications applied to the surface of a tooth. As a route of administration,\ntopical medications are contrasted with enteral (in the digestive tract) and\nparenteral administration (injected into the circulatory system).\n\nA topical effect, in the pharmacodynamic sense, may refer to a local, rather\nthan systemic, target for a medication. However, many topically administered\ndrugs have systemic effects.\n\nSome hydrophobic chemicals, such as steroid hormones, can be absorbed into the\nbody after being applied to the skin in the form of a cream, gel or lotion.\nTransdermal patches have become a popular means of administering some drugs for\nbirth control, hormone replacement therapy, and prevention of motion sickness.\nOne example of an antibiotic that may be applied topically is chloramphenicol.\n\nThe word is derived from the Ancient Greek topos (plural: topoi), meaning\n\"place\" or \"location\".\n","linknr":412,"url":"Ointment","recorded":1362500990,"links":29,"instances":["substance","pharmaceutical","rheology","skin"],"pdf":["http://www.rpsgb.org.uk/pdfs/mussheet06.pdf"],"categories":["Medical terminology","Routes of administration","Ointments","Drug delivery devices","Dosage forms"],"headings":["Choice of base formulation","Classes of topical medications","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f4/CruzRojaPomada.JPG/220px-CruzRojaPomada.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/FlattenedRoundPills.jpg/58px-FlattenedRoundPills.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/Hexaaquatitanium%28III%29-solution.jpg/58px-Hexaaquatitanium%28III%29-solution.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/Inhaler.jpg/58px-Inhaler.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/Glycerin_suppositories.jpg/58px-Glycerin_suppositories.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/SPF15SunBlock.JPG/58px-SPF15SunBlock.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/Injection_Syringe_01.jpg/58px-Injection_Syringe_01.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/84/Nuvola_apps_filetypes_red.svg/52px-Nuvola_apps_filetypes_red.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["absorption","skin"],["cream","pharmaceutical"],["cream","pharmaceutical"],["powder","substance"],["paste","rheology"]],"members":["powder","cream","paste","absorption"],"related":["Medication","Body_surface_area","Human_skin","Mucous_membrane","Creams","Foams","Gels","Lotions","Ointments","Asthma_medication","Eye_drops","Conjunctiva","Ear_drop","Tooth","Route_of_administration","Enteral_administration","Parenteral_administration","Pharmacodynamic","Systemic_effect","Hydrophobe","Steroid_hormone","Absorption_(skin)","Cream_(pharmaceutical)","Gel","Lotion","Transdermal_patch","Birth_control","Hormone_therapy","Motion_sickness","Antibiotic","Chloramphenicol","Topical_steroid","Miconazole","Clinical_outcome","Kenalog","Dermatology","Lotion","Emollient","Cream_(pharmaceutical)","Stratum_corneum","Immunological_sensitization","Preservative","Emollients","Human_skin","Mucous_membrane","Human_eye","Vagina","Anus","Human_nose","Paraffin_wax","Petroleum_jelly","Microcrystalline_wax","Ceresine","Wool_fat","Beeswax","Macrogol","Emulsifying_wax","Cetrimide","Olive_oil","Coconut_oil","Sesame_oil","Almond_oil","Peanut_oil","Gel","Emulsion","Foam","Transdermal_patch","Powder_(substance)","Sponge","Occlusive_dressing","Topical_decongestant","Paste_(rheology)","Tincture","Liniment","Unguent","Finger_tip_unit","Lidocaine","Topical_anesthetic","Topical_antibiotic","Topical_corticosteroids","Topical_decongestant","Topical_steroid","Goodman_&_Gilman's_The_Pharmacological_Basis_of_Therapeutics"]}
