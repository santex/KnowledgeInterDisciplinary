The first\nsuccessful spacecraft in the NASA Mariner program, it was a simplified version\nof the Block I spacecraft of the Ranger program and an exact copy of Mariner 1.\nThe missions of Mariner 1 and 2 spacecraft are together sometimes known as the\nMariner R missions. Mariner 2 passed within of Venus on December 14, 1962.\n\nThe Mariner probe consisted of a 100 cm (39.4 in) diameter hexagonal\nbus, to which solar panels, instrument booms, and antennas were attached. The\nscientific instruments on board the Mariner spacecraft were two radiometers (one\neach for the microwave and infrared portions of the spectrum), a micrometeorite\nsensor, a solar plasma sensor, a charged particle sensor, and a magnetometer.\nThese instruments were designed to measure the temperature distribution on the\nsurface of Venus, as well as making basic measurements of Venus' atmosphere. Due\nto the planet's thick, featureless cloud cover, no cameras were included in the\nMariner unit. Mariner 10 later discovered that extensive cloud detail was\nvisible in ultraviolet light.\n\nThe primary mission was to receive communications from the spacecraft in the\nvicinity of Venus and to perform a radiometric temperature measurements of the\nplanet. A second objective was to measure the Interplanetary Magnetic Field and\ncharged particle environment. {{cite journal\n | author = Jet Propulsion Laboratory (under contract for NASA) title = Tracking\n | Information Memorandum No. 332-15: Mariner R 1 and 2 publisher = California\n | Institute of Technology date = 1962-06-15 url = http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive-\n | /nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19650072055_1965072055.pdf format = PDF accessdate =\n | 2008-01-24\n}} {{cite journal\n | last = Renzetti first = N.A. title = Technical Memorandum No. 33-212:\n | Tracking and Data Acquisition Support for the Mariner Venus 1962 Mission\n | publisher = NASA date = 1965-07-01 url = http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa-\n | /casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19650023548_1965023548.pdf format = PDF accessdate =\n | 2008-01-24\n}}\n\nThe two-stage Atlas-Agena rocket carrying Mariner 1 had veered off-course\nduring its launch on July 22, 1962 due to a defective signal from the Atlas and\na bug in the program equations of the ground-based guiding computer, and\nsubsequently the spacecraft was destroyed by the Range Safety Officer. A month\nlater, the identical Mariner 2 spacecraft was launched successfully on August\n27, 1962, sending it on a 3Â½-month flight to Venus. On the way, it measured the\nsolar wind, a constant stream of charged particles flowing outwards from the\nSun, confirming the measurements by Luna 1 in 1959. It also measured\ninterplanetary dust, which turned out to be scarcer than predicted. In\naddition, Mariner 2 detected high-energy charged particles coming from the Sun,\nincluding several brief solar flares, as well as cosmic rays from outside the\nSolar System. As it flew by Venus on December 14, 1962, Mariner 2 scanned the\nplanet with its pair of radiometers, revealing that Venus has cool clouds and\nan extremely hot surface.\n\nThe spacecraft is now defunct in a heliocentric orbit.\n","linknr":764,"url":"Mariner_2","recorded":1362267937,"links":68,"instances":["unit","physics","satellite","radio"],"pdf":["http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19650072055_1965072055.pdf","http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19650072055_1965072055.pdf","http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19650023548_1965023548.pdf","http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19650023548_1965023548.pdf","http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19660005413_1966005413.pdf","http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19660005413_1966005413.pdf","http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19660006862_1966006862.pdf","http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19660006862_1966006862.pdf","http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19640006050_1964006050.pdf","http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19640006050_1964006050.pdf","http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19650012602_1965012602.pdf","http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19650012602_1965012602.pdf","http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19650006314_1965006314.pdf","http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19650006314_1965006314.pdf","http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19640016686_1964016686.pdf","http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19640016686_1964016686.pdf","http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19650076538_1965076538.pdf","http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19650076538_1965076538.pdf"],"categories":["Derelict satellites in heliocentric orbit","Mariner program","Missions to Venus","1962 in spaceflight","Inactive extraterrestrial probes","Smithsonian Institution Archives related"],"headings":["Spacecraft and subsystems","Mission profile","Results","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/02/Mariner_2_in_space.jpg/270px-Mariner_2_in_space.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/04/Mariner_2_launch.jpg/200px-Mariner_2_launch.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e5/Venus-real_color.jpg/190px-Venus-real_color.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["antenna","radio"],["plasma","physics"],["gauss","unit"],["injun","satellite"]],"members":["gauss","plasma","injun","antenna"],"related":["NASA","Jet_Propulsion_Laboratory","Venus","Coordinated_Universal_Time","Atlas-Agena","Kilogram","Venus","Space_probe","Spacecraft","NASA","Mariner_program","Ranger_program","Mariner_1","Photovoltaic_module","Antenna_(radio)","Radiometer","Microwave","Infrared","Electromagnetic_spectrum","Micrometeorite","Plasma_(physics)","Charged_particle","Magnetometer","Atmosphere","Camera","Mariner_10","Ultraviolet","Radiometry","Interplanetary_Magnetic_Field","Atlas-Agena","Range_Safety_Officer","Solar_wind","Sun","Luna_1","Interplanetary_dust","Solar_flare","Cosmic_ray","Solar_System","Heliocentric_orbit","Jet_Propulsion_Laboratory","California_Institute_of_Technology","Magnesium","Battery_charger","Silver-oxide_battery","Monopropellant","Anhydrous","Hydrazine","Nitrogen_tetroxide","Aluminum_oxide","Pelletizing","Carbon_dioxide","Gauss_(unit)","Cosmic_ray","University_of_Iowa","X-ray","Ultraviolet","Injun_(satellite)","Explorer_12","Explorer_14","Solar_wind","Omnidirectional_antenna","Alternating_current","Cape_Canaveral_Air_Force_Station","Atlas-Agena","Limb_darkening","Pioneer_5","Magnetosphere","Pioneer_Venus_project"]}
