An\nobject, even an immaterial object, is considered to be viral when it has the\nability to spread copies of itself or change other similar objects to become\nmore like itself when those objects are simply exposed to the viral object. This\nhas become a common way to describe how thoughts, information and trends move\ninto and through a human population. Memes are possibly the best example of\nviral patterns. The 1992 novel [[Snow Crash]] explores the implications of an\nancient memetic meta-virus and its modern day computer virus equivalent:\n\n\n\nThe spread of viral phenomena are also regarded as part of the cultural politics\nof network culture or the virality of the age of networks {{Cite web\n  | last = Sampson first = Tony D authorlink = Tony D Sampson title = Virality:\n  | Contagion Theory in the Age of Contagion (University of Minnesota Press,\n  | 2012) date = 2012-08-01 url = http://viralcontagion.wordpress.com/2012/04/20/the-blurb-for-\n  | virality/ accessdate = 2012-06-07}}\nVarious authors have pointed to the intensification in connectivity brought\nabout by network technologies as a possible trigger for increased chances of\ninfection from wide-ranging social, cultural, political, and economic\ncontagions. For example, the social scientist Jan van Dijk warns of new\nvulnerabilities that arise when network society encounters âtoo much\nconnectivity.â The proliferation of global transport networks makes this model\nof society susceptible to the spreading of biological diseases. Digital networks\nbecome volatile under the destructive potential of computer viruses and worms.\nEnhanced by the rapidity and extensity of technological networks, the spread of\nsocial conformity, political rumor, fads, fashions, gossip, and hype threatens\nto destabilize established political order. Likewise, financial contagion\ncascades through the capitalist economy, inspiring speculative bubbles, crashes,\nand aperiodic recessions.\n\nThere is, it would appear, a certain measure of consensus across the political\nspectrum regarding how the networked infrastructures of late capitalism have\nbecome prone to viral phenomenon. On the Left, in their book Empire, Michael\nHardt and Antonio Negri have argued that the age of globalization is synonymous\nwith the age of contagion. This is an age in which increased contact with the\n\"Other\" has rekindled anxieties concerning the spreading of disease and\ncorruption since permeable boundaries of the nation-state can no longer function\nas a colonial hygiene shield. The spontaneity of contagious overspills thus has\nthe potential to initiate a revolutionary renewal of global democracy. On the\nRight, the International Monetary Fund, and various leaders of the capitalist\nworld order have pointed to the threat posed to the stability of the current\nneoliberal politicalâeconomic system by the capricious spreading of financial\ncrises from nation to nation. Correlations have been made, for example, between\nthe interlocking of global stock markets, the chaos of financial contagion, and\nthe so-called Islamic threat to justify the ongoing War on Terror (Tony Blair's\nspeech on the eve of the invasion of Iraq, for example).\n\nNonetheless, virality is not merely perceived as a threat to capitalism. It also\npresents certain opportunities for the refreshing of its consumerist models of\nwealth creation founded on a clearer understanding of how money can follow\nsocial influence as it spreads across a network. Indeed, the link between an ever-\nexpanding form of network capitalism and the self-propagation of network\nvirality is explicitly made through a heady concoction of business enterprise,\nnetwork science, and neo-Darwinian related literature. Like this, the meme and\nthe viral (the marketing buzzwords of the network age) have been conjured up\nfrom an assortment of crude renderings of evolutionary theory, powerful computer-\nassisted contagion modeling, and business trends. It is via these various\ncontagion models that financial crisis, social influence, innovations, fashions\nand fads, and even human emotion are understood to spread universally like\nviruses across networks. Yet arguably, as intuitive as this new epidemiological\nparadigm seems to be, the medical metaphors and biological analogies that\nunderpin it present many analytical limitations. To be sure, understood as a\nmetaphor, the too much connectivity thesis offers very little in terms of an\nontological grasping of contagion theory. Similarly, the overgeneralization that\nnetwork capitalism, or indeed resistance to it, spreads like a disease\ninadequately describes the politics of the network age.\n\n\nExamples of viral phenomena in addition to memes are:\n* Virality relating to network culture {{Cite web\n  | last = Sampson first = Tony D authorlink = Tony D Sampson title = Virality:\n  | Contagion Theory in the Age of
