The Middle English\nperiod ended at about 1470, when the Chancery Standard, a form of London-based\nEnglish, began to become widespread, a process aided by the introduction of the\nprinting press to England by William Caxton in the late 1470s. By that time the\nvariant of the Northumbrian dialect (prevalent in Northern England) spoken in\nsoutheast Scotland was developing into the Scots language. The language of\nEngland as used after 1470 and up to 1650 is known as Early Modern English.\n\nUnlike Old English, which tended largely to adopt Late West Saxon scribal\nconventions in the period immediately before the Norman conquest of England,\nwritten Middle English displays a wide variety of scribal (and presumably\ndialectal) forms. This diversity suggests the gradual end of the role of Wessex\nas a focal point and trend-setter for writers and scribes, the emergence of more\ndistinct local scribal styles and written dialects, and a general pattern of\ntransition of activity over the centuries that followed, as Northumbria, East\nAnglia, and London successively emerged as major centres of English literature,\neach with their own particular interests.\n\nMiddle English literature of the 12th and 13th centuries is comparatively rare,\nas written communication was usually in Anglo-Norman or in Medieval Latin.\nMiddle English became much more important as a literary language during the 14th\ncentury, with poets such as Chaucer and Langland.\n","linknr":470,"url":"Middle_English","recorded":1362484550,"links":51,"instances":["disambiguation","letter","food","old_english","astrology","grammatical_number"],"pdf":[],"categories":["English languages","History of the English language","Middle English language|"],"headings":["History","Grammar","Orthography","Sample texts","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/Incubator-logo.svg/32px-Incubator-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["west_saxon_dialect","old_english"],["lamb","food"],["dual","grammatical_number"],["mackenzie","disambiguation"],["thorn","letter"],["aries","astrology"]],"members":["mackenzie","thorn","lamb","west_saxon_dialect","aries","dual"],"related":["England","Wales","Scotland","Ireland","Early_Modern_English","Scots_language","Yola_language","Wexford","Germanic_languages","West_Germanic","Anglo-Frisian_languages","Old_English","History_of_the_English_language","High_Middle_Ages","Late_Middle_Ages","Old_English","Norman_England","Plantagenet_era","London","Printing_press","England","William_Caxton","Northumbria","Dialect","Northern_England","Scotland","History_of_the_Scots_language","Early_Modern_English","Old_English","West_Saxon_dialect_(Old_English)","Norman_conquest_of_England","Wessex","Northumbria","Kingdom_of_the_East_Angles","English_literature","Middle_English_literature","Anglo-Norman_language","Medieval_Latin","Chaucer","William_Langland","Katherine_Group","AB_language","Tudor_period","Norman_conquest_of_England","Anglo-Norman_language","Pig","Pork","Chicken","Poultry","Calf","Veal","Cow","Beef","Wood","Forest","Sheep","Lamb_(food)","House","Mansion","Honourable","Boldness","Liberty","Chivalric","Feudalism","Crusading","Normans","Saxon_genitive","Dual_(grammatical_number)","Anglicised","Law_French","English_monarchy","Changes_to_Old_English_vocabulary","Vernacular","Brittonicisms_in_English","Romano-British","Brythonic_languages","British_Romance","Richard_II_of_England","House_of_Plantagenet","House_of_Lancaster","House_of_York","Wars_of_the_Roses","Tudor_dynasty","Henry_VII_of_England","English_Bible","Book_of_Common_Prayer","French_language","Latin","Law_French","Richard_Pynson","West_Frisian_language","Proto-Germanic","Germanic_strong_verb","Ablaut","Silent_letter","Old_English_Latin_alphabet","Æ","Eth","Yogh","Mackenzie_(disambiguation)","Middle_Scots","Thorn_(letter)","Wynn","Vulgar_Latin","W","Nativity_of_Jesus","Wycliffe's_Bible","Gospel_of_Luke","New_Testament","Prologue","Geoffrey_Chaucer","Coghill","Zephyrus","Aries_(astrology)","Geoffrey_Chaucer","John_Gower","Middle_English_creole_hypothesis","Middle_English_Dictionary","Middle_English_literature"]}
