He had a\nrelatively successful 16-year career, which lasted from 1897 to 1912, as he won\n245 games although he also lost 254 games, so despite his sparking 2.97 career\nERA, he holds the record for most wins by a pitcher with a career losing record.\n\nPowell was born in Bloomington, Illinois. He made his debut with the Cleveland\nSpiders in 1897, and by 1898 he became one of the best pitchers on the team. His\n23 wins trailed only teammate Cy Young. He was one of the star players sold to\nthe St. Louis Browns before the 1899 season. He won 23 games again that year,\nwhich was three more than the Spiders had all year. After three successful\nseasons, he was lured to the new American League in 1902, where he pitched for\nthe St. Louis Browns.\n\nPowell was traded to the New York Highlanders before the 1904 season, where he\nwent 23â19. However, after an 8â13 start in 1905, he was traded back to the\nBrowns. By this time the Browns had become one of the worst teams in the league.\nHe had a 2.50 ERA over the last seven years of his career, but posted a 78â106\nrecord. This was due partially to low run support, and partially to poor\ndefense. Of the 619 runs he allowed in these seven years, 189 of them were\nunearned. {{\n\n cite news |url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/p/powelja01.shtml\n |publisher=Sports References Inc. |title=Baseball-References: Jack Powell\n |date=August 23, 2006\n\n}}\n\nPowell retired after the 1912 season.
