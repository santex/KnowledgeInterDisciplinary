{"cursor":"3325","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Sir Peter de Montfort' (c. 1215 â€“ 4 August 1265) was an English\nparliamentarian.\n\nIn 1257 he was High Sheriff of Staffordshire and Shropshire.\n\nHe is said to have presided over a meeting of the Parliament of England at a\nParliament held in Oxford in 1258. This was dubbed by the supporters of Henry\nIII as the \"Mad Parliament\". He is the earliest person recorded as the presiding\nofficer of the Commons, an office later known as the Speaker of the House of\nCommons but referred to then as the 'parlour' or 'prolocutor'. He was the son of\nThurstan de Montfort. He was closely associated with Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl\nof Leicester and died with him at the Battle of Evesham on 4 August 1265.\n\nPeter de Montfort married Alice de Audley. Their grandson John was created 1st\nLord Montfort; their granddaughter Lady Elizabeth Montacute was married to\nWilliam de Montacute, 2nd Baron Montacute (later spelt Montagu), and thus the\nmother of William Montagu, 1st Earl of Salisbury, King of Mann, leader of the\ncoup against Roger Mortimer and the most trusted advisor of Edward III. (Lady\nElizabeth was also a leading benefactor of Christ Church at Oxford University.)\nThe family home was Beaudesert Castle, built by Thurstan de Montfort on land\ngranted by Henry de Newburgh, Earl of Warwick. A charter for a market alongside\nthe castle was obtained from the Empress Maud in 1140. It was probably his\ngrandson Peter who walled the inner bailey in stone, which was completed in\nJanuary 1216.\n","linknr":111,"url":"Peter_de_Montfort","recorded":1375085671,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Peter_de_Montfort&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Peter_de_Montfort&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/High_Sheriff_of_Staffordshire","#cite_note-1","/wiki/High_Sheriff_of_Shropshire","/wiki/Parliament_of_England","/wiki/Oxford","/wiki/Henry_III_of_England","/wiki/Mad_Parliament","/wiki/List_of_Speakers_of_the_House_of_Commons_of_England","/wiki/Simon_de_Montfort,_6th_Earl_of_Leicester","/wiki/Battle_of_Evesham","/wiki/Baron_Montfort","/wiki/Lady_Elizabeth_Montacute","/wiki/William_de_Montacute,_2nd_Baron_Montacute","/wiki/William_Montagu,_1st_Earl_of_Salisbury","/wiki/King_of_Mann","/wiki/Roger_Mortimer,_1st_Earl_of_March","/wiki/Edward_III","/wiki/Christ_Church,_Oxford","/wiki/Oxford_University","/wiki/Beaudesert_Castle","/w/index.php?title=Peter_de_Montfort&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/List_of_Speakers_of_the_House_of_Commons_of_England","/w/index.php?title=Peter_de_Montfort&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-1","http://www.archive.org/stream/collectionsfo1912stafuoft#page/274/mode/2up","/wiki/David_Carpenter_(historian)","/wiki/Digital_object_identifier","http://dx.doi.org/10.1093%2Fref%3Aodnb%2F37845","/wiki/Help:CS1_errors#accessdate_missing_url","/w/index.php?title=Peter_de_Montfort&action=edit&section=3","http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/978265.stm","http://www.courts.fsnet.co.uk/beaudesert.htm","/wiki/List_of_Speakers_of_the_House_of_Commons_of_England","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Peter_de_Montfort&oldid=543994025","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1215_births","/wiki/Category:1265_deaths","/wiki/Category:High_Sheriffs_of_Staffordshire","/wiki/Category:High_Sheriffs_of_Shropshire","/wiki/Category:Speakers_of_the_House_of_Commons_of_England","/wiki/Category:Members_of_the_Parliament_of_England_(pre-1707)","/wiki/Category:13th-century_English_people","/wiki/Category:Pages_using_citations_with_accessdate_and_no_URL","/wiki/Category:Place_of_birth_missing","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Peter+de+Montfort&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Peter+de+Montfort","/wiki/Peter_de_Montfort","/wiki/Talk:Peter_de_Montfort","#","/wiki/Peter_de_Montfort","/w/index.php?title=Peter_de_Montfort&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Peter_de_Montfort&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Peter_de_Montfort","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Peter_de_Montfort","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Peter_de_Montfort&oldid=543994025","/w/index.php?title=Peter_de_Montfort&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1713435","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Peter_de_Montfort&id=543994025","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Peter+de+Montfort","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Peter+de+Montfort&oldid=543994025&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Peter_de_Montfort&printable=yes","//de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_de_Montfort","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1713435#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pet
