The International Association for the Study of Pain's widely used\ndefinition states: \"Pain is an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience\nassociated with actual or potential tissue damage, or described in terms of such\ndamage\".\n\nPain motivates the individual to withdraw from damaging situations, to protect a\ndamaged body part while it heals, and to avoid similar experiences in the\nfuture. Most pain resolves promptly once the painful\nstimulus is removed and the body has healed, but sometimes pain persists despite\nremoval of the stimulus and apparent healing of the body; and sometimes pain\narises in the absence of any detectable stimulus, damage or disease.\n\nPain is the most common reason for physician consultation in the United\nStates. It is a major symptom in many\nmedical conditions, and can significantly interfere with a person's quality of\nlife and general functioning. Psychological factors\nsuch as social support, hypnotic suggestion, excitement, or distraction can\nsignificantly modulate pain's intensity or unpleasantness.\n","linknr":1436,"url":"Pain","recorded":1362568699,"links":108,"instances":["philosophy","journal","philosophy_of_mind","mood","symptom","philosophy_of_mind","medicine"],"pdf":["http://webscript.princeton.edu/~psych/psychology/related/socneuconf/pdf/eisenberger-lieberman2.pdf","http://www.hnehealth.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0012/70122/pain_mechanisms_20100315013844.pdf","http://www.jsmf.org/meetings/2007/oct-nov/CONB%20Craig%202003.pdf","http://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/sds/docs/loewenstein/painSufferingAwards.pdf","http://www.law.northwestern.edu/lawreview/v100/n1/87/LR100n1Avraham.pdf","http://www.ejcl.org/133/art133-2.pdf","http://www.moffitt.org/CCJRoot/v8n1/pdf/15.pdf","http://www.painandthelaw.org/aslme_content/29-1/bonham.pdf","http://webscript.princeton.edu/%7Epsych/psychology/related/socneuconf/pdf/eisenberger-lieberman2.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20080625033250/http%3A//www.nuffieldbioethics.org/fileLibrary/pdf/RIA_Report_FINAL-opt.pdf","http://neuro.med.harvard.edu/site/wilsonweb/2003.pdf","http://www.advocatesforanimals.org.uk/pdf/crustreport.pdf"],"categories":["Pain|","Nociception","Sensory
