{"cursor":"9567","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n'Glycoproteins' are proteins that contain oligosaccharide chains (glycans)\ncovalently attached to polypeptide side-chains. The carbohydrate is attached to\nthe protein in a cotranslational or posttranslational modification. This process\nis known as glycosylation. Secreted extracellular proteins are often\nglycosylated. In proteins that have segments extending extracellularly, the\nextracellular segments are also glycosylated. Glycoproteins are often important\nintegral membrane proteins, where they play a role in cellâcell interactions.\nGlycoproteins are also formed in the cytosol, but their functions and the\npathways producing these modifications in this compartment are less well\nunderstood.\n","linknr":595,"url":"Glycoproteins","recorded":1362574350,"links":52,"instances":["biochemistry","genetics"],"pdf":["https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/img/assets/15880/glycan_classification.pdf"],"categories":["Glycoproteins|","Carbohydrate chemistry"],"headings":["N-glycosylation and O-glycosylation","Monosaccharides","Examples","Hormones","Functions","Analysis","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Glicoprotein.svg/220px-Glicoprotein.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cf/Glykoproteine_Zucker.svg/220px-Glykoproteine_Zucker.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["translation","genetics"],["receptor","biochemistry"]],"members":["receptor","translation"],"related":["Protein","Oligosaccharide","Glycans","Peptide","Translation_(genetics)","Posttranslational_modification","Glycosylation","Secretory_protein","Integral_membrane_proteins","Cytosol","Asparagine","Hydroxyl","Oxygen","Hydroxylysine","Hydroxyproline","Serine","Threonine","Glucose","Hexose","Galactose","Mannose","Fucose","Deoxy_sugar","N-Acetylgalactosamine","Aminosugar","N-Acetylglucosamine","N-Acetylneuraminic_acid","Neuraminic_acid","Sialic_acid","Xylose","Pentose","Protein_folding","Mucin","Proteolysis","White_blood_cell","Mammal","Immune_system","Antibody","Antigen","T_cell","Glycoprotein_IIb/IIIa","Platelet","Endothelium","Zona_pellucida","Oocyte","Sperm","Connective_tissue","Connective_tissue","Calcium","Bone","Gp41","Gp120","Viscosity","Egg_white","Blood_plasma","Miraculin","Hormone","Follicle-stimulating_hormone","Luteinizing_hormone","Thyroid-stimulating_hormone","Human_chorionic_gonadotropin","Alpha-fetoprotein","Erythropoietin","Collagen","Mucin","Transferrin","Ceruloplasmin","Antibody","Histocompatibility","Human_chorionic_gonadotropin","Phosphatase","Sperm","Oocyte","Antifreeze_protein","Lectin","Selectin","Receptor_(biochemistry)","Calnexin","Calreticulin","Notch_signaling","Hemostasis","Thrombosis","Platelet","Periodic_acid-Schiff_stain","Electrophoresis","Radioactive_decay","Endoglycosidase","Exoglycosidase","Phospholipase","Mannose","Agarose","Lectin","Column_chromatography","Lectin_affinity_chromatography","Lectin","Affinity_electrophoresis","Glycoform","Hydrolysis","Mass_spectrometry","Molecular_mass","NMR_spectroscopy","Multi-angle_light_scattering","Molecular_mass","Dual_Polarisation_Interferometry","Conformational_change","Methylation","Amino_acid","Complementary_DNA","P-glycoprotein","Glycopeptide","Proteoglycan","Glycocalyx","ER_Oxidoreductin","Gp120","Gp41","Miraculin","Female_sperm_storage"]}
