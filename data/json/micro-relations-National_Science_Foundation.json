Its medical counterpart is the National Institutes of Health.\nWith an annual budget of about US$6.87 billion (fiscal year 2010), the NSF\nfunds approximately 20% of all federally supported basic research conducted by\nthe United States' colleges and universities. In some\nfields, such as mathematics, computer science, economics and the social\nsciences, the NSF is the major source of federal backing.\n\nThe NSF's director, deputy director, and the 24 members of the National Science\nBoard (NSB) are appointed by the President of the United\nStates, and confirmed by the United States Senate. The director and deputy\ndirector are responsible for administration, planning, budgeting and day-to-day\noperations of the foundation, while the NSB meets six times a year to establish\nits overall policies.\n","recorded":1362124569,"portal":[],"list":[],"links":"256","instances":["web_browser","canada"],"pdf":["http://www.nsf.gov/nsb/publications/2011/meritreviewcriteria.pdf","http://humanitiespolicy.unt.edu/topics/our_work/science-1.pdf","http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2009/oig0901/oig0901.pdf","http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2009/oig0901/oig0901.pdf"],"categories":["Independent
