{"cursor":"18904","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Evolvability' is defined as the capacity of a system for adaptive evolution.\nEvolvability is the ability of a population of organisms to not merely generate\ngenetic diversity, but to generate [[adaptation|adaptive]] genetic diversity,\nand thereby evolve through natural selection.\n\nIn order for a biological organism to evolve by natural selection, there must\nbe a certain minimum probability that new, heritable variants are beneficial.\nRandom mutations, unless they occur in DNA sequences with no function, are\nexpected to be mostly detrimental. Beneficial mutations are always rare, but\nif they are too rare, then adaptation cannot occur. Early failed efforts to\nevolve computer programs by random mutation and selection showed\nthat evolvability is not a given, but depends on the representation of the\nprogram. Analogously, the evolvability of organisms depends on\ntheir genotype-phenotype map. This means that biological genomes\nare structured in ways that make beneficial changes less unlikely than they\nwould otherwise be. This has been taken as evidence that evolution has created\nnot just fitter organisms, but populations of organisms that are better able\nto evolve.\n","linknr":344,"url":"Evolvability","recorded":1362483435,"links":14,"instances":["biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Evolutionary biology"],"headings":["Alternative definitions","Generating more variation","Enhancement of Selection","Robustness and evolvability","Exploration ahead of time","Modularity","Evolution of evolvability","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["degeneracy","biology"]],"members":["degeneracy"],"related":["Evolution","Genetic_diversity","Natural_selection","Adaptation","Enzyme","Alleles","Quantitative_genetics","Population_genetics","Evolution_of_sexual_reproduction","Sexual_selection","Natural_selection","Hill-Robertson_effect","Mutational_robustness","Protein_folding","Degeneracy_(biology)","Mutational_robustness","Penetrance","Preadaptation","Genetic_assimilation","Baldwin_effect","Fitness_landscape","Fitness_landscape","Genetic_assimilation","Pleiotropy","Modularity","Mutation_rate","Genetic_load","Genetic_hitchhiking","Experimental_evolution","Evolution_of_sexual_reproduction","Fungal_prions","Evolutionary_capacitance"]}
