Campbell. Unknown was a companion to Street & Smith's science fiction\npulp, [[Analog Science Fiction and Fact|Astounding Science Fiction]], which was\nalso edited by Campbell at the time; many authors and illustrators contributed\nto both magazines. The leading fantasy magazine in the 1930s was [[Weird\nTales]], which focused on shock and horror. Campbell wanted to publish a fantasy\nmagazine with more finesse and humor than Weird Tales, and put his plans into\naction when Eric Frank Russell sent him the manuscript of his novel Sinister\nBarrier, about aliens who own the human race. Unknowns first issue appeared in\nMarch 1939; in addition to Sinister Barrier, it included H. L. Gold's \"Trouble\nWith Water\", a humorous fantasy about a New Yorker who meets a water gnome.\nGold's story was the first of many in Unknown to combine commonplace reality\nwith the fantastic.\n\nCampbell required his authors to avoid simplistic horror fiction and insisted\nthat the fantasy elements in a story be developed logically: for example, Jack\nWilliamson's \"Darker Than You Think\" describes a world in which there is a\nscientific explanation for the existence of werewolves. Similarly, L. Sprague de\nCamp and Fletcher Pratt's Harold Shea series, about a modern American who finds\nhimself in the worlds of various mythologies, depicts a system of magic based on\nmathematical logic. Other notable stories included several well-received novels\nby L. Ron Hubbard and short stories such as Manly Wade Wellman's \"When It Was\nMoonlight\" and Fritz Leiber's \"Two Sought Adventure\", the first in his Fafhrd\nand the Gray Mouser series.\n\nUnknown was forced to a bimonthly schedule in 1941 by poor sales, and cancelled\nin 1943 when wartime paper shortages became so acute that Campbell had to choose\nbetween turning Astounding into a bimonthly or ending Unknown. The magazine is\ngenerally regarded as the finest fantasy fiction magazine ever published,\ndespite the fact that it was not commercially successful, and in the opinion of\nscience fiction historian Mike Ashley it was responsible for the creation of the\nmodern fantasy publishing genre.\n","linknr":464,"url":"Unknown_(magazine)","recorded":1362482551,"links":23,"instances":["us","heinlein","short_story","writer","writer"],"pdf":[],"categories":["American magazines","Defunct magazines of the United States","Fantasy fiction magazines","Pulp magazines","Publications established in 1939","Publications disestablished in 1943","Unknown (magazine)|*","Science fiction magazines established in the 1930s","Street & Smith"],"headings":["Background and publication history","Contents and reception","Influence","Bibliographic details","Notes","Footnotes","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/9f/Magazine_cover_-_Unknown_no._1_%281939-03%29.jpg/220px-Magazine_cover_-_Unknown_no._1_%281939-03%29.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b3/Unknown_December_1939_cover.jpg/220px-Unknown_December_1939_cover.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4b/Unknown_February_1942_cover.jpg/220px-Unknown_February_1942_cover.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5d/Cartier_Fear_illo_Unknown_July_1940.jpg/220px-Cartier_Fear_illo_Unknown_July_1940.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e7/Cscr-featured.svg/15px-Cscr-featured.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["mike_ashley","writer"],["they","heinlein"],["author!_author!","short_story"],["prohibition-era","us"],["george_hay","writer"]],"members":["they","george_hay","mike_ashley"],"related":["Pulp_magazine","Fantasy_fiction_magazine","Street_&_Smith","John_W._Campbell","Eric_Frank_Russell","H._L._Gold","Werewolf","L._Sprague_de_Camp","Fletcher_Pratt","Harold_Shea","L._Ron_Hubbard","Manly_Wade_Wellman","Fritz_Leiber","Fafhrd_and_the_Gray_Mouser","Mike_Ashley_(writer)","Hugo_Gernsback","Street_&_Smith","F._Orlin_Tremaine","John_W._Campbell","Eric_Frank_Russell","Horace_L._Gold","Manly_Wade_Wellman","L._Ron_Hubbard","Theodore_Sturgeon","L._Sprague_de_Camp","Fletcher_Pratt","Harold_Shea","John_Clute","Robert_A._Heinlein","Magic,_Inc.","The_Unpleasant_Profession_of_Jonathan_Hoag","They_(Heinlein)","A.E._van_Vogt","Isaac_Asimov","Author!_Author!_(short_story)","Edgar_Allan_Poe","Fritz_Leiber","Fafhrd_and_the_Gray_Mouser","Sword_and_sorcery","James_H._Schmitz","Malcolm_Edwards","Lest_Darkness_Fall","Alternate_history","Harold_Winfield_Scott","Modest_Stein","Graves_Gladney","Edd_Cartier","Thorne_Smith","Prohibition-era_(US)","James_Branch_Cabell","Clifford_Simak","Lester_del_Rey","David_G._Hartwell","Shirley_Jackson","Bedsheet","Digest_size","Shilling","Babette_Rosmond","Donald_R._Bensen","Jove_Books","George_Hay_(writer)"]}
