{"cursor":"10477","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n'Prince Pyotr Dmitrievich Sviatopolk-Mirskii' () (, Vladikavkaz â , Saint\nPetersburg) was a Russian politician and police official, Minister of the\nInterior in 1904â1905. He was the son of the general Dmitry Ivanovitch Sviatopolk-\nMirskii and father of the literary historian D. S. Mirsky.\n\nPyotr was born in the Vladikavkaz into a well-known and distinguished family. He\nwas educated at Page Corps (graduated in 1874 with the first-class honours) and\nwas appointed Page of the Chamber. In 1875 he became a cornet at Her Empress\n[[Russian Guards#Imperial Russia|Leib-Guards]] [[Hussar]]s.\n\nPyotr Dmitrievich took part in the Russo-Turkish War, 1877â78 and was decorated\nfor his valor in the Battle of Kars. Then he studied at the General Staff\nAcademy (graduated in 1881). In 1884 he was the acting commander of staff of\n31st Infantry division, in 1887 he was the commander of staff of 3d\n[[Grenadier]] division. In 1895 he was appointed the Governor of Penza, and in\n1897 the Governor of Yekaterinoslav.\n\nIn 1900 Sipiagin appointed him Assistant Minister of the Interior and Commander\nof the Imperial Corps of Gendarmes. After Sipiagin's assassination (1902) Sviatopolk-\nMirskii resigned as Assistant Minister but was persuaded to accept the position\nof Governor-General of the North-Western province that included gubernias of\nVilna, Kovno and Grodno (that is modern-day Lithuania and most of the Belarus).\nAs the Governor-General, Sviatopolk-Mirskii was credited with successful liberal\nreforms, defusing national tensions in the provence by allowing more rights to\nthe national minorities, stopping pogroms against the Jews.\n\nIn July, 1904 he succeeded to the position of Minister of the Interior after\nPlehve's assassination. His appointment was seen as a victory of Liberals over\nthe Conservatives and in the Court term as a victory of the party of widow\nEmpress Maria Fyodorovna (who supported the liberal reforms and was a patroness\nof Pyotr's sister Olga) over the party of Empress consort Alexandra Fyodorovna.\n\nConservative Ministers Witte and Sipiagin credited Sviatopolk-Mirskii with being\nan honorable, intelligent man of the highest moral principles, which is notable\ndue to his attempts at liberal reform in Imperial Russia while Minister. These\nreforms began with permitting members of the local Zemstvos to gather to discuss\nbroader policy issues and coordination of Zemstvo programs, something that had\nnot been permitted in Russia regularly. The remaining reforms were embodied in a\ndecree that called for the inclusion of elected members to the State Council,\nremoval of the restrictions on the Old Believers, measures to strengthen\nlegality, extend freedom of the press and religion, broaden the authority of\nlocal self-government, eliminate unnecessary restrictions on non-Russians, and\ndo away with exceptional laws in general. Sviatopolk-Mirskii not only allowed\nthe congress, but also participated in its work and personally delivered its\ndecision to Tsar Nicholas II along with his own plan for constitutional reforms.\n\nThe Sviatopolk-Mirskii's plan included transferring more power to the State\nCouncil of Imperial Russia. The plan was much less radical than the reforms\nimplemented by the October Manifesto 1905, but in December 1904 it was\nconsidered ultra-radical and was dismissed.\n\nOn occurred the massacre of a peaceful demonstration in Saint Petersburg, known\nas Bloody Sunday. According to Pyotr Dmitrievich Sviatopolk-Miirskii, he never\nhad authorised the shooting of the demonstrators, but still fulfilled his final\nduty to the tsar, becoming the scapegoat for the massacre. According to\nMiirskii's opponents, he not only did authorise the shooting but also in order\nto push his own political agenda actively encouraged the demonstration.\n\nSviatopolk-Mirskii was replaced as Minister of the Interior by Bulygin in\nFebruary 1905 and retired from government service. As a retired Minister of\nInterior, he was expected to be appointed a member of the State Council of\nImperial Russia, but it was not the case. He retired from the political life\nuntil his death on May 16, 1914.\n","linknr":158,"url":"Pyotr_Dmitrievich_Sviatopolk-Mirskii","recorded":1375077818,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Pyotr_Dmitrievich_Sviatopolk-Mirskii&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Pyotr_Dmitrievich_Sviatopolk-Mirskii&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Prince_Sviatopolk-Mirskii","/wiki/File:Pyotr_dmitrievich_svyatopolk.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/66/Pyotr_dmitrievich_svyatopolk.jpg/250px-Pyotr_dmitrievich_svyatopolk.jpg","/wiki/File:Pyotr_dmitrievich_svyatopolk.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Russian_language","/wiki/Old_Style_and_New_Style_dates","/wiki/Vladikavkaz","/wiki/Old_Style_and_New_Style_dates","/wiki/Saint_Petersburg","/wiki/Russia","/wiki/Dmitry_Ivanovitch_Sviatopolk-Mirskii","/wiki/D._S._Mirsky","/wiki/Vladikavkaz","/wiki/Page_Corps","/wiki/Cornet","/wiki/Russian_Guards#Imperial_Russia","/wiki/Hussar","/wiki/Russo-Turkish_War,_1877%E2%80%9378","/wiki/Battle_of_Kars","/wiki/General_Staff_Academy_(Imperial_Russia)","/wiki/Grenadier","/wiki/Governor","/wiki/Penza","/wiki/Governor","/wiki/Yekaterinoslav","/wiki/Dmitry_Sergeyevich_Sipyagin","/wiki/Minister_of_the_Interior","/wiki/Gendarmerie","/wiki/Governor-General","/wiki/Vilna","/wiki/Kovno","/wiki/Grodno","/wiki/Lithuania","/wiki/Belarus","/wiki/Pogrom","/wiki/Jew","/wiki/MVD","/wiki/Vyacheslav_von_Plehve","/wiki/Liberalism","/wiki/Maria_Feodorovna_(Dagmar_of_Denmark)","/wiki/Empress_consort","/wiki/Alexandra_Fyodorovna_of_Hesse","/wiki/Sergei_Witte","/wiki/Imperial_Russia","/wiki/Zemstvo","/wiki/Old_Believer","/wiki/Nicholas_II","/wiki/State_Council_of_Imperial_Russia","/wiki/October_Manifesto","/wiki/Old_Style_and_New_Style_dates","/wiki/Saint_Petersburg","/wiki/Bloody_Sunday_(1905)","/wiki/Scapegoat","/wiki/Bulygin","/wiki/State_Council_of_Imperial_Russia","/w/index.php?title=Pyotr_Dmitrievich_Sviatopolk-Mirskii&action=edit&section=1","http://www.biografija.ru/show_bio.aspx?id=115770","/wiki/Vyacheslav_von_Plehve","/wiki/List_of_Ministers_of_Interior_of_Imperial_Russia","/wiki/Alexander_Bulygin","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/107223082","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilna_Gaon","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurva_Synagogue","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_of_Olives","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaddish","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilna_Gaon","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ehud_Olmert","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mea_Shearim","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pyotr_Dmitrievich_Sviatopolk-Mirskii&oldid=541734732","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Imperial_Russian_politicians","/wiki/Category:Russian_police_chiefs","/wiki/Category:Members_of_the_State_Council_of_the_Russian_Empire","/wiki/Category:1857_births","/wiki/Category:1914_deaths","/wiki/Category:People_from_Vladikavkaz","/wiki/Category:People_of_the_1905_Russian_Revolution","/wiki/Category:Articles_containing_Russian-language_text","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Pyotr+Dmitrievich+Sviatopolk-Mirskii&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Pyotr+Dmitrievich+Sviatopolk-Mirskii","/wiki/Pyotr_Dmitrievich_Sviatopolk-Mirskii","/wiki/Talk:Pyotr_Dmitrievich_Sviatopolk-Mirskii","#","/wiki/Pyotr_Dmitrievich_Sviatopolk-Mirskii","/w/index.php?title=Pyotr_Dmitrievich_Sviatopolk-Mirskii&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Pyotr_Dmitrievich_Sviatopolk-Mirskii&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Pyotr_Dmi
