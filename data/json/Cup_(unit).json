{"cursor":"9449","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":", capable of holding the volume one metric cup with a scale for imperial fluid\nounce as it is typically used in the Commonwealth countries.]] The 'cup' is a\ncustomary unit of measurement for volume, used in cooking to measure liquids\n(fluid measurement) and bulk foods such as granulated sugar (dry measurement)\nActual cups used in a household in any country may differ from the cup size used\nfor recipes; standard measuring cups, often calibrated in fluid measure and\nweights of usual dry ingredients as well as in cups, are available.\n\nAs a result of the fact that the imperial cup is actually out of use and the\nother definitions differ hardly (Â±3%), the U.S. measuring cups and metric\nmeasuring cups may be used as equal in practice.\n\nNo matter what size cup is used, the ingredients of a recipe measured with the\nsame size cup will have their volumes in the same proportion to one another.\nThe relative amounts to ingredients measured differently (by weight, or by\ndifferent measures of volume such as teaspoons, etc.) may be affected by the\ndefinitions used.\n\nMetric cup In Commonwealth of nations (such as Canada, Australia, New Zealand,\nIndian Subcontinent, South Africa, ...), Latin America and Lebanon one cup is\ncommonly defined as 250 millilitres. {|\n|- 1 cup ||=\n|align=right|250||millilitres\n|-\n|||=\n|align=right|16||international tablespoons (15 mL each)\n|-\n|||=\n|align=right|12.5||Australian tablespoons\n|-\n|||â\n|align=right|8.80||imperial fluid ounces\n|-\n|||â\n|align=right|8.45||U.S. customary fluid ounces\n|}\n\nUnited States customary cup United States customary cup is defined as half a\nU.S. pint. {|\n|- 1 U.S. customary cup ||=\n|align=right|||U.S. customary gallon\n|-\n|||=\n|align=right|||U.S. customary quart\n|-\n|||=\n|align=right|||U.S. customary pint\n|-\n|||=\n|align=right|8||U.S. customary fluid ounces\n|-\n|||=\n|align=right|16||U.S. customary tablespoons 1 U.S. customary cup =\n16 tablespoons exactly using the old U.S. customary tablespoon of\n U.S. fl oz.\n|-\n|||â¡\n|align=right|236.5882365||millilitres exactly\n|-\n|||â\n|align=right|15||international tablespoons\n|-\n|||â\n|align=right|11.75||Australian tablespoons\n|-\n|||â\n|align=right|0.833||imperial cups\n|-\n|||â\n|align=right|8.33||imperial fluid ounces\n|}\n\nUnited States \"legal\" cup The cup currently used in the United States for\nnutrition labeling is defined in United States law as 240 mL.
