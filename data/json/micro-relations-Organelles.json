Organelles are identified by microscopy, and can also be purified\nby cell fractionation. There are many types of organelles, particularly in\neukaryotic cells. While Prokaryotes do not possess organelles per se, some do\ncontain protein-based microcompartments, which are thought to act as primitive\norganelles.\n","linknr":606,"url":"Organelles","recorded":1362505613,"links":79,"instances":["cellular","biology","genetics","anatomy","genetics","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Organelles|*","Cell anatomy"],"headings":["History and terminology","Examples","Proteins and organelles","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/11/Animal_Cell.svg/350px-Animal_Cell.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f5/Carboxysomes_EM.jpg/350px-Carboxysomes_EM.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cell","biology"],["organ","anatomy"],["transcription","genetics"],["autophagy","cellular"],["translation","genetics"],["vesicle","biology"],["transcription","genetics"],["translation","genetics"],["cell","biology"]],"members":["autophagy","vesicle","translation","organ","transcription","cell"],"related":["Cell_biology","Cell_(biology)","Lipid_bilayer","Organ_(anatomy)","Body","Diminutive","Microscopy","Cell_fractionation","Eukaryote","Prokaryotes","Organism","Analogy","Diminutive","Karl_August_Möbius","Latin","Protist","Valentin_Häcker","Edmund_Beecher_Wilson","Oscar_Hertwig","Bengt_Lidforss","Flagella","Ciliates","Alfred_Kühn","Centriole","Vahlkampfia","Max_Hartmann","Biological_membrane","Eduard_Adolf_Strasburger","Albert_Frey-Wyssling","Centrosome","Cell_compartment","Endosymbiosis","Endosymbiotic","Bacterium","Mitochondrion","Plastid","Evolution_of_flagella","Macromolecule","Ribosome","Cytoskeleton","Flagellum","Centriole","Microtubule-organizing_center","Proteasome","Eukaryote","Cell_membrane","Cell_nucleus","Vacuoles","Light_microscope","Microscope","Eukaryotes","Chloroplast","Plastid","Photosynthesis","Kleptoplasty","Endoplasmic_reticulum","Golgi_apparatus","Mitochondrion","Vacuole","Homeostasis","Cell_nucleus","Transcription_(genetics)","Genome","DNA","Prokaryotes","Endosymbiotic_theory","Acrosome","Autophagy_(cellular)","Centriole","Cytoskeleton","Microtubule","Cilium","Microtubule","Eyespot_apparatus","Phototaxis","Green_algae","Photosynthesis","Euglenids","Glycosome","Glycolysis","Protozoa","Glyoxysome","Hydrogenosome","Lysosome","Melanosome","Mitosome","Myofibril","Nucleolus","Parenthesome","Peroxisome","Proteasome","Ribosome","Translation_(genetics)","Vesicle_(biology)","Cytosol","Endomembrane_system","Nucleosome","Microtubule","Cell_membrane","Prokaryote","Lipid_bilayer","Mesosome","Electron_microscopy","Bacterial_microcompartment","Carboxysome","Lipid_bilayer","Carboxysome","Carbon_fixation","Chlorosome","Photosynthesis","Green_sulfur_bacteria","Flagellum","Magnetosome","Magnetotactic_bacteria","Nucleoid","Transcription_(genetics)","Plasmid","Ribosome","Translation_(genetics)","Thylakoid","Photosynthesis","Pseudo_amino_acid_composition","Cell_(biology)","CoRR_Hypothesis","Ejectosome","Endosymbiotic_theory","Organelle_biogenesis"]}
