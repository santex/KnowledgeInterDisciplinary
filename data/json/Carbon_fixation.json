The most prominent example is\nphotosynthesis. Organisms that grow by fixing carbon are called\nautotrophsâplants for example. Heterotrophs, like animals, are organisms that\ngrow using the carbon fixed by autotrophs. Fixed carbon, reduced carbon, and\norganic carbon all mean organic compounds.\n","linknr":446,"url":"Carbon_fixation","recorded":1362509150,"links":30,"instances":["phylum"],"pdf":["http://www.botany.ubc.ca/keeling/PDF/09KeelingTCS.pdf","http://www.botany.ubc.ca/keeling/PDF/09KeelingTCS.pdf","http://cels.uri.edu/bio/lanelab/docs/Nic%20docs/PriceEtAl2012.pdf","http://cels.uri.edu/bio/lanelab/docs/Nic%20docs/PriceEtAl2012.pdf"],"categories":["Photosynthesis","Carbon","Metabolic pathways"],"headings":["Photosynthesis","Fossil carbon","Other autotrophic pathways","Non-autotrophic pathways","Carbon isotope discrimination","Other reduced carbon","References","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5a/20100422_235222_Cyanobacteria.jpg/220px-20100422_235222_Cyanobacteria.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/Equilibrium.svg/15px-Equilibrium.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/Equilibrium.svg/15px-Equilibrium.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/Equilibrium.svg/15px-Equilibrium.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["chloroflexi","phylum"],["chloroflexi","phylum"]],"members":["chloroflexi"],"related":["Biology","Redox","Carbon_dioxide","Organic_compound","Organism","Photosynthesis","Autotroph","Plant","Heterotroph","Animal","Photosynthesis","Metabolic_pathway","Primary_producer","Algae","Cyanobacteria","Chlorophyll","Calvin_cycle","Cyanobacteria","Electron_transfer","Hydronium","Oxygen","Adenosine_triphosphate","NADPH","Electron_transfer","Reductive_pentose_phosphate_cycle","Melvin_Calvin","Andrew_Benson","James_Bassham","Nobel_Prize_in_Chemistry","Algae","Cyanobacteria","Triose","Glyceraldehyde_3-phosphate","Dihydroxyacetone_phosphate","RuBisCO","Photorespiration","Carbonic_anhydrase","Bicarbonate","Anaplerotic_reaction","PEP_carboxylase","Phosphoenolpyruvate","Oxaloacetate","Dicarboxylic_acid","CAM_photosynthesis","Stomata","Malic_acid","Cacti","C4_carbon_fixation","Sugar_cane","Maize","C3_carbon_fixation","Δ13C","Bacteriochlorophyll","Purple_bacteria","Green_sulfur_bacteria","Chloroflexi_(phylum)","Phototroph","Eukaryotes","Phylum","Archaea","Obligate","Archaea","Halobacteriales","Bacteriorhodopsin","Retinal","Proton_gradient","Heliobacteria","Firmicutes","Kerogen","Sedimentary_rock","Chloroplast","Cyanobacteria","Proteobacteria","Purple_bacteria","Bacteria","Archaea","Reverse_Krebs_cycle","Citric_acid_cycle","Anaerobic_organism","Green_sulfur_bacteria","Wood-Ljungdahl_pathway","Gram-positive","Acetic_acid","3-Hydroxypropionate_pathway","Chloroflexi_(phylum)","Enzymes","3-hydroxypropionate/4-hydroxybutyrate_cycle","Metallosphaera","Dicarboxylate/4-hydroxybutyrate_cycle","Ignicoccus","Pyruvate_carboxylase","Gluconeogenesis","Carboxylase","RuBisCO","Carbon-12","Carbon-13","Water_use_efficiency","Graham_Cairns-Smith"]}
