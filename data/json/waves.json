'Wave motion' transfers energy\nfrom one point to another, often with no permanent displacement of the particles\nof the mediumâ€”that is, with little or no associated mass transport. They\nconsist, instead, of oscillations or vibrations around almost fixed locations.\nWaves are described by a wave equation which sets out how the disturbance\nproceeds over time. The mathematical form of this equation varies depending on\nthe type of wave.\n\nThere are two main types of waves. Mechanical waves propagate through a medium,\nand the substance of this medium is deformed. The deformation reverses itself\nowing to restoring forces resulting from its deformation. For example, sound\nwaves propagate via air molecules colliding with their neighbors. When air\nmolecules collide, they also bounce away from each other (a restoring force).\nThis keeps the molecules from continuing to travel in the direction of the wave.\n\nThe second main type of wave, electromagnetic waves, do not require a medium.\nInstead, they consist of periodic oscillations of electrical and magnetic fields\ngenerated by charged particles, and can therefore travel through a vacuum. These\ntypes of waves vary in wavelength, and include radio waves, microwaves, infrared\nradiation, visible light, ultraviolet radiation, X-rays, and gamma rays.\n\nFurther, the behavior of particles in quantum mechanics is described by waves\nand researchers believe that gravitational waves also travel through space,\nalthough gravitational waves have never been directly detected.\n\nA wave can be transverse or longitudinal depending on the direction of its\noscillation. Transverse waves occur when a disturbance creates oscillations\nperpendicular (at right angles) to the propagation (the direction of energy\ntransfer). Longitudinal waves occur when the oscillations are parallel to the\ndirection of propagation. While mechanical waves can be both transverse and\nlongitudinal, all electromagnetic waves are transverse.\n","title":"Wave","headings":["General features","Mathematical description of one-dimensional waves","Sinusoidal waves","Plane waves","Standing waves","Physical properties","Mechanical waves","Electromagnetic waves","Quantum mechanical waves","Gravitational waves","WKB method","References","See also","Sources","External links"]},"micro-relation":["6: Phase_velocity","5: Group_velocity","4: Energy","4: Quantum_mechanics","4: Wavelength","3: Vacuum","3: Vibration","3: Momentum","3: Wave_packet","3: Sine_wave","2: Physics","2: Visible_light","2: Gravitational_radiation","2: Transverse_wave","2: Standing_wave","2: Microwaves","2: Radio_waves","2: Amplitude","2: Dispersion_relation","2: Linear","2: Nonlinear","2: D'Alembert's_formula","2: Gravity_waves","2: Envelope_detector","2: Wavenumber","2: Angular_frequency","2: Electric_field","2: Fourier_analysis","2: Superposition_principle","2: Vibrations_of_a_circular_drum","2: Transmission_medium","2: Sound","2: Ripple_tank","2: Ocean_surface_wave","2: Wave_function","2: Wave_vector","1: Water","1: Oscillation","1: Mechanical_wave","1: Restoring_force","1: Electromagnetic_wave","1: Radio_wave","1: Microwave","1: Infrared_radiation","1: Ultraviolet_radiation","1: X-ray","1: Gamma_ray","1: Longitudinal_wave","1: Phenomenon","1: Water_waves","1: Gamma_waves","1: Light_waves","1: Radar","1: Sound_waves","1: Acoustics","1: Optics","1: Mass","1: Inertia","1: Vortex","1: Radiation_pressure","1: Shock_waves","1: Rayleigh_waves","1: Light","1: Scattering","1: Waveform","1: Partial_differential_equation","1: Duhamel's_principle","1: Square_wave","1: Triangle_wave","1: Sawtooth_wave","1: Amplitude_modulation","1: Plane_wave","1: Euler's_formula","1: Stationary_phase_approximation","1: Coordinate","1: Distance","1: Radian","1: Frequency","1: Hertz","1: Periodic_function","1: Linear_time-invariant_system","1: KramersÃ¢Â€Â“Kronig_relation","1: Sine_function","1: Violin","1: Antiphase","1: Antinode","1: Energy_transfer","1: Fundamental_frequency","1: Overtone","1: Incident_ray","1: Perpendicular","1: Refractive_index","1: Snell's_law","1: Isaac_Newton","1: Vibrating_string","1: Linear_mass_density","1: Speed_of_sound","1: Inertial_waves","1: Coriolis_effect","1: Traffic_wave","1: Metachronal_rhythm","1: Mass-energy_equivalence","1: Magnetic_field","1: James_Clerk_Maxwell","1: Wave_equation","1: Speed_of_light","1: Infrared","1: Ultraviolet","1: X-rays","1: SchrÃƒÂ¶dinger_equation","1: Louis_de_Broglie","1: Planck's_constant","1: De_Broglie_wavelength","1: Electron","1: Cathode_ray_tube","1: Gaussian_function","1: Heisenberg_uncertainty_principle","1: Fourier_transform","1: Spacetime","1: General_relativity","1: WKB_method","1: Cochlea","1: Audience_wave","1: Beat_wave","1: Capillary_waves","1: Cymatics","1: Doppler_effect","1: Harmonic","1: Inertial_wave","1: Index_of_wave_articles","1: List_of_waves_named_after_people","1: Reaction-diffusion_equation","1: Resonance","1: Shallow_water_equations","1: Shive_wave_machine","1: Wave_turbulence","1: Waves_in_plasmas"]}
