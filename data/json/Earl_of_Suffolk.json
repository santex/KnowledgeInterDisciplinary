The first creation, in tandem with the creation of the title of\nEarl of Norfolk, came before 1069 in favour of Ralph the Staller; but the title\nwas forfeited by his heir, Ralph de Guader, in 1074. The second creation came\nin 1337 in favour of Robert de Ufford; the title became extinct on the death of\nhis son, the second Earl, in 1382. The third creation came in 1385 in favour of\nMichael de la Pole. For more information on this creation, see the Duke of\nSuffolk (1448 creation). The fourth creation came in 1603.

His son, the seventh Earl, was Lord-Lieutenant of Essex and is also\nremembered as the owner of the slave Scipio Africanus.
