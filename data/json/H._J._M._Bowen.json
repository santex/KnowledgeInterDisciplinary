He attended the Dragon School, gaining a scholarship to\nRugby School and then a demyship to Magdalen College, Oxford. He won the Gibbs\nPrize in 1949 and completed a DPhil in chemistry at Oxford University in 1953\nbefore starting his professional career as a chemist. Bowen was also a\nproficient amateur actor in his early years, appearing with a young Ronnie\nBarker at Oxford.\n\nHis first post was with the Atomic Energy Research Establishment (AERE), working\nat the Wantage Research Laboratory, then in Berkshire. His early work started an\ninterest in radioisotopes and trace elements that he maintained throughout his\nworking life. While at AERE, he spent several months in 1956 attending the\nBritish nuclear tests at Maralinga in Australia to study the environmental\neffects of radiation.\n\nBowen realized that the calibration of different instruments intended to measure\ntrace elements was an important issue that needed addressing. His solution was\nto produce a good supply of a material which later become known as [[Bowen's\nKale]]. With Peter Cawse, he grew a large amount of the plant kale, then dried\nand crushed it into a homogeneous and stable substance that he then freely\ndistributed to researchers around the world for years to come. This was probably\nthe first successful example of such a standard.\n\nIn 1964, he was appointed as a lecturer in the chemistry department at the\nUniversity of Reading. Later he was promoted to Reader in Analytical Chemistry\nin 1974. At Reading, Bowen undertook consultancy for Dunlop, investigating\npotential uses for their products. When the [[Torrey Canyon]] oil disaster\noccurred in 1967, he realized that it might be possible to use foam booms to\nblock the oil from spreading in the English Channel. His original experiments\nwere conducted in a small bucket in his laboratory. Although not entirely\nsuccessful in reality at the time due to the rough seas, this lateral thinking\ncombined his interest in chemistry with his love of nature and has since been\neffectively deployed to protect ports and harbours against encroaching oil\nslicks. Bowen wrote a number of professional books in the field of chemistry,\nincluding two editions of [[Trace elements|Trace Elements]] in [[Biochemistry]]\n(1966 and 1976).

He was meetings secretary for a period and the\nofficial recorder of plants for the counties of Berkshire and Dorset, producing\nFloras for both counties. He retired to Winterborne Kingston in Dorset at the end of his\nlife. He was also one of the leading contributors of botanical data for the\nFlora of Oxfordshire. He acted as an expert botanical guide on tours\naround Europe, especially Greece.\n\nHumphry Bowen established the 'Bowen Cup' at the University of Reading in 1988,\nan annual prize for the student in the Department of Chemistry at the University\nwho achieves the top marks in Part II Analytical Chemistry.\n","linknr":209,"url":"H._J._M._Bowen","recorded":1372152346,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Humphry_Bowen&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Humphry_Bowen&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","/wiki/Humphry_Bowen","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","/w/index.php?title=H._J._M._Bowen&redirect=no","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Humphry_Bowen.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2f/Humphry_Bowen.jpg","/wiki/Oxford","/wiki/England","/wiki/Dorset","/wiki/United_Kingdom","/wiki/Analytical_chemistry","/wiki/Botany","/wiki/Lichenology","/wiki/Atomic_Energy_Research_Establishment","/wiki/University_of_Reading","/wiki/Alma_mater","/wiki/Magdalen_College,_Oxford","/wiki/Trace_elements","/wiki/Bowen%27s_Kale","/wiki/Flora_(publication)","/wiki/Berkshire","#cite_note-berkshire-flora-1","/wiki/Dorset","#cite_note-dorset-flora-2","/wiki/Botanist","/wiki/Chemist","#cite_note-3","#cite_note-4","#cite_note-5","#cite_note-independent-6","#cite_note-7","/wiki/Oxford","/wiki/Edmund_Bowen","#cite_note-symonds-8","/wiki/Dragon_School","/wiki/Scholarship","/wiki/Rugby_School","/wiki/Demyship","/wiki/Magdalen_College,_Oxford","/wiki/DPhil","/wiki/Chemistry","/wiki/Oxford_University","/wiki/Ronnie_Barker","/wiki/Atomic_Energy_Research_Establishment","/wiki/Wantage","/wiki/Berkshire","/wiki/Radioisotopes","/wiki/Trace_elements","/wiki/British_nuclear_tests_at_Maralinga","/wiki/Maralinga","/wiki/Australia","/wiki/Radiation","/wiki/Calibration","/wiki/Trace_elements","/wiki/Bowen%27s_Kale","/wiki/Kale","/wiki/University_of_Reading","/wiki/Analytical_chemistry","/wiki/Dunlop_Rubber","/wiki/Torrey_Canyon","/wiki/English_Channel","/wiki/Trace_elements","/wiki/Biochemistry","#cite_note-9","/wiki/Botanical_Society_of_the_British_Isles","/wiki/Berkshire","/wiki/Dorset","/wiki/Flora_(plants)","#cite_note-berkshire-flora-1","#cite_note-dorset-flora-2","/wiki/Winterborne_Kingston","#cite_note-10","/wiki/Greece","#cite_note-11","/w/index.php?title=Humphry_Bowen&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Jonathan_Bowen","#cite_note-symonds-8","/wiki/George_Claridge_Druce","/wiki/Victorian_era","/wiki/Flora_(publication)","/wiki/Counties_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Tottles","/w/index.php?title=Humphry_Bowen&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Academic_Press","/wiki/McGraw-Hill","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0121204502","/w/index.php?title=Humphry_Bowen&action=edit&section=3","#cite_ref-berkshire-flora_1-0","#cite_ref-berkshire-flora_1-1","#cite_ref-dorset-flora_2-0","#cite_ref-dorset-flora_2-1","http://web.archive.org/web/20060902220036/http://www.naturebureau.co.uk/shop/books/Dorsetflora.html","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Special:BookSources/1-874357-16-1","#cite_ref-3","http://web.archive.org/web/20071202071551/www.jpbowen.com/publications/hjmb-obituary.html","/wiki/The_Times","#cite_ref-4","http://education.guardian.co.uk/obituary/story/0,12212,750151,00.html","/wiki/The_Guardian","#cite_ref-5","http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1339494/Humphry-Bowen.html","/wiki/The_Daily_Telegraph","#cite_ref-independent_6-0","http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/humphry-bowen-729440.html","/wiki/The_Independent","#cite_ref-7","http://www.herbarium.rdg.ac.uk/modules.php?name=Collectors&rop=show_collector&id=12","/wiki/Watsonia_(journal)","#cite_ref-symonds_8-0","#cite_ref-symonds_8-1","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Special:BookSources/1-899536-25-6","#cite_ref-9","http://openlibrary.org/a/OL1636071A/H.-J.-M.-Bowen","/wiki/Open_Library","#cite_ref-10","/wiki/Stan_Woodell","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Special:BookSources/1-874357-07-2","#cite_ref-11","http://www.reading.ac.uk/chemistry/News/chem-news.aspx","/wiki/University_of_Reading","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/61606227","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","/wiki/Oxford","/wiki/England","/wiki/Dorchester,_Dorset","/wiki/England","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Humphry_Bowen&oldid=558321112","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1929_births","/wiki/Category:2001_deaths","/wiki/Category:People_from_Oxford","/wiki/Category:People_educated_at_The_Dragon_School","/wiki/Category:People_educated_at_Rugby_School","/wiki/Category:Alumni_of_Magdalen_College,_Oxford","/wiki/C
