{"cursor":"8819","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n showing the mutual annihilation of a bound state electron positron pair into\n two photons. This bound state is more commonly known as positronium.]]\n 'Annihilation' is defined as \"total destruction\" or \"complete obliteration\" of\n an object; [http://dictionary.reference.com/search?r=2&q=Annihilation -\n Dictionary Definition] (2006) Dictionary.com. having its root in the\n Latin nihil (nothing). A literal translation is \"to make into nothing\".\n\nIn physics, the word is used to denote the process that occurs when a subatomic\nparticle collides with its respective antiparticle. Since energy and\nmomentum must be conserved, the particles are simply transformed into new\nparticles. They do not disappear from existence. Antiparticles have exactly\nopposite additive quantum numbers from particles, so the sums of all quantum\nnumbers of the original pair are zero. Hence, any set of particles may be\nproduced whose total quantum numbers are also zero as long as conservation of\nenergy and conservation of momentum are obeyed. When a particle and its\nantiparticle collide, their energy is converted into a force carrier particle,\nsuch as a gluon, W/Z force carrier particle, or a photon. These particles are\nafterwards transformed into other particles.\n\nDuring a low-energy annihilation, photon production is favored, since these\nparticles have no mass. However, high-energy particle colliders produce\nannihilations where a wide variety of exotic heavy particles are created.\n","linknr":202,"url":"Annihilation","recorded":1362507544,"links":48,"instances":["particle_physics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Particle physics","Antimatter"],"headings":["Examples of annihilation","References","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e0/Mutual_Annihilation_of_a_Positron_Electron_pair.svg/200px-Mutual_Annihilation_of_a_Positron_Electron_pair.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["flavour","particle_physics"]],"members":["flavour"],"related":["Electron","Positron","Positronium","Physics","Subatomic_particle","Antiparticle","Quantum_number","Conservation_of_energy","Conservation_of_momentum","Photon","Particle_collider","Renormalization","Quantum_field_theory","Electron","Positron","Gamma_ray","Photon","Mass-energy","Pair_production","Quantum_field_theory","Uncertainty_principle","Vacuum_state","Renormalization","Proton","Antiproton","Meson","Pion","Kaon","Gamma_ray","Electron","Positron","Neutrino","Baryon","Up_quark","Down_quark","Strong_nuclear_force","Kinetic_energy","Strange_quark","Flavour_(particle_physics)","Rest_mass","Speed_of_light","Pair_production","Electron-positron_annihilation","Proton-antiproton_annihilation","Neutron-antineutron_annihilation","Creation_and_annihilation_operators"]}
