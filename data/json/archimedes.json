Among his advances in physics are the\nfoundations of hydrostatics, statics and an explanation of the principle of the\nlever. He is credited with designing innovative machines, including siege\nengines and the screw pump that bears his name. Modern experiments have tested\nclaims that Archimedes designed machines capable of lifting attacking ships out\nof the water and setting ships on fire using an array of mirrors.<ref\nname=\"death ray\"/>\n\nArchimedes is generally considered to be the greatest mathematician of antiquity\nand one of the greatest of all time.<ref></ref><ref></ref> He used the method of\nexhaustion to calculate the area under the arc of a parabola with the summation\nof an infinite series, and gave a remarkably accurate approximation of\npi.<ref></ref> He also defined the spiral bearing his name, formulae for the\nvolumes of surfaces of revolution and an ingenious system for expressing very\nlarge numbers.\n\nArchimedes died during the Siege of Syracuse when he was killed by a Roman\nsoldier despite orders that he should not be harmed. Cicero describes visiting\nthe tomb of Archimedes, which was surmounted by a sphere inscribed within a\ncylinder. Archimedes had proven that the sphere has two thirds of the volume and\nsurface area of the cylinder (including the bases of the latter), and regarded\nthis as the greatest of his mathematical achievements.\n\nUnlike his inventions, the mathematical writings of Archimedes were little known\nin antiquity. Mathematicians from Alexandria read and quoted him, but the first\ncomprehensive compilation was not made until c. 530&nbsp;AD by Isidore of\nMiletus, while commentaries on the works of Archimedes written by Eutocius in\nthe sixth century AD opened them to wider readership for the first time. The\nrelatively few copies of Archimedes' written work that survived through the\nMiddle Ages were an influential source of ideas for scientists during the\nRenaissance,<ref></ref> while the discovery in 1906 of previously unknown works\nby Archimedes in the Archimedes Palimpsest has provided new insights into how he\nobtained mathematical results.<ref></ref>\n","title":"archimedes","headings":["Biography","Discoveries and inventions","Mathematics","Writings","Archimedes Palimpsest","Legacy","See also","Notes","References","Further reading","External links"]},"micro-relation":["7: Syracuse,_Sicily","5: Archimedes_Palimpsest","4: Magna_Graecia","4: Lever","4: Parabola","4: Alexandria","4: Pappus_of_Alexandria","3: Archimedes'_principle","3: Archimedes'_screw","3: Fluid_statics","3: Archimedes'_use_of_infinitesimals","3: Method_of_exhaustion","3: Cicero","3: Sphere","3: T._L._Heath","3: Plutarch","3: Conon_of_Samos","3: Vitruvius","3: Triangle","2: Physics","2: Astronomer","2: Area","2: Volume","2: Isidore_of_Miletus","2: Eutocius_of_Ascalon","2: Renaissance","2: Hiero_II_of_Syracuse","2: Eratosthenes","2: Marcus_Claudius_Marcellus","2: Buoyancy","2: Galileo_Galilei","2: Lucian","2: Anthemius_of_Tralles","2: Archytas","2: Geometric_series","2: Myriad","2: Theon_of_Alexandria","2: Dissection_puzzle","1: Domenico_Fetti","1: Mathematics","1: Engineering","1: Astronomy","1: Invention","1: Greek_mathematics","1: Physicist","1: Engineer","1: Inventor","1: Scientist","1: Classical_antiquity","1: Statics","1: Machine","1: Siege_engine","1: Mathematician","1: Pi","1: Archimedes_spiral","1: Surface_of_revolution","1: Roman_Republic","1: Inscribe","1: Middle_Ages","1: Berlin","1: Colonies_in_antiquity","1: Byzantine_Greeks","1: John_Tzetzes","1: Ancient_Egypt","1: Second_Punic_War","1: Siege","1: Mathematical_diagram","1: Latin","1: Noli_turbare_circulos_meos","1: Orator","1: Quaestor","1: Sicily","1: Polybius","1: Livy","1: Anecdote","1: Votive_crown","1: Gold","1: Silver","1: Density","1: Athenaeus","1: Aphrodite","1: Archimedes_screw","1: Hanging_Gardens_of_Babylon","1: Steamboat","1: Propeller","1: Claw_of_Archimedes","1: Burning-glass","1: Galen","1: RenÃ©_Descartes","1: Bronze","1: Copper","1: Parabolic_reflector","1: Solar_furnace","1: Skaramagas","1: Athens","1: Bitumen","1: Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology","1: San_Francisco","1: Autoignition_temperature","1: Barack_Obama","1: Peripatetic_school","1: Aristotle","1: Block_and_tackle","1: Pulley","1: Catapult","1: Odometer","1: First_Punic_War","1: Dialogue","1: Thales","1: Eudoxus_of_Cnidus","1: Gaius_Sulpicius_Gallus","1: Lucius_Furius_Philus","1: Planetarium","1: Orrery","1: Antikythera_mechanism","1: Hexagon","1: Infinitesimal","1: Integral","1: Reductio_ad_absurdum","1: Regular_hexagon","1: Circle","1: Radius","1: Archimedean_property","1: Square_root","1: John_Wallis","1: Iteration","1: Geometric_series#Common_ratio","1: Secant_line","1: Names_of_large_numbers","1: Doric_Greek","1: Euclid","1: Polyhedron","1: Refraction","1: Byzantine_Empire","1: ThÄbit_ibn_Qurra","1: Gerard_of_Cremona","1: Basel","1: Axiom","1: Center_of_mass","1: Parallelogram","1: Approximations_of_Ï","1: Archimedean_spiral","1: Angular_velocity","1: Polar_coordinate_system","1: Real_number","1: Curve","1: Circumscribe","1: Diameter","1: Ratio","1: Tangram","1: Stanford_University","1: Combinatorics","1: Ancient_Greek","1: Ausonius","1: Gotthold_Ephraim_Lessing","1: WolfenbÃ¼ttel","1: Germany","1: Diophantine_equation","1: Square_number","1: Heliocentrism","1: Solar_System","1: Aristarchus_of_Samos","1: Arabic_language","1: Marshall_Clagett","1: Heron's_formula","1: Hero_of_Alexandria","1: Constantinople","1: Palimpsest","1: Vellum","1: Christie's","1: New_York_City","1: Suda","1: Walters_Art_Museum","1: Baltimore","1: Maryland","1: Ultraviolet","1: Light","1: Impact_crater","1: Moon","1: Montes_Archimedes","1: Asteroid","1: 3600_Archimedes","1: Fields_Medal","1: East_Germany","1: Greece","1: Italy","1: Nicaragua","1: San_Marino","1: Spain","1: California","1: Sutter's_Mill","1: California_Gold_Rush","1: Oregon","1: John_Kitzhaber","1: Arbelos","1: Axiom_of_Archimedes","1: Archimedes_number","1: Archimedes_paradox","1: Archimedean_solid","1: Archimedes'_circles","1: List_of_things_named_after_Archimedes","1: Methods_of_computing_square_roots","1: Pseudo-Archimedes","1: Salinon","1: Steam_cannon","1: Syracusia","1: Zhang_Heng","1: Carl_Benjamin_Boyer","1: Skiff"]}
