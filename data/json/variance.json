It is one of several descriptors of a probability\ndistribution, describing how far the numbers lie from the mean (expected value).\nIn particular, the variance is one of the moments of a distribution. In that\ncontext, it forms part of a systematic approach to distinguishing between\nprobability distributions. While other such approaches have been developed,\nthose based on moments are advantageous in terms of mathematical and\ncomputational simplicity.\n\nThe variance is a parameter describing in part either the actual probability\ndistribution of an observed population of numbers, or the theoretical\nprobability distribution of a sample (a not-fully-observed population) of\nnumbers. In the latter case a sample of data from such a distribution can be\nused to construct an estimate of its variance: in the simplest cases this\nestimate can be the sample variance.\n","title":"variance","headings":["Definition","Examples","Properties","Approximating the variance of a function","Population variance and sample variance","Generalizations","Tests of equality of variances","History","Moment of inertia","See also","Notes"]},"micro-relation":["5: Covariance","4: Probability_density_function","4: Normal_distribution","3: Probability_mass_function","2: Probability_distribution","2: Central_limit_theorem","2: Linear_combination","2: Law_of_large_numbers","2: Standard_deviation","2: Unbiased_estimation_of_standard_deviation","2: Ronald_Fisher","1: Probability_theory","1: Statistics","1: Mean","1: Population_parameter","1: Central_moment","1: Expected_value","1: Discrete_random_variable","1: Continuous_random_variable","1: Cantor_distribution","1: Cumulant","1: Sigma","1: Continuous_distribution","1: Definite_integral","1: Cauchy_distribution","1: Pareto_distribution","1: Pareto_index","1: Discrete_probability_distribution","1: Weighted_variance","1: Exponential_distribution","1: Poisson_distribution","1: Binomial_distribution","1: Dice","1: Data_set","1: Location_parameter","1: Covariance#Definition","1: Covariance#Uncorrelatedness_and_independence","1: Uncorrelated","1: Irénée-Jules_Bienaymé","1: Michel_Loeve","1: Statistical_independence","1: Leo_Goodman","1: Correlated","1: Cronbach's_alpha","1: Classical_test_theory","1: Spearman–Brown_prediction_formula","1: Law_of_total_variance","1: Conditional_expectation","1: Conditional_variance","1: Analysis_of_variance","1: Linear_regression","1: Catastrophic_cancellation","1: Cumulative_distribution_function","1: Transpose","1: Root_mean_square_deviation","1: Robust_statistics","1: Outlier","1: Measurement_error","1: Heavy-tailed_distribution","1: Delta_method","1: Taylor_expansion","1: Taylor_expansions_for_the_moments_of_functions_of_random_variables","1: Estimation_theory","1: Observations","1: Sample_space","1: Statistical_population","1: Statistical_sample","1: Sample_mean","1: Bessel's_correction","1: Sample_covariance","1: Sample_standard_deviation","1: Concave_function","1: Jensen's_inequality","1: U-statistic","1: Random_variable","1: Cochran's_theorem","1: Chi-squared_distribution","1: Excess_kurtosis","1: Moment_about_the_mean","1: Consistent_estimator","1: Samuelson's_inequality","1: Harmonic_mean","1: Vector_space","1: Positive_definite_matrix","1: Covariance_matrix","1: Complex_number","1: Conjugate_transpose","1: F_test","1: Chi_square_test","1: Capon_test","1: Mood_test","1: Klotz_test","1: Sukhatme_test","1: Median","1: Lehman_test","1: Box_test","1: Box-Anderson_test","1: Moses_test","1: Bootstrap","1: Biometry","1: Square_root","1: Mean_square_error","1: Moment_of_inertia","1: Classical_mechanics","1: Moment_of_inertia_tensor","1: Algorithms_for_calculating_variance","1: Average_absolute_deviation","1: Bhatia–Davis_inequality","1: Common-method_variance","1: Correlation","1: Chebyshev's_inequality","1: Distance_variance","1: Estimation_of_covariance_matrices","1: Explained_variance","1: Homoscedasticity","1: Mean_absolute_error","1: Mean_difference","1: Mean_preserving_spread","1: Pooled_variance","1: Popoviciu's_inequality_on_variances","1: Qualitative_variation","1: Sample_mean_and_covariance","1: Semivariance","1: Skewness","1: Taylor's_law","1: Weighted_mean#Weighted_sample_variance"]}
