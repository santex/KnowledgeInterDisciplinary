It may be used for\ndyeing fabrics, or for intensifying stains in cell or tissue preparations. The\nterm mordant comes from the present participle of French mordre, \"to bite\". In\nthe past, it was thought that a mordant helped the dye bite onto the fiber so\nthat it would hold fast during washing. A mordant is often a polyvalent metal\nion. {{Cite news |url= http://web.archi-\nve.org/web/20070814015208/stainsfile.info/StainsFile/theory/mordant.htm\n|title=Stain Theory â How mordants work |last=Llewellyn |first=Bryan D.\n|date=May, 2005 }}  The resulting coordination complex of dye and ion is\ncolloidal and can be either acidic or alkaline.\n","linknr":235,"url":"Mordant","recorded":1362560871,"links":20,"instances":["chemistry","chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Dyes","Printing","Printmaking","Electronics manufacturing"],"headings":["Common dye mordants","Dyeing methods","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/Indienne%2C_Wesserling.JPG/220px-Indienne%2C_Wesserling.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c9/Dye_rot.jpg/220px-Dye_rot.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/Teinture_naturelle_Millepertuis_2.jpg/100px-Teinture_naturelle_Millepertuis_2.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["valence","chemistry"],["base","chemistry"]],"members":["base","valence"],"related":["Dye","Coordination_complex","Stain","Valence_(chemistry)","Metal","Ion","Colloidal","Acid","Base_(chemistry)","Tannic_acid","Alum","Urine","Chrome_alum","Sodium_chloride","Salt","Aluminium","Chromium","Copper","Iron","Iodine","Potassium","Sodium","Tin","Gram_stain","Tints_and_shades","Lake_pigment","Lac","Shellac","Wool","Amphoteric","Hydrolyse","Silk","Thio-","Cystine","Amino_acid","Hexavalent","Potassium_dichromate","Trivalent","Histology","Microscopy","Haematoxylin","H&E_stain"]}
