{"cursor":"61038","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n'Palm oil' is an edible vegetable oil derived from the mesocarp (reddish pulp)\nof the fruit of the oil palms, primarily the African oil palm [[Elaeis\nguineensis]], and to a lesser extent from the American oil palm\n[[Elaeis oleifera]] and the maripa palm [[Attalea maripa]]. It is naturally\nreddish in color because of a high beta-carotene content. It is not to be\nconfused with palm kernel oil derived from the kernel of the same\nfruit, or coconut oil derived from the kernel of the coconut palm\n([[Cocos nucifera]]). The differences are in color (raw palm kernel oil lacks\ncarotenoids and is not red), and in saturated fat content: Palm mesocarp oil is\n41% saturated, while Palm Kernel oil and Coconut oil are 81% and 86% saturated\nrespectively Harold McGee. On Food And Cooking: The Science And Lore Of The\nKitchen, Scribner, 2004 edition. ISBN 978-0-684-80001-1\n\nPalm oil, along with coconut oil, is one of the few highly saturated vegetable\nfats. It is semi-solid at room temperatures and contains several saturated and\nunsaturated fats in the forms of glyceryl laurate (0.1%, saturated), myristate\n(1%, saturated), palmitate (44%, saturated), stearate (5%, saturated), oleate\n(39%, monounsaturated), linoleate (10%, polyunsaturated), and alpha-linolenate\n(0.3%, polyunsaturated). Like all vegetable oils, palm oil does not\ncontain cholesterol, US Federal Food, Drug & Cosmetic Act, 21 CFR 101.25 as\namended in Federal Register July 19, 1990, Vol.55 No.139 pg.29472 UK\nFood Labelling Regulations (SI 1984, No.1305) although saturated fat\nintake increases both LDL and HDL cholesterol. Palm oil is\nGMO-free, i.e., it is not derived from genetically modified\norganisms.\n\nPalm oil is a common cooking ingredient in the tropical belt of Africa,\nSoutheast Asia and parts of Brazil. Its use in the commercial food industry in\nother parts of the world is buoyed by its lower cost and by the high\noxidative stability (saturation) of the refined product when used for\nfrying. A recent rise in the use of palm oil in the food\nindustry has come from changed labelling requirements that have caused a switch\naway from using trans fats although palm oil is not a\nhealthy alternative to oils that contain trans fats.\n\nThe use of palm oil in food products attracts the concern of environmental\nactivist groups; the high oil yield of the trees, attractive to profit-driven\ninvestors, has led, in parts of Indonesia, to removal of forests in order to\nmake space for oil-palm monoculture. This has resulted in acreage losses of the\nnatural habitat of the orangutan, of which both species are endangered and the\nSumatran orangutan has been listed as \"critically endangered\". International\nUnion for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The IUCN Red List of Threatened\nSpecies; Pongo pygmaeus. http://www.iucnredlist.org/apps/redlist/details/17975/0\n. Accessed: 2012-04-12 Consumer pressure could encourage palm oil\ncompanies to modify their practices. The Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil, an\ninternational non-profit association that brings together conservation groups\nand palm-oil firms, says that it \"will not certify oil grown on land that was\ndeforested to farm the crop\".\n","linknr":972,"url":"Palm_oil","recorded":1362499990,"links":96,"instances":["cleaning_product","grinding","soap","biology"],"pdf":["http://www.fas.usda.gov/oilseeds/circular/2006/06-06/Junecov.pdf","http://www.fas.usda.gov/oilseeds/circular/2006/06-06/Junecov.pdf","http://docsdrive.com/pdfs/academicjournals/ajbmb/0000/38799-38799.pdf","http://docsdrive.com/pdfs/academicjournals/ajbmb/0000/38799-38799.pdf","http://www.africa.kyoto-u.ac.jp/kiroku/asm_normal/abstracts/pdf/21-1/19-33.pdf","http://economics.dstcentre.com/Development%20of%20Palm%20Oil%20and%20Related%20Products%20in%20Malaysia%20and%20Indonesia%20By%20Rajah%20Rasiah%20&%20Azmi%20Shahrin.pdf","http://tcdc2.undp.org/GSSDAcademy/SIE/Docs/Vol5/Oil.pdf","http://palmoilis.mpob.gov.my/publications/joprv12n1-14.pdf","http://www.unu.edu/unupress/food/fnb21-2.pdf","http://palmoilis.mpob.gov.my/publications/pod36_13-19.pdf","http://palmoilis.mpob.gov.my/publications/pod36_13-19.pdf","http://publib.upol.cz/~obd/fulltext/Biomedic146-2/LF11_2002-1.pdf","http://publib.upol.cz/~obd/fulltext/Biomedic146-2/LF11_2002-1.pdf","http://palmoilis.mpob.gov.my/publications/joprv18june-loh.pdf","http://gain.fas.usda.gov/Recent%20GAIN%20Publications/NEW%20EU%20FOOD%20LABELING%20RULES%20PUBLISHED_Brussels%20USEU_EU-27_1-12-2012.pdf","http://gain.fas.usda.gov/Recent%20GAIN%20Publications/NEW%20EU%20FOOD%20LABELING%20RULES%20PUBLISHED_Brussels%20USEU_EU-27_1-12-2012.pdf","http://www.simedarby.com/downloads/pdfs/NEWS/News-20061227.pdf","http://www.simedarby.com/downloads/pdfs/NEWS/News-20061227.pdf","http://www.ippanigeria.org/worldbankreportpalmoil%5B1%5D.pdf","http://www.ippanigeria.org/worldbankreportpalmoil%5B1%5D.pdf","http://www.utexas.edu/law/academics/centers/humanrights/projects_and_publications/colombia-report.pdf","http://www.cifor.org/publications/pdf_files/WPapers/WP-78Andriani.pdf","http://www.cifor.org/publications/pdf_files/WPapers/WP-78Andriani.pdf","http://www.internal-displacement.org/8025708F004BE3B1/(httpInfoFiles)/B3EE02C81FE75923C125738A003536C9/$file/Colombia_press_release_nov07.pdf","http://www.internal-displacement.org/8025708F004BE3B1/(httpInfoFiles)/B3EE02C81FE75923C125738A003536C9/$file/Colombia_press_release_nov07.pdf","http://www.cspinet.org/palm/PalmOilReport.pdf","http://www.cspinet.org/palm/PalmOilReport.pdf","http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/natc/malnc2.pdf","http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/natc/malnc2.pdf","http://www.cspinet.org/new/pdf/palm_oil_final_5-27-05.pdf","http://www.cspinet.org/new/pdf/palm_oil_final_5-27-05.pdf","http://www.who.int/dietphysicalactivity/media/en/gsfao_cmo_042.pdf","http://www.who.int/dietphysicalactivity/media/en/gsfao_cmo_102.pdf","http://www.who.int/dietphysicalactivity/media/en/gsfao_cmo_102.pdf","http://www.kmitl.ac.th/ejkmitl/vol5no2/p502-505.pdf"],"categories":["Oil
