{"cursor":"2787","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The â'McGuire Rig'â was used to extract soldiers from the jungles of Vietnam. It\nwould be suspended from a helicopter and used to extract soldiers from areas\nwithout a suitable pick-up zone. It was simple, inexpensive, and effective.\nAlthough less comfortable than the STABO (Short Tactical Air Borne\nOperations) [http://www.vietnamgear.com/kit.aspx?kit=661] harness, it\ndid not require the soldier to carry any special equipment. It was designed by\nSergeant Major Charles T. McGuire, a member of Project DELTA, a Special Forces\nreconnaissance project.\n\nThe McGuire Rig was fashioned from a wide, long A7A nylon cargo tie-down strap\nwith a quick-fit buckle on one end. This was typically cut down to an length and\na web loop (wrist strap) attached near the top end. This was used to form a\nsling loop and attached to an over length of 5/8-inch nylon rope. Three ropes\nwith McGuire Rigs attached could be dropped from a UH-1 \"Huey\" helicopter, all\non the same side. A deployment pack containing a sandbag carried each rope to\nthe ground. A soldier attached his rucksack with a snap link, stepped into the\nloop, adjusted it, inserted his left hand in the wrist loop, and on signal the\nhelicopter lifted off. The three men would lock arms to prevent oscillation and\nprevent falls if a rope was shot through. A wounded or unconscious man could\nfall from the harness unless secured. The system did not allow the extracted\nsoldiers to be hoisted into the helicopter. They were flown out of the danger\narea and then set down in a clearing in order to board the helicopter. On a long\nflight the harness proved to be extremely uncomfortable.\n\nFrom the pilot's standpoint, performing an extraction using a McGuire Rig\nrequired intense concentration. Once the soldiers were in the rig, the pilot\nwould attempt to hover straight up. But with the nearest ground reference over\n100 feet away, it was difficult to discern when the chopper was moving. There\nwas the distinct possibility, therefore, that the soldier(s) would be dragged\nthrough tree limbs during the extraction.\n\nCPT John W. \"Jack\" Green, III, flying a UH-1B for the 145th Airlift Platoon in\nsupport of Project Delta was the first pilot to utilize the McGuire Rig in an\nemergency extraction. In mid-1966, 145th was blended into the 281st AHC which\nthen assumed the mission of supporting Project Delta. Due to intense training\nwith the MACV Recondo School and on the job training with Project Delta, the\n281st AHC became highly proficient in usage of the McGuire Rig.\n","linknr":84,"url":"McGuire_rig","recorded":1375088303,"links":["/w/index.php?title=McGuire_rig&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=McGuire_rig&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Vietnam","/wiki/STABO","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Project_DELTA","/w/index.php?title=McGuire_rig&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","http://www.vietnamgear.com/kit.aspx?kit=661","/wiki/File:Icon_vojn.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/Icon_vojn.svg/30px-Icon_vojn.svg.png","/wiki/Military","/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=McGuire_rig&action=edit","/wiki/Template:Mil-stub","/w/index.php?title=Template_talk:Mil-stub&action=edit&redlink=1","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Mil-stub&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=McGuire_rig&oldid=432632875","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Military_equipment_of_the_Vietnam_War","/wiki/Category:Military_stubs","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=McGuire+rig&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=McGuire+rig","/wiki/McGuire_rig","/wiki/Talk:McGuire_rig","#","/wiki/McGuire_rig","/w/index.php?title=McGuire_rig&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=McGuire_rig&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/McGuire_rig","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/McGuire_rig","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=McGuire_rig&oldid=432632875","/w/index.php?title=McGuire_rig&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6801517","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=McGuire_rig&id=432632875","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=McGuire+rig","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=McGuire+rig&oldid=432632875&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=McGuire_rig&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6801517#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/McGuire_rig","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Military equipment of the Vietnam War"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/Icon_vojn.svg/30px-Icon_vojn.svg.png","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Vietnam","STABO","Project_DELTA"]}
