{"cursor":"106987","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\nA 'placebo' ( ; Latin [[wikt:en:placebo#Latin|placÄbÅ]], \"I shall\nplease\" from [[wikt:en:placeo#Latin|placeÅ]], \"I please\") is a\nsimulated or otherwise medically ineffectual treatment for a disease or other\nmedical condition intended to deceive the recipient. Sometimes patients given a\nplacebo treatment will have a perceived or actual improvement in a medical\ncondition, a phenomenon commonly called the 'placebo effect'.\n\nIn medical research, placebos are given as control treatments and depend on the\nuse of measured deception. Common placebos include inert tablets, sham\nsurgery, and other procedures based on false\ninformation. However, placebos can also have a\nsurprisingly positive effect on a patient who knows that the given treatment is\nwithout any active drug, as compared with a control group who knowingly did not\nget a placebo.\n\nIn one common placebo procedure, however, a patient is given an inert pill, told\nthat it may improve his/her condition, but not told that it is in fact inert.\nSuch an intervention may cause the patient to believe the treatment will change\nhis/her condition; and this belief may produce a subjective perception of a\ntherapeutic effect, causing the patient to feel their condition has improved\n— or an actual improvement in their condition. This phenomenon is known as\nthe placebo effect.\n\nPlacebos are widely used in medical research and medicine,\nand the placebo effect is a pervasive phenomenon; in\nfact, it is part of the response to any active medical intervention. Archie Cochrane suggested in 1972 Cochrane, A.L.:\nEffectiveness and Efficiency: Random Reflections on Health Services. The\nNuffield Provincial Hospitals Trust 1972, p31. \"It is important to\ndistinguish the very respectable, conscious use of placebos. The effect of\nplacebos has been shown by randomized controlled trials to be very large. Their\nuse in the correct place is to be encouraged [â¦]\"\n\nThe placebo effect points to the importance of perception and the brain's role\nin physical health. However, the use of placebos as treatment in clinical\nmedicine (as opposed to laboratory research) is ethically problematic as it\nintroduces deception and dishonesty into the doctor-patient relationship. The United Kingdom Parliamentary Committee on Science and\nTechnology has stated that: \"...prescribing placebos... usually relies on some\ndegree of patient deception\" and \"prescribing pure placebos is bad medicine.\nTheir effect is unreliable and unpredictable and cannot form the sole basis of\nany treatment on the NHS.\"\n\nSince the publication of Henry K. Beecher's The Powerful Placebo  in 1955, the phenomenon has been considered to have\nclinically important effects. This view was notably\nchallenged when, in 2001, a systematic review of clinical trials concluded that\nthere was no evidence of clinically important effects, except perhaps in the\ntreatment of pain and continuous subjective outcomes. The\narticle received a flurry of criticism, but the authors\nlater published a Cochrane review with similar conclusions (updated ). Most studies have attributed the difference from\nbaseline till the end of the trial to a placebo effect, but the reviewers\nexamined studies which had both placebo and untreated groups in order to\ndistinguish the placebo effect from the natural progression of the disease. However these conclusions have been criticized because of the\ngreat variety of diseasesâmore than 40âin this metastudy. The effect of placebo\nis very different in different diseases. By pooling quite different diseases the\nresults can be leveled out.\n","linknr":1897,"url":"Placebo","recorded":1362505275,"links":69,"instances":["dentistry","pharmacy","mood","psychology","science","symptom","medicine","menopause","pharmaceutical","medicine","pharmacy","medicine","pharmacy"],"pdf":["http://www.ijpm.org/content/pdf/139/placebo.pdf","http://www.ijpm.org/content/pdf/139/placebo.pdf","http://www.humphrey.org.uk/papers/2002GreatExpectations.pdf","http://www.humphrey.org.uk/papers/2002GreatExpectations.pdf","http://www.psychosomaticmedicine.org/cgi/content/full/67/2/301.pdf","http://www.psychosomaticmedicine.org/cgi/content/full/67/2/301.pdf","http://content.nejm.org/cgi/reprint/341/24/1801.pdf","http://content.nejm.org/cgi/reprint/341/24/1801.pdf"],"categories":["Bioethics","Clinical
