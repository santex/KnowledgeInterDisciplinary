{"cursor":"2660","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Adolphe-Louis-FrÃ©dÃ©ric-ThÃ©odore Monod' (21 January 1802–6 April 1856),\nwas a French Protestant churchman. His elder brother was FrÃ©dÃ©ric Monod.\n\n\n\nHe was born in Copenhagen, where his father was pastor of the French church.\nEducated at Paris and Geneva, he began his life-work in 1825 as founder and\npastor of a Protestant church in Naples, moving to Lyon in 1827. Here his\nevangelical preaching, and especially a sermon on the duties of communicants\n(Qui doit communier?), led to his deposition by the Catholic Minister of\neducation and religion. Instead of leaving Lyon he began to preach in a hall and\nthen in a chapel.\n\nOn 2 September 1829 he married Hannah Honyman in Lyon. They had seven children.\n\nIn 1836 he took a professorship in the theological college of Montauban,\nremoving in 1847 to Paris as preacher at the Oratoire. He died there in 1856.\n\nMonod was undoubtedly the foremost Protestant preacher of 19th century France.\nHe published three volumes of sermons in 1830, another, La CrÃ©dulitÃ© de\nl'incrÃ©dule in 1844, and two more in 1855. Two further volumes appeared after\nhis death. One of his most influential books was the posthumous, Les Adieux\nd'Adolphe Monod Ã  ses Amis et Ã  l'Ãglise.\n","linknr":116,"url":"Adolphe_Monod","recorded":1362901129,"links":18,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["1802 births","1856 deaths","People from Copenhagen","French Calvinist theologians","French Calvinist clergy","19th-century Calvinist theologians"],"headings":["References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c4/AdolpheMonod.jpg/220px-AdolpheMonod.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/12px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["France","Protestant","Frédéric_Monod","Copenhagen","Paris,_France","Geneva","Naples","Lyon","Catholic","Montauban"]}
