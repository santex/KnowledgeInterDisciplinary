The first\nobject in this relation is said to 'refer to' the second object. The second\nobject â the one to which the first object refers â is called the 'referent' of\nthe first object.\n\nThe term reference is used in many spheres of human knowledge, adopting shades\nof meaning particular to the contexts in which it is used.\n\nReferences can take on many forms, including: a thought, a sensory perception\nthat is audible (onomatopoeia), visual (text), olfactory, or tactile, emotional\nstate, relationship with other, Treanor, Brian, Aspects of alterity:\nLevinas, Marcel, and the contemporary debate, Fordham University Press, 2006,\np.41 spacetime coordinate, symbolic or alpha-numeric, a physical object or\nan energy projection; but, other concrete and abstract contexts exist as methods\nof defining references within the scope of the various fields that require an\norigin, point of departure, or an original form. This includes methods that\nintentionally hide the reference from some observers, as in cryptography.\n\nThe following sections give specific usages of reference in different subjects.\n","linknr":573,"url":"Reference","recorded":1362892427,"links":37,"instances":["message","sense","grammar","patent","music","linguistics","grammar","surveying"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Reference","Semantics","Philosophical logic","Concepts in logic","Syntactic relationships","Meaning (philosophy of language)"],"headings":["Etymology","Computer science","Bibliographies","Library and information sciences","Encyclopedias & books of facts","Psychology","Economics and business","Education","Law","Semantics","Mathematics","Engineering","Arts","Literature and rhetoric","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["hearing","sense"],["reference","computer_science"],["reference","c++"],["letter","message"],["claim","patent"],["novelty","patent#united_states"],["antecedent","grammar"],["anaphora","linguistics"],["agent","grammar"],["benchmark","surveying"],["sampling","music"],["antecedent","grammar"]],"members":["letter","hearing","antecedent","claim","sampling","novelty","anaphora","reference","agent","benchmark"],"related":["Hearing_(sense)","Onomatopoeia","Visual_perception","Olfaction","Emotions","Spacetime","Symbolic_system","Alpha-numeric_grid","Cryptography","Middle_English","Middle_French","Latin","Prefix","Referee","Referendum","Knowledge","Matter","Energy","Computer_science","Reference_(computer_science)","Data_type","Data_structure","Linked_list","Programming_language","C++","Reference_(C++)","Database_theory","Referential_integrity","Reference_work","Library","Dictionary","Encyclopedia","Reference_work","Library_circulation","International_Standard_Book_Number","Digital_object_identifier","Internet","Uniform_Resource_Identifier","Reference_interview","Library_reference_desk","Virtual_reference","Digital_reference_services","Reference_work","Self-reference","Labour_economics","Recommendation_letter","Letter_(message)","Telephone","Terms_of_reference","Project","Committee","Meeting","Negotiation","Project_charter","Public_procurement","Tender_offer","Reference_management_software","Bibliography","Footnote","Plagiarism","Diary","Citation","Validity","Bibliography","Patent","Claim_(patent)","Invention","Inventive_step_and_non-obviousness","Doctor_of_Philosophy","Canadian_law","Reference_question","Supreme_Court_of_Canada","Semantics","Noun","Pronoun","Word","Denotation","Exemplification","Antecedent_(grammar)","Gottlob_Frege","Hesperus","Phosphorus","Venus","Sense_and_reference","Secondary_reference","Bo-Peep","Hercules","God","Judaism","Names_of_God_in_Judaism","Linguistic_sign","Anaphora_(linguistics)","Pronoun","Agent_(grammar)","Geometry","Frame_of_reference","Benchmark_(surveying)","Reference_design","Art","Sampling_(music)","Academic_publishing","Footnote","Antecedent_(grammar)","Exemplification","Generic_antecedent","Hyperlink","Indexicality","ISO_690"]}
