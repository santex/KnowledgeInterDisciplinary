This similarity can be in appearance,\nbehaviour, sound, scent and location, with the mimics found in similar places to\ntheir models.\n\nMimicry occurs when a group of organisms, This 'group' is often a species,\nbut can also be a subgroup such as one particular sex or morph the mimics,\nevolve to share common perceived characteristics with another group, the\nmodels. In its broadest definition mimicry can include non-living\nmodels. The evolution is driven by the selective action of a signal-\nreceiver, or dupe, such as birds that use sight\nto identify palatable insects (the mimics), whilst avoiding the noxious models.\n\nCollectively, this situation is known as a mimicry complex. The model is usually another species except in cases of automimicry. The\nsignal-receiver is typically another intermediate organism like the common\npredator of two species, but may actually be the model itself, such as a moth\nresembling its spider predator. (includes video) As an interaction,\nmimicry is in most cases advantageous to the mimic and harmful to the receiver,\nbut may increase, reduce or have no effect on the fitness of the model depending\non the situation. Models themselves are difficult to define in some cases, for\nexample eye spots may not bear resemblance to any specific organism's eyes, and\ncamouflage often cannot be attributed to a particular model.\n\n mimics a leaf (mimesis)|alt=Photo of green-coloured insect on dark tree\n branch]] Camouflage, in which a species resembles its surroundings, is\n essentially a form of visual mimicry. In between camouflage and mimicry is\n 'mimesis', in which the mimic takes on the properties of a specific object or\n organism, but one to which the dupe is indifferent. The\n lack of a true distinction between the two phenomena can be seen in animals\n that resemble twigs, bark, leaves or flowers, in that they are often classified\n as camouflaged (a plant constitutes its \"surroundings\"), but are sometimes\n classified as mimics (a plant is also an organism). p51 Crypsis is a broader concept which encompasses\n all forms of avoiding detection, such as mimicry, camouflage, hiding etc. Ruxton G.D. Sherratt T.N. and Speed M.P. 2004. Avoiding attack:\n the evolutionary ecology of crypsis, warning signals, and mimicry.\n Oxford.\n\nThough visual mimicry is most obvious to humans, other senses such as olfaction\n(smell) or hearing may be involved, and more than one type of signal may be\nemployed. Mimicry may involve morphology, behavior,\nand other properties. In any case, the signal always functions to deceive the\nreceiver by preventing it from correctly identifying the mimic. In evolutionary\nterms, this phenomenon is a form of co-evolution usually involving an\nevolutionary arms race. p161 It should not be\nconfused with convergent evolution, which occurs when species come to resemble\none another independently by adapting to similar lifestyles.\n\nMimics may have different models for different life cycle stages, or they may be\npolymorphic, with different individuals imitating different models. Models\nthemselves may have more than one mimic, though frequency dependent selection\nfavors mimicry where models outnumber mimics. Models tend to be relatively\nclosely related organisms, but mimicry of vastly different\nspecies is also known. Most known mimics are insects,\nthough many other animal mimics including mammals are known. Plants and fungi\nmay also be mimics, though less research has been carried out in this\narea.
