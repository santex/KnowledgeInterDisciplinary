Article Begins Here -->\n\nThe 'Thoroughbred' is a horse breed best known for its use in horse racing.\nAlthough the word thoroughbred is sometimes used to refer to any breed of\npurebred horse, it technically refers only to the Thoroughbred breed.\nThoroughbreds are considered \"hot-blooded\" horses, known for their agility,\nspeed and spirit.\n\nThe Thoroughbred as it is known today was developed in 17th- and 18th-century\nEngland, when native mares were crossbred with imported Oriental stallions of\nArabian, Barb, and Turkoman breeding. All modern Thoroughbreds can trace their\npedigrees to three stallions originally imported into England in the 17th\ncentury and 18th century, and to a larger number of foundation mares of mostly\nEnglish breeding. During the 18th and 19th centuries, the Thoroughbred breed\nspread throughout the world; they were imported into North America starting in\n1730 and into Australia, Europe, Japan and South America during the 19th\ncentury. Millions of Thoroughbreds exist today, and more than 118,000&nbsp;foals\nare registered each year worldwide.\n\nThoroughbreds are used mainly for racing, but are also bred for other riding\ndisciplines such as show jumping, combined training, dressage, polo, and fox\nhunting. They are also commonly crossbred to create new breeds or to improve\nexisting ones, and have been influential in the creation of the Quarter Horse,\nStandardbred, Anglo-Arabian, and various warmblood breeds.\n\nThoroughbred racehorses perform with maximum exertion, which has resulted in\nhigh accident rates and health problems such as bleeding from the lungs. Other\nhealth concerns include low fertility, abnormally small hearts and a small hoof\nto body mass ratio. There are several theories for the reasons behind the\nprevalence of accidents and health problems in the Thoroughbred breed, and\nresearch is ongoing.\n",
