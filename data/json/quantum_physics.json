      "text" : "\n\n\n'Quantum mechanics' (QM – also known as 'quantum physics', or 'quantum theory')\nis a branch of physics which deals with physical phenomena at microscopic\nscales, where the action is on the order of the Planck constant. Quantum\nmechanics departs from classical mechanics primarily at the [[quantum realm]] of\natomic and subatomic length scales. Quantum mechanics provides a mathematical\ndescription of much of the dual particle-like and wave-like behavior and\ninteractions of energy and matter.\n\nIn advanced topics of quantum mechanics, some of these behaviors are macroscopic\nand emerge at only extreme (i.e., very low or very high) energies or\ntemperatures. The name quantum mechanics derives from the observation that some\nphysical quantities can change only in discrete amounts (Latin\n[[quantum|quanta]]), and not in a continuous (cf. analog) way. For example, the\nangular momentum of an electron bound to an atom or molecule is\nquantized.<ref>The angular momentum of an unbound electron, in contrast, is not\nquantized.</ref> In the context of quantum mechanics, the wave–particle duality\nof energy and matter and the uncertainty principle provide a unified view of the\nbehavior of photons, electrons, and other atomic-scale objects.\n\nThe mathematical formulations of quantum mechanics are abstract. A mathematical\nfunction known as the wavefunction provides information about the probability\namplitude of position, momentum, and other physical properties of a particle.\nMathematical manipulations of the wavefunction usually involve the bra-ket\nnotation, which requires an understanding of complex numbers and linear\nfunctionals. The wavefunction treats the object as a quantum harmonic\noscillator, and the mathematics is akin to that describing acoustic resonance.\nMany of the results of quantum mechanics are not easily visualized in terms of\nclassical mechanics—for instance, the ground state in a quantum mechanical model\nis a non-zero energy state that is the lowest permitted energy state of a\nsystem, as opposed to a more \"traditional\" system that is thought of as simply\nbeing at rest, with zero kinetic energy. Instead of a traditional static,\nunchanging zero state, quantum mechanics allows for far more dynamic, chaotic\npossibilities, according to John Wheeler.\n\nThe earliest versions of quantum mechanics were formulated in the first decade\nof the 20th century. At around the same time, the atomic theory and the\ncorpuscular theory of light (as updated by Einstein) first came to be widely\naccepted as scientific fact; these latter theories can be viewed as quantum\ntheories of matter and electromagnetic radiation, respectively. Early quantum\ntheory was significantly reformulated in the mid-1920s by Werner Heisenberg,\nMax Born and Pascual Jordan, who created matrix mechanics; Louis de Broglie and\nErwin Schrödinger (Wave Mechanics); and Wolfgang Pauli and Satyendra Nath Bose\n(statistics of subatomic particles). And the Copenhagen interpretation of Niels\nBohr became widely accepted. By 1930, quantum mechanics had been further\nunified and formalized by the work of David Hilbert, Paul Dirac and John von\nNeumann,<ref></ref> with a greater emphasis placed on measurement in quantum\nmechanics, the statistical nature of our knowledge of reality, and\nphilosophical speculation about the role of the observer. Quantum mechanics has\nsince branched out into almost every aspect of 20th century physics and other\ndisciplines, such as quantum chemistry, quantum electronics, quantum optics,\nand quantum information science. Much 19th century physics has been re-\nevaluated as the \"classical limit\" of quantum mechanics, and its more advanced\ndevelopments in terms of quantum field theory, string theory, and speculative\nquantum gravity theories.\n",
