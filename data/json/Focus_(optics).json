{"cursor":"3846","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nIn geometrical optics, a 'focus', also called an 'image point', is the point\nwhere light rays originating from a point on the object converge.\nAlthough the focus is conceptually a point, physically the focus has a spatial\nextent, called the [[Circle_of_confusion|blur circle]]. This non-ideal focusing\nmay be caused by aberrations of the imaging optics. In the absence of\nsignificant aberrations, the smallest possible blur circle is the Airy disc,\nwhich is caused by diffraction from the optical system's aperture. Aberrations\ntend to get worse as the aperture diameter increases, while the Airy circle is\nsmallest for large apertures.\n\nAn image, or image point or region, is 'in focus' if light from object points is\nconverged almost as much as possible in the image, and 'out of focus' if light\nis not well converged. The border between these is sometimes defined using a\ncircle of confusion criterion.\n\nA 'principal focus' or 'focal point' is a special focus: *For a lens, or a\nspherical or parabolic mirror, it is a point onto which collimated light\nparallel to the axis is focused. Since light can pass through a lens in either\ndirection, a lens has two focal pointsâ€”one on each side. The distance in\nair from the lens or mirror's principal plane to the focus is called the [[focal\nlength]]. *Elliptical mirrors have two focal points: light that passes through\none of these before striking the mirror is reflected such that it passes through\nthe other. *The focus of a hyperbolic mirror is either of two points which have\nthe property that light from one is reflected as if it came from the other.\n\n of glasses, which was rendered in POV-Ray.]] A diverging (negative) lens, or a\n convex mirror, does not focus a collimated beam to a point. Instead, the focus\n is the point from which the light appears to be emanating, after it travels\n through the lens or reflects from the mirror. A convex parabolic mirror will\n reflect a beam of collimated light to make it appear as if it were radiating\n from the focal point, or conversely, reflect rays directed toward the focus as\n a collimated beam. A convex elliptical mirror will reflect light directed\n towards one focus as if it were radiating from the other focus, both of which\n are behind the mirror. A convex hyperbolic mirror will reflect rays emanating\n from the focal point in front of the mirror as if they were emanating from the\n focal point behind the mirror. Conversely, it can focus rays directed at the\n focal point that is behind the mirror towards the focal point that is in front\n of the mirror as in a Cassegrain telescope.\n","linknr":154,"url":"Focus_(optics)","recorded":1362667596,"links":45,"instances":["optics","geometry","optics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Concepts in physics","Geometrical optics","Physical optics","Science of photography"],"headings":["See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/DOF-ShallowDepthofField.jpg/220px-DOF-ShallowDepthofField.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ec/Glasses_800_edit.png/300px-Glasses_800_edit.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["lens","optics"],["focus","geometry"],["focus","geometry"],["cardinal_point","optics"],["focus","geometry"]],"members":["cardinal_point","focus","lens"],"related":["Geometrical_optics","Light_ray","Optical_aberration","Airy_disc","Diffraction","Aperture","Circle_of_confusion","Lens_(optics)","Sphere","Parabola","Mirror","Collimated_light","Principal_plane","Ellipse","Hyperbola","POV-Ray","Convex_mirror","Focus_(geometry)","Hyperbola","Focus_(geometry)","Cassegrain_reflector","Autofocus","Cardinal_point_(optics)","Defocus_aberration","Depth_of_field","Depth_of_focus","Far_point","Focus_(geometry)","Fixed_focus","Bokeh","Focus_stacking","Focal_Plane"]}
