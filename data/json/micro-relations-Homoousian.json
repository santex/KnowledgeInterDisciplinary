{"cursor":"11185","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Homoousian' ( ; , from the , homÃ³s, \"same\" and , ousÃ­a, \"essence, being\") is a\ntechnical theological term used in discussion of the Christian understanding of\nGod as Trinity. The Nicene Creed describes Jesus as being homooÃºsios with God\nthe Father — that is, they are of the \"same substance\" and are equally\nGod. This term, adopted by the First Council of Nicaea, was intended to add\nclarity to the relationship between Christ and God the Father within the\nGodhead. The term is rendered \"[[consubstantial]]is\" in Latin and in related\nterms in other Latin-derived languages. It is one of the cornerstones of\ntheology in all Churches that adhere to the Nicene Creed.\n","linknr":462,"url":"Homoousian","recorded":1362689041,"links":25,"instances":["christianity","protestant","religion","gnosticism"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Religious philosophy","Trinitarianism","Christian terms","Hellenism and Christianity"],"headings":["Pre-Nicene use of the term","Adoption of the term in the Nicene Creed","See also","Notes","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["godhead","christianity"],["syzygy","gnosticism"],["mainline","protestant"],["transcendence","religion"]],"members":["godhead","mainline","transcendence","syzygy"],"related":["Christian","Trinity","Nicene_Creed","God_the_Father","God","First_Council_of_Nicaea","Christ","God_the_Father","Godhead_(Christianity)","Latin","Nicene_Creed","Theology","Gnostics","Emanation","Syzygy_(Gnosticism)","Basilides","Hippolytus_of_Rome","Miroslav_Marcovich","Ptolemy","Epiphanius_of_Salamis","Heresiologists","Nicene_Creed","Roman_Catholic_Church","Eastern_Orthodox_Church","Oriental_Orthodox","Anglican_Church","Lutheran","Reformed","Evangelical_Christianity","Mainline_(Protestant)","Ontology","Origen","Pamphilus_of_Caesarea","Eusebius","Nicene_Christianity","Jesus_Christ","Logos","Supreme_Being","Consubstantiality","Ousia","Trinitarianism","Arian_controversy","Arianism","First_Council_of_Nicaea","Homoiousian","Homoean","Transcendence_(religion)","Holy_Spirit","Heteroousianism","Anomoeanism","Athanasius","First_Council_of_Constantinople","Athanasius_of_Alexandria","First_Council_of_Nicaea","Sabellianism","Semi-Arians","Sabellius","Nicene_Creed","First_Council_of_Nicaea","Athanasius","Arius","Sabellius","Homoiousian"]}
