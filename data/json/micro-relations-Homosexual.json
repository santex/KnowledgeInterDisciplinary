As an orientation, homosexuality\nrefers to \"an enduring pattern of or disposition to experience sexual,\naffectionate, or romantic attractions\" primarily or exclusively to people of the\nsame sex. \"It also refers to an individual's sense of personal and social\nidentity based on those attractions, behaviors expressing them, and membership\nin a community of others who share them.\"\n\nHomosexuality is one of the three main categories of sexual orientation, along\nwith bisexuality and heterosexuality, within the heterosexual-homosexual\ncontinuum (with asexuality sometimes considered a fourth). Scientific and\nmedical understanding is that sexual orientation is not a choice, but rather a\ncomplex interplay of biological and environmental factors, especially with regard to early\nuterine environment.

Prejudice and\ndiscrimination against homosexual and bisexual people, however, have been shown\nto cause significant psychological harm, and is especially damaging to gay\nchildren.\n\nThe most common terms for homosexual people are [[lesbian]] for females and\n[[gay]] for males, though gay is also used to refer generally to both homosexual\nmales and females. The number of people who identify as gay or lesbianâand the\nproportion of people who have same-sex sexual experiencesâare difficult for\nresearchers to estimate reliably for a variety of reasons, including many gay\npeople not openly identifying as such due to homophobia and heterosexist\ndiscrimination.
