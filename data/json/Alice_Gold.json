{"cursor":"5787","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Alice Gold' (Alice McLaughlin) is an English singer-songwriter based in London,\nformerly signed to Sunday Best and currently signed to\nFiction Records.\n\n\n\nGold lives on her 53-foot narrowboat with her husband, film producer Jules\nCocke, in north Londonâs canal boat community, where she recorded many demos.\n\n\"Like many an adventurer with wanderlust, Alice spent some of her early twenties\ntraveling South East Asia with her trusty battered guitar, continually gathering\ninspiration and song ideas, before finding herself in Edinburgh. There she\nunderwent a period of experimentation, collaborating with various lights on the\nmusic scene. She moved to London to pursue her ambitions, but the death of her\nmother precipitated an intense period of loss and grief, culminating in a need\nto escape the grind of city life. Alice took a trip to America, ambling around\nthe Deep South, en route to San Francisco, with little more than her wits and\nthat battered old guitar again, in a 1979 Dodge Winnebago. On the way she found\ncourage, independence and freedom, all key in developing her own unique style\nand sound.\" http://batteryinyourleg.com/blog/2007/09/25/introducing-alice-\nmclaughlin/\n\nHer debut single \"Dolly Figured\" was released under her original name on 21\nOctober 2007.\n\nHer debut single as Alice Gold, \"Orbiter\", was released on 23 September 2010\nthrough Pure Groove Records, with a single launch party at The Drop in Stoke\nNewington. [[The Guardian]] said it \"showcases Gold's mighty voice through its\npower-pop chorus\" and described her as \"One to watch\".\n\nThis was followed by \"Runaway Love\", released on Fiction Records, which\nhas received airplay on radio stations across the UK, entering the A-List\non BBC Radio 2. On the official release date, 18 April 2011, an acoustic\nEP was recorded live at Toerag Studios where The White Stripes have\npreviously recorded.\n\nGold's debut album Seven Rainbows, released on 4 July 2011, was produced by Dan\nCarey (Franz Ferdinand, Hot Chip, Lily Allen). In an\ninterview with PopCultureMonster.com she said of the album, \"the main bass,\ndrums and guitars rhythm tracks were all recorded live and on tape like the old\n60s records. The over-dubs are mostly made up of one-takes, whether it be guitar\nor vocal takes. My producer Dan Carey and I decided that if a take felt good\nthen weâd keep it, so it is complete with minor âmistakesâ and quirky sounds\nthrough doing that, which we both like. Its a very honest album, quite\nautobiographical. The songs were born from a lot of darkness and grief but the\nlyrics are drenched in hope because of that, which is why I imagine people\nconnect to it.\"\n\nIn October 2010, Gold was shortlisted for [[Q (magazine)|Q]] magazine's 'Next\nBig Thing' award.\n\nIn September 2011, Gold's cover of the Billy Fury song \"Wondrous Place\" was used\nin an advert for the British beer brand Carling.\n\nShe has toured with Eels, Athlete, Band Of Skulls, Noah And The Whale, and The\nTwilight Singers, and has upcoming tour support slots confirmed with The Dears\nand The Bookhouse Boys.\n\nGold also played festivals in 2011, including Glastonbury, V Festival, T in the\nPark, Harvest at Jimmy's Festival, Jodrell Bank Live, Kendal Calling, Cornbury\nFestival and Hull's Freedom Festival.\n","linknr":148,"url":"Alice_Gold","recorded":1375081717,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Alice_Gold&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Alice_Gold&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/English_people","/wiki/Singer-songwriter","#cite_note-dolly-1","#cite_note-2","/wiki/File:Alice_Gold_Guilfest_2011.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7e/Alice_Gold_Guilfest_2011.jpg/220px-Alice_Gold_Guilfest_2011.jpg","/wiki/File:Alice_Gold_Guilfest_2011.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/w/index.php?title=Jules_Cocke&action=edit&redlink=1","#cite_note-3","#cite_note-dolly-1","/wiki/Stoke_Newington","/wiki/The_Guardian","#cite_note-4","/wiki/Fiction_Records","/wiki/BBC_Radio_2","/wiki/The_White_Stripes","/wiki/Franz_Ferdinand_(band)","/wiki/Hot_Chip","/wiki/Lily_Allen","#cite_note-FF-5","#cite_note-6","/wiki/Q_(magazine)","#cite_note-FF-5","/wiki/Billy_Fury","/wiki/Wondrous_Place","/wiki/Carling","#cite_note-7","/wiki/Eels","/wiki/Athlete_(band)","/wiki/Band_Of_Skulls","/wiki/Noah_And_The_Whale","/wiki/The_Twilight_Singers","/wiki/The_Dears","#cite_note-8","/wiki/Glastonbury","/wiki/V_Festival","/wiki/T_in_the_Park","/wiki/Kendal_Calling","/wiki/Freedom_Festival,_Hull","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","#Discography","#Albums","#Singles","#Featured_artist","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Alice_Gold&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Alice_Gold&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=Alice_Gold&action=edit&section=3","/w/index.php?title=Alice_Gold&action=edit&section=4","/wiki/Sub_Focus","/w/index.php?title=Alice_Gold&action=edit&section=5","#cite_ref-dolly_1-0","#cite_ref-dolly_1-1","http://www.sundaybest.net/site/releases/detail.php?articleId=476","#cite_ref-2","http://fictionrecords.co.uk/alice-gold/","#cite_ref-3","http://batteryinyourleg.com/blog/2007/09/25/introducing-alice-mclaughlin/","#cite_ref-4","http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2010/sep/26/popandrock","#cite_ref-FF_5-0","#cite_ref-FF_5-1","http://www.femalefirst.co.uk/music/popmusic/Alice+Gold+Runaway+Love-15524.html","#cite_ref-6","http://popculturemonster.com/index.php/2010/interview-with-alice-gold/","#cite_ref-7","http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Tst_bB-Mi4","#cite_ref-8","http://www.aaamusic.co.uk/2011/03/18/alice-gold-debute-single-and-shows-with-the-twilight-singers-and-the-dears/","/w/index.php?title=Alice_Gold&action=edit&section=6","http://alicegoldmusic.tumblr.com","http://www.alicegold.com","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alice_Gold&oldid=541337704","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Living_people","/wiki/Category:English_singer-songwriters","/wiki/Category:All_articles_with_unsourced_statements","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_unsourced_statements_from_November_2011","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/wiki/Category:Articles_created_via_the_Article_Wizard","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Alice+Gold&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Alice+Gold","/wiki/Alice_Gold","/wiki/Talk:Alice_Gold","#","/wiki/Alice_Gold","/w/index.php?title=Alice_Gold&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Alice_Gold&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Alice_Gold","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Alice_Gold","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Alice_Gold&oldid=541337704","/w/index.php?title=Alice_Gold&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4725884","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Alice_Gold&id=541337704","
