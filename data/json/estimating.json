Kent,\n\"Estimation\", Data Construction and Data Analysis for Survey Research (2001), p.\n157.</ref> The sample provides information that can be projected, through\nvarious formal or informal processes, to determine a range most likely to\ndescribe the missing information. An estimate that turns out to be incorrect\nwill be an 'overestimate' if the estimate exceeded the actual result, and an\n'underestimate' if the estimate fell short of the actual result.\n","title":"Estimation","headings":["How estimation is done","Uses of estimation","See also","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["2: Approximation","2: Estimation_theory","1: Uncertainty","1: Instability","1: Statistic","1: Information","1: Opinion_poll","1: Survey_methodology","1: Point_estimate","1: Interval_estimate","1: Approximation_theory","1: Estimator","1: Signal_processing","1: Forecasting","1: Prediction","1: Fermi_problem","1: Business","1: Economics","1: Guesstimate","1: Estimated_sign","1: Conjecture","1: Cost_estimation"]}
