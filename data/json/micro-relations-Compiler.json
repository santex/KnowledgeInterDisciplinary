{"cursor":"32305","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\nA 'compiler' is a computer program (or set of programs) that transforms source\ncode written in a programming language (the source language) into another\ncomputer language (the target language, often having a binary form known as\n[[object code]]). The most common reason for wanting to transform source code is\nto create an executable program.\n\nThe name \"compiler\" is primarily used for programs that translate source code\nfrom a high-level programming language to a lower level language (e.g., assembly\nlanguage or machine code). If the compiled program can run on a computer whose\nCPU or operating system is different from the one on which the compiler runs,\nthe compiler is known as a cross-compiler. A program that translates from a low\nlevel language to a higher level one is a [[decompiler]]. A program that\ntranslates between high-level languages is usually called a [[translator\n(computing)|language translator]], source to source translator, or language\nconverter. A language [[rewriting|rewriter]] is usually a program that\ntranslates the form of expressions without a change of language.\n\nA compiler is likely to perform many or all of the following operations: lexical\nanalysis, preprocessing, parsing, semantic analysis (Syntax-directed\ntranslation), code generation, and code optimization.\n\nProgram faults caused by incorrect compiler behavior can be very difficult to\ntrack down and work around; therefore, compiler implementors invest significant\neffort to ensure the correctness of their software.\n\nThe term compiler-compiler is sometimes used to refer to a parser generator, a\ntool often used to help create the lexer and parser.\n","linknr":470,"url":"Compiler","recorded":1362671087,"links":86,"instances":["computing","disambiguation","complexity","computing","computer_scientist","programming_language","compilers","computing","computing","programming_language","programming_languages","programming_language","programming_language","programming_language","computing","syntax","computer_science","compiler"],"pdf":["http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cae.20566/pdf","http://www.research.ibm.com/journal/rd/255/ibmrd2505Q.pdf","http://www.cs.mdx.ac.uk/staffpages/r_bornat/books/compiling.pdf"],"categories":["American
