{"cursor":"17834","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n of DNA.]]\n\n\n\n'Self-replication' is any behavior of a dynamical system that yields\nconstruction of an identical copy of itself. Biological cells, given suitable\nenvironments, reproduce by cell division. During cell division, DNA is\nreplicated and can be transmitted to offspring during reproduction. Biological\nviruses can reproduce, but only by commandeering the reproductive machinery of\ncells through a process of infection. Harmful prion proteins can replicate by\nconverting normal prions into rogue\nforms. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/8435320.stm 'Lifeless' prion\nproteins are 'capable of evolution'] Computer viruses reproduce using the\nhardware and software already present on computers. Self-replication in robotics\nhas been an area of research and a subject of interest in science fiction. Any\nself-replicating mechanism which does not make a perfect copy will result in the\ncreation of different variants and thus be subject to natural selection as the\nvariants which are better at persisting in their environment will outlive and\noutreproduce variants which are not so suited to their environment.\n","linknr":277,"url":"Self-replication","recorded":1362371985,"links":25,"instances":["computing","geometry","programming_language","process","biology","nanotechnology","business","brand","biology","economics","economics"],"pdf":["http://www.niac.usra.edu/files/studies/final_report/883Toth-Fejel.pdf","http://www.niac.usra.edu/files/studies/final_report/pdf/883Toth-Fejel.pdf"],"categories":["Artificial life","Biological processes","Nanotechnology"],"headings":["Overview","Mechanical self-replication","Fields involving study of self-replication","Self-replication in industry","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e4/DNA_chemical_structure.svg/200px-DNA_chemical_structure.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Self-replication_of_sphynx_hexidiamonds.svg/246px-Self-replication_of_sphynx_hexidiamonds.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5d/Advanced_Automation_for_Space_Missions_figure_5-29.gif/220px-Advanced_Automation_for_Space_Missions_figure_5-29.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cell","biology"],["virus","biology"],["quine","computing"],["python","programming_language"],["congruence","geometry"],["labour","economics"],["capital","economics"],["distribution","business"],["pentium","brand"],["assembler","nanotechnology"],["assembler","nanotechnology"],["molding","process"],["assembler","nanotechnology"]],"members":["quine","congruence","python","molding","virus","assembler","distribution","pentium","cell","labour","capital"],"related":["DNA","Dynamical_system","Cell_(biology)","Cell_division","DNA","Reproduction","Virus_(biology)","Prion","Computer_virus","Robotics","Science_fiction","Natural_selection","John_von_Neumann","Replicator","Crystal","Autotroph","Robert_Freitas","Ralph_Merkle","Computer_science","Quine_(computing)","Python_(programming_language)","Geometry","Congruence_(geometry)","Tessellation","Hexiamond","Pentagon","Concave_polygon","Solomon_W._Golomb","Rep-tiles","Labour_(economics)","Capital_(economics)","Distribution_(business)","Factory","NASA","Clanking_replicator","Intel","Pentium_(brand)","Compiler","Chicken_and_egg","Phenotype","Source_code","Genotype","Mutation","Nanotechnology","Assembler_(nanotechnology)","Grey_goo","Armageddon","Foresight_Institute","Broadcast_architecture","Mass_production","Biology","Meme","Virus","Virus","Nanotechnology","Molecular_nanotechnology","Nanotechnology","Assembler_(nanotechnology)","Computer_security","Computer_worm","Computer_virus","Parallel_computing","Computer_cluster","Distributed_computing","Mobile_agent","Autotroph","Von_Neumann_Probe","NASA","Robert_Freitas","Regolith","Chlorine","Aluminium","Robot","Solar_cell","Casting","Robot","Plaster","Molding_(process)","Basalt","Electricity","Oven","Nanotechnology","Assembler_(nanotechnology)","Nanometer","Molecular_manufacturing","Lego","Protein_biosynthesis","RNA","Alternative_biochemistry","Artificial_life","Astrochicken","Autopoiesis","Complex_system","DNA_replication","Life","Robot","RepRap","Self-replicating_machine","Self-replicating_spacecraft","Space_manufacturing","Universal_Constructor","Virus","Von_Neumann_machine","Self_reconfigurable","Final_Anthropic_Principle","Positive_feedback","Harmonic","Robert_Freitas","Robert_Freitas","Ralph_Merkle","Douglas_Hofstadter"]}
