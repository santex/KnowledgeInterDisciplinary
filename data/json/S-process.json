{"cursor":"14681","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nThe 's-process' or slow-neutron-capture-process is a nucleosynthesis process\nthat occurs at relatively low neutron density and intermediate temperature\nconditions in stars. Under these conditions heavier nuclei are created by\nneutron capture, increasing the atomic weight of the nucleus by one. A neutron\nin the new nucleus decays by beta-minus decay to a proton, creating a nucleus of\nhigher atomic number. The rate of neutron capture by atomic nuclei is slow\nrelative to the rate of radioactive beta-minus decay, hence the name. This\nprocess produces stable isotopes by moving along the valley of beta-decay stable\nisobars in the chart of isotopes. The S-process produces approximately half of\nthe isotopes of the elements heavier than iron, and therefore plays an important\nrole in the galactic chemical evolution. The more rapid R-process differs from\nthe S-process by its faster rate of neutron capture of more than one neutron\nbefore beta-decay takes place.\n","linknr":485,"url":"S-process","recorded":1362512964,"links":30,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Nuclear physics","Neutron","Astrophysics","Nucleosynthesis"],"headings":["History","The S-process in stars","The S-process measured in stardust","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4e/S-process-elem-Ag-to-Sb.svg/400px-S-process-elem-Ag-to-Sb.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5f/He1523a.jpg/15px-He1523a.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Slow_neutron","Nucleosynthesis","Star","Neutron_capture","Beta_decay","Atomic_nucleus","Beta-decay_stable_isobars","Table_of_nuclides","Heavy_metals","Nucleosynthesis","S-process","Abundance_of_the_chemical_elements","Hans_Suess","Harold_Urey","Strontium","Barium","Lead","Quantum_mechanics","Nuclear_shell_model","Noble_gas","Inert","Neutron_capture","R-process","B2FH_paper","Red_giant","Technetium","B2FH","Donald_D._Clayton","Asymptotic_Giant_Branch","Asymptotic_giant_branch","Mass_number","Neutron","Iron","Neutron_source","Antimony","Strontium","Yttrium","Lead","Asymptotic_Giant_Branch","S-process_element","Helium_fusion","Carbon-burning_process","Neutron_flux","Thorium","Uranium","Beta_decay","Alpha_decay","Neutron","Alpha_particle","Electron","Neutrino","Gamma_ray","Cosmic_dust","Presolar_grains","Presolar_grains"]}
