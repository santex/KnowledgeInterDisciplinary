{"cursor":"16260","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" nonmetals are placed in the p-block.]] 'Nonmetal', or 'non-metal', is a term\n used in chemistry when classifying the chemical elements. On the basis of their\n general physical and chemical properties, every element in the periodic table\n can be termed either a metal or a nonmetal. (A few elements with intermediate\n properties are referred to as metalloids).\n\nThe elements generally regarded as nonmetals are:\n* In Group 1: hydrogen (H) (The only nonmetal in this group)\n* In Group 14: carbon (C) (Again, the only nonmetal in this group)\n* In Group 15: (the pnictogens): nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P)\n* In Group 16: (the chalcogens): oxygen (O), sulfur (S), selenium (Se)\n* In Group 17: (the halogens): fluorine (F), chlorine (Cl), bromine (Br), iodine\n  (I), astatine ( At )\n* All elements (with the possible exception of ununoctium) in Group 18 â the\n  noble gases \n\nThere is no rigorous definition for the term \"nonmetal\" â it covers a general\nspectrum of behaviour. Common properties considered characteristic of a\nnonmetal include:\n* poor conductors of heat and electricity when compared to metals\n* they form acidic oxides (whereas metals generally form basic oxides)\n* in solid form, they are dull and brittle, rather than metals which are\n  lustrous, ductile or malleable\n* usually have lower densities than metals\n* they have significantly lower melting points and boiling points than metals\n  (with the exception of carbon)\n* non-metals have high electronegativity\n\nOnly eighteen elements in the periodic table are generally considered nonmetals,\ncompared to over eighty metals, but nonmetals make up most of the crust,\natmosphere and oceans of the earth. Bulk tissues of living organisms are\ncomposed almost entirely of nonmetals. Most nonmetals are monatomic noble gases\nor form diatomic molecules in their elemental state, unlike metals which (in\ntheir elemental state) do not form molecules at all.\n","linknr":669,"url":"Nonmetal","recorded":1362477463,"links":94,"instances":["chemistry","mineralogy"],"pdf":["http://users-phys.au.dk/nec/Papers/necPRB2/PRB3812864.pdf","http://users-phys.au.dk/nec/Papers/necPRB2/PRB3812864.pdf","http://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/docs/00/22/43/76/PDF/ajp-jphyscol198445C874.pdf","http://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/docs/00/22/43/76/PDF/ajp-jphyscol198445C874.pdf","http://www.orc.soton.ac.uk/publications/theses/1390T_pp/1390T_Chap4.pdf","http://www.orc.soton.ac.uk/publications/theses/1390T_pp/1390T_Chap4.pdf"],"categories":["Nonmetals|*","Periodic table"],"headings":["Metallic allotropes","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/84/Periodic_table.svg/350px-Periodic_table.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Symbol_book_class2.svg/16px-Symbol_book_class2.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg/16px-Portal-puzzle.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["base","chemistry"],["lustre","mineralogy"]],"members":["base","lustre"],"related":["P-block","Chemistry","Chemical_element","Periodic_table","Metal","Metalloid","Hydrogen","Carbon","Pnictogens","Nitrogen","Phosphorus","Chalcogens","Oxygen","Sulfur","Selenium","Halogens","Fluorine","Chlorine","Bromine","Iodine","Astatine","Ununoctium","Noble_gas","Heat","Electrical_conductivity","Acid","Oxide","Base_(chemistry)","Brittle","Lustre_(mineralogy)","Ductile","Malleable","Density","Melting_point","Boiling_point","Carbon","Electronegativity","Earth","Organism","Monatomic","Diatomic_molecule","Allotrope","Hydrogen","Metallic_hydrogen","Molecular_hydrogen","Helium","Mbar","Boron","Allotropes_of_boron","Bandgap","Carbon","Nitrogen","Oxygen","Fluorine","Neon","Aluminium","Silicon","Β-tin","Primitive_hexagonal","Hexagonal-close-packed","Face-centered_cubic","Phosphorus","Allotropes_of_phosphorus","Sulfur","Chlorine","Argon","Gallium","Density_of_states","Fermi_energy","Germanium","Arsenic","Selenium","Bromine","Krypton","Indium","Tin","White_tin","Gray_tin","Antimony","Tellurium","Iodine","Xenon","Thallium","Lead","Bismuth","Polonium","Astatine","Radon"]}
