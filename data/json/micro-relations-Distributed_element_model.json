{"cursor":"8259","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n: This article is an example from the domain of electrical systems, which is a\n: special case of the more general [[distributed parameter system]]s.\n\nIn electrical engineering, the 'distributed element model' or 'transmission line\nmodel' of electrical circuits assumes that the attributes of the circuit\n(resistance, capacitance, and inductance) are distributed continuously\nthroughout the material of the circuit. This is in contrast to the more common\nlumped element model, which assumes that these values are lumped into electrical\ncomponents that are joined by perfectly conducting wires. In the distributed\nelement model, each circuit element is infinitesimally small, and the wires\nconnecting elements are not assumed to be perfect conductors; that is, they have\nimpedance. Unlike the lumped element model, it assumes non-uniform current along\neach branch and non-uniform voltage along each node. The distributed model is\nused at high frequencies where the wavelength approaches the physical dimensions\nof the circuit, making the lumped model inaccurate.\n","linknr":149,"url":"Distributed_element_model","recorded":1362484212,"links":17,"instances":["telecommunications"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Electronic design","Distributed element circuits"],"headings":["Applications","See also","References","Bibliography"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/9e/Line_model_Heaviside.svg/300px-Line_model_Heaviside.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c1/Line_model_Kelvin.svg/300px-Line_model_Kelvin.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/81/Resistivity_probes.svg/220px-Resistivity_probes.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/ac/Inductor_distributed_model.svg/250px-Inductor_distributed_model.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["horn","telecommunications"]],"members":["horn"],"related":["Electrical_engineering","Electrical_network","Electrical_resistance","Capacitance","Inductance","Lumped_element_model","Electrical_component","Wire","Electrical_conduction","Frequency","Wavelength","Lumped_element_model","Calculus","Linear_algebra","Transmission_line","Power_transmission_line","Primary_line_constants","Secondary_line_constants","Horn_(telecommunications)","Signal_reflection","Reflections_of_signals_on_conducting_lines","Quarter_wave_impedance_transformer","Electrical_impedance","Dual_impedance","Bipolar_junction_transistor","Charge_carrier","Resistivity","Electrode_array","Geophysics","Silicon_wafer","Distributed_element_filter","Transmission_line","Lumped_components"]}
