{"cursor":"2698","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Richard Al(l)ison' (born c. 1560â1570 â died before 1610) was an English\ncomposer. He wrote de la Tromba, a fine broken consort piece which has\nseveral professional recordings and first became well known due to the Julian\nBream Consort.\n\nHe was known to be in the service of the Countess of Warwick in 1599, and then\nworking for Sir John Scudamore. His publications are: The Psalms of David in\nMeter (1599) and An Hour's Recreation in musicke, apt for instruments and voyces\n(1606). His work also appears in Michael East's and Thomas Ravenscroft's\npsalters, and Thomas Morley's broken consort publication.\n\nHe referred in the dedication of his Psalmes to the late Ambrose Dudley, 3rd\nEarl of Warwick as 'my good Lord and Master'. Allison is represented by thirteen\ncompositions in a set of consort books (dated 1588), from the household of Sir\nFrancis Walsingham. Ten four-part settings by him appeared in East's Whole Booke\nof Psalms (1592), and he contributed a dedicatory poem to Giles Farnaby's\nCanzonets to Fowre Voyces (1598). Grove Dictionary of Music and\nMusicians\n\nIn 1599, he published his own Psalmes of David in Meter, giving his London\naddress as Dukes Place, near Aldgate, and describing himself as a 'gentleman'\nand a 'practitioner' of music. This print also includes his coat of arms,\nproviding much information about his family. In the same year, seven of his\ninstrumental works appeared without attribution in Morley's First Booke of\nConsort Lessons (claims that Allison may have been the 'gentleman' who financed\nthe publication remain unsubstantiated and seem improbable).\n\nIn 1606, he published An Howres Recreation in Musicke, acknowledging Sir John\nScudamore (of Holme Lacy, near Hereford) as his patron. He is not heard of\nagain, and may well have been dead by the time of Philip Rosseter's Lessens for\nConsort (1609) which includes four of his compositions, together with the\ninformation that most of the contents are by composers 'whose memorie only\nremaines'.\n","linknr":110,"url":"Richard_Allison_(composer)","recorded":1375059322,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Richard_Allison_(composer)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Richard_Allison_(composer)&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Broken_consort","/wiki/Julian_Bream","/wiki/John_Scudamore_(courtier)","/wiki/Michael_East_(composer)","/wiki/Thomas_Ravenscroft","/wiki/Thomas_Morley","/wiki/Broken_consort","/wiki/Ambrose_Dudley,_3rd_Earl_of_Warwick","/wiki/Francis_Walsingham","/wiki/Giles_Farnaby","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Aldgate","/wiki/Holme_Lacy","/wiki/Hereford","/wiki/Philip_Rosseter","/w/index.php?title=Richard_Allison_(composer)&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Richard_Allison_(composer)&action=edit&section=2","http://imslp.org/wiki/Category:Allison,_Richard","/wiki/International_Music_Score_Library_Project","/w/index.php?title=Richard_Allison_(composer)&action=edit&section=3","#cite_ref-1","/wiki/Authority_control","http://www.worldcat.org/identities/lccn-n82-108003","/wiki/Library_of_Congress_Control_Number","http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n82108003","/wiki/File:MusicalnotesUK.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/MusicalnotesUK.svg/40px-MusicalnotesUK.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Richard_Allison_(composer)&action=edit","/wiki/Template:UK-composer-stub","/w/index.php?title=Template_talk:UK-composer-stub&action=edit&redlink=1","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:UK-composer-stub&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Richard_Allison_(composer)&oldid=526652037","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:16th-century_births","/wiki/Category:1600s_deaths","/wiki/Category:English_composers","/wiki/Category:Renaissance_composers","/wiki/Category:16th-century_English_people","/wiki/Category:17th-century_English_people","/wiki/Category:People_of_the_Tudor_period","/wiki/Category:British_composer_stubs","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_LCCN_identifiers","/wiki/Category:Year_of_birth_missing","/wiki/Category:Year_of_death_missing","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Richard+Allison+%28composer%29&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Richard+Allison+%28composer%29","/wiki/Richard_Allison_(composer)","/wiki/Talk:Richard_Allison_(composer)","#","/wiki/Richard_Allison_(composer)","/w/index.php?title=Richard_Allison_(composer)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Richard_Allison_(composer)&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Richard_Allison_(composer)","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Richard_Allison_(composer)","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Richard_Allison_(composer)&oldid=526652037","/w/index.php?title=Richard_Allison_(composer)&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7323698","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Richard_Allison_%28composer%29&id=526652037","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Richard+Allison+%28composer%29","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Richard+Allison+%28composer%29&oldid=526652037&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Richard_Allison_(composer)&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7323698#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/
