MIT has five schools and one college, containing a\ntotal of 32 academic departments, with a strong emphasis on scientific,\nengineering, and technological education and research.\n\nFounded in 1861 in response to the increasing industrialization of the United\nStates, the institute adopted the European polytechnic university model and\nemphasized laboratory instruction from an early date. MIT's early\nemphasis on applied technology at the undergraduate and graduate levels led to\nclose cooperation with industry. Curricular reforms under Karl Compton and\nVannevar Bush in the 1930s re-emphasized basic scientific research. MIT was elected to the Association of American Universities in\n1934. Researchers were involved in efforts to develop computers, radar, and\ninertial guidance in connection with defense research during World War II and\nthe Cold War. Post-war defense research contributed to the rapid expansion of\nthe faculty and campus under James Killian.\n\nThe current campus opened in 1916 and extends over along the northern bank of\nthe Charles River basin. In the past 60 years, MIT's\neducational disciplines have expanded beyond the physical sciences and\nengineering into fields such as biology, economics, linguistics, political\nscience, and management.\n\nMIT enrolled 4,384 undergraduates and 6,510 graduate students for the 2011â2012\nschool year. MIT received 18,109 undergraduate\napplicants for the class of 2016, with only 1,620 offered admittance, an\nacceptance rate of 8.9%. http://mitadmissions.org/apply/process/stats\nIt employs around 1,000 faculty members. Seventy-\neight Nobel laureates, 52 National Medal of Science recipients, 45 Rhodes\nScholars, and 38 MacArthur Fellows are currently or have previously been\naffiliated with the university.\n\nMIT has a strong entrepreneurial culture. The aggregated revenues of companies\nfounded by MIT alumni would rank as the eleventh-largest economy in the\nworld. MIT managed\n$718.2 million in research expenditures and an $8.0 billion endowment in\n2009.\n\nThe \"Engineers\" sponsor 33 sports, most teams of which compete in the\nNCAA Division III's New England Women's and Men's Athletic Conference; the\nDivision I rowing programs compete as part of the EARC and EAWRC.\n","linknr":2871,"url":"MIT","recorded":1362510172,"links":180,"instances":["band","author","education","computer","sport","business","boston","british_journalist_and_politician","censorship","halo","boston","learning_theory","physicist","united_states","mbta","mbta","programming_language","programmer_subculture","clergyman","ncaa","united_states","ncaa","mit"],"pdf":["http://www.nacubo.org/Documents/research/2012NCSEPublicTablesEndowmentMarketValuesFinalJanuary232013.pdf","http://www.nacubo.org/Documents/research/2012NCSEPublicTablesEndowmentMarketValuesFinalJanuary232013.pdf","http://libraries.mit.edu/archives/mithistory/pdf/house260.pdf","http://libraries.mit.edu/archives/mithistory/pdf/house260.pdf","http://libraries.mit.edu/archives/mithistory/pdf/1861%20Charter.pdf","http://libraries.mit.edu/archives/mithistory/pdf/1861%20Charter.pdf","http://libraries.mit.edu/archives/mithistory/pdf/objects-plan.pdf","http://libraries.mit.edu/archives/mithistory/pdf/objects-plan.pdf","http://invention.smithsonian.org/downloads/e-prototype_may10.pdf","http://invention.smithsonian.org/downloads/e-prototype_may10.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20100731034447/http://mit.edu/facilities/maps/tunnelMap.pdf","http://mit.edu/facilities/maps/tunnelMap.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20100731034447/http://mit.edu/facilities/maps/tunnelMap.pdf","http://web.mit.edu/reslife/fsilg/map.pdf","http://web.mit.edu/reslife/fsilg/map.pdf","http://www.nacubo.org/Documents/research/2011NCSEPublicTablesEndowmentMarketValues319.pdf","http://www.nacubo.org/Documents/research/2011NCSEPublicTablesEndowmentMarketValues319.pdf","http://web.mit.edu/annualreports/pres05/17.00.pdf","http://web.mit.edu/annualreports/pres05/17.00.pdf","http://web.mit.edu/annualreports/pres10/2010.13.00.pdf","http://web.mit.edu/annualreports/pres10/2010.13.00.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20061107035149/http://web.mit.edu/admissions/pdf/MITinstructions.pdf","http://web.mit.edu/admissions/pdf/MITinstructions.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20061107035149/http://web.mit.edu/admissions/pdf/MITinstructions.pdf","http://mitcrimeclub.org/ncaa121128.pdf","http://mitcrimeclub.org/ncaa121128.pdf","http://mit.edu/athletics/www/department/DAPERQuickFacts09.pdf","http://mit.edu/athletics/www/department/DAPERQuickFacts09.pdf","http://tech.mit.edu/archives/VOL_092/TECH_V092_S0210_P007.pdf","http://tech.mit.edu/archives/VOL_092/TECH_V092_S0210_P007.pdf","http://tech.mit.edu/V85/PDF/N32.pdf","http://tech.mit.edu/V85/PDF/N32.pdf","http://libraries.mit.edu/archives/mithistory/presidents-reports/1960.pdf","http://libraries.mit.edu/archives/mithistory/presidents-reports/1960.pdf","http://libraries.mit.edu/archives/mithistory/pdf/lewis.pdf","http://libraries.mit.edu/archives/mithistory/pdf/lewis.pdf"],"categories":["Association
