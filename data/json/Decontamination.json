Decontamination is sometimes abbreviated as\n\"decon\", \"dcon\" or \"decontam\".\n\nPersons suspected of being contaminated are usually separated by sex, and led\ninto a decon tent, a decon trailer, or a decon pod, where they shed their\npotentially contaminated clothes in a strip-down room. Then they enter a wash-\ndown room where they are showered. Finally they enter a drying and re-robing\nroom to be issued clean clothing, or a white Tyvek jumpsuit, or the like. Some\nmore structured facilities include six rooms (strip-down, wash-down and\nexamination rooms, for each of men's and women's side).
