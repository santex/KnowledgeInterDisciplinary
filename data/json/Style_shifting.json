{"cursor":"3372","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Style-shifting' is a term in sociolinguistics referring to alternation between\nstyles of speech included in a linguistic repertoire of an individual speaker.\nAs noted by Eckert and Rickford, in\nsociolinguistic literature terms 'style' and 'register' sometimes have been used\ninterchangeably. Also, various connotations of style are a subject of study in\nstylistics.\n\nStyle-shifting is a manifestation of intraspeaker (within-speaker)\nvariation, in contrast with interspeaker (between-speakers) variation. It is\na voluntary act which an individual effects in order to respond to or\ninitiate changes in sociolinguistic situation (e.g., interlocutor-related,\nsetting-related, topic-related).\n\nWilliam Labov, while conducting 'sociolinguistic interviews', designated two\ntypes of spoken style, casual and formal, and three types of reading style (a\nreading passage, a word list, and a minimal pair list). Analysing style-shifting\nLabov postulated that \"styles can be arranged along a single dimension, measured\nby the amount of attention paid to speech\" (1972, as quoted in ), casual style requiring the least amount of conscious self-\nmonitoring. Such style-shifting is often referred to as responsive (produced in\nresponse to normative pressures).\n\nIn recent developments of stylistic variation analysis scholars such as Allan\nBell, Barbara Johnstone, Natalie Schilling-Estes have been focusing on\ninitiative dimension of style-shifting, which occurs when speakers proactively\nchoose among various linguistic resources (e.g. dialectal, archaic or\nvernacular forms) in order to present themselves in a specific way. In\ninitiative style-shifting speakers actively engage in social practices to\nconstruct social meaning.\n","linknr":95,"url":"Style_shifting","recorded":1362480897,"links":10,"instances":["sociolinguistics","manner_of_address","linguistics","sociolinguist"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Sociolinguistics"],"headings":["See also","References","Further reading"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["stylistics","linguistics"],["allan_bell","sociolinguist"],["register","sociolinguistics"],["style","manner_of_address"],["stylistics","linguistics"]],"members":["register","style","stylistics","allan_bell"],"related":["Sociolinguistics","Stylistics_(linguistics)","William_Labov","Minimal_pair","Allan_Bell_(Sociolinguist)","Vernacular","Audience_design","Code-switching","Register_(sociolinguistics)","Style_(manner_of_address)","Stylistics_(linguistics)","Allan_Bell","William_Labov"]}
