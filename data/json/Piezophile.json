{"cursor":"2231","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'piezophile' (also called a 'barophile') is an organism which thrives at high\npressures, such as deep sea bacteria or archaea. They are generally found on\nocean floors, where pressure often exceeds 380 atm (38 MPa). Some have been\nfound at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean where the maximum pressure is roughly\n117 MPa. The high pressures experienced by these organisms can cause the\nnormally fluid cell membrane to become waxy and relatively impermeable to\nnutrients. These organisms have adapted in novel ways to become tolerant of\nthese pressures in order to colonize deep sea habitats. One example,\nxenophyophores, have been found in the deepest ocean trench, 6.6 miles (10,541\nmeters) below the surface.\n\nBarotolerant bacteria are able to survive at high pressures, but can exist in\nless extreme environments as well. Obligate barophiles cannot survive outside of\nsuch environments. For example, the Halomonas species [[Halomonas salaria]]\nrequires a pressure of 1000 atm (100 MPa) and a temperature of 3 degrees\nCelsius. Most piezophiles grow in darkness and are usually very UV-sensitive;\nthey lack many mechanisms of DNA repair.\n","linknr":171,"url":"Piezophile","recorded":1362505564,"links":16,"instances":["journal","temperature","unit","unit"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Aquatic ecology","Bacteria","Barophiles"],"headings":["See also","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["atmosphere","unit"],["pascal","unit"],["degree","temperature"],["science","journal"]],"members":["science","degree","atmosphere","pascal"],"related":["Organism","High_pressure","Bacteria","Archaea","Seabed","Atmosphere_(unit)","Pascal_(unit)","Pacific_Ocean","Cell_membrane","Semipermeable_membrane","Colonize","Habitats","Xenophyophore","Halomonas","Degree_(temperature)","Celsius","Archaea","Bacteria","Cell_membrane","Xenophyophore","Science_(journal)"]}
