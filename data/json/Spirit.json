The\nword spirit is often used metaphysically to refer to the consciousness or\npersonality. The notions of a person's \"spirit\" and \"soul\" often also overlap,\nas both contrast with body and both are understood as surviving the bodily death\nin religion and occultism, OED \"spirit 2.a.: The soul of a person, as\ncommended to God, or passing out of the body, in the moment of death.\" and\n\"spirit\" can also have the sense of \"ghost\", i.e. a manifestation of the spirit\nof a deceased person.\n\nThe term may also refer to any incorporeal or immaterial being, such as demons\nor deities, in Christianity specifically the Holy Spirit (though with a capital\n\"S\") experienced by the disciples at Pentecost.\n","linknr":571,"url":"Spirit","recorded":1362672978,"links":55,"instances":["spirituality","spiritualism","egyptian_soul","philosophy","classical_element","creature","physiology","hinduism","mythology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Deities, spirits, and mythic beings","Ghosts","Religious philosophical concepts","Spirituality","Vitalism"],"headings":["Etymology","Metaphysical and metaphorical uses","Related concepts in other languages","See also","References","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/10/Theodor_von_Holst_Bertalda_Assailed_Spirits.png/170px-Theodor_von_Holst_Bertalda_Assailed_Spirits.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/14/EndlessKnot03d.png/23px-EndlessKnot03d.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["energy","spirituality"],["aether","classical_element"],["daemon","mythology"],["sprite","creature"],["respiration","physiology"],["absolute","philosophy"],["absolute","philosophy"],["ba","egyptian_soul"],["daemon","mythology"],["deva","hinduism"],["spirit_world","spiritualism"]],"members":["energy","spirit_world","ba","absolute","aether","sprite","respiration","deva","daemon"],"related":["Latin","Breath","Mind-body_dualism","Consciousness","Personality","Body","Ghost","Demon","Deity","Holy_Spirit","Latin","Breath","Proto-Indo-European_language","Soul","Laryngeal_theory","Consonant_voicing_and_devoicing","Middle_English","Old_French","Abrahamic_religions","Metaphysics","Metaphorical","Incorporeal","Energy_(spirituality)","Animism","Aether_(classical_element)","Daemon_(mythology)","Sprite_(creature)","Ghost","Mind","Consciousness","Religion","Spirituality","Respiration_(physiology)","Blood","Intelligence","Consciousness","Sentience","Latter-day_Saint","Joseph_Smith_Jr.","Doctrine_and_Covenants","Native_Americans_in_the_United_States","Great_Spirit","Wakan_Tanka","Supreme_Being","Animism","Shinto","African_traditional_religion","Animal_spirit","Landform","Kami","Capitalization","Spirituality","Universal_consciousness","Deity","Consciousness","Intellect","Dualism","Force","Life","Experience","Supernatural","Belief","Anthroposophy","Aurobindo","Georg_Wilhelm_Friedrich_Hegel","Ken_Wilber","Meher_Baba","Plotinus","Absolute_(philosophy)","Friedrich_Schelling","Absolute_(philosophy)","Panentheism","Pantheism","Essence","Mind","Soul","Hierarchy","Holarchy","Consciousness","Theology","God","Holy_Spirit","Triune_God","Trinity","Gospel_of_Matthew","Pneumatology","Psychology","Christian_Science","God","Science_and_Health_With_Key_to_the_Scriptures","Harmony_Society","Mind","Metaphorical","Collective","School_spirit","United_States_Declaration_of_Independence","John_Locke","Writing","Literal_translation","Law","Letter_and_spirit_of_the_law","Alcoholic_beverages","Mysticism","Existence","God","Soul","Ghost","Spirituality","Prana","Mind","Bible","Holy_Spirit","Ruach_HaKodesh","Kabbalah","Soul","Scandinavian_languages","Chinese_language","Angel","Astral_Projection","Ba_(Egyptian_soul)","Brahman","Daemon_(mythology)","Demon","Deva_(Hinduism)","Ekam","Egyptian_soul","Ghost","Jinn","Monster","Non-physical_entity","Pneuma","Pneumatology","Prana","Qi","Soul","Soul_dualism","Spiritism","Spirit_world_(Spiritualism)","Spirituality"]}
