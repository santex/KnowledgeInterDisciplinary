The person who receives payment for sexual\nservices is called a 'prostitute' or '[[sex worker]]', and the person who\nreceives such services is known by a multitude of terms. Prostitution is one of\nthe branches of the sex industry. The legal status of prostitution varies from\ncountry to country, from being permissible but unregulated, to a punishable\ncrime or to a regulated profession. Estimates place the annual revenue generated\nfrom the global prostitution industry to be over $100 billion.\nProstitution is sometimes referred to as \"the world's oldest\nprofession\". The prostitution of women and girls - Page 5; Ronald B. Flowers\n- 1998\n\nProstitution occurs in a variety of forms. Brothels are establishments\nspecifically dedicated to prostitution. In escort prostitution, the act may take\nplace at the customer's residence or hotel room (referred to as out-call), or at\nthe escort's residence or in a hotel room rented for the occasion by the escort\n(called in-call). Another form is street prostitution. Sex tourism refers to\ntravelling, typically from developed to underdeveloped nations, to engage in\nsexual activity with prostitutes.\n","linknr":1779,"url":"Prostitute","recorded":1362486204,"links":153,"instances":["brothel","drinking_cup","prostitution","bdsm","demon","military","banaskantha"],"pdf":["http://www.sexworkeurope.org/icrse/images/phocadownload/manbrussels2005.pdf","http://tampep.eu/documents/TAMPEP%202009%20European%20Mapping%20Report.pdf","http://www.unodc.org/documents/Global_Report_on_TIP.pdf","http://www.unodc.org/documents/Global_Report_on_TIP.pdf","http://www.ilo.org/public/english/standards/relm/ilc/ilc93/pdf/rep-i-b.pdf","http://www.ilo.org/public/english/standards/relm/ilc/ilc93/pdf/rep-i-b.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20070606235116/http://www.unicri.it/wwd/trafficking/minors/docs/dr_thailand.pdf","http://www.unicri.it/wwd/trafficking/minors/docs/dr_thailand.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20070606235116/http://www.unicri.it/wwd/trafficking/minors/docs/dr_thailand.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20070731044240/http://www.ecpat.org.uk/downloads/Thailand05.pdf","http://www.ecpat.org.uk/downloads/Thailand05.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20070731044240/http://www.ecpat.org.uk/downloads/Thailand05.pdf","http://www.springerlink.com/content/p46r4txv88040p82/fulltext.pdf","http://www.springerlink.com/content/p46r4txv88040p82/fulltext.pdf","http://prostitution.procon.org/sourcefiles/mens-practices-in-prostitution-and-their-implications-for-social-work.pdf","http://prostitution.procon.org/sourcefiles/mens-practices-in-prostitution-and-their-implications-for-social-work.pdf","http://prostitution.procon.org/sourcefiles/who-pays-for-sex-an-analysis-of-the-increasing-prevalence-of-female-commercial-sex-contacts-among-men-in-britain.pdf","http://prostitution.procon.org/sourcefiles/who-pays-for-sex-an-analysis-of-the-increasing-prevalence-of-female-commercial-sex-contacts-among-men-in-britain.pdf","http://www.iies.su.se/seminars/papers/Edlund.pdf","http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cedaw/docs/cedaw_crc_contributions/CoalitionagainstTraffickinginWomen.pdf","http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cedaw/docs/cedaw_crc_contributions/CoalitionagainstTraffickinginWomen.pdf","http://www.hivlawcommission.org/resources/report/FinalReport-Risks,Rights&Health-EN.pdf","http://www.hivlawcommission.org/resources/report/FinalReport-Risks,Rights&Health-EN.pdf","http://www.hivlawcommission.org/resources/report/FinalReport-Risks,Rights&Health-EN.pdf","http://www.katallaxi.se/wp-content/uploads/2006/11/moral-crusade.pdf","http://www.katallaxi.se/wp-content/uploads/2006/11/moral-crusade.pdf"],"categories":["Prostitution|","Human
