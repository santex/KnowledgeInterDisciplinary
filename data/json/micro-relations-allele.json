{"cursor":"9122","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"An 'allele' ( or ) is one of a number of alternative forms of the same gene or\nsame genetic locus (generally a group of genes). It is the alternative form of a\ngene for a character producing different effects. The form \"allel\" is also used,\nan abbreviation of allelomorph. Sometimes, different alleles can result in\ndifferent observable phenotypic traits, such as different pigmentation. However,\nmany variations at the genetic level result in little or no observable\nvariation.\n\nMost multicellular organisms have two sets of chromosomes, that is, they are\ndiploid. These chromosomes are referred to as homologous chromosomes. Diploid\norganisms have one copy of each gene (and therefore one allele) on each\nchromosome. If both alleles are the same, they are homozygotes. If the alleles\nare different, they are heterozygotes.\n\nA population or species of organisms typically includes multiple alleles at each\nlocus among various individuals. Allelic variation at a locus is measurable as\nthe number of alleles (polymorphism) present, or the proportion of heterozygotes\nin the population.\n\nFor example, at the gene locus for the ABO blood type carbohydrate antigens in\nhumans,","linknr":247,"url":"allele","recorded":1362565785,"links":43,"instances":["genetics","biology","genetics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Classical genetics","Genetic genealogy"],"headings":["Dominant and recessive alleles","Allele and genotype frequencies","Allelic variation in genetic disorders","See also","References and notes","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/math/c/4/d/c4dc7cc2d3ded598e1dd13e24569362c.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/f/4/4f400dafe8d19703a0aa8f5fed04e20a.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/3/2/4/324d4fe46ad61bceb69d9898ca26954f.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/4/1/4411e4f5e81a1bed0dc95163d207b504.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/3/f/73f02d8aee0b59e253d7fdf5cade0aba.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/Tree_of_life.svg/32px-Tree_of_life.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["locus","genetics"],["locus","genetics"],["polymorphism","biology"],["dominance","genetics"],["dominance","genetics"],["dominance","genetics"],["polymorphism","biology"]],"members":["dominance","polymorphism","locus"],"related":["Gene","Locus_(genetics)","Phenotypic_trait","Multicellular_organism","Chromosome","Diploid","Homologous_chromosome","Homozygote","Heterozygote","Population","Species","Locus_(genetics)","Polymorphism_(biology)","ABO","Blood_type","Carbohydrate","Antigen","Blood_transfusion","Genotype","Phenotype","Allelomorph","Genetics","Gene","Phenotypes","Dominance_(genetics)","Recessive","Dominance_(genetics)","Recessive","Dominance_(genetics)","Gregor_Mendel","Quantitative_trait_locus","Wild_type","Mutant","Genetic_diseases","Genetic_carrier","Hardy-Weinberg_principle","Genetic_disorders","Albinism","Cystic_Fibrosis","Galactosemia","Phenylketonuria","Tay-Sachs_Disease","Hemizygosity","Color_blindness","Fragile_X_syndrome","Huntington_disease","Allozyme","Evolution","Genealogical_DNA_test","Haplo-sufficiency","Meiosis","Mendelian_error","Mendelian_inheritance","Mitosis","Polymorphism_(biology)","Punnett_square"]}
