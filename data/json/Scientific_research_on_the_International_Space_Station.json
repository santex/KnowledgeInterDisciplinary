{"cursor":"189615","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"{{Multiple issues|\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n Commander and Science Officer Michael Foale conducts an inspection of the\n Microgravity Science Glovebox.]]\n\n\n'Scientific Research on the [[International Space Station]]' is a collection of\nexperiments that require one or more of the unusual conditions present in low\nEarth orbit. The primary fields of research include human research, space\nmedicine, life sciences, physical sciences, astronomy and meteorology. The 2005 NASA Authorization Act designated the\nAmerican segment of the International Space Station as a national laboratory\nwith the goal of increasing the use of the ISS by other federal agencies and the\nprivate sector.\n\nResearch on the ISS improves knowledge about the effects of long-term space\nexposure on the human body. Subjects currently under study include muscle\natrophy, bone loss, and fluid shift. The data will be used to determine whether\nspace colonisation and lengthy human spaceflight are feasible. As of 2006, data\non bone loss and muscular atrophy suggest that there would be a significant risk\nof fractures and movement problems if astronauts landed on a planet after a\nlengthy interplanetary cruise (such as the six-month journey time required to\nfly to Mars). Large scale medical studies are\nconducted aboard the ISS via the National Space Biomedical Research Institute\n(NSBRI). Prominent among these is the Advanced Diagnostic Ultrasound in\nMicrogravity study in which astronauts (including former ISS Commanders Leroy\nChiao and Gennady Padalka) perform ultrasound scans under the guidance of remote\nexperts. The study considers the diagnosis and treatment of medical conditions\nin space. Usually, there is no physician on board the ISS, and diagnosis of\nmedical conditions is a challenge. It is anticipated that remotely guided\nultrasound scans will have application on Earth in emergency and rural care\nsituations where access to a trained physician is\ndifficult.\n\nResearchers are investigating the effect of the station's near-weightless\nenvironment on the evolution, development, growth and internal processes of\nplants and animals. In response to some of this data, NASA wants to investigate\nmicrogravity's effects on the growth of three-dimensional, human-like tissues,\nand the unusual protein crystals that can be formed in space.\n\nThe investigation of the physics of fluids in microgravity will allow\nresearchers to model the behaviour of fluids better. Because fluids can be\nalmost completely combined in microgravity, physicists investigate fluids that\ndo not mix well on Earth. In addition, an examination of reactions that are\nslowed by low gravity and temperatures will give scientists a deeper\nunderstanding of superconductivity.\n\nThe study of materials science is an important ISS research activity, with the\nobjective of reaping economic benefits through the improvement of techniques\nused on the ground. Other areas of interest include the effect of the\nlow gravity environment on combustion, through the study of the efficiency of\nburning and control of emissions and pollutants. These findings may improve our\nknowledge about energy production, and lead to economic and environmental\nbenefits. Future plans are for the researchers aboard the ISS to examine\naerosols, ozone, water vapour, and oxides in Earth's atmosphere, as well as\ncosmic rays, cosmic dust, antimatter, and dark matter in the universe.\n","linknr":3607,"url":"Scientific_research_on_the_International_Space_Station","recorded":1375072717,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Scientific_research_on_the_International_Space_Station&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Scientific_research_on_the_International_Space_Station&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Scientific_research_on_the_International_Space_Station&action=edit","/wiki/Talk:Scientific_research_on_the_International_Space_Station","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Cleanup","/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style","/wiki/Template:Cleanup/doc","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Scientific_research_on_the_International_Space_Station&action=edit","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Article_size","/wiki/Wikipedia:Splitting","/wiki/Wikipedia:Summary_style","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:Footnotes","/wiki/Wikipedia:External_links","/wiki/File:Gnome_globe_current_event.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Gnome_globe_current_event.svg/42px-Gnome_globe_current_event.svg.png","/wiki/File:183478main_MSG1.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/183478main_MSG1.jpg/220px-183478main_MSG1.jpg","/wiki/File:183478main_MSG1.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Expedition_8","/wiki/Michael_Foale","/wiki/Microgravity_Science_Glovebox","/wiki/File:382009main_MELFI12.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/15/382009main_MELFI12.jpg/220px-382009main_MELFI12.jpg","/wiki/File:382009main_MELFI12.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/International_Space_Station","/wiki/Low_Earth_orbit","/wiki/Zero_g#Health_effects_of_weightlessness","/wiki/Space_medicine","/wiki/Life_science","/wiki/Physical_science","/wiki/Astronomy","/wiki/Meteorology","#cite_note-ISS_overview-1","#cite_note-NASA_Fields_of_Research-2","#cite_note-NASA_ISS_Goals-3","/wiki/NASA_Authorization_Act_of_2005","#cite_note-4","/wiki/Muscle_atrophy","/wiki/Osteoporosis","/wiki/Space_colonisation","/wiki/Human_spaceflight","/wiki/Manned_mission_to_Mars","#cite_note-JCB-5","#cite_note-6","/wiki/National_Space_Biomedical_Research_Institute","/wiki/Advanced_Diagnostic_Ultrasound_in_Microgravity","/wiki/Leroy_Chiao","/wiki/Gennady_Padalka","#cite_note-7","#cite_note-8","#cite_note-9","/wiki/Microgravity","#cite_note-NASA_Fields_of_Research-2","/wiki/Superconductivity","#cite_note-NASA_Fields_of_Research-2","/wiki/Materials_science","#cite_note-10","/wiki/Aerosol","/wiki/Ozone","/wiki/Water_vapor","/wiki/Oxide","/wiki/Cosmic_ray","/wiki/Cosmic_dust","/wiki/Antimatter","/wiki/Dark_matter","#cite_note-NASA_Fields_of_Research-2","#ISS_Science_Facilities","#Columbus_.28ISS_module.29","#Destiny_.28ISS_module.29","#Kibo_.28ISS_module.29","#Poisk_.28ISS_module.29","#ISS_Small_Hardware","#ISS_Sub-rack","#ISS_Stowage","#ISS_Mid-deck_Locker","#ISS_Mid-deck_Locker_Insert","#CSA_reported_ISS_Research_and_Science_Activity","#Experiments","#Fields","#ESA_reported_ISS_Research_and_Science_Activity","#Life_Sciences","#Biology","#Cardiovascular_Function","#Cell_and_Molecular_Biology","#Developmental_Biology","#Education","#Endocrinology_and_Metabolism","#Exobiology","#Fluid_Balance_and_Kidney_Function","#Human_Factors","#Human_Physiology","#Immunology_and_Haematology","#Medicine.2FHealth","#Microbiology","#Muscle.2Fskeletal_system","#Neurobiology","#Neuroscience","#Plant_Biology_and_Physiology","#Psychological_aspects","#Radiation_Biology","#Respiratory_Function","#Physical_Sciences","#Aggregation_Phenomena","#Atmospheric_physics","#Combustion","#Earth_observation","#Education_2","#Electromagnetics","#Fluid_physics","#Foams","#Fundamental_physics","#Metal_alloys","#Morphological_Stability_and_Microstructures","#Plasma_physics","#Properties_of_organic_compounds","#Protein_Crystal_Growth","#Radiation_dosimetry","#Solution
