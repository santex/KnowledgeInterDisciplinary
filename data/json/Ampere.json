It\nis named after AndrÃ©-Marie AmpÃ¨re (1775â1836), French mathematician and\nphysicist, considered the father of electrodynamics.\n\nIn practical terms, the ampere is a measure of the amount of electric charge\npassing a point in an electric circuit per unit time with\n6.241 × 10 18 electrons, or one coulomb per second\nconstituting one ampere.\n\nThe practical definition may lead to confusion with the definition of a coulomb\n(i.e., 1 ampere-second), but in practical terms this means that measures of a\nconstant current (e.g., the nominal flow of charge per second through a simple\ncircuit) will be defined in amperes (e.g., \"a 20 mA circuit\") and the flow of\ncharge through a circuit over a period of time will be defined in coulombs\n(e.g., \"a variable-current circuit that flows a total of 10 coulombs over 5\nseconds\"). In this way, amperes can be viewed as a flow rate, i.e. number of\nparticles (charged) transiting per unit time, and coulombs simply as the number\nof particles.\n","linknr":387,"url":"Ampere","recorded":1362485664,"links":106,"instances":["morphology","geometry","unit","unit"],"pdf":["http://www.bipm.fr/utils/common/pdf/si_brochure_8_en.pdf","http://www.bipm.fr/utils/common/pdf/si_brochure_8_en.pdf","http://www.bipm.org/utils/common/pdf/si_brochure_8_en.pdf","http://www.bipm.org/utils/common/pdf/si_brochure_8_en.pdf","http://www.bipm.org/utils/en/pdf/Press_release_resolution_1_CGPM.pdf","http://www.bipm.org/utils/en/pdf/Press_release_resolution_1_CGPM.pdf"],"categories":["SI base units","Units of electric current"],"headings":["Definition","History","Realization","Proposed future definition","Everyday examples","See also","Notes","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2b/Galvanometer_1890_drawing.png/200px-Galvanometer_1890_drawing.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/Ampere-def-en.svg/220px-Ampere-def-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/b/2/7/b270c550e43a9cf56028d87fc3bc1edf.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/3/e/f3e5a5e2850f0b231b28d1dfe19302c3.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c8/SI_base_unit.svg/75px-SI_base_unit.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Symbol_book_class2.svg/16px-Symbol_book_class2.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["clipping","morphology"],["mole","unit"],["newton","unit"],["cross_section","geometry"]],"members":["clipping","cross_section","newton","mole"],"related":["Galvanometer","SI_base_unit","Electric_current","Clipping_(morphology)","International_System_of_Units","Electric_current","Metre","Kelvin","Second","Mole_(unit)","Candela","Kilogram","SI_base_unit","André-Marie_Ampère","Electric_charge","Electron","Coulomb","Ampère's_force_law","Newton_(unit)","Cross_section_(geometry)","Metre","Vacuum","SI","Coulomb","Centimetre_gram_second_system_of_units","Abampere","Dyne","International_System_of_Units","Silver_nitrate","Watt_balance","Ohm's_Law","Electromotive_force","Electrical_resistance","Volt","Ohm","Josephson_junction","Quantum_Hall_effect","Relative_uncertainty","Coulomb","Elementary_charge","Electron","International_Committee_for_Weights_and_Measures","New_SI_definitions","General_Conference_on_Weights_and_Measures","General_Conference_on_Weights_and_Measures","Watt","Circuit_breaker","Ammeter","Ampacity","Electric_current","Electric_shock","Hydraulic_analogy","Magnetic_constant"]}
