{"cursor":"7668","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Lipinski's rule of five' also known as the 'Pfizer's rule of five' or simply\nthe 'Rule of five' (RO5) is a rule of thumb to evaluate druglikeness or\ndetermine if a chemical compound with a certain pharmacological or biological\nactivity has properties that would make it a likely orally active drug in\nhumans. The rule was formulated by Christopher A. Lipinski in 1997, based on the\nobservation that most medication drugs are relatively small and lipophilic\nmolecules.\n\nThe rule describes molecular properties important for a drug's pharmacokinetics\nin the human body, including their absorption, distribution, metabolism, and\nexcretion (\"ADME\"). However, the rule does not predict if a compound is\npharmacologically active.\n\nThe rule is important to keep in mind during drug discovery when a\npharmacologically active lead structure is optimized step-wise to increase the\nactivity and selectivity of the compound as well as to insure drug-like\nphysicochemical properties are maintained as described by Lipinski's rule. Candidate drugs that conform to the RO5 tend to have\nlower attrition rates during clinical trials and hence have an increased chance\nof reaching the market.\n","linknr":196,"url":"Lipinski's_Rule_of_5","recorded":1362504907,"links":18,"instances":["pharmacokinetics","pharmacology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Medicinal chemistry","Pharmacology","Cheminformatics","Drug discovery"],"headings":["Components of the rule","Variants","Lead-like","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["absorption","pharmacokinetics"],["distribution","pharmacology"]],"members":["absorption","distribution"],"related":["Rule_of_thumb","Druglikeness","Chemical_compound","Pharmacology","Biological_activity","Christopher_A._Lipinski","Lipophilicity","Molecule","Molecular_property","Pharmacokinetics","Absorption_(pharmacokinetics)","Distribution_(pharmacology)","Metabolism","Excretion","ADME","Drug_discovery","Drug_discovery_hit_to_lead","Clinical_trial","Hydrogen_bond","Nitrogen","Oxygen","Atoms","Hydrogen","Atoms","Hydrogen_bond","Nitrogen","Oxygen","Atoms","Molecular_mass","Atomic_mass_unit","Partition_coefficient","Rules_of_thumb","Baldwin's_rules","Murphy's_law","Druglikeness","Partition_coefficient","Molar_refractivity","Chemical_library","Partition_coefficient","Molecular_mass","Atomic_mass_unit","Hydrogen_bond","Hydrogen_bond","QSAR","Polar_surface_area","Biopharmaceutics_Classification_System","Chemical_property","Molecular_property","Physical_property","Chemical_structure","Chemicalize.org","ChemAxon"]}
