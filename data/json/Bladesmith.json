{"cursor":"21289","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":", 1569.]] 'Bladesmithing' is the art of making knives, swords, daggers and other\nblades using a forge, hammer, anvil, and other smithing tools. Bladesmiths employ a\nvariety of metalworking techniques similar to those used by blacksmiths, as well\nas woodworking for knife and sword handles, and often leatherworking for\nsheaths. Bladesmithing is an art that is thousands\nof years old and found in cultures as diverse as China, Japan, India, Germany,\nKorea, the Middle East, and the British Isles. As with any art shrouded in\nhistory, there are myths and misconceptions about the process. While\ntraditionally, bladesmithing referred to the manufacture of any blade by any\nmeans, the majority of contemporary craftsmen referred to as bladesmiths are\nthose who primarily manufacture blades by means of using a forge to shape the\nblade as opposed to knifemakers who form blades by use of the stock removal\nmethod, although there is some overlap between both crafts.\n","linknr":639,"url":"Bladesmith","recorded":1362480242,"links":26,"instances":["fuel"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Blade weapons","Metalworking occupations","Swordsmiths|"],"headings":["Related trades","Historic bladesmithing","Modern bladesmithing","Myths and misconceptions","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a6/Landauer_I_048_v.jpg/250px-Landauer_I_048_v.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b9/Damascus_bladesmith.jpg/225px-Damascus_bladesmith.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Symbol_book_class2.svg/16px-Symbol_book_class2.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["coke","fuel"]],"members":["coke"],"related":["Knives","Sword","Daggers","Blades","Forge","Hammer","Anvil","Tool","Metalworking","Blacksmith","Woodworking","Leatherworking","Knife_making","Stock_removal","Knife_making","Knife","Scythe","Ancient_Egypt","Smelting","Native_metal","Meteorite","Wrought_iron","Proto-Celtic","Hallstatt_culture","La_Tene_culture","Jian","Korean_sword","Shōsōin","Heian_period","Laminated","Kamakura_period","Mongol","Emperor_Go-toba","Differential_hardening","Mongol_invasions_of_Japan","Muromachi_period","Sakai,_Osaka","Tobacco","Tokugawa_shogunate","Haitorei_edict","Second_World_War","Occupied_Japan","Migration_period","Wootz","Damascus_steel","Toledo,_Spain","Toledo_Steel","Industrial_Revolution","Machine_tool","Stock_removal","Coke_(fuel)","Power_hammer","Steels","High_carbon_steel","SAE_1075","SAE_1095","Tool_steel","Swords","Spring_steel","Leaf_springs","Pattern_welding","William_F._Moran","Drop_forging","Casting","Sword_replica"]}
