{"cursor":"1458","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nThe suffix '-ose' is used in biochemistry to form the names of sugars. This\nLatin suffix means \"full of\", \"abounding in\", \"given to\", or \"like\". http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/-\nose Numerous systems exist to name specific sugars more descriptively.\n\nMonosaccharides, the simplest sugars, may be named according to the number\nof carbon atoms in each molecule of the sugar: pentose is a five-carbon\nmonosaccharide, and hexose is a six-carbon monosaccharide. Aldehyde\nmonosaccharides may be called aldoses; ketone monosaccharides may be\ncalled ketoses.\n\nLarger sugars such as disaccharides and polysaccharides can be named to reflect\ntheir qualities. Lactose, a disaccharide found in milk, gets its name from the\nLatin word for milk combined with the sugar suffix; its name means \"milk sugar\".\nThe polysaccharide that makes up plant starch is named amylose, or \"starch\nsugar\"; see amyl#Etymology.\n\nThere are these theories about the origin of the -ose suffix:-\n# Extracted from glucose, an important hexose whose name came from Greek Î³Î»ÏÎºÏÏ\n# = \"sweet\". Extracted from sucrose, whose name came from Latin sucrum = \"sugar\"\n# plus the common Latin adjective-forming suffix -Åsus; Latin sucrosus would\n# mean \"sugary\".\n","linknr":147,"url":"-ose","recorded":1362372293,"links":13,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Chemistry suffixes"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Affix","Biochemistry","Sugar","Monosaccharide","Carbon","Pentose","Hexose","Aldehyde","Aldose","Ketone","Ketose","Disaccharide","Polysaccharide","Lactose","Milk","Latin","Starch","Amylose","Glucose","Sucrose"]}
