Every sexually-reproducing creature who is not a\n genetic chimera has a maximum of four genetic grandparents, eight genetic great-\n grandparents, sixteen genetic great-great-grandparents, etc. Rarely, such as\n in the case of sibling or half-sibling incest, these numbers are lower. In the\n history of modern humanity, around 30,000 years ago, the number of modern\n humans who lived to be grandparents began to skyrocket. It is not known for\n certain what spurred this increase in longevity. But it is believed that a key\n consequence of three generations being alive together was the facilitation of\n the passing along of information that prior to that point would have been\n lost; an example of this important information might have been where to find\n water in times of drought. http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=the-mysterious-\n downfall&page=4 http://www.cmich.edu/CMU_Media_Channel_Home/Caspari-\n .htm\n\nIn cases where parents are unwilling or unable to provide adequate care for\ntheir children (e.g., death of the parents), grandparents often take on the role\nof primary caregivers. Even when this is not the case, and particularly in\ntraditional cultures, grandparents often have a direct and clear role in\nrelation to the raising, care and nurture of children.\n\nOne can also be a 'step-grandparent'. A step-grandparent can be one's parent's\nstep-parent or one's step-parent's parent or one's step-parent's step-parent.\nThe various words for grandparents at times may also be used to refer to any\nelderly person, especially the terms gramps, granny, grandfather, grandmother\nand even more types that most families make up themselves.\n","linknr":304,"url":"Grandparent","recorded":1362582180,"links":74,"instances":["linguistics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Family"],"headings":["Titles","Great-grandparents","History of the term","Grandparents in non-Western culture","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/The_Favorite_by_Georgios_Iakovidis.jpg/220px-The_Favorite_by_Georgios_Iakovidis.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/GrandfatherAndScooter.JPG/275px-GrandfatherAndScooter.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dc/Child_pushing_grandmother_on_plastic_tricycle.jpg/300px-Child_pushing_grandmother_on_plastic_tricycle.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cc/Babur_Seeks_His_Grandmothers_Advice.jpg/220px-Babur_Seeks_His_Grandmothers_Advice.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg/20px-Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["ordinal_number","linguistics"]],"members":["ordinal_number"],"related":["Parent","Father","Mother","Genetic_chimera","Gene","Incest","Pedigree_collapse","Nurture","Child","Plural","United_States","Canada","United_Kingdom","Ireland","United_States","Australia","New_Zealand","Newfoundland_and_Labrador","India","Hispanic","French_people","Italian_people","Dutch_people","German_people","Kinship_terminology","Swedish_language","Scandinavian_languages","Danish_language","Norwegian_language","Ordinal_number_(linguistics)","Anglo-Norman_language","Latin","Old_English","East_Asia","Confucianism","Filial_piety","Morality","Western_culture","Nuclear_families","Aunt","Grandfamily","Uncle","Middle_age","Midlife_crisis","Cousin","AARP"]}
