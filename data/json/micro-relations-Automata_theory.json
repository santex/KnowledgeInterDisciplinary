{"cursor":"18309","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nIn theoretical computer science, 'automata theory' is the study of mathematical\nobjects called [[abstract machine]]s or [[automaton|automata]] and the\ncomputational problems that can be solved using them. Automata comes from the\nGreek word Î±á½ÏÏÎ¼Î±ÏÎ± meaning \"self-acting\".\n\nThe figure at right illustrates a finite state machine, which belongs to one well-\nknown variety of automaton. This automaton consists of states (represented in\nthe figure by circles), and transitions (represented by arrows). As the\nautomaton sees a symbol of input, it makes a transition (or jump) to another\nstate, according to its transition function (which takes the current state and\nthe recent symbol as its inputs).\n\nAutomata theory is also closely related to formal language theory. An automaton\nis a finite representation of a formal language that may be an infinite set.\nAutomata are often classified by the class of formal languages they are able to\nrecognize.\n\nAutomata play a major role in theory of computation, compiler design, artificial\nintelligence, parsing and formal verification.\n","linknr":306,"url":"Automata_theory","recorded":1362372636,"links":39,"instances":["mathematics","abstract_data_type","mathematics","computer_science"],"pdf":["http://www.csee.wvu.edu/~jworthing/asl2010.pdf"],"categories":["Automata theory|"],"headings":["Automata","Variant definitions of automata","Automata theory","Classes of automata","Applications","Automata Simulators","Connection to Category theory","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9d/DFAexample.svg/250px-DFAexample.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/8/3/0831e14abfd72fffac6b5c68170f21cf.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["state","computer_science"],["word","mathematics"],["stack","abstract_data_type"],["category","mathematics"]],"members":["word","stack","category","state"],"related":["Theoretical_computer_science","Mathematical_object","Finite_state_machine","State_(computer_science)","Formal_language_theory","Formal_language","Theory_of_computation","Compiler_design","Artificial_intelligence","Parsing","Formal_verification","Mathematical_object","Computational_theory","N-tuple","Word_(mathematics)","Formal_language","Recognizable_language","Regular_languages","Deterministic_finite_automaton","Omega_language","Tree_automaton","Infinite_tree_automaton","Countable","Quantum_finite_automaton","Topological_automaton","Uncountable_infinity","Stack_(abstract_data_type)","Probability","Geometric_automaton","Effective_method","DFA_minimization","Finite_state_machine_","Regular_languages","Deterministic_pushdown_automaton","Deterministic_context-free_languages","Pushdown_automaton","Context-free_languages","Linear_bounded_automaton","Context-sensitive_languages","Turing_machine","Recursively_enumerable_languages","Büchi_automaton","Omega-regular_language","Rabin_automaton","Streett_automaton","Parity_automaton","Muller_automaton","Hybrid_automaton","Finite_automata","Context-free_grammar","Cellular_automata","John_Horton_Conway","Conway's_Game_of_Life","Konrad_Zuse","Edward_Fredkin","Category_(mathematics)","Sequential_machine","Cartesian_closed_category","Monoid","Monoidal_category","Categories_of_groupoids","Groupoid_category","2-category"]}
