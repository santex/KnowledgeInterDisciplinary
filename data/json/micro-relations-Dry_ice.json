{"cursor":"22970","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Dry ice', sometimes referred to as \"'Cardice'\" or as \"'card ice'\" (chiefly\nBritish English), is the solid form of carbon dioxide. It is used primarily as a\ncooling agent. Its advantages include lower temperature than that of water ice\nand not leaving any residue (other than incidental frost from moisture in the\natmosphere). It is useful for preserving frozen foods, ice cream, etc., where\nmechanical cooling is unavailable.\n\nDry ice sublimates at â78.5 Â°C (â109.3 Â°F) at atmospheric pressure. This extreme\ncold makes the solid dangerous to handle without protection due to burns caused\nby freezing (frostbite). While generally not very toxic, the outgassing from it\ncan cause hypercapnia due to buildup in confined locations.\n","linknr":494,"url":"Dry_ice","recorded":1362543572,"links":58,"instances":["physics","tv_series","luring_substance","chemistry"],"pdf":["http://cdn.globalccsinstitute.com/sites/default/files/publications/7276/good-plant-design-and-operation-onshore-carbon-capture-installations-and-onshore-pipelines.pdf","http://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ash/ash_programs/hazmat/media/MaterialsCarriedByPassengersAndCrew.pdf","http://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ash/ash_programs/hazmat/media/MaterialsCarriedByPassengersAndCrew.pdf"],"categories":["Carbon dioxide","Coolants","Refrigerants","Ice"],"headings":["Properties","History","Manufacture","Applications","Safety","Occurrence on Mars","References","Bibliography"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/36/Dry_Ice_Pellets_Subliming.jpg/220px-Dry_Ice_Pellets_Subliming.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/64/Carbon-dioxide-crystal-3D-vdW.png/220px-Carbon-dioxide-crystal-3D-vdW.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/Carbon_dioxide_pressure-temperature_phase_diagram.svg/220px-Carbon_dioxide_pressure-temperature_phase_diagram.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/Sublimation_of_dry_ice_on_water.small.ogv/200px--Sublimation_of_dry_ice_on_water.small.ogv.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ce/Ice_cream_cart_-_geograph.org.uk_-_1485853.jpg/200px-Ice_cream_cart_-_geograph.org.uk_-_1485853.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Dry_ice_in_cup.jpg/200px-Dry_ice_in_cup.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Rubbermold.jpg/200px-Rubbermold.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/Dry_Ice_Bomb.jpg/220px-Dry_Ice_Bomb.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/Liquid_awesome.ppg.jpg/220px-Liquid_awesome.ppg.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["sublimation","phase_transition"],["sublimation","chemistry"],["deposition","physics"],["sublimation","chemistry"],["bait","luring_substance"],["sublimation","chemistry"],["mythbusters","2006_season#episode_57_.e2.80.93_.22diet_coke_and_mentos.22"],["time_warp","tv_series"]],"members":["mythbusters","deposition","time_warp","bait","sublimation"],"related":["British_English","Solid","Carbon_dioxide","Refrigeration","Sublimation_(phase_transition)","Frostbite","Outgassing","Hypercapnia","Carbon_dioxide","Chemical_formula","Oxygen","Atom","Covalent_bond","Carbon","Triple_point","Sublimation_(chemistry)","Deposition_(physics)","Gas","Solid","Density","Coolant","Ice","Enthalpy_of_sublimation","Molecular_dipole_moment","Intermolecular_force","Van_der_Waals_force","Heat_conduction","Electrical_conductivity","Charles_Thilorier","Patent","Industry","Trademark","Air_Liquide","Ammonia","Nitrogen","Natural_gas","Industrial_fermentation","Grocery_store","Laboratory","Refrigeration","Flash_freeze","Carbonated_water","Ice_cream","Rancidity","Sublimation_(chemistry)","Fog_machine","Theater","Discothèque","Haunted_attraction","Nightclub","Fog_machine","Warts","Liquid_nitrogen","Plumber","Bait_(luring_substance)","Mosquito","Bedbugs","Dry_ice_blasting","Compressed_air","Cylinder_liner","Interference_fit","Laboratories","Organic_solvent","Freezing_mixture","Chemical_reactions","Rotary_evaporator","Cloud_seeding","Silver_iodide","Supercooled","Plastic_bottle","Sublimation_(chemistry)","California","Ideal_gas_law","Time_Warp_(TV_series)","Frostbite","Fog","Hypercapnia","List_of_S-phrases","CLP_Regulation","United_States_Department_of_Transportation","International_Air_Transport_Association","List_of_UN_numbers_1801_to_1900","Federal_Aviation_Administration","Checked_baggage","Mariner_4","Mars","California_Institute_of_Technology"]}
