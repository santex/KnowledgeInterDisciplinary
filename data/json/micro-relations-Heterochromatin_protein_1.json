These functions include gene repression by heterochromatin formation,\ntranscriptional activation, regulation of binding of cohesion complexes to\ncentromere, sequesteration of genes to nuclear periphery, transcriptional\narrest, maintenance of heterochromatin integrity, gene repression at single\nnucleosome level and gene repression by heterochromatization of euchromatin. HP1\nproteins are fundamental units of heterochromatin packaging that are enriched at\nthe centromeres and telomeres of nearly all Eukaryotic chromosomes with the\nnotable exception of budding yeast, in which a yeast-specific silencing complex\nof SIR (silent information regulatory) proteins serve a similar function.\nMembers of the HP1 family are characterized by an N-terminal chromodomain and a\nC-terminal chromoshadow domain, separated by a Hinge region. HP1 is also found\nat euchromatic sites, where its binding correlates with gene repression. HP1 was\noriginally discovered byTharappel C James and Sarah Elgin in 1986 as a factor in\nthe phenomenon known as position effect variegation in Drosophila\nmelanogaster. {{cite journal |author=James, T.C. & S.C Elgin\n|title=Identification of a nonhistone chromosomal protein associated with\nheterochromatin in Drosophila melanogaster and its gene |journal=Mol.
