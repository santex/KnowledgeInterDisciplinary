{"cursor":"14462","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\nA 'bicycle chain' is a roller chain that transfers power from the pedals to the\ndrive-wheel of a bicycle, thus propelling it. Most bicycle chains are made from\nplain carbon or alloy steel, but some are nickel-plated to prevent rust, or\nsimply for aesthetics. Nickel also confers a measure of self-lubrication to a\nchain's moving parts. Nickel is a relatively non-galling metal.\n","linknr":303,"url":"Bicycle_chain","recorded":1362476865,"links":28,"instances":["bicycles","mechanics","bicycle_part","physics","mechanism"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Chain drives","Bicycle parts|Chain","Mechanical power transmission","Mechanical power control"],"headings":["History","Efficiency","Maintenance","Wear","Sizes","Variations","Manufacturers","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/Bicycle_chains.JPG/220px-Bicycle_chains.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/03/Chain.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/64/Kettenschutz.png/220px-Kettenschutz.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/Rollenketting.gif/220px-Rollenketting.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/Bicycle_diagram-en.svg/150px-Bicycle_diagram-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["power","physics"],["tension","mechanics"],["pitch","gear#pitch_nomenclature"],["dropout","bicycle_part"],["eccentric","mechanism"],["sram","bicycles"]],"members":["sram","tension","dropout","pitch","power","eccentric"],"related":["Roller_chain","Power_(physics)","Bicycle_pedal","Bicycle_wheel","Bicycle","Steel","Alloy_steel","Nickel-plated","Galling","Block_chain","Skip-link_chain","Simpson_Chain","Tube_Investments_of_India_Limited","Safety_bicycle","Mechanical_advantage","Sprocket","Gear","Bicycle_gearing","Lubrication","Wax","Polytetrafluoroethylene","Solvent","Utility_bicycle","Gear_case","Recumbent_bicycle","Upright_bicycle","Chain_tool","Master_link","Shimano","Campagnolo","SRAM_Corporation","Wippermann","Tension_(mechanics)","Bicycle_drivetrain_systems","Chain_guard","Sprocket","Hub_gear","Fixed-gear_bicycle","Track_bicycle","BMX","Derailleur","Racing_bicycle","Touring_bicycle","Mountain_bike","Single-speed_bicycle","Freight_bicycle","Tricycle","Cogset","Chain_tool","Derailleur_gears","Single-speed_bicycle","Hub_gear","Dropout_(bicycle_part)","Eccentric_(mechanism)","Bottom_bracket","Campagnolo","Rohloff_AG","KMC_Chain_Industrial","Shimano","SRAM_(bicycles)","Wippermann","Bicycle_gearing","Chain_tool","Chainless_bicycle"]}
