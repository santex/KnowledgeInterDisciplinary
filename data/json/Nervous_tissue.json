{"cursor":"4862","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nNervous tissue is the main component of the nervous system - the brain, spinal\ncord, and nerves-which regulates and controls body functions. It is composed of\nneurons, which transmit impulses, and the neuroglia cells, which assist\npropagation of the nerve impulse as well as provide nutrients to the neuron.\n\nNervous tissue is made of nerve cells that come in many varieties, all of which\nare distinctly characteristic by the axon's or long stem like part of the cell\nthat sends action potential signals to the next cell.\n\nFunctions of the nervous system are sensory input, integration, control of\nmuscles and glands, homeostasis, and mental activity.\n\nAll living cells have the ability to react to stimuli. Nervous tissue is\nspecialized to react to stimuli and to conduct impulses to various organs in the\nbody which bring about a response to the stimulus. Nerve tissue (as in the\nbrain, spine cord that is boney and straight and peripheral nerves that branch\nthroughout the body) are all made up of specialized nerve cells called neurons.\nNeurons are easily stimulated and transmit impulses very rapidly. A nerve is\nmade up of many nerve cell fibers (neurons) bound together by connective tissue.\nA sheath of dense connective tissue, the [[epineurium]] surrounds the nerve.\nThis sheath penetrates the nerve to form the [[perineurium]] which surrounds\nbundles of nerve fibers. Blood vessels of various sizes can be seen in the\nepineurium. The endoneurium, which consists of a thin layer of loose connective\ntissue, surrounds the individual nerve fibers.\n\nThe cell body is enclosed by a cell (plasma) membrane and has a central nucleus.\nGranules called [[Nissl bodies]] are found in the cytoplasm of the cell body.\nWithin the cell body, extremely fine neurofibrils extend from the dendrites into\nthe axon. The axon is surrounded by the [[myelin sheath]], which forms a\nwhitish, non-cellular, fatty layer around the axon. Outside the myelin sheath is\na cellular layer called the [[neurilemma]] or sheath of [[Schwann cell]]s. The\nmyelin sheath together with the neurilemma is also known as the [[medullary\nsheath]]. This medullary sheath is interrupted at intervals by the [[nodes of\nRanvier]].\n","linknr":307,"url":"Nervous_tissue","recorded":1362674635,"links":47,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Nervous system","Nervous tissue"],"headings":["Neuronal communication","Classification of neurons","Cancer","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9e/Peripheral_nerve%2C_cross_section.jpg/220px-Peripheral_nerve%2C_cross_section.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Neuron","Neuroglia","Nerve","Nutrients","Action_potential","Muscle","Homeostasis","Neurofibril","Dendrites","Axon","Synapse","Neurotransmitter","Tumor","Glial_cell","Gliomatosis_cerebri","Oligoastrocytoma","Choroid_plexus_papilloma","Ependymoma","Astrocytoma","Pilocytic_astrocytoma","Glioblastoma_multiforme","Dysembryoplastic_neuroepithelial_tumour","Oligodendroglioma","Medulloblastoma","Primitive_neuroectodermal_tumor","Ganglioneuroma","Neuroblastoma","Atypical_teratoid_rhabdoid_tumor","Retinoblastoma","Esthesioneuroblastoma","Neurofibroma","Neurofibrosarcoma","Neurofibromatosis","Schwannoma","Neurinoma","Acoustic_neuroma","Neuroma","Epineurium","Perineurium","Endoneurium","Nerve_fascicle","Connective_tissue_in_the_peripheral_nervous_system"]}
