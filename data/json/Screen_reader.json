Screen readers are a form of assistive technology (AT)\npotentially useful to people who are blind, visually impaired, illiterate or\nlearning disabled, often in combination with other AT, such as screen\nmagnifiers.\n\nA person's choice of screen reader is dictated by many factors, including\nplatform, cost (even to upgrade a screen reader can cost hundreds of U.S.\ndollars), and the role of organizations like charities, schools, and employers.\nScreen reader choice is contentious: differing priorities and strong preferences\nare common.\n\nMicrosoft Windows operating systems have included the Microsoft Narrator light-\nduty screen reader since Windows 2000.
