They are found bound to the outer membrane of\nmitochondria in most cell types in the body. The enzyme was originally\ndiscovered by Mary Bernheim in the liver and was named tyramine oxidase. They belong to the\nprotein family of flavin-containing amine oxidoreductases.\n","linknr":642,"url":"Monoamine_oxidase","recorded":1362668408,"links":34,"instances":["biochemistry","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["EC 1.4.3","Integral membrane proteins"],"headings":["Subtypes and tissue distribution","Function","Substrate specificities","Clinical significance","Genetics","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1e/Monoamine_oxidase_A_2BXS.png/220px-Monoamine_oxidase_A_2BXS.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/MonoamineOxidase-1GOS.png/220px-MonoamineOxidase-1GOS.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Noradrenaline_breakdown.svg/350px-Noradrenaline_breakdown.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cofactor","biochemistry"],["promoter","biology"],["promoter","biology"]],"members":["cofactor","promoter"],"related":["MAOA","Monomer","FAD","Clorgiline","Outer_mitochondrial_membrane","Mitochondrion","MAOA","Monoamine_oxidase_B","Monoamine_oxidase_B","Enzyme","Catalysis","Oxidation","Monoamine","Mitochondria","Mary_Bernheim","Protein_family","Flavin-containing_amine_oxidoreductase","Monoamine_oxidase_A","MAOB","Neuron","Astroglia","Central_nervous_system","Liver","Gastrointestinal_tract","Placenta","Blood","Platelet","Oxidative_deamination","Oxygen","Amine","Aldehyde","Ammonia","Oxidase","Cofactor_(biochemistry)","FAD","Flavoprotein","Enzymes","Pharmacology","Monoamine_oxidase_inhibitor","Drugs","Catabolism","Monoamine_neurotransmitter","Serotonin","Melatonin","Noradrenaline","Adrenaline","Phenethylamine","Benzylamine","Dopamine","Tyramine","Tryptamine","Adrenaline","Noradrenaline","3,4-Dihydroxymandelic_acid","Metanephrine","Normetanephrine","Vanillylmandelic_acid","Dopamine","Dihydroxyphenylacetic_acid","3-Methoxytyramine","Homovanillic_acid","Clinical_depression","Schizophrenia","Substance_abuse","Attention_deficit_disorder","Monoamine_oxidase_inhibitor","Catecholamine","Epinephrine","Norepinephrine","Dopamine","Hypertensive_emergency","Serotonin","Serotonin_syndrome","Alzheimer's_Disease","Parkinson's_Disease","Positron_emission_tomography","Tobacco","Gene","X_chromosome","Brunner_syndrome","Dunedin_cohort","Promoter_(biology)","Conduct_disorder","Conduct_disorder","Sympathetic_nervous_system","Neophilia","Genotype","Genotype","Warrior_gene","MƒÅori_people","Promoter_(biology)","Genetics_and_violence","Imidazoline_receptor"]}
