See also [http://www.who.int/transplantation/xeno/en/ Definition of\nthe World Health Organization] Such cells, tissues or organs are called\n'xenografts' or 'xenotransplants'. In contrast, the term allotransplantation\nrefers to a same-species transplant. Human xenotransplantation offers a\npotential treatment for end-stage organ failure, a significant health problem in\nparts of the industrialized world. It also raises many novel medical, legal and\nethical issues. Many of these are spelled out in Jack M. Kress,\n\"Xenotransplantation: Ethics and Economics,\" 53 Food and Drug Law Journal 208\n(1998). A continuing concern is that many animals, such as pigs, have\nshorter lifespans than humans, meaning that their tissues age at a quicker rate.\nDisease transmission (xenozoonosis) and permanent alteration to the genetic code\nof animals are also causes for concern. There are few published cases of\nsuccessful xenotransplantation.\n","linknr":428,"url":"Xenograft","recorded":1362506238,"links":37,"instances":["anatomy","biology"],"pdf":["http://web.archive.org/web/20080722120810/http://nhmrc.gov.au/about/committees/expert/gtrap/_files/xenotrans.pdf","http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/about/committees/expert/gtrap/_files/xenotrans.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20080722120810/http://nhmrc.gov.au/about/committees/expert/gtrap/_files/xenotrans.pdf","http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/about/committees/expert/gtrap/_files/xenotrans.pdf","http://science.education.nih.gov/newsnapshots/TOC_Xeno/Xenotransplants_Print_This_Iss/XenoPrintThis.pdf"],"categories":["Medical ethics","Animal testing","Life extension"],"headings":["History","Potential future uses","Potential future animal organ donors","Barriers and issues","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg/20px-Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cell","biology"],["organ","anatomy"],["organ","anatomy"]],"members":["organ","cell"],"related":["Greek_language","Organ_transplant","Cell_(biology)","Biological_tissue","Organ_(anatomy)","Species","Allotransplantation","Xenozoonosis","Baby_Fae","Hypoplastic_left_heart_syndrome","Baboon","Leonard_L._Bailey","Loma_Linda_University_Medical_Center","Loma_Linda,_California","Cancer","Diabetes","Liver_failure","Parkinson's_disease","Organ_(anatomy)","Transplant_rejection","Ovarian_tissue","Nude_mouse","SCID_mice","Ovarian_follicles","Cryopreserved","Revascularization","Immune_system","Antibodies","Complement_system","IgM","IgG","IgA","Antigen","Classical_complement_pathway","Thrombosis","Necrosis","CD55","CD46","CD59","Macrophages","Natural_killer_cells","T_cells","Cytokines","Chemokines","E-selectin","ICAM-1","VCAM-1","Major_histocompatibility_complex","Heme_oxygenase-1","Humoral_immune_system","Cellular_immunity","Interleukin_2","Hematopoiesis","Apoptosis","Fibrosis","Arteriosclerosis","Zoonosis","Avian_influenza","Herpesvirus","Rotavirus","Parvovirus","Circovirus","Histocompatibility","Australia","National_Health_and_Medical_Research_Council","Endogenous_retroviruses","Allograft","Medical_grafting","Xenographic","Xenopregnancy"]}
