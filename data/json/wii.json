For\nexample, the primary wireless controller (the Wii Remote<!-- SEE DISCUSSION ON\n\"WIIMOTE\" -->) can be used as a handheld pointing device and detects movement in\nthree dimensions. Another notable feature of the console is WiiConnect24, which\nenables it to receive messages and updates over the Internet while in standby\nmode.<ref name=\"Iwata Speech\n06\">[http://www.nintendo.co.jp/n10/e3_2006/speech/english.html Nintendo\nCorporation] - Nintendo President, Satoru Iwata, media briefing speech at E3\n2006</ref> Furthermore, it is the first console to offer the Virtual Console\nservice, with which select emulated games from past systems can be downloaded.\n\nIt succeeds the Nintendo GameCube, with early models being fully backward-\ncompatible with all GameCube games and most accessories. Nintendo first spoke of\nthe console at the 2004 E3 press conference and later unveiled it at the 2005\nE3. Nintendo CEO Satoru Iwata revealed a prototype of the controller at the\nSeptember 2005 Tokyo Game Show.<ref name=\"TGSspeech\"></ref> At E3 2006, the\nconsole won the first of several awards.<ref name=\"E3 Awards\" /> By December 8,\n2006, it had completed its launch in the four key markets.<!-- Please go to the\ntalk page if you debate any of the following for any reason -->\n\nIn late 2011 Nintendo released a reconfigured model, the \"Wii Family Edition\",\nwhich removed Nintendo GameCube compatibility; this model was not released in\nJapan.
