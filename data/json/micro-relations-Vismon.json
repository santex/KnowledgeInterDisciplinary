{"cursor":"3437","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Vismon' was the Bell Labs system which displayed authors' faces on one of their\ninternal e-mail systems. The name was a pun on the sysmon program used at Bell\nto show the load on computer systems. It can also be interpreted as \"visual\nmonitor\". The system inspired Rich Burridge to develop the similar but more\nwidespread faces system which spread with Unix distributions in the 1980s. [ftp://ftp.uni-magdeburg.de/pub/mirror/hpux.ask.uni-\nkarlsruhe.de/Networking/Mail/faces-1.6.1/faces-1.6.1.README Faces is based on\nthe AT&T v8 face server called vismon, but is not derived from vismon sources.\nWith the previous version came vismon compatibility.], README for faces, the\nvisual list monitor. Version 1.6.1 - November 1991. This in turn inspired\nSteve Kinzler to develop the Picons, or personal icons, which have the goal of\noffering symbols and other images, as well as faces to represent individuals and\ninstitutions in email messages. [http://www.faqs.org/faqs/picons-faq/ Picons\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQ)] Other systems such as the faces\navailable on the LAN email functions of the Nextstep platform also seem to have\nbeen influenced by the original Vismon capabilities. The faces program in Plan 9\nis the direct descendant of this system.\n\nVismon was the work of Rob Pike and Dave\nPresotto. [http://research.google.com/pubs/author4927.html David L.\nPresotto] - Research at Google It was based on some early experiments by\nLuca Cardelli. Many other scientist and engineers of the Computing Science\nResearch Center of the Murray Hill facility were also involved. All had been\nspurred by the introduction in 1983 of the new [[Blit (computer terminal)|Blit]]\ngraphics terminal developed by Pike and Bart Locanthi and marketed by Teletype\nCorporation of Skokie, Illinois as the DMD 5620. Pike was eager, along with his\ncolleagues, to exploit the new graphic capabilities.\n\nPike and company went around their Center, convincing everybody, from directors\nand administrative assistants to engineers and scientists, to pose as they got\nout a 4x5\" view camera with a Polaroid back and took black-and-white photos\n(Polaroid type 52) of their faces. Their efforts yielded nearly 100 faces, which\nthey digitised with a scanner from graphics colleagues. They wrote several\nprograms to transform the faces, store them and serve them on several machines\nat the lab. As time went by they added faces from outside their Center and\noutside Bell Labs. This database also led to the pico image editor (originally\nnamed zunk) which was used for image transformations, many of them with\ncolleagues as the preferred target. [http://spinroot.com/pjw PJW's\nFace]\n\nThe first programs built around vismon were used to announce incoming mail in a\ndedicated window, using the 48 by 48 pixel faces. Later on the faces were also\nused to decorate line printer banners.\n","linknr":104,"url":"Vismon","recorded":1363469771,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Vismon&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Vismon&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/Bell_Labs","/wiki/E-mail","/wiki/Unix","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Steve_Kinzler","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Nextstep","/wiki/Plan_9_from_Bell_Labs","/wiki/Rob_Pike","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Luca_Cardelli","/wiki/Murray_Hill,_New_Jersey","/wiki/Blit_(computer_terminal)","/wiki/Teletype_Corporation","/wiki/Instant_film","/wiki/Zunk","#cite_note-4","/w/index.php?title=Vismon&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","ftp://ftp.uni-magdeburg.de/pub/mirror/hpux.ask.uni-karlsruhe.de/Networking/Mail/faces-1.6.1/faces-1.6.1.README","#cite_ref-2","http://www.faqs.org/faqs/picons-faq/","#cite_ref-3","http://research.google.com/pubs/author4927.html","#cite_ref-4","http://spinroot.com/pjw","/wiki/Rob_Pike","http://doc.cat-v.org/bell_labs/face_the_nation/","/wiki/Gerard_J._Holzmann","http://spinroot.com/pico","/wiki/File:Computer.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d7/Computer.svg/30px-Computer.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vismon&action=edit","/wiki/Template:Compu-stub","/wiki/Template_talk:Compu-stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Compu-stub&action=edit","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vismon&oldid=517379361","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Bell_Labs","/wiki/Category:Computing_stubs","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Vismon&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Vismon","/wiki/Vismon","/wiki/Talk:Vismon","#","/wiki/Vismon","/w/index.php?title=Vismon&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Vismon&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Vismon","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Vismon","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Vismon&oldid=517379361","/w/index.php?title=Vismon&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Vismon&id=517379361","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Vismon","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Vismon&oldid=517379361&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Vismon&printable=yes","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vismon","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=skins.vector&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","/w/index.php?title=MediaWiki:Gadget-ReferenceTooltips.js&action=raw&ctype=text/javascript&508635914","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Bell
