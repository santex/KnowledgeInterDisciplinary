A spin-off\nof a previous attempt to clone Windows 95, development started in early\n1998, and has continued with the incremental addition of features already\nfound in Windows.\n\nReactOS is primarily written in C, with some elements, such as ReactOS Explorer,\nwritten in C++. The project has been ported to the ARM and AMD64 processor\narchitectures, and partially implements Windows API functionality. The latter is\nassisted by including parts from the Wine compatibility layer for Unix-like\noperating systems, but other functionality is implemented by the developers\nthemselves. However, progress has been hampered by a lack of developers with the\nrelevant skill-sets.\n\nAn extensive code audit is in place to protect against legal problems, such that\nimplementation of the Windows API is only done by means of a complete clean room\nreverse engineering process. The audit was initiated following claims made in\n2006 by a former developer that the project contained\ndisassembled assembly code from Windows. The allegations did not conclusively\nprove the existence of âand the audit has not foundâ any legally compromised\ncode, and the claims have not resulted in any adverse legal consequences for the\nproject. Nevertheless, the audit has since been turned into an\nongoing continuous effort as part of a generally cautious approach.\n\nReactOS has been noted for its information on undocumented Windows APIs and more\ngenerally as a potential open-source drop-in replacement for Windows. As stated\non their website, \"The main goal of the ReactOS project is to provide an\noperating system which is binary compatible with Windows ... such that people\naccustomed to the familiar user interface of WindowsÂ® would find using ReactOS\nstraightforward. The ultimate goal of ReactOS is to allow you to remove WindowsÂ®\nand install ReactOS without the end user noticing the change.\"\n","linknr":732,"url":"ReactOS","recorded":1362559529,"links":60,"instances":["programming_language","computer_graphics","computing","software","operating_system","software","software"],"pdf":["https://www.linux-magazine.com/w3/issue/40/Free_Software_Projects.pdf","https://www.linux-magazine.com/w3/issue/40/Free_Software_Projects.pdf","http://mirror.csclub.uwaterloo.ca/csclub/alex-ionescu.pdf","http://mirror.csclub.uwaterloo.ca/csclub/alex-ionescu.pdf"],"categories":["Alpha
