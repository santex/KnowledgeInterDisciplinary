{"cursor":"39100","size":14,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" image of pollen]]\n\n'Microscopy' is the technical field of using microscopes to view samples and\nobjects that cannot be seen with the unaided eye (objects that are not within\nthe resolution range of the normal eye). There are three well-known branches of\nmicroscopy: optical, electron, and scanning probe microscopy.\n\nOptical and electron microscopy involve the diffraction, reflection, or\nrefraction of electromagnetic radiation/electron beams interacting with the\nspecimen, and the subsequent collection of this scattered radiation or another\nsignal in order to create an image. This process may be carried out by wide-\nfield irradiation of the sample (for example standard light microscopy and\ntransmission electron microscopy) or by scanning of a fine beam over the sample\n(for example confocal laser scanning microscopy and scanning electron\nmicroscopy). Scanning probe microscopy involves the interaction of a scanning\nprobe with the surface of the object of interest. The development of microscopy\nrevolutionized biology and remains an essential technique in the life and\nphysical sciences.\n","linknr":522,"url":"Microscopy","recorded":1362902564,"links":44,"instances":["electromagnetic_radiation","optics","wave_propagation","vision","microscopy","optics","biology","physics","microscope","waves","physics"],"pdf":["http://www.kip.uni-heidelberg.de/AG_Cremer/pdf-files/Cremer_Micros_Acta_1978.pdf","http://pubs.acs.org/subscribe/journals/ancham/79/i05/pdf/0307feature_willis.pdf"],"categories":["Microscopy|","Microbiology
