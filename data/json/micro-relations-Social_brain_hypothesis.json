These are relationships in\nwhich an individual knows who each person is, and how each person relates to\nevery other person. Proponents assert that numbers larger than this\ngenerally require more restrictive rules, laws, and enforced norms to maintain a\nstable, cohesive group. It has been proposed to lie between 100 and 230, with a\ncommonly used value of 150. Dunbar's number states the\nnumber of people one knows and keeps social contact with, and it does not\ninclude the number of people known personally with a ceased social relationship,\nnor people just generally known with a lack of persistent social relationship, a\nnumber which might be much higher and likely depends on long-term memory size.\n\nDunbar's number was first proposed by British anthropologist Robin Dunbar, who\ntheorized that \"this limit is a direct function of relative neocortex size, and\nthat this in turn limits group size ... the limit imposed by neocortical\nprocessing capacity is simply on the number of individuals with whom a stable\ninter-personal relationship can be maintained.\" On the periphery, the number\nalso includes past colleagues such as high school friends with whom a person\nwould want to reacquaint themself if they met again.\n","linknr":275,"url":"Social_brain_hypothesis","recorded":1362373306,"links":33,"instances":["computer_gaming","author","military_unit"],"pdf":["http://www.ucis.pitt.edu/clas/events/gap_conference/VirtualResistanceInternetMediatedNetworks-Themudo.pdf","http://www.ucis.pitt.edu/clas/events/gap_conference/VirtualResistanceInternetMediatedNetworks-Themudo.pdf"],"categories":["Evolutionary psychology","Interpersonal relationships","Human evolution","Primatology","Sociological theories"],"headings":["Research background","Alternative numbers","Popularization","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["company","military_unit"],["david_wong","author"],["guild","computer_gaming"]],"members":["guild","david_wong","company"],"related":["Cognition","Interpersonal_relationship","Individual","Social_group","Long-term_memory","United_Kingdom","Anthropology","Robin_Dunbar","Neocortex","Friendship","Primatologist","Primate","Social_grooming","Clique","Genera","Pleistocene","Anthropological","Ethnographical","Hunterâ€“gatherer","Band_society","Kinship","Tribe","Village","Neolithic","Hutterite","Armies","Ancient_Rome","Modern_world","Company_(military_unit)","Subsistence_farming","Nomad","War","Language","Evolutionary_psychology","Statistics","Business_management","Social_software","Unit_cohesion","Social_networking_service","H._Russell_Bernard","Peter_Killworth","Median","Social_network","Anarchy","Politics","Tragedy_of_the_commons","Virtual_communities","MMORPG","Ultima_Online","Social_network_service","Website","Facebook","MySpace","Sweden","Neologism","David_Wong_(author)","Allen_curve","Continuum_concept","Guild_(computer_gaming)"]}
