The principles of naming vary\nfrom the relatively informal conventions of everyday speech to the internationally-\nagreed principles, rules and recommendations that govern the formation and use\nof the specialist terms used in scientific and other disciplines.\n\nNaming \"things\" is a part of our general communication using words and language:\nit is an aspect of everyday taxonomy as we distinguish the objects of our\nexperience, together with their similarities and differences, which we identify,\nname and . The use of names, as the many different kinds of nouns embedded in\ndifferent languages, connects nomenclature to theoretical linguistics, while the\nway we mentally structure the world in relation to word meanings and experience\nrelates to the philosophy of language.\n\nOnomastics, the study of proper names and their origins, includes: anthroponymy,\nconcerned with human names, including personal names, surnames and nicknames;\ntoponymy the study of place names; and etymology, the derivation, history and\nuse of names as revealed through comparative and descriptive linguistics.\n\nThe scientific need for simple, stable and internationally-accepted systems for\nnaming objects of the natural world has generated many formal nomenclatural\nsystems. Probably the best known of these nomenclatural systems are the five\ncodes of biological nomenclature that govern the Latinized scientific names of\norganisms.\n","linknr":701,"url":"nomenclature","recorded":1362572478,"links":39,"instances":["geography","language_use","business","biology","term"],"pdf":["http://www.collegenaturalmedicine.com/images/LBA/redcellnomenclature.pdf"],"categories":["Names","Naming conventions","Nomenclature|"],"headings":["Definition & criteria","Etymology","Onomastics and nomenclature","Naming as a cultural activity","Names and nouns","Scientific nomenclature","See also","References","External links","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["procedure","term"],["identification","information"],["context","language_use"],["location","geography"],["product","business"],["identification","biology"]],"members":["location","context","product","identification","procedure"],"related":["Principle","Procedure_(term)","Terminology","Naming","Naming_conventions","Communication","Word","Language","Taxonomy","Identification_(information)","Noun","Theoretical_linguistics","Philosophy_of_language","Onomastics","Proper_names","Anthroponymy","Personal_names","Surnames","Nicknames","Toponymy","Etymology","Comparative_linguistics","Descriptive_linguistics","Biological_nomenclature","Latin","Scientific_name","Organism","Latin","Name","Ancient_Greek","Old_English","Old_High_German","Sanskrit","Name","Onomastics","Map","Mind","Philosopher","Linguist","Kent_Bach","Semantics","Peter_H._Raven","Brent_Berlin","Biological_classification","Nested_hierarchy","Folk_taxonomy","Annual_plant","Biennial_plant","Perennial_plant","Vegetable","Fruit","Culinary_herb","Spice","Herb","Tree","Shrub","Weed","Ethnobiology","Bronislaw_Malinowski","Claude_Lévi-Strauss","Ethnobiology","Ethnotaxonomy","Brent_Berlin","Peter_H._Raven","Émile_Durkheim","Lucien_Lévy-Brühl","Binomial","Binomial_nomenclature","Noun","Category_of_being","Context_(language_use)","Human","Organism","Location_(geography)","Product_(business)","Brand","Idea","Concept","Proto-Indo-European_language","Lexical_category","Personal_names","Binomial","Christian_name","Given_name","Forename","First_name","England","Celt","Anglo-Saxon","Scandinavia","Nickname","Second_name","Last_name","Family_name","Surname","Byname","Nickname","Hypocoristic","Proper_name","Common_name","London_Bridge","Bridge","Collective_noun","Grammatical_number","Concrete_noun","Abstract_noun","Pronoun","Noun_phrase","House_style","-onym","Hydronym","Synonym","Hydronymy","Cartography","Myth","Venus","Neptune","Taxonomy","Taxonomic_classification","Vernon_Heywood","Taxa","Charles_Talbut_Onions","Identification_(biology)","Taxa","Taxon","Vernon_Heywood","Linnaeus","Binomial_nomenclature","Species_Plantarum","Systema_Naturae","Biological_nomenclature","Botanical_nomenclature","Virus_classification","Phylogenetic_nomenclature","Gene_nomenclature","Medical_devices","Global_Medical_Device_Nomenclature","Astronomical_naming_conventions","Planetary_nomenclature","Meteorite_Nomenclature","International_Astronomical_Union","Chemical_compound","Chemistry","International_Union_of_Pure_and_Applied_Chemistry","Organic_compound","Inorganic_compound","Symbol","Physical_quantity","IUPAP","Biochemistry","IUBMB","Analytical_chemistry","Macromolecular_chemistry","Scientific_journal","International_Union_of_Pure_and_Applied_Chemistry","Weights_and_measures","International_Union_of_Biochemistry_and_Molecular_Biology","British_Approved_Name","Controlled_vocabulary","Human_resource_management","Library_catalog","Medical_classification","Metadata","Naming_convention","Retroactive_nomenclature","Terminology","Onomastics","Ontology_engineering"]}
