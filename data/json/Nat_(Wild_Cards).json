Most often used by Jokers when referring to\ntheir uninfected oppressors, though also occasionally employed by Aces as a\npejorative. Fleur van Rensselaer (daughter of the ace Brain Trust) once observed\nthat, though the term is short for \"natural,\" it has another secondary meaning\nas a homonym - \"gnats,\" which reveals how some wild carders feel about non\npowered humans.
