The most common type of pancreatic\ncancer, accounting for 95% of these tumors, is adenocarcinoma (tumors exhibiting\nglandular architecture on light microscopy) arising within the exocrine\ncomponent of the pancreas. A minority arise from islet cells, and are classified\nas neuroendocrine tumors. The signs and symptoms that eventually lead to the\ndiagnosis depend on the location, the size, and the tissue type of the tumor,\nand may include abdominal pain, lower back pain, and jaundice (if the tumor\ncompresses the bile duct).\n\nPancreatic cancer is the fourth most common cause of cancer-related deaths in\nthe United States and the eighth worldwide. http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/cancer-\ninfo/cancerstats/world/the-global-picture/cancer-overall-world#source2\nPancreatic cancer has an extremely poor prognosis: for all stages combined, the\n1- and 5-year relative survival rates are 25% and 6%, respectively; for local disease the 5-year survival is approximately 20% National Cancer Institute.
