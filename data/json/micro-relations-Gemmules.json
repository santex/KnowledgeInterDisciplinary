This appeared in his book [[The Variation of\nAnimals and Plants under Domestication]], published in 1868, nine years after\nthe publication of his famous book [[On the Origin of Species]].\n\nGemmules, also called plastitudes or pangenes, were assumed to be shed by the\norgans of the body and carried in the bloodstream to the reproductive organs\nwhere they accumulated in the germ cells or gametes. They thus provided a\npossible mechanism for the inheritance of acquired characteristics, as proposed\nby Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, which Darwin believed to be a cause of the observed\nvariation in living organisms.\n\nThis was prior to Gregor Mendel's discovery of the particulate nature of\ninheritance becoming common knowledge among biologists after their\nrediscovery in 1900.\n","linknr":102,"url":"Gemmules","recorded":1362374033,"links":15,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["History of biology","History of evolutionary biology"],"headings":["Quotes","See also","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Charles_Darwin","Pangenesis","Plastitudes","Pangenesis","Gametes","Jean-Baptiste_Lamarck","Gregor_Mendel","Mendelian_inheritance","Biologist","E._Janet_Browne","Modern_evolutionary_synthesis","August_Weismann","Francis_Galton"]}
