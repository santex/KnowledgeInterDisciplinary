Whereas basophilic white\nblood cells stain dark blue and eosinophilic white blood cells stain bright red,\nneutrophils stain a neutral pink. Normally, neutrophils contain a nucleus\ndivided into 2â5 lobes.\n\nNeutrophils are normally found in the blood stream.

They migrate through the blood\nvessels, then through tissue, following chemical signals such as Interleukin-8\n(IL-8), C5a, fMLP and Leukotriene B4 in a process called chemotaxis. They are\nthe predominant cells in pus, accounting for its whitish/yellowish appearance.\n\nNeutrophils are recruited to the site of injury within minutes following trauma\nand are the hallmark of acute inflammation.
