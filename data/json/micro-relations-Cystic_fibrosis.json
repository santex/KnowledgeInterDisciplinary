It is characterized by abnormal transport of\nchloride and sodium across an epithelium, leading to thick, viscous\nsecretions.\n\nThe name cystic fibrosis refers to the characteristic scarring (fibrosis) and\ncyst formation within the pancreas, first recognized in the 1930s. Difficulty breathing is the most serious symptom and\nresults from frequent lung infections that are treated with antibiotics and\nother medications. Other symptoms, including sinus infections, poor growth, and\ninfertility affect other parts of the body.\n\nCF is caused by a mutation in the gene for the protein cystic fibrosis\ntransmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). This protein is required to regulate\nthe components of sweat, digestive fluids, and mucus. CFTR regulates the\nmovement of chloride and sodium ions across epithelial membranes, such as the\nalveolar epithelia located in the lungs. Although most people without CF have\ntwo working copies of the CFTR gene, only one is needed to prevent cystic\nfibrosis due to the disorder's recessive nature. CF develops when neither gene\nworks normally (as a result of mutation) and therefore has autosomal recessive\ninheritance.\n\nCF is most common among Caucasians; one in 25 people of European descent carries\none allele for CF. The World Health\nOrganization states that \"In the European Union, 1 in 2000â3000 newborns is\nfound to be affected by CF\". Individuals with cystic fibrosis can be\ndiagnosed before birth by genetic testing, or by a sweat test in early\nchildhood. Ultimately, lung transplantation is often necessary as CF worsens.\n","linknr":1746,"url":"Cystic_fibrosis","recorded":1362511560,"links":82,"instances":["biology","medical","gene","genetics","geneticist","epidemiology","medical_disorder","genetics","biology","medicine","biology"],"pdf":["http://www.rcjournal.com/contents/05.09/05.09.0641.pdf","http://www.rcjournal.com/contents/05.09/05.09.0641.pdf","http://www.icmr.nic.in/ijmr/2009/april/0403.pdf","http://www.icmr.nic.in/ijmr/2009/april/0403.pdf","http://www.rcjournal.com/contents/05.09/05.09.0595.pdf","http://www.rcjournal.com/contents/05.09/05.09.0595.pdf","http://www.cysticfibrosis.ca/assets/files/pdf/CPDR_ReportE.pdf","http://www.cysticfibrosis.ca/assets/files/pdf/CPDR_ReportE.pdf","http://www.cff.org/UploadedFiles/research/ClinicalResearch/Patient-Registry-Report-2009.pdf","http://www.cff.org/UploadedFiles/research/ClinicalResearch/Patient-Registry-Report-2009.pdf"],"categories":["Channelopathy","Autosomal
