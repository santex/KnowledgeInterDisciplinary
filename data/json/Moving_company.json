Typically they\nuse moving vans, but for international moves or where storage is required, they\nmay use special containerised vans or shipping containers.\n\nNational companies are typically organized with local branches or affiliated\nagents. That affiliation may be in the form of a franchise, wherein the local\nagent is a franchise of a national company, or a cooperative, wherein the local\nagent owns a share of the national company. There are also many small\nindependent moving companies which operate within any given local area. In the\nUnited States, all legitimate interstate moving companies must be licensed with\nthe Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration. About half the states regulate\nlocal, or intrastate movers.\n\nEmbedded within the moving industry are the services of truck/trailer/moving\nequipment rental companies and companies selling moving supplies for people who\nwant to pack and move themselves. Then they use a professional mover to load a\nmoving van, drive it to the new residence and then unload it there. Rental\ncompanies usually offer some training information for DIY movers who will be\nusing their rental trucks, trailers or equipment to relocate themselves.\n\nSome people obtain packing supplies to pack their household goods themselves to\nkeep their moving costs down. They are called PBOs (packed by owner) by their\nmovers. Because they are not trained to properly pack their things, damages are\nmore prevalent with their shipments.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, 40 million Americans have moved annually\nover the last decade.\n","linknr":306,"url":"Moving_company","recorded":1362580231,"links":25,"instances":["vehicle"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Moving and relocation","Moving companies|","Truck rental"],"headings":["Moving","Price estimates","Self service and DIY","Brokers","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/Demenagement_1887.jpg/220px-Demenagement_1887.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/63/Alex_Pickering_van.jpg/220px-Alex_Pickering_van.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f1/Umzugslift.jpg/220px-Umzugslift.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Piano_Removals_In_Christchurch.jpg/220px-Piano_Removals_In_Christchurch.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Wikibooks-logo-en-noslogan.svg/40px-Wikibooks-logo-en-noslogan.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7e/American_truck.JPG/90px-American_truck.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["trailer","vehicle"]],"members":["trailer"],"related":["Shipping_container","Franchising","Cooperative","Federal_Motor_Carrier_Safety_Administration","U.S._Census_Bureau","Luton_body","Sash_window","Piano_trolley","Do-it-yourself","Australia","New_Zealand","UK","Truck","Trailer_(vehicle)","Shipping_container","List_of_national_and_international_moving_associations","Moving_scam","Relocation_services","Structure_relocation"]}
