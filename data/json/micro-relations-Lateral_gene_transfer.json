Also termed lateral\ngene transfer, it contrasts with [[vertical transfer]], the transmission of\ngenes from the parental generation to offspring via sexual or asexual\nreproduction. HGT has been shown to be an important factor in the evolution of\nmany organisms, including bacteria, plants and humans.\n\nHorizontal gene transfer is the primary reason for bacterial antibiotic\nresistance, OECD, Safety Assessment of Transgenic Organisms, Volume 4: OECD\nConsensus Documents, 2010, pp.171-174 and\nplays an important role in the evolution of bacteria that can degrade novel\ncompounds such as human-created pesticides and in the evolution,\nmaintenance, and transmission of virulence. This horizontal gene\ntransfer often involves temperate bacteriophages and plasmids. Genes\nthat are responsible for antibiotic resistance in one species of bacteria can be\ntransferred to another species of bacteria through various mechanisms (e.g., via\nF-pilus), subsequently arming the antibiotic resistant genes' recipient against\nantibiotics, which is becoming a medical challenge to deal with. This is the\nmost critical reason that antibiotics must not be consumed and administered to\npatients without appropriate prescription from a medical physician.\n\nMost thinking in genetics has focused upon vertical transfer, but there is a\ngrowing awareness that horizontal gene transfer is a highly significant\nphenomenon and amongst single-celled organisms perhaps the dominant form of\ngenetic transfer.\n\nArtificial horizontal gene transfer is a form of genetic engineering.\n","linknr":777,"url":"Lateral_gene_transfer","recorded":1362511434,"links":55,"instances":["genetics","science","genetics","genetics","biology","genetics"],"pdf":["http://www.dcn.davis.ca.us/vme/hgt/JTheoBiolvol112pp333-343yr1985.PDF","http://www.dcn.davis.ca.us/vme/hgt/JTheoBiolvol112pp333-343yr1985.PDF","http://www.sdsc.edu/~shindyal/ejc121304.pdf","http://www.sdsc.edu/~shindyal/ejc121304.pdf","http://www.i-sis.org.uk/pdf/CaMV_promoter_recipe_for_disaster.pdf","http://www.i-sis.org.uk/pdf/CaMV_promoter_recipe_for_disaster.pdf","http://www.sdsc.edu/~shindyal/ejc121304.pdf","http://www.sdsc.edu/~shindyal/ejc121304.pdf","http://www.cbcb.umd.edu/~salzberg/docs/ScienceLateralTransfer.pdf","http://www.cbcb.umd.edu/~salzberg/docs/ScienceLateralTransfer.pdf","http://www.stat.rice.edu/~mathbio/Ochman2000.pdf"],"categories":["Genetics","Microbial population biology","Antibiotic resistance"],"headings":["History","Mechanism","Viruses","Prokaryotes","Eukaryotes","Artificial horizontal gene transfer","Importance in evolution","See also","Sources and notes","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/Horizontal-gene-transfer.jpg/220px-Horizontal-gene-transfer.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["transformation","genetics"],["cell","biology"],["expression","genetics"],["transduction","genetics"],["coalescence","genetics"],["tree_of_life","science"],["tree_of_life","science"]],"members":["coalescence","tree_of_life","expression","transduction","cell","transformation"],"related":["Genes","Reproduction","Antibiotic_resistance","Bacteriophage","Plasmids","Pilus","Genetics","Genetic_engineering","Diphtheria","Lysogenic_cycle","Bacteria","Prokaryote","Unicellular","Eukaryote","Protist","Unicellular","Multicellular","Genetically_modified_organism","DNA","Transformation_(genetics)","Cell_(biology)","Expression_(genetics)","DNA","RNA","Eukaryote","Molecular_biology","Biotechnology","Transduction_(genetics)","Phage","Bacterial_conjugation","Gene_transfer_agent","Alphaproteobacteria","Rhodobacterales","Virus","Amoebae","Genome","Gene","Mamavirus","Satellite_virus","Bacteriophage","Bacteria","Bacteria","Drug_resistance","Exotoxin","Gene","Species","Phylogenetic","DNA_sequence","Eukaryote","Endosymbiotic_theory","Chloroplast","Mitochondrium","Endosymbiont","Fungi","Callosobruchus_chinensis","Callosobruchus_chinensis","Bean_weevil","Filarial_nematodes","Nematode","Mitochondrial_gene","Rafflesiaceae","Heterokont","Eudicot","Sorghum","University_of_Arizona","Pea_aphid","Fungus","Carotenoid","Aphid","Malaria","Pathogen","Prokaryotes","Eukaryotes","Bacteriophage","Genetic_engineering","Sleeping_Beauty_transposon_system","Organism","Lurking_variable","Phylogenetic_tree","Sequence","Gene","New_Scientist","Phylogenetic_tree","Prokaryote","16s_rRNA","Johann_Peter_Gogarten","Phylogenetic_network","Gene","Phylogenetic_marker","Phylogeny","Coalescence_(genetics)","Cladogenesis","Most_recent_common_ancestor","Life","Molecule","Cenancestor","Ford_Doolittle","Last_Universal_Common_Ancestor","Endosymbiont","Eukaryote","RNA","Carl_Woese","Tree_of_life_(science)","Archaea","Life","Phylogenetic","Enzyme","HMGCoA_reductase","Mitochondria","Eukaryote","Alpha-proteobacteria","Chloroplast","Cyanobacteria","Germ_cell","Bacteria","Archaea","Eukaryote","Gene","Last_Universal_Common_Ancestor","Lycopene","Cyclase","Carotenoid","Biosynthesis","Chlorobi","Cyanobacteria","Tetracycline","Agrobacterium","Endogenous_retrovirus","Integron","Provirus","Retrotransposon","Genetically_modified_organism","Mobile_genetic_elements","Tree_of_life_(science)","Phylogenetic_tree","Phylogenetic_network","Phylogenetics"]}
