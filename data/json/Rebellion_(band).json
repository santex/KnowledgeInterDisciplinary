It was formed in 2001 when guitarist\nUwe Lulis left Grave Digger in 2000, taking ex-Grave Digger bassist Tomi\nGÃ¶ttlich with him. Their first album was a concept album about\nWilliam Shakespeare's work [[Macbeth]], and included spoken passages with\nmembers of the band and other people as the story's characters.\n\nThe second album involved more standard heavy-metal lyrics – about\nmotorcycles, metal, war, etc. – and the music was somewhat rougher.\n\nIn 2005 they released the first part of what is intended to be a trilogy about\nthe Vikings and Norse mythology. In the beginning of 2007 they released their\nsecond part in the trilogy about the Vikings. It was titled \"Miklagard\" and was\nthe band's most successful album so far. In 2009 the band released the album\nArise: From Ginnungagap to RagnarÃ¶k, the third and last part of the trilogy.\n\nEx-drummer Randy Black is now playing in Primal Fear. Ex-guitarist BjÃ¶rn Eilen\nis now playing in Silver Maiden and The Talkies.\n\nIn late 2010, three members of the band, Uwe Lulis, Gerd LÃ¼cking, and Simone\nWenzel, departed, leaving the remaining two members with the band in their\nhands.\n","linknr":152,"url":"Rebellion_(band)","recorded":1362689090,"links":21,"instances":["band","music","band"],"pdf":[],"categories":["German musical groups","German power metal musical groups","Musical groups established in 2001"],"headings":["Personnel","Discography","External links","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/82/MusicalnotesGermany.png/35px-MusicalnotesGermany.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["band","music"],["grave_digger","band"],["primal_fear","band"]],"members":["grave_digger","band","primal_fear"],"related":["Germany","Heavy_metal_music","Power_metal","Massacre_Records","Uwe_Lulis","Randy_Black","Germany","Power_metal","Band_(music)","Guitar","Uwe_Lulis","Grave_Digger_(band)","Bassist","Concept_album","William_Shakespeare","Viking","Norse_mythology","Primal_Fear_(band)","Singing","Bass_guitar","Guitar","Guitar","Drum_kit","Randy_Black","Uwe_Lulis","Guitar","Guitar","Drum_kit","Drum_kit"]}
