As of November\n| 2010, around 150,000 such titles have been produced. In June 2010, VDM started\n| its own online-bookshop: MoreBooks! Publishing.\n\nVDM's publishing methods have received criticism for the soliciting of\nmanuscripts from thousands of individuals, for providing non-notable authors\nwith the appearance of a peer-reviewed publishing history, for benefiting from\nthe free contributions of online volunteers, and for insufficiently disclosing\nthe free nature of their content. VDM responds that Wikipedia is a valuable,\nquality resource, that the company has no problem asking authors for content,\nthat buyers are informed of where information comes from, that books are a\nconvenient form to collect articles about interesting subjects, and that its\ncustomers are satisfied with VDM's products. {{Cite web | last = Ghanty |\nfirst = Reezwan| title = Letter reproduced in: Massage-Research.com - A Letter\nfrom AlphaScript\n| work = Massage-Research.com| accessdate = 2011-08-19| date = 2011-04-30| url =\n| http://www.massage-research.com/blog/?p=1215 |archiveurl =\n| http://www.webcitation.org/613SdJN6V | archivedate = 2011-08-19}}\n","linknr":1061,"url":"Tract_(imprint)","recorded":1362689265,"links":60,"instances":[],"pdf":["//commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Alphascript_Publishing_book_by_Miller_FP_Vandome_AF_McBrewster_J._A_scanned_example._History_of_Ghana._Copy_and_paste_from_wikipedia.pdf","http://www.vdm-verlag.de/downloads/old/unternehmensprofil.pdf","http://www.vdm-verlag.de/downloads/old/VDM-company-profile.pdf","http://www.vdm-publishing.com/downloads/VDM-company-profile.pdf","http://www.vdm-publishing.com/downloads/Interview-DrMueller-engl.pdf"],"categories":["Book publishing companies of Germany","Book publishing companies of Mauritius","Book selling websites","Wikipedia derived encyclopedias","Companies established in 2002"],"headings":["History","Products and services","Wikipedia content duplication","VDM Group subsidiaries","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f8/VDM_Verlag.svg/143px-VDM_Verlag.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a8/Alphascript_publishing_logo.jpg/200px-Alphascript_publishing_logo.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/75/Betascript_Publishing_logo.jpg/100px-Betascript_Publishing_logo.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/18/Fastbook_Publishing_logo.png/150px-Fastbook_Publishing_logo.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/cc/VDM_Publishing_House_ltd._Mauritian_subsidiary_of_VDM_Group._Logo.png/150px-VDM_Publishing_House_ltd._Mauritian_subsidiary_of_VDM_Group._Logo.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f0/Alphascript_Publishing_book_by_Miller_FP_Vandome_AF_McBrewster_J._A_scanned_example._History_of_Ghana._Copy_and_paste_from_wikipedia.pdf/page1-170px-Alphascript_Publishing_book_by_Miller_FP_Vandome_AF_McBrewster_J._A_scanned_example._History_of_Ghana._Copy_and_paste_from_wikipedia.pdf.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Saarbrücken","World","Chief_executive_officer","Publishing","Publishing_company","Saarbrücken","Argentina","Villa_María","Latvia","Mauritius","Moldova","Print_on_demand","Imprint","Wikipedia","E-commerce","Amazon.com","Publishing_house","Düsseldorf","Lightning_Source","Amazon.com","Chief_executive_officer","German_language","Russian_language","Spanish_language","French_language","Dissertation","Thesis","Acquisitions_Editor","Internet","E-mail","Hyde,_Cheshire","Master's_thesis","Doctoral_dissertation","CNRS","Grenoble","Peer_reviewed","Higher_Education_Research_Data_Collection","Charles_Sturt_University","Religion","Spirituality","Christian_theology","European_Union","Kindle_books","Manuscript","Berner_Zeitung","Victoria_Strauss","Author_mill","Writer_Beware","Pagan_Kennedy","Kudzu","Imprints","Wikipedia","Ingram_Content_Group","XING","Lightning_Source","Business_partner","Free_of_charge","Bookvika_Publishing","Saarbrücken","Beau-Bassin","Mauritius","Dortmund","Chişinău","Moldova","Books_LLC","Philip_M._Parker","Print_on_demand"]}
