It was a\n585 mm (23 in) diameter shiny metal sphere, with four external radio\nantennae to broadcast radio pulses. The Soviet Union launched it into an\nelliptical low Earth orbit on 4 October 1957. It was visible all around the\nEarth and its radio pulses detectable. The surprise success precipitated the\nAmerican Sputnik crisis, began the Space Age and triggered the Space Race, a\npart of the larger Cold War. The launch ushered in new political, military,\ntechnological, and scientific developments. [http://www.america-\nnheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2010/4/2010_4_88.shtml Walter A.

The density of the upper atmosphere\ncould be deduced from its drag on the orbit, and the propagation of its radio\nsignals gave information about the ionosphere.\n\nSputnik 1 was launched during the International Geophysical Year from Site\nNo.1/5, at the 5th Tyuratam range, in Kazakh SSR (now at the Baikonur\nCosmodrome). The satellite travelled at about 29,000 kilometers (18,000 mi)\nper hour, taking 96.2 minutes to complete each orbit.
