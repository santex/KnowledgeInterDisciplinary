He is best known for his unique radio and television advertisements for\nthe 'Worthington Dealership Group'. In these advertisements, he was usually\njoined by \"his dog Spot,\" except that \"Spot\" was never a dog. Often, Spot was\neither a tiger, a seal, an elephant, a chimpanzee, or a bear. In one ad, \"Spot\"\nwas a hippopotamus, which Worthington rode in the commercial. On some occasions,\n\"Spot\" was a vehicle, such as an airplane that Worthington would be seen\nstanding atop the wings of while airborne. \"Spot\" was officially retired in the\nmid 1980s, however he is mentioned in some commercials today.\n\nAccording to a profile published in the [[Sacramento Bee]] in 1990, Worthington\ngrossed in 1988, making him at the time the largest single owner of a car\ndealership chain. His advertising agency, named 'Spot Advertising', had\nWorthington as its only client and spent on commercials, the most of any auto\ndealer at the time. He has sold automobiles since 1945 and owns a  ranch located in Orland, California, north of Sacramento.\n","linknr":256,"url":"Cal_Worthington","recorded":1362892313,"links":14,"instances":["1974_film","united_states","united_states","hat","state"],"pdf":[],"categories":["1920 births","Auto dealerships","Civilian Conservation Corps people","Companies based in Los Angeles County, California","Living people","People from Corpus Christi, Texas","People from Glenn County, California","People from Los Angeles, California","People from Osage County, Oklahoma","Salespeople","United States Army Air Forces officers","United States Army Air Forces pilots of World War II","Recipients of the Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)"],"headings":["Early life","Business career","Personal life","In popular culture","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/69/P_vip.svg/28px-P_vip.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["captain","united_states"],["distinguished_flying_cross","united_states"],["washington","state"],["fearsome_foursome","american_football#los_angeles_rams"],["fez","hat"],["gone_in_60_seconds","1974_film"]],"members":["gone_in_60_seconds","distinguished_flying_cross","captain","fez","fearsome_foursome","washington"],"related":["Shidler,_Oklahoma","Automobile_dealer","United_States","Car_dealer","West_Coast_of_the_United_States","Radio","Television","Orland,_California","California","Sacramento","Shidler,_Oklahoma","Oklahoma","Civilian_Conservation_Corps","United_States_Army","World_War_II","United_States_Army_Air_Corps","Second_Lieutenant","Goodfellow_Field","San_Angelo,_Texas","B-17_Flying_Fortress","Captain_(United_States)","Air_Medal","Distinguished_Flying_Cross_(United_States)","Jimmy_Doolittle","Corpus_Christi,_Texas","Huntington_Park,_California","California","Hudson_Motor_Car","Country_music","KTLA","German_Shepherd_dog","Gorilla","Anchorage","Alaska","Phoenix,_Arizona","Arizona","Carlsbad,_California","Claremont,_California","Folsom,_California","Long_Beach,_California","Sacramento","South_Gate,_California","California","Reno,_Nevada","Houston","Sugar_Land","Texas","Federal_Way","Washington_(state)","Construction_of_the_Trans-Alaska_Pipeline_System","Lincoln–Mercury","Earl_\"Madman\"_Muntz","Jingle","If_You're_Happy_and_You_Know_It","Killer_whale","SeaWorld","Lion","Elephant","Goose","Tiger","Snake","Rhinoceros","Skunk","Bear","Chimpanzee","Carabao","Hippopotamus","Deacon_Jones","NFL","Los_Angeles_Rams","Hollywood","Anna_Mjöll","Northern_California","Orland,_California","California","Thomas_Kearns","Bing_Crosby","Johnny_Carson","Marty_Feldman","Ed_McMahon","Avery_Schreiber","Fez_(hat)","Gone_in_60_Seconds_(1974_film)","Robert_Calvert","Hannibal","Blizzard_Entertainment","Shidler,_Oklahoma","Oklahoma"]}
