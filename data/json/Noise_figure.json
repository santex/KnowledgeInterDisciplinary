{"cursor":"5712","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Noise figure' (NF) and 'noise factor' (F) are measures of degradation of the\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR), caused by components in a radio frequency (RF)\nsignal chain. It is a number by which the performance of a radio receiver can be\nspecified.\n\nThe noise factor is defined as the ratio of the output noise power of a device\nto the portion thereof attributable to thermal noise in the input termination at\nstandard noise temperature T 0 (usually 290Â K). The noise factor\nis thus the ratio of actual output noise to that which would remain if the\ndevice itself did not introduce noise, or the ratio of input SNR to output SNR.\n\nThe noise figure is simply the noise factor expressed in decibels\n(dB). http://www.satsig.net/noise.htm\n","linknr":216,"url":"Noise_figure","recorded":1362371285,"links":22,"instances":["signal_processing","electronics","signal_processing_chain","electronic"],"pdf":["http://cp.literature.agilent.com/litweb/pdf/5952-8255E.pdf","http://cp.literature.agilent.com/litweb/pdf/5952-8255E.pdf"],"categories":["Noise","Radar signal processing"],"headings":["General","Definition","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/7/0/4707d5d761ac4259d83f3798e09ab9a8.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/9/3/9/939b975eefa39d79a8a778b1bc0eea06.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/c/c/9/cc9760cd1e5eb3fc8bffc98a1b7d4d20.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/7/7/47781ac01e60e30616b800e4dd18fa1c.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/9/5/495f009aa7b2484d6e2df412a85c3fce.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/3/f/3/3f3d1ff3b3fa20958c072158dca8d28f.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/d/0/d/d0d2bdb4fd8198265aca614f824ae540.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/62/PD-icon.svg/12px-PD-icon.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["signal_chain","signal_processing_chain"],["bandwidth","signal_processing"],["attenuator","electronics"],["noise","electronic"]],"members":["bandwidth","attenuator","signal_chain","noise"],"related":["Signal-to-noise_ratio","Radio_frequency","Signal_chain_(signal_processing_chain)","Noise_power","Thermal_noise","Noise_temperature","Kelvin","Decibel","Decibel","Gain","Bandwidth_(signal_processing)","Noise_temperature","Electrical_load","Boltzmann's_constant","Absolute_temperature","Resistor","Low_noise_amplifier","Heterodyne","Frequency","System","Image_frequency","Signal-to-noise_ratio","Decibel","Noise_temperature","Noise_temperature","Attenuator_(electronics)","Friis_formulas_for_noise","Power_gain","Noise","Noise_(electronic)","Noise_figure_meter","Noise_level","Thermal_noise","Signal-to-noise_ratio","Y-factor"]}
