{"cursor":"2030","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" of D -glyceraldehyde]]\n\nAn 'aldose' is a monosaccharide (a simple sugar) that contains only one aldehyde\n(-CH=O) group per molecule. The chemical formula takes the form\nC n(H 2O) n. The simplest possible aldose is the\ndiose glycolaldehyde, which only contains two carbon atoms.\n\nBecause they have at least one asymmetric carbon center, aldoses with three or\nmore carbon atoms exhibit stereoisomerism. This means an aldose can exist in\neither a D form or L form of a Fischer\nprojection. Biological systems tend to recognize D -aldoses more\nthan L -aldoses.\n\nAn aldose differs from a ketose in that it has a carbonyl group at the end of\nthe carbon chain instead of in the middle. This allows ketoses and aldoses to be\nchemically differentiated through Seliwanoff's test. An aldose may\nisomerize to a ketose through the Lobry-de Bruyn-van Ekenstein\ntransformation.\n","linknr":271,"url":"Aldose","recorded":1362688895,"links":39,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Aldoses|"],"headings":["List of aldoses","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a1/D-glyceraldehyde-2D-Fischer.png/140px-D-glyceraldehyde-2D-Fischer.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/AlphaHelixSection.svg/40px-AlphaHelixSection.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Glyceraldehyde","Monosaccharide","Aldehyde","Molecule","Chemical_formula","Diose","Glycolaldehyde","Carbon","Atom","Stereoisomerism","Fischer_projection","Ketose","Carbonyl","Seliwanoff's_test","Isomer","Lobry-de_Bruyn-van_Ekenstein_transformation","Diose","Glycolaldehyde","Triose","Glyceraldehyde","Tetrose","Erythrose","Threose","Pentose","Ribose","Arabinose","Xylose","Lyxose","Hexose","Allose","Altrose","Glucose","Mannose","Gulose","Idose","Galactose","Talose"]}
