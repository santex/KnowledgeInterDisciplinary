S.\nByatt. It won the 1990 Booker Prize.\n\nPart historical as well as contemporary fiction, the title Possession refers to\nissues of ownership and independence between lovers, the practice of collecting\nhistorically significant cultural artifacts, and to the possession that a\nbiographer feels for their subject. The novel incorporates many different styles\nand devices: diaries, letters and poetry, in addition to third-person narration.\nPossession is as concerned with the present day as it is with the Victorian era,\npointing out the differences between the two time periods satirizing such things\nas modern academia and mating rituals.\n\n[[Time Magazine]] included the novel in its TIME 100 Best English-language\nNovels from 1923 to 2005.
