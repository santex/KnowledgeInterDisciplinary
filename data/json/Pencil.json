{"cursor":"42902","size":15,"audio":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f9/En-us-pencil.ogg"],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n pencils]]\n\nA 'pencil' () is a writing implement or art medium usually constructed of a\nnarrow, solid pigment core inside a protective casing. The case prevents the\ncore from breaking, and also from marking the userâs hand during use.\n\nPencils create marks via physical abrasion, leaving behind a trail of solid core\nmaterial that adheres to a sheet of paper or other surface. They are noticeably\ndistinct from pens, which dispense liquid or gel ink that stain the light colour\nof the paper.\n\nMost pencil cores are made of graphite mixed with a clay binder, leaving grey or\nblack marks that can be easily erased. Graphite pencils are used for both\nwriting and drawing, and the result is durable: although writing can usually be\nremoved with an eraser, it is resistant to moisture, most chemicals, ultraviolet\nradiation and natural aging. Other types of pencil core are less widely used.\nCharcoal pencils are mainly used by artists for drawing and sketching. Coloured\npencils are sometimes used by teachers or editors to correct submitted texts but\nare more usually regarded as art supplies, especially those with waxy core\nbinders that tend to smear on paper instead of erasing. Grease pencils have a\nsofter crayon-like waxy core that can leave marks on smooth surfaces such as\nglass or porcelain.\n\nThe most common type of pencil casing is a thin wooden cylinder permanently\nbonded around the core. Similar permanent casings may be constructed of other\nmaterials such as plastic or paper. To use the pencil, the casing must be carved\nor peeled off to expose the working end of the core as a sharp point. Mechanical\npencils have more elaborate casings that support mobile pieces of pigment core,\nwhich can be extended or retracted through the casing tip as needed.\n","linknr":931,"url":"Pencil","recorded":1362898016,"links":113,"instances":["material","symptom","company","geometry","writing_products","drawing","editing","inventor","pencil_maker"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Pencils|","Art
