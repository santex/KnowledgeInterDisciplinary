{"cursor":"2233","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'John Burnell' ( died c.1492) was an Irish judge who held office as Chief Baron\nof the Irish Exchequer.\n\nThe Burnell family had been lords of the manor of Balgriffin, County Dublin\nsince the fourteenth century and had acquired the manor of Castleknock through\nmarriage into the Tyrrell family, who held the feudal barony of Castleknock.\nThey had a strong judicial tradition; Robert Burnell, probably John's great-\ngrandfather, who married the Tyrrell heiress was a Baron of the Court of\nExchequer (Ireland)1388-1413, Ball, F. Elrington The Judges in Ireland 1221-\n1921 John Murray London 1926 Vol.i p.167 as was John's cousin Patrick\n(died 1491). Ball p.185 The judicial tradition was continued by Henry\nBurnell (died 1614) Recorder of Dublin.\n\nJohn was made a Baron of the Court of Exchequer (Ireland) for life in\n1478. Ball p.185 In 1482 he was appointed Deputy to the Chief Baron of\nthe Irish Exchequer, Oliver FitzEustace. Elrington Ball explains that a Deputy\nwas required because Oliver was considered to be mentally deficient, unable to\nspeak or understand what was said to him, so that the oath of office could not\nbe administered to him. Oliver was a natural son of the powerful Rowland\nFitzEustace, 1st Baron Portlester, who obtained both the position for his son\nand the right to name a Deputy himself. Ball p.106 Burnell was\nsuperseded as Deputy in 1487. In 1491 he and Oliver were appointed joint Chief\nBarons, Ball p.185 presumably again due to Portlester's influence, but\nBurnell seems to have died not long after.\n\n\n","linknr":104,"url":"John_Burnell","recorded":1375066021,"links":["/w/index.php?title=John_Burnell&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=John_Burnell&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Chief_Baron_of_the_Irish_Exchequer","/wiki/Burnell_family","/wiki/Balgriffin","/wiki/County_Dublin","/wiki/Castleknock","/wiki/Barony_of_Castleknock","/wiki/Court_of_Exchequer_(Ireland)","#cite_note-1","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Henry_Burnell","/wiki/Recorder_of_Dublin","/wiki/Court_of_Exchequer_(Ireland)","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Oliver_FitzEustace","/wiki/Rowland_FitzEustace,_1st_Baron_Portlester","#cite_note-4","#cite_note-5","/w/index.php?title=John_Burnell&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","#cite_ref-2","#cite_ref-3","#cite_ref-4","#cite_ref-5","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","/wiki/File:Shamrock.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8c/Shamrock.svg/23px-Shamrock.svg.png","/wiki/Irish_people","/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Burnell&action=edit","/wiki/Template:Ireland-bio-stub","/wiki/Template_talk:Ireland-bio-stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Ireland-bio-stub&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Burnell&oldid=566161770","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Irish_judges","/wiki/Category:People_from_County_Dublin","/wiki/Category:15th-century_Irish_people","/wiki/Category:1490s_deaths","/wiki/Category:Irish_people_stubs","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/wiki/Category:Year_of_birth_unknown","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=John+Burnell&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=John+Burnell","/wiki/John_Burnell","/w/index.php?title=Talk:John_Burnell&action=edit&redlink=1","#","/wiki/John_Burnell","/w/index.php?title=John_Burnell&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=John_Burnell&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/John_Burnell","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/John_Burnell","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=John_Burnell&oldid=566161770","/w/index.php?title=John_Burnell&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=John_Burnell&id=566161770","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=John+Burnell","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=John+Burnell&oldid=566161770&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=John_Burnell&printable=yes","#","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Burnell","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":["ireland"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Irish
