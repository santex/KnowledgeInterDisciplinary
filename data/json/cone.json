For other uses, see [[Cone\n(disambiguation)]].\n\n\nA 'cone' is an <math>n</math>-dimensional geometric shape that tapers smoothly\nfrom a base (usually flat and circular) to a point called the apex or vertex.\n\nFormally, it is the solid figure formed by the locus of all straight line\nsegments that join the apex to the base. The term \"cone\" is sometimes used to\nrefer to the surface or the lateral surface of this solid figure (the lateral\nsurface of a cone is equal to the surface minus the base).\n\nThe axis of a cone is the straight line (if any), passing through the apex,\nabout which the base has a rotational symmetry.\n\nIn common usage in elementary geometry, cones are assumed to be 'right\ncircular', where right means that the axis passes through the centre of the base\n(suitably defined) at right angles to its plane, and circular means that the\nbase is a circle. Contrasted with right cones are oblique cones, in which the\naxis does not pass perpendicularly through the centre of the base.<ref\nname=\"MathWorld\"></ref> In general, however, the base may be any shape, and the\napex may lie anywhere (though it is often assumed that the base is bounded and\ntherefore has finite area, and that the apex lies outside the plane of the\nbase). For example, a pyramid is technically a cone with a polygonal base.\n","title":"cone","headings":["Other mathematical meanings","Further terminology","Geometry","Projective geometry","See also","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["2: Conic_section","1: Dimension","1: Geometric_shape","1: Segments","1: Rotational_symmetry","1: Geometry","1: Perpendicular","1: Circle","1: Polygon","1: Half-line","1: Straight_line","1: Conical_surface","1: Convex_cone","1: Projective_cone","1: Dandelin_spheres","1: Radius","1: Aperture","1: Frustum","1: Ellipse","1: Visual_hull","1: Lateral_surface","1: Pythagorean_theorem","1: Volume","1: Cavalieri's_principle","1: Method_of_exhaustion","1: Hilbert's_third_problem","1: Center_of_mass","1: Area","1: Slant_height","1: Implicit_function","1: Vector_calculus","1: Dot_product","1: Projective_geometry","1: Arctan","1: Right_angle","1: Degenerate_conic","1: Cylindrical_conic","1: Democritus","1: Hyperboloid","1: Quadric","1: Ruled_surface","1: Pyrometric_cone","1: Math_Is_Fun"]}
