When used as\nan adjective, the term \"office\" may refer to business-related tasks. In legal\nwriting, a company or organization has offices in any place that it has an\nofficial presence, even if that presence consists of, for example, a storage\nsilo rather than an office.\n\nAn office is an architectural and design phenomenon, whether it is a small\noffice such as a bench in the corner of a small business of extremely small\nsize (see small office/home office) through entire floors of buildings up to\nand including massive buildings dedicated entirely to one company. In modern\nterms an office usually refers to the location where white-collar workers\nare employed.\n",
