Within philosophy of science, it is\noften framed as an answer to the question \"how is the success of science to be\nexplained?\" The debate over what the success of science involves centers\nprimarily on the status of unobservable entities apparently talked about by\nscientific theories. Generally, those who are scientific realists assert that\none can make reliable claims about unobservables (viz., that they have the same\nontological status) as observables, as opposed to instrumentalism.\n","linknr":464,"url":"Scientific_realism","recorded":1362580585,"links":29,"instances":["philosophy_of_science"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Realism","Metatheory of science","Metaphysical theories","Metaphysics of science"],"headings":["Main features of scientific realism","History of scientific realism","Arguments for and against scientific realism","See also","Footnotes","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg/16px-Portal-puzzle.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/People_icon.svg/16px-People_icon.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["structural_realism","philosophy_of_science"]],"members":["structural_realism"],"related":["Philosophy_of_science","Unobservables","Theory","Ontology","Instrumentalism","Semantic","Metaphysics","Epistemology","Logical_consequence","Rationalism","Philosophical_realism","Logical_positivism","Carl_Gustav_Hempel","Thomas_Samuel_Kuhn","W.V._Quine","Hilary_Putnam","Bas_van_Fraassen","Constructive_empiricism","Ontological","Abductive_reasoning","Pessimistic_induction","Albert_Einstein","Special_relativity","Luminiferous_ether","Mechanics","Electromagnetism","Atom","Constructivist_epistemology","Quantum_mechanics","Logical_positivism","Bohm_interpretation","Many-worlds_interpretation","Classical_physics","Underdetermination","Observation","Dinosaur","Fossil","Anti-realism","Constructivist_epistemology","Constructive_empiricism","Confirmation_holism","Critical_realism","Entity_realism","Instrumentalism","Na√Øve_realism","Pessimistic_induction","Scientific_materialism","Stanford_School","Structural_realism_(philosophy_of_science)","Model-dependent_realism"]}
