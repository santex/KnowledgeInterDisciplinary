{"cursor":"39018","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n in Mexico City.]] A 'lottery' is a form of gambling which involves the drawing\n of lots for a prize.\n\nLottery is outlawed by some governments, while others endorse it to the extent\nof organizing a national or state lottery. It is common to find some degree of\nregulation of lottery by governments. At the beginning of the 20th century, most\nforms of gambling, including lotteries and sweepstakes, were illegal in many\ncountries, including the U.S.A. and most of Europe. This remained so until after\nWorld War II. In the 1960s casinos and lotteries began to appear throughout the\nworld as a means to raise revenue in addition to taxes.\n\nLotteries come in many formats. For example, the prize can be a fixed amount of\ncash or goods. In this format there is risk to the organizer if insufficient\ntickets are sold. More commonly the prize fund will be a fixed percentage of the\nreceipts. A popular form of this is the \"50â50\" draw where the organizers\npromise that the prize will be 50% of the revenue. Many recent lotteries allow\npurchasers to select the numbers on the lottery ticket, resulting in the\npossibility of multiple winners.\n\nThe purchase of lottery tickets cannot be accounted for by decision models based\non expected value maximization. The reason is that lottery tickets cost more\nthan the expected gain, so one maximizing expected value should not buy lottery\ntickets. Yet, lottery purchases can be explained by decision models based on\nexpected utility maximization, as the curvature of the utility function can be\nadjusted to capture risk-seeking behavior. More general models based on utility\nfunctions defined on things other than the lottery outcomes can also account for\nlottery purchase. In addition to the lottery prizes, the ticket may enable some\npurchasers to experience a thrill and to indulge in a fantasy of becoming\nwealthy. If the entertainment value (or other non-monetary value) obtained by\nplaying is high enough for a given individual, then the purchase of a lottery\nticket could represent a gain in overall utility. In such a case, the disutility\nof a monetary loss could be outweighed by the combined expected utility of\nmonetary and non-monetary gain, thus making the purchase a rational decision for\nthat individual.\n","linknr":466,"url":"Lottery","recorded":1362486199,"links":64,"instances":["economics","lottery","finance","ireland","city"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Lotteries|"],"headings":["Early
