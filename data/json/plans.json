See also strategy. It is commonly understood as a\ntemporal set of intended actions through which one expects to achieve a goal.\nFor spatial or planar topologic or topographic sets see map.\n\nPlans can be formal or informal:\n* Structured and formal plans, used by multiple people, are more likely to occur\n  in projects, diplomacy, careers, economic development, military campaigns,\n  combat, sports, games, or in the conduct of other business. In most cases, the\n  absence of a well-laid plan can have adverse effects: for example, a non-\n  robust project plan can cost the organization time and money.<ref>[http://www.pmhut.com/what-should-be-included-in-a-project-\n  plan What Should Be Included in a Project Plan] - Retrieved December 18th,\n  2009</ref><ref></ref>\n* Informal or ad-hoc plans are created by individuals in all of their pursuits.\n\nThe most popular ways to describe plans are by their breadth, time frame, and\nspecificity; however, these planning classifications are not independent of one\nanother. For instance, there is a close relationship between the short- and long-\nterm categories and the strategic and operational categories.\n\nIt is common for less formal plans to be created as abstract ideas, and remain\nin that form as they are maintained and put to use. More formal plans as used\nfor business and military purposes, while initially created with and as an\nabstract thought, are likely to be written down, drawn up or otherwise stored in\na form that is accessible to multiple people across time and space. This allows\nmore reliable collaboration in the execution of the plan.\n","title":"Plan","headings":["Plan topics","Examples of plans","Quotations","See also","References"]},"micro-relation":["2: Strategy","2: Roadmap","2: Five-Year_Plans_for_the_National_Economy_of_the_Soviet_Union","2: Soviet_Union","1: Modal_logic","1: Set","1: Goal","1: Space","1: Topology","1: Topography","1: Map","1: Project","1: Diplomacy","1: Career","1: Economic_development","1: Military","1: Combat","1: Sports","1: Games","1: Business","1: Ad-hoc","1: Planning","1: Task_list","1: Government","1: Legislation","1: Regulation","1: Urban_planning","1: Transportation_planning","1: Land_use","1: Zoning","1: Top-down_planning","1: Systems_thinking","1: Top-down_model","1: Psychology","1: Game_theory","1: Communication","1: Information_theory","1: Logic","1: Science","1: Individual","1: Mind","1: Personal_organizer","1: Corporation","1: Project_manager","1: Engineer","1: Industrial_designer","1: Architectural_plan","1: Business_plan","1: Fragplan","1: Health_plan","1: Marketing_plan","1: Project_plan","1: Plan_de_Ayala","1: Plan_de_Casa_Mata","1: Treaty_of_Córdoba","1: Plan_de_Iguala","1: Plan_de_San_Luis_Potosí","1: Site_plan","1: Schlieffen_Plan","1: Marshall_Plan","1: 2003_invasion_of_Iraq","1: Winston_Churchill","1: Dwight_D._Eisenhower","1: Helmuth_von_Moltke_the_Elder","1: George_S._Patton","1: Automated_planning","1: Critical_path_method","1: PDCA","1: PERT","1: Planned_unit_development","1: Military_tactics"]}
