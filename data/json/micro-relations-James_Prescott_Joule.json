The Joule brewery used the\nconfusion in its pronunciation in advertising:  24 December 1818 â 11\nOctober 1889) was an English physicist and brewer, born in Salford, Lancashire.\nJoule studied the nature of heat, and discovered its relationship to mechanical\nwork (see energy). This led to the theory of conservation of energy, which led\nto the development of the first law of thermodynamics. The SI derived unit of\nenergy, the joule, is named after him. He worked with Lord Kelvin to develop the\nabsolute scale of temperature, made observations on magnetostriction, and found\nthe relationship between the current through resistance and the heat dissipated,\nnow one of the two laws called Joule's law.\n","linknr":546,"url":"James_Prescott_Joule","recorded":1362480440,"links":111,"instances":["rsa","scientist","classical_element","chemist","electricity","lecturer","philosopher","beer","material","city"],"pdf":["http://www.bad.org.uk/Portals/_Bad/History/Historical%20poster%2006.pdf"],"categories":["1818
