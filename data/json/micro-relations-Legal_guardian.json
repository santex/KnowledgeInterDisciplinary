Usually, a person has the status of guardian because the\nward is incapable of caring for his or her own interests due to infancy,\nincapacity, or disability. Most countries and states have laws that provide\nthat the parents of a minor child are the legal guardians of that child, and\nthat the parents can designate who shall become the child's legal guardian in\nthe event of death.\n\nCourts generally have the power to appoint a guardian for an individual in need\nof special protection. A guardian with responsibility for both the personal well-\nbeing and the financial interests of the ward is a general guardian. A person\nmay also be appointed as a special guardian, having limited powers over the\ninterests of the ward. A special guardian may, for example, be given the legal\nright to determine the disposition of the ward's property without being given\nany authority over the ward's person. A guardian appointed to represent the\ninterests of a person with respect to a single action in litigation is a\nguardian [[ad litem]].\n\nSome jurisdictions allow a parent of a child to exercise the authority of a\nlegal guardian without a formal court appointment. In such circumstances the\nparent acting in that capacity is called the natural guardian of that\nparent's child.\n","linknr":231,"url":"Legal_guardian","recorded":1362486208,"links":44,"instances":["law","law","law"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Legal professions"],"headings":["Guardian ''ad litem''","Estates and financial decision making","Situation in other countries","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Ambox_globe_content.svg/48px-Ambox_globe_content.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["ward","law"],["minor","law"],["minor","law"],["conservator","law"]],"members":["conservator","ward","minor"],"related":["Property","Ward_(law)","Infancy","Incapacity","Disability","Parent","Minor_(law)","Court","Litigation","Ad_litem","Minor_(law)","United_States","Volunteer","Social_worker","Lawyer","Child_abuse","Child_neglect","Person_In_Need_of_Supervision","Juvenile_delinquency","Substance_dependence","Jurisdiction","Advocate","Age_of_majority","Code_of_Virginia","Children_and_Family_Court_Advisory_and_Support_Service","Non-departmental_public_body","Fiduciary","Surety_bond","Conservator_(law)","Uniform_Probate_Code","Mental_disease","Conservatorship","Custodial_account","USA"]}
