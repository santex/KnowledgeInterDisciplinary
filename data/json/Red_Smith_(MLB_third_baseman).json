He was an interesting player for the time,\naccumulating a solid .278 career batting average. He was right-handed and\nstood around .\n\nSmith was born in Greenville, South Carolina and attended the Alabama\nPolytechnic Institute (now known as Auburn University) before making his ML\ndebut with Brooklyn on September 5, 1911.\n\nSmith's best years came in 1913 and 1914 although all his years were quite\nsolid, and in 1918 he had his best season batting average at .298 in 429 at\nbats. In 1913, he put up good numbers in all categories, including a league-\nleading 40 doubles, career-high 10 triples, and a tie for a career-high in\nstolen bases, with 22. He also had 22 the previous year. In 1914, the year in\nwhich Smith was sold to Boston, he put up very good numbers including a career-\nhigh .395 slugging percentage and career-highs in home runs (7) and RBIs (85).\nHe batted .314 after he was traded on August 10.\n\nSmith was not a very solid fielding 3B, putting up bad fielding percentages\n(.932 career at 3B) and generally over 30 errors a year. After going to Boston,\nhe finally had the chance to compete for a pennant, and won a World Series with\nthem in 1914, but he didn't play due to broken right leg that he suffered on the\nfinal day of the season, and his team never got there again, peaking at a 2nd\nplace finish in 1915 under manager George Stallings. They finished seven games\nbehind the Philadelphia Phillies that year, and dropped off soon after that.\nStill, Smith is often remembered as a significant part of Boston's climb into\nfirst place in 1914.\n\nIn an active nine-year career, Smith had a .278 average with 27 home runs and\n514 RBIs in 1117 career games. He had a total of 1087 career hits in 3907 at\nbats. Other stats included 117 career stolen bases, 477 runs scored, 208 all-\ntime doubles and 49 triples.\n\nSmith died on October 11, 1966 in Atlanta, Georgia, the current location of the\nBraves organization.\n","linknr":133,"url":"Red_Smith_(MLB_third_baseman)","recorded":1375076658,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Red_Smith_(third_baseman)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Red_Smith_(third_baseman)&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","/wiki/Red_Smith_(third_baseman)","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","/w/index.php?title=Red_Smith_(MLB_third_baseman)&redirect=no","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Red_Smith_(disambiguation)","/wiki/File:James_C_Red_Smith.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bb/James_C_Red_Smith.jpg/200px-James_C_Red_Smith.jpg","/wiki/Third_baseman","/wiki/Greenville,_South_Carolina","/wiki/Atlanta,_Georgia","/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers","/wiki/Atlanta_Braves","/wiki/Batting_average","/wiki/Hit_(baseball)","/wiki/Runs_batted_in","/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers","/wiki/Atlanta_Braves","/wiki/World_Series","/wiki/1914_World_Series","/wiki/Major_League_Baseball","/wiki/Third_baseman","/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers","/wiki/Atlanta_Braves","/wiki/Boston","/wiki/Batting_average","/wiki/Greenville,_South_Carolina","/wiki/Auburn_University","/wiki/Slugging_percentage","/wiki/Fielding_percentage","/wiki/Error_(baseball)","/wiki/World_Series","/wiki/1914_World_Series","/wiki/Baseball_manager","/wiki/George_Stallings","/wiki/Philadelphia_Phillies","/wiki/Home_run","/wiki/Runs_batted_in","/wiki/Hit_(baseball)","/wiki/At_bat","/wiki/Stolen_base","/wiki/Runs_scored","/wiki/Double_(baseball)","/wiki/Triple_(baseball)","/wiki/Atlanta,_Georgia","/w/index.php?title=Red_Smith_(third_baseman)&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/List_of_Major_League_Baseball_doubles_champions","/w/index.php?title=Red_Smith_(third_baseman)&action=edit&section=2","http://www.baseball-reference.com/s/smithre02.shtml","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Red_Smith_(third_baseman)&oldid=479998514","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1890_births","/wiki/Category:1966_deaths","/wiki/Category:Major_League_Baseball_third_basemen","/wiki/Category:Baseball_players_from_South_Carolina","/wiki/Category:Brooklyn_Dodgers_players","/wiki/Category:Brooklyn_Robins_players","/wiki/Category:Boston_Braves_players","/wiki/Category:People_from_Greenville,_South_Carolina","/wiki/Category:Auburn_Tigers_baseball_players","/wiki/Category:Minor_league_baseball_managers","/wiki/Category:Anderson_Electricians_players","/wiki/Category:Nashville_Volunteers_players","/wiki/Category:Brooklyn_Superbas_players","/wiki/Category:Vernon_Tigers_players","/wiki/Category:Los_Angeles_Angels_(minor_league)_players","/wiki/Category:Atlanta_Crackers_players","/wiki/Category:Jacksonville_Tars_players","/wiki/Category:Peoria_Tractors_players","/wiki/Category:Springfield_Senators_players","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Red+Smith+%28third+baseman%29&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Red+Smith+%28third+baseman%29","/wiki/Red_Smith_(third_baseman)","/wiki/Talk:Red_Smith_(third_baseman)","#","/wiki/Red_Smith_(third_baseman)","/w/index.php?title=Red_Smith_(third_baseman)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Red_Smith_(third_baseman)&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Red_Smith_(third_baseman)","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Red_Smith_(third_baseman)","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Red_Smith_(third_baseman)&oldid=479998514","/w/index.php?title=Red_Smith_(third_baseman)&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7305066","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Red_Smith_%28third_baseman%29&id=479998514","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Red+Smith+%28third+baseman%29","/w/index.php?ti
