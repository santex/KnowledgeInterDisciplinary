What Is Money? By John N. Smithin [http://books.google.com/books?id=MDU-\nNTEJziMC&pg=PA47&lpg=PA47&dq=Debt+tokens+money&source=bl&ots=M-\nY60HHJvi&sig=TmFl-TIs5UabUm1-\niHHadBA6Pck&hl=en&ei=liRhSpHNH5_FmQf2_pSrDw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnu-\nm=5]. Retrieved July-17-09. The main functions of money are\ndistinguished as: a medium of exchange; a unit of account; a store of value;\nand, occasionally in the past, a standard of deferred payment. T.H. Greco. Money: Understanding and\nCreating Alternatives to Legal Tender, White River Junction, Vt: Chelsea Green\nPublishing (2001). ISBN 1-890132-37-3 Any kind of object or secure\nverifiable record that fulfills these functions can be considered money.\n\nMoney is historically an emergent market phenomenon establishing a commodity\nmoney, but nearly all contemporary money systems are based on fiat money. Fiat money, like any check or note of debt, is without intrinsic\nuse value as a physical commodity. It derives its value by being declared by a\ngovernment to be legal tender; that is, it must be accepted as a form of payment\nwithin the boundaries of the country, for \"all debts, public and private\". Such\nlaws in practice cause fiat money to acquire the value of any of the goods and\nservices that it may be traded for within the nation that issues it.\n\nThe money supply of a country consists of currency (banknotes and coins) and\nbank money (the balance held in checking accounts and savings accounts). Bank\nmoney, which consists only of records (mostly computerized in modern banking),\nforms by far the largest part of the money supply in developed\nnations.
