All members except Mozambique and\nRwanda were part of the British Empire, out of which the Commonwealth developed.\n\nThe member states cooperate within a framework of common values and goals, as\noutlined in the Singapore Declaration. These include the promotion of democracy,\nhuman rights, good governance, the rule of law, individual liberty,\negalitarianism, free trade, multilateralism and world peace. The Commonwealth is not a political union, but an\nintergovernmental organisation in which countries with diverse social, political\nand economic backgrounds are regarded as equal in status. Alongside shared\nvalues, Commonwealth nations share strong trade links; trade with another\nCommonwealth member has been shown to be a third to a half more than with a non-\nmember.\n\nActivities of the Commonwealth are carried out through the permanent\nCommonwealth Secretariat, headed by the secretary-general, and biennial meetings\nof Commonwealth Heads of Government. The symbol of their free association is the\nHead of the Commonwealth, currently held by Queen Elizabeth II. Elizabeth II is\nalso monarch, separately and independently, of 16 Commonwealth members, which\nare known as the \"Commonwealth realms\".\n\nThe Commonwealth is a forum for a number of non-governmental organisations,\ncollectively known as the Commonwealth Family, which are fostered through the\nintergovernmental Commonwealth Foundation. The Commonwealth Games, the\nCommonwealth's most visible activity, are\na product of one of these organisations. These organisations strengthen the\nshared culture of the Commonwealth, which extends through common sports,\nliterary heritage, and political and legal practices. Reflecting this, diplomatic missions between\nCommonwealth countries are designated as high commissions rather than embassies.\n\nThere is growing sentiment, such as in the United Kingdom, that stronger\nrelations with the Commonwealth is a more viable alternative to the European\nUnion in the wake of the European sovereign debt crisis and general\neuroscepticism.\n","linknr":1746,"url":"Commonwealth_of_Nations","recorded":1362482194,"links":151,"instances":["ireland","historian","1956","commonwealth"],"pdf":["http://www.thecommonwealth.org/shared_asp_files/uploadedfiles/%7BE7A2A23D-FD9F-418B-B2D4-CC39FFD2FEF2%7D_Aso%20Rock%20Declaration.pdf","http://www.thecommonwealth.org/shared_asp_files/uploadedfiles/%7BE7A2A23D-FD9F-418B-B2D4-CC39FFD2FEF2%7D_Aso%20Rock%20Declaration.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20070722134850/http://www.cpsu.org.uk/downloads/future_aide.pdf","http://www.cpsu.org.uk/downloads/future_aide.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20070722134850/http://www.cpsu.org.uk/downloads/future_aide.pdf","http://www.opc.gov.au/calc/docs/LDOs.pdf","http://www.globaled.org.nz/schools/pdfs/factsheets/Commonwealth.pdf","//commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:AnnexB_Members_of_the_Commonwealth.pdf"],"categories":["Commonwealth
