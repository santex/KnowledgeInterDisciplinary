The judicial decree\nthat someone be punished in this manner is a 'death sentence', while the actual\nprocess of killing the person is an 'execution'. Crimes that can result in a\ndeath penalty are known as capital crimes or capital offences. The term capital\noriginates from the Latin capitalis, literally \"regarding the head\" (referring\nto execution by beheading).<ref name=KronenwetterP202></ref>\n\nCapital punishment has, in the past, been practised by most societies;<ref>\"The\nmost notable aspect of the criminal provisions was that punishments took the\nform of seizure of property, banishment, or, more often, payment of a fine. Even\nmurder and other severe crimes (arson, organised horse thieving, robbery) were\nsettled by monetary fines. Although the death penalty had been introduced by\nVladimir the Great, it too was soon replaced by fines.\" Magocsi, Paul Robert\n(1996). A History of Ukraine, p. 90, Toronto: University of Toronto Press. ISBN\n0-8020-0830-5.</ref> currently 58 nations actively practise it, and 97 countries\nhave abolished it (the remainder have not used it for 10 years or allow it only\nin exceptional circumstances such as wartime).<ref></ref> It is a matter of\nactive controversy in various countries and states, and positions can vary\nwithin a single political ideology or cultural region. In the European Union\nmember states, Article 2 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European\nUnion prohibits the use of capital punishment.<ref></ref>\n\nCurrently, Amnesty International considers most countries\nabolitionist.<ref></ref> The United Nations General Assembly has adopted, in\n2007, 2008 and 2010, non-binding resolutions calling for a global moratorium on\nexecutions, with a view to eventual abolition.<ref></ref> Although many nations\nhave abolished capital punishment, over 60% of the world's population live in\ncountries where executions take place, such as the People's Republic of China,\nIndia, the United States of America and Indonesia, the four most-populous\ncountries in the world, which continue to apply the death penalty (although in\nIndia, Indonesia and in many US states it is rarely employed). Each of these\nfour nations voted against the General Assembly resolutions.<ref></ref><ref></r-\nef><ref></ref><ref>[http://www.mercurynews.com/news/ci_11889244?nclick_check=1\nAG Brown says he'll
