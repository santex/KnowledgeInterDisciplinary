For an observer on the Earth,\nthis corresponds to the period it takes the Sun to complete one course\nthroughout the zodiac along the ecliptic.\n\nIn astronomy, the Julian year is a unit of time, defined as 365.25 days of SI\nseconds each (no leap seconds).<ref>International Astronomical Union\n\"[http://www.iau.org/science/publications/proceedings_rules/units/ SI units]\"\naccessed February 18, 2010. (See Table 5 and section 5.15.) Reprinted from\nGeorge A. Wilkins & IAU Commission 5,\n[http://www.iau.org/static/publications/stylemanual1989.pdf \"The IAU Style\nManual (1989)\"] (PDF file) in [[IAU Transactions]] Vol. XXB</ref>\n\nThere is no universally accepted symbol for the year as a unit of time. The\nInternational System of Units does not propose one. A common abbreviation in\ninternational use is 'a' (for Latin [[:wikt:annus|annus]]), in English also\n'y' or 'yr'.\n\nDue to the Earth's axial tilt, the course of a year sees the passing of the\nseasons, marked by changes in weather, hours of daylight, and consequently\nvegetation and fertility. In temperate and subpolar regions, generally four\nseasons are recognized: [[Spring (season)|spring]], [[summer]], [[autumn]] and\n[[winter]], astronomically marked by the Sun reaching the points of equinox and\nsolstice, although the climatic seasons lag behind their astronomical markers.\nIn some tropical and subtropical regions it is more common to speak of the rainy\n(or wet, or monsoon) season versus the dry season.\n\nA calendar year is an approximation of the Earth's orbital period in a given\ncalendar. A calendar year in the Gregorian calendar (as well as in the Julian\ncalendar) has either 365 (common years) or 366 (leap years) days.\n\nThe word \"year\" is also used of periods loosely associated but not strictly\nidentical with either the astronomical or the calendar year, such as the\nseasonal year, the fiscal year or the academic year, etc. By extension, the term\nyear can mean the orbital period of any planet: for example, a \"Martian year\" is\nthe time in which Mars completes its own orbit. The term is also applied more\nbroadly to any long period or cycle, such as the \"Great Year\".<ref>OED, s.v.\n\"year\", entry 2.b.: \"transf. Applied to a very long period or cycle (in\nchronology or mythology, or vaguely in poetic use).\"</ref>\n","title":"year","headings":["Etymology","Seasonal year","Calendar year","Other annual periods","Astronomical years","Symbol","\"Great years\"","See also","References","Further reading"]},"micro-relation":["5: Geology","4: Tropical_year","4: Paleontology","3: Earth","3: Unit_of_time","3: Second","3: International_System_of_Units","3: Season","3: Calendar","3: Leap_year","3: Perihelion","3: Before_Present","3: Long_and_short_scales","2: Ecliptic","2: Day","2: Calendar_year","2: Gregorian_calendar","2: Julian_calendar","2: Common_year","2: Seasonal_year","2: Fiscal_year","2: Gothic_language","2: PIE","2: Hour","2: Latin","2: Month","2: Northward_equinox","2: Iranian_calendar","2: Astronomical_year_numbering","2: Unified_Code_for_Units_of_Measure","2: Sidereal_year","2: Terrestrial_Time","2: Aphelion","2: SI_days","2: Holocene","1: Old_English_language","1: Orbital_period","1: Sun","1: Zodiac","1: Leap_second","1: International_Astronomical_Union","1: Axial_tilt","1: Weather","1: Daylight","1: Vegetation","1: Temperate","1: Subpolar_climate","1: Equinox","1: Solstice","1: Seasonal_lag","1: Tropics","1: Subtropical","1: Wet_season","1: Monsoon","1: Dry_season","1: Academic_year","1: Planet","1: Great_Year","1: OED","1: West_Saxon_dialect","1: Anglian_dialects","1: Proto-Germanic","1: German_language","1: Old_High_German","1: Old_Norse","1: Avestan","1: Ancient_Greek","1: Old_Church_Slavonic","1: 2nd_declension","1: Accusative_case","1: Sanskrit","1: 365-day_calendar","1: Parts_per_million","1: Sidereal_day","1: Revised_Julian_calendar","1: Eastern_Orthodox_Church","1: Afghanistan","1: Iran","1: Tehran","1: Calendar_era","1: Jesus","1: Common_era","1: Before_Christ","1: Canada","1: India","1: United_Kingdom","1: Australia","1: United_States","1: Federal_government_of_the_United_States","1: Educational_institution","1: Academic_term","1: Boston_Latin_School","1: Positive_correlation","1: Hebrew_Calendar","1: Light-year","1: Orbit","1: J2000.0","1: Ecliptic_longitude","1: Apsis","1: U.S._Government_Printing_Office","1: U.K._Hydrographic_Office","1: Kepler_orbit","1: Atomic_time","1: Lunar_node","1: Eclipse","1: Eclipse_season","1: Lunar_precession","1: Full_moon_cycle","1: Perigee","1: Full_moon","1: Lunar_year","1: Muslims","1: Muslim_holidays","1: Ramadan","1: Egyptian_calendar","1: Armenian_calendar","1: Mesoamerican_calendars","1: Aztec_calendar","1: Haab'","1: Heliacal_rising","1: Precession_of_the_equinoxes","1: Sothic_cycle","1: Sirius","1: Gaussian_year","1: Gaussian_gravitational_constant","1: Universal_Time","1: Besselian_epoch","1: Friedrich_Bessel","1: Astronomical_Almanac","1: Ephemeris_time","1: Precession","1: Tidal_drag","1: Post-glacial_rebound","1: Sea_level_rise","1: Dracontic_year","1: Lunisolar_calendar","1: Lunar_calendar","1: Solar_calendar","1: Week","1: Minute","1: National_Institute_of_Standards_and_Technology","1: International_Organization_for_Standardization","1: Hectare#Are","1: Gregorian_year","1: International_Union_of_Pure_and_Applied_Chemistry","1: International_Union_of_Geological_Sciences","1: Cretaceous","1: Theropoda","1: Millennium","1: Thousand","1: Archaeology","1: Pleistocene","1: Radiocarbon_dating","1: Ice_core","1: Dendrochronology","1: Uranium-thorium_dating","1: Varve","1: Time","1: Million","1: Celestial_mechanics","1: Dinosaur","1: Milliard","1: Physical_cosmology","1: Age_of_the_universe","1: Red_dwarf_star","1: 10^15","1: Cadmium","1: Tantalum","1: Quintillion","1: Tungsten","1: Astronomy","1: Metric_prefix","1: Out-of-Africa_migration","1: Last_Glacial_Maximum","1: Neolithic_Revolution","1: Pliocene","1: BrunhesâMatuyama_reversal","1: Eemian_Stage","1: Ice_Age","1: Eukaryotes","1: Big_Bang","1: Great_year","1: Astronomical_precession","1: Galactic_year","1: Solar_system","1: Galactic_center","1: {{CURRENTYEAR}}","1: ISO_8601","1: JÄran","1: List_of_calendars","1: List_of_years","1: Man-hour","1: University_of_Massachusetts_Press","1: Oxford_University_Press"]}
