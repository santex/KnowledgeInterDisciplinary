The idea\nwas to insert ground forces into hostile territory, search out the enemy,\ndestroy them, and withdraw immediately afterward. The strategy was the result\nof a new technology, the helicopter, which resulted in a new form of warfare,\nthe fielding of [[Air assault|air cavalry]], Starry, p. 221 and was\nthought to be ideally jumped to counter-guerrilla jungle warfare. The\ncomplementary conventional strategy, which entailed attacking and conquering\nan enemy position, then fortifying and holding it indefinitely, was known as\n\"clear and hold\" or \"clear and secure.\" In theory, since the traditional\nmethods of \"taking ground\" could not be used in this war, a war of\n'attrition' would be used, eliminating the enemy by the use of \"searching\"\nfor them, then \"destroying\" them, and the \"[[body count]]\" would be the\nmeasuring tool to determine the success of the strategy of \"search and\ndestroy.\" It is common practice among military forces to enforce strict rules\non a search and destroy mission.\n\nIt became an offensive tool, crucial to General William Westmorelandâs second\nphase. In his three phase strategy, the first consisted of slowing down the Viet\nCong Forces; the second was to resume the offensive and destroy the enemy; the\nthird was to restore the area under South Vietnamese government control. The\nZippo missions were mainly assigned to the second phase around 1966 and 1967,\nalong with operations âClear and Secure.â\n\nSearch and destroy missions entailed sending out platoons, companies, or\nlarger detachments of US troops from a fortified position to locate and\ndestroy Vietcong or NVA units in the countryside. These missions most commonly\ninvolved hiking out into the \"boonies\" and setting an ambush in the brush,\nnear a suspected VC trail. The ambush typically involved the use of fixed\nClaymore Antipersonnel Mines, crossing lines of small arms fire, mortar\nsupport, and possibly additional artillery support called in via radio from a\nnearby firebase.\n\nIn February 1967, some of the largest Zippo missions was operated in the Iron\nTriangle, located between Saigon and Routes 13 and 25. The area consisted of a\nmass centre of Viet Cong logistics and headquarters, with some of the most high-\nranking NLF officials stationed there. The offensive began with Operation\nJunction City, where the American units assigned had destroyed hundreds of tons\nof rice, killed 720 guerrillas, and captured 213 prisoners. However, the Iron\nTriangle area's defenders was thought to be over 10,000. The offensive failed to\ndestroy the NLF's headquarter nor capture any high-ranking officer, therefore\nhaving little effect toward Hanoi's plan. Both Search and Destroy and Clearing\nmissions stretched into the third phase beginning in 1968. The number of\nmissions mounted, especially after the U.S. was hit by General Vo Nguyen Giapâs\nTet offensive attack of 1968. As the war grew more aggressive, so did the\nmissions, to the point where there was lack of distinction between Search and\nDestroy, and Clear and Secure operations.\n\nSearch and destroy missions had many flaws. First, there was lack of distinction\nbetween âclearingâ and search and destroy missions. Thus âclearingâ missions,\nwhich were less aggressive, eventually morphed into a more violent and brutal\nform of tactic just as search and destroy missions were. With the lack of\ndistinction between âclearingâ and search and destroy missions, pacification was\nnot pushed. Guenter Lewey, a Professor of Political Science at the University of\nMassachusetts Amherst, argued that the generals and war planners severely\nunderestimated the enemyâs abilities to match and exceed U.S. forces. George\nC. Herring, American Strategy in Vietnam: The Postwar Debate. Large\nnumbers of Viet Cong troops would be killed or captured, but they were quickly\nreplaced. Although enemy forces were initially pushed out of certain\nterritories, as soon as the American forces left the areas, they simply returned\nwith more reinforcements and weapons.\n\nThe effectiveness of the missions are also doubtful. In one of the first Search\nand Destroy missions northwest of Dau Tieng, named Operation Attleboro, US\nreport states that 155 U.S. soldiers were killed, while the North Vietnamese\nlost 1,106. In Operation Junction City, the report also states that 282 U.S.\nsoldiers were killed while the Viet Cong lost 1,728 guerrillas. These figures,\nhowever, should be considered in light of the methods by which they were\nobtained. The estimates were almost exclusively gathered by indirect means:\nsensor readings, sightings of secondary explosions, reports of defectors or\nPOWs, and inference or extrapolation.
