Established in 1888, it has an overall area of 386,000 mÂ², and it\n is located in the historic centre of the city, inside the Zone 1 administrative\n division. It owes its name to Corso Sempione, a major thoroughfare of Milan,\n dating back to the Napoleonic Empire. The park is adjacent to the gardens of\n the Sforza Castle and to the Arch of Peace, two of the prominent landmarks of\n Milan. The very design of the park, due to architect Emilio Alemagna, was\n conceived with the intent of creating panoramic views encompassing both\n monuments. A third prominent monument of Parco Sempione is the Palazzo\n dell'Arte (\"Palace of Art\"), built in 1933 and designed by Giovanni Muzio,\n which currently houses the Triennale di Milano art expo.\n\nOther places of interest within the park include the Arena Civica, the public\naquarium, and the Torre Branca tower.\n\nThe whole area of the park is covered by a free wireless\nnetwork.
