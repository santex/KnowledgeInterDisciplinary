      "text" : "\n\n\nThe trait of 'extraversion–introversion' is a central dimension of human\npersonality theories. The terms introversion and extraversion were first\npopularized by Carl Jung,<ref name=Psychologischen>Jung, C.J. (1921)\nPsychologischen Typen. Rascher Verlag, Zurich&nbsp;– translation H.G. Baynes,\n1923.</ref> although both the popular understanding and psychological usage\ndiffer from his original intent. Extraversion tends to be manifested in\noutgoing, talkative, energetic behavior, whereas introversion is manifested in\nmore reserved and solitary behavior.<ref name=\"Thompson\"></ref> Virtually all\ncomprehensive models of personality include these concepts in various forms.\nExamples include the Big Five model, Jung's analytical psychology, Hans\nEysenck's three-factor model, Raymond Cattell's 16 personality factors, the\nMinnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, and the Myers–Briggs Type\nIndicator.\n\nExtraversion and introversion are typically viewed as a single continuum. Thus,\nto be high on one it is necessary to be low on the other. Carl Jung and the\nauthors of the Myers–Briggs provide a different perspective and suggest that\neveryone has both an extroverted side and an introverted side, with one being\nmore dominant than the other. Rather than focusing on interpersonal behavior,\nhowever, Jung defined introversion as an \"attitude-type characterised by\norientation in life through subjective psychic contents\" (focus on one's inner\npsychic activity); and extraversion as \"an attitude type characterised by\nconcentration of interest on the external object\", (the outside\nworld).<ref></ref>\n\nIn any case, people fluctuate in their behavior all the time, and even extreme\nintroverts and extraverts do not always act according to their type.\n",
