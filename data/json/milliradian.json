A full circle corresponds to an angle of 2π radians.]] The 'radian' is\n the standard unit of angular measure, used in many areas of mathematics. An\n angle's measurement in radians is numerically equal to the length of a\n corresponding arc of a unit circle, so one radian is just under 57.3 degrees\n (when the arc length is equal to the radius). The unit was formerly an SI\n supplementary unit, but this category was abolished in 1995 and the radian is\n now considered an SI derived unit. The SI unit of solid angle measurement is\n the steradian.\n\nThe radian is represented by the symbol \"rad\" or, more rarely, by the\nsuperscript c (for \"circular measure\"). For example, an angle of 1.2 radians\nwould be written as \"1.2 rad\" or \"1.2<sup>c</sup>\" (the latter symbol is often\nmistaken for a degree: \"1.2°\").\n",
