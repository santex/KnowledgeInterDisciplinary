{"cursor":"14738","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"]] The 'Quantitative Precipitation Forecast' (abbreviated 'QPF') is the expected\namount of melted precipitation accumulated over a specified time period over a\nspecified area. A QPF will be created when precipitation\namounts reaching a minimum threshold are expected during the forecast's valid\nperiod. Valid periods of precipitation forecasts are normally synoptic hours\nsuch as 0000, 0600, 1200 and 1800 GMT. Terrain is considered in QPFs by use of\ntopography or based upon climatological precipitation patterns from observations\nwith fine detail. Starting in the mid-to-late 1990s, QPFs were used within\nhydrologic forecast models to simulate impact to rivers throughout the United\nStates. Forecast models show significant sensitivity to humidity levels within\nthe planetary boundary layer, or in the lowest levels of the atmosphere, which\ndecreases with height.

Craig, and\nUlrich Schumann (2008).\n[http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2008/2008GL033657.shtml Sensitivity of\nquantitative precipitation forecast to height dependent changes in humidity.]\nGeophysical Research Letters.

Retrieved on 2008-12-31. Radar\nimagery forecasting techniques show higher skill than model forecasts within 6\nto 7 hours of the time of the radar image. The forecasts can be verified through\nuse of rain gauge measurements, weather radar estimates, or a combination of\nboth. Various skill scores can be determined to measure the value of the\nrainfall forecast.\n","linknr":228,"url":"Quantitative_precipitation_forecast","recorded":1362672854,"links":26,"instances":["set_theory","meteorology"],"pdf":["http://cms.ce.gatech.edu/gwri/uploads/proceedings/1999/BushongJ-99.pdf","http://cms.ce.gatech.edu/gwri/uploads/proceedings/1999/BushongJ-99.pdf","http://www.actif-ec.net/Workshop2/Presentations/ACTIF_P_S1_02.pdf","http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/pdf/TCR-AL092008_Ike.pdf","http://www.wrh.noaa.gov/wrh/talite0821.pdf","http://www.erh.noaa.gov/box/papers/HeavyrainspreprintWAF_stuart.pdf","http://www.bom.gov.au/inside/eiab/reports/ar06-07/PDF/Meteorological-and-related-research.pdf","http://www.hko.gov.hk/publica/reprint/r451.pdf","http://ams.confex.com/ams/pdfpapers/138022.pdf"],"categories":["Weather forecasting","Hydrology"],"headings":["Use of radar","Use of forecast models","Probability approach","Entities which generate rainfall forecasts","Verification","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/11/Rita5dayqpf.gif/300px-Rita5dayqpf.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/16/Osage_pqpf.jpg/300px-Osage_pqpf.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/Radar-accumulations_eng.png/300px-Radar-accumulations_eng.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/94/Symbol_support_vote.svg/15px-Symbol_support_vote.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["precipitation","meteorology"],["intersection","set_theory"]],"members":["intersection","precipitation"],"related":["Precipitation_(meteorology)","GMT","Numerical_weather_prediction","Planetary_boundary_layer","Rain_gauge","Weather_radar","Goddard_Space_Flight_Center","NASA","Hydrometeorological_Prediction_Center","National_Hurricane_Center","National_Weather_Service","Flood","National_Weather_Service","Correlation","Ensemble_forecasting","European_Centre_for_Medium-Range_Weather_Forecasts","National_Centers_for_Environmental_Prediction","Environmental_Modeling_Center","National_Centers_for_Environmental_Prediction","National_Weather_Service","National_Weather_Service","University_of_Texas","Probability_of_precipitation","National_Weather_Service","Bureau_of_Meteorology","Bureau_of_Meteorology","Hydrometeorological_Prediction_Center","American_Meteorological_Society","Rain_gauge","Weather_radar","Systematic_bias","Intersection_(set_theory)","Statistical_power","Type_I_and_type_II_errors","Tropical_cyclone","Global_Forecast_System","North_American_Mesoscale_Model","ECMWF","Tropical_cyclone_rainfall_forecasting","European_Flood_Alert_System"]}
