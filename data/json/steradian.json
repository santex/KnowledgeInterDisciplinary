      "text" : "\n\nThe 'steradian' (symbol: 'sr') is the SI unit of solid angle. It is used to\nquantify two-dimensional angular spans in three-dimensional space, analogously\nto how the radian quantifies angles in a plane. The name is derived from the\nGreek stereos for \"solid\" and the Latin radius for \"ray, beam\".\n\nThe steradian, like the radian, is dimensionless, essentially because a solid\nangle is the ratio between the area subtended and the square of its distance\nfrom the vertex: both the numerator and denominator of this ratio have dimension\nlength<sup>2</sup>. It is useful, however, to distinguish between dimensionless\nquantities of different nature, so in practice the symbol \"sr\" is used to\nindicate a solid angle. For example, radiant intensity can be measured in watts\nper steradian (W·sr<sup>−1</sup>). The steradian was formerly an SI\nsupplementary unit, but this category was abolished from the SI in 1995 and the\nsteradian is now considered an SI derived unit.\n",
