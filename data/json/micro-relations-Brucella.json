They are small (0.5 to 0.7 by 0.6 to 1.5 Âµm), non-\nmotile, non-encapsulated coccobacilli, which function as facultative\nintracellular parasites.\n\nBrucella is the cause of brucellosis, which is a zoonosis. It is transmitted by\ningesting infected food (such as unpasteurized milk products), direct contact\nwith an infected animal, or inhalation of aerosols. Transmission from human to\nhuman, for example through sexual intercourse or from mother to child, is\nexceedingly rare, but possible. Minimum infectious exposure is\nbetween 10 - 100 organisms.\n\nThe different species of Brucella are genetically very similar although each has\na slightly different host specificity (see below). Hence the NCBI taxonomy\nincludes most Brucella species under Brucella melitensis.\n","linknr":272,"url":"Brucella","recorded":1362501576,"links":34,"instances":["microbiologist","symptom"],"pdf":["http://www.dhsspsni.gov.uk/brucellosis-pathway.pdf","http://www.dhsspsni.gov.uk/brucellosis-pathway.pdf"],"categories":["Rhizobiales"],"headings":["Human brucellosis","Diagnosis","Treatment","Host specificity and animal brucellosis","Possible Pathogens Responsible for the Plague in Thebes","Genomics","Effect of blue light","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c3/Brucella_melitensis.jpg/220px-Brucella_melitensis.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["david_bruce","microbiologist"],["david_bruce","microbiologist"],["anorexia","symptom"]],"members":["david_bruce","anorexia"],"related":["Bacteria","Proteobacteria","Alphaproteobacteria","Rhizobiales","Brucellaceae","Genus","Gram-negative","Bacterium","David_Bruce_(microbiologist)","Motile","Bacterial_capsule","Coccobacillus","Brucellosis","Zoonosis","Pasteurization","National_Center_for_Biotechnology_Information","David_Bruce_(microbiologist)","Malta","Arthralgia","Anorexia_(symptom)","Arthritis","Epididymoorchitis","Spondylitis","Liver_abscess","Endocarditis","Spleen","Liver","Lymph_node","Bone_marrow","Blood_culture","Castaneda_medium","Gram_stain","Gram-negative","Blood_culture","Urease","Bone_marrow","Rifampicin","Doxycycline","Goat","Sheep","Cattle","Dog","Pig","Sheep","Desert_Woodrat","Pinniped","Dolphin","Porpoise","Whale","Common_vole","Leishmania","Leptospira","Orthopoxviridae","Francisella_tularensis","Open_reading_frame","United_States_Department_of_Energy","Integrated_Microbial_Genomes_System"]}
